Initial  environmental  examinations  were \nAssessment  undertaken  for  three  sample  subprojects  and  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures  prepared.  These  were \nendorsed by the Local Government Engineering Department \n(LGED),  the  executing  agency,  on  29  October  2008  and \nuploaded to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on \n9 February 2009.   \n   \nProject Description  The Project builds on lessons from previous ADB investments \nin  the  small-scale  (less  than  1,000  hectare  [ha])  water \nresources  sector;  specifically,  the  Small-Scale  Water \nResources Development Sector Project (SSW 1), which was \nimplemented  from  1996  to  2002  and  developed  280 \nsubprojects  in  the  western  part  of  the  country.  Also,  the \nongoing Second Small-Scale Water Resources Development \nSector Project (SSW 2), which commenced in 2002 and is due \nto be completed in 2009. This has developed 275 subprojects \nin 61 of 64 districts of Bangladesh. \nThe Project will support the development of inclusive water \nmanagement cooperative associations (WMCAS) that include \nlandowners,  land  operators,  women,  fishers,  and  other \nvulnerable groups. The WMCAS should have sufficient social \nand technical capital to undertake small-scale water resources \n(SSWR) subprojects and to improve system operations. They \nshould have clear financing partnerships and/or cost-sharing \nmechanisms so they can carry out sustainable maintenance. \nWithin  an  enabling  institutional  framework,  they  should  be \ncapable  of  maximizing  their  collective  potential  to  increase \nagriculture production in the subproject areas. The Project will \nhave three outputs: (i) institutional strengthening of government \nagencies  at  all  levels  to  support  SSWR  development; \n(ii)  participatory  subprojects,  which  will  include  poor  and \nvulnerable  groups,  and  which  will  enable  WMCAs  to  plan, \nimplement,  operate,  and  maintain  subprojects;  and \n(iii)  construction  and  maintenance  of  up  to  230  SSWR \n ", "ii \n \nsubprojects  and  performance  enhancement  of  up  to  150 \nsubprojects (out of 560 completed) from SSW 1 and 2 projects. \n   \nRationale  About  80%  of  Bangladesh's  population  is  rural  and  mainly \nengaged in agriculture and related nonfarm activities. Although \nagriculture\u2019s share of gross domestic product (GDP), currently \nabout  20%,  has  been  declining,  it  remains  the  primary \neconomic  sector  in  rural  Bangladesh  and  provides  63%  of \nemployment. More than two-thirds of the rural population is \nlandless or functionally landless (owning less than 0.2 ha of \nland).  Even  productive  land  is  subject  to  regular  flooding. \nBangladesh has limited land and other natural resources and a \nhigh population density; as a result, rural poverty is as high as \n53%.  The  rural  poor  face  unfavorable  agricultural \nenvironments,  rely  heavily  on  agricultural  wage  labor,  and \npossess few agricultural and nonagricultural assets.  \nBangladesh is at the confluence of three major rivers and its \nflat topography, frequent flooding, river erosion, and seasonal \nwater  shortages,  combined  with  the  predicted  impacts  of \nclimate change, are key challenges. These are aggravated by \ninadequate  water  management  infrastructure,  limited \nbeneficiary participation, and poor operation and maintenance \n(O&M)  of  water  resources  infrastructure.  Increasing \nurbanization  and  the  expansion  of  fish  production  on \nagricultural land is forecast to result in a 1.64 million ha decline \nin agricultural land by 2050. Yields will need to increase by \n20% to compensate for the loss of agricultural land. Effective \nwater management and equitable access to water within an \nenabling policy and institutional framework are critical for the \nproduction base and livelihoods of rural poor. \nThe Project will support the National Strategy for Accelerated \nPoverty Reduction II of the Government of Bangladesh, which \nidentifies water resources development and management as a \ncritical sector for pro-poor economic growth and food security \nthrough agricultural development. The Project implements key \nelements  of  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy  including  institutional \nstrengthening  and  socially  inclusive  development  principles, \nincluding stakeholder consultation and participation at all levels. \nIt  also  supports  core  areas  of  operations  defined  in  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2020,  including  investing  in  rural  infrastructure  for \nwater management, building capacity for better infrastructure \nmanagement, and promoting institutional reforms that enhance \noperational  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  infrastructure \nprojects. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be enhanced productivity and \nsustainability in agriculture in subproject areas. The outcome of \nthe  Project  will  be  sustainable  small-scale  water  resources \nmanagement systems in subproject areas. \n   ", "iii \nProject Investment Plan  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n$107.3 million, including taxes and duties of $12.7 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested a loan of $55.0 million from \nADB's Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years, to finance 51.3% of project costs. An International \nFund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) loan in the amount of \n$22.0 million to finance about 20.5% of project costs will be \nprovided as cofinancing and will be administered by ADB. The \nIFAD loan will have a 40-year term with an annual service \ncharge of 0.75% (and a 10-year grace period before repayment \nof the principal amount begins). The Government will provide \n$26.6 million equivalent to finance 24.8% of project costs to \ncover land acquisition and resettlement, tax and duties, and \nincremental  recurrent  costs.  Project  beneficiaries  will  be \nresponsible for funding the operation and maintenance of water \nmanagement  civil  works  and  will  contribute  $3.7  million \nequivalent to finance 3.5% of project costs. \n   \n  Project Financing Plan ($ million) \nForeign  Local  Share \nSource  Currency Currency Total  (%) \nGovernment  0 26.6 26.6  24.8\nADB  10.8 44.2 55.0  51.3\nIFAD  2.8 19.2 22.0  20.5\nBeneficiaries  0 3.7 3.7  3. 5\n  Total:  13.6 93.7 107.3  100.0\n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2018 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2017 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  LGED of the Ministry of Local Government Rural Development \nand Cooperatives (MOLGRD&C). \n \n ", "iv \n \nImplementation  The Integrated Water Resources Management Unit (IWRMU) \nArrangements  within LGED is responsible for overall development, O&M, and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  support  for  SSWR \nsubprojects.  A  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be \nestablished within IWRMU to manage and coordinate project \nactivities. The PMO will receive support from four specialist \nsections  of  IWRMU  and  from  project  implementation \nconsultants.  Ten  regional  offices  of  LGED,  intermediary  to \nheadquarters  and  district  levels,  will  provide  training, \nsupervision, inspection and monitoring functions for completed \nsubprojects. A steering committee will be established for overall \ncoordination of concerned ministries and agencies. Planning \nand implementation committees at district and local levels will \nensure  smooth  coordination.  Local  governments,  LGED \nregional and district offices, specialist facilitators recruited from \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  or  firms,  and  local \ncommunity  assistants  will  help  to  form  the  WMCAs. \nDepartments  of  Cooperatives,  Agricultural  Extension  and \nFisheries will help to build their capacity by providing extension \nsupport  services.  Civil  works  will  be  initiated  following \nestablishment  and  capacity  building  of  WMCAs  who  will \nassume O&M responsibilities on completion of the subprojects. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of works, goods, and services financed by the \nADB and IFAD loans will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto  time)  and,  for  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB),  the \nGovernment\u2019s  applicable  public  procurement  regulations \nacceptable  to  ADB.  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB) \nprocedures will be followed for contracts of works for more than \n$2 million and national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures \nfor contracts of works of $2 million and below. Most civil works \nwill  be  carried  out  through  NCB,  given  the  small  size  of \nsubprojects.  Goods  will  be  procured  under  ICB  where  the \nestimated cost is more than $1,000,000 equivalent and NCB for \ncontracts from $100,000 to $1,000,000. Shopping procedures \nwill be used for contracts with estimated cost between $10,000 \nand  $100,000.  Contracts  below  $10,000  and  earthworks \ncontracts costing less than Tk330,000 (about $5,000) may be \nawarded  based  on  direct  contracting.  In  such  cases,  ADB \nshould be satisfied that the price paid is reasonable. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The Government will select and engage, using \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  method,  one \ninternational  consulting  firm  for  the  project  implementation \nconsultancy (PIC) at an estimated cost of $6.5 million. The PIC \nwill comprise a total of 1,092 person-months, comprising 64 \ninternational and 1,028 national person-months. The PIC will \nprovide experts in (i) institutional strengthening and capacity ", "v \nbuilding,  (ii)  quality  control  of  engineering  design  and \nsupervision of civil works, and (iii) social and environmental \nsafeguard  requirements.  National  consulting  firms  will  be \nrecruited using QCBS to prepare subproject feasibility studies \nand detailed engineering designs. NGOs will be recruited using \nQCBS  to  provide  agriculture  and  fisheries  enhancement \ntraining  and  O&M  support.  Individuals  will  be  recruited  as \ncommunity  assistants  in  accordance  with  specific  selection \ncriteria acceptable to ADB. Firms, institutes, or NGOs will be \nrecruited  using  least-cost  selection  for  participatory  rural \nappraisal  under  the  benefit  monitoring  evaluation  study  and \nbaseline impact evaluation. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will improve rural livelihoods through nationwide \nBeneficiaries  financing  of  investments  in  participatory  small-scale  water \nresources management, including flood management, drainage \nimprovement,  water  conservation,  and  command  area \ndevelopment  (includes  activities  to  improve  surface  water \nirrigation such as providing field channels and pipe systems), \nbenefiting 209,000 ha of cultivable land. It will directly benefit \n324,400 households (about 1.7 million people) through more \nintense cropping systems, increased culture fishing areas, and \ngreater crop and fish yields. For the three sample subprojects, \nover  80%  of  direct  beneficiaries  were  poor.  The  estimated \npoverty impact ratio (the percentage of the net financial benefits \nplus the economic surplus flowing to poor households divided \nby  the  total  net  financial  benefits  and  economic  surplus)  is \ncalculated  at  0.65.  The  economic  rate  of  return  for  the \nsubprojects ranges from 26% to 28% and for the overall Project \nit  is  29%.  Flood  management  and  drainage  improvement \nsubprojects are also expected to reduce damage to public and \nprivate infrastructure significantly and to contribute to measures \nto  adapt  to  climate  change.  Requiring  WMCA  management \ncommittees to have a one-third representation by women will \nraise the status of women in the community and encourage \nwomen  to  participate  in  income-generating  activities  and \nemployment. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risks are that infrastructure investments will not be \nsustainable and actions for institutional strengthening will not \nbe taken in a timely manner\u2014both of which are addressed in \nthe project design. LGED and WMCAs need to be reoriented \non system O&M to improve the sustainability of subprojects. \nUpfront cash contributions are insufficient to instill ownership \nand  perpetuate  system  maintenance,  so  the  Project  will \nintroduce a more broad based approach to maintenance that \nconsiders technical, institutional, financial, and social aspects. \nImprovements to LGED management will steadily increase the \nrate of subproject implementation. The role of IWRMU will be \nstrengthened  to  involve  it  more  deeply  in  subproject \ndevelopment and postconstruction support. IWRMU and LGED \n ", "vi \n \nregional and district offices (accompanied by greater human \nand fiscal resources) will guide future investments in the sector \nand  provide  continuous  technical  and  institutional  support. \nSystems are in place and will be improved by the Project for \ndemand-driven  subproject  selection,  technical  feasibility \nanalysis  of  subprojects,  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation, and construction management. The Project will \nalso strengthen WMCAs to maximize inclusiveness, particularly \nof poor and vulnerable people in decision making and project \nbenefits. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the International Fund for \nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD),  both  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the \nParticipatory Small-Scale Water Resources Sector Project. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In December 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA)1 to help the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) \nformulate the Participatory Small-Scale Water Resources Sector Project. This report is based \non the analysis and sample subproject feasibility studies of the PPTA (Supplementary Appendix \nA), findings of ADB missions, and discussions with officials and stakeholders. The project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  With a population2 of over 150 million living in an area of 147,570 square kilometers \n(1,045  persons  per  square  kilometer),  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  most  densely  populated \ncountries in the world. About 80% of the population lives in rural areas and is mainly engaged in \nagriculture  and  related  nonfarm  activities.  More  than  two-thirds  of  the  rural  population  is \nlandless or functionally landless (owning less than 0.2 hectares [ha] of land). The national \npoverty headcount ratio declined from 56.6% in 1991 to 48.9% in 2000 and further to 40% in \n2005.3 The rural poverty rate is now between 44% and 53%.4 Bangladesh has limited land and \nother natural resources, and a high population density. As a result, rural poverty is pervasive.  \n4.  Bangladesh has achieved impressive economic and social gains over the past decade, \nincluding GDP growth of 5%\u20136%, relatively low inflation, and fairly stable domestic debt, interest \nrates, and exchange rates. Its growth has been remarkably resilient despite numerous natural \ndisasters and some erosion in business confidence. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nin FY2008 remained strong at 6.2%, supported by more domestic economic activity in the \nsecond half of FY2008. Human poverty trends have improved more quickly than income poverty \ntrends. The human poverty index (based on deprivations in health, education, and nutrition) was \n61% in the early 1980s, declined to 47% in the early 1990s and dropped further to 35% in the \nlate 1990s. The index of human poverty has declined annually by 2.5% compared with a 1.5% \ndecline in the poverty headcount ratio for income poverty since late 1980s.5 \n5.  Despite this progress, Bangladesh remains one of the world\u2019s least developed countries \nwith GDP per capita of $555 (FY2008), poverty incidence of up to 53%, and a 48% child \nmalnutrition  rate  (footnote  5).  Although  agriculture\u2019s  share  of  GDP  (about  20%)  has  been \ndeclining as the economy grows, it remains the primary economic sector in rural Bangladesh \nand provides 63% of rural employment. Food crops represent about 72% of the value added by \nagriculture, followed by fisheries (11%), livestock (10%), and forestry (7%). \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2007.

Bangladesh is ranked 140 among 177 countries. UNDP. \n2007. Human Development Report 2007/2008. New York. \n ", "2   \n6.  The Government has an aggressive set of development targets based on the 2015 \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). These include (i) eradicating extreme poverty and \nhunger by halving, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than \n$1 a day; and (ii) reducing the proportion of malnourished children under five by 50%. The \nNational Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (NSAPR) II acknowledges the potential \nimpact of global climate change on Bangladesh and identifies water resources development and \nmanagement as a critical sector for pro-poor policies to achieve economic growth and food \nsecurity through agricultural development (footnote 3). NSAPR II is fully consistent with the \nMDGs  and  aims  to  achieve  substantial  improvement  in  almost  all  aspects  of  human \ndevelopment.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Poverty in Bangladesh is primarily rural and has many dimensions. Women are more \nvulnerable than men to poverty. Poverty headcount ratios (for 2008) range from 32% in Dhaka \nto over 50% in Barisal district. Extreme and chronic poverty persists, particularly for people \nliving in remote and vulnerable areas such as riverbanks (footnote 3). Meeting the MDG target \nfor poverty reduction will require a sustained GDP growth rate6 of 4% in agriculture and 7% in \nthe nonfarm sector, a formidable task. \n8.  Water  resources  management.  Bangladesh  faces  significant  physical  challenges \nbecause of its flat topography7 and its location at the confluence of three major transboundary \nrivers\u2014the  Brahmaputra,  the  Ganges,  and  the  Meghna.  On  average,  20%  of  the  country \nexperiences monsoon flooding over banks and faulty drainage. Severe flooding with about 60% \nof the country under water occurs about every decade. Periodic natural disasters (including \ncyclones and tidal surges) and dry season droughts have severe impacts on agriculture,8 \nfisheries, and livelihoods of people living in affected areas.9 Greater use of groundwater for \nagriculture and consumption and its deteriorating quality (specifically arsenic contamination of \nover 30% of groundwater resources10) has serious implications for health, soil degradation, and \nagricultural yields. Bangladesh needs to reduce its reliance on groundwater by improving the \nmanagement  of  surface  water  through  flood  management,  drainage  improvement,  water \nconservation, and by improving the reliability and efficiency of irrigation supplies in command \nareas.11 \n9.  Physical challenges are exacerbated by inadequate water management infrastructure, \nlimited  beneficiary  participation,  and  weak  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Increasing \nurbanization and an expansion of fish production on agricultural land (as culturable wasteland is \nutilized) is forecast to result in a loss of 1.64 million ha of agricultural land by 2050. Yields will \nneed to increase by 20% to compensate for the loss of this land. Effective water management \nand equitable access to water are critical for the production base and livelihoods of the rural \npoor.

From 1999 to 2003, floods damaged 740,000 ha of \nrice and 47,000 ha of other crops, corresponding to a loss of 1.4 million tons of rice and 200,000 tons of other \nproduction. \n9  The Ministry of Food and Disaster Management is the apex institution responsible for coordinating national disaster \nmanagement interventions across all agencies in Bangladesh. \n10  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 2006.

Food security. Since early 1980s, Bangladesh has achieved near self-sufficiency in rice \nproduction from a chronic food deficit. Since 2000, per capita food grain production has grown \nby 1.3% per year and agriculture\u2019s growth target for 2009 is 4.0%, up from 3.6% in 2008. Total \ncultivable land for aus and aman rice increased by 17% in 2008. Despite these achievements, \nfood security remains vulnerable particularly in years when production is affected by natural \ndisasters12 and (as witnessed in 2008) dramatic increases in world food prices. The price of rice \nin the international market rose by 196% (from $325 per ton in May 2007 to $963 per ton in May \n2008).13 In April 2008, the retail price of coarse rice increased by 61% to Tk32.1 per kilogram \n(kg) from Tk19.9/kg in April 2007.14 However, by September 2008, the rice price had fallen back \nto $686 per ton\u2014still 110% higher than the 2007 price. \n11.  Food price surges (mainly for rice) in 2008 seriously eroded the purchasing capacity of \npeople living below the poverty line. According to a 2008 study15 on the weighted inflationary \nimpact of the price of rice, an additional 8.5% of households (2.5 million households or 12 \nmillion people) fell below the poverty line in 2008. People below the poverty line saw their \nincomes eroded by 36.7% from January 2007 to March 2008. Continued significant growth in \nfood crop production is critical to tackling rural poverty. Efforts to increase food grain production \nneed to be continued to keep pace with population growth and to ensure food security for the \npoor. Providing effective and sustainable water management infrastructure is an important part \nof this effort. \n12.  Vulnerability to climate change. Climate change is a pressing development challenge \nfor Bangladesh. Projected impacts16 include an increase in temperature of over 1.0\u00b0C by 2050 \nand average sea level rises of 30 cm by 2050, which could make an additional 14% of the \ncountry extremely vulnerable to floods and dislocate more than 35 million people from coastal \ndistricts. With rising sea surface temperatures, the intensity and frequency of cyclones and \nstorm  surges  are  also  likely  to  increase.  Poor  communities,  which  are  disproportionately \ndependent on marginal lands including the coastal belt, will be most affected. \n13.  Climate change threatens the significant achievements made by Bangladesh in the last \n20  years  in  raising  incomes  and  reducing  poverty.  It  also  poses  major  threats  to  the \nachievement  of  the  MDGs,  particularly  those  on  eliminating  poverty  and  promoting \nenvironmental sustainability. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns, along with \nhigher flooding and rising salinity in the coastal belt are likely to reduce crop production. The \nIntergovernmental  Panel  for  Climate  Change  estimates  that  by  2050  rice  production  in \nBangladesh could have declined by 8% and wheat by 32% from 1990 levels. In southeast \nBangladesh, an estimated 14,000 tons a year of grain production could be lost because of sea \nlevel rises by 2030 and 252,000 tons a year could be lost by 2075. Greater requirements for \nfertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation may result in higher production costs. \n                                                 \n12  Severe flooding and cyclone damage in 2007 seriously affected the aman rice crop. Losses were estimated at \n$2.8 billion or 3.6% of GDP. \n13  FAO. 2008.

Sustainability of water resources infrastructure. Since 1980, more than $6 billion has \nbeen invested in water resources infrastructure in Bangladesh, mainly for flood management, \ndrainage, irrigation and riverbank protection. A weakness that continues to plague investments \nin the water sector is the lack of long-term O&M of water management facilities. Deferred or \nnonexistent maintenance of such facilities has direct impacts on productivity, rural incomes, and \npoverty. It leads to a deterioration of infrastructure, causing (i) reductions in irrigated areas;      \n(ii) increases in inundation because of drainage congestion; and (iii) an insufficient supply of \nirrigation water.  \n15.  The issue is complicated by inadequate financing,17 beneficiary disengagement, weak \nservice  delivery,  and  an  inability  to  move  beyond  relatively  short-term  project-related \ncommitments. The sustainability of water resources management systems by strengthening \nlocal  water  management  institutions  is  central  to  safeguarding  investments  made  in  water \nresources. Technical service providers also need strengthening18 and reorienting so they can \nsupport and mentor local water management institutions to help them carry out O&M. Strategic \ndirection and clarity in postconstruction support for O&M, its operationalization through a distinct \nstage  of  the  subproject  development  process,  and  reorientation  of  service  providers  for \nspecialized institutional and technical support are key challenges. \n16.  Strengthening policy, institutional, and fiscal arrangements. The Government has \nmaximized  efforts  since  1990  to  establish  a  policy  framework  to  address  complex  water \nresources issues. The adoption of the National Water Policy (NWP) in 1999 provided clear \npolicy goals and principles for integrated and participatory water management, decentralization, \nbetter governance, and sustainable O&M, combined with decentralization of management. The \nNWP  identifies  establishment  of  a  legislative  framework  as  fundamental  to  effective \nimplementation of the policy\u2019s principles and policy goals. In support of the NWP, ADB has \nfacilitated policy reforms for the water sector through a regional technical assistance (TA) \nproject for Process Development for Preparing and Implementing Integrated Water Resources \nManagement Plans.19 Under this TA project, the draft National Water Act has been expanded \nand finalized. A suggested road map for the sector and potential areas of ADB assistance \n(Appendix 2) has also been prepared. The TA project is supporting the periodic review and \nupdating  of  the  NWMP  and  has  identified  actions  for  improvement  in  river  and  flood \nmanagement,  drainage,  irrigation  facilities,  and  sustainable  O&M.  The  National  Water \nManagement Plan (NWMP), which was approved in 2004, has been an important outcome of \nthe NWP. This 25-year investment plan is designed to coordinate water resources and related \nsector development activities.  \n17.  Given the complexity and diversity of interests among water resources stakeholders in \nBangladesh,  water  management  interventions  require  cross-sectoral  perspectives  and \nstakeholder  consultation.  The  Government  approved  guidelines  for  participatory  water \nmanagement  (GPWM)  in  November  2000,  which  emphasize  stakeholder  participation  and \nsound institutional development. To provide a  legal framework for the operation of cooperatives, \nthe Cooperatives Ordinance, 1984 and Cooperatives Societies Rules, 1987 were amended in \n2001 to provide enabling legal provisions for alternative forms of water management groups \n                                                 \n17  The Government of Bangladesh Emergency Fund is currently used to meet most annual maintenance costs for \nsmall-scale water resources infrastructure. It is heavily oversubscribed with an average proposed annual budget for \nfiscal year 2008 being Tk68.5 million and actual expenditure just Tk18.2 million. About 30% of funds are used for \nroutine maintenance rater than emergency activities. \n18  ADB.  2007.

Under the NWP, the local government is responsible for small-scale schemes (less than \n1,000 ha) with the support of Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) of the Ministry \nof Local Government Rural Development and Cooperatives (MOLGRD&C). Since 1980s, LGED \nhas improved local coordination and increased the effectiveness of integrated approaches to the \nidentification  and  formulation  of  interventions. ADB  support  for  the  first  Small-Scale  Water \nResources Sector Development Project21 (SSW 1) and the ongoing Second Small-Scale Water \nResources  Sector  Development  Project22  (SSW  2),  both  implemented  by  LGED,  have \nimplemented key principles of NWP through organizational reform and capacity building. They \nhave maximized stakeholder participation and management transfer in line with the GPWM. \nUnder SSW 2, LGED has established an integrated water resources management unit (IWRMU) \nat its headquarters to support the small-scale water resources (SSWR) sector. IWRMU requires \nfurther  support  to  ensure  its  long-term  sustainability  and  to  emphasize  its  central  role  in \nproviding O&M, a core theme of NWP, NWMP, and GPWM. The Project will strengthen WMCAs \nin their role as system operators and managers. It will develop a comprehensive O&M strategy, \nensure it is adopted, and support further decentralization of LGED responsibilities to the field.   \n19.  The  Project  will  stress  close  interagency  links  and  extension  support  services, \nparticularly  for  agriculture  and  fisheries.  Existing  memorandums  of  understanding  between \nLGED and partner organizations23 facilitate implementation of SSWR development, although \nthere remains a need to coordinate support services. Particular efforts are required at the \nDepartment of Cooperatives (DOC) under the Rural Development and Cooperative Division of \nMOLGRD&C\u2014the principal government organization responsible for statutory, regulatory and \npromotional services for WMCAs. With growing investments in the water sector, these functions \nwill become increasingly vital to maximize the economic and social potential of WMCAs. The \nProject will strengthen the (i) specialist knowledge and orientation of DOC to support WMCAs, \n(ii)  WMCA-specific  training,  (iii) information  sharing  between  DOC  and  LGED,  and  \n(iv) operational support at DOC district level.  \n20.  Experiences and lessons. ADB has been a leading agency in the small-scale water \nresources sector (Appendix 3) and has supported a series of successful24 projects since 1996, \ndeveloping  about  570  subprojects.  Successive  SSWR  investments  in  Bangladesh  have \ndemonstrated that better rural water management and crop production technologies enable \nwater users to increase productivity, strengthen household food security, improve nutrition, and \nsafeguard  rural  livelihoods  by  reducing  the  risk  of  flooding.  ADB's  project  performance \nevaluation report (footnote 18) for SSW 1 gave an overall project assessment of successful.

Dhaka. \n ", "6   \nfound that decentralized, community-managed SSWR had improved rural incomes and had \nbeen  an  effective  means  of  reducing  rural  poverty.  Benefit  monitoring  evaluation25 (BME) \nindicated that, between 2002 and 2008, (i) average cropping intensity had increased by 28% \nfrom 170% to 198%, compared with only 8% within the control area; (ii) paddy production had \nincreased by 57%; (iii) nonagricultural assets had increased from Tk9,993 to Tk13,779; and  \n(iv) annual income from agriculture crops had increased by 93% from Tk23,150 per household \nto Tk44,729 per household. The midterm review26 of SSW 2 reported \"encouraging\" results and \nacknowledged  the  Project's  inclusive  approach  toward  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  It \nparticularly noted that women\u2019s participation in WMCAs had significantly changed their status \nwithin the family and more broadly, in the community.  \n21.  Evaluations  of  SSW  1  and  SSW  2  (Appendix  4)  indicate  that  SSWR  management \nsystems provide direct and tangible benefits, functional infrastructure, strong local leadership, \nand proactive support from service providers. Specifically, (i) the poor and disadvantaged, \nespecially landless people and women, benefited from the construction of earthworks and labor-\nintensive agriculture and fishing activities and (ii) beneficiary engagement at all stages of the \nsubproject development process improved the sustainability of WMCAs. However, the O&M of \nSSWR management infrastructure was weak and impeded the realization of potential benefits.27  \n22.  The  following  key  lessons  are  reflected  in  the  design,  implementation,  and  O&M \nmanagement of the Project. \n(i)  Successful WMCAs have farming, entrepreneurial, management and leadership \nskills;  enthusiastic  leadership;  a  common  goal;  salaried  staff  for  maintaining \naccounts and records; and a transparent system for raising and utilizing funds. \n(ii)  Subproject implementation requires effective coordination with relevant agencies \nand strong field level support to strengthen WMCAs. \n(iii)  Requirements  for  routine  maintenance  need  to  be  separated  from  those  for \nemergency  maintenance.  The  roles  of  various  stakeholders  with  regard  to \nsystem O&M need to be properly understood.  \n(iv)  WMCAs  have  not  collected  or  spent  enough  on  maintenance  to  prevent  a \ngradual  buildup  of  deferred  maintenance.  Deferred  maintenance  leads  to  a \n\u201cbuild\u2013neglect\u2013replace\u201d cycle and a loss of benefits and affects the sustainability \nof WMCAs. Activities to institutionalize WMCA-managed O&M through a detailed \nstrategy should be initiated at an early stage of subproject development.  \n(v)  WMCA microcredit activities are generally weak because they follow a blanket \n(rather  than  demand-driven)  strategy.  There  are  shortages  of  skilled  WMCA \nmembers, LGED staff, and salaried staff to collect savings and loan installments. \n(vi)  Women\u2019s  participation  in  WMCAs  has  an  encouraging  effect  on  subproject \nimplementation. Although there is one-third reserved membership for women in \nWMCA  managing  committees,  women\u2019s  effectiveness  depends  on  their \ncapabilities, which can be improved through training. \n23.  Link to Government and ADB strategies.  The strategic thrust of ADB\u2019s assistance for \nthe  rural  sector  in  Bangladesh  has  been  poverty  reduction  through  shared  growth,  social \ndevelopment, and good governance. The Project will support ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \n                                                 \n25  Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies. 2008.

In doing so, it will maximize the collective potential for \nincreasing the agricultural productivity of rural poor. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Sector Investment \n25.  The Project will finance subproject investments in the small-scale water resources sector, \nin particular the provision of flood management, drainage, water conservation, access to surface \nwater for irrigation during the dry season, and command area development subprojects. The \nProject will develop 230 new subprojects in 46 out of 61 districts32 of Bangladesh, excluding \nthree districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts and 15 districts in which similar subprojects are being \nfinanced by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under its Small-Scale Water \nResources Development Project.33 The performance of existing SSW 1 and SSW 2 subprojects \nwill be improved in 61 districts (excluding three districts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts). Three \nsample subprojects have been prepared to assess the technical, social, financial, economic, \nand  environmental  feasibility  of  subsequent  subprojects  and  of  the  overall  Project.  The \nKanakdia  and  Purba  Sarail-Madai  subprojects  provide  flood  management  and  drainage \nimprovements, while the Goshinga subproject is focused on command area development and \nimprovements to the irrigation distribution system. Subproject feasibility studies are presented in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n26.  The impact of the Project will be enhanced productivity and sustainability in agriculture in \nsubproject areas.

Outputs \n27.  There  will  be  three  main  outputs:  (i) institutional  strengthening,  (ii)  participatory \nsubproject  development,  and  (iii)  small-scale  water  resources  infrastructure  and  project \nimplementation support. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and the policy \nand institutional framework is in Appendix 5.  \n1.  Output 1: Institutional Strengthening \n28.  The Project will strengthen LGED, IWRMU, and DOC through training in (i) project \norientation  and  management;  (ii)  planning,  design  and  construction  methods;  (iii)  WMCA \nestablishment  and  management;  (iv)  improved  O&M;  (v)  environmental  management;  and  \n(vi) gender awareness. The training program aims to enhance the long-term capabilities of the \ninstitutional  stakeholders,  particularly  IWRMU  and  DOC,  to  carry  out  small-scale  water \nresources  development  according  to  the  NWP.  It  will  also  enhance  performance  in \nimplementing the water resources development activities of the Project. \n29.  Capacity  enhancement  of  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department. The \nProject will further strengthen LGED's delivery of services for SSWR development. In particular, \nit will (i) provide training for IWRMU specialist sections on planning and design, O&M, social and \ngender development, and social and environmental capabilities; (ii) support decentralization of \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) and O&M support to the LGED regional offices34 by creating \n(revenue)  budgeted  positions  for  a  senior  sociologist  and  an  assistant  engineer  (water \nresources) to support SSWR activities. In year 1 of project implementation, positions will be \ncreated and budgeted in four of the 10 LGED regional offices, in year 3, positions will be created \nand budgeted in a further four regional offices, and in year 5, positions will be created and \nbudgeted  in  the  remaining  two  LGED  regional  offices.  Training  will  include  better  O&M \norientation, quality control and environmental management to build staff capacity and enable \nthem  to  play  a  meaningful  role  in  participatory  development  and  future  O&M  of  SSWR \nsubprojects. \n30.  Institutional  strengthening  of  the  Department  of  Cooperatives.  The  DOC  is \nbecoming increasingly important in ensuring WMCA sustainability, because of the increasing \nnumber of WMCAs and the vital importance of organizational sustainability. The Project will  \n(i) establish a dedicated DOC water cell35 to focus on WMCAs and provide a direct link for \nimproved  coordination  with  IWRMU;  (ii)  provide  focused  training  to  DOC  in  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  the  WMCA  and  statutory,  regulatory  and  promotional  services;  and  \n(iii) support DOC at the district level by providing goods and equipment.  \n31.  Improved  performance  monitoring. Under  SSW 1 and SSW 2,  a comprehensive \nproject management information system (MIS) database has been collected. However, the data \nhave been of limited value in providing practical information to support WMCA development. \nThe Project will (i) streamline the performance monitoring system; (ii) expand database access \nto key departments (Department of Agricultural Extension [DAE], Department of Fisheries [DOF], \nand DOC) so they can use the data to plan WMCA support activities; and (iii) train LGED district \nstaff in monitoring the benefits in each subproject. \n2.  Output 2: Participatory Subproject Development \n32.  Output 2 will refine critical aspects of the participatory subproject development process \n(Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix C). The Project will support engagement of locally \n                                                 \n34  Ten LGED regional offices between the national and district levels located at Dhaka, Mymensingh, Faridpur, \nSylhet, Comilla, Chittagong, Barisal, Rangpur, Rajshahi, and Jessore. \n35 This  will  be  a  unit  within  DOC  comprising  dedicated  team  of  persons  responsible  for  water  management \nassociations and WMCAs and their strengthening.

The Project will provide \nbeneficiaries with needs-based agricultural and fisheries training (a capacity development plan \nis provided in Supplementary Appendix D) and will build links with specialist service providers. \n33.  Water-resources-oriented  support  programs.  DAE  and  project-based  agriculture \nextension facilitators will promote the adoption of environmentally sound agricultural practices. \nIn  particular,  the  Project  will  support  (i) integrated  pest  management,  (ii)  expansion  of \nproduction of high-yield variety rice crops, and (iii) crop diversification. DOF and project-based \nfisheries facilitators will provide training in (i) managing fisheries resources in inland water \nbodies in subproject areas; and (ii) maximizing culture fishery opportunities in khals, which will \nbe reserved for the poor and people who have lost access to floodplain fisheries. \n34.  Operation  and  maintenance  capacity  development  of  water  management \ncooperative  associations.  The  Project  will  reorient  WMCAs  to  recognize  their  role  and \nresponsibilities for system O&M. A detailed O&M strategy and a distinct O&M stage36 of the \nsubproject development process will focus on sustainable maintenance and improved operation \n(Supplementary Appendix F). The Project will select (in accordance with an agreed grading \nsystem37) 150 of the better-performing SSW 1 and SSW 2 subprojects for further training of \nWMCAs  in  (i)  O&M  planning;  (ii) technical  and  financial  management  skills;  and  \n(iii) maintenance cost-sharing38 and fund utilization. \n35.  Participation  of  women  in  subproject  development.  Previous  SSWR  projects \nindicated that women\u2019s equal participation and involvement in small-scale water management \nprojects is essential for their sustainability. To motivate and mobilize women as decision makers, \nthere  will  be  30%  representation  by  women  (from  all  social  categories)  on  the  WMCA \nmanagement  committees.  The  Project  will  also  support  the  role  of  women  in  SSWR \ndevelopment by (i) training women in income-generating activities, including fish culture and \nimproved agricultural practices; (ii) priority employment of destitute women in labor contracting \nsocieties for subproject earthworks; (iii) social mobilization of women stakeholders so they are \nfully  included  in  subproject  development  process;  and  (iv)  provision  of  demand-driven \nmicrocredit.39 The inclusion of women on participatory rural appraisal (PRA) teams, identification \nof  households  headed  by  women,  and  involvement  of  female  union  parishad  members  in \nWMCA activities will have a positive impact on subproject implementation. The summary gender \naction plan is in Appendix 7 and the summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 8.  \n3.  Output 3: Small-Scale Water Resources Infrastructure and Project \nImplementation Support \n36.  Based on agreed subproject selection criteria, the Project will develop up to 230 small-\nscale water resources subprojects. The interventions will be as follows.  \n                                                 \n36  Under SSW 2, three stages for subproject development were adopted: (i) stage 1: identification and feasibility; \n(ii) stage 2: design and institution building; and (iii) stage 3: construction and first-year joint O&M. The PPTA and \nO&M study recommended the addition of stages 4 and 5: sustainable O&M and mentoring. \n37  As provided in the O&M strategy for small-scale water resources subprojects developed under ADB regional \ntechnical assistance. ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Promoting Effective Water Management Policies and \nPractices (Phase 5). Manila (TA 6325-REG, contract no. S17441). \n38  Current indicators for WMCA performance focus on financial  achievements rather than a  holistic range of \npostconstruction indicators. \n39  Unlike mainstream microfinance, where capital is injected from external resources, WMCAs rely entirely on their \nsavings and share capital as a source of funds. \n ", "10   \n(i)   Flood  management.  Rehabilitate  and  construct  embankments  and/or  sluice \ngates to reduce the depth and duration of flooding of farmland.  \n(ii)   Drainage improvement. Re-excavate drainage canals to increase the capacity \nof drainage systems to benefit agriculture and culture fisheries.  \n(iii)   Water  conservation. Develop the water retention capacity of existing haors, \nbeels, and canals to increase availability of irrigation water. \n(iv)  Command area development. Improve existing irrigation systems by providing \nbetter distribution systems to increase efficiency and productivity. \n37.  The Project will also improve the system functionality of 150 better performing (out of \n570)  completed  subprojects40 to  maximize  benefits  through  low-cost  investments  such  as \nadditional regulating structures.  \nD.  Special Features \n38.  Investments by ADB in the SSWR sector have demonstrated the value of progressive, \nstep-wise improvements in the institutional framework and the advantage of continuous efforts \nto catalyze institutional change. Innovative features of the Project include:  \n(i)   raising the profile of IWRMU, activating LGED at the regional level, institutional \nstrengthening  and  capacity  building  of  DOC,  and  demonstrating  that \ninstitutionalizing participatory planning and implementation requires a continual \nprocess for broad-based, pro-poor economic growth; \n(ii)   strengthening  the  O&M  capabilities  of  LGED  and  WMCAs  contributes  to  an \nevolving  approach  of  successive  ADB  investments  in  the  SSWR  sector.  It \nreaffirms key concepts of NWP for sustainability of water resources infrastructure \nthrough greater community participation (particularly poor and vulnerable groups). \nThe  Project  will  introduce  a  maintenance  cost-sharing  mechanism, 41  and \nreorientate LGED and beneficiaries from short-term \"design\u2013build\" interests to \nlonger-term benefits from sustainable systems;  \n(iii)    highlighting  the  importance  of  water  sector  governance  by  increasing  the \naccountability  of  water  infrastructure  providers  to  WMCA-based  local \ncommunities through the implementation of subproject agreements for small-\nscale water resources infrastructure based on community participation in O&M \nagreements,  sustainable  cost-sharing,  and  continuous  external  performance \nmonitoring; \n(iv)   expanding  SSWR  development  to  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts, 42 which  are \ngeographically isolated and inhabited by ethnic minority groups.43 Potential scope \nfor  integrated  water  resources  management  (likely  of  small-scale)  will  be \naddressed through a supplementary Water Financing Partnership Facility study44 \n(proposal in Supplementary Appendix H); and  \n(v)  strengthening the gender mainstreaming capacities of LGED, partner agencies, \nand  WMCAs,  thereby  increasing  the  participation  of  women  in  water \nmanagement, O&M, and, as users, enabling women to play an effective role in \nWMCA decision making and empowering them through project services and \n                                                 \n40  The remaining subprojects will be graded and assessed for support through additional grant funding within 12 \nmonths of project commencement. \n41  Recommendations are annual maintenance (100% WMCA); theft and willful damage (LGED 50%, WMCA: 50%); \nmajor and periodic repairs (LGED 50%, WMCA 50%); emergency repairs (100% LGED from the emergency fund). \n42  Comprising Rangamati, Banderban and Khagrachari districts. \n43  With indigenous people from 11 distinct groupings and recently settled Bengalis from plain areas. \n44 The  study  began  in  June  2009  and  will  supplement  preparation  of  ensuing  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Rural \nDevelopment Project II.

The Government has requested a loan of $55.0 million from ADB's Special Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years to finance \n51.3% of the project costs. An IFAD loan in the amount of $22.0 million to finance 20.5% of the \noverall project costs will be provided as cofinancing and will be administered by ADB. IFAD \nfunding  of  project  output  3  will  be  40%  of  component  costs  and  ADB  financing  60%  of \ncomponent  costs  of  exclusive  subprojects.  For  project  output  2  (participatory  subproject \ndevelopment), ADB will finance 60% of the capacity development costs and IFAD will finance \n40%. The IFAD loan will have a 40-year term with an annual service charge of 0.75% and a 10-\nyear grace period (before repayment of principal amount begins). The Government will provide \n$26.6  million  equivalent,  or  24.8%  of  the  project  cost  for  land  acquisition,  resettlement \ncompensation, tax and duties, and incremental recurrent cost. Project beneficiaries will be \nresponsible for funding operations and maintenance of water management civil works with a \ncontribution of $3.7 million equivalent or 3.5% of total project cost.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n41.  LGED,  under  the  Local  Government  Division of  MOLGRD&C  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency and will have the overall responsibility for project implementation.  \n42.  Project steering committee. MOLGRD&C will establish a project steering committee. \nThe committee will be chaired by the secretary of the Local Government Division and the chief \nengineer of LGED will be the member-secretary. Its members will consist of representatives of \nrelevant  ministries  and  line  agencies. 45  The  committee  will  be  responsible  for  overall \ncoordination and will (i) provide guidance on policy and strategic direction; (ii) review and \nevaluate project performance; (iii) resolve issues affecting project implementation, as needed; \nand (iv) facilitate interagency coordination. The committee will meet as required, whenever an \nissue requiring interministerial coordination arises, but at least once annually. \n43.  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  Unit.  The  IWRMU  within  LGED  is \nresponsible  for  overall  development  and  O&M,  and  M&E  support  for  SSWR  subprojects. \nIWRMU has four permanent specialist sections (planning and design, O&M, social and gender \ndevelopment, and environment and safeguards) and is headed by an additional chief engineer \nresponsible for the provision of technical and institutional support to strengthen the WMCAs. A \nsuperintending engineer will assist the additional chief engineer in discharging all functions to \npermanent specialist sections of IWRMU and will ensure that IWRMU performance is consistent \nwith its mandate (see organizational chart in Appendix 11 and associated key staff terms of \nreference in Supplementary Appendix B).  \n44.  Project management office. The project management office (PMO) will be established \nwithin IWRMU to manage and coordinate the project activities. The PMO will be headed by a \nproject director, who will be one of the full-time senior executive engineers and will have eight \ndedicated staff46 and 2,016 person-months (over the lifetime of the Project) of administrative \nsupport staff. The eight professional staff will be located in specialist sections of the IWRMU but \nwill remain full-time PMO staff and report directly to the project director, who will report directly \nto, and work under the supervision and guidance of, the additional chief engineer. The PMO will \n(i) coordinate with partner agencies; (ii) prepare the project implementation plan and annual \nproject work plans and budgets; (iii) review and approve subproject appraisals; (iv) review and \napprove subproject designs; (v) supervise LGED district offices in the bidding process, civil \n                                                 \n45 Includes Ministry of Establishment, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Land, Ministry \nof Youth and Sports, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, Economic Relations \nDivision and Finance Division under Ministry of Finance, Planning Commission and Implementation Monitoring and \nEvaluation  Division,  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board,  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension,  Water \nResources Planning Organization, Department of Fisheries, Department of Women's Affairs, Department of \nCooperatives, Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation and Local Government Engineering Department. \n46  Including project director, executive engineer (training), executive engineer (implementation), assistant engineer \n(environment), assistant engineer (implementation), junior water resources engineer, and community participation \nofficers. ", "13 \nworks,  and  other  project  activities;  (vi)  maintain  financial  accounts;  (vii)  prepare  periodic \nconsolidated reports on the implementation of subprojects; (viii) monitor project progress; and \n(ix) evaluate environmental and social impacts. The PMO will receive support from the four \nspecialist sections of the IWRMU and the project implementation consultants.  \n45.  Regional  offices.  Ten  regional  offices  will  serve  as  intermediaries  between  the \nheadquarters and district levels,47 each headed by a superintending engineer reporting to the \nadditional  chief  engineer  IWRMU,  assisted  by  an  executive  engineer  (training),  assistant \nengineer (general), assistant engineer (water resources), and senior sociologist. The regional \noffices will provide supervision, inspection and monitoring functions for completed subprojects \nand are responsible for technical training of executive engineers, labor contracting societies, \nand WMCAs that are provided at the regional training centers. Project activities within a given \nregion will be coordinated by the PMO and the applicable regional superintending engineer. \n46.  LGED  district  and  upazila  offices.  At  the  district  level,  no  separate  project \nimplementation offices will be established. District and upazila offices will implement the Project \nat the district level (a system that worked well under SSW 2). Under the close guidance and \nsupervision of the PMO, LGED district offices will be responsible for implementation at the \nsubproject level with assistance from the LGED upazila offices. The LGED district executive \nengineer will act as subproject manager. The LGED district offices will (i) prepare individual \nsubproject implementation plans in consultation with local stakeholders; (ii) coordinate with \nother  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  firms,  and  institutes  concerned; \n(iii) support local stakeholders to organize into WMCAs with support from NGOs, facilitators and \nthe LGED sociologist; (iv) carry out field surveys with assistance from the PMO; (v) supervise \nconstruction activities and make payments to contractors; and (vi) monitor and report subproject \ndevelopment  to  the  PMO.  The  upazila  engineer  will  report  to  the  LGED  district  executive \nengineer  and  will  (i)  help  the  WMCA  to  prepare  annual  plans;  (ii)  monitor  subproject \nperformance and (iii) convey major maintenance needs to the LGED district level.    \n2.  Implementation Period \n47.  The project implementation period will be 8 years. The Project will begin in 2009 and end \nin 2017 (the implementation schedule is provided in Appendix 12). \n3.  Procurement \n48.  Procurement of works, goods and services financed by ADB and IFAD loans will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime)  and,  for  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB),  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  public \nprocurement regulations acceptable to ADB. International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures \nwill be followed for contracts of works more than $2 million and NCB procedures for contracts of \nworks of $2 million and below. Since most subprojects will be small, they will use NCB for civil \nworks. Goods will be procured under ICB where the estimated cost is more than $1 million and \nNCB for contracts above $100,000 up to $1,000,000. Shopping procedures will be used for \ncontracts with estimated cost between $10,000 and $100,000. Contracts below $10,000 and \nearthworks contracts costing less than Tk330,000 (about $5,000) may be awarded based on \ndirect contracting.48 A procurement plan is provided in Appendix 13. \n4.  Consulting Services \n49.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The project will select and engage, using the \n                                                 \n47  Each region covers four to eight districts. \n48  In such cases, ADB should be satisfied that the price paid is reasonable. \n ", "14   \nquality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method, one international consulting firm for a project \nimplementation consultancy (PIC) at an estimated cost of $6.5 million.49 The PIC will provide \nexperts in (i) institutional strengthening and capacity building, (ii) quality control of engineering \ndesign and supervision of civil works, and (iii) social and environmental safeguard requirements. \nNational  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  using  QCBS  for  the  preparation  of  subproject \nfeasibility  studies  and  detailed  engineering  design.  NGOs  will  be  recruited  using  QCBS \nprocedures  to  provide  agriculture  and  fisheries  enhancement  training  and  O&M  support. \nIndividuals will be recruited for community assistants in accordance with specific selection \ncriteria acceptable to ADB. Firms, institutes, or NGOs will be recruited for PRAs using least-cost \nselection.  \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n50.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  LGED.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n51.  The Project incorporates other measures, in addition to the standard ADB requirements, \nto deter corruption and increase transparency. The Project will (i) build LGED\u2019s capacity to \ncomply with ADB and government procedures, to be outlined in the project administration \nmanual during the early stage of the implementation; (ii) establish a project website to disclose \ninformation about project implementation; and (iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to \nensure greater accountability. The project website will provide updated, detailed information on \nproject implementation. For example, it will include procurement-related information, such as the \nlist of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on bidding procedures \nadopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods and/or services procured. The \ngrievance redress mechanism will be set up to receive and resolve complaints, as well as to act \nupon  stakeholders\u2019  reports  of  irregularities  on  project-related  matters,  including  grievances \nconcerning resettlement. The EA will widely publicize the existence of this mechanism to ensure \nthat stakeholders are aware that a venue is available to address concerns or grievances relating \nto fraud, corruption, abuse, and any other aspects of project implementation.  \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n52.  All disbursements under the ADB and IFAD loans will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Two imprest \naccounts (ADB and IFAD) will be established at the Bangladesh Bank immediately after the loan \neffectiveness. The imprest account ceiling will be 10% of the loan (for ADB and IFAD) or the \nestimated expenditure for the next 6 months, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditure \nprocedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse,  replenish,  and  liquidate  eligible  expenditures  not \nexceeding $100,000 per payment. Separate project operating accounts will be opened at a \ncommercial bank by LGED. At district level, the participating districts will open separate project \naccounts for civil works implementation and subproject specific activities. The fund flow diagram \nand disbursement procedures are provided in Appendix 10 and financial management capacity \nassessment in Supplementary Appendix J. \n                                                 \n49 The PIC will provide a total of 1,092 person-months of consultant time: 64 from international consultants and 1,028 \nfrom national consultants. A 90:10 technical\u2013financial ratio will be adopted for the evaluation of proposals. ", "15 \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n53.  The Government, acting through LGED, will maintain records and accounts to identify all \ngoods and services financed by loan proceeds. Each of the participating district and upazilas \nwill maintain similar records and submit monthly and annual accounts and financial statements \nto the PMO for further submission to ADB. The Government will ensure that accounts and \nfinancial statements are audited annually, in accordance with sound accounting principles, by \nindependent external auditors acceptable to ADB. LGED will furnish to ADB, not later than \n6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited accounts and financial \nstatements, and the report of the auditor on these accounts and financial statements. Separate \naudit opinion on the use of statement of expenditure and imprest accounts will be provided as \npart of annual audit reports. \n54.  The PMO will prepare consolidated quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB \nand the Local Government Division within 20 days of the end of the applicable period. The \nreports will be prepared in a format acceptable to ADB and will cover: (i) project progress in \neach district and subdistrict; (ii) the status of institutional development activities; (iii) delays and \nproblems encountered and actions taken to resolve them; (iv) compliance with loan covenants; \nand (v) expected progress during the next 6 months. Within 6 months of the Project\u2019s physical \ncompletion,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report, \nincluding costs and compliance with loan covenants.  \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  The ongoing SSW 2 project has a well-established project performance management \nsystem and a comprehensive MIS database and these will be continued under the Project. A \nBME study using baseline data from previous projects will be carried out every 5 years and will \nbe  contracted  to  a  private  organization.  An  effect  monitoring  and  evaluation  has  been \nundertaken every year on the SSW 2 and this uses an extensive MIS operated by the current \nPMO and IWRMU. Although thoroughly designed, the MIS now appears to collect more data \nthan is practically required; the data-entering process is time consuming, and much of the \ninformation is linked to processes rather than to postconstruction monitoring and evaluation. \nThe PIC M&E specialist will streamline the system and ensure it collects poverty and gender-\ndisaggregated data. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the PMO will submit a detailed \nimplementation monitoring plan to ADB for review and concurrence by ADB and IFAD. The \nPMO will also conduct socioeconomic surveys on each of the subprojects during the project \nimplementation period. Financial performance monitoring and review, including spot checks, will \nbe conducted from time to time and will be carried out by a consultant50 or by ADB staff.   \n9.  Project Review \n56.  The Government, ADB, and IFAD will jointly review project progress at least twice a year. \nIn addition, they will jointly undertake a comprehensive midterm review within 48 months of loan \neffectiveness  to  assess  (i) implementation  status,  (ii)  progress  of  institutional  actions,  \n(iii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iv)  performance  of  consultants  and  contractors,  \n(iv)  project  outcomes,  (v)  status  of  compliance  with  the  covenants  stipulated  in  the  loan \nagreement, and (vi) the need for any changes in the project scope or schedule to achieve the \nproject impact.    \n                                                 \n50  To be recruited as an individual consultant with specific expertise in financial management procedures of public \nsector departments in Bangladesh and demonstrable experience on development-partner-funded projects. \n ", "16   \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n57.  The Project will improve rural livelihoods through the nationwide financing of investments \nin  participatory  small-scale  water  resources  management,  including  flood  management, \ndrainage  improvement,  water  conservation,  and  command  area  development,  benefiting \n209,000 ha of cultivable land. It will provide direct benefits to 324,400 households in the form of \nintensification of cropping systems, increased culture fishing areas, and greater crop and fish \nyields. Up to 230 subprojects51 will be supported and an additional 150 SSW 1 and SSW 2 \nsubprojects will be provided with technical and institutional support for low-cost, quick-yielding \nbenefits. The Project will generate significant social and economic benefits, including improved \nliving conditions and livelihood opportunities for communities living in flood-risk and drought-\nprone areas. Flood management and drainage improvement subprojects are also expected to \nreduce damage to public and private infrastructure significantly and to contribute to adaptive52 \nmeasures for climate change.  \n58.  During the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA), a comprehensive study was \ncarried out at three subprojects, which were selected to represent53 about 230 small-scale water \nresources schemes throughout the country. The study indicated that these subprojects would \ndeliver  agricultural  benefits  that  met  local  needs  and  priorities.  Environmental,  social,  and \npoverty impacts were expected to be positive. Over 80% of subproject beneficiaries in the three \nsubproject areas were small, marginal, or landless farmers. The estimated poverty impact ratio54 \nwas calculated at 0.65, which is reasonable considering the proportion of land operated by large \nor medium-sized households. \n1.  Financial Analysis \n59.  Crop  and  fisheries  budgets  were  prepared  for  individual  subprojects  and  with-  and \nwithout-project  scenarios  were  compared.  Significant  revenue  from  the  subprojects  will  be \nderived from making the land more productive by reducing submergence during the monsoon \nseason and drought in winter. New crop technologies will help to diversify cropping patterns, \nincrease cropping intensities, and improve yields. The move from local, traditional varieties of \nrice  to  high-yielding  aman  and  boro  rice  significantly  improves  yields.  Improved  cropping \ntechnologies usually result in a need for more labor at a higher rate, generally $4\u2013$5 per day, \nproviding a solid incentive for farm families to invest in the Project. Incremental employment \ngenerated by subproject activities (for the entire Project) is estimated to be 118,000 person-\ndays, of which about 30% will be incremental labor by women. The average incremental net \nagricultural income per household covered by the Project will increase by up to 68%. Small, \nmarginal,  or  landless  households  will  receive  up  to  46%  of  the  financial  benefits  at  full \ndevelopment. Financial internal rates of return (FIRR) estimated for the sample subprojects are \nrobust, ranging from 20% to 27%, reflecting their ability to recover investment and operating \ncosts. The estimated financial benefit\u2013cost55 ratio is 1.4 and the overall project FIRR is 28%. \n                                                 \n51  Subprojects will cover a command area of up to 1,000 ha with an average of 550 ha of benefited area in line with \nexperience to date. \n52  The Project will mainstream adoption of climate-change-sensitive parameters in the design of infrastructure. \n53  A fourth subproject, Tirnai River Water Conservation, was studied during the PPTA but found to fail subproject \nselection criteria of at least 40% of benefitted area being owned by small, marginal, and landless farmers. \n54  The poverty impact ratio is the percentage of the net financial benefits plus the economic surplus flowing to poor \nhouseholds divided by the total net financial benefits and economic surplus. The economic surplus is the NPV of \neconomic net benefits less the NPV of financial net benefits, which are the benefits that result from distortions to \nprices. \n55  Benefit\u2013cost ratio defined as the NPV of incremental benefits divided by NPV of incremental costs at a 12% \ndiscount rate. ", "17 \nProject FIRR is sensitive to a 2-year delay in benefits and less sensitive to production and \nincreased investment and O&M cost. Detailed financial and economic analyses are presented in \nAppendix 14 and Supplementary Appendix K. \n2.  Economic Analysis \n60.  The economic analysis has drawn together project investment costs over an 8-year \nimplementation period, including recurrent costs needed to ensure sustainable benefits, and \ncompares them with the quantified incremental benefits over a 20-year period. Crop production \nbenefits will result mainly from increased yields, the greater area of less-flood-prone land, \nadoption of higher-value crops, more irrigation and improved agricultural practices, as detailed \nabove. Fisheries production, a small part of the benefits, will be maintained. Land use changes \nwill result in an increase in cropping intensities rather than in the cropped area. The current \noverall cropping intensity is 161% and this is expected to increase to 173%, with the boro area \nincreasing from 69% to 76% of the total cropped area. The Project will produce 56% more aman \nrice than currently and increases of 33% in aus and 29% in wheat.  \n61.  In 2008, world cereal markets were volatile, supplies were tight, and demand was rising, \nmaking the market sensitive to shocks. Mean rice prices in 2008 were $650 per ton, compared \nwith prices of $286 in 2005, and $580 in January 2009.56 World Bank price projections show the \nreal price of rice falling back to $404 per ton from 2010, although this is still higher than in 2007. \nThis gives rice a conversion factor ranging from 0.8 to 1.5, depending on the world price \nadopted. Using 2010 prices, the conversion factor is 1.0, which is used in the economic analysis. \nFor the sample subprojects, economic internal rates of return (EIRR) range from 26% to 28%, \ngiving an overall project EIRR of 29%. Switching values indicate that the Project is sensitive to \ndelays in benefits, although it remains economically viable at 14% with a 2-year delay. The \nProject is insensitive to increased investment cost, crop production, or O&M costs. \nB.  Social Dimensions \n1.  Social Benefits \n62.  The Project is expected to make significant contributions to poverty reduction in project \nareas. Direct benefits are expected through increases in household income by incremental net \nincreases in the value of agricultural production, and higher returns to labor involved in this \nincremental production. Additional irrigation is expected to increase production of high-yielding \nrice varieties and additional crops. \n63.  It is estimated that poor households will receive 46% of the total financial benefits at full \ndevelopment.  Of  the  benefits,  32%  will  be  distributed  to  large  and  medium-sized  farmer \nhouseholds, 32% to small farmer households, 13% to marginal farmer households, 15% to \nlandless  households  (sharecroppers  and  tenants),  and  9%  to  labor.  Increases  in  local \nhousehold income and food production improve the nutritional status of the populations in the \nsubproject areas. There will also be opportunities for increased income from culture fishing in \nponds. While the poor own on average only just over half the total arable land, they rent \nadditional land and thus operate up to 80% of the land in subproject areas. It is anticipated that \nthey will benefit from higher labor incomes from increases in crop production. In addition, the \nlabor for the earthworks involved in project construction is likely to be drawn from local poor \nhouseholds. Women\u2019s participation in WMCAs, which includes their one-third membership of \nthe management committee, will provide benefits from employment opportunities created and \nother services provided to WMCAs (see poverty analysis in Supplementary Appendix L). \n                                                 \n56  Thai 5% broken milled.

Summary  and  initial  environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) and environmental assessment and review procedures, as presented in \nSupplementary  Appendix  M,  were  prepared  by  LGED  for  the  three  sample  subprojects  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003),  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements.57 The  sample  subprojects  are \nrepresentative of the typical types and scale of interventions to be made; essentially flood \nmanagement,  drainage,  and  irrigation  systems.  Most  subprojects  will  improve  flood \nmanagement and drainage and reduce effects of early floods during pre-monsoon and post-\nmonsoon water logging. Other subprojects will provide water storage for irrigation during the dry \nseason.  \n65.  Subprojects will be selected and environmental assessment for each undertaken in \naccordance with environmental assessment and review procedures prepared for the Project to \ncomply with ADB Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), \nand the Government\u2019s environmental requirements. Potential adverse impacts58 may include  \n(i) leaching of soil nutrient through over-irrigation; and (ii) soil and water pollution arising from an \nincreased use of agrochemicals. However, these can be satisfactorily mitigated by (i) better \nwater management through better agronomic practices; and (ii) increased adoption of integrated \npest management through intensive agriculture extension services. Subprojects will aim to \nreduce  potential  adverse  impacts  on  subsistence  floodplain  fisheries,  through  better \nmanagement of gate operation and aquaculture. \n66.   The  environmental  management  plan  contains  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nrequirements. Specific components include: (i) providing integrated pest management training \nfor farmers to mitigate the adverse impact of agrochemical use; (ii) sustaining an environmental \nlaboratory  that  has  significantly  strengthened  LGED\u2019s  environmental  management;                   \n(iii) continuing water quality impact monitoring to verify long-term impacts; (iv) carrying out soil \nanalysis and a soil fertility level examination to assist farmers in determining fertilizer mixes and \napplications,  and  to  verify  any  long-term  effect  on  soil  quality  degradation;  (v)  providing \nenvironmental education and training to raise awareness among stakeholders on sustainable \nuse of local resources; and (vi) providing culture fishery training to compensate for partial loss of \nfloodplain fish. \n3.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n67.  The Project has been classified as category B. A resettlement framework and three short \nresettlement plans have been prepared (Appendix 15 and Supplementary Appendix N). The \nresettlement framework provides guidelines on formulation of subproject resettlement plans and \nis based on the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982, the draft \nNational Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation, 2007 and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995). The resettlement framework and resettlement plans will ensure that all affected \npeople\u2014titled and nontitled\u2014will be eligible for appropriate compensation packages under the \nProject. Since this is a highly participatory Project with relatively minor land acquisition per \nsubproject,  a  negotiated  settlement  for  land  acquisition  will  be  preferred  to  formal  land \nacquisition.  For  the  three  sample  subprojects,  the  total  land  to  be  acquired  was  \n2.5 ha with the main impact being the temporary loss of land and access during construction. \nWhere practically feasible, the Project will minimize resettlement impacts by (i) using existing \nlands and conveyance systems to improve flood management; and (ii) aligning channels and \npipes to avoid impacts on structures. \n                                                 \n57  Environment Conservation Act, 1995 and Environmental Conservation Rules, 1997. \n58  An analysis of compounded impacts of a series of subprojects will be undertaken during SPFR and IEEs. ", "19 \n68.  No indigenous people have been identified at the sample subprojects. An indigenous \npeoples  development  framework  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) and is presented as Supplementary Appendix O. The framework will \nguide selection and preparation by IWRMU of additional subprojects under the Project where \nimpacts on indigenous peoples have been identified. It will ensure better distribution of project \nbenefits and promote the development of any indigenous peoples within the project area.  \nC.  Major Risks and Assumptions   \n69.  A risk assessment summary can be found in Supplementary Appendix J. The main risks \nare weak O&M of infrastructure and delays in institutional strengthening\u2014both are addressed in \nthe  design  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  introduce  a  more  broad-based  approach \n(incorporating technical, institutional, financial, and social aspects) to maintenance through an \nO&M strategy for small-scale water resources subprojects. The strategy will require (i) grading \nof subprojects based on institutional and technical performance on the basis of which further \nsupport59 will be prioritized; (ii) increasing maintenance cost-sharing between the Government \nand  WMCAs  depending  on  the  category  of  maintenance  (thereby  reducing  a  dependency \nculture); (iii) calculating maintenance costs by \u201cyardsticks\u201d (unit rates for maintenance) rather \nthan  by  the  percentage  of  development  costs  to  provide  more  realistic  maintenance  cost \nestimates  to  facilitate WMCA  planning  and  contributions;  and  (iv) extending  the  subproject \ndevelopment  process  to  include  stage  5,  during  which  WMCA  and  LGED  will  support \nimplementation of subproject O&M plans and reorient and mentor subproject beneficiaries  and \nLGED field staff for improved O&M. \n70.  Better management at LGED will help subproject implementation, but IWRMU requires \nfurther strengthening. The Project will increase its involvement in subproject development and \ncapacity to offer postconstruction support by supporting (i) a higher profile for IWRMU to reflect \nits central role in SSWR development; (ii) the creation of permanent budgeted positions within \nIWRMU, rather than project-driven staffing; (iii) capacity building of IWRMU; (iv) devolution of \nO&M and M&E responsibilities to LGED regional offices \n71.  Risks  from  natural  disasters  will  also  be  mitigated  to  some  extent  through  flood \nmanagement  and  drainage  improvement.  Climate  change  adaptation  is  to  be  incorporated \nthrough the adoption of appropriate infrastructure design parameters particularly for design of \nembankment heights and widths, culvert openings and drainage and other channel dimensions. \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n72.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and LGED have given the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents.   \n(i)  The Government will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on \ntime.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submission  of  an  annual  budgetary \nappropriation request and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriated funds \nduring each year of project implementation.  \n(ii)  The Government is fully committed to the Project and will ensure that all its \nministries, agencies and divisions involved in the implementation of the Project, \nincluding the local government authorities, give their full cooperation to ensure \nsmooth implementation of the Project.  \n                                                 \n59  Subprojects that do not perform well will also be assisted, depending on their technical or institutional support \nrequirements. \n ", "20   \n(iii)  LGED  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  are  selected  and  implemented  in \naccordance with the subproject selection criteria and procedures agreed between \nADB and LGED and set out in Appendix 6. \n(iv)  The Government and LGED will ensure that there will be no overlap of activities \nor programs between the subprojects funded under this Project and projects \nfunded by other development partners.  \n(v)  The Government and LGED will ensure that prior to the scheduled midterm \nreview, LGED will have included in its revenue budget posts and allocated funds \nto  all  existing  posts in  IWRMU.  Further,  all  LGED  regional  offices  will  have \ncreated and filled posts under the revenue budget for Senior Sociologist and \nAssistant Engineers (Water Resources) and allocated budget for these posts. \nSpecifically, the creation of these posts at the LGED regional offices will be \ncarried out in stages, in accordance with the following schedule: (i) within 12 \nmonths of the effective date, the posts will have been created and budgeted in \nfour LGED regional offices, (ii) within 36 months of the effective date, the posts \nwill have been created and budgeted in another four LGED regional offices, and \n(iii) within 60 months of the effective date, the posts will have been created in and \nbudgeted in two additional LGED regional offices.  \n(vi)  Within 9 months of the effective date, LGED will create a project website to \ndisclose information about various matters on the Project, including procurement. \nWith regard to procurement, the website will include information on the list of \nparticipating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services \nprocured.  \n(vii)  Within 9 months of the effective date, LGED will prepare a grievance redress \nmechanism, acceptable to ADB, and establish a task force at LGED to receive \nand resolve complaints/grievances or act upon reports from stakeholders on \nmisuse of funds and other irregularities, including grievances due to resettlement. \nThe  task  force  will  (i)  make  public  the  existence  of  this  grievance  redress \nmechanism, through a public awareness campaign; (ii) review and address the \ngrievances of project stakeholders, in relation to either the Project, any of the \nservice providers, or any person responsible for carrying out any aspect of the \nProject; and (iii) proactively and constructively respond to them.  \n(viii)  The Government and LGED will ensure that all land and rights-of-way required \nfor  the  Project  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner  and  adequate \ncompensations  have  to  be  paid  to  affected  people  prior  to  any  civil  works \ncontract\u2019s award. Any involuntary resettlement will be carried out in accordance \nwith  the  resettlement  framework  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and \nADB, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). A resettlement plan will \nbe prepared for each subproject involving land acquisition or resettlement and \nwill be submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to any related civil works \ncontract\u2019s award. The resettlement plan, that has been prepared and agreed by \nthe  Government  and  ADB,  for  the  sample  subprojects,  will  be  updated  and \nprovided to ADB for review and approval following detailed design and prior to \ncivil  work  contracts\u2019  award.  The  draft  resettlement  plans  and  draft  updated \nresettlement plans will be disclosed to affected people prior to submission to \nADB for review and approval. ", "21 \n(ix)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  design,  environmental  assessment, \nconstruction,  operation,  implementation  and  environmental  monitoring  of  all \nproject facilities will be carried out in accordance with the initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) and the environmental assessment and review procedures \nagreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  will  comply  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002). Any adverse environmental impacts arising from the construction, \noperation  and  implementation  of  Project  facilities  will  be  minimized  by \nimplementing  the  environmental  mitigation  and  management  measures,  and \nother  recommendations  specified  in  the  IEE.  The  Government  will  ensure \nenvironmental requirements will be incorporated in bidding documents and civil \nworks contracts. \n(x)  Although  the  Project  does  not  envisage  any  adverse  impact  on  indigenous \npeoples, the Government and LGED will ensure that the Project will be prepared \nand implemented in accordance with the indigenous peoples development plan \nthat has been prepared and agreed between the Government and ADB and the \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n(xi)  To ensure that women benefit equally from the Project and interventions avoid \ngender bias, the Government and LGED will ensure that the Project will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998) \nand the gender action plan that has been prepared and agreed between the \nGovernment and ADB.  \n(xii)  The Government and LGED will ensure that the civil works contractors, including \nthe  labor  contracting  societies,  comply  with  all  applicable  labor,  health,  and \nsafety laws and regulations of Bangladesh and, in particular, (a) do not employ \nchild  labor  for  construction  and  maintenance  activities,  and  (b)  provide \nappropriate  facilities  (latrines,  etc.)  for  workers  at  construction  sites.  The \nGovernment will require contractors, including the labor contracting societies, not \nto differentiate wages between men and women for work of equal value. \n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that specific clauses will be included in bidding \ndocuments to ensure adherence to these provisions, and that compliance will be \nstrictly monitored during project implementation. \n(xiv)  Within  6  months  of  the  effective  date,  the  PMO  will  submit  a  detailed \nimplementation monitoring plan to ADB for review and concurrence. The PMO \nwill also conduct socioeconomic surveys on each of the subprojects during the \nproject implementation period.  \n(xv)  Within  9  months  of  the  effective  date,  the  PMO  will  establish  a  gender-\ndisaggregated project performance management system. LGED will ensure that \nthe Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division will conduct an evaluation \nof the project services and will submit its evaluation report to ADB not later than 6 \nmonths after the completion of the Project. \nB.   Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n73.  Prior to loan effectiveness, LGED will have approved and adopted the revised O&M \nstrategy for small-scale water resources subprojects, which has been prepared under the ADB \n ", "22   \nregional  technical  assistance  for  Promoting  Effective  Water  Management  Policies  and \nPractices.60 \nC.

Background and Issues \n1.  Bangladesh is in an alluvial deltaic floodplain in the confluence of three major rivers\u2014the \nGanges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna. These rivers have a catchment area of 1.74 million square \nkilometers (km2) and display substantial seasonal variability of flows, leading to severe flooding, \nsedimentation, and riverbank erosion, causing social hardship for the rural poor. Flooding is \nseasonal and there is often drought in the dry season. Coastal and estuarine areas suffer from \nsaline intrusion and associated environmental degradation as well as periodic cyclones and tidal \nsurges\u2014further exacerbated by climate change impacts. Arsenic contamination of groundwater \nis widespread, resulting in significant health implications. Water management is complicated by \nthe  diverse  livelihood  activities  of  rural  poor,  including agriculture, fisheries,  transportation, \nindustries,  and  water  supply.  Community  participation  for  integrated  and  strategic  water \nresources management is critical for sustaining rural livelihoods and safeguarding poor from \nflooding impacts. \n2.  Bangladesh is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The traditional \ndisaster management model focusing on disaster relief and recovery has done little to redress \nrising levels of risk. Following the devastating floods in 1988 and the cyclone of 1991, the \nGovernment adopted a holistic approach, incorporating hazard identification and mitigation, \ncommunity preparedness, and integrated response efforts. The Ministry of Food and Disaster \nManagement is the apex institution responsible for coordinating national disaster management \ninterventions across all agencies. The National Disaster Management Council, headed by the \nPrime Minister, is the highest forum for the formulation and review of disaster management \npolicies. The Inter-Ministerial Disaster Management Coordination Committee is responsible for \nimplementing disaster management policies and decisions of National Disaster Management \nCouncil.  \n3.  The  National  Water  Resources  Council  is  the  highest  authority  governing  water \nresources management. The key agencies involved in water resources management are: \n(i)  the Water Resources Planning Organization for policy formulation and macro-\nlevel planning and coordination, \n(ii)  the Bangladesh Water Development Board for water resources management of  \nsubprojects exceeding 1,000 hectare (ha) and hydrology monitoring, and \n(iii)  the Local Government Engineering Department responsible for projects below \n1,000 ha. \n4.  Sector institutions have been relatively weak in addressing complex water management \nissues. In the past, planning efforts have tended to focus on building infrastructure to protect \nagriculture  and  urban  land  and  often  overlooked  other  aspects.  Key  issues  include  \n(i) weaknesses in participatory, integrated, and strategic planning; (ii) agencies that lack the \ncapacity to implement water resource interventions while ensuring participatory processes and \nthe quality of outputs; (iii) lack of coordination in delivering necessary support services to \nachieve intended economic benefits in agriculture and fisheries; (iv) deficient operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) because of lack of beneficiary participation and chronic shortages of funds \nfor O&M; and (v) insufficient operational transparency and accountability. \nB.  Supportive Policy and Legislation \n5.  In 1995, the Government launched a major initiative to establish a sound policy, planning, \ninstitutional, and legal framework for the small-scale water resources sector, following flood \naction plan studies and pilot projects in 1990\u20131995, which involved coordinated assistance from \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \n16 external funding agencies, including ADB. The National Water Policy (NWP) was prepared \nand approved in 1999. The NWP established sector goals and guidelines to manage critical \nresources effectively, and adopted the principles of integrated water resources management \nwith an emphasis on (i) stakeholder participation; (ii) strategic planning; (iii) decentralization;  \n(iv)  sound  management  of  social  and  environmental  issues;  (v)  sustainable  O&M  through \nmanagement transfer to water management associations; and (vi) autonomy, transparency, and \naccountability of sector institutions. Guidelines for participatory water management (GPWM),1 \n2001 stipulate arrangements for management transfer and local participation in water resources \nschemes. The development of stakeholder-driven water management associations2 is critical to \nthe institutional development of community participation in water resources schemes and the \nsustainability of such schemes. \n6.  In 2004, the Government prepared and approved the National Water Management Plan \n(NWMP). This provides a framework for short-, medium-, and long-term strategy and priority \nprograms.  Building  on  the  NWP,  the  NWMP  established  programs  covering  (i) institutional \ndevelopment,  (ii)  an  enabling  framework,  and  (iii)  agriculture  and  water  management  for \nimplementation  to  2030.  In  the  short  term,  the  NWMP  focuses  heavily  on  institutional \ndevelopment  and  the  enabling  environment,  along  with  urgent  investment  programs.  The \nNWMP  priorities  include  (i)  promotion  of  rational  management  and  optimal  use  of  water \nresources; and (ii) improvement to the quality of life by ensuring equitable, safe, and reliable \naccess to water for production, health and hygiene. The NWMP is currently being updated \nunder ADB regional technical assistance3 to identify specific actions for improvement, in the \nareas of river and flood management, riverbank erosion management, drainage improvement, \nand  irrigation  facilities.  A  National  Water  Act  or  Code  will  accommodate  the  vision  and \nprovisions of the NWP and facilitate its implementation. \nC.  Donor Harmonization \n7.  One of the alignment indicators of the Paris Declaration4 is to strengthen capacity by \navoiding parallel implementation structures5 and to encourage shared analysis and/or country \nanalytical work, including joint diagnostic reviews. Although harmonization is still in its infancy in \nBangladesh, there have been efforts in the small-scale water resources management subsector \nto establish a coherent approach by the Government and its development partners. The GPWM \nadopted a common subproject development process and there have been cofinancing projects \nsuch  as  the  Participatory  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Sector  Project.  Although  the \nGovernment  has  yet  to  finalize  its  harmonization  plan,  there  have  been  encouraging \ndevelopments,  such  as  reforms  to  the  procurement  system,  the  enactment  of  the  Public \nProcurement Act, 2006, and efforts to reform the public financial management system.6   \n                                                 \n1  Guidelines were formulated jointly by the Ministry of Water Resources and the Local Government Division of the \nMinistry of Local Government Rural Development and Cooperatives. \n2  For  small-scale  water  resources  management,  stakeholder  organizations  registered  as  water  management \ncooperative associations (WMCAs) under the Cooperatives Act, 2001. \n3  ADB. 2006.

Manila (TA 6351-REG). \n4  The Paris Declaration of 2005 lays down a practical, action-oriented road map to improve the quality of aid and its \nimpact on development.  The 56 partnership commitments are organized around the five key principles: ownership, \nalignment, harmonization, managing for results, and mutual accountability.

Local Government Engineering Department  \n8.  LGED has carried out small-scale water resources (SSWR) development including two \nADB-financed projects.7 As the Executing Agency for these projects, it has demonstrated an \nability  to  operate  community-based,  participatory,  water  resources  management  schemes \neffectively. With the majority of its staff based at district and upazila levels and significantly \ndecentralized  decision  making,  LGED  is  well  placed  to  support  the  development  of  water \nmanagement cooperative associations (WMCA). It demonstrated this in implementing the first \nand second Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Projects (SSW 1 and SSW 2).  \n9.  LGED established an Integrated Water Resources Management Unit (IWRMU) in early \n2003.  The  unit  is  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  district  water  resources  assessments,  \n(ii) monitoring completed projects and ensuring that they are being operated and maintained, \nand (iii) providing maintenance support and planning and design for new water resources \nprojects. Recently, IWRMU's performance has stagnated because of (i) career insecurity and \nlimited prospects for staff who are not in budgeted posts; (ii) lack of clarity in the roles and \nresponsibilities of IWRMU and project management offices; and (iii) limited incentives for staff. \nThe unit has yet to assume a leading role or to contribute meaningfully to ensuring the long-term \nsustainability of investments. \n10.  Enhancing rural incomes through decentralized and community-managed SSWR has \nbeen effective in reducing rural poverty.8 The experience of SSW 1 and SSW 2 indicates that  \n(i) increasing the productivity and sustainability of WMCAs requires continued provision of \nsupport  services,  better  interagency  coordination,  and  stronger  monitoring  and  evaluation \nprocesses; (ii) participatory development with full beneficiary engagement is required at critical \nstages such as O&M; and (iii) support for IWRMU is pivotal to ensuring the WMCAs\u2019 overall \nsustainability.  \nE.  Investment Strategy \n11.  In  2002,  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  called  on  all  countries  to \ndevelop integrated water resources management and water efficiency plans by the end of 2005. \nIn  Bangladesh,  investment  priorities  include  improving  irrigation  and  reducing  drainage \ncongestion, and mitigating drought by re-excavating canals and watercourses. The National \nStrategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction II (2009\u20132011) recognized the interface between \nwater resources management and poverty. Specific areas to be further strengthened include the \nfollowing. \n(i)  Improving  the  policy,  planning,  and  legal  framework.  NWP  and  NWMP \nprovide an effective framework for integrated water resources management and \nsustainable service delivery. Progressive improvements and regular reviews of \nsector operations are needed.    \n(ii)  Integrating water resources management and water conservation. Issues \ninclude (a) establishing an institutional framework for integrated water resources \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1995.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nContribution of the Small-Scale Water Resource Development subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh:  \nThe National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (NSAPR) II, 2009\u20132011 identified the interface between \nwater resources management and poverty. It notes the impact of global climate change and identifies water \nresources development and management as a critical sector for achieving pro-poor economic growth and food \nsecurity through agricultural development. The NSAPR II emphasized managing demand and supply during dry \nseason, reducing disasters during wet season, carrying out operation and maintenance of infrastructure, building \nadditional irrigation facilities, establishing water pricing principles, incorporating environmental considerations, and \ncarrying out institutional capacity development for water management. It also stressed the creation of income-\ngeneration opportunities for the poor through water resources management.   \nThe Project follows two similar projects, the first and second Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector \nProjects (SSW 1 and SSW 2) and is consistent with NSAPR II. Effect monitoring and evaluation of those projects \nrevealed significant incremental agriculture production, which is critical to the livelihoods of the poor and to mitigate \nthe current food crisis. Surveys and field visits at sample subproject sites indicated that the Project is expected to \ngenerate substantial temporary employment in construction and long-term employment associated with the increase \nin agricultural and fisheries production. The Project will attempt to address the poverty of beneficiaries living and \nfarming in subproject areas by small-scale water resource development that will provide (i) drainage, (ii) flood \nmanagement, (iii) water conservation, (iv) command area development, and (v) institutional development. The main \nemployment window for the rural poor will be in seasonal construction and as sharecroppers.  \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Bangladesh, 2006\u20132010, identified expansion of access to irrigation \nand associated flood protection through command area and small-scale water resource management as a key \nstrategy. The CSP also emphasized building country capacity and ensuring community participation (especially by \nthe disadvantaged and women) in designing and implementing projects. The Project is consistent with the CSP. \nWater management cooperative associations (WMCA) will be formed in each subproject area by the beneficiaries \nand about one-third of the members of WMCAs will be women. The WMCAs will eventually be responsible for \noperation and maintenance of the infrastructure to ensure that project benefits are sustainable. The WMCAs will bring \nall types of beneficiaries under a single umbrella, ensure participation of various groups, and ensure benefits accrue \nto these groups, especially the poor and vulnerable. The WMCA will also be oriented and trained on operation and \nmaintenance of the infrastructure. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe household survey of sample subprojects indicated that the majority of the land is owned by small, marginal and \nfunctionally landless (<1 ha) households. The survey found that 65% of household income came from agricultural \nproduction, 10% from wages and salaries; 4% from small businesses; 7% from livestock and poultry; 4% from \nremittances from abroad; and 10% from other sources. Income from agricultural production was by far the most \nimportant within the subproject areas, followed by income from wages and salaries. Most wage and salary earners \ncame from the functionally landless and marginal categories of household and worked in agriculture. The Project will \nstudy the economic benefits of each subproject and estimate productivity, employment and income opportunities for \nthe landless and marginal farmers. The feasibility studies will also estimate additional agricultural and fisheries \nproduction and potential person-days of employment for the poor to ensure that the poor benefit.  \nDesign Features \nThe project will directly benefit the poor by creating employment opportunities in the construction by labor contracting \nsocieties and under the contractors. About 50% of all earthworks will be carried out through labor contracting \nsocieties formed by the landless and hardcore poor. Work will also be created for agricultural laborers as a result of \nincreased coverage and additional cropping. The WMCA will include at least 40% of its members from among the \npoor and landless. Each WMCA will develop a poverty reduction plan, which will identify and implement activities that \nwill include skills training and microfinance operation contributing toward poverty reduction.  \nIn support of project poverty reduction initiatives, the  poverty reduction plan (PRP) process will: (i) be conducted for \nWMCAs in all subprojects; (ii) complement the livelihood activities of the gender action plan (GAP) to reduce overlap \nand duplication, and to reduce management requirements; (iii) support non-crop livelihoods for women from poor \nhouseholds, current and former ex-labor contracting society members, and non-fishing livelihoods for fishers who \nhave been adversely affected by subproject infrastructure; and (iv) have monitoring indicators incorporated into the \n ", "  Appendix 8  45 \nProject monitoring and evaluation system to assist with the verification of poverty reduction achievements and act as \na double check on implementing agencies.     \nAs a first stage, WMCA leaders will be trained in the PRP process and workshops held at the subproject level. Two \ncommunity facilitators (male and female) will be posted to each subproject. They will support the process of PRP \nformulation, including the listing of poor households. Implementation of PRP initiatives will involve agreements with \nother government agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and other service providers.  \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending - Not applicable. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nInitially, the Project will reduce the incidence of floods and create dry season irrigation facilities through water \nconservation  schemes.  Participatory  and  sustainable  small-scale  water  resource  management  will  improve \nagricultural and fisheries production, benefiting the entire community in the subproject area. The farmers (large, \nsmall, medium, and marginal) will directly benefit from the increased productivity and increased agricultural coverage \nas a result of reduced water logging and flooding as well as increased irrigation opportunities. Fisheries production \nwill increase because of the development of water control and management structures. The potential benefits of poor \nand vulnerable men and women will be both direct and indirect and will include: (i) direct employment opportunities \ncreated  under  the  Project  for  construction  of  water  management  infrastructure;  (ii) increased  employment \nopportunities in the agricultural and fisheries sectors due to incremental production; and (iii) productive skills and \npossible microfinance as members of WMCAs as per the poverty reduction plan. An empowerment process will begin \nbecause of the participation of the poor and vulnerable in the decision making process of the WMCAs.  \n1.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nThe beneficiaries of the catchments area of each subproject suffer either from water logging, flooding, drought or \nfrom lack of irrigation opportunities. The crop intensity is low and often crops are damaged. The beneficiaries need \nsupport to make the best use of their land and other assets free from flooding and drought. They need flood \nmanagement, water conservation, drainage, command area development, jobs, access to capital and productive \nskills for livelihood support. The WMCAs will provide a platform to increase the participation of the poor and \nvulnerable in community development decisions. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation.  \nThe Project has been designed through extensive consultation with all stakeholders. The Ministry of Finance, Ministry \nof Planning, Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives were consulted. The executing \nagency Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), Department of Cooperatives (DOC), Department of \nAgricultural Extension (DAE), Department of Fisheries (DOF), and the Department of Environment were part of the \ndesign. The beneficiaries of SSW 1 and SSW 2 and selected subproject areas  were extensively consulted.  \nHousehold survey and focus group discussions were undertaken in selected subproject areas. \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  Information sharing          Consultation            Collaborative decision making       Empowerment  \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nKey features and resources provided to implement the C&P plan (including budget, consultant input, etc.). \nThe entire project design is based on participatory development principles ensuring beneficiary participation at all \nstages of the subproject cycle. The Project is a sector project and involves extensive consultation and participation \nwhile selecting and implementing the subprojects. At the subproject level, the stakeholders include landowners; large, \nsmall and marginal farmers; landless people; and local governments. Local NGOs will also have a stake in the \nproject. Agencies of the Government, including DAE, DOF, and DOC will be involved to provide services to the \nWMCAs and the project beneficiaries. Different types of consultation and participation will be undertaken, including \ncommunity  mobilization.  Participatory  rural  appraisal  (PRA)  techniques  will  be  applied  to  identify  subprojects. \nConsultation and workshops will be required for social, gender, and environmental assessments. Based on the \nlessons from the existing participation methods in the small-scale water development sector, an effective community \nmobilization strategy will be followed during the implementation phase.  \nThe participatory development component of the Project will improve beneficiary participation in small-scale water \nresource development by the establishment and strengthening of WMCAs.  Continued refinement of critical aspects \nof  the  participatory  process  and  value  addition  to  performing  WMCAs  through  structural  and  nonstructural \nintervention  will  be  ensured.  Project  support  to  WMCAs  will  consist  of  management  training  for  the  elected \nmanagement committees, as well as for the general membership. Training content will take into account the lessons \nfrom SSW 2, paying particular attention to WMCA performance. WMCA and labor contracting society training events \nwill include legal empowerment issues following the recommendations of the ADB regional TA projecta on legal \nempowerment. While funding for WMCA training is a government responsibility, LGED recognizes that available \n ", "46  Appendix 8 \nfunds are insufficient to meet WMCA training needs.b The Project will supplement government funding of WMCA \ntraining to a defined and appropriate level as per the project capacity development plan. \nSome of the key factors supporting WMCA performance include strong leadership and appropriate levels of support \nfrom partner agencies. The capacity development plan includes capacity development activities for partner agencies \nlike the Department of Environment, DOC, and DOF. A study of factors determining the success or failure of WMCAs \nwill be undertaken during the first year of the Project to suggest further refinement of the participatory methodologies. \nThe cost of this study will be included in the project. A technical assistance component for DOC will also contribute \ntoward this end. Three basic principles underlie the project approach to water resource management comprise: \n(i)  subprojects must be identified by local people, and initially processed through their elected representatives in the \nunion parishad; \n(ii)  local people, beneficiaries as well as project-affected people, must be involved in all stages of subproject \ndevelopment; and  \n(iii)  the overall approach is a combination of two parallel but interrelated processes, one that addresses institutional \nmatters and the other that addresses technical matters. \nResources have been provided for participatory development process, capacity development, male and female \ncommunity assistants and consultants.   \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. \n(i)  Water management and infrastructure are considered to be the domain of men and the participation of and \nbenefits for women from this sector are not well understood. Strong community mobilization will be required. \n(ii)  Women\u2019s capacity to play an effective role in WMCAs needs to be developed. Generally, women do not own \nagricultural land and their participation in WMCAs needs to be promoted through mass awareness-raising \nactivities. Although they are involved in agricultural and fisheries activities, their participation is not valued.   \n(iii)  The women from landless families and households headed by women are the poorest and the importance of \nwater management as a facilitating factor for their livelihoods is yet to be understood. They have little access to \nsocial protection and livelihood support measures. They will require skills development and other support to \nimprove their livelihoods. \n(iv)  Women bear the burden of poverty in the family and they are the ones hard hit during the flooding and other \ncalamities. They need support to overcome the impact of flooding and droughts. \n(v)  The EA\u2019s capacity to promote an inclusive participatory process and facilitate empowerment of women is limited \nand needs strengthening. \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan      Other actions/measures          No action/measure \nWomen\u2019s active participation in WMCAs will be promoted by the clarification of organizational responsibilities. The \nProject will take necessary measures to promote at least one-third membership of women in WMCAs and its \ncommittees. Union parishad members, including women members, will be trained and encouraged to promote WMCA \norganization and to promote good relationships between the union parishad and the WMCA. The project GAP aims to \nensure  women\u2019s  participation  at  all  stages  of  the  project  cycle,  including  subproject  preparation,  and  their \nparticipation is encouraged during construction (including earthworks) and postconstruction activities, including tree \nplanting, care taking and operation and maintenance (O&M). The participation of poor women, including women \nheads of households and destitute women, will be particularly encouraged. The Project will ensure that women \nbenefit from the employment opportunities created and other services provided to the WMCAs. The Project will follow \nthe LGED's gender equality strategy and action plan. Capacity development activities of the Project include: \n(i)  increasing awareness and knowledge of the gender implications of community and participatory development \namong all partners and field staff; \n(ii)  assisting all project-related activities to become more efficient in promoting gender equality; \n(iii)  developing capacity of women to play an effective role in WMCA decision making; \n(iv)  ensuring equal wages for equal work for both women and men and follow core labor standards in application of \nproject policy for LCS; \n(v)  improving the socioeconomic situation for women and men by providing practical training (agriculture, home \ngardening, fisheries, etc.), and strategic training, gender awareness and leadership; and \n(vi)  ensuring collection of gender-disaggregated data and appropriate analysis for management decision making.  \nAccording to the LGED gender equality strategy and action plan, human and organizational resources will be made \nincreasingly available within LGED to meet the growing demand and to fill knowledge and skill gaps. The sectoral \naction plan activities focus on achieving a consistent and coordinated approach to mainstreaming gender equity \nactivities in the different projects in water sector. The field level action plan covers the different components of the \n ", "  Appendix 8  47 \nsector programs, acting as a guide for activities at the field level, which will be consistently followed.  \nA social and gender and development section will be established within the Integrated Water Resource Management \nUnit (IWRMU) of LGED, whose responsibilities include the management, oversight and monitoring of the GAP. A \nnational gender specialist will be provided for 88 months of the 96-month project duration. \nIII.  SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \nInvoluntary  Limited  Very limited resettlement impacts are    Full Plan \nResettlement  anticipated in implementing subprojects. Most    Short Plan \nof the subprojects will be on government land,    Resettlement \nexisting rights of way, or lands owned by the  Framework \nlocal government.  The Project will set up    No Action \ncriteria in order to exclude subprojects with \nmajor resettlement impacts in consultation with \nthe EA. A resettlement framework and sample \nsubproject short resettlement plans were \nprepared and will be used by the Project where \nresettlement impacts arise.  No relocation is \nenvisaged but compensation, if any, will be \npaid according to the framework.  \nIndigenous  Limited  Some indigenous people live in some districts,     Plan \nPeoples  especially those bordering India and Myanmar.      Other Action \n  No major impacts on them are anticipated.    Indigenous Peoples \nSince the subprojects are still to be identified,  Framework \nthe Project is classified as category B. The     No Action \nfeasibility studies will investigate and prepare \nindigenous peoples\u2019 plans, if necessary. If \nindigenous people are adversely affected by \nsubprojects, they will be compensated \naccording to the resettlement framework.  \nLabor  Significantly  The project will significantly increase     Plan \n Employment   positive  employment opportunities for the poor directly     Other Action \nopportunities  through labor contracting societies (50% of all     No Action \n Labor  earthworks) and under contractors. Additional \nretrenchment  labor opportunities will be created in fisheries \n Core labor  and agriculture for both women and men due to \nstandards  production increases and through self-\nemployment support provided by the WMCAs. \nAffordability  No impact  The Project will facilitate access by the poor to     Action \nbenefits. There is no significant issue of     No Action \naffordability. The Government will share the \nproject cost and beneficiary contribution will be \nensured as per current practice under SSW 2.  \nOther Risks  Limited  Natural calamities such as flooding and river   \nand/or  erosion may damage construction or     Plan \nVulnerabilities  completed subprojects.

Cofinancing  and  disbursement.  To  avoid  reimbursing  and  replenishing  and/or \nliquidating  numerous  district  and  subdistrict  project  accounts  and  to  limit  administrative \ndifficulties and delays in allocating percentage shares to each cofinancier against each bill, the \nproposed design will adopt exclusive subproject financing by cofinancier (for project output 3). \nThis  will  allow  succinct  packaging  (including  civil  works,  training,  mitigation  activities  and \nadministration  costs)  per  subproject  to  be  reconciled  against  a  single  project  account.1 \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) funding of project output 3 will be 40% of \ncomponent  costs  and  ADB  financing  will  be  60%  of  the  component  costs  of  exclusive \nsubprojects. For project output 2, ADB and IFAD will finance capacity development activities on \na  60%  (ADB)  and  40%  (IFAD)  financing  share.  Overall  project  administration  will  be  the \nresponsibility of ADB, irrespective of the fact that some subprojects will be entirely financed by \nIFAD.  \n2.  From ADB to the imprest account. ADB funds will be channeled through an imprest \naccount dedicated to the Project at Bangladesh Bank. The ADB funds will be allocated in the \nannual development program (ADP), based on the annual budget estimates prepared by the \nproject management office (PMO) for the Project. The project director will be the authorized \nsignatory  for  withdrawing  ADB  funds  from  the  imprest  account  and  will  process  all  other \ndisbursement  requests  to  ADB,  including  requests  for  direct  payment  to  contractors  and \nreimbursement. The imprest account will be replenished according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n3.  From IFAD to the imprest account. For the disbursement of IFAD loan funds, the \nGovernment will establish another imprest account at Bangladesh Bank, which will be operated \nby the PMO. The project director will be the authorized signatory. ADB will first review and \nendorse all invoices from the PMO for financing under IFAD loan. Funds will be routed directly \nfrom IFAD to the imprest account based on the advice from ADB. \n4.  Project operating account. Three separate project operating accounts (POAs) will be \nestablished for ADB and IFAD at a commercial bank acceptable to the Government and ADB. \nThe project director will be the authorized signatory. The funds will be transferred from imprest \naccounts to POAs as and when required and according to expenditure needs. The POAs will be \nused  to  make  payments  for  the  equipment  and  administration  cost of  the  PMO  and  fund \ntransfers to regional and district levels will be made through the POAs.   \n5.  For payments from a POA to national consultants and suppliers, consultants will submit \nto PMO (i) a letter of payment request; (ii) invoices and/or receipts; and (iii) a progress report, as \nspecified in the contract. Suppliers of equipment will submit invoices to the PMO. Payments to \nconsultants and suppliers will be arranged by the PMO. \n6.  Project accounts at district level. Each participating district will open a project account \nseparately for ADB and IFAD, in a current account at a commercial bank immediately after loan \neffectiveness. The funds in the POAs will be transferred to project accounts to make payments \nfor civil works, community assistants, and field facilitators. \n7.  To replenish the project accounts, the LGED upazila will submit to the PMO (i) a letter of \nrequest for replenishment, (ii) a bank statement to show the account amount and a bank \nreconciliation, (iii) invoices and/or receipts, (iv) evidence of payment, and (v) certificates for \nprogress achievements (civil works). All signed contracts and confirmed purchase orders should \nbe  submitted  to  the  PMO  in  advance  of  replenishment  requests.  The  project  director  will \napprove the replenishment request and transfer funds to the project accounts from POAs.

The Borrower introduced a revised regulatory framework for public procurement through \nthe adoption of the Public Procurement Act, 2006 (\"PPA 2006\") and the Public Procurement \nRules, 2008 (\"PPR 2008\"). Pending the publication of an official English version of PPR 2008, \nADB  has  not  yet  had  the  opportunity  to  review,  and  therefore  it  is  not  yet  clear,  which \nclarifications and modifications will be required to the PPR 2008 for NCB procurement to ensure \ncompliance with the provisions of ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time). Pending such review and any necessary clarification or modifications to PPR 2008, any \nNCB  procurement  under  the  Project  will  require  prior  review  by  ADB  in  accordance  with \nAppendix 1 of ADB's Procurement Guidelines. \n ", "  Appendix 14  59 \nSUMMARY FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Approach and Methodology \n1.  The basic assumptions used for economic analysis include the following: (i) the world \nprice numeraire was used; (ii) base costs and benefits are in June 2008 terms with conversion \nfactors to adopt domestic prices to international prices; (iii) Bangladesh taka (Tk) was the unit of \naccount (the exchange rate used is for 2008, when Tk68 = $1); (iv) a standard conversion factor \nof 0.91 and a shadow wage rate of 0.9 for unskilled labor were used; (v) economic values of \nmajor tradable commodities were based on border parity pricing and standard methods of \nderiving farmgate output and input prices were applied; and (vi) transfer payments such as \ntaxes and subsidies were excluded in the calculation of economic values. \n2.  For  each  of  the  three  sample  subprojects,1 estimates  of  cropping  patterns  and \ntechnologies in the with-Project and without-Project scenarios were based on expected changes \nin land use due to flood protection and/or increased availability of water for crops. Per hectare \ncosts of production and returns for relevant crops were calculated and translated into economic \nvalues.  For  the  subprojects\u2019  net  benefited  area,  the  incremental  value  of  production  was \ncalculated. Some subprojects (for example Goshinga) may be expected to have an effect upon \ncapture  fisheries.  Operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  were  estimated  at  6%  of \nconstruction costs for earthworks and 0.5% of the cost of structures.2 Benefits and costs are \nexpressed as cash flow streams over an expected 20 years of subproject life from which \neconomic and financial internal rates of return (EIRR and FIRR) are calculated. Sensitivity \nanalyses were performed by assuming various scenarios relating to particular risk factors such \nas shortened project life due to poor O&M, delays in project benefits, increased construction \ncosts,  decreased  benefits,  and  rice  price  fluctuation.  Agricultural  production  benefits  are \ngenerally assumed to accrue to landowners and operators. Household income is expected to \nincrease  from  incremental  labor  utilization  with  the  subprojects.  Improved  water  resource \nregimes allow farmers to more fully adopt technology for high-yield varieties and labor inputs \ncan be expected to rise to some extent. In local financial terms this increase in labor income can \nadd substantially to household income, particularly that of the poor.  \nB.  Results \n1.  Financial Analysis \n3.  In Goshinga subproject, 90% of all households were categorized as small, marginal, or \nlandless. Their holding size averaged 0.29 ha (the average size for all households was 0.47 ha) \nand they were predominantly rainfed. Small, marginal households will enjoy significant net \nincremental income gains. Returns to labor for high-yield boro rice will increase by 436% in \ncropped areas, and for non-rice crops they will increase by 16%\u201357%. In Purba Sarail-Madai, \n96% of all households were categorized as small, marginal or landless and are reliant on rainfed \ncropping land without drainage. Paddy rice production will rise from 3,675 tons to 4,339 tons at \nfull development, an increase of 18%. Production of wheat and of other crops (especially \nvegetables and potatoes) will increase considerably. Fishery output will increase by three times, \ndue  to  increased  yields.  In  Kanakdia,  84%  of  all  households  were  categorized  as  small, \nmarginal or landless. Paddy rice production will rise from 2,577 tons to 3,724 tons at full \ndevelopment, an increase of 45% (Table A14.1). Production of other crops will also increase \n                                                 \n1  (i) Goshinga (Ghazipur district) command area development; (ii) Purba Sarail-Madai (Joypurhat district) drainage \nsubproject; and (iii) Kanakdia (Patukhali district) flood management and drainage improvement subproject. \n2  Additional insight to subproject O&M  was provided by a supplementary 2\u2013month  study (during the project \npreparation technical assistance) funded by the Water Financing Partnership Facility, Water Expert Services Pool, \nand completed in September 2008. \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nconsiderably and fishery output will increase by 12 times greater, because of the increase in \npond fisheries. \n  2.  Economic Analysis \n4.  Economic  benefits  were  calculated  from  the  incremental  value  of  crop  production \ngenerated  by  the  subproject,  net  of  production  cost  at  economic  input  and  output  prices. \nLivestock benefits were included by valuing fodder and crop residues. Fishery benefits were \nmodeled directly for canal, flood, and fish pond activities but were small compared with crop \nbenefits (about 10% of total benefits). Project benefits excluded from the analysis included \nimproved  navigation  in  drainage  canals,  environmental  and  health  benefits  from  improved \nnutrition, and better water management and drainage. The area of cereal crops grown will \nremain more or less constant at around 143,000 ha but cropping intensity will increase because \nof land use changes and flood management, leading to an anticipated overall increase of 34% \nin paddy rice production. Current overall cropping intensity is 161% and this is expected to \nincrease to 173% with the boro area increasing from 69% to 76% of total cropped area.  \n5.  Paddy rice production dominates agricultural production and rice is a major food product. \nBangladesh  imports  rice  when  export  item  harvests  are  poor  due to  climatic events.  This \nsituation is expected to continue in the medium term. No problem is envisaged in marketing the \nincreased rice production. Incremental project rice production has been valued on the basis of \nits farm gate equivalent price. The estimated export parity farm gate price for paddy was Tk18 \nper kilogram (kg) in January 2009 (using a world price of $580 per ton), and the import parity \nprice was Tk23 per kg. This compares with a support price of Tk17.5 per kg. Domestic paddy \nrice prices usually lie somewhere between export and import parity levels as most rice is used \ndomestically and only a small proportion is traded. Mean rice prices in 2008 were $650 per ton, \ncompared with $286 in 2005, and $580 in January 2009.3 World Bank price projections show \nthe real price of rice falling back to $404 per ton from 2010, but this will still be higher than 2007 \nlevels. This gives rice a conversion factor ranging from 0.8 to 1.5, depending on the world price \nadopted. Using 2010 price,s the conversion factor is 1.0, and this was used in the economic \nanalysis.  \n6.  Other grains were a minor part of the market. Bangladesh is currently a net importer of \nwheat. Long-term wheat prices are expected to fall below 2007 values, but wheat prices have \nbeen relatively stable, even in 2008. Calculated wheat prices were based on world prices for \nwheat in 2010 at import parity. The farm gate price was Tk23.3 per kg, compared with the \nsupport price of Tk29.1 per kg, giving a conversion factor of 0.8. \n7.  Prices of inputs, especially fertilizer, rose dramatically in the first 6 months of 2008. \nFertilizer prices are being driven by rising demand associated with biofuel production, and by \nthe rising price of oil. In Bangladesh, the cost of production of urea is reported to be Tk50,000 \nper ton ($735), while the Government has set the farm gate price (June 2008), at Tk12,000 per \nton ($176). Thus, the subsidy on urea is Tk38,000 per ton or 76% of production costs. Prices in \n2008 were well above the long-term trend line, but are currently declining. Prices reported by \nthe World Bank commodity price series were used. Future prices were based on the most \nrecent available price forecast (November 2008). The domestic financial price of urea is very \nlow. Even at 2007 prices, a conversion factor of 2.5 is required, and a conversion factor of 3.5 is \nrequired if mean 2008 world prices are used. The detailed economic and financial analysis in \nSupplementary Appendix K shows that forecast urea world prices are expected to fall below \n2007 prices in real terms, while it is likely that large domestic subsidies will be maintained. A \nlong-term conversion factor based on forecast 2010 prices, of 2.2, looks most realistic, and was \nused for the analysis. \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2009.

The economic and financial analyses of the Project indicate an EIRR of 29% and an \nFIRR  of  28%.  The  Project  is  economically  and  financially  viable  although  sensitive  to \ndownwards movements in rice prices and yields (Table A14.1).

A high \nswitching value indicates that the project is relatively insensitive to the tested parameter. \nc The sensitivity indicator is based on the ratio of the base EIRR and the tested change EIRR, \ndivided by the percentage change in the tested parameter. If the EIRR changes at the same \nratio as the change in the tested parameter, the sensitivity indicator is 1. For example if the \nbase EIRR is 20% and the tested parameter is changed by 10%, a resulting change in the EIRR \nof 2% (i.e., 10% of the EIRR) would give an sensitivity indicator of 1. A sensitivity indicator of \nless than 1 indicates the EIRR is relatively insensitive to the parameter. The higher the \nsensitivity indicator the more sensitive the project is to the tested parameter. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n9.  Economic analysis was also undertaken at three existing subprojects from the first and \nsecond  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development  Sector  Projects  (SSW  1  and  SSW  2) \nrequiring performance enhancement. It was assumed that previous investments were sunk \ncosts,  hence  incremental  benefits  were  attributable  to  the  performance  enhancement \ninvestment only. The results of these analyses (Table A14.2) indicate that the investments were \nhighly economically and financially viable and will reap rapid benefits. \nTable A14.2: SSW 1 and SSW 2 Subproject Economic and Financial Analysis \nArea  Cost  EIRR  FIRR \nSite Name  Type  (ha)  (Tk million)  (%)  (%) \nBinoykathi  Drainage improvement  700  0.34  54  44 \nBrazamul  Water conservation  504  8.86  40  30 \nBanagram \nChandrapara  Flood management   386  0.29  100  79 \nSonatala  Flood management  511  3.61  59  49 \nand water conservation \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, SSW = Small-Scale Water \nResources Development Sector Project. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10.  Based on project household survey data, the area operated (rather than owned) was \n38% for large and medium-sized farm households, with 18% operated by landless households \nthrough rental and sharecropping arrangements. Over 90% of landowners operated their land, \n ", "62  Appendix 14 \nand may also rent or sharecrop land, especially if they are marginal farmers. About 60% of \nlandless households work in farming. \n11.  Sharecropping  and  land  rental  is  common,  especially  for  large  and  medium-sized \nfarmers (over 1 hectare of land). Even small and marginal farmers use sharecroppers, as the \nlandowners  may  be  absent,  unable  to  work,  and/or  in  other  paid  employment.  Rented  or \nsharecropped land was 18% of the project area. Most sharecropping is undertaken by landless \nand marginal households. Sharecropping is applied to the benefits distribution as part of the \npoverty analysis presented in detail in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n12.  The  distribution  of  benefits  among  various  subproject  beneficiary  groups  was  also \nanalyzed. The distribution model indicated that poor households will receive 46% of the total \nfinancial benefits at full development. Benefits will be distributed as follows: 32% to large or \nmedium  farmer  households,  32%  to  small  farmer  households,  13%  to  marginal  farmer \nhouseholds,  15%  to  landless  households  (sharecroppers  and  tenants),  and  9%  to  labor. \n ", "  Appendix 15  63   \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK AND SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLANS \n \nA.  Introduction  \n1.  This  appendix  summarizes  the  project  resettlement  framework  and  three  sample \nsubproject short resettlement plans. The original resettlement framework and resettlement plans \nare in Supplementary Appendix N.  \n2.  The resettlement framework guides the formulation of subproject resettlement plans. \nConsidering the high level of beneficiary participation in the Project and the relatively minor land \nacquisition per subproject, a negotiated settlement for land acquisition is preferred to a formal \nland acquisition process. Compensation will be paid for all land acquired for the Project based \non its replacement cost. The Government and the Local Government Engineering Department \n(LGED) as the Executing Agency will ensure open negotiations with affected peoples and will \nengage an independent external party to document, validate, and record the process. The \ndocumentation will be shared with ADB. \n3.  The basis principle enshrined in the resettlement framework is that everyone affected by \nthe Project\u2014titled and non-titled\u2014is eligible for an appropriate compensation package. The key \ncompensation principles are (i) land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) will be avoided or at \nleast minimized; (ii) compensation paid on the basis of replacement cost will guarantee at least \nthe  maintenance  of  the  affected  family\u2019s  living  standards  before  the  Project;  (iii)  affected \nhouseholds  will  be  fully  informed  and  consulted  on  the  Project,  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation packages and options; (iv) LAR provisions will apply equally to women and men; \n(v) particular attention will be paid to vulnerable groups and households headed by women in \nproviding compensation and resettlement assistance and efforts will be made to improve their \nhousehold income; (vi) LAR will be conceived and executed as an integral part of the project \nand LAR budgets will be included in project costs; and (vii) no work contract will be awarded \nunder  any  subproject  until  compensation  packages  are  provided  to  affected  people.  The \nentitlements of various categories of affected people are listed in the entitlement matrix in \nSupplementary Appendix N.  \n4.  The Integrated Water Resources Management Unit (IWRMU) of LGED will work with the \nproject  implementation  consultants  (PIC)  to  prepare  resettlement  plans  for  candidate \nsubprojects.  LGED  will  appoint  a  chief  resettlement  officer  (CRO)  who  will  work  with  the \nsafeguards officer of the Environment and Safeguards Section (ESS) to supervise resettlement \nplan implementation and monitoring. The water management cooperative association (WMCA)1 \nis central to the subproject development process.  \n5.  Consultation and communication with affected peoples and other stakeholders during \nthe subproject preparation will be done by the ESS and PIC. The resettlement framework will be \ndisclosed to all affected peoples in the Bangla language. Public disclosure will also be made \nthrough posting on ADB and LGED websites, with disclosure of resettlement information in the \nform of brochures written in Bangla. A grievance review committee will be formed at the union \nlevel. LGED\u2019s community organizer, who will be the resettlement coordinator at the upazila \nengineer\u2019s office, will chair the committee. Members will include representatives of affected \npeople,  including  women,  and  representatives  of  the  water  management  cooperative \nassociations (WMCA) and union parishads. \n6.  ESS will establish a monitoring system involving the CRO, district and upazila officers of \nLGED  and  PIC  for  collecting,  analyzing  and  preparing  quarterly  progress  reports  on  the \n                                                 \n1  WMCA is a registered cooperative which is fully inclusive, community-based organization is a member-based, \nmember-owned and member-managed institution. \n ", "64  Appendix 15 \nprogress of resettlement plan implementation. Annual reporting and midterm review will identify \nany action needed to improve resettlement performance.  \n7.  The land acquisition and resettlement budget will include all costs for acquisition of \nassets and costs associated with involuntary resettlement. The PIC will assess losses and \ndisturbances and determine their compensation at market value to prepare a land acquisition \nand resettlement cost estimate, including contingencies.
