An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nundertaken.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was \ncirculated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) and uploaded on the ADB website on 1 June 2007. \n \nThe  Project  will  demonstrate  an  innovative  integrated  ecosystem  and \nwater resources management approach to improve the environmental \nconditions  in  Baiyangdian  Basin.  It  will  focus  on  the  critical  needs  to \nconserve  Baiyangdian  Lake\u2014one  of \nimportant  and \nvulnerable ecosystems in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The \nProject  also  fits  well  with  an  umbrella  program  for  biodiversity \nconservation currently being formulated by the PRC. The infrastructure \ninterventions  of  the  Project  are  designed  primarily  to  improve  waste \nmanagement,  reduce  water  and  air  pollution,  provide  clean  energy, \nand  improve  the  reliability  of  water  supplies  for  communities  in  the \nbasin,  while  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  component  will \ncomplement these improvements by raising awareness and promoting \nthe  involvement  of  local  communities  in  management  of  natural \nresources.  \n \nProject  activities  are  aimed  at  promoting  sustainable  ecosystem  and \nwater \nresources  management  with  emphasis  on  biodiversity \nconservation,  urban  development,  and  rural  livelihood  programs.  The \nProject  comprises  four  components:  (i)  subproject  investments\u2014\n22 subprojects of seven different categories (13 wastewater treatment \nplants  (WTPs);  3  water  supply  systems  (WSSs);  2 reforestation;  and \none  each  for  urban  flood  management  [UFM],  integrated  water \nmanagement  [IWM],  solid  waste  management  [SWM]),  and  clean \nenergy development [CED]; (ii) biodiversity conservation to support the \nproposed  GEF-financed  activities;  (iii) \ninstitutional  strengthening \nthrough a range of activities; and (iv) project management support. \n \nThe  Project  will  also  promote  integrated  mechanisms  to  strengthen \ncoordination  among \nthat  have  management \nresponsibilities in the basin.  \n \n\nline  agencies \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nRationale \n\nthe \n\nIWM \n\n(Wangkuai-Xidayang  Reservoir \n\nThe Project complements the initiatives of the Baiyangdian Ecosystem \nRehabilitation  Master  Plan  (2005\u20132015),  which  calls  for  an  integrated \neffort to reduce pollution loads into Baiyangdian Lake and rehabilitate \nthe ecosystem of the basin. As part of the first phase of the Plan, the \nProject will have a demonstration effect for future undertakings and will \nenable  Baoding  municipal  government  (BMG)  achieve,  in  part,  its \nwastewater  management  objectives  set  for  2010,  which  include \nattaining class III water quality in Baiyangdian Lake and class IV water \nquality  in  urban  inland  rivers.  The  Project  will  also  support  the \n11th Five-Year  Plan  (FYP),  2006\u20132010,  which  includes  building  a \n\u201cresource-efficient  and  environment-friendly  society.\u201d  As  part  of  the \n11th  FYP, \nlink-canal) \nsubproject  will  ensure  adequate  water  supply  to  maintain  the  desired \nwater level in the lake and replenish the aquifer at Yimuquan, a major \ngroundwater  supply  source  for  Baoding  City.  The  Project  will  also \nthe  achievement  of  Baoding\u2019s  11th  Five-Year \ncontribute \nEnvironmental  Protection  Plan,  which  involves  a  series  of  pollution \ncontrol  and  ecological \nincludes \ncomprehensive  rehabilitation  of  Baiyangdian  Lake  Wetland  Provincial \nNature  Reserve;  and  the  comprehensive  cleanup  of  Huanghuagou \nRiver dumps that contain solid waste, fly ash, and industrial waste. The \nProject  will  also  further  the  objective  of  the  China  Biodiversity \nPartnership  Framework,  currently  being  formulated  by  the  United \nNations  Development  Programme  with  support  from  GEF.  The \nFramework calls for containing biodiversity loss in nature reserves and \nmainstreaming biodiversity conservation while pursuing socioeconomic \ndevelopment.  The  proposed  Project  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  strategic \npriorities that also call for promoting sustainable ecosystem and water \nresources management, with emphasis on biodiversity conservation.  \n \n\nrehabilitation  programs  and \n\nto \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  proposed  Project  is  improved  quality  of  life,  a \nsustainable  ecosystem,  and  biodiversity  conservation  in  Baiyangdian \nBasin. The outcome is integrated ecosystem and water management, \nand improved environmental conditions in Baiyangdian Basin. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at about $273.4 million \nequivalent,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $12.6  million  and  provisions \nfor  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  during  construction, \ncommitment fee, and spread over an implementation period of 5 years. \n \nA loan of $100,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan \nAgreement.  The  proposed  GEF  grant  of  $2,975,000  will  meet  part  of \nthe  cost  of  biodiversity  conservation  and  institutional  strengthening  \ncomponents. \n  \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n\fSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGlobal Environment Facility \nPRC Government \nBaoding Municipal Government \nBaoding New Hi-Tech Zone Administrative   \n     Commission \nCounty Governments \nChina Construction Bank \nAsian Pacific Carbon Fund \nEquity Investments \n       Total \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n100.0 \n3.0 \n32.0 \n25.8 \n46.6 \n\n50.1 \n4.6 \n1.8 \n9.5 \n273.4 \n\n% \n\n36.6\n1.1\n11.7\n9.4\n17.0\n\n18.3\n1.7\n0.7\n3.5\n100.0\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  PRC,  which  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the \nADB loan to Hebei provincial government which, in turn, will onlend the \nloan proceeds to BMG for further onlending to the city/township/county \ngovernments.  The  city/township/county  governments,  commission, \nautonomous zone will then onlend to the implementing agencies (IAs) \non the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n \nUntil 31 March 2014 \n \n30 September 2013  \n \n \nThe  22  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  13  different  counties  by \n24 IAs.  BMG,  acting  through  Baoding  Development  and  Reform \nCommission  (BDRC),  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project. \nBDRC has set up a central project management office (PMO) with 15 \nstaff  to  implement  the  Project.  A  full-time  project  director  has  been \nappointed  to  head  the  PMO.  The  key  PMO  staff  have  expertise  in \nfinancial  management;  civil  and  mechanical  engineering;  water \nresources, environmental, ecosystem, and project management; social \ndevelopment;  and \nforestry.  Each  county  will  set  up  a  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  at  their  respective  financial  bureaus.  PIUs \nwill  be  headed  by  project  coordinators,  who  will  be  the  focal  point  for \nall  project-related  activities  with  the  PMO.  To  coordinate  the  project \nactivities  among  line  bureaus  and  IAs,  BDRC  will  set  up  a  project \nLeading  Group  that  will  meet  quarterly  in  the  first  2  years  and \nsemiannually thereafter. \n \nBMG, acting through BDRC  \n \nAll procurement of goods and works shall be carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).

Contracts  for  goods  and  works \nestimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  shall  be  procured  using  shopping \nprocedures and those for less than $10,000 through direct contracting. \nThe  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and \ncontracts. \n \nThe Project will finance two consulting packages. Package A, for 236 \nperson-months, \nthree \ninternational experts for 25 person-months and 14 national experts for \n211 person-months. A consulting firm will be engaged to provide these \nservices.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  the  selection,  contract \nnegotiations,  and  contract  management.  Package  B,  for  180  person-\nmonths, \nthe  GEF  grant,  will  comprise  eight \ninternational  experts  for  38  person-months  and  nine  national  experts \nfor  142  person-months.  ADB  will  recruit  the  firm  and  PMO  will \nnegotiate and manage the contract. In selecting these firms, the quality \nand cost-based selection (80:20) will be used and the shortlisted firms \nwill be required to submit full technical proposals for contract budgets \nof  more  than  $1.0  million.  All  recruitment  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nWTPs  and  WSSs  will  benefit  about  1.12  million  people  (or  over \n416,000  households)  out  of  a  total  of  about  6.65  million  people  living \nwithin the wastewater drainage area. Improvement in water supply will \nreduce  the  incidence  of  stomach  and  intestinal  diseases  for  over \n260,000  people.  About  10,000  hectares  (ha)  of  farmland  will  be \nprotected  from  soil  erosion,  particularly  during  the  rainy  months,  with \nthe  reforestation  of  Angezhuang  Reservoir  area.  This  will  benefit  a \ntotal of about 18,750 farm households and will prevent an annual loss \nin  crop  damage  of  about  $2.2  million.  At  full  development  of  the \nBaiyangdian lakeside reforestation subproject, a significant increase in \ntourist activity will generate about $585,000 annually. Rehabilitation of \nreduce  dust  pollution  by  about \nHuanghuagou  River  will \n136,000 tons/year,  and  prevent  further  contamination  of  surface  and \nsubterranean  water  with  a  positive  impact  on  the  health  of  about \n500,000  people  in  Baoding  City.  Health  benefits  will  also  be  derived \nfrom  the  transfer  of  water  resources  for  about  700,000  people  in \nBaoding City and Li County. The UFM subproject in Anxin County will \nprotect public and private property from flood damage. The incidence \nof respiratory diseases will be reduced by about 20% among the target \npopulation (about 240,000 people) who will benefit from the shift from \ncoal  to  geothermal  energy  for  space  heating.  The  CED  subproject  is \nenvisioned  to  save  about  60,000  tons  of  coal  annually  and  result  in \nreduced  incidence  of  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2,  about  1,000  tons/year)  and \ntotal  suspended  particles  (TSP,  about  500 tons/year)  emissions. \nBiodiversity conservation benefits will accrue through restored habitats \nand protection for wild plants and animals including 192 bird species, \n\n\f \nRisks and \nAssumptions  \n\nof  which  at  least  seven  are  of  global  significance.  All  19  of  the \n22 revenue-generating subprojects are financially viable, with financial \ninvestment rates of return of 7.6\u201315.9%. The economic internal rate of \nreturn  of  the  subprojects  is  14.5\u201323.6%  and  for  the  whole  Project  is \n16.9%, indicating that the project investments are viable and robust. \n \nThe  Project  will  adopt  an  integrated  approach  to  address  ecosystem \nand water resources issues, and for the planning and implementation \nof project activities. Line bureaus and counties in Baoding Municipality \ndo not often coordinate their operations. In the past, economic growth \nhas  taken  priority  over  environmental  management.  The  frequency  of \ndrought  years  has  also  been  on  the  rise  over  the  past  two  decades \nand  climate  change  may  further  reduce  water  availability.  If  the \nconstraints  underlying  these  risks  are  not  addressed,  the  project \ninvestments may not achieve the intended impact. These risks can be \nmitigated in part by project interventions, i.e., (i) inculcating integrated \nplanning,  monitoring,  and  enforcing  appropriate  policies  and \nregulations;  and \n(ii) building  staff  capacity  and  strengthening \ninstitutions.  Other  risks  include  (i)  lack  of  understanding  of  ADB \npolicies  and  procedures,  (ii) changes  in  PMO  staff,  (iii)  lengthy \nfraud  and \nprocurement  decision  making,  and  (iv)  procurement \ncorruption.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the  Project  will  provide  technical \nand management advisory support and training, particularly during the \nfirst  2  years  of  implementation.  Delays  in  subproject  completion  can \nalso  jeopardize  project  investments.  Implementation  of  the  IWM \nsubproject  needs  to  be  carefully  monitored  so  that  it  is  completed \nbefore  the  Government\u2019s  South-North  Water  Transfer  Project  takes \nover  the  Sha  Aqueduct.  The  Government  realizes  the  importance  of \nwater  supply  to  the  lake  and  will  ensure  its  uninterrupted  flow  by \ncoordinating the implementation of both undertakings. \n \nThe  variety  in  project  investments  will  limit  its  financial  and  economic \nrisks. The water treatment, supply, and infrastructure investments will \nuse  established  technologies  and  designs.  Similarly,  the  reforestation \nsubprojects  will  use  indigenous  species  and  modern  techniques.  The \nbiodiversity  conservation  activities  have  been  designed  and  will  be \nimplemented  in  close  consultation  with  local  communities.  Therefore, \nthe overall project risk is low. \n\nv \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvii \n\n \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\n\fix \n\n \n\n \n\n\fx \n\n \n\n\fxi \n\n \n\n \n\n\fxii \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); and (ii) a proposed administration of a grant from \nthe Global Environment Facility (GEF), both for the Integrated Ecosystem and Water Resources \nManagement in the Baiyangdian Basin Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nIn  August  2005,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  project  preparatory \n2. \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)  to  help  Baoding  municipal  government  (BMG)  to  formulate  the \nProject.1 The PPTA was cofinanced by GEF. This report is based on the analysis of the PPTA, \nfeasibility  studies  of  the  Government,  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with  officials \nand stakeholders. The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and problem \ntree analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  PRC  has  achieved  an  unprecedented  rate  of  economic  growth  over  the  last \n20 years.  One  of  the  unintended  consequences  is  severe  degradation  of  the  environment, \nespecially the pollution of water bodies. The Government\u2019s plans to contain water pollution have \nnot  kept  pace  with  the  rate  of  agricultural,  industrial,  and  urban  growth.  During  the  10th  Five-\nYear  Plan  (FYP),  2001\u20132005,  environmental  management  was  unsatisfactory\u2014eight  of  the \n20 environmental  targets  remained  unattained.  In  particular,  emissions  of  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2) \nexperienced a rebound, with an increase of 28% against the planned target of a 10% reduction, \nand a decrease of only 2% in the discharge of chemical oxygen demand (COD), compared with \nthe  planned  10%  reduction.  Treated  sewage  envisaged  under  the  10th  FYP  fell  short  of  the \ntarget  of  45%  by  about  8%.  Only  about  60%  of  the  targets  for  pollution  control  for  the  major \nrivers  and  lakes  were  accomplished.  Furthermore,  aside  from  a  number  of  high-profile \nenvironmental  accidents\u2014including  the  large-scale  chemical  spill  in  Songhua  River  Basin  in \n2005\u2014the  trend  in  ecological  degradation  persisted.  Several  factors  contributed  to  the  poor \nenvironmental  performance  during \nthe  most  significant  were: \n(i) inadequate  attention  of  local  governments  to  environmental  protection,  (ii)  overheated \neconomy  with  low  resource-use  efficiency,  (iii)  weak  regulatory  supervision  and  enforcement, \n(iv) weak cross-sectoral coordination, and (v) ineffective financing mechanisms. \n \nUnder  the  11th  FYP,  2006\u20132010,  the  Government  has  given  priority  to  several \n4. \nenvironmental  and  natural  resource  concerns  which  include  (i)  land  degradation,  (ii)  water \nshortage  and  pollution,  (iii)  air  pollution,  (iv)  poor  urban  environmental  infrastructure, \n(v) degradation  of \nintensity  of \nenvironmental  accidents,  and  (vii)  global  environmental  issues  such  as  climate  change  and \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  Chinese  Communist  Party  and  the  State  Council  issued  a \nseries  of  policy  directives  on  environmental  protection  for  the  11th  FYP  period.  These  policy \ndirections are incorporated into the National Economic and Social Development Master Plan of \nMarch  2006.  This  Plan  gives  priority  to  (i)  protection  and  rehabilitation  of  valued  ecosystems, \n(ii) increasing  efforts  in  pollution  control,  (iii)  improving  natural  resource  management,  and \n(iv) sustainable utilization of marine and water resources. \n \n\nthe  rural  environment,  (vi) \n\nthe  10th  FYP.

(This  project  was  cofinanced  by  the  GEF\u2019s \nproject preparatory grant, which was approved in March 2007). \n\n \n\n\fAs  a  guiding  policy  for  the  11th  FYP,  the  State  Council  Directive  sets  forth  two  broad \n5. \nenvironmental objectives for the next 5\u201315 years. By 2010, the environment of key regions and \ncities  will  be  improved,  and  the  trend  of  ecological  degradation  will  be  arrested.  By  2020,  the \nquality  of  the  environment  and  the  state  of  the  country\u2019s  ecosystems  will  have  improved \nsignificantly. There are many other specific targets set under the 11th FYP but the reduction in \nenergy intensity by 20% and total pollution loading by 10% are the two most prominent. \n \n6. \nThe PRC is committed to the principles of the Millennium Declaration and its Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) set by the United Nations.2 Among the goals set under the MDGs, \nthe  PRC  has  been  successful  in  providing  the  urban  population  with  access  to  safe  drinking \nwater  but  progress  in  rural  areas  has  been  slow.  Consequently,  a  large  portion  of  the  rural \npopulation still suffers from diseases caused by poor drinking water and inadequate sanitation \nfacilities,  i.e.,  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WTPs),  water  supply  systems  (WSSs),  and  public \ntoilets.  Consistent  with  the  MDGs,  the  PRC  continues  to  demonstrate  its  resolve  in  checking \nenvironmental  deterioration.  Expenditure  on  environmental  protection  has  continued  to \nincrease,  and  a  considerable  body  of  environmental  laws  and  regulations  has  been \npromulgated. Following the 1992 United Nations Rio Summit, the PRC formulated the National \nAgenda 21. Many provinces and cities have since formulated their own environmental protection \nstrategies.  The  new  Western  Development  Strategy,  adopted  in  1999,  also  emphasizes \nenvironmental protection. The PRC is party to several important international conventions. New \npolicies and environmental protection plans for the next 5-year planning period call for building a \n\u201cresource-efficient  and  environment-friendly  society\u201d.  Through  these  efforts,  the  Government \nexpects to succeed in reversing environmental degradation in the long run. \n \nB. \n \nBaoding Municipality\u2014which covers about 85% of 31,500 square kilometers (km2) of the \n7. \nBaiyangdian  Basin  and  where  Baiyangdian  Lake  is  located\u2014lies  in  the  central  part  of  Hebei \nProvince  (Map  1).3  Baoding  City  is  125  kilometers  (km)  from  the  provincial  capital  of \nShijiazhuang  in  the  south  and  140  km  from  Beijing  in  the  north.  Baoding  Municipality  has  a \ntypical  monsoon  climate,  with  annual  average  precipitation  of  570  millimeters  and  an  annual \nmean  temperature  of  around  12oC.  The  lake  is  the  largest  remaining  semi-closed  freshwater \nbody  in  the  northern  PRC.  It  lies  in  the  middle  reaches  of  Daqing  River  Basin4  and  ultimately \ndischarges in Bohai Gulf, Yellow Sea. All of the lake body is located in Anxin and Xiong counties \nof  Baoding  Municipality.  The  lake  has  a  surface  area  of  366  km2  and  consists  of  a  series  of \nnatural low-lying depressions and reed marshes. There are four large-scale reservoirs upstream \nof  the  lake,  including  Angezhuang,  Longmen,  Wangkuai,  and  Xidayang.  From  south  to  north, \neight rivers\u2014Baigou, Cao, Fu, Ping, Pu, Sha (Zhulong), Tang, and Xiaoyi\u2014flow into the lake. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n                                                 \n2    United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  2005.

The  goals  are:  (i)  eradicating  extreme  poverty  and  hunger;  (ii)  achieving  universal  primary  education; \n(iii) promoting  gender  equality  and  empowerment  of  women;  (iv)  reducing  child  mortality;  (v)  improving  maternal \nhealth;  (vi)  controlling  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  other  diseases;  (vii)  attaining  environmental  sustainability;  and \n(viii) strengthening global partnership for development.    \n\n3  Baoding is the third largest municipality in Hebei Province, with a total area of 22,112 km2 and a total population of \nabout 10.9 million, including about 1 million in urban areas. The municipality comprises 22 counties and 4 urban \ndistricts. Total gross domestic product of the municipality in 2005 was $14.0 billion or an increase of 14% over the \nprevious  year.  Its  growth  rate  during  the  10th  FYP,  2001\u20132005,  averaged  11%  per  annum,  with  industrial  as  the \nlead sector, followed by services and agricultural sectors. \n\n4  Daiqing  River  Basin  is  one  of  nine  main  river  systems  within  Hai  River  Basin.  It  has  a  total  area  of  43,065 km2, \nmostly  comprising  Hebei  Province,  a  small  portion  of  Shanxi  Province,  and  portions  of  Beijing  and  Tianjin \nmunicipalities.  The  basin  is  divided  into  three  major  geographic  regions:  (i)  Taihang  Shan,  mountains  from  500\u2013\n2,286  meters  altitude,  consisting  of  the  western  40%  of  the  basin;  (ii)  a  low  hill  transition  zone  of  less  than \n500 meters altitude, covering 10% of the basin; and (iii) the lowland plains occupying 50% of the basin\u2019s land area. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f8. \nThe  lake  and  its  upper  watershed  in  the  Taihang  mountains  support  significant \nbiodiversity of regional and global significance within Daqing River Basin. The open water and \naquatic beds of the lake are spawning grounds and feeding habitats for a diverse array of fish \nand  other  animal  species,  during  the  spring  and  autumn  seasons,  including  up  to  192  bird \nspecies.  The  lake  is  also  an  important  refueling  site  for  migratory  birds  on  the  East  Asian\u2013\nAustralasian  flyway.  Seven  globally-threatened  bird  species  are  regularly  sighted  in  the  area. \nDuring  the  peak  migration  season  (south\u2013north  in  May  and  north\u2013south  in  September),  more \nthan 100,000 ducks transit through the lake. The Taihang mountains, which contain most of the \nlast remaining natural forests in Baoding Municipality, support a wide range of rare and endemic \nanimals  such  as  the  brown-eared  pheasant  (Crossoptilon  mantchuricum),  grey-sided  thrush \n(Turdus feae), leopard (Panthera pardus), and golden takin  (Budorcas taxicolor). The Taihang \nmountains are also recognized as the center of plant endemism in the PRC. \n \n Historically,  the  lake  served  many  environmental  and  economic  services  and  was \n9. \ndescribed  as  the  \u201ckidney\u201d  of  the  northern  PRC.  Because  of  its  strategic  position  as  a  sink  in \nDaqing  River  basin,  it  is  a  critical  floodwater  retention  catchment  of  rainfall  water  inflows  and \nsurface  runoffs  for  about  72%  of  the  basin\u2019s  area.  Specifically,  it  regulates  floodwater \ndischarges and water levels, and subsequently moderates waterlogging. It is likewise a pathway \nfor  the  transport  of  substances,  especially  nutrients  that  help  contribute  to  the  purification  of \nwater and the regeneration of nutrients. The lake has been an economically important source of \nfreshwater fish and reed production (at one time, 60% of all reed harvested in the PRC) as well \nas a source for drinking water and irrigation. It serves as a means for transport and one of the \nmain recreation sites for local tourists in the northern PRC, particularly residents from key cities \nlike Beijing and Tianjin.5 As a large  body of  water, the lake also moderates local and regional \ntemperatures and therefore has an effect on the microclimate of its surroundings. The lake also \nhas  economic  importance,  especially  for  more  than  200,000  people  living  within  its  wetlands \nand  peripheral  zones,  as  the  lake  resources  provide  them  with  (i)  livelihood  opportunities \n(i.e., freshwater fishery, reed production, and tourism-related jobs and businesses); (ii) water for \ndrinking and irrigation; and (iii) major transportation routes. \n \n10. \nIn  the  last  4  decades,  the  functions  and  values  of  the  basin  as  well  as  the  lake  have \nbeen  eroded,  with  adverse  impacts  on  its  ecosystem.  Construction  of  large  reservoirs  in  the \nupstream has led to a dramatic decline in water inflows and surface runoffs into the lake, from \nan average of 1.73 billion cubic meters (m3) of water discharging into the lake in the 1960s down \nto 0.065 billion m3 in 2002. Sediment load had also decreased from 7.1 billion m3 in the 1960s to \njust 1.0 billion m3 by 1999. With the demand for water exceeding supply in Daqing River Basin, \nthe frequencies of \u201cno\u201d or \u201clow\u201d inflows to the lake have become more acute, especially during \ndry  years,  thus  contributing  to  more  incidences  of  low  water  levels  in  the  lake.  Over  the  last \nfour decades,  the  size  of  the  lake  has  decreased  by  almost  half  because  of  controlled  water \nflows, continuous droughts, and soil erosion. Moreover, rising population, expanded agricultural \nand  industrial  activities,  with  limited  solid  and  wastewater  disposal  measures  in  the  upstream \nand  within  the  lake  area,  have  transformed  the  lake  into  a  major  depository  of  wastewater \ndischarges,  pollutant  substances,  and  sediments.  It  is  estimated  that  half  of  the  pollution \noriginates  from  the  upstream,  while  the  other  half  emanates  from  the  population  of  more  than \n200,000 living  in  the  lake\u2019s  wetlands  and  surrounding  areas.  In  addition,  disturbances  in  the \nupper  watersheds  through  indiscriminate  logging,  mining  and  quarrying,  and  conversion  of \nforests and wetlands to agricultural/industrial sites, have contributed to massive soil erosion and \nland degradation. These, in turn, have caused excessive water obstruction along the tributaries \nthat feed into the lake. \n \n\n                                                 \n5  The number of domestic tourists visiting the lake and surrounding areas is about 1.5 million per year. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n11. \nEutrophication  of  the  lake,  caused  by  increasing  pollution,  has  become  a  serious \nproblem\u2014with  water  quality  deteriorating  from  class  III  to  classes  IV  and  V  over  the  past \n4 decades.6  Therefore,  the  ecosystem  in  the  lake  is  constantly  at  risk.  Aside  from  the  regular \noccurrence of fish-kills each year, there has been a drastic loss in biodiversity as the habitat of \nbiotic  communities,  especially  those  in  the  wetland-littoral  zones,  have  reduced  drastically. \nCurrently, there are only 47 water plant, 54 fish, 192 bird, and 14 wild mammal species living in \nthe  lake.7  Livelihoods  of  people  who  depend  on  the  lake\u2019s  resources  have  likewise  been \nadversely affected. Moreover, the presence of heavy metals, toxins, and chemicals in the lake \nhas increased the incidence of diseases. More detailed sector analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n12.  Weak institutions, inadequate capacity of the local government, and poor planning in the \nuse  and  allocation  of  the  lake\u2019s  water  resources\u2014coupled  with  limited  understanding  of  its \nintegral role in a basin-wide management framework\u2014have led to its overall degradation. This \nhas been aggravated by existing conflicts and overlaps in the roles of government agencies at \nthe  provincial  and  municipal  levels  on  water  use  and  allocation  driven  by  single-sector \napproaches. In addition, as economies in the urban centers grew rapidly (at an average of 11%/ \nyear),  economic  growth  became  the  primordial  goal  of  local  governments.  Consequently, \nregulatory  and  policy  measures  to  ensure  sustainable  management  of  the  lake\u2019s  ecosystem \nwere hardly enforced. The situation was exacerbated by the public\u2019s inadequate awareness of \ntheir responsibility and limited incentives for the private sector to participate in the conservation \nof scarce water resources and the protection of the lake\u2019s ecosystem. \n \n13. \nGovernment  Policies  and  Plans.  The  Government  recognizes  the  urgent  need  to \naddress prevailing ecosystem and water management issues in the basin through an integrated \napproach. It has included pollution control, sustainable use of water resources, and ecosystem \nmanagement  of  the  lake  as  one  of  the  country\u2019s  priority  programs  for  Agenda  21.  Hebei \nprovincial government designated the lake a Provincial Nature Reserve (PNR) in 2002, and in \n2003, an area of 34,000 hectares (ha) of natural forest in the upper watershed was protected. \nBMG  has  taken  the  responsibility  as  the  custodian  of  the  lake  ecosystem  by  overseeing  its \nrestoration  and  management.  These  actions  are  complemented  by  city  ordinances  that \n(i) prohibit  setting  up  textile  enterprises  within  5  km  of  the  lakeshores,  (ii)  introduce  a  gradual \nprice increase in water tariff, and (iii) enhance the lake surroundings for improved local tourism. \nThe  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  and  local  research  institutes  monitor  the  quality  of  the \nlake\u2019s  water  resources.  However,  more  efforts  are  needed  to  restore  the  lake\u2019s  primary \nfunctions to environmentally acceptable levels. \n \nBMG\u2019s 11th Five-Year Environmental Protection Plan (FYEPP), 2006\u20132010, calls for an \n14. \n8% reduction in COD from the 2000 level, which is about 2% lower than the national target of \n10%.  It  will  reduce  the  lake\u2019s  pollution  by  17%  and  improve  its  water  quality  to  class  III.8  The \nFYEPP aims to treat all urban sewage in Baoding City and about 60% (from 0% currently) in the \n22  counties/cities  by  2010.  It  also  provides  for  a  series  of  pollution  control  and  ecological \nrehabilitation programs. The planned reduction in COD levels, by constructing 27 WTPs, under \nthe  water  pollution  control  program,  is  relevant  to  this  Project.  The  FYEPP  also  includes \n                                                 \n6   The  National  Ambient  Water  Quality  Standards  for  Surface  Water  divides  water  quality  into  five  classes,  with \nclass III  being  a  minimum  standard  for  drinking  water  and  class  V  being  the  lowest  quality  equivalent  to  raw \nsewage. \n\n7   Baseline data from the 1960s is not available. However, it is believed that dozens of such species have become \n\n8    ADB.  2002.

This  ongoing  Project  is  providing  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment  in  Baoding,  Chengde,  Tangshan,  and  Zhangjiakou;  capacity  building  for  provincial  and  municipal \nsewerage companies; and introducing cost recovery and tariff structures. \n\nextinct. \n\n \n\n\finfrastructure \n\n(i) comprehensive  rehabilitation  of  Baiyangdian  Lake  Wetland  Reserve,  (ii)  safe  disposal  of  fly \nash  from  thermal  power  plants,  (iii)  promotion  of  clean  energy  by  developing  geothermal \nresources, and (iv) reduction in the number of people without access to safe drinking water. The \nimplementation  of  the  national  south-to-north  water  reallocation  program  is  envisaged  to \nimprove the availability of water for domestic use, thereby increasing the net inflow in the basin. \nThe  Baiyangdian  Ecosystem  Rehabilitation  Master  Plan,  2005\u20132015,  likewise  calls  for  an \nintegrated approach in reducing pollution in the lake and rehabilitating ecosystems in the basin \nwith a planned investment of over $1.0 billion.  \n \nADB\u2019s  Operational  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010,9 \n15. \nsupports  the  11th  FYP;  and  aims  to  help  the  country  achieve  economic  growth  in  an  efficient, \nequitable, and sustainable manner. In particular, ADB\u2019s strategy for the agriculture and natural \nresources  sector  supports  the  country\u2019s  transition  to  sustainable  agriculture  and  natural \nresources management and rural growth with a goal of reducing rural poverty by (i) improving \nsector  governance;  (ii)  providing \nfor  rural  development;  (iii)  addressing \nenvironmental  issues  such  as  land  degradation,  water  and  soil  conservation,  integrated  water \nresources management,  efficient  water  use  and  conservation,  pollution  control, and  promoting \nsound natural resources management; and (iv) encouraging innovations responding to issues. \nThe proposed Project supports ADB\u2019s strategic priorities. \n \nExternal  Assistance.  To  overcome  the  constraints  of  its  own  programs,  and  to  gain \n16. \nfrom  international  experience,  the  Government  entered  into  a  strategic  partnership  with  GEF \nand other international partners to develop and scale up comprehensive resource management \napproaches  that  integrate  ecological,  economic,  and  social  dimensions  of  biodiversity \nmanagement.  Water  pollution  severely  endangers  the  PRC\u2019s  rich  biodiversity,  especially \nthrough  human  activities  that  destroy/degrade  natural  habitats,  through  land  conversions, \nindustrialization,  poor  management  of  water  resources,  and  deforestation.  ADB  and  other \ninternational  agencies  have  provided  a  number  of  technical  assistance  and  loan  projects  to \nassist  the  PRC  in  wetland  and  environmental  protection,  agriculture  and  natural  resource \ndevelopment,  soil  conservation,  forestry,  flood  management,  wastewater  treatment,  and  water \nsupply. A list of relevant projects is in Appendix 4. \n \nLessons. Integrating water and ecosystem management is a relatively new concept in \n17. \nthe PRC, as well as in Hebei Province, and there has been little external assistance directly for \nbiodiversity conservation in Baiyangdian Basin. The United Nations Development Programme\u2019s \n(UNDP) GEF project\u2014Wetland Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use in China, 2001\u2013\n2006, involving the wetlands of Sanjiang Plain, Dongting Lake, and Yancheng\u2014provided some \nlessons.  However,  this  project  adopted  an  engineering  approach  to  restoring  the  hydraulic \nregime at specific nature reserves, and its institutional arrangements from national level through \nState  Forestry  Bureau  were  complicated  and  difficult  to  implement  at  the  local  level.  ADB\u2019s \nongoing Sanjiang Plain Wetland Protection Project10 is (i) taking a holistic approach for wetland \nprotection  and  water  resources  management  at  basin  level  and  not  just  at  the  nature  reserve \nsites,  and  (ii) implementing  the  Project  at  the  provincial  level  to  improve  interdepartmental \ncoordination. This Project will continue these efforts by enabling the integrated management of \nthe  ecosystem  and  water  resources  in  Baiyangdian  Basin  by  (i) supporting  institutional \ncoordination, (ii) ensuring adequate water quality and flow discharging to Baiyangdian Lake, (iii) \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2008.

Lessons \nlearned from previous projects were reflected in this project design by (i) undertaking thorough \nreview of technical designs and technologies, rigorous financial and economic analysis, detailed \nassessment of cash flows and social issues; (ii) introducing institutional strengthening measures \nto improve corporate governance; and (iii) ensuring an adequate debt-equity ratio for the project \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs).  ADB\u2019s  forest  development  projects  in  general  provide  lessons \nfrom various countries, indicating (i) community participation; and (ii) partnership between forest \ndepartment  and  participants,  as  key  factors  in  the  success  of  plantations  and  reforestation. \nThese lessons have also been incorporated in the design of this Project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n19. \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  Project  is  improved  quality  of  life,  sustainable  ecosystem, \nand biodiversity conservation in Baiyangdian Basin. The water quality in the basin and lake will \nimprove and water quantity in the lake will be maintained. Improved sanitation and clean water \nsupply  will  improve  quality  of  life,  and  help  contain  morbidity  and  mortality  rates.  Biodiversity \nmanagement  will  increase  the  population  of  endangered  species  and  improve  the  habitat  of \nmigratory  birds.  In-lake  communities  will  gain  viable  and  sustainable  livelihoods  without \ndegrading the environment.  \n \n20. \nThe  Project\u2019s  outcome  is  integrated  ecosystem  and  water  management,  and  improved \nenvironmental  conditions  in  Baiyangdian  Basin.  The  Project  will  reduce  each  of  the  following \npollutants:  COD  by  37,884  tons/year;  total  suspended  particles  by  2,000  tons/year;  SO2  by \n428 tons/year;  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  by  28,121  tons/year;  and  TSP  by  535  tons/year.  It  will \nreduce morbidity rates by 10% and improve sanitation and hygiene for 1.12 million people. The \nProject will supply clean water to 260,000 people and provide enhanced flood protection to life \nand property for 51,000 people. It will help Baiyangdian in-lake communities take up eco-friendly \nalternative livelihoods, and maintain a sustainable water level at 6\u20139 meters (m).   \n \n21. \nThe  Project  will  comprise  four  components:  (i)  subproject  investments\u201422  subprojects \nof seven different categories (13 WTPs, 3 WSSs, 2 reforestation; and one each for urban flood \nmanagement  [UFM],  integrated  water  management  [IWM],  solid  waste  management  [SWM]), \nand  clean  energy  development  [CED];  (ii)  biodiversity  conservation  to  support  the  proposed \nGEF-financed  activities;  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  through  a  range  of  activities;  and  (iv) \nproject  management  support.

The  Project  will  support  13  WTPs,  of  which  six  are \nlocated  north/northeast,  five  southwest,  and  two  west  of  Baiyangdian  Lake  (Map  2).  The \nestimated  service  population  is  about  650,000.  Upon  completion,  these  plants  will  treat  an \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\festimated  365,000  m3/day  of  wastewater  and  restrict  organic  pollution  loading  to  the  lake\u2014 \nannual  removal  of  36,850  tons  of  COD  or  about  43%  of  the  targeted  annual  reduction  of \n86,349 tons  under  the  FYEPP.  The  current  wastewater  tariffs  in  the  adjoining  towns  are \nCNY0.7\u20131.3/m3.  During  the  project  preparation  consultations,  beneficiaries  expressed  their \nwillingness  to  pay  for  the  service  beyond  the  requisite  threshold  (CNY1.3/m3)  that  will  recover \nthe investment and operating costs. \n \n24. \nThe design forecasts are based on a comparison using a projection of several factors, \ni.e., population growth; increases in per capita water supply/use; and changes in industrial water \nuse  caused  by  increases  in  production,  unaccounted  water  loss,  and  improved  efficiency  in \nwater use. Almost all the subproject urban areas have existing combined sewers and essential \npumping stations that discharge untreated wastewater into the adjacent rivers and eventually to \nthe lake. Major industries within the service areas include tanneries, textile, paper, automobile, \nfertilizer, chemicals, and machinery plants.  \n \n25.  Water  Supply  Systems.  The  Project  will  support  three  WSSs  located  in  Yi  County, \nXiong  County,  and  Dingzhou  City  (Map  3).  Upon  completion,  they  will  supply  over \n106,600 m3/day  of  clean  water  to  194,000  domestic  users.  With  rapid  economic  development \nand  urbanization,  the  target  population  is  projected  to  be  around  430,000  by  2010.  The  new \nWSSs will help reduce the usage of private wells that cause unregulated and haphazard water \ndrawdown. The existing wells waste a considerable amount of water. The current water supply \nnetwork  is  also  inefficient,  causing water  leakage  rate  of  20\u201340%.  The  new  WSSs  will ensure \nlong-term  and  sustainable  management  of  aquifers  and  significant  savings  in  distribution \nnetworks. Current domestic water tariffs are as follows: CNY2.11/m3 in Yi County, CNY1.6/m3 in \nXiong  County,  and  CNY1.7/m3  in  Dingzhou  City.  During  the  project  preparation  consultations, \npotential  beneficiaries  expressed  their  willingness  to  pay  beyond  the  requisite  thresholds  that \nwill recover the investment and operating costs. \n \nReforestation.  Deforestation  in  many  parts  of  the  basin  has  caused  land  degradation. \n26. \nEspecially  in  the  hilly  areas,  denuded  lands  result  in  soil  erosion.  This  subproject  will  support \nreforestation  of  18,450  ha  in  two  areas\u2014around  Angezhuang  Reservoir  in  Yi  County  and \naround  Baiyangdian  Lake  in  Anxin  County  (Map  3).  Reforestation  around  Angezhuang \nReservoir  will  cover  9,800  ha  consisting  of  2,000  ha  of  fast-growing  and  high-yielding  forests, \n2,000 ha of water conservation forests, 4,850 ha of soil erosion control forests, and 950 ha of \necological  protection  forests  with  non-timber  forest  products.  Another  8,650  ha  area  will  be \ndeclared a mountain closure for forest recovery.11 Lakeside forestation will include (i) protection \nforests  along  lakeshore  and  main  canals  on  264  ha  for  66  km;  (ii)  landscaping  and  protection \nforests  on  1,200  ha  around  in-lake  villages;  (iii)  environmental  protection  forests  on  66  ha  of \nbarren land; and (iv) ornamental forests on 33 ha of tourist sites.  \n \nUrban  Flood  Management.  Anxin  County  is  located  within  the  flood  diversion  area  of \n27. \nBaiyangdian  Lake  (Map  3).  With  economic  development  and  a  population  increase,  the  urban \narea  has  expanded  northward.  The  existing  embankment  cannot  protect  the  expanding  city \nzone. This subproject will reinforce the quality of embankments and increase the protected area \nfrom 5.16 km2 to 19.47 km2; and improve the flood control standard from the recurrence period \nof 20\u201350 years to protect life and properties in the Anxin County effectively. \n\n                                                 \n11  The mountain closure policy does not mean absolutely no access but implies that the subproject area will not be \nallowed for free grazing or logging. The mountain land belongs to local households and communities in addition to \ntheir  farmlands.  They  will  be  allowed  to  harvest  non-timber  forest  products,  without  interfering  with  subproject \nactivities. Once reforestation starts, young trees will require protection from human and livestock interventions. The \nmountain  closure  policy  guards  against  such  interventions.  The  livelihood  activities  will  not  be  affected,  as  local \nhouseholds have their farmlands separate from mountain lands. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n28. \nIntegrated  Water  Management.  Wangkuai  Reservoir  on  the  Sha  River  currently \ndischarges 170 million m3 down the Sha aqueduct to replenish the lake. However, starting 2010, \nthis  aqueduct  will  be  used  exclusively  for  the  Government\u2019s  South-North  Water  Transfer \nProject\u2014a national mega-project to link Yangtze River to Yellow River. It is, therefore, urgent to \nsecure  an  alternative  route  to  supply  water  to  the  lake  and  to  maintain  its  ecosystem.  The \nproposed link canal will connect Wangkuai Reservoir to Xidayang Reservoir (Tang River Basin) \nand upgrade the existing Tang aqueduct downstream of Xidayang Reservoir which discharges \ninto the lake (Map 4). About 200 million m3 of water will be diverted per annum from Wangkuai \nReservoir,  and  128  million  m3  is  expected  to  replenish  the  lake  after  deducting  conveyance \nlosses. This volume is sufficient to maintain the lake\u2019s water at an ecologically acceptable level \n(7.3 m). An alternative route considered was the existing Sha River, which has dried up since \nthe  construction  of  Wangkuai  Reservoir.  This  alternative  was  deemed  inefficient  because \nthrough this route, only 60 million m3 will reach the lake because of the high infiltration rate of \nthe Sha River course (conveyance efficiency is estimated to be only 30%). An additional benefit \nof  the  proposed  design  is  floodwater  harvesting.  The  excess  floodwater  that  cannot  be \nregulated by the two reservoirs will be used to recharge the Yimuquan aquifer located adjacent \nto Baoding City. This will contribute to increasing the groundwater resources that the city relies \non as its source of drinking water.  \n \n29. \nSolid  Waste  Management.  Huanghuagou  is  a  heavily  polluted  river  flowing  through \nBaoding City (Map 5). Major sources of pollution include the (i) dump site adjacent to the river, \nwhich  has  no  leachate  control;  (ii)  open-air  ash  storage  of  Baoding  Cogeneration  Plant;  and \n(iii) wastewater  pit,  which  collects  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater  and  discharges  to \nHuanghuagou  River.  This  subproject  aims  to  improve  the  environment  of  Huanghuagou  River \nand its surrounding area through four interventions: (i) relocation of the dump site; (ii) closure of \nthe ash storage; (iii) improvement of 0.5 km of Huanghuagou River; and (iv) rehabilitation of the \narea currently used for the dump site, wastewater pit, and ash storage into an eco-theme park \nand urban land for future development (Map 6). The existing waste materials were dumped here \nbefore 2003\u2014dumping at this site has been prohibited ever since. These waste materials will be \ntransported  to  Baoding  Municipal  Solid  Waste  Landfill,  which  has  sufficient  capacity  to \naccommodate all 550,000 m3 of waste. The leachate from the dump site will also be treated in \nrelevant facilities there. The ash (2 million m3) will be transported to concrete and brick factories \nand construction sites around Baoding and other cities, including Beijing and Tianjin.12 The ash-\nflushing water will be treated in the existing and proposed WTPs, while the settled silt from ash-\nflushing water will be disposed of in Baoding Municipal Solid Waste Landfill. Wastewater flowing \ninto  Huanghuagou  River  via  wastewater  pit  will  be  intercepted  and  pumped  to  the  existing \nLugang WTP. This subproject will significantly improve the environment of the target area, and \nthe eco-theme park is expected to raise public awareness on environmental protection.  \n \n30. \nClean Energy Development. Xiong County, located northeast of the lake, has abundant \ngeothermal resources. Currently, the coal chimneys, used for space-heating, spew ash on the \nlake,  adding  to  its  pollution  (Map  3).  Geothermal  water  is  already  used  for  space-heating  of \n600,000 m2 and there are 19 public hot-spring bathhouses. The purpose of this subproject is to \nenhance the use of clean geothermal resources to heat an additional area of 1,650,000 m2 of \nlocal private housing and public building complexes. Geothermal space-heating will replace the \nuse of 60,000 tons of coal each winter; and will reduce emissions of CO2, COD, SO2 and ash \nthat  pollute  both  air  and  water.  The  geothermal  resources  will  also  be  used  for  economic \nactivities such as hot-spring bathing and other leisure/health attractions, as well as for 13 ha of \n\n                                                 \n12  Fly ash is a valuable resource/raw material for cement, concrete, and many other value-added applications such \nas  brick  manufacturing  and  road  construction\u2014primarily  because  of  its  pozzolanic  characteristic.  Currently,  the \nmarket demand for ash is good considering many highway projects, i.e., Changshi and Baochuang expressway. \n\n\fgeothermal  greenhouses  and  2  ha  of  aquaculture.  The  proposed  geothermal  space-heating \nplan  comprises  three  main  components:  (i)  geothermal  resource  production,  (ii)  reinjection \nsystem,  and  (iii)  space-heating  distribution  system.  The  subproject  will  install  11  geothermal \nproduction wells and 10 reinjection wells, among other facilities such as heat exchanger stations \nand  distribution  pipes.  Reinjection  ensures  sustainable  exploration  of  geothermal  resources, \nand  reduces  the  environmental  impact  of  discharged  geothermal  water.  This  subproject  will \nimprove both the air and water quality of Xiong County and will help initiate a program to make \nXiong  a  \u201csmokeless  town.\u201d  Current  space-heating  tariffs  are  CNY12\u201315/m3  for  domestic  and \nCNY15\u201318/m3  for  commercial  consumers.  During  the  project  preparation  consultations, \npotential  beneficiaries  expressed  their  willingness  to  pay  for  the  service  beyond  the  requisite \nthresholds that will recover the investment and operating costs. \n \n31. \nThe  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM),  established  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  and \nmanaged  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  has  significant \npotential  to  provide  additional  carbon  financing  to  support  the  development  of  clean  energy \nprojects  in  the  PRC.  This  geothermal  subproject  is  eligible  for  additional  carbon  financing  but \nrequired development of a new CDM Methodology. As a result, the Technical Support Facility of \nADB\u2019s  Carbon  Market  Initiative  (CMI)  has  prepared  a  new  methodology  for  this  subproject \ntogether  with  a  Project  Design  Document  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  The  new  baseline \nmethodology is under consideration by the Methodology Panel of the CDM Executive Board and \nits views are expected by the end of June 2008. \n \n32. \nthe  proposed \nmethodology, are 119,393 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per year.13 At a price of $12/tCO2e, \nthis  could  generate  annual  revenues  of  about  $1.43  million  to  the  subproject  up  to  2012.14 \nAssuming that the subproject would be operational by mid 2010 and reduce emissions for 2.5 \nyears  by  2012,  the  subproject  would  generate  0.29  million  tCO2e,  which  will  produce  $3.58 \nmillion in revenues. The Asia Pacific Carbon Fund (APCF), under CMI, has expressed interest \nin  purchasing  a  portion  of  the  Certified  Emission  Reductions  (CERs)  generated  by  this \nsubproject up to 31 December 2012. APCF can purchase up to 50% of CERs upfront.15 Based \non  the  above  calculations,  APCF\u2019s  upfront  payment  to  Xiong  County  could  amount  to  $1.79 \nmillion.16  This  would  be  equivalent  to  about  9.6%  of  the  total  subproject  cost.  In  line  with  the \nProject\u2019s  social  development  objective,  Xiong  County  has  agreed  to  share  50%  of  the  carbon \ncredit revenues with the Xiong County poverty reduction agency to expand its activities. This will \nbe an incremental amount over and above the prevailing budget of the Agency. \n \n\n Estimated  emission  reductions  under \n\nthis  subproject,  based  on \n\nBiodiversity Conservation \n\n2.  \n \nThrough  a  range  of  interventions,  the  subproject  activities  will  help  alleviate  general \n33. \necosystem  constraints \nimproving  water  quality  and  quantity.  These \nimprovements are a prerequisite for bringing about the global environmental benefits envisioned \n\nthe  basin  by \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n13   These  are  preliminary  estimates  assuming  that  the  proposed  methodology  is  approved  by  the  Methodology \n\nPanel of the Clean Development Mechanism\u2019s Executive Board. \n\n14    Market  price  varies  considerably  primarily  based  on  delivery  risk.  Based  on  the  current  market,  $12/tCO2e  is \n\nconsidered to be a conservative estimate.  \n\n15   Asia Pacific Carbon Fund team will start negotiations with the implementing agency of the subproject to finalize \nthe  Certified  Emission  Reductions  purchase  agreement  soon  after  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism\u2019s \nExecutive Board approves the proposed methodology and after the final Project Design Document is available.    \n16   The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends on 31 December 2012. Carbon credits generated up to \nthis  point  can  be  sold  to  the  Asia  Pacific  Carbon  Fund  and  it  can  purchase  50%  upfront  from  the  developer \n(Xiong County). Carbon credits generated after 2012 and through 2020 could be sold directly by the developer \nand may amount to about $6.2 million (assuming a conservative price of $5/tCO2e). Therefore, the subproject will \npotentially generate about $10.0 million of carbon credit revenues through 2021. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f3. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\nfor  the  GEF  component.  These  benefits  will  be  realized  by  encouraging  integrated  ecosystem \nmanagement  in  the  basin,  and  strengthening  conservation  of  globally  significant  biodiversity \nresources  in  two  provincial  nature  reserves  (PNRs):  (i)  Jin  Hua  Shan-Heng  Lingzi  Shan  PNR, \nhabitat  for  the  endemic  brown-eared  pheasant  (Crossoptilon  mantchuricum)  and  other  rare \nspecies;  and  (ii) Baiyangdian  Lake  Rare  Bird  PNR,  a  vital  stopover  along  the  East  Asian\u2013\nAustralasian flyway for  numerous species of rare and vulnerable migratory waterfowl (Map 7). \nThe proposed GEF financing will support six \u201cmodules,\u201d each of which is considered essential \nfor achieving the desired global environmental benefits. The specific activities to be undertaken \nfor  each  module  are  in  Appendix 6.  The  full-size  project  brief  for  the  GEF  Secretariat\u2019s \nconsideration  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  The  cofinancing  has  been  endorsed  by  the \nGovernment as part of its GEF biodiversity allocation, and it is due for GEF Counsel\u2019s approval \nby August 2008.  \n \n \n \n34. \nThe  capacity  of  county  and  IA  staff  to  implement  their  respective  subprojects  is \ninadequate.  A  detailed  plan  will  be  prepared  during  the  inception  phase  of  the  Project  to \ndetermine  the  requirements  for  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  as  well  as \ndevelop the strategy for their implementation. A variety of training programs will be initiated that \ninclude  on-the-job  training;  short-term  in-country  training  through  workshops,  study  tours,  and \nshort courses; and short-term overseas training through study tours and training courses. The \nstaff and institutional capacity assessment during project preparation revealed that training will \nbe  required  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  project  implementation,  (ii)  environmental  management \nand  safeguards,  (iii)  ecosystem  management  and  biodiversity  conservation,  (iv)  gender  and \ndevelopment,  (v)  financial  management,  and  (vi)  project  audit.  A  more  detailed  institutional \nassessment and training program is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n \n \nGiven  the  inadequate  staff  capacity  in  key  disciplines,  a  project  management  support \n35. \noffice,  complete  with  logistical  facilities  and  technical  staff,  has  been  provided  for  effective \nproject  implementation.  An  international  project  implementation  specialist  will  be  provided  to \nrender  technical  advice  to  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  and  project  implementation \nunits  (PIUs)  in  project  supervision  and  capacity  building  in  integrated  ecosystem  and  water \nresources management.  International  and  national  experts  in  the  following  disciplines  will  also \nbe  provided  to  support  project  management:  (i)  institutional/training  development;  (ii)  water \nresources  planning;  (iii) structural,  civil,  mechanical,  electrical,  wastewater,  solid  waste  and \ngeothermal  engineering;  (iv)  watershed  management;  (v)  resettlement  and  environmental \nmonitoring;  (vi)  procurement;  (vii) financial  management;  and  (viii)  forestry.  They  will  provide \ntechnical assistance to concerned BMG and county agencies in the various aspects of project \nimplementation,  including,  among  others,  community  organization  and  social  preparation, \nlivelihood  demonstration,  environmental  monitoring,  institutional  strengthening,  gender  and \ndevelopment, and project monitoring and evaluation, as necessary. Detailed terms of reference \nand a full list of experts are in Appendix 7. \n \nC. \n \n36. \nIn the PRC, like most other countries, the threat to the environment is multi-sectoral but \nthe response often follows a single-sector approach which is not always efficient. As elsewhere \nin the PRC, soil, water, and air pollution in Baiyangdian Basin is caused by the urban, industrial, \nand  agricultural  sectors.  The  agricultural  sector,  with  its  nonpoint  sources\u2014farm  chemicals \nrunoff,  animal  waste,  and  rural  domestic  wastewater\u2014contributes  more  pollution  than  other \nsectors.  Deforestation  causes  loss  in  biodiversity  by  destroying  wildlife  habitats.  Soil  erosion, \n\nProject Management Support \n\nSpecial Features \n\n4. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fmostly  caused  by  deforestation,  is  another  major  source  of  water  pollution.  This  Project \n\u201cintegrates\u201d  the  Government\u2019s  response  to  contain  pollution  in  the  basin  by  adopting  a  multi-\nsectoral,  multidisciplinary,  and  interagency  planning,  investment,  and  monitoring  approach. \nSeven different categories of investment under this Project will bring together agriculture, forest, \nwater resources, urban development, energy, and environmental protection bureaus of BMG to \ncoordinate  their  activities.  Through  the  IWM  subproject,  this  Project  will  also  (i)  integrate  the \nefficient  use  of  water  resources  between  two  sub-watersheds;  and  (ii)  supply  water  to  four \ndifferent end users\u2014the lake (biodiversity conservation); Baoding City (drinking water); Guohua \nDingzhou  Power  Plant  (industrial);  and  Baicaogou,  Hu,  Yimuquan,  Hucheng,  and  Xihuanti \nBaoding inner-city rivers (pollution control). Through these investment and activities, the Project \nwill  integrate  the  ecosystem  and  water  resources  management  that,  in  turn,  will  meet  the \nobjective  of  biodiversity  conservation.  Therefore,  this  Project  (i)  demonstrates  an  innovative \nintegrated  ecosystem  management  approach  to  bringing  about  improvements  in  water \nresources management within the basin; (ii) focuses on the critical need to conserve wetlands, \none  of  PRC\u2019s  most  important  and  vulnerable  ecosystems;  and  (iii)  fits  well  with  an  umbrella \nprogram for biodiversity conservation currently being formulated by the PRC. \n \n37.  While  the  infrastructure  interventions  of  the  Project  are  designed  primarily  to  improve \nwaste  management,  reduce  water  and  air  pollution,  provide  clean  energy,  and  improve  the \nreliability of water supplies for communities in the basin, the GEF component will complement \nthese improvements by raising awareness and promoting the involvement of local communities \nin  natural  resources  management.  The  Project  has  taken  the  initiative  to  apply  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism to earn carbon credits under the CED subproject. There is a potential \nto arrange upfront financing of $5.4 million through the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund. In line with the \nProject\u2019s  social  development  objective,  Xiong  County  has  agreed  to  share  50%  of  the  carbon \ncredit revenues with the Xiong County poverty reduction agency to expand its activities. This will \nbe an incremental amount over and above the prevailing budget of the Agency.  \n \nAnother  subject  of  increasing  concern  for  the  PRC  is  conservation  of  the  nation\u2019s \n38. \nvulnerable  wetland  resources.  In  response,  the  Government  recently  (2007)  created  a  special \nOffice  of  Wetland  Conservation  and  Management  within  the  State  Forest  Administration. \nBaiyangdian  Lake  has  been  recognized  in  Agenda  21  as  one  of  the  nation\u2019s  most  critical \nwetland areas. It is expected that restoration of the wetland ecosystem in Baiyangdian Lake will \nbring about significant economic and environmental benefits. The China Biodiversity Partnership \nFramework, currently being formulated by UNDP with support from GEF, has identified several \npriority themes, including (among others) reduction of biodiversity loss in protected areas, and \nmainstreaming  of  biodiversity  conservation  in  socioeconomic  sectors.  This  Project  will  further \nthese objectives, so it is consistent with the framework initiative currently under development. \n \nD. \n \n39. \nThe total project investment is estimated at about $273.4 million equivalent. It includes \nprovisions  for  physical  and  price  contingencies  which  will  be  shouldered  by  the  Government, \ninterest  during  construction,  and  a  commitment  fee,  and  is  spread  over  an  implementation \nperiod  of  5  years.  Physical  contingencies  are  estimated  at  10%  of  all  base  costs  while  price \ncontingencies are based on ADB\u2019s estimates of local and foreign currency escalation factors. A \nsummary of project cost estimates by component is in Table 1.

Interest  during  construction  has  been \ncomputed at the 5-year forward London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), with a spread of 0.2%.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nE. \n \n40. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100.00  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%/annum  and  such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Government has provided \nADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility \nand the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any advice or communication from ADB. \nIn addition to the loan from ADB, which will finance about 36.6% of total costs, a proposed grant \nof $2,975,000 from GEF will finance 1.1% of project costs. The proposed GEF grant will finance \nall  the  activities  of  the  biodiversity  conservation  component  and  part  of  the  institutional \nstrengthening  and  project  management  support  components.  ADB  will  administer  the  GEF \ngrant. The proposed GEF financing will be provided to the IAs as grant. The Borrower will be the \nPRC, which will relend the loan proceeds amounting to $100.00 million to the Hebei provincial \ngovernment  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  Hebei  provincial \ngovernment  will  onlend  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  BMG,  which  will  onlend  to  city,  township, \ncounty governments. The city, township, and county governments then will onlend to IAs. Each \nthe \nIA  will  be  a  sub-borrower  and  will  enter \ncity/township/county  government,  commission,  or  autonomous  zone  for  its  share  of  the  ADB \nloan funds and will be responsible for its repayment. All relending and onlending will be on the \nsame terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The IAs will assume the foreign exchange \nand  interest  rate  variation  risks  for  the  ADB  loan.  Counterpart  funds  will  come  from  self-\nfinancing  by  the  IAs.  Table  2  shows  a  summary  of  the  project  financing  plan.

In the case of the proposed grant \nfunding  from  GEF,  the  financing  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  GEF  Council  in \nAugust 2008. To avoid any project delay, the Board is requested to approve the administration \nof  the  proposed  grant,  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2,975,000,  which  is \nexpected  to  be  confirmed  by  GEF  subsequent  to  the  date  of  Board  approval.  Approval  of  the \nGEF grant will be reported to the Board in accordance with the standard reporting procedures. If \nGEF  does  not  approve  grant  financing,  the  GEF-financed  activities  of  the  Project  will  not  be \nimplemented  under  the  Project.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  make  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB to cover the funding shortfall. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \nThe 22 subprojects will be implemented in 13 counties by 24 IAs. BMG, acting through \n42. \nBaoding  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (BDRC),  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the \nProject.  BDRC  has  set  up  a  central  PMO  with  15  staff  to  implement  the  Project.17  A  full-time \nproject  director  has  been  appointed  to  head  the  PMO.  The  key  PMO  staff  have  expertise  in \nfinancial  management;  civil  and  mechanical  engineering;  water  resources,  environmental, \necosystem, and project management; social development; and forestry. Each county will set up \na PIU at their respective financial bureaus. PIUs will be headed by project coordinators, who will \nbe focal points for all project-related activities with the PMO. IAs will engage the relevant design \ninstitutes to prepare detailed subproject designs. These detailed designs will be reviewed by a \npanel that will be assisted by an independent consulting firm. To assist IAs in the procurement \nprocess\u2014i.e.,  preparing  bidding  documents,  call  for  tenders,  and  bid  evaluation\u2014specialized \nfirms  will  be  engaged.  To  monitor  the  progress  and  quality  of  works,  construction  supervision \nfirms will be engaged. The PMO staff will assist IAs in supervising the inputs of design institutes \nand the specialized consulting firms. To coordinate the project activities among line bureaus and \nIAs, BDRC will set up a project Leading Group that will meet quarterly for the first 2 years and \nsemiannually  for  the  remaining  project  period.  The  relevant  IAs  will  establish  project  land \nacquisition  resettlement  units  for  supervising  implementation,  continuing  public  consultation, \n                                                 \n17 The PMO was set up in October 2007. The PRC Resident Mission has provided initial training to the PMO/PIU staff \n\non procurement, disbursement, and project administration through workshops in December 2007.  \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fresponding  to  grievances,  and  reporting  progress.  The  grievance  redress  procedures  are  set \nout in the resettlement plans (RPs). To redress any other grievances, one staff member in each \nPIU  and  PMO  will  be  nominated  to  receive  complaints  and  arrange  to  provide  an  appropriate \nresponse  or  take  necessary  actions  and  follow  up  until  the  concern  has  been  resolved.  If  the \nproblem  cannot  be  resolved  by  the  PMO,  the  complainant  can  make  a  formal  grievance  in \naccordance  with  State  Council  Decree  431,  2005.  A  project  website  will  be  set  up  to \ndisseminate information about the project scope, implementation progress, public consultation, \nand  grievance  redress  process  and  updates.  The  project  organization  chart  is  presented  in \nAppendix 9. Details of the organizational structure for the PMO/PIUs and terms of reference for \ntheir respective staff are in Supplementary Appendix E.   \n \n \n \n43. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 10.  \n \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years from October 2008 to 30 September 2013. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n44. \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated \nto  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  shall  be \nprocured  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Contracts  for  goods  and \nworks estimated to cost equal to or less than the above ICB values,  but more than $100,000, \nshall be procured through national competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the PRC \nTendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to clarifications and modifications agreed with ADB. \nContracts for goods and works estimated to cost $100,000 or less shall be procured using the \nshopping  procedures,  and  those  for  less  than  $10,000  through  direct  contracting.  A \nprocurement  plan,  setting  out  an  indicative  list  of  all  procurement  packages,  the  procurement \nmethods to be used, and the timing of ADB review is in Appendix 11. The plan will be reviewed \nand updated on an annual basis. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) will be included in all procurement documents and contracts. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n45. \nThe  Project  will  finance  two  consulting  packages.  Package  A,  for  236  person-months, \nfinanced  by  the  loan,  will  comprise  three  international  experts  for  25  person-months  and  14 \nnational  experts  for  211 person-months.  A  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  provide  these \nservices.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  the  selection,  contract  negotiations,  and  contract \nmanagement.  Package  B,  financed  by  the  proposed  GEF  grant,  for  180  person-months,  will \ncomprise  eight  international  experts  for  38  person-months  and  nine  national  experts  for  142 \nperson-months. ADB will recruit the firm and the PMO will negotiate and manage the contract. \nIn  selecting  these  firms,  quality  and  cost-based  selection  (80:20)  will  be  used,  and  the  short-\nlisted firms will be required to submit full technical proposals for contract budgets of more than \n$1.0 million. A summary of consulting packages is in Appendix 7. All recruitment will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time).  \n \n \n \n46. \nBMG has requested retroactive financing for the Yi County WTP for a maximum amount \nequivalent  to  $3,800,000  or  3.8%  of  the  loan.  As  the  processing  of  this  loan  has  been \nunexpectedly  delayed  by  almost  8  months,  ADB  has  advised  that  retroactive  financing  could \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n5.  \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fapply  to  expenditures  incurred  before  loan  effectiveness  and  within  20  months  prior  to  the \nsigning  of  the  loan  agreement.  All  contracts  proposed  for  retroactive  financing  will  be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants.  The  Government  and  BMG  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  the \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nfor  mitigating  corruption \n\n \n47. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  BMG  and  the  IAs. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB and GEF in connection \nwith  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  BMG;  the  IAs;  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants  and  other \nservice  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  project  design  and  implementation \narrangements  provide \nrisks.  Risks  associated  with  project \nmanagement,  including  procurement  and  disbursement,  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  engaging  an \ninternational  consultant  and  a  national  consultant  to  advise  and  assist  in  the  procurement  of \ngoods  and  services,  and  the  engagement  of  other  consultants;  (ii)  introducing  a  dual  signing \nsystem in which the civil works contractor awarded the contract will also sign an anticorruption \ncontract  with  the  employer;  and  (iii)  periodical  inspection  by  the  PMO  of  the  contractor\u2019s \nactivities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements.  In  furtherance  of  the  principles  of \ntransparency  and  accountability,  BMG  will  cause  the  PMO  to  set  up  and  develop  a  project \nwebsite that describes the Project in order to provide the public with information on the Project \nincluding  setting  out  (i)  a  summary  of  the  audited  financial  statements  of  the  Project,  and \n(ii) tracking of procurement contract awards in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nBMG  will  ensure  that  each  IA  establishes  financial  control  and  management  arrangements \ncompatible with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Financial Governance and Management of Investment \nProjects Financed by ADB18 and ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n48. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. To facilitate project implementation and funds flow, an imprest account will be set up \nin a commercial bank acceptable to ADB upon loan effectiveness and a separate account will \nlikewise  be opened  for  GEF  grant  funds.  Both  accounts  will  be  managed  by  Baoding  Finance \nBureau on behalf of BMG. The initial advance deposited in the imprest account will not exceed \n6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The direct \npayment  procedures  will  apply  for  the  large  works  contracts.  If  the  Government  initially  funds \neligible  expenditures  from  its  own  resources,  the  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used.  To \nexpedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  the  documentation  process,  the  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure  will  be  followed  for  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  and  for \nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000/individual  payment.  Payments \nin excess of the statement of expenditures ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished \nbased on the full supporting documentation process. To expedite project implementation, BMG \nrequested  ADB  to  approve  retroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenditures  up  to  $3.8  million \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \n\nManila.  \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f(equivalent  to  3.8%  of  the  ADB  loan),  to  be  incurred  prior  to  loan  effectiveness  but  within  a \nmaximum of 20 months before the signing of the Loan Agreement. \n \n49. \nThe  PMO  requires  additional  capacity  and  experience  to  deal  efficiently  with  the \noperation  and  withdrawal  procedures  necessary  for  the  operation  of  the  imprest  accounts. \nAccordingly, assistance and training will be provided so that PMO staff can expedite loan and \nGEF  grant  disbursements.  An  assessment  of  the  financial  management  capability  of  the \nFinancial  Bureau  of  BMG  and  IAs,  and  specific  arrangements  for  managing  the project  funds, \nare provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n8. \n \n50. \nAll  agencies  (PMO,  PIUs,  and  IAs)  involved  in  project  implementation  will  maintain \nrecords and accounts that identify goods and services from loan proceeds and the GEF grant, \nfinancing resources received, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. These accounts will \nbe  established  and  maintained \nin  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and \ninternationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  The  PMO  will  review  and  consolidate  these \naccounts and have them audited annually in accordance with sound accounting practices by the \nsovereign  audit  agency  of  the  Government  or  other  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audit \nreport will include a statement verifying whether or not the funds disbursed by ADB were used \nfor the purposes for which they were provided, as well as the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the \nimprest account and statement of expenditures procedures. Copies of the audited accounts and \nauditor\u2019s  report  will  be submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  consolidated  quarterly  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered  during  the  period,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  proposed \nprogram of activities, and progress expected for the next quarter. Both the loan and GEF grant \nwill be covered in these reports. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMO \nwill  submit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  that  describes  the  achievements  in  relation  to  the \nProject\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs.  \n \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n9. \n \n51. \nTo  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Project  in  achieving  the  planned  outcome  and  outputs, \nthe PMO will establish and maintain a project performance management system (PPMS), which \nwill be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, \nschedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  The  PPMS  will  adopt  the  following  agreed \nindicators:  (i)  physical  progress  of  subproject  implementation,  (ii)  results  of  the  capacity \ndevelopment program, (iii) water quality and quantity improvements in the lake and other water \nbodies,  (iv)  improvement  in  biodiversity  conservation,  and  (v)  social  development.  At  project \ninception, the PMO, in consultation with each IA, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures \nto  generate  data  systematically  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  project  activities;  and  the \nsocioeconomic, health, and environmental indicators to measure project impacts.  \n \n52. \nThe PMO will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable targets, firm up monitoring \nand  recording  arrangements,  and  establish  systems  and  procedures  no  later  than  6  months \nafter project implementation begins. Baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime intervals by IAs to the PMO, including annual reporting on the environmental management \nplan (EMP). The PMO will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating reported data through \nits  management  information  system,  and  for  reporting  outcomes  to  ADB  through  quarterly \nprogress reports.  \n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n53. \nIn  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  project  performance  will  be  reviewed  at  least  once  a \nyear  jointly  by  ADB,  the  Government,  and  BMG.  The  review  will  assess  implementation \nperformance  and  achievement  of  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress, \nidentify issues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan \nfor their resolution. ADB, the Government, and BMG will undertake a midterm review to assess \nimplementation  status  and  take  appropriate  measures\u2014including  modification  of  scope  and \nimplementation arrangements, and reallocation of loan and grant proceeds, as appropriate\u2014to \nachieve the project objectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n54. \nThe Project will improve quality of life, ecosystem, and biodiversity in the basin. Twenty-\ntwo complementing subproject investments will be supported to mitigate water and air pollution \nthat  will  subsequently  improve  environmental  and  ecological  conditions  in  the  basin.  Thirteen \nWTPs  will  significantly  reduce  organic  pollution  loading  of  the  lake  as  well  as  improve  water \nquality in its extensive river network. Three WSSs will increase the availability of potable water \nas  well  as  improve  sanitation  and  hygiene  among  project  beneficiaries.  Reforestation  of \nAngezhuang  Reservoir  and  Baiyangdian  Lake  and  rehabilitation  of  Huanghuangou  watershed \nwill improve the water retention capacity of these subproject areas. These interventions are also \nexpected  to  facilitate  biodiversity  conservation  and  improve  the  integrity  of  the  basin\u2019s \necosystem.  The  Project  will  also  generate  significant  social  and  economic  benefits,  such  as \nimproved  living  conditions  and  livelihood  opportunities  for  communities  living  within  the  basin \nand  especially  by  the  lake.  The  flood  control  subproject  is  expected  to  significantly  reduce \ndamage to public and private infrastructure as well as to agricultural production due to flooding \nthat have increased in frequency in recent years. The reservoir link-canal subproject will enable \nthe recharging of the Yimuquan aquifer with clean  water, and prevent the intrusion of polluted \nwater  from  Caohe  drainage  area  during  low  water  table  levels.  Mitigation  of  this  problem  will \nreduce  the  incidence  of  stomach  and  intestinal  diseases, which  are  likely  to  occur  without  the \nProject.  The  geothermal  energy  subproject\u2014an  alternative  to  using  coal  for  providing  space-\nheating  to  domestic,  commercial,  and  industrial  consumers\u2014will  contribute  to  energy  cost \nsavings as well as result in reductions in emission of air pollutants, with positive impacts on the \nenvironment  and  health  of  affected  communities.  Benefits  from  GEF  interventions  under  the \nbiodiversity  and  integrated  ecosystem  management  component  will  emanate  from  improved \nwildlife and overall environmental conditions within the basin.  \n \n55. \nThe  WTPs  and  WSSs  will  benefit  about  1.12  million  people  (or  over  416,000 \nhouseholds),  out  of  a  total  of  about  6.65  million  people  living  within  the  drainage  area. \nImprovement  in  water  supply  will  reduce  the  incidence  of  stomach  and  intestinal  diseases  for \nover  260,000  people.  About  10,000  ha  of  farmland  will  be  protected  from  soil  erosion, \nparticularly  during  the  rainy  months,  with  the  reforestation  of  the  Angezhuang  Reservoir  area. \nThis will benefit a total of about 18,750 farm households and will prevent an annual loss in crop \ndamage  of  about  $2.2  million.  At  full  development  of  the  Baiyangdian  lakeside  reforestation \nsubproject,  a  significant  increase  in  tourist  activities  will  generate  about  $585,000  annually. \nRehabilitation  of  Huanghuangou  watershed  will  reduce  dust  pollution  by  about  136,000 \ntons/year, and prevent further contamination of surface and subterranean water, with a positive \nimpact  on  the  health  of  about  500,000  people  in  Baoding  City.  Health  benefits  will  also  be \nderived from the reallocation of water resources for about 700,000 people in Baoding City and Li \nCounty. The construction of flood control facilities in Anxin County will protect and reduce flood \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fdamage  to  an  area  of  about  20  km2  including  about  9,300  ha  farmland  (about 5,000  farm \nhouseholds),  about  1,152  m2 of  residential  facilities,  about  30  small  enterprises,  and \nthe municipal facilities in Anxin County. The incidence of respiratory diseases will be reduced by \n20%  among  the  target  population  (about  240,000  people)  who  will  benefit  from  the  shift  from \ncoal  to  geothermal  energy.  The  CED  subproject  will  save  about  60,000  tons  of  coal  annually \nand  result  in  reduced  incidence  of  SO2  (about  1,000  tons/year)  and  total  suspended  particles \n(about 500 tons/year) emissions. \n \n56. \nProject  activities  will  enhance  the  environment  and  improve  the  ecosystem  within \nBaiyangdian  Basin.  Biodiversity  conservation  benefits  will  accrue  through  restored  habitat  and \nprotection  for  wild  plants  and  animals,  including  192  bird  species  of  which  at  least  six  are  of \nglobal significance. \n \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n1. \n \n57. \nFinancial analyses were undertaken for each of the 19 revenue-generating subprojects, \nbased on their respective revenue and cost streams over a 25-year period. Revenue from the \n13  WTPs  and  3 WSSs  will  be  derived  from  subproject-specific  operating  capacity  at  the \nspecified  tariff/m3  charged  to  consumers.  The  geothermal  energy  subproject  will  generate \nrevenues by providing space-heating services to about 1.65 million m2 of floor area in different \ntypes of buildings, about 525,000 m2 of public baths and swimming pools, about 100,000 m2 of \nhotel  facilities,  and  drinking  water  supply  of  about  250,000  m3.  The  Angezhuang  Reservoir \nreforestation  subproject  will  derive  revenue  from  the  sale  of  timber  while  the  Baiyangdian \nlakeside  reforestation  subproject  will  generate  revenue  from  timber  sales  and  tourism  as  well. \nFor  the  remaining  three  subprojects\u2014IWM,  ash/waste-dump  rehabilitation,  and  flood  control\u2014\ncosts are likewise estimated but no financial revenues are quantified. Financial internal rates of \nreturn (FIRRs) and other financial indicators were estimated for 19 subprojects. The estimated \nFIRRs are in the range of 7.6\u201315.9%, above the weighted average cost of capital of 2.3%. This \nreflects their financial viability as well as ability to recover both investment and operating costs. \nHowever, the FIRRs are found to be sensitive to variations in revenue and costs. More detailed \nfinancial analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n2. \n \n58. \nThe  national  policy  for  pollution  control  endorses  the  use  of  cost-effective  wastewater \nmanagement measures to achieve overall treatment targets. The least-cost analysis for each of \nthe 13 WTPs indicates that the chosen technology entails the lowest cost compared with other \ntechnologies  available.  Separate  economic  analyses  are  also  carried  out  for  all  of  the \n22 subprojects  and  the  whole  Project.  Benefit  estimates  are  based  on  data  that  reflect  the \ncurrent  situation  and  on  conservative  assessments  of  future  scenarios  without  the  Project. \nHealth  benefits  arising  from  WTPs  and  WSSs  are  quantified  based  on  reductions  in  medical \ncosts for about 1.66 million people, mainly from stomach and intestinal diseases and hepatitis, \ncaused  by  improved  water  quality.  Health  benefits  resulting  from  reduced  incidence  in \nrespiratory diseases and subsequently in medical costs, affecting about 240,000 people, which \nwill  accrue  to  the  clean  energy  subproject,  are  also  quantified.  Energy  savings  resulting  from \nreduction  in  coal  use  (about  60,000  tons/year),  subsequent  reduction  in  SO2  (about \n1,000 tons/year) and coal dust (about 500 tons/year) emissions are quantified and incorporated \nin the economic analysis of the clean energy subproject. Health benefits are also quantified for \nthe  ash/waste  dump  rehabilitation  subproject,  which  will  reduce  dust  pollution  and  prevent \ncontamination of surface and subterranean water with a positive impact on the health of about \n500,000  people  in  Baoding  City.  Health  benefits  will  likewise  accrue  to  the  IWM  subproject, \nwhich will impact on about 0.7 million people in Baoding City and Li County. Benefits generated \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\fby the reforestation subprojects are quantified based on estimates of annual revenues from sale \nof  timber  and  increased  tourist  activity  as  well  as  from  prevention  of  losses  in  crop  damage \ncaused by soil erosion. Reductions in annual flood damage caused by the construction of flood \ncontrol facilities served as the basis for estimating the economic benefits from the urban flood \ncontrol  subproject.  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  estimated  for  each  of  the \n22 subprojects  are  in  the  range  of  14.5\u201323.6%,  greater  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital of 12%. \n \n59. \nThe  project  EIRR  is  estimated  at  about  17%  with  an  economic  net  present  value  of \n$190 million.  Switching  values  indicate  that  benefits  should  decline  by  not  more  than  19%  to \nmaintain the project EIRR at 12%. Economic costs, on the other hand, should not increase by \nmore than 23%. Simultaneous decrease in benefits and increase in costs should be at 10%. A \n1-year delay in project benefits will result in an EIRR of 13.7%. More detailed economic analysis \nis in Appendix 12. \n \n\n3. \n\nRisks \n\n \n60. \nThe  Project  will  adopt  an  integrated  approach  to  address  ecosystem  and  water \nresources  issues,  and  for  the  planning  and  implementation  of  project  activities.  Line  bureaus \nand  counties  in  Baoding  Municipality  do  not  often  coordinate  their  operations.  In  the  past, \neconomic growth has taken priority over environmental management. The frequency of drought \nyears  has  also  been  on  the  rise  over  the  past  two  decades  and  climate  change  may  further \nreduce water availability. If the constraints underlying these risks are not addressed, the project \ninvestments  may  not  achieve  the  intended  impact.  These  risks  can  be  mitigated  in  part  by \nproject  interventions,  i.e.,  (i)  inculcating  integrated  planning,  monitoring,  and  enforcing \nappropriate  policies  and  regulations;  and  (ii)  building  staff  capacity  and  strengthening \ninstitutions.  Other  risks  include  (i)  lack  of  understanding  of  ADB  policies  and  procedures, \n(ii) changes in PMO staff, (iii) lengthy procurement decision making, and (iv) procurement fraud \nand  corruption.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the  Project  will  provide  technical  and  management \nadvisory support and training, particularly during the first 2 years of implementation. Delays in \nsubproject  completion  can  also  jeopardize  project  investment.  Implementation  of  the  IWM \nsubproject  needs  to  be  monitored  carefully  so  that  it  is  completed  before  the  Government\u2019s \nSouth\u2013North Water Transfer Project takes over the Sha Aqueduct. The Government realizes the \nimportance of water supply to the lake and will ensure its uninterrupted flow by coordinating the \nimplementation of both undertakings. \n \nThe  variety  in  project  investments  will  limit  its  financial  and  economic  risks.  The  water \n61. \ntreatment, supply, and infrastructure investments will use established technologies and designs. \nSimilarly, the reforestation subprojects will use indigenous species and modern techniques. The \nbiodiversity  conservation  activities  have  been  designed  and  will  be  implemented  in  close \nconsultation with local communities. Therefore, the overall project risk is low. \n \n\n4. \n\nSustainability \n\n \nThe Project\u2019s overall sustainability is assured as 19 of the 22 subprojects will generate \n62. \nrevenues and become financially viable. The other three subprojects\u2014IWM, SWM, and UFM\u2014 \nwill  also  generate  considerable  benefits,  and  their  respective  IAs  will  be  able  to  provide  for \nappropriate  operation  and  maintenance.  Therefore,  the  overall  fiscal  implications  for  the \nGovernment will be limited. The single largest subproject, SWM (with 23% of the project cost), \nwill  clean  up  prime  urban  land  and  turn  it  into  eco-theme  park\u2014encouraging  urban  and \nindustrial  development  on  its  periphery.  Similarly,  WTPs  and  WSSs  (39%  of  the  project  cost) \nand CED (7% of the project cost) will generate adequate revenues to pay for the operation as \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fwell as investment costs. All the IAs are financially sound and fully responsible for the effective \noperation of project infrastructure.  \n \nB. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nSocial Benefits \n\n \n63. \n In  Baiyangdian  Basin,  the  ecosystem  plays  an  important  role  in  poverty  reduction. \nConversely,  poverty  has  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  lake\u2019s  ecosystem.  There  are  39  in-lake \nvillages and another 44 around the lake. About 200,000 people live in the in-lake villages, and \nas many live in its peripheral zones. The in-lake households are the poorest of the poor in the \nwhole basin, with per capita annual income of CNY627 ($90)\u2014Hebei government has listed 24 \nof the 39 in-lake villages as \u201cpoverty villages\u201d. However, the in-lake villages are depopulating at \nthe rate of 0.7%/annum, as young people migrate to nearby towns in search of better jobs in the \nnonfarm sectors. The in-lake villages are also the most polluted as they often dispose of their \nsolid and animal waste and domestic wastewater directly into the lake. Many make a living by \nrunning duck/fish farms on the lake, which create further pollution with animal feed and waste.   \n \n64. \nRural  poor,  both  in-lake  and  mountain  communities,  who  earn  subsistence  from \necosystem-based  activities,  are  most  vulnerable  to  the  loss  of  such  resources.  Given  the \npersistent  trend  of  out-migration  of  males  to  urban  areas,  these  sources  of  income  are \npredominantly  supported  by  women  and  children.  This  includes  undertaking  small-scale  fish \nfarming, livestock rearing, and collecting ecosystem products, i.e., reeds, that may be sold for \ncash. The Project has ensured that needs and concerns voiced by local communities, especially \nwomen,  are  reflected  in  the  design  and  implementation  arrangements  of  all  its  components. \nModalities  will  be  adopted  to  ensure  that  women  benefit  from  the  employment  opportunities \ngenerated by the Project. In addition, the Project will work\u2014through its GEF component\u2014with \nselected communities  to  (i)  describe  site-specific  contributing  factors  to  the  degradation  of  the \necosystem; (ii) formulate environmentally-friendly solutions to the identified problems, with focus \non those that offer opportunities for revenue generation; and (iii) pilot test selected projects that \nlead to environmental improvement and revenue generation. The outcome of the component will \nbe to improve living standards; reduce livelihood dependency on the ecosystem; and contribute \nto  water  demand  management,  pollution  control,  and  conservation  of  natural  resources. \nThrough  the  CED  subproject,  the  Project  has  taken  the  initiative  to  apply  the  Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  to  earn  carbon  credits.  In  line  with  the  Project\u2019s  social  development \nobjective, Xiong County has agreed to share 50% of the carbon credit revenues with the Xiong \nCounty  poverty  reduction  agency  to  expand  its  activities.  This  will  be  an  incremental  amount \nover and above the prevailing budget of the Agency. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 13 and the gender and social action plan is in Appendix 14. \n \n \n \n65. \n The  RPs  have  been  prepared  for  17  subprojects;  the  other  five  subprojects  will  not \nrequire any resettlement. Most of the RPs are classified category B impacts, whereby less than \n200  persons  will  be  seriously  affected.  Permanent  land  acquisition  for  the  total  Project  is \nestimated  to  be  293  ha,  of  which  71  ha  is  farmland;  this  will  cause  partial  land  loss  (20%  on \naverage) for 4,508 persons. The IWM subproject will have the largest impact and affect 2,770 \npersons  (nearly  50%  of  the  total  affected  persons).  However,  even  for  this  subproject,  the \nresettlement  impacts  will  not  be  serious  and  the  income  loss  can  be  restored  through  cash \ncompensation and improved irrigation. In total, the Project will require the displacement of only \n13  houses  with  49  persons,  who  will  be  compensated  and  relocated  nearby.  Nine  enterprises \nwill  also  be  affected,  but  only  two  small  private  enterprises  need  to  be  totally  relocated.  Each \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n\n2. \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\fenterprise will be compensated and workers will not be adversely affected. The RPs have also \naddressed the temporary impacts caused during construction to 145 ha land (of which 27 ha is \nfarmland)  and  1,700  persons.  For  the  construction  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  pipeline \nnetworks, mitigation measures will be taken to avoid or minimize disturbance to residents and \nshops.  Compensation  will  be  provided  if  disturbance  causes  direct  impact  or  extends  beyond \n2 weeks. Local officials, village leaders, and affected persons were closely consulted during the \nfeasibility study stage to avoid or minimize adverse impacts and to formulate compensation and \nrehabilitation measures. The estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is $48.5 million \n(including contingencies, taxes, and fees), 18% of the total project cost. \n \n66. \nThe  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  resettlement  planning, \nsupervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  The  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  RPs, \nfinancing  the  costs,  and  internal  reporting  to  the  PMO.  The  IAs  have  disclosed  resettlement \ninformation booklets. The RPs will be distributed to the relevant townships and made accessible \nto affected villagers, and the RPs have been uploaded to the ADB website. Since these RPs are \nbased  on  feasibility  studies,  they  will  have  to  be  rechecked  and,  where  necessary,  updated \nbased  on  the  final  design,  disclosed  to  APs,  and  resubmitted  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to  the \nstart of civil works. The summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 15. \n \n67. \nNational consultancy services are required for the external monitoring and evaluation of \nresettlement  implementation.  This  will  be  financed  by  each  IA  but  will  be  supervised  by  the \nPMO. A domestic institute, acceptable to ADB, will be engaged by the PMO (terms of reference \nare in Supplementary Appendix G). ADB requirements for resettlement monitoring are stipulated \nin the RPs and included in the loan covenants. \n \n \n \n68. \nThe  overall  project  classification  is  category  A  because  of  the  expected  impact  of  the \nIWM  and  SWM  subprojects.  Environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  for  these  two  and  initial \nenvironmental  examination  for  the  other  20  subprojects  were  prepared.  Based  on  these \nanalyses, a consolidated summary environmental impact assessment (SEIA) was prepared and \ncirculated  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  and  uploaded  on  the  ADB  website  on  1  June  2007.  The \nanalysis indicates that, by integrating ecosystem and water resources management, the Project \nwill have a significant positive environmental impact on Baiyangdian Basin\u2014especially the lake. \nPotential  negative  environmental  impacts  associated  with  some  subprojects  have  been \nidentified  and  can  be  mitigated  to  the  point  that  there  are  no  potentially  significant  residual \nenvironmental  impacts.  Appropriate  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring  plans  have  been  prepared.  The  appropriate  alternative  analysis  and  public \nconsultation  have  been  conducted.  The  possible  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated \nwith the subprojects will be prevented or minimized to an acceptable level if the EMP set out in \nthe SEIA (Supplementary Appendix H) is implemented effectively.  \n \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n3. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  Hebei  provincial  government, \n\n \n69. \nand BMG have given specific assurances which are incorporated in the legal documents.19 \n \n\n                                                 \n19 The full list of assurances is included in the loan and project agreements. \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\fA. \n\nFunding from Global Environment Facility \n\n70. \nIn  the  event  the  GEF  grant  funding  cannot  be  obtained,  (i)  the  support  for  biodiversity \nconservation  component,  and  (ii)  the  relevant  training  and  consulting  activities  under  the \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  project  management  support  components  shall  not  be  financed \nunder  the  Project.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  make  other  necessary  arrangements \nacceptable to ADB to cover the funding shortfall. \n \nB. \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n\nBMG, through the relevant county governments and IAs, will ensure that:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nall land and rights-of-way required by the Project are made available in a timely \nmanner;

The lake lies in the middle reaches \nof  the  Daqing  River  basin  and  discharges  into  the  Bohai  Gulf,  Yellow  Sea.  Much  of  the \nBaiyangdian Basin, totaling 31,500 square kilometers (km2) lies within Baoding Municipality and \nall of the lake body is located in its two Anxin and Xiong counties (Map 1). Historically, the lake \nserved many environmental and economic purposes and was described as the \u201ckidney\u201d of the \nnorthern PRC. Because of its strategic position as a sink in the Daiqing River basin, the lake is a \ncritical  floodwater  retention,  rainfall  inflows,  and  surface  runoffs  for  about  72%  of  the  basin\u2019s \narea.  Specifically,  it  regulates  floodwater  discharges  and  moderates  waterlogging.  It  also \ntransports  nutrients  that  help  contribute  to  the  purification  of  water  and  the  regeneration  of \nnutrients. The lake is also economically important, especially for the more than 200,000 people \nliving  in  and  around  the  lake\u2019s  wetlands,  providing  them  with  their  main  sources  of  livelihood \n(e.g., freshwater  fishery,  reed  production,  and  tourism  services);  water  for  drinking  and \nirrigation; and major transportation routes. The open water and aquatic beds of the lake serve \nas spawning grounds and feeding habitats for a diverse array of fish and other animal species. \nAs a large body of water, the lake also moderates the local and regional temperature and thus \nhas an effect on the microclimate of its surroundings. \n \n2. \nThe  lake  and  its  upper  watershed  in  the  Taiheng  mountains  support  significant \nbiodiversity of regional and global significance within the Daqing River basin. The lake and its \nassociated  wetlands  are  primarily  important  as  a  refueling  site  for  migratory  birds  on  the  East \nAsian\u2013Australasian  flyway.  Seven  globally-threatened  bird  species  are  regularly  sighted  in  the \narea.  The  Taiheng  mountains,  which  contain  most  of  the  last  remaining  secondary  forests  in \nBaoding  Municipality,  support  a  wide  range  of  rare  and  endemic  animals  such  as  the  brown-\neared  pheasant  Crossoptilon  mantchuricum,  grey-sided  thrush  Turdus  feae,  leopard  Panthera \npardus, and golden takin Budorcas taxicolor. The Taiheng mountains are also recognized as a \ncenter of plant endemism in the PRC.  \n \nIn  the  last  4  decades,  many  functions  and  values  of  the  lake  have  been  eroded. \n3. \nConstruction  of  over  90  reservoirs  (4  of  them  large)  in  the  upstream  has  led  to  a  dramatic \ndecline in water inflows and surface runoffs into the lake, from an average of 1.73 billion cubic \nmeters  (m3)  of  water  discharging  into  the  lake  in  the  1960s,  down  to  0.065  billion  m3  in  2002. \nSediment load had also decreased from 7.1 billion m3 in the 1960s to just 1.0 billion m3 by 1999.  \n \n4. \nIncreased water demand for irrigation, industry, energy, and residential uses has been a \nmajor  reason  for  the  construction  of  these  reservoirs.  With  the  demand  for  water  exceeding \nsupply in the Daqing River basin, the frequencies of no or low inflows to the lake have become \nmore  acute,  especially  during  \u201cdry\u201d  years.  To  compound  existing  water  demands,  population \ngrowth  and  expanded  agricultural  and  industrial  activities  in  the  upstream  and  within  the  lake \nareas have increased wastewater discharges, pollutants, and sediments from these sectors into \nthe lake. It is estimated that half of the pollution sources originate from upstream, while the other \nhalf comes from the more than 200,000 people living in and around the lake.  \n \n5. \nA  body  of  water  is  assessed  to  be  polluted  when  the  water  does  not  meet  the  criteria \nrequired  for  its  designated  use  or  function.  Water  pollutants  can  be  chemical,  physical,  or \nbiological  in  nature.  In  the  PRC,  water  uses  are  classified  in  five  categories:  (i)  class  I, \nheadwaters of major rivers and water bodies in nature reserves; (ii) class II, centralized water \nsupply (level I), habitats of endangered and rare species, and spawning and feeding grounds of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n Appendix 3 \n\n29\n\n   \n\nfish; (iii) class III, centralized water supply (level II),  fish wintering grounds, routes of migratory \nspecies,  aquaculture  areas,  and  swimming  areas;  (iv)  class  IV,  industrial  use,  and  non-direct-\ncontact  water-based  recreation;  and  (v)  class  V,  for  irrigation  and  landscaping.  There  is  an \nongoing  program  to  classify/reclassify  water  bodies  such  as  rivers,  lakes,  reservoirs,  oceans, \netc.  according  to  type  of  functional  use,  based  on  a  set  of  criteria  that  will  be  applied \nconsistently nationwide. Baiyangdian Lake, under the program, has been classified class III in \nview of its importance to migratory birds, potential for aquaculture, and human use. \n \n6. \nNational  standards  for  assessing  water  quality  contain  22  parameters  which  measure \nthe  presence  of  pollutants  such  as  biochemicals,  e.g.,  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD), \nbiochemical  oxygen  demand  (BOD),  nitrogen,  phosporus;  heavy  metals  (e.g.,  mercury,  lead, \nand  chromium);  and  other  toxic  substances  (i.e.,  cyanide,  phenol,  and  coliform);  as  well  as \nphysical factors such as temperature, pH, and turbidity (Table A3.1). \n \n\nTable A3.1: Major National Standards for Surface Water Quality (GB383-2002) (mg/L) \n\nParameter \n\nWater Quality \n\npH \nSuspended Solis \nDissolved Oxygen  \nBiochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) \nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD) \nOrganic Phosphorous (P) \nTotal Phosphorous (TP) \nAmmonia Nitrogen (NH3-N) \nNitrate Nitrogen \nTotal Nitrogen (N) \nPhenol \nTotal Dissolved Solid (TDS) \nFecal Coliform  \nChlorine Residual \n\n \n \n \n \n\u2265 \n\u2264 \n\u2264 \n\u2264 \n\u2264 \n\u2264 \n\u2264 \n\u2264 \n\u2264 \n\u2264 \n\u2264 \n\u2264 \n\n \n\nClass I \n6\u20139 \n\u2014  \n90% saturation \n3 \n15 \n\u2014  \n0.02 \n0.15 \n\u2014  \n0.2 \n0.002 \n\u2014  \n200 \n\u2014  \n\nClass II \n6\u20139 \n\u2014  \n6 \n3 \n15 \n\u2014  \n0.1 \n0.5 \n\u2014  \n0.5 \n0.002 \n\u2014  \n2,000 \n\u2014  \n\nClass III \n6\u20139 \n\u2014  \n5 \n4 \n20 \n\u2014  \n0.2 \n1.0 \n\u2014  \n1.0 \n0.005 \n\u2014  \n10,000 \n\u2014  \n\nClass IV \n6\u20139 \n\u2014  \n3 \n6 \n30 \n\u2014  \n0.3 \n1.5 \n\u2014  \n1.5 \n0.01 \n\u2014  \n20,000 \n\u2014  \n\nClass V \n6\u20139 \n\u2014  \n2 \n10 \n40 \n\u2014  \n0.4 \n2.0 \n\u2014  \n2.0 \n0.1 \n\u2014  \n400,000 \n\u2014  \n\n\u2014 = no standard exists or guideline is not specified. \nNote:  In  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  there  are  two  water  classifications;  one  describes  functions  and  the  other \nquality. \nSource: 2007 project feasibility study. \n \nOxygen-consuming  organic  matter  measured  in  COD  and  BOD  is  the  most  common \n7. \nwater pollutant in the PRC. Other common pollutants are nutrients that contribute to excessive \ngrowth of algae and other water plants which, in turn, deplete the water's oxygen  supply. The \nmajor parameters for measuring nutrients are ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorous \n(TP).  The  annual  occurrence  of  fish  kills  since  the  early  1990s  reflects  the  presence  of  high \nlevels of nutrients in the lake. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nWater  pollution  and  degradation  of  the  ecosystem  in  the  lake  have  accelerated  in  the \nlast  two  decades  because  of  continued  pressure  from  rapid  economic  growth,  resulting  in \nindustrialization  and  urbanization.  The  current  water  quality  in  most  of  the  urban  inland  rivers \nhas been assessed class V or worse, and large-scale fish kills have occurred in the lake every \nyear  since  the  early  1990s.  The  situation  is  aggravated  by  lack  of  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities,  with  large  quantities  of  untreated  industrial  and  domestic  wastewater  directly \ndischarged into rivers and other tributaries. This has subsequently resulted in the deterioration \nin the quality of water meant for domestic use. The lake, in fact, consists of several lakes with \nwater quality falling classes in IV\u2013V of the Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water of \nthe PRC as shown in Table A3.2. \n\nStatus of Pollution in the Baiyangdian Basin \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n        Appendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A3.2: Water Quality of the Major Lakes in Baiyangdian \n\n \n\nMonitoring Section \n\nExisting Water Quality Class \n\nMajor Pollutants Exceeding \nthe Required Limits \n\nWater Quality \nTarget Class \nIII \nIII \nIII \nIII \nIII \nIII \nIII \nIV \nV \n\nBOD, COD, NH3-N, TP \n\nSources of Pollution in the Baiyangdian Basin \n\nIV \nIV \nIV \nIV \nIV \nIV \nIV \nBelow V \nNot available \n\nShaochedian \nZhaolindian \nWangjiazhai \nQuantou \nDuancun  \nCaiputai  \nGuangdianzhangzhua \nNanliuzhuang \nGudingdian \nBOD  =  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  COD  =  chemical  oxygen  demand,  NH3-N  =  ammonia  nitrogen,  TP  =  total \nphosphorous. \nSource:  2007 project feasibility study. \n  \nC. \n \nThere are three main sources of pollution in the basin: (i) point sources, including urban \n9. \nand industrial wastewater; (ii) nonpoint sources that include agricultural and urban storm water \nrunoff,  and  livestock  wastes;  and  (iii)  in-lake  pollution  sources,  including  domestic  wastewater \nand leachate from wastes generated by in-lake villages, in-lake fish farms, and tourism.  \n \n10. \nTotal annual pollution loads generated by all sources (i.e., point, nonpoint, and in-lake) \nare estimated at about 633,635 tons/year of COD, 92,741 tons/year of ammonia nitrogen, and \n46,929 tons/year of total phosphorous. A large proportion of the total pollution load is produced \nby  in-lake  sources  such  as  in-lake  villages,  fish  and  duck  farms,  and  in-lake  tourism.  About \n60.7% of COD, 59.3% of ammonia nitrogen, and 91.6% of total phosphorous produced by the \nin-lake  sources  reach  the  lake.  A  significant  proportion  of  the  total  COD  (about  31.5%)  and \nammonia  nitrogen  (about  43%)  produced  by  point  sources  likewise  reach  the  lake.

Under this plan, it is expected \nthat  all  the  urban  sewage  generated  by  Baoding  City  and  about  60%  of  22  other  cities  and \ncounties will be treated by 2010. Baoding municipal government (BMG) is also making efforts, \nthrough  its  Baoding  Ecosystem  Rehabilitation  Master  Plan,  to  mitigate  existing  water  pollution \nproblems.  It  expects  to  achieve  its  wastewater  management  objectives  set  for  2010,  which \ninclude  attaining  class  III  water  quality  in  the  lake  and  class  IV  water  quality  in  urban  inland \nrivers. The master plan calls for installing 23 wastewater treatment plants in the counties, cities, \nand  towns  surrounding  and  upstream  of  the  lake  with  a  total  capacity  of  665,000  m3/day.  Of \nthese,  13  wastewater  treatment  plants,  with  a  total  capacity  of  about  340,000  m3/day,  are \ncovered under this Project and account for 51% of the planned capacity.   \n \nThis Project, therefore, significantly complements the initiatives under the 11th Five-Year \n13. \nEnvironmental Protection Plan and those under the master plan. The Project will enable BMG to \nachieve its wastewater management objectives set for 2010. \n \n  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nDonor \n\nAsian Development  \nBank \n \n \n\nInternational Bank

combined anaerobic and aerobic wastewater treatment process. CASS (cyclic activated \nsludge  system)  is  a  combination  of  a  biological  selector  and  variable  volume  process  reactor.  The  process \noperates with a single sludge in a single reactor basin to accomplish both biological treatment and solids-liquid \nseparation.  In  CAST  (cyclic  activated  sludge  technology),  similar  to  CASS,  the  sequences  of  fill,  aeration, \nsettle,  and  decant  are  consecutively  and  continuously  operated  in  a  compartment  reactor.  UNITANK  is  a \ntechnology used for domestic and industrial wastewater treatment consisting of one reactor divided into three \ncompartments.  These  are  hydraulically  connected  by  an  opening  in  the  common  connecting  walls.  Each \ncompartment is equipped with an aeration system. \n\nSources: 2006 feasibility study reports for individual subprojects, and individual design institutes. \n\n \n\n\f 34 \n\n Appendix 8 \n\n \n\nBIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES \n\n \n1. \nThe  biodiversity  conservation  activities  under  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF) \ncomponent will be organized in six modules. The summary description is provided below. More \ndetailed and specific description of these interventions is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n2. \nModule  1,  Protected  Area  Management.  Biodiversity  management  and  monitoring \nfunctions  will  be  strengthened  in  the  two  provincial  nature  reserves  (PNRs),  i.e.,  the  Jin  Hua \nShan-Heng  Lingzi  Shan  and  Baiyangdian  Lake  Rare  Bird  PNRs  (Map  7).  Specific  actions  will \ninclude (i) training of at least five managers and 10\u201315 additional staff in each of the two PNRs, \n(ii) formation  of  community  management  groups  in  communities  adjacent  to  each  PNR, \n(iii) preparation  of  biodiversity  management  plans,  (iv)  development  and  implementation  of \nregular  biodiversity  monitoring  programs,  (v)  more  effective  biodiversity  management  over  the \n700  square  kilometer  (km2)  area  of  both  PNRs,  and  (vi)  steps  taken  to  pursue  listing  of \nBaiyangdian as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. \n \nModule 2, Habitat Enhancement and Rehabilitation. A variety of pilot activities will be \n3. \nimplemented  to  improve  the  quality  and/or  extent  of  important  wildlife  habitats.  For  the \nBaiyangdian Rare Bird PNR, these will include (i) constructed wetlands to increase habitat area \nand reduce discharge of nonpoint source pollutants to the lake, (ii) demonstration of composting \ntoilets for \u201cin-lake\u201d and lakeside communities\u2014to reduce nonpoint source pollution and provide \ncompost  for  farm  use,  (iii)  establishment  of  test  areas  to  improve  migratory  bird  resting  and \nfeeding  islands,  and  (iv)  removal  of  excess  silt  from  the  lake  through  appropriately  scaled \ncommunity-based  initiatives.  Demonstration  of  integrated  pest  management  will  be  set  up  to \nreduce  production  costs  and  reliance  on  agricultural  chemicals.  For  the  Jin  Hua  Shan-Heng \nLingzi Shan PNR, the preferred vegetation cover for the hemaji and other rare bird species will \nbe  increased  or  restored  in  areas  that  have  been  deforested  or  otherwise  damaged  through \nhuman  activity.  Four  to  five  demonstration  activities  will  be  established  for  pollution  reduction \nwithin the Baiyangdian Lake environs. Habitat enhancement will be undertaken in both PNRs, \ncovering an area equivalent to at least 5% of the total designated core conservation areas.  \n \n4. \nModule  3,  Eco-Friendly  Livelihoods.  Steps  will  be  taken  to  improve  environmental \nbenefits  of  livelihood  activities  that  are  dependent  on  natural  resources  within  the  basin. \nEcotourism  training  will  be  provided  to  small  operators  to  improve  visitors\u2019  appreciation  for \nbiodiversity  and  natural  ecosystem  values.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  to  Baoding \nTourism  Bureau  and  county  bureaus  to  prepare  ecotourism  master  plans.  Reed  producers  in \nthe  lake  and  gatherers  of  non-timber  forest  products  in  the  upper  watershed  will  be  trained  to \nadopt improved methods of planting, harvesting, and processing so that impacts on habitats and \nnatural  resources  are  minimized.  Value-adding  for  these  products  will  increase  income  while \nreducing pressure on natural resources. Six demonstration activities of improved livelihoods will \nbe undertaken relating to eco-tourism; and an additional six relating to harvesting, processing, \nand  marketing  of  natural  products.  A  tourism  master  plan  will  be  drafted  for  Baoding \nMunicipality.  At  least  two  trial  eco-certification  programs  will  be  initiated,  one  each  for  tourism \nand natural products-based activities. A credit facility will be established to support sustainable \nlivelihood options, especially among the poorest segment of the target beneficiary group. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n35 \n\ninteractive  exhibits,  etc.) \n\nlibraries,  audiovisual  displays, \n\nModule  4,  Sustainable  Financing.  Mechanisms \n\nfor  self-financing  of  required \n5. \nenvironmental and biodiversity management services in both PNRs will be supported. Technical \nassistance  will  be  provided  to  work  with  county  authorities,  as  well  as  with  other  responsible \nagencies  (e.g.,  Yesanpo  Scenic  and  Cultural  Heritage  Area  management  committee  in  the \nupper  catchment  basin)  to  develop  appropriate  financing  structures  (e.g.,  user  fees,  cost \nsharing, or trust fund), based primarily on tourism revenue streams.  \n \n6. \nModule  5,  Awareness.  Promoting  awareness  in  the  basin  will  ensure  long-term \nsustainability  of  biodiversity  conservation.  Awareness  and  participation  of  communities  around \nboth PNRs will be strengthened by (i) integrating biodiversity conservation lessons into curricula \nfor  at  least  5%  of  all  primary  and  secondary  schools  within  the  rural  counties  of  Baoding \nMunicipality; (ii) providing mobile outreach facilities (e.g., fully equipped vans or minibuses, with \nto  reach  poor,  remote \nsmall \ncommunities  around  both  PNRs;  (iii)  developing  a  Baiyangdian  biodiversity  website; \n(iv) developing feedback and monitoring mechanisms to measure and improve the effectiveness \nof  awareness  campaigns;  and  (v)  providing  materials  and  technical  assistance  to  establish  a \nwetlands  learning  center  at  the  lake,  including  exhibits,  signage,  walkways,  and  boardwalks. \nNotes and pamphlets\u2014on effective new policy measures, lessons learned, and best practices\u2014\nwill be prepared and published for distribution especially for high-ranking decision makers in the \nGovernment  and  executives  in  the  private  sector.  All  such  material  will  also  be  posted  on  the \nproject website for public access.     \n \n7. \nModule  6,  Integrated  Ecosystem  Management.  Activities  will  be  integrated  by \n(i) strengthening  basin-wide  institutional  coordination  mechanisms,  especially  through  regular \ncoordination  meetings;  (ii)  increasing  involvement  and  strengthening  of  local  nongovernment \norganizations;  (iii) improving  capabilities  for  integrated,  basin-wide  monitoring  of  biodiversity, \nsurface water flow, water quality, and other critical ecosystem parameters; and (iv) establishing \na  biodiversity  and  wetlands  database  as  part  of  a  basin-wide  geographic  information  system \nclearinghouse  that  will  serve  as  a  resource  for  future  planning  and  management  decision \nmaking.  \n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n        Appendix 7 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES \n \n\nScope of Services \n\nWater  pollution  and  ecosystem  degradation  in  Baiyangdian  Basin  have  accelerated  in  the \n1. \nlast  2  decades  because  of  continued  pressure  from  rapid  economic  growth,  industrialization,  and \nurbanization.  The  degradation  of  the  lake  has  diminished  livelihood  opportunities  for  communities \nliving  in  the  lake\u2019s  surrounding  areas  and  has  put  them  at  risk  from  various  types  of  diseases. \nAdding  to  the  current  problems  is  the  weak  capacity  of  county  governments  to  implement  and \nenforce environmental policies and safeguards to conserve the biodiversity of the basin. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  support  Baoding  municipal  government  (BMG)  and  participating  county \ngovernments in abating the continuing pollution and degradation in the lake and its river network as \nwell  as  in  rehabilitating  its  ecosystem  in  line  with  the  priorities  of  the  national,  provincial,  and \nmunicipal  governments.  The  proposed  Project  is  part  of  the  first  phase  under  the  Baiyangdian \nEcosystem Rehabilitation Master Plan, which calls for an integrated effort to reduce pollution loads \nin  the  lake  and  rehabilitate  the  ecosystems  in  the  basin,  with  a  planned  investment  of  over \n$1.0 billion. This Project is to have a demonstration effect for future undertakings. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nBMG,  through  Baoding  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (BDRC),  is  the  Executing \nAgency  (EA)  for  the  Project.  Consulting  services  are  required  to  support  the  project  management \noffice (PMO) at BDRC and the project implementation units (PIUs) of the respective implementing \nagencies (IAs), to provide project management support and build capacity for integrated ecosystem \nand water resource management.  \n \n4. \nA consulting firm will be engaged by the EA to provide technical assistance to the PMO and \nPIUs throughout project implementation. In general, the consulting services will (i) support the PMO \nin project management, and (ii) advise and train the PMO and PIUs in the technical aspects of the \nProject.

It  will  support  a  number  of  interventions \nunder four complementing components: (i) 22 subproject investments of 7 different categories\u2014\n13 wastewater treatment plants (WTPs); 3 water supply systems (WSSs); 2 reforestation; and \none  each  for  clean  energy  development  (CED),  urban  flood  management  (UFM),  integrated \nwater  management  (IWM),  and  solid  waste  management  (SWM);  (ii)  ecosystem  management \nand  biodiversity  conservation  that  will  also  demonstrate  innovative  alternative  livelihoods; \n(iii) institutional  strengthening  by  providing  training  for  integrated  ecosystem  and  water \nmanagement,  and  increasing  environmental  awareness;  and  (iv)  project  management  support \nby providing technical expertise for effective implementation of related interventions. \n \n2. \nthe \n22 subprojects. WTPs will treat the affluent from domestic, industrial, and commercial users and \nsignificantly reduce organic pollution loading to the lake as well as improve the water quality in \nthe  extensive  network  of  rivers  in  the  basin.  WSSs  will  increase  the  potable  water  supply  and \nimprove  hygiene  among  project  beneficiaries.  Aside  from  financial  benefits,  WTPs  and  WSSs \nare expected to generate significant health and environmental benefits. Reforestation and forest \nconservation in Angezhuang Reservoir and the lakeside areas will improve the water retention \ncapacity  of  the  watershed  and  contain  soil  erosion.  These  interventions  will  also  conserve \nbiodiversity;  and  improve  the  ecosystem,  living  conditions,  and  livelihoods  of  the  subproject \ncommunities. The CED subproject will exploit geothermal energy as an alternative to using coal \nfor providing space-heating to domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers; and contribute \nto energy cost savings as well as reductions in emission of air pollutants, with positive impacts \non  the  environment  and  health  of  affected  communities.  The  UFM  subproject  is  expected  to \nsignificantly  reduce  damage  to  public  and  private  infrastructure  as  well  as  to  agricultural \nproduction  caused  by  flooding,  which  has  increased  in  frequency  in  recent  years.  The  IWM \nsubproject  will  divert  water  from  the  Wangkuai  to  Xidayang  reservoir  through  a  new  diversion \nchannel  to  provide  an  ensured  and  increased  amount  of  water  to  the  lake;  recharge \nlow  watertable  periods,  significantly  reduce  water \nsubterranean  water  sources  during \nconveyance losses compared to the alternative route, and improve water supply and quality in \nand around Baoding City and Li County. The cleanup of Huanghuangou River, under the SWM \nsubproject,  will  also  improve  water  retention  capacity,  environment,  and  contain  soil  erosion. \nThese interventions will also conserve biodiversity and improve the ecosystem, living conditions, \nand livelihoods in the basin. \n \n3. \nBenefits  from  the  interventions  under  the  biodiversity  conservation  component  will  be \nderived from improved wildlife and overall environmental conditions in the basin in general and \nin  the  provincial  nature  reserve  areas  in  particular.  However,  these  benefits  are  difficult  to \nquantify and, therefore, are not included in the financial and economic analysis. \n \nB. \n\nMajor Assumptions \n\n \n\n4. \nFinancial  Analysis.    The  analysis  is  based  on  information  and  data  provided  by  the \nrelevant feasibility study reports carried out by the Government as well as information provided \nby the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). The specific assumptions applied in the \nanalysis are as follows:  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n        Appendix 12 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  analysis  focuses  on  19  revenue-generating  subprojects\u2014WTPs,  WSSs, \nCED, and reforestation\u2014and assesses financial sustainability by calculating their \nindividual financial internal rates of return (FIRRs).   \nEstimates  of  revenues,  capital  investment  costs,  and  operating  costs  are \nexpressed in yuan in 2007 constant prices. Tariffs used in the analysis are based \non  prevalent  rates  and  below  the  willingness-to-pay  threshold  of  potential \nbeneficiaries,  which  was  derived  through  a  household  survey  conducted  during \nthe  PPTA.  The  tariffs  and  price  of  timber  used  in  the  analysis  are  conservative \nestimates. \nSubproject-specific FIRRs are based on (a) with- and without-project incremental \nrevenues derived from tariff charges for providing services related to wastewater, \nwater  supply,  and  clean  energy  and  from  revenues  from  sales  of  timber  and \ntourist  entrance  fees;  as  well  as  (b)  incremental  costs  incurred  in  subproject \ninvestment  and  operation  and  maintenance.  A  projection  period  of  25  years  is \nassumed.   \nSubproject-specific  FIRRs  are  calculated  after  taxes.  The  sales  tax  rates  are \nassumed  at  7%  and  income  tax  rates  are  assumed  at  33%.  The  weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) for the investment subprojects is estimated to be \n2.3% (Table A12.1). \n\nTotal\n1,195.0\n100.0\n\nWACC\n2.3\n\n \n\nTable A12.1: Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital   \n\nAmount (CNY million)\n\nA.\nB.

The economic analysis mainly determines the incremental benefits \nand  costs  from  the  22  subprojects  which,  aside  from  those  mentioned  above,  include  UFM, \nIWM, and SWM subprojects. The economic analysis is carried out for each subproject, and for \nthe  Project  as  a  whole,  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.1 \nSpecific assumptions used are as follows: \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  project  life  is  assumed  25  years,  including  an  implementation  period  of  5 \nyears. Financial revenues and costs are expressed in 2007 constant prices.   \nAll  taxes  and  subsidies  are  excluded  from  the  economic  evaluation  of  the \nindividual subprojects and the Project as a whole.  \nEconomic costs and benefits are derived by adjusting financial costs and benefits \nby  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.93.  This  is  consistent  with  the  standard \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997. Gudelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Annual \nrevenue  for  each  WTP  and  WSS  subproject  is  calculated  based  on  its  specified  operating \ncapacity  multiplied  by  applicable  tariff  charged  to  different  types  of  consumers  (Table A12.2). \nAnnual revenues of about CNY37.25 million/year generated by the CED subproject are derived \nfrom  space-heating  of  (i)  about  1.65  million  square  meters  (m2)  of  all  types  of  buildings  at \nCNY14/m2,3  (ii) about  0.53  million  m2  of  public  baths  and  swimming  pools  at  CNY10/m2,  (iii) \nabout  0.1  million  m2  of  hotel  facilities  at  CNY10/m2,  and  (iv) drinking  water  supply  of  about \n250,000 m3 at CNY5/m3. About 2,000 hectares (ha) of the Angezhuang Reservoir area will be \nplanted with fast-growing and high-yielding trees at a rate of 900 trees/ha, with a yield of about \n0.4  cubic  meters  (m3)/tree.  Annual  revenue  generated  by  the  Angezhuang  reforestation \nsubproject  will  mainly  be  derived  from  an  annual  harvest  of  about  200  ha  of  reforested  area. \nRevenue  of  about  CNY29.15  million/year  is  projected  to  start  in  year  10  at  80%  capacity, \ngradually increasing to about CNY36.44 million/year at full development in year 12 with timber \nsales  of  about  72,882  m3/year  and  sold  at  a  price  of  CNY500/m3.  The  Baiyangdian  lakeside \nreforestation  subproject  will  mainly  provide  shelter  belts  around \nto  protect \nembankments,  main  channels,  and  villages  as  well  as  improve  the  general  landscape  of  the \narea to encourage tourism. Revenues totalling about CNY12.44 million/year are expected to be \ngenerated from (i) sale of timber of about 15,888 m3/year, harvested annually from about 44 ha \nat full development in year 14 and sold at a market price of CNY500/m3; and (ii) fees charged to \ntourists totalling about CNY4.5 million annually.  \n \n\nlake \n\nthe \n\nTable A12.2: Water Supply and Wastewater Tariffs (CNY/m3) \n\n \n\nSubproject\nWater Supply\nYi County\nXiong County\nDingzhou City\n\nWastewater Treatment\nm3 = cubic meter. \nSource: 2007 project feasibility study. \n\nDomestic\n\nIndustrial Commercial\n\n2.11\n1.60\n1.70\n\n2.50\n2.60\nTariff ranges from CNY0.72 to CNY1.30/m3\n\n3.00\n3.10\n\n \n\n \nThe  CED  subproject  may  quality  for  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  and  earn \n7. \ncarbon  credits.  Over  the  first  3  years,  the  subproject  may  generate  carbon  credits  of  about \nCNY10.0 million/year based on a contracted price of $12/ton with the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund \n(APCF). Half of the revenues earned during this period will be utilized to pay back APCF for its \nCNY12.6 million upfront financing. Beyond the third year, carbon credit revenues will increase to \nabout  CNY43.4  million/year.  In  line  with  the  Project\u2019s  social  development  objective,  Xiong \nCounty has agreed to share 50% of the carbon credit revenues with the Xiong County poverty \nreduction agency to expand its activities. \n\n                                                 \n2    ADB.  2006.

Inclusion of carbon credit revenues in the benefits \nstream makes this subproject financially more viable and less sensitive to decrease in revenues \nor increase in cost. \n \n9. \nAll  projected  financial  revenues  derived  by  each  subproject  are  evaluated  against  their \ncorresponding total investment cost (i.e., capital investment and operating costs) in estimating \nthe subproject-specific FIRRs (Table A12.3). Estimates of FIRRs are found to be  greater than \nthe estimated WACC of 2.3% and are some are sensitive to variations in revenues and costs. \nOverall, subproject investments are financially viable and robust. \n \n\nTable A12.3: Financial Analysis of Subprojects \n\nSwitching Values\nIncrease\nin Cost\n\nDecrease/\nIncrease in\n\nDecrease\nin Revenue\nto Maintain\nFIRR=WACCa FIRR=WACC to Maintain\nFIRR=WACC\n(%)\n\nto Maintain Revenue/Cost\n\n(%)\n\n(%)\n\nSubprojects\n\nOperating\nCapacity\n(million m3/year)\n\nTariff\n\nAnnual\nRevenueb\n\n(CNY/m3) (CNY million)\n\nCapital\nInvestment\n(CNY million)\n\nOperating\nCost\n(CNY million)\n\nFIRR\n(%)\n\n28\n34\n30\n27\n29\n29\n29\n28\n36\n33\n34\n33\n32\n\n36\n46\n39\n32\n36\n35\n39\n38\n53\n42\n45\n49\n49\n\n8.0\n9.1\n8.4\n8.2\n8.5\n8.0\n7.9\n7.7\n8.9\n9.2\n9.2\n8.1\n7.6\n\n1.30\n1.00\n1.20\n1.30\n1.30\n0.72\n1.25\n1.20\n1.30\n0.95\n1.05\n1.00\n0.72\n\n4.71\n4.61\n5.82\n6.95\n5.59\n2.46\n3.99\n5.87\n6.85\n6.10\n3.25\n2.78\n3.16\n\n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n\n7.30\n10.95\n10.95\n10.95\n9.13\n7.30\n7.30\n10.95\n13.14\n14.60\n7.30\n7.30\n10.95\n\n48.97\n50.96\n61.21\n61.21\n52.41\n21.09\n46.77\n70.59\n87.81\n61.41\n35.06\n39.62\n46.82\n\n9.49\n10.95\n13.14\n14.24\n11.86\n5.26\n9.13\n13.14\n17.08\n13.87\n7.67\n7.30\n7.88\n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n\n             \n           \n           \n           \n           \n             \n             \n           \n           \n           \n             \n             \n             \n\n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n\n                  \n                \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                \n\nA.

Wastewater  Treatment  and  Water  Supply  Subprojects.  The  national  policy  for \npollution  control  endorses  the  use  of  cost-effective  wastewater  management  measures  to \nachieve  overall  treatment  targets.  At  the  same  time,  the  investment  must  be  able  to  generate \ngreater economic benefits than the economic costs it has incurred. Therefore, two approaches \nare used to evaluate the economic viability of WTPs. The first is based on the basic requirement \nthat the technology chosen for each investment be a least-cost option while the second is based \non the criterion that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of that option be greater than the \nopportunity cost of capital of 12%. The least-cost analysis for each of the WTPs indicated that \nthe chosen technology exhibited the least cost compared with other technologies available.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f                                                                                                                       Appendix 12 \n\n \n53\n\nintestinal  diseases \n\nis  estimated  at  CNY115/person/year \n\n \n11.  Without the Project, untreated wastewater is drained into the river network of the basin \nleading  to  the  lake.  In  the  process,  pollutants  permeate  the  ground  and  contaminate  the \nsubterranean  water  that  communities  use  for  drinking.  Most  often,  the  untreated  wastewater, \nmixed  with  irrigation  water,  is  also  distributed  over  extensive  agricultural  areas\u2014causing \nsignificant  soil  pollution  and  degradation.  In  project  sites  where  existing  water  supply  facilities \nare  inadequate,  communities  contend  with  drinking  water  that  is  below  the  standards  of  the \nNational Sanitary Criteria for Domestic Drinking Water. These problems have resulted in serious \nhealth  problems,  particularly  frequent  occurrence  of  stomach  and  intestinal  diseases  and \nhepatitis,  which  were  verified  by  extensive  surveys  of  affected  households  in  the  project  area \nundertaken by the PPTA. About 1.12 million people or about 416,000 households (or about 25% \nof the total population living within the wastewater drainage area) are affected by domestic and \nindustrial  effluents,  while  another  260,000  people  or  about  65,000  households  are  in  need  of \nimproved water supply facilities. All these households will benefit from the WTPs and WSSs to \nbe established under this Project.  \n \nThe  \u201ccost  of  illness\u201d  approach  was  used  to  estimate  the  benefits  of  WTPs  and  WSSs \n12. \ninvestments. Improvements in drinking water have been found to decrease the incidence rate of \nstomach and intestinal diseases by 5% and hepatitis A by 0.6%. The cost of medical treatment \nfor  stomach  and \n(about \nCNY107/person/year  in  economic  terms);  for  treatment  of  hepatitis  A,  it  is  estimated  at  about \nCNY6,000/person/year  (about  CNY5,580/person/year  in  economic  terms).  With  the  projected \nlarge  number  of  affected  population  in  each  of  the  subproject  areas,  the  economic  benefits \nresulting from reductions in medical costs are expected to be substantial. This is reflected in the \nestimated  EIRRs  for  each  of  the  WTPs  (16.8\u201318.3%)  and  WSSs  (17.6\u201318.6%),  which  are \nsignificantly greater than the opportunity cost of capital of 12% (Table A12.4).   \n \n13. \nReforestation  Subprojects.  About  10,000  ha  of  farmland  in  the  upper  watershed  of \nBaiyangdian Lake in Yi County will be protected from soil erosion, particularly during the rainy \nmonths,  with  the  reforestation  of  the  Angezhuang  Reservoir  area.  This,  in  turn,  will  benefit  a \ntotal of about 18,7504 farm households, which are expected to avoid crop damages caused by \nsoil erosion at an estimated average annual cost of about CNY1,674/ha at the subproject\u2019s full \ndevelopment or an estimated total economic benefits of about CNY16.74 million/year. Economic \nbenefits  from  timber  sales  are  about  CNY34  million/year.  The  estimated  EIRR  for  the \nAngezhuang reforestation subproject, by evaluating the projected economic benefits against its \neconomic  investment  cost,  is  16.4%.  Revenues,  mainly  from  timber  sales  and  tourism,  and \ncosts  estimated  for  the  Baiyangdian  lakeside  reforestation  subproject,  are  also  expressed  in \neconomic terms in deriving the subproject EIRR estimated at 15.2%.  \n \n14. \nClean Energy Development Subproject. The use of geothermal water in Xiong County \nas  an  alternative  to  coal  to  provide  space  heating  to  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial \nbuildings,  will  significantly  reduce  discharge  of  noxious  gases  and  dust\u2014improving  air  quality \nand reducing the incidence of diseases, particularly respiratory diseases in the affected areas. \nThe subproject is expected to replace about 60,000 tons of coal annually. The CED subproject \nwill  provide  incremental  and  non-incremental  benefits.  The  non-incremental  portion  occurs \nbecause  coal-based  energy  production  will  be  replaced  under  the  Project.  Resultant  resource \ncost  savings  were  estimated  and  used  as  a  benefit.  Replacing  coal  with  renewable  resource \nalso reduces pollution. Benefits of reduced pollution were added to the resource cost savings. \nThe incremental benefits were not estimated because resource cost savings and environmental \n\n                                                 \n4   Average  farm  size  is  estimated  at  about  0.53  ha  (about  8  mu).  With  a  total  area  of  10,000  ha  expected  to  be \n\nprotected from soil erosion by the subproject, total farm households are estimated to be about 18,750. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n        Appendix 12 \n\nbenefits  adequately  justify  the  investment  on  this  subproject.  At  an  economic  cost  of \nCNY372/ton,  the  total  economic  benefit  accruing  to  energy  savings  is  estimated  at  about \nCNY22  million/year.  Reductions  in  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  (about  1,000  tons/year)  and  total \nsuspended solids (about 500 tons/year) are likewise expected to be realized and will generate \ncorresponding  economic  benefits  of  about  CNY1.67  million/year  and  CNY0.26  million/year. \nHealth  benefits  caused  by  lesser  incidence  of  respiratory  diseases  are  estimated  at  about \nCNY1.34  million/year. \nterms  of  about \nrevenues,  expressed \nCNY34.64 million/year, the estimated subproject EIRR is about 23.6%. \n\nin  economic \n\nIncluding \n\nTable A12.4: Economic Analysis of Subprojects                          \n\n \n\nSwitching Value\n\nIncrease\nin Cost\n\nDecrease\nin Revenue\nto Maintain to Maintain\n12% EIRR\n12% EIRR\n(%)\n(%)\n\nDecrease/\nIncrease in\nBenefits/Costs\nto Maintain\n12% EIRR\n(%)\n\nBase\nEIRRa\n(%)\n\n11\n10\n11\n11\n11\n11\n13\n12\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n\n25\n22\n23\n25\n23\n25\n29\n27\n26\n23\n24\n26\n24\n\n20\n18\n19\n20\n19\n20\n23\n21\n20\n19\n19\n21\n20\n\n17.6\n17.0\n17.3\n18.0\n17.5\n17.8\n18.3\n17.5\n17.3\n17.4\n17.4\n17.2\n16.8\n\nSubprojects\nA.

The  construction  of  flood  management \n15. \ninfrastructure in Anxin County will reduce flood damage to agriculture, housing, and other public \nand  private  assets  covering  an  area  of  about  14.31  square  kilometres  (km2)  including  about \n9,300  ha  of  farmland  (about 5,000  farm  households),  about  1,152  m2 of  residential  facilities, \nabout 30 small enterprises, and the municipal facilities. Total economic benefits are estimated at \nabout CNY7.57 million/year or about CNY7.04 million in economic terms. The estimated EIRR \nfor the investment is 14.5%. \n \nIntegrated  Water  Management  Subproject.  The  IWM  subproject  will  construct  a \n16. \n14.6 km  link-canal  from  the  Wangkuai  to  Xidayang  reservoir  with  a  flow  rate  of  10  m3/second \n(Map 4). This is expected to reduce water losses currently incurred from diverting water through \nthe  existing  9  km  natural  waterway,  which  have  been  estimated  at  about  20  million  m3/year \nbecause  of  the  high  infiltration  rate  along  the  sandy  route.  At  an  economic  price  of  about \nCNY1.4/m3,  the  estimated  economic  benefits  caused  by  reduction  in  water  losses  is  about \nCNY27.9  million/year.  The  reallocation  of  water,  by  releasing  excess  water  from  the  two \nreservoirs during the rainy season, will also enable the recharging of the Yimuquan aquifer with \nclean water to maintain pressure within the aquifer and prevent intrusion of polluted water from \nthe Caohe drainage area during low watertable levels. The mitigation of this problem will bring \nabout  health  benefits  among  affected  communities  accruing  to  reductions  in  the  incidence  of \nstomach and intestinal diseases, which are unlikely to occur without the Project. An estimated \n700,000 people in Baoding City and Li County are likely to benefit at a total economic value of \nabout CNY26.1 million/year. The estimated EIRR for the subproject is 18.9%. \n \n17. \nSolid  Waste  Management  Subproject.  Rehabilitation  of  Huanghuangou  River  will \nsignificantly improve the environmental condition in the subproject area. About 0.6 million tons \nof solid waste, currently in the open field, will be disposed of in a sanitary landfill. The existing \nmoat will be dredged, from which about 50,000 m3 of sludge, highly polluted by industrial waste, \nwill  be  removed.  This  area  has  also  been  a  dump  for  fly  ash  from  a  nearby  coal-fired  power \nplant, which is now adopting environmentally safe technology. Over 2 million tons of fly ash from \nits past operation will be safely removed for use in the construction of buildings and highways. \nOnce this waste have been removed, the subproject area will be landscaped. These activities \nwill significantly reduce dust pollution and contamination of surface and subterranean water with \nsignificant beneficial impacts on health and the environment affecting about half a million people \nin Baoding City. A conservative estimate of about 136,000 tons of dust, which annually affects \nBaoding City, will be reduced once the rehabilitation is complete. At a cost of about CNY0.52/ \nkilogram  to  reduce  dust,  the  estimated  economic  benefits caused  by  dust  reduction  are  about \nCNY70.83 million/year. Health benefits generated by reductions in the incidence of stomach and \nintestinal  diseases  due  to  contaminated  drinking  water  (about  CNY18.65  million/year)  and \nrespiratory ailments (about CNY4.19 million/year) are also expected to accrue to the subproject. \nThe subproject is expected to realize an EIRR of 18.9%.  \n \n18. \nEconomic  Analysis  of  the  Whole  Project.  The  estimated  overall  project  EIRR  is \n16.9% with an economic net present value of CNY1,462 million. Switching values indicate that, \nto  maintain  the  project  EIRR  at  12%,  benefits  should  not  decline  by  more  than  19%,  and  the \neconomic  costs  should  not  increase  by  more  than  23%.  A  simultaneous  decrease  in  benefits \nand increase in costs should be 10% or less. A 1-year delay in project benefits will result in an \nEIRR  value  of  13.7%.  The  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  is  economically  viable  and  robust. \nDetailed financial and economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix I.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\f   56        Appendix 13             \n\n         \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \n\nA. \n \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nDuring the 10th Five-Year Plan, 2001\u20132005, the population of extreme poverty in the country, by the Government\u2019s \ndefinition, was reduced from 32.1 million to 23.7 million; and that of low-income poor declined from 62.1 million to \n40.7 million, with the overall population of poor about 64 million. If the international poverty line of $1/day is applied, \nthe figure is significantly higher, at 246 million or about 18.8% of the total population. Experience in the PRC shows \nthat poverty  is  both  a cause  and  effect  of environmental degradation. The poor, lacking the daily  necessities and \nbasic  means  of  livelihood,  are  forced  to  overexploit  often  fragile  ecosystems.  On  the  other  hand,  the  poor  have \noften  to  bear  the  disproportionate  impact  of  environmental  pollution  and  ecological  degradation.  A  sustainable \ndevelopment  strategy  has  been  included  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  2006\u20132010,  which  emphasizes  a  \u201cresource-\nefficient  and  environment-friendly,  harmonious  society\u201d  by  maintaining  a  balance  between  economic  growth, \nsocioeconomic development, and environmental protection. The plan sets forth a series of environmental targets for \nurban  environmental  improvement,  ecosystem  rehabilitation,  natural  resources  management,  and  mitigation  of \nnatural disasters. \n \nThe  poverty-environment  linkage  is  pronounced  in  Baiyangdian  Basin,  where  poverty  is  intertwined  with  the \ndegradation of natural resources and loss of biodiversity in the upper reaches characterized by deforestation, and in \nthe  middle  and  lower  reaches  by  water  shortage  and  environmental  pollution.  The  Project  will  support \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  by  tackling  the  root  causes  of  poverty  through  the  reduction  of  environmental  pollution  and \nrehabilitation of the ecosystems, by adopting an integrated ecosystem management approach. It will contribute to \nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for environmental sustainability (MDG 7), to halve the \nproportion  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic  sanitation  by  2015  (MDG \ntarget 10).  Specific  interventions  include  wastewater  management,  water  supply,  reforestation,  watershed \nrehabilitation, better allocation of water resources, and use of cleaner energy and flood control. The poor will benefit \nfrom the Project as they are more exposed to flooding, health, and other impairments and do not have the income \nor other resources to cope with them. \n \nThe Project targets 11 counties/cities (Anxin, Baoding, Dingxing, Dingzhou, Gaobeidian City, Li, Mancheng, Tang, \nXiong, Xushui, and Yi) and two development zones (Wenquancheng, New and High Tech Development Zone). The \ndirect  project  area  has  a  population  of  1.09  million\u2014620,000  (57%)  urban  and  470,000  (43%)  rural.  In  2005,  the \naverage annual disposal income per capita was CNY6,920 ($833) for urban areas and CNY3,380 ($407) for rural \nareas.  The  environmental  and  poverty  reduction  benefits  will  extend  to  the  entire  basin  population  of  over  10 \nmillion. Therefore, the Project will be a key intervention in poverty reduction. \n \nThe  health  impact  was  analyzed  during  the  project  preparation.  An  order-of-magnitude  analysis  of  the  impact  on \nmorbidity and  mortality indicates that the Project may reduce incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  by an  average  of \n0.28  million  cases/year.  Most  of  these  cases  will  not  be  serious  enough  to  result  in  a  medical  consultation  or \nreporting  under  the  Government\u2019s  disease  surveillance  programs.  The  reduced  disease  incidence  is  associated \nwith  a  reduction  in  loss  of  1.4  million  workdays/annum,  with  savings  in  medical  costs  and/or  avoidance  of  lost \nearnings. \n \nThe Project will provide 13,200 person-years of work over the 5-year construction period. Project-related services, \nsuch  as  procurement  of  construction  materials  and  equipment  and  follow-on  multiplier  effects  for  the  regional \neconomy, are expected to create an additional 39,000 person-years of work. It is estimated that about 30% of the \nconstruction  jobs  will  be  filled  by  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  including  unemployed  persons,  rural  migrants,  and \nwomen. Since unemployment is a major cause of poverty in the project area, the poor will benefit disproportionately \nfrom  this  job  creation.  Those  temporarily  employed  in  construction  will  benefit  from  additional  training  and \nexperience, which will provide them with opportunities in other infrastructure projects. Project operations will create \n580  full-time  permanent  jobs.  While  these  are  primarily  skilled  jobs  in  wastewater  treatment,  water  supply,  water \nresource  management,  and  clean  energy  operations,  they  will  require  on-the-job  training  and  will,  therefore,  be \navailable  to  unemployed  workers  who  have  basic  technical  training  and  experience  from  their  previous  work  in \nstate-owned enterprises. \n \n\n  \n \n\n\f  \n\n                                                                                                                                           \n\n                                          Appendix 13            57 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe project area consists of one state-designated poverty county (Tang); two province-designated poverty counties \n(Yi  and  Quyang);  and  four  municipality-designated  poverty  counties  (Anxin,  Mancheng,  Xiong,  and  Xushui).  For \nrural areas, the absolute poverty line is CNY627 ($83) and the low-income poverty line is CNY628\u2013924 ($83\u2013122) \nper capita/annum. In Baoding Municipality, the absolute rural poor population is 90,000 and the low-income rural \npoor population is 495,000. Similarly, the poverty incidence rate is 1.1% for the absolute poor, or 7%, by including \nthe  low-income  poor  population.  The  poor  (absolute  and  low-income)  population  in  the  project  counties  is \ndistributed as follows: Tang County (57,700); Yi County (45,900); Anxin County (24,100); Xiong County (14,400); \nMancheng County (10,200); and Xushui County (11,800). \n \nA  social  and  poverty  assessment  was  carried  out  for  project  interventions  in  compliance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines on Incorporation of Social Dimension in Bank Operations.a It included an \nurban  affordability  assessment,  which  confirmed  that  most  of the  households  in  the  project  area  could  afford  the \nproposed  wastewater  (CNY1.3/cubic  meter  [m3])  and  water  supply  (CNY1.5/m3)  tariffs.  The  rural  poverty \nassessment  was  undertaken  using  a  field  survey  of  450  rural  households  and  PRA  in  10  villages,  4  counties, \ncoupled  with  key  stakeholder  discussions.  The  PRA  groups  included:  (i)  three  Baiyangdian  in-lake  villages  in \nAnxin;  (ii)  two  villages  participating  in  reforestation  subprojects  in  Yi  County;  (iii)  five  villages  affected  by  the \nwastewater  subprojects  in  Li  County,  Xiong  County,  and  Yi  County;  and  (iv) garbage  collectors  in  Huanghuagou \nRiver  area.  Institutional  consultations  were  held  to  discuss  subproject  designs  and  the  experiences  in  poverty \nalleviation. The assessment concluded that the rural poverty is linked generally to a number of factors, including: (i) \nlimited  off-farm  job  opportunities;  (ii)  falling  price  of  reed  (for  in-lake  residents);  (iii)  deteriorating  environment  for \nfishing; (iv) diseases and illnesses; (v) lack of lands and rising production costs (irrigation, fertilizer); and (v) lack of \nroads. Some of the in-lake residents also mentioned lack of opportunities in the tourism industry and their inability \nto share the benefits of local tourism. The analysis concluded that poverty was closely linked to deterioration of the \nlocal environment and lack of alternative livelihood opportunities. These underlying causes of rural poverty require \na strategy that promotes improved ecosystem and environmental management.  \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  (i)  strengthening  wastewater  management  to  address  water  pollution;  (ii) \nreducing the incidence of waterborne diseases, which are the major causes of rural absolute poverty in the project \narea; (iii) increasing income by providing alternative livelihoods, especially tourism, by improving the environment; \n(iv) providing opportunities for forest and ecosystem recovery; and (v) promoting tourism development. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe project design process was linked to the Baiyangdian Lake Ecosystem Rehabilitation Management Plan using \nlocal  experts  working  in  a  multi-stakeholder,  multi-sector  planning  process.  Consultations  with  stakeholders, \nbeneficiaries,  and  Project-affected  people  have  been  undertaken  in  the  project  design  phase  and  will  continue \nduring implementation. A participatory and consultative methodology was adopted to undertake the social analysis \nand  rural  livelihood  survey  during  project  preparation.  It  involved  (i)  a  formal  questionnaire  survey  with \n1,050 households,  100  businesses,  and  50  villages;  (ii)  discussions  with  project  stakeholders;  (iii)  key  informant \ninterviews  in  rural  communities;  (iv)  a  series  of  stakeholder  workshops  in  each  of  the  subproject  counties; \n(v) interviews  with  key  government  staff  and  non-government  organizations;  (vi)  focus  discussion  with  selected \ncommunities; and (vii) focus group discussions with women.  \n \nThe participatory approach is part of the project design and will be used during project implementation, monitoring, \nand  evaluation.  Public  consultations  will  be  held  during  project  implementation  to  seek  feedback  on  tariff \nadjustments  and  affordability.  Existing  participatory  policies  that  rely  on  public  hearings  to  gain  approval  for  tariff \nadjustments provide the mechanism for these consultations. In addition, wastewater and water supply companies \nhave committed to establish a customer complaints desk to receive, process, and document customer complaints. \nInclusive  processes  for  public  participation  in  water  resources  planning,  wastewater  tariff  setting,  tourism \ndevelopment planning, and wetland management plan will be put in place. Public consultations and disclosure of \nresettlement  plans  (RPs)  were  conducted  during  surveys,  community  meetings,  interviews,  and  workshops.  The \nresults  of  these  meetings  have  been  integrated  into  the  RPs,  which  describe  the  public  consultation  plan  and \ngrievance process. The consultations, including a grievance mechanism, will continue during land acquisition and \nresettlement so that the problems of affected persons will be properly addressed before project implementation. \n\n  \n\n\f   58        Appendix 13             \n\n         \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nEcosystem  degradation  and  environmental  pollution  contribute  to  gender  inequities  in  income-generating \nopportunities  and  workload.  Data  from  the  household  survey  indicate  that  women  are  primarily  responsible  for \ncaring for the sick and cleaning up after the floods. Time and effort spent on these activities means less time for \nincome-generating  activities,  family,  and  rest.  Improvements  in  ecosystem  management,  particularly  improved \nwastewater  and  water  supply  services,  will  reduce  this  burden  on  women.  Increased  tourism  will  create  more \nemployment  opportunities  for  women.  To  maximize  the  project  benefits,  women  will  be  given  priority  in  the \nemployment  opportunities  generated  by  the  Project,  and  women\u2019s  needs  and  interests  will  be  represented  (50% \nrepresentation)  through  membership  on  customer  committees  of  the  wastewater  and  water  supply  companies. \nMeanwhile,  women  will  receive  priority  consideration  for  training  and  other  capacity  building  activities  under  the \nProject. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nThe  Project  will  not  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  women,  but  the  design  aspects  ensure  gender  is \naddressed  to  achieve  equal  participation  of  women  on  project  activities  and  equal  opportunities  of  women  to \naccess social services, training, employment and beneficiary agreements, and decision making. Relevant gender \ndesign features are included in the project-specific social action plan (Supplementary Appendix J). \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.

A total of 293 hectares (ha) of land \nwill  be  permanently  acquired  and  another  145  ha  will  be \noccupied \ntemporarily.  Land  acquisition  will  affect \n4,508 persons in 1,042 households. \nAffordability of wastewater and water tariffs was analyzed \non  the  basis  of  citywide  official  income  data.  For  all \nincome  groups,  the  combined  full-cost  wastewater  and \nwater  tariffs  for  the  Project  are  less  than  2%  of  total \nincome,  and  less  than  4%  of  income  for  the  poorest \nhouseholds.  Tariffs  are \nthus  considered  affordable. \nHouseholds living below the poverty line are most likely to \nbe adversely affected by the tariff adjustment. To mitigate \nthe  impact  of  tariff  adjustment,  the  project  counties  will \nprovide  assistance  to  people  living  below  the  official \npoverty line. In addition, the wastewater and water supply \ncompanies  will  provide  monthly  cash  rebates  on  a  per \ncapita  basis  to  poor  households.  This  subsidy  will  be \nadjusted  as  the  tariff  increases.  The  wastewater  and \nwater  bill  subsidies  largely  offset  the  proposed  tariff \nadjustment  and  are  much  better  poverty  reduction \nmeasures  than  the  lifeline  tariff,  primarily  because  they \ncan be properly targeted at poor households \n \nNo  jobs  will  be  lost.  Project  activities  will  have  significant \npositive  benefits  on  both  urban  and  rural  employment \nopportunities for both seasonal and full-time employment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPlan  \nRequired \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nResettlement \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n  \n \n\n\f  \n\n                                                                                                                                           \n\n                                          Appendix 13            59 \n\n \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoplesc \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nThe  Project  does  not  cover  any  minority  area.

Resettlement  plans  (RPs)  have  been  prepared \nfor 17 subprojects; the other 5 subprojects do not cause any resettlement impacts. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has classified 14 RPs category B impacts. All persons affected by the \nProject  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  and  assistance.  The  cutoff  date  for  eligibility  for \ncompensation  and  assistance  was  the  date  of  the  project  proposal  approval  (April  2007).  An \nofficial notification of the Project has been announced to all affected persons (APs).  \n \n2. \nTo  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  there  was  close  consultation \nwith  local  officials,  village  committees,  and  APs  during  project  feasibility  planning  and  RP \npreparation. Permanent land acquisition for the total Project is 293 hectares (ha), of which 71 ha \nis farmland; this will cause partial land loss (20% on average) for 4,508 persons. The subproject \nwith  the  largest  impact  (nearly  50%  of  APs)  is  the  Wangkai-Xidayang  Reservoir  link-canal \nsubproject,  which  will  affect  2,770  persons.  However,  the  resettlement  impacts,  even  for  this \nsubproject,  are  not  serious  and  the  income  loss  can  be  restored  through  cash  compensation \nand improved irrigation from the subproject. In total, the Project will require the displacement of \nonly  13  houses  with  49  persons,  who  will  be  compensated  and  relocated  nearby.  Nine \nenterprises  will  also  be  affected,  but  only  two  small  private  enterprises  need  to  be  totally \nrelocated. Each enterprise will be compensated and workers will not be adversely affected. RPs \nhave  also  addressed  the  temporary  land  occupation  of  145  ha,  of  which  27  ha  is  farmland, \ntemporarily  affecting  another  1,700  persons.  For  the  construction  of  water  supply  and \nwastewater  pipeline  networks,  mitigation  measures  will  be  taken  to  avoid  or  minimize \ndisturbance on residents and shops; compensation will be provided if disturbance causes direct \nimpacts or extends beyond 2 weeks. \n \n3. \nFor  people  unavoidably  affected,  the  resettlement  objective  is  to  achieve  equal,  or \nbetter, income and living standards in line with not only the laws and regulations of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), but also ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The PRC laws \nand regulations provide the legal basis for the Project\u2014primarily the Land Administrative Law, \nthe Decision on Reinforcing Reform in Land Administration (State Council, 2004, No. 28), and \nthe  Ministry  of  Land  Resources  Guidelines  on  Improving  Land  Acquisition  and  Relocation \nRegulations  (2004,  No.  238).  Hebei  Province  and  Baoding  Municipality  have  also  formulated \nrelated  documents  for  implementing  new  regulations.  All  these  documents  have  provided \nessential policy and procedural basis contained in the RPs. \n \nBased  on  consultations  with  local  governments  and  APs,  and  general  practices  in  the \n4. \nsubproject  counties, \nfollowing  resettlement  principles  were  adopted:  (i) involuntary \nresettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible; (ii) compensation and entitlements \nprovided for the APs should be able to at least maintain or improve their pre-project standard of \nliving; (iii) all APs will be compensated and assisted, regardless of legal entitlements; (iv) where \nland per capita is not sufficient to maintain livelihood after land acquisition, compensation will be \nprovided  either  in  cash  or  as  land  replacement  and  other  income-generating  activities;  (v)  all \nAPs will be adequately informed on eligibility, compensation mode and standards, livelihood and \nincome restoration plans, project timing, and will be involved in RP implementation; (vi) no land \nacquisition will take place unless replacement land or sufficient compensation are given to APs; \n(vii) the Executing Agency (EA) and an independent third party will monitor compensation and \nresettlement  operations;  (viii)  vulnerable  groups  will  receive  special assistance  or  treatment  to \nensure  that  they  are  better  off;  (ix)  all  APs  should  have  the  opportunity  to  benefit  from  the \nProject;  (x)  RPs  should  be  combined  with  overall  county/city/district  planning;  and \n(xi) implementing  agencies  (IAs)  should  provide  adequate  and  timely  funds,  including  any \nobligations in excess of the RP budget estimates. \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n5. \nThe land compensation will be paid to the affected village and/or APs; the resettlement \nsubsidy and other compensation for individual asset loss will be paid to the APs. The affected \nowners  will  receive  compensation  at  replacement  cost  for  the  lost  structures  and  attachments \nwithout  consideration  of  depreciation.  The  affected  household  can  rebuild  their  houses  by \nthemselves  with  a  free  house  plot  provided  by  the  village.  APs  can  salvage  the  structural \nmaterials  and  a  moving  subsidy  will  also  be  provided.  For  affected  enterprises,  compensation \nwill be paid directly to owners in cash according to the replacement or market value of the land \nand fixed property assets. Income losses from reduced production/sales and wages caused by \nthe Project will be assessed and compensated to APs in cash. \n \n6. \nThe  detailed  programs  of  restoration  and  relocation  have  been  set  out  in  each  RP  to \nmitigate  resettlement  impacts  for  APs  and  restore  their  living  standards  according  to  the \neconomic characteristics of affected villages. People can choose the options according to their \nown  requirements.  Since  the  resettlement  impacts  of  most  subprojects  are  not  serious,  the \naffected  villages  and  APs  will  mainly  be  directly  compensated  in  cash,  but  some  villages  may \nreadjust land. The Project will not have any significant impacts on vulnerable groups and ethnic \nminorities.  Vulnerable  groups,  if  any,  will  be  identified  and  provided  preferential  treatment  to \nensure  their  rehabilitation.  Assistance  measures  include  provision  of  employment  for  project \nconstruction, skills training, and employment information (including 30% women).  \n \nThe  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  the  17  subprojects  is \n7. \n$48.5 million,  including  contingencies  and  land  taxes.  Detailed  measurement  surveys  will  be \nconducted  in  each  village  and  the  compensation  contracts  will  be  negotiated  and  signed  with \nvillage committees, households, and enterprises. The resettlement costs are included as part of \nthe total project cost and will be funded by each IA.  \n \n8. \nAPs  have  been  informed  of  the  key  elements  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nthrough  consultation  during  the  planning  stage  and  distribution  of  resettlement  information \nbooklets. During meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public consultation workshops, \nand  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  have  participated  in  the  planning; \nand concerns have been integrated into the RPs.  \n \nThe  Project  Management  Office  (PMO)  is  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of \n9. \nresettlement  planning,  supervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  The  relevant  IA  will  establish \nproject  land  acquisition  resettlement  units  for  supervising  implementation,  continuing  public \nconsultation,  responding  to  grievances,  and  reporting  progress.  The  grievance  redress \nprocedures are set out in the RPs. Since some of the RPs are based on feasibility studies, the \nRPs  will  have  to  be  rechecked  and,  where  necessary,  updated  based  on  the  final  design, \ndisclosed  to  APs,  and  resubmitted  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to  commencement  of civil  works. \nThe resettlement implementation schedules for the 17 subprojects were prepared based on the \nfeasibility  study  and  construction  timetable.  The  PMO  has  agreed  to  a  set  of  supervision \nmilestones with ADB to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement.  \n \n10. \nInternal and external monitoring of resettlement implementation will be required. Internal \nsupervision and monitoring will be done by each IA to ensure compliance with the provisions of \nthe RP. The PMO will engage an independent agency, acceptable to ADB, for monitoring and \nevaluation.  The  detailed  requirements  and  terms  of  reference  for  external  resettlement \nmonitoring  are  stipulated  in  the  RPs.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be  forwarded  directly  to \nboth the PMO and ADB, and will be uploaded to the ADB website.  \n\n  \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 May 2008) \n \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.14285 \nCNY7.00 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \naffected person \nAsia Pacific Carbon Fund \nBaoding Development and Reform Commission \nBaoding municipal government \nclean energy development  \ncarbon dioxide \nchemical oxygen demand \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \nfive-year plan \nFive-Year Environmental Protection Plan \nGlobal Environment Facility \ngeographic information system \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \nintegrated water management \nLondon interbank offered rate \ncubic meter \nMillennium Development Goal \nproject implementation unit \nproject management office \nProvincial Nature Reserve \nproject performance management system \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nresettlement plan \n \nsummary environmental impact assessment \nsulphur dioxide \n \nsolid waste management \ntotal suspended particles \nurban flood management \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nweighted average cost of capital \nwater supply system \nwastewater treatment plant \n", " \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \nADB \nAP \n \nAPCF   \nBDRC   \n \nBMG \n \nCED \nCO2 \n \n \nCOD \n \nEIA \n \nEIRR \n \nEMP \n \nFIRR \nFYP \n \nFYEPP \n \nGEF \n \nGIS \n \nIA \n \nICB \nIWM \n \nLIBOR  \nm3 \n \n \nMDG \n \nPIU \n \nPMO \nPNR \n \nPPMS   \nPPTA   \n \nPRC \n \nRP \n \nSEIA \nSO2 \n \nSWM   \n \nTSP \nUFM \n \nUNDP   \nWACC  \n \nWSS \n \nWTP \n", " \n", "NOTES \n \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n \n", " \n", " \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", "Vice President \nDirector General  K.
