Despite  being  the \neconomic  centers  of  Bihar,  the  four  towns  have  been  unable  to  achieve  the  national  urban \nservice goals or match many of the national averages for urban service delivery performance in \nIndia. Their inability to sustain water supply and sewerage services is the result of inadequate \nsize  and  condition  of  infrastructure,  mainly  attributed  to  inadequate  new  investment  and \noperation and maintenance (O&M). The investment program will improve and expand the water \nand  sewerage  infrastructure  in  the  four  towns,  and  help  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs)  of  the  four \ntowns\u2014the infrastructure owners\u2014to ensure discipline and structures for operations that result \n   \nin sustainable O&M. 2\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nItem \nNational \ntargets \nNational \naverage \nState target \nPatna \n(capital) \nBhagalpur \nDarbhanga \nGaya \nMuzaffarpur \n\nIn FY2010, Bihar\u2019s gross state domestic product (GSDP) ranked 14th among all states in \n3. \nIndia; its per capita GSDP of Rs17,9593\n at current prices was the lowest. Bihar\u2019s GSDP largely \ndepends  on  economic  activities  in  urban  areas;  thus  the  importance  of  urban  services  for \neconomic  growth  has  been  increasing.  In  FY2011,  tertiary  sectors  contributed  61%  of  the \nGSDP, secondary sectors 18%, and primary sectors 21% (footnote 3). Therefore, an increase in \nproductivity in urban areas is key to stimulating Bihar\u2019s GSDP. \n \n\nTable 1: Urban Service Delivery Performance in Largest Towns of Bihar \n \n\nWater \nSupply \nCoverage \n(%) \n94a\u2013100b \n\nWater \nSupply \nPer Capita \n(lpcd) \n135c \n\nHours of \nWater \nSupply \n(hpd) \n24c \n\n \nMetered \nConnections \n(%) \n100c \n\n \nSewerage \nCoverage \n(%) \n70b\u2013100c \n\n \nSWM \nCoverage \n(%) \nn/a \n\n \nLandfill \nDisposal \n(%) \n100d \n\n81 \n\n\u2026 \n36 \n\n123 \n\n\u2026 \n92 \n\n4 \n\n\u2026 \n14 \n\n25 \n\n\u2026 \n0 \n\n28 \n\n\u2026 \n43 \n\n78 \n\n100e \n38 \n\n2 \n\nn/a \n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n57 \n28 \n29 \n76 \n\n81 \n36 \n82 \n30 \n\n5 \n12 \n5 \n11 \n\u2026 = not available, lpcd = liters per capita per day, hpd = hours per day, SWM = solid waste management. \na  The Millennium Development Goal. \nb  Government of India. 2008.

Patna. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nImproving the urban environment and quality of life will lead to better health for the urban \n4. \npopulation  and,  hence,  to  an  increase  in  labor  productivity.  Urban  service  in  the  four  towns  is \npoor  (Table  1).  The  deterioration  of  key  urban  services  (water  supply,  sewerage,  and  solid \nwaste management [SWM]) may jeopardize the potential of the towns to continuously play their \nrole  as  engines  of  economic  growth  in  Bihar.  Poor  urban  services  negatively  impact  labor \nproductivity\u2014an  increase  in  cases  of  water-  and  vector-borne  diseases  will  prevent  affected \nmembers  of  the  working  age  population  from  engaging  in  income-generating  activities.  The \nconsequences of poor urban services greatly constrain women from engaging in much-needed \nadditional  and  alternative  sources  of  income  as  they  are  responsible  for  household  water \ncollection, waste disposal, family hygiene, and care of the sick. \n \n5. \nThe core problem for the ability of towns to sustain key urban services is the inadequate \nsize and condition of infrastructure. This is mainly attributed to inadequate new investment and \nO&M, stemming from four main problems:4\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nUser charges. With no user charges, ULBs cannot recover O&M cost. Inability to \ncapture  (a)  accrued  revenues  and  expenditures;  and  (b)  apportioned  common \nexpenses  makes  the  calculation  of  appropriate  user  charges  difficult,  even  if \nULBs are willing to levy user charges. \nAccounting  practice.  In  the  absence  of  a  dedicated  account  specific  for  each \nurban service, ULBs cannot accumulate internal reserves for major investments. \nAs  a  result,  they  rely  on  grants  from  various  national  and  state  schemes. \nUncertainty of the availability of financial resources makes planning for the future \ndifficult. \nPublic  administration.  The absence of a municipal civil service system means \nthat  ULBs  have  difficulty  accumulating  skills.  Most  staff  are  contracted  with \nmultiple  assignments,  often  not  having  the  qualifications  and  rarely  devoted  to \nspecialized tasks. \nHuman  resources.  Too  few  staff  are  recruited  to  sustain  the  water  supply, \nsewerage,  and  SWM  services  at  the  national  target.  Along  with  difficulty \nattracting  qualified  personnel,  ULBs  have  difficulty  preparing  a  long-term  plan \nand project proposals to attract financiers. \n\n \nUrban  service  delivery. India\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year Plan (April 2007\u2013March 2012) sets \n6. \nout 27 national targets, covering economic and social goals, including (i) ensure clean drinking \nwater is available to all by 2009, with no slippages by the end of the plan; and (ii) treat all urban \nwastewater  by  2011/2012  to  result  in  clean  river  water.  The  plan  recognizes  infrastructure \nbottlenecks and lack of long-term funds for infrastructure investment as binding constraints for \nachieving  the  goals.  The  plan  calls  for  public  sector  investment  to  meet  infrastructure \nrequirements where private participation is less likely. \n \nRoad map for achieving service targets. To achieve the national and state targets for \n7. \nwater supply, sewerage, and SWM services in the four towns, the Bihar state government, with \nassistance from  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  through the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (TA),  formulated  a  plan  that  matches  short-  and  long-term  goals  with  specific \nsolutions to help meet the targets\u2014a road map for 2010\u20132021. The key findings are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  physical  investment  for  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  SWM  will  cost  about \nRs35 billion by 2021, and will incur annual O&M cost of about Rs414 million upon \nfull completion. \n\n                                                \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Supply and Other Municipal Infrastructure and Services (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTo  create  a  sustainable  environment  for  physical  investment, 5\n the  ULBs,  in \ncollaboration  with  the  state  government,  need  to  (a)  formulate  and  adopt  user \ncharge  and  subsidy  policies; \nfor \nrecommending  user  charges;  (c)  migrate  to  an  accrual-based,  double-entry \naccounting  system;  (d)  establish  accounts  dedicated  to  each  urban  service \noperation;  (e)  install  automated  billing  systems  for  the  user  charge;  (f)  increase \nO&M staff numbers; and (g) train O&M staff in the ULBs. \nThe  nonphysical \nimprovements in operations, and capacity building will require Rs2,270 million. \n\nfor  construction  management,  systemic \n\n(b)  establish  an  administrative  body \n\ninvestment \n\nfinancial  management,  municipal \n\nGovernment and state government efforts. Various ongoing and planned investment \n of the national and state governments, valued at about Rs3,500 million, cannot meet \n\n \n8. \nprojects6\nthe physical investment requirements of the road map. \n \n9. \nOngoing  external  assistance  in  Bihar.  Since  2010,  the  state  government  has  been \nundertaking  various  urban  municipal  governance  reforms  with  assistance  from  the  Support \nProgram for Urban Reforms (SPUR), financed by the Department for International Development \nof the United Kingdom. SPUR is a \u00a361 million ($95 million equivalent) program to support urban \ngovernance  and  planning, 7  municipal \ninfrastructure \nmanagement,  local  economic  development,  and  poverty  reduction  in  28  ULBs,  which  include \nthe four towns. SPUR focuses on capacity building covering most of the reform requirements of \nthe road map.8\n \n \n10. \nADB  strategy  and  focus.  The  country  partnership  strategy  and  ADB  assistance \nprogram9 for 2009\u20132012 were designed to support the Government of India\u2019s efforts to address \nthe binding constraints in the plan through four strategic pillars.10\n One of the pillars emphasizes \nthe  continuation  of  ADB  assistance  to  infrastructure  development  in  various  sectors,  including \nthe urban sector. The country operations business plan for India, 2012\u20132014 places more focus \non  less-developed  states,  and  allocates  an  MFF  of  up  to  $200  million  for  the  investment \nprogram. \n \n11. \nThrough  the  investment  program,  ADB  will  support  a  part  of  the  funding  shortfall  for \nwater supply and sewerage infrastructure improvement11\n proposed in the road map. The aim is \nto develop a complete system in a town by complementing the ongoing investment (footnote 6) \nof the national and state governments. The investment program will also increase the efficiency \nand cost-effectiveness of O&M by outsourcing operations through design\u2013build\u2013operate (DBO) \ncontractual arrangements, and support ongoing efforts to address user charges, subsidies, and \naccounting specific to water supply and sewerage operations. \n \n\n                                                \n5  Many of the items are also recommended under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, Ministry of \n\nUrban Development. \n\n6  The urban infrastructure development scheme for small and medium-sized towns, the National Ganga River Basin \n\nAuthority, and other national and state budgetary allocations. \n\n7  As a part of the activities, SPUR helps the state government prepare an amendment of the Bihar Municipal Act to \n\ncreate a municipal civil service cadre, which will allow ULBs to retain their human resources. \n\n8  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9   ADB. (2009). Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009-2012. Manila. \n10 The  four  strategic  pillars  are  (i)  supporting  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  (ii)  catalyzing \ninvestment  through  the  use  of  innovative  business  and  financing  solutions,  (iii)  strengthening  the  results \norientation, and (iv) emphasizing knowledge solutions and support for regional cooperation. \n\n11 In  the  absence  of  SWM  master  plans  in  the  four  towns  and  considering  the  complexity  of  substantial  land \nacquisition  and  extensive  stakeholder  consultations,  physical  investment  to  SWM  infrastructure  is  most  suitable \nafter the subproject towns prepare and adopt an SWM master plan. Therefore it will be deferred to future financial \nassistance. SPUR supports the preparation of SWM master plans in the selected towns. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nA series of project loans through an MFF is the most suitable lending modality, as it will \n12. \nenhance  continuity  and  predictability.  Long-term  engagement  of  consultants  and  DBO \ncontractors will be financed through multiple loans. Greater predictability of financing availability \nunder  the  MFF  will  enable  the  four  towns  to  prepare  the  MFF  tranches  and  investment  in \naccordance with the road map beyond ADB\u2019s country programing period. It will provide a clear \nfinancial envelope in advance, and allow them to graduate from a traditional mode of planning\u2014\npreparing  a  project  after  budget  is  sanctioned.  Greater  continuity  and  predictability  will  enable \nthe state government to plan and execute investment in a holistic manner. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  improved  access  to  water  supply  and \nsanitation  facilities  by  the  urban  population  of  the  relatively  poor  and  weak  capacity  state  of \nBihar.  The  expected  outcome  will  be  access  to  better  quality  and  sustainable  urban  water \nsupply  and  sewerage  service  for  people,  especially  vulnerable  households, 12\n in  Bhagalpur, \nDarbhanga, Gaya, and Muzaffarpur. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nTo  provide  access  to  better  quality  and  sustainable  urban  water  supply  and  sewerage \n\n14. \nservices, the investment program will deliver five outputs: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nWater  supply  infrastructure  in  three  towns  improved.  As  an  immediate \nsolution to the problem of inadequacy of new investment, new raw water intakes, \nclear water pumping mains, water treatment plants, overhead tanks, distribution \nnetworks, and water meters will be developed and procured in Bhagalpur under \ntranches 1 and 2, and Darbhanga and Gaya under tranche 3. \nSewerage  infrastructure  in  one  town  improved.  To  address  inadequacy  of \nnew  investment,  new  house  connections,  sewer  networks,  pumping  stations, \nsewage  treatment  plants,  and  maintenance  equipment  will  be  developed  and \nprocured in Muzaffarpur under tranche 3. \nO&M  of  assets  created  by  subprojects  improved. To address deficiencies in \nthe  number  and  skills  of  O&M  staff,  DBO  contractors  will  construct  and operate \nall major infrastructure. They will field additional O&M staff13\n and provide on-the-\njob  training  to  ULB  staff  for  at  least  5  years  under  tranche  4.  Permanent  ULB \nstaff  under  the  municipal  civil  servant  system  will  take  in-country  technical \ncourses to upgrade their qualifications for asset operation. \nUrban  service  delivery  management  improved.  To  introduce  metered  user \ncharges,  computerized  billing,  and  reserve  accounts  for  water  supply  and \nsewerage,  the  consultants  under  the  investment program  will  prepare  long-term \nbusiness  plans,  user  charge  plans,\n and  proposals  for  creating  water  and \nsewerage accounts for consideration and adoption by the ULBs. \n\n14\n\n                                                \n12 The project preparatory TA report recognizes more \u201cvulnerable households\u201d as those fulfilling five or more of the \nfollowing  criteria:  (i)  household  belongs  to  most  backward  communities,  (ii)  head  of  household  is  a  woman,  \n(iii) head of household is illiterate, (iv) head of household is working as a daily wage laborer, (v) household income \nis below the poverty line, and (vi) household is residing in a kutcha (dried mud) house. Nine percent of households \nheaded  by  women  included  in  the  sample  of  the  TA  study  fall  within  the  category  of  \u201cvulnerable  households\u201d \nrequiring subsidies for connections. \n\n13 According to the assessment of the project preparatory TA, the current number of O&M staff is about one fifth of \nthe number required for internationally accepted staffing practice. The subprojects will explore a cost-effective and \nvalue-for-money solution by asking the DBO contractor to provide qualified staff at a competitive price. \n\n14 The  state  government,  with  the  suport  of  the  investment  program  management  consultants,  will  explore  a  user \ncharge plan that gives concessionary rates for socially vulnerable groups, before completion of the asset creation \nunder the investment program. \n\n\f \nD. \n \n15. \n \n\nItemb \nA.

Project  2  will focus  on  creating  new  assets  to increase \nwater  production  capacity,  such  as  new  raw  water  intakes  and  water  treatment  plant.  The  state  government  is \npreparing to develop the Bhagalpur sewerage system in parallel with National Ganga River Basin Authority funding \nwith assistance of SPUR. \n\n18 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fSpecific  arrangements.  Reflecting  lessons  learned  from  the  past  water  supply  and \n19. \nsewerage  projects  in  India,  large  international  competitive  bidding  contracts 19  that  cover \nconstruction of substantial parts of water supply systems or a sewage treatment plant on a DBO \nbasis will be proposed for each subproject to achieve clear accountability for functioning of the \nsystem  or  the  plant.  Under  one  contract,  a  contractor  will  design,  construct,  and  operate  the \nasset  for  about  9\u201314  years  (up  to  1  year  for  design,  up  to  3  years  for  construction,  and  5\u201310 \nyears for operation). One loan may cover the whole design and construction periods of a DBO \ncontract, and another loan(s) may continue to finance a part of the operation period of the same \ncontract  up  to  the  initial  3  years.20\n The  employer  will  continue  to  finance  and  administer  the \nremaining duration of the contract after ADB loans are closed. In the final year, of the contract,  \nimplementing agency, the employer of the contractor, will have options to transfer responsibility \nfor  operation  to  the  ULB,  to  continue  engaging  the  same  operator,  or  to  engage  another \noperator through the state procedure. \n \n20. \nTo ensure continuity and consistency, the two consulting service contracts will be carried \nout  by  the  same  team  throughout  the  entire  implementation  period  of  the  investment  program \nfrom  2012  to  2021.  The  initial  loan  will  cover  the  consulting  service  contracts  for  the  first  \n5 years, while subsequent loans will cover the remaining period of the contracts. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n21. \nEngagement  of  an  adequate  number  of  qualified  O&M  staff  is  key  to  achieving  and \nsustaining the service targets. Based on international and national norms for the number of staff \nnecessary to operate water supply and sewerage systems at common international standards, \nthe project preparatory TA estimates the optimal number of staff for specific sizes of operations, \ncompared  with  the  existing  number  of  staff.  The  results  suggest  each  water  supply  system  in \nBhagalpur, Darbhanga, and Gaya requires more than 100 additional qualified staff, and the new \nsewerage  system  needs  65  new  qualified  staff.  However,  immediately  creating  additional \npositions and filling vacancies in the ULBs would be difficult, because of the cap on the creation \nof  new  posts  and  modest  remuneration.  In  such  circumstances,  operations  by  the  contractors \nthrough  a  DBO  contractual  arrangement  will  be  the  most  practical  option  for  engaging  an \noptimum number of staff to efficiently operate the systems. Section 191 of the Bihar Municipal \nAct (2007) allows ULBs to entrust O&M and billing to an agency. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  economic  analysis  reviewed 21\n\n22. \n the  following  aspects  of  the  investment  program:  \n(i) the economic rationale for government intervention, (ii) goals, (iii) sector development plans, \n(iv) associated economic policies, (v) economic risks, (vi) the capacity of the state government, \n(vii)  fiscal  impact,  (viii)  state  government\u2019s  commitment,  (ix)  coordination  of  foreign  aid,  and  \n(x)  conditions  attached  to  the  loan.  The  economic  rationale  for  government  intervention  is \njustified as the investment program supports basic public services characterized by monopolistic \nconditions  and  management  of  externalities.  To  ensure  the  achievement  of  economy  and \n                                                \n19 The  subproject  on  capacity  building  for  Bihar  urban  infrastructure  development  under  ADB.  2009.  Technical \nAssistance Cluster to India on Advanced Project Preparedness for Poverty Reduction. Manila (TA 0003-IND) will \nhelp the implementing agency prepare the first DBO bidding documents. \n\n20 At  least  3  years  are  expected  to  be  required  from  commissioning  of  the  new  and/or  renewed  assets  to  achieve \nadequate user charge collection efficiency. To support the potential shortfall in revenue from the user charges, loan \nfinancing of the operation period for up to 3 years is proposed. \n\n21 Analysis on the investment program was carried out in accordance with D. Dole. 2005. Assessing Aid for a Sector \nDevelopment Plan: Economic Analysis of a Sector Loan. ERD Technical Note. No. 14. Manila: ADB (November). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nefficiency in implementation of the investment program, each PFR will assess the demand and \nleast-cost  designs,  and  ensure  that  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  are  higher  than  the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital, as specified in the subproject selection criteria of the FFA. \nThe economic internal rate of return for the Bhagalpur water supply subproject under project 1 is \nestimated at 18.3%. \n \n23. \nCurrently, no ULB levies user charges for water supply in Bihar. No sewerage service is \nprovided.  National  and  state  policies  and  laws  encourage  implementation  of  user  charges  for \nO&M on a cost-recovery basis.22\n The investment program will first aim at (i) O&M cost recovery, \nand (ii) accumulation of internal reserves for the major expansion in 2026 of water supply and \nsewerage  operations  gradually  after  the  assets  are  renewed  and  created.  Establishment  of \naccounts specific to water supply and sewerage operations in the ULBs will create a legal basis \nfor  dedicating  the  revenues  to  accumulate  internal  reserves.  Each  PFR  will  include  an \nassessment  of  indicative  user  charge  proposals,  which  will  be  a  broad  guide  for  setting  the \nexact  rates  for  different  consumer  categories  before  the  assets  are  operated.  The  financial \ninternal rate of return for the Bhagalpur water supply subproject under project 1 is minus 2.0%, \nbut the revenue from the user charge will ensure O&M cost recovery in each year. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nBihar  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Corporation  (BUIDCo),  the  implementing \n24. \nagency,  will  have  the  most  involvement  in  day-to-day  financial  transactions  under  the \ninvestment  program.  BUIDCo  is  a  state  government  undertaking,  registered  under  the \nCompanies  Act  1956  in  June  2009.  As  a  corporate  body,  BUIDCo  has  flexibility  in  adopting \nprofessional  approaches  to  management  and  administration.  Its  financial  management  follows \nthe  general  practice  of  the  private  sector,  and  no  major  issue  was  highlighted  in  the  financial \nmanagement assessment. The procurement capacity assessment23 indicates that BUIDCo has \nno  experience  in  implementing  an  externally  funded  project  but  has  satisfactory  strength  for \nmanaging  the  ongoing  procurement  activities  of  23  national-  and  state-funded  projects. 24\n It \nwould  need  additional  technical  staff  and  training  on  ADB\u2019s  procurement  procedures  to  cope \nwith  the  additional  contracts,  which  will  be  more  complex  and  larger  in  size  under  the \ninvestment program. As such, ADB will take cautious steps: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEach  tranche  under the MFF  will  be  processed as  a  project  loan. The  scope  of \nproject 1 includes only one investment subproject to gradually build up capacity \nfor contract management and construction supervision. \nADB will conduct prior reviews of all procurement documents during project 1. \n\n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Urban Development and Housing Department. The specific policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  facility  administration  manual \n(footnote 18). \n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe  investment  program  will  support  ongoing  and  future  national  and  state  poverty \n26. \nreduction programs in four towns by improving the access of poor and non-poor households to \nwater  supply  and  sanitation.  It  will  provide  water  supply  connections  to  the  edge  of  slums, \n\n                                                \n22 ADB learned from past urban development projects in India that ULBs are able to adopt the government\u2019s urban \nreform  agenda  only  after  the  beneficiaries  see  visible  improvements  in  service  delivery,  and  therefore  coupling \nreforms with physical investments for service delivery improvements is important. \n\n23 Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 The list and size of contracts are available at http://buidco.bih.nic.in/projects-current.htm. \n\n\fenabling slum dwellers to access safe water. Sustained access to safe water and sanitation can \nsignificantly decrease cases of water- and vector-borne diseases and have a positive impact on \npublic health. \n \nAn equally significant impact of the investment program is the reduction of time spent by \n27. \nwomen  procuring  water,  disposing  of  waste,  and  caring  for  the  sick,  thus,  freeing  women  to \nengage in other productive activities. Project 1 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \nThe  gender  action  plans  for  the  investment  program  and  project  1  were  prepared,  outlining \nactivities  that  will  bring  about  equitable  access  to  water  supply  and  sewerage  services \nparticularly  to  vulnerable  and/or  households  headed  by  women  through  a  concessionary \narrangement for  user  charges,  and  promoting  the  participation  of  women  in  the  project  offices \nand among contractors and operators. Works contracts under projects will follow the core labor \nstandards, and require the contractors to carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs for laborers \nas a part of the health and safety measures. Contracts for international competitive bidding and \nthe standard bidding documents for national competitive bidding require contractors to provide \nadequate  measures  for  social  impact  mitigation  in  compliance  with  the  FFA,  loan  and  project \nagreements,  and  the  principles  of  the  International  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers  under \nthe supervision of the executing and implementing agencies, and ADB monitoring. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nSafeguard \n\nframeworks,  specifically  an  environmental  assessment  and \n\n28. \nreview \nframework,  a  resettlement  framework,  and  an  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework,  were \nprepared  for  the  investment  program.  Consistent  with  the  safeguard  frameworks,  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  and  a  resettlement  plan  were  prepared  for  project  1.  Project  1  is \ncategorized as B for environment, B for involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. \nProject  1  will  provide  safe  drinking  water  to  the  residents  of  Bhagalpur. 25\n Most  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  are  associated  with  construction  and  will  be  mitigated.  The  initial \nenvironmental examination, which includes an environmental management plan, was prepared \nfollowing the environmental assessment and review framework. No land acquisition is required \nfor  project  1,  but  a  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  to  address  temporary  impacts  associated \nwith  rehabilitation  and  laying  of  pipes,  following  the  resettlement  framework.  No  indigenous \npeoples  were  identified  in  project  1  sites;  this  is  supported  by  census  data  and  confirmed \nthrough \ntransect  walks  during  subproject  preparation. \nConsultations  were  held  with  stakeholders  and  safeguard  documents  were disclosed  in  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite;  summaries  were  disclosed  in  local  language  to  affected  persons  and  other \nstakeholders.  A  community  and  participation  plan  details  consultations  and  disclosure  to  be \nundertaken during project implementation. \n \nF. \n\nfocus  group  discussions  and \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.26\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n25 Tranche 2 is likely to finance construction of the raw water intakes in Bhagalpur. BUIDCo is currently assessing two \noptions\u2014one location is in the wildlife sanctuary (potentially category A for environment) and the investment and \nO&M  costs  will  be  less,  while  the  other  option  is  outside  the  wildlife  sanctuary  (potentially  category  B  for \nenvironment),  but  the  investment  and  O&M  costs  will  be  substantially  higher.  If  the  former  option  is  selected, \nBUIDCo  will  prepare  an  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  disclose  it  on  ADB's  website  at  least  120  days \nbefore  the approval of tranche  2.  The  Urban  Development and  Housing  Department  will submit  the second  PFR \nonly after disclosure of the environmental impact assessment on ADB's website; approval of the second PFR will \nbe after the 120-day disclosure. \n\n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nUrban local bodies (ULBs) \ncannot pay design\u2013build\u2013operate \ncontractors for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) after the \nADB loans close \nPower supply to the water \ntreatment plants and sewage \ntreatment plant pumping stations \nbecomes intermittent \nNo bidder are interested in the \ndesign\u2013build\u2013operate contracts \n\nULBs are hesitant to adopt user \ncharge plans for water supply \nand sewerage accounts \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe investment program will assist ULBs in designing affordable tariffs for O&M \ncost recovery and establishing dedicated accounts for O&M under the investment \nprogram. Once ULBs adopt the tariff, revenue will be constant. \n\nEach mechanical facility will have a generator to ensure uninterrupted power \nsupply. \n\nThe executing and implementing agencies will organize pre-bid meetings to \naddress the doubts and worries of potential contractors and make full use of \ninternet resources, such as Twitter and Facebook, to disseminate business \nopportunities. \nThe investment program management consultants will help the state government \ndesign an administrative body for recommending user charges; this will separate \nuser charge setting from the political arena. If the state government and the \nULBs take no action on user charges and accounting, ADB will not process \ntranche 4, which will have an important role in financing the contractors for the \nO&M portion of the design-build-operate contracts up to 3 years, to bridge the \ninitial revenue shortfall. Coupled with awareness-raising programs for decision \nmakers and beneficiaries under the investment program, such arrangement will \ngive adequate incentive to ULBs to undertake necessary reforms. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n30. \nThe  government  and  the  state  government  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of \nthe investment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n31. \nThe government and the state government have given ADB certain undertakings for the \nMFF,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  FFA.
