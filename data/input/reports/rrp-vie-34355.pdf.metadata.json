It will \nimprove  drainage,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  systems  in  five \nprovincial towns and one district level town in the central region of \nViet  Nam,  where  inadequate  infrastructure  poses  serious \nenvironmental and health risks, and inhibits social and economic \ndevelopment. The towns are Dong Ha, Ha Tinh, Lang Co, Quang \nNgai, Tam Ky, and Thanh Hoa.  The Project will also increase \nenvironmental  and  health  awareness  and  promote  the  active \nparticipation of citizens, particularly women and the poor, in urban \nmanagement and services. \n   \nRationale  Following  many  years  of  rapid  urbanization,  the  level  of \ninvestment made for maintenance, repairs, and new capital works \nover the past decade in the urban sector has not been sufficient to \nprovide the necessary urban infrastructure. Weak institutions, lack \nof  qualified  human  resources,  financial  constraints,  lack  of \ncommunity  participation  and  slow  implementation  of  an \nappropriate legal framework for the urban sector have contributed \nto  the  low  coverage  and  inefficiency  of  urban  services.  This \nsituation  has  led  to  serious  deficiencies  in  the  availability  of \ninfrastructure and access to municipal services in urban areas, \nparticularly for the poor. Although the Government and several \nfunding agencies, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave made efforts in recent years to improve the situation in the \nlarger urban centers, provincial towns, particularly in the Central \nRegion,  have  received  much  less  attention,  except  for  the \nimprovement of water supply systems.  As a result, urban water \npollution in Project towns in the Central Region has increased and \nflooding occurs frequently. \n ", "ii   \n  The lack of adequate infrastructure and services in urban areas \nhas  deteriorated  health  profiles  of  the  local  population, \nconstrained investment and economic growth in the towns and the \nrural areas around them, accentuated poverty and vulnerability of \nthe local population, and impacted on quality of life. Furthermore, \nlack  of  opportunities  in  the  towns  of  the  central  region  fuels \nmigration  to  the  major  cities  of  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City \n(HCMC),  increasing  problems  in  those  cities  and  promoting \nunbalanced regional development. \n \nUrgent  measures  are  necessary  to  address  deteriorating \nenvironmental conditions in urban centers and transform them into \nsources of economic growth and employment. ADB\u2019s intervention \nis based on the necessity to (i)  improve urban infrastructure to \nsustain  economic  growth,  (ii)  promote  balanced  regional \ndevelopment, (iii) reduce poverty and vulnerability by improving \nenvironmental  and  health  conditions  in  urban  areas,  and  (iv) \nimprove the sustainability and efficiency of urban services. The \nProject will increase the attractiveness of selected towns in the \ncentral region, helping them serve as counter-magnets for rural \nmigrants  who  would  normally  move  to  Hanoi  or  HCMC  and \nimproving  welfare  and  opportunities  for  residents  of  provincial \nurban centers. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The long-term project goals are to (i) improve the quality of life \nand health status of urban residents and reduce poverty in the six \nproject towns and surrounding areas; and (ii) promote balanced \nregional economic development and  reduce migration from the \ncentral region to Hanoi and HCMC. The objective of the Project is \nto  improve  urban  environmental  conditions  in  project  towns. \nProject  outputs  include  (i)  expanding  and  upgrading  urban \nenvironmental  infrastructure;  (ii)  improving  autonomy  and \nmanagerial  and  technical  capacity  of  the  urban  environmental \ncompanies (URENCOs); (iii) improving urban management and \nplanning  capacity  of  townspeople  committees  (TPCs); \n(iv) strengthening urban management policies through support to \nthe newly established Department of Urban Infrastructure in the \nMinistry of Construction; (v) developing appropriate cost-recovery \nmechanisms  to  ensure  sustainability  of  urban  environmental \nservices; (vi)  increasing community participation in the planning \nand management of urban services, particularly by the poor; (vii) \nenhancing public health awareness; and  (viii) enhancing the role \nof women in urban management and institutions. \n ", "  iii \n \n   \n   \nThe Project will comprise five parts: part A, awareness and pro-\npoor sanitation; part B, drainage and flood protection; part C, \nwastewater  and  public  sanitation;  part  D,  solid  waste \nmanagement;  and  part  E,  implementation  assistance  and \ninstitutional strengthening. The project area includes the provincial \ncapital towns of Dong Ha, Ha Tinh, Quang Ngai, Tam Ky, and \nThanh Hoa, and the district-level town of Lang Co. Part D will also \ninclude Chan May urban area, Phu Loc district town, and four \ncommunes in Phu Loc District of Thua Thien Hue Province. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, \nduties, taxes, and interest during construction, is estimated at \n$96.0  million  equivalent.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  $53.6 \nmillion  equivalent,  or  55.8%  of  total.  The  local  currency  cost, \nincluding duties and taxes, is $42.4 million equivalent, or 44.2% of \ntotal. \n   \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that ADB provides a loan of $44.0 million equivalent \nfrom its Special Funds resources to cover 45.8% of the total \nproject cost. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. It will carry an interest rate of \n1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The French aid \nagency, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), will provide \na  loan  of  30  million  euros  ($31.8  million  equivalent)  for  joint \nfinancing of parts B, C, and E. The proposed AFD loan has two \ncomponents: a normal loan (or PS1) of $26.5 million equivalent for \nphysical works, and a concessional loan (or PTC) of $5.3 million \nequivalent for capacity strengthening activities. The PS1 loan will \nhave a maturity of 20 years with a grace period of 7 years, and an \ninterest rate of 2.5% for the entire term. The PTC loan will have a \nmaturity of 30 years with a grace period of 10 years, and an \ninterest  rate  of  1%  for  the  entire  term.  The  remaining  $20.2 \nmillion, equivalent to 21.1% of the total project cost, is the local \ncounterpart  contribution  financed  by  the  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees (PPCs) and beneficiaries. \n                                                                        $ million (equivalent) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nADB  31.7  12.3  44.0  45.8% \nAFD  21.9  9.9  31.8  33.1% \nPPCs  0.0  20.1  20.1  21.0% \nBeneficiaries  0.0  0.1  0.1  0.1% \nTotal  53.6  42.4  96.0  100.0% \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AFD  =  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nDeveloppement, PPC = provincial people\u2019s committees. \n   ", "iv   \nOnlending Arrangements  The Borrower for the proposed ADB and AFD loans will be the \nGovernment of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The loans will \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and part of the local \ncurrency  cost.  Part  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  onlent  by  the \nGovernment to URENCOs through subsidiary loans in domestic \ncurrency to cover the cost of operation and maintenance (O&M), \nequipment for drainage/flood protection, wastewater and public \nsanitation,  and  solid  waste  components.  The  Government  will \nprovide the remaining portion of the ADB loan and the entire AFD \nloan to PPCs as grants. The subsidiary loans to URENCOs will \nhave a maturity of 20 years with a grace period of 6 years, and a \nfixed  interest  rate  of  5.4%.  The  Government  will  assume  the \nforeign exchange risk. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date   \n   \nExecuting Agency  Each PPC will be the executing agency in its province. \n \n \n   \nImplementation  The  PPC  in  each  province  has  set  up  a  provincial  steering \nArrangements  committee (PSC), which will have overall responsibility for project \nimplementation and policy guidance. A project management unit \n(PMU)  in  each  province  will  support  the  PSC,  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  daily  implementation  activities.  The  Women\u2019s \nUnion, supervised by a community management committee, will \nhave  primary  responsibility  for  managing  part  A.  For  overall \nproject  coordination  at  the  national  level,  a  Project  Advisory \nCommittee will be established and will be supported by a project \ncoordination unit (PCU) within the Ministry of Construction. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  contracts  and  supply \ncontracts valued above $2.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, \nwill  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  Local  competitive  bidding  contracts  include  civil \nworks  and  supply  contracts  valued  at  or  below  the  given \nthresholds. Where special license is required, or where there is no \nadequate competition, supply and installation contracts valued at \nor below $100,000 may be awarded following direct purchase \nprocedures, subject to approval by ADB on a case-by-case basis. \nSupply contracts for equipment and vehicles valued at $0.5 million \nor  less  per  contract  will  be  procured  through  international \nshopping procedures, and supply contracts valued at $100,000 or \nless  will  follow  direct  purchase  procedures.  Minor  works  for \nrehabilitating existing facilities such as drains may be carried out \nby force account. \n   ", "  v\n \n   \nConsulting Services  To support the implementation of the Project, a total of 1,220 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services  (116  person-months  of \ninternational  and  1,104  person-months  of  domestic)  will  be \nrequired  for  assistance  in  project  management,  resettlement, \ngender and environmental aspects, and design and construction \nsupervision.  Consultants  will  also  support  institutional \nstrengthening by preparing and delivering on-the-job training and \ncapacity building. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will develop and expand urban services to poor and \nBeneficiaries  low-income  households,  help  generate  new  employment \nopportunities,  increase  gender  equality,  develop  community \nownership  and  self-reliance,  accelerate  public  administration \nreform,  reduce  risk  of  disease  through  health  awareness \nprograms, and ensure a sustainable environment. About 21.2% of \nthe total beneficiaries from the Project are expected to be poor. \nPoverty rates in the six project towns are higher than the national \nurban average of 11.1%, and poverty in Chan May town and Phu \nLoc district is higher than the total national average. About 16.3% \nof the urban population in the project towns and about 40% of the \nresidents in Phu Loc district are poor. The social and gender \nimpacts of the Project will be positive for all income groups, and \nthe benefits for low-income groups, women, and children will be \nsignificant. All project components will contribute significantly to \nimproving the urban environment and public health conditions, \nand will stimulate private investments in the towns. The Project \nwill strengthen community and beneficiary involvement in project \ndesign and implementation. Enhanced public awareness of urban \ndevelopment challenges, financial requirements for appropriate \nO&M of urban infrastructure, and relationships between health, \nenvironment, and economic progress are expected to increase \nwillingness  to  pay  for  services  and  demand  for  greater \ntransparency and efficiency of urban service providers and local \nauthorities monitoring their performance. \n \nThe Project will improve drainage and sewerage, reduce flooding, \nand benefit around 504,000 people. The Lang Co subproject will \nbenefit an additional 158,000 permanent residents in Chan May \ntown and Phu Loc district through the proposed regional solid \nwaste system. Urban residents will benefit from improved health \nand living conditions resulting from reduced flooding, removal of \nwastewater from urban areas, increased coverage of solid waste \ncollection,  and  flood-free  land.  The  Lang  Co  subproject  will \nsupport tourism development and provide increased opportunities \nfor employment for local residents. The Project will improve  the \nsustainability of urban services, leading to increased coverage \nand improved service levels for residents, businesses, and other \nuser groups. \n   ", "vi   \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risks associated with the Project are (i) limited human \nresources and capacities of TPCs, URENCOs, and town-level \nwomen\u2019s  unions  for  project  implementation;  (ii)  uncertainty \nregarding tariff increases necessary to ensure sustainability of \nurban services; (iii) insufficient community participation in project \nimplementation, particularly from women and the poor; (iv) poor \nand vulnerable households negatively affected by resettlement; \n(v)  delays  caused  by  the  lack  of  experience  of  the  PMUs  in \nmanaging  an  ADB-funded  project;  and  (vi)  lack  of  local \ngovernment ownership of sanitation facilities.  \n \nThe project incorporates mitigation measures to address these \nrisks. They include (i) an institutional strengthening program for \nTPCs, URENCOs, and town-level women\u2019s unions to increase \ntheir managerial and operational capacities; (ii) a detailed, time-\nbound tariff increase program for urban environmental services \naffordable to all citizens and agreed by PPCs; (iii) a participation \nprogram, gender action plan, and public awareness campaigns \nincluded in the project design; (iv) a resettlement framework and \nresettlement  plans  to  ensure  that  affected  people  maintain  or \nimprove their living standard after project completion; (v) the PCU \nand consultants with experience in implementing ADB-assisted \nprojects will help PMUs establish effective project management, \nreporting, and bidding procedures; and (vi) local ownership is \nensured  through  PPCs\u2019  commitment  to  tariff  increases  and \nallocation of revenues for O&M. \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nloan  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Central  Region  Urban  Environmental \nImprovement Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Following the request of the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam (the \nGovernment),  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  technical  assistance  (TA)1 to \nprepare the Central Region Urban Environmental Improvement Project. The TA built on a \nprevious ADB-supported TA2 study. The Project will contribute to the economic and social \ndevelopment of the central region of Viet Nam and promote balanced regional development. It \nwill complement other ADB interventions in the region in the framework of the Country Strategy \nand Program (CSP) for Viet Nam.3 \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s population in 2003 is almost 80 million, about 20 million in urban areas. \nUrbanization  has  increased  markedly\u2014from 20% in 1990 to about 25% in 2003\u2014and the \nGovernment estimates that about 45% of the population will live in urban areas by 2020. Lack of \nsufficient land, capital investment, and employment opportunities in rural areas and towns in the \ncentral region  over the past decade have fuelled  migration to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City \n(HCMC). The population of the two major cities increased about 1.5 times over the past 10 \nyears, and now accounts for almost 40% of the country\u2019s total urban population. Hanoi and \nHCMC have attracted most foreign investment and assistance, adding to the attraction for rural \nmigrants to these cities and harming balanced urban and regional development. Furthermore, \nrapid migration to the two major cities has caused deterioration of the urban environment, \nexacerbation of urban poverty, and worsening urban unemployment.  \n \n4.  Despite substantial migration away from the central region over the past 10 years, that \narea\u2019s urban  population  continues  growing  at  an  average  of  4.7%  a  year. In 1999, cities \naccounted for 20.6% of total population in the region compared to 17.5% 10 years earlier. \nDuring the last decade, the urban population of the region rose 56% to 4.5 million, compared \nwith a national increase of 43%. Population in project towns has grown quickly and ranges from \n57,000 in Ha Tinh to 186,000 in Thanh Hoa, while the district town of Lang Co has about 11,000 \npermanent residents. Urban poverty levels in the project towns are higher than the national \naverage urban poverty level, ranging from 13.5% to 19.2%.  \n \n5.  Urban infrastructure in the six project towns is unable to meet the growing demand \nbecause of lack of capital investment, lack of funds for maintenance, and weak institutional \narrangements. Project towns have combined drainage systems in which wastewater and storm \nwater are conveyed in common conduits then discharged in rivers or other watercourses. \nCoverage of the drainage systems in urban areas is very low, ranging from less than 0.1 meter \n(m) per capita in the district town of Lang Co to 0.2-0.4 m per capita in the provincial towns. \nCovered drains are usually limited to main roads in high- or medium-density areas. In the \nproject towns, annual flooding occurs in more than 30\u201340% of the urban area. While around \n40% of households in provincial towns and 10% in the district town have septic tanks, only a few \nare connected to sewers or drains. Composting latrines and defecation in open areas are used \ninstead. They create major health risks, particularly during floods. Solid waste is collected from \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Country Strategy and Program  (2002\u20132004): Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Manila. ", "2 \n60\u201382% of urban households in provincial towns, and from 7% in Lang Co. It is then deposited \nin unsanitary landfills. The remaining uncollected waste is burned or dumped in the streets and \nvacant land, and eventually ends up in the drainage system. About 61% of the collected solid \nwaste is generated by domestic activities, with only 20\u201330% from industries. About 15\u201325% of \nsolid waste is recycled, mostly by waste collectors in urban areas or by scavengers at landfills.  \n \n6.  Project  towns  require  improved  environmental  infrastructure  if  they  are  to  become \neffective centers of economic growth, attract investment, generate employment opportunities, \nand eventually draw rural migrants away from the magnet of Hanoi and HCMC. The five \nprovincial capitals included in the Project need to improve their urban infrastructure systems and \nservice coverage so that they can function as sustainable regional economic centers. Major \ntourism development planned for Lang Co over the next 5\u201310 years has potential to pollute \nbeaches, waterways, and groundwater and will increase health risks unless steps are taken to \nupgrade sewerage and sanitation. One of the Government\u2019s policy objectives is to address \nproblems caused by migration to the major cities and correct the imbalance in living standards \nbetween the major cities and poorer areas in the central region.  Providing adequate urban \ninfrastructure and services is a key factor in addressing the imbalance in regional development. \nThe Project framework is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \n7.  The Government selected the project towns based on a comparative analysis of towns in \nthe 18 provinces in the central region. Selection criteria included (i) urban population growth, (ii) \nurban and rural poverty levels, (iii) economic development  potential,  and  (iv) infrastructure \nneeds. The district town of Lang Co was selected as a pilot case for sustainable urban \nenvironmental management in a very small town because of its tourism potential. The five \nprovincial capitals act as administrative and economic centers for their surrounding rural areas, \nand provide most of the nonagricultural employment in their provinces.   \n \n8.  Since the mid-1980s, external funding agencies have provided loans of more than $700 \nmillion for developing drainage, sanitation, and solid waste projects in Viet Nam. Approximately \n65% of this amount has financed environmental improvement projects in HCMC ($308 million) \nand Hanoi ($156 million). In provincial towns, external assistance has focused on water supply \nsystems, but investment in drainage, sanitation, and solid waste improvements in the towns has \nbeen  relatively  small,  particularly  in  the  central  region.  Detailed  information  on  external \nassistance to Viet Nam\u2019s urban sector is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n9.  The  key  problems  of  the  urban  sector  in  Viet  Nam  include  (i)  inadequate  capital \ninvestment in drainage, wastewater, sanitation, and solid waste systems; (ii) lack of central \ngovernment guidance for urban management, slow implementation of policy reforms at the \nprovincial  level,  and  an  incomplete  legal  framework;  (iii)  weak  and  unaccountable  urban \ninstitutions  and  poorly  defined  institutional  arrangements;  (iv)  inadequate  cost  recovery \nmechanisms to obtain sufficient financial resources for proper operation and maintenance \n(O&M);  (v)  insufficient  technical  and  managerial  human  resources  capacity  in  urban \nmanagement and services agencies; and (vi) poor community awareness and participation in \nplanning and management of urban services, particularly for women. A detailed urban sector \nanalysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n10.  Since  1990,  the  Government  has  introduced  policies  and  reforms  to  improve  the \nefficiency of the urban sector and promote urban development. The Comprehensive Poverty \nReduction and Growth Strategy 2001\u20132010 mentions several objectives relevant to the urban \nsector, including  (i) promoting balanced and sustainable economic growth between regions; ", "3 \n(ii) developing urban areas to create more jobs and improve living standards;4 (iii) strengthening \nenvironment protection and ensuring a healthy environment;5  (iv) promoting gender equity and \nenhancing the participation of women at all levels of leadership; (v) implementing fully  the \ndecree on democracy at the grassroots level to improve people\u2019s participation in local economic \ndevelopment; and (vi) strengthening accountability at all levels, especially local governments, by \nimproving transparency of and publicity for local budgets. \n  \n11.  The Government\u2019s policies for urban development are presented in the Orientation Plan \nfor Urban Development to 2020. The orientation plan\u2019s objective is to progressively provide \nurban areas with appropriate modern infrastructure and a healthy environment to allow them to \nactively contribute to the country\u2019s socioeconomic development. The policy gives emphasis to (i) \ndeveloping  urban  centers  as  economic  growth  centers,  (ii)  developing  and  modernizing \ntechnical  and  social  infrastructure  to  attract  investment  and  improve  living  standards,  (iii) \nreducing gaps in economic development and living standards between urban and rural areas, \nand (iv) ensuring sustainable urban development by taking account of environmental factors \nand efficient use of natural resources. The plan recognizes the need to strengthen and improve \nthe efficiency of urban management systems and policies.  \n \n12.  The  Government\u2019s  development  targets  and  policies  for  drainage  and  sanitation, \nreflected in the Orientation Plan for Urban Drainage Development to 2020 are to (i) improve and \ncomplete urban drainage and sewerage systems to ensure a minimum of 80\u201390% coverage by \n2020, (ii) require enterprises to have onsite treatment for toxic liquid waste, (iii) eliminate pit \nlatrines in urban areas by 2005, (iv) provide waste collection systems that treat solid and liquid \nwastes,  and  (v)  gradually  rehabilitate  and  clean  the  canal  systems.  To  achieve  these \ndevelopment targets, the Government emphasizes the importance of institutional  reforms in \ndeveloping efficient and sustainable water and sanitation sectors. Specifically, the orientation \nplans call for (i) restructuring the Ministry of Construction (MOC) to refocus its functions in \ndevelopment planning, sector policy formulation, regulations, training, and technology transfer, \nand terminating its direct involvement in business activities; (ii) clearly defining the roles and \nresponsibilities of various Government agencies involved in the water and sanitation sector and \nencouraging better cooperation among these sector agencies; (iii) making provincial people\u2019s \ncommittees  (PPCs)  the  responsible  agencies  for  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  drainage \ndevelopment  in  the  provinces;  (iv)  providing  training  and  capacity  building  on  project \nimplementation  and  O&M  encouraging  service  providers  to  become  self-financing  and \nprogressively  eliminating  subsidies;  (v)  creating  the  legal  basis  for  providing  public  urban \nservices, with enhanced enforcement; (vi) promoting  community  education  and  awareness, \nparticularly on drainage and sanitation issues; (vii) mobilizing additional financial resources; (viii) \nprotecting water sources; (ix) upgrading technology and materials; and (x) developing human \nresources. \n \n13.  The Government\u2019s urban solid waste management strategy, which lasts until the year \n2020, sets out Government objectives and policies for managing solid waste in urban areas. \nOne of its targets is that cities and provincial towns will collect and dispose of at least 85% of \nurban and industrial solid waste in appropriate landfills by 2005, 90% by 2010, and 95% by \n2020. The strategy\u2019s long-term objectives for 2020 also include strengthening solid waste \nmanagement by (i) completing the legal framework to complement the Law on Environmental \nProtection;  (ii) increasing  investments  in  solid  waste  infrastructure  systems;  (iii)  promoting \nawareness and strengthening training in solid waste management and environmental protection; \n(iv)  reforming  cost  recovery  systems  to  ensure  that  fees  charged  to  organizations  and \n                                                 \n4  Specific measures include appropriate urban planning and design to ensure that sanitation and environmental \nrequirements are met, and taking proper account of the requirements of the urban poor and their ability to pay for \nurban services.  \n5  Specific measures include providing guidelines for environment protection and pollution reduction, reducing \nenvironmental degradation, and constructing wastewater and solid waste facilities in urban areas.  ", "4 \nhouseholds are sufficient to cover O&M costs for solid waste collection, transportation, and \ntreatment; (v) strengthening institutions engaged in solid waste management institutions; and \n(vi) adopting modern equipment and technology where appropriate. \n \n14.  In June 1999, MOC issued guidelines for setting water supply and drainage tariffs. PPCs \nstill hold authority to set tariffs, but the guidelines provide a framework and methodology for \nthem to use in establishing these tariffs. A drainage charge is to be no lower than 10% of the \ntotal water production cost. However, the guidelines give no timeframe for applying the drainage \ncharge. As a result, only a few provinces apply drainage and wastewater charges. At present, \ndrainage charges are levied in only one of the six project towns: Tam Ky. However, even there \nthe fees the PPC collects are not used for O&M for drainage and sewerage. For solid waste \nmanagement, tariffs are set at levels that do not allow sufficient funds to be collected for proper \nO&M. Although the Government has introduced policies and reforms to improve the financial \nautonomy and sustainability of urban service providers\u2014increasing cost-recovery through user \ncharges and gradually eliminating central Government subsidies\u2014existing policies have yet to \nbe fully implemented at the provincial level. \n \n15.  Town people\u2019s committees (TPCs) are responsible for administration in provincial and \ndistrict towns. Most TPCs have established urban management divisions, but they lack capacity \nto perform because of scarce human resources. In many cases there is confusion between the \nrole of the TPCs and the role of the departments of construction at the PPCs. TPCs do not have \nthe  mandate  or  capacity  to  fix  or  assign  performance  standards to urban environmental \ncompanies (URENCOs) or to monitor their performance. Poor performance by the URENCOs \nand TPCs results in a general lack of trust from citizens and a reluctance to pay service fees. \n \n16.  Urgent measures are necessary to address deteriorating environmental conditions in \nurban centers and transform them into sources of economic growth and employment. The \nProject will help the Government achieve its objectives for the urban sector by (i) providing \ncapital investment in urban areas of high government priority; (ii) supporting the preparation of \nnational guidelines on urban management and facilitating the implementation of national policies \nat the provincial level; (iii) improving urban institutions capabilities and institutional framework for \nurban  environmental  management;  (iv)  establishing  financial  mechanisms  to  ensure \nsustainability and O&M of environmental urban services, (v) improving managerial and technical \ncapacities of URENCOs and TPCs, and (vi) increasing community awareness and participation, \nparticularly among women, in planning and managing urban services. A policy and institutional \nreform agenda is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n 17.  Lessons Learned. Some major lessons have been learned through implementing water \nsupply  and  sanitation  projects  in  Viet  Nam  and  ADB  urban-sector interventions in other \ncountries. One key lesson is that projects often face delays in establishing project management \nunits (PMU), selecting consultants, acquiring land, resettling people, awarding contracts, and \nmaking  disbursements.  These  delays  have  increased  project  costs  and  frustrated  both \nbeneficiaries and local authorities. There is a need for (i) greater delegation of authority to \nlower-level government agencies for implementation, with central Government ministries acting \nas  facilitators;  (ii) intensive  assistance  to  the  executing  agencies  in  project  planning  and \nmanagement early during implementation; (iii) advance action for recruiting consultants; (iv) \nestablishment of PMUs during project preparation; and (v) timely preparation for land acquisition \nand resettlement. Early and systematic training in Government and ADB procedures for all \nproject  stakeholders\u2014including  provincial  agencies,  consultants,  counterpart  staff,  and \nrepresentatives of community groups\u2014will be essential to minimize delays. \n \n18.  Previous projects yield further lessons that have been incorporated in the Project. Community-\nbased activities and public health awareness programs have not been optimized in previous projects \nbecause PMUs were reluctant to allocate funds, coordination was lacking among local institutions, ", "5 \npublic awareness programs were poorly timed, and consultations with communities were limited. A \nmechanism is needed to ensure appropriate attention to this component and facilitate coordination \namong local stakeholders. Institutional capacities and framework must be improved to ensure efficient \nurban management and service delivery. Easy-to-implement cost recovery mechanisms must be \nestablished and the resources collected should be used for proper O&M. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n19.  The long-term goals of the Project are to (i) improve the quality of life and health status \nof urban residents and reduce poverty in the six project towns and surrounding areas, and \n(ii) promote balanced regional economic development and  reduce migration from the central \nregion to Hanoi and HCMC. The objective of the Project is to improve urban environmental \nconditions in project towns.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n20.  Project outputs include (i) expanding and upgrading urban environmental infrastructure; \n(ii) improving autonomy and managerial and technical capacity of the URENCOs; (iii) improving \nurban management and planning capacities of the TPCs; (iv) strengthening urban management \npolicies through support to the newly established Department of Urban Infrastructure in MOC; \n(v)  developing  appropriate  cost-recovery  mechanisms  to  ensure  sustainability  of  urban \nenvironmental  services;  (vi)   increasing  community  participation  in  planning  and  managing \nurban services, particularly by the poor; (vii) enhancing public health awareness; and (viii) \nenhancing the role of women in urban management and institutions.  \n \n21.  The Project will comprise five parts: part A, awareness and pro-poor sanitation; part B, \ndrainage and flood protection; part C, wastewater and public sanitation; part D, solid waste \nmanagement; and part E, implementation assistance and institutional strengthening. The project \narea includes the  provincial capital towns of Dong Ha, Ha Tinh, Quang Ngai, Tam Ky, and \nThanh Hoa, as well as the district-level town of Lang Co. Part D will also include Chan May \nurban area, Phu Loc district town, and four communes in Phu Loc District of Thua Thien Hue \nProvince. A detailed description of the components is presented in Supplementary Appendix B. \nA brief description follows. \n \n1.  Part A: Awareness and Pro-poor Sanitation \n22.  Part  A  includes  (i)  a  community  awareness  and  participation  program  (CAPP), \n(ii) community-based sanitation (CBS), and (iii) a household sanitation program (HSP). It will \ntarget poor and low-income households, communities, neighborhoods, and households without \nappropriate access to urban sanitation. \n \n23.  The CAPP consists of (i) raising community awareness on sanitation and health, and \nworking  with  URENCO  to  better  reach  female  staff  and  educate  landfill  scavengers  on \noccupational  health  hazards,  (ii)  raising  awareness  for  protecting  and  conserving  urban \nenvironmental  infrastructure,  (iii) motivating  households  to  connect  to  and  pay  for  urban \nenvironmental infrastructure and services, and (iv) informing potential beneficiaries on financial \nassistance available to improve community or household environmental sanitation. \n \n24.  The CBS aims to (i) improve community small infrastructure, and (ii) improve community \nparticipation and ownership in urban sanitation. The CBS will provide small grants, technical advice, \nand training for demand-driven, small-scale environmental sanitation improvements in urban areas \nnot covered by other major infrastructure components. Community groups and neighborhoods will \nselect, design, and implement local sanitation improvements, and will contribute to the works. \n \n25.  The HSP will provide grants, mostly to women, to help poor and low-income households \nwithin urban wards, to build septic tanks, toilets, and/or connect household wastewater to public ", "6 \ndrainage or sewage systems. The women\u2019s union in each town will administer the  program and \nprovide technical information to beneficiaries with the assistance of URENCOs and TPCs \nthrough the community management committee (CMC). \n \n2.  Part B: Drainage and Flood Protection \n26.  Part  B  includes  (i)  drainage  improvement,  and  (ii)  flood  protection  improvement. \nDrainage improvement will include improving flood regulating basins, rehabilitating and cleaning \n55  kilometers  (km)  of  existing  drains,  building  or  upgrading  60  km  of  primary  drains, \nconstructing 175 km of secondary drains, and building 138 km of tertiary drains to convey storm \nwater and wastewater to downstream outfalls. Major primary drains will follow existing drainage \nroutes, and will consist of box culverts in densely populated areas, or open channels with raised \nembankments in low-density areas. Flood protection improvement will include building dikes \nand roads, 3.0 km and 2.8 km long respectively, in Tam Ky and Dong Ha towns to protect \nriverside communities from frequent river flooding. \n \n3.  Part C: Wastewater and Public Sanitation \n27.  Part C includes (i) wastewater improvement, and (ii) public sanitation. The wastewater \ncomponent is designed to collect, treat, and safely dispose of wastewater from the urban areas \nin Thanh Hoa and Lang Co.  In Thanh Hoa, it includes building interceptor chambers on the \ncombined drains, close to their discharge points, to divert flows to the interceptor sewer. It also \nincludes 6 km of gravity sewers, 3 pumping stations, 3 km of sewage-rising mains to remove \nwastewater from the town, and a 13,500 cubic meter (m3)/day waste stabilization pond. In Lang \nCo, it will develop a separate sewerage system, comprising 28 km of sewers, 3 sewage-\npumping stations, 2 km of sewage-rising mains, a 4,750m3/day wastewater treatment plant, and \na 1-km access road with an asphalt surface. The public sanitation component aims to improve \npublic health and reduce pollution in the streets, canals, waterways, and lakes in project towns. \nFor each town, it will introduce a septic tank management system; improve sanitation facilities in \npublic areas such as markets, schools, bus stations, cultural centers, parks, and health clinics; \nand supply O&M equipment for sanitation. \n \n4.  Part D: Solid Waste Management \n28.  Part D will improve the collection, storage, and transport of municipal,  industrial and \nmedical solid waste in the Project towns. It includes (i) upgrading and expanding sanitary \nlandfills in Dong Ha, Ha Tinh, Quang Ngai, and Thanh Hoa and building a new landfill for Lang \nCo and Chan May towns, and Phu Loc district; (ii) upgrading 12.2 km of landfill access roads in \nfour towns and building a 1.8-km access road to the landfill in Thanh Hoa; (iii) constructing 77 \nlocal waste storage stations; and (iv) equipment for O&M of solid waste management system \nincluding 5 bulldozers, 5 excavators, 63 new compactor trucks, 560 handcarts, 99 pedicarts, \nand 9,875 portable storage bins. \n \n5.  Part E: Project Implementation Assistance and Institutional Strengthening \nProgram \n29.  Part E includes project implementation assistance and an institutional strengthening \nprogram (ISP) for TPCs, URENCOs, MOC\u2019s department of urban infrastructure, and town-level \nwomen\u2019s  unions.  The  project implementation assistance program  includes  (i)  design  and \nconstruction supervision of urban infrastructure, social, gender, environmental, and resettlement \naspects, as well as training and support for the project coordination unit (PCU) and PMUs; (ii) \nengineering and environmental surveys; and (iii) incremental administration support for allowances, \nvehicles, computers, and office equipment for PCU, PMUs, and town-level women\u2019s unions. \n \n30.  The ISP includes (i) training for TPCs on urban management and planning, as well as \nservice  contract  preparation  and  supervision;  (ii)  training  for  URENCOs  on  management ", "7 \ninformation systems, asset management systems, administrative and financial management, \nsocial  and  gender  issues,  O&M  for  project  works,  planning,  budgeting,  communication \ntechniques,  bookkeeping,  accounting  and  reporting;  (iii) technical  support  and  on-the-job \ntraining  to  MOC\u2019s  department  of  urban  infrastructure  on  preparing  guidelines  on  urban \nmanagement for provincial towns, and guidelines on drainage, sanitation, and solid waste tariffs, \nand organizing national workshops on urban management and financing; (iv) training in public \nhealth awareness, community-based sanitation, and a household sanitation program for each \ntown\u2019s women\u2019s union, including coordinating, financial, and management opportunities; and (v) \ncomputer hardware and software for URENCOs.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n31.  Poverty. The Project has been classified as a poverty intervention strategy, and will \ncontribute to achieving the objectives of the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth \nStrategy 2001\u20132010. The urban poor in project towns live in underserved areas where drainage \nis dysfunctional or nonexistent, flooding is frequent, access to solid waste collection is limited, \nsanitation is inadequate, and the environment is polluted because of poor toilet and septic tank \nfacilities. About 21.2% of project beneficiaries are poor. Poverty rates in the six project towns \nare higher than the national urban average of 11.1% while poverty levels in the rural area of Phu \nLoc district is higher than the national average.  About 16.3% of the urban population in the \nproject towns and about 40% of the residents in Chan May town and Phu Loc district are poor. \nThe  Project  will  develop  and expand urban services to poor and low-income households, \ngenerate  new  employment  opportunities,  develop  community  ownership  and  self-reliance, \nreduce the risk of disease through health awareness programs, and ensure a sustainable \nenvironment. The Project will directly address one of the Millennium Development Goals and \nTargets (MDGTs) referring to sanitation improvements, and will contribute to achieving other \nMDGTs by improving health of the local population and reducing poverty and vulnerability. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 4. A poverty and social \nanalysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n32.  Gender. The issue of gender has received special attention during project preparation. \nWomen are responsible for a variety of tasks relating to sanitation and waste collection at the \ncommunity  and  household  levels.  More  than  half  of  the  URENCO  staff  in  project  towns \nemployed as sweepers and waste collectors are women. Scavengers, collecting waste in the \nlandfill sites, are mostly women. By occupying low-level jobs in institutions and communities, \nmost women lack opportunities or capacity to hold managerial positions. Females tend to be \nunderrepresented in decision-making positions, despite having a large membership base in the \nwomen\u2019s union. The Project builds on the past experiences of the women\u2019s unions in previous \nADB-funded water supply and sanitation projects. Through part A, the Project will (i) provide \ninstitutional capacity building for the Women\u2019s Union to ensure effective implementation; (ii) \noffer  coordinating,  financial,  and  management  opportunities  for  the  Women\u2019s  Union;  (iii) \nincrease  access  to  female  beneficiaries  of  poor  and  low-income  households;  (iv)  make \nprovisions for increased gender awareness and representation within URENCO; and (v) work to \nenhance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. A summary gender analysis and action \nplan is presented in Appendix 5 and a comprehensive gender analysis and action plan is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n33.  Involuntary Resettlement. The Project will involve land acquisition and resettlement of \npeople and businesses. It will require acquisition of 138 hectares of land, of which 110 hectares \nis agricultural land that will be lost because of improvements in drainage and flood protection, \nwastewater  and  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  infrastructure.  A  total  of  2,337  households \n(approximately 10,571 people), including shops and businesses, will be affected, of which 1,100 \nhouseholds, including shops and businesses, will be severely affected. The remaining 1,237 \nhouseholds will be marginally affected. The cost of  resettlement of people affected by the ", "8 \nProject is estimated at $7.7 million, including implementation costs and contingencies. The \nimpact is significant due to the construction of landfill sites, wastewater treatment plants, dike-\nroads, and flood-regulating basins. Community-based sanitation programs may require some \nland acquisition for the construction of drains, footpaths, or solid waste collection units.  \n \n34.  Efforts have been made to avoid and, where possible, minimize the level of impact. \nAffected people will be compensated for their losses at full replacement cost, and provided with \ntransition allowances and rehabilitation measures. Priority consideration will be given to affected \npeople  who  participate  in  community  and  household  sanitation  programs  under  part  A. \nAdditional support has been included for the poor, vulnerable, and female-headed households. \nA full resettlement plan for each of the project towns has been prepared based on inventory of \nlosses and socioeconomic surveys, including focus-group discussions with affected people and \nlocal authorities. A resettlement framework has been prepared to guide any unforeseen land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  planning  during  project  implementation.  A  summary  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement is presented in Appendix 6. Resettlement plans for each project \ntown and an overall resettlement framework are presented in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n35.  Environment. The Project is classified as environment category B. The Project will not \nresult in any serious negative environmental impacts because proposed project activities are \ndesigned to improve the quality of life and physical environment of the urban population, and the \nadverse environmental impacts arising from the design, construction, and operation of proposed \nactivities will be temporary, minor, localized, and can be minimized to acceptable levels through \nmitigation measures and monitoring programs identified in an initial environmental examination \n(IEE). No project activities will be located close to or within designated environmentally sensitive \nareas such as national parks or natural resource conservation reserves. Each project town has \nprepared an IEE, including an environmental management plan (EMP), with the support of the \nconsultants,  which  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  environmental  authorities \nconcerned. PMUs and the departments of natural resources and environment (DNREs) in each \nprovince will regularly monitor all construction activities. Water-quality monitoring will be carried \nout  for  all  sewerage  treatment  plants  and  the  landfill  works  by  designated  environmental \nmonitoring  laboratories  at  the  provincial  level.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for \nenvironmental  assessment,  as  well  as  government  regulations  on  environmental  impact \nassessment, an updated IEE for each project town will be submitted to the DNRE of each \nprovince and to ADB before civil works begin.   \n \n36.  To ensure that all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, regulations, and \nstandards\u2014as  well  as  ADB  environmental  requirements\u2014will  be  met  during  design, \nconstruction, and operation, an EMP for each project town has been prepared and will be \ncarried out by the PMU at the provincial level, in collaboration with the DNRE concerned. During \nproject preparation, local people have been informed about potential negative environmental \nimpacts and mitigation measures included in the EMP, and the IEEs have been translated into \nVietnamese. The PPC of each project province has assured ADB that  mitigation measures \nidentified in the IEE will be incorporated into design, construction, and operation of subprojects. \nEnvironmental measures requiring action from contractors will be incorporated in civil works \ncontracts. Implementation of proposed environmental mitigation measures will be monitored by \nthe PMUs with the support of DNREs. Monitoring results will be reported to the PCU, MOC, \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment, and ADB through semiannual progress reports \non project implementation and annual reports on environmental monitoring.   \n \n37.  To ensure that the IEE and EMP can be successfully implemented in each project town, at \nleast one environment specialist will be placed at each PMU. An environmental capacity-building \ncomponent to the PCU and the PMUs has been included. An appropriate budget has been included to \nimplement proposed mitigation measures as well as capacity-building activities identified in the EMP. ", "9 \nA summary IEE is presented in Appendix 7. A summary EMP is presented in Supplementary \nAppendix F, and IEEs for each project town are presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n38.  Community Participation. All project components were formulated after discussions with \nconcerned government officials and consultations with affected communities and beneficiaries. The \nProject is designed so that it is responsive to the communities' needs, will function on a sustainable \nbasis, and will have no adverse social or environmental impacts. The Project will promote grassroots \nparticipation  in  urban  infrastructure  planning  and  environmental  improvements  by  providing \ncommunity groups with (i) adequate information about community and household sanitation programs; \n(ii) sufficient opportunities to participate during project preparation, implementation, maintenance, and \noperations; and (iii) concerted capacity building for poor and low-income communities in developing \nownership and self-reliance. The scope of part A was tightened as a result of clear identification of the \nprimary stakeholders, and extensive consultation with project beneficiaries through participatory \napproaches. Subsequent mechanisms to increase community participation will enable community \ngroups and individual households to set their own priorities for urban environmental improvements, \nand to utilize and manage sanitation and solid waste subcomponents based on collective resources \nand contributions. Results of participation with affected people illustrate different community dynamics \nand reactions to resettlement as reflected in resettlement plans. Consultation with local communities \non environmental issues has been incorporated into the IEEs and EMP.  \n \n39.  Strengthening  of  Urban  Policies  and  Institutions.  The  Project  will  improve  the \nefficiency and sustainability of urban services in project towns by improving the institutional and \noperational framework for urban management and delivery of urban environmental services. At \nthe national level, the Project will support MOC to prepare guidelines on urban management, as \nwell as guidelines on drainage, sanitation, and solid waste tariffs. At the town level, the Project \nwill support the urban management divisions of the TPCs to improve their capacities in urban \nplanning and management, and to become efficient units able to monitor the quality and level of \nservices delivered by URENCOs and other public or private service providers. \n \n40.  The Project will support the transformation of URENCOs into autonomous and efficient \ncompanies, accountable to the TPCs and their clients. The Project will promote institutional and \nlegal reforms at the provincial level and provide technical support to URENCOs to allow them to \n(i) establish accounting systems and separate budgets and accounts following Vietnamese \nAccounting Standards for each of their main activities, distinguishing between (a) drainage and \nwastewater, (b) solid waste management, (c) other O&M activities, and (d) new construction \nactivities; (ii) change the focus of URENCOs to management and O&M of urban infrastructure \nby  progressively  separating  construction  units;  (iii)  calculate,  recommend,  and  justify \nappropriate fees for drainage, wastewater, and solid waste to clients and people\u2019s councils, and \nagree on appropriate service levels with TPCs; (iv) own equipment for O&M and keep sufficient \nfunds for depreciation of equipment and repayment of loans;  (v) collect drainage and solid \nwaste fees, retaining all revenues in two separate accounts and using them solely for O&M of \nthe solid waste and drainage and wastewater facilities, respectively, under the responsibility of a \nURENCO; (vi) impose penalties on people who do not pay for services received, or destroy \nurban infrastructure under their responsibility; (vii) adopt and implement efficient and effective \nasset management procedures; (viii) prepare and adopt O&M plans, manuals, and procedures; \nand (ix) implement efficient financial and management information systems. \n \n41.  Improved Financial Sustainability of Urban Environmental Services. The Project will \nsupport  Government  policy  by  helping  URENCOs  generate  more  revenue  from  their  own \nsources,  and  gradually  reduce  Government  subsidies.  Tariffs  will  be  increased  so  that \nURENCOs can collect enough resources to pay all O&M costs and depreciation of O&M \nequipment for drainage, wastewater, and solid waste management. Recommended tariffs have \nbeen calculated so they are affordable to low-income and poor people. Water supply companies \nin each province will collect charges for drainage and wastewater services on behalf of the ", "10 \nURENCO as a surcharge on the water tariff, then transfer the revenue to a dedicated account in \nURENCO. A new environmental fee or a surcharge on the land and property tax, which will \napply to all households and organizations in the town, will be levied directly by the TPC to \nfinance capital investments in urban environmental infrastructure. The URENCO will continue to \ncollect charges for solid waste services directly from customers and will progressively increase \nthose charges. The URENCO will sign service contracts with the TPC for the O&M of urban \ninfrastructure, which will include payments from the TPC to the URENCO for providing services to \nthe town without a direct cost recovery mechanism, such as street lights, road cleaning, parks, \ngreen areas, and cemeteries. The TPC will also continue payments to the URENCO for drainage, \nwastewater, and solid waste systems until the URENCO has reached full cost recovery through \ndirect charges. All fees and payments from the TPC to the URENCO will be based on proper O&M \nand service levels, agreed between the TPC, URENCO, and users of the service. \n \n42.  Focus on the Central Region. To avoid the destabilizing effect of significant migration to \nHanoi and HCMC, Viet Nam needs to develop a network of provincial and district towns in the central \nregion that can provide economic opportunity and quality of life for a population gradually released \nfrom farming. The Project will support ADB\u2019s overall strategy, as noted in the CSP, of focusing a \nsignificant part of its interventions on the central region. It will complement other ongoing and future \nADB interventions in the central region to ensure more balanced regional economic development. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n43.  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, duties, taxes, and interest \nduring construction, is estimated at $96.0 million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost is $53.6 million \nequivalent, or 55.8% of total. The local currency cost, including duties and taxes, is $42.4 million \nequivalent, or 44.2% of total. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. Cost estimates for each \ntown are presented in Appendix 8 with further details in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n44.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $44.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to cover 45.8% of the total project cost. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. It will bear an interest rate of 1% during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter. The Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) will provide two loans for a total \nof  of 30 million euros ($31.8 million equivalent) for joint financing of under parts B, C, and E of the \nProject. The proposed AFD loans have two components: a normal loan (or PS1) of $26.5 million \nequivalent for physical works, and a concessional loan (or PTC) of $5.3 million equivalent for \ncapacity strengthening. The PS1 loan will have a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 7 years, \nand an interest rate of 2.5% for the entire term of the loan. The PTC loan will have a maturity of 30 \nyears, with a grace period of 10 years and an interest rate of 1% for the entire term of the loan. The \nremaining $20.2 million, equivalent to 21.1% of the total project cost, is the local counterpart \ncontribution financed by the PPCs and beneficiaries.6 The financing plan is summarized in Table 2 \nand detailed financing plans for each project town are presented in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n45.  The Borrower of proposed ADB and AFD loans will be the Government of Viet Nam. The \nloans will finance the entire foreign exchange cost and part of the local currency cost. Part of the loan \nfrom ADB will be onlent by the Government to URENCOs7 through subsidiary loans in domestic \ncurrency to cover the cost of O&M equipment for drainage and flood protection, waste water and \npublic sanitation, and solid waste components. The remaining part of the ADB loan and the entire AFD \n                                                 \n6  The beneficiaries of community-based sanitation subcomponent under part A of the Project will contribute 20% of \nthe cost. \n7  The PPCs will act as guarantors of the subsidiary loans from the Government to URENCOs. The total loan amount \nto be onlent to the URENCOs is estimated at $12.5 million equivalent (Ha Tinh, $1.6 million; Quang Nam, $2.0 \nmillion; Quang Ngai, $2.2 million; Quang Tri, $1.5 million; Thanh Hoa, $2.7 million; and Thua Thien Hue, $2.3 \nmillion) ", "11 \nloan will be provided to PPCs as grants. The subsidiary loans to URENCOs will have maturities of 20 \nyears,  grace  periods  of  6  years,  and  fixed  interest  rates  at  5.4%.  The  PMUs  will  provide  a \ncombination of loans and grants to women\u2019s unions for the HSP subcomponent. \n Table 1: Project Cost Summary \n($ million) \n \n        Foreign  Local  Total \nComponent    Cost  Costa  Cost \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n46.  The PPC will be the executing agency in each project province. Each PPC has set up a \nprovincial  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  which  will  have  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation  and  policy  guidance.  The  PSCs  comprise  senior  officials  from  the  PPCs, \nprovincial departments of construction, departments of finance, departments of planning and \ninvestment, DNREs, TPCs, women\u2019s unions, URENCOs, and the project director. The PSC will \nprovide  policy  guidance,  and  coordinate  provincial  agencies  to  ensure  quality  and  timely \nimplementation. Each PPC has established a PMU with full-time professional staff in each TPC, \nexcept Thua Thien Hue and Quang Ngai provinces, where PMUs have been established in the \ndepartment of construction of the PPC and the URENCO, respectively. The PMU will support \nthe PSC and will be responsible for daily implementation. The PMU will comprise staff from the \nTPC, URENCO, and other provincial, town, or district-level agencies, with expertise in project \nmanagement,  drainage,  sanitary  engineering,  environmental  management,  accounting, \ncommunity education, and development. \n \n47.  For overall project coordination at the national level, a project advisory committee (PAC) \nwill be established, if necessary. The PAC will be convened, if requested by any of its members, \nto discuss common problems affecting implementation, and exchange policy, technical, and \nfinancial lessons learnt.  It will consist of one senior official from MOC as chairperson and \npersonnel from the six project provinces as members. The PAC may invite other relevant \nministries, ADB, or AFD staff to participate as observers. A project coordination unit (PCU) has \nbeen established in MOC  comprising full-time and part-time professional staff with adequate \nproject experience and proficiency in English language. The PCU will act as a secretariat to the \nPAC and will be responsible for overall coordination of the Project; selection and management \nof consultants; handling of audited statements of project accounts; and consolidation of project \nreports to be submitted to ADB, AFD, and the Government. Other PCU functions include (i) \ndeveloping a common accounting software for the PPCs, (ii) disseminating information on \ndisbursement and withdrawal guidelines to PPCs and training staff in their use, (iii) keeping \ncentralized registration of withdrawal applications and auditing, (iv) ensuring compliance with \nloan covenants, and (v) monitoring and evaluating project performance to ensure that the \nobjectives are being met. \n \n48.  A community management committee (CMC), chaired by a senior member of the town\u2019s \nwomen\u2019s union, will be established in each province for overall managing and implementing of \npart A. The CMC will include representatives of the URENCO, TPC, and women\u2019s union. Other \nmass organizations could also be invited to participate in the CMC on an ad-hoc basis. The \nwomen\u2019s union in each town will be responsible for daily implementation activities under part A. \nThe project management mechanism is presented in Appendix 9.  \n ", "13 \n2.  Implementation Period \n49.  The Project will be implemented during 5.5 years until 30 June 2009. This is reasonable, \nbased on the proposed size of individual subprojects and the commitment and interest shown \nby all implementing agencies.  An implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n50.  Goods and works to be financed by ADB and AFD will be procured in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures will be \nused for major civil works contracts estimated to cost over $2.0 million and supply contracts \nvalued over $500,000. Procurement of minor  civil works and equipment will be undertaken \nthrough local competitive bidding (LCB) in accordance with procedures  acceptable to ADB. \nInternational  shopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for  materials  and  equipment  packages \nestimated to cost more than $100,000 equivalent but less than $500,000 equivalent. Equipment \nthat is locally available, and costs less than $100,000  equivalent, may be procured through \ndirect purchase in accordance with procedures satisfactory to ADB. For the CBS component \nunder part A, where  most subprojects will be relatively small, and scattered throughout the \ntowns,  the  Project  will  consider  funding  suitable  nongovernmental  organizations  or  mass \norganizations  to  work  in  a  collaborative  and  participatory  manner  with  local  communities \nfollowing ADB\u2019s community participation guide. \n \n51.  The ICB contracts are expected to include separate contracts in each province for \n(i) building drainage, flood protection, and wastewater works; (ii) O&M equipment for solid waste \nmanagement; and (iii) O&M equipment for drainage and sanitation. The LCB contracts are \nexpected to include (i) separate contracts in  each province for building landfills, solid waste \nstorage stations, repair workshops, and landfill access roads; and (ii) separate LCB contracts in \neach province for building drainage and public sanitation facilities. Force accounts (i.e., for \nURENCO\u2019s  staff  and  resources)  will  be  used  to  clean  and  rehabilitate  drains.  Indicative \nprocurement packaging is presented in Appendix 11. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n52.  To support project implementation, a total of 1,220 person-months of consulting services \n(116  person-months  international  and  1,104  person-months  domestic)  will  be  required  for \nproject management, resettlement, gender, and environmental aspects, as well as design and \nconstruction  supervision  of  urban  infrastructure.  In  addition,  consultants  will  support  the \ninstitutional strengthening program through the preparation and delivery of on-the-job training \nand capacity building programs for TPCs\u2019 urban management divisions, URENCOs, CMCs, and \nwomen\u2019s  unions  on  urban  management;  service  contract  preparation  and  supervision;  an \nengineering, accounting, and management awareness program; community-based sanitation; \nand a household sanitation program. Consultants will also support MOC\u2019s urban infrastructure \ndepartment in preparing guidelines on institutional aspects of urban management of provincial \ntowns, and guidelines on drainage, sanitation, and solid waste tariffs. \n \n53.  Consultants will be engaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. For \npurposes of expediency, standardization, and cost effectiveness, the PCU will be responsible \nfor recruiting and managing the consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method. \nAn  international  consulting  firm,  in  association  with  domestic  consultants,  will  provide  the \nconsulting services. An outline of the terms of reference for consulting services is presented in \nAppendix  12.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. ", "14 \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n54.  Payment of eligible expenditures from loan proceeds will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of January 2001. To ensure the timely release of loan \nproceeds, and to expedite project implementation, the PCU will open and maintain an imprest \naccount immediately upon loan effectiveness for the administrative expenditures of the PCU. \nThe administrative expenditures of the PCU not paid by the ADB loan, such as taxes and duties \non equipment, will be shared by PPCs as part of their counterpart fund contributions. Each PMU \nwill also set up an imprest account at the provincial level for disbursing eligible funds relating to \nsmall  contracts  under  local  competitive  bidding,  direct  purchase,  international  shopping, \ncommunity-based sanitation, and incremental administrative expenses. The PCU and each \nPMU will set up imprest accounts with commercial banks acceptable to ADB and will be \nresponsible for the use, management, replenishment, and liquidation of the imprest account. \n \n55.  The initial deposit to the imprest accounts will be based on estimated expenditures for \nthe first 6 months of project implementation, to be prepared by the PCU and each PMU, but will \nnot  exceed  the  equivalent  of $500,000 for each imprest account. Withdrawal applications, \nincluding imprest account replenishment requests, will be prepared by the PCU and PMUs and \nsent to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for approval. MOF will forward the approved applications \nto ADB and AFD, with a copy to the PCU. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures \nmay be used for reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating advances to the imprest \naccount. The ceiling on the SOE is $100,000 per payment. Funds for the household sanitation \nprogram will be disbursed through PMUs\u2019 imprest accounts to the town-level women\u2019s unions.  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  PMUs,  with  assistance  from  consultants,  will  set  up  project  accounts  according  to \ngovernment regulations. The consultants will provide training and operating support to the PCU \nand PMUs\u2019 accounting staff on the use of these accounts during the initial stage of project \nimplementation. Auditors acceptable to ADB will examine the project accounts, including the \nimprest  accounts  and  financial  statements  of  the  URENCOs.  The  PMUs  will  prepare  the \nrequired  information  for  audit  in  accordance  with  project  auditing  requirements  of  the \nGovernment and ADB. Auditing of the project accounts and financial statements of URENCOs \nwill  be  carried  out  annually,  and  audited  statements  of  project  accounts  and  URENCOs\u2019 \nfinancial statements will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the close of the Government's \nfiscal year. \n \n57.  Each PMU will prepare quarterly project progress reports within 30 days after the end of \nreporting  period,  then  submit  them  to  the  PCU  for  consolidation  and  reporting  to  the \nGovernment and ADB. The reports will provide a description of progress during the reporting \nperiod,  any  modifications  to  the  implementation  schedule,  details  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, problems and difficulties experienced, remedial actions proposed, and the work to \nbe carried out during the upcoming reporting period. The PMUs\u2019 quarterly progress reports will \ninclude summaries of expenditures during the quarter, year-to-date expenditures, and total \nexpenditures to date. URENCOs will prepare annual financial statements, including balance \nsheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. A project completion report will be \nsubmitted by each PMU to the PCU for consolidation and submission to the Government and \nADB within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. The project completion report will \nhighlight the development impacts achieved by the Project. All reports and the associated \nfinancial accounts and data will be presented to ADB in English. \n ", "15 \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n58.  The  PPC  in  each  province  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  a  comprehensive \nprogram for project benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) acceptable to ADB is carried out as \npart of the project performance monitoring system (PPMS) to (I) examine the Project\u2019s technical \nperformance, (ii) evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities, (iii) assess the achievement of \nthe Project\u2019s objectives, and (iv) measure the Project\u2019s social and economic benefits. A set of \nBME indicators has been developed in consultation with the local communities. BME\u2014to be \ndeveloped  under  the  institutional  development  program\u2014will  be  integrated  into  the \nmanagement information system of the PMUs and URENCOs so that monitoring of social and \neconomic benefits can continue beyond project implementation. Annual BME reports will be \nprepared by each PMU, then consolidated by the PCU and submitted to ADB. The integrated \nsystem for managing, monitoring, and evaluating project benefits, social impacts, and physical \nimprovements  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  PPMS.  A  BME  framework  is  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n \n8.  Project Review \n59.  In addition to regular reviews, a midterm review will also be undertaken within 36 months \nof loan effectiveness. This review will include a comprehensive evaluation of implementation \narrangements, a detailed evaluation of the project scope, and the progress of implementation \ncompared with scheduled targets. It will also cover the status of subproject progress and \nimplementation,  feedback  from  the  PPMS,  performance  of  consultants,  institutional \ndevelopment  components,  and  possible  reallocation  of  loan  proceeds.  Cost-recovery \nmechanisms  for  each  subproject  will  also  be  evaluated  and  remedial  action  instituted  as \nneeded. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Social and Gender Impacts \n60.  The Project will directly benefit a total of 504,000 people in the six project towns, of \nwhich 50% are women. Rural population in the areas around these towns will also indirectly \nbenefit. Reduced migration to Hanoi and HCMC because of improved quality of life in the \nproject area will reduce pressure on Hanoi\u2019s and HCMC\u2019s  urban systems. Improvements to \nurban environmental infrastructure will bring about increased social benefits to local residents \nand communities and to the urban development sector in general. Inadequate infrastructure \nsystems  pose  serious  environmental  and  health  risks,  and  inhibit  social  and  economic \ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  aim  to  reduce  environment-related  diseases,  lower  medical \nexpenses, and lessen the impact of flooding on household incomes from lost working days and \nhousehold damages. For the poor and low-income communities, the impact will be the most \nvisible. Many reside in low-lying, flood-prone areas where improving drainage, sanitation, and \nsolid waste systems are pivotal to improved health and hygiene.  \n \n61.  Other social and gender benefits include increased community participation by the poor \nand women and enhanced self-reliance in urban environmental management. Women are \nresponsible for a variety of tasks relating to sanitation at both the family and community levels, \nespecially as sweepers and waste collectors employed by a URENCO. Increasing the role of \nwomen in urban management and institutions will (i) improve sanitation and public health \npractices, and (ii) strengthen the capacity of women to hold managerial positions and take \nownership for small-scale urban environmental improvements within their communities. Through \ndemand-based interventions, upgrading a small fishing village in Lang Co will have significant \nsocial and economic benefits, including the potential to participate in the tourism industry. ", "16 \n \nB.   Economic Benefits \n62.  The  economic  analysis  has  been  undertaken  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects (1997) and ADB\u2019s Framework for the Economic and Financial \nAppraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects  (1994). The analysis comprises least-cost \nanalyses of alternative options for all project components and a cost-benefit analysis for the \ndrainage component in each town. The major economic benefits arise from reduced incidence \nand severity of flooding. These have been quantified in terms of resource cost savings from \navoided (i) damage to property; (ii) cleanup costs after flooding; (iii) time lost due to travel \ndelays; (iv) lost employment opportunities; (v) loss of business income; (vi) medical costs and \npublic  health  expenditure  related  to  waterborne  diseases;  and  (vii)  expenditure  on  the \nmaintenance  for  roads,  drains,  and  other  municipal  infrastructure  damaged  by  floods. \nNonquantifiable benefits include reduced threat of disruption to social activities and stress \ncaused by such events to the urban communities. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \ncalculated for each town ranges from 16.4% to 21.1%. The sensitivities of the EIRRs of the \ndrainage and flood protection components are tested against adverse changes in key variables. \nThe result of sensitivity analysis shows that the Project is most sensitive to delays in project \ncompletion. However, all EIRRs exceed 12%. The economic analysis is presented in Appendix \n13; details are available in Supplementary Appendix L.   \n \nC.  Financial Aspects \n63.  Financial analyses were conducted to determine the financial viability of the selected \ncomponents and the sustainability of the six URENCOs. In addition, a financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) is calculated for the solid waste management component in each town. For the \ndrainage and flood protection component, the Project aims to directly recover, via water tariff \nsurcharge, the full O&M cost, including the capital cost of the equipment for O&M purposes. \nAdditionally, an environmental fee or a surcharge on the land and house tax will be levied by \neach TPC or PPC to recover an appropriate portion of capital costs.8 In 2004, all project towns \nwill implement a 10% surcharge on the water bill, increase it to 20% in 2006, and increase it \nfurther to the level required for recovering the full O&M cost of the services in 2007.  \n \n64.  For solid waste management systems, the Project aims for full cost recovery.9 To \nachieve this target, all project towns will apply a differentiated user fee for domestic, commercial \nand institutional, and industrial users starting from 2007. All project towns will increase the \ncurrent solid waste user fee by 30% in 2004 and further 20% in 2006. The FIRRs calculated for \nthe solid waste component range from 7.2% to 10.6%, all above the estimated weighted \naverage cost of capital of 4.0% for the Project.  \n \n65.  Affordability  analyses  have  been  undertaken  to  ensure  that  the  service  users, \nparticularly the poor, can afford water surcharges for drainage and wastewater service and user \nfees for solid waste management. These fees were found affordable. The financial projections \nprepared for the six URENCOs  indicate that financial performance improves over the 2004\u2013\n2014 forecast period as drainage/wastewater tariffs are applied and solid waste tariff increases \nare implemented. The Government\u2019s budget support to the services will be gradually reduced \nand finally eliminated in year 2007. The financial analysis is presented in Appendix 14; details \nare available in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n                                                 \n8  Consulting services are provided during implementation to analyze the appropriate structure and level of the \nenvironmental fees. \n9  Landfill sites will be owned by the PPCs and, therefore, the capital cost related to the landfill site construction is not \nincluded in the financial analysis. This can be considered as a transparent subsidy of the government. ", "17 \nD.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n66.  The  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i)  limited  human  resources  and \ncapacities of TPCs, URENCOs, and women\u2019s unions; (ii) uncertainty regarding tariff increases \nnecessary to ensure sustainability of urban services; (iii) insufficient community participation in \nproject  implementation,  particularly  from  women  and  the  poor;  (iv) poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds negatively affected by resettlement; (v) delays caused by PMUs' lack of experience \nin managing ADB-funded projects; and (vi) lack of local government ownership of sanitation \nfacilities. \n \n67.  The Project incorporates measures to mitigate these risks. They include (i) institutional \nstrengthening for TPCs, URENCOs, and women\u2019s unions to increase their managerial and \noperational  capacities;  (ii)  a  detailed,  time-bound  tariff  increase  program  for  urban \nenvironmental services, affordable to all citizens and agreed to by PPCs;  (iii) a participation \nprogram  and  gender  action  plan  and  public  awareness  campaigns;  (iv)  a  resettlement \nframework and resettlement plans to ensure that affected people will maintain or even improve \ntheir living standards after project completion; (v) the PCU and consultants with experience in \nimplementing  ADB-assisted  projects  will  assist  PMUs  to  establish  effective  project \nmanagement, reporting, and bidding procedures; and (vi) local ownership, ensured through \nPPCs\u2019 commitment to tariff increases and allocating revenues for O&M. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n68.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and PPCs have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  undertake  the  actions  described  in  the  policy  and \ninstitutional action plan (Appendix 3) within the agreed time frame, and will \nadvise ADB of its progress through quarterly progress reports. \n \n(ii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  each  PPC  will  establish  a  CMC  to \noverview part A of the Project in each province. The PPC will ensure timely \ndisbursement of funds from the PMU to the town\u2019s women\u2019s union for activities \nunder part A. \n \n(iii)  Within 18 months of loan effectiveness, the women\u2019s union in each town\u2014under \nCMC  guidance,  and  in  consultation  with  the  PMUs,  local  authorities,  and \ncommunities\u2014will develop an HSP to provide grants to low-income and poor \nhouseholds with conditions and eligibility criteria acceptable to ADB, which will be   \nobserved during project implementation. \n \n(iv)  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the PPCs will introduce regulations on \nsanitation, requiring such measures as (a) connecting sullage drains and septic \ntanks to drains in high- and medium-density areas, and to drains or properly \ndesigned  and  constructed  soakaways  in  low-density  areas;  (b)  that  each \nhousehold or business located in high- and medium-density areas will have a \nseptic tank that meets prescribed standards; and (c) that hotels, restaurants, \nhospitals, and industrial enterprises will have on-site treatment facilities to treat \ntheir wastewater. \n ", "18 \n(v)  The  PPCs  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are  taken  in \naccordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  as  set  out  in  the  agreed  resettlement  plans  and \nframework. The policies and principles outlined in the resettlement frameworks \nand individual resettlement plans will apply for compensation and resettlement of \naffected  people.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Vietnamese  laws, \nregulations, and procedures and ADB\u2019s requirements and Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement, ADB policy will apply. \n \n(vi)  PMUs in each project province will ensure that IEEs will be made available in the \nlocal language on request at the town offices before the project begins. The \nPMUs will update the subproject IEEs and EMPs following completion of the \ndetailed designs and after further consultations with local communities.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a National Priority in Country    Sector identified as a National Priority in   \nPoverty Analysis?    Yes  Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?

The central region\u2019s urban population is 4.5 million and is growing 4.5% per \nannum. In 1999, the central region accounted for 20.6% of the national population. Development in the central region \nhas suffered and urban infrastructure is unable to meet the growing demand because of insufficient funds and weak \ninstitutional arrangements. Inadequate infrastructure systems pose serious environmental and health risks and inhibit \nsocial and economic development. This has fueled the rural to urban migration: the population of Hanoi and Ho Chi \nMinh City increased about 1.5 times in the past 10 years and accounts for 40% of Viet Nam\u2019s total urban population.  \n \nThe Project will reduce flooding and improve drainage, sanitation, and solid waste systems in five provincial capitals \nand one district level town in the central region. Demand-based community awareness and pro-poor sanitation (APPS) \nprograms will expand services to poor and low-income households and communities in remote and underserved \nareas. The Project will improve urban infrastructure systems and service coverage so that the five provincial capitals \ncan function as sustainable regional economic centers, and the district town will be better able to develop its tourism \npotential and serve the surrounding poor fishing community. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nThematic Areas: Human Development \n \nThe central region is one of the poorest in Viet Nam. The selected project towns experience levels of poverty where \nthe urban living standard is poorer than the national average. According to the Viet Nam Living Standard Survey \n(VLSS), the national urban poverty average is 11.1%. About 21.2% of the total beneficiaries from the Project are \nexpected to be poor. This percentage includes the total number of beneficiaries from the solid waste component in \nLang Co that live in the Chan May urban area, Phoc Loc district, and four communes of the Phoc Loc district. There \nare also some households that reside just above the poverty line, and are equally susceptible to shocks, poor \nsanitation, and floods, all of which weaken their human capital, especially their health. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  address  one  of  the  millennium  development  goals  and  targets  (MDGTs):  to  ensure \nenvironmental sustainability. This includes reducing the risk of disaster from floods, and further impoverishment from \npoor drainage, sanitation, and solid waste collection. The majority of the urban poor work in unstable and low-paid \njobs,  where  median  household  income  ranges  from  D400,000-800,000  per  month.  The  urban-poor  reside  in \nunderserved areas where drainage is dysfunctional or nonexistent, access to solid waste collection is limited, \nsanitation is inadequate, and the environment is polluted due to the lack of appropriate toilet and septic tank facilities. \nThey are up to 3.5 times as likely to experience flooding of their houses than nonpoor households, and are more \nvulnerable to shocks such as sickness due to poor sanitation or flooding. Environmental diseases have high economic \nand social consequences, including high medical expenses and lost working days that harm incomes and further \nmarginalize the poor. \n \nThe Project will reduce flooding and improve drainage, sanitation, and solid waste systems. Improvements made in \nenvironmental management further contribute to the achievement of other MDGTs. Improved sanitation and better \ndrainage reduces (i) illnesses and mortality amongst different population groups, and (ii) the associated economic and \nsocial costs. Community-based interventions will expand services to remote and underserved communities, including \nresettlement areas. Poor households will benefit from these improvements, as they cluster in areas that are low-lying \nand poorly serviced by solid waste collectors. Community awareness and participation programs will educate and \ninform beneficiaries so that they are active participants in their own development. Community-based sanitation \nprograms will strengthen community ownership and management of local environmental improvements, and the \nhousehold sanitation program will increase septic tank coverage amongst the poor and low-income. Poor and low-\nincome  households,  especially  those  engaging  in  the  community-based sanitation program, will make special \narrangements with urban environmental companies (URENCOs) to ensure affordable services.

Primary stakeholders include \nresidents  in  urban  wards,  resettlement-affected  people,  the  Women\u2019s  Unions,  URENCOs,  and  the  project \nmanagement unit. Secondary stakeholders include the town people\u2019s committees, mass organizations, ward people\u2019s \ncommittees, provincial people\u2019s committees, relevant line agencies, and the Ministry of Construction.   \n \nIndividual  subcomponents  for  each  project  town  were  identified  through  public  consultations,  workshops,  and \nmeetings involving extensive stakeholder participation. Decree No. 29/1998/ND-CP, reiterated in the CPRGS, calls for \nincreased citizen responsibilities through grassroots participation in utilizing and managing infrastructure projects. \nPeople are (i) given adequate information about development projects; and (ii) entitled to comment on and contribute \nto implementation, maintenance and operations, and express their role as the owners of subprojects. APPS will \ncontribute to this democratization by providing information, generating awareness, facilitating community participation \nand consultation with URENCOs, and encouraging local solutions through demand-driven sanitation improvements. \n \nDuring project design, community meetings were held with beneficiaries to discuss flooding, sanitation, poverty, \nresettlement, affordability issues, and environmental concerns. Consultations with communities and beneficiaries \nrevealed challenges, strategies, and solutions for project design and implementation. Socioeconomic surveys obtained \ninformation and individual views on current situations and future preferences. Similar surveys, including inventory of \nloss surveys, were conducted amongst resettlement-affected populations. Special consultations were also held with \npoor and vulnerable households, including female-headed households. Key stakeholder input and feedback in project \ndesign helped it evolve to its current state. \n \nA community participation strategy has been developed to take into account the different levels of cooperation and \ncollaboration of stakeholders. Levels of participation include information exchange, consultation, collaboration, review \nand comments on reports, and empowerment. Weekly meetings, workshops, reviews, consultation meetings, technical \nwork groups, and planning groups are the various forms of communications used to ensure active participation, project \nsupport, and productive feedback. Based on lessons learned, a community management committee in each Project \ntown will be formed to (i) coordinate APPS, (ii) enhance community ownership at the local level, and (iii) provide \nfinancial support for community and household sanitation improvements. The community management committee will \nhelp increase accountability and distribute responsibilities among the Women\u2019s Union, URENCO, and town people\u2019s \ncommittee in each project town. \n \n \nD.

Background \n1.  Females comprise about 50% of the population, and female-headed households (FHHs) account \nfor 29-40% of all households. In households where men are present but women serve as household \nheads, the women work longer hours and are more active in their communities than their partners. FHHs \nwithout male spouses account for about 8-14% of all households. The patriarchal system is strong, and \nwith it comes a distinct gendered division of labor. Men and women are responsible for different types of \nproductive work that define their social roles, while women are still responsible for domestic work, \nincluding a variety of tasks relating to sanitation. Poor women have little decision-making power, while \nwomen in middle-income families have a greater decision-making role and contribute more to household \nincome.  \n \n2.  The gendered division of labor within urban environmental companies (URENCOs) is clear. Men \nare given heavy work such as driving garbage trucks, dredging drains, working at landfills, and staffing \nthe funeral division. Women sweep roads, collect leaves, cut tree branches, or serve in administrative \nroles as accountants, cashiers, or secretaries. About 60 scavengers, mostly women, rely on collecting \nscrap from landfill sites to supplement household incomes of about D30,000 per household per day. \nScavengers must pay a fee of D1,000 per day to access the Thanh Hoa landfill site. \n \n3.  Although women are represented in large numbers in the Women\u2019s Unions, gender disparities in \nleadership and decision-making exist at all levels in project towns. There are no female leaders in the \ntown people\u2019s committees, and an estimated 1-2% of women are vice chairpeople of ward people\u2019s \ncommittees (Thanh Hoa and Dong Ha). More than half of URENCO staff is female (Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, \nand Dong Ha), but they  are inadequately represented at the management level. Women mainly head \nsanitation teams or groups. Women\u2019s Unions are often the coordinating agencies for sanitation programs, \nenvironmental health campaigns, and household credit  programs in provincial towns. \n \n4.  Widows,  divorced  women,  and  FHHs  are  more  likely  to  experience  adverse  affects  of \nresettlement because they lack access to legal property rights and ownership certificates. They are more \nvulnerable, at greater risk of marginalization, and require additional support in terms of cash, labor, and \ntechnical advice. The summary gender action plan (Table A5.1) outlines how the Project will address the \ngender needs of workers and affected communities, with a particular focus on women.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n5.  The gender action plan (GAP) is infused across all project components. The Project will build \nupon ongoing lessons learned from ADB\u2019s Second Provincial Town Water Supply and Sanitation Project10 \nand  similar  projects  funded  by  other  development  partners.  PMUs  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation. A focal person will coordinate social-inclusive and gender-sensitive activities for each \ncomponent. In project towns, CMCs will be responsible for managing the APPS component, and town-\nlevel Women\u2019s Unions will be responsible for daily implementation. Women\u2019s Unions have the capacity \nand local knowledge to implement Part A. The Women\u2019s Union has extensive experience implementing \nsanitation and environmental health awareness campaigns, as well as donor-supported sanitation credit  \nprograms. Involvement and financial independence of Women\u2019s Unions will increase female participation \nduring project design, implementation, monitoring, operation, and maintenance. Coordinating with other \nCMC members is essential to maintaining financial objectivity and sustaining a strong community-based \ncomponent. URENCO will comply with the International Labor Organization\u2019s core labor standards,11 as \nwell as national laws on labor protection, safety, equal pay, and gender-sensitive equipment.  \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1997.

Training materials and leaflets will reflect the distinct needs of men and \nwomen.  Access  to  information  regarding  project  components  and  tariffs  will  be \navailable to both men and women. Education regarding occupational health risks for \nURENCO workers will include not only technical staff but also nontechnical staff and \nlandfill scavengers, who are predominantly women.  \nMotivators will be trained and mass organizations mobilized. About 50% of motivators \nwill be women. \nMen and women will be consulted to provide local input on subcomponents prior to \nfinalizing the details of larger subcomponents (e.g. open drains vs. covered ones, \ndesign of handcarts).  \nA.2.   The  Women\u2019s  Union,  with  other  members  of  the  CMC,  will  evaluate  proposals \nCommunity-Based  submitted  by  communities  for  community-based  improvements.  Proposals  will  be \nSanitation  reviewed  within  a  gender-sensitive  framework  (e.g.  toilets  constructed  shall  be \nappropriate for both men and women). About 30% of community/neighborhood group \nmembers are women.  \nCommunities will determine their own contribution to the project through a participatory \nprocess during proposal preparations. Exemption consideration will be given to FHHs \nwho cannot afford to contribute in cash, labor, or kind. \nThrough  participatory  consultation  with  both  men  and  women,  communities  will \ndetermine operation and maintenance (O&M) activities, including tariffs for repairs or \nsalaries for maintenance personnel.  \nPreference will be given to women for employment generated by the subcomponent. \nA.3.

Design and development of resettlement plans \nwill  include  consultations  with  both  women  and  men  about  their  needs.  Social \ninfrastructure in resettlement areas will reflect gender needs, and women\u2014especially \nsole FHHs\u2014will be eligible for comparable compensation for lost assets. \nURENCO, with the support of a gender consultant, will conduct training on leadership \nand management skills for female staff. Preference to qualified women candidates will \nbe given for management positions. \n   \n \n6.  Institutional Capacity.  Gender capacity building will be provided to PMU staff. Training \non specific project subcomponents will be required for Women\u2019s Union staff, while skills training \non  specific  gender  issues  in  health,  environment,  and  sanitation  will  strengthen  existing \ncapacity. An international gender advisor (2 person-months) and a domestic gender specialist \n(18 person-months) will help refine the GAP and train ministry representatives, implementing \nagencies, and other government officials. Specific responsibilities for achieving GAP goals are \nincluded in the terms of reference. \n \n7.   Budgets and Financing Plan.  The budget for GAP activities will be included in the \nproject  cost.  Cost  for  involving  Women\u2019s  Union  staff  in  gender  training,  participatory \nconsultation, community development, and other activities should be budgeted adequately. \nOther budget items include costs for the gender specialists, participant per diems, materials, \nvenue rental, and refreshments. \n \n8.   Implementation Schedule.  The implementation schedule for the GAP will follow the \noverall project implementation schedule, as well as the specific schedules of subcomponents.   \n \n9.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  The  overall  project  performance  monitoring  system \ndeveloped for the Project incorporates M&E for the GAP based on gender-sensitive indicators. \nAttention will be given to involving women beneficiaries in designing, implementing, monitoring, \nand O&M, using both qualitative and quantitative indicators to measure participation.

Introduction \n \n1.  A resettlement plan for each Project town has been prepared based on an inventory of \nloss (IOL) survey, census, socioeconomic survey, and group discussions with affected people. \nThe level of impact of the main infrastructure components on land acquisition and resettlement \nhas been estimated, until detailed designs are completed during implementation. A resettlement \nframework has been prepared to cover impacts missed during project design and to include \nimpacts due to community-based sanitation (CBS) in Part A. For the resettlement framework \nand individual resettlement plans, see Supplementary Appendix O. \n    \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  An estimated total of 138 hectares will be lost because of improvements in drainage, \nflood protection, wastewater, sanitation, and solid waste infrastructure. Approximately 1,100 \nhouseholds,  including  shops  and  incomes,  will  be  severely  affected,12  and  1,237  will  be \nmarginally affected. Involuntary resettlement is most severe in or near landfill areas, wastewater \ntreatment plants, and regulating lakes. See Table A6.1. \n   \n3.  The level of impact for drainage and sewerage pipes will be determined when detailed \ndesigns are completed during implementation. The CBS component may require minor land \nacquisition for building drains, footpaths, and solid waste collection units. Community proposals \nwill  be  evaluated  at  the  time  of  submission.  The  resettlement  framework  will  guide  any \nunforeseen  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  planning  during  project  implementation. \nResettlement plan for each proposal will be prepared or revised for the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) approval as needed.  \n \nTable A6.1: Assessment of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \nProject Town  Permanent  No. of  No. of  Total Impact \nLand  Severely  Marginally \nAcquisition  Affected  Affected HHs  No.  No. \n(ha)  HHs  Affected  Affected \nHHs  People \nThanh Hoa  28.43  237  97  334  1,470 \nHa Tinh  32.96  209  508  717  2,796 \nDong Ha  10.35  71  235  306  1,499 \nLang Co  19.79  184  146  330  1,782 \nTam Ky  22.09  259  105  364  1,565 \nQuang Ngai  24.43  140  146  286  1,459 \nTotal  138.05  1,100  1,237  2,337  10,571 \n  Ha = hectares, no = number, HHs = households. \nSource: Inventories of Loss and Socioeconomic Surveys for each project town (2003). \n   \nC.  Legal Framework and Principles \n \n4.  The  legal  framework  governing  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  framework  and \nresettlement plans is primarily based on (i) the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s 1993 Land Law (14 July \n1993, amended 2 December 1998), and Decree No. 22/1998/ND-CP (24 April 1998); (ii) ADB\u2019s Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice \n                                                 \n12  Severely affected people for this Project have been defined as (i) those who will physically be displaced and or will \nlose more than 50% of their main residential or commercial structure, and/or  (ii) those losing more than 20% of \ntheir productive income-generating assets (agricultural landholdings or income sources). ", "36  Appendix 6 \n(1998); and (iii) a number of other government laws, regulations, and decrees relevant to land \nacquisition.13 This Project will be bound by the principles and conditions stated in the resettlement \nframework and resettlement plans for each project town, approved by ADB and the Provincial \nPeople\u2019s Committees (PPCs). The policies and principles adopted for the Project will supersede the \nprovisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever a gap exists between ADB\u2019s \npolicy and Vietnamese law. \n \n5.  The 1993 Land Law is a comprehensive land administration law; it gives people access \nto  land  through  land-user  rights  similar  to  private  ownership.  Decree  No.  22  regulates \ncompensation for land recovered by the Government for defense, security, national, and public \ninterests.  The  basic  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  include: \n(i) resettlement  shall  be  avoided  or  minimized  whenever  possible;  (ii)  when  unavoidable, \naffected people are entitled to compensation for their affected properties, relocation assistance, \nand rehabilitation measures to ensure that affected people will at least be as well-off as they \nwould have been in the absence of the project; and (iii) affected people should be fully informed \nand consulted in preparing resettlement plans. See Table A6.2. \n \nC.  Compensation and Entitlements \n6.  The principles and objectives ensure that all affected people are compensated in such a \nway that they improve, or at least maintain, their pre-project living standards and earning \ncapacity.  Affected  people  identified  through  the  IOLs  are  entitled  to  compensation  or \nrehabilitation, whether or not they have formal legal land title. Those who encroach on the \nproposed area after the cutoff date (or completion of IOLs) are not entitled to compensation or \nrehabilitation. \n \n7.  All  affected  people  are  entitled  to  compensation  for  lost  assets,  incomes,  and \nbusinesses at full replacement cost and current market value, free from taxes, registration, and \nland transfer. Those eligible are given relocation and rehabilitation allowances so they can \nimprove or at least maintain pre-project living standards, incomes, and productive capacity. \nCompensation for those who depend on agriculture will include land wherever possible.  \n \nD.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation \n8.  Thanh Hoa. The Thanh Hoa subproject will require 12.86 hectares of rice fields for a \nlandfill and another 2.96 hectares for an access road. The landfill and access road will cause \napproximately 129 households to lose rice fields. The wastewater treatment plant site has been \nselected to avoid the need for relocation, but the required 11 hectares are rice fields and low-\nlying land used for fishing. Use of this land will severely affect an estimated 99 households. \n \n9.  Ha Tinh. Close to 209 households will be severely affected by acquisition of land for the \nBong Son regulating basin (18 hectares), Cut River canal upgrading and riverbank protection (8.26 \nhectares), and landfill (5 hectares). Some 65 households will lose structures and residential land \nalong the Cut River, and 22 households will be relocated. Options to minimize relocation have been \ninvestigated, including the possibility of re-establishing houses immediately behind their present \nlocations. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13  Others include: Decree No. 87/CP (17 August 1993), Decree No. 60/CP (5 July 1994), Decree No. 45/CP (3 \nAugust 1996), Decree No. 64/CP (15 September 1996), Decree No. 89/CP (17 August 1994), Decree 91/CP \n(1994), Decree No. 17/CP (4 May 2001), Circular No. 05-BXD/DT (9 February 1993), and Constitution of Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam (15 April 1992).

Plans  should  be  prepared  Socioeconomic surveys for 25% of affected people and IOL surveys of 100% of \nfor  compensation,  affected people were conducted. Affected people were identified, and their \nresettlement  and  land, buildings, and other assets have been enumerated. A resettlement plan \nrehabilitation  of  affected  for  each  project  town  has  been  prepared  and  will  be  revised  after  the \npeople.  completion of detailed civil works designs, and detailed measurement surveys \n(DMS). \n3.  Community  participation  is  During the IOL surveys, meetings were held at the province, town, ward, and \nassured.  Affected  people  commune levels, as well as with officials, residents, and affected people, to \nshould be fully informed and  inform  them  of  the  Project.

Further  community  participation  and  consultation  will  be \ncompensation options.  conducted through resettlement committees during and following completion of \nthe DMS, and prior to implementation of the resettlement plans. Affected people \nwill receive information about the project and entitlements prior to finalizing the \nresettlement  plan  for  each  project  town.  The  PPC  will  conduct  a  public \ninformation  campaign,  and  stakeholders  will  receive  a  project  information \nbooklet outlining resettlement principles, procedures, compensation options, \nentitlements of affected people, implementing organizations, public consultation \nmechanisms, and grievance procedures.  \n4.  Affected people will receive  All affected people who have been identified in the project-impacted areas as of \nfair  compensation  for  all  the date of the census and IOL survey are entitled to compensation, relocation \nlosses, including assets and  allowances, and rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or \nlivelihoods.  at  least  maintain  their  pre-project  living  standards,  earning capacity, and \nproduction levels.  \n5.

Locations are being altered \nintegral  part  of  subproject  to  minimize  impacts  on  people  (land  acquisition  and  resettlement)  and \ndesign.  subproject  schedules  take  into  account  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nschedules. Approval to award civil works contracts will not be given until the \nrequired lands have been fully acquired, and compensation and resettlement \nactivities are satisfactorily completed. \n6.  Special  measures  will  be  Vulnerable households such as FHHs, disabled, children, and elderly people \nincluded in the resettlement  without support structures and people living in poverty will be given additional \nplan to protect socially and  assistance, as required, during relocation and transition periods.

Lang Co. The Lang Co subproject will acquire 5 hectares of land for the wastewater \ntreatment plant site and 9 households will be relocated. One of four wastewater-pumping \nstations is unavoidably located in an urban area and construction requires temporary relocation \nof 24 small traders. Construction of the landfill will relocate 1 household and severely affect 84 \nhouseholds in the area (14 hectares).  \n \n11.  Tam Ky. The Tam Ky subproject\u2019s most significant resettlement impact is from the 2.8-\nkilometer dike road for flood protection, requiring acquisition of 2 hectares of densely populated ", "38  Appendix 6 \nresidential  land  and  relocation  of  an  estimated  75  households  and  12  shops/businesses. \nPreliminary consultation with these households indicates that they fully support the Project and \nprefer to move out of this polluted and annually flooded area. Detailed consultation has been \ncarried out during the preparation of the resettlement plan though IOLs, socioeconomic surveys, \nand group discussions. The proposed diversion canal and flood-regulating basins will require \nacquisition of 19.75 hectares of rice and cropland. Four households will be relocated and some \n152 households will be severely affected by land loss. \n \n12.  Quang Ngai. The Quang Ngai subproject involves restoring and upgrading an ancient \nmoat in the citadel area. Proposed maintenance access roads around the moat will necessitate \nrelocating an estimated 21 households, 16 of which have shops. The landfill will require 11 \nhectares of marginal agricultural land and the relocation of 5 households. Flood alleviation and \ndrainage works will acquire 5 hectares of agricultural land, causing relocation of 2 households \nand severely affecting the income of 102 households. \n \nE.  Vulnerable Groups \n13.  Ethnic minority groups were not found in the Project surveys. Female-headed households \n(FHHs), with or without a male spouse present, are vulnerable to further marginalization because \nthey lack access to legal property rights or ownership certificates. Widows and divorced women are \nmore likely to experience adverse affects of resettlement. Additional support for the poor, vulnerable \ngroups, and FHHs in terms of cash, labor, and technical advice is advised. \n \nF.  Institutional Arrangements \n14.  The PPC for each project town is responsible for approving its resettlement plan, as well \nas the overall resettlement framework. A project coordination unit (PCU) will be responsible for \noverall coordination of resettlement reports to the ADB. The project steering committee (PSC) \nunder the PPC will ensure coordination of provincial agencies involved in  resettlement, and \nassist the PPC in approving compensation rates and the resettlement budget. The project \nmanagement unit (PMU) in each Project town will supervise day-to-day implementation of all \nresettlement-related activities, including consultation, detailed measurement surveys, updating \nresettlement plans, and coordinating civil works. A town/district resettlement committee/division \nwill work closely with the PMU on resettlement activities and will help make decisions on related \nissues. Local administrative authorities will assist the PMU in the planning and implementing \nresettlement-related activities Local mass organizations will mobilize affected people to actively \nparticipate  in  resettlement  and  assist  in  distributing  information.  International  and  local \nresettlement experts will work closely with the PMUs, and affected communities, and provide \ncapacity building, training, and guide quality of resettlement processes and documentation. \n \nG.  Consultation and Grievance Redress \n15.  Affected people will be apprised of their rights to lodge grievances and shown the \nprocedures  by  doing  so  verbally  and  in  writing  during  consultation,  survey,  and  time  of \ncompensation. They may present their complaints to the concerned local administrative officials \nand/or the resettlement committees. Complaint will be filed first at the ward/commune level and \nwill be elevated to the highest or provincial level if affected people are not satisfied. Local \nadministrative authorities and resettlement committees at each level will settle the complaint \nwithin 15 days. Affected people will be exempted from all taxes, administrative, and legal fees.  \n \nH.  Budget and Implementation Schedule \n16.  The project\u2019s estimated resettlement cost is US$7.7 million. Adequate budgetary support \nwill be committed and made available to cover land acquisition and resettlement within the \nagreed implementation period. Resettlement plans will include breakdowns for each type of \nloss, with corresponding cost estimates reflecting replacement at current market values. Costs \nfor developing resettlement sites and support costs for implementation will also be included. The \ncost estimates will make adequate provision for contingencies. The resettlement plans will also \ninclude the detailed schedule and procedures related to flow of resettlement funds. ", "  Appendix 6  39 \n \n17.  Resettlement plans for each project town will include detailed implementation schedules \ncoordinated with the civil works schedule  for the subproject. Approval to award civil works \ncontracts will not be given until the required lands have been fully acquired, affected people are \nappropriately compensated and relocated, and income restoration measures are in place in \naccordance with the principles above. \n \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n18.  PMUs are responsible for monitoring resettlement. PMUs will supervise land acquisition \nand resettlement and prepare quarterly reports to the PCU, which then reports to ADB. PMUs \nwill ensure that progress reports from consultants supervising construction include status of \nresettlement  plans;  information  on  location  and  numbers  of  people  affected;  itemized \ncompensation amounts; as well as relocation paid, grievances by, and assistance to affected \npeople. For external monitoring and post-evaluation, the PCU (with approval from ADB, as to \nterms  of  reference,  qualifications,  and  experience)  will  recruit,  for  the  entire  Project,  an \nindependent external monitoring organization for independent biannual review of resettlement. \nThe agency will review achievement and compensation, and then make recommendations. \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam,  assisted  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nprepared a summary initial environmental examination (IEE) report for the Central Region Urban \nEnvironmental  Improvement  Project  and  an  IEE  for  each  of  six  project  towns  (see \nSupplementary Appendix G). This report was prepared based on the six IEEs, field visits, \ninvestigation, and discussions with staff of project management units (PMUs), and government \nagencies including the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE) and the Ministry \nof Construction (MOC). This summary IEE was prepared according to ADB\u2019s guidelines and \nrequirements. ADB classified the Project under environmental category B. \n \n2.  The Project will improve drainage, sanitation, and solid waste management system in \nfive provincial capitals and one district-level town in central Viet Nam where inadequate urban \ninfrastructure poses serious environmental and health risks, inhibiting social and economic \ndevelopment. The project\u2019s main objective will be to provide improved environmental conditions \nand urban services in six project towns. \n \n3.  The  IEEs  follow  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment  guidelines  and  government \nrequirements.  The  IEE\u2019s  objective  is  to  identify  potential  impacts,  evaluate their severity, \nrecommend mitigation measures, and propose a monitoring plan for use during implementation. \n \n4.  PMUs in all provinces will update IEEs and environmental management plans (EMPs) \nfor subprojects after detailed designs are complete, and will submit them to ADB and DNRE for \nreview and approval. Government regulations require separate updated IEEs and EMPs for five \nproposed landfills (all except Quang Nam) and the wastewater treatment facility in Thanh Hoa. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n   \n5.  Long-term  project  goals  are  to  improve  quality  of  life  and  promote  economic \ndevelopment in the six project towns: Dong Ha, Ha Tinh, Lang Co, Quang Ngai, Tam Ky and \nThanh Hoa. Specific project objectives are to (i) improve urban environmental conditions, and \n(ii)  improve  sustainability  of  the  urban  environmental  companies  (URENCOs)  and  urban \nservices. \n \n6.  The  Project  will  include  three  major  physical  components:  (i)  drainage  and  flood \nprotection, (ii) wastewater and public sanitation, and (iii) solid waste disposal. The drainage \ncomponent will cover rehabilitating and cleaning 55 kilometers (km) of existing drains, building \n52 km of primary canals and culverts, building 166 km of primary and secondary drains, and \n110 km of tertiary drains. New wastewater treatment systems in Thanh Hoa (13,500 cubic \nmeters (m3)/day) and Lang Co (4,750 m3/day) will cover collection, treatment, and disposal of \nwastewater for these two cities. Solid waste disposal covers the collection, transport, and \ndisposal of municipal solid waste from the urban areas and selected communes in the provincial \ntowns. The total project cost is estimated at $96.0 million equivalent.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n7.  All six towns are located along National Highway 1,160-1,020 km south of Hanoi on \ncentral Viet Nam\u2019s flat coastal plain. The climate in all towns is similar: temperature varies only ", "  Appendix 7  41 \nslightly, although rainfall varies from a maximum annual average of about 3,400 mm in Lang Co \nto 1,750 mm in Thanh Hoa.  \n \n8.  The  five  provincial  towns  are  all  on  near-flat  terrain,  located  5-15 km inland, and \nadjacent to major rivers, most of them tidal. The river floodplains are underlain by recent alluvial \nsoils, whereas the towns generally sit on top of older alluvial soils. Dong Ha, by contrast, was \nbuilt on clay residual soil. Lang Co\u2019s project area is a long, narrow sand peninsula, its southern \nhalf between the Lap An Lagoon and the East Sea. Groundwater is the main water supply for \nQuang Ngai, and to some extent for Dong Ha. The other towns use surface water. \n \n9.  Surface  water  quality  will  be  most  affected  by  the  proposed  works.  Water  quality \ninformation and a limited program of field sampling and laboratory analysis were completed in \nApril 2003 specifically for the IEE. The results of these investigations are presented in each IEE. \nThe data confirms that many drains and receiving rivers are polluted. These investigations \nrepresent typical dry season conditions, where significant dilution and flushing is rare. \n \n10.  There are no known endangered flora or fauna in project areas. Most affected land has \nalready been developed. Several sites of archeological or historical significance have been \nidentified, and care will be taken to avoid affecting them during proposed works. Additional \ninvestigations during detailed design will ensure protection of historic sites. \n \n11.  The five provincial towns have populations ranging from 57,000 at Ha Tinh to 186,000 at \nThanh Hoa. Lang Co, a district-level town, has a population of 11,000, but numbers are \nexpected to grow substantially as tourism develops. The economies in provincial towns are \nbased on services to surrounding rural regions. The main sources of jobs are provincial and \ndistrict governments, market trade, and light industry such as furniture making, handicrafts, and \nfood processing. Major industry is limited, although Quang Ngai is near an industrial zone \nassociated with the Dung Quat oil refinery. In most communes, income comes from agriculture. \nLang Co\u2019s economy is based mainly on fishing, with tourism expected to dominate in future. \n \nD.   Screening of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n12.  In general, the Project proposes significant improvements to quality of life by upgrading \ninfrastructure for drains, flood control, sewerage, solid waste collection, and disposal. The \nproposed works will also provide significant benefits to the physical and ecological environment. \nThe Project may cause negative environmental impacts, but those are likely to be short-lived, \nminor, and limited by (i) carefully selecting project sites, (ii) seriously implementing proposed \nmitigation measures identified under the IEEs, (iii) regularly monitoring implementation of the \nEMP, and (iv) appropriate capacity building at the URENCOs. A summary of potential impacts \nand proposed mitigation measures is provided below. A detailed description of impacts is given \nin the EMP and the IEEs in Supplementary Appendixes F and G, respectively.  \n \n1.  Location of Project Activities \n \n13.  Existing facilities, natural features, and topography dictate sites for drains and flood \nmitigation infrastructure. Drain improvements focus on the inner urban wards, whereas the solid \nwaste  improvements  extend  to  the  communes.  Land  acquisition  for  drain  improvements \ninvolves about 60 hectares (ha) in total, with most affected area Ha Tinh, which severely affects \n206 households. Resettlement of 67 and 87 households, respectively, will also be necessary at \nDong Ha and Tam Ky for new dikes and associated roads. Many others will be affected in those \ntwo towns. Compensation will be provided according to the resettlement plans.  ", "42  Appendix 7 \n \n14.  Proposed wastewater treatment plants at Thanh Hoa and Lang Co will be remote from \nurban areas and will occupy about 12 ha and 6 ha respectively of marginal rice paddy fields and \nforest. The need for resettlement is quite minimal, although a number of fishermen near Lap An \nLagoon in Lang Co may need to be compensated. \n \n15.  Landfill sites at Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, Dong Ha, and Quang Ngai have been selected \nadjacent to existing facilities. These sites were generally selected for their geological suitability, \nbut continuing to collect leachate from existing facilities after closure will be  part of the new \noperations. In these towns, additional land has been acquired and only minor resettlement is \nrequired. The new landfill at Lang Co will require the acquisition of marginal agricultural land. \nAccess roads leading to landfills at all towns except Tam Ky will be upgraded under the Project. \nRoad alignments will generally follow existing tracks or master plan routes and will involve little \nland acquisition or resettlement. In most towns, roads will improve access to rural communities. \n \n2.  Design Aspects \n \n16.  Drain components are designed to reduce flooding, remove storm- and wastewater from \ntowns, and discharge it in rivers, improving the environment and health conditions in each town. \nThese works will not eliminate flooding but will significantly reduce severity and duration.   \n \n17.  In Thanh Hoa and Lang Co, wastewater treatment facilities will improve surface water \nand groundwater quality. Treatment facilities will be designed to meet  Vietnamese standards \nrecommended by the MNRE, and operations will be monitored to optimize performance and \nminimize risk to receiving water quality. Sludge will need to be carefully managed to ensure \nsatisfactory performance. Guidance on this aspect is provided in the attached EMP.  \n \n18.  In general, connecting industries to public sewers is sensible, reducing the number of \ndischarge points and thus the complexity and cost of monitoring and enforcement. Absolutely \ncritical to success, however, is formulating an industrial pretreatment program, including specific \nlimits hazardous and toxic substances and other pollutants, as well as monitoring procedures \nand enforcement capability. \n \n19.  New landfills will include base liners, leachate drainage, and collection and treatment \nsystems in accordance with Vietnamese standards. This, together with the natural clay soil \nbeneath most landfill sites, will minimize the risk of any significant impact to the underlying \ngroundwater or downstream surface water resources. An integral part of landfill design is the \nclosure of existing landfills with clay capping, as well as improved leachate collection and \ntreatment at the new adjacent facility. The net effect will be positive for the environment. A \nmonitoring system needs to be established to measure effectiveness of mitigation.   \n \n3.  Construction Activities \n \n20.  Much of the existing drain network planned for upgrading is located in densely populated \nurban areas. The excavation work involved in removing mud and sludge from existing drains \nand retention basins, natural ground from new pipeline routes, and the temporary storage of this \nmaterial alongside the trenches, will result in some inconvenience to adjacent residents. Issues \nof traffic, noise, odor and localized machinery vibration have been identified. The construction of \ndikes  and  roads  will  also  involve  moving  earth,  with  the  potential  for  noise,  dust,  traffic \ncongestion, erosion, and sediment contamination of waterways.   \n ", "  Appendix 7  43 \n21.  Proposed  EMPs  under  the  IEEs  include  detailed  mitigation  measures  such  as \nrequirements  for  prompt  removal  of  odorous  spoil  from  densely  populated  areas  and \nappropriate disposal.  The EMP also recommends restricted working hours and monitoring \nnoise, dust, and vibration so that work practices can be modified accordingly. \n \n22.  Landfill construction will entail some noise and dust, but far from residential areas and \nwith little negative impact expected. During the closure of old landfills, occupational health and \nsafety measures will be needed to protect workers from contact with leachate and landfill gas. \n \n4.  Operation Activities \n \n23.  Capacity building at URENCOs will result in a regular maintenance program for drains \nso  they  do  not  deteriorate  to  their  present  extent.  This  will  also  significantly  improve \noccupational health and safety during maintenance.  \n \n24.  At the wastewater treatment works, sludge will be collected periodically then dried and \nmatured for several months prior to disposal. Screenings from plant operations will also be \ncollected for disposal either onsite or at the landfill. Public sanitary facilities will have a positive \nimpact. Proposed waste stabilization ponds are potentially odorous if not operated effectively. \nProcedures  for  operating  and  monitoring  pond  biochemistry  will  be  carried  out  to  ensure \nminimum odor. Discharge of plant effluent also will be monitored to ensure compliance with \nVietnamese standards. \n \n25.  Improved waste storage facilities in communities, together with the proposed education \nprogram, will reduce waste dumped in drains and other low-lying areas. Landfill operation \ninvolves  some  hazardous  activities.  The  operator  will  be  required  to  follow  operational \nprocedures identified under the IEE to ensure the design contains environmental protection \nmeasures. Occupational health and safety measures will be included to ensure a safe working \nenvironment for employees and scavengers. \n \nE.   Institutional Requirements and Monitoring Program \n \n26.  Each provincial people\u2019s committee will be the executing agency in its province. Each \nexecuting agency will set up a provincial steering committee (PSC) and a project management \nunit (PMU). A project advisory council may be convened on an ad-hoc basis to review progress \nand resolve any problems arising during implementation. For overall project coordination, a \nproject coordination unit (PCU) will be established in the MOC. The main functions of the PCU \nare to undertake coordination, consolidated project accounting, auditing and monitoring, and \nreporting to the MOC, ADB, and other government agencies concerned. \n \n27.  To ensure that ADB environmental requirements and all applicable environmental laws, \nregulations, and standards are met during design, construction, and operation, an EMP for each \nof six project towns has been prepared and will be carried out by the PSC/PMU at the provincial \nlevel,  in  collaboration  with  the  departments  of  natural  resources  and  environment  (DNRE) \nconcerned. An integral part of the EMP will be environmental monitoring implemented by a \ndesignated environmental laboratory. PSC/PMU assured that the mitigation measures identified \nin  the  IEE  will  be  incorporated  into  design,  construction,  and  operation.  Environmental \nmeasures needing action from contractors will be incorporated in civil works contracts.  \n ", "44  Appendix 7 \n28.  PMUs, with the support of DNREs concerned, will monitor implementation of proposed \nenvironmental mitigation measures. Results will be reported to the PCU, MOC, MNRE, and \nADB through semiannual reports on project implementation and environmental monitoring. \n \n29.  At least one environment specialist will be on staff at each PMU because the PSC/PMU \nlacks the professional capabilities to monitor IEE implementation. An environmental capacity-\nbuilding component to the PCU and PMUs needs to be included under the Project so that those \ndirectly responsible for implementation and monitoring the EMP can fulfill their responsibilities.    \n \nF.   Findings and Recommendations \n \n30.  The various activities involved in the design, construction, and operation of the upgraded \ndrainage, flood protection, sanitation, wastewater treatment, and solid waste infrastructure will \nhave a significant positive impact on quality of life and the physical environment in all six towns. \n  \n31.  Potential  adverse  impacts  have  been  identified,  such  as  those  associated  with \nconstruction. Other negative effects are associated with infrastructure operation. However, \npotential adverse impacts arising from the design, construction, and operation of proposed \nproject activities will be temporary, minor, localized, and can be minimized to acceptable levels \nthrough mitigation measures and monitoring programs identified under the IEEs. Resettlement \nissues have been recognized and will be specifically addressed in the resettlement plans. \n \n32.  All six PMUs will prepare and submit updated subproject IEEs and EMPs for review and \napproval by ADB and DNRE following completion of detailed designs. In accordance with \ngovernment legislation, separate updated IEEs and EMPs for each landfill and the Thanh Hoa \nwastewater treatment facility will be required at the detailed design stage. These will more fully \nevaluate the potential negative impacts of these facilities and further develop/update appropriate \nmitigation measures and monitoring. ADB and the DNREs concerned must approve the final \nIEE for each landfill and the wastewater treatment facility before construction can begin.    \n \n33.  To minimize the potential harm to the Lap An Lagoon and achieve sustainable tourism in \nLang Co, at least two alternatives for disposal of effluent from the wastewater treatment plant \nneed to be studied during design. One option could be to reuse treated wastewater to irrigate a \nplanned golf course. \n \nG.   Conclusion \n \n34.  The conclusion of this summary IEE, based on the IEEs for six project towns, was that \nthe Project is unlikely to result in serious negative environmental impact. This is because (i) \nproposed project activities are designed to improve quality of life and physical environment, and \nadverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  design,  construction,  and  operation  will  be \ntemporary, minor, localized, and can be mitigated to acceptable levels; (ii) no project activities \nwill be located close to or within environmentally sensitive areas; (iii) each project town has \nprepared an IEE, including an EMP, which will be reviewed and endorsed by the environmental \nauthorities concerned; (iv) all construction activities be regularly monitored by the PMU and the \nDNRE; and (v) water quality monitoring be carried out for all sewage treatment plants and the \nlandfill works by a designated, provincial-level environmental laboratory.  \n \n35.  According to the above assessment and ADB\u2019s requirements, a detailed environmental \nimpact assessment is not warranted.    \n ", "  Appendix 8  45 \n \nESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS \n($ \u2018000) \n \nComponent  All  Thanh  Ha Tinh  Dong Ha  Lang Co  Tam Ky  Quang \nTowns  Hoa  Nai \nA.

The objectives of consulting services are to (i) assist provincial people\u2019s committees \n(PPCs), the project coordination unit (PCU), provincial project management units (PMUs), and \ncommunity management committees (CMCs) with implementation; (ii) strengthen the capacities \nof agencies involved in implementation by providing technical and managerial support and \ntraining; (iii) assist the urban environmental companies (URENCOs) and urban management \ndivisions  of  town  people\u2019s  committees  (TPCs)  to  manage  sustainable  urban  services  by \nstrengthening their management capacities; and (iv) improve the sustainability of urban services \nmanagement at the national level by assisting the Ministry of Construction\u2019s (MOC) department \nof urban infrastructure to prepare key urban management and tariff guidelines. \n \nB.  Scope of Services \n \n2.  Consulting  services  will  consist  of  two  types  of  activities:  project  implementation \nassistance (PIA) and institutional strengthening programs (ISP). PIA will include consulting \nservices  for  (i)  project  management  support,  design,  and  construction  supervision  of \ninfrastructure  works;  and  (ii)  technical  and  management  support  to  PMUs  and  the  PCU. \nTechnical and management support includes (i) helping set up project accounts; (ii) helping \nprepare project administration procedures, manuals, and software; (iii) delivering training to the \nPCU and PMUs for project implementation; (iv) providing familiarization with ADB procedures \nfor provincial agencies and other stakeholders; and (v) assisting PMUs to update and implement \nproject resettlement plans, environmental plans, and gender plans.  \n \n3.  The ISP will include three subprograms: \n \n4.  ISP for URENCOs. This component includes institutional strengthening to improve the \nefficiency, autonomy, and long-term sustainability of URENCOs in the project towns, including \n(i)  on-the-job and formal training in urban services management, financial management, asset \nmanagement,  and  customer  relations;  (b)  helping  URENCOs  to calculate, introduce, and \nmaintain tariffs for drainage, wastewater, and solid waste services; (c) helping URENCOs \nrestructure, set up, and maintain separate accounts in their main functional areas of drainage, \nwastewater, solid waste, new construction, and other urban services activities; and (d) helping \nURENCOs set up and maintain a computerized septic tank database and drawing records \nsystem of existing and new infrastructure facilities. This subprogram will also improve the \nfinancial  sustainability  of  urban  management  at  the  national  level  by  assisting  MOC\u2019s \ndepartment  of  urban  infrastructure  to  develop  national  guidelines  on  tariffs  for  drainage, \nwastewater, and solid waste services. \n \n5.  ISP  for  Awareness  and  Pro-Poor  Sanitation  (APPS).  This  component  includes \ninstitutional strengthening to assist CMCs and town-level Women\u2019s Unions to successfully plan, \nmanage, implement, and monitor the APPS, including (i) on-the-job and formal training in \ncommunity awareness and participation programs, community-based sanitation, and household \nsanitation program; (ii) helping prepare standard reporting formats and record systems for \nAPPS; (iii) helping develop materials and programs for public health awareness; (iv) helping \nformulate procedures and implementation arrangements for the community-based sanitation \nprogram, and; (e) helping establish the household sanitation program, including procedures for \nmanaging and monitoring the  program. \n \n6.

This subprogram will also improve the sustainability of urban management at the \nnational level by (i) supporting national and regional workshops to discuss lessons learned from \nthe project, (ii) identifying key issues and raising awareness of urban management, and (iii) \nproviding  assistance  to  MOC\u2019s  department  of  urban  infrastructure  in  developing  national \nguidelines for urban management in provincial towns, and guidelines for drainage sanitation and \nsolid waste tariffs. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n7.  The project is scheduled for implementation over 5.5 years, and will require a total of \n1,220 person months of consulting services (116 of international and 1,104 of domestic). \nConsulting services will be provided in one package through an international consulting firm in \nassociation with a domestic consulting firm. The consultant will be responsible for overall \nmanagement  of  the  consulting  services,  including  quality  assurance  and  reporting.  The \ninternational consultants will have expertise in (i) project management; (ii) engineering, design, \nand construction of large drainage, wastewater, sanitation, and solid waste projects in the \nregion; (iii) geotechnical, structural, mechanical, and electrical engineering; (iv) contracts and \nprocurement; (v) institutional strengthening and training; (vi) management information systems, \nmonitoring, and evaluation systems; (vii) urban management and urban planning; (viii) tariff \nplanning;  (ix)  financial  management  and  accounting;  (x)  asset  management  for  drainage, \nwastewater,  and  solid  waste  systems;  (xi)  environmental  management  and  monitoring; \n(xii) resettlement  plan  implementation  and  monitoring;  (xiii)  community  awareness  and \nparticipation  programs,  community-based  sanitation,  and  household  sanitation  programs; \n(xiv) implementing gender action plans; and (xv) legal matters and Vietnamese Accounting \nStandards. Table A9.1 provides details of the consulting inputs required.  \n \n8.  Provincial agencies in each project province, and MOC in Hanoi, will provide suitable \noffice accommodation for the consultant. Each PPC, PMU, and URENCO will make available to \nthe consultant all relevant data, maps, and reports, and will also ensure access to all equipment \n(including vehicles, computing, and communication equipment) purchased under the project at \nno cost to the consultant.

The economic analysis has been conducted following the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects (1997) and the Framework for the Economic and Financial \nAppraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects (1994) to test the economic efficiency and \nviability of the Project. Least-cost analyses were undertaken for drainage, wastewater, and \npublic sanitation, and solid waste subprojects. A cost-benefit analysis is carried out for each \ndrainage subproject. The subprojects are evaluated over a period of 30 years with no \nsalvage value assumed thereafter. \n \nB.  Least-Cost Analysis  \n \n2.  Least-cost  analyses  were  carried  out  for  the  three  main  engineering  project \ncomponents:  (i)  combined  drainage  and  wastewater  systems  and  flood  protection,  (ii) \nwastewater treatment in Lang Co and Thanh Hoa, and (iii) solid waste systems, with the \ndevelopment of sanitary landfills and upgrading and expansion of collection systems.  \n \n  1.  Combined Wastewater/Drainage Systems and Flood Protection \n \n3.  The drainage subcomponents in the five provincial towns will improve the combined \ndrainage systems as a first step toward long-term drainage master plans. Separate drainage \nand sewerage systems will be developed in Lang Co, in accordance with its master plan. \nFlood protection improvement will include the construction of dike roads and tide gates.  \n \n4.  The capacity of the combined drain depends primarily on the design storm14 and \ncatchment characteristics, as wastewater represent only a small percentage of the total \nconduit flows in the wet season. Design storm return periods adopted for the project are 2 \nyears for primary drains and 1-2 years for secondary and tertiary drains, in accordance with \ncurrent practice in Vietnam. Designing for more severe events is not justified because the \nincreased costs outweigh the benefits arising from less frequent flooding. \n \n5.  Based on the engineering design criteria, the best technical options have been \nselected providing the necessary combined drainage and flood protection in each town. In \nmost cases, there are no discrete engineering alternatives, so the system is the least-cost \noption to meet drainage and flood protection requirements. \n \n6.  In the case of dikes in Tam Ky and Dong Ha, where these structures are designed to \nprevent annual flooding of residential areas located between the river and the main highway \n(built above the flood level), analyses shows these structures are the least-cost alternative \nwhen compared with the alternative of resettling all households in flood-prone areas. \n \n  2.  Wastewater Collection and Treatment  \u2013 Lang Co and Thanh Hoa \n \n7.  The wastewater subcomponent is designed to collect, treat, and safely dispose of \nwastewater from urban areas in Thanh Hoa and Lang Co. The works in Thanh Hoa include \nconstruction of interceptor chambers on the combined drains, close to their discharge points, \nto divert sewage flows to the interceptor sewer for treatment. The wastewater subcomponent \nin Lang Co will develop a separate sewerage system. The interceptor sewerage system and \nwastewater treatment facility are designed for projected wastewater flows in 2012 in Thanh \nHoa and 2015 in Lang Co, with provision for expansion. \n \n                                                 \n14  The design storm depends on catchment area and rainfall characteristics of the region, which are based on \nstatistical analyses of rainfall data published by Meteorological Department. ", "54 Appendix 13 \n8.  The wastewater treatment works will comprise waste stabilization ponds (WSPs), \nwhich are widely used throughout the world. WSPs are simple to operate and maintain, \nrequire no electricity or chemicals, and will be designed to produce high-quality effluent that \nmeets Vietnamese and international standards. These were shown to be the least-cost \ntreatment option in each case. In Lang Co, alternatives included activated sludge treatment \nand a sea outfall, and in Thanh Hoa activated sludge treatment.  \n \n9.  In  Thanh  Hoa,  comparison  of  combined  drainage  and  wastewater  system  with \nseparate systems demonstrated that the proposed combined system was the least-cost \noption. In the case of Lang Co, comparison of the preferred collection system using septic \ntanks was compared with direct connection of households. While the results (within 10% \ndifference) showed that the preferred option was least cost, it is recommended that the \nalternatives be examined in more detail by the detailed design consultant during project \nimplementation. \n \n  3.  Solid Waste Management \n \n10.  To ensure that the solid waste component is the least-cost option, the following \nsegments of the solid waste project were examined in each town: (i) initial waste storage and \ncollection options, (ii) the need for transfer stations within the towns, and (iii) municipal solid \nwaste treatment and disposal alternatives. \n \n11.  In each town, the collection of solid waste was examined. The ideal situation is where \ncompactor trucks can pick up waste directly from bins. However, this is not possible in all \ntowns because of local conditions (narrow lanes, uneven road and pavement conditions, and \nsocial factors such as vandalism.) The next least-cost collection method is by pedicart or \nhandcart, with compactor trucks picking up solid waste from temporary collection stations. \nThe size and number of compactor trucks was optimized based on local topography and \nvolumes of solid waste to be collected. \n \n12.  Least-cost analyses demonstrated that permanent transfer stations were not justified \nin any towns because of the close proximity of the landfills. The least-cost options were \ntemporary transfer stations where waste from pedicarts and handcarts are transferred to \ntrucks for direct transport to landfill sites. Solid waste collected by compactor trucks from \nhouseholds or bins will be transported directly to the landfill site. \n \n13.  The options evaluated for treatment/disposal of municipal solid waste are sanitary \nlandfills, incineration, and biological conversion. The least-cost analysis showed the landfill \nwas the best option, followed by composting associated with landfill. The incineration option \nwas the most costly. Sanitary landfills are therefore recommended for each town. \n \nC.  Cost-Benefit Analysis for Drainage Subproject \n14.  The cost-benefit analysis for drainage subprojects in each town was undertaken by \ncomparing the cost and benefits under with- and without-project scenarios. The without-\nproject scenario refers to the continuation of the existing situation. The with-project case is \nestablished by appraising the costs and benefits of each of drainage subprojects. The \nsubprojects  are  evaluated  over  a  period  of  30  years  with  no  salvage  value  assumed \nthereafter. \n  1.  Project Cost \n15.  The capital costs and incremental operation and maintenance costs of each drainage \nsubproject have been considered. Economic costs have been derived from financial project \ncosts. All costs are expressed in constant 2003 prices. Physical contingencies of 10% have \nbeen added to the base costs, and taxes and duties have been discounted as appropriate. ", "Appendix 13  55 \nEconomic costs were valued using the domestic price numeraire but expressed in dollars. \nTradable components have been adjusted to economic prices using the shadow exchange \nrate factor (SERF)15 and nontraded components are valued at domestic market prices. \nAppropriate shadow wage rate factors (SWRF) for unskilled labor have been used to reflect \nits opportunity costs in the context of Viet Nam\u2019s wide labor availability.16 Incremental \noperation and maintenance costs have been taken into account and added to capital costs \nto obtain the total economic cost of the subprojects for each year. \n   \n  2.  Economic Benefit. \n \n16.  The subproject will generate benefits both to each town\u2019s economy and to individual \nhouseholds and businesses. Drainage improvements will reduce incidence and severity of \nflooding and will therefore significantly reduce (i) flood damage to properties, (ii) post-flood \ncleanup costs, (iii) lost employment opportunities due to flooding, (iv) loss of income to \nbusinesses  (commerce  and  market  gardening),  (v)  sick  days  lost  due  to  waterborne \ndiseases, and (vi) expenditure on the maintenance of roads, drains, and other municipal \ninfrastructure.  \n \n17.  In some towns, flood protection dike roads to be built under the Project will create \nnew areas of land free from annual flooding for urban and commercial uses. The incremental \nvalue of land created has been taken as a benefit to the project. Surplus excavation material \nwill also be available for land development in most towns. The value of this material has \nbeen counted as a subproject benefit. In Lang Co, fees paid by hotels for drainage services \nhas been counted as a project benefit. In each town, the population in wards where annual \nflooding occurs has been identified. Households in these wards will benefit from reduced or \neliminated flood damage and cleanup  cost. The benefits of less work lost, health costs \nsaved, and travel delays avoided will accrue to the whole town as a result of floods that \nblock roads, disrupt access to markets, schools, hospitals, and public services, and spread \npolluted water throughout towns.  \n \nD.  Results of the Economic Analysis \n \n18.  The economic internal rates of  return (EIRRs) have been calculated for drainage \nsubprojects  in  each  town  and  for  the  overall  drainage  subproject.  The results of the \neconomic analysis are summarized in Table A13. The EIRR for overall drainage subproject \nis 18.3%. EIRRs for individual drainage subprojects range from 16.4% to 21.1%. \n \n19.  Sensitivity analyses have been undertaken to test the robustness of the analysis and \nthe consequences of changes in the following variables: (i) a 10% increase in capital cost, (ii) a \n20% decrease in avoided property damage benefits, (iii) a 20% decrease in avoided work loss, \n(iv) a 20% decrease in health benefits, (v) a 20% decrease in tourism benefits, (vi) a 10% \ndecrease in the overall economic benefits, and (vii) project benefits delayed by 1 year. The \nresults of the analysis show that the Project is most sensitive to delays in project completion. \nHowever, all EIRRs exceed the social opportunity cost of capital and the plausible ranges of \nthe tested variables are well within the respective switching values. \n \nE.  Distribution Analysis  \n \n20.  A distribution analysis has been undertaken for each town to measure the distribution \nof the project benefits to different stakeholders including consumers, government, laborers, \nand urban environmental companies (URENCOs). The analysis shows that, in general, the \nconsumers and laborers receive the majority of project benefits, and the government and the \nURENCOs will experience loss from the Project by subsidizing it in economic terms. The \n                                                 \n15  The SERF is estimated at 1.11. \n16  The SWRF is estimated at 0.65. ", "56 Appendix 13 \ngovernment and URENCOs\u2019 subsidies can be justified by (i) the positive externalities of the \ndrainage and flood protection projects; (ii) the government\u2019s strategy to support development \nof central region, which has been left behind in the past development process; and (iii) the \npotential for an improved urban environment and a more efficient urban system to stimulate \neconomic development and generate revenue for the government. \n \n \nTable A13 1: Results of EIRR Calculation and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n    Base  Capital  Avoided  Avoided  Health  Tourism Overall  Benefits \nCase  Cost  Property  Work loss Benefits  Benefits Benefits  Delayed \n    +10%  Damage  -20%  -20%  -20%  -10%  1 year \n      -20% \nDong Ha  EIRR  17.5% 15.8% 17.3% 16.8% 16.1% N/A 15.6% 14.9%\n  SI  2.5 0.2 0.7 1.4 N/A 3.5 0.4\n  SV  39.4% 100.0% 100.0% 73.4% N/A 28.2% 2.5\nHa Tinh  EIRR  19.0% 17.4% 19.0% 18.5% 17.2% N/A 17.2% 16.4%\n  SI  1.7 0.0 0.4 1.5 N/A 2.7 0.3\n  SV  57.6% 100.0% 100.0% 68.7% N/A 36.6% 3.2\nLang Co  EIRR  17.4% 16.0% 17.2% 16.6% 16.5% 17.0% 15.9% 15.3%\n  SI  2.1 0.3 0.8 1.0 0.4 3.1 0.4\n  SV  48.4% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 32.6% 2.8\nQuang Ngai EIRR  16.4% 14.9% 16.1% 15.4% 15.4% N/A 14.7% 14.2%\n  SI  3.0 0.3 1.2 1.2 N/A 4.0 0.5\n  SV  33.8% 100.0% 85.9% 84.7% N/A 25.3% 2.2\nTam Ky  EIRR  18.2% 16.4% 17.9% 17.5% 17.1% N/A 16.2% 15.4%\n  SI  2.4 0.3 0.6 1.0 N/A 3.4 0.4\n  SV  42.3% 100.0% 100.0% 97.4% N/A 29.7% 2.6\nThanh Hoa  EIRR  21.1% 19.5% 20.9% 20.5% 19.1% N/A 19.4% 20.5%\n  SI  1.2 0.1 0.4 1.3 N/A 2.2 0.4\n  SV  85.1% 100.0% 100.0% 78.9% N/A 46.0% 2.4\n EIRR = economic internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value, N/A = not applicable. \n ", "  Appendix 14  57 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n \nA.  Major Assumptions \n \n1.  The major assumptions applied in the financial analyses are (i) a 16-year period from 2004 \nto 2020; (ii) project-induced incremental revenues and costs are expressed in Vietnamese dong in \nconstant January 2003 prices; (iii) project investment costs include physical contingencies but \nexclude price contingences; (iv) all costs, including capital, operation and maintenance (O&M), and \nreplacement costs, are recorded in the year they are incurred; and (v) equipment components will \nhave a life of 12 years, with 20% residue value, and civil works will have a life of 30 years with no \nresidue value. \n \n2.  The major assumptions employed in the URENCOs\u2019 financial performance assessment are \n(i) the financial projections include all revenues and costs incurred by each URENCO over the \n2004-2014  forecast  period,  (ii)  projected  capital  costs,  operating  revenues,  and  operating \nexpenses  are  presented  in  Vietnamese  dong  and  expressed  in  current  prices,  and  (iii)  the \nprojection assumes that the loan proceeds onlent to the URENCOs will carry a maturity of 20 years \nwith a grace period of 6 years and a fixed interest rate of 5.4%.  \n \n3.  Considering different service demands, usage patterns, and abilities to pay for the services \nby various users, the analysis has divided users of project services into three major groups: \ndomestic,  commercial/institutional,  and  industrial.  Domestic  users  refer  to  households. \nCommercial/institutional users refer to business premises and established institutions including \nschools, hospitals, and government administrative offices. Industrial users are defined as those \ninvolved in medium- and large-scale production of commercial commodities.17 \n \nC.  Urban Drainage/Flood Protection and Wastewater/Public Sanitation \n \n4.  There is no charge on drainage/wastewater service at present in any of the six towns \nexcept  Tam  Ky.  The  service  depends  entirely  on  payments  by  the  provincial/municipal \ngovernments  for  all  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures.  The  respective  provincial/municipal \ngovernments will finance construction and maintenance on the drain and sewerage systems from \ntheir  budgets.  The  proposed  cost-recovery  mechanism  is  a  water  tariff  surcharge  and  an \nenvironmental fee. Under the Project, a water tariff surcharge will be established and collected by \neach  URENCO  to  recover  all  O&M  costs18  for  the  drainage/wastewater  systems.  Each \nprovincial/municipal government will levy an environmental fee19 to recover an appropriate portion \nof capital costs. In the long run, the water  tariff will aim to recover the cost of the wastewater \nsystem when it is separated from the drainage system, while the environmental fee will aim to \nrecover both the recurrent and capital costs of the drainage system.  \n \n5.  The proposed water tariff surcharges are set at such levels to ensure that revenues from \nwater  tariff  surcharges  can  recover  O&M  and  depreciation  costs  on  equipment  for  the \ndrainage/wastewater system. The recommended charge levels are summarized in Table A14.1. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17  For Lang Co, commercial users exclude hotels, guesthouses, and villas, whose service charges will be applied \nseparately. \n18  Including depreciation of all O&M equipment. \n19  Consulting services are provided during the project implementation to analyze the appropriate structure and level of \nthe environmental fees.

Table A14.2 outlines the results of the drainage/wastewater service affordability analysis for \nthe three user groups using the levels of charges to be implemented in 2007.20 For domestic users, \nbased  on  the  generally  accepted  principles  that  the  sum  of  the  charges  for  water, \ndrainage/wastewater, and solid waste services should not exceed 6% of household income, the \ntotal charge for drainage and sewerage should be no greater than 2%. On this basis, the proposed \ncharge levels for drainage/wastewater service are affordable. The affordability analysis indicates \nthat charge levels are affordable to commercial/institutional and industrial users, as the expenditure \nof these users on drainage/wastewater service is below the respective affordability benchmarks of \n0.5% and 1.0% of their average monthly business income.  \n \nTable A14.2: Affordability Analysis \u2013 Drainage and Waste Water \n(dong, January 2003 constant prices) \n \n      Dong Ha  Ha Tinh  Lang Co  Quang Ngai  Tam Ky  Thanh Hoa \n  Poor household             \n    Average monthly household income  600,000  600,000  600,000  600,000  600,000  600,000 \n    Average expenditure on services  10,672  10,623  10,434  9,987  10,327  5,835 \n    Percentage  1.8%  1.8%  1.7%  1.7%  1.7%  1.0% \n  Household with average income             \n    Average monthly household income  1,100,000  1,100,000  1,200,000  1,300,000  1,100,000  1,500,000 \n    Average expenditure on services  16,419  16,344  16,052  15,364  15,888  8,977 \n    Percentage  1.5%  1.5%  1.3%  1.2%  1.4%  0.6% \n \nD.  Solid Waste Management \n \n 7.  All  six  towns  have  started  collecting  charges  for  solid  waste  management  services. \nHowever, they are not enough to finance even the O&M costs of the services. Proposed tariff \nlevels to achieve full cost recovery are summarized in table 14.3. Charges have been determined \non a tonnage basis and then converted to a monthly user charges such as a charge per household \nper month for domestic users,21 charge per bin per month for commercial/institutional users,22 and \ncharge per truckload for industrial users.23 The average tariff requirements for subprojects range \nfrom a low of D71,874/ton for Lang Co to a high of D130,151/ton for Ha Tinh. \n \n8.  The results of the financial analysis for solid waste management subprojects are presented \nin Table A14.4. FIRRs for subprojects range from 7.2% to 10.6%, which are all above the 4% \nweighted average cost of capital. All subprojects are financially viable. The sensitivity of each \nsubproject FIRR is analyzed to consider the following adverse changes: (i) an increase in capital \ncosts, (ii) an increase in O&M costs, (iii) a reduction in revenues, and  (iv) delays in subproject \n                                                 \n20  Based on the following water consumption levels: 78 liters per capita per day for poor households, 120 liters per capita \nper day for average household, 150 cubic meters per month for commercial/institutional users, and 900 cubic meters \nper month for industrial users.  \n21  Average solid waste generated by a household is estimated at 0.09 tons/month. \n22  The monthly turnover capacity of a bin is 2.2 tons. \n23  A truckload equals to 6.0 tons. ", "  Appendix 14  59 \nrevenues. The results indicate that the FIRR is most sensitive to reduction in revenues. The detailed \nresults of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Table A14.4. Table A14.5 shows the results of the \nsolid waste management service affordability analysis using the charge levels to be applied in \n2007.24 The results indicate that tariffs are below the maximum affordability benchmark of 2.0% of \naverage monthly household income, even for poor households.  \n \n \n \nTable A14.3: Proposed Tariff for Solid Waste Management Services \n(dong, current prices) \n \n        2003a  2004 2006 2007 2012\nDong Ha  Domestic (household/month)  7,000 9,473 11,845 13,845 16,926\nCommercial/Institutional \n    (bin/month)  60,000 81,198 101,530 400,556 489,685\n    Industrial (truckload)  220,000 297,726 372,277 728,283 890,336\nHa Tinh  Domestic (household/month)  4,000 5,413 6,769 13,947 17,051\nCommercial/Institutional \n    (bin/month)  50,000 67,665 84,608 410,236 501,519\n    Industrial (truckload)  200,000 270,660 338,434 761,168 930,538\nLang Co  Domestic (household/month)  4,000 5,413 6,769 7,702 9,416\nCommercial/Institutional \n    (bin/month)  75,000 101,498 126,913 369,529 451,755\n    Industrial (truckload)  220,000 297,726 372,277 405,149 495,300\nQuang Ngai  Domestic (household/month)  5,500 7,443 9,307 13,283 16,238\nCommercial/Institutional \n    (bin/month)  60,000 81,198 101,530 278,605 340,598\n    Industrial (truckload)  250,000 338,325 423,042 611,359 747,395\nTam Ky  Domestic (household/month)  5,500 7,443 9,307 11,610 14,193\nCommercial/Institutional \n    (bin/month)  80,000 108,264 135,373 310,692 379,825\n    Industrial (truckload)  230,000 311,259 389,199 488,557 597,267\nThanh Hoa  Domestic (household/month)  6,000 8,120 10,153 13,317 16,280\nCommercial/Institutional \n    (bin/month)  70,000 94,731 118,452 314,647 384,661\n    Industrial (truckload)  250,000 338,325 423,042 525,385 642,291\n a Current solid waste management tariff levels. \n \n \nE.  Financial Performance of URENCOs \n \n9.  All six URENCOs are established public utility enterprises in accordance with Decree 56/CP \nissued on 2 October 1996. Though with varying degrees of financial and operational autonomy, \ntheir operations depend largely on the provincial people\u2019s committee (PPC) OR town people\u2019s \ncommittee (TPC) budget allocation25 for drainage/wastewater, solid waste, and other services, with \nlimited appreciation of user tariff revenue collection. To reduce the budget support, six PPCs/TPCs \nand URENCOs have emphasized the need to adopt the user-pay principle to recover, among other \nthings, cost of O&M including depreciation of O&M equipment for those services identified as cost-\nrecoverable.  Financial  projections  for  six  URENCOs  over  2004-2014  are  based  on  the \ndrainage/wastewater and solid waste charges described above. The URENCOs will establish two \nself-accounting  units  with  separate  accounts  for  drainage/wastewater  and  solid  waste \nmanagement services. The revenues from each service will be collected and retained by the \nrespective unit to directly recover operating costs and amortization of subsidiary loans that finance \nO&M equipment.26 \n \n                                                 \n24  Based on 0.09 ton/month per household. \n25  This implies that the budget allocated has been completely used by year-end. \n26  Other nonrecoverable services need to be fully financed by the PPCs/TPCs on an annual contract basis. ", "60  Appendix 14 \n10.  The  summary  financial  projections  for  six  URENCOs  are  shown  in  Supplementary \nAppendix M. The projections indicate that the financial performance of the URENCOs improves \nover the 2004-2014 forecast period as drainage/wastewater tariffs are applied and solid waste tariff \nincreases are implemented. The government\u2019s budget support to the services will gradually fall and \nfinally be eliminated in 2006. For all project towns, both units may experience cash shortfalls for \nthe first few years when they start to repay the loan principals and interest, but the analysis shows \npositive accumulated net surpluses in all years, indicating their financial capabilities to generate, \nover the project operating life, sufficient revenue to recover all costs for O&M, management, \nadministration,  and  debt  service  obligations.  The  results  also  demonstrate  the  need  and \nimportance of allowing the URENCOs to retain all tariff revenue collected for future expenditure \nand debt services. \n \nTable A14.4: FIRRs and Results of Sensitivity Analysis \n \n    Base Case  Capital Cost   O&M Cost  Revenues  Revenues \n        Up 10%  Up 10%  Down 10%  Delayed 1 Year \nDong Ha  FIRR  8.5%    6.8%    4.4%  2.4%    6.5%  \n  SI                  3.3                 9.2             13.5                 0.4  \n  SV      30.6%    10.9%  7.4%                 2.6  \nHa Tinh  FIRR  7.6%    5.9%    4.6%  2.6%    5.7%  \n  SI                  4.4                 8.3             13.7                 0.5  \n  SV      22.8%    12.0%  7.3%                 2.1  \nLang Co  FIRR  10.4%    8.8%    8.2%  6.4%    7.9%  \n  SI                  1.8                 3.5               6.3                 0.4  \n  SV      54.8%    28.6%  15.8%                 2.8  \nQuang Ngai  FIRR  9.9%    8.1%    6.8%  4.8%    7.6%  \n  SI                  2.5                 5.3               8.7                 0.3  \n  SV      40.8%    18.9%  11.4%                 3.1  \nTam Ky  FIRR  7.2%    5.7%    5.8%  4.1%    5.4%  \n  SI                  4.3                 4.4               9.7                 0.5  \n  SV      23.4%    22.6%  10.3%                 1.8  \nThanh Hoa  FIRR  10.6%    8.4%    6.4%  4.0%    8.0%  \n SI                  2.6                 6.3               9.9                 0.3  \n SV      38.5%    15.8%  10.1%                 3.2  \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, SI = sensitivity indicator,  \nSV = switching value. \n \n \nTable A14.5: Affordability Analysis \u2013 Solid Waste Management \n(dong, January 2003 constant price) \n \n            Dong Ha Ha Tinh Lang Co Quang Ngai Tam Ky Thanh Hoa\nDomestic Users \n   Poor Householdsa \n      Average Monthly Household Income  600,000  600,000  600,000  600,000  600,000  600,000 \n      Average Expenditure on Services  11,789  11,876  6,558  11,310  9,886  11,340 \n      Percentage  2.0% 2.0% 1.1% 1.9% 1.6% 1.9%\n   Household with Average Income \n      Average Monthly Household Incomeb  1,100,000  1,100,000  1,200,000  1,300,000  1,100,000  1,500,000 \n      Average Expenditure on Services  11,789  11,876  6,558  11,310 9,886  11,340 \n      Percentage  1.1% 1.1% 0.5% 0.9% 0.9% 0.8%\na  With income below the poverty line of D750,000/month/household (Ministry of Labor, Invalid and Social Affairs criteria).  \nb  Based on socioeconomic survey results.
