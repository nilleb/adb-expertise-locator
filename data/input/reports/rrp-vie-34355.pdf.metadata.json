It will \nimprove  drainage,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  systems  in  five \nprovincial towns and one district level town in the central region of \nViet  Nam,  where \ninfrastructure  poses  serious \nenvironmental  and  health  risks,  and  inhibits  social  and economic \ndevelopment. The towns are Dong Ha, Ha Tinh, Lang Co, Quang \nNgai,  Tam  Ky,  and  Thanh  Hoa.  The  Project  will  also  increase \nenvironmental  and  health  awareness  and  promote  the  active \nparticipation of citizens, particularly women and the poor, in urban \nmanagement and services. \n \nFollowing  many  years  of  rapid  urbanization, \nlevel  of \ninvestment made for maintenance, repairs, and new capital works \nover the past decade in the urban sector has not been sufficient to \nprovide the necessary urban infrastructure. Weak institutions, lack \nof  qualified  human  resources,  financial  constraints,  lack  of \ncommunity  participation  and  slow \nimplementation  of  an \nappropriate legal framework for the urban sector have contributed \nto  the  low  coverage  and  inefficiency  of  urban  services.  This \nsituation  has  led  to  serious  deficiencies  in  the  availability  of \ninfrastructure  and  access  to  municipal  services  in  urban  areas, \nparticularly  for  the  poor.  Although  the  Government  and  several \nfunding  agencies,  including  the  Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave  made  efforts  in  recent  years  to  improve  the  situation  in  the \nlarger  urban  centers,  provincial  towns,  particularly  in  the  Central \nRegion,  have  received  much  less  attention,  except  for  the \nimprovement  of  water  supply  systems.  As  a  result,  urban  water \npollution in Project towns in the Central Region has increased and \nflooding occurs frequently. \n \n\nthe \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope  \n\n \n\nthe \n\n(ii)  promote  balanced \n\nThe  lack  of  adequate  infrastructure  and  services  in  urban  areas \nhas  deteriorated  health  profiles  of \nlocal  population, \nconstrained investment and economic growth in the towns and the \nrural areas around them, accentuated poverty and vulnerability of \nthe local population, and impacted on quality of life. Furthermore, \nlack  of  opportunities  in  the  towns  of  the  central  region  fuels \nmigration  to  the  major  cities  of  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City \n(HCMC),  increasing  problems  in  those  cities  and  promoting \nunbalanced regional development. \n \nUrgent  measures  are  necessary \nto  address  deteriorating \nenvironmental conditions in urban centers and transform them into \nsources of economic growth and employment.  ADB\u2019s intervention \nis  based  on  the  necessity  to  (i)  improve  urban  infrastructure  to \nsustain  economic  growth, \nregional \ndevelopment,  (iii)  reduce  poverty  and  vulnerability  by  improving \nenvironmental  and  health  conditions  in  urban  areas,  and  (iv) \nimprove  the  sustainability  and  efficiency  of  urban  services.  The \nProject  will  increase  the  attractiveness  of  selected  towns  in  the \ncentral  region,  helping  them  serve  as  counter-magnets  for  rural \nmigrants  who  would  normally  move  to  Hanoi  or  HCMC  and \nimproving  welfare  and  opportunities  for  residents  of  provincial \nurban centers. \n \nThe  long-term  project  goals  are  to  (i) improve  the  quality  of  life \nand health status of urban residents and reduce poverty in the six \nproject  towns  and  surrounding  areas;  and  (ii)  promote  balanced \nregional  economic  development  and  reduce  migration  from  the \ncentral region to Hanoi and HCMC . The objective of the Project is \nto  improve  urban  environmental  conditions  in  project  towns. \nProject  outputs  include  (i)  expanding  and  upgrading  urban \nenvironmental \nimproving  autonomy  and \n(ii) \nmanagerial  and  technical  capacity  of  the  urban  environmental \ncompanies  (URENCOs);  (iii)  improving  urban  management  and \nplanning \n(TPCs); \n(iv) strengthening  urban  management  policies  through  support  to \nthe  newly  established  Department  of  Urban  Infrastructure  in  the \nMinistry of Construction; (v) developing appropriate cost-recovery \nmechanisms  to  ensure  sustainability  of  urban  environmental \nservices;  (vi)   increasing  community  participation  in  the  planning \nand management of urban services, particularly by the poor; (vii) \nenhancing public health awareness; and  (viii) enhancing the role \nof women in urban management and institutions. \n \n\ninfrastructure; \n\ncapacity  of \n\ntownspeople \n\ncommittees \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\niii \n\n \n\n \nThe  Project  will  comprise  five  parts:  part  A,  awareness  and  pro-\npoor  sanitation;  part  B,  drainage  and  flood  protection;  part  C, \nwastewater  and  public  sanitation;  part  D,  solid  waste \nimplementation  assistance  and \nmanagement;  and  part  E, \ninstitutional strengthening. The project area includes the provincial \ncapital  towns  of  Dong  Ha,  Ha  Tinh,  Quang  Ngai,  Tam  Ky,  and \nThanh Hoa, and the district-level town of Lang Co. Part D will also \ninclude  Chan  May  urban  area,  Phu  Loc  district  town,  and  four \ncommunes in Phu Loc District of Thua Thien Hue Province. \n \nThe total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, \nduties,  taxes,  and  interest  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$96.0  million  equivalent.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  $53.6 \nmillion  equivalent,  or  55.8%  of  total.  The  local  currency  cost, \nincluding duties and taxes, is $42.4 million equivalent, or 44.2% of \ntotal. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provides a loan of $44.0 million equivalent \nfrom  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  cover  45.8%  of  the  total \nproject  cost.  The  ADB  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. It will carry an interest rate of \n1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter. The French aid \nagency, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), will provide \na  loan  of  30  million  euros  ($31.8  million  equivalent)  for  joint \nfinancing  of  parts  B,  C,  and  E.  The  proposed  AFD  loan  has  two \ncomponents: a normal loan (or PS1) of $26.5 million equivalent for \nphysical  works,  and  a  concessional  loan  (or  PTC)  of  $5.3 million \nequivalent for capacity strengthening activities. The PS1 loan will \nhave a maturity of 20 years with a grace period of 7 years, and an \ninterest rate of 2.5% for the entire term. The PTC loan will have a \nmaturity  of  30  years  with  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  and  an \ninterest  rate  of  1%  for  the  entire  term.  The  remaining  $20.2 \nmillion,  equivalent  to  21.1%  of  the  total  project  cost,  is  the  local \ncounterpart  contribution  financed  by  the  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees (PPCs) and beneficiaries. \n\n \n\n \nSource \n\n                                                                      $ million (equivalent) \nLocal \nCurrency \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nPercent \n\n \n\nADB \n\nAFD \n\nPPCs \n\nBeneficiaries  \n\n31.7 \n\n21.9 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n12.3 \n\n9.9 \n\n20.1 \n\n0.1 \n\n44.0 \n\n31.8 \n\n20.1 \n\n0.1 \n\n45.8% \n\n33.1% \n\n21.0% \n\n0.1% \n\nTotal \n\n100.0% \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AFD  =  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nDeveloppement, PPC = provincial people\u2019s committees. \n\n53.6 \n\n42.4 \n\n96.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\nOnlending Arrangements  The Borrower for  the  proposed  ADB  and  AFD  loans  will  be  the \nGovernment of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The loans will \nfinance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  part  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost.  Part  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  onlent  by  the \nGovernment  to  URENCOs  through  subsidiary  loans  in  domestic \ncurrency to cover the cost of operation and maintenance (O&M), \nequipment  for  drainage/flood  protection,  wastewater  and  public \nsanitation,  and  solid  waste  components.  The  Government  will \nprovide the remaining portion of the ADB loan and the entire AFD \nloan  to  PPCs  as  grants.  The  subsidiary  loans  to  URENCOs  will \nhave a maturity of 20 years with a grace period of 6 years, and a \nfixed  interest  rate  of  5.4%.  The  Government  will  assume  the \nforeign exchange risk. \n \nUntil 31 December 2009 \n \n30 June 2009 \n \n \nEach PPC will be the executing agency in its province. \n \n \n \nThe  PPC  in  each  province  has  set  up  a  provincial  steering \ncommittee (PSC), which will have overall responsibility for project \nimplementation  and  policy  guidance.  A  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  in  each  province  will  support  the  PSC,  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  daily  implementation  activities.  The  Women\u2019s \nUnion,  supervised  by  a  community  management  committee,  will \nhave  primary  responsibility  for  managing  part  A.  For  overall \nproject  coordination  at  the  national  level,  a  Project  Advisory \nCommittee will be established and will be supported by a project \ncoordination unit (PCU) within the Ministry of Construction. \n \nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  contracts  and  supply \ncontracts valued above $2.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, \nwill  be  procured  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  Local  competitive  bidding  contracts  include  civil \nworks  and  supply  contracts  valued  at  or  below  the  given \nthresholds. Where special license is required, or where there is no \nadequate  competition,  supply and installation contracts valued at \nor  below  $100,000  may  be  awarded  following  direct  purchase \nprocedures, subject to approval by ADB on a case-by-case basis. \nSupply contracts for equipment and vehicles valued at $0.5 million \nor  less  per  contract  will  be  procured  through  international \nshopping procedures, and supply contracts valued at $100,000 or \nless  will  follow  direct  purchase  procedures.  Minor  works  for \nrehabilitating  existing  facilities  such  as  drains  may  be  carried  out \nby force account. \n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nv\n\nalso \n\nsupport \n\n \nTo  support  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  a  total  of  1,220 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services  (116  person-months  of \ninternational  and  1,104  person-months  of  domestic)  will  be \nrequired  for  assistance  in  project  management,  resettlement, \ngender  and  environmental  aspects,  and  design  and  construction \nsupervision.  Consultants  will \ninstitutional \nstrengthening  by  preparing  and  delivering  on-the-job training and \ncapacity building. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \nThe Project will develop and  expand urban services to poor and \nlow-income  households,  help  generate  new  employment \nopportunities, \nincrease  gender  equality,  develop  community \nownership  and  self-reliance,  accelerate  public  administration \nreform,  reduce  risk  of  disease \nthrough  health  awareness \nprograms, and ensure a sustainable environment. About 21.2% of \nthe total beneficiaries from the  Project  are  expected  to  be  poor. \nPoverty rates in the six project towns are higher than the national \nurban average of 11.1%, and poverty in  Chan May town and Phu \nLoc district is higher than the total national average.  About 16.3% \nof the urban population in the project towns and  about 40% of the \nresidents  in  Phu  Loc  district  are  poor.  The  social  and  gender \nimpacts  of  the  Project  will  be  positive  for  all  income  groups,  and \nthe  benefits  for  low-income  groups,  women,  and  children  will  be \nsignificant.  All  project  components  will  contribute  significantly  to \nimproving  the  urban  environment  and  public  health  conditions, \nand  will  stimulate  private  investments  in  the  towns.  The  Project \nwill  strengthen  community  and  beneficiary  involvement  in  project \ndesign and implementation. Enhanced public awareness of urban \ndevelopment  challenges,  financial  requirements  for  appropriate \nO&M  of  urban  infrastructure,  and  relationships  between  health, \nenvironment,  and  economic  progress  are  expected  to  increase \nwillingness \nfor  greater \ntransparency  and  efficiency  of  urban  service  providers  and  local \nauthorities monitoring their performance. \n \nThe Project will improve drainage and sewerage, reduce flooding, \nand benefit around 504,000 people.  The  Lang  Co  subproject will \nbenefit  an  additional  158,000  permanent  residents  in  Chan  May \ntown  and  Phu  Loc  district  through  the  proposed  regional  solid \nwaste  system.  Urban  residents  will  benefit  from  improved  health \nand  living  conditions  resulting  from  reduced  flooding,  removal of \nwastewater from urban areas, increased coverage of solid waste \ncollection,  and  flood-free  land.  The  Lang  Co  subproject  will \nsupport tourism development and provide increased opportunities \nfor  employment  for  local  residents.  The  Project  will  improve  the \nsustainability  of  urban  services,  leading  to  increased  coverage \nand  improved  service  levels  for  residents,  businesses,  and  other \nuser groups. \n \n\nfor  services  and  demand \n\nto  pay \n\n\fvi \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nlack  of \n\nfor  project \n\nThe  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i)  limited  human \nresources  and  capacities  of  TPCs,  URENCOs,  and  town-level \nwomen\u2019s  unions \nimplementation;  (ii)  uncertainty \nregarding  tariff  increases  necessary  to  ensure  sustainability  of \nurban  services;  (iii) insufficient  community  participation  in  project \nimplementation,  particularly  from  women  and  the  poor;  (iv)  poor \nand  vulnerable  households  negatively  affected  by  resettlement; \n(v)  delays  caused  by  the  lack  of  experience  of  the  PMUs  in \nlocal \nmanaging  an  ADB-funded  project;  and  (vi) \ngovernment ownership of sanitation facilities.  \n \nThe  project  incorporates  mitigation  measures  to  address  these \nrisks.  They  include  (i)  an  institutional  strengthening  program  for \nTPCs,  URENCOs,  and  town-level  women\u2019s  unions  to  increase \ntheir  managerial  and  operational  capacities;  (ii)  a  detailed,  time-\nbound  tariff  increase  program  for  urban  environmental  services \naffordable  to  all  citizens  and  agreed  by  PPCs;  (iii)  a  participation \nprogram,  gender  action  plan,  and  public  awareness  campaigns \nincluded  in  the  project  design;  (iv)  a  resettlement  framework and \nresettlement  plans  to  ensure  that  affected  people  maintain  or \nimprove their living standard after project completion; (v) the PCU \nand  consultants  with  experience  in  implementing  ADB-assisted \nprojects  will  help  PMUs  establish  effective  project  management, \nreporting,  and  bidding  procedures;  and  (vi)  local  ownership  is \nensured  through  PPCs\u2019  commitment  to  tariff  increases  and \nallocation of revenues for O&M. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  the  proposed \n1. \nloan  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Central  Region  Urban  Environmental \nImprovement Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nFollowing  the  request  of  the  Government  of  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  (the \nGovernment),  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  technical  assistance  (TA)1  to \nprepare  the  Central  Region  Urban  Environmental  Improvement  Project.  The  TA  built  on  a \nprevious  ADB-supported  TA2  study.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  economic  and  social \ndevelopment of the central region of Viet Nam and promote balanced regional development. It \nwill complement other ADB interventions in the region in the framework of the Country Strategy \nand Program (CSP) for Viet Nam.3 \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  population  in  2003  is  almost  80  million,  about  20  million  in  urban  areas. \nUrbanization  has  increased  markedly\u2014from  20%  in  1990  to  about  25%  in  2003\u2014and  the \nGovernment estimates that about 45% of the population will live in urban areas by 2020. Lack of \nsufficient land, capital investment, and employment opportunities in rural areas and towns in the \ncentral region  over  the  past  decade  have  fuelled  migration  to  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City \n(HCMC).  The  population  of  the  two  major  cities  increased  about  1.5  times  over  the  past  10 \nyears,  and  now  accounts  for  almost  40%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  urban  population.  Hanoi  and \nHCMC have attracted most foreign investment and assistance, adding to the attraction for rural \nmigrants  to  these  cities  and  harming  balanced  urban  and  regional  development.  Furthermore, \nrapid  migration  to  the  two  major  cities  has  caused  deterioration  of  the  urban  environment, \nexacerbation of urban poverty, and worsening urban unemployment.  \n \n4. \nDespite substantial migration away from the central region over the past 10 years, that \narea\u2019s  urban  population  continues  growing  at  an  average  of  4.7%  a  year.  In  1999,  cities \naccounted  for  20.6%  of  total  population  in  the  region  compared  to  17.5%  10  years  earlier. \nDuring  the  last  decade,  the  urban  population  of  the  region  rose  56%  to  4.5  million,  compared \nwith a national increase of 43%. Population in project towns has grown quickly and ranges from \n57,000 in Ha Tinh to 186,000 in Thanh Hoa, while the district town of Lang Co has about 11,000 \npermanent  residents.  Urban  poverty  levels  in  the  project  towns  are  higher  than  the  national \naverage urban poverty level, ranging from 13.5% to 19.2%.  \n \nUrban  infrastructure  in  the  six  project  towns  is  unable  to  meet  the  growing  demand \n5. \nbecause  of  lack  of  capital  investment,  lack  of  funds  for  maintenance,  and  weak  institutional \narrangements. Project towns have combined drainage systems in which was tewater and storm \nwater  are  conveyed  in  common  conduits  then  discharged  in  rivers  or  other  watercourses. \nCoverage of the drainage systems in urban areas is very low, ranging from less than 0.1 meter \n(m)  per  capita  in  the  district  town  of  Lang  Co  to  0.2-0.4  m  per  capita  in  the  provincial  towns. \nCovered  drains  are  usually  limited  to  main  roads  in  high-  or  medium-density  areas.  In  the \nproject  towns,  annual  flooding  occurs  in  more  than  30\u201340%  of  the  urban  area.  While  around \n40% of households in provincial towns and 10% in the district town have septic tanks, only a few \nare connected to sewers or drains. Composting latrines and defecation in open areas are used \ninstead. They create major health risks, particularly during floods.  Solid waste is collected from \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

It is then deposited \nin unsanitary landfills. The remaining uncollected waste is burned or dumped in the streets and \nvacant  land,  and  eventually  ends  up  in  the  drainage  system.  About  61%  of the collected solid \nwaste is generated by domestic activities, with only 20\u201330% from industries. About 15\u201325% of \nsolid waste is recycled, mostly by waste collectors in urban areas or by scavengers at landfills.  \n \nProject  towns  require  improved  environmental  infrastructure  if  they  are  to  become \n6. \neffective  centers  of  economic  growth,  attract  investment,  generate  employment  opportunities, \nand  eventually  draw  rural  migrants  away  from  the  magnet  of  Hanoi  and  HCMC .  The  five \nprovincial capitals included in the Project need to improve their urban infrastructure systems and \nservice  coverage  so  that  they  can  function  as  sustainable  regional  economic  centers.  Major \ntourism  development  planned  for  Lang  Co  over  the  next  5\u201310  years  has  potential  to  pollute \nbeaches, waterways, and groundwater and will increase health risks unless steps are taken to \nupgrade  sewerage  and  sanitation.  One  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  objectives  is  to  address \nproblems caused by migration to the major cities and correct the imbalance in living standards \nbetween  the  major  cities  and  poorer  areas  in  the  central  region.    Providing  adequate  urban \ninfrastructure and services is a key factor in addressing the imbalance in regional development. \nThe Project framework is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \n7. \nThe Government selected the project towns based on a comparative analysis of towns in \nthe 18 provinces in the central region. Selection criteria included (i) urban population growth, (ii) \nurban  and  rural  poverty  levels,  (iii)  economic  development  potential,  and  (iv) infrastructure \nneeds.  The  district  town  of  Lang  Co  was  selected  as  a  pilot  case  for  sustainable  urban \nenvironmental  management  in  a  very  small  town  because  of  its  tourism  potential.  The  five \nprovincial capitals act as administrative and economic centers for their surrounding rural areas, \nand provide most of the nonagricultural employment in their provinces.   \n \n8. \nSince the mid-1980s, external funding agencies have provided loans of more than $700 \nmillion for developing drainage, sanitation, and solid waste projects in Viet Nam. Approximately \n65% of this amount has financed environmental improvement projects in HCMC ($308 million) \nand Hanoi ($156 million). In provincial towns, external assistance has focused on water supply \nsystems, but investment in drainage, sanitation, and solid waste improvements in the towns has \nbeen  relatively  small,  particularly  in  the  central  region.  Detailed  information  on  external \nassistance to Viet Nam\u2019s urban sector is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n9. \nThe  key  problems  of  the  urban  sector  in  Viet  Nam  include  (i)  inadequate  capital \ninvestment  in  drainage,  wastewater,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  systems;  (ii)  lack  of  central \ngovernment  guidance  for  urban  management,  slow  implementation  of  policy  reforms  at  the \nprovincial  level,  and  an  incomplete  legal  framework;  (iii)  weak  and  unaccountable  urban \ninstitutions  and  poorly  defined  institutional  arrangements;  (iv)  inadequate  cost  recovery \nmechanisms  to  obtain  sufficient  financial  resources  for  proper  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M);  (v)  insufficient  technical  and  managerial  human  resources  capacity  in  urban \nmanagement  and  services  agencies;  and  (vi)  poor  community  awareness  and  participation  in \nplanning  and  management  of  urban  services,  particularly  for  women.  A  detailed  urban  sector \nanalysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n10. \nSince  1990,  the  Government  has  introduced  policies  and  reforms  to  improve  the \nefficiency  of  the  urban  sector  and  promote  urban  development.  The  Comprehensive  Poverty \nReduction  and  Growth  Strategy  2001\u20132010  mentions  several  objectives  relevant  to  the  urban \nsector, including  (i)  promoting  balanced  and  sustainable  economic  growth  between  regions; \n\n\f3 \n\n(ii) developing urban areas to create more jobs and improve living standards;4 (iii) strengthening \nenvironment protection and ensuring a healthy environment;5  (iv) promoting gender equity and \nenhancing  the  participation  of  women  at  all  levels  of  leadership;  (v) implementing  fully  the \ndecree on democracy at the grassroots level to improve people\u2019s participation in local economic \ndevelopment; and (vi) strengthening accountability at all levels, especially local governments, by \nimproving transparency of and publicity for local budgets. \n  \n11. \nThe Government\u2019s policies for urban development are presented in the Orientation Plan \nfor  Urban  Development  to  2020.  The  orientation  plan\u2019s  objective  is  to  progressively  provide \nurban areas with appropriate modern infrastructure and a healthy environment to allow them to \nactively contribute to the country\u2019s socioeconomic development. The policy gives emphasis to (i) \ndeveloping  urban  centers  as  economic  growth  centers,  (ii)  developing  and  modernizing \ntechnical  and  social  infrastructure  to  attract  investment  and  improve  living  standards,  (iii) \nreducing  gaps  in  economic  development  and  living  standards  between  urban  and  rural  areas, \nand  (iv)  ensuring  sustainable  urban  development  by  taking  account  of  environmental  factors \nand efficient use of natural resources. The plan recognizes the need to strengthen and improve \nthe efficiency of urban management systems and policies.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  targets  and  policies  for  drainage  and  sanitation, \n12. \nreflected in the Orientation Plan for Urban Drainage Development to 2020 are to (i) improve and \ncomplete urban drainage and sewerage systems to ensure a minimum of 80\u201390% coverage by \n2020,  (ii)  require  enterprises  to  have  onsite  treatment  for  toxic  liquid  waste,  (iii) eliminate pit \nlatrines in urban areas by 2005, (iv) provide waste collection systems that treat solid and liquid \nwastes,  and  (v)  gradually  rehabilitate  and  clean  the  canal  systems.  To  achieve  these \ndevelopment  targets,  the  Government  emphasizes  the  importance  of  institutional  reforms in \ndeveloping  efficient  and  sustainable  water  and  sanitation  sectors.  Specifically,  the  orientation \nplans  call  for  (i)  restructuring  the  Ministry  of  Construction  (MOC)  to  refocus  its  functions  in \ndevelopment planning, sector policy formulation, regulations, training, and technology transfer, \nand  terminating  its  direct  involvement  in  business  activities;  (ii)  clearly  defining  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of various Government agencies involved in the water and sanitation sector and \nencouraging  better  cooperation  among  these  sector  agencies;  (iii)  making  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees  (PPCs)  the  responsible  agencies  for  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  drainage \ndevelopment  in  the  provinces;  (iv)  providing  training  and  capacity  building  on  project \nimplementation  and  O&M  encouraging  service  providers  to  become  self-financing  and \nprogressively  eliminating  subsidies;  (v)  creating  the  legal  basis  for  providing  public  urban \nservices,  with  enhanced  enforcement;  (vi) promoting  community  education  and  awareness, \nparticularly on drainage and sanitation issues; (vii) mobilizing additional financial resources; (viii) \nprotecting  water  sources;  (ix) upgrading  technology  and  materials;  and  (x) developing human \nresources. \n \n13. \nThe  Government\u2019s  urban  solid  waste  management  strategy,  which  lasts  until  the  year \n2020,  sets  out  Government  objectives  and  policies  for  managing  solid  waste  in  urban  areas. \nOne of its targets is that cities and provincial towns will collect and dispose of at least 85% of \nurban  and  industrial  solid  waste  in  appropriate  landfills  by  2005,  90%  by  2010,  and  95%  by \n2020.  The  strategy\u2019s  long-term  objectives  for  2020  also  include  strengthening  solid  waste \nmanagement  by  (i)  completing  the  legal  framework  to  complement  the  Law  on  Environmental \nProtection;  (ii) increasing  investments  in  solid  waste  infrastructure  systems;  (iii)  promoting \nawareness and strengthening training in solid waste management and environmental protection; \n(iv)  reforming  cost  recovery  systems  to  ensure  that  fees  charged  to  organizations  and \n                                                 \n4   Specific  measures  include  appropriate  urban  planning  and  design  to  ensure  that  sanitation  and  environmental \nrequirements are met, and taking proper account of the requirements of the urban poor and their ability to pay for \nurban services.  \n\n5   Specific  measures  include  providing  guidelines  for  environment  protection  and  pollution  reduction,  reducing \n\nenvironmental degradation, and constructing wastewater and solid waste facilities in urban areas.  \n\n\f4 \n\nhouseholds  are  sufficient  to  cover  O&M  costs  for  solid  waste  collection,  transportation,  and \ntreatment;  (v) strengthening  institutions  engaged  in  solid  waste  management  institutions;  and \n(vi) adopting modern equipment and technology where appropriate. \n \n14. \nIn June 1999, MOC issued guidelines for setting water supply and drainage tariffs. PPCs \nstill  hold  authority  to  set  tariffs,  but  the  guidelines  provide  a  framework  and  methodology  for \nthem to use in establishing these tariffs. A drainage charge is to be no lower than 10% of the \ntotal water production cost. However, the guidelines give no timeframe for applying the drainage \ncharge. As a result, only a few provinces apply drainage and wastewater charges. At present, \ndrainage charges are levied in only one of the six project towns: Tam Ky. However, even there \nthe  fees  the  PPC  collects  are  not  used  for  O&M  for  drainage  and  sewerage.  For  solid  waste \nmanagement, tariffs are set at levels that do not allow sufficient funds to be collected for proper \nO&M.  Although  the  Government  has  introduced  policies  and  reforms  to  improve  the  financial \nautonomy and sustainability of urban service providers\u2014increasing cost-recovery through user \ncharges and gradually eliminating central Government subsidies\u2014existing policies have yet to \nbe fully implemented at the provincial level. \n \n15. \nTown  people\u2019s  committees  (TPCs)  are  responsible  for  administration  in  provincial  and \ndistrict towns. Most TPCs have established urban management divisions, but they lack capacity \nto perform because of scarce human resources. In many cases there is confusion between the \nrole of the TPCs and the role of the departments of construction at the PPCs. TPCs do not have \nthe  mandate  or  capacity  to  fix  or  assign  performance  standards  to  urban  environmental \ncompanies  (URENCOs)  or  to  monitor  their  performance.  Poor  performance  by  the  URENCOs \nand TPCs results in a general lack of trust from citizens and a reluctance to pay service fees. \n \n16. \nUrgent  measures  are  necessary  to  address  deteriorating  environmental  conditions  in \nurban  centers  and  transform  them  into  sources  of  economic  growth  and  employment.  The \nProject  will  help  the  Government  achieve  its  objectives  for  the  urban  sector  by  (i) providing \ncapital investment in urban areas of high government priority; (ii) supporting the preparation of \nnational guidelines on urban management and facilitating the implementation of national policies \nat the provincial level; (iii) improving urban institutions capabilities and institutional framework for \nurban  environmental  management;  (iv)  establishing \nto  ensure \nsustainability and O&M of environmental urban services, (v) improving managerial and technical \ncapacities of URENCOs and TPCs, and (vi) increasing community awareness and participation, \nparticularly among women, in planning and managing urban services. A policy and institutional \nreform agenda is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n 17. \nLessons Learned. Some major lessons have been learned through implementing water \nsupply  and  sanitation  projects  in  Viet  Nam  and  ADB  urban-sector  interventions  in  other \ncountries. One key lesson is that  projects often face delays in establishing project management \nunits  (PMU),  selecting  consultants,  acquiring  land,  resettling  people,  awarding contracts, and \nmaking  disbursements.  These  delays  have  increased  project  costs  and  frustrated  both \nbeneficiaries  and  local  authorities.  There  is  a  need  for  (i)  greater  delegation  of  authority  to \nlower-level government agencies for implementation, with central Government ministries acting \nas  facilitators;  (ii) intensive  assistance  to  the  executing  agencies  in  project  planning  and \nmanagement  early  during  implementation;  (iii)  advance  action  for  recruiting  consultants;  (iv) \nestablishment of PMUs during project preparation; and (v) timely preparation for land acquisition \nand  resettlement.  Early  and  systematic  training  in  Government  and  ADB  procedures  for  all \nproject  stakeholders\u2014including  provincial  agencies,  consultants,  counterpart  staff,  and \nrepresentatives of community groups\u2014will be essential to minimize delays. \n \n18. \nPrevious projects yield further lessons that have been incorporated in the Project. Community-\nbased activities and public health awareness programs have not been optimized in previous projects \nbecause PMUs were reluctant to allocate funds, coordination was lacking among local institutions, \n\nfinancial  mechanisms \n\n\f5 \n\npublic awareness programs were poorly timed, and consultations with communities were limited. A \nmechanism is needed to ensure appropriate attention to this component and facilitate coordination \namong local stakeholders. Institutional capacities and framework must be improved to ensure efficient \nurban  management  and  service  delivery.  Easy-to-implement cost recovery mechanisms must be \nestablished and the resources collected should be used for proper O&M. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nThe long-term goals of the Project are to (i) improve the quality of life and health status \n19. \nof  urban  residents  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  six  project  towns  and  surrounding  areas,  and \n(ii) promote  balanced  regional  economic  development  and  reduce  migration  from  the  central \nregion  to  Hanoi  and  HCMC .  The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  urban  environmental \nconditions in project towns.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n20. \nProject outputs include (i) expanding and upgrading urban environmental infrastructure; \n(ii) improving autonomy and managerial and technical capacity of the URENCOs; (iii) improving \nurban management and planning capacities of the TPCs; (iv) strengthening urban management \npolicies  through  support  to  the  newly  established  Department  of  Urban  Infrastructure  in  MOC; \n(v)  developing  appropriate  cost-recovery  mechanisms  to  ensure  sustainability  of  urban \nenvironmental  services;  (vi)   increasing  community  participation  in  planning  and  managing \nurban  services,  particularly  by  the  poor;  (vii)  enhancing  public  health  awareness;  and  (viii) \nenhancing the role of women in urban management and institutions.  \n \nThe Project will comprise five parts: part A, awareness and pro-poor sanitation; part B, \n21. \ndrainage  and  flood  protection;  part  C,  wastewater  and  public  sanitation;  part  D,  solid  waste \nmanagement; and part E, implementation assistance and institutional strengthening. The project \narea  includes  the  provincial  capital  towns  of  Dong  Ha,  Ha  Tinh,  Quang  Ngai,  Tam  Ky,  and \nThanh  Hoa,  as  well  as  the  district-level  town  of  Lang  Co.  Part  D  will  also  include  Chan  May \nurban  area,  Phu  Loc  district  town,  and  four  communes  in  Phu  Loc  District  of  Thua  Thien  Hue \nProvince. A detailed description of the components is presented in Supplementary Appendix B. \nA brief description follows. \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Awareness and Pro-poor Sanitation \n\n22. \nPart  A  includes  (i)  a  community  awareness  and  participation  program  (CAPP), \n(ii) community-based  sanitation  (CBS),  and  (iii)  a  household  sanitation  program  (HSP).  It  will \ntarget poor and low-income households, communities, neighborhoods, and households without \nappropriate access to urban sanitation. \n \n23. \nThe  CAPP  consists  of  (i)  raising  community  awareness  on  sanitation  and  health,  and \nworking  with  URENCO  to  better  reach  female  staff  and  educate  landfill  scavengers  on \noccupational  health  hazards,  (ii)  raising  awareness  for  protecting  and  conserving  urban \nenvironmental  infrastructure,  (iii) motivating  households  to  connect  to  and  pay  for  urban \nenvironmental infrastructure and services, and (iv) informing potential beneficiaries on financial \nassistance available to improve community or household environmental sanitation. \n \n24. \nThe  CBS aims to (i) improve community small infrastructure, and (ii) improve community \nparticipation and ownership in urban sanitation. The CBS will provide small grants, technical advice, \nand training for demand-driven, small-scale environmental sanitation improvements in urban areas \nnot covered by other major infrastructure components. Community groups and neighborhoods will \nselect, design, and implement local sanitation improvements, and will contribute to the works. \n \n25. \nThe HSP will provide grants, mostly to women, to help poor and low-income households \nwithin urban wards, to build septic tanks, toilets, and/or connect household wastewater to public \n\n\f6 \n\ndrainage or sewage systems. The women\u2019s union in each town will administer the  program and \nprovide  technical  information  to  beneficiaries  with  the  assistance  of  URENCOs  and  TPCs \nthrough the community management committee (CMC). \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Drainage and Flood Protection \n\nPart  B  includes  (i)  drainage  improvement,  and  (ii)  flood  protection  improvement. \n26. \nDrainage improvement will include improving flood regulating basins, rehabilitating and cleaning \n55  kilometers  (km)  of  existing  drains,  building  or  upgrading  60  km  of  primary  drains, \nconstructing 175 km of secondary drains, and building 138 km of tertiary drains to convey storm \nwater and wastewater to downstream outfalls. Major primary drains will follow existing drainage \nroutes, and will consist of box culverts in densely populated areas, or open channels with raised \nembankments  in  low-density  areas.  Flood  protection  improvement  will  include  building  dikes \nand  roads,  3.0  km  and  2.8  km  long  respectively,  in  Tam  Ky  and  Dong  Ha  towns  to  protect \nriverside communities from frequent river flooding. \n \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Wastewater and Public Sanitation \n\n27. \nPart C includes (i) wastewater improvement, and (ii) public sanitation. The wastewater \ncomponent is designed to collect, treat, and safely dispose of wastewater from the urban areas \nin  Thanh  Hoa  and  Lang  Co.  In  Thanh  Hoa,  it  includes  building  interceptor  chambers on the \ncombined drains, close to their discharge points, to divert flows to the interceptor sewer. It also \nincludes  6  km  of  gravity  sewers,  3  pumping  stations,  3  km  of  sewage-rising mains to remove \nwastewater from the town, and a 13,500 cubic meter (m3)/day waste stabilization pond. In Lang \nCo,  it  will  develop  a  separate  sewerage  system,  comprising  28  km  of  sewers,  3  sewage-\npumping stations, 2 km of sewage-rising mains, a 4,750m3/day wastewater treatment plant, and \na 1-km access road with an asphalt surface. The public sanitation component aims to improve \npublic health and reduce pollution in the streets, canals, waterways, and lakes in project towns. \nFor each town, it will introduce a septic tank management system; improve sanitation facilities in \npublic areas such as markets, schools, bus stations, cultural centers, parks, and health clinics; \nand supply O&M equipment for sanitation. \n \n\n4. \n\nPart D: Solid Waste Management \n\n28. \nPart  D  will  improve  the  collection,  storage,  and  transport  of  municipal,  industrial  and \nmedical  solid  waste  in  the  Project  towns.  It  includes  (i)  upgrading  and  expanding  sanitary \nlandfills in Dong Ha, Ha Tinh, Quang Ngai, and Thanh Hoa and building a new landfill for Lang \nCo and Chan May towns, and Phu Loc district; (ii) upgrading 12.2 km of landfill access roads in \nfour towns and building a 1.8-km access road to the landfill in Thanh Hoa; (iii) constructing 77 \nlocal  waste  storage  stations;  and  (iv)  equipment  for  O&M  of  solid  waste  management  system \nincluding  5  bulldozers,  5  excavators,  63  new  compactor  trucks,  560  handcarts,  99  pedicarts, \nand 9,875 portable storage bins. \n \n\n5. \n\nPart E: Project Implementation Assistance and Institutional Strengthening \nProgram \n\n29. \nPart  E  includes  project  implementation  assistance  and  an  institutional  strengthening \nprogram (ISP) for TPCs, URENCOs, MOC\u2019s department of urban infrastructure, and town-level \nwomen\u2019s  unions.  The  project  implementation  assistance  program  includes  (i)  design  and \nconstruction supervision of urban infrastructure, social, gender, environmental, and resettlement \naspects, as well as training and support for the project coordination unit (PCU) and PMUs; (ii) \nengineering and environmental surveys; and (iii) incremental administration support for allowances, \nvehicles, computers, and office equipment for PCU, PMUs, and town-level women\u2019s unions. \n \n30. \nThe  ISP  includes  (i)  training  for  TPCs  on  urban  management  and  planning,  as  well  as \nservice  contract  preparation  and  supervision;  (ii)  training  for  URENCOs  on  management \n\n\f7 \n\ninformation  systems,  asset  management  systems,  administrative  and  financial  management, \nsocial  and  gender  issues,  O&M  for  project  works,  planning,  budgeting,  communication \ntechniques,  bookkeeping,  accounting  and  reporting;  (iii) technical  support  and  on-the-job \ntraining  to  MOC\u2019s  department  of  urban  infrastructure  on  preparing  guidelines  on  urban \nmanagement for provincial towns, and guidelines on drainage, sanitation, and solid waste tariffs, \nand organizing national workshops on urban management and financing; (iv)  training in public \nhealth  awareness,  community-based  sanitation,  and  a  household  sanitation  program  for  each \ntown\u2019s women\u2019s union, including coordinating, financial, and management opportunities; and (v) \ncomputer hardware and software for URENCOs.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n31. \nPoverty.  The  Project  has  been  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention  strategy,  and  will \ncontribute  to  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth \nStrategy 2001\u20132010. The urban poor in project towns live in underserved areas where drainage \nis dysfunctional or nonexistent, flooding is frequent, access to solid waste collection is limited, \nsanitation is inadequate, and the environment is polluted because of poor toilet and septic tank \nfacilities.  About  21.2%  of  project  beneficiaries  are  poor.  Poverty  rates  in  the  six  project  towns \nare higher than the national urban average of 11.1% while poverty levels in the rural area of Phu \nLoc  district  is  higher  than  the  national  average.  About  16.3%  of  the  urban  population  in  the \nproject towns and about 40% of the residents in  Chan May town and Phu Loc district are poor. \nThe  Project  will  develop  and  expand  urban  services  to  poor  and  low-income  households, \ngenerate  new  employment  opportunities,  develop  community  ownership  and  self-reliance, \nreduce  the  risk  of  disease  through  health  awareness  programs,  and  ensure  a  sustainable \nenvironment.  The Project  will  directly  address  one  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  and \nTargets  (MDGTs)  referring  to  sanitation  improvements,  and will  contribute  to  achieving  other \nMDGTs  by  improving  health  of  the  local  population  and  reducing  poverty  and  vulnerability.  A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 4. A poverty and social \nanalysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nGender. The issue of gender has received special attention during project preparation. \n32. \nWomen  are  responsible  for  a  variety  of  tasks  relating  to  sanitation  and  waste  collection  at  the \ncommunity  and  household  levels.  More  than  half  of  the  URENCO  staff  in  project  towns \nemployed  as  sweepers  and  waste  collectors  are  women.  Scavengers,  collecting  waste  in  the \nlandfill  sites,  are  mostly  women.  By  occupying  low-level jobs in institutions and communities, \nmost  women  lack  opportunities  or  capacity  to  hold  managerial  positions.  Females  tend  to  be \nunderrepresented in decision-making positions, despite having a large membership base in the \nwomen\u2019s union. The Project builds on the past experiences of the women\u2019s unions in previous \nADB-funded  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects.  Through  part  A,  the  Project  will  (i)  provide \ninstitutional  capacity  building  for  the  Women\u2019s  Union  to  ensure  effective  implementation;  (ii) \noffer  coordinating,  financial,  and  management  opportunities  for  the  Women\u2019s  Union;  (iii) \nincrease  access  to  female  beneficiaries  of  poor  and  low-income  households;  (iv)  make \nprovisions for increased gender awareness and representation within URENCO; and (v) work to \nenhance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. A summary gender  analysis and action \nplan  is  presented  in  Appendix  5  and  a  comprehensive  gender  analysis  and  action  plan  is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary Resettlement. The Project will involve land acquisition and resettlement of \npeople and businesses. It will require acquisition of 138 hectares of land, of which 110 hectares \nis agricultural land that will be lost because of improvements in drainage and flood protection, \nwastewater  and  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  infrastructure.  A  total  of  2,337  households \n(approximately 10,571 people), including shops and businesses, will be affected, of which 1,100 \nhouseholds,  including  shops  and  businesses,  will  be  severely  affected.  The  remaining  1,237 \nhouseholds  will  be  marginally  affected.  The  cost  of  resettlement  of  people  affected  by  the \n\n\f8 \n\nProject  is  estimated  at  $7.7  million,  including  implementation  costs  and  contingencies.  The \nimpact is significant due to the construction of landfill sites, wastewater treatment plants, dike-\nroads,  and  flood-regulating basins.  Community-based sanitation programs may require some \nland acquisition for the construction of drains, footpaths, or solid waste collection units.  \n \n34. \nEfforts  have  been  made  to  avoid  and,  where  possible,  minimize  the  level  of  impact. \nAffected people will be compensated for their losses at full replacement cost, and provided with \ntransition allowances and rehabilitation measures. Priority consideration will be given to affected \npeople  who  participate  in  community  and  household  sanitation  programs  under  part  A. \nAdditional support has been included for the poor, vulnerable, and female-headed households. \nA full resettlement plan for each of the project towns has been prepared based on inventory of \nlosses and socioeconomic surveys, including focus-group discussions with affected people and \nlocal  authorities.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  any  unforeseen  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  planning  during  project  implementation.  A  summary  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  is  presented  in  Appendix  6.  Resettlement  plans  for  each  project \ntown and an overall resettlement framework are presented in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n35. \nEnvironment. The Project is classified as environment category B. The Project will not \nresult  in  any  serious  negative  environmental  impacts  because  proposed  project  activities  are \ndesigned to improve the quality of life and physical environment of the urban population, and the \nadverse environmental impacts arising from the design, construction, and operation of proposed \nactivities will be temporary, minor, localized, and can be minimized to acceptable levels through \nmitigation measures and monitoring programs identified in an initial environmental examination \n(IEE). No project activities will be located close to or within designated environmentally sensitive \nareas such as national parks or natural resource conservation reserves. Each project town has \nprepared an IEE, including an environmental management plan (EMP), with the support of the \nconsultants,  which  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  environmental  authorities \nconcerned. PMUs and the departments of natural resources and environment (DNREs) in each \nprovince will regularly monitor all construction activities. Water-quality monitoring will be carried \nout  for  all  sewerage  treatment  plants  and  the  landfill  works  by  designated  environmental \nmonitoring  laboratories  at  the  provincial  level.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for \nenvironmental  assessment,  as  well  as  government  regulations  on  environmental  impact \nassessment,  an  updated  IEE  for  each  project  town  will  be  submitted  to  the  DNRE  of  each \nprovince and to ADB before civil works begin.   \n \n36. \nTo ensure that all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, regulations, and \nstandards\u2014as  well  as  ADB  environmental  requirements\u2014will  be  met  during  design, \nconstruction,  and  operation,  an  EMP  for  each  project  town  has  been  prepared  and  will  be \ncarried out by the PMU at the provincial level, in collaboration with the DNRE concerned. During \nproject  preparation,  local  people  have  been  informed  about  potential  negative  environmental \nimpacts and mitigation measures included in the EMP, and the IEEs have been translated into \nVietnamese.  The  PPC  of  each  project  province  has  assured  ADB  that  mitigation measures \nidentified in the IEE will be incorporated into design, construction, and operation of subprojects. \nEnvironmental  measures  requiring  action  from  contractors  will  be  incorporated  in  civil  works \ncontracts. Implementation of proposed environmental mitigation measures will be monitored by \nthe  PMUs  with  the  support  of  DNREs.  Monitoring  results  will  be  reported  to  the  PCU,  MOC, \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment, and ADB through semiannual progress reports \non project implementation and annual reports on environmental monitoring.   \n \n37. \nTo ensure that the IEE and EMP can be successfully implemented in each project town, at \nleast  one  environment  specialist  will  be  placed  at  each  PMU.  An  environmental  capacity-building \ncomponent to the PCU and the PMUs has been included. An appropriate budget has been included to \nimplement proposed mitigation measures as well as capacity-building activities identified in the EMP. \n\n\f9 \n\nA  summary  IEE  is  presented  in  Appendix  7.  A  summary  EMP  is  presented  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F, and IEEs for each project town are presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n38. \nCommunity Participation.  All project components were formulated after discussions with \nconcerned government officials and consultations with affected communities and beneficiaries. The \nProject is designed so that it is responsive to the communities' needs, will function on a sustainable \nbasis, and will have no adverse social or environmental impacts. The Project will promote grassroots \nparticipation  in  urban  infrastructure  planning  and  environmental  improvements  by  providing \ncommunity groups with (i) adequate information about community and household sanitation programs; \n(ii) sufficient opportunities to participate during project preparation, implementation, maintenance, and \noperations; and (iii) concerted capacity building for poor and low -income communities in developing \nownership and self-reliance. The scope of part A was tightened as a result of clear identification of the \nprimary  stakeholders,  and  extensive  consultation  with  project  beneficiaries  through  participatory \napproaches.  Subsequent  mechanisms  to  increase  community  participation  will  enable  community \ngroups and individual households to set their own priorities for urban environmental improvements, \nand to utilize and manage sanitation and solid waste subcomponents based on collective resources \nand contributions. Results of participation with affected people illustrate different community dynamics \nand reactions to resettlement as reflected in resettlement plans. Consultation with local communities \non environmental issues has been incorporated into the IEEs and EMP.  \n \n39. \nStrengthening  of  Urban  Policies  and  Institutions.  The  Project  will  improve  the \nefficiency and sustainability of urban services in project towns by improving the institutional and \noperational framework for urban management and delivery of urban environmental services. At \nthe national level, the Project will support MOC to prepare guidelines on urban management, as \nwell as guidelines on drainage, sanitation, and solid waste tariffs.  At the town level, the Project \nwill  support  the  urban  management  divisions  of  the  TPCs  to  improve  their  capacities  in  urban \nplanning and management, and to become efficient units able to monitor the quality and level of \nservices delivered by URENCOs and other public or private service providers. \n \n40. \nThe Project will support the transformation of URENCOs into autonomous and efficient \ncompanies, accountable to the TPCs and their clients. The Project will promote institutional and \nlegal reforms at the provincial level and provide technical support to URENCOs to allow them to \n(i)  establish  accounting  systems  and  separate  budgets  and  accounts  following  Vietnamese \nAccounting Standards for each of their main activities, distinguishing between (a) drainage and \nwastewater,  (b)  solid  waste  management,  (c)  other  O&M  activities,  and  (d)  new  construction \nactivities; (ii) change the focus of URENCOs to management and O&M of urban infrastructure \nby  progressively  separating  construction  units;  (iii)  calculate,  recommend,  and \njustify \nappropriate fees for drainage, wastewater, and solid waste to clients and people\u2019s councils, and \nagree on appropriate service levels with TPCs; (iv) own equipment for O&M and keep sufficient \nfunds  for  depreciation  of  equipment  and  repayment  of  loans;  (v) collect  drainage  and  solid \nwaste fees, retaining all revenues in two separate accounts and using them solely for O&M of \nthe solid waste and drainage and wastewater facilities, respectively, under the responsibility of a \nURENCO;  (vi)  impose  penalties  on  people  who  do  not  pay  for  services  received,  or  destroy \nurban  infrastructure  under  their  responsibility; (vii)  adopt  and  implement  efficient  and  effective \nasset management procedures; (viii) prepare and adopt O&M plans, manuals, and procedures; \nand (ix) implement efficient financial and management information systems. \n \n41. \nImproved Financial Sustainability of Urban Environmental Services. The Project will \nsupport  Government  policy  by  helping  URENCOs  generate  more  revenue  from  their  own \nsources,  and  gradually  reduce  Government  subsidies.  Tariffs  will  be  increased  so  that \nURENCOs  can  collect  enough  resources  to  pay  all  O&M  costs  and  depreciation  of  O&M \nequipment for drainage, wastewater, and solid waste management. Recommended tariffs have \nbeen calculated so they are affordable to low-income and poor people. Water supply companies \nin  each  province  will  collect  charges  for  drainage  and  wastewater  services  on  behalf  of the \n\n\f10 \n\nURENCO as a surcharge on the water tariff, then transfer the revenue to a dedicated account in \nURENCO.  A  new  environmental  fee  or  a  surcharge  on  the  land  and  property  tax,  which  will \napply  to  all  households  and  organizations  in  the  town,  will  be  levied  directly  by  the  TPC  to \nfinance capital investments in urban environmental infrastructure. The URENCO will continue to \ncollect  charges  for  solid  waste  services  directly  from  customers  and  will  progressively  increase \nthose  charges.  The  URENCO  will  sign  service  contracts  with  the  TPC  for  the  O&M  of  urban \ninfrastructure, which will include payments from the TPC to the URENCO for providing services to \nthe  town  without  a  direct  cost  recovery  mechanism,  such  as  street  lights,  road  cleaning,  parks, \ngreen areas, and cemeteries. The TPC will also continue payments to the URENCO for drainage, \nwastewater, and solid waste systems until the URENCO has reached full cost recovery through \ndirect charges. All fees and payments from the TPC to the URENCO will be based on proper O&M \nand service levels, agreed between the TPC, URENCO, and users of the service. \n \nFocus  on  the  Central  Region. To avoid the destabilizing effect of significant migration to \n42. \nHanoi and HCMC, Viet Nam needs to develop a network of provincial and district towns in the central \nregion that can provide economic opportunity and quality of life for a population gradually released \nfrom farming. The Project will support ADB\u2019s overall strategy, as noted in the CSP, of focusing a \nsignificant part of its interventions on the central region. It will complement other ongoing and future \nADB interventions in the central region to ensure more balanced regional economic development. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, duties, taxes, and interest \n43. \nduring construction, is estimated at $96.0 million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost is $53.6 million \nequivalent, or 55.8% of total. The local currency cost, including duties and taxes, is $42.4 million \nequivalent, or 44.2% of total. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. Cost estimates for each \ntown are presented in Appendix 8 with further details in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n44. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $44.0  million  equivalent  from  its  Special Funds \nresources to cover 45.8% of the total project cost. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. It will bear an interest rate of 1% during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter. The  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) will provide two loans for a total \nof  of 30 million euros ($31.8 million equivalent) for joint financing of under parts B, C, and E of the \nProject.  The  proposed  AFD  loans  have  two  components:  a  normal  loan  (or PS1) of $26.5 million \nequivalent  for  physical  works,  and  a  concessional  loan  (or  PTC)  of  $5.3 million  equivalent  for \ncapacity strengthening. The PS1 loan will have a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 7 years, \nand an interest rate of 2.5% for the entire term of the loan. The PTC loan will have a maturity of 30 \nyears, with a grace period of 10 years and an interest rate of 1% for the entire term of the loan. The \nremaining  $20.2  million,  equivalent  to  21.1%  of  the  total  project  cost,  is  the  local  counterpart \ncontribution financed by the PPCs and beneficiaries.6 The financing plan is summarized in Table 2 \nand detailed financing plans for each project town are presented in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n45. \nThe  Borrower  of  proposed  ADB  and  AFD  loans  will be the Government of Viet Nam. The \nloans will finance the entire foreign exchange cost and part of the local currency cost. Part of the loan \nfrom  ADB  will  be  onlent  by  the  Government  to  URENCOs7  through  subsidiary  loans  in  domestic \ncurrency to cover the cost of O&M equipment for drainage and flood protection, waste water and \npublic sanitation, and solid waste components. The remaining part of the ADB loan and the entire AFD \n\n                                                 \n6   The beneficiaries of  community-based sanitation subcomponent under part A of the Project will contribute 20% of \n\nthe cost. \n\n7   The PPCs will act as guarantors of the subsidiary loans from the Government to URENCOs. The total loan amount \nto  be  onlent  to  the  URENCOs  is  estimated  at  $12.5  million  equivalent  (Ha  Tinh,  $1.6  million;  Quang  Nam,  $2.0 \nmillion;  Quang  Ngai,  $2.2  million;  Quang  Tri,  $1.5  million;  Thanh  Hoa,  $2.7  million;  and  Thua  Thien  Hue,  $2.3 \nmillion) \n\n\floan will be provided to PPCs as grants. The subsidiary loans to URENCOs will have maturities of 20 \nyears,  grace  periods  of  6  years,  and  fixed  interest  rates  at  5.4%.  The  PMUs  will  provide  a \ncombination of loans and grants to women\u2019s unions for the HSP subcomponent. \n\n11 \n\n Table 1: Project Cost Summary \n\n($ million) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nComponent \nA.

Each PPC has set up a \n46. \nprovincial  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  which  will  have  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation  and  policy  guidance.  The  PSCs  comprise  senior  officials  from  the  PPCs, \nprovincial  departments  of  construction,  departments  of  finance,  departments  of  planning  and \ninvestment, DNREs, TPCs, women\u2019s unions, URENCOs, and the project director. The PSC will \nprovide  policy  guidance,  and  coordinate  provincial  agencies  to  ensure  quality  and  timely \nimplementation. Each PPC has established a PMU with full-time professional staff in each TPC, \nexcept Thua Thien Hue and Quang Ngai provinces, where PMUs have been established in the \ndepartment  of  construction  of  the  PPC  and the URENCO, respectively. The PMU will support \nthe PSC and will be responsible for daily implementation. The PMU will comprise staff from the \nTPC,  URENCO,  and  other  provincial,  town,  or  district-level agencies, with expertise in project \nmanagement,  drainage,  sanitary  engineering,  environmental  management,  accounting, \ncommunity education, and development. \n \n47. \nFor overall project coordination at the national level, a project advisory committee (PAC) \nwill be established, if necessary. The PAC will be convened, if requested by any of its members, \nto  discuss  common  problems  affecting  implementation,  and  exchange  policy,  technical,  and \nfinancial  lessons  learnt.    It  will  consist  of  one  senior  official  from  MOC  as  chairperson  and \npersonnel  from  the  six  project  provinces  as  members.  The  PAC  may  invite  other  relevant \nministries, ADB, or AFD staff to participate as observers. A project coordination unit (PCU) has \nbeen  established  in  MOC  comprising  full-time  and  part-time  professional  staff  with  adequate \nproject experience and proficiency in English language. The PCU will act as a secretariat to the \nPAC and will be responsible for overall coordination of the Project; selection and management \nof consultants; handling of audited statements of project accounts; and consolidation of project \nreports  to  be  submitted  to  ADB,  AFD,  and  the  Government.  Other  PCU  functions  include (i) \ndeveloping  a  common  accounting  software  for  the  PPCs,  (ii)  disseminating  information  on \ndisbursement  and  withdrawal  guidelines  to  PPCs  and  training  staff  in  their  use,  (iii)  keeping \ncentralized  registration  of  withdrawal  applications  and  auditing,  (iv)  ensuring  compliance  with \nloan  covenants,  and  (v)  monitoring  and  evaluating  project  performance  to  ensure  that  the \nobjectives are being met. \n \nA community management committee (CMC), chaired by a senior member of the town\u2019s \n48. \nwomen\u2019s union, will be established in each province for overall managing and implementing of \npart A. The CMC will include representatives of the URENCO, TPC, and women\u2019s union. Other \nmass  organizations  could  also  be  invited  to  participate  in  the  CMC  on  an  ad-hoc basis. The \nwomen\u2019s union in each town will be responsible for daily implementation activities under part A. \nThe project management mechanism is presented in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n\f13 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n49. \nThe Project will be implemented during 5.5 years until 30 June 2009. This is reasonable, \nbased on the proposed size of individual subprojects and the commitment and interest shown \nby all implementing agencies.  An implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n50. \nGoods and works to be financed by ADB and AFD will be procured in accordance with \nADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  will be \nused  for  major  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  over  $2.0  million  and  supply  contracts \nvalued  over  $500,000.  Procurement  of  minor  civil  works  and  equipment  will  be  undertaken \nthrough  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nInternational  shopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for  materials  and  equipment  packages \nestimated to cost more than $100,000 equivalent but less than $500,000 equivalent. Equipment \nthat  is  locally  available,  and  costs  less  than  $100,000  equivalent,  may  be  procured  through \ndirect  purchase  in  accordance  with  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB.  For the CBS component \nunder  part  A,  where  most  subprojects  will  be  relatively  small,  and  scattered  throughout  the \ntowns,  the  Project  will  consider  funding  suitable  nongovernmental  organizations  or  mass \norganizations  to  work  in  a  collaborative  and  participatory  manner  with  local  communities \nfollowing ADB\u2019s community participation guide. \n \n51. \nThe  ICB  contracts  are  expected  to  include  separate  contracts  in  each  province  for \n(i) building drainage, flood protection, and wastewater works; (ii) O&M equipment for solid waste \nmanagement;  and  (iii)  O&M  equipment  for  drainage  and  sanitation.  The  LCB  contracts  are \nexpected  to  include  (i)  separate  contracts  in  each  province  for  building  landfills,  solid  waste \nstorage stations, repair workshops, and landfill access roads; and (ii) separate LCB contracts in \neach  province  for  building  drainage  and  public  sanitation  facilities.  Force  accounts  (i.e.,  for \nURENCO\u2019s  staff  and  resources)  will  be  used  to  clean  and  rehabilitate  drains.  Indicative \nprocurement packaging is presented in Appendix 11. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nTo support project implementation, a total of 1,220 person-months of consulting services \n52. \n(116  person-months  international  and  1,104  person-months  domestic)  will  be  required  for \nproject  management,  resettlement,  gender,  and  environmental  aspects,  as  well  as  design  and \nconstruction  supervision  of  urban  infrastructure.  In  addition,  consultants  will  support  the \ninstitutional  strengthening  program  through  the  preparation  and  delivery  of  on-the-job training \nand capacity building programs for TPCs\u2019 urban management divisions, URENCOs, CMCs, and \nwomen\u2019s  unions  on  urban  management;  service  contract  preparation  and  supervision;  an \nengineering,  accounting,  and  management  awareness  program;  community-based sanitation; \nand  a  household  sanitation  program. Consultants will also support  MOC\u2019s urban infrastructure \ndepartment  in  preparing  guidelines  on  institutional  aspects of urban management of provincial \ntowns, and guidelines on drainage, sanitation, and solid waste tariffs. \n \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n53. \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. For \npurposes  of  expediency,  standardization,  and  cost  effectiveness,  the  PCU  will  be  responsible \nfor recruiting and managing the consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method. \nAn  international  consulting  firm,  in  association  with  domestic  consultants,  will  provide  the \nconsulting services. An outline of the terms of reference for consulting services is presented in \nAppendix  12.  Detailed \nin \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n\nfor  consulting  services  are  presented \n\nterms  of  reference \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n54. \nPayment  of  eligible  expenditures  from  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  of  January  2001.  To  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan \nproceeds, and to expedite project implementation, the PCU will open and maintain  an imprest \naccount  immediately  upon  loan  effectiveness  for  the  administrative  expenditures  of  the  PCU. \nThe administrative expenditures of the PCU not paid by the ADB loan, such as taxes and duties \non equipment, will be shared by PPCs as part of their counterpart fund contributions. Each PMU \nwill also set up an imprest account at the provincial level for disbursing eligible funds relating to \nsmall  contracts  under  local  competitive  bidding,  direct  purchase,  international  shopping, \ncommunity-based  sanitation,  and  incremental  administrative  expenses.  The  PCU  and  each \nPMU  will  set  up  imprest  accounts  with  commercial  banks  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  be \nresponsible for the use, management, replenishment, and liquidation of the imprest account. \n \n55. \nThe  initial  deposit  to  the  imprest  accounts  will  be  based  on  estimated  expenditures  for \nthe first 6 months of project implementation, to be prepared by the PCU and each PMU, but will \nnot  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  for  each  imprest  account.  Withdrawal  applications, \nincluding imprest account replenishment requests, will be prepared by the PCU and PMUs and \nsent to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for approval. MOF will forward the approved applications \nto  ADB  and AFD, with a copy to the PCU.  ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures \nmay  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  advances  to  the  imprest \naccount. The ceiling on the SOE is $100,000 per payment.  Funds for the household sanitation \nprogram will be disbursed through PMUs\u2019 imprest accounts to the town-level women\u2019s unions.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n56. \nPMUs,  with  assistance  from  consultants,  will  set  up  project  accounts  according  to \ngovernment regulations. The consultants will provide training and operating support to the PCU \nand  PMUs\u2019  accounting  staff  on  the  use  of  these  accounts  during  the  initial  stage  of  project \nimplementation.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  examine  the  project  accounts,  including  the \nimprest  accounts  and  financial  statements  of  the  URENCOs.  The  PMUs  will  prepare  the \nrequired  information  for  audit  in  accordance  with  project  auditing  requirements  of  the \nGovernment and ADB. Auditing of the project accounts and financial statements of URENCOs \nwill  be  carried  out  annually,  and  audited  statements  of  project  accounts  and  URENCOs\u2019 \nfinancial statements will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the close of the Government's \nfiscal year. \n \n57. \nEach PMU will prepare quarterly project progress  reports within 30 days after the end of \nreporting  period,  then  submit  them  to  the  PCU  for  consolidation  and  reporting  to  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  reports  will  provide  a  description  of  progress  during  the  reporting \nperiod,  any  modifications  to  the  implementation  schedule,  details  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, problems and difficulties experienced, remedial actions proposed, and the work to \nbe carried out during the upcoming reporting period. The PMUs\u2019 quarterly progress reports will \ninclude  summaries  of  expenditures  during  the  quarter,  year-to-date  expenditures,  and  total \nexpenditures  to  date.  URENCOs  will  prepare  annual  financial  statements,  including  balance \nsheets,  income  statements,  and  cash  flow  statements.  A  project  completion  report  will  be \nsubmitted  by  each  PMU  to  the  PCU  for  consolidation  and  submission  to  the  Government  and \nADB  within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project.  The  project  completion  report  will \nhighlight  the  development  impacts  achieved  by  the  Project.  All  reports  and  the  associated \nfinancial accounts and data will be presented to ADB in English. \n \n\n\f15 \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n58. \nThe  PPC  in  each  province  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  a  comprehensive \nprogram for project benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) acceptable to ADB is carried out as \npart of the project performance monitoring system (PPMS) to (I) examine the Project\u2019s technical \nperformance,  (ii)  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities,  (iii)  assess  the  achievement  of \nthe Project\u2019s objectives, and (iv) measure the Project\u2019s social and economic benefits. A set of \nBME  indicators  has  been  developed  in  consultation  with  the  local  communities.  BME\u2014to be \ndeveloped  under \nthe \nmanagement information system of the PMUs and URENCOs so that monitoring of social and \neconomic  benefits  can  continue  beyond  project  implementation.  Annual  BME  reports  will  be \nprepared  by  each  PMU,  then  consolidated  by  the  PCU  and  submitted  to  ADB. The integrated \nsystem for managing, monitoring, and evaluating project benefits, social impacts, and physical \nimprovements  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  PPMS.  A  BME  framework  is  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n \n\ninstitutional  development  program\u2014will  be \n\nintegrated \n\ninto \n\nthe \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n59. \nIn addition to regular reviews, a midterm review will also be undertaken within 36 months \nof  loan  effectiveness.  This  review  will  include  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  implementation \narrangements,  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  and  the  progress  of  implementation \ncompared  with  scheduled  targets.  It  will  also  cover  the  status  of  subproject  progress  and \nimplementation, \ninstitutional \nfrom \ndevelopment  components,  and  possible  reallocation  of \nloan  proceeds.  Cost-recovery \nmechanisms  for  each  subproject  will  also  be  evaluated  and  remedial  action  instituted  as \nneeded. \n \n\nthe  PPMS,  performance  of  consultants, \n\nfeedback \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nSocial and Gender Impacts \n\n60. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  a  total  of  504,000  people  in  the  six  project  towns,  of \nwhich  50%  are  women.  Rural  population  in  the  areas  around  these  towns  will  also  indirectly \nbenefit.  Reduced  migration  to  Hanoi  and  HCMC  because  of  improved  quality  of  life  in  the \nproject  area  will  reduce  pressure  on  Hanoi\u2019s  and  HCMC\u2019s  urban  systems.  Improvements  to \nurban  environmental  infrastructure  will  bring  about  increased  social  benefits  to  local  residents \nand  communities  and  to  the  urban  development  sector  in  general.  Inadequate  infrastructure \nsystems  pose  serious  environmental  and  health  risks,  and  inhibit  social  and  economic \ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  aim  to  reduce  environment-related  diseases,  lower  medical \nexpenses, and lessen the impact of flooding on household incomes from lost working days and \nhousehold  damages.  For  the  poor  and  low-income communities, the impact will be the most \nvisible.  Many  reside  in  low-lying,  flood-prone  areas  where  improving  drainage,  sanitation,  and \nsolid waste systems are pivotal to improved health and hygiene.  \n \nOther social and gender  benefits include increased community participation by the poor \n61. \nand  women  and  enhanced  self-reliance  in  urban  environmental  management.  Women  are \nresponsible for a variety of tasks relating to sanitation at both the family and community levels, \nespecially  as  sweepers  and  waste  collectors  employed  by  a  URENCO.  Increasing  the  role  of \nwomen  in  urban  management  and  institutions  will  (i)  improve  sanitation  and  public  health \npractices,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  women  to  hold  managerial  positions  and  take \nownership for small-scale urban environmental improvements within their communities. Through \ndemand-based  interventions,  upgrading  a  small  fishing  village  in  Lang  Co  will  have  significant \nsocial and economic benefits, including the potential to participate in the tourism industry. \n\n\f16 \n\n \nB.  \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n62. \nThe  economic  analysis  has  been  undertaken  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects  (1997) and ADB\u2019s  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial \nAppraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects  (1994).  The  analysis  comprises  least-cost \nanalyses  of  alternative  options  for  all  project  components  and  a  cost-benefit  analysis  for  the \ndrainage component in each town.  The major economic benefits arise from reduced incidence \nand  severity  of  flooding.  These  have  been  quantified  in  terms  of  resource  cost  savings  from \navoided  (i)  damage  to  property;  (ii)  cleanup  costs  after  flooding;  (iii)  time  lost  due  to  travel \ndelays;  (iv)  lost  employment  opportunities;  (v) loss of business income; (vi)  medical costs and \npublic  health  expenditure  related  to  waterborne  diseases;  and  (vii)  expenditure  on  the \nmaintenance  for  roads,  drains,  and  other  municipal  infrastructure  damaged  by  floods. \nNonquantifiable  benefits  include  reduced  threat  of  disruption  to  social  activities  and  stress \ncaused by such events to the urban communities. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \ncalculated  for  each  town  ranges  from  16.4%  to  21.1%.  The  sensitivities  of  the  EIRRs  of  the \ndrainage and flood protection components are tested against adverse changes in key variables. \nThe  result  of  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  is  most  sensitive  to  delays  in  project \ncompletion. However, all EIRRs exceed 12%. The economic analysis is presented in Appendix \n13; details are available in Supplementary Appendix L.   \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n63. \nFinancial  analyses  were  conducted  to  determine  the  financial  viability  of  the  selected \ncomponents and the sustainability of the six URENCOs. In addition, a financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) is calculated for the solid waste management component in each town. For the \ndrainage  and  flood  protection  component,  the  Project  aims  to  directly  recover,  via  water  tariff \nsurcharge,  the  full  O&M  cost,  including  the  capital  cost  of  the  equipment for O&M purposes. \nAdditionally,  an  environmental  fee  or  a  surcharge  on  the  land  and  house  tax  will  be  levied  by \neach TPC or PPC to recover an appropriate portion of capital costs.8 In 2004, all project towns \nwill  implement  a  10%  surcharge  on  the  water  bill,  increase  it  to  20%  in  2006,  and  increase  it \nfurther to the level required for recovering the full O&M cost of the services in 2007.  \n \nFor  solid  waste  management  systems,  the  Project  aims  for  full  cost  recovery.9  To \n64. \nachieve this target, all project towns will apply a differentiated user fee for domestic, commercial \nand  institutional,  and  industrial  users  starting  from  2007.  All  project  towns  will  increase  the \ncurrent solid waste user fee by 30% in 2004 and further 20% in 2006. The FIRRs calculated for \nthe  solid  waste  component  range  from  7.2%  to  10.6%,  all  above  the  estimated  weighted \naverage cost of capital of 4.0% for the Project.  \n \n65. \nAffordability  analyses  have  been  undertaken  to  ensure  that  the  service  users, \nparticularly the poor, can afford water surcharges for drainage and wastewater service and user \nfees for solid waste management. These fees were found affordable.  The financial projections \nprepared  for  the  six  URENCOs  indicate  that  financial  performance  improves  over  the  2004\u2013\n2014 forecast period as drainage/wastewater tariffs are applied and solid waste tariff increases \nare  implemented.  The  Government\u2019s  budget  support  to  the  services  will  be  gradually  reduced \nand finally eliminated in year 2007. The financial analysis is presented in Appendix 14; details \nare available in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n                                                 \n8   Consulting  services  are  provided  during  implementation  to  analyze  the  appropriate  structure  and  level  of  the \n\nenvironmental fees. \n\n9   Landfill sites will be owned by the PPCs and, therefore, the capital cost related to the landfill site cons truction is not \n\nincluded in the financial analysis. This can be considered as a transparent subsidy of the government. \n\n\f17 \n\nD. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n66. \nThe  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i)  limited  human  resources  and \ncapacities of TPCs, URENCOs, and women\u2019s unions; (ii) uncertainty regarding tariff increases \nnecessary to ensure sustainability of urban services; (iii) insufficient community participation in \nproject  implementation,  particularly  from  women  and  the  poor;  (iv) poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds negatively affected by resettlement; (v) delays caused by PMUs' lack of experience \nin  managing  ADB-funded  projects;  and  (vi)  lack  of  local  government  ownership  of  sanitation \nfacilities. \n \n67. \nThe  Project  incorporates  measures  to  mitigate  these  risks.  They  include  (i)  institutional \nstrengthening  for  TPCs,  URENCOs,  and  women\u2019s  unions  to  increase  their  managerial  and \noperational  capacities;  (ii)  a  detailed, \nfor  urban \nenvironmental  services,  affordable  to  all  citizens  and  agreed  to  by  PPCs;  (iii)  a  participation \nprogram  and  gender  action  plan  and  public  awareness  campaigns;  (iv)  a  resettlement \nframework and resettlement plans to ensure that affected people will maintain or even improve \ntheir living standards after project completion; (v) the  PCU and consultants with experience in \nto  establish  effective  project \nimplementing  ADB-assisted  projects  will  assist  PMUs \nmanagement,  reporting,  and  bidding  procedures;  and  (vi)  local  ownership,  ensured  through \nPPCs\u2019 commitment to tariff increases and allocating revenues for O&M. \n \n\nincrease  program \n\ntime-bound \n\ntariff \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  PPCs  have  given  the \n\n68. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  the  actions  described  in  the  policy  and \ninstitutional  action  plan  (Appendix  3)  within  the  agreed  time  frame,  and  will \nadvise ADB of its progress through quarterly progress reports. \n\n(ii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  each  PPC  will  establish  a  CMC  to \noverview  part  A  of  the  Project  in  each  province.  The  PPC  will  ensure  timely \ndisbursement  of  funds  from  the  PMU  to  the  town\u2019s  women\u2019s  union  for  activities \nunder part A. \n\n(iii)  Within 18 months of loan effectiveness, the women\u2019s union in each town\u2014under \nCMC  guidance,  and  in  consultation  with  the  PMUs,  local  authorities,  and \ncommunities\u2014will  develop  an  HSP  to  provide  grants  to  low-income  and  poor \nhouseholds with conditions and eligibility criteria acceptable to ADB, which will be   \nobserved during project implementation. \n\n(iv)  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PPCs  will  introduce  regulations  on \nsanitation, requiring such measures as (a) connecting sullage drains and septic \ntanks  to  drains  in  high-  and  medium-density  areas,  and  to  drains  or  properly \ndesigned  and  constructed  soakaways  in  low-density  areas;  (b)  that  each \nhousehold  or  business  located  in  high-  and  medium-density  areas  will  have  a \nseptic  tank  that  meets  prescribed  standards;  and  (c)  that  hotels,  restaurants, \nhospitals,  and  industrial  enterprises  will  have  on-site treatment facilities to treat \ntheir wastewater. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  PPCs  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are  taken  in \naccordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  as  set  out  in  the  agreed  resettlement  plans  and \nframework.  The  policies  and  principles  outlined  in  the  resettlement  frameworks \nand individual resettlement plans will apply for compensation and resettlement of \naffected  people.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Vietnamese  laws, \nregulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  and  Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement, ADB policy will apply. \n\nPMUs in each project province will ensure that IEEs will be made available in the \nlocal  language  on  request  at  the  town  offices  before  the  project  begins.  The \nPMUs  will  update  the  subproject  IEEs  and  EMPs  following  completion  of  the \ndetailed  designs  and  after  further  consultations  with  local  communities.  The \nupdated IEEs and EMPs for the subprojects will be submitted to the DNREs and \nADB for review and approval before civil works begin. At least one environmental \nspecialist will be placed at each PMU.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  under  part  A,  PMUs  in  each  province  will \nupdate  and  revise  the  gender  action  plan,  if  necessary,  and  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Gender and Development Policy. Negative gender effects arising from the \nProject will be avoided and mitigated where possible. The gender action plan will \nbe implemented in a timely manner, and adequate resources will be allocated for \nits implementation.  \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following actions will be required prior to loan effectiveness: \n\nThe  Government  will  have  assured  ADB  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan \nagreements between the Government and AFD, and \n\nMOF  will  sign  subsidiary  loan  agreements  with  URENCOs  with  terms  and \nconditions acceptable to ADB. \n\nConditions for Loan Disbursement \n\nThe following actions will be required prior to loan disbursement to the imprest account \n\nparts  B  and  C  of  the  Project,  until  the  PPC  in  the  respective  province  (a)  has \nintroduced  water  tariff  surcharges  of  at  least  10%  on  top  of  the  water  tariffs  to \nrecover  O&M  costs,  and  (b)  ensures  that  the  funds  collected  by  the  provincial \nwater  supply  company  will  be  transferred  to  a  dedicated  account  of  each \nURENCO; and \n\npart D of the Project, until the PPC in each province has increased current solid \nwaste tariffs by at least 30% over the tariffs as of 1 July 2003 for all user groups. \n\n18 \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\n  \n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \nB. \n\n69. \n \n\n \nC. \n\n \n \n \n\n70. \nfor each PMU for \n \n(i) \n\n\fVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n19 \n\n71. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 30,731,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the  Central Region \nUrban Environmental Improvement Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n\n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n14 November 2003 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\n1.

Provincial people\u2019s committees \n(PPC) approval is required for most key \nmanagement and operating decisions, including \nthe determination of service levels, staff salary \nand benefits, major maintenance expenditures, \nand replacement of equipment for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M). Excessive dependence on \nPPCs\u2019 decisions significantly limits their capacity \nto deliver urban services efficiently based on \ncommercial principles. \n \nCurrent accounting and financial reporting \nprocedures lack transparency and are \ninadequate for operating an autonomous public \nutility company. \n \nThe involvement of URENCOs in construction \nactivities diverts the attention of management \nand em ployees from their core functions and \nresponsibilities as providers of urban \nenvironmental services and lead to conflicts of \ninterest that may result in higher costs and lower \nquality.  \n \nThe National Orientation Plan for Urban Drainage \nDevelopment recognizes the need for enhanced \nenforcement of urban environmental regulations. \nHowever, existing mechanisms for protecting \npublic urban environmental assets are \ncumbersome and ineffective.  \n\nNo.  Policy Objective  Present Situation \n \n1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAction Needed \n \nPPCs and TPCs will ensure that URENCOs will: \n \n(i) Maintain accounting s ystems and establish \nseparate budgets and accounts following \nVietnamese Accounting Standards for at least each \nof the following activities:  \n(a) drainage, sanitation, and wastewater;  \n(b) solid waste management;  \n(c) other urban services activities; and  \n(d) new construction activities. \n \n(ii) Focus its activities on management and O&M of \nurban infrastructure by establishing and maintaining \na separate unit for construction activites under the \nURENCO (except for Thua Thien Hue province, \nwhere a separate unit will be established for the \nO&M of the Lang Co system). \n \n(iii) Calculate, recommend, and justify appropriate \nfees for drainage, wastewater, and solid waste to \nclients and People\u2019s Councils, and agree on \nappropriate service levels with town people\u2019s \ncommittees (TPCs). \n \n(iv) Own equipment for O&M and keep sufficient \nfunds to cover depreciation of equipment. \n \n(v) Collect drainage fees (through the provincial \nwater supply company) and solid waste fees, retain \nall revenues in two separate accounts, and use \nthem solely for O&M of solid waste and drainage \nand wastewater facilities respectively, under their \nresponsibility. \n \n(vi) Request, and the TPC will impose penalties to \nthose who do not pay for services received and \nthose who destroy infrastructure under their \nresponsibility. \n \n(vii) Adopt and implement efficient and effective \nasset management procedures. \n\nAgencies  \n \nPPCs, TPCs, \nand URENCOs  \n\n \n\nTime Frame \n \nWithin 12 \nmonths  of loan \neffectiveness \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWithin 24 \nmonths  of loan \neffectiveness \n \n \n \n \nWithin 24 \nmonths  of loan \neffectiveness \n \n \nWithin 12 \nmonths  of loan \neffectiveness \n \nWithin 12 \nmonths  of loan \neffectiveness \n \n \nWithin 12 \nmonths  of loan \neffectiveness \n \n \nWithin 12 \nmonths  of loan \neffectiveness \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\n2\n5\n \n\n\fNo.  Policy Objective  Present Situation \n\nAgencies  \n\n \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3. \n\n \nImprove capacity \nof urban \nmanagement \ndivisions in TPCs \nto monitor \nperformance of \nURENCOs and \nother public and \nprivate service \nproviders, and to \ncoordinate \nefficiently urban \nplanning and \nmanagement \n\n \nTo strengthen \nnational urban \nmanagement and \ntariff policies to \nassist PPCs, \nTPCs, and \nURENCOs to \nachieve \nsustainable \nmanagement of \nurban \nenvironmental \ninfrastructure and \nservices. \n\n \nTPCs are responsible for the administration of \nprovincial and district towns.

A new Department for Urban \nInfrastructure was established in May 2003 that \nwill be in charge of urban management. \nHowever, the department has not yet developed \nclear guidelines for managing urban \ninfrastructure to assist provincial authorities. \nGuidelines on tariffs for urban environmental \nservices also need to be developed. \n \n \nMost URENCOs do not charge for drainage \nservices and rely on budget allocations from the \nPPCs or TPCs. Tariffs and budget allocations are \ngenerally set at levels insufficient to provide \nadequate resources to guarantee appropriate \nservice. In most cases, drainage tariffs (if applied \nat all) and solid waste charges are set well below \nmaximum levels affordable to the large majority \nof households, and well within their willingness to \npay.  \n \nCharges for drainage are recommended by  \nMOC and the Government Pricing Committee in \nCircular No.03/1999/TTLT/BXD-BVGCP to be set \nat 10% of the total water production cost or \nhigher, and to be gradually increased to cover \nO&M costs.

The  central  region\u2019s  urban  population  is  4.5  million  and  is  growing 4.5% per \nannum. In 1999, the central region accounted for 20.6% of the national population. Development in the central region \nhas suffered and urban infrastructure is unable to meet the growing demand because of insufficient funds and weak \ninstitutional arrangements. Inadequate infrastructure systems pose serious environmental and health risks and inhibit \nsocial and economic development. This has fueled the rural to urban migration: the population of Hanoi and Ho Chi \nMinh City increased about 1.5 times in the past 10 years and accounts for 40% of Viet Nam\u2019s total urban population.  \n \nThe Project will reduce flooding and improve drainage, sanitation, and solid waste systems in five provincial capitals \nand one district level town in the central region. Demand-based community awareness and pro-poor sanitation (APPS) \nprograms  will  expand  services  to  poor  and  low-income  households  and  communities  in  remote  and  underserved \nareas. The Project will improve urban infrastructure systems and service coverage so that the five provincial capitals \ncan function as sustainable regional economic centers, and the district town will be better able to develop its tourism \npotential and serve the surrounding poor fishing community. \n \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis   \n\n \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nThematic Areas: Human Development \n\n \nThe central region is one of the poorest in Viet Nam. The selected project towns experience levels of poverty where \nthe  urban  living  standard  is  poorer  than  the  national  average.  According  to  the  Viet  Nam  Living  Standard  Survey \n(VLSS),  the  national  urban  poverty  average  is  11.1%.  About  21.2%  of  the  total  beneficiaries  from  the  Project  are \nexpected  to  be  poor.  This  percentage  includes  the  total  number  of  beneficiaries  from  the  solid  waste  component  in \nLang Co that live in the Chan May urban area, Phoc Loc district, and four communes of the Phoc Loc district. There \nare  also  some  households  that  reside  just  above  the  poverty  line,  and  are  equally  susceptible  to  shocks,  poor \nsanitation, and floods, all of which weaken their human capital, especially their health. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  address  one  of  the  millennium  development  goals  and  targets  (MDGTs):  to  ensure \nenvironmental sustainability. This includes reducing the risk of disaster from floods, and further impoverishment from \npoor drainage, sanitation, and solid waste collection.  The  majority  of  the  urban  poor  work  in  unstable  and  low-paid \njobs,  where  median  household  income  ranges  from  D400,000-800,000  per  month.  The  urban-poor  reside  in \nunderserved  areas  where  drainage  is  dysfunctional  or  nonexistent,  access  to  solid  waste  collection  is  limited, \nsanitation is inadequate, and the environment is polluted due to the lack of appropriate toilet and septic tank facilities. \nThey  are  up  to  3.5  times  as  likely  to  experience  flooding  of  their  houses  than  nonpoor  households,  and  are  more \nvulnerable to shocks such as sickness due to poor sanitation or flooding. Environmental diseases have high economic \nand  social  consequences,  including  high  medical  expenses  and  lost  working  days  that  harm  incomes  and  further \nmarginalize the poor. \n \nThe Project will reduce flooding and improve drainage, sanitation, and solid waste systems.  Improvements made in \nenvironmental  management  further  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  other MDGTs. Improved sanitation and better \ndrainage reduces (i) illnesses and mortality amongst different population groups, and (ii) the associated economic and \nsocial costs. Community-based interventions will expand services to remote and underserved communities, including \nresettlement areas. Poor households will benefit from these improvements, as they cluster in areas that are low-lying \nand  poorly  serviced  by  solid  waste  collectors.  Community  awareness  and  participation  programs  will  educate  and \ninform  beneficiaries  so  that  they  are  active  participants  in  their  own  development.  Community-based sanitation \nprograms  will  strengthen  community  ownership  and  management  of  local  environmental  improvements,  and  the \nhousehold sanitation program will increase septic  tank  coverage  amongst  the  poor  and  low-income.  Poor  and  low-\nincome  households,  especially  those  engaging  in  the  community-based  sanitation  program,  will  make  special \narrangements with urban environmental companies (URENCOs) to ensure affordable services.   \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder Analysis                                                                                                                             Yes  \nParticipation strategy                                                                                                                             Yes \n \nA stakeholder analysis helped identify the key project stakeholders and their interests. Primary stakeholders include \nresidents  in  urban  wards,  resettlement-affected  people,  the  Women\u2019s  Unions,  URENCOs,  and  the  project \nmanagement unit. Secondary stakeholders include the town people\u2019s committees, mass organizations, ward people\u2019s \ncommittees, provincial people\u2019s committees, relevant line agencies, and the Ministry of Construction.   \n \nIndividual  subcomponents  for  each  project  town  were  identified  through  public  consultations,  workshops,  and \nmeetings involving extensive stakeholder participation. Decree No. 29/1998/ND-CP, reiterated in the CPRGS, calls for \nincreased  citizen  responsibilities  through  grassroots  participation  in  utilizing  and  managing  infrastructure  projects. \nPeople are (i) given adequate information about development projects; and (ii) entitled to comment on and contribute \nto  implementation,  maintenance  and  operations,  and  express  their  role  as  the  owners  of  subprojects.  APPS  will \ncontribute to this democratization by providing information, generating awareness, facilitating community participation \nand consultation with URENCOs, and encouraging local solutions through demand-driven sanitation improvements. \n \nDuring  project  design,  community  meetings  were  held  with  beneficiaries  to  discuss  flooding,  sanitation,  poverty, \nresettlement,  affordability  issues,  and  environmental  concerns.  Consultations  with  communities  and  beneficiaries \nrevealed challenges, strategies, and solutions for project design and implementation. Socioeconomic surveys obtained \ninformation  and  individual  views  on  current  situations  and  future  preferences.  Similar  surveys,  including  inventory  of \nloss surveys, were  conducted  amongst  resettlement-affected populations. Special consultations were also held with \npoor and vulnerable households, including female-headed households. Key stakeholder input and feedback in project \ndesign helped it evolve to its current state. \n \nA  community  participation  strategy  has  been  developed  to  take  into  account  the  different  levels  of  cooperation  and \ncollaboration of stakeholders. Levels of participation include information exchange, consultation, collaboration, review \nand comments on reports, and empowerment. Weekly meetings, workshops, reviews, consultation meetings, technical \nwork groups, and planning groups are the various forms of communications used to ensure active participation, project \nsupport, and productive feedback. Based on lessons  learned,  a  community  management  committee  in  each  Project \ntown  will  be  formed  to  (i)  coordinate  APPS,  (ii)  enhance  community  ownership  at  the  local  level,  and  (iii)  provide \nfinancial support for community and household sanitation improvements. The community management committee will \nhelp increase accountability and distribute responsibilities among the Women\u2019s Union, URENCO, and town people\u2019s \ncommittee in each project town. \n \n \nD.

They are responsible for a variety of \ntasks relating to sanitation in both their families and communities. Women are underrepresented in the political system \nbut have a large membership base in the Women\u2019s Union. Gender awareness and representation within URENCOs is \ncrucial: more than half of the staff is female and employed as street sweepers. Equipment for sweeping and collecting \nsolid  waste  is  unsuitable  for  women,  who  find  it  particularly difficult to use handcarts or pedicarts in poor weather. \nRecommendations  include  (i)  training  for  stakeholders  in  gender  and  development  design,  construction,  and \nimplementation;  (ii)  participation  from  and  capacity  building  at  town-level  Women\u2019s  Unions;  (iii)  special  attention  to \nwomen  in  community-based  development  activities;  (iv)  access  to  household  sanitation  programs,  especially  for \nfemale heads; (v) gender-disaggregated records of participation and awareness training; and (vi) awareness training \non  occupational  health  risks  for  female  URENCO  staff,  which  includes  providing  protective  gear  for  scavengers  at \nlandfill sites.

Tariffs have been set to reflect consumer \nwillingness  to  pay.  Other  pro-poor  initiatives,  such  as \nthe  household  sanitation  program  and  community-\nbased  sanitation  program,  adopt  approaches  that  help \npoor  and  remote  households  gain  access to sanitation \nimprovements. Where the poor are unable to contribute \ncash  for  local  community-based  sanitation,  they  are \nable  to  contribute  to  projects  in  the  form  of  labor  or \nmaterials.  Those  engaging  in  community  activities  will \nmake special service arrangements with URENCO. \n \nConstruction and operation  of  the  Project  will  generate \nemployment  opportunities  through  solid  waste  service \nexpansion and upgrading; construction of drains, roads, \ndikes  and  septic  tanks;  community  development;  and \nhealth  motivation.

In  households  where  men  are  present  but  women  serve  as  household \nheads, the women  work longer hours and are more active in their communities than their partners. FHHs \nwithout male spouses  account  for  about  8-14%  of  all  households.  The  patriarchal  system  is  strong,  and \nwith it comes a distinct gendered division of labor. Men and women are responsible for different types of \nproductive  work  that  define  their  social  roles,  while  women  are  still  responsible  for  domestic  work, \nincluding a  variety  of  tasks  relating  to  sanitation.  Poor  women  have  little  decision-making  power,  while \nwomen in middle-income families have a greater decision-making role and contribute more to household \nincome.  \n \n2. \nThe gendered division of labor within urban environmental companies (URENCOs) is clear. Men \nare  given  heavy  work  such  as  driving  garbage  trucks,  dredging  drains,  working  at  landfills,  and  staffing \nthe  funeral  division.  Women  sweep  roads,  collect  leaves,  cut  tree  branches,  or  serve  in  administrative \nroles  as  accountants,  cashiers,  or  secretaries.  About  60  scavengers,  mostly  women,  rely  on  collecting \nscrap  from  landfill  sites  to  supplement  household  incomes  of  about  D30,000  per  household  per  day. \nScavengers must pay a fee of D1,000 per day to access the Thanh Hoa landfill site. \n \n3. \nAlthough women are represented in large numbers in the Women\u2019s Unions, gender  disparities in \nleadership  and  decision-making  exist  at  all  levels  in  project  towns.  There  are  no  female  leaders  in  the \ntown  people\u2019s  committees,  and  an  estimated  1-2%  of  women  are  vice  chairpeople  of  ward  people\u2019s \ncommittees (Thanh Hoa and Dong Ha). More than half of URENCO staff is female (Thanh Hoa, Ha Tinh, \nand  Dong  Ha),  but  they  are  inadequately  represented  at  the  management  level.  Women  mainly  head \nsanitation teams or groups. Women\u2019s Unions are often the coordinating agencies for sanitation programs, \nenvironmental health campaigns, and household credit  programs in provincial towns. \n \n4. \nWidows,  divorced  women,  and  FHHs  are  more  likely  to  experience  adverse  affects  of \nresettlement because they lack access to legal property rights and ownership certificates. They are more \nvulnerable,  at  greater  risk  of  marginalization,  and  require  additional  support  in  terms  of  cash,  labor,  and \ntechnical advice.  The summary gender action plan (Table A5.1) outlines how the Project will address the \ngender needs of workers and affected communities, with a particular focus on women.  \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n5. \nThe  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  is  infused  across  all  project  components.  The  Project  will  build \nupon ongoing lessons learned from ADB\u2019s Second Provincial Town Water Supply and Sanitation Project10 \nand  similar  projects  funded  by  other  development  partners.  PMUs  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation.  A  focal  person  will  coordinate  social-inclusive  and  gender-sensitive  activities  for  each \ncomponent.  In  project  towns,  CMCs  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  APPS  component,  and  town-\nlevel  Women\u2019s  Unions  will  be  responsible  for  daily  implementation.  Women\u2019s  Unions  have  the  capacity \nand  local  knowledge  to  implement  Part  A.  The  Women\u2019s  Union  has  extensive  experience  implementing \nsanitation  and  environmental  health  awareness  campaigns,  as  well  as  donor-supported sanitation credit  \nprograms. Involvement and financial independence of Women\u2019s Unions will increase female participation \nduring  project  design,  implementation,  monitoring,  operation,  and  maintenance.  Coordinating  with  other \nCMC  members  is  essential  to  maintaining  financial  objectivity  and  sustaining  a  strong  community-based \ncomponent.  URENCO  will  comply  with  the  International  Labor  Organization\u2019s  core  labor  standards, 11  as \nwell as national laws on labor protection, safety, equal pay, and gender-sensitive equipment.  \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1997.

Training  materials  and  leaflets  will  reflect  the  distinct  needs  of  men  and \nwomen.  Access  to  information  regarding  project  components  and  tariffs  will  be \navailable  to  both  men  and  women.  Education  regarding  occupational  health  risks  for \nURENCO  workers  will  include  not  only  technical  staff  but also nontechnical staff and \nlandfill scavengers, who are predominantly women.  \nMotivators will be trained and mass organizations mobilized. About 50% of motivators \nwill be women. \nMen  and  women  will  be  consulted  to  provide  local  input  on  subcomponents  prior to \nfinalizing  the  details  of  larger  subcomponents  (e.g.  open  drains  vs.  covered  ones, \ndesign of handcarts).  \n\nThe  Women\u2019s  Union,  with  other  members  of  the  CMC,  will  evaluate  proposals \nsubmitted  by  communities  for  community-based  improvements.  Proposals  will  be \nreviewed  within  a  gender-sensitive  framework  (e.g.  toilets  constructed  shall  be \nappropriate  for  both  men  and  women).  About  30%  of  community/neighborhood  group \nmembers are women.  \nCommunities will determine their own contribution to the project through a participatory \nprocess  during  proposal  preparations.  Exemption  consideration  will  be  given  to  FHHs \nwho cannot afford to contribute in cash, labor, or kind. \nThrough  participatory  consultation  with  both  men  and  women,  communities  will \ndetermine  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  activities,  including  tariffs  for  repairs  or \nsalaries for maintenance personnel.  \nPreference will be given to women for employment generated by the subcomponent. \nCapacity  building  for  the  Women\u2019s  Union  for  effective  management  and  successful \nimplementation (e.g. training in community development activities  \nMore than 75% of beneficiaries will be women from poor and low-income households. \nFemale heads of households and widows will not be excluded from the program based \non their marital status, age, or land ownership.

Education campaigns will \nbe waged in schools, markets, restaurants, wards, and communes.  \nWomen\u2019s units within URENCOs\u2019 trade unions will (i) encourage female staff to voice \ntheir specifications on designs of handcarts, pedicarts, and other equipment; (ii) ensure \nthat labor codes and safety rules/labor protection measures are applied at work; and \n(iii) construct gender-sensitive facilities at URENCO offices such as appropriate toilets \nand changing rooms. \nThe  CMC  will  coordinate  with  town  health  offices  to  hold  meetings  with  the  local \npopulation  on  the  correlation  between  health  and  solid  waste.  In  coordination  with \nURENCO, occupational health risks awareness.  \n\nProtective clothing to URENCO staff, including landfill scavengers, will be provided. \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nProject Components  Actions Proposed \n\nPart E:  \nImplementation \nAssistance \nCapacity Building \n\nand \n\ntraining  workshops \n\nTo  organize  training  to  integrate  gender  issues  into  planning,  implementation, \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) in components during the project cycle. Specifically, \nprovide  gender  awareness  and  development \nfor  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  staff,  CMC  members,  and  Women\u2019s  Unions  on  project \nmanagement, O&M, community participation, and health awareness. \nEach  PMU,  with  the  support  of  Women\u2019s  Unions  and  a  gender  consultant,  will  build \nupon  the  gender  action  plan  and  use  gender-sensitive  indicators  for  implementation \nand monitoring. \nA  gender  consultant  will  work  closely  with  resettlement  consultants  to  ensure  the \nresettlement plan is gender responsive. Design and development of resettlement plans \nwill  include  consultations  with  both  women  and  men  about  their  needs.  Social \ninfrastructure  in  resettlement  areas  will  reflect  gender  needs,  and women\u2014especially \nsole FHHs \u2014will be eligible for comparable compensation for lost assets. \nURENCO, with the support of a gender consultant, will conduct training on leadership \nand management skills for female staff. Preference to qualified women candidates will \nbe given for management positions. \n\n \n\n \n \n6. \nInstitutional Capacity.  Gender capacity building will be provided to PMU staff. Training \non specific project subcomponents will be required for Women\u2019s Union staff, while skills training \non  specific  gender  issues  in  health,  environment,  and  sanitation  will  strengthen  existing \ncapacity.  An  international  gender  advisor  (2  person-months) and a domestic gender specialist \n(18  person-months)  will  help  refine  the  GAP  and  train  ministry  representatives,  implementing \nagencies, and other government officials. Specific responsibilities for achieving GAP goals are \nincluded in the terms of reference. \n\n7.  \nBudgets  and  Financing  Plan.  The  budget  for  GAP  activities  will  be  included  in  the \nproject  cost.  Cost  for  involving  Women\u2019s  Union  staff  in  gender  training,  participatory \nconsultation,  community  development,  and  other  activities  should  be  budgeted  adequately. \nOther  budget  items  include  costs  for  the  gender  specialists,  participant  per  diems,  materials, \nvenue rental, and refreshments. \n\n \n\n \n\n8.  \noverall project implementation schedule, as well as the specific schedules of subcomponents. \n\nImplementation Schedule.  The  implementation  schedule  for  the  GAP  will  follow  the \n \n\n \n9. \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation  The  overall  project  performance  monitoring  system \ndeveloped for the Project incorporates M&E for the GAP based on gender-sensitive indicators. \nAttention will be given to involving women beneficiaries in designing, implementing, monitoring, \nand  O&M,  using  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  indicators  to  measure  participation.  Sex-\ndisaggregated data is required and will be included in reporting. Necessary adjustments will be \nmade  during  the  project  life  to  better  meet  gender  needs  and  promote  the  empowerment  of \nwomen. PMUs will be responsible for establishing and coordinating M&E. Town-level Women\u2019s \nUnions will monitor community activities and prepare reports on the implementation of the GAP, \nand  their  reports  will  form  part  of  the  PMU  progress  report.  Within  the  URENCO  trade  union, \nwomen\u2019s units will help the Women\u2019s Unions monitor gender-related project activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\nSUMMARY OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT \n\nIntroduction \n\n  \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \nA resettlement plan for each Project town has been prepared based on an inventory of \n1. \nloss (IOL) survey, census, socioeconomic survey, and group discussions with affected people. \nThe level of impact of the main infrastructure components on land acquisition and resettlement \nhas been estimated, until detailed designs are completed during implementation. A resettlement \nframework  has  been  prepared  to  cover  impacts  missed  during  project  design  and  to  include \nimpacts  due  to  community-based  sanitation  (CBS)  in  Part  A.  For  the  resettlement  framework \nand individual resettlement plans, see Supplementary Appendix O. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nAn  estimated  total  of  138  hectares  will  be  lost  because  of  improvements  in  drainage, \nflood  protection,  wastewater,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  infrastructure.  Approximately  1,100 \nhouseholds,  including  shops  and  incomes,  will  be  severely  affected,12  and  1,237  will  be \nmarginally affected. Involuntary resettlement is most severe in or near landfill areas, wastewater \ntreatment plants, and regulating lakes. See Table A6.1. \n \n \nThe level of impact for drainage and sewerage pipes will be determined when detailed \n3. \ndesigns  are  completed  during  implementation.  The  CBS  component  may  require  minor  land \nacquisition for building drains,  footpaths, and solid waste collection units. Community proposals \nwill  be  evaluated  at  the  time  of  submission.  The  resettlement  framework  will  guide  any \nimplementation. \nunforeseen \nResettlement  plan  for  each  proposal  will  be  prepared  or  revised  for  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) approval as needed.  \n \n\nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  planning  during  project \n\nTable A6.1: Assessment of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nProject Town \n\nTotal Impact \n\nPermanent \nLand \nAcquisition \n(ha) \n\nNo. of \nSeverely \nAffected \nHHs \n\nNo. of \nMarginally \nAffected HHs \n\nThanh Hoa \nHa Tinh \n\nDong Ha \nLang Co \nTam Ky \nQuang Ngai \n\n28.43 \n32.96 \n\n10.35 \n19.79 \n22.09 \n24.43 \n\n237 \n209 \n\n71 \n184 \n259 \n140 \n\nNo. \nAffected \nHHs \n334 \n717 \n\n306 \n330 \n364 \n286 \n\nNo. \nAffected \nPeople \n1,470 \n2,796 \n\n1,499 \n1,782 \n1,565 \n1,459 \n\n97 \n508 \n\n235 \n146 \n105 \n146 \n\n \n\n2,337 \n\n1,237 \n\n138.05 \n\n10,571 \n\nTotal \n1,100 \nHa = hectares, no = number, HHs = households. \nSource: Inventories of Loss and Socioeconomic Surveys for each project town (2003). \n \nLegal Framework and Principles \n\n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  legal  framework  governing  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  framework  and \nresettlement plans is primarily based on (i) the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s 1993 Land Law (14 July \n1993, amended 2 December 1998), and Decree No. 22/1998/ND-CP (24 April 1998); (ii) ADB\u2019s Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice \n                                                 \n12  Severely affected people for this Project have been defined as (i) those who will physically be displaced and or will \nlose  more  than  50%  of  their  main  residential  or  commercial  structure,  and/or    (ii)  those  losing  more  than  20%  of \ntheir productive income-generating assets (agricultural landholdings or income sources). \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(1998);  and  (iii)  a  number  of  other  government  laws,  regulations,  and  decrees  relevant  to  land \nacquisition.13  This Project will be bound by the principles and conditions stated in the resettlement \nframework  and  resettlement  plans  for  each  project  town,  approved  by  ADB  and  the  Provincial \nPeople\u2019s Committees (PPCs). The policies and principles adopted for the Project will supersede the \nprovisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever a gap exists between ADB\u2019s \npolicy and Vietnamese law. \n \n5. \nThe 1993 Land Law is a comprehensive land administration law; it gives people access \nto  land  through  land-user  rights  similar  to  private  ownership.  Decree  No.  22  regulates \ncompensation for land recovered by the Government for defense, security, national, and public \ninterests.  The  basic  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \ninclude: \n(i) resettlement  shall  be  avoided  or  minimized  whenever  possible;  (ii)  when  unavoidable, \naffected people are entitled to compensation for their affected properties, relocation assistance, \nand rehabilitation measures to  ensure  that  affected  people  will  at  least  be  as  well-off as they \nwould have been in the absence of the project; and (iii) affected people should be fully informed \nand consulted in preparing resettlement plans. See Table A6.2. \n \nC. \n\nCompensation and Entitlements \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement \n\n6. \nThe principles and objectives ensure that all affected people are compensated in such a \nway  that  they  improve,  or  at  least  maintain,  their  pre-project  living  standards  and  earning \ncapacity.  Affected  people  identified  through  the  IOLs  are  entitled  to  compensation  or \nrehabilitation,  whether  or  not  they  have  formal  legal  land  title.  Those  who  encroach  on  the \nproposed area after the cutoff date (or completion of IOLs) are not entitled to compensation or \nrehabilitation. \n \n7. \nAll  affected  people  are  entitled  to  compensation  for  lost  assets,  incomes,  and \nbusinesses at full replacement cost and current market value, free from taxes, registration, and \nland  transfer.  Those  eligible  are  given  relocation  and  rehabilitation  allowances  so  they  can \nimprove  or  at  least  maintain  pre-project  living  standards,  incomes,  and  productive  capacity. \nCompensation for those who depend on agriculture will include land wherever possible.  \n \nD. \n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation \n\n8. \nThanh  Hoa.  The  Thanh  Hoa  subproject  will  require  12.86  hectares  of  rice  fields  for  a \nlandfill  and  another  2.96  hectares  for  an  access  road.  The  landfill  and  access  road  will  cause \napproximately 129 households to lose rice fields. The wastewater treatment plant site has been \nselected to avoid the need for relocation, but the required 11 hectares are rice fields and low-\nlying land used for fishing. Use of this land will severely affect an estimated 99 households. \n \n9. \nHa  Tinh.  Close  to  209  households will be severely affected by acquisition of land for the \nBong Son regulating basin (18 hectares), Cut River canal upgrading and riverbank protection (8.26 \nhectares),  and  landfill  (5  hectares).  Some  65  households  will  lose  structures  and  residential  land \nalong the Cut River, and 22 households will be relocated. Options to minimize relocation have been \ninvestigated,  including  the  possibility  of  re-establishing  houses  immediately  behind  their  present \nlocations. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13  Others  include:  Decree  No.  87/CP  (17  August  1993),  Decree  No.  60/CP  (5  July  1994),  Decree  No.  45/CP  (3 \nAugust  1996),  Decree  No.  64/CP  (15  September  1996),  Decree  No.  89/CP  (17  August  1994),  Decree  91/CP \n(1994), Decree No. 17/CP (4 May 2001), Circular No. 05-BXD/DT (9 February 1993), and Constitution of Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam (15 April 1992).   \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n37 \n\nTable A6.2: Resettlement Principles and Approach Applicable to the Project \n\n \n\nPrinciple \n\nApproach \n\n1.  Land \n\nacquisition \n\nand \nresettlement \n\ninvoluntary \nshould be minimized. \n\n2.  Plans  should  be  prepared \ncompensation, \nfor \nresettlement \nand \nrehabilitation  of  affected \npeople. \n\n3.  Community  participation  is \nassured.  Affected  people \nshould be fully informed and \nclosely \non \nresettlement \nand \ncompensation options. \n\nconsulted \n\n4.  Affected  people  will  receive \nfor  all \nfair  compensation \nlosses, including assets and \nlivelihoods. \n\n5.  Resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation  is  to  be  an \nintegral  part  of  subproject \ndesign. \n\n6.  Special  measures  will  be \nincluded  in  the  resettlement \nplan  to  protect  socially  and \neconomically \nvulnerable \ngroups.  \n\n7.  Affected  people  to  receive \nadequate \nin \nobtaining  replacement  land \nand livelihood restoration \n\nsupport \n\n8.  There  shall  be  effective \ngrievance procedures.  \n9.  The  Government  and  ADB \nwill  monitor  implementation \nof the resettlement plan. \n\nThis was achieved by examining alternative locations, alignments, or variations \nin right-of-way widths to ensure that people are affected only when it is vital to \nthe successful project implementation. \nSocioeconomic surveys for 25% of affected people and IOL surveys of 100% of \naffected  people  were  conducted.  Affected  people  were  identified,  and  their \nland,  buildings,  and  other  assets  have  been  enumerated.  A  resettlement  plan \nfor  each  project  town  has  been  prepared  and  will  be  revised  after  the \ncompletion  of  detailed  civil  works  designs, and detailed measurement surveys \n(DMS). \nDuring  the  IOL  surveys,  meetings  were  held  at  the  province,  town,  ward, and \ncommune  levels,  as  well  as  with  officials,  residents,  and  affected  people,  to \ninform  them  of  the  Project.  Through  a  socioeconomic  survey  and  group \nmeetings,  affected  people  consulted  about  impacts,  relocation  needs,  and \nentitlements.  Further  community  participation  and  consultation  will  be \nconducted through resettlement committees during and following completion of \nthe DMS, and prior to implementation of the resettlement plans. Affected people \nwill receive information about the project and entitlements prior to finalizing the \nresettlement  plan  for  each  project  town.  The  PPC  will  conduct  a  public \ninformation  campaign,  and  stakeholders  will  receive  a  project  information \nbooklet  outlining  resettlement  principles,  procedures,  compensation  options, \nentitlem ents of affected people, implementing organizations, public consultation \nmechanisms, and grievance procedures.  \nAll affected people who have been identified in the project-impacted areas as of \nthe date of the census and IOL survey are entitled to compensation, relocation \nallowances, and rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or \nat  least  maintain  their  pre-project  living  standards,  earning  capacity,  and \nproduction levels.  \nSite  and  alignment  selection,  as  well  as  design  processes, \ninclude \nenvironmental and social impacts as major factors. Locations are being altered \nto  minimize  impacts  on  people  (land  acquisition  and  resettlement)  and \nsubproject  schedules  take  into  account  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nschedules.  Approval  to  award  civil  works  contracts  will  not  be  given  until  the \nrequired  lands   have  been  fully  acquired,  and  compensation and resettlement \nactivities are satisfactorily completed. \nVulnerable  households  such  as  FHHs ,  disabled,  children,  and  elderly  people \nwithout  support  structures  and  people  living  in  poverty  will  be  given  additional \nassistance,  as  required,  during  relocation  and  transition  periods.  The  Project \nencourages local authorities to allocate land with perm anent land use rights to \npoor and vulnerable affected people. \nResettlement areas will be developed with land, utilities, and access. New sites \nwill have the same competitive advantages as the original. Households affected \nby  land  acquisition  for  development  of  resettlement  sites  are  secondary \naffected  people  and  will  be  compensated  in  the  same  manner  as  primary \naffected people. \nMechanisms  have  been  prepared  for  hearing  and  resolving  grievances  during \nthe implementation of the resettlement plan. \nGovernment will engage an independent domestic agency acceptable to ADB \nto monitor the land acquisition and resettlement program, and to report on it to \nthe Government and ADB.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DMS =  detailed measurement surveys, FHH = female-headed households, IOL = \ninventory of loss, PPC = provincial people\u2019s committee. \n \n \n \n \n10. \nLang  Co.  The  Lang  Co  subproject  will  acquire  5  hectares  of  land  for  the  wastewater \ntreatment  plant  site  and  9  households  will  be  relocated.  One  of  four  wastewater-pumping \nstations is unavoidably located in an urban area and construction requires temporary relocation \nof 24 small traders. Construction of the landfill will relocate 1 household and severely affect 84 \nhouseholds in the area (14 hectares).  \n \n11. \nTam Ky. The Tam Ky subproject\u2019s most significant resettlement impact is from the 2.8-\nkilometer dike road for flood protection, requiring acquisition of 2 hectares of densely populated \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nresidential  land  and  relocation  of  an  estimated  75  households  and  12  shops/businesses. \nPreliminary consultation with these households indicates that they fully support the Project and \nprefer  to  move  out  of  this  polluted  and  annually  flooded  area.  Detailed  consultation  has  been \ncarried out during the preparation of the resettlement plan though IOLs, socioeconomic surveys, \nand  group  discussions.  The  proposed  diversion  canal  and  flood-regulating  basins  will  require \nacquisition of 19.75 hectares of rice and cropland. Four households will be relocated and some \n152 households will be severely affected by land loss. \n \n12. \nQuang  Ngai.  The  Quang  Ngai  subproject  involves  restoring  and  upgrading  an  ancient \nmoat in the citadel area. Proposed maintenance access roads around the moat will necessitate \nrelocating  an  estimated  21  households,  16  of  which  have  shops.  The  landfill  will  require  11 \nhectares of marginal agricultural land and the relocation of 5 households. Flood alleviation and \ndrainage works will acquire 5 hectares of agricultural land, causing relocation of 2 households \nand severely affecting the income of 102 households. \n \nE. \n\nVulnerable Groups \n\n13. \nEthnic minority groups were not found in the Project surveys. Female-headed households \n(FHHs), with or without  a male spouse present, are vulnerable to further marginalization because \nthey lack access to legal property rights or ownership certificates. Widows and divorced women are \nmore likely to experience adverse affects of resettlement. Additional support for the poor, vulnerable \ngroups, and FHHs in terms of cash, labor, and technical advice is advised. \n \nF. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n14. \nThe PPC for each project town is responsible for approving its resettlement plan, as well \nas the overall resettlement framework. A project coordination unit (PCU) will be responsible for \noverall  coordination  of  resettlement  reports  to  the  ADB.  The  project  steering  committee  (PSC) \nunder  the  PPC  will  ensure  coordination  of  provincial  agencies  involved  in  resettlement,  and \nassist  the  PPC  in  approving  compensation  rates  and  the  resettlement  budget.  The  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  in  each  Project  town  will  supervise  day-to-day  implementation  of  all \nresettlement-related  activities,  including  consultation,  detailed measurement surveys, updating \nresettlement plans, and coordinating civil works. A town/district resettlement committee/division \nwill work closely with the PMU on resettlement activities and will help make decisions on related \nissues.  Local  administrative  authorities  will  assist  the  PMU  in  the  planning  and  implementing \nresettlement-related activities Local mass organizations will mobilize affected people to actively \nparticipate  in  resettlement  and  assist  in  distributing  information.  International  and  local \nresettlement  experts  will  work  closely  with  the  PMUs,  and  affected  communities,  and  provide \ncapacity building, training, and guide quality of resettlement processes and documentation. \n \nG. \n\nConsultation and Grievance Redress \n\n15. \nAffected  people  will  be  apprised  of  their  rights  to  lodge  grievances  and  shown  the \nprocedures  by  doing  so  verbally  and  in  writing  during  consultation,  survey,  and  time  of \ncompensation. They may present their complaints to the concerned local administrative officials \nand/or the resettlement committees. Complaint will be filed first at the ward/commune level and \nwill  be  elevated  to  the  highest  or  provincial  level  if  affected  people  are  not  satisfied.  Local \nadministrative  authorities  and  resettlement  committees  at  each  level  will  settle  the  complaint \nwithin 15 days. Affected people will be exempted from all taxes, administrative, and legal fees.  \n \nH. \n\nBudget and Implementation Schedule \n\n16. \nThe project\u2019s estimated resettlement cost is US$7.7 million. Adequate budgetary support \nwill  be  committed  and  made  available  to  cover  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  within  the \nagreed  implementation  period.  Resettlement  plans  will  include  breakdowns  for  each  type  of \nloss, with corresponding cost estimates reflecting replacement at current market values. Costs \nfor developing resettlement sites and support costs for implementation will also be included. The \ncost estimates will make adequate provision for contingencies. The resettlement plans will also \ninclude the detailed schedule and procedures related to flow of resettlement funds. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n39 \n\n \n17. \nResettlement plans for each project town will include detailed implementation schedules \ncoordinated  with  the  civil  works  schedule  for  the  subproject.  Approval  to  award  civil  works \ncontracts will not be given until the required lands have been fully acquired, affected people are \nappropriately  compensated  and  relocated,  and  income  restoration  measures  are  in  place  in \naccordance with the principles above. \n \nI. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n18. \nPMUs are responsible for monitoring resettlement. PMUs will supervise land acquisition \nand resettlement and prepare quarterly reports to the PCU, which then reports to ADB. PMUs \nwill  ensure  that  progress  reports  from  consultants  supervising  construction  include  status  of \nresettlement  plans;  information  on  location  and  numbers  of  people  affected;  itemized \ncompensation  amounts;  as  well  as  relocation  paid,  grievances  by,  and  assistance to affected \npeople.  For  external  monitoring  and  post-evaluation, the PCU (with approval from ADB, as to \nterms  of  reference,  qualifications,  and  experience)  will  recruit,  for  the  entire  Project,  an \nindependent  external  monitoring  organization  for  independent biannual review of resettlement. \nThe agency will review achievement and compensation, and then make recommendations. \n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nThe \n\nIEEs \n\nIntroduction \n\nA.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam,  assisted  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \n1. \nprepared a summary initial environmental examination (IEE) report for the Central Region Urban \nEnvironmental  Improvement  Project  and  an  IEE  for  each  of  six  project  towns  (see \nSupplementary  Appendix  G).  This  report  was  prepared  based  on  the  six  IEEs,  field  visits, \ninvestigation, and discussions with staff of project management units (PMUs), and government \nagencies including the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE) and the Ministry \nof  Construction  (MO C).  This  summary  IEE  was  prepared  according  to  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and \nrequirements. ADB classified the Project under environmental category B. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  improve  drainage,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  system in \nfive provincial capitals and one district-level town in central Viet Nam where inadequate urban \ninfrastructure  poses  serious  environmental  and  health  risks,  inhibiting  social  and  economic \ndevelopment. The project\u2019s main objective will be to provide improved environmental conditions \nand urban services in six project towns. \n \n3. \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment  guidelines  and  government \nrequirements.  The  IEE\u2019s  objective  is  to  identify  potential  impacts,  evaluate  their  severity, \nrecommend mitigation measures, and propose a monitoring plan for use during implementation. \n \n4. \nPMUs  in  all  provinces  will  update  IEEs  and  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs) \nfor subprojects after detailed  designs are complete, and will submit them to ADB and DNRE for \nreview and approval. Government regulations require separate updated IEEs and EMPs for five \nproposed landfills (all except Quang Nam) and the wastewater treatment facility in Thanh Hoa. \n \nDescription of the Project \nB. \n \n \n5. \nLong-term  project  goals  are  to  improve  quality  of  life  and  promote  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  six  project  towns:  Dong  Ha,  Ha  Tinh,  Lang  Co,  Quang  Ngai,  Tam  Ky  and \nThanh  Hoa.  Specific  project  objectives  are  to  (i)  improve  urban  environmental  conditions,  and \n(ii)  improve  sustainability  of  the  urban  environmental  companies  (URENCOs)  and  urban \nservices. \n \nThe  Project  will  include  three  major  physical  components:  (i)  drainage  and  flood \n6. \nprotection,  (ii)  wastewater  and  public  sanitation,  and  (iii)  solid  waste  disposal.  The  drainage \ncomponent will cover rehabilitating and cleaning 55 kilometers (km) of existing drains, building \n52  km  of  primary  canals  and  culverts,  building  166  km  of  primary  and  secondary  drains,  and \n110  km  of  tertiary  drains.  New  wastewater  treatment  systems  in  Thanh  Hoa  (13,500  cubic \nmeters (m3)/day)  and  Lang  Co  (4,750  m3/day) will cover collection, treatment, and disposal of \nwastewater  for  these  two  cities.  Solid  waste  disposal  covers  the  collection,  transport,  and \ndisposal of municipal solid waste from the urban areas and selected communes in the provincial \ntowns. The total project cost is estimated at $96.0 million equivalent.  \n \nC. \n \nAll  six  towns  are  located  along  National  Highway  1,160-1,020  km  south  of  Hanoi  on \n7. \ncentral Viet Nam\u2019s flat coastal plain. The climate in all towns is similar: temperature varies only \n\nDescription of the Env ironment \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n41 \n\nslightly, although rainfall varies from a maximum annual average of about 3,400 mm in Lang Co \nto 1,750 mm in Thanh Hoa.  \n \n8. \nThe  five  provincial  towns  are  all  on  near-flat  terrain,  located  5-15  km  inland,  and \nadjacent to major rivers, most of them tidal. The river floodplains are underlain by recent alluvial \nsoils, whereas the towns generally sit on top of older alluvial soils. Dong Ha, by contrast, was \nbuilt on clay residual soil. Lang Co\u2019s project area is a long, narrow sand peninsula, its southern \nhalf between the Lap An Lagoon and the East Sea. Groundwater is the main water supply for \nQuang Ngai, and to some extent for Dong Ha. The other towns use surface water. \n \n9. \nSurface  water  quality  will  be  most  affected  by  the  proposed  works.  Water  quality \ninformation and a limited program of field sampling and laboratory analysis were completed in \nApril 2003 specifically for the IEE. The results of these investigations are presented in each IEE. \nThe  data  confirms  that  many  drains  and  receiving  rivers  are  polluted.  These  investigations \nrepresent typical dry season conditions, where significant dilution and flushing is rare. \n \nThere are no known endangered flora or fauna in project areas. Most affected  land has \n10. \nalready  been  developed.  Several  sites  of  archeological  or  historical  significance  have  been \nidentified,  and  care  will  be  taken  to  avoid  affecting  them  during  proposed  works.  Additional \ninvestigations during detailed design will ensure protection of historic sites. \n \n11. \nThe five provincial towns have populations ranging from 57,000 at Ha Tinh to 186,000 at \nThanh  Hoa.  Lang  Co,  a  district-level  town,  has  a  population  of  11,000,  but  numbers  are \nexpected  to  grow  substantially  as  tourism  develops.  The  economies  in  provincial  towns  are \nbased  on  services  to  surrounding  rural  regions.  The  main  sources  of  jobs  are  provincial  and \ndistrict governments, market trade, and light industry such as furniture making, handicrafts, and \nfood  processing.  Major  industry  is  limited,  although  Quang  Ngai  is  near  an  industrial  zone \nassociated with the Dung Quat oil refinery. In most communes, income comes from agriculture. \nLang Co\u2019s economy is based mainly on fishing, with tourism expected to dominate in future. \n \nD.  \n \nIn general, the Project proposes significant improvements to quality of life by upgrading \n12. \ninfrastructure  for  drains,  flood  control,  sewerage,  solid  waste  collection,  and  disposal.  The \nproposed works will also provide significant benefits to the physical and ecological environment. \nThe  Project  may  cause  negative  environmental  impacts,  but  those  are  likely  to  be  short-lived, \nminor,  and  limited  by  (i)  carefully  selecting  project  sites,  (ii) seriously implementing proposed \nmitigation  measures  identified  under  the  IEEs,  (iii)  regularly  monitoring  implementation  of  the \nEMP, and (iv) appropriate capacity building at the URENCOs. A summary of potential impacts \nand proposed mitigation measures is provided below. A detailed description of impacts is given \nin the EMP and the IEEs in Supplementary Appendixes F and G, respectively.  \n \n\nScreening of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nLocation of Project Activities \n\n1. \n \nExisting  facilities,  natural  features,  and  topography  dictate  sites  for  drains  and  flood \n13. \nmitigation infrastructure. Drain improvements focus on the inner urban wards, whereas the solid \nwaste  improvements  extend  to  the  communes.  Land  acquisition  for  drain  improvements \ninvolves about 60 hectares (ha) in total, with most affected area Ha Tinh, which severely affects \n206 households. Resettlement of 67 and 87 households, respectively, will also be necessary at \nDong Ha and Tam Ky for new dikes and associated roads. Many others will be affected in those \ntwo towns. Compensation will be provided according to the resettlement plans.  \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n14. \nProposed wastewater treatment plants at Thanh Hoa and Lang Co will be remote from \nurban areas and will occupy about 12 ha and 6 ha respectively of marginal rice paddy fields and \nforest. The need for resettlement is quite minimal, although a number of fishermen near Lap An \nLagoon in Lang Co may need to be compensated. \n \n15. \nLandfill  sites  at  Thanh  Hoa,  Ha  Tinh,  Dong  Ha,  and  Quang  Ngai  have  been  selected \nadjacent to existing facilities. These sites were generally selected for their geological suitability, \nbut  continuing  to  collect  leachate  from  existing  facilities  after  closure  will  be  part  of  the  new \noperations.  In  these  towns,  additional  land  has  been  acquired  and  only  minor  resettlement  is \nrequired.  The  new  landfill  at  Lang  Co  will  require  the  acquisition  of  marginal  agricultural  land. \nAccess roads leading to landfills at all towns except Tam Ky will be upgraded under the Project. \nRoad alignments will generally follow existing tracks or master plan routes and will involve little \nland acquisition or resettlement. In most towns, roads will improve access to rural communities. \n \n\n2. \n\nDesign Aspects \n\n \n16. \nDrain components are designed to reduce flooding, remove storm- and wastewater from \ntowns, and discharge it in rivers, improving the environment and health conditions in each town. \nThese works will not eliminate flooding but will significantly reduce severity and duration.   \n \n17. \nIn  Thanh  Hoa  and  Lang  Co,  wastewater  treatment  facilities  will  improve  surface  water \nand  groundwater  quality.  Treatment  facilities  will  be  designed  to  meet  Vietnamese standards \nrecommended  by  the  MNRE,  and  operations  will  be  monitored  to  optimize  performance  and \nminimize  risk  to  receiving  water  quality.  Sludge  will  need  to  be  carefully  managed  to  ensure \nsatisfactory performance. Guidance on this aspect is provided in the attached EMP.  \n \n18. \nIn  general,  connecting  industries  to  public  sewers  is  sensible,  reducing  the  number  of \ndischarge  points  and  thus  the  complexity  and  cost  of  monitoring  and  enforcement.  Absolutely \ncritical to success, however, is formulating an industrial pretreatment program, including specific \nlimits  hazardous  and  toxic  substances  and  other  pollutants,  as  well  as  monitoring  procedures \nand enforcement capability. \n \n19. \nNew  landfills  will  include  base  liners,  leachate  drainage,  and  collection  and  treatment \nsystems  in  accordance  with  Vietnamese  standards.  This,  together  with  the  natural  clay  soil \nbeneath  most  landfill  sites,  will  minimize  the  risk  of  any  significant  impact  to  the  underlying \ngroundwater  or  downstream  surface  water  resources.  An  integral  part  of  landfill  design  is  the \nclosure  of  existing  landfills  with  clay  capping,  as  well  as  improved  leachate  collection  and \ntreatment  at  the  new  adjacent  facility.  The  net  effect  will  be  positive  for  the  environment.  A \nmonitoring system needs to be established to measure effectiveness of mitigation.   \n \n\n3. \n\nConstruction Activities \n\n \n20.  Much of the existing drain network planned for upgrading is located in densely populated \nurban  areas.  The  excavation  work  involved  in  removing  mud  and  sludge  from  existing  drains \nand retention basins, natural ground from new pipeline routes, and the temporary storage of this \nmaterial alongside the trenches, will result in some inconvenience to adjacent residents. Issues \nof traffic, noise, odor and localized machinery vibration have been identified. The construction of \ndikes  and  roads  will  also  involve  moving  earth,  with  the  potential  for  noise,  dust,  traffic \ncongestion, erosion, and sediment contamination of waterways.   \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n43 \n\nProposed  EMPs  under  the  IEEs  include  detailed  mitigation  measures  such  as \n21. \nrequirements  for  prompt  removal  of  odorous  spoil  from  densely  populated  areas  and \nappropriate  disposal.  The  EMP  also  recommends  restricted  working  hours  and  monitoring \nnoise, dust, and vibration so that work practices can be modified accordingly. \n \n22. \nLandfill  construction  will  entail  some  noise  and  dust,  but  far  from  residential areas and \nwith little negative impact expected. During the closure of old landfills, occupational health and \nsafety measures will be needed to protect workers from contact with leachate and landfill gas. \n \n\n4. \n\nOperation Activities \n\n \n23. \nCapacity  building  at  URENCOs  will  result  in  a  regular  maintenance  program  for  drains \nso  they  do  not  deteriorate  to  their  present  extent.  This  will  also  significantly  improve \noccupational health and safety during maintenance.  \n \n24. \nAt  the  wastewater  treatment  works,  sludge  will  be  collected  periodically  then  dried  and \nmatured  for  several  months  prior  to  disposal.  Screenings  from  plant  operations  will  also  be \ncollected for disposal either onsite or at the landfill. Public sanitary facilities will have a positive \nimpact.  Proposed  waste  stabilization  ponds  are  potentially  odorous  if  not  operated  effectively. \nProcedures  for  operating  and  monitoring  pond  biochemistry  will  be  carried  out  to  ensure \nminimum  odor.  Discharge  of  plant  effluent  also  will  be  monitored  to  ensure  compliance  with \nVietnamese standards. \n \n25. \nImproved waste storage facilities in communities, together with the proposed education \nprogram,  will  reduce  waste  dumped  in  drains  and  other  low-lying  areas.  Landfill  operation \ninvolves  some  hazardous  activities.  The  operator  will  be  required  to  follow  operational \nprocedures  identified  under  the  IEE  to  ensure  the  design  contains  environmental  protection \nmeasures. Occupational health and safety measures will be included to ensure a safe working \nenvironment for employees and scavengers. \n \nE.  \n \nEach  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  will  be  the  executing  agency in its province. Each \n26. \nexecuting agency will set up a provincial steering committee (PSC) and a project management \nunit (PMU). A project advisory council may be convened on an ad-hoc basis to review progress \nand  resolve  any  problems  arising  during  implementation.  For  overall  project  coordination,  a \nproject coordination unit (PCU) will be established in the MOC. The main functions of the PCU \nare  to  undertake  coordination,  consolidated  project  accounting,  auditing  and  monitoring,  and \nreporting to the MOC, ADB, and other government agencies concerned. \n \nTo ensure that ADB environmental requirements and all applicable environmental laws, \n27. \nregulations, and standards are met during design, construction, and operation, an EMP for each \nof six project towns has been prepared and will be carried out by the PSC/PMU at the provincial \nlevel,  in  collaboration  with  the  departments  of  natural  resources  and  environment  (DNRE) \nconcerned.  An  integral  part  of  the  EMP  will  be  environmental  monitoring  implemented  by  a \ndesignated environmental laboratory. PSC/PMU assured that the mitigation measures identified \nin  the  IEE  will  be  incorporated  into  design,  construction,  and  operation.  Environmental \nmeasures needing action from contractors will be incorporated in civil works contracts.  \n \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Monitoring Program \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nPMUs, with the support of DNREs concerned, will monitor implementation of proposed \n28. \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures.  Results  will  be  reported  to  the  PCU,  MOC,  MNRE,  and \nADB through semiannual reports on project implementation and environmental monitoring. \n \nAt least one environment specialist will be on staff at each PMU because the PSC/PMU \n29. \nlacks  the  professional  capabilities  to  monitor  IEE  implementation.  An  environmental  capacity-\nbuilding component to the PCU and PMUs needs to be included under the Project so that those \ndirectly responsible for implementation and monitoring the EMP can fulfill their responsibilities.    \n \nF.  \n \n30. \nThe various activities involved in the design, construction, and operation of the upgraded \ndrainage,  flood  protection,  sanitation,  wastewater  treatment,  and  solid  waste  infrastructure  will \nhave a significant positive impact on quality of life and the physical environment in all six towns. \n  \n31. \nPotential  adverse  impacts  have  been  identified,  such  as  those  associated  with \nconstruction.  Other  negative  effects  are  associated  with  infrastructure  operation.  However, \npotential  adverse  impacts  arising  from  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  proposed \nproject activities will be temporary, minor, localized, and can be minimized to acceptable levels \nthrough mitigation measures and monitoring programs identified under the IEEs. Resettlement \nissues have been recognized and will be specifically addressed in the resettlement plans. \n \n32. \nAll six PMUs will prepare and submit updated subproject IEEs and EMPs for review and \napproval  by  ADB  and  DNRE  following  completion  of  detailed  designs.  In  accordance  with \ngovernment legislation, separate updated IEEs and EMPs for each landfill and the Thanh Hoa \nwastewater treatment facility will be required at the detailed design stage. These will more fully \nevaluate the potential negative impacts of these facilities and further develop/update appropriate \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring.  ADB  and  the  DNREs  concerned  must  approve  the  final \nIEE for each landfill and the wastewater treatment facility before construction can begin.    \n \n33. \nTo minimize the potential harm to the Lap An Lagoon and achieve sustainable tourism in \nLang  Co,  at  least  two  alternatives  for  disposal  of  effluent  from  the  wastewater  treatm ent plant \nneed to be studied during design. One option could be to reuse treated wastewater to irrigate a \nplanned golf course. \n \nG.  \n \n34. \nThe conclusion of this summary IEE, based on the IEEs for six project towns,  was that \nthe  Project  is  unlikely  to  result  in  serious  negative  environmental  impact.  This  is  because  (i) \nproposed project activities are designed to improve quality of life and physical environment, and \nadverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  design,  construction,  and  operation  will  be \ntemporary, minor, localized, and can be mitigated to acceptable levels; (ii) no project activities \nwill  be  located  close  to  or  within  environmentally  sensitive  areas;  (iii)  each  project  town  has \nprepared an IEE, including  an EMP, which will be reviewed and endorsed by the environmental \nauthorities concerned; (iv) all construction activities be regularly monitored by the PMU and the \nDNRE; and (v) water quality monitoring be carried out for all sewage treatment plants and the \nlandfill works by a designated, provincial-level environmental laboratory.  \n \n35. \nimpact assessment is not warranted.    \n \n\nAccording to the above assessment and ADB\u2019s requirements, a detailed environmental \n\nConclusion \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n45 \n \n\nESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS \n($ \u2018000) \n\nComponent \n\nHa Tinh  Dong Ha  Lang Co \n\nTam Ky \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.

Provincial  people\u2019s  committees  (PPC)  will  be  the  executing \nagencies,  following  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  decentralizing  project  responsibility.  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has used the same arrangement in previous urban sector projects. \n \n2. \nProvincial Steering Committee. PPCs will set up provincial steering committees (PSC) \nwith  overall  responsibility  for  implementation.  Each  PSC  will be chaired by a vice chairman of \nthe  PPC  and  will  comprise  senior  officials  from  the  PPC;  the  departments  of  construction, \nfinance,  planning  and  investment,  and  science,  technology  and  environment;  town  people\u2019s \ncommittees (TPC), provincial-level Women\u2019s Unions, and the head of the project management \nunit  (PMU).  The  PSC  will  appoint  PMU  staff  and  experts,  provide  policy  guidance  to  the  PMU \nand consultants, and coordinate provincial agencies for timely implementation.  \n \n3. \nThe PSC will (i) advise the PPC on implementation status; (ii) assist the PPC in making \ndecisions related to implementation within the authority of the provincial government; (iii) assist \nthe  PPC  in  approving  key  provincial  project  documents,  including  feasibility studies, provincial \nbidding  plans,  bid  documents,  draft  contracts,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract  awards  and \nvariations; (iv) assist the PPC in approving the budget for counterpart funds and ensuring their \ntimely release; (v) coordinate provincial organizations and PMUs during project implementation; \n(vi) assist the PPC in approving other project documents submitted by the PMU; (vii) follow up \nwith  the  PPC  leader  on  compliance  to  policy,  financial,  and  institutional  reforms;  and  (viii) \nprovide policy direction. \n \n4. \nProject Management Unit. The PPC in each province will set up a PMU with in the TPC \nor the urban environmental company (URENCO) except for Thia Thien Hue Province. The PMU \nwill be responsible for day-to-day implementation and will comprise staff from the URENCO and \nprovincial-, town-, or district-level agencies with expertise in project management, construction \nsupervision,  contract  administration,  drainage  and  sanitary  engineering,  environmental \nmanagement, accounting, community awareness and development, and resettlement. \n \nThe  main  responsibilities  of  the  PMU  are  to  (i)  supervise  consultants\u2019  work  schedules \n5. \nand  performance;  review  designs,  bidding  plans,  bid  documents,  and  contracts; and prepare \nrecommendations  for  approval  by  provincial  authorities;  (ii)  prequalify  contractors,  undertake \ncontract negotiations, supervise the performance of contractors, certify the quality and quantity \nof  their  output,  and  authorize  payments  accordingly;  (iii)  prepare  withdrawal  applications  for \napproval by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) before submitting them to ADB; (iv) approve payment \nthrough  an  imprest  account  and  maintain  disbursement  records;  (v)  prepare  monthly  and \nquarterly project progress reports to the PCU so they can be consolidated before submission to \nthe  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  in  the  Ministry  of  Construction  (MOC)  and  ADB;  and  help \nprepare  the  project  completion  report;  (vi)  maintain  sound  project  accounts  and  ensure  timely \ncompletion  and  submission  of  the  account  and  financial  statements  of  URENCO  for  auditing; \n(vii) coordinate all field-level activities of all provincial-, district-, and town-level agencies related \nto  the  Project;  (viii)  supervise  compliance  with  local  sanitation  regulations  and  recommend \nactions  to  PPCs  for  improvement;  (ix)  coordinate  institutional  strengthening  and  training \nactivities; (x) prepare monitoring and evaluation reports to PSC, PCU, and ADB (xi) supervise \nthe  preparation  of  initial  environmental  examinations  and  implementation  of  environmental \nmanagement plans; and (xii) supervise the updating and implementation of resettlement plans. \n  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n \n\nProject Advisory Committee.  A project advisory committee (PAC) may be convened \n6. \non an ad-hoc basis at the request of a senior official of MOC or any one of the project PPCs. \nThe PAC will comprise one senior official from MOC as chairperson and senior representatives \nof project provinces as members.

Least-cost analyses were undertaken for drainage, wastewater, and \npublic sanitation, and solid waste subprojects. A cost-benefit analysis is carried out for each \ndrainage  subproject.  The  subprojects  are  evaluated  over  a  period  of  30  years  with  no \nsalvage value assumed thereafter. \n \nB. \n \nLeast-cost  analyses  were  carried  out  for  the  three  main  engineering  project \n2. \ncomponents:  (i)  combined  drainage  and  wastewater  systems  and  flood  protection,  (ii) \nwastewater  treatment  in  Lang  Co  and  Thanh  Hoa,  and  (iii)  solid  waste  systems,  with  the \ndevelopment of sanitary landfills and upgrading and expansion of collection systems.  \n \n \n \n3. \nThe drainage subcomponents in the five provincial towns will improve the combined \ndrainage systems as a first step toward long-term drainage master plans. Separate drainage \nand  sewerage  systems  will  be  developed  in  Lang  Co,  in  accordance  with  its  master  plan. \nFlood protection improvement will include the construction of dike roads and tide gates.  \n \nThe  capacity  of  the  combined  drain  depends  primarily  on  the  design  storm14  and \n4. \ncatchment  characteristics,  as  wastewater  represent  only  a  small  percentage  of  the  total \nconduit flows in the wet season. Design storm return periods adopted for the project are 2 \nyears for primary drains and 1-2 years for secondary and tertiary drains, in accordance with \ncurrent  practice  in  Vietnam.  Designing  for  more  severe  events  is  not  justified  because  the \nincreased costs outweigh the benefits arising from less frequent flooding. \n \n5. \nBased  on  the  engineering  design  criteria,  the  best  technical  options  have  been \nselected  providing  the  necessary  combined  drainage  and  flood  protection  in  each  town.  In \nmost  cases,  there  are  no  discrete  engineering  alternatives,  so  the  system  is  the  least-cost \noption to meet drainage and flood protection requirements. \n \n6. \nIn the case of dikes in Tam Ky and Dong Ha, where these structures are designed to \nprevent annual flooding of residential areas located between the river and the main highway \n(built  above  the  flood  level),  analyses  shows  these  structures  are  the  least-cost alternative \nwhen compared with the alternative of resettling all households in flood-prone areas. \n \n \n \n7. \nThe  wastewater  subcomponent  is  designed  to  collect,  treat,  and  safely  dispose  of \nwastewater from urban areas in Thanh Hoa and Lang Co. The works in Thanh Hoa include \nconstruction of interceptor chambers on the combined drains, close to their discharge points, \nto divert sewage flows to the interceptor sewer for treatment. The wastewater subcomponent \nin Lang Co will develop a separate sewerage system.  The interceptor sewerage system and \nwastewater treatment facility are designed for projected wastewater flows in 2012 in Thanh \nHoa and 2015 in Lang Co, with provision for expansion. \n \n\nWastewater Collection and Treatment  \u2013 Lang Co and Thanh Hoa \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n14  The  design  storm  depends  on  catchment  area  and  rainfall  characteristics  of  the  region, which are based on \n\nstatistical analyses of rainfall data published by Meteorological Department. \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 13 \n\n3. \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\n8. \nThe  wastewater  treatment  works  will  comprise  waste  stabilization  ponds  (WSPs), \nwhich  are  widely  used  throughout  the  world.  WSPs  are  simple  to  operate  and  maintain, \nrequire no electricity or chemicals, and will be designed to produce high-quality effluent that \nmeets  Vietnamese  and  international  standards.  These  were  shown  to  be  the  least-cost \ntreatment option in  each case. In Lang Co, alternatives included activated sludge treatment \nand a sea outfall, and in Thanh Hoa activated sludge treatment.  \n \n9. \nIn  Thanh  Hoa,  comparison  of  combined  drainage  and  wastewater  system  with \nseparate  systems  demonstrated  that  the  proposed  combined  system  was  the  least-cost \noption.  In  the  case  of  Lang  Co,  comparison  of  the  preferred  collection  system  using  septic \ntanks  was  compared  with  direct  connection  of  households.  While  the  results  (within  10% \ndifference)  showed  that  the  preferred  option  was  least  cost,  it  is  recommended  that  the \nalternatives  be  examined  in  more  detail  by  the  detailed  design  consultant  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n \n \n10. \nTo  ensure  that  the  solid  waste  component  is  the  least-cost  option,  the  following \nsegments of the solid waste project were examined in each town: (i) initial waste storage and \ncollection options, (ii) the need for transfer stations within the towns, and (iii) municipal solid \nwaste treatment and disposal alternatives. \n \nIn each town, the collection of solid waste was examined. The ideal situation is where \n11. \ncompactor  trucks  can  pick  up  waste  directly  from  bins.  However,  this  is  not  possible in all \ntowns because of local conditions (narrow lanes, uneven road and pavement conditions, and \nsocial  factors  such  as  vandalism.)  The  next  least-cost  collection  method  is  by  pedicart  or \nhandcart,  with  compactor  trucks  picking  up  solid  waste  from temporary collection stations. \nThe  size  and  number  of  compactor  trucks  was  optimized  based  on  local  topography  and \nvolumes of solid waste to be collected. \n \nLeast-cost analyses demonstrated that permanent transfer stations were not justified \n12. \nin  any  towns  because  of  the  close  proximity  of  the  landfills.  The  least-cost options were \ntemporary  transfer  stations  where  waste  from  pedicarts  and  handcarts  are  transferred  to \ntrucks  for  direct  transport  to  landfill  sites.  Solid  waste collected by compactor trucks from \nhouseholds or bins will be transported directly to the landfill site. \n \n13. \nThe  options  evaluated  for  treatment/disposal  of  municipal  solid  waste  are  sanitary \nlandfills,  incineration,  and  biological  conversion.  The  least-cost  analysis  showed  the  landfill \nwas the best option, followed by composting associated with landfill. The incineration option \nwas the most costly. Sanitary landfills are therefore recommended for each town. \n \nC. \n\nCost-Benefit Analysis for Drainage Subproject \n\nThe  cost-benefit  analysis  for  drainage  subprojects  in  each  town  was  undertaken by \n14. \ncomparing  the  cost  and  benefits  under  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  without-\nproject scenario refers to the continuation of the existing situation. The with-project case is \nestablished  by  appraising  the  costs  and  benefits  of  each  of  drainage  subprojects.  The \nsubprojects  are  evaluated  over  a  period  of  30  years  with  no  salvage  value  assumed \nthereafter. \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProject Cost \n\n15. \nThe capital costs and incremental operation and maintenance costs of each drainage \nsubproject have been considered. Economic costs have been derived from financial  project \ncosts. All costs are expressed in constant 2003 prices. Physical contingencies of 10% have \nbeen added to the base costs, and taxes and duties have been discounted as appropriate. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n 55\n\n \n2. \n\nEconomic Benefit. \n\nEconomic  costs  were  valued  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  but  expressed  in  dollars. \nTradable components have been adjusted to economic prices using the shadow exchange \nrate  factor  (SERF)15  and  nontraded  components  are  valued  at  domestic  market  prices. \nAppropriate shadow wage rate factors (SWRF) for unskilled labor have been used to reflect \nits  opportunity  costs  in  the  context  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  wide  labor  availability.16  Incremental \noperation and maintenance costs have been taken into account and added to capital costs \nto obtain the total economic cost of the subprojects for each year. \n \n \n \nThe subproject will generate benefits both to each town\u2019s economy and to individual \n16. \nhouseholds  and  businesses.  Drainage  improvements  will  reduce  incidence  and  severity  of \nflooding  and  will  therefore  significantly  reduce  (i)  flood  damage  to  properties,  (ii)  post-flood \ncleanup  costs,  (iii)  lost  employment  opportunities  due  to  flooding,  (iv)  loss  of  income  to \nbusinesses  (commerce  and  market  gardening),  (v)  sick  days  lost  due  to  waterborne \ndiseases,  and  (vi)  expenditure  on  the  maintenance  of  roads,  drains,  and  other  municipal \ninfrastructure.  \n \nIn some towns,  flood  protection  dike  roads  to  be  built  under  the  Project  will  create \n17. \nnew areas of land free from annual flooding for urban and commercial uses. The incremental \nvalue of land created has been taken as a benefit to the project. Surplus excavation material \nwill  also  be  available  for  land  development  in  most  towns.  The  value  of  this  material  has \nbeen counted as a subproject benefit. In Lang Co, fees paid by hotels for drainage services \nhas been counted as a project benefit. In each town, the population in wards where annual \nflooding occurs has been identified. Households in these wards will benefit from reduced or \neliminated  flood  damage  and  cleanup  cost.  The  benefits  of  less  work  lost,  health  costs \nsaved,  and  travel  delays  avoided  will  accrue  to  the  whole  town  as  a  result  of  floods  that \nblock roads, disrupt access to markets, schools, hospitals, and public services, and spread \npolluted water throughout towns.  \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe  economic  internal  rates of  return  (EIRRs)  have  been  calculated  for  drainage \nsubprojects  in  each  town  and  for  the  overall  drainage  subproject.  The  results  of  the \neconomic analysis are summarized in  Table A13. The EIRR for overall drainage subproject \nis 18.3%. EIRRs for individual drainage subprojects range from 16.4% to 21.1%. \n \n19. \nSensitivity analyses have been undertaken to test the robustness of the analysis and \nthe consequences of changes in the following variables: (i) a 10% increase in capital cost, (ii) a \n20% decrease in avoided property damage benefits, (iii) a 20% decrease in avoided work loss, \n(iv)  a  20%  decrease  in  health  benefits,  (v)  a  20%  decrease  in  tourism  benefits,  (vi)  a  10% \ndecrease  in  the  overall  economic  benefits,  and  (vii)  project  benefits  delayed  by  1  year.  The \nresults of the analysis show that the Project is most sensitive to delays in project completion. \nHowever, all EIRRs exceed the social opportunity cost of capital and the plausible ranges of \nthe tested variables are well within the respective switching values. \n \nE. \n \n20. \nA distribution analysis has been undertaken for each town to measure the distribution \nof the project benefits to different stakeholders including consumers, government, laborers, \nand urban environmental companies (URENCOs). The analysis shows that, in general, the \nconsumers and laborers receive the majority of project benefits, and the government and the \nURENCOs  will  experience  loss  from  the  Project  by  subsidizing  it  in  economic  terms.

Industrial  users  are  defined  as  those \ninvolved in medium- and large-scale production of commercial commodities.17 \n \nC. \n \nThere  is  no  charge  on  drainage/wastewater  service  at  present  in  any  of  the  six  towns \n4. \nexcept  Tam  Ky.  The  service  depends  entirely  on  payments  by  the  provincial/municipal \ngovernments  for  all  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures.  The  respective  provincial/municipal \ngovernments will finance construction and maintenance on the drain and sewerage systems from \ntheir  budgets.  The  proposed  cost-recovery  mechanism  is  a  water  tariff  surcharge  and  an \nenvironmental fee. Under the Project, a water tariff surcharge will be established and collected by \neach  URENCO  to  recover  all  O&M  costs18  for  the  drainage/wastewater  systems.  Each \nprovincial/municipal government will levy an environmental fee19 to recover an appropriate portion \nof  capital  costs.  In  the  long  run,  the  water  tariff  will  aim  to  recover  the  cost  of  the  wastewater \nsystem  when  it  is  separated  from  the  drainage  system,  while  the  environmental  fee  will  aim  to \nrecover both the recurrent and capital costs of the drainage system.  \n \nThe  proposed  water  tariff  surcharges are set at such levels to ensure that revenues from \n5. \nwater  tariff  surcharges  can  recover  O&M  and  depreciation  costs  on  equipment  for  the \ndrainage/wastewater system. The recommended charge levels are summarized in Table A14.1. \n \n \n \n \n\nUrban Drainage/Flood Protection and Wastewater/Public Sanitation \n\nindustrial.

On this basis, the proposed \ncharge  levels  for  drainage/wastewater  service  are  affordable.  The  affordability  analysis  indicates \nthat charge levels are affordable to commercial/institutional and industrial users, as the expenditure \nof these users on drainage/wastewater service is below the respective affordability benchmarks of \n0.5% and 1.0% of their average monthly business income.  \n \n\nthe  sum  of \n\nthe  charges \n\nthat \n\nTable A14.2: Affordability Analysis \u2013 Drainage and Waste Water \n(dong, January 2003 constant prices) \n \n\n \n\n  Average monthly household income \n  Average expenditure on services \n  Percentage \n\n \n \n  Poor household \n \n \n \n  Household with average income \n \n \n \n\n  Average monthly household income \n  Average expenditure on services \n  Percentage \n\nDong Ha \n\nHa Tinh \n\n \n600,000 \n10,672 \n1.8% \n \n1,100,000 \n16,419 \n1.5% \n\n \n600,000 \n10,623 \n1.8% \n \n1,100,000 \n16,344 \n1.5% \n\nLang Co  Quang Ngai  Tam Ky  Thanh Hoa \n \n \n600,000 \n600,000 \n5,835 \n9,987 \n1.0% \n1.7% \n \n \n1,300,000  1,100,000  1,500,000 \n8,977 \n0.6% \n\n \n600,000 \n10,434 \n1.7% \n \n1,200,000 \n16,052 \n1.3% \n\n \n600,000 \n10,327 \n1.7% \n \n\n15,364 \n1.2% \n\n15,888 \n1.4% \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\n \nD. \n \n 7. \nAll  six  towns  have  started  collecting  charges  for  solid  waste  management  services. \nHowever,  they  are  not  enough  to  finance  even  the  O&M  costs  of  the  services.  Proposed  tariff \nlevels to achieve full cost recovery are summarized in table 14.3. Charges have been determined \non a tonnage basis and then converted to a monthly user charges such as a charge per household \nper month for domestic users,21 charge per bin per month for commercial/institutional users,22 and \ncharge  per  truckload  for  industrial  users.23 The average tariff requirements for subprojects range \nfrom a low of D71,874/ton for Lang Co to a high of D130,151/ton for Ha Tinh. \n \n8. \nThe results of the financial analysis for solid waste management subprojects are presented \nin  Table  A14.4.  FIRRs  for  subprojects  range  from  7.2%  to  10.6%,  which  are  all  above  the 4% \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital.  All  subprojects  are  financially  viable.  The  sensitivity  of  each \nsubproject FIRR is analyzed to consider the following adverse changes: (i) an increase in capital \ncosts,  (ii)  an  increase  in  O&M  costs,  (iii)  a  reduction  in  revenues,  and  (iv) delays  in  subproject \n                                                 \n20  Based on the following water consumption levels: 78 liters per capita per day for poor households, 120 liters per capita \nper day for average household, 150 cubic meters per month for commercial/institutional users, and 900 cubic meters \nper month for industrial users.  \n\n21  Average solid waste generated by a household is estimated at 0.09 tons/month. \n22  The monthly turnover capacity of a bin is 2.2 tons. \n23  A truckload equals to 6.0 tons. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nrevenues.

Table A14.5 shows the  results of the \nsolid  waste  management  service  affordability  analysis  using  the  charge  levels  to  be  applied  in \n2007.24 The results indicate that tariffs are below the maximum affordability benchmark of 2.0% of \naverage monthly household income, even for poor households.  \n \n \n \n\nTable A14.3: Proposed Tariff for Solid Waste Management Services \n(dong, current prices) \n \n\n   \nDong Ha \n\n   \n   \nHa Tinh \n\n   \n   \nLang Co \n\n   \n   \nTam Ky \n\n   \n   \nThanh Hoa \n\n   \nDomestic (household/month) \nCommercial/Institutional \n(bin/month) \nIndustrial (truckload) \nDomestic (household/month) \nCommercial/Institutional \n(bin/month) \nIndustrial (truckload) \nDomestic (household/month) \nCommercial/Institutional \n(bin/month) \nIndustrial (truckload) \n\nCommercial/Institutional \n(bin/month) \nIndustrial (truckload) \nDomestic (household/month) \nCommercial/Institutional \n(bin/month) \nIndustrial (truckload) \nDomestic (household/month) \nCommercial/Institutional \n(bin/month) \nIndustrial (truckload) \n\n   \n   \nQuang Ngai  Domestic (household/month) \n\n2003a \n\n7,000\n\n60,000\n220,000\n4,000\n\n50,000\n200,000\n4,000\n\n75,000\n220,000\n5,500\n\n60,000\n250,000\n5,500\n\n80,000\n230,000\n6,000\n\n2004\n9,473\n\n81,198\n297,726\n5,413\n\n67,665\n270,660\n5,413\n\n101,498\n297,726\n7,443\n\n81,198\n338,325\n7,443\n\n108,264\n311,259\n8,120\n\n2006\n11,845\n\n101,530\n372,277\n6,769\n\n84,608\n338,434\n6,769\n\n126,913\n372,277\n9,307\n\n101,530\n423,042\n9,307\n\n135,373\n389,199\n10,153\n\n2007\n13,845\n\n400,556\n728,283\n13,947\n\n410,236\n761,168\n7,702\n\n369,529\n405,149\n13,283\n\n278,605\n611,359\n11,610\n\n310,692\n488,557\n13,317\n\n2012\n16,926\n\n489,685\n890,336\n17,051\n\n501,519\n930,538\n9,416\n\n451,755\n495,300\n16,238\n\n340,598\n747,395\n14,193\n\n379,825\n597,267\n16,280\n\n314,647\n525,385\n\n118,452\n423,042\n\n384,661\n642,291\n\n94,731\n338,325\n\n70,000\n250,000\n\nFinancial Performance of URENCOs \n\n   \n   \n a Current solid waste management tariff levels. \n \n \nE. \n \n9. \nAll six URENCOs are established public utility enterprises in accordance with Decree 56/CP \nissued  on  2  October  1996.  Though  with  varying  degrees of financial and operational autonomy, \ntheir  operations  depend  largely  on  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  (PPC)  OR  town  people\u2019s \ncommittee (TPC) budget allocation25 for drainage/wastewater, solid waste, and other services, with \nlimited appreciation of user tariff revenue collection. To reduce the budget support, six PPCs/TPCs \nand URENCOs have emphasized the need to adopt the user-pay principle to recover, among other \nthings, cost of O&M including depreciation of O&M equipment for those services identified as cost-\nrecoverable.  Financial  projections  for  six  URENCOs  over  2004-2014  are  based  on  the \ndrainage/wastewater and solid waste charges described above. The URENCOs will establish two \nself-accounting  units  with  separate  accounts \nfor  drainage/wastewater  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  services.  The  revenues  from  each  service  will  be  collected  and  retained  by  the \nrespective unit to directly recover operating costs and amortization of subsidiary loans that finance \nO&M equipment.26 \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n24  Based on 0.09 ton/month per household. \n25  This implies that the budget allocated has been completely used by year-end. \n26  Other nonrecoverable services need to be fully financed by the PPCs/TPCs on an annual contract basis. \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n10. \nThe  summary  financial  projections  for  six  URENCOs  are  shown  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  M.  The  projections  indicate  that  the  financial  performance  of  the  URENCOs  improves \nover the 2004-2014 forecast period as drainage/wastewater tariffs are applied and solid waste tariff \nincreases are implemented. The government\u2019s budget support to the services will gradually fall and \nfinally  be  eliminated  in  2006.  For  all  project  towns,  both  units  may  experience  cash  shortfalls  for \nthe first few years when they start to repay the loan principals and interest, but the analysis shows \npositive  accumulated  net  surpluses  in  all  years,  indicating  their  financial  capabilities  to  generate, \nover  the  project  operating  life,  sufficient  revenue  to  recover  all  costs  for  O&M,  management, \nadministration,  and  debt  service  obligations.  The  results  also  demonstrate  the  need  and \nimportance  of  allowing  the  URENCOs  to  retain  all  tariff  revenue  collected  for  future  expenditure \nand debt services. \n \n\n \n \n\nDong Ha \n \n \nHa Tinh \n \n \nLang Co \n \n \nQuang Ngai \n \n \nTam Ky \n \n \nThanh Hoa \n\n \n \nFIRR \nSI \nSV \nFIRR \nSI \nSV \nFIRR \nSI \nSV \nFIRR \nSI \nSV \nFIRR \nSI \nSV \nFIRR \n SI \n SV \n\nTable A14.4: FIRRs and Results of Sensitivity Analysis \n \n\n \n\nUp 10% \n\nBase Case  Capital Cost   O&M Cost \nUp 10% \n \n6.8% \n               3.3 \n \n30.6% \n \n5.9% \n               4.4 \n \n22.8% \n \n8.8% \n               1.8 \n \n54.8% \n \n8.1% \n               2.5 \n \n40.8% \n \n5.7% \n               4.3 \n \n23.4% \n \n8.4% \n               2.6 \n \n38.5% \n\n4.4% \n             9.2 \n10.9% \n4.6% \n             8.3 \n12.0% \n8.2% \n             3.5 \n28.6% \n6.8% \n             5.3 \n18.9% \n5.8% \n             4.4 \n22.6% \n6.4% \n             6.3 \n15.8% \n\n \n8.5% \n \n \n7.6% \n \n \n10.4% \n \n \n9.9% \n \n \n7.2% \n \n \n10.6% \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nRevenues \nDown 10%  Delayed 1 Year \n\nRevenues \n\n2.4% \n           13.5 \n7.4% \n2.6% \n           13.7 \n7.3% \n6.4% \n             6.3 \n15.8% \n4.8% \n             8.7 \n11.4% \n4.1% \n             9.7 \n10.3% \n4.0% \n             9.9 \n10.1% \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6.5%  \n             0.4  \n             2.6  \n5.7%  \n             0.5  \n             2.1  \n7.9%  \n             0.4  \n             2.8  \n7.6%  \n             0.3  \n             3.1  \n5.4%  \n             0.5  \n             1.8  \n8.0%  \n             0.3  \n             3.2  \n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, SI = sensitivity indicator,  \nSV = switching value. \n\n \n \n\n   \n       \nDomestic Users \n   Poor Households a \n\nTable A14.5: Affordability Analysis \u2013 Solid Waste Management \n(dong, January 2003 constant price) \n \n\nDong Ha\n\nHa Tinh\n\nLang Co Quang Ngai\n\nTam Ky Thanh Hoa\n\n       Average Monthly Household Income \n\n600,000 \n\n600,000 \n\n600,000 \n\n600,000 \n\n600,000 \n\n600,000 \n\n      Average Expenditure on Services  \n      Percentage \n   Household with Average Income \n\n11,789 \n2.0%\n\n11,876 \n2.0%\n\n6,558 \n1.1%\n\n11,310 \n1.9%\n\n9,886 \n1.6%\n\n11,340 \n1.9%\n\n      Average Monthly Household Incomeb  1,100,000  1,100,000  1,200,000 \n\n1,300,000  1,100,000  1,500,000 \n\n      Average Expenditure on Services  \n      Percentage \na  With income below the poverty line of D750,000/month/household (Ministry of Labor, Invalid and Social Affairs criteria).  \nb  Based on socioeconomic survey results. \n\n11,789 \n1.1%\n\n11,876 \n1.1%\n\n11,340 \n0.8%\n\n11,310\n0.9%\n\n6,558 \n0.5%\n\n9,886 \n0.9%\n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2003) \n", "Currency Unit \n", " \u2013 \n", "dong (D) \n", "D 1.00  = \n$1.00  =  D15,615.00 \n", "$0.00006404 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation \ncommunity-based sanitation \ncommunity management committee \ncountry strategy and program \ndepartment of natural resources and environment \neconomic international rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \nHo Chi Minh City \nhousehold sanitation program \ninitial environmental examination \nlocal competitive bidding \nmillennium development goals and targets \nMinistry of Construction \nMinistry of Finance \noperation and maintenance \nproject advisory committee \nproject coordination unit \nproject management unit \nprovincial people's committee \nproject performance monitoring system \nprovincial steering committee \nstatement of expenditure \ntechnical assistance \ntown people's committee \nurban environmental company \n", "ADB \nAFD \nBME \nCBS \nCMC \nCSP \nDNRE \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nHCMC \nHSP \nIEE \nLCB \nMDGTs \nMOC \nMOF \nO&M \nPAC \nPCU \nPMU \nPPC \nPPMS \nPSC \nSOE \nTA \nTPC \nURENCO \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n", " \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of A.
