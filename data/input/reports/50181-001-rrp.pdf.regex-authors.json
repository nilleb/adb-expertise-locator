THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Fiji for Emergency Assistance for Recovery from Tropical Cyclone Winston. \nThe emergency assistance loan (EAL) will support the Government of Fiji\u2019s fiscal response to \nprovide  additional  funding  for  disaster-related  recovery  expenditure.  The  EAL  will  help  to \nmitigate the adverse social and economic impacts of the cyclone on vulnerable people and \nhouseholds.1 \n \nII.  THE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE LOAN \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Description of the emergency. Tropical Cyclone Winston, the second most powerful \nstorm on record (after Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines in 2013), struck Fiji on 20 February \n2016. The cyclone killed 44 people and left a trail of destruction across large parts of Fiji. As \nmany as 540,000 people (62% of the population) were affected by the disaster. An estimated \n30,369  houses  (22%  of  households)  were  destroyed  or  damaged,  leaving  approximately \n131,000 people residing in temporary shelters or under tarpaulins. The cyclone damaged 495 \nschools  and  88  health  facilities,  disrupted  basic  public  services  (power,  water,  and \ncommunications), and destroyed food crops and livelihoods. \n \n3.  Total damage and loss is estimated to be $1.42 billion\u2014equivalent to 31% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP). This is based on the post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA) jointly \nprepared  by  the government  and  development  partners.  Among  the social  and  productive \nsectors,  damage  and  loss  was  especially  concentrated  in  the  housing,  education,  and \nagriculture sectors (Table 1). \nTable 1: Disaster Damage and Loss Estimates  \n($ million) \nItem   Damage  Loss  Total \nProductive sectors  115.69  284.46  400.15 \nAgriculture, livestock, forestry, and fishing  38.89  220.43  259.32 \nCommerce and manufacturing  34.84  33.45  68.30 \nMining  5.51  9.55  15.06 \nTourism  36.45  21.03  57.48 \nSocial sectors  453.41  19.15  472.56 \nEducation         90.4a  3.53  93.93 \nHealth  3.68  2.99  6.67 \nHousing  359.33  12.63  371.96 \nInfrastructure sectors  99.04  19.28  118.32 \nElectricity  15.78  3.89  19.67 \nWater and sanitation  8.09  3.73  11.82 \nTransport and communication  75.17  11.66  86.83 \nCrosscutting sectors  114.67  315.59  430.26 \nCulture  2.45  0.13  2.58 \nDisaster risk management  0.97  14.11  15.08 \nEnvironment  111.25  301.35  412.60b \n  Total  782.81    638.48  1,421.29 \na  Initial  estimates  of  education  damages  of  $33 million  have  been  revised \nupwards based on subsequent substantive assessments carried out by the Fiji \nInstitute of Engineers.  \nb  The  estimate  of  environmental  damage  and  loss  includes  valuation  of \necosystem functions that are not included in the official national accounts. \nSource: Government of Fiji.

As a result of Tropical Cyclone Winston, GDP growth in 2016 is anticipated to fall by 1.4 \npercentage points (Table 2). Initial estimates for the impact on GDP were that Tropical Cyclone \nWinston would cut economic growth by 2.5% in 2016. However, immediate relief efforts\u2014which \nincluded the Fiji National Provident Fund permitting members to withdraw up to $2,400 of their \nsavings to help meet housing recovery needs, and the government\u2019s supplemental funding for \nsocial protection programs\u2014provided a boost to consumer spending and to GDP overall. With \nrecovery and reconstruction activity already under way, the economy is expected to grow by \n3.6% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2018. \n \nTable 2: Selected Macroeconomic Indicatorsa  \nPre-Cyclone  Post-Cyclone \n       \nItem  2013  2014  2015b  2016c  2017c  2018c  2016c  2017c  2018c \nReal economy                            \n                \nGDP ($ million)  4,196  4,532  4,782  4,765  5,183  5,381  4,872  5,061  5,267 \nReal GDP growth (%)  4.6  5.3  4.0  3.8  3.2  3.1  2.4  3.6        3.2 \nConsumer price growth (%, period  2.9  0.5  2.8  2.0  2.5  2.8  2.1  3.0  2.6 \naverage) \nFiscal accounts (% of GDP)             \nRevenue (% of GDP)  27.0  27.6  28.2  29.3  29.1  29.2  29.0  29.1    29.2 \nExpenditure (% of GDP)  27.6  31.8  32.8  34.4  33.5  32.5  36.0  34.5    32.2 \n    Current (% of GDP)  19.5  20.3  21.1  20.8  19.2  17.7  21.6  19.9    18.1 \n    Capital (% of GDP)  8.1  11.5  11.7  13.6  14.3  14.8  14.4  14.6    14.1 \nOverall balance (% of GDP)  (0.6)  (4.3)  (4.6)  (5.1)  (4.4)  (3.3)  (6.4)  (5.0)    (2.9) \nBalance of payments           \nCurrent account balance (% of  (9.8)  (7.2)  (5.4)  (7.9)  (6.5)  (6.2)  (7.8)  (8.2)    (8.5) \nGDP) \nImports (% of GDP)  74.2  62.8  54.6  68.5  74.6  61.6  71.8  79.0    65.7 \nExports (% of GDP)  56.6  54.8  49.8  55.7  56.9  52.8  57.3  58.9    53.1 \nGross reserves ($ million)  990  1,010  1,062  1,136  1,183  1,242  942  959     988 \n    In months of imports (months)  5.3  5.2  5.1  4.8  4.5  4.9  3.8  3.5     4.3 \nExternal debt (% of GDP)  21.1  22.1  20.9  21.0  20.2  19.5  22.8  22.0     21.1 \nExternal debt ($ million)  885  1,000  999  1,056  1,064  1,073  1,156  1,164  1,173 \nGDP = gross domestic product. \na \nCalendar year. \nb  Estimated. \nc  Projected. \nSources: Fiji Bureau of Statistics, Reserve Bank of Fiji, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.  Tropical Cyclone Winston will adversely affect Fiji\u2019s medium-term fiscal position and the \ngovernment\u2019s capacity to implement planned fiscal consolidation measures. The government \nhad been anticipating reducing expenditure by approximately 1.5% of GDP between 2015 and \n2018, after significant expansions between 2011 and 2014 to provide free primary education \nand improve road infrastructure and water supply.2 However, the need for significant recovery \nand reconstruction spending will lead to further fiscal pressures in 2016 and 2017. Following the \ncyclone,  the  government  immediately  reprioritized  spending  to  meet  emergency  and  early \nrecovery needs. As a result, the fiscal deficit is expected to increase to 6.4% of GDP in 2016 \n(from 5.1% prior to Tropical Cyclone Winston).3 As the recovery spending winds down, the \ndeficit is forecast to moderate to 5.0% in 2017 before declining to 2.9% in 2018 as fiscal \nconsolidation gets under way. \n \n                                                \n2  In April 2016, the government announced a long-planned change to the fiscal year from a calendar year to one that \nruns from August 1 to July 31. This analysis is based on calendar years. \n3  This figure does not include anticipated revenue from the planned sale of public assets. \n ", "3 \n \n6.  Poverty  incidence.  The  cyclone  will  put  at  risk  recent  gains  in  reducing  poverty \ncountrywide. Prior to the cyclone, the incidence of poverty using national poverty lines had fallen \nfrom 35% in 2003 to 28% in 2013.4 The highest per capita damage and loss was incurred along \nthe northern coast of the main island of Viti Levu; the southern coast of Vanua Levu; and the \noutlying Koro, Lau, and Lomaviti island groups\u2014all areas of Fiji which have a high incidence of \npoverty. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that many people have left the affected areas \nfor safer locations, placing increased pressure on extended families and social services in urban \nareas. In addition, poor people across the country face increasing hardship as a result of sharp \nincreases in food prices, particularly agricultural produce. This includes the large concentration \nof poor people living in informal settlements around the major urban areas of Suva, Nadi, and \nLabasa.  \n \n7.  Women  face  particular  challenges  since  deprivation  and  hardship  affect  men  and \nwomen differently. While water, shelter, and food are basic necessities for all, a recent study in \nFiji found that more women than men identify electricity, sanitation facilities, and personal care \nas  being  important  to  their  welfare.5 This  suggests  that,  with  many  homes  substantially \ndamaged and without basic services, women are likely to be facing greater hardship than men \nin the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Winston by, for example, having to collect firewood for \ncooking and difficulty in accessing drinking water, basic sanitation, and sanitary items. \n \n8.  Government disaster management architecture.  Fiji has a strong national structure \nfor disaster risk management. This consists of the National Disaster Management Council, \nNational Disaster Management Office, and disaster management committees at the provincial \nand district levels. The country also has developed a Natural Disaster Management Plan \n(1998), Natural Disaster Management Act (1998), and Standard Operating Procedures for \nDisaster Response (2010).   \n \n9.  The National Disaster Management Council declared a state of natural disaster on 20 \nFebruary 2016.  The government, including the armed forces and police, responded to the \ndisaster through rapid mobilization of rescue, evacuation, and relief operations that provided \nbasic food supplies, water, and medical assistance. \n \n10.  In February, the government, acting on advice provided by the World Bank, made \navailable  $10  million  in  post-disaster  social  protection  payments  to  support  vulnerable \nhouseholds and individuals most likely to fall into poverty. This support was provided through \nthe  expansion  of  three  existing  social  protection  programs  including the  poverty  benefits \nscheme, which targets the poorest 10% of households; the social pension scheme, which \ntargets people over the age of 68 who are not covered by the Fiji National Provident Fund; \nand  the  care  and  protection  scheme,  which  targets  vulnerable  households  with  children \n(single parents, abandoned spouses, death of breadwinner). In total, 44,169 people benefited \nfrom top-up assistance under these programs (Table 3).6 The World Bank is providing general \nbudget  support  to  the  government,  including  support  for  these  programs  through  a \ndevelopment policy operation.  \n \n \n                                                \n4  Fiji Bureau of Statistics. 2015.

Disaster Recovery Framework. Suva \n \n11.  Emergency  assistance  coordination  with  other  agencies.  The  government-led \nefforts were undertaken with strong support  from the international community.  Immediate \nemergency efforts were supported with military logistical assistance primarily from Australia \nand New Zealand but with support also from France, India, Indonesia, and Tonga. As of 1 \nJune  2016,  international  donors  had  pledged  assistance  valued  at  $68  million,  with \napproximately 75% of this being in kind and 25% in cash. Major contributors include Australia, \nNew Zealand, and the European Union, with contributions also from a wide range of other \ncountries and organizations. Private businesses also contributed approximately $5 million for \nrelief support to victims.7 \n \n12.  On  29  March  2016,  the  government,  with  the  support  of  development  partners \nincluding the European Union, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and a \nnumber of regional agencies, initiated a PDNA. The PDNA, through 18 sector assessment \nteams, built on initial and detailed sector damage assessments undertaken by eight national \nclusters (led  by  government  ministries):  (i)  health  and  nutrition;  (ii)  water,  sanitation,  and \nhygiene; (iii) education; (iv) safety and protection; (v) shelter; (vi) public works and utilities; \n(vii) logistics; and (viii) food security and agriculture. The PDNA examined damage to physical \nassets; losses suffered because of change in economic flows; and assessed priority repair and \nreconstruction needs. \n \n13.  Almost half of the estimated immediate damage was private housing. The government \nestimates  that  11,989  houses  were  completely  destroyed  and  a  further  18,380  houses \npartially damaged by Tropical Cyclone Winston. In Fiji, the majority of rural households have \nlimited access to affordable private insurance for cyclone-related damage to  houses and \nlimited access to savings to reconstruct and repair homes. With more than 130,000 people \nliving in temporary shelters, on 9 April 2016, the Prime Minister announced the first phase \n($34.5 million) of the Help for Homes initiative. The aim of the initiative is to improve the \nresilience of the Fiji people to disasters such as Tropical Cyclone Winston by advising and \nproviding assistance to households to \u201cbuild back better\u201d and to a standard of home that will \nwithstand at least a category 3 cyclone.   \n \n14.  The  initiative  provides  housing  grants  through  a  voucher  program  to  people  with \nhousehold incomes below $24,000 (F$50,000) per annum whose homes have been destroyed \nor  partially  damaged  by  Tropical  Cyclone  Winston.8 The  vouchers  can  be  redeemed  for \ndesignated construction materials needed to repair or rebuild homes. Following vetting by the \nDepartment of Social Welfare, eligible households have been issued with e-cards to hold the \n                                                \n7  Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  According to limited available income information (Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2008\u20132009), the \nurban average household income was F$23,000 per annum and rural incomes were F$11,068 per annum. It is, \ntherefore, anticipated that almost all affected households will be eligible to receive a materials grant. \n ", "5 \n \nsmall grant funds. The value of the vouchers depends on the extent of damage to houses, with \nhouseholds eligible for up to $3,300 (sufficient to construct one category 3 cyclone resistant \nroom) where houses have been completely destroyed, and between $717 and $1,435 where \nhouses have been partially damaged. No involuntary settlement of people from their land is \nplanned under the scheme.9 \n \n15.  In  May,  with  assistance from  ADB  and  other partners,  the government  prepared  a \nbudgeted disaster recovery framework (DRF) for Tropical Cyclone Winston. This is the first time \nfollowing a disaster in Fiji that such a framework has been prepared. The DRF highlights four \nkey priority disaster recovery areas and the budgeted costs of disaster recovery over 2016\u2013\n2018: (i) rebuilding homes, (ii) restoring livelihoods, (iii) repairing and strengthening critical \ninfrastructure (education, health, transport, communications), and (iv) building resilience.10   \n \n16.  The DRF (Table 4) estimates the total cost of recovery and reconstruction activities to be \napproximately $434.1 million for the 2-year recovery period from mid-2016 to mid-2018. The \ngovernment anticipates being able to finance approximately $131.3 million (equivalent to 30% of \nthe total program costs) partly from reallocations and partly from fast disbursing financing from \npartners like ADB. However, this still leaves a significant financing gap of $294.0 million for \nwhich additional external financial support is required.  \n \nTable 4: Disaster Recovery Framework Budget \n($ million) \nItem  Total Budget     Government  Donor  Financing \n2016\u20132018  Gap \nPriority 1: Rebuilding homes  88.0  34.5  0.0  53.5 \n    Housing (public and private)  88.0  34.5  0.0  53.5 \nPriority 2: Restoring livelihoods  114.3  50.3  4.8  59.3 \n    Agriculture, livestock, forestry, and fisheries  24.2  1.3  4.5  18.4 \n    Commerce and industry  25.3  4.3  0.0  21.0 \n    Tourism  3.5  0.0  0.0  3.5 \n    Employment, livelihoods, and social protection  61.0  44.7  0.0  16.3 \n    Household and community livelihood  0.3  0.0  0.3  0.0 \nPriority 3: Repairing and strengthening critical  220.5  44.8  5.8  169.9 \ninfrastructure \n    Education  90.4a  34.2  5.8  50.4 \n    Health  14.4  0.0  0.0  14.4 \n    Transport  85.1  1.3  0.0  83.8 \n    Water and sanitation  11.4  0.0  0.0  11.4 \n    Electricity  6.8  0.0  0.0  6.8 \n    Communication  9.3  9.3  0.0  0.0 \n    Environment (solid waste management)  3.1  0.0  0.0  3.1 \nPriority 4: Building resilience  11.4  0.0  0.0  11.4 \n    Culture and heritage  1.3  0.0  0.0  1.3 \n    Disaster risk reduction and management  7.0  0.0  0.0  7.0 \n    Environment (restoration of ecosystem)  3.1  0.0  0.0  3.1 \nTotal: Priorities 1\u20134  434.1  131.3  10.5b  294.0 \na  Initial estimates of education damages of $33 million have been revised upwards based on \n     subsequent substantive assessments carried out by the Fiji Institute of Engineers.  \nb    Amounts committed to date.

The \nbudget prioritizes disaster recovery expenditures amounting to $111.1 as set out in Table 5.  \n \nTable 5: Disaster Recovery Expenditures FY2017 \nSector  Rehabilitation Cost  \n($ million) \nHousing & Reconstruction   10.0 \nEducation   68.4 \nHealth     1.8 \nAgriculture (including Sugar)    6.6 \nFisheries and Forestry    1.6 \nInfrastructure Services  22.6 \nTotal          $111.10 \nSource: Government of Fiji, Ministry of Finance. \n \n18.  Structure  and  modality  of  ADB\u2019s  proposed  emergency  assistance  loan.  ADB \nproposes to provide an EAL of $50 million to assist the government to finance the additional \ndisaster-related recovery expenditures in the FY2017 budget.  The government has requested \nADB financing primarily to assist with reconstructing and building back better 495 schools that \nwere damaged by Tropical Cyclone Winston. Of this total, 219 schools have been extensively \ndamaged and government anticipates being able to rehabilitate approximately 60% of these \nduring FY2017. All new buildings will be required to adhere to stringent standards to maximize \ntheir ability to withstand natural disasters. In addition government proposes to use a significant \nportion of the loan to finance expenditures for the Help for Homes program. This follows a \nrequest by the government to both ADB and the World Bank on 11 April 2016 for fast-disbursing \nemergency finance. In preparing this operation, ADB has worked closely with the World Bank, \nwhich will seek Board approval for $50 million of financing for its policy-based operation on 30 \nJune.11 \n \n19.  The EAL complements other support that ADB has provided following Tropical Cyclone \nWinston, including a $2 million grant from ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. The \ngrant agreement was signed by the vice-president of Operations 2 during a visit to Fiji on 28 \nFebruary 2016 and was disbursed on 29 February 2016. ADB also mobilized $0.3 million from \nthe Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility to bring a team from Tonga Power (with which ADB \nworked previously on cyclone reconstruction in Tonga) to assist the Fiji Electricity Authority \nrestore power lines. ADB is exploring possibilities for financing from the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction to support the recovery effort. \n \n20.  An EAL is considered to be the appropriate response instrument. It is consistent with \nADB\u2019s overall engagement with Fiji as set out in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 \napproved  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  in  November  2014.12 The  EAL  will  specifically \ncontribute  to  achieving  the  country  partnership  objective  of  reducing  volatility  and  building \nresilience. The proposed loan is also consistent with the six characteristics for an EAL set out \nin ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy as follows: (i) help rebuild high-priority \nphysical assets and restore economic, social, and governance activities after emergencies; (ii) \nmitigate immediate losses to priority assets, capacity, or productivity rather than provide relief \nor comprehensive reconstruction; (iii) provide immediate short-term transitional assistance; \n                                                \n11  World  Bank.

Manila. \n ", "7 \n \n(iv) the loan is restricted to the transition phase and is to be used exclusively for priority \nrehabilitation; (v) the loan is linked with and complements humanitarian relief efforts by other \ndevelopment partners to ease the transition from relief to normal development; and (vi) the \nloan may include quick-disbursing components but is not a policy-based loan.13 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n21.  The impact will be disaster resilience enhanced. The outcome will be to mitigate the \nimmediate impact of Tropical Cyclone Winston on poor and vulnerable households. \n  \nC.  Outputs \n \n22.  The  EAL  will  provide  $50  million  in  immediate  short-term  financial  support  so  that \ndisaster  recovery  reconstruction  programs\u2014including  school  rehabilitation  and  disaster-\nresponsive housing assistance programs\u2014are adequately financed within fiscal constraints.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n23.  The government has requested an EAL of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources. The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, straight-line \nrepayment method, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  Based on \nthis, the average loan maturity is 12.75 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to \nADB. \n \n24.  Similar to ADB\u2019s EAL to the Philippines following Typhoon Yolanda, the EAL will use a \nsingle quick-disbursing component equal to 100% of the loan.14 Fast-disbursing financing will \nallow the government to provide direct transitional social safety net support to poor and affected \nhouseholds, consistent with ADB\u2019s emergency assistance policies and as the government has \ndone  to  date  through  expanded  social  protection  programs  and  the  housing  assistance \nprogram.15 This  reflects  the  urgency  of  the  situation  in  Fiji  and  the  need  to  mitigate  the \nimmediate economic and social impacts. International studies show that  rapid response is \ncritical to addressing poverty and restoring livelihoods.16  \n \n25.  Also similar to ADB\u2019s EAL to the Philippines following Typhoon Yolanda, the Board is \nrequested to waive the requirement under the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy for \nsuch quick-disbursing components to finance only a list of identified imports necessary for \neffective recovery assistance.17 The EAL for Fiji is intended to  help finance government\u2019s \ndisaster recovery expenditures, especially for school reconstruction and the Help for Homes \ninitiative. Given the EAL will primarily support the financing needs of these programs, rather \nthan direct procurement of goods, it is not practicable to limit financing to a specific positive list \nof imports. \n \n                                                \n13   ADB. 2004.

The proceeds of the EAL will be disbursed to Fiji as the borrower. The Ministry \nof Finance will be the executing agency. Disbursement and audit will be done in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for \nProgram Loans.18 Subject to Board approval, the government has requested that funds be \ndisbursed in the first week of August 2016, at the start of the FY2017 financial year based on \nborrowing authority gained from Parliament in the budget submitted on 22 June 2016. The \nEAL period is from July 2016 to July 2017. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  The EAL will support the increase in government  disaster recovery expenditure\u2014\nespecially  for  school  reconstruction,  and  financing  of  the  Help  for  Homes  initiative\u2014\nassociated with the transitional relief and recovery efforts following Tropical Cyclone Winston.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  Governance  and  anticorruption efforts  are  core government  priorities.  Fiji\u2019s  annual \nnational budgets incorporate a medium-term fiscal framework that includes 2-year forward \ntargets for overall revenue, expenditure, fiscal balance, and public debt. Financial reports \nincluding the classification of the budget are Government Finance Statistics compliant, and \nthe government works closely with Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre and the \nInternational Monetary Fund on capacity building for budgeting, accounting, macroeconomic, \nand  Government  Finance  Statistics  standards.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.19 The  Strategic \nPlanning Office will provide coordination, monitoring, and oversight for the EAL. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  The incidence of poverty is expected to temporarily rise as a result of the economic \nand social costs of Tropical Cyclone Winston. The EAL aims to help mitigate the adverse \nimpact on affected communities by supporting the government\u2019s FY2017 public expenditure \nprogram linked to key disaster recovery initiatives, especially for school reconstruction, and \nthe Help for Homes initiative. The EAL is categorized as having no gender elements.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  The  EAL  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  the \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  as  loan  proceeds  are  not \nearmarked for specific physical projects. \n \n                                                \n18  ADB. 1998.

The EAL has three main risks that are rated medium. These are summarized in Table \n6 alongside suggested mitigation measures. \n \nTable 6: Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nInsufficient government  The disaster recovery framework (DRF) will serve as a strategic \nownership and commitment  management tool for the government to plan and implement its recovery \nto priority social programs  effort over the next 2 years and strengthen its disaster risk management \nsystem for the future.

Technical Assistance \n \n32.  ADB mobilized technical assistance (TA) to support the preparation of the PDNA and the \nDRF in close coordination with the government and partners. 20 The government has requested \nadditional  TA  from  ADB  to  support  implementation  of  the  disaster  recovery  programs.  In \naddition, the World Bank will provide TA to assist the government survey recipients of expanded \nsocial protection financing and to evaluate experience with a view to designing a more robust \ndisaster-responsive social protection framework. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the EAL shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the EAL, which \nare set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2014.
