I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior loan of up to $20,000,000 to DemirBank for Supporting Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises in Azerbaijan. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY  \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, exposure to macroeconomic shocks and financial \ncrises has undermined public confidence in Azerbaijan\u2019s banking system. Private credit to gross \ndomestic product (GDP) has averaged less than 25% since 2008, indicating a depth of financial \nintermediation far below other middle-income peers.1 Access to financial services is low in \nAzerbaijan,  and  highly  concentrated  in  the  capital  (Baku)  where  86%  of  bank  lending  is \nextended. Azerbaijan\u2019s regions, which account for 78% of the population, lag far behind the \ncapital in access to finance, receiving only 14% of bank lending.2 Compared with emerging \nmarkets in Eastern Europe, the efficiency and stability of financial intermediation are low, as \nwitnessed by high lending\u2013deposit rate spreads and high defaults in 2008 and 2009. Supporting \noutreach of financial services to the regions and improving stability of the finance sector will \nhave major qualitative impacts on the economy and people by stimulating rural income and \nemployment.  This  will  also  support  critical  risk  and  income  diversification  away  from  the \ndominant and volatile energy sector.  \n \n3.  Although rural economic activity contributes less than 10% of GDP, it supports 78% of \nthe population and 38% of employment. The quality of growth is particularly significant in rural \nareas, as it provides major benefits for low-income families and stimulates demand for goods \nand  services  produced  by  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs),  which \nrepresent  the  bulk  of  activities  in  secondary  towns  and  rural  districts.3 The  government \nrecognizes that it needs to stimulate value-adding activities away from oil and gas, particularly in \nthe regions. Stimulating economic activity and income generation in the regions is a government \npriority; it is pursuing rural investments in infrastructure, agriculture, and agribusiness.4 \n \n4.  MSMEs in Azerbaijan are a critical contributor to income and employment with 42% of \nthe labor force employed by small and medium-sized enterprises, and many more individuals \noperating as microentrepreneurs. However, MSMEs have consistently lacked access to finance \nbecause traditional security-based lending practices have not been able to accommodate the \ninformal  information  available  or  address  the  lack  of  available  collateral.  The  European \nInvestment Bank estimates demand for finance from MSMEs in Azerbaijan to be in the vicinity \nof \u20ac3.5 billion.5 Insufficient access to finance has substantially impeded MSME development. \n                                                \n1  World Bank. 2012.

Baku. \n3  Most Azerbaijani enterprises are in the micro and small category. Only a few are medium-sized, according to the \nEuropean Union threshold for large enterprises above 250 employees and business turnover of greater than \nAZN50 million equivalent. Azerbaijan is part of the European Union neighborhood region. The maximum thresholds \nfor medium-sized enterprises under this project are businesses with up to $5 million in annual turnover and up to \n250 employees. \n4  The key elements of the government\u2019s strategy were presented during the Azerbaijan 2020: The Vision of the \nFuture conference held on 3 December 2012 in Baku under the auspices of the President of Azerbaijan. \n5  European Investment Bank. 2013. Azerbaijan: Private Sector Financing and the Role of Risk-Bearing Instruments. \nLuxembourg. \n ", "2 \n \nMore than half of MSMEs face problems obtaining access to finance, particularly at earlier \nstages in their life cycle. In addition, financing vehicles tailored to meet the needs of MSMEs, \nincluding microfinance, are limited in Azerbaijan relative to other countries in the region.6  \n \n5.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) continues to have an important role in supporting \ndeepening  of  services  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  finance  sector.  Since  2005,  ADB  has  provided \nnonsovereign loans of $95 million to Azerbaijani banks, comprising (i) $15 million in total senior \nloans to AccessBank Azerbaijan (ABA), Azerigas Bank, and Bank Respublika; (ii) a $20 million \nsubordinated loan to the International Bank of Azerbaijan; (iii) a $10 million subordinated loan to \nBank Respublika; and (iv) a $50 million senior loan to ABA approved and fully disbursed during \n2013. ABA, Bank of Baku, Bank Respublika, and DemirBank participate in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance \nProgram. The proposed loan would be ADB\u2019s first loan to DemirBank, building on the success of \nprevious loans to other banks in the sector, and complementing the most recent loan to ABA, \nwhich exclusively targeted MSMEs in the regions where access to finance is most limited. \n \n6.  ADB has met with several financial institutions in Azerbaijan to identify suitable partners \nto collaborate with to continue to promote greater access to finance for MSMEs, particularly in \nthe underserved regions. However, many of the banks lack the required expertise and reach to \nservice MSMEs in these areas. DemirBank is one of six banks that participated in the first \nMSME lending initiative of the Azerbaijan government in 2004.7 It is one of the leading midsized \nbanks in the country, and has been successful in transforming its strategy from financing \npredominantly the corporate segment to developing a much stronger retail and MSME focus. \nDemirBank currently has the second largest microfinance portfolio among banks in Azerbaijan \nafter  ABA.8 It  has  developed  the  required  infrastructure  (credit  expertise  and  information \ntechnology systems) to expand its retail and MSME platform, and offers MSME services in all of \nits 33 branches, including its 20 branches located in the regions. DemirBank has developed \nextended outreach in underserved areas of the country, and its MSME portfolio is currently \ndivided with 36% of MSME loans provided in Baku and the residual 64% in the regions. The \nbank plans to open an additional three branches by the end of FY2015, all in the regions. ADB\u2019s \nloan will augment the bank\u2019s MSME portfolio expansion, including its planned expansion in \nunderserved villages and regions. This strategy will allow the bank to diversify its portfolio away \nfrom the highly competitive corporate segment, offering several advantages including greater \nportfolio  granularity,  greater  growth  potential,  and  higher  profitability.  DemirBank  has \nparticipated in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program since 2010, and expressed interest in working \nwith ADB to support its MSME lending program.  \n \n7.  DemirBank has been recognized for its high governance standards, driven by the quality \nand  principles  of  its  shareholders,  management  team,  supervisory  board,  and  corporate \nprinciples  and  policies.9 It  continues  to  demonstrate  asset  quality  better  than  the  industry \naverage. The loan will allow greater access to finance in Azerbaijan, and provides ADB with an \nopportunity to deepen its existing relationship with DemirBank. In light of its targeted MSME \nexpansion plans, its strong regional branch platform to service MSMEs in the most underserved \n                                                \n6  International Monetary Fund. 2012. Republic of Azerbaijan: Selected Issues. Washington, DC. \n7  This was under the German\u2013Azerbaijan Fund, established in 1998 as a joint initiative of the German Ministry for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development and the Azerbaijan government to provide financing to domestic banks \nfor onlending to MSMEs.  \n8  DemirBank has the third largest microfinancing business of all financial institutions after ABA and the Foundation \nfor International Community Assistance, which operates as a dedicated microfinance institution. \n9 In 2010, Standard & Poor\u2019s rated DemirBank as one of the top five banks in Azerbaijan for transparency and \ndisclosure of information. In 2013, the Ministry of Economic Development of Azerbaijan rated DemirBank first for \ncorporate governance standards among 33 companies.  \n ", "3 \n \nareas  of  the  country,  as  well  as  history  of  sound  corporate  governance,  DemirBank  is \nconsidered a good candidate for ADB funding.  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  Founded in 1989, DemirBank is a commercial bank offering corporate and retail banking \nservices. The bank\u2019s core strategy is to expand into the MSME and retail areas by offering \nbetter services to its customers through the use of modern technology. DemirBank\u2019s internal \nresearch and a gap analysis study conducted with support from FMO, the development bank of \nthe Netherlands, show that Azerbaijan has significant scope for growth in these segments. With \nthe aid of the German\u2013Azerbaijan Fund, the bank began developing a core competency in \nMSME lending in 2004, and in 2009 it began developing its own MSME business. It is currently \nimplementing  a  large-scale  capacity-building  project  to  develop  noncredit-sales  skills  of  its \nemployees, with a focus on card business and MSME products. The objective is to attract new \nclients by offering better service than its competitors. DemirBank has invested heavily in a new \ncore banking software (SAP), which provides market-leading tools to identify and analyze target \ngroups of customers. In addition, in 2014 the bank launched a 5-month diagnostic program to \nbuild up the bank\u2019s MSME lending capacity in the regions.  \n \n9.  MSME lending is synergistically aligned with DemirBank\u2019s product strategy of continued \nretail lending, which is backed by growing aspirations of the middle class for consumer durables, \ncars, and housing. As a result, DemirBank is one of the few banks with a wide network of \nbranches in regions other than Baku, which allows it to build on its retail presence and promote \nMSME lending. It is also seeking to leverage the advantage provided by its strong regional \nbranch network by exploring channels to better service businesses in agriculture. MSME lending \nis therefore the core driver of DemirBank\u2019s growth strategy. Since 2009, DemirBank has made \nsignificant investments in training staff and developing the required infrastructure for MSME \nlending to allow a short turnaround time for loan disbursement, which is a key success factor in \nMSME lending dealing with small loans.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n1.  Ownership \n \n10.  The shareholding structure of DemirBank includes the Hajiyev family with 40% (with \nRahman  Hajiyev  individually  holding  19.6%),  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment (EBRD) 25%, FMO 10%; Roman Amirjanov 5.4%, and more than 800 other \nindividuals and legal entities 19.6%.  \n \n2.  Management \n \n11.  DemirBank\u2019s management team has remained stable since 2012. The executive board \ncomprises the CEO and four senior executives. All members of the executive board  have \ngained extensive professional experience working for local banks and finance organizations.  \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n \n12.  DemirBank\u2019s corporate governance compares well with the industry in Azerbaijan. In \n2011, IFC conducted a detailed corporate governance assessment of the bank; DemirBank has \nsince worked to implement the IFC recommendations, including establishment of standardized \nassessment and evaluation tools for the executive and supervisory boards. In March 2013, the \n ", "4 \n \ngovernment\u2019s  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  gave  DemirBank  the  highest  rating  for \ncorporate  governance  standards.  DemirBank\u2019s  supervisory  board  has  five  members  with \ndiversified professional and banking experience. Rahman Hajiyev has chaired the board since \n1994 and has 35 years of banking experience. EBRD and FMO each nominate a director to the \nboard;  they  bring  extensive  international  banking  experience.  The  remaining  two  board \nmembers are considered independent.  \n \n13.  DemirBank has established anti-money-laundering (AML) practices in line with Central \nBank of Azerbaijan requirements, with two employees at the head office responsible for AML \nissues and reporting to the CEO. All 33 branches have an officer responsible for checking AML \nand  know-your-customer  issues,  and  reporting  them  to  the  head  office.  Aside  from  the \ninformation provided by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan Financial Monitoring Service regarding \nscreening of financial transactions, the bank uses other databases for more detailed analysis. \nDemirBank has implemented an AML program to detect suspicious transactions, and also \nperforms manual checks. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n14.  The proposed ADB assistance comprises a senior loan facility of up to $20 million with a \ntenor of up to 5 years. The proceeds will be used to support DemirBank\u2019s plan to increase \nlending to MSMEs, including MSMEs in the underserved regions outside Baku. The assistance \nwill enhance access to longer-term finance for the MSME segment, which is critical to support \nincome and employment generation in the country. The assistance complements technical \nassistance  (TA)  which  has  already  been  approved  by  ADB  of  up  to  $200,000  to  support \nDemirBank\u2019s expansion into the MSME segment.10 Potential areas of TA support are expected \nto include MSME product and strategy development, and internal capacity building as the bank \nrefines its policies and procedures to allow it to better serve the MSME segment.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  DemirBank will issue and administer subloans to MSMEs consistent with its established \nloan  and risk  management guidelines,  and maintain  an  appropriate performance  and  loan \ntracking system. The bank will provide (i) unaudited interim management updates, (ii) audited \nannual financial statements, (iii) compliance certificates for agreed covenants, (iv) progress \nupdates on its use of proceeds for subloans and regional service outreach (including progress \non  meeting  relevant  design  and  monitoring  framework  indicators),  and  (v)  an  annual \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) report. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n16.  ADB will provide stable long-term financing, which currently cannot be raised from the \nlocal market. Azerbaijan\u2019s capital markets are nascent, and public confidence in the finance \nsector is only gradually being restored. Commercial bank funding is not readily available given \ncurrent  market  conditions  in  Europe.  International  financial  institutions  that  are  funding \nAzerbaijani banks are now operating within tighter country, sector, and single investment and \nborrower exposure limits, thereby increasing the need for ADB engagement. More broadly, the \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Promoting Financial Inclusion and Stability in ADB\u2019s Transition Member \nCountries. Manila. \n ", "5 \n \nloan may contribute to increasing public confidence in the banking system, through the support \nfor this growing MSME lender with significant outreach in underserved regional areas. \n \n17.  The  previously  approved  TA  will  augment  DemirBank\u2019s  expansion  plans  into  the \nunderserved MSME segment thereby improving access to finance, allowing it to better serve \nMSME  clients  and  build  more  robust  MSME  service  delivery  platforms.  Through  close \nmonitoring and dialogue with DemirBank management, ADB will also support DemirBank\u2019s \nadherence  to  high  corporate  governance,  social,  environmental,  reporting,  and  fiduciary \nstandards; as well as sound risk management practices. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n1.  Impact  \n \n18.  The impacts are (i) increased availability of bank credit to the non-oil economy, and (ii) \nexpansion of private banking services, particularly in the regions outside Baku. This will be \nreflected by an increase in the private credit\u2013GDP ratio, and increased private credit to regions \noutside  Baku. The  contribution  of  MSMEs  to Azerbaijan\u2019s  economic output  is  expected to \nincrease.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n19.  The outcome is sustainable growth of DemirBank\u2019s MSME loan portfolio. DemirBank will \nfulfill its core objective of prudently serving more MSMEs and their diverse business needs. \nDemirBank is expected to set an example for other banks in deepening its outreach to the \nregions, while retaining good asset quality and funding private business activity in the country \nwith employment and income benefits. \n \n3.  Outputs \n \n20.  The primary output is DemirBank\u2019s financial capacity to service MSMEs is increased. \nThe bank will improve its service outreach to MSMEs, and ensure that adequate investment is \nmade in human resources, processes, and branch infrastructure. The provision of funding to \nMSMEs,  including  regional  businesses,  will  strengthen  their  role  as  important  sources  of \nemployment, especially in poor regional areas. ADB\u2019s continuing technical support will augment \nDemirBank\u2019s expansion plans into the underserved MSME segment thereby improving access \nto finance, allowing it to better serve MSME clients and build more robust MSME service \ndelivery platforms. ADB will also support DemirBank\u2019s adherence to high corporate governance, \nsocial, environmental, reporting, and fiduciary standards. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n   \n21.  Under Strategy 2020 and its midterm review, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the \nfinance  sector  by  supporting  the  development  of  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and \n ", "6 \n \nproducts and services; and by promoting inclusive growth.11 Building inclusive financial systems \nwill be supported through DemirBank\u2019s emphasis on funding regions where productivity is low, \nand the potential for employment and income generation is high. This loan will help DemirBank \nto reach underserved MSMEs, and is consistent with government efforts to promote growth in \nthese  areas,  particularly  to  diversify  economic  growth  in  private  non-oil  activities.  Strategy \n2020\u2019s target for poverty reduction through private sector development will be supported via \nDemirBank\u2019s business expansion in the regions where poverty vulnerability is highest. \n \n22.  ADB completed a finance sector assessment and an evaluation of ADB assistance to \nAzerbaijan in 2012, and country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Azerbaijan in 2014.12 The \nreports highlight the importance of developing private and financial institutions, and the need for \nintensified financial intermediation. More diversified financial services away from Baku and the \noil  industry  will  capture  essential qualitative  growth  opportunities  in  neglected  regions  and \nsectors, and encourage sound risk management. The reports highlight that agriculture and \nMSMEs have inadequate access to financial services, and that lending support via financial \ninstitutions presents the greatest opportunity for ADB\u2019s private sector operations. The finance \nsector assessment specifically highlights the low financial intermediation across all segments of \nthe finance sector and its negative impact on overall economic and social development, with the \nprovision of small and medium-sized enterprise credit lines to individual banks listed as a \npotential area for ADB assistance. \n  \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n   \n23.  Finance sector development is a key focus of ADB assistance as set out in ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Development Strategy and Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy, which identify \neconomic  growth,  stimulated  by  private  sector  investment,  as  a  key  contributing  factor  in \nreducing poverty.13 The strategies note the importance of generating jobs, with private sector \nemployment being the major source of income for workers and their families. The Private Sector \nDevelopment  Strategy  emphasizes  ADB\u2019s  role  in  strengthening  the  finance  sectors  in  its \ndeveloping member countries. It provides that MSME beneficiaries of financial intermediation \nare important employers and providers of income to contribute to poverty reduction. The loan is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s finance sector operational plan and the 2007 report of the Working Group \non Rural Poverty, which underscores the importance of rural finance, and promotes financial \ninclusion of underserved poor households, farmers, and MSMEs.14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2008.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n24.  The loan is category FI for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples. Subprojects classified A for environment and either A or B for involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples will not be financed under this loan. DemirBank\u2019s MSME \nloans are mostly in low- to medium-risk areas such as trade, transport, agriculture, services, and \nlight manufacturing. The environmental impacts due to the MSME lending are expected to be \nsite-specific and reversible. \n \n25.  DemirBank has an ESMS to manage the environmental and social impacts and risks of \nits activities. It takes into account EBRD and IFC performance standards and requirements. The \nESMS  and  the  project  portfolio  of  the  bank  were  assessed.  DemirBank\u2019s  current  practice \nensures that all projects are evaluated against the current ESMS exclusion list and comply with \nnational  and  local  regulations,  and  the  safeguard  requirements  of  international  financial \ninstitution stakeholders. DemirBank has committed to update the ESMS, satisfactory to ADB \nrequirements, prior to the first disbursement. The financial intermediary\u2019s ESMS will include \narrangements to comply with national labor laws and measures in relation to adherence to \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards  (including  provisions  prohibiting  any \ndiscrimination against women in hiring and providing equal pay for equal work of men and \nwomen), in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.16 As female clients are targeted \nto increase, the transaction is classified as some gender elements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n26.  DemirBank was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n27.  The proposed senior loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n28.
