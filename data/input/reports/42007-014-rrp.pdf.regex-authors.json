I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Small  Business  and  Entrepreneurship  Development \nProject. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Improving Rural Small \nBusiness Access to Finance, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n  \n2.  The project will enable women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses to grow, \ndevelop, expand, compete, and play a greater income-generating role in Uzbekistan. Through \nthis financial intermediation loan, participating commercial banks (PCBs) will provide subloans \nto small businesses. At least 30% of the subloans will be to women\u2019s small businesses2 and at \nleast 50% will be to small businesses outside the city of Tashkent. The project will be supported \nby  TA  to  strengthen  PCBs\u2019  capacity  to  provide  loans  to  and  improve  the  entrepreneurial \ncapacities of women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses. The project implementation \nperiod is 2014\u20132017.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The economic significance of small businesses in providing jobs and driving growth is \nhigh in Uzbekistan.3 The contribution of small businesses to gross domestic product (GDP) \nincreased  from  35.0%  in  2003  to  54.6%  in  2012.4 Small  businesses  are  mainly  active  in \nagriculture (98.0% of the sector output). Other important sectors include construction (70.7% of \nthe sector output), retail trade (45.3%), and services (44.7%). In 2012, about 9.3 million people \nworked in small businesses\u2014or 75.2% of the total number of persons employed. At the same \ntime, 37.2% of total investments in 2012 went to small businesses. \n \n4.  In Uzbekistan, 48.8% of the 29.2 million population live and work in rural areas.5 Low-\nincome  earners  in  Uzbekistan  accounted  for  17.5%  of  the  population  in  2011.6 Small \nbusinesses contribute more than 60.0% of gross regional product in 9 of 14 regions, with \nSyrdarya region being the highest (80.0%). The largest share of the total number of employed \npersons is in agriculture and forestry, accounting for 48.3% of employed women and 51.7% of \nemployed men. However, the contribution of agriculture to GDP decreased from 30.0% in 2000 \nto about 18.0% in 2011. Of the micro and small enterprises registered in 2012, 84.5% were \noutside the city of Tashkent, as were 81.5% of all individual entrepreneurs in 2011. Male \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Under the proposed project, women\u2019s small business is defined as being one of the following: (i) at least 50% of \nenterprise ownership is controlled by women, or (ii) at least 50% of managers are women, or (iii) at least 50% of \nthe registered employees of the enterprise are women. \n3  The definition of small business is stipulated in Article 5 of Law N 69-II, enacted on 25 May 2000 and amended on \n2 May 2012, which states that small business includes individual entrepreneurs, microfirms, and small enterprises. \n(Government of Uzbekistan. 2000.

Presidential Decree N328 on Measures for \nFurther  Improvement  of  the  Business  Environment  and  to  Provide  Greater  Freedom  of  Entrepreneurship. \nTashkent). \n4  Government of Uzbekistan, State Committee on Statistics. 2013.

Tashkent. \n ", "2   \nentrepreneurship in rural areas is high in Namangan, accounting for 71.0% of total registration, \nfollowed by the Navoi, Fergana, and Bukhara regions (footnote 5).  \n \n5.  The financial sector is dominated by banks: the banking subsector\u2019s assets accounted \nfor 37.0% of GDP in 2012. Eight banks with state ownership accounted for 76.1% of total \nbanking assets in 2012. The total banking loan portfolio accounted for 21.1% of GDP and \ndeposits accounted for 23.6% of GDP in 2012.7 Lending to small businesses comprised 26.3% \nof banks\u2019 outstanding loans in 2012 and microcredit loans comprised 5.7% of banks\u2019 total \noutstanding loans.8 While small business lending has doubled since 2006 and the microcredit \nloan portfolio has grown nearly fourfold in that period, lending to women was less than 15.0% of \ntotal bank lending in 2012. \n \n6.  Financial services and delivery mechanisms do not meet the needs of small businesses, \nparticularly outside the city of Tashkent. The branch network is limited and rural areas have few \npoints of service terminals, creating constraints for existing and potential bank clients. Cost of \ntransportation  and time  spent  accessing financial  services  are  other limiting  factors.  Small \nbusinesses  have  limited  access  to  business  development  services  that  contribute  to  the \nefficiency, profitability, and expansion of their activities. Focus group discussions suggest that \nsmall businesses lack access to information on government programs, market opportunities, \nsuppliers, competitors, technology, and banking products. Weak financial literacy, especially \namong  women\u2019s  small  businesses  and  low-income  groups,  limits  their  access  to  financial \nservices  and  constrains  their  entrepreneurial  capacity.  Very  limited  financial  services  and \nproducts are adapted to the needs of rural small businesses, which are largely dependent on \nagricultural cycles. Access to electronic banking (e-banking) is low.9 While debit cards are the \nmost developed payment channel, about 70.0% of households do not have such cards, making \ncash their only payment option.10 \n \n7.  Limited access to bank credit and the high cost of borrowing are among the largest \nimpediments to small businesses. The lack of liquidity and availability of capital, coupled with \nhigh perceived risks and high administrative costs when lending to small businesses, compel \nbanks to charge high interest rates. Bank loans usually have short maturities, restraining small \nbusinesses  from  expanding  and  modernizing.  Only  one-third  of  the  total  microcredit  loan \nportfolio of banks is for more than 3 years; the rest has maturities between 6 and 24 months. \nWeak bank risk management capacity restricts their lending, preventing engagement with small \nbusinesses that have little or no collateral. Insufficient collateral also limits the size of loans, thus \nrestricting small  businesses from  borrowing more  for their  business expansion  and  capital \ninvestments. Collateral requirements for small businesses (146.0% of the loan size) are higher \nthan  for  large  enterprises  (128.0%  of  the  loan  size).11 In  stakeholder  and  focus  group \ndiscussions, insufficient collateral was cited as the single greatest impediment to borrowing. \n                                                \n7  Central Bank of Uzbekistan. 2013. Unpublished. \n8  In accordance with the Law on Microfinance, the size of a microcredit cannot exceed 1,000 times the minimum \nwage, which is adjusted from time to time by the Government of Uzbekistan (Government of Uzbekistan. 2006. \nLaw of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Microfinance. http://www.lex/uz). The President\u2019s Decree N4547, dated 11 \nJuly 2013, established the minimum wage level at SUM91,350 starting from 15 August 2013. This brings the \nmaximum size of a microcredit to $43,200 equivalent using the exchange rate as of 16 August 2013 (Government \nof Uzbekistan. 2013. President\u2019s Decree N4547 on Increasing the Salaries, Pensions, Stipends and Allowances. \nTashkent). \n9  E-banking includes plastic cards, internet-based e-banking channels, and payment services provided via terminals \nand online payment systems. E-banking in Uzbekistan is linked to bank accounts.  \n10  Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides a further discussion on \nsmall business and entrepreneurship development. \n11  World Bank. 2011. The World Bank Group\u2019s Enterprise Survey. Washington, DC.  ", "       3 \nCommon  forms  of  collateral  include  cars,  jewelry,  and  real  estate.  Banks  offer  third-party \nguarantors, but they are difficult to find for first-time borrowers as they are often considered high \nrisk.  \n \n8.  The  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  aims  to  improve  the  ability  of \nwomen\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses to operate and expand. It will help these \nentrepreneurs build productive enterprises in profitable sectors, operate to scale, access finance, \nand  benefit  from  economic  opportunities.  The  PCBs  will  benefit  from  increased  long-term \nfinance and stronger institutional capacity, which will enable them to better meet the financial \nservices demand of women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses. It will also enable \nPCBs to (i) provide short- and medium-term subloans in either sum or US dollars to small \nbusinesses; (ii) diversify income sources; (iii) spread risk; and (iv) increase the delivery of \nfinancial services and products such as e-banking, online loan applications, and services to \nsupport  business  development.  The  attached  TA  will  support  project  implementation  by \nimproving  the  capacity  of  PCBs,  their  client  small  businesses,  and  the  Central  Bank  of \nUzbekistan (CBU).  \n \n9.  The project is consistent with both ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy with Uzbekistan \nand government policy. The country partnership strategy 2012\u20132016 and the country operations \nbusiness plan 2012\u20132014 support government reforms to enable small business to be an \nengine of growth, diversification, and investment for the economy.12 Presidential resolutions \nsupport microfinance  development  to finance small  businesses  and raise  employment  and \nwelfare.13 State  programs  include  measures  to  enhance  women\u2019s  role  in  governance  and \nimprove the business environment. The project will build on two previous loans that supported \naccess to credit for micro and small enterprises and job creation.14 It will also build on (i) an \nequity investment in Ipak Yuli Bank to improve banking sector quality, increase lending to small \nand medium-sized enterprises, and help catalyze foreign investment in Uzbekistan; 15 and (ii) an \nintegrated rural development program that provides access to long-term housing finance and \nsupports the building of new houses in rural areas.16 Lessons learned include the need to \nstrengthen  bank  capacity  for  rural  outreach,  the  continued  need  to  target  women\u2019s  small \nbusinesses, and the importance of closely monitoring PCBs during project implementation.17 In \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n17  Under the first Small and Microfinance Development Project, one PCB was discontinued because it failed to \ncomply  with  all  loan  covenants  during  loan  implementation  (ADB.  2011.  Completion  Report:  Small  and \nMicrofinance Development Project in Uzbekistan. Manila). Under the Second Small and Microfinance Development \nProject, one PCB was discontinued for its failure to comply with all loan covenants during loan implementation. The \nunused loan funds under the project were reallocated to the remaining two PCBs. As part of project monitoring, \nADB conducts reviews to ensure compliance with eligibility criteria for subloans issued under the project. Only ", "4   \nconsultations  with  the  government,  international  development  partners,  potential  PCBs, \nwomen\u2019s associations, and academia, the project team found broad support for the proposed \nproject.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  impact  will  be  viable  rural  small  businesses  with  women\u2019s  participation.  The \noutcome  will  be  increased  financial  access  by  rural  small  businesses  with  women\u2019s \nparticipation.18 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The project will have two outputs: (i) strengthened capacity of PCBs to deliver financial \nservices to women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses, and (ii) improved borrowing \ncapacity of women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses. The project loan will finance \nsubloans under output 1, while the TA will support outputs 1 and 2. \n \n12.  Output  1.  Strengthened  capacity  to  deliver  financial  services  to  women\u2019s  small \nbusinesses  and  rural  small  businesses  includes  the financial  capacity  of  PCBs to  provide \nsubloans, as supported by the ADB loan. To enable PCBs to better understand the challenges \nfaced by women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses in accessing finance, the TA will \nhelp strengthen the capacity of PCB staff to (i) design and conduct annual customer surveys on \nthe demand for financial services and their quality, as well as needs for capacity building among \nbank clients, including financial literacy; (ii) assess existing lending strategies towards women\u2019s \nsmall businesses and rural small businesses; and (iii) sensitize and train PCB staff on women\u2019s \nentrepreneurship needs and tailored programs. To better meet client demands for financial \nservices, the TA will contribute to the design of at least two new financial products in each bank \nto target project beneficiaries. To enable PCBs to simplify access to financial services and \nincrease their outreach to rural small businesses, the TA will support the development of (i) \nonline  systems  for  processing  loan  applications  and  e-banking,  and  (ii)  simplified  loan \napplication procedures. To enable PCBs to better evaluate the potential risk posed by lending, \nmitigate losses from bad debts, and increase efficiency in small business lending, the TA will \nhelp (i) strengthen risk management practices and credit assessment standards, including the \nadoption of credit scoring techniques; (ii) adopt International Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRS); (iii) develop monitoring and supervision methodology to prevent loan delinquency in the \ntarget group; and (iv) establish a monitoring and evaluation framework with sex-disaggregated \ndata to track performance, outreach, impact, and achievement of targets and indicators for the \nADB  project.  These  activities  will  enable  PCBs  to  increase  their  outreach  to  potential \nsubborrowers and issue at least 5,000 new microcredit loans and 100 new small business loans \nunder the project.19 \n \n13.  Output 2. The capacity for women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses to \nborrow  will be improved through awareness campaigns and workshops. To strengthen the \nentrepreneurial capacities of women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses, and to \nincrease their access to financial services, the TA will use a training-of-trainers approach to \n                                                                                                                                                       \nsubloans that meet the eligibility criteria will be credited under the project. The review is expected to be completed \nby mid-September 2013. \n18  For performance targets for impact, outcome, and outputs, rural small businesses are defined as small businesses \nin areas outside the city of Tashkent. \n19 Footnote 8 provides a definition of microcredit. Small business loans are greater than microcredit but less than or \nequal to $100,000. ", "       5 \nenable PCBs to conduct workshops on (i) budget planning, accounting, money, and inventory \nmanagement; (ii) business plan development and marketing; (iii) financial literacy; and (iv) bank \nservices  and  products.  These  services  will  help  small  businesses,  particularly  project \nbeneficiaries, build productive enterprises in profitable sectors, operate to scale, access finance, \nbenefit from economic opportunities, and improve subborrower loan repayment capacity. These \nsteps can enable small businesses to have a greater role in income-generating activities by \nbuilding capacity of potential subborrowers and facilitating access to subloans under the project \nfor  at  least  3,000  subborrowers.  It  can  contribute  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of  small \nbusinesses registered from 247,000 to at least 310,000 by project completion. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n14.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $133.3  million.  To  effectively  support  government \npromotion of women\u2019s small businesses and small businesses in rural areas, the government \nhas requested a loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a \n20-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements.  \n \n15.  The Republic of Uzbekistan as borrower will relend the proceeds from the ADB loan in \nUS dollars through subsidiary loan agreements to PCBs that meet ADB eligibility criteria (para. \n22).20 PCBs will provide $50 million equivalent in counterpart funding, and subborrowers will \nprovide  $33.33  million  as  equity  contributions.  Under  the  subsidiary  loan  agreements,  the \ngovernment is expected to relend to the PCBs for 15 years, including a 5-year grace period. The \ngovernment\u2019s relending rate will be the interest rate charged by ADB for the loan plus an annual \npremium of 0.2% to cover administrative expenses and risks incurred by the government.

The government has provided ADB with the (i) reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  funding  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The Republic of Uzbekistan, the borrower, will be represented by the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) as the executing agency. Open Joint-Stock Innovation Commercial Bank Ipak Yuli and \n                                                \n20  Loan allocations will be made to Hamkorbank ($20 million) and Ipak Yuli Bank ($20 million). One more PCB is \nexpected to be provided an allocation of $10 million if it meets eligibility criteria as stipulated under the project. If \nthe potential third PCB does not meet eligibility criteria, the remaining $10 million will be allocated equally between \nHamkorbank and Ipak Yuli Bank.  ", "6   \nOpen Joint-Stock Commercial Bank Hamkorbank will be implementing agencies. ADB has a \nlimited conflict of interest with respect to Ipak Yuli Bank as ADB is a 13.6% shareholder and an \nADB officer sits on its board. Mitigating factors are (i) Ipak Yuli Bank is one of potentially three \nPCBs selected based on a common set of eligibility criteria and confirmed by the government; \n(ii) ADB does not lend directly to Ipak Yuli Bank for this project; the loan proceeds will be relent \nby the MOF to the PCBs, but ADB and Ipak Yuli Bank will sign a project agreement  on \nimplementation  matters;  and  (iii)  ADB  will  not  participate  as  a  shareholder,  and  the  ADB \nappointee on Ipak Yuli Bank\u2019s board will not participate as a board member, in any decision on \na transaction involving ADB. The latter is based on corporate governance requirements of the \nUzbek joint stock company legislation and recent revisions to the Ipak Yuli Bank charter. Ipak \nYuli shareholders approved the bank\u2019s revised charter, which has been registered by the CBU.21  \n \n18.  ADB will enter into a loan agreement with the borrower and separate project agreements \nwith each PCB. Each PCB will establish a project implementation unit within its organization to \nmonitor and report on the use of loan proceeds and compliance with environmental and social \nsafeguards  requirements  and  covenants  in  the  project  agreements.  Implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 2.22 The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time). Each PCB will \nsubmit to ADB audited financial statements.  \n \n19.  PCBs will provide subloans in either sum or US dollars to small businesses to finance \nsubprojects that meet ADB\u2019s eligibility and safeguards criteria. Each of these subloans will (i) \nhave a repayment period term of up to 5 years, (ii) have a market-based interest rate, (iii) cover \nup to 75% of the subproject costs, and (iv) comprise 50% from the PCB\u2019s funds and 50% from \nthe proceeds of the ADB loan relent to the PCB.23 The ceiling for an individual subloan is \n$100,000. Where a subborrower borrows more than one subloan, the aggregate value of the \nsubloans  will  have  a  ceiling  of  $100,000  equivalent.  PCBs  will  ensure  that  each qualified \nsubborrower meets and maintains the following criteria: a debt-to-equity ratio not higher than \n75:25 for the project that the subloan is financing; a debt service coverage ratio not lower than \n1.1 times; and a proven credit track record and other criteria deemed necessary.  \n \n20.  At least 30% of the total number of loans made during the project life will be to women\u2019s \nsmall businesses (footnote 2); and at least 50% will be to small businesses outside the city of \nTashkent. Subloans to women\u2019s small businesses can also be counted as subloans for rural \nsmall businesses provided that the qualified subborrowers are registered or located outside the \ncity of Tashkent. Subloans may be to either new or repeat subborrowers as long as they meet \nsubborrower and subproject criteria. The PCBs will manage their foreign exchange and credit \nrisks prudently by charging appropriate risk premiums, which will be factored into their onlending \nrates for subloans.24 PCBs will independently assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and \ndetermine commercial terms and conditions of loans. \n                                                \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23  Banks will charge market-based interest rates with due consideration to the real cost of funds. If they are found not \nto be doing so, ADB will not recognize such subloans. \n24 PCB\u2019s onlending sum-denominated subloan interest rates currently range from around 16% to 36% per year \ndepending on whether the loan is in cash or noncash, maturity, and use of funds. It includes the weighted average \ncost of capital and a risk premium that reflects the average rate of currency depreciation (10%). The onlending US \ndollar-denominated interest rates of PCBs currently range from around 12% to 18% per year depending on \nwhether the subloan is repaid in US dollars or in sum, maturity, and use of funds. It includes the weighted average \ncost of capital and a risk premium that reflects the average rate of currency depreciation.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n21.  The proposed TA for Improving Rural and Women\u2019s Small Business Access to Finance \nwill develop PCBs\u2019 capacity for financial services delivery and improve  the entrepreneurial \ncapacities of rural small businesses, including women\u2019s businesses. The TA will start in January \n2014 and will be completed in December 2015. It will provide five international consultants for \n10 person-months and three national consultants for 16 person-months to deliver three outputs: \n(i) improved capacity of PCBs to lend to women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses; \n(ii) improved capacity of women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses; and (iii) a \nstronger  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  for  the  development  and  supervision  of  e-\nbanking, including controls related to anti-money-laundering and combating the financing of \nterrorism (AML/CFT). The TA will support a baseline survey for an impact evaluation study. The \nTA is estimated to cost $550,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff,  office  space,  logistical  support,  translation,  and \nfacilitation of the consultant\u2019s timely access to information and stakeholders. The MOF will be \nthe executing agency for the TA. The CBU and PCBs will be the implementing agencies. \nIndividual consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  ADB  designed  the  project  in  collaboration  with  the  government,  PCBs,  and  other \nstakeholders. To ensure a financially sustainable approach to enhancing the capacity of small \nbusinesses\u2014especially  women\u2019s  businesses  and  those  in  rural  areas\u2014stakeholder \nconsultations were undertaken with commercial banks, women\u2019s organizations, international \ndevelopment partners, and the government. The consultations confirmed that a lack of finance \n                                                                                                                                                       \n7.0% according to the authorities\u2019 methodology during this period.

", "8   \namong subborrowers was limiting firm creation and growth, and that demand exists for both \nsum- and US dollar-denominated subloans. After the PCB eligibility criteria were defined, a \nselection process identified potential PCBs from among all banks. Under the eligibility criteria, \nPCBs must (i) meet ADB\u2018s requirements on financial analysis, financial management systems, \nand integrity due diligence; (ii) be willing and able to grow, design, and service women\u2019s small \nbusinesses and rural small businesses in line with the objectives of the project; (iii) comply with \nCBU mandatory prudential standards, and AML/CFT and regulations in Uzbekistan; and (iv) \ncomply with covenants in other ADB projects and/or programs in which they are engaged. \n \n23.  The selection of potential PCBs was undertaken in three phases. In the first phase, ADB \ncompiled key financial indicators for all active commercial banks in Uzbekistan. In the second \nphase, ADB identified 11 banks that were largely in compliance with financial benchmark ratios, \nand sent letters inviting them to confirm their interest in participating in the project and provide \nfinancial data on their benchmark ratios as well as their branch networks. In the third phase, \nseven banks were requested to submit additional information, including more detailed financial \ninformation. During fact-finding on 20\u201328 May 2013, five banks that responded to the request \nfor  additional  information  and  were  largely  in  compliance  with  the  benchmark  ratios  were \nreviewed in accordance with ADB requirements: financial analysis, assessment of financial \nmanagement systems, and integrity due diligence. ADB interviewed the five banks to confirm \ntheir commitment to the project. The banks provided information about their willingness and \nability to grow and service women\u2019s small businesses and rural small businesses. Two banks \nmeet the eligibility criteria to participate in the project. One more PCB is expected to be added \nto the project provided it meets the eligibility criteria as stipulated under the project.  \n \n24.  Based  on  audited  financial  statements  for  2012,  the  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  the \npotential PCBs was equal to or higher than 12%. Their return on average assets was equal to or \nhigher than 1%. Their loan-to-deposit ratio was under 100%; their cost-to-income ratio was \nunder 75%; their nonperforming loans did not exceed 5%; and the maximum amount of risk on \nloans given to one insider was not greater than 25%.25 The PCBs will be required to maintain \nthese financial performance ratios to remain eligible intermediaries.26 The CBU has confirmed \nthat the potential PCBs meet CBU mandatory prudential standards as well as AML/CFT laws \nand  regulations  in  Uzbekistan,  including  applicable  CBU  regulations.27 The  potential  PCBs \ncomply with covenants in other ADB projects and/or programs in which they are engaged. 28 \nSubborrower and subproject eligibility criteria are designed to ensure viability and continued \noperational and financial soundness. The government and the CBU will support sustainability by \n(i) allowing PCBs to onlend ADB funds at market interest rates for qualified subprojects; (ii) \npermitting subborrowers to withdraw sum- or US dollar-denominated subloans in any legal form; \nand (iii) providing ADB with timely, complete, accurate, and relevant information necessary to \nmonitor ADB\u2019s design and monitoring framework. \n \n                                                \n25  Loan and Project Agreements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n27  Government of Uzbekistan. 2004.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 22). ADB\u2019s requirements \nand policies on financial management reporting and auditing, procurement,29 and environmental \nand  social  safeguards  were  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  MOF  and  the  implementing \nagencies. A financial management assessment, including a financial analysis of the potential \nPCBs,  indicated  that  (i)  the  banks  prepare  their  financial  statements  in  accordance  with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards; (ii) internal audit units exist at each bank with an \nindependent  reporting  structure;  (iii)  the  financial  statements  are  audited  by  reputable \ninternationally affiliated audit firms; (iv) formal risk management units exist; (v) capital adequacy \nratios are above regulatory requirements; (vi) profitability ratios are reasonable; and (vii) net \ninterest margins are adequate. Based on bank call reports submitted to the CBU, the PCBs \nwere in accordance with prudential and regulatory benchmarks as of 31 December 2012. These \nbenchmarks  include  capital  adequacy,  liquidity,  loan  losses,  and  open  foreign  currency \npositions. Weaknesses were identified in internal audit, risk management, accounting, credit risk \nassessment and appraisal, and reconciling procedures of project accounts. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  The  loan  supports  poverty  reduction  indirectly  through  its  focus  on  women\u2019s  small \nbusinesses and rural small businesses. The loan will (i) be implemented across regions in \nUzbekistan; (ii) enable small businesses to play a greater role in income-generating activities; \nand (iii) help improve social inclusion, enhance welfare, and deepen economic growth. A gender \nassessment,  one  of  the  project  documents,  is  an  integral  part  of  the  project,  which  is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The project addresses women\u2019s empowerment \nthrough access to financial resources, capacity building, and credit outreach activities.30 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n27.  The loan is categorized as financial intermediation (FI) for environment, and FI (treated \nas C) with respect to involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Subprojects will not be \neligible for financing under this project if they are categorized as (i) A for environment under \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  (ii)  class  1  or  2  under  the  government\u2019s \nenvironmental impact assessment requirement, or (iii) having involuntary resettlement impacts \nor impacts on Indigenous Peoples. Activities on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list in the \nSafeguard Policy Statement are excluded. The PCBs will implement environmental and social \nmanagement systems (ESMSs) acceptable to ADB to ensure proposals for subprojects are \nscreened for environmental and social impacts and (if applicable) mitigating measures are in \nplace. Safeguards due diligence has been carried out according to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements for financial intermediation projects. The assessed PCBs are expected \nto have staff capacity and an established ESMS. Before the loan is disbursed, ADB will ensure \nthat the ESMSs of the PCBs are operational in banks already engaged in ADB projects, or \nestablished  in  banks  that  have  not  participated  in  ADB  projects  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements. ADB will provide capacity building workshops to PCB staff. Each PCB will be \nrequired to designate at least one staff member to be responsible for ESMS implementation. \n \n                                                \n29 As the proposed loan is a financial intermediation loan, procurement will be limited to TA consulting services.  \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
