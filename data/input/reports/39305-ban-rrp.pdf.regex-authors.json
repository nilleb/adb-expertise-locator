An initial environmental examination for the project loan \nAssessment  and  an  environment  assessment  of  the  policy  actions  under  the \nprogram loan were undertaken.  \n   \nRationale  Rapidly urbanizing Bangladesh has one of the highest population \ndensities in the world. Crowded and poor hygienic living conditions \nhave increased the vulnerability of urban poor people to economic \nshocks from ill-health. A burgeoning urban population is only going \nto  make  the  situation  for  public  and  environmental  health  more \nchallenging. Urban local bodies that are mandated to provide public \nand environmental health-related services have limited institutional \nand financial capacities. Nationally, the Local Government Division \n(LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and \nCooperatives (MOLGRDC) needs to take a stronger stewardship \nrole  in  urban  public  and  environmental  health  (UPEH).  The \nGovernment  of  Bangladesh  needs  to  make  use  of  various \ninstruments  at  its  disposal\u2014such  as  regulations,  taxation, \ninformation, and investments\u2014to address the growing challenges of \nUPEH with the help of the private sector and civil society. \n \nA sector development program (SDP) is proposed to address a wide \nrange  of  complex  but  interlinked  UPEH  challenges.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in many ways is uniquely placed to help \nthe  Government  address  these  daunting  multidimensional \nchallenges. The SDP builds on more than a decade of ADB's strong \nengagement in urban development in Bangladesh, and makes a \nconcerted effort to mainstream valuable lessons learned and good \npractices which have evolved from ADB-supported projects, such as \nurban  governance  and  infrastructure  improvement  projects  and \nurban primary health care projects. \n   \nProgram Impacts and  The overall impact of the Urban Public and Environmental Health \nDescription  Sector Development Program (UPEHSDP) is to improve the public \nand  environmental  health  conditions  in  the  urban  areas  of \n ", "ii \nBangladesh,  particularly  in  the  six  city  corporations  (Barisal, \nChittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet). The successful \nimplementation of the UPEHSDP will help reduce child mortality and \nmorbidity by reducing the prevalence of waterborne and food-related \ndiseases, increase productivity by reducing overall morbidity, and \nimprove  the  quality  of  life  of  urban  inhabitants.  UPEHSDP  will \nimprove the health status of the poor in urban areas and assist \nBangladesh  to  make  progress  on  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals  (MDGs)  relating  to  child  and  maternal  health  care  and \ncommunicable diseases (MDGs 4, 5, and 6), and improve urban \nsanitation  (MDG  7).  The  program  and  project  loans  under  the \nUPEHSDP  are  designed  to complement  each  other in  achieving \nprogress towards these key goals. \n   \nThe Program Loan   \n   \nOutcomes  The  reforms  under  the  program  loan  will  help  achieve  the \nsustainable  provision  and  operation  of  improved  public  and \nenvironmental health services in urban areas, including the six city \ncorporations  and  the  pourashavas  (towns  other  than  six  city \ncorporations).  The  reforms  include  (i)  strengthening  institutional \narrangements, (ii) improving financial sustainability, (iii) improving \npublic  and  environmental  health  service  delivery,  and  (iv) \nstrengthening governance and management. \n   \nLoan Amount and  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  equivalent  to  SDR \nTerms  44,895,000  ($70  million  equivalent)  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the program. \nThe loan will have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an annual interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nPolicy measures are expected to generate cost savings of $326 \nmillion, which is much higher than the estimated program budget \nadjustment costs and compensatory measures of about $70 million.  \n   \nEstimated Program  The  program  implementation  period  is  from  December  2009  to \nCompletion Date  December 2016. \n   \nTranches  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  available  for  withdrawal  in  three \ntranches\u2014$30 million, $20 million, and $20 million equivalent\u2014upon \ncompliance with the agreed conditions for first, second, and third \ntranches respectively. The first tranche will be released upon loan \neffectiveness or shortly thereafter, subject to compliance with all first \ntranche  conditions  (expected  before  31  December  2009);  the \nsecond tranche will be released upon compliance with the second \ntranche release conditions (expected before 31 December 2011); \nand the third tranche upon compliance with the third tranche release \nconditions  (expected  before  31  December  2013).  The  tranche \nrelease conditions are set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n   ", "  iii\nExecuting Agencies  The executing agencies will be the Finance Division of the Ministry \nof Finance and the LGD of the MOLGRDC. The city corporations of \nBarisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet will be the \nimplementing agencies for certain activities as specified in the policy \nmatrix. \n   \nImplementation  The  national  urban  public  and  environmental  health  committee \nArrangements  chaired by the minister of the MOLGRDC will meet at least once a \nyear to provide overall stewardship, enable strong interministerial \ncoordination, and ensure greater involvement in and ownership of \nthe UPEHSDP by mayors of the six city corporations. The national \nprogram steering committee to be chaired by the secretary of the \nLGD will ensure that policies and programs concerning UPEH are \ncoordinated and program impediments resolved. The urban public \nand environmental health unit (UPEHU), to be established under the \nLGD,  will  be  the  secretariat  to  the  national  program  steering \ncommittee. The program director of at least joint secretary rank will \nhead the UPEHU and  will be assisted by three deputy program \ndirectors of deputy secretary level for (i) program implementation (on \ndeputation,  preferably  from  the  Bangladesh  Civil  Services  [BCS] \nadministration  cadre),  (ii)  financial  management  and  municipal \nfinance  (on  deputation,  preferably  from  BCS  audit  and  accounts \ncadre),  and  (iii)  policy  reform  and  capacity  development  (on \ndeputation, preferably from the BCS economic cadre). The UPEHU \nwill  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  UPEHSDP  implementation. \nAdditional  technical  policy  personnel  will  be  seconded  from \nministries,  including  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare, \nMinistry of Environment and Forests, Ministry of Food and Disaster \nManagement, as appropriate, or hired from the market. The city \ncorporation UPEH coordination committees will be chaired by the \ncity corporation mayors.  \n \nThe  chief  executive  officers  of  the  city  corporations  will  be  the \nprogram managers. Ward UPEH coordination committees will be \nchaired by local commissioners/councilors and co-chaired by zonal \nhealth  and/or  conservancy  officers  (where  available)  and  female \ncommissioners/councilors,  with  a  membership  that  represents  all \nlocal  stakeholders,  including  informal  settlers.  City  corporation \nprogram implementation units (CCPIUs) will be established in each \nof  the  six  city  corporations.  The  CCPIUs  will  consist  of  city \ncorporation staff concerned with public and environmental health, \nincluding  the  conservancy  officer  and  the  health  officer,  and \npersonnel  recruited  by  the  UPEHU  and  assigned  to  the  CCPIU, \nincluding  a  procurement  specialist,  an  accountant,  and  a  civil \nengineer. Technical personnel from the consultant teams will also be \nassigned to work with the CCPIU staff to help implement subprojects \nand to transfer implementation capabilities to the CCPIU team. \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports \n ", "iv \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use the counterpart funds generated by the \nprogram loan, under arrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support \nsector reforms and meet the adjustment costs associated with the \nloan.  \n   \nThe Project Loan   \n   \nOutcomes  The project will improve access to and use of effective, efficient, and \nsustainable  quality  UPEH  systems  and  practices  in  the  six  city \ncorporations of Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, and \nSylhet. It will strengthen sustainable UPEH systems with improved \nmunicipal solid waste and medical waste management, food safety, \nand  capacity  of  the  LGD  and  city  corporations  for  public  and \nenvironment health. \n   \nOutputs  The project will cover the six city corporations, which cover 34% of \nall urban areas in Bangladesh as per the 2001 census (10.3 million \npopulation  in  the  six  city  corporations  out  of  the  total  urban \npopulation of 31.0 million). \n \nComponent  A:  Solid  Waste  Management.  The  solid  waste \nmanagement component will have two subcomponents: (i) municipal \nsolid waste management, and (ii) medical waste management. The \nmunicipal  solid  waste  management  component  complements  the \nestablishment of a national strategy and planning framework under \nthe  program  loan,  with  infrastructure  investments  to  improve  the \nefficiency of municipal solid waste management services including \nprimary  collection  for  urban  poor,  secondary  collection  and \ntransportation,  and  integrated  waste  treatment  facilities.  The \ncomponent also includes, among others, educational campaigns to \nencourage  the  3Rs  (reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle)  and  source \nsegregation of waste. \n \nComponent B: Food Safety. Under the food safety component, two \nsubcomponents will be supported by the project: (i) food laboratories \nand a training center, and (ii) modern slaughterhouses. Two food \nlaboratories will be constructed, one each in Dhaka and Chittagong. \nThe  Dhaka  laboratory  will  have  an  additional  training  center \ncomponent. Modern slaughterhouses will be established in each of \nthe six city corporations for preparation and processing of standard \nquality meat and meat products and other economic by-products. \n \nComponent C: Program Management, Institutional Support, and \nCapacity  Development.  This  component  will  consist  of  three \nsubcomponents:  (i)  program  management  and  implementation \nsupport,  (ii)  financial  management  and  municipal  finances \nstrengthening,  and  (iii)  policy  reform  and  capacity  development \nsupport. Subcomponent (i) will assist the UPEHU in implementing, \nmonitoring,  and  supervising  the  program.  Subcomponent  (ii)  will ", "  v\nstrengthen financial management and municipal finances of the city \ncorporations.  Subcomponent  (iii)  will  support  policy  reforms, \nbehavior change communication, and pro-poor surveys.  \n   \nProject Investment  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $80  million  (including  the \nPlan   contribution  of  the  Government),  including  taxes,  duties,  interest \ncharges on the ADB loan, and physical and price contingencies.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide SDR 38,482,000 ($60 million equivalent), which is \n75%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nequivalent of $20 million, or 25% of the total project cost, including \ntaxes and duties, resettlement costs, land acquisition, remuneration \nfor counterpart staff, office accommodation, part of the civil works, \nand other miscellaneous costs. ADB will finance the costs of civil \nworks,  safeguard  compliance,  consulting  services,  training  and \ncapacity  development,  project  operations  and  maintenance,  and \nfinancial charges during implementation. \n \nThe financing plan of the Program and the Project are as follows: \n \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n  Program  Project \nSource  Total %  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank a 70.0 100  60.0   75 \nP P \nGovernment of Bangladesh    20.0   25 \n  Total  70.0 100  80.0  100 \n        a Asian Development Fund. \n        PSPource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project is estimated to cost $80.0 million, including taxes and \nduties of $1.7 million. \n   \nLoan Amount and  The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \nTerms  8 years and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Government will \ncontribute the equivalent of $20 million as counterpart funds for land \nacquisition, taxes and duties, part of civil works, and recurrent costs. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  December 2009 to June 2017 \n   \nEstimated Project  December 2016 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Local  Government  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government, \nRural Development and Cooperatives \n   \nImplementation  The LGD of the MOLGRDC will be the Executing Agency for the \nArrangements  Project. The implementing agencies will be the six city corporations. \nThe  UPEHU,  national  program  steering  committee,  the  national \nurban  public  and  environmental  health  committee,  and  CCPIUs \n ", "vi \nestablished under the Program will undertake their respective roles \nand  functions  in  respect  of  the  Project.  The  investment  projects \nunder  the  SDP  and  the  required  technical  and  management \nassistance for these projects will continue to be supported through \nproject funding.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of all goods and services to be financed under the \nProject will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All civil works \ncontracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or more will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works \ncontracts estimated to cost less than $1 million will be procured using \nnational competitive bidding (NCB). To the extent practicable, goods \nwill be grouped into procurement packages larger than $500,000 to \nbe suitable for international competitive bidding procedures. Goods \nthat cannot be grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to \ncost less than $500,000 per contract will be procured through NCB. \nA third-party, pre-shipment inspection provision will be adopted to \nensure quality of goods and equipment. NCB procedures applicable \nto the Project are specified in the Government\u2019s Public Procurement \nRules 2008, (once the Public Procurement Rules 2008 in English \nare formally adopted) and the procurement plan. Miscellaneous \nminor  goods  expected  to  cost  less  than  the  equivalent  of \n$100,000  will  be  purchased  using  shopping  procedures.  NCB \npackages valued at more than $100,000 each will be subject to \nprior review by ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  Project  in \n  accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \n  as amended from time to time). Three international consultant firms \nwill be engaged following ADB's quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures. An international consulting firm will be engaged as the \ndesign supervision and construction consultants (52 person-months \nof international and 308 person-months of national experts). One \ninternational  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  as  financial \nmanagement and municipal finance consultants (15 person-months \nof  international  and  178  person-months  of  national  experts).  For \npolicy  and  miscellaneous  capacity  development  support,  one \ninternational consultant firm will be engaged as program support \nconsultants  (12  person-months  of  international  and  114  person-\nmonths of national experts).  \n   \nProgram and Project  The  UPEHSDP  will  contribute  to  human  development  through \nBenefits and  improvements  in  the  living  conditions  of  residents  in  the  project \nBeneficiaries  cities.  This  will  be  through  investments  and  policy  reforms  to \nimprove public and environmental health, citizen participation, and \npro-poor targeting. The program component introduces specific pro-\npoor  strategies  including  the  issuance  of  entitlement  cards.  The \nproject component will improve municipal solid waste and medical \nwaste management and food safety in the project cities, benefiting \nboth  poor  and  non-poor.  Solid  waste  management  investments ", "  vii\ninclude community-based primary collection services in urban poor \nareas.  A  community  participation  plan  aims  to  enhance  citizen \ninvolvement in project activities through service delivery alliance\u2014a \nmultistakeholder  group  consisting  of  civil  society  representatives, \nresource organizations, nongovernment organizations, community-\nbased organizations, and private sector providers. The community \nparticipation plan will create local awareness campaigns to educate \nand inform the poor on health and hygiene, and proactively include \nwaste pickers into project activities as part of the waste pickers \ntraining  program.  A  gender  action  plan  will  mainstream  gender \nthroughout  the  program  and  project  investments  and  enhance \nparticipation and capacity of women in UPEH initiatives. The project \ncomponent supports MDGs, specifically reduction of child mortality \n(MDG 4), improving maternal health (MDG 5), combating malaria \nand  other  diseases  (MDG  6),  and  ensuring  environmental \nsustainability (MDG 7).  \n   \nRisks and  Public  and  environmental  health  challenges  are  complex  and \nAssumptions  daunting arising from rapid urbanization in a country where urban \ndensity is one of the highest in the world and where urban basic \nservices need much improvement. The scale of challenges and the \nresources that are required to deal with them are immense. Political \nsupport  might  waver,  as  the  outputs  relating  to  public  and \nenvironmental health are less tangible than when building roads and \ndrains. These risks will be addressed through institutional reforms, \nparticipatory  approaches  and  behavior  change  communication \ninterventions.  \n \nThe purpose of better interministerial coordination by the LGD is to \naccess the core skills, knowledge, and professional staff of other line \nministries so as to support and enable city corporations to effectively \nimplement  their  mandates  relating  to  public  and  environmental \nhealth.  This  is  also  to  assist  the  LGD  fulfill  its  role  of  providing \nnational  stewardship  to  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  (town \nother than the six city corporations). However, the interministerial \ncoordination issues are always very sensitive and lead to territorial \nand jurisdictional tensions. This could lead to unwarranted tensions \nand  distraction  from  the  primary  purpose  of  these  coordination \ncommittees, i.e., improving the quality of life of urban inhabitants. \nThis  risk  will  have  to  be  proactively  addressed  by  the  LGD  by \nensuring  that  (i)  any  apprehensions  of  the  line  ministries  are \naddressed\u2014the ministry that has a lead role continues to provide \nthe  lead  on  the  issue\u2014and,  (ii)  through  regular  interaction  and \ncoordination, no duplication takes place. \n \nThe other significant risk of the UPEHSDP is that, being a new \nprogram,  the  initial  set-up  required  for  establishing  the  UPEHU \nfollowed by hiring of various consultant firms normally take a long \ntime. This would not only delay program implementation but also has \nthe potential to delay the Program due to weak procurement and \nfinancial  management  systems.  This  will  be  addressed  through \n ", "viii \nbridging technical assistance support explained further below. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The UPEHSDP by nature has greater challenges than either a pure \nprogram or a pure project, as it has both a policy reforms component \n(program)  and  an  investment  component  (project).  These  two \ncomponents require a diverse skills base. For the policy reforms \ncomponent,  expertise  in  policy,  law,  regulation,  and  municipal \nfinances  is  required;  the  investment  component  will  require \nengineering, procurement, financial management and audit, project \nperformance monitoring, and information management skills. Both \npolicy reforms and investment components will require specialists in \nsolid  waste,  medical  waste,  food  and  water  safety,  and \nslaughterhouses. The technical assistance is an effort to mitigate the \nstart-up delay risks, and enable the Project to start on a sound \nfoundation. \n \nThe technical assistance will provide (i) expert procurement support \nto help the LGD and UPEHU hire the three consultant packages in a \ntimely  manner;  (ii)  expert  institutional  and  financial  management \nsupport to set up procedures and processes to strengthen financial \nmanagement  systems  of  the  UPEHU  and  CCPIUs,  and  mitigate \nfinancial risks; (iii) expert support in municipal financing, institutional \ndevelopment, financial management, solid and medical waste, clean \ndevelopment  mechanism,  food  and  water  safety,  private  sector \nparticipation, pro-poor targeting, citizens' participation, and gender \nmainstreaming  for  policy  reform  support;  (iv)  engineering  design \nsupport  in  waste  management  and  food  safety  to  support  the \nimplementation of the investment component; and (v) limited support \nfor training and local study tours. \n ", " \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram loan; and (ii) proposed project loan, both to Bangladesh, for the Urban Public and \nEnvironmental  Health  Sector  Development  Program.  The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Capacity Development of Urban Public and Environmental Health, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  sector \ndevelopment program (SDP) is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n2.  Urbanization and the Urban Poor. With a density of 2,756 people per square kilometer \n(km2) in urban areas and 843 people per km2 overall, Bangladesh is the most densely populated \nP P P P\ncountry in the world (excluding a few city-states),1 and also has the seventh-largest population. \nPF FP\nBangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace and the country\u2019s urban population is expected to \nreach 89.5 million (from 39.5 million in 2005) by 2030.2 The number of urban poor people has \nPF FP\nincreased from 7 million in 1985 to 12 million in 1999,3 and, according to one estimate, by 2020 \nPF FP\nthe urban poor figure could be as high as 40%\u201360% of the urban population.4 Recent surveys \nPF FP\nhave found much higher infant and under-5 child mortality in the urban slums than in the urban \nnon-slums.5 The child illness and mortality indicators in urban areas are almost the same as in \nPF FP\nrural areas6 and are much worse among the urban poor than among the rural poor. For \nPF FP\nexample, the infant mortality rate in the poorest quintile in rural areas was 87.5 per 1,000 births, \nwhile in the poorest quintile of urban areas it was 111.9 per 1,000 live births; prevalence of \nacute respiratory infection is higher among the urban poor than the rural poor; and severe \nstunting among urban poor children is higher than among the rural poor children (Appendix 2 \nand Supplementary Appendix A).7  \nPF FP\n \n3.  Living Conditions and Ill-Health. The reasons for the poor health of the urban poor are \nweak public and environmental health services, poor sanitation, poor nutrition, overcrowding \nand unhygienic living conditions, poverty, and lack of affordable primary health care (PHC) \nservices, among others. About one-fifth of the disease burden in Bangladesh is associated with \nenvironmental factors. Two of the top three causes of death and sickness are respiratory illness \nand diarrheal diseases. Both of these are strongly associated with environmental factors and \nhave significant impacts on the health of children. The urban populations in Bangladesh live in \ncrowded and highly polluted environments resulting in high prevalence of bronchial asthma and \nother respiratory diseases. Poor sanitation, water pollution, and inadequate supply of drinking \nwater have resulted in the persistence of communicable diseases, including diarrhea (dysentery, \n                                                 \n1  National Institute of Population Research and Training. 2009.

Urban Public and Environmental Health Mandates with Urban Local Bodies. The \nlocal government ordinances entrust the urban local bodies (ULBs) with massive public and \nenvironmental  health  mandates,  which  include,  among  other  things,  waste  management, \nsanitation, drinking water, food safety, and PHC delivery (Supplementary Appendix B). However, \nthere is limited institutional and technical support at the national level for city corporations and \npourashavas (towns other than the city corporations) to implement the public and environmental \nhealth mandates effectively. Likewise, the institutional capabilities within city corporation health \nand conservancy departments are weak. As the urban areas in Bangladesh continue to grow \nrapidly, urban public and environmental health (UPEH) issues are becoming bigger and more \ncomplex. Appropriate national institutional arrangements are necessary to provide stewardship \nto (i) ensure adequate attention is given to public and environmental health issues, (ii) set \nstandards,  and  (iii)  provide  technical  and  financial  support  to  the  city  corporations  and \npourashavas.  Similarly,  the  institutional  capabilities  of  city  corporations  to  manage  these \ncomplex public and environmental health challenges also need to be strengthened. \n   \n5.  Municipal Finances. The resources allocated within the city corporations to public and \nenvironmental health aspects are inadequate. Most of the city corporations and pourashavas \ndepend heavily on central grants to meet their local financial needs, as municipal finances are \nweak. Municipal financing is dominated by one tax source\u2014property or holding tax\u2014which \ncontributes  nearly  two-thirds  of  total  municipal  revenue  receipts.  Even  the  full  potential  of \nproperty  or  holding  tax  collection  is  not  fully  realized  as  regular  assessment  is  not  done. \nUncollected tax arrears, both from private and public taxpayers, are significant. As a result, it \nbecomes difficult for city corporations and pourashavas to provide essential services and even \npay staff salaries. Potential sources of revenue within the city corporations and pourashavas \nneed to be realized so that the ULBs have additional revenue to meet growing urban and \nenvironmental health challenges. Financial management and budgeting in city corporations is \nalso weak, and there is very little consistency in accounting practices. For sustainable public \nand  environmental  health  initiatives,  it  is  necessary  to  strengthen  municipal  finances  and \nmunicipal financial management systems (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \n6.  Legal  Framework  to  Enable  Public  and  Environmental  Health  and  Need  for \nCoordinated Effort. The local government ordinances require the framing of rules and bylaws \nto make, among other things, public and environmental health provisions effective. As there is \nno  national  statute  with  regard  to  solid  waste  management  (collection,  disposal,  and \nmanagement),  making  rules  under  the  provisions  of  the  city  corporations  and  pourashava \nordinances may, for the time being, fill the gap which exists. There are innumerable laws \ngoverned by various national ministries that deal with public and environmental health, the \nimplementation of which directly or indirectly falls under the purview of city corporations and \npourashavas. To make these laws more effective, coordinated efforts are required among the \ndifferent ministries at both national and ULB level (Supplementary Appendix D).  \n \n7.  Solid waste Management. According to the National Policy for Safe Water Supply and \nSanitation 1998, city corporations and pourashavas are responsible for solid waste collection, \ndisposal, and management, and they are to set tariffs, enforce bylaws, and appoint staff. The \namount of solid waste generated by the urban areas has expanded rapidly in recent years.8 \nPF FP\nAlthough more than two-thirds of urban non-slum households dispose of their garbage through \n                                                 \n8 The challenge of solid waste management will become enormous by 2020, when the demand for removal of solid \nP P\nwaste will rise to about 50,000 tons (t)/day from the present figure of about 15,000 t/day. ", "  3\ndoor-to-door collection (41%) or in a bin outside their house (27%), secondary waste collection \nand  transportation  remain  major  weaknesses  in  municipal  solid  waste  management \n(Supplementary Appendix E). However, most slum households (58%) dispose of solid waste in \nopen spaces, where primary collection also poses a major challenge. Few city corporations and \npourashavas have solid waste sanitary landfills and only about half of the solid waste generated \nin urban areas is collected.9 Unsanitary landfills contribute significantly to greenhouse gas \nPF FP\nemissions. In addition to direct adverse impacts on public and environmental health, the growing \nand uncontrolled disposal of solid waste contributes to increasing contamination of surface and \ngroundwater. There is no national policy, strategy, or guideline for domestic, commercial, and \nindustrial  solid  waste  disposal.  With  respect  to  policy  and  regulatory  actions,  the  city \ncorporations and pourashavas need to adopt bylaws and improve capacity to plan and monitor \nthe performance of solid waste services.  \n \n8.  Medical Waste Management. About 36,000 tons of medical waste is generated every \nyear  in  Bangladesh.  Out  of  this,  approximately  7,200  tons  is  hazardous  (Supplementary \nAppendix F).10 Various studies documented that medical waste management in government \nPF FP\nand nongovernment hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic laboratories is very poor.11 There is no \nPF FP\nprovision for proper segregation and collection of waste in the health care facilities,12 and there \nPF FP\nis a shortage of equipment and materials required for the disposal of medical wastes. The \nwastes are frequently dumped in the dustbin, inside and outside hospital premises, or on the \nground within the hospital premises, and they then become public waste. The Government has \nrecently  promulgated  the  Medical  Waste  (Management  and  Processing)  Rules  under  the \nBangladesh Environment Conservation Act, 1995. Under these rules, city corporations and \npourashavas are responsible for the external transportation of general waste, treatment of \nhazardous waste, and provision of land for the proper and final disposal of medical waste. City \ncorporations and pourashavas are to make provisions for collection, transportation, and proper \ndisposal of medical waste, set tariffs, and adopt supporting bylaws to enforce the Medical Waste \n(Management  and  Processing)  Rules.  City  corporations  urgently  need  support  to  improve \nmedical waste management systems to fulfill the mandates prescribed under the rules. \n \n9.  Food  and  Water  Safety.  Food  contamination  and  adulteration  with  dangerous \nsubstances, colors, and chemicals are widespread in Bangladesh (Supplementary Appendix G). \nThere are limited laboratories with the proper equipment, chemicals, and trained analysts or \ntechnicians  to  support  detection  of  contamination  and  adulteration.  City  corporations  and \npourashavas  are  responsible  for  controlling  food  contamination  and  adulteration  in  their \nrespective  jurisdictions.  Sanitary  inspectors  are  employed  to  inspect  food  manufacturing, \nprocessing, and selling premises, as well as to collect food samples. There are too few sanitary \ninspectors\u2014the  foundation  of  the  food  safety  system\u2014(only  68  nationally  to  cover  6  city \ncorporations and 309 pourashavas) and they are too poorly trained (there is no formal sanitary \ninspector training program or certificate of competency). There is only one food laboratory at \nDhaka City Corporation, and it has inadequate equipment and chemicals, and is understaffed.  \n \n10.  Unhygienic animal slaughter, handling, and transportation are significant problems in all \ncity corporations and pourashavas. Animals are slaughtered in open places adjacent to wet \n                                                 \n9 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009.

Of this, nonhazardous \nP P\nwaste is 0.64 kg per bed per day (82%), infectious waste is 0.11 kg per bed per day (14%), and the sharp waste is \n0.03 kg per bed per day (4%). \n ", "4   \nmarkets or on the roadside in areas without proper facilities, sanitation, or drainage. Meat \nproduction and marketing is not organized and is conducted in various places in the city without \nmunicipal control, supervision, or veterinary inspection of live animals or carcasses. All city \ncorporations need to organize, supervise, and control the slaughtering of animals, production of \nmeat and meat products, and the utilization and processing of by-products.  \n \n11.  Water safety is another important issue. Although access to piped water has increased, \nthe quality and safety of water supplied at the end-user point needs significant improvement \nthrough regular water testing and feedback to providers. The Department of Public Health \nEngineering is responsible for providing safe water to the population and having laboratories for \ntesting  water  and  testing  the  levels  of  arsenic  and  other  hazardous  substances  in  water. \nHowever, more samples need to be collected and checked at regular intervals.  \n \n12.  Urban Primary Health Care. Bangladesh is one of the few countries in Asia that has \nsignificant public investments in urban PHC (through the Urban Primary Health Care Project \n[UPHCP]).13 However, public investments need to be increased to match the rising demand. \nPF FP\nMoreover, the current project modes of investments need to be converted slowly into programs. \nThe  national  project  management  unit  and  the  city  corporation  project  implementing  units \nconstituted under the Project need to be institutionalized. Part of the municipal revenue budget \nalso needs to be allocated to the provision of essential PHC to the very poor urban residents.  \n \n13.  Gender and Development. Despite recent gains in the role of women in economic and \nsocial development in Bangladesh, women still remain particularly vulnerable to poverty. In \nrelation to solid waste, it is women who are mostly responsible for managing household waste, \nand who are mostly engaged in informal waste picking and recycling activities for livelihood \ndependence. Few women are involved in key decision-making efforts locally and within city \ncorporations. Opportunities exist to equip women with proper training and equipment to become \nemployed in the formal waste collection and recycling process and in other sectors in food \nsafety and hospital waste management. This would ensure more stable employment as well as \nsafer and healthier work conditions. More efforts are also needed to improve the role of women \nin local project planning and decision making. \n  \nB.  Key Issues and Opportunities \n14.  Key  Issues.  UPEH  encompasses  multisector  and  multidimensional  interventions \n(Appendix 2). To maximize the development impact of health outcomes in urban areas, a \ncomprehensive  and  concerted  effort  is  required  to  (i)  strengthen  municipal  public  and \nenvironmental health governance (including institutions, policy, legal and regulatory framework, \nand financial capacity); (ii) strengthen food and water safety, and improve solid waste (including \nmedical waste) management; and (iii) expand access to urban public, environmental, and PHC \nservices, especially for the poor. Key crosscutting themes would be (i) mainstreaming private \nsector participation (PSP) to improve effectiveness and efficiencies and ensure value for money \nof public and environmental health interventions; (ii) ensuring that public expenditures address \nthe public and environmental health priority needs of the urban poor; and (iii) that the proposed \ninterventions are gender sensitive. The key issues are (i) the multisector nature of public and \nenvironmental  health  in  the  increasingly  complex  urban  physical  space;  (ii)  prioritizing \ninvestments  that  balance  preventive,  promotive,  and  public  and  environmental  health  care \nneeds of the urban poor; (iii) ensuring the existence of strong institutional, policy, legal, and \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2005.

Manila. ", "  5\nregulatory environments for enforcing good public and environmental health practices; and (iv) \nbuilding on the strengths of the private sector.  \n \n15.  Multidimensional Approach. Governments have various instruments to enforce the \n\u201cpublic and environmental health good,\u201d which include taxation, regulation, investments, and \nuse of information. The traditional pure investment approach to UPEH challenges is costly and \nless effective in the absence of strong institutions and effective regulation and taxation regimes. \nStrong taxation can have multiple benefits: it can be a deterrent to unwanted behavior (for \nexample, dumping waste in public space), encourage better practices (recycling of waste), and \nimprove municipal finances. Laws and regulations can prohibit practices that are detrimental to \nthe public good, such as dumping hazardous wastes (medical wastes) by largely profit-making \nenterprises (e.g., private hospitals). With the availability of modern technology at affordable \nprices (cell phones, the internet, television, radio, and news media), the power of information \nhas increased dramatically. However, the public sector has been slow in harnessing this power \nto fulfill its mandates. Well designed and targeted information campaigns have high potential to \ngalvanize public opinion, and enable citizens' cooperation for issues that are considered to be \npublic goods.  \n \n16.  Taxation,  laws,  regulation,  and  information  campaigns  can  prevent  practices  that \notherwise impose heavy burdens on the public sector. Raising tax revenues, using information \ncampaigns, and enforcing laws and regulations require a very efficient public sector, both at \nnational  and  local  levels.  Nationally,  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  needs  to  provide \nstewardship; locally, the ULBs need to assert their authority to discharge the responsibilities \nenshrined in the laws. The UPEH challenges that Bangladesh faces are massive. To address \nthese challenges effectively, there is clearly need for significant enhancement of sustainable \ninstitutional strengthening both nationally and at the ULB level. UPEH also needs significantly \nincreased  financing  of  the  critical  subsectors,  which  needs  to  be  addressed  through  a \nsustainable municipal financial framework. The approach should be to assess various gaps in \nregulation (legal) and enforcement, use taxation and other incentives (policy gaps) to promote \nbetter public and environmental health, and assess the effectiveness of various information \ndissemination mechanisms to promote public and environmental health in urban areas. Given \nthe multidimensional nature of the issue, an SDP approach has been proposed.  \n \n17.  Focusing  on  Key  Gaps.  Prevention  and  promotion  are  more  cost-effective  than \ntreatment after onset of disease in ensuring desired health outcomes. However, prevention and \npromotion  of  health  involves  multisector  approaches,  including  provision  of  sanitation  and \ndrinking water; ensuring environmental health, food safety, and hygiene (including safe disposal \nof solid and health care wastes); and health education. A number of development partners are \nproviding support for different aspects, but the greater focus is on providing drinking water and \nsanitation (toilets and sewerage) (Appendix 3). The investments under this project will focus on \ncritical investment gaps and hence limits to solid waste management and food safety. The \nProgram, however, focuses on more significant gaps relating to institutions, municipal finances, \npolicy,  laws,  regulations,  and  information  dissemination.  To  bring  all  these  interlinked \ninterventions synergistically together, the national stewardship of the Local Government Division \n(LGD) for UPEH needs to be strengthened. This is one of the most important gaps that the \nUrban Public and Environment Health Sector Development Program (UPEHSDP) will address, \nand it will support this by creating an urban public and environmental health unit (UPEHU) under \nthe LGD. \n \n18.  Learning from Past Experiences and Scaling-Up Good Practices. The innovative \nPSP developed under the UPHCP can be further scaled up and utilized in the efficient delivery \n ", "6   \nof other UPEH services. Similarly, pro-poor targeting through a PSP framework implemented \nunder  the  UPHCP  can  also  be  further  scaled  up.  Under  the  Urban  Governance  and \nInfrastructure Improvement Project (UGIIP),14 the Government has introduced performance-\nPF FP\nbased  intergovernmental  grant  transfers  in  selected  pourashavas,  and  these  have  proved \neffective in creating incentives for the pourashavas to improve their revenue generation and \ngovernance.  Similarly,  the  practices  to  increase  citizens'  involvement  in  UGIIPs  have  also \nproved to be successful (Supplementary Appendix H). The SDP endeavors to mainstream these \npractices nationally through systematic programmatic interventions. The observations, lessons \nlearned,  and  recommendations  from  the  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  have  also \nassisted in the design of the Program (footnote 9). \n \n19.  Mainstreaming  Private  Sector  Participation.  Various  organizational  and  fiscal \nconstraints have made ULBs ill-equipped to effectively manage municipal solid waste. A well-\nstructured PSP for municipal solid waste management (MSWM) can bring private finances for \nmodernizing MSWM, increase efficiencies of MSWM, enable cost saving and raise productivity, \nand improve the quality of services. However, ULBs need to change their role from that of a \nservice provider to that of a services facilitator, simplify bureaucratic processes within traditional \nMSWM, and enable performance-based PSP (Supplementary Appendix I).   \n \n20.  Making Public Expenditure Work for the Poor. A concentrated effort is needed to \nincrease access to public and environmental health services by the poor and marginalized \nsectors of the urban population. The major challenge in reaching the urban poor is that there is \nno systematic identification of these people. Hence, the main challenge is to develop policies to \nsystematically identify the urban poor, with the next challenge being to provide the identified \nurban  poor  with  entitlement  cards  so  that  they  can  access  targeted  public  services  and \nsubsidies.  Under  the  UPHCP,  various  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  engaged  to \nprovide PHC services conduct household surveys to identify and provide entitlement cards to \nthe urban poor.15 These successful experiences need to be reviewed and mainstreamed. \nPF FP\n \n21.  Alignment  with  Strategy  2020.  The  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020)16 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) highlights the years of neglect and \nPF FP\ninsufficient investment in infrastructure that has led to overcrowded, unsanitary, unhealthy living \nconditions in the region's large cities. Strategy 2020 states that ADB will be investing in water, \nsanitation, and waste-management systems to improve public health. In addition, Strategy 2020 \ncommits to reducing the carbon footprint of Asia's cities, among others, by supporting municipal \nplanning and addressing a range of environmental problems resulting from rapid urbanization \nincluding water pollution, improving systems for solid waste management, and reducing urban \nwaste. The proposed SDP is fully aligned with Strategy 2020 by improving UPEH through \nstrengthening the national stewardship role; developing capacities and institutional framework; \nand supporting right policies, regulations, and effective investments in waste management and \nfood safety.  \n \n22.  Country Operations Business Plan. The UPEHSDP is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \noperations  business  plan  2009\u20132011 17   which  proposes  that  ADB  continue  supporting \nPF FP\ninvestments and policy and institutional reforms in key sectors including urban infrastructure \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2002.

The  UPEHSDP  will  contribute  to  human \ndevelopment through improvements in the living conditions of residents in the project cities. This \nwill be through investments and policy reforms to improve public and environmental health. The \nproject  loan  will  improve  solid  waste  management  and  food  safety  in  the  project  cities, \nbenefiting both poor and non-poor. Solid waste management investments include integrated \nwaste management for the urban poor. Improving pro-poor targeting is one of the policy reform \nareas under the program loan. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The  overall  impact  of  the  SDP  is  to  improve  the  public  and  environmental  health \nconditions in the urban areas in six city corporations (Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, \nRajshahi, and Sylhet) and in pourashavas. The successful implementation of the SDP will (i) \nhelp reduce child mortality and morbidity by reducing the prevalence of waterborne and food-\nrelated diseases, (ii) increase productivity by reducing overall morbidity, and (iii) improve the \nquality of life of urban citizens. The ensuing program will improve the health status of the poor in \nurban areas and assist Bangladesh make progress on the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) relating to child and maternal health care and communicable diseases (MDGs 4, 5, and \n6), and improve urban sanitation (MDG 7). The program and project loans under the SDP are \ndesigned to complement each other in achieving progress towards these key goals.  \n \nB.  The Program Loan \n1.  Outcomes \n24.  The reforms under the program loan will help achieve the sustainable provision and \noperation of improved public and environmental health services in the urban areas, including the \nsix city corporations and the pourashavas. The reforms include (i) strengthening institutional \narrangements, (ii) improving financial sustainability, (iii) improving public and environmental \nhealth  service  delivery,  and  (iv)  strengthening  governance  and  management.  Appendix  4 \npresents the policy matrix of the Program along with the strategic goals, key targets, and \nprocess for each output.  \n \na.  Strengthening Institutional Arrangements \n25.  Policy Reform Area 1.1: Establishing the Urban Public and Environmental Health \nUnit. A unit for UPEH will be established under the LGD to provide national stewardship and \ncoordination to (i) ensure that adequate attention is given to public and environmental health \nissues; (ii) improve coordination among the different ministries, departments, and divisions that \nhave activities relating to UPEH in the city corporations and pourashavas; (iii) mobilize and \ndirect resources to city corporations and pourashavas for public and environmental health; and \n(iv) ensure enabling policy, legal, fiscal, and institutional mechanisms exist to strengthen public \nand environmental health in urban areas. \n \n26.  Policy Reform Area 1.2: Establishing a National Urban Public and Environmental \nHealth  Committee.  Prevention  and  promotion  of  health  involves  multisector  approaches, \nincluding provision of sanitation and drinking water, ensuring environmental health, food safety, \nand  hygiene,  safe  disposal  of  solid  and  health  care  wastes,  and  health  education.  The \nmandates for these essential health functions are fragmented between various departments of \nthe Government and between the public and private sectors. A more coherent approach is \n ", "8   \nrequired to ensure that the various entities involved in providing public and environmental health \ncoordinate their activities. To avoid duplication of committees and achieve desired outcomes, \nthe existing National Urban Primary Health Care Coordination Committee will become broadly \nbased under the national urban public and environmental health committee (NUPEHC). It will \ncover public and environmental issues by inducting additional members from the Ministry of \nEnvironment  and  Forests  (MOEF),  Ministry  of  Establishment,  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF), \nMinistry of Industry (MOI), Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, and Ministry of Food and \nDisaster Management (MOFDM) and their departments that are responsible for taking action to \nsupport good health and regulate and control unhealthy conditions. The NUPEHC will meet at \nleast annually.18  \nPF FP\n \n27.  Policy Reform Area 1.3: Strengthening Health and Conservancy Departments of \nCity Corporations. The program will support review, reorganization, and strengthening of the \ncity  corporation  health  and  conservancy  departments  to  better  match  the  institutional \ncapabilities to deal with complex and challenging mandates given to the city corporations. The \nrestructuring will take into consideration the need for capacities and skills for contracting and \nmanaging PSPs for public and environmental health services specific to these departments.  \n \nb.  Improving Financial Sustainability \n28.  Policy Reform Area 2.1: Improving Municipal Finances. Municipal finance reforms \nwill be undertaken to ensure that scaling-up of public and environmental health interventions by \ncity corporations is done sustainable way. This will be achieved by introducing measures to \nimprove  the  financial management  of  ULBs, improve  their  tax  revenues,  and  diversify  the \nrevenue sources. The first step will be to improve the collection of outstanding holding tax \n(holding tax includes property, electricity, water, and conservancy taxes), followed by updating \nholding  tax  assessments,  and  then  rationalizing  tax  collection  to  account  for  the \ncommercialization and industrialization of urban areas. The LGD will issue guidelines to the city \ncorporations to accelerate collection of outstanding holding taxes, update assessment of holding \ntaxes, and introduce an industry, commercial, and institutional tariff based on earnings and \nmunicipal  services  provided.  The  LGD  will  also  provide  guidelines  for  city  corporations  to \nmodernize and computerize financial management systems.  \n \n29.  Policy  Reform  Area  2.2:  Introducing  Performance-Based  Targeted  Grant \nMechanisms. Performance-based transfers to pourashavas under the UGIIP have succeeded \nin improving governance and management of pourashavas, including increased tax collection \nand improved citizen participation. The program will support the augmentation of block grants to \nthe city corporations and pourashavas through performance-based grant mechanisms, among \nother things, to link increased UPEH block grants to increased city corporation and pourashava \nholding tax collection and to increased allocation of city corporation and pourashava resources \nto public and environmental health in their respective areas. The LGD will prepare revised \nprocedures  for  block  grant  allocations  to  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  to  provide \nallocations for public and environmental health.19\nPF FP \n \n                                                 \n18 Under the ongoing UPHCP, a national urban primary health care coordination committee was established, chaired \nP P\nby the minister of the MOLGRDC. \n19 The Government mechanism for the central support to city corporations and pourashavas is through block grants \nP P\nand grants-in-aid from the LGD. The grants-in-aid are for specific activities under the development budget; block \ngrants are for general budgetary support. ", "  9\nc.  Improving Public and Environmental Health Service Delivery \n30.  Policy Reform Area 3.1: Strengthening Solid waste Management. The program will \nsupport the preparation of a strategy which (i) establishes objectives, goals, and targets; (ii) \ndrives up standards evenly across the whole country; and (iii) establishes planning guidelines to \ninstruct  and  guide  implementation  of  solid  waste  management.  The  LGD  will  establish  a \ntechnical committee with representation from other ministerial bodies responsible for aspects of \nwaste management, such as the Department of Environment of the MOEF, the Ministry of \nHealth and Family Welfare (MOHFW), MOFDM, and MOI, to oversee the preparation of the \nNational  Waste  Reduce,  Reuse  and  Recycle  (3R)  Strategy  and  to  put  forward  the  final \ndocument  for  subsequent  adoption.  It  will  then  issue  planning  guidelines  which  provide  a \ncomprehensive framework under which city corporations and pourashavas are to improve waste \nmanagement and implement the National Waste Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (3R) Strategy. \nThe program will also support setting apart land for sanitary landfill sites, and construct the \nfacilities. \n \n31.  Policy  Reform  Area  3.2:  Strengthening  Medical  Waste  Management.  The \nGovernment  adopted  the  Medical  Waste  (Management  and  Processing)  Rules  under  the \nBangladesh  Environment  Conservation  Act,  1995.  The  LGD  will  issue  guidelines  to  city \ncorporations and pourashavas for the implementation of the Medical Waste (Management and \nProcessing)  Rules,  which  mandate  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  for  medical  waste \ncollection, transportation, and safe disposal. City corporations and pourashavas will prepare \nmedical waste management action plans in accordance with the LGD instructions. All city \ncorporations will set apart land for medical waste treatment and disposal, and construct the \nfacilities.  \n \n32.  Policy  Outcome  3.3:  Strengthening  Food  and  Water  Safety. The National Food \nSafety Advisory Council, chaired by the minister of Local Government, Rural Development and \nCooperatives (MOLGRDC) as provided in the Pure Foods Rules, 1967, as amended in 2005, \nwill convey and meet at least once a year and take actions as per National Food Safety \nAdvisory Council mandates. The LGD will constitute a technical committee with representatives \nfrom the MOFDM, Department of Environment of MOEF, and MOHFW to prepare guidelines for \nthe sanitary slaughter of animals at the city corporation and pourashava level in accordance \nwith the provisions of Animal Slaughter (Restriction) and Meat Control Act, 1957. The LGD will \nissue these guidelines and advise city corporations on the requirements to modernize the \nslaughter of animals and the handling of meat products. The LGD will advise city corporations to \ndevelop  a  water  safety  plan  to  be  verified  annually  by  the  Department  of  Public  Health \nEngineering. It will issue an order specifying the number of drinking water samples to be tested \nby the Department of Public Health Engineering by unit population and the testing parameters \nand standards. \n \n33.  Policy  Reform  Area  3.4:  Strengthening  Primary  Health  Care  Financing.  The \nprogram  will  support  effective  implementation  of  the  urban  PHC  sustainability  fund.  The \nsustainability fund provides for funds which are raised through user fees at contracted-out PHC \nfacilities and through PSP to be deposited into designated accounts. The funds are to be used \nby city corporations to enhance the long-term sustainability of health care provision. In addition, \na one-time deposit equivalent to 1% of the annual revenue budget of the city corporation will be \ndeposited towards the sustainability fund by city corporations.  \n \n34.  Policy  Reform  Area  3.5:  Strengthening  the  Legal  Framework  for  UPEH.  The \nprogram  will  support  enactment  of  bylaws  that  will  change  public  behavior  towards \n ", "10  \nenvironmental  public  goods  and  encourage  more  appropriate  attitudes.  This  will  include \npreparing  model  bylaws  and  enacting  rules  that  can  change  public  behavior  towards \nenvironmental public goods and encourage 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle). Rules, bylaws, \nregulations, and other legal measures will be supported by the Program to make national \nordinances and laws relating to public and environmental health more effective locally and to \nenable city corporations and pourashavas to implement their public and environmental health \nmandates more effectively. The LGD, in cooperation with the MOFDM, MOEF, MOHFW, and \nMOI, will prepare and provide sample bylaws, rules, and guidelines (as appropriate) on food \nsafety, solid waste and medical waste disposal, and environmental health to city corporations \nand pourashavas to enable them to effectively deliver their public and environmental health \nmandates. \n \nd.  Strengthening Governance and Management \n35.  Policy  Reform  Area  4.1:  Enabling  Private  Sector  Participation  in  UPEH.  The \nprogram will enable PSP by supporting development of appropriate guidelines for PSP in UPEH \nby tapping into related PSP experiences of the LGD in the delivery of PHC services and city \ncorporation experiences elsewhere. City corporations have an adequate enabling framework for \nprivate sector engagement in infrastructure and service delivery. However, this has not been \nproperly  accessed  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  service  delivery.  Clear \nguidelines  will  enable  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  to  expand  the  use  of  PSP  for \nimproving UPEH service delivery. The investment projects have been prepared within a PSP \nframework and designed to produce revenue for the city corporations or to reduce expenditure \nto the minimum necessary, while expanding services.  \n \n36.  Policy Reform Area 4.2: Improving Citizens' Participation in the Delivery of UPEH \nServices. A variety of successful innovations enabling citizens' participation in the delivery of \nurban services have been introduced through the UGIIP in selected pourashavas. The Program \nwill support review of these successful innovations to develop appropriate guidelines for greater \nparticipation of citizens in the delivery of UPEH services by city corporations.  \n \n37.  Policy Reform Area 4.3: Improving Pro-Poor Targeting. Poverty reduction has been \nthe focus of development programs in Bangladesh and measures need to be established to \nenable  the  poor  to  receive  services  targeted  to  support  them.  In  the  rural  areas,  this  is \naccomplished with vulnerable group development cards distributed by the union council chair, \nand  similar  systems  need  to  be  in  place  in  the  urban  areas.  The  program  will  support \nidentification of the poor and very poor in the six city corporations. The LGD will constitute a \ntechnical working group to develop procedures and guidelines for city corporations to identify \nthe poor in their locality and for pro-poor targeting. The experiences gained in pro-poor targeting \nunder the UPHCP will be reviewed by the working group. The LGD will provide guidelines to the \ncity corporations for the issuance of entitlement cards to the identified very poor, and introduce \nmaternal and health care for the very poor in the six city corporations. \n \n2.  Financing Plan \n38.  The Government has requested a loan of SDR 44,895,000 ($70 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the program. The \nloan will have an amortization period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \nannual  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. The loan proceeds will be available for withdrawal in three tranches ($30 million, $20 ", " 11\nmillion, and $20 million) equivalent upon compliance with the agreed tranche conditions as set \nout in the policy matrix (Appendix 4).  \n \n39.  In determining the amount of the program loan, the following factors were considered: (i) \nthe relative importance of UPEH in terms of public spending, (ii) the scope and strength of the \nreform package in UPEH, and (iii) the short- and medium-term costs of the reforms and the \nbenefits and cost savings that would result from implementing the reform package (Appendix 4). \nThe loan amount covers part of the adjustment costs for the measures included in the policy \nmatrix of the UPEHSDP (Supplementary Appendix J).20  \nPF FP\n \n3.  Program Management \n40.  Program Implementation Arrangements. The executing agencies will be the Finance \nDivision of the MOF and the LGD of the MOLGRDC. The six city corporations will be the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  organizational  chart  indicating  the  program  management  and \nimplementing structure is set out in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix K. The NUPEHC \nchaired by the minister of the MOLGRDC will have representatives from the MOF; the Ministry \nof Establishment; MOHFW; MOEF; MOFDM; Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock; Ministry of \nLaw, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs; mayors of city corporations; representatives of NGOs; \nand private sector representatives involved in public and environmental health.21 The NUPEHC \nPF FP\nwill meet at least once a year to provide overall stewardship, enable strong interministerial \ncoordination, and ensure greater involvement in and ownership of the UPEHSDP by mayors of \nthe six city corporations. For UPEHSDP implementation, the apex body will be the national \nprogram steering committee (NPSC) to be chaired by the secretary of the LGD. The NPSC will \nmeet three times in the first 2 years of the UPEHSDP implementation, and twice a year in the \nremaining  years,  to  review  and  approve  budgets  and  guide  the  implementation  of  the \nUPEHSDP.  The  NPSC  will  ensure  that  policies  and  programs  concerning  UPEH  are \ncoordinated and program impediments resolved. The NPSC will have representation from the \nministries and ULBs represented in the NPSC. The UPEHU will be the secretariat to the NPSC.  \n \n41.  An UPEHU will be established under the LGD to provide program support. The program \ndirector of at least joint secretary rank will head the UPEHU and will be assisted by three deputy \nprogram  directors  of  deputy  secretary  rank  for  (i)  program  implementation  (on  deputation, \npreferably  from  the  Bangladesh  Civil  Services  [BCS]  administration  cadre),  (ii)  financial \nmanagement and municipal finance (on deputation, preferably from the BCS audit and accounts \ncadre), and (iii) policy reform and capacity development (on deputation, preferably from the BCS \neconomic cadre). UPEHU will employ women to the extent possible, as per the gender action \nplan (Supplementary Appendix L). Additional technical policy personnel will be seconded from \nministries, including the MOHFW, MOEF, MOFDM, and other ministries, as appropriate, or hired \nfrom the market. A representative from Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division will \nbe involved in the monitoring and evaluation. The UPEHU will be responsible for day-to-day \nUPEHSDP implementation involving (i) detailed program planning and scheduling; (ii) support of \ncity corporation program implementing units in procurement of goods and works; (iii) recruitment \nand supervision of international and national consultants, other technical assistance (including \nnecessary assistance for potential clean development mechanism [CDM] activities), and training; \nprogram  accounting,  including  arranging  for  necessary  audits;  (iv)  disbursement  of  funds, \n                                                 \n20 Policy measures are expected to generate cost savings of $326.1 million, which is much higher than the estimated \nP P\nprogram budget adjustment costs and compensatory measures of about $70.0 million. In annual terms, a net \nsavings of about $85.1 million will be realized, compared with the LGD total recurrent budget of $89.3 million in \nFY2008. \n21 Representatives of development partners supporting UPEH may be invited as observers. \nP P\n ", "12  \nincluding timely submission of withdrawal applications; (v) management of the imprest account; \nand (vi) reporting to ADB on program progress. The UPEHU will be supported under the \ndevelopment budget during its initial years of operation under the UPEHSDP. However, from \nFY2017 the expenditure on core civil servant positions to the UPEHU will be financed from the \nGovernment's recurrent budget.  \n \n42.  The city corporation UPEH coordination committees will be chaired by the mayor. A \nward UPEH coordination committee will be chaired by local commissioners/councilors and co-\nchaired  by  zonal  health  and/or  conservancy  officers  (where  available)  and  female \ncommissioners/councilors, with a membership that represents all local stakeholders, including \ninformal settlers. The chief executive officer will be the program manager assisted by the city \ncorporation  health  officer  (deputy  program  manager)  and  the  city  corporation  conservancy \nofficer (deputy program manager). City corporation program implementation units (CCPIUs) will \nbe  established  in  each  of  the  six  city  corporations.  Each  CCPIU  will  comprise  personnel \nrecruited by the UPEHU, and will include the following: program officer, conservancy officer, \nfood safety officer, procurement specialist, accountant, safeguard and community mobilization \nofficer, information technology officer, and assistant civil engineer. Each city corporation will \nalso assign technical personnel from the consultant teams to work with CCPIU staff to help \nimplement subprojects and to transfer implementation capabilities to the CCPIU.   \n \n43.  Consultants from three firms (program support consultancy, design supervision and \nconstruction consultancy, and financial management and municipal finance consultancy) to be \nhired under the UPEHSDP will provide policy and program support on aspects relating to solid \nwaste  management,  medical  waste,  food  and  water  safety,  institutional  reforms,  municipal \nfinance reforms, strengthening pro-poor targeting and citizens' participation, among other things. \nThe  UPEHU  will  also  anchor  potential  technical  assistance  support  from  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  development  partners  including  the  World  Health  Organization,  the  Food  and \nAgriculture Organization, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency in the areas of water \nsafety and solid waste management. All technical working groups constituted by the LGD as per \nthe policy matrix will have female representation to the extent possible. \n \n44.  Implementation Period. The program implementation period is from December 2009 to \nDecember 2016. The Government will have to complete all conditions for the first tranche \nbefore  its  release,  which  is  expected  by  December  2009.  The  second  tranche  release  is \nexpected before December 2011, and the third tranche is expected to be released before \nDecember 2013. Details of the tranche release conditions are in Appendix 4.22\nPF FP \n45.  Procurement and Disbursement. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign \nexchange cost (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember countries, excluding ineligible items (Appendix 6) and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirement for Program Loans,23 the reimbursement \nPF FP\nprocedure will be used to disburse the loan proceeds based on certification by the Government. \nSupporting import documentation will not be required if, during each year that loan proceeds are \nexpected to be disbursed, the total value of the imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance, \nis equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during that year. \nWith  each  withdrawal  request,  the  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula. \n                                                 \n22  The third tranche disbursement is projected to be at the end of 2013, but the program loan duration is until the end \nP P\nof 2016 to monitor the reforms progress. \n23  ADB. 1998.

ADB reserves the \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds. \n46.  Counterpart Funds. The Government will use the counterpart funds generated by the \nprogram loan, under arrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support sector reform and meet the \nadjustment costs associated with the loan. Further, the counterpart funds will be transferred \nfrom the MOF to the LGD to meet the costs and counterpart funding requirements for implementing \nthe sector reform. \n47.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. The LGD will continually monitor \nthe implementation of the program and its impact, in line with the program framework and outcome \nindicators agreed upon by ADB and the Government (Appendix 1). Further, the LGD will submit \nto ADB quarterly reports until the program is completed. Data from the program implementation \nplan, annual report, audit reports, and auditor\u2019s opinion will be used to monitor the progress of \nthe Program. \n \nC.  The Project Loan \n1.  Outcomes \n48.  The Project will enable the urban population, primarily in the six city corporations, to use \nimproved public and environmental health services. It is expected to result in a strengthened \nand sustainable urban public and environment health system with improved solid waste and \nmedical waste management, food safety, and capacity of the LGD and city corporations for \npublic and environment health. The project will cover the six city corporations covering 34% of \nall urban areas in Bangladesh as per the 2001 census.24\nPF FP \n \n2.  Outputs \n49.  The  project  loan  will  focus  on  improving  the  efficiency  and  quality  of  public  and \nenvironmental health in several areas where additional resources are required to accelerate \naccess and program efficiency and support the overall development of the sector. The project \nconsists of three components: (i) solid waste management; (ii) food safety; and (iii) program \nmanagement, institutional support, and capacity development.  \na.  Component A: Solid Waste Management \n50.  The solid waste management component will have two subcomponents: (i) municipal \nsolid waste management, and (ii) medical waste management (Supplementary Appendix M). \n \ni.  Municipal Solid Waste Management \n51.  The municipal solid waste management component complements the establishment of a \nnational  strategy  and  planning  framework  under  the  program  loan,  with  infrastructure \ninvestments to improve the efficiency of municipal solid waste management services.  \n \n52.  Primary Collection for Urban Poor. This subcomponent will focus on improving the \nservice coverage and quality of primary collection in the urban, underserved poor communities \nto be piloted (at least one in each of the six city corporations). A community-based initiative will \n                                                 \n24 10.3 million population in the six city corporations out of a total urban population of 31.0 million as per the 2001 \nP P\ncensus; according to recent estimates this figure is now close to 40%. \n ", "14  \nbe utilized, incorporating a partnership approach in municipal service delivery. City corporations \nwill  contract  community-based  organizations  and  NGOs  to  undertake  service  delivery \nimprovements with institutional, technical, and financial dimensions. Improved service coverage \nand quality is expected through door-to-door collection, which aims to supplement solid waste \nmanagement  services  provided  by  the  formal  system.  The  subcomponent  also  includes \neducational  campaigns  to  encourage  the  3Rs  (reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle)  and  source \nsegregation of waste in line with guidelines developed by the Department of Environment of the \nMOEF. \n \n53.  Secondary Collection and Transportation. The interface between the private sector \nprimary collection and the municipal-run secondary collection system is the critical factor driving \nthe  performance  of  the  waste-management  system.  Through  mechanization,  improved \nefficiency of the transfer of waste from primary collection tricycles to waste transport vehicles is \nneeded. Secondary or small transfer stations (STSs) serve this purpose. These transfer stations \nare designed specifically for the purpose of improving the efficiency of waste transfer between \nprimary and secondary collection vehicles, and increasing the quantity of waste material hauled \non each long-distance vehicle trip. By designing STSs so that waste can be transferred onto \nstandard freight transport vehicles, more highly capitalized companies can be attracted to the \nwaste business. PSP will increase competition and, as long as standards are ensured, service \nquality and efficiency will also improve. Capacity development of the city corporations is an \nessential part of improving waste-management standards.  \n \n54.  Integrated Waste Treatment Facilities. Investments will be made to develop integrated \nwaste treatment facilities, combining composting, landfill, and other treatment technologies. Five \nlandfill sites are proposed to be constructed in the five city corporations (Barisal, Chittagong, \nKhulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet). Each location has been chosen strategically to attain maximum \neconomies  of  scale  by  being  located  near  both  the  city  corporation  area  and  nearby \npourashavas. The high proportion of biodegradable material in the waste stream means that \ncomposting is an important treatment option. For the purposes of utilizing the CDM, the option \nof landfill gas extraction or composting will be considered. By virtue of their nature, landfills are \nlarge investment projects with minimum or no return on the investment and are therefore \nfinancially unviable. Consequently, they are not operated by private service providers. However, \nan element of cost recovery is possible, based on the assumption that compost generation is \nundertaken from the solid waste or CDM schemes (including landfill gas extraction), and is \nutilized as a revenue source. Ensuring that municipal finances are strong is important for long-\nterm sustainability of municipal solid waste management services, which the Project will also \nsupport. \n \nii.  Medical Waste Management \n55.  The  project  will  support  establishment  of  sound  and  effective  medical  waste \nmanagement under PSP in all of the six city corporations; six medical waste management units \nwill be implemented in the six city corporations. Income for medical waste management facilities \nare the tariffs obtained from the different medical diagnostic centers and health care units \n(hospitals and clinics) based on size and capacity. \n \nb.  Component B: Food Safety \n56.  Under the food safety component, two subcomponents will be supported by the Project: \nfood laboratories and a training center, and modern slaughterhouses. \n ", " 15\n \ni.  Food Laboratories and Training Center \n57.  Two food laboratories will be constructed, one each in Dhaka and Chittagong. The \nDhaka laboratory will have an additional training center component. The existing Dhaka facility \nwill be renovated and supplied with modern equipment; the Chittagong laboratory will be a new \nconstruction. Revenue for the food laboratories will be in the form of analysis tests for both \nDhaka and Chittagong. The Dhaka unit will also provide training courses on food safety to the \nvarious food safety inspectors in both public and private organizations. \n \nii.  Modern Slaughterhouses \n \n58.  Modern slaughterhouses will be established for preparation and processing of standard \nquality of meat and meat products and other economic by-products. Establishment of a central \nhigh-capacity slaughterhouse can achieve this. Central production will enable easier quality \ncontrol and will require less labor for production and supervision. A slaughterhouse will be built \nin each of the six city corporation areas. Dhaka and Chittagong will feature large (type 1) \nslaughterhouses while the others in Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Sylhet, will be smaller units \n(type 2).25  \nPF FP\n \nc.  Component C: Program Management, Institutional Support, and \nCapacity Development \n59.  Component  C  consists  of  three  subcomponents:  (i)  program  management  and \nimplementation support, (ii) financial management and strengthening municipal finances, and (iii) \npolicy reform and capacity development support. \n \ni.  Program Management and Implementation Support \n60.  Consultants will be engaged to assist the UPEHU in implementing, monitoring, and \nsupervising  the  Program.  Consulting  support  will  include  (i)  program  management  and \nmonitoring;  (ii)  detailed  planning  and  design  activities;  (iii)  contract  structuring,  tendering, \nexecution, and management; and (iv) construction supervision. Consulting services will also \ninclude engagement of NGOs to manage some program activities.  \n \nii.  Financial Management and Strengthening Municipal Finances \n61.  The subcomponent will assist the UPEHSDP in substantially reforming and improving \nfinancial management of city corporations and the UPEHSDP, introducing modernized and \ncomputerized accounting systems, and performance-based budgeting. It will use information \ntechnology to enhance financial management, improve tax collection, and expand the tax base \nto strengthen municipal finances. Regular concurrent audits of the UPEHSDP will also be \nconducted  under  the  subcomponent  to  ensure  a  high  degree  of  adherence  to  various \nprocurement and financial management guidelines.  \n   \niii.  Policy Reform and Capacity Development Support \n62.  The  policy  reform  and  capacity  development  subcomponent  will  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  policy  reform  program  of  the  UPEHSDP  and  assist  in  capacity \n                                                 \n25 Type 1 units will have a maximum capacity of around 3,000 animals slaughtered per day while type 2 units will \nP P\nhave a maximum capacity of around 2,000 animals slaughtered per day.  \n ", "16  \ndevelopment. This will include (i) supporting the technical working groups constituted for the \nreforms; (ii) conducting pro-poor targeting surveys; (iii) monitoring and evaluation; (iv) mitigating \nrisks  for  the  poor  and  women  resulting  from  any  project  or  program  interventions;  (v) \nstrengthening legal aspects; (vi) public awareness campaigns (including educational campaigns \nto encourage the 3Rs [reduce, reuse, and recycle] and source segregation of waste); (vii) \nidentifying  and  developing  institutional  strengthening  measures,  training  modules,  and \nguidelines and manuals; and (viii) providing for training. The capacity development will include \nassistance to accelerate the reform program and ensuring sustainability of project investments. \n \n3.  Special Features \n \n63.  Opportunities to utilize the CDM for emission reductions and revenue streams exist at \nthe five proposed landfill sites. Emission reductions from landfill gas extraction or composting \nactivities at the future landfills can be feasible over time. The feasibility of the Project depends \non competent and professional landfill management. In view of the transaction costs, developing \nCDM for a composting project is feasible with larger quantities or bundling of projects. Another \nspecial feature of the Program is to mainstream lessons learned from successful prior and \nongoing projects supported by ADB in the LGD. This will help to (i) mainstream interventions \nfrom project set-up to a program set-up, (ii) scale-up successful interventions, and (iii) ensure \nsustainability of such good practices. The UGIIP successfully introduced performance-based \ngrants  and  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfers  to  selected  pourashavas.  The  pourashavas \nresponded by improving their tax collection and increasing the revenue base, among other \nthings. The Program will support mainstreaming of this successful effort by allocating funds for \nUPEH that will be accessed by city corporations and pourashavas against certain performance \nbenchmarks. \n \n64.  UGIIP also demonstrated that, by providing appropriate forums for citizens' participation \nin municipal affairs, the overall effectiveness of municipal governance and urban basic services \ndo  improve.  The  Program  will  support  the  mainstreaming  and  implementations  of  UGIIP's \nsuccessful initiatives relating to citizen's participation in the six city corporations. Urban poor do \nnot have any identification or entitlement cards, unlike rural poor people. The ADB-supported \nsecond UPHCP (footnote 13) introduced performance-based pro-poor targeting through PSP. \nThe experiences in this project have demonstrated that identifying the poor and providing \nentitlement cards is critical to developing effective accountability of service providers so that \npublic  expenditures  reach  the  poor  for  targeted  interventions.  The  Program  will  support \nmainstreaming of the identification of the poor in the six city corporations, and institutionalizing \npro-poor  targeting  in  the  city  corporation  areas.  The  UPHCP  has  demonstrated  that  even \ncomplex  PHC  services  can  be  contracted-out  through  well-structured  PSP  for  delivery  of \neffective  package  of  basic  health  services.  The  LGD  and  city  corporations  have  broad \nexperience of implementing this PSP approach for around a decade. The Program will support \nexpanding this successful approach to other aspects of UPEH service delivery. \n \n4.  Project Investment Plan \n65.  The Project is estimated to cost $80.0 million, including taxes and duties of $1.7 million \n(Table 1). The cost estimates are based on the three components at 2009 prices. The cost \nestimates are presented in more detail in Appendix 7 (detailed estimates are in Supplementary \nAppendix N). \n ", " 17\n5.  Financing Plan \n66.  The Government has requested a loan of SDR38,482,000 ($60 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund), representing 75% of the total \nproject cost. ADB will finance the costs of civil works, safeguard compliance, consulting services, \ntraining and capacity development, project operations and maintenance, and financial charges \nduring implementation. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. The Government will contribute the equivalent of $20 million as counterpart funds for \nland acquisition and resettlement, taxes and duties, part of civil works, and recurrent costs.

The investment projects under the SDP and the required technical and \nmanagement assistance for these projects will continue to be supported through project funding.  \n \nTable 2: Project Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total % \nAsian Development Bank (ADF)  60.0  75.0 \nGovernment of Bangladesh  20.0  25.0 \n  Total  80.0 100.0 \n                              ADF = Asian Development Fund. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  Implementation Period \n68.  The Program will be implemented over 7 years, from December 2009 to December \n2016. The implementation schedule of the Program is in Appendix 8. \n \n8.  Procurement \n69.  Procurement of all goods and services to be financed under the Project will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). All civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or more will \nbe procured through international competitive bidding. Civil works contracts estimated to cost \nless than $1 million will be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB). To the extent \npracticable, goods will be grouped into procurement packages larger than $500,000 to be \nsuitable for international competitive bidding procedures. Goods that cannot be grouped into \nlarger contracts and are estimated to cost less than $500,000 per contract will be procured \nthrough NCB. A third-party, pre-shipment inspection provision will be adopted to ensure quality \nof  goods  and  equipment.  NCB  procedures  applicable  to  the  Project  are  specified  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s Public Procurement Rules 200826 and the procurement plan (Appendix 9). \nPF FP\nMiscellaneous minor goods expected to cost less than the equivalent of $100,000 will be \npurchased using shopping procedures. Any necessary modifications or clarifications to the \nGovernment\u2019s procedures will be recorded in the procurement plan. NCB packages valued \nat more than $100,000 each will be subject to prior review by ADB. The UPEHU will ensure \nthat  procurement  complies  with  the  applicable  procedures.  Specifically,  the  UPEHU  will  (i) \ndetermine bid packages and propose procurement methods, as approved by ADB; (ii) \nprepare detailed material lists and specifications; and (iii) evaluate bids and award contracts. The \nUPEHU will annually update the procurement plan, which details indicative packages to \nbe funded under the Project, and submit it to ADB for approval.  \n \n9.  Consulting Services \n \n70.  Consultants will be selected and engaged under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Supplementary \nAppendix O provides the outline terms of reference of the three international consultant firms to \nbe  hired.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  as  the  design  supervision  and \nconstruction consultant (52 person-months of international and 308 person-months of national \nexperts) following ADB's quality- and cost-based selection procedures with a quality\u2013cost ratio \nof 80:20. The consultants will be based in the UPEHU (Dhaka) and the six city corporations, and \nwill assist the UPEHU and CCPIUs in managing the investment projects, preparing the detailed \n                                                 \n26 Once the Public Procurement Regulations 2008 in English are formally adopted. \nP P", " 19\ndesign,  supervising  the  works,  ensuring  the  technical  quality  of  design  and  construction, \nensuring social safeguard standards are met, and procurement including enabling private sector \nparticipation.  The  design  supervision  and  construction  consultant  will  include  specialists  in \nprocurement and resettlement and social safeguards, engineers (waste management, foods \nsafety, electrical, mechanical, and structural), and architects. \n \n71.  Similarly, one international consulting firm will be engaged as financial management and \nmunicipal finance consultant (15 person-months of international and 178 person-months of \nnational experts) following ADB's quality- and cost-based selection procedures. The financial \nmanagement and municipal finance consultant will assist the UPEHU and CCPIUs (i) improve \nthe financial management processes and systems of the project; (ii) conduct concurrent audits \nto  make  sure  that  financial  management  and  procurement  procedures  and  anticorruption \nmeasures are strictly adhered to; (iii) conduct analysis of municipal finance and provide support \non the implementation of the policy reforms relating to municipal finance including developing \nperformance-based grant mechanisms, assessing and monitoring progress on collection of tax \ndues, and assisting in expanding the scope of municipal taxes; (iv) computerize the financial \nmanagement  systems  of  the  six  city  corporations  and  develop  web-based  applications  to \nenhance transparency in municipal finance functions; and (v) provide training for the staff of the \nUPEHU, CCPIU, and city corporations in modern financial management systems and computer \nskills relating to financial management. \n \n72.  For policy and miscellaneous capacity development support, one international consultant \nfirm will be engaged as program support consultant (12 person-months of international and 114 \nperson-months of national experts). The program support consultant will assist in program and \nproject monitoring and evaluation, policy reform support, pro-poor surveys, training and capacity \ndevelopment, behavior change communication, legal support, human resource development, \ngender mainstreaming, citizens' participation, and resettlement and rehabilitation, among other \nthings (see Supplementary Appendix O for the composition and outline terms of reference of the \nthree consultant firms). In addition, the UPEHU will hire individual national consultants (30 \nperson-months) on an as-needs basis. \n \n10.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n73.  To expedite implementation, the Government requested advance actions for recruitment \nof consultants and procurement of goods and civil works. Management approved advance \ncontracting, and retroactive financing of eligible expenditures of up to 20% of the project loan, \nprovided that expenditures were incurred (i) in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines, \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, and safeguard policies; and (ii) during the 12 months \npreceding the date of signing of the loan agreements. The Government was informed that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing did not commit ADB to finance the \nProject.  \n \n11.  Disbursement Arrangements \n74.  Disbursements of the loan proceeds will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account will be \nopened at the Bangladesh Bank in the name of the UPEHSDP. The account will be established, \nmanaged, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The imprest \naccount ceiling will be 10% of the loan or the forecast expenditure for the next 6 months, \nwhichever is lower. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures will be used to reimburse, \n ", "20  \nreplenish, and liquidate the imprest account for eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 \nper payment by the UPEHU (CCPIUs will submit full supporting documents to the UPEHU). \n75.  Funds Flow. The advance from the imprest account will be deposited in a bank account \nto be maintained in a reputable commercial bank and used for ADB's portion of eligible costs of \nthe Project. The Government counterpart contribution will be deposited in a separate bank \naccount. The UPEHU will disburse most project expenditures from these accounts. In addition, \n6 second generation imprest accounts (operating accounts) for the ADB loan account only will \nbe opened, one in each CCPIU of the six city corporations, for disbursement of funds to pay for \nADB\u2019s portion of the eligible project costs. Disbursement will be delegated to the CCPIUs for \nADB\u2019s  share  of  civil  works  expenditures.  The  CCPIUs  will  effect  Government  counterpart \ndisbursements through a separate bank account (Supplementary Appendix P).  \n \n12.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n76.  The Government will maintain records and accounts to identify all goods and services \nfinanced by the loan proceeds. The UPEHU will be responsible for maintaining the records, and \nwill submit annual accounts and financial statements to the MOF and ADB. The Government will \nensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually, in accordance with auditing \nstandards acceptable to ADB, by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. Not later \nthan 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, the UPEHU will provide ADB with certified \ncopies of audited accounts and financial statements, as well as the report of the auditor. The \nimprest accounts and statement of expenditure records will be audited annually and a separate \naudit opinion will be provided. The UPEHU will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit \nthem to ADB and the LGD within 20 days of the end of the applicable period. The reports will \nbe  prepared  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  include  (i)  project  progress  in  city \ncorporations and components, (ii) status of institutional development activities, (iii) delays and \nproblems encountered and actions taken to resolve them, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, \nand (v) expected progress during the next 6 months. Within 3 months of the project\u2019s physical \ncompletion, the UPEHU will prepare and submit to ADB through the Government a project \ncompletion report, including costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n13.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n77.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government and the executing agencies. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nSDP. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the SDP. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the SDP shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the executing agencies and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the SDP. \n78.  The  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency.  The  project  will  (i)  build  the \ncapacity of executing agencies to comply with ADB and Government procedures, to be outlined \nin  the  Project  Administration  Manual  during  the  early  stage  of  the  implementation;  (ii) \nestablish  a  project  website  to  disclose  information  about  project  implementation;  and  (iii) \nestablish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure greater accountability. The project website \nwill  provide  updated  detailed  information  on  project  implementation.  For  example,  the ", " 21\nwebsite will include procurement-related information, such as the list of participating bidders, \nname of the winning bidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of contract \nawarded, and the list of goods and/or services procured. The grievance redress mechanism will be \nset up to receive and resolve complaints, as well as to act upon stakeholders\u2019 reports of \nirregularities  on  project-related matters, including grievances concerning resettlement. The \nexecuting  agency  will  widely  publicize  the  existence  of  this  mechanism  to  ensure  that \nstakeholders are aware that a venue is available to address concerns or grievances relating to \nfraud,  corruption,  abuse,  and  any  other  aspects  of  project  implementation.  In  addition,  the \nfinancial  management  and  municipal  finance  consultant  support  has  provision  for  continuous \nconcurrent audit to identify and stop deviations from set procedures.  \n \n14.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n79.  The  UPEHU  will  ensure  that  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation \nacceptable to ADB is carried out to (i) examine the project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) evaluate \nthe delivery of planned facilities, (iii) assess the achievement of the project objectives, and (iv) \nmeasure  the  Project\u2019s  social  and  economic  benefits.  The  UPEHU  and  program  support \nconsultant, in consultation with stakeholders and ADB, will develop a set of project performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation indicators at  the  start of the Program.  Indicators  might  include \nindicators relating to status of solid waste management, medical waste, and food safety; the \nnumber of participants in awareness campaigns and community participation; the incidence of \nwaterborne diseases; improvements in municipal finance; the effectiveness of policy reforms; \nand the impact on poor people and women, among other things. \n80.  The UPEHU will conduct baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys. It will submit \na detailed implementation plan for monitoring performance and for preparing benchmark \ninformation for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 1 year of loan effectiveness. The UPEHU \nwill prepare annual project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation reports, which will be \nsubmitted to ADB throughout project implementation. Monitoring of implementation performance \nwill  integrate  physical  and  financial  aspects.  During  and  after  project  implementation,  the \nprogram support consultant will assist the UPEHU in measuring the beneficial impacts, and in \nassessing whether the project facilities are managed efficiently and the benefits reach the \ntargeted groups. Biannual joint review of the UPEHSDP will be held by the Government and \nADB. A comprehensive midterm review of the UPEHSDP will be held in 2013 before the release \nof the third tranche.  \n \n15.  Project Review \n \n81.  Individual investment projects will also be under the review of the Program Inception \nMission comprising ADB and UPEHU staff who will be fielded shortly after the project loan \nbecomes effective. For the individual investment projects it will also be relevant for the yearly \nproject review missions to (i) monitor progress of project implementation, (ii) identify areas of \nconcern, and (iii) suggest remedial actions. Similarly, the comprehensive midterm review of \nprogram performance will be conducted to identify problems and constraints encountered during \nthe first half of the program and project components and to adjust the design and the project \nframework or take remedial actions as required. Technical or budgetary changes to the Program \nbased on the results of the program performance monitoring system will be considered, as will \nadditional activities, or expansion of activities and sites for the remaining program period. \n \n \n \n ", "22  \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \n82.  One of the most significant risks of the UPEHSDP is that, being a new program, the \ninitial set-up required for establishing the UPEHU followed by hiring of various consultant firms \nwould take a long time. This would not only delay the program implementation, but also has the \npotential to delay the Program due to weak procurement and financial management systems. \nThe UPEHSDP by nature has greater challenges than either a pure program or a pure project \nwould, as it has both a policy reforms component (program) and an investment component \n(project). These two components require a diverse skills base. For the policy reform component, \nexpertise  in  policy,  law,  regulation,  and  municipal  finances  are  required;  the  investment \ncomponent  will  require  procurement,  financial  management  and  audit,  project  performance \nmonitoring, and information management skills. Both policy reform and investment components \nwill  require  specialists  in  solid  waste,  medical  waste,  food  and  water  safety,  and \nslaughterhouses. The capacity development technical assistance is an effort to mitigate the \nstart-up delay risks, and enable the project to start on a sound foundation.  \n \nA.  Objectives and Purpose \n83.  The objective of the technical assistance is to (i) help overcome the start-up delays \ninherent in a new program by providing high-quality consultant support to undertake critical \nadvance  activities  and  set  up  systems  and  procedures  in  the  newly  created  UPEHU  and \nCCPIUs; and (ii) provide advisory capacity development assistance to the Government for \nUPEH at both the national and city corporation level. This will include assistance at the LGD and \nUPEHU  in  preparing  and  implementing  key  policy  reforms  (Appendix  10).  The  technical \nassistance outcomes will be to provide (i) expert procurement support to help the LGD and \nUPEHU in hiring the three consultant packages in a timely manner; (ii) expert institutional and \nfinancial management support to set up procedures and processes for smooth functioning of the \nUPEHU and CCPIUs, especially with regard to anticorruption; (iii) expert support in municipal \nfinancing, institutional development, financial management, solid and medical waste, CDM, food \nand water safety, PSP, pro-poor targeting, citizens participation, and gender mainstreaming for \npolicy  reform  support  (Supplementary  Appendix  O  has  detailed  terms  of  reference  of \nconsultants); (iv) engineering design support in waste management and food safety to support \nthe implementation of the investment component; and (v) limited support for training and local \nstudy tours.  \n \nB.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n84.  The  total  cost  of  the  capacity  development  technical  assistance  is  estimated  at \n$625,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, \ncovering all the foreign exchange costs and part of the local costs. ADB will finance $500,000 \nequivalent,  on  a  grant  basis,  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund-IV  funding \nprogram. The proposed Government in-kind contribution of $125,000 equivalent will cover office \ncosts, conference venues, and counterpart staff remuneration. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n85.   The LGD will be the executing agency for the technical assistance (TA) and the UPEHU \nwill be the implementing agency. The program director of the UPEHSDP will be the TA project \ndirector, and the NPSC of the UPEHSDP will provide overall guidance to TA implementation. \nThe TA is expected to commence as soon as the Project is approved by ADB\u2019s Board by 1 ", " 23\nDecember 2009 and will be completed by 31 December 2011. Disbursements under the TA will \nbe made in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.27\nPF FP \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \n \nA.  Poverty Reduction and Social Development \n \n86.  The SDP will contribute to human development through improvements in the living \nconditions of residents in the project cities. This will be achieved through investments and policy \nreform to improve public and environmental health, citizen participation, and pro-poor targeting. \nThe Program component introduces specific pro-poor and gender-sensitive strategies, including \nthe issuance of entitlement cards coupled with free maternal and child health care services. The \nProject component will improve municipal solid waste and medical waste management, and \nfood safety in the project cities benefiting both poor and non-poor. Solid waste management \ninvestments  include  community-based  primary  collection  services  in  urban  poor  areas.  A \ncommunity participation plan (Supplementary Appendix Q) aims to enhance citizen involvement \nin project activities through service delivery alliance\u2014a multistakeholder group consisting of civil \nrepresentatives,  resource  organizations,  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations,  and \nprivate  sector  providers.  The  community  participation  plan  will  create  local  awareness \ncampaigns to educate and inform the poor on health and hygiene, and proactively include waste \npickers into project activities as part of the waste pickers' training program. A gender action plan \n(Supplementary  Appendix  L)  will  mainstream  gender  throughout  the  program  and  project \ninvestments and enhance participation and capacity of women in UPEH initiatives. The Project \ncomponent supports MDGs, specifically reducing child mortality (MDG 4), improving maternal \nhealth (MDG 5), combating malaria and other diseases (MDG 6), and ensuring environmental \nsustainability (MDG 7). The Project components will cover six city populations (estimated at \nabout one-third of the total population) and specifically target the urban poor. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11.    \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n \n1.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n87.  The subprojects are expected to have limited involuntary resettlement impacts. Since \nsubprojects  will  be  undertaken  in  several  locations,  and  the  resettlement  impacts  of  each \nsubproject at present are not known, a resettlement framework with a detailed entitlement \nmatrix has been formulated. It is based on ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and \nthe Government's Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance of 1982 (as \namended in 1993 and 1994). The resettlement framework will guide the LGD in formulating \nappropriate  resettlement  plans  for  subprojects  with  resettlement  impacts.  The  resettlement \nframework is in Supplementary Appendix R.28 The subprojects are designed to avoid, or at least \nPF FP\nminimize, land acquisition and other resettlement impacts. In this regard, city corporations will, \nto the extent possible, use vacant government land and vacant lands available at the existing \nintegrated waste treatment, medical waste management, food laboratory, and training centers; \nslaughterhouses; and secondary transfer stations. Moreover, the city corporations will conduct \nextensive consultations with affected communities to obtain their broad consent for selected \nsubproject sites. The subproject activities will be planned in such a manner that they will not \naffect  houses  or  other  private  structures.  During  the  detailed  design  and  subproject \nimplementation phases, further actions will be taken by the LGD to reduce the requirement for \n                                                 \n27 ADB. 2008.

Of the sample subprojects, only the integrated \nwaste management treatment facility in Khulna has resettlement impacts. The resettlement \nimpacts of the subproject are limited to 24 affected people consisting of informal settlers (four \nhouseholds)  and  temporary  farm  laborers,  each  considered  to  be  vulnerable  due  to  their \nnontitled or poverty status. The short resettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix S.29\nPF FP \n \n2.  Environmental Safeguards \n \n88.  Subprojects are designed to avoid, minimize, and/or mitigate adverse environmental \nimpacts. Potential impacts are mostly localized and temporary, and related to dust, noise, and \naccess disruptions due to construction activities and construction-related waste disposal. These \nimpacts can largely be avoided through good engineering design and practices, or be reduced \nthrough  proper  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  management.  An  environmental \nassessment and review framework was developed to ensure compliance with national law and \nADB  policies,  guidelines,  and  requirements,  and  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future \nsubprojects (Supplementary Appendix T). Environmental subproject selection guidelines are to \nfurther ensure that impacts that are potentially significant and permanent are identified and \nprevented. Preparation of the environmental assessment reports was done with extensive public \nconsultation in each of the sample subproject locations and included primary and secondary \nstakeholders.  \n \n89.  Program and project investments in waste management and food safety are designed to \nimprove environmental quality, living conditions, and public and environmental health in city \ncorporations. Environmental assessment of the policy matrix indicates that the program's policy \nreforms are directly or indirectly aimed at promoting environmentally sound development by \ncontributing to improvements in waste management and food safety. The potential impacts of \neach policy are presented in the environmental assessment of the policy matrix (Supplementary \nAppendix  U).  Three  initial  environmental  examinations  and  two  environmental  reviews \n(Supplementary Appendix V) were conducted for sample subprojects and these show that net \nenvironmental  benefits  are  extensive.  These  include  (i)  reduced  solid  waste  pollution  and \ncleaner waterways due to investments in primary and secondary waste collection, (ii) reduced \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  due  to  composting  and  potential  CDM  activities;  (iii)  reduced \nenvironmental  contamination  due  to  integrated  waste  treatment  facilities  investments;  (iv) \nreduced  environmental  risk  due  to  proper  disposal  of  hazardous  medical  waste;  and  (v) \nimproved handling and disposal of environmentally polluting slaughterhouse waste. A draft \nsummary environmental assessment is provided in Appendix 12. \n \nC.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n1.  Economic Analysis \n90.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the project loan and some \ncost implications of the policy actions. The overall EIRR is 18.2%, which exceeds the \nopportunity cost of capital of 12% per year. The EIRRs were subjected to sensitivity analysis \non the basis of (i) increase in investment cost by 20%, (ii) decrease in economic benefits by \n20%,  and  (iii)  delay  in  the  period  of  construction  and/or  implementation  causing  delay  in \nrevenue generation by 1 year. The findings of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the economic \nviability is still favorable despite adverse conditions, as the EIRR ranges from 13.6% to 16.8%. \nThe analyses indicate that changing the benefits has greater impact on the Project with regard \nto other variants. With a 20% decrease in the economic benefit, the sensitivity indicator is 2.23, \n                                                 \n29 A copy is posted at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/BAN/39305/39305-02-BAN-RP.pdf \nP P", " 25\nwhich indicates that an assumed change of 20% in project benefit results in a corresponding \n45% change in the economic benefits. Thus, economic benefits are relatively more sensitive to \nadverse project risks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRR for the project loan is \nrobust  under  most  conditions.  The  detailed  economic  evaluation  and  sensitivity  analysis  are \navailable (Supplementary Appendix W). \n \n2.  Financial Management \n91.  Using financial management assessment questionnaires, interviews and financial \nmanagement assessments were undertaken during the project preparatory TA to evaluate the \nexecuting agency's ability to undertake and fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project \ncomponents. The Executing Agency's financial management needs to be strengthened, and will be \nacceptable with  financial  management  and  concurrent  audit  support.  Project  implementation \ndelays will be minimized through extensive support from project management and design and \nsupervision  consultants,  who  will  be  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  and  requirements \n(Supplementary Appendixes X and Y). \n \n3.  Financial Sustainability \n92.  Financial variability of the project loan was assessed in real terms using constant 2008 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal terms by adjusting the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuations. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of \nthe executing agencies under with-project and without-project scenarios. The financial internal \nrate of return, computed on an after-tax basis, was 13.2%. This compares favorably with the \nweighted average cost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis, of 2.3% on an aggregate \nbasis. All parts of the project loan are considered financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity \nand risk analysis indicates that the financial internal rate of return is sensitive to delays in each \nitem of the implementation of financial improvement action plan. Detailed financial analysis is \navailable (Supplementary Appendix Z). \n \nD.  Risks and Assumptions \n93.  Public and environmental health challenges, arising from rapid urbanization in a country \nwhere urban density is one of the highest in the world and where urban basic services need \nmuch improvement, are complex and daunting. The sheer scale of challenge and the resources \nthat are required to deal with them are immense. Political support might waver, as the outputs \nrelating to public and environmental health are less tangible than those related to building roads \nand drains. These risks will be addressed through participatory approach and behavior change \ncommunication interventions.  \n \n94.  The purpose of greater interministerial coordination by the LGD is to access the core \nskills, knowledge, and professional staff of other line ministries so as to support and enable city \ncorporations to effectively implement their mandates relating to public and environmental health. \nThis is also to assist the LGD fulfill its role of providing national stewardship to city corporations \nand pourashavas. However, the interministerial coordination issues are always very sensitive \nand lead to territorial and jurisdictional tensions. This could lead to unwanted tensions and \ndistraction from the primary purpose of these coordination committees, i.e., to improve the \nquality of life of urban inhabitants. This risk will have to be proactively addressed by the LGD by \nensuring that (i) apprehensions of the line ministries are addressed, (ii) the ministry with a lead \n ", "26  \nrole continues to provide the lead on the issue, and (iii) regular interaction and coordination \noccurs, and no duplication takes place. \n \nVI.

Rapid Urbanization and Reaching the Urban Poor \n \n1.  Rapid Urbanization. Bangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace. Since independence in \n1971, the urban population has grown at an average annual rate of 6% against the overall \nnational growth of 2.2%. From a total of 20.8 million people in 1991, the country\u2019s urban \npopulation increased to 28.6 million in 2001.1 Further projections estimate that the country\u2019s \nPF FP\nurban population will reach 116.2 million (about half of the country\u2019s population) by 2040.2 \nPF FP\nApproximately 28.4% of the total population living in urban areas is poor.3 By 2020, it is \nPF FP\nestimated that the poor will comprise 40%\u201360% of the urban population, most of those will live \nin slum communities.4 The latest census identified 9,448 slums in the six cities, with the highest \nPF FP\nconcentration in Dhaka (54.9%), followed by Chittagong (20%), Sylhet (8.3%), Rajshahi (7.1%), \nKhulna (5.7%), and Barisal (3.9%).5 These demographic changes have increased the public \nPF FP\nand environmental health challenges in urban areas.  \n \nB.  Status of Public and Environmental Health in Urban Areas \n \n2.  The summary of the problems in the form of problem tree analysis is given in Figure A2. \nA brief description of these problems is given below. High urban density in Bangladesh results \nin  unhealthy  living  conditions  for  the  poor,  who  live  in  crowded,  damp,  and  unsanitary \nenvironments. It is estimated that about one-fifth of the country's total burden of disease may be \nassociated with environmental factors. Two of the top three causes of death and sickness, \nparticularly among poor children, are respiratory illnesses, including respiratory tract infection \n(pneumonia)  and  bronchial  asthma,  and  diarrheal  diseases  all  arising  from  adverse \nenvironmental  conditions.  The  findings  of  the  qualitative  surveys  in  four  slums  of  Dhaka \nreinforce the findings of the quantitative surveys regarding public and environmental health \nchallenges  among  the  urban  poor  (Supplementary  Appendix  AB).  Table  A2  shows  the \nestimated share of the top five causes of death, disease, and cancer as measured in disability \nadjusted life years.6  \nPF FP\n \n3.  Millennium  Development  Goals  on  Health.  Bangladesh  has  made  impressive \nprogress relating to Millennium Development Goals on health but there are inequalities in the \nhealth conditions between the urban rich and the urban poor (Supplementary Appendix A). The \ninfant mortality rate in urban slum areas (63 per 1,000 live births) is more than the national \nestimate, and the under-5 mortality rate is much higher in urban slum areas (81 per 1000 live \nbirths) than in urban non-slum areas (31 per 1000 live births). The nutritional status of urban \npoor children is as bad as their rural counterparts (Supplementary Appendix AA). The Second \nUrban  Primary  Health  Care  Project  developed  an  effective  project-specific  methodology \ntargeting the urban poor for delivering primary health care services. This practice, although \nsuccessful, needs to be expanded to ensure that poor people have access to the full array of \ngovernment programs. \n \n                                                 \n1  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2001.

City corporations and pourashavas (towns other than city corporations) have major role \nto  play  in  strengthening  urban  public  and  environmental  health  service  delivery.  The  City \nCorporation Ordinance and Pourashava Ordinance require city corporations and pourashavas \nto effectively deliver solid waste management, sanitation, infectious diseases control, and food \nand water safety services. There are currently no national rules or bylaws related to solid waste \nmanagement and bylaws relating to food safety to guide local bodies. National policies are \ntherefore needed to help local governments meet their urban public and environmental health \nmandates.  \n  \nD.  Municipal Solid Waste Management \n \n5.  Municipal solid waste management is not keeping pace with demand. Limited number of \nhouseholds in urban areas in Bangladesh have access to a solid waste collection system7 with \nPF FP\nmost slum households disposing of garbage in open spaces. With the exception of Dhaka, no \ncity corporations or pourashavas have sanitary landfill services (Supplementary Appendix E). \nWhile  house-to-house  collection  by  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations is widespread, there is insufficient public or private investment in secondary \ncollection and disposal. Due to low tariffs, the sector as a whole does not attract private sector \ninvestments,  and  municipal  finances  are  insufficient  to  afford  sustainable  private  sector \nparticipation. The level of cost recovery through user charges is very low, and in particular there \nis no separate tariff schedule for institutional, commercial, and industrial wastes. Moreover, \nthere  are  no  national  solid  waste  management  guidelines  to  assist  local  governments  to \novercome these challenges. Focus should be on establishing national policy, strategy, planning \nprocedures, and guidelines, followed by specific investments to support municipalities in planning, \npreparing, and implementing municipal solid waste improvements in line with the established \nnational  priorities.  Without  national  and  local  initiatives  to  improve  municipal  solid  waste \nmanagement, the growing and uncontrolled disposal of solid waste will continue to create \nsevere public and environmental health challenges. Moreover, for the purposes of utilizing the \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2005. Bangladesh: Country Strategy and Program: 2006\u20132010.

Medical Waste Management \n \n6.  About 36,000 tons (t) of health care waste is generated every year in Bangladesh, of \nwhich approximately 7,200 t is hazardous. Medical waste needs to be properly managed so that \nthe health and safety of the health care providers, waste handlers, and community is ensured. \nIn  most  of  Bangladesh,  traditional  and  outdated  systems  of  waste  management  in  health \nfacilities are used, causing ineffective and improper waste disposal leading to pollution of the \nenvironment and health hazards to the people. An acceptable, economical, and sustainable \nmedical waste management system is imperative to establish environmentally friendly hospitals. \nVarious studies document the poor quality of medical waste management in government and \nnongovernment hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic laboratories. There is no proper segregation \nand collection of waste in the health care facilities as well as a shortage of equipment and \nmaterials required for the disposal of medical wastes. The wastes are frequently dumped in the \ndustbins inside and/or outside hospital premises, or on the ground within the hospital premises, \nand then these become public waste.  \n \n7.  Medical Waste Management Regulation. Recognizing the need to improve health care \nwaste  practices  through  national  legislation,  the  Government  adopted  the  Medical  Waste \n(Management and Processing) Rules under the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act, \n1995. These regulations define the role and responsibilities of the local government institutions \n(city corporations, municipalities, and union parishads (councils)) for the external transportation \nof general waste, treatment of hazardous waste, and provision of land for the proper and final \ndisposal  of  waste.  An  authorized  person  or  organization  will  be  responsible  for  untreated \nhazardous waste transportation and final disposal. The regulations establish a licensing regime \nunder the control of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and when implemented will \nprovide a mechanism through which operators will compete with clients in an open market or \nunder franchised service zones.  For scaling up of programs in medical waste management, \nthere  is  scope  in  both  the  City  Corporation  Ordinance  and  Pourashava  Ordinance  to \nimmediately adopt bylaws to undertake any mandate to implement necessary tasks. As such \nthere is the authority to either dispose of medical and solid waste or contract this work out to a \ncompetent private entity.  \n \nF.  Food Safety \n \n8.  Food contamination and adulteration with dangerous substances, colors, and chemicals \nare potential sources of unsafe food. There are limited sophisticated analytical laboratories with \nthe necessary equipment, chemicals, and well-trained analysts or technicians. Food laws, rules, \nand regulations in Bangladesh are not up to date. The Bangladesh National Plan of Action on \nNutrition8 made suggestions on food quality and safety issues, such as updating legislation, \nPF FP\ndesignation of a competent authority, infrastructure, and laboratory development for providing \nessential services. A number of ministries, departments, and agencies are involved in food \nsafety. The national food policy of the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management offers few \nstrategic guidelines to ensure safe and quality foods. Bangladesh is yet to develop a unified \nfood safety administration system or formulate a national food safety policy. \n \n                                                 \n8 Government of Bangladesh. 1997. National Plan of Action on Nutrition. Dhaka. \nP P", "Appendix 2    37\n9.  Animals are slaughtered in open places adjacent to the wet markets or on the roadside \nin areas without proper facilities, sanitation, and drainage. Meat production and marketing is not \norganized and is conducted in various places in the city without much of municipal control, \nsupervision, or veterinary inspection of live animals or carcasses. All city corporations need to \norganize, supervise, and control the slaughtering of animals, the production of meat and meat \nproducts, and the utilization and processing of by-products.  \n \nG.  Municipal Financing \n \n10.  Insufficient  resources  are  allocated  within  the  city  corporation  towards  public  and \nenvironmental health. Even though public health and primary health care are priority areas \nunder the Medium Term Budget Framework of the Local Government Division (LGD) of the \nMinistry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, the majority of funds are \nspent on infrastructure and maintenance of roads. Dedicated funds for public health and urban \nprimary health care need to be specific in the government orders that accompany funds release \nto the city corporations. However, a steady and growing source of local funding is needed for \nurban local bodies. Municipal financing is dominated by one tax source\u2014the property tax. It \ncontributes nearly two-thirds of total revenue receipts, however it is not fully exploited. Proper \nand regular assessment is not done, and most local governments are not properly equipped to \ndo  this.  The  betterment  tax,  higher  property  taxes,  urban  development  bond,  commercial \ndevelopment projects, attracting private capital, and untapped resources (e.g., introduction of \nparking rentals), are some of the potential revenue sources available to municipalities.  \n \n11.  Municipal  financial  reforms,  including  a  set  of  standard  procedures  on  accepted \naccounting standards, are needed to enhance financial management aspects in an integrated \nand  cohesive  manner.  Computerization  of  the  accounting  systems  would  be  of  benefit  in \nachieving  fiscal  discipline  by  virtue  of  its  implementation.  In  support  of  municipal  financial \nreforms, some functional responsibilities, such as solid waste management, can be enhanced \nthrough private sector participation, and performance-based allocation should be considered to \navoid block grant allocations.  \n \n12.  Tariffs, Cost Recovery, and Sustainability. Cost recovery is a key issue for successful \nimplementation of the Project. An effective tariff mechanism is needed to ensure sufficient \ncontributions from beneficiaries to support operation and maintenance and finance overhead \ncosts including debt servicing. It is necessary to ensure adequate and timely provision of \ncounterpart funds during project implementation. Inadequate tariff levels will lead to lack of \nfunds for capital investment and for operations and maintenance for built assets. Effectiveness \nand sustainability of all future urban wastewater management and solid waste management \nfacilities depend upon tariff reforms and innovative financing mechanisms. The Government of \nBangladesh has recognized the importance of tariff reforms to raise funds for both construction \nand operation and maintenance of urban water supply, wastewater treatment, and solid waste \nmanagement. As suggested in the National Sanitation Strategy 20059, multiple choices of \nPF FP\ntechnologies are necessary, depending on local conditions and people\u2019s willingness to pay. The \ninstitutional, commercial, and industrial waste tariff analysis, however, showed very low levels of \ntariff  structures,  and  high  potential  for  improving  revenues  from  the  tariffs  (Supplementary \nAppendix AD).  \n \n \n                                                 \n9 Government of Bangladesh. 2005. National Sanitation Strategy. Dhaka. \nP P\n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n \nH.  Institutional Strengthening \n \n13.  Surveys indicate that a large number of positions\u2014including senior positions\u2014relating to \nhealth and conservancy are vacant in urban local bodies. In addition, survey results reinforce \nthe view that municipalities do not dedicate much budget to critical public and environmental \nhealth functions (Supplementary Appendix AE). UPEH requires a well-coordinated approach by \nseveral departments of different ministries, the private sector, nongovernment organizations, \nand  others.  However,  an  effective  steward  to  promote  and  harness  the  coordination, \ncollaboration,  and  partnership  is  absent.  As  the  support  wing  of  the  ministry  for  all  local \ngovernment  institutions,  including  the  city  corporations  and  the  pourashavas,  the  LGD  is \nentrusted with a wide range of tasks including (i) development of local government; (ii) financing, \nregulation, and inspection of all authorities established for local government; (iii) public health \nengineering; and (iv) rural water supply and water and sewerage development. The LGD has \nfew human resources to achieve all these tasks and has no permanent arrangement to provide \nstewardship for urban public and environmental health development. The institutionalization of \nan urban public and environmental health program is therefore essential.  \n \n14.  Due to the complex nature of urban health problems there is also need for joint action \nand consolidated efforts of different ministries, such as the Ministry of Local Government, Rural \nDevelopment  and  Cooperatives,  MOHFW,  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forestry,  the \nMinistry of Industry, the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management, the Ministry of Commerce, \nand their departments that are responsible for taking action to support good health and regulate \nand control unhealthy conditions. Thus the main issue is for a sustainable urban public and \nenvironmental health initiative within the LGD to make an institutional arrangement to fill the \nhuman resource and financial gap, which is needed to create a sustainable UPEH system in \nBangladesh.

Background \n \n1.  One of the most significant risks of the Urban Public and Environmental Health Sector \nDevelopment Program (UPEHSDP) is that, being a new program, the initial set-up required for \nestablishing the urban public and environmental health unit (UPEHU) followed by hiring of \nvarious  consultant  firms  would  take  a  long  time.  This  would  not  only  delay  the  program \nimplementation, but has the potential to derail the Program due to weak procurement and \nfinancial management systems. The UPEHSDP by nature has greater challenges than either a \npure program or a pure project, as it has both a policy reforms component (program) and an \ninvestment component (project). These two components require a diverse skills base. For the \npolicy  reforms  component,  expertise  in  policy,  law,  regulation,  and  municipal  finances  are \nrequired; the investment component requires procurement, financial management and audit, \nproject performance monitoring, and information management skills. Both policy reforms and \ninvestment components will require specialists in solid waste, medical waste, food and water \nsafety, and slaughterhouses. The technical assistance (TA) is an effort to mitigate the start-up \ndelay risks, enable the project to start on a sound foundation, and strengthen the capacities of \nthe Local Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development \nand Cooperatives to implement the reform program.  \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n2.  The objectives of the TA are to (i) help in overcoming the start-up delays inherent in a \nnew program by providing high-quality consultant support to undertake critical advance activities \nand set up systems and procedures in the newly created UPEHU and city corporation program \nimplementation units; and (ii) provide advisory capacity building assistance to the Government \nfor urban public and environmental health, both at the national and city corporation level. This \nwill include assistance for the LGD and the UPEHU in preparing and implementing key policy \nreforms.  \n \n3.  The TA outcome will be to provide (i) expert procurement support to help the LGD and \nUPEHU in hiring the three consultant packages in a timely manner; (ii) expert institutional and \nfinancial management support to set up procedures and processes for smooth functioning of the \nUPEHU  and  city  corporation  program  implementation  units,  especially  with  regard  to \nanticorruption; (iii) expert support in municipal financing, institutional development, financial \nmanagement,  solid  and  medical  waste,  food  and  water  safety,  private  sector  participation \n(public\u2013private  partnership),  pro-poor  targeting,  citizens  participation,  and  gender \nmainstreaming for policy reform support; (iv) engineering design support in waste management \nand food safety to support the implementation of the investment component; and (v) limited \nsupport for training and local study tours.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n4.  The  LGD  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA  and  the  UPEHU  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The project director of the UPEHSDP will also be the project director of \nthe TA. The national program steering committee of the UPEHSDP will provide overall guidance \nto  the  TA's  implementation.  The  TA  is  expected  to  commence  as  soon  as  the  Project  is \napproved by the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and to be completed \nin 2 years. Consultants will be selected and engaged under the Project in accordance with \n ", "58  Appendix 10 \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). All the \nconsultants will be hired on an individual basis, directly or through an organization.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements \n \n5.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering all the foreign exchange costs and \npart of the local costs. ADB will finance $500,000 equivalent, on a grant basis, from ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund-IV  funding  program.  The  proposed  Government  in-kind \ncontribution of $125,000 equivalent will cover office costs, conference venues, and counterpart \nstaff  remuneration.  The  details  are  presented  in  Table  A10.  The  following  international \nconsultants will be supported under the TA: urban infrastructure (public\u2013private partnership) \nexpert (1 person-month), municipal solid waste management expert (4 person-months), and \nprocurement expert (1 person-month). The following national consultants will be supported \nunder the TA: public and environmental health institutional development expert (8 person-\nmonths), procurement expert (6 person-months), solid waste management expert (6 person-\nmonths), food laboratory and food safety expert (3 person-months), municipal finance expert (4 \nperson-months),  legal  expert  (3  person-months),  resettlement  and  environment  safeguards \nexpert (3 person-months), and gender and poverty expert (3 person-months). \n \nTable A10: Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements  \n($\u2019000) \nItem        Total Cost \nA.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe sector development Program is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations \nbusiness plan (2009\u20132011) which reiterates ADB's commitment to supporting policy and institutional reforms \nand investments in urban infrastructure (urban health, water supply, and transport). a The sector development \nP P\nprogram will contribute to human development by improving the living conditions of poor and disadvantaged \nresidents in program cities.b This will be through pro-poor and gender-responsive policy/institutional reforms and \nP P\ninvestments aimed at improving greater access to public and environmental health services. The project loan will \nimprove municipal and medical waste management and food safety in project cities with focus on the poor and \ndisadvantaged. Solid waste management investments include a subcomponent on primary waste collection and \ntreatment for the urban poor. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                             Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention-MDGs \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe sector development program supports Bangladesh\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II (PRSP 2009\u2013\n2011) which identifies five strategies for poverty reduction (including ensuring human development), and five \nsupporting strategies (including providing service delivery efficiently and effectively to the poor, and tackling \nenvironmental issues for sustainable development). While poverty incidence in Bangladesh is decreasing in \nabsolute terms, the number of urban poor grows with the rapidly increasing population. Of the urban population, \n45% live in poverty with 25% classified as extremely poor (consumption less than 1,805 kilocalories per day). \nThe majority of the urban poor live in slums. Slum dwellers face poverty due to their low level of earnings and \nthe fact that the majority live below the poverty line in terms of both calorie intake and cost of basic needs. They \nare mostly involved in low-paid jobs in the informal sectors. Poor urban infrastructure in slums exposes the slum \npopulation to public and environmental health hazards. \n \nThrough  support  to  pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  public  and  environmental  health  sector  in  public  and \nenvironmental health in general, and a focus on the poor through integrated waste management for the urban \npoor and policy and institutional reforms, the sector development program will support the Government of \nBangladesh in achieving relevant Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The project loan will cover city \npopulations (estimated at about one-third of the total population) and specifically target poor and disadvantaged \nwomen in terms of integrated solid waste management.  \n \n2. Design Features  \n \nThe project component will contribute to achieving MDGs: \n \n(i) MDGs 4 and 5: Reduction of Child Mortality and Improving Maternal Health. In addition to public and \nenvironmental health benefits from which poor women and children will benefit more due to their greater \nvulnerability, the Program's policy reform of improving pro-poor and gender-responsive targeting will contribute \nto expand maternal health care for the very poor and the poor in all of the six city corporations.  \n \n(ii) MDG 6: Combating Malaria and Other Diseases. Unmanaged nonbiodegradable wastes serve as actual \nbreeding grounds for mosquitoes. In addition, unmanaged solid waste is often washed by rain, blown by the \nwind, or deliberately placed in drainage channels, creating stagnant pools which also serve as breeding grounds \nfor mosquitoes. The Project's investments in solid waste management will thus contribute to reducing the \nincidence of malaria. \n \n(iii) MDG7:  Ensuring  Environmental  Sustainability. Investments in solid  waste management\u2014including \nintegrated waste management for the urban poor, medical waste management, food laboratories, and modern \nslaughterhouses\u2014will lead to environmental improvements in urban areas that reduce the vulnerability of the \npoor to pollution and diseases related to inadequate urban infrastructure and services. Specific environmental \n ", "60  Appendix 11 \nbenefits include (i) reduced solid waste pollution and cleaner waterways due to investments in primary and \nsecondary waste collection, (ii) reduced greenhouse gas emissions due to composting and potential clean \ndevelopment mechanism activities, (iii) reduced environmental contamination due to integrated waste treatment \ninvestments, (iv) reduced environmental risk due to proper disposal of hazardous medical waste, and (v) \nimproved disposal of environmentally polluting slaughterhouse waste. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n \nThe program loan will support the implementation of pro-poor and gender-responsive policy reforms to (i) \nstrengthen institutional arrangements, (ii) improve financial sustainability, (iii) improve public and environmental \nhealth  service  delivery,  and  (iv)  strengthen  pro-poor  and  gender-responsive  targeting  through  citizens' \nparticipation and the role of the private sector. These will have positive impacts on the country\u2019s population as \nthe policy reforms will improve public and environmental health conditions, with the poor benefiting more as they \ntypically suffer more from unsanitary waste and food management practices. One of the policy reform areas \ndirectly  targets  the  poor  as  the  focus  for  urban  public  and  environmental  health  programs.  The  Local \nGovernment Division (LGD) will establish a technical working group to develop procedures and guidelines for \nlocal bodies to identify the poor in their locality and for pro-poor targeting. This is expected to result in actions in \neach city corporation to identify the poor. The LGD will provide guidelines to the local bodies for the issuance of \nentitlement cards to the poor and to the identification of programs and services which can be accessed with the \ncard.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nWhile it is documented that Bangladesh has made progress in achieving MDG goals, in the urban areas, there \ncontinues to be public and environmental health hazards, particularly for the urban poor and among the urban \npoor and disadvantaged women. This was confirmed in the findings of the poverty and social/gender analyses \ncarried out by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) during the preparation of the sector development program. \nOnly 60% of respondents had access to sanitary latrines while the rest use unhygienic hanging latrines. One \nlatrine is typically shared by a large number of households (ranging from 8 to 66). Illegal settlements, the inability \nto afford sewage connection, and the lack of other options commensurate with their ability to pay are critical \nimpediments to the access of poor and disadvantaged women to sanitation. Access to water is also limited; one \nsource of water is usually shared between 76 and 110 households. Moreover, the distance of water sources and \nlatrines serve as additional barriers for accessing these services.  \n \nSolid waste is mostly thrown into waterways (through gaps in the macha [raised platforms] of wooden houses) or \nnearby open spaces. Utilization of fixed locations and/or transfer stations for garbage disposal in urban slums is \nonly 25%. Exposure to improperly disposed of waste worsens the living conditions and health status of the urban \npoor. \n \nWhile food safety is not seen as a priority among the poor, slum dwellers frequently consume unsafe food from \nstreet vendors and suffer from food-related diseases. In addition to unsafe food, malnutrition and food insecurity \nare crucial issues in urban poverty. The unsanitary practice of open slaughtering of animals creates an \nunhygienic environment with the poor often involved in, and exposed to, these conditions. \n \nAccess of the urban poor to primary health care services is limited. Analysis shows that, as the first point of \ncontact, they prefer chemist shops and/or dispensaries and traditional healers, mainly due to affordability and \navailability. Women and children are the most vulnerable among the urban poor. The analysis shows that, in \nselected slums, the institutional childbirth delivery rate was only 17% against the rate of antenatal care at 55 %. \nCost was the main factor for not opting for institutional delivery. The majority of respondents (83%) indicated that \nthey had their last child delivery at home because it was cheaper.  \n \n ", "Appendix 11    61\n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive consultations were conducted during sector development program preparation. Four workshops were held in \nDhaka (July and August 2008) to discuss the proposed program\u2019s objectives, components, and projected impacts, and \nobtain stakeholders opinions. The workshops were attended by 115 participants including community male and female \nrepresentatives,  community-based  organizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  local  government \nofficials, line agency representatives, and other stakeholders. Five other similar workshops were conducted in Bogra, \nComilla,  Khulna,  Satkhira,  and  Tongi.  Further  consultations  at  subproject  sites  included  meetings  with  local \ngovernment officials, NGOs, and surrounding communities.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing        Consultation      Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nA major feature of the capacity development subcomponent of the sector development program is enabling the \nmunicipal bodies to take a more participatory approach to urban development. The consultation and participation \nstrategy is embodied in the community participation plan which complements policy actions (Policy Action 4.2: Enable \ncitizen participation in delivery of urban public and environmental health [UPEH]). It centers on the formation of two \ncommunity-based programs: (i) formation of service delivery alliances at the facility and ward level (the alliances are \nmultistakeholder groups consisting of civil society representatives, resource organizations, NGOs, community-based \norganizations, and private sector providers); and (ii) the Waste Picker Livelihood Training Program. Service delivery \nalliances will facilitate dissemination of accurate information regarding urban services issues, assist the city corporation \nin  preparing  community-based  programs  and  partnering  with  NGOs,  and  promote  community  mobilization  and \nawareness.c This will be further enhanced by educational campaigns to encourage the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and \nPP\nrecycle) and source segregation of waste. Implementation support for the community participation plan includes the \nprovision of a community participation and gender action plan specialist within the Urban Public and Environmental \nHealth Unit (UPEHU).  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nDespite recent gains in the role of women in economic and social development in Bangladesh, women still remain \nparticularly vulnerable to poverty. In relation to solid waste, it is women who are mostly responsible for managing waste \nat the household level, and who are mostly engaged in informal waste picking and recycling activities for livelihood \ndependence. Few women are involved in key decision-making efforts at the local, city corporation, and national levels, \nparticularly related to issues of public and environmental health. Participation of women in stable, skilled jobs is also \nlow. Opportunities exist to equip women with proper training and equipment, to become absorbed into the formal waste \ncollection process, as well as other sectors in food safety and hospital waste management. This would ensure more \nstable employment as well as safer and healthier work conditions. More efforts are also needed to improve the role of \nwomen in local project planning and decision making. \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to \nand use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n \n Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nSummarize key design features of the gender plan or other gender-related actions/measures, including performance \ntargets, monitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n \n \nTo promote the effective incorporation of pro-poor and gender-inclusive design features, the sector development \nprogram and the related project will adopt a set of activities\u2014defined in the project-specific gender action plan, as \nfollows: \n(i)  ensuring the recruitment of a poverty and gender specialist at the UPEHU;  \n(ii)  promoting women's representation and participation in all decision-making processes/structures and \ntraining programs supported under the sector development program, i.e., UPEHU, technical working \ngroup to be established by the LGD (especially the one on pro-poor targeting and citizen's participation in \n ", "62  Appendix 11 \nthe program/project cities, and service delivery alliances); \n(iii)  tailoring training programs addressing the specific needs of (a) UPEHU (staff and consultants), (b) city \ncorporations (staff and consultants), (c) urban communities in program/project sites,d and (d) contractors \nP P\nand economic operations involved in the sector development program; \n(iv)  ensuring  women's  participation  in  all  program-supported  training  programs  (including  waste  picker \nlivelihood training programs); \n(v)  ensuring the incorporation of gender action plan approaches in the finalization of the LGD guidelines on \n(a) strengthening citizen's participation; and (b) pro-poor targeting of urban basic service, and ensuring \ntheir effective implementation in all program/project cities; \n(vi)  promoting city corporations' increased budgetary allocations for maternal and child health care services, \ntargeting the poor; and \n(vii)  ensuring that program/project-specific project performance monitoring system collects sex-disaggregated \ninformation and data and that during its implementation the program/project is adjusted (as needed) to \nensure greater pro-poor and gender equality results/impacts.  \n \nKey targets of the gender action plan include the following: \n \n  Program Components \n(i)  Women employed at UPEHU (target: 20% of women's staff and consultants); \n(ii)  poverty and gender specialist recruited at UPEHU (by first quarter 2010); \n(iii)  capacity needs assessment carried out of UPEHU staff (yearly); \n(iv)  training modules designed and administered to target groups (twice yearly); \n(v)  satisfaction surveys developed and administered (yearly); \n(vi)  women's representation in all technical working groups (target: 20% representation);, \n(vii)  gender-discriminatory practices in access to UPEH services and structures documented and viable \noptions reflected in the findings and recommendations of the technical working group;

Poverty and discrimination of this kind undercut the \nability of disadvantaged groups to access basic social services (including public and environmental health services). \nc  Project costs cover training programs for local government officials, information, education and communication campaigns, and \nPP\ninvolving media. Logistical support is to be provided by the city corporations. The waste picker's training program will provide \ntraining and income-generation opportunities for waste pickers impacted by project investments, particularly at waste collection \nsites and waste treatment facilities. The goal is to involve waste pickers in program activities and to provide needed skills training \nand job placement services. Costs include surveys, training, and daily allowance to compensate waste pickers during training \nactivities. \nd  At a minimum, the training program for target groups (i), (ii), and (iii) should include a combination of the following modules: (a) \nPP\nsocial/gender analysis in urban settings, (b) consultation and participation mechanisms, (c) implementation of pro-poor and gender \naction plan design features (through the gender action plan), and (d) monitoring and evaluation of poverty reduction and gender \nequality results of the sector development program. With respect to target group (iv), the training program should include: (a) LGD \ncontractual arrangements and modalities (with emphasis on core labor standards and GAD provisions), and (b) operation and \nmaintenance of community infrastructure (target: 30% women's representation). \n ", "64  Appendix 12 \nDRAFT SUMMARY ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  Overview \n \n1.  The Urban Public and Environmental Health Sector Development Program (UPEHSDP) \naddresses key institutional, policy, legal, financing, and capacity gaps relating to urban public \nand environmental health. The Program will consist of two investment types\u2014a program loan \nand a project loan\u2014and will include interventions at the policy level and focus on targeted \ninvestments in six city corporations. The program loan includes a policy matrix with four key \npolicy  proposals.  It  aims  to  (i)  strengthen  institutional  arrangements,  (ii)  improve  financial \nsustainability, (iii) improve urban public and environmental health service delivery, and (iv) \nstrengthen citizen participation and private sector role and pro-poor targeting. Environmental \nassessment of the policy matrix indicates that these policies are directly or indirectly aimed at \npromoting  environmentally  sound  development  by  contributing  to  improvements  in  waste \nmanagement and food safety; conversely, the status quo of negative environmental and social \nimpacts would continue to occur if the policies fail. The main potential impacts of each policy are \nsummarized in the full environmental assessment of the policy matrix (Supplementary Appendix \nU).  \n \n2.  The project loan will target investments in two areas: waste management and food \nsafety.  Subprojects  aim  to  improve  environmental  quality,  public  health,  and  overall  living \nconditions in city corporations. Five environmental assessments were conducted. Three of \nthese  were  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)\u2014Khulna  Solid  Waste  Management, \nChittagong  Hospital  Waste  Management,  and  Dhaka  Slaughter  House\u2014and  two  were \nenvironmental reviews\u2014Chittagong Food Testing Laboratory and Dhaka Solid Waste Transfer \nStations. IEEs were based on feasibility studies, field visits, secondary data, and extensive \ndiscussions with stakeholders.  \n \nB.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures1\nPF FP \n \n3.  Environmental  assessments  conducted  for  waste  management  and  food  safety \nsubprojects under the UPEHSDP show that net environmental benefits are positive and large, \nand include (i) reduced solid waste pollution and cleaner waterways due to investments in \nprimary  and  secondary  waste  collection,  (ii)  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions  due  to \ncomposting and potential clean development mechanism activities, (iii) reduced environmental \ncontamination due to sanitary landfill investments, (iv) reduced environmental risk due to proper \ndisposal of hazardous medical waste, and (v) improved disposal of environmentally polluting \nslaughterhouse waste.  \n \n4.  All identified adverse impacts can be mitigated and include properly locating, planning, \nand designing proposed subprojects; controlling construction activity; and properly maintaining \nsystems following commissioning. Impacts that are potentially significant and permanent are \nidentified,  and  environmental  subproject  selection  guidelines,  part  of  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework (Supplementary Appendix T), will not allow subprojects with \nsuch impacts. The potential for adverse environmental impacts are primarily associated with \nunrealized benefits, which may occur due to failures in implementing subprojects in accordance \nwith  good  engineering  practice  and  sustained  operation  and  maintenance  procedures.  No \n                                                 \n1 Environmental reviews are prepared when subprojects are unlikely to have adverse environmental impacts.

Summary Environmental Assessment and Review Framework \n \n1.  Institutional Roles and Responsibilities \nT \n \n6.  Local Government Division and Urban Public and Environmental Health Unit. The \nLocal Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and \nCooperatives will be the executing agency for the UPEHSDP providing overall guidance for \nprogram implementation. The LGD will have the overall responsibility to plan, organize, manage, \nsupervise, coordinate, and monitor the progress achieved. The LGD will establish a support \nunit called the environmental health unit (UPEHU) that will be responsible for day-to-day \nprogram implementation and will be headed by a full-time program director. A safeguards \nofficer to coordinate resettlement and environmental safeguards for the UPEHSDP will be part \nof the policy and program wing of the UPEHU. Through the safeguards officer, the UPEHU will \nensure environmental compliance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy and national law \nacross the entire program. This includes (i) pre-approving final IEEs prior to submission to ADB \nfor review and approval, and (ii) assisting in resolution of complaints and grievances related to \nIEE implementation not resolved in the city corporation program implementation units (CCPIUs). \n \n7.  City Corporations Program Implementation Units. Program implementation units \nwill be established in each city corporation. The CCPIUs will include a safeguards and \ncommunity mobilization officer who will receive training from the international environment \nspecialist and national environment specialist, and will be assigned to work with the CCPIU \nstaff to help monitor subprojects and to transfer implementation capability to the CCPIU team. \nThe  community  mobilization  officer  will  work  closely  with  the  environment  specialists  in \nplanning, implementing, and monitoring all project activities. The CCPIUs will (i) screen and \ncategorize subprojects, (ii) assist in public meetings and other consultation with stakeholders, \nand  (iii)  facilitate  activities  of  the  environment  specialists  in  applying  for  location  and \nenvironmental clearances.  \n \n8.  Environmental Specialists. A design, supervision, and construction consultant (DSCC) \nteam will be contracted to assist the UPEHU and CCPIUs in implementing and managing the \ninvestment  subprojects  including  environmental  planning.  Towards  this,  international  and \nnational environment specialists within the DSCC team will prepare IEEs in accordance with \nboth  ADB  and  Government  policies  during  the  feasibility  and  detailed  design  stage,  and \nsupervise  contractors,  with  support  from  CCPIUs,  during  the  construction  process.  The \nenvironment specialists will work in close coordination with UPEHU and CCPIUs. They will \ncoordinate with the safeguards officer in the UPEHU to ensure all IEEs comply with ADB and \nGovernment of Bangladesh rules and guidelines. The environment specialists will also provide \ntraining to CCPIUs to facilitate their monitoring of environmental impacts during construction \nand operation and will provide support ensuring that all tasks of the CCPIU with regard to \nenvironmental implementation and monitoring are achieved. \n \n9.  Grievance Redress Committees. Public grievances regarding technical, social, and \nenvironmental aspects will be brought to the grievance redress committee constituted for each \ncity corporation. The committee will comprise representatives from the office of the program \nimplementation unit and the office of the city corporation chief executive officer, affected people, \na  female  elected  member  of  the  city  corporation  and  the  safeguards  and  community \nmobilization officer. The grievance redress process is designed to be transparent, gender \nresponsive, culturally appropriate, and commensurate to the risks and adverse impacts of the \nproject, as well as readily accessible to all segments of the affected people. Affected people are \nto be appropriately informed about the mechanism through media and public outlets. This \n ", "70  Appendix 12 \nparticipatory process shall ensure that all views of the people are adequately reviewed and \nsuitably  incorporated  in  the  design  and  implementation  process.  The  grievance  redress \ncommittee will meet every month and will determine the merit of each grievance and resolve all \ngrievances within 15 days of receiving the complaint. The grievance redress procedure includes \nan appeals procedure for the affected person who can, if not satisfied with the committee \ndecision, attend the next case and present any additional information for reconsideration of the \ncase. Grievances not redressed by the grievance redress committee to the satisfaction of the \naffected person will be considered by the program steering committee or the Office of the \nDistrict Commissioner (for grievances related to land acquisition). Any remaining grievances \nmay be referred by affected people to the appropriate courts of law. Records will be kept of all \ngrievances received, including contact details of complainant, date the complaint was received, \nnature and details of grievance, agreed corrective actions and date these were effected, and \nthe final outcome.  \n \n10.  Asian Development Bank. The responsibilities of ADB in the review and clearance of \nenvironmental  assessment  reports  include  (i)  review  the  changes  and  the  suggested \nclassification, if required; (ii) revise environmental assessment report based on detailed design \nchanges,  as  warranted;  (iii)  reserving  the  right  to  review  the  project  document  and \nenvironmental assessment reports, as necessary; (iv) review subprojects confirmed by ADB as \nenvironmentally sensitive (the proposal and the IEE or environmental impact assessment of the \nsubproject must be forwarded by EA to ADB for review); and (v) ensure that all safeguards \ndocuments are endorsed by the executing agency.  \n \n2.  Environmental Monitoring and Reporting \n \n11.  Monitoring during construction will be assisted by the CCPIU, whose staff will receive \ntraining on environmental monitoring of construction from the national environment specialist. \nThe  CCPIU  will  report  the  results  and  conclusions  to  the  UPEHU  every  quarter,  or  more \nfrequently if remedial action is required. Mitigation required when the system is operating will be \nthe responsibility of the city corporation monitored by the UPEHU. \n \n3.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure  \n \n12.  The Project takes a participatory approach and engages both primary and secondary \nstakeholders. Public consultation was used extensively during preparation of the IEEs. This \nincluded public meetings, workshops to which multiple stakeholders were invited, and ad hoc \ninterviews at sites. The consultant team conducted these public consultations in Chittagong, \nDhaka, and Khulna to receive local input on the solid waste components, the hospital waste \nfacility, food testing laboratory, and slaughterhouse. Attendees were informed about the aim of \nthe relevant subprojects and the benefits they would bring, together with their likely impacts and \nthe ways in which they would be mitigated. Participants were invited to discuss their views and \nconcerns, which were then incorporated into the IEEs. Ad hoc discussions were also held on \nsite with people and communities who could be affected by the subprojects, so that views could \nbe expressed in a less formal setting. CCPIUs will disclose the IEEs to the public by providing \ncopies in the local language in the city corporation office in each town. Environmental concerns \nof the affected people raised during public consultations are summarized in the individual \nenvironmental reports; however, common concerns were primarily related to resettlement and \ncompensation issues (which are addressed in separate resettlement plans or mitigated through \ndesign), concerns about how the projects will improve the current waste situation (subprojects \nwere  explained  during  consultations  with  local  language  versions  of  the  summary \nenvironmental  examinations  and  project  descriptions  distributed  and  made  available  at \n ", "Appendix 12     7  1  \nmunicipal  offices),  and  questions  regarding  the  roles  of  government  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) (which were explained during consultations and clarified in the IEEs). In \naccordance  with  the  requirements  under  the  environment  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy (2005), ADB shall make the initial environmental examination available \nto interested parties on request. \n \n13.  Future consultation during detailed design will include (i) focus-group discussions with \naffected persons and other stakeholders (including women\u2019s groups, NGOs, and community-\nbased organizations) to hear their views and concerns, so that these can be addressed in \nproject design where necessary; and (ii) structured consultation meetings with the institutional \nstakeholders  (government  bodies  and  NGOs)  to  discuss  and  approve  key  aspects  of  the \nProject. Consultation during construction will include (i) public meetings with major stakeholders \nto  discuss  and  plan  work  programs  and  allow  issues  to  be  raised  and  addressed  once \nconstruction has started; and (ii) smaller-scale meetings to discuss and plan construction work \nwith primary stakeholders to reduce disturbance and other impacts, and provide a mechanism \nthrough which affected people can participate in project monitoring and evaluation. Project \ndisclosure will include public information campaigns (via newspaper, TV, and radio) to explain \nthe project to the urban populations and prepare them for any disruption they may experience \nonce the construction program is under way. Also, public disclosure meetings at key stages to \ninform the public of progress and future plans will occur, and copies of summary documents in \nthe Bangla language will be provided. Formal disclosure of completed project reports will be \nmade  available  at  convenient  locations  in  each  target  town,  informing  the  public  of  their \navailability, and providing a mechanism through which comments can be made. \n \n  4.  Environmental Selection Criteria for Subprojects \n \n14.  To ensure compliance with Government and ADB policies, environmental subproject \nselection criteria were prepared to guide the implementation of future subprojects. A summary \nof  the  environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  is  provided  in  Table  A12.2.  The  full \nenvironmental assessment and review framework, based on provisions of the Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  policies  and  the  environmental  assessment  criteria  of  ADB,  is  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix V.
