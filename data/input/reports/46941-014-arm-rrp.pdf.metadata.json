The hydropower plants in the country \ndo  not  meet  international  technical,  economic,  or  environmental  performance  standards. \nDespite  its  favorable  topography  and  hydrology,  Armenia  suffers  from  underinvestment  in \nhydropower  generation  capacity.  To  overcome  these  problems,  the  government  launched  an \ninitiative  to  promote  private  sector  investment  in  the  country's  energy  infrastructure,  including \nhydropower.  In  2005,  the  government\u2019s  Energy  Sector  Development  Strategy  targeted  an \nincrease  of  the  country\u2019s  renewable  energy  generation  including  hydropower  generation  from \n3,600 gigawatt-hours (GWh) to 5,100 GWh by 2025. \n \n3. \nIEC approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 2011 to raise debt financing for \nits  modernization  and  reconstruction  program  for  2012\u20132017.  IEC  owns  and  operates  the \nSevan\u2013Hrazdan  Cascade  Hydropower  System,  which  supplies  about  10%  of  the  country\u2019s \nelectricity. The  system  has a  significant role in  supporting  the  balance  of  the  electric grid,  and \nalso provides more affordable energy than thermal power plants. Given ADB\u2019s recent financing \nof  private  infrastructure  in  the  country2 and  the  fact  that  the  private  banking  market  is  still \nhesitant  to  provide  long-term  financing,  IEC  approached  ADB  and  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  with  an  assumption  that  the  project  would  be \nfinanced  by  the  two  banks  on  a  50:50  basis.  [Confidential  information  deleted]  From  initial \ndiscussions  with  IEC,  RusHydro,  and  the  EBRD,  the  project  team  believed  that  the  project \npossesses  sound  fundamentals,  that  ADB\u2019s  participation  will  bring  significant  developmental \nbenefits and demonstration impact, and that it will also send an important signal to the market, \nhelping  build  confidence  for  private  sector  participation  in  Armenia's  renewable  energy \ndevelopment.  It  was  also  noted  that  the  project  could  become  ADB\u2019s  first  loan  to  Armenia\u2019s \npower sector and would also be the first nonsovereign cofinancing by ADB and the EBRD in the \npower sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n4. \nThe project involves the rehabilitation and modernization of four hydropower plants, the \ndiversion  channels  for  three  plants,  and  associated  electrical  equipment  replacement  at  the \nsubstations.  The  planned  rehabilitation  will  be  completed  in  2017.  The  project  aims  to restore \nthe  capacity  of  the  hydropower  plants  by  44.7  megawatts  (MW),  improve  their  reliability  and \nsafety,  and reduce  IEC\u2019s  operational  and  maintenance  expenses.  The  project  will  also  reduce \nwater leakage from the diversion channels and could increase power generated by the system. \nAfter  repair  of  the  diversion  channels,  it  is  estimated  that  water  leakage  will  decrease  by \n\n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2010.

The  initial  owner  of  IEC  was \nINTER RAO, a Russian state-owned company. IEC took ownership of the system In July 2003 \nand obtained a license for generation of electric power in September 2003. In 2010, HydroInvest \n(a subsidiary of RusHydro) acquired  INTER RAO's ownership in IEC, [Confidential information \ndeleted]  and  currently  RusHydro  (through  HydroInvest)  holds  the majority  of the  shares (90%) \nand controls IEC. [Confidential information deleted.] \n \n6. \nThe  system  consists  of  seven  run-of-the-river  hydropower  stations  located  along  a \nwaterway of connected rivers (Hrazdan and Marmarik), canals, and reservoirs, principally fed by \nthe Marmarik River. The system was originally built between 1930 and 1965. Five stations are \noperational  year-round  and  the  remaining  two  stations  work  only  during  the  irrigation  season, \nwhen  additional  water  from  Lake  Sevan  is  released  into  the  system.  The  system\u2019s  year-round \navailable  capacity  is  458.7  MW  and  operational  capacity  is  390  MW,  the  latter  accounting  for \n16% of estimated total current operational capacity in Armenia. A summary of information about \nthe system's seven hydropower plants is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Sevan\u2013Hrazdan Cascade Hydropower System \n\nYear of \nCommissioning \n\nPower \nPlant \nArgel \nArzni \nHrazdan \nKanaker \nSevan \nYerevan 1 \nYerevan 3 \n  Total \nSource: International Energy Corporation. \n\n1953 \n1956 \n1959 \n1936 \n1949 \n1962 \n1960 \n\nNo. of \nUnits \n4 \n3 \n2 \n6 \n2 \n2 \n1 \n20 \n\n \n\nOriginal Installed \nCapacity (MW) \n\nAvailable \nCapacity (MW) \n\nUnavailable \nCapacity (MW) \n\n224.0 \n70.6 \n81.6 \n100.0 \n34.2 \n44.0 \n5.0 \n559.4 \n\n168.0 \n70.6 \n81.6 \n87.5 \n24.0 \n22.0 \n5.0 \n458.7 \n\n56.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n12.5 \n10.2 \n22.0 \n0.0 \n100.7 \n\n \nIEC\u2019s financial position has been affected by its aging assets and insufficient investment. \n7. \nIEC\u2019s assets have been heavily depreciated without capital expenditures, and its balance sheet \nis small. The tariff has been determined based on the asset size, and the revenue has not been \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fsufficiently  strong.  This  created  a  vicious  circle  between  low  asset  value  and  low  revenue. \nHowever,  the  project  (with  ADB  financing  under  RusHydro\u2019s  guarantee)  aims  to  break  the \nvicious  circle. With  investment  to  upgrade the  assets,  the  size  of  the  balance  sheet  will  grow, \nand the revenues will improve with the revised tariff, which incorporates the cost of investment. \n[Confidential information deleted.] \n \n8. \nThe sponsor, RusHydro, was incorporated in 2004 in the Russian Federation as part of \nthe  state  program  for  power  sector  reform  and  creating  a  competitive  industry.  RusHydro  is \n60.4%  state  owned  and  its  remaining  shares  are  publicly  traded  on  the  Moscow  and  London \nstock  exchanges.  RusHydro  is  the  Russian  Federation\u2019s  largest  hydropower  generation \ncompany  and  the  leader  in  renewable  energy  using  water  currents,  sea  tides,  wind,  and \ngeothermal  energy.  The  company  owns  61  power  generation  facilities  with  total  installed \ncapacity of 35,200 MW. RusHydro is currently rated BB+ by Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and \nBa1  by  Moody's,  reflecting  (i) its  strong  business  fundamentals  as  the  Russian  Federation's \nlargest  low-cost  hydropower  generator,  which  is  well  positioned  to  benefit  from  the  country's \nwholesale power market liberalization and should be able to absorb the market fluctuation risk; \nand (ii) the high likelihood that it would receive extraordinary government support in a crisis. \n\n \nTable 3: RusHydro Key Financials (Consolidated) \n(RUB million) \n\n2009 \n\n \n338,460 \n32,112 \n \n98,657 \n506,866 \n405,800 \n\n2010 \n\n \n526,581 \n10,399 \n \n109,534 \n744,993 \n539,568 \n\n2011 \n\n \n362,599 \n29,493 \n \n125,124 \n811,783 \n525,659 \n\nSales and services \nNet profit \n\nItem \nProfit and Loss \n \n \nBalance Sheet \n \n \n \nNote: RUB30.62 = $1 as of 27 February 2013. \nSource: RusHydro. \n \nB. \n\nCurrent assets \nTotal assets \nEquity \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n9. \nThe development impact includes a successful rehabilitation of aging renewable-energy \nproduction  assets.  Successful  implementation  of  the  project  will  increase  the  supply  of \nrenewable energy through facilitating more rehabilitation and new investment in the sector, and \nwill  help  foster  confidence  among  potential  investors  and  lenders  and  promote  further  private \nsector investment in Armenia\u2019s power sector.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n10. \nArmenia\u2019s power consumers will receive up to 600 GWh per year of more reliable low-\ncost,  carbon-efficient  energy  from  the  Sevan\u2013Hrazdan  Cascade  Hydropower  System.  The \nproject\u2019s  operational  safety,  reliability,  and  efficiency  will  increase.  In  addition,  the  successful \nimplementation of the project will contribute to the improvement of environmental performance \nof the system. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n Successful \n\nimplementation  of \n\n11.  \nthe  rehabilitation  and \nmodernization  of  the  system.  The  available  capacity  of  hydropower  plants  in  Armenia  will  be \nrestored by 44.7 MW on completion of the project. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\nthe  project  will  result \n\nin \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n12. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Strategy  2020  in  relation  to  environmentally \nsustainable  growth,  as  one  of  the  three  strategic  agenda  items.  Strategy  2020  emphasizes \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  with  further  emphasis  on  promoting  private  sector  participation.  In \naddition,  Strategy  2020  highlights  ADB's  operational  emphasis  on  expanding  the  use  of  clean \nenergy sources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.3 \n \nThe  country  partnership  strategy  for  Armenia  is  under  preparation  and  expected  to  be \n13. \nfinalized in 2013. The new strategy is expected to emphasize development of the power sector \nand  the  private  sector  as  key  priority  areas.  The  project  is  expected  to  be  consistent  with  the \nforthcoming strategy. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n14. \nThe project is fully consistent with the ADB Energy Policy (2009), which makes support \nfor  renewable  energy  generation  a  key  priority.  The  policy  further  stresses  the  importance  of \nharnessing  energy  efficiency,  which  is  essential  to  improve  energy  security  and  reduce \nemissions of greenhouse gases.4 \n \n[Confidential information deleted.] \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\n15. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nRehabilitation works \n\nRevenue structure \n\nArrangements \nThe project will operate under the general regulatory framework applicable to \nhydropower companies in Armenia. The tariff is set by the PSRC. \nIEC has three directors on its board, all nominated by RusHydro. Key \nmanagement roles are held by (i) A. Grigoryan, general director (previously \ndeputy general director of ENA); (ii) A. Mkhitaryan, director of economics and \nfinance (concurrently advisor to the deputy chairman of RusHydro); and \n(iii) H. Sargsyan, chief engineer (over 20 years of hydropower experience). \n2012\u20132017 \nIEC will procure goods and services for the proposed rehabilitation through \ninternational competitive bidding. Engineering, procurement, and construction \ncontracts will be used to the extent possible. \nIEC has a power purchase agreement with ENA, the sole electricity distributor in \n\n                                                      \n3   ADB.  2008.

Water  savings  are  expected  to  lead  to  higher  electricity \ngeneration. In addition, the government is currently making efforts to increase the water \nlevel  of  Lake  Sevan,  which  was  reduced  significantly  during  the  Soviet  era.  Reducing \nwater leakage will also support this effort of environment conservation. \nADB will provide long-term financing, which is required for successful implementation of \nthe  project  but  not  easily  available  in  the  market.  The  nature  of  the  project  (e.g.,  long \nconstruction period, high upfront capital expenditure, competitive tariffs assuming a long \nasset life) is appropriately financed by long-tenor debt to better match with the cash-flow \nprofile. \nADB facilitated  introduction  of foreign  currency  escalation  in the  project tariff.  ADB  had \nrounds  of  discussion  with  the  PSRC,  the  regulator,  to  ensure  that  the  new  tariff  will \ninclude  key  parameters  to  achieve  a  cost  recovery  level  and  support  the  system\u2019s \nsustainability. The project will need to be financed by  US dollar-denominated long-term \ndebt,  as  the  local  banking  market  does  not  have  capacity  to  provide  long-term  debt  in \nlocal currency. In view of this, the PSRC approved a new tariff reflecting the project cost \nand foreign currency escalation. \nADB  will  contribute  to  strengthening  IEC\u2019s  policies  on  environment,  health,  and  safety. \nIEC  will  implement  the  new  environmental  and  social  management  plan,  which  was \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fprepared with assistance from ADB. ADB will monitor implementation of the plan and will \ncontinue  providing  recommendation  to  ensure  building  up  IEC\u2019s  capacity  to  implement \nthe plan appropriately. \n\n \n[Confidential information deleted.] \n \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n18. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The EBRD, which is cofinancing the project, has classified the project as B \nunder  its  Environmental  and  Social  Policy  (2008).  The  potential  environmental  and  social \nimpacts  of  the  project  have  been  recognized  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize, \nmitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and \nplans.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  IEC  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  are  deemed  adequate.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with \naffected people are conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nA review and audit of IEC\u2019s current management and operations was prepared against \n19. \nADB\u2019s relevant environmental and social policies and principles, Armenian and European Union \nlegal  requirements,  and  the  EBRD\u2019s  performance  requirements.  The  proposed  rehabilitation \nprogram  does  not  require  undergoing  the  environmental  assessment  process  according  to \nArmenian legislations, except for Yerevan 1 reconstruction where reservoir dredging is planned. \nAll works are planned within the existing facilities, channels, hydraulic structures, and property \nboundaries,  and  rehabilitation  does  not  consider  an  increase  of  the  original  capacity  of  the \nhydropower plants. The main environmental impacts and risks from the operations and planned \nrehabilitation  are  related  to  reservoir  management,  including  proposed  dredging  activities  for \nYerevan  1  reconstruction;  management  of  oils  and  lubricants  for  turbines,  transformers,  and \nsupport \nlead  and  acid  batteries;  material  and  waste \nmanagement; and management of occupational and community health, safety, and security. An \nenvironmental  and  social  action  plan  and  corrective  action  plan  were  prepared,  including  an \naction  item  for  preparing  an  environmental  assessment  of  dredging  works  for  Yerevan  1 \nreconstruction  before  dredging  starts. Other key measures  in  the  plan  are pollution  prevention \nfor  oil  and  all  materials  and  wastes,  facilitation  of  agreements  to  solve  community  water \nconnections,  and  strengthening  of  the  emergency  response  plan.  IEC  will  develop  and \nimplement  an  oil  management  plan  to  properly  handle  and  store  raw  and  used  oil  to  prevent \nspillage, include oil spill clean-up procedures, provide for disposal and recycling of used oil and \ndefine roles and responsibilities of staff involved in raw and used oil management. IEC will also \ndevelop and implement a comprehensive waste management plan that will include a description \nof  all  waste  types  generated,  procedures  for  collection,  handling,  labeling,  storage  and \ntransportation  of  wastes  for  each  type,  waste  prevention,  reduction  and  reuse  strategies,  a \nrecord-keeping  system  and  as  well  as  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  staff  involved  in  waste \nmanagement.  IEC  will  strengthen  its  existing  emergency  response  plan  in  order  to  address \n(i) community-related  emergencies,  (ii) risks  from  flooding  from  natural  causes  and  illegal \nconstruction along the natural river course and floodplains, and (iii) risks from failure of company \nfacilities  and  structures.  IEC  will  also  establish  a  corporation-wide  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  based  on  ADB  and  ISO  14001  requirements,  and  adopt  it  at  each \nhydropower  plant.  As  for  protecting  Lake  Sevan,  a  fish  protection  system  is  in  place  and \n\ninfrastructure;  management  of \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fthe  process \n\nA  stakeholder  engagement  plan,  which  describes \n\nrehabilitation of the structures at water diversion point at Lake Sevan is not planned. Thus, the \nplanned rehabilitation will not affect the lake. \n \n20. \nfor  engaging \nstakeholders,  including  information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  and  other \nstakeholders,  was  also  prepared.  The  stakeholder  engagement  plan  also  incorporates  a \ngrievance  mechanism  for  resolving  complaints  about  IEC\u2019s  environmental  performance.  The \nplanned rehabilitation works will be carried out within the existing footprint and no expansion of \nexisting  facilities  is  planned.  Such  rehabilitation  will  not  require  any  additional  land  acquisition \nand there are no indigenous peoples in the project area. There are also no known outstanding \nsocial safeguards issues connected with the facilities to be rehabilitated. \n \nADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \n21. \nrequiring  IEC  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  in  addition,  to  take  specific  measures \n(including in relation to contractors)  in line with internationally recognized core labor standards \nfor  the  ADB-financed  portion  of  the  project,  and  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy. 5  The  project  is  categorized  as  having  no  gender  elements  and  does  not  have \nmeasures to provide benefits specific to women. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption and Anti-Money-Laundering Policies \n\n22. \nIEC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will \nrequire  IEC  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money-laundering \nactivities, and the financing of terrorism, and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in \nsuch activities. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe  proposed  direct  loan  lies  within  the  medium-term  country,  industry,  group,  and \n\n23. \nsingle project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),6 \n24. \nthe Government of Armenia\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to IEC will be obtained. \nADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the Board. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n25. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$25,000,000 to International Energy Corporation for the Sevan\u2013Hrazdan Cascade Hydropower \nSystem  Rehabilitation  Project  in  Armenia  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and \nas may be reported to the Board. \n                                                      \n5   ADB. 2003.
