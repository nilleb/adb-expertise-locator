Punjab  has  achieved  robust \neconomic  growth  and  significant  poverty  reduction  in  recent  years. \nHowever,  it  still  faces  numerous  development  challenges  arising  from \nthe  low  standard  of  living  and  the  high  incidence  of  poverty.  Average \nper  capita  income  in  the  province  is  only  about  $1,000.  The  poverty \nratio  remains  high  at  over  20%.  The  level  of  well-being  measured  by \nsocial indicators is also low. Punjab's infrastructure is underdeveloped. \nThere  is  an  acute  power  shortage,  and  90%  of  the  provincial  road \nnetwork  is  rated  as  fair  to  poor.  Punjab  lacks  sufficient  employment \nopportunities. Each year nearly 1.6 million youths enter the labor force. \nThe official unemployment rate of 8% reflects prevalent underreporting.  \n \nAddressing  Punjab's  challenges  requires  the  province  to  maintain \ninclusive growth at 7%\u20138% per annum. Yet, long-term economic growth \nsince the 1970s has been only about 5%. Inclusive growth requires the \nprovision  of  infrastructure  and  social  services  to  enable  the  poor  and \nvulnerable, including women, to participate in development.   \n \nThe  Government  of  Punjab  (the  government)  has  made  accelerating \nincome  growth  and  improving  social  services  its  twin  development \nobjectives.  Punjab\u2019s  Vision  2020  envisages  the  doubling  of  per  capita \nincome  to  about  $2,000  by  2020  and  significantly  improving  service \ndelivery.  The  government  has  identified  an  efficient,  accountable,  and \ncapable  public  sector  and  a  dynamic  private  sector  as  the  institutional \nfoundations for  achieving  these  objectives.  These  factors  underpin  the \ndesign of the PGEIP.  \n\n \nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n \n\n \nProgram \nDescription \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nThe  PGEIP  is  a  program  cluster  comprising  three  single-tranche \nsubprograms.  The  proposed  subprogram  2  builds  upon  and  expands \nthe subprogram 1 reform agenda. The subprogram 2 supports reforms \nin five key policy areas:  \n \n(i) \n\npublic  financial  management:  the  adoption  of  output-based \nbudgets that link expenditures to service delivery;  \ncontingent  liability  management:  partly  funding  pension  and \nGeneral Provident (GP) Fund liabilities;  \ncivil  service  management:  linking  performance  with  service \ndelivery indicators, as well as private sector development; \npromoting  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  for  infrastructure \nand  social  service  delivery;  especially  education  and  health \nservices; and \nresults-based  management \npromoting \naccountability for results in public sector management.  \n\n(RBM): \n\ngreater \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe RBM is a new core policy area introduced in subprogram 2 drawing \non  lessons  learned  in  the  first  subprogram.  The  PGEIP  will  help  the \ngovernment  achieve  high,  sustained,  and  private  sector\u2013driven  growth \nand improved service delivery. The outcome of subprogram 2 is greater \ngovernment efficiency, accountability, and capability. \n \nTwo loans are proposed for subprogram 2:   \n \n(i) \n\nA  loan  of  $75  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nunder the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum; and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \nA  loan  of  $75  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund \nresources,  with  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n\nlending \n\n(i) \n\n \nPakistan  will  be  the  borrower.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  will  relend \nthe local currency generated from the loan proceeds to the Government \nof  Punjab.  The  terms  and  conditions  will  be  the  same  as  those \nextended by ADB to Pakistan. The Government of Punjab will assume \nforeign exchange and interest rate risks.   \n \nThe  government  has  requested  $250  million  for  subprograms  2  and  3 \nas  envisaged  in  the  preparation  of  the  program  cluster.  The  loan  size \nand composition for subprogram 3 will be confirmed during processing \non  the  bases  of  reform  progress,  requirements,  and  the  availability  of \nresources. \n  \n\n\f \n\n \n\niii\n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency  \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\nfor \n\nfinance  expenditures \n\nThe government will ensure that the local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the loans will be used, first, to support the adjustment costs \nof  reforms  to  be  initiated  and  implemented  under  subprogram  2  and, \nsecond, \nthe  government\u2019s  general \nto \ndevelopment purposes.  \n \nThe implementation period of PGEIP is from July 2006 to around March \n2011.  Subprogram  2  covers  reform  measures  implemented  from \nJanuary 2008 to September 2009. The loans are single tranche loans to \nbe  disbursed  upon  satisfaction  of  policy  actions  under  subprogram  2 \nand following loan effectiveness. The proposal for subprogram 3 will be \nsubmitted  for  Board  consideration  about  18\u201320  months  after  loan \neffectiveness for subprogram 2, subject to the government\u2019s readiness \nto continue with its reform agenda.  \n \nThe  Planning  and  Development  Department  of  the  Government  of \nPunjab will be the Executing Agency.  \n \nSubprogram  2  uses  the  same  implementation  arrangements  as \nsubprogram  1.  A  senior  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  chief \nsecretary  of  the  government  and  comprising  members  from  the  public \nand  private  sectors  guides  program  implementation.  An  executive \ncommittee under the planning and development chairman oversees and \nensures  efficient  program  implementation.  The  program  management \nunit coordinates program implementation. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \nlocal  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB \nmember countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed from \nother bilateral and multilateral sources. ADB will have the right to audit \nthe use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s \ncertification. Loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Borrower according \nto  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998).  \n \nThe PGEIP is expected to yield the following benefits for the residents \nof Punjab.   \n \nMore efficient use of public financial resources. The shift from input- \nto output-based budgets will strengthen efficiency and accountability in \nthe  use  of  public  resources.  The  rationalization  of  many  underfunded \nprojects will increase the efficiency of public investment.  \n \nImproved  financial  sustainability  for  the  pension  system.  The \npartial  prefunding  of  the  pension  and  GP  Fund  will  improve  system \nsustainability,  alleviate  the  pension  outlay  on  the  current  budget,  and\u00a0\nreduce\u00a0 contingent\u00a0\nliabilities.  It  will  promote  savings  and  asset \naccumulation, which will contribute to growth. Better record-keeping will \nreduce leakages and improve accountability.  \n \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n \n\n \nAssumption, Risks, \nand Safeguards \n\nAn  efficient,  accountable,  and  capable  civil  service.  More  efficient \ninstitutional  structures,  simpler  business  procedures,  better  human \nresource  management,  and  improved  capacity  in  the  public  sector  will \nimprove the performance of the government.   \n \nA dynamic private sector. The establishment of policy and institutional \nframeworks for PPP will enable Punjab to benefit from both public and \nprivate resources, resulting in more and better infrastructure and social \nservice delivery.      \n \nGreater focus on accountability. The adoption of RBM will transform \npublic  sector  management  from  micro  control  to  a  greater  focus  on \nresults.  This  combination  of  accountability  for  results  and  flexibility  for \nmanagement is the hallmark of modern public sector management and \nwill modernize government operations in Punjab.  \n \nGender  benefits.  Punjab's  result  framework  explicitly  spells  out \ngovernment  targets  on  gender  equity,  particularly  in  health  and \neducation. The subprogram 2 has helped to identify large funding gaps \nand  increased  budget  allocation  in  the  health  sector,  with  positive \nbenefits  to woman  and  children  through  increased  access to  medicine \nand improved medical facilities. The budgeting and planning processes \nin  Punjab  are  paying  increased  attention  to  gender  equity  in  budget \nallocations. Institutions that are tasked to work on gender equity, such \nas the Directorate of Women\u2019s Development, have been set up to carry \nout the gender reform action plan.    \n \nAll  the  benefits  will  contribute  to  employment  creation,  inclusive \neconomic growth, and improved service delivery.   \n \nMajor risks are summarized below.  \n \nSecurity risks. The number of violent assaults has increased in recent \nmonths in Pakistan, and the frequency of such incidents has increased \nin  Punjab.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  is  implementing  measures  to \ncontain security risks. Sustained economic growth and stability are key \nto achieving peace and prosperity in the country.   \n \nPolitical  risks. Political tension, compounded by justice sector issues, \nresulted  in  March  2009  in  the  dismissal  of  an  elected  government  in \nPunjab,  which  was  subsequently  reinstated.  Recent  developments \nindicate  a  more  cooperative  approach  between  major  political  parties. \nThe risk of reversing the directions of program reforms is low given the \nbroad consensus on reforms.   \n \nMacroeconomic  risks.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  has  launched  a \nstabilization  program  to  improve  the  macroeconomic  situation  and \nrestore investor confidence. ADB is a major partner through its support \nunder  the  Accelerating  Economic  Transformation  Program,  which \nprovides  measures  to  deal  with  short-term  shocks  and  address  long-\nterm  structural  issues.  PGEIP  measures  to  tackle  institutional  and \npolicy  impediments  to  growth  in  Punjab  will  help  to  reduce  economic \nvulnerability in the medium term. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n\n \nWeak capacity. With the help of a technical assistance loan and grant, \nthe  program  management  unit  and  departments \ninvolved  are \naddressing  capacity \nimplementing  agency \nlimitations.  Enhancing \nownership of the PGEIP has helped to mitigate implementation risks.  \n \nIntergovernmental  coordination.  The  civil  service  reform  component \nof subprogram 2 requires effective intergovernmental coordination. The \nupfront work being done on civil service reforms has been disseminated \nwidely.  Change  management,  including  stakeholder  consultation  and \ncommunication,  forms  an  important  part  of  program  implementation  to \nlessen resistance and increase support for reforms.    \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  two  proposed \nloans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the second subprogram of the Punjab Government \nEfficiency Improvement Program (PGEIP).1    \n \n\nII. \n\nMACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nAgainst \n\nlaunched \n\nthis  background, \n\nthe  Government  of  Pakistan \n\nPakistan. Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 7% annually on average from \n2. \nfiscal year (FY) 2002 to FY2008. Per capita income doubled to about $1,000, and the poverty \nincidence reduced significantly over this period.2 Economic conditions have worsened since late \nFY2008,  however,  amid  rising  world  oil  and  food  prices,  global  financial  turmoil,  domestic \npolitical instability, and the deteriorating security situation. Growth slowed from 7.5% in FY2007 \nto 5.8% in FY2008 and is expected to be 3.4% in FY2009. The fiscal deficit rose to 7.4% and \nthe  current  account  deficit  widened  to  8.4%  of  GDP  in  FY2008,  and  inflation  reached  25%  in \nOctober 2008. A serious debt overhang in the power sector has aggravated the already acute \npower shortage and seriously disrupted economic activity and investment.   \n \n3. \nits  Economic \nStabilization Program and entered into a 23-month stand-by arrangement with the International \nMonetary Fund in November 2008. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been a key partner \nin  stabilization  efforts,  with  a  focus  on  social  safety  nets  and  structural  reforms  in  energy  and \nfinance  through  the  Accelerating  Economic  Transformation  Program.3 Signs  of  recovery  have \nemerged  as  fiscal  and  current  account  deficits  declined,  the  exchange  rate  stabilized,  and \ninflation abated, though macroeconomic conditions are still vulnerable.  \n \n4. \nPunjab.  Punjab  is  the  largest  provincial  economy  of  Pakistan.  Its  provincial  GDP  is \nestimated at about $72 billion, or 50% of the national total. It is also the most populous province, \nwith  87  million  inhabitants,  or  56%  of  the  country\u2019s  population.  The  economic  performance  of \nPunjab plays a critical role in the overall economic strength of Pakistan. \n \n5. \nPunjab  has  achieved  robust  economic  performance  in  recent  years.  Between  FY2002 \nand FY2007, growth averaged over 7%, GDP per capita doubled, the poverty head-count ratio \ndeclined by about 11 percentage points to 20%, and key social indicators significantly improved. \nHowever, economic conditions have deteriorated since late 2007, as in the rest of the country. \nThe revised estimate for the FY2009 budget deficit is PRs95.8 billion, triple that of the previous \nyear and the original estimate (see Supplementary Appendix A). Federal fiscal transfers account \nfor about 80% of provincial revenue. Any shortfall in transfers reduces the ability of the province \nto pursue its own development objectives. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Appendix 1 presents the design and monitoring framework for subprogram 2. \n2  The extent of poverty reduction is debated. While the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey \n2005 estimated that poverty declined from 34.5% in FY2002 to 23.9% in FY2006, the World Bank estimated that \npoverty  incidence  declined  from  34.5%  to  29.2%  over  the  same  period.  Either  estimate  represents  a  significant \nreduction  in  poverty.  Government  of  Pakistan,  Federal  Bureau  of  Statistics.  2006.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors \non  the  Proposed  Program  Cluster  and  Loans  for  Subprogram  2  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  Accelerating \nEconomic Transformation Program. Manila (June). \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nLong-Term Economic Performance and Development Challenges \n\nPunjab faces a number of interlinked development challenges, chief among them the low \n6. \nstandard of living and the high poverty incidence. Average per capita income in Punjab is about \n$1,000,  which  is  only  two-thirds  of  the  average  of  low  middle  income  countries.  Income \ninequality  is  high.  Poverty  incidence  remained  over  20%  in  20074,  the  most  recent  year  for \nwhich data are available, and is likely to have increased since then with the economic slowdown.    \n \n7. \nSocial  indicators  are  poor  in  Punjab.  Over  one-third  of  children  under  the  age  of  5  are \nunderweight. The infant mortality rate of 71 per 1,000, and the maternal mortality rate of 300 per \n100,000  are  double  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  targets.  The  literacy  rate  for \nchildren 10 years of age and above is only 56%. Nearly 9.6 million children of school-going age, \nor 30%, are out of school. Only half of the population is served by piped water systems. There \nare  large  gender,  income,  and  rural\u2013urban  inequalities.  Gender  disparity  is  particularly \npronounced.  The  female  literacy  rate  for  age  15  and  above  is  35.2%,  about  half  that  of  men. \nUnderemployment is 45% for women, compared to 8% for men. The estimated earned income \nfor females is only about one-third of that for males.   \n \nPunjab's infrastructure is underdeveloped. An acute power crisis brings frequent outages. \n8. \nA survey of 650 firms noted that 80% of firms complained that the most important deterrent to \ninvesting  was  power  shortages.5 About  90%  of  the  provincial  road  network  is  rated  as  fair  to \npoor.  Poor  urban  infrastructure  impairs  the  competitiveness  of  Punjab  cities,  affects  the \nenvironment and health conditions, and dampens investment.    \n \n9. \nEmployment is the most direct route for income generation. As of June 2007, Punjab's \nlabor  force  stood  at  50.3  million.  The  official  unemployment  rate  of  8%  reflects  prevalent \nunderreporting.  The  labor  force  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  3.2%,  and  nearly  1.6  million  youths \nenter  the  labor  force  each  year.  Lack  of  productive  employment  opportunities  is  a  serious \nproblem. Further, 74% of nonagricultural employed labor in Punjab is in the informal sector, and \nthe share for female workers in informal employment is even higher.    \n \n10. \nAddressing  Punjab's  development  challenges  will  not  be  possible  without  rapid  and \nsustained economic growth. However, the long-term growth rate of Punjab since the 1970s has \nbeen about 5.1%, falling short of the desired rate of 7%\u20138% per annum. Punjab's growth should \nbe inclusive. This requires the provision of infrastructure and social services to enable the poor \nand vulnerable, including women, to participate in economic development.   \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities  \n\n11. \nA  key  problem  leading  to  the  challenges  in  Punjab  is  the  poor  quality  of  public \ninstitutions and lack of accountability for results. A problem tree summarizing this development \nproblem and its major causes and effects is presented in Figure 1. More details on issues and \nopportunities are in Appendix 2. \n\n                                                 \n4   Unless  stated  otherwise,  data  quoted  in  this  section  are  from  Government  of  Punjab.  2007.

Budgeting  in  Punjab  follows  a  dual  system.  The  Finance  Department \n12. \nprepares  and  manages  the  recurrent  budget,  and  P&DD  manages  the  development  budget. \nRecurrent  budget  estimates  are  based  on  historical  trends,  with  yearly  increments  to  cover \nadditional costs. Thus, budgeting in Punjab is input-based and incremental.  \n \n13. \nIncomplete  medium-term  budgetary  framework  (MTBF)  implementation.  The \nincremental and input-oriented approach to budgeting suffers multiple weaknesses. The lack of \nreliable  estimates  and  enforcement  of  the  resource  envelope  for  the  province  or  of  strategic \nallocation  for  each  sector  leads  to  poor  budget  allocation,  especially  for  development  plans, \nwhich remain severely underfunded. Budget outturns for expenditures deviate significantly from \nbudget allocations. Line departments often require supplementary grants during the fiscal year. \nBudget allocations do not adequately reflect service delivery goals and priorities. The allocations \nfor key expenditure components, development, non-salary recurrent, and recurrent expenditures \nare often out of sync with one another. There has been chronic under-allocation for non-salary \nrecurrent expenditure, such as operation and maintenance (O&M) and medicine expenditures in \nthe health sector. This mismatch causes waste and poor service delivery.      \n \n14. \nThe  adoption  of  the  MTBF  will  improve  the  efficiency  and  accountability  of  public \nfinancial  management.  The  MTBF  comprises  two  major  components:  (i)  a  strategic,  or  top\u2013\ndown,  element,  and  (ii)  a  bottom\u2013up,  output-based  budgeting  element.  The  top\u2013down \ndimension6 requires  the  Finance  Department  to  define  budget  ceilings  for  each  department  in \naccordance  with  the  Government  of  Punjab's  (the  government)  development  goals,  while  the \nbottom\u2013up dimension requires line departments to prioritize and match their expenditures with \nmeasurable  service  delivery  outputs  within  budget  ceilings.  The  MTBF  thus  provides  a \nstructured process through which a department translates its mission into tangible targets in line \nwith resource constraints. Supported by subprogram 1, the government adopted the top\u2013down \ndimension of the MTBF for FY2008 to FY2010. However, the bottom\u2013up dimension has not yet \nbeen introduced.   \n \n15. \nContinued weak coordination between budgeting and planning. The dual budgeting \nsystem impedes the integration of budgeting and planning. The Finance Department and P&DD \nfollow their own respective calendars and issue separate instructions for formulating the budget \nand development plans. Inconsistencies arise for lack of coherence between the budgeting and \nplanning systems, wasting resources. To address the problem, single units were established by \nthe  Department  of  Irrigation  and  Power  (DI&P)  and  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  under \nPGEIP  subprogram  1  and  the  Punjab  MDGs  Program  to  oversee  the  preparation  of  both  the \ncurrent  and  the  development  budget.  Joint  protocols  were  adopted  in  2007  to  allow  a  joint \nreview  by  the  Finance  Department  and  P&DD  for  the  two  pilot  departments.  However,  these \nmechanisms were yet to be operational at the end of subprogram 1.  \n \nUnderutilized  development  expenditures.  Punjab's  annual  development  program \n16. \n(ADP)  for  FY2009  was  PRs160  billion,  accounting  for  38%  of  the  budget.  While  the  throw-\nforward for the whole ADP has been kept at about 3 years, it varies by sector. In some sectors, \nsuch  as  irrigation,  the  throw-forward  can  extend  to  more  than  20  years.  About  80%  of  new \nschemes  are  unapproved,  and  there  are  no  rules  to  ensure  their  speedy  approval  during  the \n\n                                                 \n6 The top\u2013down dimension of the MTBF is also referred to as the medium-term fiscal framework.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nfiscal year. During midyear reviews of the ADP, funds are reallocated from slow-moving to fast-\nmoving  schemes,  but  this  is  subject  to  P&DD  discretion. No  rules  exist  for  the  prioritization  of \ndevelopment schemes.   \n \n17.  Weak revenue mobilization. Own-source revenue generation is hampered by complex \ntax  structures,  weak  tax  administration  capacity,  and  leakage.  The  Excise  and  Taxation \nDepartment (E&TD) administers eight taxes, of which the urban immovable property tax (UIPT) \nand  the  motor  vehicles  tax  (MVT)  have  the  strongest  revenue  potential.  No  survey  has  been \nundertaken for the UIPT since 2001, which results in considerably undervalued property. About \n50%  of  the UIPT  tax  base  is  exempt,  amounting  to  PRs2.4  billion  in  foregone  revenues.  MVT \nadministration  has  been  inefficient,  with  incomplete  automation  of  collection.  Tax  assessment \nand collection are not separated, and there is no effective audit or internal control. This is further \ncomplicated by tax administration being split between E&TD and the Board of Revenue.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNeed for an Affordable and Sustainable Civil Service Pension System \n\nBackground.  With  about  1  million  civil  servants  and  415,000  pensioners,  the \n18. \ngovernment is the largest employer in the province. Upon retirement, civil servants are entitled \nto  a  monthly  pension  and  a  lump-sum  General  Provident  Fund  (GP  Fund)  payment.  The \npension  is  paid  from  the  budget,  while  the  GP  Fund  payment  is  financed  from  monthly \ncontributions deducted from civil servants' salaries.    \n \n19. \nInadequate financing and reporting of pension and GP Fund costs and liabilities. \nPension payments have increased at a rate of 12.1% per annum during the last 13 years; and \nare  projected  to  grow  by  14%  per  year  in  nominal  terms  over  the  next  20  years.  During  the \npreparation  of  subprogram  1,  an  actuarial  study 7 estimated  the  accrued  pension  liability  at \nPRs425 billion as of 30 June 2007 and the pension expenditure for FY2009 at PRs15.1 billion, \nconsuming  almost  6%  of  the  recurrent  budget.  In  the  case  of  the  GP  Fund,  the  government \nspent  PRs3.7  billion  in  FY2009.  GP  Fund  costs  and  liabilities  have  steadily  risen  due  to  the \ncompounding effect of very high interest payments in the past.  \n \n20. \nFaced with rising pension and GP Fund costs and liabilities, the government created the \nPunjab  Pension  Fund  (PPF)  in  March  2007  and  adopted  a  financing  strategy  to  prefinance \npension costs. The government initially aimed to accumulate PRs100 billion by FY2016, with the \nexpectation of meeting approximately 30% of the annual expenditures from investment income. \nThe government has not been on track to reach this funding target during the past few years for \nthe reasons set forth in para. 57 (see also Supplementary Appendix B). The financing strategy \nneeds  to  be  reevaluated  using  realistic  expectations.  In  addition,  a  proper  accounting  and \nreporting system for pension and GP Fund costs needs to be developed to assist management \nand policy planning. \n \n21. \nLack  of  access  to  reliable  and  complete  data.  Record-keeping  and  benefit \ncalculations are largely manual and on paper. A computerized system was developed under the \nPIFRA  to  automate  the  accounting  and  auditing  system,  using  the  software  Systems, \nApplications,  and  Products  in  Data  Processing/Third  Generation  (SAP/R3).  The  database \nincludes a human resource module that updates records on payroll, pensions, and the GP Fund. \nThe pace and accuracy of data entry are low. At the time of the actuarial valuation in May 2009, \ninformation  on  29%  of  current  employees  was  entered  in  the  SAP/R3  database,  and  no \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2007.  Actuarial  Valuation  of  Punjab  Government  Pension  Scheme  (prepared  by  Nauman  A.  Cheema). \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\ninformation  was  entered  on  pensioners.  Thus  the  information  available  is  insufficient  in  both \nquantity  and  quality  for  managing  pension  and  GP  Fund  payments.  The  absence  of  a \ncomprehensive and up-to-date record-keeping and information management system, combined \nwith  weak  financial  analysis  and  accounting  capacity,  causes  inaccuracies  in  pension \nentitlement calculations and individual payments.  \n \n\n3. \n\nNeed for a Merit-Based and Accountable Civil Service \n\nBackground.  The  Punjab  public  sector  employs  11%  of  all  employed  workers  in  the \n22. \nprovince, making it the largest employer in the formal sector. The civil service wage and pension \nbill  accounts  for  60%  of  total  consolidated  recurrent  expenditure.  The  civil  service  system  is \ncommonly perceived to be weak and suffering a broad spectrum of problems.    \n \n23.  Weak functions, business processes, and human resource management systems. \nCivil service reforms need to result in a clear division of responsibilities between the private and \npublic  sectors.  The  responsibilities  of  the  government  in  owning,  managing,  and  operating \ncommercial  activities  should  be  reduced.  Government  procedures  in  Punjab  are  considered \nlengthy  and  cumbersome.  The  human  resource  management  system  of  Punjab  is  ineffective. \nThere  are  few  management  tools.  Promotion  is  by  seniority  and  rigidly  defined  by  the  All \nPakistan Unified Grades. There is little chance for technical staff to be promoted to senior levels. \nCompensation is fixed8 for each grade, and there is no room for rewarding performance in the \nmainstream system. Compensation is characterized by the prevalence of fringe benefits such as \nhousing  and  cars  that,  coupled  with  poor  asset  management,  create  an  opaque  and  wasteful \nsystem. Recruitment is slow, and the process is not rigorous for non-cadre staff. Training plays \na little role in skill development. This absence of adequate human resource management tools \nhas  frustrated  managers  and  caused  the  overuse  of  administrative  orders  and  frequent  staff \ntransfers, both of which disrupt performance. For staff, this system provides little motivation to \nperform, grow, or develop in line with organization goals. \n \n\n4. \n\nNeed for Dynamic Private Sector\u2013Led Growth   \n\n24. \nBackground. Punjab's private sector plays an important role in Pakistan, accounting, for \nexample,  for  over  half  of  the  country\u2019s  industrial  production  and  about  70%  of  manufacturing \nestablishments. The elasticity of outputs with respect to employment in most industries is above \n1, indicating that a 1% increase in outputs leads to an increase of more than 1% in employment. \nIn recent years, Punjab's industrial sector experienced robust growth and generated many new \nemployment  opportunities.  Despite  this,  the  business  climate  is  constrained  by  regulatory \nhurdles, low human capital, and poor infrastructure.  \n  \n25. \nNeed  to  remove  infrastructure  bottlenecks  through  PPP.  Weak  infrastructure  has \nparticularly hindered industrial performance in Punjab. A power crisis causing frequent outages \nundermines business. The unsatisfactory state of the transportation network has imposed large \ncosts  on  the  economy.  Lack  of  repair  and  maintenance  has  caused  rapid  deterioration,  with \n90% of the provincial network rated as fair to poor. In recent years, PPPs have emerged as a \nmajor instrument for financing and providing public services, gradually replacing the traditional \npublic  sector  modality.  The  government  has  introduced  several  partnership  models.  However, \nmainstreaming  PPP  requires  enabling  policy  and  institutional  frameworks  that  are  not  well \n\n                                                 \n8   This  system  distinguishes  seniority  into  22  basic  pay  scale  grades  and  defines  how  many  years  of  services  are \n\nrequired for each grade.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\ndeveloped  in  the  province.  There  are  acute  capacity  constraints,  with  very  little  experience  in \ndeveloping PPP projects.   \n \nC. \n\nDevelopment Partner Support of Reforms in Punjab \n\nThe  government  fully  recognizes  the  development  challenges  and  issues,  and  has \n\n26. \nidentified six pillars of reforms to address ongoing challenges: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nfiscal  and  public \n\nfinancial  management  and \n\nimproving \nresults-oriented medium-term planning and budgeting system, \nestablishing a well-funded and adequate pension system, \nfostering an efficient civil service, \npromoting private sector\u2013led growth and public\u2013private partnership (PPP),  \naccomplishing the MDGs, and \nimproving  access  to  justice  to  enhance  legal  and  regulatory  certainty  and \nenforceability in all economic spheres. \n\ninstituting  a \n\n \n27. \nThe government has established strong development partnerships with the ADB, World \nBank,  and  other  development  agencies  to  leverage  resources,  reinforce  commitment  towards \nreforms,  and  benefit  from  technical  assistance.  Due  to  the  reform  efforts  and  increased \nresources,  Punjab's  economic  and  social  indicators  have  improved.  For  example,  the  net \nenrollment  rate  in  primary  school  is  57%,  up  from  44%  in  1999.  Immunization  coverage  rose \nfrom 57% in 2002 to 76% in 2007. Much remains to be done, however. The key reform efforts \nsupported by development partners are discussed below.  \n \n28. \nDevelopment  Partnership  with  ADB.  Prior  to  2007,  ADB  assistance  to  Punjab's \nreforms  focused  on  (i)  public  resource  management  through  the  implementation  of  two \nsubprograms  under  the  Punjab  Public  Resource  Management  Program  (PRMP) 9  and \n(ii) support  for  local  governments  and  service  delivery  through  the  Punjab  Devolved  Social \nServices  Program.  Punjab  has  taken  part  in  federally  administered  ADB  programs  like  the \nAccess  to  Justice  Program10 and  the  Decentralization  Support  Program.11 These  reforms  are \nreferred to as the first generation reforms.  \n \n29. \nThe government launched in 2007 its second-generation reforms, which identified the six \npillars of reforms (para.26). Given the need for financing as well as reinforcing the impetus for \nreforms,  it  sought  ADB  support  for  all  six  pillars.  The  first  four  pillars  have  been  supported \nthrough the PGEIP cluster. As a follow-on to the Punjab Devolved Social Services Program,12 \nsubprogram 1 of the Punjab MDGs Program13 supports the fifth pillar of reforms and focuses on \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2005.

The  government  has  requested  ADB  assistance  in \nimproving  access  to  justice.14 ADB  is  assisting  Pakistan  through  the  Accelerating  Economic \nTransformation Program and other programs whose benefits flow to provinces, including Punjab.     \n \nADB-funded  programs  in  Punjab  reflect  the  government's  medium-term  development \n30. \nagenda. Imbued with the spirit of inclusive growth, the design of subprogram 2 reflects the five \nstrategic drivers of change in ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020): \n(i) private sector development and private sector operations, (ii) good governance and capacity \ndevelopment, (iii) knowledge solutions, (iv) partnerships, and (v) gender equity.15 The PGEIP is \nconsistent  with  the  Country  Partnership  Strategy  (2009-2013)16 for  Pakistan,  which  identifies \ngovernance and institutional bottlenecks as binding constraints on economic growth.   \n \nOther  Donor  Assistance. The World Bank, Department for International Development \n31. \n(DFID) of the United Kingdom, and other multilateral and bilateral partners are actively engaged \nin  supporting  economic  and  social  sector  reforms  in  Punjab.  The  Project  for  Improvement  in \nFinancial  Reporting  and  Auditing  (PIFRA),  supported  by  the  World  Bank,  aims  to  improve  the \naccuracy  and  timeliness  of  federal,  provincial,  and  district  financial  reports.  The  World  Bank\u2013\nsupported Punjab Education Sector Reform Program aims to improve the quality and quantity of \neducation  available.  DFID  has  supported  public  financial  management,  civil  service  reforms, \nand private sector development under the PRMP umbrella.    \n  \n32. \nDevelopment Partner Coordination. Development partner coordination is supported by \ngovernment-led efforts in the spirit of the Paris Declaration. All development partner assistance \nis channeled through the Planning and Development Department (P&DD) as the nodal agency. \nBecause of its critical role in the reforms, the PRMP program management unit (PMU) has been \nassigned the role of donor coordination in governance reforms. This institutionalization of donor \ncoordination  has  facilitated  regular  coordination  meetings  with  all  the  partners  involved. \nAppendix 3 provides details on development partner assistance and coordination in Punjab. \n \nD. \n\nLessons \n\nLessons  from  implementing  subprogram  1  and  other  operations  in  Pakistan  are \n\n33. \nsummarized below.   \n \n34. \nFocus  on  delivering  results.  Implementation  of  subprogram  1  highlights  that  public \nsector management in Punjab is input, activity, and procedure focused; and suffers from a lack \nof  clarity  and  accountability  on  results.  There  are  few  strategic  alignments  between  the \ngovernment's  long-term  vision,  medium-term  strategic  frameworks,  and  annual  budget  and \nhuman resource management structures.   \n \nReflecting these observations, subprogram 2 includes a new core policy area (CPA) to \n35. \nintroduce  Results-based  management  (RBM)  to  Punjab.  RBM  is  a  modern  public  sector \nmanagement approach that focuses on achieving development objectives by linking results with \nefficient  public  financial  and  human  resource  management.  It  has  been  successfully \nimplemented  by  many  countries,  most  notably  Malaysia  and  Canada.  More  and  more \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB  is  currently  preparing  the  program  completion  report  for  the  ADB-funded  Access  to  Justice  Program  in \n\nPakistan, which will examine options for moving forward in this area in Pakistan.  \n\n15  ADB.  2008.

Pakistan Country Partnership Strategy 2009-2013. Islamabad, Pakistan. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nis  a  prerequisite \n\nfor  successful  program \n\ndeveloping  countries  are  adopting  RBM.  Punjab  is  keen  to  benefit  from  the  lessons  of \nsuccessful international experiences on implementing RBM. \n \n36. \nThe RBM CPA ties in closely with the other reform areas of the Program. The inclusion \nof this new CPA demonstrates that programs need to be regularly evaluated and reengineered \nfor  better  outcomes.  As  such,  reform  programs  need  to  retain  flexibility  in  adjusting  policy \nactions to respond to changing circumstances and incorporating lessons learned.       \n \nAlign development partner support with governments' own reform agenda. Strong \n37. \ngovernment  ownership \nimplementation.  The \nimplementation  of  the  PRMP  and  PGEIP  subprogram  1  indicates  that  assistance  from \ndevelopment partners plays a catalytic role in setting desired changes in motion, provided that \nthere  is  strong  government  ownership  and  commitment.  External  assistance  by  itself  cannot \nsubstitute for government commitment and actions. The policy agenda needs to be backed by \nbroader country or provincial reforms that are owned and driven by the government.     \n \nCultivate broad support for reforms. Program reforms should have strong stakeholder \n38. \nsupport.  The  PGEIP  has  particularly  benefited  from  this  strength.  The  new  government  that \ncame into power in February 2008 took time to review the program and has taken full ownership \nfrom September 2008. While this change of government delayed implementation somewhat, the \nprogram  gained  stronger  momentum  after  the  government's  review.  The  PGEIP  supported \nregular  stakeholder  consultation  and  active  change-management  efforts,  which  have  been \nessential for designing reforms that are owned, understood, and supported by key stakeholders.  \n \nAlign resources and incentives with desired outcomes. Most programs involve one \n39. \nexecuting agency (EA) and several implementing agencies (IAs). Implementation arrangements \nneed to strike a balance between fostering the central role of the EA and creating ownership in \neach IA.  \n \n40. \nAllow  sufficient  time  for  TA  implementation.  The  implementation  time  for  past  TA \nwas  often  too  short,  leaving  insufficient  time  for  recruiting  firms  as  opposed  to  individual \nconsultants.  The  management  of  a  large  number  of  individual  consultants  complicates  quality \ncontrol.  TA  design  needs  to  allow  at  least  1  year  for  recruiting  firms  in  the  case  of  Pakistan, \ngiven  the  tight  supply  of  qualified  consultants.  Procurement  and  implementation  procedures \nneed to be simplified to increase efficiency, while building in strong accountability mechanisms.   \n \n41.  Build  reform  momentum.  Programs  may  target  complex  reform  areas,  which  require \nsustained  implementation  for  reforms  to  deliver  desired  benefits  over  the  long  term.  While \ncomplex  reforms  need  to  be  confronted,  often  overlooked  are  the  easy  wins  and  the  low-\nhanging  fruit  that  can  demonstrate  sorely  needed  early  success  and  give  impetus  to  reforms. \nThus, while an ambitious reform agenda is commendable, programs should include achievable \nresults over the shorter term to sustain momentums for reforms.  \n \nCountry-specific lessons were identified by the Country Assistance Program Evaluation17 \n42. \nfor Pakistan. The Country Assistance Program Evaluation found that the success of large ADB \nprograms  was  hindered  by  covering  too  many  sectors  with  too  few  staff,  complex  project \ndesigns,  and  inadequate  analytical  work.  The  completion  report  for  the  Pakistan  Country \nStrategy  and  Program  2002\u2013200618 observed  that  reforms  in  Pakistan  advance  incrementally \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB, Operations Evaluation Department. 2007.

Islamabad.  \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nand that there was a need for continued ADB support. ADB\u2019s new program-centered approach \nin  the  social  sectors  has  the  potential  to  demonstrate  better  results  than  the  earlier  project-\nbased support for education, health, and water supply and sanitation. The Country Assistance \nProgram  Evaluation  and  Country  Strategy  and  Program  completion  report  observed  that \nreforms need to be constantly fine-tuned to ensure they remain relevant and responsive to the \ncountry\u2019s needs.  \n  \n43. \nThe  PGEIP  has  incorporated  these  lessons.  It  is  closely  aligned  with  the  government \nvision  and  strategy  and  ADB's  long-term  strategy  and  the  Pakistan  Country  Partnership \nStrategy,  (2009-2013).  It  adopts  a  flexible  cluster  approach  that  takes  into  consideration  the \npolitical  economy  of  reforms,  as  reflected  in  the  sequencing,  and  gradually  builds  upon  and \nincreases the depth and breadth of reforms. The PGEIP reflects strong ownership by relevant \ndepartments. Because of these strengths, the PGEIP has remained on track despite changes in \npolitical leadership in the province.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n44. \nPunjab  today  is  home  to  87  million  people,  and  is  still  a  relatively  underdeveloped \nprovince:  per  capita  income  is  low,  poverty  is  high,  there  are  many  infrastructure  bottlenecks, \nand  the  provision  of  social  services  is  inadequate.  The  government  wants  to  change  this \nsituation. It has identified accelerating income growth and improving social services as its twin \ndevelopment  objectives.  Punjab\u2019s  Vision  2020  envisages  Punjab  as  a  reasonably  well-off, \neducated,  and  healthy  society  by  2020,  with  the  doubling  of  per  capita  income  to  $2,000. \nGuided  by  Vision  2020,  Punjab's  medium-term  development  framework  for  FY2008\u20132011 \nhighlights the need to develop a productive private sector and strengthen public institutions. The \ngovernment is adopting a province-wide results based framework to define development targets \nand monitor progress in key sectors, including education, health, irrigation and power, transport, \nwater supply and sanitation, livestock and dairy, and revenue.    \n \n45. \nThe province requires large investment to realize its vision and development results. The \nmajor public sector revenue sources include the province's own source revenue, fiscal transfers \nfrom  the  federal  government,  and  development  assistance  from  development  agencies. \nDevelopment assistance plays an important role in supplementing domestic savings. In addition \nto public investment, the province increasingly needs to benefit from greater private investment. \nIndeed, the lion's share of provincial investment is made by the private sector. The government \nneeds  to  enable  greater  private  sector  participation  not  only  in  economic  sectors,  but  also  in \nfinancing  and  provision  of  infrastructure  and  social  services.  Achieving  Punjab's  development \nresults  also  requires  the  province  to  use  its  scarce  resources  efficiently.  The  institutional \nfoundation  for  achieving  Punjab's  development  objectives  is  an  efficient,  accountable,  and \ncapable  public  sector19.  This  strategic  consideration  underpins  the  design  of  the  PGEIP.  The \nrecent  worsening  of  economic  conditions  has  accentuated  the  urgency  of  such  reforms.  The \noverview of Punjab's Vision, strategic objectives, key impact and outcome indicators, resource \nenvelop, and reforms are outlined in Figure 2. \n\n                                                 \n19  For a discussion on the need to reform the public sector, see Ishrat Husain. 2007.

Improve  public  financial  management  by  (a)  adopting  an  output-based \nmedium-term budgetary framework, and (b) widening the tax base and improving \ntax administration.  \nCPA2.  Strengthen  contingent  liability  management  by  improving  the  financing, \ninvestment, and management of pension and GP Fund expenses, as well as the \nrecord-keeping and administration for pension and GP Fund schemes.  \nCPA3. Improve civil service management by strengthening civil service function, \nbusiness processes, human resource management, and capacity.  \nCPA4.  Enable  private  sector  development  by  promoting  PPP  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment and social service delivery.  \nCPA5. Enhance development results by adopting an RBM framework. \n\n(v) \n \nCPA5,  adopting  RBM,  is  introduced  in  subprogram  2  to  promote  a  paradigm  change \n48. \nfrom activities to results-based public sector management. This CPA is closely linked with the \nother  four  CPAs:  while  RBM  clearly  maps  out  development  results,  effective  public  financial \nmanagement,  human  resource  management,  and  private  sector  development  are  key  building \nblocks  for  the  successful  implementation  of  RBM.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is \noutlined in Appendix 1. The development policy letter is in Appendix 4. The policy matrix is in \nAppendix 5, and the explanation on how the policy matrix has evolved is presented in Appendix \n6. An action plan for achieving subprogram 2 is in Supplementary Appendix C, while a program \nimplementation  memorandum  (PAM)  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  The  reform  actions \nunder each CPA are described below. \n \nB. \n\nSummary of Achievements under Subprogram 1 and Subprogram 2 \n\n49. \nThe three subprograms in the PGEIP program cluster support progressively deepening \ninstitutional  reforms  in  public  financial  management,  contingent  liability  management,  civil \nservice  reform,  and  private  sector  development.  Given  the  large  gender  disparity  in  Punjab \n(para.  7),  subprogram  2  has  focused  special  attention  on supporting gender  mainstreaming  in \nthe program framework (paras. 72\u201377 and Table 2). Table 1 summarizes the achievements of \nsubprograms 1 and 2. More details on subprogram 2 actions are discussed in paras. 50-77.  \n \n\nTable 1: Major Achievements under Subprogram 1 and Subprogram 2   \n\nObjectives  \n\nSubprogram 1 Key Activities \n(July 2006 to December 2007) \n\nSubprogram 2 Achievements \n(January 2008 to September 2009) \n\nCPA1: Fiscal and Financial Management \nImprove \ncoordination, \ntransparency, and \naccountability in the \nbudget process \n\n1.

A PPP cell was established \nin P&DD.   \n\nSubprogram 2 Achievements \n(January 2008 to September 2009) \nconsultations with the provincial assembly were conducted \nfor the 2010 budget for the first time in the province's history. \nThis will help to reduce ad hoc political bargaining and \nreinforce budget predictability. \n \n\nFund contingent liabilities. The Finance Department has \ntransferred PRs12 billion to prefund the PPF. The funding \nstrategy was updated based on a 2009 actuarial \nassessment. Reporting pension and GP Fund costs and \nliabilities on an accrual basis in line with international best \npractice has been introduced. \n \nEnhance governance of fund management. A trustee and \nan external auditor were appointed for the PPF. Investment \npolicy for PPF was adopted by the management committee. \n \nGeneral Provident Investment Fund Act. The provincial \nassembly passed the GPIF Act on 2 July 2009, providing an \nenabling legal framework for funding GP Fund liabilities. \n \nImprove record-keeping and administration. Over 90% of \npension records and almost 20% of GP Fund records have \nbeen compiled and verified. A pilot project has been initiated \nto test methods to speed the uploading of historic GP Fund \nrecords. \n \n\nDevelop a CSR road map. An overarching CSR policy to \ntransform the civil service and map out the sequence for \nreforms has been approved by the provincial cabinet.   \n \nBenchmark civil service performance. Benchmarking of \nservice delivery in key departments is being introduced to \nreinforce performance accountability. \n\nCreate model departments. The piloting of fully fledged \nfunctional review, business process reengineering, and \nhuman resource management reforms in E&TD and L&DD \nhas been launched, leading the way for broader reforms. \n \nModernize recruitment. PPSC business process improved. \nFurther business process reengineering and adoption of a \nrecruitment system using information technology are under \nway.   \n \nImprove capacity. MPDD increased the number of training \nhours and courses by 20% from FY2008 to 2009. A training \nstrategy has been developed to transform training initiatives \nfor skill development from supply driven to demand driven. \n \n\nDevelop PPP frameworks and projects. PPP institutions, \npolicy, and law have been developed. The provincial \ncabinet's approval of PDF guidelines, capitalization of PDF, \nand identification of potential projects will help to \nmainstream PPP. Subsequent work will include developing \ndetailed operational guidelines and projects, focusing on the \neducation, health, and infrastructure sectors. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nObjectives  \n\nSubprogram 1 Key Activities \n(July 2006 to December 2007) \n\nSubprogram 2 Achievements \n(January 2008 to September 2009) \n\nCPA 5: Enhance development results \nAdopt RBM \n\n \n\nStrengthen result focus. This new CPA has been \nintroduced to integrate reforms with a focus on development \nresults. A draft RBM framework has been prepared through \nconsultation map out result indicators in the education, \nhealth, and key infrastructure and economic sectors. The \ngradual adoption of RBM will transform civil service \nmanagement from a rigid micro-management style to a \nsystem that combines accountability for results and \nautonomy and flexibility in management. \n\nIntegrate gender actions in the program. Gender equity is \na crosscutting area that is supported by CPAs 1, 3, and 5. \nThe overall budget and planning processes have been \nreoriented toward increased attention to gender equity. \nGender equity\u2013enabling institutions such as the Directorate \nof Women\u2019s Development have been established. The RBM \nframework incorporates gender equity indicators, especially \nin health and education.    \n \n\nPromoting gender equity \nGender \nmainstreaming \n\n \n\nCPA = core policy area, CSR = civil service reform, DI&P = Department of Irrigation and Power, DOH = Department of \nHealth, E&TD = Exercise and Taxation Department, GPIF = General Provident Investment Fund, GP Fund = General \nProvident  Fund,  L&DD  =  Livestock  and  Dairy  Department,  MPDD  =  Management  and  Professional  Development \nDepartment, MTBF = Medium-Term Budgeting Framework, P&DD = Planning and Development Department, PPF = \nPunjab Pension Fund, PPSC = Punjab Public Service Commission, PPP = public\u2013private partnership, PDF = Project \nDevelopment Facility, PAT = Pension Administration Task Force, RBM = results-based management.  \n \nC. \n\nOutput and Activities of Subprogram 2 \n\n1. \n\nCPA1: Improve Public Financial Management \n\nThe  objective  of  this  CPA  is  to  improve  public  financial  management  to  promote  the \n\n50. \nefficient and accountable use of scarce public resources.  \n  \n\na. \n\nImprove Expenditure Management \n\n51. \nImplement  output-based  budgeting.  A  key  reform  in  the  PGEIP  is  the  use  of  the \nMTBF  to  improve  efficiency,  accountability,  and  predictability  in  public  financial  management. \nSubprogram  1  institutionalized  the  explicit  estimation  of  the  province's  overall  resource \nenvelope and strategic sector allocations by introducing the top\u2013down dimension of the MTBF. \nSubprogram 2 introduced bottom\u2013up output-based budgeting in two key departments, DOH and \nD&IP. The comprehensive MTBF strengthens budget preparation in three aspects: (i) explicitly \ncommunicating the amount of resources available to departments to enforce fiscal discipline; (ii) \nlinking  service  delivery  with  the  budget  allocation  through  unit  costing;  and  (iii) adopting \nmultiyear forward planning to improve budget credibility and predictability.  \n \n52. \nOutput-based  budgeting  represents  a  paradigm  shift  from  incremental  input-based \nbudgeting to results, so that it becomes possible to monitor and evaluate the cost-effectiveness \nof  public  spending.  In  DOH,  for  example,  there  has  been  significant  under-budgeting  of  non-\nsalary recurrent expenditure, such as medicine and O&M, through the years. This component is \nvital for service delivery. Under the MTBF, the current expenditure of DOH for FY2010 is about \n70%  higher  than  that  for  FY2009.  The  reduction  in  the  mismatch  between  expenditures  and \noutputs,  and  between  expenditure  components,  improves  efficiency  in  using  public  resources. \nMTBF  implementation  will  be  rolled  out  in  three  more  departments  in  subprogram  3.  The \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\ngovernment has tentatively identified them as E&TD, Livestock and Dairy Department (L&DD), \nand Department of Higher Education.    \n \n53. \nSpring  cleaning  of  ADP.  Budget  allocation  since  2009  has  been  tilted  toward \ncompleting ongoing schemes with the allocation of 70% of resources, with the remaining 30% \nallocated  for  new  schemes.  The  government  has  taken  measures  to  rationalize  the  FY2010 \nADP. The number of schemes with token allocations was reduced by about 25% compared with \nthe  previous  year, 20  and  block  allocations  was  reduced  in  both  number  and  size.  The \ngovernment approved 70% of unapproved schemes in the first quarter of FY2010, equivalent to \nthe  share  of  approved  schemes  for  the  whole  FY2009.  In  subprogram  3,  the  government  will \nincorporate rules in the planning manual to remove ongoing schemes whose present allocations \nare less than 10% of the financing needs and eliminate most new schemes where the allocation \nis less than 15% of the financing needs. The government has committed to reduce the number \nof  unapproved  schemes  by  at  least  90%  by  the  second  quarter  of  each  FY  starting  from \nFY2011.  This  will  help  to  mitigate  the  phenomenon  of  \u201ctoo  many  projects,  too  few  funds\u201d  and \nreduce time and cost overruns.  \n \n54. \nGreater accountability in budget execution. The prevalence of supplementary grants \nnegates  the  precision  and  discipline  gained  from  the  MTBF.  Subprogram  2  supports  the \ninstitutionalization of pre-budget consultations with the provincial assembly. This dialogue allows \nlegislators' concerns to be considered at an early stage of the budget process. This is expected \nto reduce demand for supplementary budgets and ad hoc development projects. As the costing \nof  outputs  within  the  resource  envelope  under  the  MTBF  improves,  the  government  has \ninstituted ceilings on net supplementary grants for the two pilot MTBF departments.21   \n \n\nb. \n\nImprove tax administration and structure \n\n55. \nTax administration reforms will be actively pursued in subprogram 3, with some activities \nbegun under subprogram 2. The property survey to support UIPT collection was initiated in July \n2009  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  December  2009.  Concurrently,  the  annual  rental \nvaluation tables will be updated to reflect more recent rental values by December 2009. On the \nMVT,  the  E&TD  expects  to  implement  online  collection  of  the  tax  through  commercial  banks \nduring  subprogram  3.  This  will  be  supported  by  completing  the  rollout  of  the  motor  vehicle \ndatabase  to  all  districts  in  Punjab.  E&TD  institutional  capacity\u2014staff,  functional  structure,  and \nbusiness processes for tax administration\u2014will be addressed in the civil service reform (CSR) \ncomponent,  as  E&TD  is  one  of  the  two  departments  that  will  undergo  business  process \nreengineering.   \n \n\n2. \n\nCPA2: Manage Contingent Liabilities \n\nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  manage  the  growing  burden  of  pension  and  GP \n\n56. \nFund expenditures and liabilities on provincial finances sustainably and efficiently.  \n \n\na. \n\nImprove Financing and Reporting  \n\n57. \nFunding. The government will not reach the funding target set in 2007 for subprogram 1 \nto accumulate PRs100 billion by FY2016 because of a number of developments. First, resource \n                                                 \n20  New schemes with allocations of less than 10% of project cost are considered token allocations.  \n21  Net supplementary grants refer to funding of proposed expenditures that are not funded by savings within the grant \ncontrolled by the administrative department. Such net supplementary grant requests are submitted to the Finance \nDepartment for its approval. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nGovernance  structure.  The  governance  structure  of \n\nshortfalls arose from worsening economic conditions and reduced development partner support. \nSecond,  there  have  been  changes  to  the  government's  priorities  with  increased  expenditure \noutlay to counter increased poverty and security risks. Third, poor economic conditions and high \ninflation mean few investment opportunities are generating positive returns.   \n \n58. \nThe  government  remains  committed  to  addressing  the  growing  pension  and  GP  Fund \nliabilities.  In  FY2009,  it  transferred  PRs6  billion  to  the  PPF.  For  FY  2010,  PRs6  billion  was \ntransferred in August 2009. The government prepared a revised funding strategy that takes into \naccount  current  fiscal  conditions  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).  From  FY2011  onward,  the \ngovernment  will  stop  borrowing  GP  Fund  contributions  deducted  from  the  employees'  salaries \nand transfer the amount to the General Provident Investment Fund (GPIF). At the same time, it \nwill  initiate  the  amortization  of  GP  Fund  liabilities.  The  government  will  continue  transferring \nfunds to the PPF and use the funds as a buffer for unexpected pension outlays or government \nrevenue  shortfalls.  Both  the  financing  and  investment  strategies  will  be  updated  regularly  to \nreflect changing needs, the maturity of the institutional mechanism, and fiscal conditions.     \n \nthe  PPF  adopted  under \n59. \nsubprogram  1  has  been  implemented  under  subprogram  2.  A  management  committee \ncomprised  of  six  ex-officio  members  and  four  private  sector  members  has  been  created  and \nmeets regularly. Four subcommittees, investment, human resource, governance, and accounts \nand  compliance,  have  been  formed.  In  August  2009,  a  general  manager  was  hired  from  the \nprivate sector; the trustee, legal advisor, and external auditor were appointed; and the signing \nauthority of the pension account was transferred to the PPF. An investment policy for PPF was \napproved by the  management committee in  October 2008. The GPIF Act was  adopted by  the \nprovincial  assembly  on  2  July  2009.  In  the  future,  both  the  PPF  and  GPIF  funds  will  be \nmanaged  by  the  same  management  committee  to  minimize  operational  costs  and  share \nprofessional expertise.  \n \nAccounting  for  pension  and  GP  Fund  costs.  The  government  reports  pension  and \n60. \nGP Fund costs based on annual benefit payments. To assess the solvency and sustainability of \nthe  pension  scheme,  it  is  necessary  to  look  at  long-term  costs  on  an  accrual  basis.  Under \nsubprogram  2,  the  government,  for  the  first  time,  reported  on  the  current  cost  and  accrued \nliabilities  of  the  pension  and  GP  Fund  based  on  an  actuarial  valuation  using  June  2008  data \ncontained  in  the  white  paper  for  FY2010.  The  government  will  report  on  the  current  cost  and \naccrued liabilities of the pension and GP Fund in line with International Public Sector Accounting \nStandard 25,22 as a supplement to the budget starting from the next fiscal year.    \n \n\nb. \n\nImprove Record-Keeping and Administration   \n\n61. \nUnder subprogram 1, the Finance Department created the Pension Administration Task \nForce  (PAT),  which  is  responsible  for  improving  the  administration  of  pension  and  GP  Fund \nexpenses. Under subprogram 2, a baseline has been introduced to monitor the progress of data \ngathering,  verification,  and  entry  for  payroll,  pension,  and  GP  Fund  records  into  the  SAP/R3 \ndatabase.  As  of  10  August  2009,  over  988,000  employees  were  paid  through  the  SAP/R3 \nhuman  resource  module,  and  782,000  GP  Fund  accounts  and  162,000  pension  records  were \nregistered.  Substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  collecting  pension  record  data.  Across  the \nprovince,  over  90%  of  pension  records  have  been  entered  into  excel  files.  About  half  of  the \n                                                 \n22  The  International  Accounting  Board  has  selected  a  particular  actuarial  method  as  the  standard  for  pension \naccounting to ensure that pension expenses reported by different entities are comparable. Projected unit cost  is an \naccrual accounting method in which the required assets correspond to the accrued liabilities and the annual cost \ncorresponds to the value of the benefits earned for that year of service. \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\n62. \nservice.    \n \n\ncomputerized  data  had  been  uploaded  into  the  SAP/R3  database.  Although  most  of  the \nemployees  have  a  GP  Fund  account,  these  accounts  are  far  from  complete.  About  20%  of \nhistoric GP Fund records have been converted from ledger books into the SAP/R3 database. A \npilot project has been initiated to test alternative methods that may speed the process.    \n \n\n3. \n\nCPA3: Forge Civil Service Reforms \n\nThe objective of this component is to foster an efficient, accountable, and capable civil \n\na. \n\nImprove Functions, Streamline Business Processes, and Modernize \nHuman Resource Management in the Civil Service \n\n63. \nAdopting  a  civil  service  reform  policy.  The  daunting  challenge  confronting  CSR  in \nPunjab necessitates an incremental approach toward introducing sustainable changes. To guide \nreforms  and  enable  departments  to  adopt  human  resource  management  practices  that  depart \nfrom the existing rules and regulations, the provincial cabinet approved a CSR policy in August \n2009 which sets out the government's intention and commitment to modernize the civil service \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E).  The  policy  articulates  key  parameters  for  reforms,  including  the \nrole  of  government,  open  and  merit-based  posting  and  recruitment,  modern  compensation \npackages, stable tenure, skills development, simplified business processes, and rewards linked \nwith service delivery indicators.      \n \n64. \nReforming  departments.  The  government  identified  two  key  departments,  E&TD  and \nL&DD, to undergo a full-fledged functional review, business process reengineering, and human \nresource management reform. While E&TD is a key provincial revenue office, L&DD supports a \nsector that generates about 40% of farmers' income. Functional review is especially important \nfor L&DD. In addition to providing extensive services, the department provides animal nutrition \nand vaccines and owns farms. Encouraging private sector participation in the livestock and dairy \nsector will reduce the administrative burden of the government and improve efficiency in using \nresources  such  as  land.  The  government  is  considering  leasing  out  most  of  the  farms  to  the \nprivate sector. As 80% of dairy sector work is managed by women, improved the functioning of \nthis department will help to empower women by increasing their income.   \n \n65. \nBusiness  process  reengineering  in  L&DD  and  E&TD  will  reduce  redundant  processes \nand  improve  operational  efficiency,  supported  by  the  use  of  information  technology.  Human \nresource management reforms strengthen incentives for better service delivery. These include \nintroducing open and merit-based recruitment and posting, linking compensation with skills and \nperformance, stabilizing tenure, monetarizing benefits, outsourcing nonessential functions, and \ntransforming the civil service from a large unskilled structure into skilled institutions.      \n \n66.  Modernizing  recruitment.  A  major  complaint  against  the  Punjab  Public  Service \nCommission  (PPSC)  is  its  slow  response  to  departments'  recruitment  requests.  Supported  by \nthe  subprogram  2,  the  PPSC  adopted  a  new  procedure  in  August  2009  to  move  away  from \ninterviewing  all  candidates  to  only  those  who  are  shortlisted.  This  will  significantly  reduce \nrecruitment  time.  The  effort  to  introduce  simplified  business  processes  and  a  recruitment \nmanagement system using information technology will continue into subprogram 3 and beyond.  \n \nBenchmarking Performance. Designing an evidence-based performance-management \n67. \nsystem  is  a  key  support  for  reforms.  This  program  supports  benchmarking  to  identify  and \nmeasure key performance indicators. Comprehensive benchmarking will be carried out initially \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\nin  E&TD,  L&DD,  and  PPSC,  focusing  on  strategic,  functional,  performance,  and  process \naspects. While PPSC benchmarking has been completed, work for E&TD and L&DD has started. \nOver  time,  benchmarking  performance  will  constitute  an  important  part  of  the  performance \nmanagement system throughout the province.   \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthen Civil Servant Capacity \n\n68. \nThe  number  of  training  days  conducted  by  MPDD  almost  doubled  from  2007  to  2008 \nand increased a further 20% from 2008 to 2009. The training subjects include provincial policies \nand  regulations;  technical  matters  such  as  financial  management,  project  management,  and \ncomputer  skills;  and  personal  skills  such  as  problem  solving,  decision  making,  and \ncommunications.  Gender-sensitization  workshops  have  been  held  and  are  supported  by \nsubprogram  2.  MPDD  training  infrastructure  has  improved  significantly.  Its  facilities  are  now \nrented by other organizations, creating additional income for the government. MPDD will adopt \na  management  information  system  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  training  by  2009.  A  training \nstrategy was developed during subprogram 2 to transform the training initiative in the province \nfrom  supply  based  to  demand  driven,  providing  increased  autonomy  and  incentives  to \ndepartments and staff.    \n \n\n4. \n\nCPA4: Enable Private Sector Development \n\n69. \nThe  objective  of  this  CPA  is  to  promote  PPP  for  higher  economic  growth  and  better \nservice delivery. Subprogram 2 supports the development of an enabling environment for PPP \nof infrastructure and social services, especially education and health services. A framework was \nprepared in April 2009 to outline a road map for developing PPP (Supplementary Appendix F). \nA  PPP  policy  was  approved  in  August  2009  by  the  provincial  cabinet  to  articulate  the \ngovernment's  intention  to  adopt  PPP  for  infrastructure  and  social  service  delivery.  A  PPP  law \nwas prepared and discussed with stakeholders, and submitted in August 2009 to the provincial \nassembly.  A  series  of  training  workshops  have  been  held  for  key  line  departments.  During \nsubprogram  3,  the  PPP  Cell  established  in  subprogram  1  will  be  complemented  by  the \nestablishment of a senior policy board chaired by the chief secretary. The experience of federal \ngovernment PPP reforms demonstrates that PPP development should include opportunities to \nlearn by doing through actual project development, which will help sustain government interest \nand  commitment  toward  PPP.  While  the  government  continues  to  develop  PPP  regulatory \nframeworks, it has also made efforts to support PPP project development. Project development \nfacility  (PDF)  guidelines  was  approved  by  the  provincial  cabinet  in  August  2009,  and  the \ngovernment has allocated $1 million funds in the FY2010 budget for the facility and identified a \nlist of potential PPP projects.23   \n \n\n5. \n\nCPA5: Adopt Results-Based Management  \n\n70. \nThis  is  a  new  CPA  which  helps  the  government  to  adopt  modern  public  sector \nmanagement  techniques  to  achieve  its  vision.  Punjab  has  developed  a  draft  result  framework \nthrough a consultative process to shift its development agenda from inputs and activities toward \ngreater  accountability  for  results.  The  key  sectors  included  in  the  framework  are  education, \nhealth,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  irrigation  and  power,  transport,  livestock  and  dairy,  and \nexcise  and  taxation.  Punjab's  RBM  framework  pays  particular  attention  to  achieving  positive \ngender results, especially in health and education, to contribute to achieving the MDGs.  \n\n                                                 \n23 Any  PPP  project  developed  with  support  from  the  PGEIP  will  be  designed  taking  into  consideration  applicable \n\ngovernment and ADB environmental and safeguard requirements. \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\n \n71. \nPunjab's  RBM  framework  focuses  on  results  (outputs,  outcomes,  and  impact)  and \nemphasizes the need to efficiently use resources. Adopting sound public financial management, \nhuman  resource  management,  efficient  business  processes,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystems form an essential part of RBM. There is also a great need to streamline the role of the \ngovernment and enable the private sector to deliver results. The focus to deliver development \nresults  underpins  the  five  CPAs  in  the  PGEIP.  The  linkages  between  Punjab's  development \nresults  and  the  ADB's  strategic  focus  provide  a  platform  for  the  ADB  to  assist  Punjab's \ndevelopment through both providing financing and supporting reforms. The overview of Punjab's \nRBM framework is set out in Figure 2, and the details of Punjab's RBM framework are outlined \nin Supplementary Appendix G.    \n \n\n6. \n\nGender Focus of the Program \n\n72. \nSubprogram 2 of the PGEIP mainstreams gender reforms and supports gender equity in \nPunjab 24 ,  building  upon  past  ADB  support  to  Pakistan  under  the  Decentralization  Support \nProgram. The subprogram 2 action plan (see Supplementary Appendix C and Table 2) includes \na  number  of  gender-specific  actions.  Over  2004\u20132007,  the  Decentralization  Support  Program \nsupported  the  Government  of  Pakistan  in  developing  the  national  Gender  Reform  Action  Plan \n(GRAP), which was later approved by the National Assembly, and provincial GRAPs that were \napproved by provincial assemblies or cabinets. Promoting gender equity is an important part of \nsubprogram 2, especially in CPA1 (improving public financial management), CPA3 (civil service \nreforms), and CPA5 (adopting RBM).  \n \nThe government has begun to orient budget and planning processes toward increased \n73. \nattention  to  promoting  gender  equity.  Two  pre-budget  seminars  were  conducted  to  increase \nawareness  on  gender  sensitive  budgeting  in  FY2010.  While  still  small,  resource  allocation  for \nGRAP  implementation  has  more  than  doubled  during  subprogram  2,  from  PRs70  million  in \nFY2008 to PRs148 million in FY2010.   \n \n74. \nGender  mainstreaming  units  have  been  established  in  seven  key  departments: \neducation,  health,  finance,  planning  and  development,  home,  law,  and  services  and  general \nadministration. Gender support units have been established in 27 districts. The gender support \nunits  conducted  a  review  of  179  project  documents.  Based  upon  the  review,  these  project \ndocuments were revised to reflect better gender balance. MTBF helped to significantly increase \nbudget for the health sector in FY2010. The ADP for health and education includes a clear focus \non  bridging  the  gap  in  services  and  infrastructure  available  to  male  and  females.  The \ngovernment  prepared  gendered  budget  statements  for  the  districts  of  Rajanpur  and  Gujrat  to \ngauge whether public investment is gender responsive. The findings were incorporated into the \ngender aspects section of the budget call circular for FY2010. Subprogram 3 will further deepen \nand  institutionalize  gender-sensitive  public  financial  management  by  introducing  gender-\nresponsive budgeting in the health and education departments.    \n \n75. \nThe livestock and dairy sector contributes 11% of provincial GDP and employs 30 million \npeople, largely in rural areas. Women play an important role in animal husbandry. Over 90% of \nfresh  milk  consumed  in  Pakistan  is  derived  from  small  domestic  production,  which  is  mainly \nmanaged by women. The government realizes the importance of this sector. Budget allocation \nfor livestock and dairy more than doubled to PRs1,640 million in FY2010 from PRs806 million in \n\n                                                 \n24 Subprogram  2  of  PGEIP  has  been  categorized  as  an  effective  gender  mainstreaming  program  by  the  Regional \n\nSustainable Development Department and the program team.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\ninterventions, \n\nthe  government  has  established \n\nFY2009. The initiatives will improve productivity in this sector and augment the earning power of \nwomen. Lack of economic empowerment is a major problem facing women in Punjab.  \n \n76. \nCPA3  supports  the  establishment  of  institutions  that  enable  gender  equity.  The  GRAP \nproject  will  conclude  in  June  2010.  Anticipating  this  and  the  continuous  need  for  gender-\nsensitive \nthe  Directorate  of  Women\u2019s \nDevelopment  to  be  responsible  for  sustainably  carrying  out  GRAP  activities.  The  PGEIP \nsupports the conduct of a series of sensitization workshops on gender equity to raise awareness \nof gender issues and to mainstream gender equity in the reform agenda. Benchmarking and in-\ndepth  functional  review,  business  process  reengineering,  and  human  resource  management \nreforms in L&DD  will improve the performance of the dairy  sector and boost woman's earning \npower. Gender equity will be a regular training topic in the MPDD curriculum in subprogram 3.  \n \n77. \nBridging  the  gender  gap  is  a  core  element  of  Punjab's  RBM  framework,  especially  in \nhealth  and  education.  The  RBM  framework  working  group  will  report  both  progress  and \nshortfalls in achieving the indicators to the provincial cabinet and assembly. The  realization of \nconcrete outcome indicators in key sectors, such as eliminating the gender disparity in primary \nschool  enrollment,  will  go  a  long  way  toward  improving  the  welfare  of  women  and  other \nvulnerable  groups \nthe  assessment  of  GRAP \nimplementation  regarding  public  financial  management,  civil  service  reforms,  service  delivery, \nthe  deepening  of  gender  mainstreaming \nand  economic  empowerment  aspects;  and \ninterventions.

The  PGEIP  is  introducing  RBM  in  Punjab, \nwhich  is  characterized  by  focus  and  accountability  for  results.  RBM  serves  as  an  overarching \nframework linking development results with effective and efficient systems and procedures. The \nfirst  four  CPAs  of  the  PGEIP  aim  to  equip  the  government  with  efficient,  accountable,  and \nenabling  financial,  human  resource,  information,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  for \ndelivering results, while the new fifth CPA integrates long-term goals, medium-term outcomes, \nand short-term actions.  \n \n79. \nDeepening the long-term reform agenda and sharpening the focus on results. The \nPGEIP has evolved to include a few strategic reform areas focusing on delivering results. This \ndeparts from past programs that were overburdened by scattered and numerous actions.  \n \n80. \nSustained  government  ownership.  Vision 2020 and the MTBF articulate the need for \nan efficient, effective, and responsive government, as well as a dynamic and productive private \nsector.  Extensive  dialogue  with  the  government  and  consultations  with  stakeholders  have \nensured  that  all  four  CPAs  of  the  PGEIP  are  in  close  alignment  with  the  government\u2019s  policy \ndirections.  Ongoing  consultation  with  stakeholders  will  help  ensure  sustained  support  for \nreforms  despite  political  and  leadership  changes.  The  current  government,  which  came  to \npower in February 2008, has strongly embraced program reforms.     \n \n81. \nIntegrated program design. The PGEIP is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2020 and the \nCountry  Partnership  Strategy  for  Pakistan,  and  it  complements  operations  by  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partners.  Its  CPAs  are  integrated.  For  example,  public  financial  management \nreforms  link  resource  allocation  with  performance,  while  business  process  reengineering  in \nE&TD under CSR complement tax administration reforms.  \n \n82. \nIntroducing the program administration memorandum. A PAM has been developed \nby ADB and the government to monitor program progress and facilitate reform implementation. \nThe  PAM  is  an  evolving  tool  that  maps  out  the  actions  to  be  taken  and  the  responsibilities  of \nagencies  and  individuals,  and  monitors  progress.  The  PAM  will  be  a  useful  instrument  to \nsupport the PGEIP and TA implementation and communications among and within the ADB and \ngovernment teams.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n83. \nGender  mainstreaming.  Effective  gender  mainstreaming  is  an  important  part  of  the \nPGEIP, especially in the areas of public financial management, civil service reform, and RBM. \nGender  mainstreaming  will  be  regularly  evaluated  and  deepened  as  program  implementation \nproceeds.  \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nLoan size, terms, and conditions. Two loans with an aggregate amount of $150 million \n84. \nequivalent will be provided to finance subprogram 2 of the PGEIP. The first loan of $75 million \nwill be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined according \nto ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a 15-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  3  years;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum;  and  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government of Pakistan has provided ADB \nwith  (i) the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  under \nthese terms and conditions and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The second loan \nof $75 million equivalent will be financed from ADB Special Funds resources with a term of 24 \nyears including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter; and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe borrower will be Pakistan.   \n \n85. \nFinancing of subprograms 2 and 3 were provisionally estimated in subprogram 1 at $250 \nmillion each. Subprogram 2 has been scaled back in light of the exceptional financing needs at \nthe national level. The government has requested that $250 million be provided for subprogram \n3  as  originally  envisaged.  The  loan  size  and  composition  of  subprogram  3  will  be  confirmed \nduring  processing  on  the  bases  of  progress,  financing  requirements,  and  the  availability  of \nresources.  \n\n \nTable 3: Adjustment Cost of Reformsa \n(PRs billion, unless otherwise specified) \n\n Policy areas \nCore Policy Area 1: Public Financial Management \nResults-oriented  budgeting  in  key  social  sector  and  infrastructure \ndepartments \nCosts related to tax reforms \nCore Policy Area 2: Contingent liability Management  \nCapitalization of PPF  \nCapitalization of GPIF \nCore Policy Area 3: Civil Service Management \nBusiness process reengineering \nReduction in wage compression  \nOutsource of nonessential functions \nRight sizing \nCore Policy Area 4: Private Sector Participation \nPPP transactions services \nViability gap funding \nPPP project costs \nTotal  \nIn $ millionb \n\n  \n\n6.0 \n  \n\n0.1 \n  \n  \n  \n\n0.1 \n  \n4.0 \n22.2 \n308.3 \n\nFY2010 \n\nFY2011 \n\nFY2012 \n\n12.0 \n\n14.0 \n\n27.0 \n\n0.7 \n\n2.0 \n7.0 \n\n0.2 \n4.0 \n0.1 \n  \n\n0.3 \n \n10.0 \n38.3 \n531.9 \n\n0.7 \n\n2.0 \n7.0 \n\n0.4 \n8.0 \n0.2 \n0.2 \n\n0.6 \n1.0 \n16.0 \n63.1 \n876.4 \n\n   FY = fiscal year, GPIF = General Provident Investment Fund, MTBF = medium-term budgetary framework, PPF =    \n   Punjab Pension Fund. \na.

The \nfinancial,  economic,  and  political  costs  associated  with  the  reforms  are  substantial.  Direct \nadjustment  costs  include  (i)  costs  for  results-oriented  budgeting  in  key  social  sector  and \ninfrastructure  departments,  specifically  relating  to  bridging  the  gaps  caused  by  chronic \nunderfunding  of  nonrecurrent  expenditure  in  the  incremental  and  input-based  budget  system; \n(ii) the capitalization of PPF and GPIF; (iii) increased wage costs as civil service reforms bring \ncompensation  more  in  line  with  the  market  rate;  (iv)  support  of  PPP  projects  in  infrastructure \nand social services, and (v) costs to support consensus building (Table 3). \n \n87. \nEarlier discussion on the use of the program proceeds focused on pension and GP Fund \ncapitalization. The government modified this focus for the following reasons: (i) slow growth and \nhigh  inflation  in  Pakistan  has  made  it  difficult  to  find  investment  opportunities  that  generate \npositive  returns;  (ii)  the  reduction  in  government  revenue  and  delayed  disbursement  and \nreduction  in  funds  available  from  ADB  programs  have  made  unfeasible  pursuing  the  initial \npension  and  GP  Fund  path;  (iii)  based  on  the  updated  actuarial  assessment  and  changed \nmacroeconomic  situation, \nfor  slower \naccumulation in the next 5 years; (iv) the need to weigh pensions and GP Fund against other \nadjustment  costs  and  financing  needs  suggests  a  more  balanced  approach  in  using  program \nproceeds. Subprogram 2 proceeds will thus be used to partly cover all areas of reform costs. \n \nThe  adjustment  costs  of  PGEIP  reforms  are  substantial.  Program  proceeds  will  only \n88. \npartly  cover  the  adjustment  costs.  The  government  needs  to  generate  resources  through \nimproved efficiency. In public financial management, for example, rationalization of development \nplans  and  recurrent  expenditure  is  needed  to  create  fiscal  space.  In  some  cases,  expenditure \nwill need to be reduced based on the government's strategic priorities and resource constraints. \nIn  pension  and  GP  Fund  management,  the  funding  pace  has  slowed,  partly  reflecting  the \ngovernment's  resource  constraints.  In  civil  service  reforms,  while  the  wage  compression  of \nskilled  employees  needs  to  be  addressed,  the  number  of  unskilled  employees  needs  to  be \nreduced to create fiscal space and make better use of the province's human resources. Fringe \nbenefits  need  to  monetarized  and  rationalized  to  create  a  more  liquid,  more  transparent,  and \nless  wasteful  compensation  system.  In  private  sector  development,  while  developing  PPP \nprojects  requires  initial  public  funding,  it  will  bring  more  resources  and  better  utilization  of \nresources  over  time.  The  reforms  under  PGEIP  subprogram  2  entail  short-term  costs,  but \nPunjab will draw larger benefits over the long run. \n \n89. \nRelending.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  will  relend  the  local  currency  generated  from \nthe proceeds of the loans to the Government of Punjab under the same terms and conditions as \nthose  extended  by  ADB  to  Pakistan.  The  Government  of  Punjab  will  assume  the  foreign \nexchange and interest rate risks. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nfinancing  strategy  provides \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \nP&DD is the EA. The steering committee established under subprogram 1 continues to \n90. \nguide  PGEIP  implementation.  The  executive  committee  chaired  by  the  P&DD  chairman \nsupports the steering committee and ensures efficient implementation. The executive committee \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\nmeets  at  least  twice  a  year  and  oversees  program  implementation.  To  increase  program \nownership  among  the  IAs,  the  executive  committee  includes  the  IAs  working  on  the  specific \nreform area concerned. Membership thus changes according to the specific area covered. ADB \nmay be invited to participate in executive committee meetings as an observer. Each CPA has \ndedicated focal departments. The Finance Department is responsible for implementing CPAs 1 \nand 2, the Service and General Administration Department is coordinating CPA3, and P&DD is \nin charge of CPAs 4 and 5. A RBM working group has been established to develop and monitor \nthe  implementation  the  results  and  report  its  findings  to  the  provincial  cabinet  and  assembly. \nThe PMU established under the PRMP in 2003 is the secretariat of the steering and executive \ncommittees. A PAM using Microsoft Project has been prepared to assist and monitor progress \n(Supplementary Appendix D). PGEIP subprogram 2 implementation has been supported by the \nTA loan and TA grant for the PGEIP program cluster. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n91. \nThe  implementation  period  of  PGEIP  is  from  July  2006  to  around  March  2011. \nSubprogram  2  covers  reform  measures  implemented  from  January  2008  to  September  2009. \nThe proposal on the subprogram 3 loan will be submitted for Board consideration about 18\u201320 \nmonths  after  loan  effectiveness  for  the  subprogram  2  loans,  subject  to  the  governments' \ncontinued commitment to the reform agenda and adequate reform progress. \n \n92. \nTo  guide  reform  actions,  an  action  plan  for  subprogram  3  was  developed  during \nsubprogram 2 implementation. While the government is committed to implementing key reform \nprinciples, the action plan will be a working document and actions therein will be adjusted where \nneeded to address unforeseen situations, in close coordination with ADB.  \n \n\n3. \n\nTranches and Counterpart Financing \n\nThe  proceeds  from  the  two  loans  will  be  available  for  withdrawal  in  a  single  tranche \n\n \n93. \nsubject to satisfaction of all subprogram 2 policy actions and following loan effectiveness. \n \n94. \nThe government will ensure that the local currency generated from the proceeds of the \nloans  will  be  used,  first,  to  support  the  adjustment  costs  of  reforms  to  be  initiated  and \nimplemented  under  subprogram  2  and,  second,  to  finance  expenditures  for  the  government\u2019s \ngeneral development purposes.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements \n\n \n95. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \nlocal  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports25 financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  the  Borrower,  in \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans. 26  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired  if,  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of \nPakistan\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \n\n                                                 \n25 Eligible  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  imports  specified  on  the  list  of  ineligible  items,  and \n\nimports financed by ADB or other international and bilateral development agencies. \n\n26 ADB. 1998.

Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations  and  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n97.  Much  progress  has  been  made  on  accountability  and  auditing,  with  support  from  the \nPIFRA. The PGEIP will complement the government's anticorruption efforts. For instance, CPA1 \naims for an efficient and accountable public financial management regime.27 The introduction of \naccrued  accounting  and  the  automation  of  pension  and  GP  Fund  records  under  CPA2  will \nincrease  transparency  and  minimize  the  scope  for  error  and  fraud  in  the  accounting  and \ndisbursement  of  pension  benefits.  Human \nreforms  and  business  process \nreengineering  under  CPA3  will  enhance  transparency  and  reduce  opportunities  for  corruption. \nThe promotion of PPP under CPA4 will improve discipline in service delivery.   \n \n\nresource \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\n \nThe government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators to \n98. \nmonitor PGEIP implementation and evaluate its impact within the program framework (Appendix \n1). The government and ADB  will periodically review progress on PGEIP implementation. The \ngovernment will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral \nand bilateral agencies that have implications for PGEIP implementation and provide ADB with \nthe opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. A review will be conducted by the \nexecutive committee every quarter, and a progress report will be shared with ADB, with the first \nprogress report due on 31 December 2009. A summary of the progress report will be published \non  the  PRMP  website  (http://www.punjab-prmp.gov.pk/).  To  assist  monitoring  and  evaluation \nand guide implementation, a detailed action plan has been prepared for subprogram 3. PGEIP-\nrelated  information  is  widely  disseminated  to  the  public  through  a  dedicated  website.  Regular \nworkshops and meetings involving civil society will be organized by the PMU to seek ideas from \nthe public and disseminate information. ADB  will regularly carry out review missions to review \nprogress and, based on the result, prepare subprogram 3.    \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n27  CPA  1  (improve  public  financial  management)  is  an  important  initiative  for  addressing  and  mitigating  risks \nidentified  in  the  country-level  risk  assessment  in  the  area  of  public  financial  management  in  the  Country \nPartnership Strategy, which was approved in March 2009. This is a good example of following through with action \nto address country-level risks identified during Country Partnership Strategy formulation through program reforms. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27\n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProgram Benefits \n\nfor  better  service  delivery.  Efficient \n\nThe  PGEIP  reinforces  is  expected  to  yield  a  number  of  benefits  for  the  residents  of \n\n99. \nPunjab, which are summarized below.   \n \n100.  More efficient use of public financial resources. The shift from input- to output-based \nbudgets  will  strengthen  efficiency  and  accountability  in  the  use  of  public  resources.  It  will \neliminate the mismatch between expenditure components, especially the squeeze on non-salary \nrecurrent  expenditure,  thereby  reducing  waste  and  improving  service  delivery.  By  integrating \nplanning  and  budgeting  processes,  the  PGEIP  will  ensure  greater  cohesion  between \ndevelopment  priorities  and  fiscal  resources.  The  integration  of  annual  budgeting  under  the \nMTBF will make budgeting more predictable and disciplined. The increase of the GRAP budget \nwill contribute to gender mainstreaming. All these actions will improve the use of scarce public \nresources and the provision of public services, especially to women and other vulnerable groups.       \n \n101.  Greater  financial  sustainability  for  the  pension  system.  The  partial  prefunding  of \npension  and  GP  Fund  costs  will  free  up  finances  and  reduce  contingent  liabilities.  The \nestablishment of the PPF and GPIF will promote savings, which will contribute to financial sector \ndevelopment and economic growth. The improvement of pension and GP Fund record-keeping \nwill reduce leakage and improve service delivery.    \n \n102.  An  efficient,  accountable,  and  capable  civil  service.  Improved  human  resource \nmanagement in the civil service will infuse merit and performance orientation and motivate civil \nservants \ninstitutional  structures,  simpler  business \nprocedures,  better  human  resource  management,  and  improved  capacity  in  the  public  sector \nwill improve the functioning of government. These efforts will help to transform the Punjab civil \nservice from a rigid, hierarchical bureaucracy into a citizen-responsive organization capable of \nleveraging scarce resources and providing an environment that is conducive to private sector\u2013\nled growth. These reforms are fundamental to improved service delivery, especially to women \nand other vulnerable groups, and creating a better investment climate.  \n \n103.  A  dynamic  private  sector.  The  establishment  of  policy,  institutional,  and  financial \nmechanisms  for  PPP  will  enable  Punjab  to  benefit  from  the  resources  of  both  the  private  and \nthe public sector for improved infrastructure and social service delivery, higher investment and \ngrowth, and more jobs.  \n \n104.  Results-based  management.  The  adoption  of  RBM  will  transform  public  sector \nmanagement  from  rigid  micro  control  to  greater  focus  on  results.  This  combination  of \naccountability for results and flexibility in management is the hallmark of modern public sector \nmanagement and will usher in a paradigm change in government functions in Punjab. The result \nframeworks  of  the  social  sectors  will  contribute  to  improving  the  welfare  of  women  and  other \nvulnerable groups through increased focus on development results and better service delivery.  \n \n105.  Gender  benefits.  Punjab's result framework explicitly spells out government targets for \ngender equity, particularly in health and education. One of the PGEIP's key target departments \nis  livestock  and  dairy,  in  which  women  carry  out  80%  of  activities.  The  government  increased \nthe livestock and dairy budget to PRs1,640 million in FY2010 from PRs806 million in FY2009. \nImproved function, business processes, and human resource management in L&DD will help to \nimprove  productivity  in  the  sector  and  economically  empower  women.  Building  on  Punjab's \n\n \n\n\f 28 \n\nGRAP, the PGEIP helped to identify large funding gaps and increased budget allocation in the \nhealth  sector,  with  positive  benefits  to  woman  and  children  through  better  access  to  medicine \nand improved medical facilities. Supported by the PGEIP, budgeting and planning processes in \nPunjab are paying increased attention to gender equity in allocations. Institutions tasked to work \non gender equity, such as the Directorate of Women\u2019s Development, have been set up to carry \nout  GRAP  activities.  The  PGEIP  is  conducting  a  series  of  sensitization  workshops  on  gender \nequity  in  Punjab.  All  these  efforts  will  contribute  to  women's  welfare  and  empowerment.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy of the PGEIP is in Appendix 8. \n  \n106.  The  institutional  reforms  embodied  in  the  PGEIP  will  improve  government  function \nacross the board and are essential for good governance, economic growth, and improved public \nservice delivery. The realization of these benefits requires commitment and determination from \nthe government. The PGEIP's support and leverage are critical to keeping the reforms on track. \n \nB. \n\nProgram Impact \n\n107.  Fiscal space. The PGEIP will contribute to creating fiscal space by (i) reducing wastage \nin public expenditure through the MTBF, (ii) prefunding of pension and GP Fund costs to contain \nexpenditure outlay, (iii) reducing pension and GP Fund leakage through better record-keeping, \n(v) developing an efficient civil service, and (vi) leveraging investment through PPP. \n \n108. \nInstitutional development. Increased coordination between planning and budgeting will \npromote a more coherent approach to public expenditure management, with significant gains in \noutput-oriented financial management. An improved ADP will enhance the effectiveness of the \ngovernment's  development  efforts.  Establishing  a  professionally  managed  PPF  and  GPIF  is  a \nmilestone  for  managing  the  funds  in  line  with  international  best  practice.  Civil  service  reforms \nwill bring across-the-board institutional improvement in the public sector. The establishment of \nthe PPP Cell will strengthen the interface between the public and private sectors. The adoption \nof RBM will modernize public sector management in Punjab.  \n  \n109.  Service  delivery  and  social  impact.  More  efficient  public  resource  management  and \nimproved civil service management will improve the quality of service delivery, especially in the \neducation and health sectors. Improved management of contingent liabilities will strengthen the \nsocial  safety  net.  The  creation  of  fiscal  space  will  allow  more  social  spending,  especially  on \nvulnerable groups, including women.   \n \n\n110.  Economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction. Improved public financial management will \nimprove  value  for  money  in  public  spending  and  generate  resources  for  investment.  The \nestablishment  of  the  PPF  and  GPIF  will  contribute  to  investment  and  economic  growth.  The \nefficiency gains achieved through civil service reforms and private sector development will spur \nsustainable economic growth. Promoting PPPs will enable more resources for investment and \nthe provision of more and better infrastructure and social services. The PGEIP will contribute to \npoverty  reduction  by \nincome-generating \nopportunities,  more  and  better  social  and  development  spending,  and  a  more  effective  public \nsector that is geared towards service delivery outcomes. \n\nthe  expansion  of \n\ninvestment  and \n\nincreasing \n\n \n\n111.  Resettlement,  indigenous  people,  and  the  environment.  The  PGEIP  will  cause  no \ndirect  or  indirect  involuntary  resettlement  or  raise  any  issues  affecting  indigenous  peoples \n(category C). It is also unlikely to have any adverse environmental impact (category C). \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n29\n\nC. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n112.  Program  design  and  implementation  need  to  manage  and  mitigate  a  variety  of  risks. \nThese are summarized below.    \n \n113.  Security  risks.  The  number  of  violent  assaults  has  increased  in  recent  months  in \nPakistan,  with  the  frequency  of  such  incidents  increasing  in  Punjab.  The  Government  of \nPakistan  is  implementing  measures  to  contain  security  risks.  Sustained  economic  growth  and \nstability are necessary for achieving peace and prosperity in the country.   \n \n114.  Political  risks.  Recent  developments  indicate  a  more  cooperative  approach  between \nmajor  political  parties.  The  risk  of  reversing  the  direction  of  program  reforms  is  low  given  the \nbroad consensus on reforms.   \n \n115.  Macroeconomic  risks.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  has  launched  a  stabilization \nprogram  to  improve  the  macroeconomic  situation  and  restore  investor  confidence.  ADB  is  a \nmajor  partner  through  its  support  under  the  Accelerating  Economic  Transformation  Program, \nwhich  provides  measures  to  deal  with  short-term  shocks  and  address  long-term  structural \nissues.  Signs  of  economic  recovery  have  emerged  recently.  Program  measures  to  tackle \ninstitutional  and  policy  impediments  to  growth  in  Punjab  will  help  to  reduce  economic \nvulnerability in the medium term. \n \n116.  Weak capacity. Program implementation may be delayed by weak capacity in a number \nof departments. With the help of a TA loan and grant, the PMU and departments involved are \naddressing  capacity  limitations.  Enhancing  IA  ownership  of  the  PGEIP  has  helped  to  mitigate \nimplementation risks.  \n \n117. \nIntergovernmental coordination. The civil service reform component requires effective \nintergovernmental  coordination.  The  upfront  work  on  civil  service  reforms  has  been \ndisseminated  widely,  including  to  those  who  may  be  affected.  Change  management  forms  an \nimportant part of program implementation to lessen resistance and increase support for reforms. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  has  given  the \n\n118. \nfollowing assurances, which are to be incorporated into the loan agreements:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  under  subprogram  2,  as  set  forth  in  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix, will be in effect for and beyond \nthe duration of subprogram 2; and \nthe \nthe  recommendation \nbased  on \nGovernment of Punjab will provide the Finance Department with at least five (5) \nqualified  technical  staff  designated  for  the  implementation  of  the  MTBF  in  the \nBudget Wing of the Finance Department by 31 November 2009. \n\nthe  MTBF  assessment  report, \n\nfrom \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n119. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 30 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $75,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  second \nsubprogram  of  the  Punjab  Government  Efficiency  Improvement  Program  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term \nof 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper  annum;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program  Agreements \npresented to the Board; and \nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 48,298,000 to \nthe  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  second  subprogram  of  the  Punjab \nGovernment  Efficiency  Improvement  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program  Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 August 2009 \n \n\n\f      \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nHigh, sustained, \nand private sector\u2013\ndriven growth and \nimproved service \ndelivery in the \nprovince of Punjab \n(by 2020) \n\nOutcome \nAn efficient, \naccountable, and \nenabling \ngovernment \n(by 2012) \n \n\nKey Outputs for \nSubprogram 2 \n \n1.

However, \nthis exercise was not subsequently updated annually. In fiscal year (FY) 2006, the Planning and \nDevelopment  Department  (P&DD)  published  its  first  medium-term  development  framework \n(MTDF), providing sector overviews, strategies, and principal targets. Although this exercise has \nbeen  replicated  every  year,  these  reforms  are  piecemeal  and  lack  an  integrated  and \nprogrammatic  approach.  Further,  budget  reforms  in  Punjab  are  complicated  by  the  dual \nbudgeting system in Pakistan. Current and development budgets are prepared separately from \nthe  beginning  and  get  to  be  presented  together  only  at  a  very  late  stage,  i.e.,  prior  to \npresentation  to  the  provincial  assembly.  The  Punjab  Government  Efficiency  Improvement \nProgram (PGEIP) sought to re-engage Punjab in budgeting reforms. Under subprogram 1, the \nGovernment  of  Punjab  (the  government)  (i) adopted  the  MTBF  for  FY2008  to  FY2010,  (ii) \napproved  joint  protocols  to  enable  the  Finance  Department  and  P&DD  to  jointly  review  the \ncurrent  and  development  budgets,  and  (iii) established  units  in  the  two  pilot  departments,  the \nDepartment  of  Health  (DOH)  and  the  Department  of  Irrigation  &  Power  (DI&P),  that  allow  the \npreparation of consolidated departmental budgets. \n \n3. \nLarge  variations  in  expenditure  outturns.  While  the  government  has  adopted  a \nmultiyear  budget  framework,  expenditure  outturns  increasingly  deviate  from  budget  estimates \n(Table  A3.1).  In  terms  of  total  expenditure,  the  deviations  of  actual  expenditures  from  original \nbudget estimates have increased in recent years. Between FY2005 and FY2007, the deviations \nfor aggregate expenditures were kept within \u00b15%. But this increased to \u201314.2% in FY2008 and \n9.3%  in  FY2009.  For  FY2008,  this is  largely  attributable  to the  huge  deviation  in  development \nexpenditures (\u201325.2%). For FY2009, both current and development expenditures deviated from \nbudget estimates by 8%\u201310%.1 The composition of expenditures also deviated significantly from \nthe  original  budget  estimates.  Budget  deviations  in  FY2008  and  FY2009  were  double  digit  for \nmost  sectors.  These  deviations  and  reallocations  weaken  the  budget's  usefulness  as  a \nstatement of policy intent. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Although  utilization  of  the  annual  development  program  is  below  budget  estimates,  additional  development \nexpenditures  were  recorded  in  the  revised  estimates  for  FY2009  due  to  expenditures  directly  funded  by  federal \ngovernment  grants  and  releases  from  project  accounts  lodged  in  the  public  accounts.  The  revised  estimate  for \ndevelopment expenditures may also be overestimated due to gaps in recording the surrender and re-appropriation \nof excess funds. \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 2     \n\n35\n\n \n\nTable A2.1: Aggregate Expenditure Outturns \n(PRs '000) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nActual \n\nBudget \n\nDeviation (%) \n\n(7.3) \n(7.7) \n(0.5) \n7.6 \n(7.2) \n9.9 \n\n(9.7) \n0.0 \n1.2 \n(1.7) \n(25.7) \n8.3 \n\n(7.8) \n(4.4) \n0.7 \n4.1 \n(14.2) \n9.3 \n\n31,357.00 \n44,456.21 \n65,535.44 \n117,124.52 \n150,000.00 \n160,000.00 \n\n28,323.72 \n44,442.87 \n66,324.05 \n115,162.58 \n117,453.84 \n173,254.50 \n\n119,934.76 \n133,986.74 \n158,523.86 \n205,837.69 \n226,010.73 \n282,281.01 \n\n148,258.48 \n178,429.61 \n224,847.91 \n321,000.26 \n337,464.58 \n455,535.52 \n\n129,445.49 \n142,134.43 \n157,778.03 \n191,378.17 \n243,487.29 \n256,948.66 \n\n160,802.49 \n186,590.64 \n223,313.47 \n308,502.69 \n393,487.29 \n416,948.66 \n\nFiscal Year  \nTotal Expenditures \nFY2004 \nFY2005 \nFY2006 \nFY2007 \nFY2008 \nFY2009a \nCurrent Expenditures \nFY2004 \nFY2005 \nFY2006 \nFY2007 \nFY2008 \nFY2009 a \nDevelopment Expenditure \nFY2004 \nFY2005 \nFY2006 \nFY2007 \nFY2008 \nFY2009 a \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year. \na  These are revised estimates. \nSource: Accountant General Punjab, Civil Accountants; Finance Department, Government of Punjab. \n \nIncomplete MTBF implementation. The primary reason for the lack of precision in the \n4. \nbudget is that the budgeting reforms are still incomplete. Thus far, reforms have focused on the \ntop\u2013down dimension, which is the fiscal framework, while budgeting at the department level has \nremained incremental. The next steps will include (i) prescribing budget ceilings for departments, \n(ii)  improving  department  budgeting,  and  (iii)  setting  up  a  budget  execution  and  monitoring \nsystem.  Political  instability  prevented  the  government  from  undertaking  subsequent  MTBF \nreforms in preparation of the FY2009 budget. The government was unable to roll out the top\u2013\ndown fiscal framework for FY2009\u2013FY2011. Further, budgeting reform in the pilot departments \nenvisaged  to  implement  the  bottom\u2013up  dimension  of  the  MTBF  was  not  undertaken  during \nFY2009 budget preparation. \n \n5. \nThe government reinitiated the MTBF reforms in preparing the FY2010 budget. A new \nfiscal  framework  for  the  top\u2013down  dimension  MTBF  is  being  developed  for  FY2010\u2013FY2012. \nThis will be fully integrated with the FY2010 budget, the latter being reflected as the first year of \nthe  MTBF.  Pilot  implementation  of  output-based  budgeting  is  being  implemented  in  DOH  and \nDI&P. In line with this, a new budget call circular that reflects the budget ceilings for both current \nand  development  budgets  was  issued  to  the  pilot  departments  in  October  2008.  Forms  have \nbeen  designed  to  implement  output-based  budgeting  in  the  pilot  departments.  Training  for \ndrawing and disbursing officers of the spending units has been undertaken, and both the current \nand development budget are expected to be reviewed using the joint protocols developed under \nsubprogram  1.  The  new  MTBF  will  reflect  the  departmental  resource  envelopes.  Adopting  the \nMTBF  process  is  the  first  step  toward  instituting  a  full-fledged  performance  budgeting  system, \nsince the process requires departments to specify goals in the form of measurable outputs and \noutcomes.  Through  MTBF,  the  government  wants  to  move  from  incremental  budgeting  to \nbudgeting based on the actual cost of programs and projects. The government aims eventually \nto  organize  all  expenditure  by  means  of  MTBF  exercises,  including  local  government \n\n \n\n\f \n36 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nexpenditures.  Implementing  MTBF  will  help  do  away  with  the  unwarranted  bifurcation  of  the \nprovincial budget.  \n \n6. \nPrevalence  of  supplementary  grants.  The  MTBF  is  designed  to  introduce  both \naccuracy  and  stability  in  the  budget.  Ideally,  a  well-estimated  budget  should  minimize  the \nintroduction  of  supplementary  budgets.  However,  the  system  in  Punjab  allows  retroactive \napproval  of  supplementary  grants,  by  which  means  the  demand  for  supplementary  grants  for \nthe  current  fiscal  year  are  approved  at  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  together  with  the  next  fiscal \nyear's budget. Supplementary grants have been subject to political requests. As a result, they \nare quite prevalent, averaging around 21% of aggregate expenditures from FY2004 to FY2008 \n(Table A3.2). To address this situation, the Finance Department has instituted a mid-year review \nof  the  FY2009  budget  that  includes  insistence  on  justification  for  supplementary  grants.  In \naddition, pre-budget consultations with members of the provincial assembly were conducted in \nFebruary 2009 in preparation for the FY2010 budget. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Supplementary Grants  \n(PRs '000) \n\n Fiscal Year  \n\nAmount \n\n% of Actual \n\nFY2004 \n\nFY2005 \n\nFY2006 \n\nFY2007 \n\nFY2008 \n\n \n\n              36,891.21  \n\n              40,028.97  \n\n              45,607.96  \n\n              69,107.21  \n\n              53,268.90  \n\n24.9 \n\n22.4 \n\n20.3 \n\n21.5 \n\n15.8 \n\nFY = fiscal year. \nSource: Accountant General Punjab, Civil Accounts; Finance Department, Government of Punjab. \n\n7. \nContinued  weak  coordination  between  budgeting  and  planning.  The  dual \nbudgeting system makes MTBF implementation challenging. It is important that mindsets in both \nthe  Finance  Department  and  P&DD  change  toward  improving  coordination,  particularly  at \noperating  levels.  Operating  procedures  need  to  be  aligned  to  pursue  the  integrated \nimplementation of the MTBF. While the budget call circular issued by the Finance Department \nprescribes  ceilings  for  current  and  development  budgets  with  its  corresponding  templates, \nP&DD  subsequently  issued  another  instruction  for  the  MTDF  with  its  own  ceilings  for \ndepartments. The issuance of dual instructions should be avoided in the future. Further, there is \na  lack  of  coherence  between  the  budget  classification  systems  followed  by  the  Finance \nDepartment  and  the  P&DD.  No  standards  have  been  adopted  to  reclassify  the  scheme-based \nMTDF  classification  to  the  functional,  economic,  and  administrative  classifications  that  are \nconsistent  with  the  chart  of  accounts  of  the  new  accounting  model.  Transforming  the  current \nscheme-wise classification to a chart of account\u2013consistent classification will add an extra layer \nin budget preparation for development expenditures. \n \n8. \nUnderutilized development expenditures (annual development program). Punjab's \nannual development program (ADP) for FY2009 is PRs160 billion, accounting for about 38% of \nthe budget. While the throw-forward for the whole ADP has been kept at about 3 years, it varies \nby sector. In some sectors, such as irrigation, the throw-forward, particularly for new schemes, \ncan extend to more than 20 years. There are no rules to ensure that unapproved schemes will \nbe  approved  during  the  current  fiscal  year  and  a  large  share  of  new  schemes  remain \nunapproved  throughout  the  fiscal  year.  During  mid-year  reviews  of  the  ADP,  funds  are  re-\nappropriated from non-moving or slow-moving schemes to fast-moving ones at the discretion of \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 2     \n\n37\n\n \n\nP&DD.  There  are  no  rules  for  prioritizing  development  schemes,  whose  inclusion  has  been \npartly driven by political requests. \n \n9. \nWeak  revenue  mobilization.  The  lack  of  precision  in  the  provincial  budget  largely \nreflects poor revenue forecasting. For example, federal government transfers account for about \n75%\u201380%  of  total  provincial  receipts.  Lower-than-expected  revenues  from  the  federal \ngovernment  translate  into  lower  fiscal  transfers accruing  to the  government.  Likewise,  there  is \nmuch  potential  for  improving  own-source  revenues.  Both  tax  and  nontax  revenues  have  been \nsignificantly  below  budget  estimates  (Table  A3.3).  Taxation  in  Punjab  is  undertaken  by  two \nagencies, the Excise and Taxation Department (E&TD) and the Board of Revenue. The PRMP \nhad  earlier  attempted  to  reform  the  stamp  tax,  urban  immovable  property  tax  (UIPT),  and \nagricultural income tax but was constrained by the poor tax administration.  \n \n\nTable A2.3: Provincial Revenue Receipts  \n(PRs '000) \n\nFY2007 \nActual  \n23,954.37 \n36,013.09 \n59,967.46 \n\n \n\n \n\nFY2008 \n\nBudget  \n30,343.12 \n57,038.32 \n87,381.44 \n\nActual  \n23,587.47 \n55,988.67 \n79,576.14 \n\nBudget  \n37,315.60 \n85,780.33 \n123,095.92 \n\nDeviation (%) \n(21.1) \n(36.9) \n(31.4) \n\nItem \nTax receipts \nNontax receipts \nTotal \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: Accountant General Punjab, Civil Accounts. \n \n10. \nOwn-source revenue generation is hampered by weak tax administration capacity and \nthe prevalence of leakage in the tax system. E&TD administers eight taxes, of which the UIPT \nhas the strongest revenue potential. Yet, this tax has been poorly administrated. No survey has \nbeen  undertaken  since  2001,  resulting  in  considerable  undervaluing  of  property.  Exemptions \nhave significantly diluted the revenue potential of the UIPT. E&TD has indicated that about 50% \nof the tax base (1.8 million properties) is exempt, which amounts to PRs2.4 billion in foregone \nrevenues. \n \n\nDeviation (%) \n(36.8) \n(34.7) \n(35.4) \n\nTable A2.4: Excise and Taxation Department Collection  \n(PRs million) \n\nTaxes \nProperty tax \n\nMotor vehicle tax \n\nEntertainment duty \n\nCotton fee \n\nProfessional tax \n\nExcise fee \n\nHotel tax \n\nMedicinal opium tax \n\nArrears of abolished taxes \n\nTotal \n\nFY2007 \n2,147.0 \n\n4,527.6 \n\n60.9 \n\n453.4 \n\n270.7 \n\n830.7 \n\n279.6 \n\n11.2 \n\n0.4 \n\nFY2008 \n2,467.4 \n\n4,260.3 \n\n39.4 \n\n380.9 \n\n296.0 \n\n986.9 \n\n275.2 \n\n15.9 \n\n74.0 \n\n8,581.5 \n\n8,796.1 \n\nFY = fiscal year. \nSource: Excise and Taxation Department, Government of Punjab. \n\n \n11. \nThe  government  has  taken  steps  toward  reforming  the  property  tax  in  Punjab.  In \nDecember 2007, it adopted its 5-year medium-term framework for UIPT reforms. Among the key \nsteps  is  the  establishment  of  a  review  committee  for  the  UIPT.  The  committee  was  notified  in \nAugust  2008,  and  a  report  was  prepared  in  October  2008  outlining  the  reform  options  on  the \n\n \n\n\f \n38 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nUIPT, including rationalizing exemptions. With World Bank support, a draft UIPT law has been \nprepared and is being review by the government.  \n \n12. \nE&TD is currently developing and populating its property database, which can be used \nfor billing and assessment. As of February 2009, the database included 100,000 properties. An \nongoing reform is linking the geographic information system\u2014referred to as Iris and developed \nby the Urban Unit of P&DD\u2014with the E&TD property database to improve the collection of the \nUIPT.  Started  in  2008,  Iris  aims  to  digitize  700,000  properties  in  Lahore  and  store  them  in  a \ngeographic  information  system  environment  where  they  can  be  matched  up  with  E&TD \nassessment and billing information.  \n\n \n\n13. \nThe other tax that has good yield potential is the motor vehicle tax (MVT). E&TD  has \nindicated that it has a fairly good motor vehicle registration database but that there are problems \nwith the collection points. The MVT is paid to post offices and the National Bank of Pakistan (the \nbank). Payments through post offices are done manually  without maintaining proper collection \nrecords.  There  is  no  online  connection  with  the  bank.  Discussions  for  online  connection  have \nbeen  initiated  with  the  bank,  but  they  have  stalled  and  the  latter  has  not  shown  an  interest  in \npursuing this option. E&TD has suggested that collection could be done through private banks \nthat can establish an online link with E&TD. On the professional tax, E&TD suggested that one \nway  to  improve  collection  is  to  introduce  such  electronic  payments  as  credit  cards  and  smart \ncards. \n \n14. \nE&TD has raised issues about its weak capacity for tax collection. There is also scope \nfor  reforming  the  structure  of  E&TD  to  more  clearly  demarcate  assessment,  collection,  audit, \nand  appeal.  Currently,  tax  assessment  and  collection  are  not  separated,  and  there  is  no \neffective tax audit or internal control. There is likewise scope for tax facilitation measures. One \npossible reform is to establish model E&TD collection offices that are taxpayer friendly.  \n \nThe Board of Revenue collects five taxes, with the stamp duty and registration fee as \n15. \nthe  high-yielding  ones.  It  has  looked  at  possible  administrative  or  process  reforms  for  these \ntaxes,  but  these  necessitate  legislative  measures  that  require  the  approval  of  the  federal \nparliament.  In  February  2007,  the  government  approved  the  Board  of  Revenue  Automation \nProject,  amounting  to  PRs50  million,  which  aims  to  (i)  improve  the  efficiency  of  work  and \nmaintenance  of  records  in  the  Board  of  Revenue  by  automating  systems  and  reengineering \nbusiness  processes  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  capacity  building  of  Board  of  Revenue  staff  to \nimprove their efficiency. The project has not been implemented, however.   \n \nB. \n \n16. \nBackground.  The  civil  service  retirement  system  has  two  main  parts:  the  pension \nscheme and the General Provident Fund (GP Fund). In addition, civil servants are covered by \nthe  benevolent  fund  scheme  and  a  group  insurance  policy.  This  analysis  covers  only  the \npension and GP Fund schemes.  \n \nThe  pension  scheme  is  non-contributory  and  pay-as-you-go  with  defined  benefits. \n17. \nPensions  are  paid  from  the  budget  and  do  not  require  employee  contributions.  So  far,  the \nbudget  covers  the  full  cost  of  pensions.  The  benefit  is  determined  by  a  formula  based  on  the \nfinal  monthly  basic  salary  times  2.33%  for  each  year  of  service  completed.  The  normal \nretirement age is 60, subject to having completed 10 years of service. For those who fail to meet \nthe  minimum  requirement,  a  gratuity  is  paid.  A  maximum  of  30  years  of  service  can  be \ncomputed to reach a maximum pension benefit equal to 70% of the basic wage. Civil servants \n\nManagement of Contingent Pension and GP Fund Liabilities \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 2     \n\n39\n\n \n\ncan retire voluntarily after 25 years of service. Up to 35% of the pension benefit can be taken as \na lump sum. The remainder is paid as an annuity until death. Upon the death of a recipient, a \nsurvivor\u2019s  benefit  equal  to  half  the  pension  is  paid.  Disability  benefits  are  also  provided.  The \nannuity is not indexed but rather increased on a discretionary basis.  \n \n18. \nThe GP Fund is a contributory, notionally funded, defined contribution scheme. Monthly \ncontributions, ranging between 3%  and 8% of basic pay, are deducted from the civil servants' \nmonthly pay. To date, employee contributions are not kept separately in a fund but included in \nthe  budget.  Interest  rates  are  annually  declared  by  the  federal  Ministry  of  Finance  and  have \naveraged  15%  annually  over  the  past  35  years,  well  above  market  rates  and  substantially \nincreasing the final benefit payment. Civil servants can borrow from their GP Fund for specific \npurposes up to the age of 50. After this age, civil servants can borrow up to 60% of the balance \nwithout having to give a reason or pay back the advance. After age 55, an advance of 80% of \nthe balance can be made. The remaining balance is paid out as a lump sum at the age of 60. \n \n19. \nRising  pension  and  GP  Fund  costs  and  liabilities.  The  actuarial  assessment, \ncommissioned  under  the  first  subprogram,  estimated  the  accrued  pension  liability  at  PRs425 \nbillion as of 30 June 2007, of which 70% pertains to current civil servants and the remainder to \npensioners. Annual pension expenditure was projected to increase rapidly from PRs15.1 billion \nin FY2009 to PRs63.5 billion in FY2024, a growth of 10% each year over the next 15 years. A \npreliminary update of pension liability shows that the accrued pension liability grew to PRs515 \nbillion as of 30 June 2008. The increase in liability arises mainly from significantly higher salary \nincreases  (20%)  and  pension  indexation  (20%)  announced  in  the  2009  budget  speech, \ncompared to the respective 9% and 6% assumed in the actuarial assessment.    \n \n20. \nIn September 2007, the government passed the Pension Fund Act and prepared a note \nproviding a funding strategy up to 2030 for the Punjab Pension Fund. The government planned \nto transfer PRs100 billion ($1.7 billion) to the Punjab Pension Fund and the General Provident \nInvestment  Fund  by  FY2016.  After  the  initial  period,  annual  funding  would  be  linked  to  the \npayroll expenditure of the government. The capitalization would allow the government to cover \napproximately  30%  of  the  pension  expenditures  from  FY2016-FY2030.  Under  subprogram  1, \nthe government and ADB agreed on the funding strategy outlined below. \n \n21. \nSo  far,  the  government  has  put  aside  in  FY2009  and  FY  2010,  in  a  bank  account \nseparate  from  the  government  budget,  PRs12  billion,  lower  than  the  PRs20  billion  originally \nenvisaged.  The  change  in  economic  climate  and  the  reduced  loan  size  and  delayed \ndisbursement  for  subprogram  2  are  the  main  reasons  for  slower-than-planned  capitalization. \nFinancing  the  funding  strategy  for  pensions  has  to  compete  with  more  urgent  spending  on \nsecurity,  subsidies,  and  social  safety  nets,  as  well  as  the  continued  need  to  repay  expensive \ndomestic debts. At the same time, the pace and volume of ADB budget support is much lower \nthan  projected  in  2007.  A  new  funding  strategy  is  prepared  based  on  an  updated  actuarial \nvaluation. Over time, the strategy will need to be adapted to changing circumstances. \n \n22. \nIn  2007,  the  government  adopted  the  Punjab  Pension  Fund  Act  and  created  an \ninvestment  fund  into  which  it  would  transfer  monies  to  finance  part  of  the  future  civil  service \npension  payments.  International  best  practice  requires  a  set  of  internal  statutes  and  external \nregulations  to  ensure  that  the  investment  fund  is  managed  in  the  best  interests  of  the \nbeneficiaries.  Substantial  progress  has  been  made  since  the  creation  of  the  Punjab  Pension \nFund. A management committee has been established. Staff for the investment unit, including \nthe  general  manager,  have  been  hired  from  the  private  sector.  A  trustee,  legal  advisor,  and \n\n \n\n\f \n40 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nexternal  auditor  have  been  appointed.  A  short-term  investment  strategy  has  been  developed \nbased on the new financing strategy and in line with the investment policy. \n \n23. \nThe  Punjab  General  Provident  Investment  Fund  (GPIF)  Act  was  enacted  by  the \nprovincial  assembly  on  2  July  2009,  after  which  the  management  committee  notified  the  new \nfunds  regulations.  Both  the  Punjab  Pension  Fund  account  and  the  GPIF  account  will  be \nmanaged by a single investment unit. This will require some changes in the oversight board and \nin  the  investment  unit  of  the  Punjab  Pension  Fund.  Additional  reforms  are  required  in  the \nmanagement committee to strengthen oversight.  \n \n24. \nIt is necessary to look at the long-term costs on an accrual basis to assess the solvency \nand  long-term  sustainability  of  the  pension  and  GP  Fund  schemes.  Initial  estimates  based  on \nthe  actuarial  assessment  show  that  the  pension  and  GP  Fund  costs  currently  reported  are \nsubstantially lower than the accrued value. \n \n25. \nPoor  data-  and  record-keeping.  The  information  currently  available  is  of  insufficient \nquality to allow decisions ensuring adequate management of the pension scheme and GP Fund, \nmuch less to produce reliable actuarial estimates. The available data is insufficient for reliable \nanalysis of current and future costs. The quality of planning and management decisions suffers \nas they are made on inaccurate, incomplete, and inadequate information. No pension scheme \ncan operate optimally without an adequate, reliable, and current database. All pension and GP \nFund records were stored manually in ledger books, which are difficult to access. The Project to \nImplement  Financial  Reporting  and  Accounting  (PIFRA)  was  introduced  to  computerize  the \nwhole accounting and auditing system of the country, including automating the employee payroll, \npension, and GP Fund record-keeping system. The main challenge is to populate the database \nwith accurate and complete data, especially the historic GP Fund data that covers the monthly \ncontributions of all civil servants starting from the date of appointment. A pilot project has been \ninitiated to test alternative methods of collecting, verifying, and entering accurate and complete \ndata in the most efficient and cost-effective way.  \n \nC. \n \nAn  efficient,  accountable,  and  enabling  civil  service  is  the  backbone  of  a  country\u2019s \n26. \ninstitutional architecture. With Punjab's 40 departments, 35 districts, and hundreds of municipal \nadministrations,  and,  most  importantly,  86  million  people,  the  civil  service  machinery  of  the \ngovernment must be well structured, have efficient business processes, and be geared toward \nthe effective delivery of public services. The need to reform the civil service has been felt both \nnationally and provincially. The most prominent reforms at the federal level were introduced in \n1973  and  2001.  Despite  various  reform  attempts,  the  common  perception  is  that  the  system \nremains similar to that inherited from Pakistan\u2019s colonial past. A survey by the Pakistan Institute \nof Development Economics indicates widespread negative perceptions and general discontent \nabout public services and disillusionment among civil servants. The civil service system suffers \nmany problems, some of the most crucial of which are summarized below.  \n  \n\nCivil Service Reform \n\n1. \n\nKey Issues \n\na. \n\nOverstretched Government Functions \n\nPunjab needs productive employment to generate income for its people. It also needs \n27. \nmore  and  better  social  and  infrastructure  services.  Yet  per  capita  development  expenditure  in \nPunjab  is  only  about  $16  per  year.  The  constraints  on  the  government\u2019s  financial  and  human \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 2     \n\n41\n\n \n\nresources mean that attracting private sector participation in the economy is essential. Further, \nthere  is  increasing  empirical  evidence  that  the  private  sector  is  more  suited  to  and  efficient  in \ncarrying out economic activities. In recent years, there have been increasing successful models \nfor private sector participation in infrastructure and social services, a domain that is traditionally \nmonopolized  by  the  public  sector.  Increased  private  sector  participation,  however,  does  not \nmean  that  the  government  will  abdicate  or  dilute  its  responsibilities;  rather,  these  can \nincreasingly  be  more  strategic  and  targeted.  The  government  will  remain  the  referee  to  make \nand apply the rules and regulations to ensure a level playing field and quality of services. \n \n28. \nCivil  service  reform  (CSR)  needs  to  deal  with  the  division  of  responsibilities  between \nthe private and public sectors. Pakistan has carried out privatization and deregulation over the \npast  2  decades  and  benefited  from  a  more  dynamic  private  sector.  The  process  remains \nincomplete, however. The government owns 123 autonomous bodies, many of which engage in \ncommercial  activities  at  a  loss.  In  addition  to  autonomous  bodies,  some  government \ndepartments  undertake  economic  activities,  such  as  the  printing  press  in  the  Industries \nDepartment.  \n \n29. \nThe  PGEIP  supports  in-depth  reforms  in  E&TD  and  the  Livestock  and  Dairy \nDepartment.  A  functional  review  is  especially  important  for  L&DD.  In  addition  to  providing \nextensive  services,  the  department  undertakes  the  production  of  animal  feed  and  vaccines.  It \nowns  more  than  2,000  hectares  of  land  and  20  farms  whose  productivity  is  low.  Livestock \ncontributes  over  40%  of  total  agricultural  outputs.  Farmers  derive  40%  of  their  income  from \nlivestock,  and  35  million  rural  people  are  engaged  in  raising  livestock.  Despite  its  importance, \nthe  sector  encounters  many  problems.  Fodder  and  feed  resources  are  inadequate,  and  the \nproductivity  of  fodder  is  low  because  of  poor  research  and  extension  support.  Animal  health \ncover  and  artificial  insemination  are  still  far  from  satisfactory.  The  standardization  of  livestock \nproducts  is  also  weak.  Only  3%  of  milk  is  processed.  A  functional  review  of  L&DD  needs  to \nexplore how the private sector can play a larger role in supporting dairy industry development. \nL&DD has already started work along these lines.   \n \n\nb. \n\nOutdated Business Process \n\nInefficient  processes  absorb  many  resources  for  unproductive  activities.  Government \n30. \nprocedures  in  Punjab  are  generally  considered  lengthy  and  cumbersome.  The  advent  of \ninformation technology provides great scope for business process reengineering to improve the \nefficiency and responsiveness of the government. In Punjab, the use of information technology \nis limited in the public sector despite a vibrant private information technology sector. The switch \nfrom  manual to automated processes is slow and will require a new skills mix and training for \ncivil servants. The PGEIP supports the automation of processes in a number of organizations, \nsuch as E&TD, L&DD, Punjab Public Service Commission, and Management and Professional \ntechnology  will \nDepartment.  Business  process  reengineering  supported  by \neventually be expanded to the whole government.  \n \n\ninformation \n\nc. \n\nObsolete Human Resource Management System \n\n31. \nThe human resource management system in Punjab suffers from many problems. The \nPunjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) recruits public servants for the basic pay scale2 17 \n                                                 \n2 The civil service of Pakistan is structured across 22 basic pay scales (BPS). With some exceptions, the government \nofficers of BPS 17 and higher are categorized as gazetted officers and assigned middle to senior level managerial \nresponsibilities  such  as  heads  of  sections,  departments,  field  offices  and  drawing  and  disbursing  officers.  Civil \nservants below BPS 17 generally work as support staff. \n\n \n\n\f \n42 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nand above. Structural, capacity, and procedural constraints cause long delays in recruitment, up \nto 1 year in some cases. A large proportion of civil servants do not have job descriptions. The \nannual  confidential  report,  instead  of  being  a  performance  evaluation  record,  is  commonly \nregarded as a compliance task. Moreover, performance evaluations play a limited role in career \nprogression in a system in which promotions are largely based on seniority. There is substantial \nevidence that the real compensation gap between public and private salaries and conditions has \nsteadily  widened.  In  addition,  the  wage  structure  is  not  linked  to  performance  and  does  not \nprovide  adequate  incentives  for  good  performance.  The  provincial  government  has  no  control \nover civil service salary scales, which are set by the federal government. The government can, \nhowever,  create  contract  positions  outside  the  cadre  scales  or  pay  additional  allowances  for \nspecific  positions.  For  example,  project  or  program  management  units  have  been  used  as  a \ndevice to create specific positions attracting higher rewards. However, the creation of islands of \nexcellence  has  caused  uneasiness  among  civil  servants.  Tenure  is  short,  and  transfers  are \noften  made  within  a  year,  eroding  performance.  Often,  incumbents  barely  have  time  to  settle \ninto  a  new  job  before  they  are  moved  on.  Capacity  constraints  in  the  public  sector  are  acute, \nand training is not valued.  \n  \n\n2. \n\nPunjab's Efforts in Civil Service Reform    \n\n32. \nThe root causes of most civil service problems can be traced to structural, procedural, \nand  motivational  deficiencies  in  the  overall  system  of  governance.  Any  attempts  to  treat  the \nsymptoms  in  an  isolated  manner  without  tackling  the  root  causes  will  not  be  effective.  The \nreform  package  thus  must  be  comprehensive,  with  a  clear  blueprint,  but  be  introduced  in  a \nproperly  phased  and  sequenced  manner.  Fully  aware  of  the  challenges  it  faces  in  attempting \nsuch reforms, the government carried out widespread consensus building on CSR with private \nand public sector stakeholders. It has also taken steps to push forward reforms. A high-powered \nCSR Task Force has been set up. A CSR policy has been approved by the cabinet to enable \nand guide CSR. Two departments, E&TD and L&DD, have been selected by the Government of \nPunjab  to  undertake  fully  fledged  functional  reviews,  business  process  reengineering,  and \nhuman resource reforms. Supported by the Program, PPSC has moved away from an inefficient \nprocedures  of  interviewing  all  candidates  to  only  the  shortlisted  candidates.  Other  efforts  of \nbusiness  process  reengineering  in  PPSC  is  underway  and  expected  to  significantly  improve \nefficiency in recruitment. The government has strengthened its training capability to upgrade the \nskills  of  provincial  employees.  The  government  has  started  to  clearly  benchmark  civil  service \nperformance  indicators,  initially  in  E&TD,  L&DD,  and  PPSC.  The  comparison  of  performance \nbefore and after will be essential for evaluating the impact of reforms, as well as for encouraging \ndepartments to improve performance and service delivery.  \n \nD. \n \nBackground. Punjab's private sector plays an important role in Pakistan. About 70% of \n33. \nmanufacturing  establishments  are  located  in  Punjab.  Punjab  produces  the  bulk  of  most \nindustrial  outputs:  77%  of  sugar,  70%  of  fertilizer,  69%  of  cotton  yarn,  96%  of  paper  and \npaperboard, and 44% of cement. The elasticity of outputs with respect to employment for most \nindustries is above 1, indicating that a 1% increase in outputs leads to an increase of more than \n1% in employment. The textiles sector is the largest, with the highest rate of labor absorption, \nemploying  56%  of  the  industrial  labor  force.  The  bulk  of  Punjab's  firms  employ  fewer  than  10 \nworkers.    The  economy  of  Punjab  is  undergoing  structural  transformation  away  from  its \ntraditional reliance on agriculture toward increased dependence on manufacturing and services. \nThe  share  of  agriculture  declined  from  31%  in  FY1991  to  21%  in  FY2006,  while  that  of \nmanufacturing  increased  from  13%  to  20%  and  of  services  from  49%  to  53%.  Despite  the \n\nSupport Dynamic Private Sector\u2013Led Growth \n\n \n\n\f      \n\nAppendix 2     \n\n43\n\n \n\nchanges,  44%  of  Punjab\u2019s  labor  force  is  employed  in  agriculture  However,  strong  growth  in \nmanufacturing  and  services  will  be  crucial  to  generating  future  productive  employment \nopportunities.   \n \nPunjab's  business  climate  is  constrained  by  regulatory  hurdles,  low  human  capital \n34. \ncapacity,  and  poor  infrastructure,  among  other  factors.  Consequently,  the  private  sector \noperates  mostly  informally.  A  study  by  the  World  Bank3 pointed  out  that  improvements  in  the \ninvestment  climate  (such  as  a  reduction  in  power  outages  and  in  management  time  spent \ndealing  with  regulations,  etc.)  could  sharply  increase  the  productivity  of  firms.  Some  of  the \nresults  could  be  quite  spectacular.  The  report  estimated  that  if  the  quality  of  the  investment \nenvironment  in  Pakistan  were  to  match  that  of  Shanghai,  the  productivity  of  Pakistan's  textile \nfirms  operating  in  Karachi  would  improve  on  average  by  81%,  the  rate  of  return  to  capital  by \n36%, and wages by 23%. Some key business climate issues are discussed below.  \n \n\n1. \n\nRemoving Infrastructure Bottlenecks through Public\u2013Private Partnership  \n\n \nWeak  physical  infrastructure  has  been  a  major  factor  hindering  the  competitiveness \n35. \nand performance of manufacturing in Pakistan. The expensive and unreliable electricity supply \nposes  heavy  costs  on  business.  To  minimize  downtime  caused  by  problems  in  power  supply, \nfirms are often forced to use their own generators. The use of generators is estimated to tie up \nto about 12% of firms' fixed capital assets. The unsatisfactory state of the transportation network \nhas  imposed  enormous  costs  on  the  economy:  according  to  a  recent  estimate,  inefficiency  in \ntransport alone costs the economy of Pakistan PRs320 billion a year, and a large share of this \ncost  is  in  Punjab.  The  lack  of  repair  and  maintenance  of  existing  roads  has  caused  rapid \ndeterioration of the road network. It is estimated that 90% of the provincial road network is rated \nas fair to poor. Poor urban infrastructure and service delivery\u2014in water supply and sanitation, \nurban transport, and solid waste management\u2014impairs the competitiveness of firms, affects the \nenvironment and health, and constrains investment growth.   \n  \n36. \nDeveloping  infrastructure  requires  large  capital  investment.  While  Pakistan's  total \ndevelopment expenditure budget was only $6 billion in FY2009, the estimated need for annual \ninfrastructure  investment  is  $20 billion,  and  a  large  share  of  this  is  in  Punjab.  In  recent  years, \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) has emerged as a major instrument for financing and providing \npublic  services,  gradually  replacing  the  traditional  public  sector  modality.  Developed  countries \nsuch  as  Canada  and  Singapore  require  that  large  public  investment  projects  go  through  a \nfiltering process and be carried out using PPP unless there are compelling reasons not to do so.   \n \n37. \nIn  view  of  the  government's  limited  resources,  it  has  introduced  several  partnership \nmodels,  including  developing  industrial  estates,  developing  the  livestock  and  dairy  industry, \nencouraging  the  expansion  and  development  of  housing,  and  promoting  skill  development \nthrough  the  Technical  Education  and  Vocational  Training  Authority.  However,  mainstreaming \nPPP  requires  enabling  institutional,  legal,  and  financial  frameworks.  It  also  requires  that \ngovernment  departments  have  adequate  skills  to  design  and  implement  PPP.  Institutional, \npolicy,  and  legal  frameworks  in  Punjab  are  not  well  developed.  There  are  acute  capacity \nconstraints, with very little locally available experience in developing PPP projects. The lack of \nsuccessful PPP projects makes it difficult to judge the risks involved.      \n \n\n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2006.

Washington DC. \n\n \n\n\f \n44 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nThe  government  has  made  substantial  progress \n\ntoward  creating  an  enabling \n38. \nenvironment for PPP.4 A PPP Cell has been notified. A PPP framework has been developed to \noutline  a  road  map  for  developing  PPP.  A  PPP  policy  has  been  approved  by  the  Cabinet, \narticulating  the  government's  intention  to  adopt  PPP  as  a  key  modality  for  infrastructure  and \nsocial  service  delivery.  A  PPP  law  has  been  prepared  and  discussed  with  stakeholders,  and \nwas submitted to the provincial assembly. A series of training workshops have been held for key \nline  departments.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  support  PPP  project  development.  Project \ndevelopment  facility  (PDF)  guidelines  were  approved  by  the  provincial  cabinet,  and  PDF  was \ncapitalized  with  a  fund  of  about  $1  million.  A  list  of  potentially  bankable  projects  has  been \ndeveloped,  and  work  on  selected  projects  has  started.  The  PGEIP  will  support  Punjab\u2019s \nmainstreaming of PPP with at least 20% of infrastructure and social services projects delivered \nthrough PPP in a decade, up from a current level that is negligible.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImproving Regulatory Frameworks.  \n\n \n39. \nMost  regulations  remain  within  the  purview  of  federal  government.  Overregulation  is \nprevalent, with nearly 60 separate government regulations and laws being applied to small and \nmedium-sized  firms.  One  particular  issue  in  Pakistan  is  the  lack  of  review  and  updating  of \nregulations.  Many  regulations  were  developed  in  the  colonial  era  and  continue  on  the  books \ndespite  long  since  outliving  their  usefulness.  Over  time,  new  and  sometimes  conflicting \nregulations  have  been  developed,  creating  a  complex  web.  Proper  institutional  mechanisms \nneed to be set up to review and update regulations and to evaluate the cost and benefits of new \nregulations. While these efforts need to be spearheaded by the federal government, provincial \ngovernments  can  make  a  positive  contribution  by  actively  engaging  in  dialogue  with  it  and \nsimplifying regulations that fall within their mandate.  \n \n40. \nSupported  by  the  World  Bank,  Punjab  is  undertaking  its  first  doing  business  survey. \nPreliminary results indicate that compliance costs are considered high by most firms. The final \nresults  will  feed  into  the  identification  and  addressing  of  regulatory  barriers.  The  PGEIP  will \nsupport Punjab's efforts to simplify existing regulations and undertake regulatory impact analysis \nfor new regulations.  \n \nE. \n \n41. \nThe government has identified income growth and improved social services as its twin \ndevelopment  objectives.  Punjab\u2019s  Vision  2020  projects  Punjab  as  a  reasonably  well-off, \neducated, and healthy society by 2020, envisaging a doubling of per capita income to $2,000 in \nthe  same  period.  The  government  wants  to  adopt  modern  public  sector  management \ntechniques  to  achieve  this  vision  and  is  in  the  process  of  introducing  a  results-based \nmanagement  (RBM)  framework  linking  development  objectives,  outcomes,  outputs,  systems, \nand resources to guide reforms and monitor the progress of the province in realizing its vision.   \n \n42. \nRBM  is  a  public  sector  management  philosophy  and  approach  that  focuses  on \nachieving goals and objectives through strategic planning; systematic implementation; effective \nresource use; and performance monitoring, measurement, reporting, and evaluation to improve \nresult delivery. It has been successfully implemented by many countries, most notably Malaysia \nand Canada. Punjab has started to introduce the result framework and desires to benefit from \n\nAdopt Results-Based Management \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  2007.

The key sectors include education, health, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  irrigation  and  power,  transport,  livestock  and  dairy,  taxation,  and \nprivate sector development. RBM pays particular attention to achieving positive gender results.  \n \n43. \nPunjab's  RBM  framework  focuses  on  achieving  development  goals  through  clearly \nidentified  development  targets.  While  it  stresses  the  importance  of  identifying  and  tracking \ndevelopment  indicators,  it  pays  special  attention  to  improving  the  efficiency  of  resource \nmanagement.  In  this  regard,  it  is  critical  to  put  in  place  sound  public  financial  management, \nhuman  resource  management,  efficient  business  processes  supported  by \ninformation \ntechnology,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  There  are  great  needs  for  optimizing  the \nfunction  of  government  and  enabling  greater  private  sector  participation  in  economic  activities \nand  delivering  infrastructure  and  social  services.  These  form  the  foundation  for  delivering \ndevelopment  results.  Over  time,  the  RBM  framework  will  support  a  development  agenda  that \nshifts  emphasis  from  inputs  and  activities  to  greater  accountability  for  results,  and  it  will \ntransform  public  sector  management  in  Punjab  from  rigid  micro  management  to  greater \naccountability for development results, combined with flexibility and autonomy for management.    \n \n\nTable

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nIn January 2009, the Government of Pakistan released its second National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-\nII). It covers a 3-year period from fiscal year (FY) 2009 to FY2011. PRSP-II builds upon nine pillars: (i) macroeconomic \nstability  and  real  sector  growth,  (ii)  protecting  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable,  (iii)  increasing  productivity  and  value \naddition in agriculture, (iv) an integrated energy development program, (v) making industry internationally competitive, \n(vi) human  development  for  the  21st  century,  (vii)  removing  bottlenecks  through  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP), \n(viii) capital  and  finance  for  development,  and  (ix)  governance  for  a  just  and  fair  system.  The  Punjab  Government \nEfficiency Improvement Program (PGEIP) echoes the strategic thrust of PRSP-II, focusing on the efficient and effective \ndelivery  of  public  services.  Common  areas  between  the  federal  and  provincial  development  strategies  include \n(i) strengthening tax administration to mobilize additional resources for development; (ii) improving accountability and \nfinancial  management  by  developing  a  medium-term  budgetary  framework  (MBTF);  (iii)  civil  service  reform  toward  a \ncompetent, effective, and neutral civil service; and (iv) the promotion of PPP to increase demand for income-generating \nemployment and the provision of key services and to overcome constraints on the government's financial and human \nresources. \n \nProvincial  financial  resource  management  reform  is  a  major  strategic  area  in  ADB's  Country  Partnership  Strategy \n2009\u20132013,  aiming  to  reduce  market  distortions  and  institutional  bottlenecks,  improve  public  financial  and  human \nresource  management,  develop  the  private  sector,  and  promote  structural  transformation.  The  other  main  strategic \nareas  are  energy,  infrastructure  and  urban  services.  Building  on  the  first  generation  reforms  included  in  the  public \nresource  management  programs  (PRMPs)  and  the  devolved  social  services  programs,  new  assistance  under  the \nCountry  Partnership  Strategy  is  focused  on  improving  medium-term  budgetary  frameworks,  strengthening  the \nprovincial  government's  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  expenditure  allocations,  strengthening  tax  administration  skills, \nand creating an enabling business and regulatory environment that reduces the cost of doing business. \nB. \n1.  Key Issues  \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                                    Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nPunjab  experienced  strong  annual  growth  of  7%\u20138%  between  FY2003  and  FY2008,  allowing  significant  poverty \nreduction.  Federal  poverty  estimates  based  on  the  2005/06  Pakistan  Socioeconomic  Living  Standard  Measurement \nSurveya  indicated  a  decline  in  the  number  of  people  living  below  the  poverty  lineb  from  34.5%  of  the  population  in \nFY2000/01  to  22.3%  in  FY2005/06,  a  decline  of  12.2%.  While  the  magnitude  of  the  decline  is  disputed,  the  trend  is \nwidely accepted. The key issue is whether the trend can be sustained and the pace of poverty reduction is fast enough. \nEven with a poverty level of 22.3%, roughly 35 million people would still be living below the poverty line. This is higher \nthan the number of poor in Pakistan in FY1996/97. Further, rural poverty is substantially more prevalent than in urban \nareas. In FY2004/05, the overall poverty incidence in Punjab was 29.7%, with the 20.6% urban area rate much lower \nthan the 33.9% rural rate. \n \nThe  lack  of  new  poverty  data  after  FY2005/06  precludes  an  update  of  the  poverty  situation,  but  it  is  probable  that \npoverty started increasing again in FY2008/09 with high domestic inflation caused by high food and energy prices. The \nPunjab Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey indicates that the impact of food price increases on poverty is substantially \ngreater than the impact of energy price increases. A 20% increase in food prices would lead to an 8% increase in the \npoverty  head  count,  from  36%  to  44%,  with  the  harmful  impact  of  food  price  shocks  falling  disproportionately  on  the \nrural poor.  \n2. Design Features \n\nAlthough the PGEIP is categorized as a general intervention, it has a pro-poor focus with an increased expenditure on \nsocial safety nets. In the face of recent dramatic food shocks, the government decided to provide food security to poor \nhouseholds through (i) the Punjab Food Support Scheme, (ii) the Sasti Roti Scheme, (iii) the Free Medicine Initiative, \n(iv) support for deserving students, and (v) the Green Tractors Scheme. The Punjab Food Support Scheme provides \ncash  transfers  of  PRs1,000  per  month  to  1.8  million  poor  families.  The  cost  of  the  scheme  is  estimated  at \nPRs10.8 billion  for  FY2009.  Sasti  Roti  subsidizes  tandoors  to  provide  roti  to  the  poor  at  a  rate  of  Prs2  per  roti.  The \nFinance  Department  indicated  that  PRs6.1  billion  would  be  spent  under  the  scheme  in  FY2009.  The  Free  Medicine \nInitiative is expected to cost PRs1.8 billion in FY2010. Support for deserving students is expected to cost PRs3 billion, \nand the Green Tractor Scheme PRs2 billion. The PGEIP supports pro-poor expenditure by improving public resource \nmanagement and creating fiscal space.  \n\n \n\n\f74 \n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nA.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n\n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) to the country and major groups affected. \n\n \nThe PGEIP will provide significant benefits in general and directed benefits for the poor in particular.  \n \n\n(i)  First, it will help the government to improve public financial management by strengthening the revenue system, as \n\nwell as improving spending efficiency.  \n\n(ii)  Second,  the  PGEIP  will  help  the  government  to  improve  contingent  liability  management  by  capitalizing  the \nPunjab  Pension  Fund  and  the  General  Provident  Investment  Fund  and  by  instilling  sound  fiduciary  practices  in \nfund management, as well as by improving the record-keeping and administration of both schemes. \n\n(iii)  Third,  the  PGEIP  will  contribute  to  enhancing  civil  service  management  by  improving  the  functions,  business \nprocesses, and human resource management of the civil service and by linking performance with service delivery \nindicators. \n\n(iv)  Fourth, the PGEIP will enable the private sector by promoting PPP for infrastructure and social service delivery \n\nand improving the regulatory environment. \n\n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \n\n \n\nanalysis). \n\n \nThe government faces multiple challenges. Poverty is high, and social indicators are low. Infrastructure and productive \nemployment  opportunities  are  lacking.  At  the  same  time  the  government  faces  fiscal  constraints  resulting  in  annual \nbudget  deficits.  The  PGEIP  will  assist  the  government  in  strengthening  both  the  provincial  revenue  systems  and \nexpenditure  management,  including  improved  contingent  liability  management  needed  for  improved  spending \nefficiency, allowing for a larger share of development expenditure, which in turn supports the provision of infrastructure \nand social services for social development and economic growth. The reform of the civil service will eventually lead to a \ncompetent,  effective,  and  neutral  civil  service  that  will  provide  better  services  to  the  public  for  some  core  public \nservices. It will encourage greater private sector participation. The private sector is in general a more efficient creator of \njobs.  As  such,  it  can  contribute  to  employment  generation  and  at  the  same  time  create  more  fiscal  space  by  taking \npressure off the government budget.   \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. \n \nThe challenge of poverty alleviation remains huge. Pakistan, being a signatory to the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), is committed to achieving the MDG target for poverty by halving the incidence of poverty between 1990 and \n2015, from an estimated 26% in 1990 to 13%. With the latest poverty estimates from FY2005/06 at 22.3%, there is a \nlong  way  to  go.  The  poverty  problem  cannot  be  eliminated  immediately  and  will  require  sustained  efforts.  The \ncontinued  and  consistent  pursuit  of  pro-poor  growth  policies\u2014along  with  accompanying  investments;  a  focus  on \neffective  investment  spending;  and  the  forging  of  long-term  partnerships  with  the  private  sector,  civil  society,  and \ndevelopment institutions\u2014will be key to ensuring the long-term success of the government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy \nand programs.    \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nThe 2007 Punjab Economic Survey found 20% of the provincial population to be poor, with a higher concentration of \npoor  in  the  rural  areas  (44%).  This  means  roughly  18  million  people  in  Punjab  live  under  the  poverty  line,  and \nvulnerability is high. Social indicators are poor in Punjab. Malnutrition is high, with one third of children under 5 being \nunderweight, which poses a serious public health problem. The infant mortality rate and the maternal mortality rate are \ndouble the MDG targets. The literacy rate for children 10 years of age is 56% in Punjab, and the dropout rate is 30%. \nOnly  half  of  the  population  is  served  by  piped  water  systems  and  a  covered  sewerage  system.  The  lack  of  human \ndevelopment  is  a  hindrance  for  social  and  economic  progress.  Further. Punjab  faces  large  infrastructure  deficits  that \nhamper  economic  growth.  The  lack  of  productive  employment  opportunities  is  another  serious  problem.  The  PGEIP \nfully recognizes and confronts the institutional roots of these problems.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe design of the PGEIP is the result of stakeholder consultations at all levels of government and with civil society. The \nconsensus-building strategy for the second subprogram of the PGEIP is in line with that used for the PRMP, which was \nthe result of a policy dialogue that began in 2002 and continues today.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n75\n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \nThe  PGEIP  entails  a  continuous  policy  dialogue  with  all  key  stakeholders  in  the  province.  In  addition,  the  cluster \napproach with regular dialogue will continue to ensure that the reforms stay broadly on track. \n\n  Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\nKey  Issues.  Gender  inequality  continues  to  be  a  major  problem  in  Punjab.  The  literacy  rate  for  females  is  still \nsubstantially  lower  than  for  males.  Large  gender  disparities  persist  across  the  urban  and  rural  areas  but  tend  to  be \nhigher  in  rural  areas.  Limited  access  to  income-generating  opportunities\u2014together  with  a  range  of  lifecycle  risks \nrelated to malnutrition, school non-attendance, marriage and dowry, pregnancy, child birth, and widowhood\u2014have left \nwomen considerably more vulnerable to poverty than men, resulting in the increasing feminization of poverty.         \n \nKey  Actions.  ADB  has  supported  gender  reforms  in  Pakistan.  Among  the  targeted  programs  for  gender \nmainstreaming in Pakistan, ADB supported the Government of Pakistan in developing a national gender reform action \nplan  (GRAP)  under  the  Decentralization  Support  Program,  which  was  later  approved  by  the  national  assembly,  and \nprovincial GRAPs that were approved by provincial assemblies and/or cabinets. Building upon past efforts, subprogram \n2 of the PGEIP has attempted to mainstream gender reforms and support gender equity in Punjab.   \n \nAs  part  of  the  PGEIP,  the  government  has  increased  its  efforts  to  promote  gender  equity.  Two  pre-budget  seminars \nwere  conducted  to  increase  awareness  of  gender-sensitive  budgeting  in  FY2010.  Resource  allocation  for  GRAP \nimplementation  has  more  than  doubled,  from  PRs70  million  in  FY2008  to  PRs148  million  in  FY2010.  Gender \nmainstreaming units have been established in seven key departments. Gender support units have been established in \n27  districts.  As  part  of  subprogram  2,  the  gender  support  units  conducted  a  review  of  179  project  documents,  and \nthese  were  subsequently  revised  to  reflect  a  more  gender-balanced  approach.  The  annual  development  program  for \nthe health and education sectors has seen a clear focus on bridging the gap in services and infrastructure available for \nmales and females. The government prepared gendered budget statements for the districts of Rajanpur and Gujrat and \nfor the provincial government  as a  whole to  gauge  whether public investment is gender  sensitive and  balanced. The \nfindings  were  incorporated  into  the  gender  section  of  the  budget  call  circular  for  FY2010.  All  these  efforts  have \ncontributed to gender-sensitive budgeting and planning.  \n \nThe  government  has  established  the  Directorate  of  Women\u2019s  Development  to  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  GRAP \nactivities. The PGEIP supports gender-focused capacity building and the conduct of a series of workshops on gender-\nequity sensitization in Punjab. Over time, gender equity will be a regular training topic in the curriculum of MPDD.   \n\nThe  livestock  and  dairy  sector  contributes  around  11%  of  provincial  gross  domestic  product  and  employs  30  million \npeople, largely in rural Pakistan. More importantly, over 90% of fresh milk consumed in Pakistan is from smallholder \ndomestic production, which is managed mainly by women. Budget allocation for livestock and dairy more than doubled \nto  PRs1,640  million  in  FY2010  from  PRs806  million  in  FY2009.  The  initiatives  will  specifically  augment  the  earning \npower of women and facilitate their empowerment in general.   \n \nIn  addition  to  this  direct  assistance  on  gender  equity,  the  PGEIP  will  support  gender  equity  though  increased  fiscal \nspace  and  fiscal  discipline.  The  civil  service  reforms  will  improve  service  delivery  and  make  government  more \nresponsive  to  citizen\u2019s  needs,  especially  women  and  other  disadvantaged  groups.  The  PGEIP  is  introducing \nbenchmarking  and  in-depth  functional  review,  business  process  reengineering,  and  human  resource  management \nreforms  in  L&DD,  which  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  woman's  earning  power.  The  bridging  of  underfunding  in  the \nhealth sector will benefit women and children's health. PGEIP reforms, coupled with government interventions for pro-\npoor expenditure and gender mainstreaming, will improve expenditure efficiency and sustain funding for social services \nthat will particularly benefit women and other vulnerable groups. \n\n2.
