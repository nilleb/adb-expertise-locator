THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to Armenia for the Infrastructure Sustainability Support Program.1 The report \nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Management Capacity in \nthe Road and Water Sectors, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.2 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will partner with the Government of Armenia to \nimprove  road  and  water  service  provision  through  results-based  public  management  and \nfinancing reforms. By focusing on critical expenditures, sustainability, and life cycle costing, \ninvestments in the two sectors will become financially more viable. The risks will be more \nequitably shared when investments are made through public\u2013private partnerships. Users of the \nroads and drinking water supply will benefit from  enhanced and sustainable services, and \ntaxpayers will get better value for money and greater benefits from their taxes. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Economic growth facilitated by improved infrastructure is a government development \npriority.3 Infrastructure  assets  are  deteriorating  fast  in  Armenia,  and  resources  for  their \nrehabilitation or replacement are limited, as confirmed during the program design phase.4 The \nroad and water sectors are particularly important, given their impact on the economy and quality \nof life. Under-provision or poor provision of roads limits people\u2019s access to markets, health, and \neducation  facilities.  Better  maintained  road  networks  around  economic  hubs  can  improve \naccess and create opportunities for economic integration for those in peri-urban and rural areas. \nReliable access to clean water is an important factor for household well-being. \n \n4.  Armenia is a landlocked, mountainous country with an extensive road network that is \nunderfunded and of poor quality. Frequent seismic activity and sharp seasonal temperature \nvariations adversely affect road conditions, construction, and maintenance. The country has \nabout 7,700 kilometers of republic, interstate, and local roads. About 3,500 kilometers of the \nnetwork are managed by the central government, while the maintenance of the rest is delegated \nto the severely resource-constrained marzes and local communities.5  There is inadequate \ninformation to make sound sector and investment decisions for more than half of the republic \nroads.  Available  qualitative  information  about  roads  managed  by  local  communities  is \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   As per ADB's project classification system, the program will target the following sectors, in addition to public \nmanagement: (i) transport and (ii) water and other urban infrastructure and services. Under the transport sector, \nroad transport (non-urban), urban roads, and transport policies and institutional development are the subsectors \nthat will be addressed. Under the water sector, urban policy, institutional and capacity development, and the urban \nwater supply are the subsectors that will be targeted. This classification has been reflected in the Program at a \nGlance page. For brevity and clarity in this report, the \"road sector\" and \"water sector\" will be used in reference to \nthese subsectors. \n3   Government of Armenia. 2008.

In  the  absence  of  data,  it  is  difficult  to  monitor  how  efficiently  the  roads  are \nmaintained by public and private service providers. \n \n5.  Armenia\u2019s  road  asset  ownership,  management,  and  regulatory  structures  are \nsegmented. The country has more than 500 national, regional, and local road managers with \ndifferent levels of expertise and capacity. This creates operational and management issues, \nundermines economies of scale, and limits value optimization in sector investments. The central \nbudget allocation for capital expenditure on roads, funded mainly by international development \nassistance, cannot meet the demand. The distortion between capital expenditures and the \noperating budget is also increasing. Sector analyses indicate about 1% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) is required to maintain the road network in its current condition, but only about \n0.25% of GDP ($25 million a year) is budgeted for operation and maintenance. ADB, the \nEuropean Investment Bank, and the World Bank have invested more than $500 million in the \nroad sector since 2000.6 However, the road maintenance budget allocations declined because \nof post-2009 fiscal constraints, the block allocations for new road construction, and financial \nmanagement and procurement shortfalls. Four key issues need to be addressed to improve \nroad sector effectiveness\u2014insufficient technical information, fragmented sector management, \nlack of a sector regulator, and inadequate funding to achieve sustainable service delivery. \n \n6.  After Armenia became independent in 1991, most of its water and wastewater systems \nwere in poor condition because of limited financial and management capacity. Technical and \ncommercial water losses exceeded 85%; most households received less than 5 hours of water \na day. Since 2000 the government has restructured the water sector, awarding lease and \nmanagement  contracts  to  private  water  operators.  Substantial  investments,  supported  by \ndevelopment agencies, have been made to improve the system. Despite improvements in the \nduration and quality of water for two-thirds of the population on the main grid, key challenges \nremain. About 560 communities in rural and peri-urban areas are not connected to the grid. \nInitial assessments indicate that about half of the existing network needs renovation, and 40,000 \nrural inhabitants do not have access to piped water supply. In 2008, the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated that about $100 million in water \nand sanitation investments are needed for rural areas.7 The capital investment needs for the \nmain water supply grid for the next 5 years are estimated at about $279 million, or 2.8% of GDP.  \n \n7.  The Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC) regulates the water sector. All \npublic and private owners of water assets are subject to the same regulatory regime under \nPSRC. Five private operators manage the drinking water supply on behalf of the government \nthrough lease or management contracts. The State Committee on Water Economy (SCWE), \npart of the Ministry of Territorial Administration (MTA), carries out the policy, strategy, and \nstandards  functions.  However,  the  regulatory  activities  of  PSRC  and  SCWE  are  not  fully \ndelineated.  The  separation  of  policy  from  operational  management  and  regulation,  while \ncredible, does not address operational and financial inefficiencies. Water sector management is \nhampered by (i) the lack of a consolidated, complete, and current asset database to inform \ninvestment decisions, and (ii) weak government engagement with the private operators that \nmanage water assets. Financial support to the water sector is not explicitly stated in the budget \nbecause financial reporting practices in the sector are irregular or incomplete. The sector is \nmarked by weak public and financial management systems. The water sector needs (i) a \n                                                \n6  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7   OECD and Environmental Action Programme Task Force. 2008.

The government, in collaboration with ADB, the European Union, German development \ncooperation through KfW, OECD, and the World Bank, is rigorously reviewing the water sector \nto guide the reforms planned for 2016 onward. Areas for early attention include (i) streamlined \ninstitutional framework for policy, regulation, asset management, service delivery, and dispute \nresolution functions; (ii) sector-wide strategies for tariffs, metering, nonrevenue water, and asset \nmanagement and maintenance; and (iii) system and capacity enhancements for more efficient \nplanning, budgeting, procurement, contract management, and allocative efficiency.  \n \n9.  The government has been working with development agencies and the private sector to \nimprove  road  and  water  supply  infrastructure,  but  competent  capital  investment  and \nmaintenance needs far exceed the resources available. In addition, the current systems can \nbenefit from significant efficiency enhancements to receive better value from expenditures. Both \nsectors  are  acutely  underfunded,  and  the  government\u2019s  long-term  planning  and  sector \nmanagement capacity is limited. Improved sector management and service delivery in road and \nwater supply requires (i) integrated sector management informed by sound asset management; \n(ii) effective financial management and additional financing options; and (iii) aligned department \nand agency responsibilities, functions, and accountabilities to help achieve targets in each \nsector. These findings echo the lessons from ADB\u2019s ongoing initiatives in the road and water \nsectors, the country programming, and other development partners\u2019 experiences in Armenia. \n \n10.  The  program  will  support  the  government\u2019s  development  agenda  on  sustainable \ninfrastructure provision as articulated in the Armenia Development Strategy 2014\u20132025; the \nMedium-Term Expenditure Framework, 2014\u20132016; and the Republic of Armenia Government \nProgram.8 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020; the Water Operational \nPlan, 2011\u20132020; the Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan; and the development \npriorities  identified  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016.9 The  program  will \nintroduce a cross-sector approach, where sector and finance ministries collaborate at all four \nlevels of results-based management\u2014planning, budgeting, implementation, and monitoring. To \nsupport the reforms, ADB will partner with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for optimal resource \nmobilization,  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communication  (MOTC)  for  the  national  road \nnetwork, MTA for regional coordination, and PSRC and SCWE for drinking water supply. These \nimplementing agencies will undertake the institutional and policy reforms detailed in the design \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n11.  The core development challenge has been the limited impact that sector investments, \ndelivered  through  the  sector  agencies,  have  had  on  Armenia\u2019s  road  and  water  sector \nsustainability. Finance, water, road, and regulatory agencies will be equally engaged in this \nprogram\u2019s  results.

The program will provide a more \nintegrated approach and an opportunity to undertake deeper, more sustainable reforms in the \ntwo sectors. The policy matrix in Appendix 4 sets forth the preconditions for the release of two \ntranches under the loan. The program was designed in close coordination with the development \npartners that support Armenia\u2019s road, water, and public management sectors, including the \nEuropean  Union,  German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nInternationale  Zusammenarbeit  and  KfW,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, and the World Bank to optimize synergies and avoid duplication.10 The program \nteam\u2019s findings were regularly shared with civil society, service user organizations, public and \nprivate service providers, academia, and development partners during the design phase through \nworkshops,  seminars,  and  bilateral  meetings.  These  stakeholders  were  then  consulted \nspecifically on the importance, relevance, and achievability of the proposed reforms, and their \nfeedback was incorporated in the program design. This participatory approach will continue \nduring loan implementation to ensure program results are achieved as Armenia\u2019s development \nneeds evolve.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be improved service delivery in the road transport and water supply \nsectors. The outcome will be results-based management systems implemented in the road \ntransport and water supply sectors.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  Output 1: Sector management systems improved. The segmented sector structure is \na common binding constraint for the two sectors. To enable informed and efficient management \nof the road sector, the program will support the government in establishing a road council (an \nMOTC-led,  multi-agency  advisory  body  for  coordination  of  road  maintenance  policies  and \ninvestment  decisions  across  the  country).  The  road  council  will  comprise  management \nrepresentatives  from  the  ministries  of  economy,  finance,  nature  protection,  territorial \nadministration (which coordinates regional infrastructure), and other ministries and agencies as \nrequired. MTA will lead a multi-agency working group, which will review the roles of key water \nsector agencies to align their responsibilities and functions more effectively. Results of this \nreview will inform the preparation of Armenia\u2019s next water sector strategy with a financing plan. \nThe Water Code 2002 and related legal acts will be aligned with the new water sector strategy \nto provide the required legal guidance for the developing sector. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Strategies  and  processes  to  allocate  investments  more  efficiently \ndeveloped.  The  government  will  adopt  a  financing  strategy  for  road  maintenance  and \nimplement it from 2015 onwards through a participatory process. The road council will, as part \nof its coordinating function, validate road maintenance expenditures, which will be developed \nbased  on  road  asset  management  principles.  Quantitative  and  qualitative  performance \nindicators will be included in the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), 2015\u20132017 for \nboth the road and water sectors to institutionalize  results monitoring. To improve financial \nplanning, transparency,  and  accountability  in  the  water  sector,  the government  will  (i) fully \nexercise its shareholder role by requiring transparent and complete financial reports from water \n                                                \n10  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  5 \nsector operators and by using this information for financial planning, and (ii) explicitly state the \namounts and objectives of water sector subsidies in budget publications. \n \n15.  Output 3: Regulatory frameworks improved. Sector development targets may be met \nmore  consistently  in  the  long  run  if  the  sector  is  regulated  according  to  clearly  defined \nstandards. To improve service standards and better safeguard user rights, MOTC\u2019s regulatory \nmandate will be defined for Armenia\u2019s entire road network, including state, republic, and local \nroads. MOTC will establish a regulatory department to carry out this mandate. Furthermore, \nMOTC will adopt a streamlined system to receive feedback from users and redress grievances. \nIt will be implemented by the regulatory department. PSRC, which regulates the water sector, \nwill adopt a similar system to address water user concerns and service delivery failures. \n \n16.  Output 4: Monitoring systems strengthened. Regulatory systems are only as good as \nthe results they generate, which should be monitored through complete, verifiable, up-to-date \ninformation systems on assets and financial positions. A geo-referenced video inventory of the \ncountry\u2019s road network will be completed during the program period. For better informed policy \nand investment decision making, international roughness index of all roads will be monitored \nannually. To improve oversight of drinking water supply assets, SCWE will implement an asset \nmanagement system and improve information sharing between the public and private agencies. \nThe internal audit capacity within the key counterpart agencies will be developed to support \nbetter links between budget and audit, as well as between audit reports and policy decisions. \nRegularly updated performance data will better inform policy and financial decisions; they will be \nshared with key stakeholders in a timely manner to keep beneficiaries engaged in ensuring \nservice quality. MOTC, PSRC, and SCWE will develop and implement public information plans \nto increase accountability, improve customer service, and enable better informed and broader-\nbased public engagement with the service providers.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n17.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR \n31,770,000 ($49,000,000 equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the \nprogram.11 The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the \nfull exchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. \n \n18.  The loan will be released in two tranches, subject to compliance with the agreed-upon \ntranche release conditions in Appendix 4. The first tranche in the amount of SDR12,967,000 \n($20 million equivalent) will be released upon loan effectiveness; the second tranche in the \namount of SDR 18,803,000 ($29 million equivalent) is expected to be released in the third \nquarter of 2015. The loan size and tranche amounts are justified by (i) the nature and sequence \nof reforms that are required; (ii) cost of implementing these reforms; (iii)  the government\u2019s \nresources for development expenditure and financing needs (Table 1); and (iv) the time required \nto undertake the reforms.  \n \n19.  The 2009 economic crisis and the countercyclical fiscal package increased the financing \n                                                \n11  The government\u2019s Development Policy Letter is in Appendix 3. \n ", "6   \ngap. The public debt-to-GDP ratio jumped from 16.4% in 2008 to 43.6% in 2013.12 Public debt \nservice is projected to continue its upward trend. The government\u2019s fiscal consolidation process, \ninitiated after the economic recovery of 2010\u20132011, reduced the budget deficit from 7.6% of \nGDP in 2009 to 1.5% in 2012 and 0.4% in 2013. A new package of tax amendments for excise, \nincome, and mining taxes was approved in 2012. The package aims to increase revenues, thus \nenabling higher public expenditures for development. The planned budget deficit for 2014 is \n2.3% of GDP, and is projected to be 2.0% of GDP in 2015.13 The government expects to reduce \nthe budget deficit despite the 8% rise in public spending, largely because of higher public sector \nsalaries and pensions envisaged in 2014.14 \n \nTable 1: State Budget Financing Gap for 2013, 2014 (Planned), 2015 (Projected)  \nAmount ($ million)   Share of GDP (%) \nItem  2013   2014  2015  2013  2014  2015 \n1.

The loan, with 15-year maturity and an \ninterest rate 300 basis points above the London interbank offered rate, was provided by the Russian Federation. \nSources: 2014 State Budget Law; Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, 2014\u20132016; National Statistical Service; \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). 2013. IMF Country Report 13/238. \n \n20.  The government\u2019s overall financing needs (excluding domestic debt) in 2014 are $461.3 \nmillion and are projected to be $434.3 million for 2015. The largest development expenditure \nitem is social protection at 6.9% of GDP in 2013, 7.7% in 2014, and 7.6% in 2015. Expenditure \non transport, road network, and communication and on housing and public utilities constituted \n2.6%  of  GDP  in  2013  and  is  planned  to  be  1.9%  in  2014  and  2.1%  in  2015  (Table  1). \nExpenditure  on  water  was  about  0.5%  of  GDP  for  2013,  a  level  that  is  expected  to  be \nmaintained in 2014.15 Expenditure for transport, road network, and communication was about \n1.4% of GDP in 2013 and is expected to be about 1.5% of GDP in 2014. The current annual \nlevel of financing for the public road network is $62 million\u2013$68 million (0.62%\u20130.68% of GDP). \n                                                \n12  Source: National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia. \n13  Government of Armenia. 2013. Medium-term Expenditure Framework 2014-2016. Armenia. The government\u2019s \naccess to domestic and international financial markets is limited. It has raised $700 million from eurobonds, $440 \nmillion of which were allocated to repay a Russian Federation loan of $500 million. Armenia graduated from the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s concessional funding in March 2013; its graduation from the World Bank list is \nunder discussion. This will increase the cost of funds and strain the fiscal space for infrastructure. \n14  Source: 2014 State Budget Law. http://www.minfin.am \n15  It is envisaged at 0.4% of GDP per annum for the Armenia Development Strategy implementation period from \n2013 to 2025. \n ", "  7 \nThis includes financing for rehabilitation, which is considered periodic road maintenance, but \nexcludes road improvement, reconstruction, and new construction works such as the North\u2013\nSouth Road Corridor Project. Improvements in policy and operational systems are expected to \ncreate fiscal space, reduce the financing gap with prudent financial management, and improve \nthe value-for-money of road investments through better prioritization and monitoring of results. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  MOF is the executing agency. The implementing agencies are the MOF, MOTC, MTA, \nPSRC, and SCWE with the responsibilities described in para. 10 and the program design and \nmonitoring framework in Appendix 1. A steering committee, chaired by the executive director of \nthe  Foreign  Financing  Project  Management  Center  in  MOF  and  comprising  working-level \nimplementing  agency  representatives,  will  oversee  day-to-day  implementation  of  program \nactivities. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to Armenia as the borrower in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans.16 The program implementation period is from November 2013 to September 2015. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n22.  The Capacity Development TA for Strengthening Sector Management Capacity in Road \nand Water Sectors will be attached to the loan to support the government in effective and timely \nimplementation of tranche 2 policy actions. The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which \n$900,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nother sources). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office, \nadministrative and logistics support, interpretation, and other in-kind contributions. It will be \nimplemented from TA effectiveness, expected to be in November 2014, to September 2015. \nMOF will be the executing agency and ADB will oversee implementation.17 \n \n23.  The TA outputs will include (i) a consolidated drinking water supply sector strategy with a \nfinancing plan for Armenia; (ii) draft amendments to align relevant legislation with the drinking \nwater supply sector strategy; and (iii) a financing strategy for road maintenance. The TA will \nalso provide training and technical advice to MOF, MOTC, SCWE, and PSRC to (i) implement \nresults-based  budgeting  in  water  and  roads,  including  development  and  analysis  of  key \nperformance indicators (KPIs); (ii) disseminate and implement the public information plans for \nroad and water users; (iii) develop and manage the water asset register; and (iv) prepare risk-\nbased audit plans and conduct performance audits in the two sectors. \n \n24.  The TA will require 16 person-months of international and 34 person-months of national \nconsulting services through short-term and co-sourcing arrangements.18 The government has \nwelcomed co-sourcing as it will allow for on-site and longer-term engagement of experts for \nknowledge and skills transfer rather than capacity substitution by consultants, as has been the \ncase to date. The team of international and national consultants will consist of (i) public financial \nmanagement specialists, (ii) road transport and water supply economists, (iii) a public utilities \nregulatory affairs specialist, (iv) water sector engineers, (v) road engineers, (vi) a data and \nsystems management specialist, (vii) internal audit specialists, and (viii) a legal expert. The \n                                                \n16  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n17  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Co-sourcing involves combining services from within and outside a business to achieve the same goal. In this case, \nit refers to technical experts working with experts in counterpart agencies to deliver certain outputs and expedite \nthe capacity transfer process. \n ", "8   \ninternal audit specialists will be recruited through an audit firm. International consultants will be \nrecruited through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 \nand simplified technical proposals. National consultants will be engaged individually since the \nrequired  qualifications  are  diverse  and  difficult  to  source  from  one  consulting  firm.  The \nconsultants will prepare regular progress reports, and TA deliverables will be made available in \nArmenian and English. All consultants and resource persons will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \ndisbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  Public financial management and economic analysis of Armenia have been conducted \nas part of the loan design background work and the upcoming country partnership strategy. The \nidentified gaps have been incorporated into the program design, including the importance of \nprudent financial management as well as adequate resources for a sustainable road network.  \n \n26.  Water sector financial assessments indicated that water and trading losses are high, and \ntariffs fall short of full cost recovery. Water operators receive 21% of their annual income as \nexplicit and implicit subsidies from the government and bilateral assistance to Armenia from \nFrance and Germany. The financial losses accumulated until 2013 were about $75 million, or \n0.75%  of  GDP.  Greater  transparency  in  public  subsidies,  tariff  calculation,  technical  and \nfinancial losses, and the overall financial situation of the water sector is expected to increase the \nincentives  for  water  companies  to  reduce  water  losses.  This  can  reduce  the  size  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s annual (explicit and implicit) subsidy to the sector\u2014estimated at 0.1% of GDP\u2014\nand  free  resources  for  regular  maintenance,  repair,  and  upgrading  of  infrastructure,  thus \nimproving service provision to the population.19 The introduction of a consolidated water assets \nregister will increase the information available for investment planning. \n \n27.  Improved qualitative and quantitative KPIs for the road and water sectors in the budget \nprocess are expected to result in more efficient budget allocations. The KPIs have been linked \nwith  the  planning  and  budgeting  processes  during  the  program  preparatory  phase,  as \ndemonstrated in the MTEF, 2014\u201316 and the 2014 Budget Law. The link between the KPIs and \nthe implementation and monitoring processes will be further strengthened during the program \nperiod. Risk-based performance audits and better qualified auditors will improve the quality of \naudits. The appointment of independent non-executive members to the MOTC and SCWE audit \ncommittees (including from civil society organizations) will further strengthen the internal audit \nsystem. \n \nB.  Governance \n28.  The  legal  and regulatory  framework for  public financial management  is  developing. \nManagement of treasury operations has improved, with almost all government expenditures \ngoing through a single account. Armenia has adopted the Law on Internal Audit based on \ninternational good practice, and the establishment of internal audit departments and committees \n                                                \n19  Yerevan Djur is using its own resources to finance 40% of the regular maintenance, repair, and upgrading of \nwater infrastructure, while the other utilities are heavily dependent on development partner financing. \n ", "  9 \nin sector agencies is under way. Program budgeting reforms are ongoing. The Budget System \nLaw  was adopted, with a coding system for program-based budget classifications. Budget \nreporting  remains  largely  input-oriented.  The  Law  on  Internal  Audit  has  not  been  fully \nimplemented because of weak capacity in the Ministry of Finance and in the internal audit units. \nA weak internal control environment can lead to fiduciary risks. The program will help build \nplanning,  budgeting,  performance,  and  financial  monitoring  capacity  in  the  two  sectors  to \nstrengthen the public financial management and internal control environment. \n \n29.  Armenia has improved the legal and institutional frameworks for public procurement. The \nProcurement Law went into effect on 1 January 2005, leading to the introduction of procurement \nprocedures. The Road Map for Finalizing e-Procurement Reform in the Republic of Armenia, \n2013\u20132015 was adopted, and a procurement support center was established in 2013 to review \nprocurement processes and provide procurement training and advice. However, the center\u2019s \ncapacity is limited. The transparency of procurement has improved since 2011 with tender and \nprocurement  announcements  made  through  media  outlets  and  the  internet,  and  the \nengagement of the procurement appeals council. The oversight of contracting arrangements in \nroad and water supply sectors need to be restructured and strengthened to align the incentives \nof the government and contractors. The program will help upgrade procurement outcomes by \nimproving contract oversight.  \n \n30.  The  government\u2019s  efforts  to  fight  corruption  have  had  limited  success.  The  Anti-\nCorruption Monitoring Commission, set up in 2009, oversaw the implementation of the Anti-\nCorruption Strategy and Action Plan, 2009\u20132012. The Anti-Corruption Council is responsible for \napproving  anticorruption  policies  and  coordinating  related  activities.  However,  it  has  not \nproduced  a  report  since  2011.  The  program  will  help  strengthen  transparency  in  public \nexpenditure. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and MOF.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The program is expected to have a positive indirect impact on the poor and nonpoor as it \nwill strengthen the efficiency, predictability, and transparency of public resource allocations and \nuse  in the road  and  water  sectors.  Efficiency gains from  better resource  and  expenditure \nmanagement in these sectors will improve the quality, coverage, and delivery of public services. \nBetter-maintained  road  networks  will  increase  access  and  create  more  opportunities  for \neconomic and social integration. A better managed and regulated water network will broaden \nthe beneficiary base and improve service quality. Sector-specific, time-bound public information \nplans and diligently implemented grievance redress mechanisms will better inform and empower \nroad and water users. Program characteristics are not amenable to gender design. No adverse \nimpact on poor and vulnerable groups from the policy reforms is envisaged under the program.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n32.  The program supports policy reforms and institutional and capacity strengthening in road \nand water sector management. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \nthe  program  is  classified  under  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail \n ", "10   \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nprogram are expected to outweigh the costs with the existing mitigating measures. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Major Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDifferent levels of capacity in MOTC, SCWE, MTA,  TA  is  attached  to  the  program  to  build  capacity  and \nand MOF to implement budget processes may delay  improve  budgetary  and  management  skills  in  these \nadoption  of  results-based  management  in  the  agencies. \ntransport and water supply sectors. \nLack of consensus on reforms might delay program  Stakeholders,  including  professional  and  advocacy \nimplementation.  groups,  service  providers,  and  users  were  consulted \nduring  program  design.
