I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Thailand for the Capital Market Development Program (CMDP). The report \nalso  describes  proposed  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Phase III, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The CMDP will support the government\u2019s key reform priorities aimed at higher and \nsustainable investment growth and transformation to a higher income economy, sustained by an \nincreased contribution of the domestic capital market. The reform priorities under the CMDP \ninclude  efforts  to  enhance  financial  sector  stability  through  better  coordination  between \nregulatory oversight agencies and measures to enhance transparency. The CMDP aims to \nincrease  capital  market  efficiency  and  depth  through  strengthening  the  capital  market \ninfrastructure (demutualization of the stock exchange), promoting competition in the securities \nmarket, developing the domestic bond market, and financial product development. The CMDP \nalso aims to expand the investor base and support Thailand\u2019s efforts to integrate with regional \ncapital markets. The development policy letter is in Appendix 3 and the policy matrix with the \nmedium-term direction is in Appendix 4. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM   \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  challenge  for  Thailand  is  to  transform  from  a  middle-income  to a  high-income \neconomy. This requires significant investments in productive activities, including infrastructure, \nas well as education and other social sectors. The 1997 crisis shows that absence of balanced \ngrowth of financial sector increases vulnerability to economic instability and this can result in a \nsignificant increase in poverty. The government recognizes these challenges and considers a \nwell-developed capital market central to achieving longer-term economic transformation. The \nThai capital market is underperforming on key indicators compared to its peers in the region.1 \nThe financial system remains highly regulated, fee structures are fixed in many areas, and \nmarket participants are subject to closely monitored rules-based supervision in both debt and \nequity markets. Capital flows are moderately restricted and the product choice for investors \nremains limited. The inclusiveness of the poorest 20% households is limited. Savings rates \naverage about 3% for low income households and only about 8% of low income households \nhave financial assets greater than $1,500. The government recognizes that, by addressing \nthese structural and regulatory impediments and developing the domestic capital market and its \nintegration with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) markets, Thailand can \nexpand sources of financing for the public and private sectors, improve inclusiveness, enhance \nthe stability of the financial sector, and deepen its integration with the global economy. \n \n4.  The global financial crisis and its adverse impact on the Thai economy in 2009 exposed \nsignificant  weaknesses  in  its  domestic  financial  system,  including  insufficient  depth  of  the \ndomestic capital market to finance public and private sector investments. Countries with well-\nfunctioning and liquid local bond markets were better able to cope with shocks to the global \ncredit markets. Key lessons from the crisis include the importance of strong coordination among \nfinancial sector regulators and sharing of information to detect systemic risks to the financial \nsystem  and  enforce  financial  regulations.  The  crisis  provided  additional  momentum  to  the \ngovernment and stakeholders to agree on the way forward for capital market development. \n                                                 \n1 Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance Sector Assessment (Appendix 2). \n ", "2   \n5.  The Government\u2019s Capital Market Development Master Plan, 2009\u20132013 is the anchor \nfor  the  CMDP.  Development  of  the  master  plan  was  initiated  in  2006  under  the  previous \nGovernment and it was formulated with private sector participation through representatives on \nthe Capital Market Development Working Committee (CMDWC), demonstrating widespread \nstakeholder support across the political spectrum. This broad-based support was necessary to \nensure the long-term sustainability of the reforms. A subcommittee under the CMDWC was \nestablished in late 2009, tasked with overseeing, monitoring, and implementing the master plan \nunder the coordination of the Fiscal Policy Office at the Ministry of Finance (MOF).   \n \n6.  The master plan embraces all relevant dimensions of capital markets, including the \nequity market, bond market, derivatives market (including commodities), and money market. It \nconsists of eight key policy components, each time-bounded: (i) abolishing the monopoly and \nimproving  the  competitiveness  of  the  Thai  stock  exchange,  (ii)  liberalizing  the  securities \nbusiness to promote market efficiency, (iii) legal reform, (iv) streamlining the tax system related \nto financial products, (v) developing financial products including those that help mitigate risk \nsuch as interest rate derivatives, (vi) establishing a national savings fund, (vii) developing a \nculture  of  investment  and  savings,  and  (viii)  developing  the  domestic  bond  market. \nImplementation  is  under  way  and  early  successes  include  the  government\u2019s  approval  of \nproposed legislation for demutualization of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET).  \n \n7.  The CMDP is anchored to the master plan in four ways. First, it is a single tranche \noperation covering the reform period (1 October 2007\u201330 March 2010) that lays the foundations \nfor  longer-term  development  of  the  capital  market.  It  also  covers  the  first  months  of \nimplementation of the capital market master plan. Second, although the CMDP is a single \ntranche  operation,  it  is  linked  to  a  medium-term  framework  through  the  Post-Program \nPartnership Framework (P3F) covering the next 21 months of implementation of the capital \nmarket  master  plan\u2014signaling  a  commitment  from  both  the  government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to continue policy dialogue and support for capital market reforms. \nThird, ADB has actively collaborated with the government on capital market reform since 2006, \nincluding carrying out diagnostic studies on the capital market, providing input to formulation of \nthe capital market master plan, policy recommendations on legislative and regulatory reforms, \nSET demutualization, and support for reform implementation.2 The master plan is one of the \nprincipal outcomes of these TA projects. Fourth, TA associated with the CMDP is proposed to \nsupport the government in implementing critical follow-up policy measures under the P3F and \nthe master plan (para. 27).  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the CMDP is an expanded, diversified, stable and inclusive capital market \nleading to increased domestic financing of investment. By 2015, the CMDP is expected to have \nincreased the size, depth, and liquidity of Thailand\u2019s capital market\u2014increasing the contribution \nof the capital market to domestic financing. This will be done through more robust competition in \ndomestic capital markets, world class capital market infrastructure, better coordination among \nregulatory oversight agencies, and financial product and services innovation. By 2015, the \nCMDP  is  expected  to  have  increased  poor  households\u2019 participation  in  the  finance  sector \ndevelopment process through increased savings and holdings of financial assets. This will be \ndone  through  product  development,  expanding  coverage  of  pensions,  development  of  the \nsecondary mortgage market supplemented with public education programs on financial literacy.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Thailand for Supporting the Implementation of the Capital \nMarket Development Master Plan. Manila; and ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Thailand for \nCapital Market Development Phase II. Manila.  \n ", "  3\n9.  The outcome of the CMDP will be an improved and prudentially sound capital market \nwhere  market  participants  operate  efficiently  and  innovatively.  This  will  be  reflected  in  a \nstrengthened policy, regulatory, and agency coordination framework.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The CMDP supports the government efforts in four core reform areas: (i) strengthened \nregulatory  coordination  and  enhanced  investor  protection;  (ii)  increased  market  efficiency, \nliquidity,  and  transparency;  (iii)  strengthened  market  infrastructure  and  intermediaries;  and \n(iv) new products and an expanded investor base through enhanced education and improved \nrisk management. \n \n1.  Output 1: Strengthened Regulatory Coordination and Enhanced Investor \nProtection \n \n11.  The CMDP supports the government\u2019s agenda to improve the regulatory framework for \nthe capital markets and to provide better coordination among the key regulatory oversight \nagencies. The main objective is to ensure financial sector stability. The following measures \ntoward  achieving  these  goals  were  accomplished  before  the  Board\u2019s  consideration  of  the \nCMDP. \n \n12.  Development  of  the Capital  Market  Development  Master  Plan. The government \ndeveloped and on 9 November 2009 approved its medium-term Capital Market Development \nMaster Plan, 2009\u20132013. ADB provided input to the formulation of the master plan through TA \n(footnote 2). The plan covers eight critical reform areas, many of which the CMDP supports. To \nmonitor implementation of the master plan, a subcommittee for implementing and monitoring \nwas created at the end of 2009. It has met three times and is facilitating the implementation of \nkey reforms. Its first success was to facilitate cabinet approval of draft legislation covering \ndemutualization of the SET, which includes measures to inject competition in this sector. The \nCMDWC is responsible for coordinating among the key regulators. Over the medium term, it is \nto become a formal body responsible for coordinating issues on financial system stability. \n \n13.  Enhancing the surveillance and enforcement capabilities of the Securities and \nExchange Commission. In 2008, amendments were made to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission  (SEC)  legislation  to  enhance  the  SEC\u2019s  operational  effectiveness.  Key \namendments  include  (i)  revised  criteria  for  selecting  the  SEC  board  and  setting  up  a \nmanagement board to concentrate on the issuance of rules and regulations governing day-to-\nday operations; (ii) cooperation between the SEC and foreign regulators regarding information \ndisclosure and the suppression of cross-border securities fraud\u2014to allow the SEC to sign the \nInternational  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  multilateral  memorandum  of \nunderstanding and to become a fully compliant A signatory; and (iii) enhanced protection of the \nrights of minority shareholders of publicly listed companies. Over the medium term and by 2012, \nthe SEC proposes to submit legislation to Parliament to use civil laws and penalties as well as \nadministrative sanctions in enforcement actions and to provide legal immunity for the SEC and \nits commissioners in performing their official duties.  \n \n14.  Deposit insurance. The government introduced measures to strengthen the stability of \nthe financial system. Deposit insurance was a key measure, achieved through the enactment of \nthe Deposit Protection Agency Act in February 2008 and the establishment of the Deposit \nProtection Agency (DPA) in August 2008. This reform was timely as it was critical to mitigating \nthe risks of the financial crisis that intensified in September 2008. The blanket guarantee on \nbank  deposits  was  extended  to  2011,  aligned  with  the  phase-in  of  the  deposit  insurance \n ", "4   \nscheme. The new scheme, which came into effect in August 2008, will be phased in over 5 \nyears. The deposit insurance ceiling will be phased down from the blanket guarantee to B1 \nmillion. The DPA will collect a premium to fund the deposit insurance and the government \nfunded the initial capital of B1 billion. The DPA will act as liquidator in case of failed and closed \nfinancial institutions.  \n \n2.  Output 2: Increased Market Efficiency, Liquidity, and Transparency \n \n15.  The CMDP supports the government\u2019s agenda to liberalize the domestic capital markets \nto  improve  efficiency,  as  well  as  efforts  to  increase  liquidity  through  development  of  the \ndomestic  bond  market.  The  following  measures  toward  achieving  these  goals  were \naccomplished before the Board\u2019s consideration of the CMDP.  \n \n16.  Domestic bond market. The government introduced a series of measures to develop \nthe domestic bond market, create deeper government benchmark yields to price corporate \nsecurities, and improve transparency. The amended Public Debt Management Act, November \n2007 enabled the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO) to undertake debt market activity for \nbond market development; prior to the amendments, the PDMO was only permitted to issue \ndebt to finance the national government deficit set within prudential debt limits. In March 2010, \nthe  government  established  the  Bond  Market  Development  Fund  (BMDF)  and  issued  the \noperational criteria of the BMDF and investment strategy to deal with issuance of government \nbonds generating surplus cash. The BMDF is separate to, but will be overseen by, the PDMO. \nThis  will  enable  the  PDMO  to  adopt  cash  management  systems  to  permit  prefunding  of \ngovernment bond maturities to reduce the refinancing risk\u2014the first step toward more active \npublic debt management. As part of this strategy, the government issued B80 billion savings \nbonds of 5-year maturity targeted at retail customers in July 2009. \n \n17.  Capital controls. The government recognizes the need to relax restrictions on capital \nflows to support deepening of the domestic capital market. Since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, \nThailand has introduced a number of restrictions on capital, most recently in 2006. ADB TA \nassisted the BOT to undertake a review of restrictions on capital flows that have a negative \nimpact on capital market development (footnote 2). Based on the review\u2019s recommendations, \nthe  BOT  introduced  some  relaxations  on  the  capital  account  in  February  2010\u2014easing \nrestrictions on capital controls to allow Thai investment abroad and foreign exchange hedging \ntransactions.  It  plans  to  adopt  and  implement  suitable  options  during  2009\u20132012  that  will \naddress  exchange  control  issues  impeding  capital  market  development.  The  government\u2019s \napproach will be cautious and will involve a sequenced plan to ease restrictions on cross-border \nrestrictions and other impediments.  \n \n18.  Regional  capital  markets  integration. Thailand is actively collaborating with other \nASEAN member states in promoting capital market integration in ASEAN to develop deep and \nliquid bond markets in Asia and improve cross-border capital flows in the ASEAN region. \nThailand\u2019s  SEC  is  the  secretariat  of  the  ASEAN  Capital  Markets  Forum,  which  leads  the \nintegration drive. In April 2009, based on ADB TA, the Thai SEC coordinated and submitted a \nreport detailing recommendations on regional capital market integration to the ASEAN finance \nministers. The ASEAN Capital Markets Forum approved the Implementation Plan 2015, which \nsets out a broad framework to strengthen ASEAN capital market development and integration \nby 2015. It offers key initiatives under three broad themes: (i) creating an enabling environment \nfor regional integration, (ii) creating market infrastructure and regionally focused products and \nintermediaries, and (iii) strengthening the implementation process. The plan has six working \ngroups and the Thai SEC chairs the cross-border liberalization for products and services. The \nThai SEC presented the working group\u2019s implementation progress report at the 12th ASEAN \n ", "  5\nCapital  Markets  Forum  in  February  2010  in  Bangkok.  Thailand  has  also  completed \nharmonization of ASEAN Plus standards on disclosure requirements for cross-border equity and \nofferings, mutual recognition frameworks for market professionals, offering documents, and the \nprovision of products and services by market intermediaries.3 \n \n19.  Simplify taxes on financial transactions. One of the core components of the capital \nmarket master plan is to simplify taxes on financial transactions that impede capital market \ndevelopment. Measures accomplished under the CMDP include the following: (i) the business \ntax  on  treasury  portfolio  activities  of  financial  instruments  traded  on  exchanges  has  been \nreduced from 3.30% to 0.01%, and (ii) the Revenue Department in the MOF has set up a \nworking committee to review recommendations under ADB TA (footnote 2) for rationalizing tax \non financial instruments during implementation of the capital market master plan.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Strengthened Market Infrastructure and Intermediaries \n \n20.  The CMDP supports the government\u2019s goals of strengthening the market infrastructure \nand  increasing  intermediaries  by  liberalizing  the  sector.  Critical  reforms  include  efforts  to \ndemutualize the SET and increase competition in providing alternative trading platforms and \nliberalizing the securities market, among others. The following measures toward achieving these \ngoals were accomplished before the Board\u2019s consideration of the CMDP. \n \n21.  Stock Exchange of Thailand demutualization and competition in platforms. The \ngovernment  and  the  SET  recognize  that  the  current  structure  of  the  SET  is  increasingly \ninappropriate for a modern capital market. The government\u2019s aim is to corporatize the SET and \nto increase competition in trading venues. The government, the SET, and the SEC have agreed \nto the following sequence of reforms: (i) the SET is to initiate the demutualization process \nthrough internal reorganization; (ii) the SEC is to conduct public consultation on the main \nproposals  for  SET  demutualization;  and  (iii)  the  SEC  is  to  draft  legislation  covering \ndemutualization leading to an initial public offering of the SET\u2014allowing competing trading \nvenues, allowing competing providers of settlement infrastructure, and allowing the SET to \nprovide more open access and remote access to others who are not market intermediaries. The \nSEC  drafted  legislation  that  was  approved  by  the  cabinet  in  February  2010  and  will  be \nsubmitted to Parliament later in the year. The SET expects the corporatization to take place in \n2010 and the initial public offering in 2011. ADB TA and staff support has been provided to the \ngovernment and the SET over the policy period 2006\u20132010.4   \n \n22.  Liberalizing the securities market. The SEC has introduced measures to enhance \ncompetition in the capital market by (i) publishing a timetable for removal of the SET rule \ncontrolling brokerage commissions, and (ii) publishing its intention to remove restrictions on the \nnumber of brokerage licenses by 2012.  The SEC intends to follow through on these initiatives \nby liberalizing the brokerage commission for all investors during 2010\u20132012. The Financial \nInstitutions  Business  Act  passed  in  February  2008  allows  companies  other  than  financial \ninstitutions to provide housing finance for low- and middle-income earners. Over 2009\u20132010, \nthe  Secondary  Mortgage  Corporation  (SMC)  plans  to  develop  pass-through  models  or \nequivalent that incorporate incentives for commercial banks to develop the secondary mortgage \nmarket. Supported by ADB TA (footnote 2), strategies for improving the operational efficiency of \nthe  SMC  were  developed  under  the  CMDP,  including  new  business  models  built  on  the \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005.

The  demutualization  of  the  SET,  liberalization  of  the \nsecurities  market,  development  of  the  bond  market  and  secondary  mortgage  market  will \nimprove  access  to  finance  and  this  should  indirectly  benefit  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. \n \n4.  Output 4: New Products and Expanded Investor Base through Improved \nEducation and Improved Risk Management \n \n23.  The CMDP supports the goals of the government and industry groups of promoting \nfinancial product and service innovations and expanding the investor base. Enhancing the \nfinancial literacy of the public and better risk management of wealth are critical components of \ninnovation and longer-term poverty reduction. The following measures were accomplished or \nare ongoing prior to the Board\u2019s consideration of the CMDP. \n \n24.  Interest rate derivatives. To satisfy the Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX) on the \ndemand for interest rate derivatives and its introduction, the CMDP recognizes the importance \nof involving the customer base\u2014bank treasurers and long-term bond investors\u2014in design and \nfeasibility discussions. The BOT, in consultation with the SEC and industry groups, completed \nan assessment in February 2010 under ADB TA of the demand for interest rate and bond \nfutures. The study was coordinated with TFEX and based on its findings, interest rate and bond \nfutures are proposed to be introduced by the end of 2010. TFEX launched gold futures on \n2 February 2009. \n \n25.  Securitization of cash flows. The government proposed a draft amendment to the \nsecuritization law to Parliament in January 2010 to permit securitization of future cash flows. \nFrom July 2009 to September 2010, the SEC has been consulting with the industry to examine \nimpediments to and possible resolutions for introducing a range of new bond instruments such \nas covered bonds. The SEC approved the issuance of sukuk bonds (Islamic finance product) in \nNovember 2009. \n \n26.  Public education. The government and industry recognize the limited investor base and \nthe need for greater social inclusiveness in capital markets\u2014via individual investments as well \nas pensions. A number of activities have been carried out to improve the public\u2019s financial \nliteracy.  At  the  start  of  2009,  the  SET  reorganized  its  educational  activities  (including \nprofessional education) within a separate subsidiary, the Capital Market Development Fund, to \nprovide investor education and industry training. The Fiscal Policy Office conducted public \neducation programs in September 2009 and March 2010 to deepen understanding of how \nindividuals can meet their pension needs with public programs, and an education strategy was \nimplemented to raise awareness of the need for savings and capital market investments (both \nequity and fixed-income products) as vehicles for pension savings. \n \nD.  Post-Program Partnership Framework \n \n27.  The Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3) sets out the government\u2019s reform agenda \nfor the next 2\u20133 years, building on the reform momentum supported by ADB TA since 2006 and \nthe program. To ensure the sustained momentum of the reforms, the government and ADB \nhave agreed to a P3F for the next 30 months, creating the basis for continuous policy dialogue \nto follow through on policies required for long-term structural adjustments under the capital \nmarket master plan. The P3F focuses on 10 policy measures to be implemented in the short \nterm (April 2010\u2013March 2011) and nine policy measures to be implemented over the medium \nterm (April 2011\u2013December 2012)\u2014advancing reforms under the capital market master plan, \n ", "  7\nformalizing  regulatory  coordination,  implementing  SET  demutualization  and  competition  in \nalternative trading platforms.5  \n \nE.  Program Cost and Financing \n \n28.  The government has requested a loan of $300,000,000 to finance the CMDP from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank-offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a 15-year term, including a grace period of \n3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. The government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n29.  The  size  of  the  CMDP  loan  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors  required  to  support \nimplementation of reforms.6 The key considerations include: (i) the relative importance of the \nsector  to  the  economy,  the  weight  or  benefits  of  the  reform  program,  and  the  leverage \nnecessary to counter resistance from interest groups; (ii) the policy adjustment costs incurred by \nthe government and relevant financial statutory agencies (i.e., SEC), and financial institutions \nand  corporations  in  implementing  and  complying  with  reforms;  and  (iii)  the  development \nfinancing needs of the government. The finance sector accounts for a sizeable proportion of the \neconomy  and  its  development  and  stability  is  critical  to  support  Thailand\u2019s  economic \ntransformation, growth and poverty reduction. 7 ADB staff estimates that the complete long run \nstatic benefits of the reform program are estimated at $5.3 billion or 2.2% of GDP highlighting \nthe importance of the reform program to the economy (footnote 6). The reform program includes \nseveral politically sensitive policy and institutional reforms that have been resisted in the past, \nsuch as SET demutualization and gradual relaxation of capital controls. To support the reforms, \nthe program amount loan provides leverage to the executing agency (PDMO) and implementing \nagencies to support implementation. The policy adjustment costs to the government, statutory \nagencies and financial institutions are conservatively estimated at $51.8 million or alternatively \n$171.5 million if lost tax revenue flows from the reforms are calculated as present value lump \nsums  (footnote  6).  These  include  the  administrative,  enforcement  and  fiscal  costs  to  the \ngovernment in implementing and enforcing the reforms (estimated at least $48 million or $168 \nmillion if foregone tax revenue flows are calculated as present value lump sums). The policy \nadjustment costs to these entities are likely to be higher if the enforcement costs incurred by the \nSEC under its legislative amendments could also be quantified. The policy adjustment costs \nalso include the increased business costs borne by financial institutions and corporations from \ncomplying with the reforms (estimated at least $3.8 million). \n \n30.  The program loan also reflects the government\u2019s development financing needs. The \nGovernment  has  targeted  a  deficit  of  4.1%  of  gross  domestic  product  in  FY2011  (about          \n$11 billion\u2013$12 billion) taking into account the need to provide a modest fiscal stimulus at this \nstage of the economic recovery and to protect critical development spending. Under the FY2010 \nand FY2011 budgets, the government is close to its legislated debt limits on domestic debt \nfinancing but it has borrowing space under its limits on foreign debt financing  so it requested \nADB  and  the  World  Bank  to  finance  part  of  the  development  financing  gap.  ADB  has \ncoordinated with the World Bank support for a single tranche Development Policy Loan (DPL) to \nThailand in the amount of $1 billion for public financial management reforms. The World Bank is \n                                                 \n5 Policy Matrix and Medium-Term Direction (Appendix 4). \n6 Summary Program Impact Assessment (Appendix 2). \n7 Summary Poverty Impact Assessment (Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nexpected to support its DPL to its board of directors in mid-October 2010. ADB and World Bank \ncombined financing of the government budget amounts to $1.3 billion (or about 12 percent of \nthe budget deficit). The remaining 88% of deficit financing will be domestically sourced.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  The PDMO is the executing agency for the CMDP. The MOF, the BOT, the SEC, the \nDPA, the SMC, and the Office of Insurance Commission are the implementing agencies. The \nMOF established the CMDWC\u2014comprising representatives from its Fiscal Policy Office, the \nBOT, the SEC, the SET, and market participants\u2014to be responsible for implementing and \nsustaining the program components. The CMDP was implemented from October 2007 to March \n2010. The proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoans.8 The program will provide for the retroactive financing of eligible expenditures incurred \nup to 180 days prior to loan effectiveness. ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the withdrawal application certification.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n32.  An associated policy and advisory TA grant for Capital Market Development Phase III is \nproposed. This is the third of three TA projects for capital market development since 2006 that \nhave been designed in sequence based on progress in capital market reforms. The first TA \ncommenced in 2006 to support implementation of the capital market development plan. The \nsecond TA in 2008 (capital market development phase II) supported analytical and policy advice \non capital market reforms. The third TA will support implementation of the P3F and selected \ncomponents of the master plan. The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000 equivalent, of which \nADB will provide $900,000, to be financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nOther Sources).9  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Governance \n \n33.  Fiduciary  assessment.  Thailand\u2019s  financial  management  systems  and  the  overall \nfiduciary environment of the public financial management system are deemed to be satisfactory. \nThe  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment,  the  first  of  its  kind,  is  a \ncomprehensive diagnosis covering the overall public financial management system in Thailand \nundertaken by the World Bank in December 2008. The public financial management systems \nare underpinned by a strong legal and institutional framework. Accounting standards based on \ninternational  standards  are  applied,  and  financial  statements  are  prepared  on  a  modified \naccruals basis. Thailand\u2019s tax system is well established and efficiently run, and public debt is \nefficiently managed with prudent limits. External audit by the Office of the Auditor-General is \nwide-ranging and performed to international standards; its jurisdiction covers all elements of \ncentral government, state-owned enterprises, and all local authorities. \n \n34.  Anticorruption. The government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) and Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Thailand\u2019s anti-money laundering (AML) legislation was approved in 2003, and ongoing \nefforts are enhancing the effectiveness of its AML regime. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1998.

Poverty and Social \n \n35.  The CMDP has a positive impact on poverty reduction through the creation of direct and \nindirect benefits to poor households (footnote 7). It will contribute to sustainable reduction in \npoverty through three channels. The first channel is through supporting higher and sustained \nlonger term economic growth. By developing the domestic bond market, expanding the stock \nmarket,  relaxing  exchange  rate  controls,  and  introducing  new  financial  sector  products, \ndomestic financing of public and private investments will increase thereby supporting higher \neconomic growth. The second channel is through inclusiveness of the poor in the modern \nfinancial sector. By developing new savings products (such as the retail savings bond) and the \nnational pension scheme and expanding its coverage to the poor, the savings rate and holdings \nof  financial  assets  of  low  income  households  will  increase  over  time.10 Developing  the \nsecondary mortgage market will generate financing for lower cost housing and benefiting the \npoor. The CMDP and the government\u2019s Capital Market Master Plan includes planned activities \nand  programs  for  increasing  Thai  households\u2019  financial  literacy  and  awareness  of  savings \nproducts will complement these reforms. The third channel is through improving the regulatory \nframework for financial sector stability. The CMDP includes several measures for strengthening \nfinancial sector stability including enhancing the surveillance and enforcement capabilities of the \nSEC, establishing the deposit insurance agency, and establishing a coordination mechanism \ncomprising the key financial sector regulators to better detect systemic risks to the domestic \nfinancial sector and more effective enforcement of financial sector regulations. \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n36.  The CMDP will not entail any involuntary resettlement or have a negative impact on \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified category C for involuntary resettlement, \nimpact on indigenous people, and impact on the environment.11  \n \nD.

Assumptions  underlying  the  CMDP  include  macroeconomic  stability  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  pursue  reforms  and  effective  implementation  of  TA \nrecommendations. Mitigation measures have been put in place for some key risks. Political \nstability over the longer term remains a key risk (Table 1). 12 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n38.  In addition to the continued compliance and implementation of the actions specified in \nthe program policy matrix and standard assurances, the government has given the following \nspecific assurances: \n \n(i)  Continuity and coordination of reforms. The government will (a) carry out the \npolicies and actions in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained \nin the policy matrix and ensure sustainability of the reforms beyond the program \nperiod, (b) carry out all of its obligations as stipulated under the loan agreement \nin a timely manner, and (c) ensure that the agreed actions are sustained with \nrespect to each policy achievement.  \n(ii)  Policy dialogue. The borrower will keep ADB informed of, and the borrower and \nADB will from time to time exchange views on, sector issues, policy reforms, and \nadditional capital market reforms that may be considered necessary or desirable, \nincluding the progress made in carrying out policies and actions set out in the \npolicy letter and the policy matrix, P3F, and TA project. \n(iii)  Counterpart funds. The government will ensure that the counterpart funds will \nbe  used  to  support  financial  sector  reforms,  to  meet  the  financing  costs \nassociated  with  the  program  and  the  P3F,  and  the  financing  of  the  budget \nexpenditures,  notably  the  stimulus  package  focused  on  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000 to the Kingdom of Thailand for the Capital Market Development Program from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank-offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n \n30 August 2010 \n                   \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2009.
