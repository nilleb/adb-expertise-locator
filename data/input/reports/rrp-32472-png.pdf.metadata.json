This\nwill  be  achieved  through  the  provision  of  sustainable\nmicrofinance  services  to  viable  enterprises  as  well  as\nsavings facilities to the population at large. The Project will\nstrengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  at  least  40\npotentially  sustainable  existing  and  new  microfinance\ninstitutions  (MFIs).  It  will  establish  a  microfinance\ncompetence  center  to  provide  training  and  on-site\ncounseling  to  MFIs;  develop,  test,  and  implement  new\nclient-oriented  saving  services  and  loan  products;  and\nestablish  a  revolving  finance  facility  to  provide  needed\ncapital  to  MFIs  for  onlending.  Reduction  of  poverty  by\nintegrating  the  poor  into  the  mainstream  development\nprocess is the goal.\nClassification Primary:         poverty reduction\nSecondary:    economic growth\nEnvironmental Category C\nAssessment Environmental implications were reviewed, and no adverse\nenvironmental impacts were identified.\nRationale Poverty  is  of  increasing  concern  to  the  Government.\nApproximately 31 percent of the population live below the\npoverty line of $1 per day. To a large extent this can be\nattributed  to  the  incomplete  transition  from  a  purely\nsubsistence economy to a modern cash-based economy.\nPoverty in PNG is directly linked to the inability to earn\nsufficient cash income to pay for school fees, health care,\nand  other  nonfood  items,  and  to  save  for  future\nrequirements and times of hardship.\nThe formal sector can only provide a small number of jobs.\nIncome-earning  opportunities  for  the  majority  of  the\npopulation will need to come from smallholder agriculture,\nand  micro  and  small  enterprises  in  agroprocessing  and\ntrading.  The  growth  of  the  micro  and  small  enterprise\nsector is currently inhibited by (i) lack of vocational skills,\n(ii) deterioration of the law and order situation, (iii) poor\ninfrastructure,  and  (iv)  limited  provision  and  restricted\naccess  to  financial  services.  Efforts  are  under  way  to\novercome the first three of these impediments. Sustainable\nmicrofinance services are still needed.", "iii\nPNG\u2019s financial system displays a significant institutional\ngap,  which  leaves  micro  and  small  enterprises,\nsemisubsistence farmers, and poor households without any\nfinancial  services.  MFIs  are  scattered  across  PNG,  and\noperate  in isolation  and  without  clear  perspectives.  The\nknowledge  of  microfinance  best  practice  is  limited.  The\nability to design appropriate savings and loan products to\nsuit  clients\u2019  needs  is  nonexistent.  None  of  the  existing\nservice providers have the institutional capacity to achieve\nsustainability in the near to medium-term.\nMicrofinance  initiatives  require  support  measures  to\nenhance  their  institutional  capacity  to  ensure  the\nsustainable  delivery  of  microfinance  services  to  a  large\nnumber  of  micro  and  small  enterprises,  and  to  provide\nsavings  facilities  to  the  poor  and  currently  unserved\npopulation. The Project is designed to address these needs\nthrough the establishment of a microfinance competence\ncenter and a revolving finance facility for MFIs.\nObjective and Scope The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  provide  sustainable\nmicrofinance  services  to  viable  enterprises  and  savings\nservices to the population at large. The project strategy to\nachieve this objective is based on building the institutional\ncapacity  of  potentially  sustainable  MFIs.  The  Project\ncomprises three components: component A, establishment\nof  a  microfinance  competence  center;  component  B,\ndevelopment, testing, and implementation of new savings\nand loan products; and component C, establishment of a\nrevolving  finance  facility.  The  Project  will  provide  the\nnecessary  expertise,  training,  counseling,  and  some\nequipment to enhance the MFIs\u2019 institutional capacity. Study\ntours and visits to successfully operating MFIs in Asia, and\nin-country  conferences  and  workshops  will  provide\nexposure to best practices in microfinance. Resources will\nbe made available to fund a pilot microbanking scheme\nand the revolving finance facility.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $20.5 million\nequivalent,  comprising  $9.1  million  in  foreign  exchange\ncosts and $11.4 million equivalent in local currency costs.\nFinancing Plan Proposed  ADB  financing  is  estimated  at  $9.6  million\nequivalent (47 percent of total cost). Government financing\nwill amount to $4.7 million equivalent (23 percent of total\ncost). Counterpart funding of $1.2 million will be provided by\nthe Institute of Banking and Business Management and $0.5\nmillion  by  the  Bank  of  PNG.  The  MFIs\u2019  contribution  is\nestimated at $3.7 million equivalent. Grant cofinancing will\nbe  provided  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment ($0.9 million).", "iv\nLoan Amount and Based on the present allocation of funding, the loan would\nTerms amount  to  $9.6  million  from  the  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds\nresources.

I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan  to  the  Independent  State  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  for  the  Microfinance  and\nEmployment Project (Project); and (ii) proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) of a grant for the Project to be provided by the Australian Agency for International\nDevelopment (AusAID).\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. At the request of the Government, ADB provided technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare\nthe Microfinance and Employment Project for possible ADB financing in 2000. The TA started\nwith the Microfinance Best Practice conference in February 2000 in Lae with broad participation\nfrom a wide range of stakeholders and practitioners. Field surveys covering three of the four\nregions of PNG were carried out to assess the credit needs of micro and small enterprises, the\ndemand  for  saving  facilities,  and  the  capacity  and  weaknesses  of  current  microfinance\nproviders. The resulting report was discussed during a participatory project planning workshop\nin March 2000, during which the goal-oriented project planning (ZOPP)2 method was applied\nand resulted in the project framework given in Appendix 1. Participants included representatives\nfrom  national  and  provincial  government  agencies,  microfinance  institutions  (MFI),  savings\ngroups, savings and loan societies (SLSs), the central bank, commercial banks, the Institute of\nBanking  and  Business  Management  (IBBM),    private  sector,  and  bilateral  and  multilateral\nassistance agencies. The ADB Loan Fact-Finding Mission was fielded 19\u201330 March 2000. This\nwas followed by the Appraisal Mission from 19 June \u2013 7 July 2000.3 In addition, the Mission\nvisited Bulolo and Wau in the Momase region, and in Wau, discussed in detail the possibility of\npilot testing a microbanking scheme. The national and district governments expressed strong\ninterest in and support for the proposed Project.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.  Poverty Conditions\n3. After 25 years of political independence and some economic and social progress, a large\npercentage of the people of PNG remain poor. The human poverty index for PNG is at the level of\nBurundi and Mali, which are among the most poverty afflicted nations in the world.  The 1996\nhousehold survey indicated that 31.0 percent of PNG\u2019s population live below the poverty line of $1\nper capita per day.4 The incidence of poverty is high compared with countries with similar per\ncapita  income  levels.  Approximately  17  percent  of  the  population  cannot  meet  the  basic\nrequirement of 2,200 calories per day per adult equivalent, even if they spend all their income on\nfood.\n 4. The poverty coexists with wealth. The richest 10 percent of the population account for 36\npercent of consumption, whereas the poorest 50 percent account for just 20 percent. The Gini\n                                                \n1  TA 3315-PNG: Microfinance and Employment, for $150,000, approved on 29 November 1999.\n2  ZOPP, from the German term \u201cZielorientierte Projekt Planung\u201d is a project planning and management method that\nis based on two techniques \u2014 matrix building and stakeholder workshops. The main output of a ZOPP session is a\nproject planning matrix equivalent to a project logical framework, to provide in-depth analysis of project objectives,\noutputs, activities, and performance indicators and risks. It encourages brainstorming, strategizing, information\ngathering, and consensus building among stakeholders.\n3  The mission comprised A. Iffland, Project Economist and Mission Leader; and O. Tiwana, Counsel. The Mission\nwas assisted by T. Schiller, staff consultant.\n4  World Bank. 1999 Papua New Guinea: Poverty and Access to Public Services, Report No. 19584-PNG. The $1 a\nday is at 1985 prices converted to the national currency at a purchasing power parity exchange rate.", "2\ncoefficient of 0.461 is high by comparison with countries of similar income levels. This is in large\npart a reflection of the dualistic pattern of growth during the postindependence period. Growth has\nbeen led by a capital-intensive minerals sector generating state revenues used in part to support a\nlarge public service. The semisubsistence sector on which the vast majority of the population\ndepends  has  shown  little  growth.  Per  capita  real  gross  domestic  product  in  the  nonmining\neconomy grew at the average rate of just 0.2 percent per annum during 1978\u20131998.\n5. Poverty in PNG has an important regional dimension with the vast majority of the poor\n(93.3 percent) living in rural areas. The incidence and extent of poverty vary significantly across\nthe five major regions (Table 1). The Momase and North Coast region exhibits the highest\nincidence of poverty, with 45.8 percent of the population living below the poverty line. Poverty\nrates in the regions of Papua and South Coast, the Highlands, and the New Guinea Islands are\nclustered slightly below the national average, ranging from 33.2 to 35.8 percent. The urbanized\nNational Capital District (NCD) accounts for only 3.8 percent of the poor; only a quarter of the\nNCD\u2019s population lives below the poverty line. The depth of poverty, measured by the poverty\nseverity index,5 is twice as high in the poorest Momase and North Coast region as in the NCD.\nTable 1: Poverty Measures by Region\nRegion Headcount Index Poverty Severity % of total\nPopulation\nIndex Contribution to Index Contribution\ntotal (%) in total (%)\nNCD 25.8 3.8 3.3 3.3 5.5\nPapua and South Coast 33.2 13.2 5.5 14.7 14.9\nHighlands 35.8 38.3 5.3 38.0 40.1\nMomase and North 45.8 35.5 6.6 34.2 29.2\nCoast\nNew Guinea Islands 33.6 9.2 5.3 9.8 10.3\nPNG Total 37.5 100.0 5.6 100.0 100.0\nUrban 16.1 6.5 1.6 4.2 15.1\nRural 41.3 93.5 6.3 95.8 84.9\nNCD = National Capital District, PNG = Papua New Guinea.\nSource: Papua New Guinea. 1996. Household Survey. Port Moresby.\n6. The distribution of poverty can also be viewed in terms of the regional distribution of\nnational poverty. The Momase region accounts for almost 36 percent of the poor in PNG, but has\nonly 29 percent of the population. The Highlands, with about 40 percent of the population,\naccounts for 38 percent of the poor. Hence, over three quarters of the poor population of PNG live\nin these two regions. Measuring poverty with the distributionally sensitive poverty severity index\nindicates the same two regions account for over 70 percent of PNG\u2019s poverty.\n7. The incidence of poverty in PNG is linked to the ability to earn cash income to pay for\nnonfood items, to vary and improve diets, and to permit savings for times of economic difficulty\n(e.g., drought). Almost 17 percent of the poor population live in households where the household\nhead earns no cash income, relying entirely on subsistence production (and perhaps gifts of\ncash). The poverty rate for these households is 47 percent. Almost 8 percent of the poor live in\n                                                \n5  The poverty severity index is a distributionally sensitive poverty measure that takes into account the distribution of\nconsumption of those falling below the poverty line. This index shows that poverty is significantly deeper in rural\nareas of PNG than in urban areas.", "3\nhouseholds, whose main source of cash income is hunting, gathering, and fishing. The poverty\nrate for these households is 57 percent. Poverty rates are also above the national average for\nhouseholds that earn cash income from tree crops (44 percent) and commercial agriculture (42.7\npercent). These households account for 42.5 percent and 19.0 percent of the poor population,\nrespectively.  Where  household  heads  earn  cash  income  from  running  a  business  or  wage\nemployment, poverty rates are much lower (at 25 percent and 17 percent, respectively). Although\nthe latter households collectively account for 29 percent of PNG\u2019s total population, they account\nfor only 14 percent of the poor population. In general, increased provision of opportunities for\nearning secure cash incomes is needed to reduce the incidence and severity of poverty.\n8. Both  the  extent  of  income-earning  opportunities  and  the  ability  to  respond  to  such\nopportunities are determined to a significant degree by access to the basic public services of\ntransport, utilities, health, education, and financial services. The PNG population as a whole\nexpressed considerable dissatisfaction with access to services in 1996, and it is highly likely that\nthe degree of dissatisfaction increased during the late 1990s as a result of a widely acknowledged\ndeterioration in service provision. Poverty reduction requires improved service delivery to rural\nareas. This was the intention of provincial and local government reforms introduced under the\nOrganic Law of 1995, but effective implementation of devolution has been limited by capacity and\nfunding constraints.\n9. The  fundamental  and  long-recognized  development  challenge  for  PNG  is  to  achieve\nsustained economic growth with equity. The poorest 40 percent of the population must participate\nin, and benefit from, the growth process if poverty is to be reduced. Hence, poverty interventions\nhave to be primarily targeted at rural areas where the vast majority of the poor live.  There are\nsevere development constraints, including the rugged terrain of PNG\u2019s 462,000 square kilometers,\nthe complexity of land tenure systems, the dispersal of 4.5 million people collectively speaking\nwell over 700 languages, limited and deteriorating physical infrastructure, a major law and order\nproblem, and the low level of human resource development. Nonetheless, some key development\nconstraints can be eased over time through appropriate government action, notably for investment\nin human capital, better service delivery including access to finance by the rural areas, and\ninfrastructure improvement. The Government is committed to addressing these issues to reduce\npoverty  and  socioeconomic  inequalities  through  private  sector-led  growth  and  employment\ncreation (para. 33).\nB.  Sector Description\n1.  The Financial System\n10. Banking history in PNG dates back to 1916, when the Bank of New South Wales opened a\nbranch in Port Moresby. It was set up mainly to carry out payment transactions, and to meet the\ncredit needs of the modern business sector, the working capital needs of plantations, and the\nforeign trade sector. Until after the Second World War, no other bank established branches in the\ncountry. Up to 1974 the system was essentially a small extension of the Australian system with\npolicies decided by management outside the country. With independence, the PNG branch of the\nCommonwealth Banking Corporation was transferred to the Government and started to work as\nthe first PNG-owned bank under the name of Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation (PNGBC).\nAlthough, there was little utilization of trade or credit facilities by the local population, considerable\nuse was made of savings account facilities. In 1970, Papua New Guineans held nine tenths of the\ntotal number of 400,000 savings accounts, which accounted for one third of the total value. From\n1973 to 1986, PNGBC systematically extended the banking network to all provinces. While all\nforeign-owned banks were incorporated locally by 1976, it took 20 years until the first nationally", "4\nowned private bank was created. On the basis of shares sold by the National Bank of Australia, a\nlocal consortium founded the Bank of South Pacific in 1993. At present six commercial banks\noperate in PNG.6\n11. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG, the central bank) distinguishes four tiers of\ninstitutions forming PNG\u2019s financial system (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Regulated and Non-Regulated Financial Institutions\nROSCAS  Microfinance NGOs Informal Savings Groups\nInvestment  and Insurance Stock Rural Dev.\nPension Companies  Exchange Bank\nFunds and Brokers\nFinance Savings & Merchant\nCompanies Loan Banks\nSocieties\nCommercial \nBanks\nBank of\nPNG\nNGO  =  nongovernment  organization,  PNG  =  Papua  New  Guinea,  ROSCAS  =  rotating  savings  and  credit\nassociations.\nSource:  Bank of Papua New Guinea.  Money and Banking in PNG. Port Moresby, p.125.\n12. Besides BPNG, the system comprises three regulated tiers and one nonregulated. The\ncommercial banks form the first tier. As creators of secondary money, they are an important link\nbetween BPNG and the remainder of the financial system, as well as with the nonfinancial\nsectors of the economy. Commercial banks are important for the conduct of monetary and fiscal\npolicy  in  PNG,  as  reserve  requirements  and  Treasury  bills  are  the  most  important\nmacroeconomic instruments. The second-tier institutions are bank-like financial institutions, e.g.,\nfinance companies, merchant banks, and SLSs, which play an important role in mobilizing\nsavings. As opposed to banks, they are not allowed to conduct cheque deposits. The third-tier\ncomprises nonbank financial institutions, including investment and pension funds, insurance\ncompanies  and  brokers,  the  stock  exchange,  and  the  Rural  Development  Bank.  Nonbank\nfinancial institutions do not engage in deposit taking. The nonregulated financial institutions form\na  separate  category  and  include  microfinance  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and\ninformal  savings  groups  that  provide  financial  services  without  any  form  of  regulation  or\nsupervision.\n13. The formal financial sector is supported by IBBM,7 which was created in 1965 by the\nReserve  Bank  of  Australia  as  the  Banker\u2019s  College.  It\u2019s  overall  objective  is  to  enhance\nprofessional expertise in commerce, banking, finance, and business management by providing\ntraining  and  education  that  meets  national  needs  and  international  standards.  IBBM  is\nconducting  various  residential  and  nonresidential  short-  and  long-term  training  courses  in\n                                                \n6  The six banks are PNG Banking Corporation, the Bank of the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand Bank,\nWestpac, Bank of Hawaii, and Maybank (PNG) Ltd. of Malaysia.\n7  IBBM was officially established in 1974 under the Associations Incorporation Act of PNG.", "5\nbanking, finance, and business management for staff of commercial banks in PNG and the\nPacific region, and private sector enterprises. All commercial banks in PNG, the central bank, as\nwell as the Teachers Savings and Loan Society, the largest SLS in PNG, are members of IBBM.\n14. The structure of this potential market for microfinance services is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: Toward Mainstream Financial Services\n16.800 (1%) High-End Market\nBanks and Financial Institutions\nUpgrading 851.000 (55%)\nDownscaling\nLow-End Market\nMicrofinance 691.000 (44%)\nInstitutions\nCredit Savings Insurance\n15. The upper end of the market, the peak of the pyramid, comprises people that have\naccess to financial services, and the lower end of the market, the base of the pyramid, consists\nof  people  engaged  in  nonremunerated  subsistence  activities.  The  potential  market  for\nmicrofinance services is between those two market segments with an estimated number of\n851,000 potential customers. Taking a conservative stand, it can be assumed that at least one\nthird of this market has actual demand for credit.8 This amounts to 255,000 potential borrowers.\nBased on an average loan size of $240 the total demand for credit would amount to $61 million.\nUsing a loan size of $800, more appropriate for microenterpises and small farmers, the amount\nincreases to $200 million. Appendix 2 provides details on the micro and small enterprise sector.\n16. With regard to savings, existing regulated and nonregulated financial institutions are\noffering deposit-taking facilities to some extent. PNGBC plays the dominant role in savings\nmobilization with a total of 465,765 passbooks and transaction accounts, and an average\naccount balance of $141. PNGBC expanded its network of branches in urban centers and\nagencies in remote areas until the mid-1980s. The worsening security situation increased the\ncost of operations to an unsustainable level and subsequently forced PNGBC to reduce its\nnetwork substantially. From 407 agencies in 1984, only 87 remained in operation in 1997. The\nwithdrawal of this financial service, particularly from the rural and more remote areas, has\ncreated a vacuum and at the same time a niche for informal savings groups to be established.\n2.  Providers of Microfinance Services\n17. Microfinance providers can be found in each of the different tiers that comprise the\nfinancial system. Among the first tier institutions, there are currently two commercial banks\n                                                \n8  Results of the sample survey of micro and small enterprises and their perceived credit needs, part of the TA\n(footnote 1), as well as information provided by commercial banks on the requests received for personal loans\nsuggest that the demand for credit is in the range of 300,000 potential borrowers.", "6\noffering financial services suitable for the microfinance market, PNGBC and to a lesser extent,\nthe Bank of the South Pacific. Both banks offer deposit services, with PNGBC playing the key\nrole in mobilizing savings in PNG. From a total of $415 million of PNGBC\u2019s demand and term\ndeposits, $127 million correspond to a total of 465,765 passbook and transaction accounts, with\nan average account balance of $141. Compared with the strong involvement in mobilizing small\nsavings, PNGBC is not significantly active in the field of microcredit. Of a total loan portfolio of\n$257 million, only an outstanding balance of approximately $1.2 million (0.18 percent) belongs\nto nearly 800 credits disbursed to the microfinance sector. According to PNGBC\u2019s estimates,\nabout 40 percent of the corresponding portfolio is at risk. Based on this performance and the\nGovernment\u2019s plan to privatize PNGBC, its engagement in microcredit will decrease in the\nfuture.\n18. The  bank-like  financial  institutions,  the  second  tier,  the  SLSs,  and  Village  Finance\nLimited (VFL) provide microfinance services. While the commercial banks were always oriented\nto the modern economy, the SLSs were originally conceived in the 1960s by the Reserve Bank\nof Australia to promote financial education and development in rural areas, encourage savings,\nprovide credit, and support small capital formation. After independence the system of SLSs\ncame under the supervision of BPNG. Most SLSs are affiliated with the PNG Federation of\nSavings and Loan Societies. Notwithstanding the original rural orientation of the SLSs, urban-\nbased societies became increasingly important during the 1980s. Generally, urban societies are\ncentered on common employment, and often secure contributions through payroll deduction\nschemes. During the 1980s many SLSs ran into problems with high loan delinquencies due to\nmismanagement  and  inexperienced  staff.  As  a  consequence,  today  most  SLSs  are  either\ndormant or were liquidated by BPNG. As of December 1998, there were 21 SLSs in the country\nwith a total membership of 64,025 and a savings balance of $47 million equivalent to an\naverage  savings  balance  of  $737  per  member.  Since  1998,  BPNG  has  carried  out  a\nrevitalization program and introduced five new regional SLSs. To avoid the problems of the\npast, almost all SLSs have established a maximum loan amount equivalent to the amount of\nindividual  savings  held  with  the  institution.  A  considerable  amount  of  savings  deposits  is\nchanneled either as deposits to the commercial banks or is invested in Government bonds.\nWhile SLSs are important service providers, particularly to the urban middle class, the size of\nthe system, in terms of assets and loans, is insignificant when compared with the commercial\nbanks.\n19. VFL was founded in 1998 as a wholly owned subsidiary of PNGBC with initial capital of\n$400,000. It is a special purpose financial institution established to deliver microfinance services\nthroughout PNG. In 1999, VFL obtained a financial institutions license, which requires targeting\nthe underprivileged and returning all profits for investing in microfinance. VFL started field\noperations in 1999. With a group lending methodology, the company targets poor women in\nrural and urban areas. By December 1999, there were 156 outstanding loans with an average\nsize of $144 and a portfolio at risk of less than 5 percent. On the savings side, 376 compulsory\nand voluntary savings accounts exist, with an average balance of $19. As of March 2000, VFL is\nauthorized to extend individual loans of up to $12,000.\n20. As part of the third tier comprising nonbank financial institutions, the Rural Development\nBank (RDB), founded in 1967, is one of the Government\u2019s financial instruments to promote\ndevelopment in urban and rural areas. RDB maintains a small network with seven branches and\n11 representative offices. It has always been a credit supply institution with no deposit facilities\nfinanced by the national Government budget. Unlike other development banks, it was never\nused as a conduit for foreign investment, although during the 1980s the World Bank and ADB\nestablished credit lines for onlending for approved agricultural development projects. Like many", "7\nother development banks, RDB has a bad loan portfolio with large credits targeted to priority\nprojects and granted on subsidized interest rates. Because of its poor repayment rates in 1998,\nRDB had to write off $8 million of a total loan portfolio of $24 million. To save RDB, the\nGovernment provided capitalization with a one-off transaction of $12 million. In the future RDB\nwill concentrate on priority banking for the most profitable clients of the existing loan portfolio. At\nthe end of 1998, RDB\u2019s total assets were valued at $35 million, with $12 million in loans and\nadvances and an even higher amount invested in profitable Government T-bills ($13.5 million).\nThe portfolio at risk lies in the range of over 70 percent. Approximately 12 percent of the\noutstanding loans, or 2,400 credits with an average loan size of $1,225 correspond to the\nmicrofinance market. These loans form part of a small loan program established to finance\nsmall capital investments like outboard motors, basic capital equipment, and farming supplies.\n21. The nonregulated financial institutions form the fourth tier of the financial system and\ncomprise various microfinance and microcredit schemes. The Papua New Guinea National\nWomen\u2019s Credit Project (NWCP), a project initiative of the Department of Home Affairs and the\nNational Council of Women, was established in response to the 1987 National Women\u2019s Policy\nto deliver credit to underprivileged poor women. While several pilot phases had rather poor\nperformance, with the exception of the program in the Western Highlands, in 1996 the NWCP\nwas implemented nationwide with total funding of $1 million. The NWCP seeks to strengthen\nwomen\u2019s associations at the district level to serve as conduits for servicing credit needs of group\nbased, noncollateralized, rural and urban women borrowers. To date, the NWCP is operational\nin approximately 41 districts. By December 1999, the estimated value of the loan portfolio was\nabout $120,000, with 1,250 loans outstanding and an average loan size of $112. The portfolio at\nrisk is in the range of above 50 percent. Approximately 8,200 women are affiliated with the\nwomen\u2019s district credit associations for the purpose of credit.\n22. Lik  Lik  Dinau  Abitore  Trust  (LLDAT),  the  best-known  and  most-documented  NGO\nengaged in microfinance in PNG, emerged from the collaboration of seven parties, including\ngovernment  departments:  PNGBC;  United  Nations  Development  Programmme  (UNDP);\nNational Council of Women; and the Foundation of Law, Order, and Justice.  The LLDAT began\noperation in 1994 with the objective to provide savings and credit facilities to very poor mainly\nrural women. It was founded explicitly to replicate the Grameen Bank model. After a promising\nbeginning, LLDAT\u2019s performance was severely affected by the lack of institutional capacity and\nliquidity  problems.  To  date,  there  are  2,704  group  members  affiliated  with  the  trust.  By\nDecember  1998,  LLDAT  had  an  outstanding  loan  balance  of  $85,000,  with  1,493  group\nmembers and an average loan size of $195.9 According to recent estimations, the portfolio at\nrisk is above 50 percent.\n23. The North Simbu Rural Development Project established a microcredit scheme with the\nsupport  of  the  provincial  government,  the  provincial  council  of  women,  and  the  Austrian\nVolunteers Service. The scheme targets women and applies a group approach, with loans given\nto individual members of the group. During the 16 months since inception, the project processed\na total of 630 loans, with 36 currently outstanding. The overall repayment rate is 94 percent, the\naverage loan size $200.\n24. In  response  to  the  lack  of  adequate  rural  finance  facilities,  in  1995  the  Lutheran\nDevelopment Service initiated the Putim na Kisim Project. It aims to establish savings cells at\nthe village level as the basis for the development of rural saving and loan societies. The project\n                                                \n9\n According to the last audited financial statements from December 1999.", "8\nis  seen  as  a  pure  bottom-up  approach,  and  thus  as  an  alternative  to  the  government\nrevitalization program for SLSs. A vital role in the project concept is played by the integrated\nYangpela Didiman Program, run by the Lutheran Development Service for more than 25 years.\nVillage people are trained to serve at the village level as volunteer development workers. In their\nrole of multipliers, their aim is to improve agricultural and basic livelihood skills and to foster\nspiritual  development  throughout  their  community.  To  date,  there  are  more  than  3,000\nvolunteers in hundreds of villages. The Putim na Kisim Project relies on this existing structure to\nadd village banking to the multipurpose program portfolio of the Yangpela Didiman Program.\nCurrently, there are 20 saving cells operating in the framework of the pilot phase. The saving\ncells have 817 members, with total savings of $29,000. The average individual savings balance\nis $31. Lending is to start in 2000, and the methodology will be similar to that applied by the\nSLS: the loan amount will be determined by the individual savings balance, interest rates will be\nin the range of 10 percent per annum.\n25. The VVN Saving Society in East New Britain Province is an example of the informal\nsavings schemes that exist throughout PNG. The society was established in 1997 through the\ninitiative of a member of the village community. The 700 members save voluntarily, with a\ncurrent savings balance of $40,000. Funds are held in a group savings account with PNGBC.\nThere are no minimum balance requirements, and withdrawals can be made without limitations\nthree days per week.\n26. All  MFIs  and  budding  microfinance  initiatives  have  a  number  of  characteristics  in\ncommon. They are scattered all over PNG, mainly in rural areas, and operate in isolation and\nwithout clear perspectives. The knowledge of microfinance best practice is rather limited, which\nis reflected by a microfinance landscape dominated by Grameen Bank replications irrespective\nof their appropriateness and suitability for PNG. The ability to design appropriate savings and\nloan products to suit the needs of the clients is generally very weak. The majority of MFIs suffer\nfrom lack of well-defined and transparent governance and management structures, and the\nabsence of an effective management information system. The managers and the loan officers\nlack even basic training to adequately carry out their jobs. MFIs are undercapitalized and have\nno mechanism to raise additional funds for onlending through deposits or from formal financial\ninstitutions. Taking all these factors into account, it is not surprising that none of the MFIs have\nachieved financial viability and have no vision on how to achieve it. Details are in Appendix 3.\n3.  Demand for Microfinance Services\n27. The size and structure of the potential market for microfinance services is based on the\nstructure of the economically active population. Figure 3 distinguishes between wage income,\nnonwage earning, and income in-kind.", "9\nFigure 3: Regional Distribution of Income per Capita (1996 in Kina)\nNCD\nMorobe\nEnga\nE/Highlands\nManus\nWage Nonwage In Kind\nW/Sepik\nMadang\nNew Ireland\nE/Sepik\nGulf\n-   200.0  400.0  600.0  800.0  1,000.0  1,200.0  1,400.0  1,600.0  1,800.0  2,000.0 \nNCD = National Capital District\nSource: Papua New Guinea. 1996. Household Survey.\nIn 1996, the average per capita income in the provinces, excluding the NCD, amounted to about\n$400 (K1.000). The importance of monetary wage income as compared with monetary nonwage\nincome is decreasing in the more remote areas where income in-kind is the predominant\nsource. In more than twothirds of the provinces, the average monetary income is clustered\naround the poverty line of K46110 per adult equivalent per year. While wage earners in the\nprovinces are potential clients for savings products, their ability to use credit for nonconsumptive\npurposes is limited. The nonwage earners receive their income from agricultural production and\nother business activities, and have an articulated demand for credit to be used for working\ncapital and investments in their businesses.\n28. A  closer  look  at  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  a  potential  client  will  provide  a  better\nunderstanding of the demand for microfinance services. This is done in a generic way and results\nin the balance sheet structure given in Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Generic Balance Sheet of MFI-Clients\nAAsssseettss LLiiaabbiilliittiieess\nMoney \u2022 Claims of Wantok\nClaims from Wantok\nTools and Equipment \u2022 Credit of supplier\nAnimals\nUsing rights of Land \u2022 Credit from MFI\nCoffee/Palm trees\nGardens\nHouse \u2022 Equity\n                                                \n10 This poverty line of K461 is based on the cost of a food consumption basket that meets a minimum energy\nrequirement of 2,200 calories per adult equivalent per day and reflects the dietary pattern of the lower income\ngroups (food poverty line).", "10\n29. Most striking is the important role of claims and liabilities that are related to the extended\nfamily network of the wantok. These relationships are only partly valued in money and follow more\nthe logic of social reciprocity.  Within the framework of PNG\u2019s traditional culture, claims of the\nwantok are of higher priority than legal obligations outside the wantok system. This has to be\nunderstood as part of the social safety net of the traditional culture that is still predominant in\nalmost all parts of PNG society. From an economic point of view this allows a smallholder to\nhandle external shocks such as a draught by attending obligations within the wantok in a flexible\nway. A wantok works as a form of extended equity that assumes part of the risk as well as\nparticipates in the return of an investment. For the purpose of demand targeting, this has to be\ntaken into account. It would not be wise to try to compete or even to substitute the relationships\nwithin the wantok with those of formal or semiformal financial institutions. As in the modern\neconomy, the majority of funding for a small business would be related to equity, in the traditional\neconomy of PNG\u2014with good reason\u2014this most likely relates to the wantok. In both cases a\nfinancial institution would always try to avoid the risk related to equity financing, and rather would\ninsist that existing equity covers the risk of a bank loan. The same is true when it comes to the\nwantok system, where an assessment is needed as to whether the wantoks stand ready to take\nsome of the credit risk or whether there is only a potential claim that actually increases the risk of\nthe borrower.\n30. With regard to savings products, the wantok system leads to the need for highly liquid\nproducts, and also for less liquid term deposits. As obligations toward wantok members may have\nto be attended to on short notice, some liquidity is important, but at the same time, less liquid term\ndeposits can protect individual savings from being siphoned off by the wantok system.\n31. The following figures on the structure of the economically active population in PNG give\nsome indication of the demand and the potential market for microfinance services. Table 2\ndistinguishes between remunerated and nonremunerated economic activities.\nTable 2: Economically Active Population\n  Persons Target\nMonetary 1990 1996 % % Persons %\nWage Job 240,763 277,418 24 9\nBusiness   14,580 1  6,800 1 1 16,800 1\nSelf-Employed  67,082   77,295 7 3 77,295 5\nProfessional Farm/Fish 671,954 774,256 68 27 774,256 50\nTotal 994,379   1,145,769 100\nNonmonetary\nSubsistence Farm/Fish 600,342 691,742 39 24 691,742 44\nStudent 347,469 400,370 23 14\nHousework 275,567 317,521 18 11\nRetired  63,965   73,703 4 3\nHandicapped/Disabled  11,859  13,664 1 0\nUnemployed 133,612 153,954 9 5\nOthers 107,840 124,258 7 4\nT o t a l    1,540,654   1,775,213 100 100\nPopulation over 10 years   2,535,033   2,920,982 1,560,093 100", "11\n32. Within  the  remunerated  part  of  the  economically  active  population,  24  percent  are\nclassified as employees receiving a wage income, 1 percent as entrepreneurs, 3 percent as\nself-employed, and 68 percent as engaged professionally in farming or fishing. Within the\nnonremunerated part of the total economically active population, 39 percent are in the category\nof subsistence farm or fishing activities.  On the basis of the poverty assessment it can be\nassumed that at least the two last-mentioned categories comprise the poor. According to this\nclassification, the target market for microfinance loan products (nonconsumption loans) will\ncomprise  businesspersons,  self-employed,  and  professional  and  subsistence  farmers  and\nfisherfolk. Based on the 1990 census, an estimated 1,5 million people will be in this group. With\nregard to savings products, an additional 0.3 million people or 30 percent of the remaining\neconomically active population, considered to not be integrated in the cash economy, can be\nadded.11\nC.  Government Policies and Plans\n33. In the Medium-Term Development Strategy, 1997-2002, which was reconfirmed by the\nnew  Government  in  1999  and  is  reviewed  annually,  the  Government  emphasizes  the\nimportance of private sector development for the future of PNG. This development priority was\nreconfirmed during the National Dialogue in 2000. The development of a vibrant micro, small,\nand medium-size enterprise sector to spearhead economic growth is of specific importance to\nthe Government. This is reflected in the Small and Medium Enterprise Policy, approved in 1998.\nTo improve the business environment, the policy identifies and addresses key issues and\nconstraints hindering business development. The Government aims to focus on the weaknesses\nof  the  financial  system  to  improve  the  provision  of  financial  services  for  private  sector\ndevelopment. The Government perceives access to financial services as a key to enhancing the\neconomic integration of micro and small enterprises and those who want to save money for\nfuture financial needs. Hence, the regulatory framework for banks and other financial institutions\nhas been revised, and new Central Bank and Banks and Financials Institutions acts were\ngazetted this year. A microfinance workgroup involving major stakeholders was established to\nprepare a microfinance policy to be submitted for Government approval by the end of 2000. The\ndraft Microfinance Policy Paper is given in Appendix 4.\nD.  External Assistance to the Sector\n34. The financial sector is receiving support at the macro level under the overall structural\nadjustment program. This comprises advisory services by the Reserve Bank of Australia to\nreview PNG\u2019s monetary policy. The World Bank is assisting BPNG with banking supervision,\nincluding  nonbanks  and  SLSs.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  has  assisted  with  the\ndevelopment and introduction of the new Central Bank Act, and Banks and Financial Institutions\nAct.\n35. In comparison with the support provided to BPNG, external assistance for microfinance\nis  rather  fragmented.  It  ranges  from  setting  up  revolving  credit  funds  as  a  part  of  large\ncomprehensive rural development projects and sector programs, to the provision of seed money\nto  village  communities  and  women\u2019s  groups.  Most  initiatives  aim  at  reducing  poverty  and\nuplifting  underprivileged  groups  of  society,  particularly  women.  International  NGOs  and\nvolunteer  organizations,  church-based  institutions,  private  companies,  and  individuals  are\n                                                \n11 Since the last census in 1990, the cash-based economy has strongly advanced. It can therefore be safely assumed\nthat a much larger percentage of the economically active population is partially or fully integrated.", "12\ninvolved. Neither the Government nor any other institution has an overview of the various actors\nand the assistance provided.\n36. LLDAT, the best-known and most-documented microfinance provider in PNG, was set\nup with TA and seed capital from UNDP. Insufficient funding and managerial and institutional\ncapacity constraints led AusAID to provide rescue assistance. This includes capital and short-\nterm  advisory  assistance.  AusAID  also  provided  support  for  a  nine-month  pilot  project  in\nBouganville,  the  Bouganville  Haus  Moni.  The  support  focused  on  creating  awareness  for\nsavings,  training  community  leaders,  and  establishing  savings  cells  in  selected  districts.\nAusAID is considering providing assistance to the urban-based ItaKara development project to\ndeliver financial and business development services in an integrated approach.\n37. The European Union (EU) provided seed capital to the Bougainville Provincial Council of\nWomen to set up a microcredit scheme. Implementation is rather slow and a recent progress\nevaluation suggested the redesign of the scheme, which will be implemented shortly. The EU is\nalso supporting the design and planning of a rural credit scheme for smallholder cocoa and\ncopra farmers in Bougainville.\nE.  Lessons Learned\n38. During 1988-1998, ADB approved 15 microfinance projects, 6 projects with microfinance\ncomponents, and 34 TAs to support microfinance operations in the Asian and Pacific Region.\nADB recently completed a review of its microfinance operations during this period.12 While TA\nhas been an important element in ADB\u2019s microfinance activities, TAs suffered from a number of\ndrawbacks: (i) lack of adequate sector analysis, (ii) insufficient institutional analysis and lack of a\ncoherent  long-term  approach  to  institutional  development,  (iii)  limited  involvement  of\nstakeholders in the design of TA leading to problems of ownership, and (iv) lack of measurable\nand monitorable indicators to assess performance. The project preparatory TA for this Project\naddressed these shortcomings and emphasized the building of local ownership for the Project.\n39. ADB\u2019s microfinance project loans have improved over time. The early projects, the first\ngeneration  projects,  in  general  (i)  focused  on  microcredit  delivery;  (ii)  allowed  subsidized\ninterest rates; (iii) paid little attention to financial viability; and (iv) were very poorly targeted. In\nrecent years, the projects support a wider array of institutions, go beyond credit services to\nprovide voluntary savings on a limited scale, emphasize market-oriented interest rates, and pay\nmore attention to financial viability.\n40. Although it is difficult to reliably measure the development impact of finance services,\nassessments of the operations of already completed microfinance projects and review reports\non the ongoing projects offer some important insights on the development impact of ADB\u2019s\nmicrofinance assistance. These projects provide a wealth of information and experiences. The\nmain lessons learned form the key areas of ADB\u2019s Microfinance Development Strategy13:\n(i)  A financial systems development approach14 is the key to achieving sustainable\nresults and to maximizing development impact.\n                                                \n12 Asian Development Bank. 1999. Review of Asian Development Banks\u2019 Microfinance Portfolio. Manila.\n13 Asian Development Bank. 2000. Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy. Manila\n14This approach emphasizes an enabling policy environment, financial infrastructure, and the development of\nfinancial intermediaries that are committed to achieving financial viability and sustainability within a reasonable\nperiod and that can provide a variety of financial services.", "13\n(ii)  Microfinance clients are more concerned about access to adequate services than\nthe cost of the services.\n(iii)  A  broad  range  of  microfinance  service  providers  is  required  to  respond\nadequately to the diversity of demand for financial services and to expand the\noutreach.\n(iv)  Considerable TA for capacity building is needed to build strong retail institutions\nwith a commitment to outreach and sustainability.\n(v)  The demand for savings services by poor households and microenterpises is as\nstrong, if not stronger, than the demand for credit. Expansion of the outreach of\nsavings services can have a significant impact on both institutional sustainability\nof MFIs and poverty reduction.\n41. An analysis of the microfinance projects supported by AusAID and the EU in PNG\nprovide insights on operational issues and requirements for microfinance services. Lessons\nlearned identify the following as important requirements for a successful microfinance project in\nPNG:\n(i)  transparent  governance  and  management  structure  outside  the  influence  of\nGovernment,\n(ii)  business  plan  and  a  management  information  system  to  monitor  key\nperformance indicators,\n(iii)  training of management and loan officers,\n(iv)  flexible savings and loan products based on the requirements of the clientele,\n(v)  adequate equity to allow expansion.\n42. The lessons learned and the insights gained from AusAID and EU-assisted microfinance\nschemes, ADB\u2019s completed and ongoing microfinance projects, as well as international best\npractice in microfinance as disseminated by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor have had\na strong influence on the design of all project components, which aim to provide microfinance\nservices to the poor while achieving financial viability of MFIs.\nF.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n43. The ADB\u2019s current country operational strategy for PNG was discussed by the Board in\nOctober 1998. It is in line with the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Strategy and\nADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategic Framework and Strategy for the Pacific.\n44. The strategy emphasizes the importance of financial services for economic and social\ndevelopment in PNG. It recognizes the need to improve access to financial services particularly\nin rural areas and for the poorer strata of the population. On the deposit side, limited access to\nmodern savings and transaction mechanisms, force the poor to hold cash and have an adverse\neffect on the already serious law and order problem. On the funding side, very limited access to\ncredit continues to be a serious impediment to private sector development and sustainable\ngrowth. Better access to financial services will assist the poor to create microenterpises and\ngenerate  broad-based  income.  This  will  lead  to  new  employment  opportunities,  a  key\ndevelopment objective of PNG. In the context of PNG and the rather limited success of various\nmicrocredit  schemes,  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  of  existing  service\nproviders is crucial for the provision of sustainable microfinance services. The Project reflects\nthese features, which are key elements of ADB\u2019s microfinance strategy, and is designed to\nassist the Government in addressing identified shortcomings.", "14\nG.  Policy Dialogue\n45. Policy dialogue with the Government in this area was initiated in 1998 in conjunction with\nADB\u2019s microfinance strategy. It was followed by a detailed sector analysis and studies covering\nvarious aspects of microfinance, which provided the Government with valuable background\ninformation and formed the basis for a continued dialogue with ADB microfinance specialists.\nWith the mushrooming of microcredit schemes and revolving loan funds and their rather limited\nsuccess,  the  Government  is  aware  of  the  need  to  develop  a  common  understanding  of\nmicrofinance  issues  and  to  provide  general  guidelines.  The  conference,  Microfinance  Best\nPractice  in  February  2000  (para.  2),  supported  this  view  and  initiated  the  drafting  of  a\nmicrofinance policy paper, that was discussed at the stakeholder workshop in March 2000. The\ndraft policy paper is in Appendix 4.\n46. At present MFIs are operating in an unregulated environment and without supervision.\nRecent experiences with money pyramid schemes has forced the Government to tighten the\nregulatory framework for financial institutions. While this is an important step toward a sound\nfinancial  sector,  the  increased  capital  requirements  of  $600,000  equivalent  restrict  the\npossibilities of microfinance providers acquiring a banking license and, thus, take deposits. An\nagreement was reached by the stakeholders at the two workshops (para.2) that a regulatory\nand supervisory framework for MFIs needs to be drawn up to facilitate service delivery and to\nsafeguard  clients\u2019  deposits.  The  Project  will  assist  in  drafting  appropriate  legislation  for  a\nregulatory and supervisory framework for MFIs to facilitate sustainable growth of microfinance\nservices while proceeding with the much needed institutional capacity building of MFIs.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n47. Poverty in PNG is an increasing concern of the Government. In 1996, 31 percent of the\npopulation lived below the international poverty line of $1 per capita per day and evidence\nsuggests the situation is worsening. To a large extent this has to be attributed to the incomplete\ntransition from a purely subsistence economy to a modern cash-based economy. The incidence\nof poverty is directly linked to the inability of families to earn cash income to pay for school fees,\nhealth care, and other nonfood items, and to save for future requirements and times of hardship.\n48. The formal private sector can only provide for a small number of jobs. Income-earning\nopportunities  for  the  majority  of  the  population  will  be  in  the  agriculture  sector,  and  in\nestablishing micro and small enterprises in manufacturing and trading. However, the growth of\nthe private sector as a whole, and the micro and small enterprise subsector in particular, is\ninhibited by key factors; (i) lack of vocational and entrepreneurial skills; (ii) deteriorating law and\norder situation; (iii) poor infrastructure, particularly rural roads; and (iv) limited provision and\nrestricted access to financial services.\n49. The  lack  of  vocational  and  entrepreneurial  skills  is  a  serious  constraint  to  the\nestablishment of micro, small, and medium-size enterprises. Most enterprises are not in a\nposition to satisfy required quality standards, reliable delivery, or to offer competitive prices for\ntheir products. Apart from assistance provided by the EU and the AusAID, ADB is providing\nassistance  through  the  Employment-Oriented  Skills  Development  Project.15  Regarding\n                                                \n15 Loan 1706-PNG(SF), Employment-Oriented Skills Development, for SDR14,591,000, approved on 28 October\n1999.", "15\nagricultural production and the need to improve the farming systems of small semisubsistence\nand  cash  crop  farmers,  ADB  is  assisting  through  the  Smallholder  Support  Services  Pilot\nProject.16\n50. The deteriorating law and order situation has been cited as a significant deterrent to\nlocal as well as foreign investment, and adds to the high cost of doing business. As a result,\ncommercial banks have closed many of their branches in the rural and more remote areas.\n51. Poor infrastructure, particularly rural access roads, seriously restricts market access for\nboth agricultural and manufacturing products. Many provinces have no road links to neighboring\nprovinces. Others provinces experience frequent traffic interruptions due to poor maintenance of\nexisting road links. This increases the isolation of rural communities and leads to significant\nlosses in export earnings and business income. Infrastructure improvements feature high on the\nGovernment\u2019s development agenda and receive substantial support from all major bilateral and\nmultilateral assistance agencies. ADB is providing assistance through the Road Upgrading and\nMaintenance Project.17\n52. Limited access to financial services for micro and small enterprises is another major\nimpediment to private sector development (Appendix 2). PNG\u2019s financial system displays an\ninstitutional gap that leaves micro and small enterprises, semisubsistence farmers, and poor\nhouseholds with barely any financial services. Commercial banks cater to the credit needs of\nmedium and large enterprises, and with the exception of PNGBC, offer deposit facilities only to\nformally employed people with a regular salary. Various microfinance schemes have emerged\nover the past 10 years, the majority almost exclusively target poor women in the subsistence\nsector. By December 1999, there were less than 10,000 loans outstanding that can be classified\nas micro loans, in comparison with a potential demand for credit by approximately 255,00018\npotential borrowers (para.15).\n53. In principle there are two institutional strategies to introduce new financial services to\nPNG:  (i)  downscaling  commercial  bank  operations  and  their  products,  and  (ii)  upgrading\nmicrofinance institutions. Both strategies have been discussed with the Government and are\nsupported by the microfinance policy framework currently being prepared. The Project follows\nthis approach and combines both institutional strategies.\n54. To  reduce  the  institutional  gap  and  to  expand  and  strengthen  the  microfinance\ninstitutional landscape, the existing MFIs have to fulfill a dual mission: they have to achieve\nfinancial self-sustainability, as well as increase outreach, both in scale (number of clients) and in\ndepth (service delivery to the lowest income population possible). This will ultimately determine\nthe MFI\u2019s contribution to the economic and social development of PNG. The challenge of an\nMFI consists thus in striking a balance between those two, at first glance opposing, objectives\nkeeping in mind that the level of financial self-sustainability of an MFI will determine the scale of\nits outreach. To be financially viable and to achieve considerable outreach with its services,\nMFIs must possess an adequate institutional capacity. Appendix 3 gives details on the strength\nand weaknesses of MFIs in PNG.\n                                                \n16 Loan 1652-PNG, Smallholder Support Services, for $7.6 million, approved 10 December 1998.\n17 Loan 1709-PNG, Road Upgrading and Maintenance, $63 million, approved on 16 November 1999.\n18These make up one third of the economically active population, which is classified as integrated in the cash\neconomy, self-employed, or engaged in professional farm/fishing.", "16\n55. None  of  the  existing  MFIs  have  the  necessary  institutional  capacity  to  achieve\nsustainability  in  the  near  future.  All  depend  on  seed  money  from  either  Government  or\nassistance  agencies  for  their  lending  operations.  Without  a  banking  license,  MFIs  are  not\npermitted to mobilize savings for onlending and other sources of funds are not available. This\nseverely  restricts  their  operations  in  increasing  outreach  and  achieving  financial  self-\nsustainability.\n56. MFIs are scattered across PNG, and operate in isolation and without a clear perspective.\nIn  comparison  with  Asian  countries,  PNG\u2019s  microfinance  sector  is  at  an  early  stage  of\ndevelopment. The knowledge of microfinance best practice is rather limited and the ability to\ndesign  appropriate  savings  and  loan  products  to  suit  the  needs  of  the  clients  in  PNG  is\nnonexistent. Hence, Grameen Bank replications dominate the microfinance landscape. While\nthere are some promising features in a number of MFIs, none of the existing service providers\nhas emerged as a market leader. All MFIs and microfinance initiatives in PNG require various\nsupport  measures  to  enhance  their  institutional  capacity  to  ensure  sustainable  delivery  of\nmicrofinance services to a large number of micro and small enterprises, and to provide savings\nfacilities to the poor and currently unserved population segment. The Government is aware of\nthe shortcomings, is proceeding with the finalization of the microfinance policy, and has asked\nthat the Project foster the development of the microfinance sector.\nB. Objective and Scope\n57. The  overall  objective  is  to  contribute  to  economic  growth  through  private  sector\ndevelopment, employment creation, and development of the financial system. The goal is to\nreduce  poverty  and  integrate  the  majority  of  the  poor19  into  the  mainstream  development\nprocess. The Project\u2019s specific objective is to provide sustainable microfinance services to\nviable formal and informal enterprises, and savings services to the population at large.\n58. The Project comprises three main components: component A, capacity building of MFIs\nthrough  a  microfinance  competence  center;  component  B,  development,  testing,  and\nimplementation of new savings and loan products and delivery methods; C, establishment of a\nrevolving  finance  facility  (RFF)  for  MFIs.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  establish  a  project\nimplementation unit (PIU) to support the implementation of the three components.\n59. The Project, through these three components, will build the institutional capacity of\nvarious providers of microfinance services, who are the Project\u2019s institutional target group. In\nturn these MFIs, enabled to deliver sustainable services, will provide small business loans20 for\nworking capital and investment purposes to micro and small enterprises, particularly in rural\nareas, where the vast majority of MFIs are operating. Savings services will be available to\nhouseholds in rural areas, where the majority of the poor live.\n1.  Microfinance Competence Center (Component A)\n60.  The Project will assist the Government to establish a microfinance competence center\n(MCC) within IBBM to enhance the institutional capacity of potentially sustainable MFIs. These\ninclude banklike institutions, e.g., SLSs and VFL, and nonregulated financial institutions, e.g.,\nNGO  and  government-run  microfinance  and  microcredit  schemes,  ROSCAS,  and  informal\n                                                \n19 The Project targets poor households that earn cash income from horticultural and agricultural production, and  from\n    running a small business. These account for 75.5 percent of the poor population.  \n20 The average loan amount of each MFI portfolio will not exceed $2,000.", "17\ncommunity savings groups. The MCC will set up a network of existing microfinance service\nproviders and thereby create a forum for policy implementation. By establishing the MCC the\nProject will institutionalize local capacity building needed to provide the required expertise and\ntechnical skills to expand financial services. The MCC will provide the following services:\n(i)  Public  awareness  and  public  relations  activities  will  be  developed  for  all\nmicrofinance  service  providers  and  their  potential  clients.  Emphasis  will  be\nplaced  on  developing  internal  communication  mechanisms  between  existing\nservice providers, through the formation of an MFI network. Through schools and\nother existing community channels, the network will publicize the basic concepts\nof  banking  and  the  benefits  of  savings,  and  advertise  the  availability  of\nmicrofinance  services.  The  MCC  will  assist  MFIs  in  conceptualizing  public\nrelations strategies.\n(ii)  In-house training courses will broaden the understanding of microfinance and\nimprove the technical and organization skills of MFI staff involved in providing\nmicrofinance services. Study tours and in-country conferences and workshops\nwill facilitate upgrading of MFIs.\n(iii)  On-site TA and training will be designed to suit the specific requirements of an\nMFI, ranging from start-up assistance for newly formed MFIs, support programs\nto achieve sustainability of operations, specific assistance geared to expand\nservices, to guidance in the formalization process to acquire the status of a\nformal financial institution.\n(iv)  A consultative process between the network of MFIs and BPNG will be initiated\nand facilitated to establish a regulatory and supervisory framework for MFIs.\n(v)  A rating system for microfinance service providers will be designed on the basis\nof internationally accepted best practices. MCC staff will be trained to carry out\nthe MFI assessments. The rating determines if an MFI will have access to the\nRFF (component C of the Project).\n61. The Project will (i) provide international and domestic expertise, computer equipment,\ntraining materials, and upgrading of trainers to establish the MCC; and (ii) finance in-house\ntraining and on-site consultancies for MFIs, as well as study tours, workshops, and conferences;\nand support MCC management to develop a business plan and a strategy to achieve financial\nviability by the end of project implementation.\n2.  New Savings and Loan Products (Component B)\n62. This component will develop and test new savings and loan products and delivery\nmethods for financial services, and will support MFIs in implementing them. Specific attention\nwill be given to linking community savings groups with financial institutions. A pilot test will\ninvolve downscaling commercial banks. Microfinance products oriented to target groups will be\ndesigned,  and  MFIs  will  be  advised  on  appropriate  delivery  mechanisms.  One  pilot\nmicrobanking scheme will be designed, and established and operated in Wau, a remote town in\nMomase, PNG\u2019s poorest region. The Project will provide international expertise, equipment, and\ntraining to develop, test, and implement new savings and loan products, and equity for the pilot\nmicrobanking scheme.  Specifically, the Project will\n(i)  establish dialogue between commercial banks and informal savings groups, and\ndesign detailed linkage modalities;\n(ii)  advise MFIs on appropriate microfinance products;", "18\n(iii)  identify  commercial  banks  interested  in  providing  microfinance  services,  and\nprovide support in downscaling products and delivery methodologies;\n(iv)  design tailor-made savings and loan products for MFIs, and provide support and\nbackstopping to MFIs during initial implementation;\n(v)  design delivery mechanisms and marketing concepts for microfinance products\naddressing specific target groups;\n(vi)  monitor the performance of the delivery methods and disseminated information to\nthe MFI network; and\n(vii)  establish, operate, and document one pilot microbanking scheme.\n63. Downscaling of commercial banks requires a variety of institution-building measures to\n(i) overcome the significant cultural gap between the formal financial sector and the boundaries\nof economic life of the rural population, and (ii) link business practices of the traditional economy\nwith the principles of modern banking. Communities and community leaders must be actively\ninvolved to provide information on borrowers, which is otherwise not available to formal banks.\nThis underscores the need to develop a lending technology that takes into account a client\u2019s\nwhole  socioeconomic  environment.  The  creation  of  VFL  by  PNGBC  is  one  example  of\ndownscaling.  Latin  American  countries  are  at  the  forefront  of  successfully  downscaling\ncommercial banks; some examples can also be found in Asia.\n64. The pilot microbanking scheme will demonstrate the application of new savings and loan\nproducts and delivery mechanisms, based on international best practice and modified to PNG\u2019s\nspecific  requirements.  All  stages  of  the  development  process  of  the  pilot  scheme  will  be\ndocumented in detail to be used as a guide for new MFIs.\n3.  Revolving Finance Facility (Component C)\n65. This component will establish the RFF, which will provide the necessary funding for MFIs\nto achieve sustainability and expand their loan portfolios. Credit lines and equipment loans will\nbe made available to eligible MFIs for onlending to micro and small enterprises. The project\ninputs  comprise  short-term  international  expertise  to  finalize  the  details  of  these  financial\ninstruments during the first eight months of project implementation, subject to approval by ADB,\nand  prior  to  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds  to  the  RFF.  The  RFF  will  be  set  up  with\ncontributions from the Government (60 percent) and ADB loan proceeds (40 percent).\n66. To access the RFF, MFIs must meet the following eligibility criteria: (i) registration with\nthe MCC and satisfactory rating (not older than six months) issued by the MCC; (ii) satisfactory\nloan repayments, as established by an on-time repayment rate of at least 85 percent; (iii) a\ndetailed plan for operational and financial self-sufficiency with a strategy for improvements over\nthe next year and agreed performance targets; (iv) adequate management information and\naccounting systems in place to ensure successful expansion, efficiency improvements, and\nsatisfactory performance of the loan portfolio; and (v) average loan amount of the MFI portfolio\nto be funded does not exceed K5,000 ($2,000). The maximum exposure of the RFF to one\nsingle MFI will not exceed 40 percent.\n67. The conditions of credit lines are (i) credit lines to MFIs are made available in kina or in\ndollars provided the MFI is able\u2014on the discretion of the management agent\u2014to hedge the\nrelated foreign exchange risk; (ii) for credit lines extended in dollars the interest rate will be the\napplicable  3-month  LIBOR21  plus  a  reasonable  margin  to  cover  costs,  and  for  credit  lines\n                                                \n21  LIBOR = London interbank offered rate.", "19\ncontracted in kina the interest rate will be the most recent kina auction rate 22  plus a reasonable\nmargin to cover costs; (iii) interest rates are payable on a monthly basis over the outstanding\nbalance; (iv) a penalty fee is charged in the event of late interest payments (arrears of more than\n30 days) of an additional 3 percent per annum; (v) a commitment fee of 0.25 percent per month is\npayable by the respective MFI to the RFF for contracted but not yet disbursed balances of the\ncredit line; (vi) maximum maturity of the credit lines is 5 years; and (vii) maximum credit line\namounts are determined by the management agent on the basis of MFIs\u2019 stage of development.\nThe conditions of the credit lines are subject to periodic review by the management agent.\nModifications of the conditions and the change of the interest rate are subject to approval by the\nmicrofinance steering committee (MSC).\n68. The MFIs will apply the following conditions for onlending to micro and small enterprises:\n(i) only business loans will be extended; (ii) the maximum maturity for loans to be used for working\ncapital is up to 12 months and for fixed assets, equipment, or livestock (investment loans) up to\nthree years; (ii) loans are only granted in kina; (iii) the interest rate will be the kina auction rate of\nthe BPNG plus a margin to be defined by the MFI on the basis of market rates ensuring the\nfinancial sustainability of the respective MFI.\n69. BPNG, the Implementing Agency, will hold the funds of the RFF in a separate account,\nsimilar to previous arrangements with the World Bank and the EU. It will outsource the day-to-\nday management of the RFF to a private sector management agent, e.g., a private finance\ninstitution or other relevant private entity based in PNG. The selection of the management agent\nwill be in accordance with competitive procedures acceptable to ADB. This guarantees the\nnecessary independence, as well as efficient management of the funds. It also underscores the\nintended private sector orientation of microfinance in general and of this Project in particular.\nThe management agent will be paid on a fixed fee basis and will carry out the following tasks: (i)\nfinancial management of the funds; (ii) administration of the RFF\u2019s financial instruments; (iii)\nmonitoring of MFI performance ensuring that performance targets are met; and (iv) quarterly\nreporting to BPNG on performance of the RFF and the participating MFIs. The detailed terms of\nreference for the management contract will be finalized during the first six months of project\nimplementation. Detailed procedures for reporting and auditing will be put in place to ensure\ntransparency of operations.\n70. ADB will disburse the first installment of $280,00023 direct to a special account managed\nby the management agent under the supervision of BPNG, provided the following conditions are\nfulfilled: (i) a management contract (approved by ADB) has been signed and is legally effective\nbetween  PBNG  and  the  management  agency,  and  (ii)  a  model  agreement  for  onlending\nbetween the management agent and MFIs has been approved by BPNG and ADB. Appendix 5\nprovides details on the implementation arrangements.\n4.  Project Management\n71. In support of the Executing and Implementing Agencies and to facilitate successful\nimplementation of the three components, the Project will (i) build the capacity of the PIU by\n                                                \n22 The kina auction facility is a monetary management instrument introduced on 1 May 1995 in which BPNG can\naccept deposits (buy kina) from commercial banks or lend (sell kina) to the commercial banks. BPNG announces\nthe auction volume and the rate (kina auction rate) is determined by the market through competitive bidding.  The\nrate is a weighted average of the successful bids received and allocated.\n23 The first installment is 10 percent of ADB\u2019s total contribution of $2.8 million and is the initial contemplated level of\ndisbursement to MFIs within the first three months of operation of the RFF. The total amount of the RFF is $7\nmillion.  ADB loan proceeds contribute 40 percent and the Government 60 percent to the RFF.", "20\nengaging domestic consultants, and (ii) establish a project monitoring and evaluation system\nand a management information system for components A and B. Office furniture, computer, and\nother office equipment and transport will be provided to ensure that the PIU is able to carry out\nthese activities.\nC. Cost Estimates\n72. The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  taxes  and  duties  and  interest  during  project\nimplementation, is estimated at $20.5 million equivalent.

The Government has asked ADB to provide a loan of $9.6 million equivalent, or about 47\npercent of the total project cost, from its Special Funds resources. The loan would bear a 32-year\nmaturity, including a grace period of 8 years, and 1 percent interest charge during the grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent thereafter.\n74. AusAID will provide grant cofinancing to be administered by ADB, specifically for the pilot\nmicrobanking in Wau and training under the MCC. In the event that AusAID grant financing is not\nforthcoming, the Government will make arrangements to obtain the additional funding from other\nsources.", "21\nTable 4: Financing Plan\n($\u2019000)\nSource Foreign Local Total Cost\nExchange Currency\nAmount % Amount % Amount %\nGovernment - -   4,669 41.0 4,669 22.8\nBank of PNG     11   0.1      423   3.7    434   2.1\nInstitute of Banking     78   0.9   1,147 10.1 1,225   6.0\nMFIsa    396   4.3   3,284 28.9 3,680 17.9\nAusAID    594   6.5      315   2.8    909   4.4\nADBb 8,054 88.2   1,541 13.5 9,595 46.8\nTotal Project Cost 9,133 44.5 11,379 55.5 20,512 100.0\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, MFIs = microfinance\ninstitutions, PNG = Papua New Guinea.\na The contributions from the MFIs refer to their recurrent costs in expanding their operations and staffing levels as a\n   result of capacity building under the Project.\nb  Including interest during project implementation. Figures may not add up to total due to rounding.\nE. The Executing Agency\n75. BPNG will be the Executing Agency for the Project. It will be responsible for the overall\ncoordination and implementation of the Project. Although BPNG has been involved in various\nexternally  funded  projects  and  has  the  knowledge  and  skills  to  oversee  implementation,  its\nresource capacity is limited. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency in project coordination\nand  management,  the  Project  will  support  two  domestic  consultants  to  work  as  the  project\nmanager and project assistant. The project organizational structure is in Appendix 7.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Microfinance Steering Committee\n76. A microfinance steering committee (MSC),24 with broad stakeholder representation, will\nprovide overall policy guidance and coordinate activities between national, provincial, and local\nlevel government agencies, MFIs, nonfinancial service providers, and private sector stakeholder\ngroups.  The  MSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  governor,  BPNG,  and  will  include  one  senior\nrepresentative each of the Department of Finance and Treasury, Department of National Planning\nand Monitoring, IBBM, nonfinancial service providers,25 the private sector/MFI clients, and two\nrepresentatives from MFIs. The MSC will oversee project planning, organization, administration,\nimplementation, and monitoring. The MSC will meet as often as required, but at least once every\nthree months.\n2.  Implementing Agencies\n77. Components A and B will be implemented by IBBM with the support of short- and long-\nterm international consulting (122 person-months) and domestic consulting/on-site trainers (120\nperson-months). IBBM will provide a director for the MCC and initially four counterpart staff, with\nthe possibility of increasing the number to six during project implementation. IBBM will provide\n                                                \n24 The MSC is the project steering committee. It was established prior to board consideration.\n25 The representing institution will be nominated by the Department of Trade and Industry.", "22\noffice space, administrative support, training and conference facilities, and equipment. Office\nsupplies and communication costs will be borne to a maximum of $25,000 equivalent during\nproject implementation. The MFIs will contribute to training activities by making relevant staff\navailable and providing their related transport and other costs. A project agreement between\nIBBM, BPNG, and ADB details project implementation arrangements.\n78. Component C will be implemented by BPNG. With the support of international consulting\n(12 person-months), the RFF modalities will be finalized. BPNG will provide counterpart staff,\noffice space and supplies, communication facilities, access to computer equipment, and transport\nto the consultant. The RFF management will be contracted out to a private finance institution or\nother  relevant  entity.  The  tender  documents  and  management  contract,  including  the\nmanagement fee, will be prepared and the RFF will be established within the first eight months of\nloan effectiveness. The management fee will be paid from the income generated by the facility.\nThe management agent of the RFF will report to and be answerable to BPNG. BPNG will contract\nan auditing firm acceptable to ADB to carry out annual auditing of the RFF.\n3.  Project Implementation Unit\n79. The PIU will be established by BPNG within one month after loan effectiveness and will be\nphysically located on IBBM premises.26  With MSC guidance, the PIU will handle the day-to-day\nproject administration and implementation matters of components A and B, and prepare loan\nwithdrawal applications and consolidate other relevant documentation for component C. The PIU\nwill provide and facilitate delivery of the required goods and services to the different components\nand  activities  of  the  Project.  It  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  national  project  manager  with\nextensive administrative experience, at a senior level, and knowledge of the PNG financial sector.\nThe project manager together with a project assistant form the PIU.\n80.  The PIU\u2019s tasks will include (i) liaising with ADB and other stakeholders; (ii) carrying out\nproject budgeting and accounting, preparing loan withdrawal applications, and submitting audited\naccounts to ADB; (iii) recruiting and supervising consultants; (iv) procuring equipment and other\ninputs; (v) preparing (including consolidating data) and submitting quarterly and other reports, the\nproject midterm review, and the project completion report on a timely basis; and (vi) providing\nsecretariat  services  to  the  MSC.  IBBM  will  provide  office  space,  access  to  communication\nfacilities, and accounting services, and lend general support to the PIU. The Project will support\nproject implementation costs, including equipment and operating costs until project completion.\n4.  Implementation Schedule\n81. The Project will be implemented over five years and be completed by mid-2006. The\nimplementation schedule is summarized in Appendix 8. To minimize possible delays during\nimplementation, detailed procedures and the time frame for each of the main project activities\nhave been discussed and agreed to by all parties and ADB.\n5.  Procurement of Goods and Services\n82. Procurement arrangements have been discussed extensively with BPNG. All procurement\nunder the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The PIU will be responsible for all\nprocurement related to its establishment and operation. Vehicles, computer equipment, and other\noffice equipment will be procured subject to international shopping procedures. Furniture, training\n                                                \n26 The Government selected a project manager prior to board consideration.", "23\nmaterials, and related service contracts, each below $100,000 equivalent, will be awarded on\nthe basis of the direct purchase procedure. Details are in Appendix 9.\n6.  Consulting Services\n83. All  consultants  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the\nengagement of domestic consultants. A total of 144 person-months of international consulting\nservices will be provided by a microbanking adviser, a curriculum development and training\nspecialist for component A; a microfinance product development specialist and microfinance\ninstitutional  development  specialist  for  component  B;  and  a  finance  facility  specialist  for\ncomponent C. The international consultants will be engaged as a team from a firm. Individual\ndomestic consultants (240 person-months) will be engaged for project management and the\nimplementation of on-site training and counseling of MFIs. A summary of consulting services,\nincluding domestic consulting, is shown in Appendix 10.\n7.  Advance Action\n84. To expedite implementation of the Project, advance action for the selection of consultants\nunder the Project has been approved. No retroactive financing is envisaged; accordingly, ADB will\nnot finance any expenditure incurred prior to loan effectiveness. The Government has been\ninformed that ADB approval of such advance action does not imply any commitment on the part of\nADB to approve the project loan.\n8.  Disbursements and Imprest Account\n85. To  expedite  project  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  funds,  an  imprest\naccount  will  be  established  with  PNGBC.  Government  contributions  to  the  Project  will  be\nmaintained in a separate counterpart account. Items eligible for financing under the imprest\naccount are the local currency expenditures (including indirect foreign exchange costs, and small\nforeign exchange expenditures). BPNG, through the PIU, will operate, manage, replenish, and\nliquidate the imprest account in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. In view of\nthe large number of small contracts involved, statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will be\nused for all categories covered by the imprest account. The initial amount to be deposited into the\nimprest account will not exceed the equivalent of $200,000. After the initial deposit, the account\nwill be simultaneously liquidated and replenished on a regular basis to ensure that sufficient funds\nare always available. Disbursement of loan proceeds of $125,000 for equity for the microbanking\npilot will be made directly and in one installment at the beginning of project implementation.\nDisbursements of loan proceeds to the RFF will be made directly and in installments spaced over\nthe project implementation period. Conditions for loan disbursement to the RFF are in para. 110.\nSubsequent disbursements from the RFF to the MFIs will be made according to procedures and\ncriteria agreed to by the Government and ADB, which will be finalized within the first eight months\nof loan effectiveness. Details are given in Appendix 5.\n86. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure will not\nexceed the equivalent of $20,000. Detailed arrangements for the establishment and operation of\nthe imprest account and the SOE procedure will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan\nDisbursement Handbook.", "24\n9.  Accounting and Auditing\n87. The Government, acting through BPNG, will maintain consistent records and accounts\nadequate to identify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loan. BPNG will\n(i) maintain separate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and related financial\nstatements  are  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  principles  by  auditors\nacceptable to ADB; and (iii) submit to ADB, not later than six months after the close of each fiscal\nyear, certified copies of the audited accounts and the report of the auditor. This includes separate\nannual audit reports on the use of the imprest account and SOE. Loan funding of $80,000 for\nauditing and project-related costs of the Auditor General\u2019s Office has been included in the Project.\nThe auditor\u2019s selection and engagement for such services will be in accordance with competitive\nselection procedures acceptable to ADB.\n10.  Reporting\n88. The PIU will prepare quarterly progress reports for the Project for the periods ending 31\nMarch, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December each year, and will submit them to ADB not\nlater than 30 days after the end of the relevant period. The reports will be in a format acceptable to\nADB  and  include  (i) progress  made  against  established  targets,  including  quality  aspects;\n(ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken or proposed to resolve problems; (iii)\ncompliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed programs of activities to be undertaken during the\nnext  three  months;  and  (v) expected  progress  during  the  succeeding  period.  The  focus  will\nnormally  be  on  routine  project  monitoring  and  hence  on  input  indicators  from  the  project\nmanagement information system. In addition, the PIU will produce a report on the results of the\nmidterm review and a project completion report for submission to ADB not later than three months\nfollowing physical completion of the Project. The PIU will also submit to ADB all reports produced\nby consultants under the Project.\n11.  Reviews\n89. Because of the importance of the Project and its linkages with ongoing ADB projects, ADB\nwill devote special attention to project performance. ADB will review progress through quarterly\nprogress reports and regular review missions. In addition, special reviews will be undertaken by\nthe Government and ADB (i) prior to loan disbursement to the RFF, (ii) after 30 months of project\nimplementation with regard to the business and sustainability plan for the MCC, and (iii) at such\nother intervals as the Government and ADB may agree. These special reviews will assess the\nstatus and achievements of the Project in relation to its objectives, focusing on key project\nindicators, and will identify remedial actions needed. Participatory stakeholder workshops form an\nintegrated part of these review missions.\n12.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation\n90. The PIU will establish a performance monitoring and evaluation system, further detailing\nthe qualitative and quantitative indicators specified in the project framework, within six months of\nloan effectiveness. These will be used to monitor project activities and achievements; be related\nto the corresponding specific project objectives, outputs, and activities outlined in Appendix 1; and\nconsist of progress and impact indicators.  Monitoring procedures will be refined, finalized, and\nagreed upon with ADB within the first year of project implementation.", "25\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n91. The Project is classified in environmental category C. Environmental implications were\nreviewed and no adverse impacts were identified. The micro and small enterprise sector in PNG\ncomprises labor intensive businesses with low energy-use investments, a large percentage of\nwhich are in trading of agricultural produce and imported nonfood items, as well as repair and\nmaintenance services. The survey of micro and small enterprises (para. 2) provides evidence\nthat microenterpises manufacture goods by recycling waste products, using local raw materials,\nand preserving perishables. Details on the micro and small enterprise sector are in Appendix 2.\nThe  training  provided  by  the  MCC  to  the  microfinance  service  providers  will  incorporate\nsensitization of environmental issues to be considered when assessing loan applications of\nmicro and small enterprises.\n2.  Social and Participatory Measures\n92. The  project  design  is  based  on  a  participatory  approach.  Project  preparation\ncommenced with the conference, Microfinance Best Practice (para. 2). The conference attracted\nwide interest and more than 90 people paid their way to take part.  The participants included\nrepresentatives from various well-known and less-known27 microfinance providers, national and\nprovincial government agencies and departments, women\u2019s groups, informal savings groups,\nSLSs, the central bank, commercial banks, IBBM, private sector representatives, and bilateral\nand multilateral assistance agencies. This provided a first indication of the extent of interest\nplaced  on  microfinance  in  PNG.  It  was  at  this  conference  that  the  need  to  formulate  a\nmicrofinance policy for the country was expressed; a committee was appointed to prepare a first\ndraft for discussion at the participatory project planning workshop.\n93. The goal-oriented project planning method (footnote 2) was used during the five-day\nparticipatory project planning workshop, which marked the end of the TA. The project concept\nwas discussed in detail and the participants agreed on all aspects of the project design. This\nprocess built trust and confidence among Government and microfinance practitioners, and laid\nthe foundation for project ownership.\n94. Social analysis was undertaken in the course of project preparation. It confirmed that the\npopulation strata in most need of microfinance services consists of the poorer households in\nurban and particularly rural areas. The Project applies a self-targeting mechanism (para. 105) to\nreach  these  beneficiaries.  An  analysis  of  the  micro  and  small  enterprise  sector  and  their\nperceived credit needs was also undertaken as part of the TA. It confirmed that this segment of\nthe private sector is neither served by commercial banks, which perceive them as high-risk\ncustomers with no bankable collateral, nor by the currently operating credit schemes, which\nprovide credit mainly to underprivileged women. In actual fact, the loans provided by the MFIs\noften do more harm than good, as the loans are usually restricted to K500 or less, and there is\nno flexibility for MFIs to provide loans based on the business requirements of the borrower.\nBecause these amounts only partially cover the needed working capital and investment costs,\nthis often delays and even prevents the borrower from actually starting their business. This does\n                                                \n27 These include the VNN Saving Society in East New Britain Province and revolving loan schemes initiated by the\nprovincial governments of Milne Bay and Western Province.", "26\nnot imply that small loans are counterproductive. The loan amounts have to correspond with the\ncapital  requirements  of  the  microenterprise,  working  and/or  investment  capital,  to  avoid\nundercapitalization.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial  and Economic Analyses\n1.  Financial Viability\n95. The  project  strategy  chosen  to  provide  microfinance  services  in  PNG  focuses  on\ninstitutional capacity building. The three project components are designed to upgrade existing\nMFIs and to establish new MFIs, which are the institutional beneficiaries of the Project. The\nProject will strengthen at least 40 microfinance service providers during project implementation,\nand through these, reach a minimum of 45,000 clients. The average maximum loan size of each\nparticipating MFI is set at $2,000.\n96. The participating MFIs will be strengthened to reach the following targets during project\nimplementation:\n(i)  satisfactory loan repayment:  >85 percent,\n(ii)  portfolio at risk maximum level:  <10 percent,\n(iii)  average savings accounts growth rate:  >30 percent,\n(iv)  average lending activities growth rate:  >25 percent,\n(v)  staff productivity (outstanding loans/loan officer):  >100,\n(vi)  operating self-sufficiency:  within 5 years, and\n(vii)  financial self-sufficiency:  within 7 years\n97. These  performance  criteria  and  targets  for  MFIs  follow  international  standards  in\nmicrofinance. The Project will assist MFIs to reach these targets, and thus reach financial\nviability. Details are provided in Appendix 5.\n2.  Sustainability\n98. The objective of the Project is to provide sustainable microfinance services. This will be\nachieved through a number of measures, that form an integrated part of the project design. The\nassistance provided by the MCC to existing and new microfinance service providers is geared to\nachieve financial viability (para. 95). The process of achieving this goal will be closely monitored\nby  MCC,  and  tailor-made  training  packages  will  help  to  overcome  identified  institutional\nweaknesses.\n99. The scope of component A, the establishment of the MCC, stipulates that the MCC must\n(i)  prepare  a  full-fledged  business  plan  within  the  first  two  and  half  years  of  project\nimplementation, and (ii) provide a detailed strategy to achieve financial viability by the end of\nproject implementation. Possible strategies to be explored in detail include user-pay initiatives\nand expansion and marketing of services to MFIs in other Pacific island countries. The Project\nwill assist the MCC in this process. Appendix 1 and 5 provide details.\n100. The  new  savings  and  loan  products,  which  will  be  developed  and  tested  under\ncomponent B.1 of the Project, form part of the services renders by MFIs. The Project will ensure\nthat only viable savings and loan products, and delivery mechanism will be implemented. The", "27\nestablishment of pilot microbanking under component B.2 serves as demonstration and will\nbreak-even after seven months of operation.\n101. The RFF, component C of the Project, has to achieve a positive return on capital after\nthe first year of operation. This requires the RFF to charge MFIs an interest rate, that (i) covers\nadministrative and management costs, (ii) provides for defaulted loans, and (iii) and is above the\nnational inflation rate. These guidelines will ensure that the funds are fully protected and the\nRFF  becomes  a  self-sustainable  revolving  fund  and  continues  operation  also  after  project\ncompletion.\n3.  Economic Analysis\n102. An economic rate of return for the Project is difficult to quantify as the beneficiaries and\nend-users of the microfinance services, particularly the micro and small enterprises, cannot\naccurately be determined at this stage. The MFIs will assess the viability of the micro and small\nenterprise investments based on sound economic principles. The know-how to carry out these\nassessments will be transferred from the MCC, and the training provided by the Project.\n103. The number of project beneficiaries, or borrowers of MFIs, and the respective type of\nmicro and small enterprises to be financed will ultimately be determined by market forces and\ncannot  be  forecast  with  confidence.  However,  benefit-cost  analysis  of  some  typical\nmicroenterpises was carried as part of the TA (footnote 1). These include smallholder farming,\nhoney  and  poultry  production,  trading  of  agricultural  products  and  seafood,  sewing,  small\nrestaurants, rural and urban food stalls, and trading of secondhand clothes. Production costs\nand production values are based on the information provided by the owners/operators of the\nmicroenterpises and reflect only cash transactions in an annual production cycle. The majority\nof these sample microenterpises have been in operation for 3\u20138 years. The production costs\ninclude hired labor, raw materials, transport, and other cash expenditures, but exclude \u201cfree\u201d\nfamily labor, cost of the owner/operator of the microenterprise, and depreciation of equipment.\nThe cost of land is only included if it is leased. Based on this, microenterpises display attractive\nbenefit-cost ratios between 7 percent and 24 percent. Given the short period of the production\ncycles, the total impact of these investments on the economy should be high.\nB.  Impact on Poverty\n104. The assessment of poverty and the development of interventions to reduce poverty\nrequire a multidimensional approach in which access to cash income or equivalent economic\nbenefits  is  a  major  part.  The  Project  will  facilitate  this  process  by  providing  microfinance\nservices to establish and expand micro and small enterprises, particularly in rural areas where\nthe  majority  of  MFIs  operate.  This  will  create  much-needed  employment  opportunities,\nparticularly in rural areas, with a direct effect on poverty. Through the enhanced growth of the\nmicro and small enterprise sector, goods and services will be more accessible, particularly for\nthe poorer strata of the population.\n105. A self-targeting mechanism will ensure that MFIs provide services to the poor. The loan\nportfolio of each MFI participating in the Project is limited to a maximum average loan size of\nK5,000, or approximately $2,000. Ninety-five percent of the loans will be in the range of $200 to\n$400. Only a small number of loans, mainly for equipment and transport, will exceed the\nmaximum average of K5,000. The portfolio mix, even though dominated by microloans, will\nsupport MFIs in reaching financial sustainability, while providing services to the poor.", "28\n106. The Project will also provide savings facilities to poor households currently unserved,\nand hence, enable them to securely accumulate resources for times of hardship. The targeted\nclientele for loan and saving products represent 75 percent of the poor in PNG. They comprise\nhouseholds that are part of the cash economy and earn income from tree crops, commercial\nagriculture, micro and small businesses, and wage employment (para.5).\n107. The project design is based on a process approach, which will enable MFIs to increase\ntheir outreach and provide services to segments of the population otherwise unserved. It will\nprovide microfinance services to at least 45,000 people. The socioeconomic impact and the\nachievement of this target will be closely and continuously monitored to enable timely corrective\nmeasures to be taken if necessary.\nC.  Risks\n108.  The key risks to successful project implementation and the achievement of the project\nobjective were identified by the stakeholders during the participatory project planning workshop.\nThey include the following:\n(i)  Political stability and consistency of Government policies are a major concern\nand have a considerable influence on private investments. The current situation\nis considered to more stable than in previous years, and the current Government\nmakes considerable efforts to assure the business community that it will continue\nin its current direction.\n(ii)  During previous years, agricultural production was seriously affected by natural\ndisasters. As the majority of the rural population rely to various degrees on\nfarming, for subsistence and cash income, the loss of a harvest can have a\ndetrimental effect on the portfolio of microfinance service providers. While natural\ndisasters  cannot  be  avoided,  encouraging  the  establishment  of  nonfarming\nactivities will spread the risks for the borrower as well as the lender.\n(iii)  High inflation rates with corresponding high interest rates have a negative impact\non private sector investments. MFIs stress that their potential clients are less\nlikely to borrow when interest rates are perceived to be high.\n(iv)  The development of viable micro and small enterprises does not only depend on\nthe  availability  of  financial  services.  Nonfinancial  services,  e.g.,  business\ncounseling,  training  and  marketing  information,  and  business  linkages  are\nequally important. The provision of these services has been irregular in the past.\nThe Small Business Development Corporation, a major provider of nonfinancial\nservices throughout PNG, was abolished in 1999 only to be revived in 2000.28\nThe  risk  of  losing  these  services  again  can  be  reduced  through  continuous\nlobbying by the business community.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n109. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n                                                \n28The previous government abolished the Small Business Development Corporation in 1998 due to budgetary\nconstraints. The current Government, elected in 1999, reversed this decision and reinstated the corporation.", "29\n(i)  timely and regular (a) requests for budgetary appropriations will be made for the\ncounterpart  funding  requirements  of  the  Project  during  each  year  of  project\nimplementation; and (b) release of appropriated funds will be made to facilitate\nproject implementation;\n(ii)  for external training financed under the Project, that the relevant institutions are\nselected and engaged in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB, taking\ninto account considerations of economy and efficiency;\n(iii)  it will (a) adopt a microfinance policy statement in accordance with international\nbest practice in microfinance, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, no later\nthan  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness;  (b)  within  12  months  of  loan\neffectiveness,  submit  to  ADB  for  review,  draft  legislation  or  implementing\nregulations, as necessary to establish a regulatory framework for microfinance;\nand (c) within 24 months of loan effectiveness, enact such legislation and issue\nthe relevant regulations, as applicable;\n(iv)  within 6 months of loan effectiveness, BPNG will establish a project monitoring\nand evaluation system based on specified performance indicators to be agreed\nwith ADB and, within 12 months of loan effectiveness, refine the system in a\nmanner satisfactory to ADB.\nB.  Conditions for Loan Disbursement\n110. No withdrawals will be made from the loan account:\n(i) for any initial contribution to the RFF under component C of the Project until (a)\nBPNG has selected and engaged a management agent to manage, administer,\nand operate the RFF in accordance with an agreement satisfactory to ADB and\ncompetitive selection procedures acceptable to ADB; and (b) the operational\nprocedures and guidelines for the RFF, including MFI eligibility criteria, and the\nterms and conditions of model onlending agreements between MFIs and the\nRFF, have been agreed to by BPNG and ADB; and\n(ii)  for any subsequent contribution to the RFF under component C of the Project\nuntil an amount of not less than 70 percent of the previous contributions to the\nRFF from the loan proceeds and the corresponding counterpart contribution to\nthe RFF by the Government is disbursed to the MFIs. For these purposes, each\ncontribution to the RFF will be funded under the loan and through corresponding\ncounterpart  contributions  in  the  proportions  of  40  percent  and  60  percent,\nrespectively, up to an aggregate amount of $7,000,000 equivalent.\nVII.

Defining Micro and Small Enterprises in Papua New Guinea\n1. Based on the assumption that the priorities of the Government of Papua New Guinea\n(PNG) for micro and small enterprise (MSE) development relate to economic factors and the\nstrengthening of the private sector, the definitions and guidelines were developed (Table A2.1):\nTable A2.1: Defining Guidelines for Micro and Small Enterprise Sector in PNG\nEnterprise Definition/Guidelines Rationale\nMicroenterprise Any  commercial  enterprise  that  is While this definition captures a large\nundertaken  on  a  regular  basis, number of entrepreneurs that would\ninvolving  annual  sales  between not be included in a targeted credit or\n$2,400 - $16,000 per annum. business assistance program, the\nregular commercial activity criteria\nwould exclude part-time\nentrepreneurs. The upper limit of\n$16,000 turnover is arbitrary but this\ncould be regarded as a realistic\ndividing line in PNG (that should be\nincreased over time).\nSmall Businesses A  permanent  commercial  enterprise Incorporation should not be used as a\n(whether formally incorporated or not) criterion, as most small businesses in\nwith an annual turnover of between PNG are not incorporated. The upper\n$16,000 - $80,000 per annum. income level is a more appropriate\ncriterion. Due to the inflationary\npressures in PNG, a turnover of close\nto $240,000 per annum  now\nrepresents a small business.  It should\nalso be appreciated that many small\nbusinesses, even with a turnover in\nexcess of $160,000, find it difficult to\nsecure credit from a commercial bank.\n.\n2. These definitions are provided as a guideline. The division between microenterprise and\nsmall businesses becomes academic if a single business assistance package is provided for\nthis sector of the economy.  Under such a scenario, the key issues are the separation of\nmicroenterpises  from  informal  entities  and,  in  turn,  small  businesses  from  medium-sized\nenterprises.\nB.

In  comparison  with  standards  of  international  best  practice  (Table  A3.1),  the\nperformance of microfinance providers in PNG lags in all areas. Table A3.2 gives an overview of\nPNG microfinance providers.\n3. The average loan size range from K281 to K3,067. According to different sources, the\nactual demand for microcredit lies in the range of K500 (working capital) up to K30,000 (fixed\nassets). The bottom end of less than K300 as an average loan size is the result of credit\nschemes that target start-up businesses in the subsistence sector. These low credit amounts do\nnot, on average, necessarily reflect the low income group that is served. They are sometimes\nthe result of rationing the credit supply due to an excess of demand while there is a shortage of\nseed capital.\n4. The average deposit balance lies between K39 and K662. Licensed financial institutions\nrequire normally an opening balance around K20, whereas most of the microcredit schemes\napply compulsory group accounts with minimal weekly contributions per group member.\n5. The existing microcredit schemes are almost exclusively targeting women, which is the\nresult  of  the  Grameen  Bank  lending  methodology  that  is  wide-spread  in  PNG.

While the potential demand for microcredit is about 300,000 borrowers for all of PNG, the\nanalyzed institutions could cover an estimated potential demand of nearly 100,000 borrowers if\nthey would use their institutional capacity at full potential. Without Papua New Guinea Banking\nCorporation (PNGBC), however, the client base for credit would still be around 20,000. This\npotential  demand  is  only  met  by  the  existing  microfinance  providers  with  a  total  of  8,622\noutstanding loans. The lack of credit funds and overall highly insufficient institutional capabilities\nexplain the low outreach of microcredit in PNG.\n7. Contrary to the supply of credit, saving facilities are wide-spread throughout the country.\nNearly half a million people have a savings account, which falls in the category of microfinance.\nThe bulk of the accounts is held by PNGBC as the \u201cpeople\u2019s bank\u201d and of the savings and loan\nsocieties. If those two institutions were discharged, nonlicensed savings accounts would come\ndown to less than 10,000.\n8. Interest rates charged on credit range between 5 percent per annum flat and 35 percent,\nequivalent to effective interest rates of up to more than 70 percent. Considering all of the costs\ninvolved in obtaining a standard group loan in one of the women credit schemes, an effective\ninterest rate of 168 percent was calculated. Taking the existing high demand for credit, it becomes\nevident that, as in most other countries, PNG microborrowers are not interest-sensitive, access to\nadequate credit facilities in terms of convenient access, speedy procedures, timely disbursement,\nuncomplicated procedures, etc. is more important than the direct financial costs. Additionally, the\ninterest rates charged indicate that microfinance providers in PNG could become self-sustainable\nif they dispose of an efficient and effective management and institutional capacity.\n9. Interest  on  savings  is  negative  in  real  terms.  The  current  inflation  rate  is  around  18\npercent, while financial institutions pay only up to a maximum of 6 percent per annum for savings.\nThe fact that savings accounts are widely spread over PNG indicates that security is the main\nmotive  to  save.  The  findings  corroborate  similar  results  found  in  other  countries,  where  the\nphysical security of deposits, and convenience to deposit money and to withdraw it at any time\nwhen needed are the most crucial factors for depositing in financial institutions.\n10. The  quality  of  the  loan  portfolio  in  microfinance  is  far  from  acceptable,  even  when\nstandards  below  international  best  practices  are  applied.  Apart  from  a  few  examples  where\nacceptable repayment rates are achieved on the costs of low productivity, the portfolio at risk lies\nin the range of over 50 percent. In international best practice discussions on microfinance, the\nloan portfolio at risk is generally below 10 percent. An explanation for this worrying result lies in\nthe target group definition (finance of start-up businesses of poor women of the subsistence\nsector), the lack of systematic lending methodologies, and the general perception of microfinance\nas a mainly social issue.\n11. Absence  or  deficiencies  in  accounting  are  common  among  the  existing  microcredit\nschemes. The institutions do not use a standard chart of accounts and have no audited financial\nstatements, which makes it difficult to compare the results. Even the regulated financial institutions\ndo not account for microcredit operations separately and mix it up with their regular lending\nbusiness. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain reliable information on the operational\nand financial self-sufficiency of the microcredit schemes. Village Finance Limited (VFL) and Lik Lik\nDinau Abitore Trust (LLDAT), the most professional microfinance institutions (MFIs), only reach a\nlevel of 18,51 percent (VFL) and nearly 30 percent (LLDAT) of operational self-sufficiency, after\none (VFL) and six years (LLDAT) of operation.", "42 Appendix 3, page 4\n12. In addition, the low level of staff productivity indicates a lack in overall institutional capacity.\nApart from the savings and loan societies, which reach considerable levels in productivity because\ntheir lending procedures are very simple, all microcredit schemes lie in the range of less than 30\noutstanding loans per field officer. Only LLDAT reaches 135 loans with the cost of a portfolio at\nrisk of more than 50 percent.  Considering that most MFIs that have been analyzed rely on group-\nlending technologies, these figures are far below international standards, where the borrower per\nloan officer ratio in MFIs applying individual lending techniques is 250-300, and about 450-500\nwhen group-lending predominates.\nB.  Institutional Changes Toward Financial Self-Sufficiency\n13. The main challenges to become both financially self-sufficient and to provide financial\nservices with considerable outreach are in the following areas: (i) governance structure, (ii) target\nmarket, (iii) credit methodology, (iv) savings methodology, (v) growth strategy, and (vi) financial\nand  human resource management.\n14. Governance Structure. Microfinance in PNG has been developed almost exclusively under\nan integrated development or mainly social approach. Accordingly, cross-sectoral issues, (e.g.,\ngender,  community  development,  real  sector  development,  business  training,  etc.)  with  the\ninvolvement of the according government departments determine the governance structures of\nmost of the microfinance schemes of PNG. Consequently, social and poverty reduction goals\ndominate  the  governance  structure  of  the  existing  microcredit  schemes.  To  overcome  this\nsituation and to reach both the financial objectives and the social mission of an MFI, existing\ngovernance structures should be reviewed under the following aspects:\n(i)  A coherent set of overall goals must be defined. The actual coexistence of the\nobjectives  \u201creaching  the  poorest  of  the  poor\u201d  and  \u201cachieving  financial  self-\nsustainability in the short run\u201d hampers the development of a clear organizational\nprofile and leads to poor performance. Thus, international funding agencies and\nnational government departments in their role as funders and technical assistance\nproviders have to define priorities to develop a coherent set of guidelines and\nstandards for microfinance organizations.\n(ii)  Stakeholders have to be aware of the genuine services an MFI can provide best:\ntailor-made,  cost-covering  credit  and  savings  facilities.  The  profile  of  the\ngovernance structure should clearly reflect that orientation.\n(iii)  Overly complex governance structures are ineffective and produce informal and\nthus  nontransparent  management  structures.  Governance  structures  should  be\nkept lean and simple to produce appropriate incentives.\n15. Cross-sectoral  governance  structures  that  are  characterized  by  a  general  lack  of\nmicrofinance skills are dysfunctional. Investment in human resources to incorporate the technical\nknowledge on microfinance is necessary. At the same time stakeholders from the financial and\nprivate business sectors should be included in governance structures.\n16. Target Market. MFIs in PNG have drastically changed their market approach.  Up to the\npresent microfinance has been dominated by an integrated poverty reduction approach, measures\nsuch as means testing derived from the Grameen Bank have been taken to assure that the\nborrowers belong to the poorest segments of the society. But it should be common understanding\nthat credit is not an adequate means or panacea to solving the social and economic problems of\nthe poorest members of a society. Grants, social aid, and welfare instead of indebtness would be", "43 Appendix 3, page 5\nmore adequate for them. To become financially self-sustainable and to reach the target group for\nmicrofinance, the MFI-sector of PNG should consider the following aspects:\n(i)  Markets have to be targeted. While savings facilities can be offered to the broad\npublic, credit services should be directed to those elements of the markets that\nhave the highest probability to be able and willing to repay a loan.\n(ii)  Eligibility criteria should be set in a consistent way. To systematically exclude 50\npercent of the potential market by applying strict gender eligibility criteria, might be\njustifiable under social and political aspects for a special purpose MFI, but is not\nacceptable for the whole MFI sector of a country.\n(iii)  Targeting only start-up businesses raises the risk exposure of the MFI. Sectoral\ndiversification and a shift to experienced microbusinesses is highly recommended.\n(iv)  Markets should not be targeted under the existing slightly paternalistic beneficiary\nculture, but under a clear client service culture.\n(v)  Market research has to be introduced as a means of identifying profitable markets.\n(vi)  Profitability and target group orientation must be combined to identify new market\nsegments.\n17. Credit Methodology. To overcome the structural deficits of MFIs in PNG concerning their\ncredit methodology, the following recommendations should be considered:\n(i)  In general terms, MFIs have to develop the profile of a pure provider of financial\nservices, and accordingly of a reliable and thus strict lender that disciplines willful\ndefaulters and enforces these loans.\n(ii)  Screening mechanisms should be redefined. The actual procedures\u2014based on the\ncriteria \u201cno business experience\u201d, \u201cmonthly income of less than K200/$70\u201d and\n\u201cabsolute  poor  living  conditions\u201d\u2014produce  an  adverse  selection  of  potential\nborrowers, with the consequence of loan losses up to 50 percent.\n(iii)  Individual, cash flow-oriented lending methodologies have to be systematized and\nexpanded. To date, the most profitable segment of the microfinance sector is highly\nmarginalized\u2014from both traditional finance institutions and MFI.\n(iv)  As in-kind collateral can be found in even the smallest farming household of PNG,\nthe credit institution should accept in-kind collateral to secure loan recovery and to\nstrengthen its image by the community of a strict lender.\n(v)  The client-MFI relationship should be long-term\u2014working capital is an ongoing\nneed in any business activity. A single capital injection will not enable the borrower\nto graduate as a client of traditional financial institutions, as assumed by some\nmicrofinance  schemes.  Client  graduation  requires  time,  but,  once  achieved,\nproduces mutual benefits: better lending conditions for the borrower and higher\nprofitability for the MFI.\n18. Savings Mobilization. In PNG, savings mobilization through microfinance appears to be\nmuch more successful than the lending business. The following recommendations should be\nconsidered especially by the pure microfinance institutions to enhance their services regarding\nsavings mobilization:\n(i)  MFIs have to become profitable to gain customer confidence and to obtain a license\nas a deposit-taking institution.\n(ii)  MFIs should promote voluntary savings schemes and establish linkages between\ntheir target group and formalized, deposit-taking institutions.", "44 Appendix 3, page 6\n(iii)  Hidden  interest  costs  of  compulsory  savings  should  be  made  transparent  to\ncustomers.\n(iv)  Successful community savings schemes should be replicated and linked to the\nformal financial system.\n19. The  supervisory  function  of  the  Federation  of  Savings  and  Loan  Societies  must  be\nstrengthened to successfully continue the revitalization project of community-based savings and\nloan societies.\n20. Growth Strategy. All institutions analyzed will have to strengthen their institutional capacity\nprior to further growth. The application of standardized accounting procedures, a clear definition of\nthe target market, as well as a revision and systematization of lending methodologies are just\nsome areas that require concentration if a consistent growth strategy is to be defined. Additionally,\nintensive growth should be given priority over to extensive growth: client graduation and portfolio\ndiversification to the nonsubsistence sector offers high market potential for the existing branches\nand agencies.\n21. Financial  Management:  The  implementation  of  basic  management  information  and\naccounting systems is one key activity to be considered in order to professionalize the existing\nMFIs in PNG. But there is also a high need for training in accounting and in understanding of the\nkey  indicators  applied  to  microfinance.  Improvement  of  the  existing  financial  management\ncapacities will be focused on the following aspects:\n(i)  Standardized, computer-based accounting systems are to be implemented.\n(ii)  Key ratios for financial management are to be defined and produced on a regular\nbasis.\n(iii)  All MFIs have to implement basic management information systems.\n(iv)  Interest rates have to be set on a cost-recovery basis.", "45\nAppendix 4, page 1\nTHE GOVERNMENT\u2019S DRAFT MICROFINANCE POLICY\nRedefining Microfinance Towards Mainstream Financial Services\nPapua New Guinea\u2019s Microfinance Policy\n(Draft)\nA. Background\n1. The vast majority of the population in PNG has almost no access to financial services\ncurrently provided by Commercial Banks and Finance institutions. To some extent this is due to\na lack of infrastructure, and a low integration of significant parts of the society into the cash\neconomy. But, the Government of PNG also perceives inadequateness of existing financial\nproducts and services.  As a consequence, important sectors of the PNG economy are still cut\noff from the modern economy or have to face conditions that do not allow developing on the\nbasis of existing abundant resources.\n2. The Government has expressed in the MTDS and in the National Dialog that private\nsector development is paramount for the future of PNG. The Government has also stressed by\nthe recently adopted SME-Policy the important role of small and medium enterprises. As a next\nstep, it is the aim of the Government to address the weakness of the financial system in order to\nimprove the provision of financial services needed for private sector development. Therefore,\nthe legal framework for Banks and other Financial Institutions has been revised and important\nchanges  are  under  way.  Now  it  is  important  that  this  new  framework  leads  to  enhanced\neconomic  integration  of  micro,  small  and  medium  enterprises  through  better  access  to\nsustainable financial services for micro and small enterprises as well as for those who want to\nsave money for future financial needs.\n3. The Microfinance Policy is conceived as an open forum that provides a framework for\nexisting or future institutions to either upgrade existing credit schemes or downscale financial\nproducts  towards  mainstream  financial  services:  Microfinance  Institutions  should  aim  to  a\nmaximum  of  outreach  thereby  covering  all  the  costs  incurred  by  delivering  this  service.\nUnderscoring its private sector orientation, the Government of PNG understands its role as a\nfacilitator for private service provider.\nB. Objectives\n4. It is the objective of the Microfinance Policy to establish a framework that leads micro\nfinance  provider  towards  enhanced  institutional  capacity,  better  access  to  refinancing\nmechanisms in order to assist and support the development of existing enterprises currently\nexcluded  from  mainstream  financial  services.  By  targeting  profitable  enterprises  it  is  the\nintention to foster private sector development and to contribute to the social and economic\nintegration of marginalized households in PNG.\nC. Principles\n5. The Microfinance Policy of the Government is guided by the following fundamental\nprinciples:\n(i)  \u201cFinance\u201d is defined in terms of services or products in the field of equity, credit,\nsavings and insurance. Financial institutions and markets provide those services", "46\nAppendix 4, page 2\nthrough  financial  intermediation.  Financial  institutions  and  their  services  are\nconsolidated by the financial system. In a cash economy, a well functioning\nfinancial system is an important precondition for economic growth.\n(ii)  The role of Microfinance is to provide access to financial services to a wide range\nof people living on lower income and small and micro enterprises that currently\nfind it difficult to access those services, due to different reasons.\n(iii)  The development of viable, private Microfinance Institutions is seen as a crucial\ntarget to enhance the capacity of the total financial system\n(iv)  In  order  to  be  sustainable,  Microfinance-Services  have  to  be  designed  and\nprovided on a cost-covering basis. Quick operational sustainability is paramount\nfor  organizations  to  expand  their  services,  and  to  be  able  to  meet  existing\ndemand on a wide scale. Financial sustainability is required to survive on the\nmarket.\n(v)  Subsidies (of installation cost or financial costs) may be necessary\u2014especially\nduring the initial stages of institutional development\u2014but should be given in a\ntransparent way not arbitrarily interfering with the price mechanism of financial\nmarkets.\n(vi)  Competition  between  different  service  provider  is  necessary  to  improve  the\nefficiency of microfinance services and thus of the financial system as a whole.\n(vii)  Access to refinancing funds should be granted to all service providers on the\nbasis of performance, reflecting the financing conditions and the respective costs\nincluding the perceived risk of an individual institution.\n(viii)  Microfinance  is  one  aspect  of  private  sector  development  that  needs  to  be\nsupported and complemented by additional services of non-financial nature to be\ndelivered by appropriate organizations as highlighted in the SME-Policy.\nD. Best Practices\n6. The Microfinance Policy aims to enhance the institutional capacity of existing and future\nservice providers. Recognizing the different stages of development of existing organizations, the\nMicrofinance Policy of PNG takes into account internationally accepted best practices in order to\ndevelop a national Microfinance Industry Standard for PNG:\n(i)  The Government of PNG intends to support the development of Microfinance by\ncreating the appropriate regulatory framework as well as by the provision of\nadequate refinancing mechanisms for the private sector to deliver new credit and\nsavings products to the mass of the population that today has difficult access to\nfinancial services. On the basis of existing best practices, the Government of\nPNG invites private service providers to develop those microfinance services\nincorporating the social, cultural and economic condition prevailing in PNG.\n(ii)  Community  acceptance  is  crucial  for  successful  microfinance  institutions.\nTherefore  the  Government  calls  on  the  civil  society  to  support  and  foster\ncommunity acceptance of microfinance service providers.\n(iii)  The provision of microfinance services requires lean management in order to\nreach  operational  and  financial  sustainability  as  quickly  as  possible.  The\noperation should be managed in a transparent and accountable manner and\ncomply with international best practices in microfinance. While recognizing the\nimportant  social  objectives  of  microfinance,  continuing  operating  losses  of\nmicrofinance service providers are not acceptable, particularly whenever those\ninstitutions administer public funds.", "47\nAppendix 4, page 3\n(iv)  A lean management calls for responsible managers and loan officers able to\nassess and to manage the individual risk of each borrower. Therefore modern\nmanagement  procedures  and  tools  as  well  as  the  employment  of  modern\ncomputer  technology  are  crucial  tools.  The  Government  of  PNG  calls  on\ninternational  organizations  to  contribute  to  the  development  of  national\nmicrofinance competence.\n(v)  An important factor of success is the design of microfinance products that meet\nthe demand of the population. This embraces credit schemes that allow for cash\nflow  oriented  lending  as  one  approach  to  compensate  for  lack  of  bankable\ncollateral as well as savings products that are not tied to minimum deposits.\n(vi)  Sustainability is the most important factor for increased access to finance and\nexpansion of the financial sector. Therefore the microfinance policy underscores\nthe importance of high outreach and interest rates that allow for a financial\nequilibrium. In this framework, competition is paramount in order to deliver those\nservices as efficient as possible.\nE. Instruments\n7.  The government of PNG welcomes the initiative of a microfinance network open to all\norganizations interested in extending sustainable financial services to a wide range of economic\nactivities of the population.\n8.   As a principle, the government of PNG seeks to involve private sector organizations as\nmuch as possible in the implementation of this policy.\n9.  Future policy instruments should address the following key areas:\n(i)  Financial resources to finance microfinance operations.\n(ii)  Technical assistance to increase access to international best practice.\n(iii)  Institution and capacity building to mainstream microfinance operations.\n(iv)  Suitable  provisions  with  respect  to  the  risk  classification  of  microfinance\nportfolios.\n(v)  Temporary  tax  incentives  for  financial  institutions  to  start  up  microfinance\noperations.\n10. The government of PNG will maintain active dialogue with international agencies in order\nto win technical and financial support for the development of suitable policy instruments.", "48\nAppendix 5, page 1\nDETAILED IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS\nA.  Project Management\n1. The Executing Agency\n1. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG, the central bank) was established under the\nCentral Bank Act of 1973, which is based on Australian central banking legislation. The Head of\nState appoints the governor of BPNG, while the minister of the Department of Finance and\nTreasury appoints the deputy governor on the advice of the governor. The policy of the central\nbank is set by its board, whose members comprise the governor, deputy governor, the secretary\nof the Department of Finance and Treasury, and other members appointed by the Head of\nState. Within the context of the general framework of the policy objectives of the Government, it\nis the function of the central bank to (i) ensure that its monetary and banking policy is directed to\nthe  greatest  advantage  of  the  people  of  Papua  New  Guinea;  and  (ii)  direct  its  efforts  to\npromoting monetary stability and a sound and effective financial structure.\n2. BPNG\u2019s relationship with the banking system is governed by the Banks and Financial\nInstitutions Act, which covers the duties of commercial banks and licensed financial institutions,\nlicensing  requirements.  BPNG  supervises  commercial  banks  and  \u201cbank-like\u201d  institutions.  It\nrecently imposed a cash deposit requirement on commercial banks, stipulating a proportion of\ncommercial bank liabilities to be kept as a deposit with BPNG. It administers savings and loan\nsocieties (SLS) under the Savings and Loan Societies Act. With the exception of the SLS, the\ncentral bank imposes no interest rate controls on the institutions it supervises. The supervision\nof the Rural Development Bank, and superannuating and other contract savings funds is not the\nresponsibility of BPNG.\n3. BPNG will be the Executing Agency of the Project as well as the Implementing Agency\nfor  the  revolving  finance  facility  (RFF).  It  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  and\nimplementation of the Project and, in accordance with established government procedures, will\nbe the official contact point of ADB.\n2. The Microfinance Steering Committee\n4. BPNG  will  establish  a  microfinance  steering  committee  (MSC)1  to  administer  and\ncoordinate implementation of the three components and activities of the Project. The MSC will\nprovide  overall  policy  guidance  and  coordinate  activities  between  microfinance  institutions\n(MFIs),  nonfinancial  service  providers,  commercial  banks,  and  national  and  provincial\ngovernment  agencies.  The  MSC  will  be  responsible  for  the  administrative  and  financial\nimplementation of the Project, and will oversee project planning, organization, implementation,\nand monitoring. It will meet as often as required, but at least once every three months. The\nchairperson will be the governor of BPNG. Members will be senior representatives, one each\nfrom the Department of Finance and Treasury, Department of National Planning and Monitoring,\nthe private sector/MFI clients, nonfinancial service providers, and two representatives from\nMFIs.\n                                                \n1 The MSC is the project steering committee.", "Appendix 5, page 2\n49\n3. The Project Implementation Unit\n5. The project implementation unit (PIU) will be established by and operated under the\nguidance  of  BPNG.  It  will  be  physically  located  in  the  Institute  of  Banking  and  Business\nManagement (IBBM). It will handle the day-to-day project administration and implementation\nmatters. The PIU will provide and facilitate the required goods and services to the different\ncomponents and activities of the Project. It will be headed by a full-time project manager, and\nsupported by a project assistant.\n6. Performance monitoring and evaluation (PME) activities will be undertaken to ensure\nthat project resources are managed effectively and that project benefits are maximized. The PIU\nwill monitor and evaluate project performance and benefits for (i) internal efficiency (including\ninputs,  processes,  and  outputs);  (ii)  outreach  by  MFIs,  (iii)  satisfaction  of  demand  for\nmicrofinance services by the clients; and (iv) operational and financial self-sufficiency of MFIs.\n7. The PIU will establish, within six months of loan effectiveness, a set of qualitative and\nquantitative indicators to determine realistic, controllable, and measurable targets that reflect the\nanticipated project benefits. Utilizing the PME system, the MSC will periodically compare actual\nand projected performance, and recommend measures for immediate corrective action. The\nsuccess of the Project in terms of actual and forecasted benefits will be compared with the\ntargets. Based on the results, BPNG and MSC will consider adopting short-, medium-, and long-\nterm actions, strategies, and policies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Project.\n4.  The Implementing Agency\n8. The IBBM is the Implementing Agency of component A and B of the Project and will\nphysically accommodate the PIU. The history of IBBM dates back to 1965 when the Banker\u2019s\nCollege, as it was called then, commenced training and development programs under the\nauspices of the Reserve Bank of Australia. In 1974 the college was officially established under\nthe Associations Incorporation Act as Papua New Guinea Banker\u2019s College Inc. Until the mid-\n1990s the institute focused on training of bank staff. In 1998 the constitution was changed to\ninclude business management training. As a consequence, the name was changed to the\nPapua New Guinea Institute of Banking and Business Management Inc.\n9. IBBM has four different categories of membership: (i) member banks, (ii) corporate\nmembers, (iii) associate corporate members, and (iv) personal and professional members.  All\ncommercial banks in PNG are either member banks or associate corporate members, as well as\nthe Teaches Savings and Loan Society, the largest savings and loan society in PNG. In addition\n358 personal members are registered with IBBM.\n10. The objectives of IBBM are as follows:\n(i)  promote  and  enhance  the  professional  status  of  those  engaged  in  banking,\nfinance, and business management throughout PNG;\n(ii)  facilitate the exchange and acquisition of knowledge, skills, and techniques in the\ntheory and practice of banking, finance, and business management;\n(iii)  promote the training and education of people within the banking, financial, and\nbusiness management sectors of PNG;\n(iv)  encourage and foster fellowship and opportunities for the exchange of views and\nideas among members; and", "Appendix 5, page 3\n50\n(v)  maintain a college and faculty to meet and fulfill the educational, training, and\ndevelopment  needs  of  people  in  the  banking,  financial,  and  business\nmanagement sectors of PNG.\n11. IBBM  conducts  various  residential  and  nonresidential  short-  and  long-term  training\ncourses. The logistical facilities comprise (i) a fully equipped conference room for up to 80\nparticipants; (ii) two fully equipped training rooms for up to 16 participants; (iii) meeting and\nsyndicate rooms; (iv) supporting printing and audiovisual services; (v) a library and resource\ncenter; (vi) 18 twin-share rooms; and (vii) a kitchen and dining facilities.\nB.  Project Components\n1.  Microfinance Competence Center (Component A)\n12.  The Project will establish the microfinance competence center (MCC) within the Institute\nof  Banking  and  Business  Management.  The  institute  will  initially  provide  four  counterpart\nstaff/trainers  with the possibility to increasing the number to six during project implementation.\nThe institute will also provide office facilities and administrative support for components A and B\nand the PIU. Office supplies and communication costs will be borne to a maximum of $25,000\nequivalent during the project implementation period. In-house training will be conducted in the\ntraining rooms of the institute, and the conference facilities will be utilized for meetings of the\nnetwork of MFIs. The Project will assist the institute to prepare a full-fledged business plan after\n30 months of project implementation, and to provide a detailed strategy to achieve financial\nviability by the end of project implementation.\n13.  The MCC will carry out public relations activities for the benefit of all microfinance\nservice providers and their potential clients. Emphasis will be given to developing internal\ncommunication mechanisms between existing service providers and rural communities, and to\nadvertising basic concepts such as the benefits of savings and the availability of microcredit.\nThe Project will address the following aspects:\n(i)  microfinance network: the MCC will assume the role of a technical coordination\nbody for a network of service providers, national and provincial Government\nrepresentatives and assistance agencies;\n(ii)  awareness building: the MCC will create awareness among rural communities\nfor  suitable  savings  products  and  other  financial  services  that  are  already\navailable;\n(iii)  banking education: the MCC will engage strategic target groups (multipliers\nsuch as teachers) in the development of banking education programs, including\nthe preparation of suitable advertising material; and\n(iv)  public  relations  strategies:  the  MCC  will  support  microfinance  service\nproviders  in  designing  public  relations  and  marketing  strategies  for  their\nrespective services.\n14.  The  Project  will  enable  the  MCC  to  conduct  various  in-house  training  courses,\nworkshops,  and  seminars  aimed  at  broadening  the  understanding  of  microfinance  and  to\nimprove the skills of people involved at different levels in the provision of microfinance services.\nThe knowledge and skills of the MCC trainers will be upgraded to perform these tasks. A\ndetailed curriculum will be developed and will include the following subjects:", "51\nAppendix 5, page 4\n(i)  introductory courses will include topics on (a) microfinance and principles of\ngovernance, (b) microfinance and principles of management, (c) introduction to\nmicrofinance for loan officers, and (d) starting a self-help microfinance scheme;\n(ii)  technical  skills  training  will  focus  on  (a)  financial  analysis,  (b)  financial\ncalculation,  (c)  cash  flow-oriented  risk  assessment,  (d)  bookkeeping  and\naccounting procedures for MFIs, (e) presentation of balance sheet information,\nand (f) performance indicators for MFIs; and\n(iii)  organization  development  will  address  issues  with  regard  to  (a)  efficient\ndelivery  systems  (group  lending  versus  individual  loans),  (b)  monitoring  and\nmanagement  information  systems,  (c)  loan  management,  (d)  branch\nmanagement, (e) personnel and incentive systems, (f) organizational upgrading,\nand (g) downscaling of  financial services.\n15. In addition to in-house training, technical assistance (TA) packages will be developed to\nimprove the implementation capacity and the absorption capacity of existing MFIs. The TA\npackages will be designed for each stage of institutional development. Using the number of\nactive clients or outstanding loans as a measure, Figure A5.1 shows a typical development\npath.\nFigure A5.1: Stages of MFI Institutional Development\n16000\n14000\n12000\ns\nnt 10000\ne\nCli 8000\ne \nv 6000\nti\nAc 4000 P N G\n2000\n0\nStart-up Infant Expansion Maturity\nSource: Staff estimates based on international best practice in microfinance.\n16. Four different stages can be defined: (i) start-up, (ii) infant, (iii) expansion, and (iv)\nmaturity.  Based  on  the  different  stages  of  institutional  development  each  TA-package  will\nconsist of a variety of training courses and short-, and medium-term on-site consultancies:\n(i)  Start-up package. It will assist newly established MFIs with little experience in\nmicrofinance to develop into small but professional MFIs, prepared to embark on\na  growth  path  toward  sustainability.  The  main  tasks  are  to  define  a  simple\nproduct; introduce a professional delivery methodology, and standard accounting\nprocedures;  select  and  carry  out  on-the-job  training  of  newly  recruited  loan\nofficers and support the management in the initial decision-making process.\n(ii)  Sustainability  package.  Having  successfully  passed  the  infant  stage  of\ninstitutional  development  and  entered  the  expansion  phase,  this  package  is\ndesigned to quickly reach operational sustainability and to pave the way for\nfinancial  sustainability  as  the  portfolios  of  the  MFIs  grow.  It  focuses  on", "Appendix 5, page 5\n52\norganizational productivity, and adequate product design, and introduction of a\ncomputerized loan tracking system.\n(iii)  Expansion package. With operational sustainability accomplished, the next step\nis to improve the outreach and to increase the market penetration of MFIs. A\ncrucial aspect of this package is to revise the institution\u2019s organizational structure\nto set up branches. At this stage, a comprehensive monitoring and information\nsystem (MIS) will be introduced.\n(iv)  Formalization  package.  For  successful  MFIs  extending  to  become  formal\nfinancial institutions and to apply for a banking license to diversify their funding\nstructures, this package concentrates on legal requirements and the need for\ninternal adjustment of existing procedures.\n17. A dialogue with the relevant regulatory body will be facilitated to ensure a conducive\nenvironment for deepening the financial sector. The Project will develop governance guidelines\nand a rating system for microfinance service providers on the basis of internationally accepted\nbest practices. MCC staff will be trained to carry out the respective assessments and manage\nthe rating system. The rating system is linked to the finance facility, component C of the Project,\nand requires each MFI wanting to access the finance facility to obtain a satisfactory rating from\nthe MCC.\n2.  New Savings and Loan Products (Component B)\n18. Component B will develop, test, and implement new savings and loan products and\ndelivery methods for financial services. Specific attention will be given to linking community\nsavings groups with financial institutions. The Project will provide international expertise, and\ntraining  to  develop,  test,  and  implement  microfinance  services  focused  on  target  groups.\nSpecifically, the Project will\n(i)  establish dialogue between commercial banks and informal savings groups, and\nwill design detailed linkage modalities;\n(ii)  advise MFIs on appropriate microfinance products;\n(iii)  identify  commercial  banks  interested  in  providing  microfinance  services,  and\nprovide support in downscaling products and delivery methodologies;\n(iv)  design tailor-made savings and loan products for MFIs, pilot test products, and\nprovide support and backstopping to MFIs during the initial implementation stage;\nand\n(v)  monitor the performance of the delivery methods and disseminated information to\nthe MFI network.\n19.  One pilot microbanking scheme will be designed, established, and implemented in Wau\nto demonstrate the application of new savings and loan products, and delivery mechanisms.\nThe development process of the Wau pilot microbanking scheme will be documented in detail to\nbe used as a demonstration of microfinance best practice and a guide to new MFIs. The\nselection of Wau for the pilot microbanking scheme is based on the analysis of the recent World\nBank report on Poverty and Access to Public Services. It takes into account the high degree of\ndiversity of the local economy, e.g., small-scale mining, vegetable, coffee, timber, livestock,\ntrading, and other services in which a large part of the poor population is engaged. The Wau\npilot  banking  scheme  will  be  provided  with  equity  of  $250,000  and  one  international\nmicrofinance institutional development specialist for 36 person-months. The following tasks will\nbe completed during the first six months of project implementation prior to the start of the\nlending operations:", "Appendix 5, page 6\n53\n(i)  establishment of a legal framework and management structure;\n(ii)  design of savings and loan products and delivery mechanism;\n(iii)  set up of office and operations;\n(iv)  selection and training of loan officers; and\n(v)  development of a business plan.\n20. The District Administration of Bulolo/Wau will provide office space and security services\nfor the Wau pilot banking scheme.\n3.  Revolving Finance Facility (Component C)\n21. The establishment of the RFF forms component C of the Project with BPNG as the\nImplementing  Agency.  The  facility  will  provide  the  necessary  funding  for  MFIs  to  achieve\nsustainability and expand their loan portfolios. Credit lines will be tailored to the refinancing\nneeds  of  individual  microfinance  service  providers.  In  addition,  loans  for  the  purchase  of\ntechnical equipment needed to expand operations will be available to MFIs up to a consolidated\namount of 5 percent of the total funds foreseen for the RFF. Those financial instruments will\nonly be available in conjunction with TA-packages provided by the MCC under component A of\nthe Project.\n22. BPNG  will  outsource  the  day-to-day  management  of  the  RFF  to  a  private  sector\nmanagement agent, e.g., a private financial institution or other relevant entity based in PNG.\nThe selection of the management agent will follow established national competitive bidding\nprocedures  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  This  guarantees  the  necessary\nindependence as well as efficient management of the funds. It also underscores the intended\nprivate  sector  orientation  of  microfinance  in  general  and  of  this  Project  in  particular.  The\nmanagement agent will be paid either on a fixed fee basis or on a percentage basis for the\noutstanding balance of the credit lines. The management agent will carry out the following tasks:\n(i) financial management of the funds, (ii) administration of the financial instruments of the RRF,\n(iii)  monitoring  of  MFIs\u2019  performance  ensuring  that  performance  targets  are  met,  and  (iv)\nquarterly  reporting  to  BPNG  on  performance  of  the  facility  and  the  performance  of  the\nparticipating MFIs. The detailed terms of reference for the management contract will be finalized\nin the framework of a 12-month consultancy at the beginning of project implementation. The\nfinance  consultant  will  support  BPNG  in  evaluating  the  proposals  and  negotiating  the\nmanagement contract. Detailed procedures for reporting and auditing will be put in place to\nensure transparency of operations.\n23. ADB will disburse the first installment of $280,000 direct to a special account managed\nby the management agent under the supervision of BPNG, provided the following conditions are\nfulfilled: (i) a management contract (approved by ADB) has been signed and is legally effective\nbetween  PBNG  and  the  management  agency,  and  (ii)  a  model  for  onlending  agreements\nbetween the management agent and MFIs, indicating MFI credit line disbursement conditions,\nhas been approved by BPNG and ADB.\n24. The Government contributions will be made through the account of BPNG to the special\naccount of the management agent.\n25. Disbursement of subsequent installments to the special account may be requested by\nthe management agent to ADB through the PIU in accordance with the financial implementation", "Appendix 5, page 7\n54\nof  the  Project,  provided  the  management  agent  has  disbursed  more  than  70  percent  of\npreviously received funds to MFIs on the basis of onlending agreements.\n26.  The operation of the RRF will be guided by the following policies and procedures:\n(i)  Purpose of funds: Qualified MFIs will use the resources made available from\nthe  RRF  exclusively  for  loans  to  microenterpises,  smallholders,  and  small\nbusinesses of all economic sectors, and in accordance with the Government\u2018s\nMicrofinance Policy and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Policy.\n(ii)  Eligibility of MFIs: To access the facility, MFIs must meet the following criteria:\n(a) registration with the MCC and satisfactory rating (not older than six months)\nissued by the MCC, whereas the MFI fulfills the development targets set by the\nMCC; (b) satisfactory loan repayments, as established by on-time repayment rate\nof at least 85 percent.; (c) average loan amount of the portfolio to be refunded\ndoes not exceed K5,000; (d) a detailed plan for operational and financial self-\nsufficiency, with a strategy for improvements over the next year and performance\ntargets  is  presented;  (e)  adequate  management  information  and  accounting\nsystems are in place to ensure successful expansion, efficiency improvements,\nand satisfactory performance of the loan portfolio;  (f) the maximum exposure of\nthe  RFF  to  one  single  MFI  will  not  exceed  40  percent  of  the  total  amount\ndisbursed to the RFF at any time.\n(iii)  Conditions of credit lines: The following conditions apply: (a) credit lines to\nMFIs are made available in kina or in dollars provided the MFI is able, on the\ndiscretion of the management agent, to hedge the related foreign exchange risk;\n(b) for credit lines extended in dollars, the interest rate will be the applicable 3-\nmonth LIBOR plus a reasonable margin to cover costs, and for credit lines\ncontracted in kina, the interest rate shall be the most recent kina auction rate plus\na reasonable margin to cover costs; (c) interest rates are payable on a monthly\nbasis over the outstanding balance; (d)  a penalty fee is charged in the event of\nlate interest payments (arrears of more than 30 days) of additional 3 percent per\nannum; (e) for contracted, but not yet disbursed balances of the credit line, a\ncommitment fee of 0.25 percent per month is payable by the respective MFI to\nthe RRF; (f) the maximum maturity of the credit lines is five years; and (g)\nmaximum credit line amounts are determined by the management agent on the\nbasis  of  MFIs\u2019  stage  of  development.
