The report also describes the proposed administration of \ntechnical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) \nfor Women-Led Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the \nTA.  \n \nThe proposed loan to VIB, one of the leading joint stock banks in Viet Nam, will provide \n2. \ncritically needed financing to the underserved segment of small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs).  The  SME  sector  is  large  in  Viet  Nam,  with 98%  of  all  businesses  classified  as  such.1 \nFemale borrowers are particularly underserved, and the transaction will support women-owned \nand women-led SMEs (WSMEs). Additionally, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan will fund \nVIB\u2019s home loan business for improvements and repairs, which will contribute to improved living \nconditions primarily in urban areas.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \nEconomic update. In 2019, Viet Nam recorded real gross domestic product (GDP) growth \n3. \nof 7.0%, close to the average annual increase of 6.9% recorded between 2015 and 2018. Growth \nwas  also  robust  in  early  2020  prior  to  the  outbreak  of  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic. Viet Nam has successfully minimized the human toll of COVID-19 to date due to early \nand  effective  containment  measures;  however,  the  economy  has  been  impacted.  Reduced \ntourism,  a decline  in  demand from  Viet  Nam\u2019s  key export  markets (although demand from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China has begun to recover), and weak consumer demand are projected to \nlead to a GDP growth rate of 1.8%.2 The Government of Viet Nam introduced a fiscal package of \nabout D279 trillion (3.4% of GDP) to help offset the effects of the pandemic.3 This includes tax \ndeferrals, cuts, and exemptions, as well as cash transfers to affected workers and households. \nCoupled with early signs of a domestic recovery, Viet Nam is expected to rebound in 2021 with a \nGDP growth rate of 6.3% (footnote 3). \n \n4. \nFinancial sector. Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector is still developing and remains largely bank-\ncentric. State-owned commercial banks and joint stock commercial banks each account for 42% \n(total of 84%) of all credit institution assets. 4 Directed by policy lending, much earlier credit growth \nwas driven by borrowings from the network of state-owned enterprises and their affiliates. Some \nof  these  banking  practices  laid  the  groundwork  for  the  difficulties  encountered  by  the  banking \nindustry,  exacerbated  by  the  2008  global  financial  crisis,  and  continuing  in  the  2012  domestic \n\nand Potential.

Key Statistical Ratios. The financial sector comprises 31 commercial banks, 2 policy banks, \n16  finance  companies,  11  leasing  companies,  1  cooperative  bank,  3  licensed  microfinance  institutions,  1,182 \npeople\u2019s credit funds, 9 wholly foreign-owned banks, 2 joint venture banks, and 49 foreign bank branches, as of the \nend of fiscal year (FY) 2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fcrisis. While immediate efforts by the regulator, the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV), to manage \nthese crises were effective, longer-term reform measures are still being undertaken.5 Foremost, \nand  in  line  with  the  SBV\u2019s  strategic  objective  to  strengthen  the  capital  base  of  domestic \ncommercial banks, the implementation of Basel II standards was planned by 2020 (now delayed \nto 2023), with 10 banks participating in the pilot phase. \n \n5. \nMore recently, the banking sector has had strong growth, paralleling the country\u2019s overall \neconomic  expansion  and  responding  to  pent-up  consumer  demand,  with  a  compound  annual \ngrowth  rate  of  16.5%  from  2015  to  2019.6 COVID-19,  however,  has  impacted  overall  banking \nperformance. During the first half of 2020, credit to the economy increased 9.7% year-on-year, \nbelow the central bank\u2019s target of 11.0%\u201314.0% for 2020. Total assets as of the end of July 2020 \nwere D12,831 trillion.7 Slowing credit growth is in line with weakening domestic demand. To boost \nlending,  the  SBV twice reduced key  policy  rates by 50  basis  points  (in  March  and May  2020), \ncutting the discount rate to 3.0% and refinancing rate to 4.5%. On 13 March  2020, the SBV issued \nCircular No. 01/2020/TT-NHNN directing credit institutions to restructure the repayment periods \nof loans, waive and reduce interest and fees, and maintain debt classifications.8 In August, the \nSBV reduced the deposit interest rate of the compulsory reserve by 50 basis points for commercial \nbanks at SBV to 0.5%.9 As of September 2020, to support clients affected by COVID-19, banks \nhave (i) restructured loans for 271,000 clients with outstanding loans of D321 trillion (estimated \nat about 3.7% of total outstanding bank loans), (ii) waived and lowered interest rates applied to \nexisting  loans  of  around  D1,200  trillion  for  485,000  clients  (lending  rates  have  been  down  by \n2.5%\u20134.0%), and (iii) extended soft loans of D1,600 trillion to 310,000 new clients (footnote 5). \n \n6. \nSmall and medium-sized enterprises sector. Nearly all of Viet Nam\u2019s businesses are \nSMEs,  which account for  approximately  98%  of registered  enterprises  and  contributed  40%  of \nGDP  and  50%  of  total  employment  in  2019.10 By economic  activity,  SMEs  are  concentrated  in \nwholesale  and  trading  (about  44%),  manufacturing  (20%),  and  transport  and  storage  (7%). \nAccess to finance is challenging and the financing gap is large, estimated at approximately $6.0 \nbillion ($1.2 billion for women and $4.8 billion for men). A 2017 International Finance Corporation \n(IFC)  study  found  that  only  47%  of  male  SME  owners  and  37%  of  women  SME  owners  had \nreceived loans from banks in the preceding 2 years, despite  government measures to support \nSME development (footnote 1). Constraints on women SME borrowers accessing finance include \na  lack  of  collateral,  financial  literacy  issues,  higher  risk  perceptions  by  banks,  and  a  lack  of \nawareness of  this  segment\u2019s  potential. The  government views  SMEs  as a  priority  segment,  as \nreflected  in the  Law  on Providing  Assistance  for  SMEs,  effective  January  2018,  which aims  to \nprovide support to SMEs through various government-sponsored mechanisms with an emphasis \non WSMEs.11 COVID-19 has particularly impacted SMEs because of lockdown and containment \nmeasures,  as  well  as  decreased  domestic  demand.  The  government  has  introduced  various \ninvestment  incentives  and  import  duty  exemptions  to  help  support  these  smaller  enterprises, \n\n \n\n5  Please refer to Linked Document 1 for more details on banking sector regulations and reforms. \n6  Standard and Poor\u2019s. \n7  State Bank of Viet Nam.

The  law  defines  SMEs  based  on \nemployees contributing to the social insurance scheme. Government initiatives include a new credit guarantee fund, \ntax breaks, subsidies to rent production sites in industrial zones, creation of incubators, training, and consultancies. \nSMEs owned by women or employing a large number of women will be given priority for support for the development \nof human resources (i.e., free tuition and training costs), and a 30% corporate tax reduction. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nincluding  a 30%  reduction  of  the  corporate  income  tax rate  for enterprises having revenues  of \nless than D200 billion, which are primarily SMEs. 12 \n \n7. \nUrbanization and quality housing. A key objective of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNation (ASEAN) Community Vision 2025 is to raise people\u2019s living standards, empowering them \nto  seize  opportunities  and  address  the  challenges  they  will  face  in  the  coming  years. 13 \nUrbanization is central to this process. Viet Nam\u2019s urban population is expected to increase from \n34 million in 2015 to 41 million in 2025, one of the highest  rates of growth among the ASEAN \nmember countries (footnote 14). This structural shift will drive population growth and demand for \nnew  homes  and  better  quality  existing  housing  in  cities.  A  World  Bank  study  noted  that \napproximately 20% of 24 million households reside in poor living conditions in Viet Nam.14 A low \nsupply  of  new  housing  for  moderate  to  lower  income  homes,  affordability  issues,  and  limited \naccess to long-term housing finance for a majority of the population (mortgage debt to GDP is low \nat approximately 16%) has increased demand for incremental loans for home improvements.15 \nThe government also recognizes the need to support better quality housing for existing stock and \nhas introduced various measures supporting this objective.16 \n \n8. \nRationale. Given the need to strengthen the banking sector further to enable it to reach \nunderserved  segments  and  provide  standard  small  business  and  retail  products,  and \ncomplementing ADB\u2019s sovereign operations to reform and modernize Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector, \nADB has been working with banks targeting sectors where ADB can have a meaningful impact.17 \nADB has identified VIB as a suitable partner to help strengthen its outreach to SMEs and provide \ncritically needed loans to improve urban dwellers\u2019 living conditions. ADB has had a relationship \nwith VIB through its Trade Finance Program since 2009.18 VIB, the tenth largest bank in Viet Nam \nby assets, supports some key SME industries in Viet Nam. VIB has also shown interest in working \nwith ADB to support WSMEs, a new sub-segment for banks in Viet Nam that has not yet garnered \nmuch interest or activity. VIB also has a substantial and growing retail portfolio providing mortgage \nfinance loans for new homes and a large business line of home improvement loans. VIB\u2019s digital \nbanking  initiatives  provide  a  competitive  market  advantage  and  provide  a  suite  of  services \nefficiently supporting both retail and SME clients. Based on its digital outreach, interest in working \nwith  WSMEs,  strong  financial  performance,  and  good  corporate  governance,  VIB  is  a  suitable \npartner through which ADB can expand access to finance to these underserved segments.  \n \n\n \n\n12 Decree No. 37/2020/ND-CP introduced on 30 March 2020 expanded the list of sectors and industries able to access \ninvestment incentives under Decree 118/2015/ND-CP, which includes access to land and credit support initiatives; \nand expands the list to include the following four types of SME business lines: (i) SME supply chains, (ii) business \nincubators  for  SMEs,  (iii)  technical  support  facilities  for  SMEs,  and  (iv)  co-working  spaces  for  SMEs.  These \nbusinesses will be eligible for import duty exemptions on fixed assets, as well as other exemptions based on location.  \n\n13 ASEAN Secretariat. 2018.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Joint Stock \nCommercial  Bank  for  Investment  and  Development  of  Vietnam  for  Mainstreaming  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Lending Project. Manila. Most recently, in December 2018 and June 2019, ADB disbursed an A loan of \n$200 million and a B loan of $100 million to the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of \nVietnam to support SMEs (project number 51321). \n\n18 VIB has been part of the  Trade Finance Program since 2009 with a current approved limit of $60.0 million as of \n\nJanuary 2021.  \n\n \n\n\fBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nB. \n \n9. \nOverview.  With total  assets  of  D202  trillion  as  of  June  2020  (a  10%  increase  from  the \nprevious  year),  VIB  is  one  of  the  top  tier  banks  in  the  country.  It  also  has  one  wholly-owned \nsubsidiary, VIB Asset Management Company, with charter capital of D100 billion. VIB has a large \nbranch network with a presence in half the nation\u2019s provinces At the end of fiscal year (FY) 2019, \nthere were 162 outlets, including 50 full branches and 112 transaction offices. VIB\u2019s loan portfolio \ngrew by 34.4% in 2019, but growth slowed in 2020 due to COVID-19, and the portfolio had grown \nby about 17.0% as of the end of September 2020. The portfolio primarily comprises retail banking \n(including microlending, mortgage finance including home improvement loans, automobile loans, \ncredit  cards,  and bancassurance)  and  corporate  banking (including  wholesale banking,  SMEs, \nand treasury services). The share of retail banking in the total portfolio increased to about 83% \nduring the pandemic. Moody\u2019s latest Baseline Credit Assessment (as of June 2020) for VIB was \nB1, Counterparty Risk Assessment was Ba3, long-term (maturity of one year or more), and its \nlocal  and  foreign  currency  bank  deposit  rating  was  B1.  These  are  some  of  the  highest  credit \nratings in the market.  \n \n10. \nStrategy.  VIB  aims  to  become  the  leading  retail  bank  in  the  country.  As  noted,  digital \nbanking is a top priority for VIB and underpins its business strategy. The bank has strengthened \nand optimized its legacy systems and, at the same time, invested heavily in new digital technology \nplatforms and solutions to ensure consistency and synchronicity. This transformation has been \ncarried out across all aspects of the business with good results, making it possible for customers \nto have continuous access to the bank\u2019s services during the COVID-19 pandemic.19 \n \nRecognizing  their  business  potential  and  importance  to  the  economy,  VIB  plans  to \n11. \ncontinue its support for key SME sectors such as construction, manufacturing, energy distribution, \nfast-moving  consumer  goods  manufacturing,  and  distribution  and retailing. It  will  avoid  cyclical \nsectors, such as tourism and hotels, which it had previously funded. It plans to offer increased \nsupply chain financing, liquidity solutions, advisory services, and digital banking products (such \nas online bank guarantee verification, advanced payment, and cash flow management solutions) \nto reach underserved customers including WSMEs.  \n \nVIB\u2019s  housing  finance  portfolio  contains  mortgage  and  home  improvement  loans. \n12. \nMortgage loans were D49 trillion as of the end FY2019 and are expected to grow by 25% in 2020 \nand 2021. VIB plans to continue to expand its home improvement loan portfolio, given the pent \nup demand in this segment, which grew at a compound annual growth rate of around 31% from \nD10.8 trillion in 2017 to D18.5 trillion in 2019. VIB is targeting an increase of about 20% in 2021 \nto provide much-needed financing for the construction, repair, maintenance, and improvement of \nhomes. VIB will continue to cross-sell its home improvement and mortgage loans to its growing \nretail customer base, which is primarily in major cities where VIB has a strong presence.20  \n \n\n \n\n19 As of the end of June 2020, the number of customers registered for digital banking increased from 601,000 in 2019 \nto 711,000, the number of new customers obtained from VIB\u2019s website increased from 125,000 in 2019 to 148,000, \n79% of individual customers\u2019 financial transactions throughout the system were made through digital banking, and \ndigital  transactions  reached  14  million  in  2019  and  11  million  in  the  first  half  of  2020  (VIB  management)  and \nwww.vib.com.vn. \n\n20 As of June 2020, residential mortgage and home improvement loans in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi accounts for \n\n75% of this total portfolio. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\ntwo \n\nthe  regulatory  requirement  with \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nC. \n \n13. \nOwnership.  The  Commonwealth  Bank  of  Australia  (CBA)  has  been  VIB\u2019s  strategic \nshareholder since 2010, when it acquired a 15% stake (subsequently increased to 20% in 2011).21 \nIn  July  2017,  VIB  acquired  CBA\u2019s  branch  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  as  CBA  sought  to  deepen  its \npartnership with VIB. As of December 2020, CBA remains the largest shareholder with a 20.0% \nstake.22  \n \nADB conducted integrity due diligence on VIB, its board of directors, shareholders, and \n14. \nmanagers. None of the companies and individuals appear to constitute a significant or potentially \nsignificant integrity risk to ADB.23 ADB\u2019s review of the entities does not give ADB cause to believe \nthat these have been established or are being used for money laundering or terrorism financing \nin the jurisdiction involved in the project. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \n15. \nCorporate  governance.  VIB  benefits  from  best  practices  introduced  by  CBA  and  its \nrepresentation on the board by three experienced bankers. The segregation between board and \nmanagement responsibilities is clearer in VIB than in most banks in Viet Nam. Board composition \nnominally  exceeds \nindependent  directors.  CBA \nrepresentatives  include  two  senior  executives  from  CBA\u2019s  international  financial  services \nsubsidiary,  including  one  appointed  to  the  VIB  board  in  April  2018.  The  third  director  is  an \nexecutive general manager of retail and business banking at ASB Bank, CBA\u2019s New Zealand-\nbased commercial bank subsidiary (although he is technically considered independent under local \nregulations). The remaining directors consist of two major shareholders (Messrs. Dang Khac Vy \nand Do Xuan Hoang), a founding shareholder, the other independent director (an experienced \nVietnamese lawyer), and the only executive member, VIB\u2019s CEO. Directors serve 3-year terms \nand can be re-elected indefinitely (a common practice in Viet Nam). There are two board-level \ncommittees for  human  resources  and  risk management.  The  human resources  committee  has \nfive members and is chaired by an independent director. A separate supervisory board has three \nfull-time members (including a CBA secondee) and performs the duties typically associated with \nan audit committee. It reports directly to the general assembly of shareholders. \n \n16.  Management. VIB has a strong, stable 12-member board of management, many of whom \nhave worked for foreign banks in Viet Nam. The current CEO was VIB\u2019s chair from 2008 to 2013, \nand also served as the bank\u2019s CEO from 2006 to 2008. The senior management team members \nhave been with the bank for more than 8 years on average and bring in-depth knowledge. \n \nRisk management. The independent, integrated risk management division reports to the \n17. \nCEO,  with  indirect  reporting  to  the  board  risk  management  committee.  The  risk  management \ndivision, which is headed by the chief risk officer, has seven departments: two for credit appraisal \n(retail  and  wholesale  including  financial  institutions),  two  for  collections  (retail  and  wholesale), \ncredit risk identification, credit risk policy, and risk monitoring and compliance. VIB is one of 10 \nbanks participating in the SBV Basel II pilot and has been calculating its capital adequacy ratio \n(CAR) under Basel II on a fully automated basis since FY2016. It was also the first private bank \nto comply with and qualify for Basel II. \n \n\n \n\n21 CBA is the largest Australian bank by profit before tax, total assets, and total equity, and is one of four dominant \n\nAustralian banks in consumer lending, particularly mortgages. \n\n22 As of June 2020, CBA had A$963,747 million in total assets, A$68,075 million in shareholder equity, and A$10,168 \n\n23 ADB. 2003.

ADB \nexpects to syndicate a B loan of up to $100,000,000 among commercial banks and other eligible \nB loan participants on a commercially reasonable efforts basis and subject to market conditions. \nADB will also provide a transaction technical assistance (TA) of up to $500,000 that will facilitate \nincreased lending to WSMEs.  \n \nB. \n \nUse  of  proceeds.  Half  of  the  ADB  A  loan  will  be  used  to  support  SMEs24,  including \n19. \nWSMEs. 25 The balance will be used for home improvement loans.26 The B loan will be used for \nretail business loans and housing finance, including home improvements. \n \n20.  Monitoring and reporting. ADB will monitor the project throughout its duration. VIB will, \nat predetermined regular intervals and as requested, provide ADB with financial reports including \n(i) quarterly unaudited financial statements; (ii) annual audited financial statements; (iii) quarterly \ncompliance  certificates  for  financial  covenants;  (iv)  semiannual  reporting  on  the  SME  loan \nportfolio; (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed upon by ADB and VIB, \nincluding  on  gender  targets  and  initiatives;  and  (vi)  an  annual  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system performance report. \n \n21. \nThe first report will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC. \n \n22. \nStrengthening the banking sector. As noted, Viet Nam\u2019s banking sector is evolving and \nhas made progress in addressing some of its systemic problems. Since 2010, several banks have \nbeen building their retail and small business portfolios to respond to pent-up customer demand \nfrom  years  of  lacking  standard  bank  products.  To  support  the  growth  of  its  SME  and  home \nimprovement loan portfolio, which entail longer-tenor loans, VIB needs longer-tenor financing to \ncomply with regulatory requirements restricting the ratio of short-term funding to long-term funding \nand  to  reduce  maturity  mismatch  risk.  Long-tenor  funding  is  not  readily  available  given  the \nrelatively underdeveloped nature of the country\u2019s capital markets, and ADB\u2019s funding will address \nthis market gap. \n \n23. \nSupporting  the  growth  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  including  those \nowned  and/or  led  by  women.  ADB  funding  will  support  the  growth  of  SMEs,  which  are  the \nbackbone  of  the  Vietnamese  economy  and  important  for  job  creation  and  economic  recovery \nduring  and  after  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  By  partnering  with  a  bank  with  a  large  network, \nincluding  in  the  digital  space,  and  an  established  and  growing  SME  business  line,  ADB  can \n\nEvaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB at least annually. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \n\n24 VIB defines SMEs as companies with annual revenues of up to D400 billion. \n25 WSMEs are defined by either (i) being at least 51% owned by women or a woman, or (ii) meeting all of the following \n3 sub-criteria: (a) it is at least 20% owned by a woman or women, (b) a woman is the senior or second most senior \nexecutive, and (c) at least 30% of the board members are women (where a board exists). \n\n26 ADB\u2019s funding will only be used for owner-occupied properties.  \n\n\f7 \n\nmaximize its development footprint. Targeting women borrowers is new for banks in Viet Nam \nand, given VIB\u2019s visibility in the market, this intervention is expected to serve as an example to \nother banks. ADB will work closely with VIB and through TA to reach out to more WSMEs with a \npromotional  campaign,  train  women  on  applying  for  bank  loans,  gender-disaggregating  VIB\u2019s \nmanagement  information  system,  and  providing  internal  training  to  VIB  staff  on  how  to  better \nserve WSMEs. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \n24. \nImproving  living  conditions.  By  providing  long-term  funding  to  VIB  to  grow  its  home \nimprovement loan portfolio further, ADB will contribute to better quality housing, which will help \nViet Nam achieve its goals of increasing productivity and inclusive urban growth. An estimated \n350,000 people move to Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi each year, and the population of Viet Nam\u2019s \nmajor cities has grown at around 3% each year since 2010, reaching 9 million in Ho Chi Minh City \nand 8 million in Hanoi. This influx means that demand for new housing units in Ho Chi Minh City \nand Hanoi combined is about 250,000 a year. With approximately 60,000 units being constructed \nper  year,  demand  far  exceeds  supply,  particularly  for  moderate  and  lower  income  people. 27 \nTherefore, new homes and existing home stock upgrades are essential. \n \n25. \nCatalyzing private sector funding. ADB is expected to provide a B loan of up to $100 \nmillion,  thereby  mobilizing  private  financing  for  VIB  and  providing  an  important  source  of \ndiversified funding to support the growth of their mortgage and retail business loans. \n \nD. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nThe  $500,000  TA  will  help  VIB  better  meet  the  needs  of  WSMEs  through  (i)  collecting \nsurvey data to assess the impact of COVID-19 and ADB\u2019s assistance to WSMEs; (ii) developing \nVIB\u2019s capacity to serve women by developing targeted marketing materials, training loan officers \non gender biases, and introducing a gender-disaggregated management information system; and \n(iii) training women entrepreneurs on applying for bank loans.28 A grant from We-Fi will fund the \nTA; it will be the first ADB nonsovereign project that benefits from We-Fi support.29 The integration \nof the TA is also an example of \u201cOne ADB\u201d collaboration, with departments across ADB working \ntogether closely to develop and implement the TA to maximize the impact of ADB\u2019s lending. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nImpact. The project is aligned with the following impacts: Viet Nam\u2019s vision for socially \nequitable economic  development,  the  National Action  Plan  for the Implementation  of  the  2030 \nSustainable Development Agenda,30 better access to finance for the underserved population and \nSMEs, and the development of the finance and housing sector as promulgated by the Housing \nLaw of 2015, and Law on Supporting Small and Medium Enterprises .  \n\n \n\n27 D.

The project will increase financing to SMEs in a more gender equitable manner. \n\n28. \nIt will also help VIB increase its home improvement loan portfolio. \n \n29. \nOutputs. The project\u2019s outputs will be (i) increased capacity of VIB to serve SMEs and \nWSMEs; (ii) strengthened capacity of VIB to serve women entrepreneurs; (iii) enhanced capacity \nof women entrepreneurs; and (iv) increased capacity of VIB to expand home improvement loans.  \n \nB. \n \n30. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  transaction  supports  the \nfollowing key operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities, (ii) making cities livable, and (iii) accelerating progress in gender equality \nthrough  the  gender  action  plan.  Without  access  to  formal  financial  services,  underserved \nsegments of the population will be excluded from the growth process and its benefits. According \nto ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u2013202031 and country operations business plan, 2021\u2013\n202332 for Viet Nam, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will support investments that promote more \ninclusive economic growth based on promoting job creation and competitiveness. The proposed \ntransaction will support the development of SMEs and improvement of living conditions in Viet \nNam, which is part of the inclusive economic growth objective of the country partnership strategy \nand also a high government priority, and will complement ADB\u2019s efforts to strengthen the financial \nsector under the Financial Sector Development and Inclusion Program.33  \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009)34 as follows: environment (category FI), involuntary resettlement (category FI \ntreated as C), and indigenous peoples (category FI treated as C).  \n \n32. \nADB has conducted a desktop review of the investment's potential environment and social \nimpacts, its risks associated with VIB\u2019s existing or likely future portfolio, and its commitment and \ncapacity for  environmental  and social  management.  VIB  will  use the  proposed loan to  support \nSMEs and home loan improvements. VIB has an existing environment and social management \nsystem (ESMS) that defines procedures and institutional arrangements to identify, mitigate and \naddress environmental and social impacts. The review, however, identified the need to enhance \nVIB\u2019s existing ESMS to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and social requirements. \nVIB will enhance its existing ESMS prior to disbursement. The enhanced ESMS will (i) harmonize \nthe  VIB  exclusion  list  with  the  ADB  prohibited  investment  activity  list;  (ii)  enhance  screening \nprocedures to determine the risk categorization based on the definition in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement to indicate clearly credit accounts\u2019 risks to the environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples; (iii) develop and provide environment, social, health and safety training \nto staff and relevant third parties; and (iv) develop a systematic documentation of the grievances \nreceived  and  actions  carried  out  to  resolve  the  issues.  VIB  will  also  ensure  compliance  with \n\n \n\n31 ADB. 2016.

VIB  will  not  use  ADB  funding  to  finance  projects  classified  as  category  A  for \nenvironmental impacts or category A or B for involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. VIB \nwill report annually to ADB on its compliance with environmental and social requirements and with \nnational and international laws and standards.  \n \n33. \nEffective gender mainstreaming. VIB, like many banks in the Vietnamese market, does \nnot  currently  prioritize  WSMEs,  resulting  in  a  lack  of  information  on  their  needs,35 no  targeted \nmarketing  materials,  and  loan  officers  not  sensitized  to  the  business  case  for  WSMEs  as \ncustomers. VIB has regulations against sexual harassment in its Code of Conduct. More than half \nof VIB\u2019s staff (57%) are female, with 41% of management roles and 60% of professional roles \nbeing  held  by  women.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  VIB  has \nincorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business \nactivities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: (i) increase the number of WSME \nborrowers;  (ii)  increase  lending  to  WSMEs;  (iii)  improve  understanding  of  the  impact  of  VIB\u2019s \nlending on WSMEs; (iv) develop marketing materials targeting WSMEs; (v) train VIB staff on how \nto better serve WSMEs; and (vi) train women entrepreneurs on VIB loan products and application \nprocesses. VIB will submit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB. \n \n34. \nVIB was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n35. \n \nC. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),36 \n36. \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Viet \nNam  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  VIB.
