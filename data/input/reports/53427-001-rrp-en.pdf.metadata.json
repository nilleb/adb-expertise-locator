THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $200,000,000 to Vietnam International Commercial Joint Stock Bank (VIB), comprising (i) a \nsenior unsecured A loan of up to $100,000,000, and (ii) a B loan of up to $100,000,000 for the \nVietnam International Bank Supporting Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Improving \nLiving Conditions Project in Viet Nam.  The report also describes the proposed administration of \ntechnical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) \nfor Women-Led Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the \nTA.  \n \n2.  The proposed loan to VIB, one of the leading joint stock banks in Viet Nam, will provide \ncritically needed financing to the underserved segment of small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs). The SME sector is large in Viet Nam, with 98% of all businesses classified as such.1 \nFemale borrowers are particularly underserved, and the transaction will support women-owned \nand women-led SMEs (WSMEs). Additionally, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan will fund \nVIB\u2019s home loan business for improvements and repairs, which will contribute to improved living \nconditions primarily in urban areas.  \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Economic update. In 2019, Viet Nam recorded real gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nof 7.0%, close to the average annual increase of 6.9% recorded between 2015 and 2018. Growth \nwas also robust in early 2020 prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic. Viet Nam has successfully minimized the human toll of COVID-19 to date due to early \nand effective containment measures; however, the economy has been impacted.  Reduced \ntourism, a decline in demand from Viet Nam\u2019s key export markets (although demand from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China has begun to recover), and weak consumer demand are projected to \nlead to a GDP growth rate of 1.8%.2 The Government of Viet Nam introduced a fiscal package of \nabout D279 trillion (3.4% of GDP) to help offset the effects of the pandemic.3 This includes tax \ndeferrals, cuts, and exemptions, as well as cash transfers to affected workers and households. \nCoupled with early signs of a domestic recovery, Viet Nam is expected to rebound in 2021 with a \nGDP growth rate of 6.3% (footnote 3). \n \n4.  Financial sector. Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector is still developing and remains largely bank-\ncentric. State-owned commercial banks and joint stock commercial banks each account for 42% \n(total of 84%) of all credit institution assets. 4 Directed by policy lending, much earlier credit growth \nwas driven by borrowings from the network of state-owned enterprises and their affiliates. Some \nof these banking practices laid the groundwork for the difficulties encountered by the banking \nindustry, exacerbated by the 2008 global financial crisis, and continuing in the 2012 domestic \n \n1  International Finance Corporation, World Bank Group. 2017.

APAC Sovereign Credit Overview 3Q20. Hong Kong, China. \n4  State Bank of Viet Nam. Key Statistical Ratios. The financial sector comprises 31 commercial banks, 2 policy banks, \n16 finance companies, 11 leasing companies, 1 cooperative bank, 3 licensed microfinance institutions, 1,182 \npeople\u2019s credit funds, 9 wholly foreign-owned banks, 2 joint venture banks, and 49 foreign bank branches, as of the \nend of fiscal year (FY) 2019. \n \n ", "2 \ncrisis. While immediate efforts by the regulator, the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV), to manage \nthese crises were effective, longer-term reform measures are still being undertaken.5 Foremost, \nand  in  line  with  the  SBV\u2019s  strategic  objective  to  strengthen  the  capital  base  of  domestic \ncommercial banks, the implementation of Basel II standards was planned by 2020 (now delayed \nto 2023), with 10 banks participating in the pilot phase. \n \n5.  More recently, the banking sector has had strong growth, paralleling the country\u2019s overall \neconomic expansion and responding to pent-up consumer demand, with a compound annual \ngrowth rate of 16.5% from 2015 to 2019.6 COVID-19, however, has impacted overall banking \nperformance. During the first half of 2020, credit to the economy increased 9.7% year-on-year, \nbelow the central bank\u2019s target of 11.0%\u201314.0% for 2020. Total assets as of the end of July 2020 \nwere D12,831 trillion.7 Slowing credit growth is in line with weakening domestic demand. To boost \nlending, the SBV twice reduced key policy rates by 50 basis points (in March and May 2020), \ncutting the discount rate to 3.0% and refinancing rate to 4.5%. On 13 March  2020, the SBV issued \nCircular No. 01/2020/TT-NHNN directing credit institutions to restructure the repayment periods \nof loans, waive and reduce interest and fees, and maintain debt classifications.8 In August, the \nSBV reduced the deposit interest rate of the compulsory reserve by 50 basis points for commercial \nbanks at SBV to 0.5%.9 As of September 2020, to support clients affected by COVID-19, banks \nhave (i) restructured loans for 271,000 clients with outstanding loans of D321 trillion (estimated \nat about 3.7% of total outstanding bank loans), (ii) waived and lowered interest rates applied to \nexisting loans of around D1,200 trillion for 485,000 clients (lending rates have been down by \n2.5%\u20134.0%), and (iii) extended soft loans of D1,600 trillion to 310,000 new clients (footnote 5). \n \n6.  Small and medium-sized enterprises sector. Nearly all of Viet Nam\u2019s businesses are \nSMEs, which account for approximately 98% of registered enterprises and contributed 40% of \nGDP and 50% of total employment in 2019.10 By economic activity, SMEs are concentrated in \nwholesale and trading (about 44%), manufacturing (20%), and transport and storage (7%). \nAccess to finance is challenging and the financing gap is large, estimated at approximately $6.0 \nbillion ($1.2 billion for women and $4.8 billion for men). A 2017 International Finance Corporation \n(IFC) study found that only 47% of male SME owners and 37% of women SME owners had \nreceived loans from banks in the preceding 2 years, despite government measures to support \nSME development (footnote 1). Constraints on women SME borrowers accessing finance include \na lack of collateral, financial literacy issues, higher risk perceptions by banks, and a lack of \nawareness of this segment\u2019s potential. The government views SMEs as a priority segment, as \nreflected in the Law on Providing Assistance for SMEs, effective January 2018, which aims to \nprovide support to SMEs through various government-sponsored mechanisms with an emphasis \non WSMEs.11 COVID-19 has particularly impacted SMEs because of lockdown and containment \nmeasures, as well as decreased domestic demand. The government has introduced various \ninvestment incentives and import duty exemptions to help support these smaller enterprises, \n \n5  Please refer to Linked Document 1 for more details on banking sector regulations and reforms. \n6  Standard and Poor\u2019s. \n7  State Bank of Viet Nam.

Government initiatives include a new credit guarantee fund, \ntax breaks, subsidies to rent production sites in industrial zones, creation of incubators, training, and consultancies. \nSMEs owned by women or employing a large number of women will be given priority for support for the development \nof human resources (i.e., free tuition and training costs), and a 30% corporate tax reduction. \n ", "3 \nincluding a 30% reduction of the corporate income tax rate for enterprises having revenues of \nless than D200 billion, which are primarily SMEs. 12 \n \n7.  Urbanization and quality housing. A key objective of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNation (ASEAN) Community Vision 2025 is to raise people\u2019s living standards, empowering them \nto  seize  opportunities  and  address  the  challenges  they  will  face  in  the  coming  years.13 \nUrbanization is central to this process. Viet Nam\u2019s urban population is expected to increase from \n34 million in 2015 to 41 million in 2025, one of the highest rates of growth among the ASEAN \nmember countries (footnote 14). This structural shift will drive population growth and demand for \nnew  homes  and  better  quality  existing  housing  in  cities.  A  World  Bank  study  noted  that \napproximately 20% of 24 million households reside in poor living conditions in Viet Nam.14 A low \nsupply of new housing for moderate to lower income homes, affordability issues, and limited \naccess to long-term housing finance for a majority of the population (mortgage debt to GDP is low \nat approximately 16%) has increased demand for incremental loans for home improvements.15 \nThe government also recognizes the need to support better quality housing for existing stock and \nhas introduced various measures supporting this objective.16 \n \n8.  Rationale. Given the need to strengthen the banking sector further to enable it to reach \nunderserved  segments  and  provide  standard  small  business  and  retail  products,  and \ncomplementing ADB\u2019s sovereign operations to reform and modernize Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector, \nADB has been working with banks targeting sectors where ADB can have a meaningful impact.17 \nADB has identified VIB as a suitable partner to help strengthen its outreach to SMEs and provide \ncritically needed loans to improve urban dwellers\u2019 living conditions. ADB has had a relationship \nwith VIB through its Trade Finance Program since 2009.18 VIB, the tenth largest bank in Viet Nam \nby assets, supports some key SME industries in Viet Nam. VIB has also shown interest in working \nwith ADB to support WSMEs, a new sub-segment for banks in Viet Nam that has not yet garnered \nmuch interest or activity. VIB also has a substantial and growing retail portfolio providing mortgage \nfinance loans for new homes and a large business line of home improvement loans. VIB\u2019s digital \nbanking initiatives provide a competitive market advantage and provide a suite of services \nefficiently supporting both retail and SME clients. Based on its digital outreach, interest in working \nwith WSMEs, strong financial performance, and good corporate governance, VIB is a suitable \npartner through which ADB can expand access to finance to these underserved segments.  \n \n \n12 Decree No. 37/2020/ND-CP introduced on 30 March 2020 expanded the list of sectors and industries able to access \ninvestment incentives under Decree 118/2015/ND-CP, which includes access to land and credit support initiatives; \nand expands the list to include the following four types of SME business lines: (i) SME supply chains, (ii) business \nincubators for SMEs, (iii) technical support facilities for SMEs, and (iv) co-working spaces for SMEs. These \nbusinesses will be eligible for import duty exemptions on fixed assets, as well as other exemptions based on location.  \n13 ASEAN Secretariat. 2018. ASEAN Sustainable Urbanisation Strategy.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Joint Stock \nCommercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam for Mainstreaming Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Lending Project. Manila. Most recently, in December 2018 and June 2019, ADB disbursed an A loan of \n$200 million and a B loan of $100 million to the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of \nVietnam to support SMEs (project number 51321). \n18 VIB has been part of the Trade Finance Program since 2009 with a current approved limit of $60.0 million as of \nJanuary 2021.  \n ", "4 \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n9.  Overview. With total assets of D202 trillion as of June 2020 (a 10% increase from the \nprevious year), VIB is one of the top tier banks in the country. It also has one wholly-owned \nsubsidiary, VIB Asset Management Company, with charter capital of D100 billion. VIB has a large \nbranch network with a presence in half the nation\u2019s provinces At the end of fiscal year (FY) 2019, \nthere were 162 outlets, including 50 full branches and 112 transaction offices. VIB\u2019s loan portfolio \ngrew by 34.4% in 2019, but growth slowed in 2020 due to COVID-19, and the portfolio had grown \nby about 17.0% as of the end of September 2020. The portfolio primarily comprises retail banking \n(including microlending, mortgage finance including home improvement loans, automobile loans, \ncredit cards, and bancassurance) and corporate banking (including wholesale banking, SMEs, \nand treasury services). The share of retail banking in the total portfolio increased to about 83% \nduring the pandemic. Moody\u2019s latest Baseline Credit Assessment (as of June 2020) for VIB was \nB1, Counterparty Risk Assessment was Ba3, long-term (maturity of one year or more), and its \nlocal and foreign currency bank deposit rating was B1. These are some of the highest credit \nratings in the market.  \n \n10.  Strategy. VIB aims to become the leading retail bank in the country. As noted, digital \nbanking is a top priority for VIB and underpins its business strategy. The bank has strengthened \nand optimized its legacy systems and, at the same time, invested heavily in new digital technology \nplatforms and solutions to ensure consistency and synchronicity. This transformation has been \ncarried out across all aspects of the business with good results, making it possible for customers \nto have continuous access to the bank\u2019s services during the COVID-19 pandemic.19 \n \n11.  Recognizing  their  business  potential  and  importance to the  economy,  VIB  plans  to \ncontinue its support for key SME sectors such as construction, manufacturing, energy distribution, \nfast-moving consumer goods manufacturing, and distribution and retailing. It will avoid cyclical \nsectors, such as tourism and hotels, which it had previously funded. It plans to offer increased \nsupply chain financing, liquidity solutions, advisory services, and digital banking products (such \nas online bank guarantee verification, advanced payment, and cash flow management solutions) \nto reach underserved customers including WSMEs.  \n \n12.  VIB\u2019s  housing  finance  portfolio  contains  mortgage  and  home  improvement  loans. \nMortgage loans were D49 trillion as of the end FY2019 and are expected to grow by 25% in 2020 \nand 2021. VIB plans to continue to expand its home improvement loan portfolio, given the pent \nup demand in this segment, which grew at a compound annual growth rate of around 31% from \nD10.8 trillion in 2017 to D18.5 trillion in 2019. VIB is targeting an increase of about 20% in 2021 \nto provide much-needed financing for the construction, repair, maintenance, and improvement of \nhomes. VIB will continue to cross-sell its home improvement and mortgage loans to its growing \nretail customer base, which is primarily in major cities where VIB has a strong presence.20  \n \n \n19 As of the end of June 2020, the number of customers registered for digital banking increased from 601,000 in 2019 \nto 711,000, the number of new customers obtained from VIB\u2019s website increased from 125,000 in 2019 to 148,000, \n79% of individual customers\u2019 financial transactions throughout the system were made through digital banking, and \ndigital transactions reached 14 million in 2019 and 11 million in the first half of 2020 (VIB management) and \nwww.vib.com.vn. \n20 As of June 2020, residential mortgage and home improvement loans in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi accounts for \n75% of this total portfolio. \n ", "5 \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n13.  Ownership.  The  Commonwealth  Bank  of  Australia (CBA)  has  been  VIB\u2019s  strategic \nshareholder since 2010, when it acquired a 15% stake (subsequently increased to 20% in 2011).21 \nIn July 2017, VIB acquired CBA\u2019s branch in Ho Chi Minh City, as CBA sought to deepen its \npartnership with VIB. As of December 2020, CBA remains the largest shareholder with a 20.0% \nstake.22  \n \n14.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence on VIB, its board of directors, shareholders, and \nmanagers. None of the companies and individuals appear to constitute a significant or potentially \nsignificant integrity risk to ADB.23 ADB\u2019s review of the entities does not give ADB cause to believe \nthat these have been established or are being used for money laundering or terrorism financing \nin the jurisdiction involved in the project. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \n15.  Corporate governance. VIB benefits from best practices introduced by CBA and its \nrepresentation on the board by three experienced bankers. The segregation between board and \nmanagement responsibilities is clearer in VIB than in most banks in Viet Nam. Board composition \nnominally  exceeds  the  regulatory  requirement  with  two  independent  directors.  CBA \nrepresentatives  include  two  senior  executives  from  CBA\u2019s  international  financial  services \nsubsidiary, including one appointed to the VIB board in April 2018. The third director is an \nexecutive general manager of retail and business banking at ASB Bank, CBA\u2019s New Zealand-\nbased commercial bank subsidiary (although he is technically considered independent under local \nregulations). The remaining directors consist of two major shareholders (Messrs. Dang Khac Vy \nand Do Xuan Hoang), a founding shareholder, the other independent director (an experienced \nVietnamese lawyer), and the only executive member, VIB\u2019s CEO. Directors serve 3-year terms \nand can be re-elected indefinitely (a common practice in Viet Nam). There are two board-level \ncommittees for human resources and risk management. The human resources committee has \nfive members and is chaired by an independent director. A separate supervisory board has three \nfull-time members (including a CBA secondee) and performs the duties typically associated with \nan audit committee. It reports directly to the general assembly of shareholders. \n \n16.  Management. VIB has a strong, stable 12-member board of management, many of whom \nhave worked for foreign banks in Viet Nam. The current CEO was VIB\u2019s chair from 2008 to 2013, \nand also served as the bank\u2019s CEO from 2006 to 2008. The senior management team members \nhave been with the bank for more than 8 years on average and bring in-depth knowledge. \n \n17.  Risk management. The independent, integrated risk management division reports to the \nCEO, with indirect reporting to the board risk management committee. The risk management \ndivision, which is headed by the chief risk officer, has seven departments: two for credit appraisal \n(retail and wholesale including financial institutions), two for collections (retail and wholesale), \ncredit risk identification, credit risk policy, and risk monitoring and compliance. VIB is one of 10 \nbanks participating in the SBV Basel II pilot and has been calculating its capital adequacy ratio \n(CAR) under Basel II on a fully automated basis since FY2016. It was also the first private bank \nto comply with and qualify for Basel II. \n \n \n21 CBA is the largest Australian bank by profit before tax, total assets, and total equity, and is one of four dominant \nAustralian banks in consumer lending, particularly mortgages. \n22 As of June 2020, CBA had A$963,747 million in total assets, A$68,075 million in shareholder equity, and A$10,168 \nmillion in net income.  \n23 ADB. 2003.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n18.  ADB will provide a 3-year senior unsecured A loan to VIB of up to $100,000,000. ADB \nexpects to syndicate a B loan of up to $100,000,000 among commercial banks and other eligible \nB loan participants on a commercially reasonable efforts basis and subject to market conditions. \nADB will also provide a transaction technical assistance (TA) of up to $500,000 that will facilitate \nincreased lending to WSMEs.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Use of proceeds. Half of the ADB A loan will be used to support SMEs24, including \nWSMEs. 25 The balance will be used for home improvement loans.26 The B loan will be used for \nretail business loans and housing finance, including home improvements. \n \n20.  Monitoring and reporting. ADB will monitor the project throughout its duration. VIB will, \nat predetermined regular intervals and as requested, provide ADB with financial reports including \n(i) quarterly unaudited financial statements; (ii) annual audited financial statements; (iii) quarterly \ncompliance  certificates for  financial  covenants;  (iv)  semiannual reporting  on  the  SME  loan \nportfolio; (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed upon by ADB and VIB, \nincluding  on  gender  targets  and  initiatives;  and  (vi)  an  annual  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system performance report. \n \n21.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB at least annually. \nThe first report will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n22.  Strengthening the banking sector. As noted, Viet Nam\u2019s banking sector is evolving and \nhas made progress in addressing some of its systemic problems. Since 2010, several banks have \nbeen building their retail and small business portfolios to respond to pent-up customer demand \nfrom years of lacking standard bank products. To support the growth of its SME and home \nimprovement loan portfolio, which entail longer-tenor loans, VIB needs longer-tenor financing to \ncomply with regulatory requirements restricting the ratio of short-term funding to long-term funding \nand to reduce maturity mismatch risk. Long-tenor funding is not readily available given the \nrelatively underdeveloped nature of the country\u2019s capital markets, and ADB\u2019s funding will address \nthis market gap. \n \n23.  Supporting the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises, including those \nowned and/or led by women. ADB funding will support the growth of SMEs, which are the \nbackbone of the Vietnamese economy and important for job creation and economic recovery \nduring and after the COVID-19 pandemic. By partnering with a bank with a large network, \nincluding in the digital space, and an established and growing SME business line, ADB can \n \n24 VIB defines SMEs as companies with annual revenues of up to D400 billion. \n25 WSMEs are defined by either (i) being at least 51% owned by women or a woman, or (ii) meeting all of the following \n3 sub-criteria: (a) it is at least 20% owned by a woman or women, (b) a woman is the senior or second most senior \nexecutive, and (c) at least 30% of the board members are women (where a board exists). \n26 ADB\u2019s funding will only be used for owner-occupied properties.  \n ", "7 \nmaximize its development footprint. Targeting women borrowers is new for banks in Viet Nam \nand, given VIB\u2019s visibility in the market, this intervention is expected to serve as an example to \nother banks. ADB will work closely with VIB and through TA to reach out to more WSMEs with a \npromotional campaign, train women on applying for bank loans, gender-disaggregating VIB\u2019s \nmanagement information system, and providing internal training to VIB staff on how to better \nserve WSMEs. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \n24.  Improving living conditions. By providing long-term funding to VIB to grow its home \nimprovement loan portfolio further, ADB will contribute to better quality housing, which will help \nViet Nam achieve its goals of increasing productivity and inclusive urban growth. An estimated \n350,000 people move to Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi each year, and the population of Viet Nam\u2019s \nmajor cities has grown at around 3% each year since 2010, reaching 9 million in Ho Chi Minh City \nand 8 million in Hanoi. This influx means that demand for new housing units in Ho Chi Minh City \nand Hanoi combined is about 250,000 a year. With approximately 60,000 units being constructed \nper year, demand far exceeds supply, particularly for moderate and lower income people.27 \nTherefore, new homes and existing home stock upgrades are essential. \n \n25.  Catalyzing private sector funding. ADB is expected to provide a B loan of up to $100 \nmillion,  thereby  mobilizing  private  financing  for  VIB  and  providing  an  important  source  of \ndiversified funding to support the growth of their mortgage and retail business loans. \n \nD.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nE.  Technical Assistance \n \n26.  The $500,000 TA will help VIB better meet the needs of WSMEs through (i) collecting \nsurvey data to assess the impact of COVID-19 and ADB\u2019s assistance to WSMEs; (ii) developing \nVIB\u2019s capacity to serve women by developing targeted marketing materials, training loan officers \non gender biases, and introducing a gender-disaggregated management information system; and \n(iii) training women entrepreneurs on applying for bank loans.28 A grant from We-Fi will fund the \nTA; it will be the first ADB nonsovereign project that benefits from We-Fi support.29 The integration \nof the TA is also an example of \u201cOne ADB\u201d collaboration, with departments across ADB working \ntogether closely to develop and implement the TA to maximize the impact of ADB\u2019s lending. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n27.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impacts: Viet Nam\u2019s vision for socially \nequitable economic development, the National Action Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 \nSustainable Development Agenda,30 better access to finance for the underserved population and \nSMEs, and the development of the finance and housing sector as promulgated by the Housing \nLaw of 2015, and Law on Supporting Small and Medium Enterprises .  \n \n27 D.

The project will increase financing to SMEs in a more gender equitable manner. \nIt will also help VIB increase its home improvement loan portfolio. \n \n29.  Outputs. The project\u2019s outputs will be (i) increased capacity of VIB to serve SMEs and \nWSMEs; (ii) strengthened capacity of VIB to serve women entrepreneurs; (iii) enhanced capacity \nof women entrepreneurs; and (iv) increased capacity of VIB to expand home improvement loans.  \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n30.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The transaction supports the \nfollowing key operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities, (ii) making cities livable, and (iii) accelerating progress in gender equality \nthrough  the  gender  action  plan.  Without  access  to  formal  financial  services,  underserved \nsegments of the population will be excluded from the growth process and its benefits. According \nto ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u2013202031 and country operations business plan, 2021\u2013\n202332 for Viet Nam, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will support investments that promote more \ninclusive economic growth based on promoting job creation and competitiveness. The proposed \ntransaction will support the development of SMEs and improvement of living conditions in Viet \nNam, which is part of the inclusive economic growth objective of the country partnership strategy \nand also a high government priority, and will complement ADB\u2019s efforts to strengthen the financial \nsector under the Financial Sector Development and Inclusion Program.33  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n31.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009)34 as follows: environment (category FI), involuntary resettlement (category FI \ntreated as C), and indigenous peoples (category FI treated as C).  \n \n32.  ADB has conducted a desktop review of the investment's potential environment and social \nimpacts, its risks associated with VIB\u2019s existing or likely future portfolio, and its commitment and \ncapacity for environmental and social management. VIB will use the proposed loan to support \nSMEs and home loan improvements. VIB has an existing environment and social management \nsystem (ESMS) that defines procedures and institutional arrangements to identify, mitigate and \naddress environmental and social impacts. The review, however, identified the need to enhance \nVIB\u2019s existing ESMS to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and social requirements. \nVIB will enhance its existing ESMS prior to disbursement. The enhanced ESMS will (i) harmonize \nthe VIB exclusion list with the ADB prohibited investment activity list; (ii) enhance screening \nprocedures to determine the risk categorization based on the definition in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement to indicate clearly credit accounts\u2019 risks to the environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples; (iii) develop and provide environment, social, health and safety training \nto staff and relevant third parties; and (iv) develop a systematic documentation of the grievances \nreceived and actions carried out to resolve the issues. VIB will also ensure compliance with \n \n31 ADB. 2016.

VIB  will  not  use  ADB  funding  to  finance  projects  classified  as  category  A  for \nenvironmental impacts or category A or B for involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. VIB \nwill report annually to ADB on its compliance with environmental and social requirements and with \nnational and international laws and standards.  \n \n33.  Effective gender mainstreaming. VIB, like many banks in the Vietnamese market, does \nnot currently prioritize WSMEs, resulting in a lack of information on their needs,35 no targeted \nmarketing materials, and loan officers not sensitized to the business case for  WSMEs as \ncustomers. VIB has regulations against sexual harassment in its Code of Conduct. More than half \nof VIB\u2019s staff (57%) are female, with 41% of management roles and 60% of professional roles \nbeing held by women. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), VIB has \nincorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business \nactivities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: (i) increase the number of WSME \nborrowers; (ii) increase lending to WSMEs; (iii) improve understanding of the impact of VIB\u2019s \nlending on WSMEs; (iv) develop marketing materials targeting WSMEs; (v) train VIB staff on how \nto better serve WSMEs; and (vi) train women entrepreneurs on VIB loan products and application \nprocesses. VIB will submit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n34.  VIB was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n35.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nC.  Assurances \n \n36.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),36 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Viet \nNam has no objection to the proposed assistance to VIB. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$200,000,000, comprising (i) a senior unsecured A loan of up to $100,000,000 from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources and (ii) a B loan of up to $100,000,000 to Vietnam International \nCommercial Joint Stock Bank for the Vietnam International Bank Supporting Small and Medium-\nSized Enterprises and Improving Living Conditions Project in Viet Nam, with such terms and \n \n35 VIB does not currently have gender-disaggregated data on its borrowers.
