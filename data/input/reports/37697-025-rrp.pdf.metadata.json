The report also describes \nproposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Urban Environmental \nInfrastructure  Fund 1 under  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  the  Darkhan  Urban \nUtility  Institutional  Improvement  Action  Plan,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loans,  I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.2 \n \n2. \nThe project will support environmentally sustainable urban development and better living \nstandards  in  Darkhan  soum  (district),  Mongolia.  It  will  improve  the  city\u2019s  wastewater \nmanagement  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  through  (i)  a  modern  wastewater  treatment \nplant  (WWTP),  (ii) a  more  efficient  sewer  system  and  pumping  stations,  and  (iii)  institutional \ncapacity development and policy dialogue. The project will promote poverty alleviation in a city \nwith  27.0%  poverty  incidence  and  contribute  to  a  more  balanced  national  urban  system  and \nstronger urban\u2013rural relationships by supporting urban and industrial development of a second-\ntier city in Mongolia. It will help improve cross-border water quality management and the water \nquality of the Kharaa River, which drains into Lake Baikal in the Russian Federation.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDarkhan-Uul  aimag  (province)  is  Mongolia\u2019s  third-largest  province  with  a  registered \npopulation  of  92,000  and  an  urban  population  in  Darkhan  soum  of  76,400, 4  of  which  an \nestimated  40.0%  live  in  ger  (traditional  tent)  areas.5 Darkhan  is  located  220  kilometers  (km) \nnorth  of  Ulaanbaatar  and  130  km  south  of  the  border  with  the  Russian  Federation.  Darkhan \nenjoys  favorable  conditions  for  farming  and  is  rich  in  mineral  deposits.  It  was  founded  as  an \nindustrial  hub  in  1961,  and  benefits  from  the  Trans-Mongolian  rail  line  and  an  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)-supported  road  that  connects  Ulaanbaatar  with  Darkhan  and  the \nLake Baikal region.6 Few industrial investments were made in recent years. Darkhan-Uul\u2019s gross \ndomestic product doubled between 2010 and 2013 and it is becoming an urban economy\u2014the \nservice sector grew from 29.4% to 41.9% of gross domestic product during that period. In 2012, \nto strengthen development of second-tier cities and to mitigate migration to Ulaanbaatar, where \nalmost half the country\u2019s population resides, the government decided for Darkhan to become a \nnational model city for urban sustainability and livability with a vision of becoming a \u201csmart and \ngreen city\u201d by 2028. An urban development master plan for Darkhan is under preparation. The \ngovernment plan for Darkhan includes improvements of existing urban districts and ger areas, \nurban  expansion  in  the  form  of  new  industrial  and  residential  areas,  strengthened  academic \ninstitutions, expanded and new public parks, and environmental protection zones. By 2020, the \nregistered  population  in  Darkhan  soum  is  estimated  to  grow  to  83,000,  with  75.0%  of  the \npopulation  living  in  formalized  and  fully  serviced  residential  districts.  These  industrial  and \n\n                                                \n1   Financing partner: the Government of Sweden. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Funding  of  consultant  services  for  project  preparation  in  the  amount  of  $200,000  under  the  Water  Financing \n\nPartnership Facility was approved on 17 July 2013 (WFMFDC00100-MON), and administered by ADB. \n4  An additional transient population accounts for approximately 8,000, which is being added for calculations. \n5  Based on Darkhan Land Administration Office estimates. \n6  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance  Grant  to  Mongolia  for  the  Roads  Development  Project.  Manila  (Loan  1364-MON  supported  road \nimprovements of the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Altanbulag road connecting key economic centers and the three largest cities of \nMongolia\u2014Ulaanbaatar, Erdenet, and Darkhan). \n\n\fresidential  developments  will  increase  demand  for  urban  services,  including  water  supply  and \nwastewater  treatment.  Investment  in  infrastructure  is  needed  to  meet  present  and  future \ndemand  from  improved  and  expanded  services,  and  to  support  clustering  of  new  businesses \nand industries.  \n \n4. \nThe  city\u2019s  WWTP,  and  the  sanitary  sewer  system  and  pumping  stations  were  built  in \n1965,  and  degraded  despite  partial  expansion  in  1987.7 They  are  in  urgent  need  of  structural \nrehabilitation  or  replacement.  The  WWTP  was  significantly  overdesigned  with  a  capacity  of \n50,000  cubic  meters  per  day  (m3/day)  and  never  fully  utilized.  It  operates  at  8,000  m3/day\u2013\n10,000  m3/day  (summer  and  winter)  with  peak  flows  of  15,000  m3/day.  Many  components  are \nunderutilized or unused and dilapidated. Even operating units are in need of serious repair. Of \nthe total 223 km of sewer pipes, 65.0% were built in 1965, and since 2010 domestic funding has \nfinanced  some  sewer  rehabilitation.  Three  sewer  sections  and  two  pumping  stations  are  in \nserious  need  of  replacement  or  repair  and  critical  for  system  functionality.  Sanitation  in  ger \nareas  currently  comes  in  the  form  of  on-plot  pit  latrines,  which  cause  soil  and  groundwater \npollution. Wastewater is not currently collected in ger areas. Plans for incremental extension of \nthe  sewer  network  into  ger  areas  have  been  prepared  for  government  financing.8 The WWTP \ntreats domestic sewage along with nontoxic industrial wastewater. Industrial pretreatment plants \nremove toxic elements (e.g., from sheepskin processing). A slight temperature and precipitation \nincrease  is  expected  due  to  climate  change.  The  frequency  of  droughts  and  floods,  and  the \nresulting  variability  of  the  Kharaa  River\u2019s  water  flow,  is  projected  to  increase.9 Breakdowns  of \nthe current domestic and industrial wastewater collection and treatment system cause untreated \nwater to discharge into the groundwater and the Kharaa River. The existing WWTP will further \ndeteriorate  rapidly  and  soon  fail\u2014the  remaining  life  of  the  facility  has  been  estimated  at  just \n2 years. Moreover, planned and anticipated urban and industrial growth cannot be served by the \nexisting system. \n \n5. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  system  and  ensure \ncontinuous  treatment  throughout  implementation.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  more  than \n45,000  residents  (around  60.0%  of  the  urban  population)  currently  connected  to  the  sanitary \nsewer  system  and,  indirectly,  more  than  76,400  residents.  Once  in  operation,  it  is  anticipated \nthat planned developments and a further expanded sewer system will increase the beneficiary \npopulation to 62,000 residents (around 75.0% of the urban population) connected to the system \nby 2020. The project will support improvement of the city\u2019s wastewater management, its central \nWWTP,  sewer  system,  and  pumping  stations.  It  will  also  support  institutional  development, \ntraining, project management, and policy dialogue. \n \nThe project was requested by the Government of Mongolia for ADB consideration.10 It is \n6. \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016  for  Mongolia  and  is  aligned \nwith  the  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132016  for  Mongolia.11 With  its  objective  to \ncontribute to inclusive economic and environmentally sustainable growth, the project is aligned \n\n                                                \n7  Darkhan has a sanitary sewer system that collects domestic and industrial wastewater. Runoff from precipitation is \ncollected separately in drainage channels. The sewer pipes will be extended under newly planned and built roads. \n8   Studies  to  improve  the  water  and  wastewater  management  systems  by  a  German  Government  funded  technical \n\nassistance \u201cMoMo\u201d and by the Cities Development Initiative for Asia have been considered. \n\n9  The Kharaa River basin has a dry winter continental climate with a current annual mean temperature of around 0\u00b0C \nand mean precipitation of 320 millimeters.

The  project  is  aligned  with  the  Government  Action  Plan,  2012\u20132016,  including  its \nobjectives of improving centralized wastewater systems in aimag centers, enforcing the Law on \nWater  Supply  and  Sewer  Use,  and  supporting  the  expansion  of  industrial  development  in \nDarkhan  soum.  Lessons  learned  from  previous  urban  and  water  sector  projects  in  Mongolia \ninclude the selection of adequate wastewater treatment technology tested in cold climates, and \nmanagement  of  contractor  accountability  by  selecting  the  plant:  design,  supply,  and  install \nprocurement  modality  for  the  WWTP  to  minimize  risks  of  delay,  mismatch  of  structure  and \nequipment,  and  failure  during  operations.  The  project  supports  the  sustainability  of  and \ncomplements previous ADB assistance to Darkhan.13 To structurally rehabilitate and retrofit an \nexisting  WWTP  will  be  a  demonstration  feature  and  serve  as  a  model  for  other  cities  in  the \nregion with comparable conditions. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n7. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  better  living  conditions  and  an  improved  environment  in \nDarkhan  soum  and  the  Kharaa  River  basin.  The  project  outcome  will  be  improved  system  of \nwastewater collection and treatment for domestic and industrial users in Darkhan soum. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput  1:  Improved wastewater  treatment  plant. The project will establish a modern \n8. \nWWTP  in  Darkhan  by  renovating those  components  of the  existing facility  that  are structurally \nsound,  constructing  on-site  the  required  new  components,  and  installing  new  equipment \nthroughout the facility. A new, effective, and energy-efficient treatment process will be adopted, \nsuitable for the cold climate and meeting national and international effluent standards. The base \noperating capacity will be 16,000 m3/day with a peak capacity of 24,000 m3/day. \n \n9. \nOutput 2: Rehabilitated pumping stations and sewer pipes. The project will improve \nthe  wastewater  collection  system  by  replacing  1,800  meters  of  dilapidated  sewer  pipes  and \ncomplementing earlier investment programs of sewer network rehabilitation by the government. \nTwo  existing  pumping  stations  will  be  structurally  renovated  and  fully  and  newly  equipped, \nensuring delivery of the wastewater to the treatment plant at higher energy efficiency. \n \n10. \nOutput 3: Project management support and capacity development. The project will \n(i)  provide  expert  support  for  project  management,  institutional  enhancement,  and  capacity \ndevelopment in utility management, operation, and service provision; emergency preparedness \nand  response;  and  detailed  technical  design  and  construction  supervision;  and  (ii)  strengthen \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2014.

The objective of the TA is to \nimprove effectiveness, efficiency, and customer orientation toward a corporatized utility service \nmanagement.  The  TA  will  produce  three  outputs:  (i)  institutional,  financial,  managerial,  and \noperational performance assessment; (ii) Darkhan urban utility institutional improvement action \nplan; and (iii) capacity building, training, and action plan implementation support. The TA will be \nimplemented over 24 months. An international consulting firm will be engaged using the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  TA  will  require  33  person-months  of  consulting \nservices,  of  which  12  person-months  are  international  and  21  person-months  are  national \ninputs.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $430,000,  of  which  $400,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant \nbasis by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund19 under the Urban Financing Partnership \nFacility and administered by ADB.20The government will provide counterpart support in the form \nof  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  project  is  technically  feasible  based  on  detailed  technical  assessment  and \n17. \nevaluation of wastewater management systems in extremely cold climate conditions around the \nworld and in Mongolia with temperature drops to \u201340oC, as well as on detailed analysis of the \nlocal  conditions  and  existing  facilities  and  structures.  The  proposed  wastewater  treatment \ntechnology  has  been  subjected  to  intensive  scrutiny  and  analysis,  resulting  in  a  short  list  of \ntechnology  choices  most  appropriate  for  operation  in  Darkhan.  A  three-stage  process  was \nadopted to evaluate alternative wastewater treatment solutions and select the best and lowest-\npossible cost solution. The evaluation concluded that the structural rehabilitation of the existing \ntreatment  plant,  retrofitted  with  a  new  treatment  process  (a  modified  activated  sludge  process \nusing  new  equipment  and  technology),  is  the  lowest-possible  cost  option  and  will  provide \ntreatment  quality  that  will  be  at  least  as  good  as  the  other  considered  options.  The  selected \ntechnology  is  called  integrated  fixed-film  activated  sludge.  Measures  to  mitigate  possible \n                                                \n19 Financing partner: the Government of Sweden. \n20 Funding of the capacity development TA for the Darkhan Urban Utility Institutional Improvement Action Plan was \n\napproved by the Urban Financing Partnership Facility Steering Committee on 25 August 2014. \n\n \n\n\foperational and lifetime risks will be implemented, including (i) ensuring that the WWTP can be \noperated  throughout the  entire reconstruction  process  while  meeting  treatment standards;  and \n(ii)  managing  possible  cost  increases,  because  the  level  of  rehabilitation  of  existing  structures \ncannot  be  fully  evaluated  until  the  facility  is  empty.  A  thorough  phasing  plan  to  ensure \ncontinuous treatment and two independent studies by structural engineering units were carried \nout to manage these issues. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n18. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  analysis  examined  the  economic  viability  of  the \nproject. The project is expected to generate economic benefits from (i) better urban quality of life \nthrough reduced health risks from waterborne diseases, (ii) improved water quality and aquatic \nthe  Kharaa  River,  and  (iii)  preparedness  for  wastewater  management \nbiodiversity  of \ninfrastructure  expansion  into  the  growing  urban  and  industrial  areas.  The  without-project \nscenario  will  be  loss  of  wastewater  treatment  within  2  years.  Evaluation  of  various  technology \noptions  and  layouts  confirmed that  the  selected project  is the  least-cost option. The  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  base  case  is  13.7%;  tests  for  sensitivity  to  capital \ninvestment,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  cost  overruns  confirm  economic  viability \nwith EIRRs of 12.0% and 12.4%, respectively. However, a decrease in benefits and a delay in \nimplementation  by  1  year  result  in  EIRRs  of  10.5%  and  10.3%,  slightly  below  the  economic \nopportunity cost of capital. Project economic benefits are quantified based on willingness to pay \nfor  improved  wastewater  management  service  using  the  contingent  valuation  method.  The \nbenefit  streams  from  incremental  and  nonincremental  wastewater  treated  by  the  proposed \nWWTP  are  compared  with  cost  streams  that  include  capital  investment  and  O&M  costs  to \ndetermine  the  discounted  net  cash  flows  and  the  resulting  EIRR.  Additional  benefits  such  as \npublic health, environmental improvement, and attractiveness for investments are not quantified.  \n \n19. \nFinancial analysis. The financial analysis confirmed that the project is financially viable \nbased  on  assumptions  of  a  slight  increase  in  water  and  wastewater tariffs,  improved technical \nand  managerial  efficiencies,  improved  billing,  and  incremental  growth  and  expansion  of  the \nclient  base.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  3.1%  for  the  base  case  against  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  calculated  at  1.4%.  Sensitivity  tests  evaluated  the  effects  of \nadverse  financial  conditions  on  project  financial  viability.  Increases  in  capital  and  O&M  costs \nresult in FIRRs of 2.3% (both), a reduction in revenue results in a FIRR of 1.5%, and a 1-year \ndelay incurs a FIRR of 1.9%, all above the weighted average cost of capital. Subsidies may be \nneeded in certain years and are guaranteed by DAG, should any financial shortfall occur during \nthe  O&M  phase.  The  affordability  analysis  confirms  that  the  proposed  tariffs  are  within \nwillingness to pay and affordability limits, including for the poor. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n20. \nThe MRTCUD and DAG have extensive experience in cooperation and management of \nprojects  financed  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  such  as  ADB,  German  development \ncooperation  through  GIZ,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the  United  States \nAgency for International Development, and the World Bank. The lessons from implementing and \nmanaging ADB-financed projects will be passed on to the PMU under the MRTCUD and the PIU \nunder DAG. Special emphasis will be given to the procurement capacity by engaging qualified \nspecialists  for  the  PMU  and  PIU,  and  the  provision  of  training  at  the  onset  of  project \nimplementation  by  the  loan  implementation  consultants  engaged  under  output 3.  Project \nfinancial management will be carried out by the PMU and PIU for implementation-related funds \nflow management with final approval by the Ministry of Finance. The DAG as end borrower and \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fDUS  as  operating  unit  have  reasonable  financial  management  capacity  and  the  weaknesses \nidentified  in  the  financial  management  assessment  will  be  overcome  by  engaging  financial \nspecialists  for  the  PMU  and  PIU,  and  through  training  and  financial  management  support \nprovided by the loan implementation consultants. These arrangements are deemed adequate. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and agencies concerned during project preparation, including the Ministry \nof Economic Development, Ministry of Finance, MRTCUD, DAG, and DUS. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nindirect \n\nincluding \n\nlong-term \n\nincome-generating  opportunities, \n\nPoverty  incidence  in  Darkhan  is  significant  at  27%  citywide  and  44%  in  ger  areas.  It \n22. \nreflects  a  high  unemployment  rate  of  14.3%  (compared  with  a  national  average  of  8.2%), \nimmigration of rural poor, and expansion of unserviced ger areas. Lack of wastewater treatment \nresults  in  unsanitary  living  conditions  and  limited  interest  to  invest  in  Darkhan  due  to \nunderdeveloped conditions. The project will directly benefit 12,153 households in the apartment \nareas,  and  1,699  public  and  private  entities  currently  connected  to  the  sewer  system  in \nDarkhan.  Indirect  beneficiaries  of  the  project  are  all  residents  of  Darkhan  soum  (more  than \n76,400  persons)  who  will  benefit from  the  project  through (i)  an  increase in  business  activities \nand job creation in Darkhan soum, (ii) better sanitary and health conditions, and (iii) a healthier \nurban and river environment. The project will improve treatment and management of domestic \nand  industrial  wastewater  in  Darkhan  soum,  and  will  create  direct  short-term  employment  in \nconstruction  and \nindustrial \ndevelopment  in  Darkhan.  It  will  benefit  the  poor  and  vulnerable  households  in  the  apartment \narea by improving their health conditions and reducing their health-care expenditure, which now \naccrues from illness caused by poor water quality and unsanitary environment conditions. Under \nthe project, the population, especially the poor and women, will participate in the improvement \nprocess for the city\u2019s public services. It is estimated that 70 jobs (40 skilled, 30 unskilled) will be \ncreated, and that most unskilled jobs will be provided to local people, including the poor, and at \nleast 30.0% will be for women. The implementing agency will ensure that Mongolian labor laws \nand the core labor standards are followed. Specific measures to ensure the poverty and social \nbenefits are in the social action plan (SAP) within the PAM (footnote 16). \n \n23. \nA  SAP  was  prepared  to  ensure  continued  consultation  and  participation  of  the  local \ncommunity  during  project  implementation.  Actions  include  (i)  public  awareness  program  on \nsanitation  and  public  health  issues;  (ii)  public  hearing  on  wastewater  tariff  increases;  and \n(iii) targets  for  employment  of  local  men,  women,  and  the  poor  during  construction  and \noperation.  Implementation  will  be  monitored  through  the  project  performance  management \nsystem, project progress reports, and ADB missions. \n \n24. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  some  gender  elements,  so  no  gender  action  plan \nhas been developed. The SAP includes activities that are targeted at both men and women. As \nfor women, the project will (i) ensure their participation in the public awareness campaign on the \nimportance  of  the  project  and  training  on  maintaining  sanitation  facilities  properly  (40.0%  of \nparticipants), (ii) ensure their participation in tariff increase consultations (40.0% of participants), \nand (iii) provide employment opportunities for them during construction. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n25. \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  since  it  is  not \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fexpected  to  have  unprecedented  or  irreversible  impacts  on  the  environment.  A  draft  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  including  an  environmental management  plan,  has  been  prepared \nin  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  the  Government  of  Mongolia\u2019s \nregulatory  framework.  Short-term  impacts  are  anticipated  during  construction,  including  dust \nand  noise  generated  during  sewer-line  replacement  work,  and  inappropriate  solid  and  liquid \nwaste  management  at  construction  sites,  which  could  pollute  the  Kharaa  River.  Mitigation \nmeasures have been defined in the environmental management plan to reduce these impacts to \nacceptable  levels.  During  construction,  continuous  wastewater  treatment  will  be  maintained  at \ncurrent  levels.  During  operation,  no  significant  environmental  impact  is  anticipated.  O&M \ntraining  and  monitoring  of  treatment  performance  will  minimize  operational  impacts  and  risks. \nThe  project  will  have  substantial  environmental  and  socioeconomic  benefits.  By  strengthening \nDarkhan\u2019s  municipal  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  capacity  it  will  provide  protection  of \nand improvement to Kharaa River's water environment.  21 The project's climate risk is medium. \nThe  projected  increase  in  average  and  peak  precipitation,  and  the  related  risk  of  more  urban \nstormwater  runoff,  will  be  adequately  managed  with  separate  wastewater  and  stormwater \ncollection systems. \n \n26. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement because it  will  n o t   have significant LAR  impacts. No residential land or structures \nwill be affected by the project. A resettlement plan was prepared in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and endorsed by DAG and the MRTCUD, disclosed to the affected persons, \nand  uploaded  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  12  August  2014.  Eight  entities  will  be  affected,  i.e.,  two \nsmall  enterprises,  three  commercial  entities,  and  three  state  budget  institutions.  Five  affected \nentities will lose a total of 2,711.1 square meters of land. All losses are partial. State institutions \nand  private  companies  own  the  land.  Fences  and  gates  of  three  entities  with  a  total  length  of \n112  meters  will  be  affected.  Other  affected  structures  include  entrance  stairs  to  two  shops,  a \nspeed  bump,  and  a  billboard.  Two  businesses  will  experience  a \nimpact. \nCompensation for lost assets and resettlement allowances will be paid to affected persons. The \nPMU under the MRTCUD is responsible for all management, communication, and coordination \nwork  during  project  preparation  and  implementation.  The  PIU  under  DAG  has  overall \nresponsibility  for  LAR.  This  includes  preparation,  implementation,  financing,  and  interagency \ncoordination of all related tasks. The MRTCUD is experienced in implementing ADB-funded and \nLAR activities. The loan implementation resettlement consultant will provide training and support \nto the PMU and PIU to ensure smooth implementation. A grievance redress mechanism will be \nestablished, and the PIU will conduct semiannual monitoring and evaluation of resettlement plan \nimplementation,  assisted  by  the  loan  implementation  resettlement  consultant.  DAG  confirmed \nthat all funds for involuntary resettlement compensation will be available on time. \n \n27. \nIndigenous  peoples. The project is classified as category C for indigenous people. No \nspecific  communities  of  ethnic  minorities  or  groups  are  living  in  concentrated  areas  and  no \nadverse impacts are expected. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\ntemporary \n\n28. \nThe  overall  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs  and  risks  involved. \nMajor  risks  and mitigating measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.22  \n                                                \n21 The WWTP will remove significant amounts of pollutants that would otherwise be discharged into the Kharaa River, \nincluding  chemical  oxygen  demand  (3,000  tons  per  year),  biological  oxygen  demand  (1,700  tons  per  year), \nnitrogen (330 tons per year), and phosphorous (42 tons per year). \n\n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nPublic financial management \nissues, weak fund-flow \nmanagement, and little \ncapacity to manage foreign \nexchange risks \nInefficient procurement and \ncorruption risk \n\nDAG project implementation \ncapacity is limited and may \ncause delays \nUnforeseen flow rates and \ncomposition of wastewater \ncompromise treatment \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nDAG\u2019s financial reporting systems will be upgraded with support from the PIU and \nloan implementation consultants to enable DAG to track project proceeds from \nsources and payments to final beneficiaries. Consulting services during \nimplementation will assist with public financial management, fund-flow support, and \naudit reporting. \nProcurement specialists will be recruited for the PMU and PIU, and consultants will \nprovide training before procurement starts and bridge gaps that may impede project \neffectiveness. Relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) are included in the loan documents and will be part of the bidding documents. \nThe MRTCUD will annually disclose the status of the use of project proceeds. \nConsultants will (i) provide training and support, including financial management, \nproject and contract management, and performance monitoring and reporting; and \n(ii) review and guide optimization of design, equipment specification, and operation. \nDAG and DUS capacity to enforce national discharge standards for industries \ndischarging effluent into public sewers will be strengthened. Emergency monitoring, \nearly warning, and response systems will be developed.
