I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nCorridor 1 (Taraz Bypass) Project.1 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The project will develop a 65-kilometer (km) road section in Taraz of Zhambyl Oblast in \nKazakhstan, which is part of the Government of Kazakhstan\u2019s priority Western Europe\u2013Western \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China Corridor Investment Program. The investment program aims to \nimprove approximately 2,787 km of road sections in Kazakhstan along CAREC Corridor 1, \nrunning from  Khorgos  through  Almaty  and  Shymkent  to the  Russian  Federation's  western \nborder. When the investment program is completed in 2015, the corridor is expected to more \nefficiently carry increasing international traffic. \n3.  The project is compatible with the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy and \nAction Plan,2 and the core business areas of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Kazakhstan. \n4.  The investment program has been smoothly implemented since its start in 2009, with \nassistance from international financial institutions. The European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment is financing a 102 km road section and the World Bank a 1,062 km road section. \nThe Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and \nADB committed to improving a 480 km section in Zhambyl Oblast through the investment \nprogram.3 Specifically, ADB committed to finance approximately 301 km through a multitranche \nfinancing facility (MFF) not exceeding $700 million,4 IDB committed to finance 159 km,5 and \nJICA 20 km. \n5.  Since 2008, ADB has provided four loans totaling $697 million under the MFF, which \nfinanced improvement of approximately 351 km of road sections;6 IDB provided a $170 million \nloan in 2009 for 57 km; and JICA provided a $68 million loan in 2010 for 20 km. \n6.  Financial issues caused IDB to withdraw in 2010 its earlier commitment to finance \nimprovement of two remaining sections, totaling 114 km, which the government then requested \nthat ADB finance. The seamless completion of all road sections in Zhambyl Oblast is crucial for \nthe success of the investment program, and consequently ADB approved, with available funds \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The section is part of CAREC Corridor 1, one of the six priority transport corridors under the CAREC Transport and \nTrade Facilitation Strategy. \n3  The total length for road improvement in Zhambyl Oblast has been updated to 493 km from 480 km. \n4 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility and Administration of Loan to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the CAREC Transport Corridor I \n(Zhambyl Oblast Section) [Western Europe\u2013Western People\u2019s Republic of China International Transit Corridor] \nInvestment Program. Manila. \n5  The total length for road improvement under IDB financing has been increased to 171 km from 159 km. \n6  The implementation of civil works for projects 1 and 2, started in 2010, is progressing satisfactorily. Projects 3 and \n4 are at an early stage; civil works for project 3 is expected to start in March 2012, and for project 4, in May 2012. \nThe development of intelligent transport system strategy, which will contribute to improved road operation and \nmaintenance will commence by November 2011. ", "2 \nunder the existing MFF, a $112 million loan in February 2011 as tranche 4 of the MFF to \nimprove a 49 km portion of IDB\u2019s former 114 km section.7 It is now proposed that ADB provide a \nseparate loan of $95 million to improve the 65 km Taraz bypass (the remaining portion of IDB\u2019s \nformer section), as the MFF has been fully utilized.  \n7.  The 65 km Taraz bypass section is integral to the transport corridor, connecting the oil-\nrich western part of the country to southeast Kazakhstan and beyond. The project will boost \nregional connectivity and strengthen the viability of the investment program roads. \n8.  Kazakhstan's 93,600 km road network includes 23,495 km of republican (national and \ninternational) roads, with the rest being rural and urban roads. Road freight traffic has increased \nas a result of growth in vehicular traffic and private road-hauling companies, shorter transport \nhauls of goods compared to other modes of transport, and a changing industrial and distribution \npattern. In 2009, roads accounted for 25% of Kazakhstan's freight traffic by ton-km and 85% of \nits passenger traffic by passenger-km. These shares are likely to continue  to grow in the \nforeseeable future. \n9.  Kazakhstan\u2019s road sector has operational and institutional bottlenecks, caused mainly by \n(i)  insufficient  and  deteriorating  infrastructure,  (ii)  weak  cost  recovery,  (iii) inefficient  cross-\nborder procedures, (iv) weak planning, and (v) limited project development and management \ncapacity.  These  bottlenecks  raise  transport  costs  and  hamper  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration opportunities, undercutting the country\u2019s competitiveness.  Based on the lessons \nlearned, ADB realized that sufficient support for institutional capacity development throughout \nthe duration of the projects has to be sustained. This is further described under implementation \narrangements (para. 15). \n10.  Much of the road network is in poor condition, as 40% of republican roads require major \nrehabilitation and proper maintenance. The feeder road network serving the rural population is \nnot fully developed. Roads on the six main international corridors are mostly paved with asphalt, \nbut their  technical  and operational  characteristics (e.g.,  evenness  and  strength)  are  below \ninternational standards, with current traffic often exceeding allowable loads. \n11.  The government has adopted the 2020 Strategy for Economic Development and the \nState  Program  on  Accelerated  Industrial-Innovative  Development  (SPAID)  to  diversify  the \neconomy and promote balanced developments. To effectively support the 2020 Strategy and \nSPAID, the government reshaped and expanded its previous road development plan into the \nTransport Sector Program (TSP) for 2010\u20132014.8 The TSP will develop an efficient transport \nsystem that is integrated into the international transport network. The project aligns with ADB's \nStrategy 2020,9 its country operations business plan for 2010\u20132011,10 and Kazakhstan's SPAID \nand TSP. \n                                                \n7  The maximum amount available under the MFF was limited. \n8  The 2020 Strategy for Economic Development was approved in February 2010; the SPAID was approved in March \n2010, and the TSP in July 2010. \n9  ADB. 2008.

Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project will contribute to regional cooperation and trade in Kazakhstan by helping \nthe  economy  better  integrate  into  the  global  economy.  The  outcome  will  ensure  better \nconnectivity for the Zhambyl Oblast section of the CAREC Transport Corridor 1. \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  an  approximate  7.7  km  upgraded  road,  from  category-II  to \ncategory-IB with four lanes; and (ii) an approximate 57.4 km new category-II bypass road. The \nupgrading of the existing 7.7 km section will be undertaken within the existing right-of-way; \nconstruction of the 57.4 km bypass will require land acquisition. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $123 million equivalent, inclusive of taxes and duties. \nThe government has requested a loan of $95 million from ADB to help finance the project. The \ngovernment will finance the balance. The loan, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, will have \na 24-year term, including a grace period of 4 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction will \nnot be capitalized in the loan and will be paid separately by the government), and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based \non  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \nTables 1 summarizes the project investment plan and Table 2 the financing plan. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) will be the executing agency \nand the Committee of Roads under MOTC will be the implementing agency. The program \nmanagement unit (PMU) within the Committee of Roads is in charge of four ongoing MFF \nprojects, assisted by the program management consultants, and will manage this project.11 \nFollowing  a  capacity  assessment  mission  in  July  2011,  it  was  determined  that  additional \nresources\u2014particularly safeguard, procurement, and contracts specialists staff\u2014will be needed \nto support the PMU in managing projects. These additional resources will be engaged under the \ntranche 1 loan (Loan 2503-KAZ) (footnote 4). MOTC has also planned for additional staff at the \noblast level. The terms of reference of the  supervision consulting firm engaged under the \ntranche 4 project (Loan 2735-KAZ) are sufficiently broad to enable it to provide supervision and \nsafeguards  implementation  management  for  this  project.  Therefore,  sufficient  additional \nresources have been planned to address overall management and supervision of this project. \nSufficient funds are available under the respective loans mentioned to finance the additional \nscope. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and further described in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).12 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2012\u2013December 2014 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2014 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Finance \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Transport and Communications \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Committee of Roads assisted by Zhambyl Road Department \n(iv) Implementation unit  PMU  Staff of 12 \nProcurement  ICB  1 contract  $112 million \nConsulting Services  Additional  program  management  consultants  will  be  engaged \nunder the tranche 1 loan (Loan 2503-KAZ) to be part of the PMU. \nConstruction  supervision  will  be  provided  by  the  supervision \nconsultants engaged under the tranche 4 loan (Loan 2735-KAZ).a \nAdvance contracting  Civil works \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the \nGovernment of Kazakhstan and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, PMU = program management unit.  \na ADB. 2008.

", "5 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n16.  The  65  km  road  section  will  pass  through  the  Baisak  and  Zhambyl  administrative \nsubdivisions (rayons) of Zhambyl Oblast. The 7.7 km section between km 483 and km 491 will \nbe upgraded to technical category IB, situated at the edge of Taraz City. The remaining 57.4 km \nsection between km 491 and km 536 (a two-lane bypass road around Taraz City) will be \nconstructed to technical category II specifications. The project involves (i) widening the 7.7 km \nsection from a two- to four-lane road with a center mall, and (ii) constructing a 57.4 km two-lane \nbypass for a design speed of 120 km per hour. All traffic lanes and shoulders on both sides will \nbe 3.75 meters wide. The 65 km sections will be paved with asphalt. The right-of-way is \ndesigned with a 200-meter buffer zone to keep the alignment away from the archaeological sites \nin  the  surrounding  area.  Crossing  two  rivers,  the  alignment  will  include  two  bridges,  four \ninterchanges, and railway overpasses paved with asphalt concrete.  The detailed design is \ncomplete including the preparation of the civil works bidding documents. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  The project will contribute to achieving the envisaged benefits of the improved transport \ncorridor: higher travel speeds, shortened travel distances, and improved road safety standards. \nThe economic evaluation of the project was undertaken using ADB's Guidelines for Economic \nAnalysis of Projects.13 The economic analysis compares the with- and without-project scenarios. \nThe methodology and general approach to the economic evaluation involved updating the \nprevious due diligence work carried out when the four Zhambyl Oblast road sections were \noriginally  analyzed,  individually  and  collectively,  to  prepare  the  (subsequently  approved) \nCAREC Transport Corridor I Investment Program. The construction costs and disbursement \nprogram have been updated, as well as values of time, vehicle operating cost, and time savings. \nThe economic costs are (i) capital, including physical contingencies but excluding taxes; and (ii) \noperation  and  maintenance,  including  replacing  of  depreciated  equipment.  The  economic \nbenefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating costs resulting from the improved project road, and \n(ii) time savings. The neighboring road sections remain under construction, and traffic on the \nproject road therefore remains unchanged. Using the 2009 average daily traffic volumes, annual \nnormal traffic growth was forecast at 4% for 2010\u20132014, and 6% thereafter.  Generated traffic, \nestimated  as  10%\u201330%  of  normal  traffic,  was  included  in  the  analysis.  The  project  is \neconomically feasible with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 13.5%. Sensitivity \ntests confirmed the project would remain feasible should the envisaged project costs increase, \nor benefits be reduced. No financial analysis was undertaken because the project road will not \ngenerate any revenues. \nC.  Governance \n18.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOTC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 12). The government\u2019s policies and procedures regarding \nfinancial management and procurement have been assessed and found to be lacking in some \nareas. The additional resources described under implementation arrangements (para. 15) will \nbe mobilized to manage and monitor compliance with these policies and procedures. \n                                                \n13  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.   \n ", "6 \n19.  All bidding documents for the civil works contract will include provisions specifying ADB\u2019s \nright to audit the committee\u2019s records and accounts related to the project, as well as those of all \ncontractors, suppliers, and other service providers as they relate to the project. Key measures to \nensure proper governance are (i) independent external auditing of contracts, project accounts, \nand financial statements; (ii) transparent decision processes for all procurement matters; and (iii) \nverification of contractors\u2019 payment claims by the supervising consultant and oversight by the \nPMU. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n20.  The average per capita income of Zhambyl Oblast is one of the lowest in Kazakhstan. \nThe main economic activities in the project area are agriculture,  and livestock and poultry \nraising. The project is expected to contribute to poverty reduction by stimulating economic \nactivities by improving the transport of goods and people and access to services. The project \nwill  also  benefit  local  residents  and  enterprises  by  creating  jobs  during  construction  and \nreducing transport cost and travel time. Social and poverty assessments are shown in the \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy.14 \n21.  The  project  is  classified  as  a general  intervention,  with  no  direct  poverty  reduction \ncomponent. It will benefit poor people in the project area by improving transport conditions for \nbetter access to social services. The project will create some job opportunities for women during \nimplementation and after project completion, apart from the benefits described above. \n22.  The  civil  works  contract  will  require  that  contractors  (i)  comply  with  Kazakhstan\u2019s \napplicable labor laws and related international treaty obligations and not employ child labor; (ii) \nprovide safe working conditions and separate sanitation facilities for male and female workers; \n(iii) provide equal wages to male and female workers for work of equal value; (iv) provide \nemployment opportunities for women; and (v) carry out HIV/AIDS, illicit drugs, and human \ntrafficking prevention and awareness programs in workers\u2019 campsites. \nE.  Safeguards \n1.  Environment \n \n23.  The project is classified as environment category A. MOTC prepared the environmental \nimpact  assessment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).15 Major \nanticipated  environmental  impacts  relate  to  construction  of  bridges,  railway  overpasses, \ninterchanges,  and  cutting  \u2015non-special  status\u2016  trees.  The  alignment  has  been  designed  to \nensure it does not encroach on archeological sites. Adequate mitigation measures are included \nin, and will be implemented through, the environmental management plan. The environmental \nmanagement  plan  stipulates  that  capacity  development  be  provided  for  MOTC  and  its \nconsultants through training workshops at the preconstruction and construction stages. The \nproject  management  consultants  (para.  15)  will  supplement  the  PMU  in  managing  the \nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  project,  including  through  capacity  development.  The  project \ncomplies with public disclosure and consultation requirements. \n                                                \n14 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) endorsed by the \ngovernment on 21 June 2011 and cleared by ADB on 4 July 2011. \n ", "7 \n2.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n24.  The project is classified as involuntary resettlement category B. Some 98 households \nand 10 legal entities will be affected by the project, but most impacts are expected to be minor, \nwith no households displaced under the project. Only five households will lose more than 10% \nof their land. Some 214 hectares of land will be acquired for permanent use, most of which (188 \nhectares) are leased on a long-term basis for agricultural use. \n25.  According to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the government has revised its earlier \ndraft land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP), which was prepared under IDB financing. \nThe final LARP includes adequate provisions for additional compensation for termination of land \nleases  and  for  assistance  for  the  severely  affected  households.  The  original  LARP  was \ndisclosed to displaced persons during several public consultations in 2009\u20132011, and brochures \nin Russian and Kazak were distributed. The original LARP was partially implemented in 2009 as \npart of the preparation for IDB financing.  Consultations on the final LARP were held  with \naffected persons during March\u2013May 2011. The final LARP has been disclosed. Supplemental \ncompensation  payments  amounting  to  T8.4  million,  to  be  funded  by  the  government,  are \nexpected  to  be  completed  by  December  2011.  Completion  of  LARP  implementation  is  a \ncondition  for  starting  civil  works.  The  government  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the  borrower and \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, as specified in the LARP. Adequate experienced staff \ncapacity for implementation of the LARP will be ensured by engaging an additional resettlement \nspecialist. An external monitoring consultant, engaged by ADB, will monitor and validate LARP \nimplementation. A community liaison group, recently established for ADB\u2019s CAREC Corridor 1 \ninvestment  program,  will  assist  in  disseminating  information  to  displaced  persons  and \ncommunities along the road and in resolving grievances arising from project activities. \n3.  Indigenous Peoples \n \n26.  The project is classified as indigenous peoples category C.
