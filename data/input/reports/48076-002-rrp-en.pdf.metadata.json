However,  this  project  will  highlight  what  PWDs  can  do  to \nensure inclusion of PWDs in society, including them in mainstream economic activities, creating \nopportunities in education and employment, and providing access to the services they need. It \nwill strengthen and institutionalize early identification of disability; improve service delivery and \naccess to the physical environment; improve employment prospects; and contribute to strategic \ndevelopment for PWDs, including social welfare reform, awareness raising, and attitude change.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe prevalence of disability in Mongolia of about 4% is based on the 2010 census and is \nlikely  to  be  underestimated.3 Disability  assessment  is  currently  based  on  an  outdated,  narrow \nmedical approach to determine work ability loss. Early diagnosis and identification of disability in \nchildren is underdeveloped, while older people are not recognized as disabled even if they require \nlong-term care. PWDs in Mongolia and their households represent a population subgroup with \nsubstantially higher incidence of poverty and lower human development indicators than the rest \nof  the  population.4 For  instance,  42%  of  households with  PWDs  live  in poverty  compared  with \n18%  of  households  without  PWDs,  28%  of  PWDs  aged  15\u201359  years  are  in  the  labor  force \ncompared  with  69%  of  those  without  disabilities,  and  43%  of  children  with  disabilities  (CWDs) \naged 6\u201318 years are unable to read compared with only 4% for people without disabilities. PWDs \nand the families of CWDs spend more on health services than nondisabled people, including for \nmedicine, diagnostic procedures, and travel costs associated with visiting the capital for tests that \nare not available in aimag (province) health centers. This increased expenditure contributes to \ngreater  levels  of  poverty  among  PWD  households.  Parents  consider  the  quality  of  education \nservices for CWDs as low, and disabled people\u2019s organizations (DPOs) report poor access for \nPWDs  to  tertiary  education.  The  project\u2019s  target  aimags  (Arkhangai,  Darkhan-uul,  Dornod, \nDundgovi, Khovd, and Khuvsgul) have a large proportion of PWDs and a high poverty ratio among \nPWDs. Based on proxy means test data, the percentage of PWDs in the bottom three deciles of \npoverty is 55% in the selected aimags and 44% in the other 15 aimags. \n \n4. \nPWDs,  especially  those  with  intellectual  disabilities,  typically  lack  access  to  education, \nhealth care, social protection, and employment, and are marginalized in society. Early diagnostic \nand intervention services for most CWDs are either unavailable or of poor quality. Poor access to \neducation at all levels means that PWDs are poorly prepared for employment compared with other \npeople. Lack of enforcement of the existing universal design standards and limited investment \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Ensuring \n\nInclusiveness and Service Delivery for Persons with Disabilities (TA 8850-MON). \n\n3  In 2010, the population of Mongolia was 2,754,685. \n4  Poverty and social analysis prepared under the TA (footnote 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fresult  in  poor  physical  access  to  public  buildings,  including  government  offices,  hospitals,  and \nschools, and to transportation facilities. These are all major impediments and often prevent PWDs \nfrom  accessing  basic  municipal  and  social  services  or  nearby  workplaces.  PWDs  face  huge \nbarriers  in  entering  job  markets  because  they  lack  skills,  and  companies  are  not  prepared  to \nprovide  jobs  for  the  disabled.5 Access  to  orthopedic  equipment  and  assistive  devices  is  very \nlimited,  especially  to  new  technologies  and  devices  based  on  information  and  communication \ntechnology, reducing the potential for PWDs to compensate for their disabilities and succeed at \nschool or in the workplace. Most people generally do not recognize PWDs as individuals capable \nof living independently and contributing positively to society. This is a major source of frustration \nfor PWDs, leading to feelings of vulnerability and rejection. The successive barriers encountered \nby PWDs during their lifetime underline the need for early childhood support that is sustained in \nschool and throughout their professional life to ensure successful inclusion in society. \n \n5. \nThe  Government  of  Mongolia  demonstrates  strong  commitment  to  international  rights \nframeworks  and  development  goals  on  disability. 6  This  is  especially  reflected  in  its  active \nengagement with the DPO community and the adoption of the new Law on the Rights of Persons \nwith  Disabilities  in  February  2016,  which  moves the  sector  paradigm  from  a  health and  social \nwelfare model based on a medical understanding of disability to a rights-based model built on a \nbiopsychosocial  understanding  of  disability  underpinned  by  the  International  Classification  of \nFunctioning, Disability, and Health (ICF).7 The new law represents an opportunity to address the \npoor human development indicators for PWDs. The priority areas for improvement identified by \nDPOs, the government, and experts are (i) early identification of disability, including prenatal and \npostnatal  screening  services,  to  ensure  early  intervention  to  minimize  the  impact  on  child \ndevelopment and subsequent education outcomes; (ii) maximum functioning and active economic \nparticipation  with  support  from  social  services,  habilitation,  and  rehabilitation; 8  (iii)  inclusive \neducation and employment services; (iv) improved enforcement of legislation on accessibility to \nthe  physical  environment,  transport,  and  information,  and  increased  availability  of  assistive \ndevices  and  technology;  and  (v)  strategic  measures  such  as  changing  attitudes  and  mindsets \ntoward PWDs, making the social welfare system more equitable and targeted, using the ICF to \nassess disability and planning services, and defining disability in monitoring and data frameworks. \n \n6. \nDPOs  in  Ulaanbaatar  seem  to  underrepresent  PWDs  in  rural  areas  and  those  with \nintellectual  disabilities.  The  organizations  provide  some  services  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  in  some \naimags,  but  compared  with  DPOs  in  other  countries,  they  have  a  limited  role  in  employment \npromotion.  DPOs  mainly  support  segregated  forms  of  employment,  such  as  sheltered \nemployment and self-employment, largely because (i) DPOs and public employment agency staff \nlack knowledge and skills to effectively support individual pathways to mainstream employment \nfor  PWDs,  and  (ii)  the  regulatory  framework  for  involving  DPOs  in  providing  employment  and \nsocial services is not well developed. \n\n                                                \n5  Private and public companies do not have policies on and knowledge of providing employment for the PWDs. \n6  International rights frameworks and development goals on disability include the Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities (United Nations. 2006. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. New York.), ratified by \nMongolia in 2008; the Incheon Strategy to \u201cMake the Right Real\u201d for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific \n(United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. 2012.  Incheon Strategy to \u201cMake the \nRight Real\u201d for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific. Bangkok); and the Sustainable Development Goals \nset  out  in  the  Mongolia  Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030  (State  Great  Khural.  2016.  Mongolia  Sustainable \nDevelopment Vision 2030. Ulaanbaatar). \n\n7  The ICF is a way of understanding disability as a social construct rather than a medical problem. Introducing the ICF \n\nwill enable Mongolia to develop policies and programs for removing barriers to PWDs participating in society. \n\n8  Habilitation focuses on learning new skills, whereas rehabilitation focuses on regaining lost skills. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nStrategic fit. The project strongly aligns with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Social \n7. \nProtection Strategy and Social Protection Operational Plan, 2014\u20132020.9 It will support renewed \nemphasis  on  social  protection  in  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  to  protect  the  most \nvulnerable  members  of  society.10 In  supporting  PWDs  through  social  protection  and  stronger \nsocial  safety  nets  to  ensure  decent  living  standards,  the  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020.11 The project also supports the implementation of \nthe  Mongolia  Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030  (footnote  6).  ADB  is  coordinating  project \ninputs  with  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  which  is  implementing  two \ntechnical assistance projects on disability in Mongolia, and a memorandum of understanding will \nbe signed before project implementation to ensure complementarity and avoid duplication.12 \n \n8. \nDisability puts women at a disadvantage, and factors such as age and poverty widen the \ngender gap. The poverty rate for women is typically higher than that for men, and poverty and \ndisability are associated. The disability rate for women, particularly those with severe disability, is \nhigher than for men at any age. Even so, analysis conducted during project preparation has shown \nthat disability among girls and women appears to be underreported, with men being 28% more \nlikely to be reported as disabled than women. Further, while 30% of men with disabilities aged \n15\u201359 years work, this percentage is only 25% for women. Moreover, 80% of people caring for \nPWDs are women, who often do not receive adequate social protection and support services. \n \nLessons  learned.  ADB  has  a  successful  record  in  social  protection  and  welfare  in \n9. \nMongolia, but it has limited experience in disability, which is an issue that cuts across ADB sectors \n(health and education)  and  areas  such  as  infrastructure development, social  protection,  social \nservices and care, and employment. The project represents a learning opportunity for ADB in an \narea  of  increasing  international  importance,  especially  in  relation  to  (i)  the  United  Nations \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and (ii) an aging population that results in \nincreased numbers of PWDs (footnote 6). Specific ADB support for PWDs in Mongolia includes \na JFPR grant for Expanding Employment Opportunities for Poor Disabled Persons implemented \nin  2002\u20132006,  and  the  Social  Security  Sector  Development  Program,  which  assisted  in \ndeveloping  manufacturing  capacity  for  prosthetics  and  establishing  community  care  centers.13 \nADB\u2019s work in health and education in Mongolia, although extensive, has not focused on disability. \nIn 2005, ADB published the Disabled People and Development working paper as an attempt to \nintegrate  disability  into  poverty  reduction and  development  strategies  and other  sectors.14 This \nhas not led to operations directed at disability. \n \n10. \nThe  Italian  Raoul  Follereau  Association,  an  international  network  of  grassroots \norganizations  more  commonly  known  as  AIFO,  has  been  focusing  on  the  development  of \ncommunity-based  rehabilitation.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  is  providing  funding  for  the \nconstruction  of  the  National  Children\u2019s  Rehabilitation  Center  in  the  Bayangol  district  of \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2001.

The outcome will \nbe that access to services and employment for PWDs increased. The geographic focus of the \nproject  will  be  on  Ulaanbaatar  and  six  aimags.  The  project  will  create  new  services  in  aimag \ncenters and provide outreach services to CWDs and PWDs in soums (aimag subdistricts) and \nkhoroos (Ulaanbaatar subdistricts). Some project activities focusing on strategic issues will have \nnational reach. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe  project  will  support  the  Government  of  Mongolia  in  addressing  a major  social  and \nrights issue by ensuring inclusiveness and delivery of services for PWDs in Ulaanbaatar and in \nthe  aimags.  The  overall  aim  of  the  project  is  to  ensure  access  to  employment  for  PWDs  to \nincrease their autonomy and contribution to the economy and society in general. The project will \nsupport the government in complying with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of PWDs \nand the Incheon Strategy to \u201cMake the Right Real\u201d for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the \nPacific, and implementing the new Law on the Rights of PWDs (footnote 6). \n \n13. \nthroughout the life of CWDs and PWDs.17 \n\nThe  project  will  have  five  outputs  that  address  the  need  for  services  and  support \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nOutput 1: Early identification of children with disabilities strengthened and \ninstitutionalized. The project will (a) institutionalize the early identification model \ninitiated by the MLSP, and (b) facilitate the shift from a medical to a social model in \nidentifying  CWDs  by  broadening  the  skills  of  the  people  involved  in  early \nidentification. The effects of disability can be minimized and possibly prevented by \nappropriately  supported  early  intervention,  and  such  intervention  can  lead  to \ngreater ability and inclusion in education, employment, and society in general. \nOutput 2: Service delivery for persons with disabilities improved. The project \nwill (a) implement a model of interactive parent\u2013child\u2013facilitator education in early \nchildhood; (b) establish six model aimag development and rehabilitation centers;18 \n(c) establish a disability workforce and introduce national curricula for occupational \nand  speech  therapy,  physiotherapy,  orthopedic  technicians,  and  disability  social \nworkers;  (d)  strengthen  the  role  of  social  workers  in  support  of  PWDs;  and                \n(e) establish PWD-dedicated hotline on information, counselling, and referrals (for \nPWDs). Early detection supported by appropriate interventions and service delivery \n\n                                                \n15  As a result of the national parliamentary elections held on 29 June 2016 and  the subsequent restructuring of the \ngovernment, the Ministry of Population Development and Social Protection and the Ministry of Labor were merged \ninto one ministry, the MLSP. \n\n16  The Economic Governance for Equitable Growth Project for Mongolia, a 3-year project of the European Commission \nthat began in August 2015, focuses on macroeconomic planning and comprises social protection and employment. \n\n17  Except education, as this is being addressed by JICA through its START TA. \n18  Each development and rehabilitation center is staffed with a multidisciplinary team that delivers center-based and \n\nmobile habilitation and rehabilitation, early intervention, and independent living services for PWDs and CWDs. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nare the starting point for ensuring access to society, education, and employment for \nCWDs.  Early  detection  and  delivery  of  better  and  more  appropriate  services  for \nCWDs may also allow family members, especially women, to take an active role in \nthe  economy. 19 Improved  services  will  include  individual  case  management  by \ndisability social workers, portage, physiotherapy, speech and occupational therapy, \nassistive devices, personal assistants, and other independent living services.20 \nOutput  3:  Access  to  the  physical  environment  improved.  This  output  will         \n(a) develop the capacity of decision makers and strengthen institutions involved in \ndeveloping  and  enforcing  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  on  physical \naccessibility  norms  (infrastructure,  transportation,  and  information);  (b)  ensure \nwide  inclusion  of  PWDs  in  enforcement  mechanisms;  and  (c)  ensure  access  to \naffordable quality orthopedic devices and assistive technology, including in aimags. \nThe  activities  that  will  be  implemented  to  achieve  this  output  will  facilitate \nimplementation  of  regulations  that  improve  mobility  and  access  to  information, \npublic  buildings,  and  transportation.  Increased  access  to  assistive  devices  and \nservices  will  reduce  participation  barriers  affecting  PWDs  and  enable  them  to \nengage actively in employment. \nOutput 4: Work and employment for persons with disabilities improved. This \noutput will (a) set up models to increase PWDs\u2019 skills to enter selected industries \nand improve general job matching and brokerage, (b) facilitate inclusive business \nand  organize  support  systems  for  PWDs  to  access  regular  jobs  and  self-\nemployment, and (c) strengthen participation from PWDs by monitoring employers\u2019 \ncompliance  with  the  PWD  employment  regulation.  The  activities  will  focus  on          \n(a)  making  public  employment  and  DPO  service  policies  and  practices  more \neffective  in  creating individual pathways to employment  (e.g.,  case management \nand job coaching); (b) supporting the development of a DPO employment resource \ncenter  in  Ulaanbaatar  (infrastructure,  equipment,  training,  and  capacity  building) \nthat can provide services to PWDs, employers, and public employment offices; and \n(c)  supporting  employers  and  PWDs  in  the  enforcement  of  legislation  regarding \nemployment quotas for PWDs.21 \nOutput  5:  Strategic  development  to  support  persons  with  disabilities \nimplemented.  The  project  will  (a)  raise  awareness  and  change  attitudes  toward \nPWDs, (b) reform the welfare system to improve targeting and financial support for \nPWDs  to  access  services  and  equipment,  (c)  conduct  a  strategic  review  of  the \nnational PWD support program, (d) introduce the ICF in line with needs and available \nresources, (e) align National Statistical Office data with information needs in relation \nto disability, and (f) ensure the provision of health insurance coverage to all PWDs. \nIndirect interventions leading to improved inclusion will be achieved through public \ncampaigns  to  support  a  gradual  change  of  attitudes  toward  PWDs,  a  better \nunderstanding  of  disability  through  the  introduction  of  the  ICF,  and  improved \nstatistics and information on challenges faced by PWDs. \n \n\n                                                \n19 The household socioeconomic survey conducted for the project preparatory TA noted that four out of five caregivers \nare  women.

The estimated project economic benefits include additional PWDs \nemployed  and  higher  incremental  earnings  for  PWDs.  Other  economic  benefits  were  not \nconsidered because of practical constraints on quantifying them. Estimating benefits over a 20-\nyear period, based on a total project financial cost of $27.27 million, yielded an economic internal \nrate of return of 22.01%, well over the assumed 12.00% economic opportunity cost of capital. The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  22.01%  is  robust  in  terms  of  sensitivity  to  various  adverse \nconditions. \n \n20.  \nFinancial sustainability. The project does not generate incremental cash flows, therefore \nthe financial sustainability assessment focused on the fiscal capacity of government to finance \nthe counterpart funding and incremental recurrent costs after completion. The analysis concludes \nthat the government\u2019s budget execution has shown lack of predictability in funds availability and \nin-year reduction in budgets, which could create uncertainty in providing adequate funding for the \nproject\u2019s  recurrent  costs.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  PIU  financial  management  specialist  and \nfinance officers in the aimags will monitor the budget process to ensure funds for operation and \nmaintenance  costs  are  included  in  budget  appropriations.  The  legal  agreements  include \ncovenants requiring the government to provide adequate funding for operation and maintenance \ncosts and other recurrent costs of the project. \n \nC. \n \n21.   Procurement assessment of the MLSP showed that it has adequate capacity to conduct \nprocurement  in  compliance  with  national  laws  and  regulations  on  public  procurement,  and \nexperience  in  procurement  using  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  The  MLSP\u2019s  procurement \ncapacity will be strengthened by recruiting a procurement specialist for the PIU. \n \nFinancial management assessments conducted for the MLSP and MOH, confirmed that \n22.  \nthey have adequate qualified accountants, and computerized financial accounting and reporting \nsystems  and  procedures  supporting  their  current  project  activities.  The  overall  assessment  of \nproject  financial  management  risk  was  moderate.  The  assessments  identified  weaknesses  in \nbudget planning and execution, accounting, staffing, internal auditing, asset management, and \nthe management information system. ADB will address these weaknesses by providing training \nfor, and strengthening the capacity of, the MLSP and MOH staff through the PIU. The PIU will be \nfinancial  management  system  and  staffed  by  qualified \nequipped  with  an \n\nGovernance \n\nintegrated \n\n                                                \n23 International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Annual  project  audits  will  be  arranged  by  the \nMongolian  National  Audit  Office  and  MOF  and  will  be  conducted  through  private  audit  firms \nsubcontracted by the Mongolian National Audit Office and MOF. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MLSP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \nD. \n \nPWDs and their families are a population subgroup whose poverty rates are more than \n24. \ntwice those of general population, and only one-quarter of PWDs are in the labor force. In general, \nPWDs have significantly lower human development indicators, and higher level of vulnerabilities \nand  social  exclusion  than  the  general  population.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  PWDs  by \nproviding  them  with  job  opportunities  and  more  support  through  social  welfare  reform.  Some \nproject  components  will  focus  on  regions  where more  than  50%  of  PWDs  live  in  poverty.  It  is \nexpected that at least 10,000 PWDs will benefit from improved employment services, and by 2022 \nat least 5,000 more PWDs will enter the labor market than in 2014. Social welfare reforms will \nbenefit 400,000 people living in households with at least one PWD, providing more equitable and \naccessible  social  assistance  programs. Finally,  it  is  estimated  that  17,000  CWDs  and  62,000 \nPWDs  will  benefit  from  early  identification  and  improved  services  provided  through  the \ndevelopment  and rehabilitation centers  in the  project target  areas.  More than  10  DPOs  will  be \ninvolved in public communications campaigns, employment and work support, and monitoring of \nall project implementation activities as part of the PSC. \n \n25. \nGender benefits. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming and a gender \naction plan has been prepared. Early identification of disabilities, delivery of support services, and \nemployment  services  include  gender-sensitive  approaches  and  ensure  equal  participation. \nCommunication campaigns are planned to address gender inequities and reform of social welfare \nto provide better protection and social services for caregivers. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories  are  as  follows:  B  for  environment  and  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project will not have \nnegative  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  in  the  project  areas,  and  will  not  require temporary  or \npermanent  land  acquisition. 24  The  MLSP  reviewed  the  project\u2019s  environmental  implications, \nconducted an initial environmental examination, and developed an environmental management \nplan (EMP) to address minor adverse environmental impacts (dust, noise, and construction site \nsafety)  that  may  potentially  occur  during  the  establishment  of  six  small  development  and \nrehabilitation centers in aimags and one DPO employment resource center  in Ulaanbaatar. All \nbuildings will meet relevant health and safety standards, adhere to universal design principles, \nand incorporate energy efficiency measures.25 Water, wastewater, and solid-waste services will \nbe connected to existing municipal services. The EMP defines the environmental management \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n24 Construction  of  six  aimag  development  and  rehabilitation  centers  and  the  DPO  employment  resource  center  in \n\nUlaanbaatar will be done on identified government-owned land. \n25 All buildings will be equipped with rooftop photovoltaic systems. \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nrequirements and responsibilities throughout the design and establishment of the facilities. The \nEMP  is  attached  to  the  PAM  and  will  be  incorporated  in the  civil  work  contracts.  The  PIU  will \nmonitor and supervise EMP implementation performance. \n \nF. \n \n27. \nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.26 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nLack of recurrent funding jeopardizes \nthe provision of quality services for \nPWDs in the long-term \n\nCompanies show resistance in \nemploying PWDs \n\nMedical profession resists changes in \ndisability classifications. \n\nThe MLSP has guaranteed funding for recurrent costs. The Law on the \nRights of PWDs and strong DPO advocacy will support adequate funding. \nLegal covenants to ensure funding commitment were added in the loan \nagreement. \nThe MLSP will (i) strengthen public and DPO employment services to \nbetter prepare and support PWDs in work placements, and to prepare staff \nand the physical environment in the workplace; (ii) conduct information \ncampaigns and guidance targeting employers; and (iii) strengthen \nenforcement of the quota regulation. \nResponsibilities will be shared.
