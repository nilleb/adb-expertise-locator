The program will improve economic inclusion, ecosystems, and crucial services in the five IMAR border crossing point\n(BCP) communities and surrounding areas on both sides of the 3,200 kilometer (km) PRC-Mongolia, which lags in economic\nand social development. The program will enhance infrastructure at key BCPs, related services including health services, and\nliving conditions by improving environment and waste management systems. Expanded financial and business support to small\nand medium-sized enterprises in border regions will spur local income growth. Establishment of an agricultural value chain will\nenhance livelihoods on both sides of the frontier. The program will have strong regional spillover benefits to Mongolia:\nimprovement in infrastructure and services at IMAR-Mongolia BCPs will boost the volume and quality of trade, creating about\n3,300 direct and indirect jobs in Mongolia; and improvement in health and other services will benefit disadvantaged communities\non both sides of the border.\nImpact: Sustainable economic development and shared prosperity for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC)\nregion achieved.\nOutcome: Sustainable economic opportunities and living conditions in areas along the IMAR-Mongolia border improved.\nOutputs: (i) Sustainable infrastructure for cross-border connectivity and health services improved, (ii) Ecological environment in\nkey border towns improved, (iii) Income  generating opportunities expanded,  and (iv) Cross-border cooperation mechanisms,\ntechnical project management, and institutional capacity strengthened\n\nImplementation Arrangements: Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will be the executing agency.\n\nProject Readiness: Project readiness is high. The executing agency and implementing agencies have conducted detailed \nfeasibility studies and prepared all required reports for the subprojects under the first tranche. \n\n9.

The  program  will  improve  economic  inclusion, \necosystems, and basic social services in the five IMAR border crossing point (BCP) communities \nand surrounding areas on both sides of the 3,200-kilometer (km) PRC\u2013Mongolia frontier, which \nlags in economic and social development. Expanded financial and business support to small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in border regions will spur local income growth. Establishment \nof an agricultural value chain will enhance livelihoods on both sides of the frontier. The program \nwill have strong regional spillover benefits to Mongolia: improvement in infrastructure and services \nat IMAR\u2013Mongolia BCPs will boost the volume and quality of trade, creating about 3,300 direct \nand  indirect  jobs  in  Mongolia;  and  improvement  in  health  and  other  services  will  benefit \ndisadvantaged communities on both sides of the border.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE \n\nDevelopment Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe BCP communities are located along one of the world\u2019s longest international borders. \nThey are far from urban centers and industrial hubs and located in an often hostile environment \nof  steppe  and desert.1 Although  they  serve  as  the  main  cross-border  logistics  conduits  for  the \nrapidly expanding trade between the PRC and Mongolia, socioeconomic development has largely \npassed them by. Their fragile economies are narrow, and basic infrastructure and basic services \nare  lacking.  More  jobs  and  rural  development  are  needed  to  reduce  inequality  and  income \npoverty.  Better  medical  services  are  urgently  required,  as  are  effective  responses  to \ndesertification and many other ecological problems in the frontier region.  \n \nInterlinked  obstacles  to  borderland  development.  The  key  obstacles  to  greater \n4. \nsocioeconomic  development  in  the  borderlands  include  the  poor  infrastructure  and  inefficient \nprocesses at the IMAR BCPs. This stifles the potential for development on both sides of the border \nand has curtailed progress under a 2011 strategic partnership between the PRC and Mongolia \non greater cross-border tourism, exchanges in health and education services, and cooperation in \ntransboundary  environmental  protection  and food security.2 It  is  also a  barrier  to  achieving the \ntwo countries\u2019 shared goal of developing border port towns and areas into important venues for \nlocal trade, cultural exchange, and the movement of people.3 Resolving issues at the IMAR BCPs \nis  also  vitally  important  to  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  region \noverall, since they are crucial logistics facilities\u2014and current bottlenecks\u2014on CAREC corridor 4.4 \n \n\nMandula. The exception is Arxan. \n\n \n\n1  Four  of  the  five  BCP  communities  covered  by  the  program  fit  this  description\u2014Uliji,  Ganqi-Maodu,  Erenhot,  and \n\n2  Joint communique issued by the PRC and Mongolia on 17 June 2011. \n3  Government of IMAR. Outline for Developing Medium- and Long-Term Strategic Partnership Relationship between \n\nPRC and Mongolia. Signed in 2014. Unpublished. \n\n4  The six CAREC corridors link the region\u2019s key economic hubs and connect the landlocked CAREC countries to other \nEurasian and global markets. Corridor 4 connects the Russian Federation with East Asia, including the IMAR and \nMongolia.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fInadequate border crossing point infrastructure and systems. Physical infrastructure \n5. \nand cross-border land connectivity are inadequate at the IMAR BCPs. Storage and quarantine \nfacilities  are  lacking.  The  outdated  and  inefficient  management  systems,  customs  procedures, \nand standards compound the adverse impacts of the infrastructure issues. A one-stop customs \nprocess has not been established, and goods clearance is not yet automated or integrated with \nsanitary and phytosanitary measures. Mongolia is particularly affected. Making lengthy IMAR BCP \nclearance times  2  hours  shorter  would  save Mongolia an  estimated  $65  per  export shipment.5 \nBetter animal disease prevention and control at the BCPs would reduce transboundary disease \ntransmission.6 Greater efficiency at the IMAR BCPs could further accelerate the growth of trade \nbetween the countries.  It  expanded from  $4  billion  in 2010 to $8  billion  in 2018,  and  about  $5 \nbillion of this total was between Mongolia and the IMAR alone. Trade by the PRC and Mongolia \nwith third party countries, including those in Europe, would also grow. Better BCP processing on \nthe PRC side of the frontier would improve landlocked Mongolia\u2019s access to the PRC\u2019s markets \nand to the Republic of Korea, Japan and beyond through the PRC\u2019s Tianjin seaport. \n \n6. \nPoor health and other basic services in the border areas. Public health across broad \nareas of both countries is negatively impacted by a shortage of medical facilities and health care \nin the IMAR BCP city of Erenhot. Erenhot\u2019s comprehensive secondary-level international hospital, \nwhich serves residents of a transborder region reaching 250 km into Mongolia, is overtaxed and \nunderequipped.7 Diagnostic capacity is limited, and the hospital is unable to treat many serious \nailments  or  properly  respond  to  cross-border  health  risks  from  infectious  diseases  such  as \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection. Delays in care often force patients to spend on high-\ncost travel to obtain treatment in Beijing or Ulaanbaatar more than 600 km away. Long waits for \nproper  emergency  care  often  result  in  permanent  disability  or  death.  Deficiencies  in sanitation \nand other basic services tend to exacerbate the overall elevated health risks and subpar state of \nhealth of the people living in the border areas. \n \n7. \nUnfavorable environment and unsustainable living conditions. The combination of a \nharsh  environment  and  poor  basic  services  make  most  borderland  areas  inhospitable.  Heavy \nsnowstorms  are  frequent  during  the  bitterly  cold  winters.  Extremely  hot,  dry,  and  often  windy \nsummers exacerbate the damage caused by desertification. Sandstorms regularly wreak havoc \non agriculture, animal husbandry, grasslands, infrastructure, and BCP operations. About 50,000 \ncubic meters of sand, or more than 2,000 truckloads, must be cleared from the roads each year \nin Erenhot alone. The poor climate interferes with outdoor activity, drives residents indoors, adds \nto an already heavy household cleaning and washing burden for women, and leads to heightened \nincidence and severity of respiratory and eye disease. An absence of proper sanitation services, \nparticularly in Erenhot, makes the situation worse, as pollution from uncollected waste blends with \nsand particles in the air. Residents of Erenhot appear ready to pay much more for better sanitation \nservices, but the city lacks waste transfer equipment.8 Groundwater in borderlands is scarce and \nmust be used sparingly. More clean energy use is needed to avoid worsening of air pollution. \n \n8. \nLimited  income-generating  opportunities.  BCP  areas  are  too  remote  to  attract  the \noutside  investment  needed  to  create  sustainable  local  employment  and  income  opportunities. \n\nAnnual Report. Manila. \n\n \n\n5   ADB.  2018.  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  Corridor  Performance  Measurement  and  Monitoring\u2014\n\n6 IMAR has 10 ports open to Mongolia. Based on the urgency of the investment required and subprojects readiness, \n\nthe program will involve five of those: Arxan, Erenhot, Ganqi-Maodu, Mandula, and Uliji. \n\n7 The  PRC\u2013Mongolia  International  Hospital  is  the  only  modern  comprehensive  secondary-level  hospital  in  Erenhot \nmunicipality. Only 131 of its 188 beds can be used due to a lack of medical equipment and limited capacity of staff. \nIn addition to pediatrics, obstetrics, and special diagnostic services, it provides emergency response with first aid. \nThe hospital treated 108,339 patients in 2018, including 2,150 from Mongolia. \n\n8 Household survey in July 2019 conducted by ADB during investment program preparation. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nRationale for the Program \n\nSMEs play an important role in cross-border trade and job creation but have little access to bank \ncredit, reliable market information, or business development advice. Businesses led by women \nare  particularly  underserved.  Important  opportunities  to  bridge  the  inequalities  between  urban \ncenters and rural regions in the IMAR remain unrealized. These issues leave agricultural incomes \nlow and poverty levels high. Low productivity, poor product quality, and restricted market access \nare particularly hard on the 501,000 predominantly small-scale livestock farming households that \nproduce 42.7% of IMAR\u2019s agricultural output and employ about 993,000 people. The same issues \nafflict sheep herding in the adjacent Mongolian borderlands. Farmers on both sides of the frontier \nneed to be integrated into a well-developed sheep value chain in the agribusiness sector. \n \n9. \nWeak development institutions and capacities in border areas. Coordination between \nIMAR  and  Mongolia  is  crucial  to  developing  sustainable  BCPs  and  border  areas,  but  the \nmechanisms  for  doing  so  are  weak.  The  governments  of  IMAR  and  Mongolia  are  key  to \ncollaboration between the two sides, but have little knowledge of or experience with international \nbest  practices  for  joint  BCP  area  development,  including  approaches  for  dealing  with \ntransboundary health risks and drug, human, and wildlife trafficking. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nPandemic impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions to \nthe  global  economy  and  slowed  down  the  economies  of  both  the  PRC  and  Mongolia,  while \nreducing  trade  and  the  movement  of  people  between  the  two  countries.  The  PRC\u2019s  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  growth  is  expected  to  fall  from  6.1%  in  2019  to  1.8%  in  2020,  while \nMongolia\u2019s  GDP  growth is  expected to  fall from  5.1%  in 2019 to  \u20131.9%  in 2020.9 Although the \ninvestment  program  was  prepared  before  the  pandemic,  the  government  recognizes  that  the \nprogram remains highly relevant and will be a key driver for post-pandemic economic recovery \nand revitalization, as it will increase job opportunities, expand trade, improve the livability of border \ntowns, and support SMEs. In addition, the program will strengthen the system of screening and \nresponding  to  human  and  animal  transboundary  health  risks.  Adopting  new  technologies  to \nmonitor  and  trace  agricultural  products  and  enhancing  the  exchange  of  customs,  immigration, \nand  inspections  data  between  the  PRC  and  Mongolia  will  enable  the  two  countries  to  better \nmanage these risks and ensure safer cross-border movement of goods and people. \n \n11. \nRegional cooperation road map. The investment program will help to deliver sustainable \nand inclusive socioeconomic progress in communities and rural areas on both sides of the PRC\u2013\nMongolia  border.  The  program  design  reflects  the  common  objectives  and  road  maps  for \ncooperation of the PRC, the IMAR, and Mongolia. Greater cooperation with Mongolia is a priority \nunder the 2016\u20132020 5-year economic and social development plan of the Government of IMAR \n(IMARG).10 The Government of Mongolia has agreed with the IMARG and the Russian Federation \non a long-term cooperation strategy and an $18 billion investment plan up to 2035.11 The IMARG \nand Mongolia have also agreed on a medium- and long-term framework for cooperation during \n2015\u20132025.12 The framework sets directions for eliminating physical and nonphysical restraints \non progress toward inclusive and sustainable cross-border development and growth. \n \n\n \n\n9   ADB. 2020.

The  investment  program  will  support  the  2015\u20132025  IMARG\u2013\n12. \nMongolia framework\u2019s priorities. These include (i) enhancing connectivity through better transport \nand  energy  infrastructure;  (ii)  strengthening  the  key  BCPs  and  the  economic  and  social \ndevelopment of border areas; (iii) accelerating the development of economic corridors; (iv) piloting \neconomic cooperation zones (ECZs); and (v) tackling such cross-border risks as those related to \npublic  health  and  environmental  fragility.  The  program  is  aligned  with  the  framework  goals, \nparticularly those of making BCPs and border areas effective bases for cooperation; improving \nservices;  and  strengthening  the  two  countries\u2019  ability  to  jointly  address  cross-border  disease \ncontrol, improve environment protection, and deal with other transboundary challenges. \n \n13. \nPolicy framework. The IMARG has established a lead group under its current 5-year plan \n(footnote 10) to plan, coordinate, and strengthen collaboration with Mongolia and other CAREC \ncountries.  Policies  have  been  set  and  reforms  designed  to  make  IMAR\u2013Mongolia  border \ncrossings  more  efficient,  enhance  the  business  environment  at  BCP  ports,  and  improve  the \nlivability of the border towns.13 Among the policy aims are a reduction in the number of permits \nand the documentation needed to process exports and imports and the institution of online border \ncrossing applications and approvals. Customs is to be integrated with sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures,  and  joint  customs  inspection  with  Mongolia  will  be  upgraded  through  electronic \ntransmission  of  export  and  import  goods  lists.  One-stop  customs  processes  are  to  be  used  to \nensure that businesses receive timely inspection results, and public\u2013private partnerships are to \nbe  piloted  by 2026  in an  effort  to  improve  border  services. In addition,  the policies  call  for the \nIMARG  to  enhance  its  poverty  reduction  program  by  partnering  with  agricultural  leading \nenterprises and to strengthen border region hospitals to provide better medical services. Plans to \ncreate a shared cross-border ECZ centered on the region\u2019s busiest BCP, which links Erenhot in \nIMAR with the Zamyn-Uud ECZ in Mongolia, are to be accelerated.14 \n \n14. \nStrategic  context.  The  investment  program  aligns  with  Strategy  2030  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), which identifies regional cooperation and integration as one of ADB\u2019s \nseven operational priority areas.15 It is designed to support the Strategy 2030 operational priorities \nto  (i)  address  remaining  poverty  and  reduce  inequalities  (through  the  delivery  of  output  3);  (ii) \naccelerate progress in gender equality (all outputs); (iii) tackle climate change, build climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhance environmental sustainability (output 2); and (iv) promote rural \ndevelopment  and  food  security  (output  3).  The  investment  program  is  also  well  aligned  with \nStrategy  2030\u2019s  approach  to  support  upper  middle-income  countries  by  promoting  innovation, \ninternational best practices, and knowledge sharing for PRC and IMAR. The program aligns with \nthe priorities under ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC for 2016\u20132020 of managing \nclimate  change  and  the  environment,  promoting  regional  cooperation  and  integration,  and \nsupporting inclusive economic growth.16 \n \n15. \nPast assistance and lessons.

The IMAR \ninvestment program will be implemented in close coordination with two complementary ongoing \nADB operations in Mongolia\u2014the Developing the Economic Cooperation Zone Project, which is \nproviding targeted support to the Mongolia side of the Erenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud BCP;19 and the 2016 \nRegional Improvement of Border Services Project, which is improving Mongolia\u2019s border services \nat two other BCPs on its frontier with the IMAR.20 Similar past operations also show that a cross-\nsectoral program approach involving mutually supportive technical, environmental, financial, and \neconomic  elements  along  with  stakeholder  ownership  and  coordination  will  be  critical  to \nsuccessfully lifting living standards and living conditions for people in the BCP areas on both sides \nof the frontier in a sustainable long-term way. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\n \n16. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  program  will  go  beyond  the  removal  of  critical \nlogistical obstacles to greater trade between the PRC, Mongolia, and the other CAREC countries. \nIn  addition  to  upgrading  and  modernizing  the  facilities  and  systems  at  five  IMAR  BCPs,  it  is \ndesigned holistically to ensure that the BCP communities and the two countries\u2019 border regions \nlong bypassed by the socioeconomic spin-offs of growing bilateral and regional trade also share \nin the benefits. The program will enhance the livability and sustainability of target border regions \nby supporting the use of such advanced technologies as smart drip irrigation with reclaimed water \nfor forestation, smart port management based on information and communication technology, and \nsmart waste collection and transfer. International best practices in gender equity will be applied \nthrough targeted support for women-led SMEs, the gender-sensitive design of BCP facilities, and \npoverty  alleviation program (PAP)  support for  low-income households headed by women.  The \nprogram will promote regional public goods through cross-border spillover effects (para. 17) and \nmeasures to address the climate change and adaptation challenges that confront both the IMAR \nand  Mongolia.  These  will  include  support  for  carbon  pollution  reduction  by  building  protective \nforest strips and the use of renewable and clean energy for heating supply. The program\u2019s sound \ntechnical design, improvements to the environment and ecosystems, and robust economic and \nfinancial returns will ensure its long-term sustainability and benefits.  \n \n17. \nBenefits  for  Mongolia.  The  investment  program  aims  to  provide  strong  benefits  for \nMongolia. Half of the jobs created are expected to go to residents of the Mongolia border regions, \nespecially in agriculture, port management, food processing, and retail and wholesale trade. More \nefficient animal inspection, value-chain development, and high-tech tracing and branding in sheep \nbreeding  should  increase  demand  and  prices  in  the  PRC  for  Mongolia\u2019s  sheep  and  raise  the \nexports for the country\u2019s herders from the current level of 300,000 head a year. The upgrading of \nefficiency of the IMAR BCP at Erenhot will spur Mongolian exports and is projected to generate \n2,000 additional jobs in Mongolia by 2030. Direct spill-over benefit measured in gross terms is \nestimated at about $855 million. Mongolia will benefit alongside the PRC from the coordinated \nsteps to be taken under the program to control the cross-border spread of communicable human \n\n \n\nRepublic of China for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Environmental Improvement Project (Phase II).

The  program\u2019s  coordination  with  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \noperations  to  develop  the  ECZ  on  the  Mongolia  side  of  the  Erenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud  BCP  and \nupgrade  services  of  two  Mongolian  BCPs  on  its  border  with  the  IMAR  will  maximize  bilateral \nsharing in the program benefits (para. 15 and footnote 19).  \n \nA. \n \nThe  investment  program  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainable  economic \n18. \ndevelopment and shared prosperity for CAREC region achieved.21 The investment program will \nhave  the following  outcome:  sustainable  economic  opportunities  and living  conditions  in areas \nalong the IMAR\u2013Mongolia border improved.22  \n \nB. \n \n19. \nOutput  1:  Sustainable  infrastructure  for  cross-border  connectivity  and  health \nservices  improved.  The  investment  program  will  support  sustainable  infrastructure  and \ninstitutional changes at five key BCPs stretched over 2,000 km along the border between IMAR \nand  Mongolia.  This  output  comprises:  (i)  establishing  a  smart  port  management  systems, \nincluding one-stop inspection and intelligent vehicle queuing; (ii) installing a wind-powered, clean \nenergy  heating  supply  for  the  Erenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud  ECZ;  (iii)  building  connecting  and  access \nroads at ECZs and BCPs; (iv) improving a transit system to smoothen and speed up BCP logistics \nand  reduce  transboundary  health risks  including  storage  and  transshipment  facilities,  customs \nclearance  systems,  and  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  clearance  facilities;  and  (v)  enhancing \ncapacity and quality of services at the PRC\u2013Mongolia International Hospital in Erenhot through \nthe provision of advanced medical equipment and training on regional health security issues. In \ndesigning the infrastructure, the Group of 20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment will \nbe  followed,  including  the  principles  of  sustainability,  resilience,  inclusiveness,  and  innovative \ntechnologies.23 \n \n20. \nOutput  2:  Ecological  environment  in  key  border  towns  improved.  This  output \nincludes: (i) creating protective forest strips to safeguard BCP communities from sandstorms and \nimproving  environmental  conditions  using  smart  forestation  technologies  such  as  advanced \nreclaimed-water  irrigation  and  intelligent  fertilization,  and  (ii)  piloting  a  smart  municipal  waste \ncollection  system  and  introducing  recycling  systems  to  reduce  negative  impacts  from  human \nactivities on the environment. \n \n21. \nOutput  3:  Income-generating  opportunities  expanded.  This  output  comprises:  (i) \nproviding local currency loans to SMEs engaged in cross-border businesses through a financial \nintermediation  loan  (FIL);  (ii)  strengthening  IMAR\u2019s  business  development  service  system  for \nSMEs with particular support through piloting a program for female entrepreneurs and SMEs led \nby women; (iii) developing an inclusive sheep value chain to create economic opportunities for \nfarmers in border areas by building (a) animal quarantine facilities, (b) sheep processing logistics \npark, (c) stud sheep breeding and farming bases at the Mandula port, and (d) a livestock tracing \nand management system; and (iv) establishing the PAP to ensure that poor households, including \nthose headed by women, are integrated into the value chain. \n \n\n21 ADB. 2017.

This  output  includes:  (i)  annual  international \nworkshops  to  support  existing  bilateral  coordination  mechanisms  at  the  Erenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud \nBCP and to facilitate cross-border policy dialogue between the PRC and Mongolia; (ii) training for \nagricultural  enterprises,  farming  households,  and  rural  cooperatives  to  improve  their  use  of \nlivestock farming technology, animal disease prevention, and livestock waste management; and \n(iii) training for executing agency, implementing agencies, project implementing entities (PIEs), \nand counterpart Mongolian officials in safeguards, procurement, financial management, gender \nequality, and awareness of sexual exploitation and harassment.  \n \n23. \nUse of the Multitranche Financing Modality. The investment program\u2019s outputs are best \nfinanced by an MFF to sustainably achieve the outcome.24 The program aims to address multiple \ncomplex and interacting development constraints in a vast, underdeveloped, and environmentally \nchallenged region straddling the border of two countries. This requires a phased, integrated, and \nsustained response. The three MFF tranches are sequenced according to subprojects  readiness, \ntheir urgency, geographical locations, results of ongoing coordination between the two countries, \nand  expected  progress  in  similar  ADB  operations  in  Mongolia  (para.  15).  The  road  maps  and \npolicy frameworks of the PRC and IMAR will guide these long-term investments. \n \n24.  Modality advantages. The MFF ensures ADB\u2019s predictable long-term financing for these \napproaches  and  will  help  ADB  achieve  the  program\u2019s  intended  outcome  (para.  18).  The \ninvestment program will cement ADB\u2019s role as an honest broker between IMAR and Mongolia in \nexpanding  partnerships  for  sustainable  development  and  creating  institutional  mechanisms  to \nsupport the development of BCPs and border areas  up to 2031 and beyond. The program will \nsupport sustained, ongoing capacity strengthening of executing and implementing agencies and \nthe IMARG overall, rather than building capacity piecemeal through stand-alone projects. Lessons \nfrom  tranche  1  will  be  applied  to  tranches  2  and  3.  The  MFF  allows  for  phasing  of  important \ncomponents. For example, forestation can be gradually expanded with each tranche to avail of \ngrowing wastewater treatment capacity, thereby minimizing the use of precious groundwater.  \n \n25. \nEligibility  of  financial  intermediary.  ADB  and  the  IMARG  have  selected  the  Bank  of \nInner  Mongolia  as  financial  intermediary  for  onlending  ADB\u2019s  FIL  proceeds  to  qualified  SMEs \nunder tranche 1. Other financial institutions selected by the Borrower and acceptable to ADB may \nparticipate  in  the  FIL  onlending.  To  be  eligible,  these  banks  must  have  sufficient  financial \ncreditworthiness, the institutional capacity to manage SME financing schemes, sufficient reach in \nthe targeted SME markets, and the ability to meet ADB\u2019s reporting and safeguard standards.25 \nSelected banks will provide matching counterpart funds under tranche 1.26 \n \n26. \nScope of tranche 1. Tranche 1 will help finance the delivery of all four program outputs. \nA  smart  port  management  system  in  the  Erenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud  ECZ,  and  a  service  area  and \ncustoms supervision center at the Mandula port (IMAR) will be built, and the equipment at the \ninternational hospital in Erenhot will be upgraded (output 1). Ecological restoration will be carried \nout  in  the  ECZ,  and  a  smart  waste  collection  system  established  in  Erenhot  (output  2).  SME \n\n \n\n24 Comparison of Financing Modality (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Detailed eligibility criteria are in Appendix 3 of the Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). The Bank of Mongolia was cleared by ADB\u2019s financial and integrity due diligence. The \nfinancial intermediation role for the program can be extended to other banks and financial institutions by applying the \nsame criteria and requirements during the program and tranche design and implementation. Financial due diligence \nand performance review will be conducted on selected financial intermediaries for renewals at the end of loan terms. \n26 The  eligibility  criteria  for  SME  subborrowers  have  been  developed  and  are  in  the  Facility  Administration  Manual \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\ffinancing  support,  the  construction  of  a  quarantine  station  at  the  Mandula  port,  and  the \nestablishment of a product tracing and management system and PAP will contribute to expanding \nincome-generating  opportunities  (output  3).  Output  4  activities  under tranche  1  will  include  the \ncapacity improvements and facilitation of policy dialogue between IMAR and Mongolia Feasibility \nstudies for all subprojects have been undertaken, and the domestic approval process completed. \nTranche 1 is representative of the types of investments to be supported under the whole MFF.  \n \n27. \nSubsequent  tranches.  Some  program  interventions  will  be  completed  in  full  under \ntranche 1, including the upgrading of the international hospital in Erenhot, implementation of the \nPAP, and creation of the inclusive sheep-breeding value chain. Other activities will continue under \ntranches 2 and 3 to ensure full delivery of the outputs through the program\u2019s phased approach. \nTranche  1  lessons  will  be  applied  to  tranches  2  and  3;  and  output  1  activities  to  upgrade  the \nErenhot  and  Mandula  BCPs  will  be  extended  to  the  ports  at  Uliji,  Ganqi-Maodu,  and  Arxan. \nEcological  improvements  (output  2)  will  begin  under  tranche  1  and  expanded  in  tranche  2. \nTranche 3 will include a second phase of environment improvement including smart forestation in \nErenhot. The financial intermediation loans for SMEs will continue under tranche 2, and SMEs \nwill receive business development support under tranche 3.27 Prefeasibility studies of indicative \ntranche 2 and 3 subprojects are complete, and the subprojects\u2019 readiness level is high.  \n \nC. \n \n28. \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 1).  \n \n\nThe investment program is estimated to cost \u20ac753.62 million, including taxes and duties, \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates of the Investment Program \n(\u20ac million) \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

The government has requested an MFF denominated in euros of up to \n29. \n\u20ac356,295,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the investment program. The \nMFF  will  consist  of  three  tranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of  related  periodic \nfinancing requests, execution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and \nfulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing \nagreement.  The  first  tranche  of  \u20ac166,525,000  of  the  MFF  will  comprise  two  loans:  (i)  an \ninvestment loan of \u20ac149,559,000 with a 25-year term, including a grace period of 6 years; and (ii) \na financial intermediation modality loan of \u20ac16,966,000 (equivalent to $20 million) with an 18-year \nterm and provision for the bullet repayment method.

The PAP will provide poor households in \nBaotou Municipality with breeding and extension services and advice on animal health, welfare, \nand nutrition. The participating poor households will increase their incomes by raising ewes and \nselling lambs to the selected agricultural leading enterprise, Inner Mongolia Xiao Wei Yang Stock \nRaising  Sciences  and  Technologies  Co.,  Ltd.,  Xiaoweiyang. 29  A  buy-back  guarantee  by \nXiaoweiyang for lambs will give small farmers greater income security in raising high-quality lambs \nand help build a more inclusive and resilient sheep value chain. Xiaoweiyang will implement the \nPAP  according  to  the  detailed  implementation  arrangements  in  the  onlending  agreement  and \nproject  implementation  agreement  to  be  signed  between  the  IMARG  and  Xiaoweiyang.  The \nagreements will specify the onlending terms and conditions, the scope and activity details, the \neligibility requirements for selecting cooperatives and poor households for support, and the fund \nflow  and  disbursement  requirements.  Such  agreements  will  be  on  terms  and  conditions \nacceptable to ADB and will provide for a clear and robust monitoring system to ensure that the \nPAP is implemented effectively. Details are in Appendix 1 of the FAM (footnote 28). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nTranche  1  will  apply  innovative  and  sustainable  technologies  such  as  smart  port \n33. \nmanagement, under which the BCPs combine one-stop inspection and intelligent vehicle queuing \nsystems;  and  high-tech  drip  irrigation  using  reclaimed  water  with  sensors  for  remote  water \napplication  management  to  create  protective  forest  strips.  Heating  storage  and  supply  for  the \n\n \n\n29 The agricultural leading enterprise (ALE), Xiaoweiyang, was eligible and selected to be the project implementation \nentity for the poverty alleviation program because it (i) was willing to provide counterpart financing of more than 50%, \n(ii) has export\u2013import business at the Mandula port, and (iii) was willing to participate in the PAP. Although it was the \nonly one of the four national ALEs in Baotou Municipality to express interest, Xiaoweiyang has been recognized as \na national ALE since 2008 and as a leading poverty alleviation enterprise since 2010. It has conducted business in \nsheep-breeding, livestock farming, food processing, restaurant chains, cold chain logistics, and feed sales. The ALEs \nshare responsibility for poverty alleviation by providing income-generation opportunity to farmers and establishing a \nbenefit-sharing mechanism to support poor villages and poor households. \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nErenhot\u2013Zamyn-Uud ECZ will use electricity generated by the abundant borderlands wind power. \nOther  technical  solutions  will  include  breeding  genetically  superior  sheep  and  enhancing \nproductivity through sheep embryo transplants, and the establishment of a livestock tracing and \nmanagement system. Subproject civil works designs  will adopt best practices and comply with \nPRC standards and design codes for architecture, water supply and sewage, firefighting, electric \npower supply, and lighting and communication systems. \n \nB. \n \n34. \nEconomic and financial viability. The cost\u2013benefit analysis and financial sustainability \nassessment  of  fiscal  impacts  on  the  government's  counterpart  funding  and  debt  servicing \nconducted  for  the  tranche  1  project  and  the  investment  program  overall  followed  ADB \nguidelines.30 The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nwere calculated to determine the program\u2019s financial and economic viability. The economic cost\u2013\nbenefit  analysis covered  three  of the  outputs  under tranche  1.  At  14.3%,  the  overall tranche  1 \nEIRR exceeded the economic opportunity cost of capital set at 9.0%\u2014based on EIRRs of 13.3% \nfor output 1, 19.0% for output 2,31 and 21.7% for output 3. The economic net present value under \ntranche 1 was CNY2,170 million. An overall FIRR of 5.47% was determined for the four revenue-\ngenerating outputs which met the ADB requirement that is higher than the weighted average cost \nof capital (1.27)32 and the financial net present value was CNY825 million. \n \n35. \nFinancial  sustainability.  For  tranche  1,  ADB  undertook  sustainability  analysis  to \ndetermine the capacity of the PAP, its implementing entity (Xiaoweiyang), and the non-revenue-\ngenerating  subprojects  to  meet  incremental  program  fund  requirements  over  time  (including \noperation  and  maintenance  costs  and  debt  repayments).  Xiaoweiyang  was  found  to  have \nsufficient projected cash flows to finance the required counterpart funding. Financial sustainability \nrequires Xiaoweiyang to keep its current ratio above 2.0 and its debt\u2013equity ratio at not more than \n45:55. It should also achieve a debt service coverage ratio of 1.3 by 2025 (a covenant to that \neffect  has  been  included  in  the  legal  agreement).  Fiscal  projections  showed  that  the  Erenhot \nMunicipal Government and the Damaoqi County Government can meet the funding requirements \nof the nonrevenue subprojects with negligible impacts on their annual budgets. \n \nC. \n \n36. \nFinancial  management.  A  standard  financial  management  assessment  carried  out  by \nADB  for  tranche  1  confirmed  that  the  executing  agency,  the  IMARG,  has  sufficient  financial \nmanagement  capacity  and  experience  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  No  major  financial \nmanagement issues have been identified at the municipal governments and financial intermediary \nthat  will  act  as  the  program\u2019s  implementing  agencies.  Two  PIEs\u2014the  privately  owned \nXiaoweiyang  and  the  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  Yixin\u2014have  sound  financial  management \nsystems,  but  the  capacity  of  the  third  PIE  (Songbuer  SOE)  is  relatively  weak.  The  financial \nmanagement risk is substantial, and the executing and implementing agencies and the PIEs have \nagreed to implement an action plan to mitigate it by addressing the key deficiencies. Yixin and \nSongbuer  will  strengthen  their  governance,  financial  management,  and  audit  and  disclosure \nsystems by participating in the program and meeting ADB requirements. This will also serve to \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n30 ADB. 2018. Handbook for the Classification and Economic Analysis of Regional Projects.

Integrity \ndue diligence on the financial intermediaries and Xiaoweiyang identified no significant risks. \n \n37. \nProcurement. A strategic procurement planning exercise (summarized in Appendix 13 of \nthe FAM) has been undertaken to ensure value for money through choosing optimal procurement \narrangements for subproject activities. The overall pre-mitigation procurement risk for tranche 1 \nactivities  is  considered  moderate.  With  assistance  from  ADB  and  the  project  implementation \nconsultants, the IMAR project management office and PIEs will have adequate capacity to comply \nwith  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Procurement under the \nFIL  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and Integrity Principles and Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time) were explained to and discussed with the governments of the PRC \nand IMAR. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in FAM. \n \nD. \n \n38. \nADB\u2019s  poverty  and  social  analysis  indicate  that  the  program\u2019s  tranche  1  activities  will \nbenefit  2.95  million  people  in  Erenhot  and  Baotou  municipalities  through  greater  livelihood \nopportunities  for  the  poor  and  the  population  overall.  Socioeconomic  benefits  will  arise  from \nimproved  border  facilities  and  connectivity,  growth  in  cross-border  economic  activities,  and \ndevelopment of the inclusive sheep-farming value chain. Health care services will be enhanced, \nas  will  environmental  and  living  conditions  the  Erenhot  BCP  area.  Financial  intermediation \nonlending to SMEs engaged in cross-border trade and logistics, agribusiness, manufacturing, and \ntourism will create jobs and raise incomes. The benefits will spill over to the adjacent border areas \nof Mongolia, where the impact will be especially strong on a smaller population base with generally \nlower income levels. \n \nGender. Tranche 1 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A minimum target \n39. \nhas been set for providing financial intermediation subloans to SMEs owned or led by women. \nADB and the IMARG have prepared a social development and gender action plan that will give \nwomen access to 600 newly generated jobs. The plan aims to enhance the capacity of women \nemployees  at  the  Erenhot  and  Mandula  BCPs,  the  international  hospital,  and  government \nagencies. It requires that cross-border and customs facilities have gender-sensitive designs and \npromotes the participation of low-income households headed by women in the PAP. \n \nE. \n \n40. \nactivities have been assigned safeguard categories.33 \n \n41. \nreport  and \nenvironmental management plan have been prepared for tranche 1 activities, which confirm that \nthe  project  will  not  result  in  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  that  are  irreversible, \ndiverse, or unprecedented. Implementation of the environmental management plan will prevent \nor mitigate any minimal adverse environmental impacts. ADB conducted information disclosure \nand meaningful public consultations on the project activities during the subproject design and will \ncontinue to do so throughout implementation. The IMARG will establish a program-level grievance \nredress  mechanism  to  handle  environmental  complaints.

The \nBank of Inner Mongolia will adopt an environmental and social management system (ESMS) prior \nto  loan  effectiveness  that  will  cover  environmental  and  social  policies;  safeguard  screening, \ncategorization, and review; institutional arrangements; and monitoring and reporting procedures. \nThe FIL will not fund any subprojects that are on the prohibited investment activities list of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  or  will  trigger  category  A  safeguards  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, or indigenous people. Although its ability to implement the ESMS is weak, the Bank \nof Inner Mongolia has established ESMS units and assigned staff to be trained to implement the \nESMS independently and properly assess the environmental and social impacts of proposed FIL \nsubprojects. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B).

The impact is deemed not significant. All works for the Erenhot \nsubproject  will  be  on  state-owned  land,  and  due  diligence  showed  no  outstanding  or  legacy \nissues.  A  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  investment  program,  as  well  as  a \nresettlement framework for the program\u2019s subsequent tranches. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C).
