A  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nprepared  and  circulated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) on 14 August 2006. \n \nThe  Government  has  identified  the  1,000-megawatt  (MW)  Mong \nDuong 1 Thermal Power Project (the Project) as a priority power \ngeneration project for meeting the country\u2019s rapidly growing power \ndemand.  A  least-cost  power  generation  option,  the  Project  is \nincluded in the 6th Power Development Master Plan (2006\u20132015) \nwith  an  outlook  until  2025.  The  Project  involves  building  a  1,000 \nMW  coal-fired \nthat  uses \ncirculating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler technology\u2014a \u201ccleaner coal\u201d \ntechnology. The Project is scheduled to be commissioned in 2012. \nCommon  facilities  for  the  next  phase  of  the  power  plant  also  are \nincluded within the project scope. These facilities will support the \nexpansion  of  Mong  Duong  thermal  power  complex  through  the \nconstruction  of  the  1,000\u20131,200  MW  Mong  Duong  2  thermal \npower  project,  which  is  being  formulated.  The  private  sector  will \nbuild  the  Mong  Duong  2,  which  is  aimed  for  commissioning  by \n2013, under a build-operate-transfer arrangement. The Project will \nalso  provide  appropriate  institutional  and  technical  capacity \nbuilding, particularly in CFB boiler technology and operation.   \n \nViet Nam\u2019s economy has been growing at about 7.5% a year over \nthe  past  decade,  with  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  in \n2006  reaching  8.2%.  The  Government  is  determined  to  maintain \nthe  high  economic  growth  of  8%\u20138.5%  in  the  country\u2019s  5-year \nsocioeconomic  development  plan  (for  2006\u20132010)  to  reduce \npoverty to 11%\u201315% by 2010. To sustain this economic growth, a \nreliable supply of electricity is essential, as electricity is central to \nalmost  every  aspect  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  sustainable  socioeconomic \ndevelopment:  job  creation,  industrial  activities,  commerce  and \nbusinesses,  and  other  drivers  of  economic  growth  and  people\u2019s \nwell-being.  Following  Viet  Nam\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  in  2007,  foreign  direct  investment  and \ndomestic  investment  have  increased  substantially,  with  new \nbusinesses being established at an ever-increasing rate.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  updated  Sixth  Power  Development  Master \nPlan  (2006\u20132015)  envisages  power  demand  to  grow  at  16%  per \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nincreasing \n\nforeign  direct \n\ninvestment,  and \n\nyear  until  2011,  and  at  11%  per  year  thereafter  until  2015.  This \nmight prove to be conservative, since power demand growth over \nthe  first  quarter  of  2007  has  been  about  20%  The  drivers  of  this \ndemand\u2014rapid industrialization, establishment of industrial zones, \nincreasing \ntrade \nlittle  sign  of  diminishing. \nfollowing  WTO  accession\u2014show \nReflecting this rapidly increasing demand, which is fast outpacing \nthe country\u2019s generation capacity, Viet Nam is experiencing power \noutages,  and  these  will  increase  unless  new  generation  capacity \nis added quickly.  \n \nThe  high  growth  rate  in  electricity  demand,  coupled  with  the \ncountry\u2019s  disproportionate  dependency  on  hydropower,  has  left \nViet  Nam  with  dangerously  low  reserves  during  annual  dry \nseasons,  when  limited  river  flows  reduce  hydropower  output  to \nabout  40%\u201350%  of  rated  output.  Without  significant  increases  in \nthermal  plant  generation  capacity,  the  continuing  demand  for \nelectricity would reduce system reserve capacity to zero by 2010. \nViet  Nam  Electricity  (EVN),  therefore,  plans  to  develop  thermal \npower plants urgently based on coal, including Mong Duong 1, to \naddress system imbalances and seasonal generation shortages.  \n \nThe Government has made a policy decision to use domestic and \nimported  coal  to  ensure  security  of  electricity  supply.  Under  the \nupdated  6th  Power  Development  Master  Plan,  coal  power  plants \nare  to  provide  for  essential  base-load  power  generation.  Coal\u2019s \nshare  in  the  country\u2019s  generation  mix  will  more  than  double  from \n16% (in 2006) to 34% in 2020, while the share of hydropower will \nfall  gradually  from  37%  in  2006  to  27%  in  2020.  Nevertheless, \nhydropower  will  remain  the  second  largest  component  in  the \ngeneration  capacity  mix.  The  proposed  Project  is  in  Quang  Ninh \nProvince  of  northern  Viet  Nam,  where  coal  is  abundant\u2014\naccounting for 90% of the country\u2019s coal reserves. Viet Nam is a \nsignatory to the Kyoto Protocol, though it is not required to reduce \ncarbon emissions under the agreement, which lasts until 2012.  \n \nThe  2005  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate \nChange  shows  that  Viet  Nam  emits  0.3  tons  of  carbon  dioxide \n(CO2) per capita, compared with 6.3 tons per capita by Japan, 8.8 \ntons  per  capita  by  the United  Kingdom,  and  20.6  tons  per  capita \nby  the  United  States  of  America.  As  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy \ndevelops,  its  consumption  of  energy  will  increase  to  sustain  the \neconomic growth and reduce poverty to 15%. In this context, Viet \nNam is aware that the country\u2019s CO2 emissions will increase, and \nis  using  clean  coal  technologies  in  power  generation  to  reduce \nCO2 emissions. \n \nIn  recognizing  its  fiscal  constraints  to  meet  all  investment \nthe  Government \ndemands \nrequested  assistance  from  ADB  in  developing  a  new  thermal \npower  generation  project  in  2007,  in  the  northern  part  of  the \ncountry to meet the country\u2019s growing demand for electricity. The \n\ninfrastructure  development, \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  2005  Country  Strategy  and  Program \nUpdate  for  Viet  Nam  included  a  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (TA)  in  2007  to  prepare  a  second  power  generation \nproject and an investment loan in 2008 to finance a portion of the \npower generation project. To bring the investment loan forward a \nTA1 was provided in 2005. An ADB appraisal mission visited Viet \nNam in August 2006 and this report is based on the agreements \nreached during the mission. \n \nThe Project will foster sustainable national economic growth, and \ngenerate employment. Expanding power generation capacity and \nproviding  reliable  power  supplies  will  support  the  Government\u2019s \nefforts to accelerate poverty reduction. Improving the reliability of \nthe  power  supply  during  the  dry  season  will  ensure  a  stable \nsupply  of  electricity  to  meet  the  growing  demand  of  industrial, \ncommercial,  residential,  and  rural  consumers,  preventing  further \nload  shedding. 2  The  Project  will  also  address  the  current \nimbalance  between  hydropower  and  thermal  generation  capacity \nin the power system by increasing base-load thermal generation. \nFurther, the Project will support private sector development in the \npower  sector.  By  financing  the  required  common  facilities  for \nMong Duong 2, the Project permits EVN to award that project on a \nstand-alone basis for private sector participatory development. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,099.60  million,  of  which  ADB \nwill provide $930.71 million, excluding taxes and duties of $39.76 \nmillion    \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment \n \n \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n930.71 \n168.89 \n \n1,099.60 \n\n% \n84.6 \n15.4 \n\n100.0 \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

This  represents \n84.6%  of \nthe \nGovernment has requested the ADB financing in two loans under \nthe  MFF.  The  first  requested  loan  under  the  MFF  is  for  $27.86 \nmillion,  while  the  second  is  expected  to  be  for  the  balance  of \n$902.85  million.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Pilot  Financing \nInstruments  and  Modalities,  the  Government  will  submit  signed \nperiodic  financing  requests  (PFR)  to  ADB,  which  will  trigger  the \nsubsequent  loan.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  enter  into  a \nframework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB. This agreement \nis  in  a  form  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  Appendix  4  of \nADB\u2019s Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Pursuant to the \nFFA, the Government will submit to ADB a PFR for $27.86 million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR).  The  form  of  this \nPFR  for  the  first  loan  is  presented  to  the  Board  along  with  the \nFFA. Before accepting the subsequent PFR, ADB will ensure that \nthe  Government  and  EVN  fully  comply  with  the  terms  and \nconditions of the FFA. ADB missions will conduct due diligence on \nthese to ensure that they are being adhered to satisfactorily.  \n \nThe  Government  selected  two  loans  under  the  MFF  as  its \npreferred mode of financing for the Project, rather than adopting a \ntraditional project loan, largely due to (i) the loan being almost $1 \nbillion,  when  only  about  $27.86  million  is  needed  in  the  first  2 \nyears; (ii) the need for sufficient time to design, bid, negotiate, and \naward  the  main  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction \n(EPC)  contract  to  a  suitable  contractor  (to  be  selected  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  following  ADB  guidelines);  and \n(iii)  apprehension  that  bids  for  the  EPC  contract  could  escalate \nunless the bidding community sees that financing is firmly in place \nbeforehand. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n \n\nin  updating \n\n \nThe initial loan of $27.86 million will be used for (i) procurement of \ncivil  works  to  prepare  the  site  for  the  Mong  Duong  1  thermal \npower  plant,  which  includes  leveling  of  the  project  site,  river \ndiversion  works,  and  supply  of  equipment  for  constructing  a \ntransmission  line  for  power  supply;  (ii)  consulting  services  for \nreviewing  and  updating  the  technical  designs  and  drawings, \npreparing  bid  documents  for  selection  of  the  EPC  contractor, \nassisting  EVN  in  contract  negotiations,  and  supervising  the  civil \nworks  contracts  under  item  (i);  and  (iii)  consulting  services  for \nupdating  the  environmental  management  plan,  updating  the \nresettlement  plan,  and  supervising  their  implementation.  The  site \nleveling works and river diversion works will take about 20 months \nto  complete.  During  this  period,  EVN  will  undertake  bidding  and \nselection  of  an  EPC  contractor,  and  then  proceed  to  contract \nnegotiations  and  contract  award.  Also  during  this  period,  the \nthe  environmental \nconsultants  will  assist  EVN \nmanagement plan and resettlement plan, and will supervise their \nimplementation.  Given  the  uncertainty  of  timing  in  such  large \ncontract  negotiations,  the  Government  prudently  has  opted  to \ndefer  the  second,  larger  loan  to  avoid  payment  of  commitment \nfees  over  a  long  period.  Hence,  the  timing  of  the  second  loan  is \ntargeted for when the EPC contractor has been selected and the \nEPC contract is substantially ready for award. \n \nEach loan will have a repayment period of 25 years. The first loan \nwill have a grace period of 6 years, while the second will have a 4-\nyear  grace  period.  The  interest  rate  will  be  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility.  The  Government  can  choose  from  eligible \ncurrencies  and  the  interest  rate  regime  most  suitable  for  each \nloan.  ADB  also  provides  flexibility  in  terms  of  repayment  and \ninterest rate swaps during the financing period. The Borrower will \nbe the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \n \nThe Government of Viet Nam will make both loans under the MFF \navailable  to  EVN  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  subsidiary  loan \nagreements and project agreements.   \n \nA  6-year  implementation  period  (2007\u20132013)  is  planned  for  the \nMFF.  Each  loan  will  have  its  own  closing  date  to  match  its \nimplementation period. \n \n30 June 2013 \n\n \nEVN \n \nThe  Thermal  Power  Project  Management  Unit  1  will  implement \nthe Project. \n \nEquipment  and  materials  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\nits \n\n(v)  update \n\nimplementation, \n\nthe  bidding  documents \n\nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines. \nInternational competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for (i) the EPC \ncontract  of  the  power  plant  and  common  facilities,  (ii)  supply \ncontracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million or more, \nand  (iii)  civil  works  contracts  valued  at  more  than  $3.0  million. \nNational competitive bidding (NCB) or limited international bidding \nwill be used for supply contracts less than $1.0 million. Civil works \ncontracts  estimated  at  less  than  $3.0  million  will  be  procured \nfollowing  NCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Miscellaneous \ngoods  and  civil  works  contracts  less  than  $100,000  will  be \nprocured  using  shopping  procedures.  Contract  packages  will  be \nprepared  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under  ICB.  Similar \ncontractual  arrangements  and  specifications  will  be  applied  to \nother subprojects.  \n \nThe Government has requested advance action for recruitment of \nfor \nconsultants,  who  will  prepare \nrecruitment  of  the  EPC  contractor  and  civil  works  contracts,  to \nallow  site  preparation  works  to  begin  promptly.  In  August  2006, \nADB  Management  approved  advance  action  for  consultants. \nConsulting services will be required to (i) review technical designs, \n(ii) prepare bid documents for the EPC contract, (iii) supervise site \npreparation  civil  works,  (iv)  update  the  resettlement  plan  and \nmonitor \nthe  environmental \nmanagement  plan  and  monitor  its  implementation,  (vi)  conduct  a \nsocioeconomic  impact  assessment  of  the  health  situation,  (vii) \nmonitor  project  performance,  and  (viii)  supervise \nthe  EPC \ncontractor.  EVN  will  select  and  engage  the  consultants  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nConsulting  firms,  chosen  in  international  competition  using  the \nquality-and cost-based selection method, will provide the services. \nIndividual  experts  may  be  recruited  based  on  curriculum  vitae \nsubmitted  in  response  to  specific  terms  of  reference  for  the \nassignment.  Two  recruitments  of  consulting  services  will  be \nundertaken  for  the  Project.  The  first  recruitment  will  be  to  assist \nEVN with (i) reviewing the bid documents for selection of the EPC \ncontract,  and  subsequent  negotiations  and  award  of  the  EPC \ncontract; (ii) reviewing civil works bid documents, followed by the \nbidding,  awarding  of  contract,  and  supervision  of  civil  works;  (iii) \nupdating  the  environmental  management  plan  and  resettlement \nplan;  and  (iv)  supervising  the  environmental  management  plan \nand resettlement plan. EVN completed short-listing of consultants \nfor  the  first  recruitment  in  June  2007  and  submitted  the  draft \nrequest  for  proposal  to  ADB  in  July  2007  for  approval.  The \nrequest  for proposals  will  be  issued  in  August 2007.  The  second \nconsultant \nthe  overall \nrecruitment  will  assist  EVN  with \nmanagement of the Project, supervision of the EPC contract and \ncivil  works  contracts,  and  continued  monitoring  of  EMP \nimplementation.  Consulting  inputs  will  total  820  person-months, \ncomprising 556 person-months of international consulting services \nand 264 person-months of national consulting services.  \n \n\n\f \n\nDisbursements \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\nvii\n\n \n\nIndirectly,  consumers  will  benefit \n\nThe proceeds of individual loans under the MFF will be disbursed \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \nADB\u2019s  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, both as amended from time to time. \n \nThe  construction  of  the  1,000  MW  Mong  Duong  1  power  plant, \ntogether with site preparation and the common facilities for Mong \nDuong 2, will provide reliable electricity supply throughout the year \nin northern Viet Nam. The main beneficiaries of the Project will be \nthe  industrial,  commercial,  residential,  and  rural  consumers  in \nnorthern  Viet  Nam. \nfrom \nimproved  system  frequency  and  the  elimination  of  voltage \nfluctuations,  resulting  in  better  performance  and  longer  life  of \nelectrical equipment. EVN will not have to resort to load shedding, \nwhich will support the development of the northeast region, where \nnumerous industrial estates are established. The stable supply of \nelectricity  to  northern  Viet  Nam  will  stimulate  economic  growth, \nand  increase  employment  and  income-earning  opportunities  for \nthe  poor.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the \nProject is estimated at 22.5%. The financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR)  is  estimated  at  7.5%,  which  is  higher  that  the  2.97%  real \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The  Project  will  also  generate \ndirect employment in the project area through construction of the \nMong  Duong  power  complex,  incremental  coal  mining,  and \nlimestone mining activities. \n \nThe  Project  is  not  expected  to  be  subject  to  any  significant \ntechnical  risks.  EVN  has  proven  experience,  and  has  performed \nwell  in  implementing  internationally  financed  power  projects. \nCapacity  building  of  EVN  technical  staff  under  the  Project  will \nimprove  operational  knowledge  and  skills  regarding  CFB  boiler \ntechnology. The financial and economic robustness of the Project \nhas  been  evaluated,  taking  into  consideration  possible  variations \nof  key  parameters.  The  main  factors  that  might  pose  risks to  the \nfinancial and economic viability of the Project are (i) lower demand \nfor  electricity,  resulting  in  less  production  and  sales  from  the \nProject;  (ii)  higher-than-expected  construction  costs;  (iii)  possible \ndelays  in  tariff  increases;  and  (iv)  delays  in  project  construction, \ncompared with the planned schedule. \n \nTo  evaluate  these  risks,  financial  and  economic  analyses  were \nconducted  using  various  scenarios,  including  reduced  production \nor  sale  of  electricity  by  up  to  20%,  higher  project  costs  by  up  to \n10%,  and  delayed  project \nimplementation  by  1  year.  For \ncombinations  of  theses  scenarios,  the  EIRR  and  FIRR  still  meet \nacceptable  criteria.  In  addition,  sector  analysis  shows  that  the \ndemand \nfall  significantly.  The \nGovernment has committed to gradually increasing tariffs to cover \nthe \nlong-run  marginal  production  costs. \nGovernment  approved  an  increase  of  8.8%  in  the  average  tariff, \nwhich took effect on 1 January 2007. \n \n\nIn  October  2006, \n\nfor  electricity \n\nis  unlikely \n\nto \n\n\ftechnical  assistance  will  also  help  build \n\nThe social risks include resettlement, possible spread of HIV/AIDS \nduring  construction,  possible  human  trafficking,  and  deteriorating \nhealth  conditions  after  plant  operation.  Appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures  are  in  place  in  the  resettlement  plan  for  increasing \nawareness  and  implementing  preventive  measures  for  the  local \ncommunities.  Technical  assistance  is  being  formulated  that  will \nassist  EVN  in  preparing  an  environmental  action  plan  to  improve \npollution control and environmental management of thermal power \nplants.  The \nthe \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  project  province\u2019s  Department  of \nNatural Resources and Environment on air quality management to \nminimize  air  pollution  impacts  from  thermal  power  projects  in  the \nprovince.  It  will  also  assist  in  establishing  baseline  data  for  air \nquality monitoring in the project\u2019 vicinity. \n \nA  possible  risk  is  that  the  Project  could  be  completed  under \nfinancing provided by parties that do not require ADB\u2019s safeguard \npolicies  to  be  applied  to  the  EPC  contract  for  the  Project. \nHowever, ADB\u2019s strong and successful relationship with EVN, and \nits  satisfactory  and  responsible  performance  in  earlier  projects, \nmitigates this risk considerably. \n \nAdditional  analysis  was  carried  out  to  examine  the  possible \nimpacts of a large investment such as this on the country's overall \ndebt  sustainability  and  macroeconomic  situation.  The  analysis \nshows that the Mong Duong 1 investment does not alter the debt \nsustainability of the country in the medium to long term, because \nthe  disbursement  of  the  loan  is  well  within  the annual  OCR  limit. \nThe Project will not have significant effects on the prices of goods \nand  services  supplied  to  the  Project.  Further,  it  will  not  affect \ndomestic  inflation,  because  more  than  70%  of  the  ADB  loan  will \nbe allocated to the EPC contractor, which will import most  of the \nrequired  equipment.  Finally,  Mong  Duong  1  is  a  revenue-\ngenerating project that will comfortably generate sufficient income \nto repay its associated loans.  \n \n\nviii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20  00\u2019No\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nMap 1\n\no\n103  00\u2019E\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC  OF  CHINA\n\nHa Giang\n7\n\n9\n\nCao Bang\n\nVIET NAM\n\nMONG DUONG 1 THERMAL\nPOWER PROJECT\n\n1\n\nLai Chau\n\nLao Cai\n4\n\n10\n6\nBac Kan\n\n8\nYen Bai\n\nTuyen Quang\n11\n\n16\n\nThai Nguyen\n\nLang Son\n\nSon La\n\nPhu Tho\n5\n\n12\n\nVinh Phuc\n\n13\n\n18\n\nBac Giang\n\n17\n\n2\n\nDien Bien\n3\n\nPROVINCES\n\n1.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Performance  \n\n \n2. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has  grown  on  average  about  7.5%  a  year \nover the past decade. This strong economic growth has enabled the country to reduce poverty \nfrom  58%  of  the  population  in  1993  to  20%  in  2006,  while  increasing  per  capita  income  from \n$288  to  $644  in  the  same  period.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socio-economic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010, \nwhich  was  endorsed  at  the  10th  Party  Congress  in  April  2006,  envisages  reducing  poverty  to \n10%\u201311%,  increasing  per  capita  income  to  about  $1,100,  and  doubling  GDP  by  2010.  This \nimplies annual GDP growth of 7.5%\u20138% during that period. In this context, the Socio-economic \nDevelopment  Plan  emphasizes  the  role  of  physical  infrastructure 1  in  increasing  national \ncompetitiveness  and  market  access,  and  attracting  investments  needed  to  sustain  strong \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  plan  also  stresses  the  importance  of  good \ngovernance,  private  sector  participation,  and  integration  with  the  global  economy  through \nmembership  in  the  World  Trade  Organization.  The  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country \nstrategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  2007\u20132010 2  supports  the  main  objectives  of  the  Socio-\neconomic  Development  Plan.  These  include  achieving  a  balance  between  businesses-led \neconomic  growth,  social  equity,  and  environment  sustainability,  while  strengthening  the \ngovernance of public sector institutions and supporting private sector investments in productive \nsectors  of  the  economy.  The  CSP  highlights  the  importance  of  removing  infrastructure \nbottlenecks  in  the  power  and  transport  sectors  to  increase  the  competitiveness  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nprivate sector-led manufacturing and service sectors.  \n \n \n\nPower Sector Performance \n\n2. \n\nVietnam  Electricity  (formerly  Electricity  of  Viet  Nam  [EVN])  was  formed  as  a  vertically \n3. \nintegrated state-owned corporation responsible for Viet Nam\u2019s power sector. EVN is organized \ninto  multiple  strategic  business  units  with  generation  and  power \ntransmission  units. \nTransmission  facilities  above  110  kilovolt  (kV)  are  established  as  non-revenue  dependent \naccounting  units  (cost  centers),  while  power  distribution  utilities  are  independent  accounting \nunits (profit centers). EVN\u2019s plant generation capacity mix is in Table 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Viet Nam Power Sector Capacity Mix, 2006 (MW) \n \n\nType of Plant \nHydroelectric \nCoal \nNatural Gas  \nFurnace Oil \nDiesel \n   Total \n\nEVN \n\n4,069 \n1,245 \n3,037 \n   200 \n   245 \n8,796 \n\nOther SOE \n150 \n210 \n \n 64 \n \n424 \n\nIPP \n\n \n \n1,466 \n   700 \n \n2,166 \n\nTotal \n\n4,219 \n1,455 \n4,503 \n   964 \n   245 \n11,386 \n\nEVN  =  Viet  Nam  Electricity,  IPP  =  independent  power  producer,  MW  =  megawatt,  SOE  =  state-\nowned enterprise. \nSource: Institute of Energy.  \n                                                 \n1   World Bank. 2005.

Coal-fired  thermal  power  plants  are \nprimarily in the coal-rich Quang Ninh Province, while the natural gas power plants are close to \nthe  natural  gas  fields  in  southern  Viet  Nam.  The  transmission  network  consists  of  more  than \n3,000 kilometers (km) of 500 kV double-circuit \u201cbackbone\u201d transmission line from north to south, \nand  220  kV  and  110  kV  transmission  network  connecting  the  load  centers  to  the  main \ntransmission network. Ongoing high-voltage transmission augmentation is aimed at completing \nthe 500 kV transmission ring networks around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. In the distribution \nsector,  EVN3 subsidiaries  purchase  bulk  power  from  EVN  at  administratively  fixed  bulk  power \ntariffs  at  110  kV,  and  are  responsible  for  distribution  and  sales  to  end  users.  EVN  sets  bulk \ntariffs to enable each power distribution company to achieve a reasonable profit irrespective of \nits cost structure. The Ministry of Industry (MOI) is responsible for overall policy and oversight of \nthe  power  sector,  including  the  regulation  of  the  sector  through  the  recently  established \nElectricity Regulatory Authority of Viet Nam. \n \n5. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  electrification  ratio  is  92%,  compared  with  50%  in  1995.  Despite  the  rapid \ngrowth  in  electricity  demand  in  recent  years,  per  capita  electricity  consumption  in  Viet  Nam \nremains low at 549 kilowatt-hours (kWh) relative to other regional developing countries. This is \nlargely  because  Viet  Nam  is  growing  rapidly  from  a  very  low  development  base.  Per  capita \nconsumption is projected to reach the level of Thailand in 2015 and Malaysia4 in 2023, as Viet \nNam\u2019s  economy  develops,  thus  requiring  more  electricity  to  meet  the  demand  growth  of  the \nindustrial,  commercial,  and  residential  sectors.  Projected  electricity  demand  is  summarized  in \nTable 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Electricity Demand Projection (2005\u20132025) \n\nItem \nAnnual Demand (TWh) \nGrowth in Demand (next 5 years) \nT&D Losses and Self Generation \nAnnual Generation (TWh) \nPeak Demand (MW) \nPer Capita Consumption \n\u2014 = data not available, MW = megawatt, T&D = transmission and distribution, TWh = terawatt-hours. \nSource: Viet Nam Electricity and Institute of Energy. \n\n2020 \n257.3 \n8.1% \n13.2% 12.5% \n294.0 \n190.0\n48,650 \n32,200\n2,629 \n1,774\n\n2010 \n97.1 \n11.1% \n13.8% \n112.7 \n19,550 \n 1,106 \n\n2005 \n45.6 \n16.1% \n14.7% \n53.6 \n9,500 \n549 \n\n2025 \n381.2\n\u2014 \n11.7%\n431.6\n71,400\n3,703\n\n2015 \n164.9\n9.3%\n\n \nThe  6th  Power  Development  Master  Plan  (PDMP),5 prepared  by  the  Institute  of  Energy \n6. \n(IOE), adopted a number of variables, including a key assumption that GDP would continue to \ngrow  for  the  base  case  scenario  at  7.5%  per  year  to  2020.  The  corresponding  electricity \ndemand  is  forecast  to  grow  more  quickly  at  16.0%  per  year  over  2006\u20132010.  This  growth  is \nprojected to slow to 11.0% per annum over the following 5 years, and then settle at 9.0% per \nyear  for  the  remainder  of  the  period  of  the  plan.  The  electricity  demand  growth  during  the  6th \nPDMP is remarkable by international standards, especially to 2015 when double-digit growth is \nforecast to continue. Electricity demand growth from 2006 to 2010 alone will more than double \nthe  current  installed  generating  capacity.6 Additional  plant  capacity  required  to  2020  to  meet \nanticipated base case electricity demand is shown in Table 3. The IOE considered hydropower \nplants, gas power plants, coal power plants, renewable energy plants, and electricity imports in \nits model to determine the least-cost generation expansion plan for the country.  \n \n                                                 \n3   In 2006, the Government transformed EVN into Vietnam Electricity based on a holding company structure. When \nthis transformation is completed in 2009, EVN\u2019s present operating units will become subsidiaries of the new holding \ncompany. It is intended for most of these subsidiaries to be equitized (partially privatized). \n\n4  Per capita electricity consumption is 3,125 kWh in Malaysia, 4,300 kWh in Singapore, and 1,946 kWh in Thailand. \n5  The 6th PDMP was revised to take account of the load growth and was approved on 16 July 2007. \n6   Electricity demand in the first four months of 2007 has grown by 20% compared to last year\u2019s demand growth. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\nTable 3: Power Plant Capacity Mix to 2020 \n\nPlant Type \n\nCapacity (MW) \n\n2006 \n\n2010 \n\n2015 \n\n2020 \n\nAverage Mw \nAdded/Year \n\n15.8% \n43.1% \n35.8% \n4.7% \n0.6% \n\n1,349 \n686 \n861 \n328 \n331 \n3,555 \n\n25.2% \n34.6% \n35.9% \n2.5% \n1.8% \n \n\n38.0% \n19.3% \n24.2% \n9.2% \n9.3% \n \n\n33.7% \n24.3% \n26.7% \n7.7% \n7.6% \n \n\n22.1% \n32.4% \n36.4% \n6.4% \n2.7% \n \n\n2,000 \n5,455 \n4,530 \n600 \n67 \n12,652 \n\n9,290 \n13,624 \n15,278 \n2,695 \n1,130 \n42,017 \n\n20,890 \n15,064 \n16,578 \n4,756 \n4,700 \n61,988 \n\n6,595 \n9,072 \n9,412 \n658 \n472 \n  26,209 \n\nCoal \nOil And Gas \nHydro \nImports \nOthers  \nTotal \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Institute of Energy. \n \n7. \nDue  to  the  swift  growth  in  electricity  demand,  the  country's  power  system  is  already \nexperiencing  dangerously  low  reserves  during  the  dry  season,  when  output  from  hydropower \nplants  declines  to  about  40\u201350%  of  rated  capacity.  Over  2006\u20132010,  the  average  peak  load \nduring  dry  seasons  is  forecast  to  be  about  13,750  megawatts  (MW),  with  a  reserve  margin \n(capacity)  of  only  about  3.6%.  Considerably  larger  margins  of  around  20%  are  desirable, \ndepending on optimal reliability criteria for the system. The gas-fueled power plants in the south \ncan  supply  only  part  of  the  central  and  north  Viet  Nam  power  demand  deficit,7 though  at  a \nhigher  transmission  cost.  As  a  result,  Viet  Nam  is  importing  electricity  (600  MW)  from  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  during  the  dry  season  to  meet  demand  in  the  north.  Given  this \ndemand  and  supply  imbalance,  the  Government  identified8 14  power  generation  projects  for \ncompletion by 2013. The Mong Duong power complex is one of these priority projects. \n \nThe  6th  PDMP  prioritizes  coal  power  plants  for  key  base-load  generation.  As  a  result, \n8. \ncoal\u2019s share in the generation mix will increase from 16% (in 2006) to about 34% in 2020, while \nthe  share  of  hydropower  and  renewables  will  fall  from  36%  in  2006  to  about  27%  in  2020. \nNevertheless, hydropower will remain the second largest component of the generation mix. The \nproposed  Project  is  in  Quang  Ninh  Province,  north  of  Hanoi,  where  coal  is  abundant.  Coal \nproduction,  which  is  currently  about  35  million  metric  tons  (mt)  per  year,  will  increase  to  45 \nmillion  mt  by  2010.  Proven  reserves  within  the  province  are  about  10  billion  mt,  which  is \nestimated to be sufficient for more than 200 years. \n \n9. \nGiven  the  high  international  oil  prices,  the  Government  has  made  a  policy  decision  to \nprioritize  domestic  coal-fueled  power  plants  in  its  generation  expansion  program  to  ensure \nsecurity of electricity supply\u2014a key consideration to sustaining high levels of economic growth. \nThe country\u2019s first nuclear power plant is planned to be operational by 2020, and legislation on \nnuclear  electricity  production  and  related  safety  aspects  is  being  prepared.  The  Government \ntargets overseas training on nuclear technology for some 300 engineers and 500 technicians by \n2015.  In  the  near  term,  additional  coal-fired  power  plants9 will  be  built.  Under  the  5th  PDMP \n(2001-2010 with an outlook till 2020), the proposed Mong Duong 1 and Mong Duong 2 thermal \npower plants were to be commissioned by 2013 and 2016, respectively. But, these plants are \nnow  being  accelerated  to  meet  the  revised  electricity  demand  scenario.  The  need  for  early \ncommissioning of these plants has placed emphasis on preparatory work to begin in 2006. The \n                                                 \n7   During  this  period,  the  north  and  central  regions  will  have  on  average  power  deficits  of  1,127  MW  and  106  MW, \nrespectively, while the south will have a surplus of 532 MW. During the wet season, the north still will have a deficit \nof 550 MW, though this can be compensated by power transfers from the central and the south regions (which will \nhave surplus power of 809 MW and 297 MW, respectively).  \n\n8   Decision No 1195/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister, dated 9 November 2005, addressed specific policies, procedures, \n\nand structure for project financing of selected urgent power generation project in 2006\u20132010. \n\n9   Uong Bi (710 MW), Quang Ninh (1,200 MW), Cam Pha (600 MW), Hai Phong (1,200 MW), Mao Khe (300 MW), \nVung Ang (1,200 MW), Nghi Son (600 MW), and Ninh Binh (300 MW) are under construction with assistance from \nJapan,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  state-owned  enterprises  such  as  Vinacomin  and  Lilama.  Further,  EVN \nplans  to  build  8  new  coal  power  stations  with  a  capacity  of  about  15,000  MW  to  be  commissioned  from  2013  to \n2015 to meet the growing power demand. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nProject includes construction of the associated common facilities for Mong Duong 2, for which \nfinancing  arrangements  are  being  formulated.  It  is  assigned  for  development  by  the  private \nsector,  under  a  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  scheme,  and  will  incorporate  a  public-private \npartnership  arrangement. 10  Accordingly,  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  and  private  sector  operations \ndepartments have been working closely together on developing both phases of the Mong Duong \npower complex.  \n \nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nB. \n\n1. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy  \n\n10. \nADB\u2019s approach has been to provide financial and institutional support for power sector \ndevelopment  to  help  the  Government  achieve  its  development  objectives.  ADB\u2019s  development \nassistance strategy has focused on (i) expanding and strengthening the country\u2019s high-voltage \ntransmission  backbone  network;  (ii)  developing  least-cost  generation  projects  (hydro  and \nthermal)  to  meet  growing  power  demand;  (iii)  promoting  financial  and  fiscal  sustainability  by \nunbundling EVN into generation, transmission, and distribution companies that can operate as \ncommercially  viable  and  financially  independent  entities;  (iv) creating  an  enabling  environment \nfor  private  sector  participation  in  a  competitive  power  market  in  Viet  Nam;  (v) promoting \nrenewable  energy  sources  for  power  generation  in  rural  areas;  and  (vi) promoting  power \ninterconnections in the Greater Mekong Subregion to allow power trading within the region by \nusing the difference in peak load demand, and taking advantage of the spare capacities within \nhigh-voltage power transmission networks. Within ADB, the public sector and private sector staff \nhave cooperated closely to support the development of public-private partnerships in the power \nsector,  such  as  promoting  the  partnership  to  develop  Mong  Duong  1  and  2  projects  jointly.11 \nFurther, ADB has engaged the Government in policy dialogue to improve sector performance. \nAs  a  result,  the  Government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  the  road  map  for  the  sector \n(Supplementary Appendix A), which includes Mong Duong 1 and 2. \n \nADB has approved $663.3 million in sovereign loans (Appendix 3) to develop the sector. \n11. \nThe  earlier  loans  were  for  strengthening  the  high-voltage  transmission  backbone  networks  in \nnorthern Viet Nam; and extending and rehabilitating medium- and low-voltage substations and \ndistribution  networks  in  the  northern,  central,  and  southern  regions  of  the  country.  In  addition, \nADB  has  supported  private  sector  investment  in  power  generation  through  its  Private  Sector \nOperations  Department.  In  the  past  4  years,  ADB  has  participated  in  the  financing  of  two \nsignificant  gas-fired  thermal  power  plants  at  Phu  My.  In  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government, \nADB has prioritized the promotion of efficient use of energy, especially in the industrial sector. \nADB will provide technical assistance (TA) to determine the potential for accessing the carbon \nmarket  through  renewable  energy  and  industrial  energy  efficiency  projects.  Further,  ADB  will \nassess the possibility of accessing debt financing from domestic financing institutions to address \nthese  issues  through  appropriately  designed  lending  or  guarantee  products  and  policy \ninterventions, using ADB\u2019s proposed Energy Efficiency Fund and Carbon Market Fund. \n \n12. \nThe Government and EVN recognize that the needs of the power sector cannot be met \nfrom  domestic  and  public  sector  borrowings.  Consequently,  the  Government  initiated  sector \nreforms  starting  in  2004  following  an  ADB-financed  TA  on  power  sector  reforms.12 Under  the \nGovernment\u2019s  proposed  sector  reforms,  the  responsibility  for  planning  and  procuring  new \n\n                                                 \n10  The  Government  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  a  joint  venture  consortium  in  March  2006  for  the \ndevelopment  of  the  1,000\u20131,200  MW  of  Mong  Duong  2  thermal  power  plant.  The  Government  is  reviewing  the \nconsortium\u2019s technical proposal and draft power purchase agreement.   \n\n11  ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department and the Private Sector Department are also working together in developing the \nO Mon II and IV loan project (1,500 MW) as a public-private partnership project in 2008 and 2009, respectively. \n12 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Road Map for Power Sector Reform. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\ngeneration  capacity  from  public  and  private  sector  investors  would  be  transferred  to  a  \u201csingle \nbuyer.\u201d13 The main challenge here is to provide adequate comfort to potential private investors \nin the context of ongoing sector reforms, without compromising the flexibility required in power \npurchase agreements for effective functioning of the proposed power market. \n \n\n2. \n\nMeeting the Rapid Growth in Power Demand \n\n13. \nThe  main  challenge  facing  the  power  sector  is  maintaining  adequate  investments  to \nmeet  the  exceptionally  rapid  growth  in  electricity  demand.  More  than  49,000  MW  in  additional \npower generation capacity is projected for 2006\u20132020 (Table 3), of which more than 11,000 MW \nare  under  construction  and  will  be  commissioned  by  2012.  Managing  an  expansion  program \nthat is expected to increase the system capacity more than threefold over 10 years (2006\u20132015) \ninevitably will be a major challenge. Under the 6th PDMP, EVN will undertake about half of the \nprojected capacity additions in hydropower, coal, and natural gas. Joint ventures between state-\nowned  enterprises  and  private  sector  investors,  and  by  private  sector  investors  without  state \nparticipation, will make the remaining investments.  \n \nAbout $23 billion in investment is required for the sector in 2006\u20132010. EVN will provide \n14. \n$14 billion (about $9 billion from internal cash generation and $5 billion in net borrowings), while \nother investors will cover the remaining $9 billion. A similar level of investment is expected for \n2011\u20132015. The availability of concessional official development assistance and domestic funds \nthrough  the  Government  is  limited.  Thus,  EVN  increasingly  is  borrowing  on  commercial  terms \nfrom  export  credit  agencies  and  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR).  EVN  plans  to  raise \nfunds  in  international  capital  markets  through  a  series  of  US  dollar  bonds  during  2006\u20132010. \nEVN  is  already  raising  financing  from  the  domestic  market  by  issuing  bonds  denominated  in \nVietnamese Dong.  \n \n\na. \n\nMaintaining Financial Viability of the Power Sector \n\nEVN\u2019s  operations  have  been  profitable,  and  it  has  financed  the  rapid  expansion  of  the \n15. \nViet Nam\u2019s electricity sector without significant fiscal subsidies. The main financial performance \nindicators,  such  as  debt  service  cover  ratio,  self  financing  ratio,  debt-equity  ratio,  and \nreceivables, have been maintained. The average end user tariff has been maintained at $0.052 \nper kWh from 2003 to 2006. Due to EVN\u2019s increasing debt financing and financial obligations for \npower purchases from independent power producers (IPP) on a take-or-pay terms,14 sustained \ntariff  increases  are  required  to  maintain  adequate  levels  of  debt  service  and  self-financing  of \nnew investments. In this context, MOI submitted to the Government a tariff increase to ensure \nEVN\u2019s  financial  performance  indicators  are  maintained.  The  Government  approved  a  tariff \nincrease  of  8.8%  in  October  2006  and  this  took  effect  as  of  1  January  2007.  EVN\u2019s  financial \nperformance  and  projection  is  in  Appendix  2,  while  the  projected  financial  statements  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nb. \n\nGovernment Power Sector Policy \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  policy  for  the  power  sector,  as  set  out  in  the  Electricity  Law15 that \n16. \ncame  into  effect  in  July  2005,  is,  inter  alia,  \u201cto  develop  a  power  market  on  the  principles  of \ntransparency and competition to achieve economic efficiency, to attract investments from both \nstate and non\u2013state sectors to the sector and to ensure the legitimate rights of the consumers \nand  the  investors  in  the  sector.\u201d  Further,  the  law  states  that  the  Government  monopoly  in  the \nsector  would  be  limited  to  power  transmission,  national  load  dispatch,  and  strategically \n                                                 \n13 An  entity  responsible  for  buying  power  from  all  the  generators  and  selling  to  distribution  companies  and  large \n\nconsumers will be established after 2009. \n\n14  An industry term meaning that EVN will to pay for the electricity generated even if it does not require it. \n15 The Electricity Law was approved on 16 November 2004 and promulgated on 1 July 2005. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nimportant large power plants, leaving the power distribution and non-strategic power generation \nto  potential  private  sector  investors.  The  law  specifically  encourages  investments  from  foreign \nprivate sector investors and joint ventures between foreign investors and domestic enterprises. \nTo achieve these objectives, MOI is responsible for establishing a competitive power market in \nthe medium term (2009\u20132012), and for procuring new generation capacity on flexible terms to \nfacilitate  the  transition  to  a  competitive  power  market.  Since  the  enactment  of  the  Electricity \nLaw, the Government has demonstrated a strong commitment to creating a transparent power \nmarket and broadening the ownership of the sector by taking several key initial steps, such as \n(i) establishing the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Viet Nam (October 2005), (ii) approving the \nRoad  Map  for  Establishing  Power  Market,  and  (iii)  taking  legal  measures  to  establish  a  new \nentity  called  the  Viet  Nam  Electricity  to  become  a  holding  company  for  the  former  EVN \nsubsidiaries  (para.  19).  The  Government  is  also  setting  up  a  social  fund  to  subsidize  non-\neconomic  capital  expenditure  for  future  rural  electrification  transparently,  and  to  remove  the \nprevailing cross-subsidies. \n  \n\nc. \n\nGovernment Road Map for Sector Reforms  \n\nThe Road Map for Electricity Market Establishment and Development, approved by the \n17. \nPrime  Minister,  envisages  a  phased  approach  to  sector  reforms.  During  the  first  phase  of  the \npower  market\u2019s  development,  the  competition  will  be  only  among  the  power  plants.  A  pilot \ninternal power market limited to EVN power plants was initiated in January 2007. Beginning in \n2009,  a  single  buyer  will  act  as  an  intermediary  between  the  power  plants  and  distribution \ncompanies. The single buyer will sell electricity to distribution companies and large consumers \nat regulated prices. The next phase of the power market development will entail the wholesale \ncompetitive market, where sellers (power plants) and buyers (distribution companies and large \nconsumers)  will  compete  in  a  power  pool.  The  final  stage  will  be  retail  competition,  which  will \nallow  retail  consumers  to  choose  their  supplier.  An  important  issue  is  the  degree  of \nindependence  of  the  single  buyer  and  the  system  operator  from  the  rest  of  EVN,  which  could \ncontinue to own and control a significant stake in partially corporatized power plants during the \nearly stage of reform. This will require transparent rules for market operation, for dispatching of \npower plants, and for settlement, as well as appropriate regulatory oversight. The ongoing ADB \nTA to the Electricity Regulator16 will address these strategic issues. \n \n\nd. \n\nRegulation of the Electricity Sector \n\n18. \nThe main functions of the electricity regulator are to (i) issue licenses to sector entities, \nand  to  enforce  the  license  conditions;  (ii)  advise  the  minister  on  market  structure  and  industry \nrestructuring policy; (iii) establish the tariff-setting principals, including transfer pricing between \nsector  entities;  (iv)  develop  tariffs  for  regulated  activities;  (v)  approve  power  purchase \nagreements of the single buyer (EVN or a new entity to be establish after 2009); (vi) ensure the \nprocurement  of  adequate  new  generation  and  transmission  capacity;  (vii)  monitor  the \nimplementation  progress  of  new  generation  and  transmission  projects;  and  (viii) monitor  the \nfunctioning of power market. The regulator\u2019s role also involves ensuring proper performance of \nkey  market  institutions,  such  as  the  single  buyer,  the  system  operator,  and  the  transmission \ncompany, in providing equal opportunities to the power plants taking part in the power market. \nADB,  together  with  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  De  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  and  the  World  Bank,  are \nassisting  MOI  in  developing  instruments,  such  as  transparent  rules  for  market  operation  and \ndispatch of power plants and settlements, as well as appropriate regulatory oversight that would \naddress the concerns of the private sector.  \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Power Market Design. Manila. (TA \n\n4768-VIE, approved on 1 March, for $500,000). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\ne. \n\nCorporate Restructuring of EVN  \n\n19. \nThe  Government  has  taken  steps  to  restructure  the  electricity  industry  by  establishing \nViet  Nam  Electricity  (EVN)  based  on  a  holding  company  structure  to  replace  the  vertically \nintegrated  EVN  in  October  2006.  The  Government  approved  the  equitization  (partial \nprivatization) plan for 2007-2008 in April 2007 for equitizing most of the operating units engaged \nin power generation and distribution. All the existing power plants except the three multipurpose \nhydropower plants (Hoa Binh, Yaly, and Tri An) and the 9 regional power distribution companies \nwill be equitized during 2007-2008. The thermal power complexes and hydropower plants that \nare  of  cascade  in  nature  will  be  grouped  into  individual  companies  for  the  purpose  of \nequitization.  Prior  to  the  approval  of  this  equitization  plan  in  April  2007,  two  thermal  power \nplants,  one  hydropower  plant  and  a  provincial  power  distribution  company  were  equitized  in \n2006.  The  power  transmission  system  and  the  load  dispatch  centre  will  be  a  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary  of  EVN.  The  non-core  business  of  EVN,  such  as  EVN  Telecom,  consulting \ncompanies,  manufacturing  companies,  and  others,  likewise  will  be  equitized  during  the  same \nperiod.  The  project  management  boards  responsible  for  managing  EVN  projects  will  become \nindependent subsidiaries. They will be required to compete for management of EVN-sponsored \nprojects, and will be free to undertake power projects of other investors.  \n   \n\nf. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Issues  \n\nThe  rapid  expansion  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector  will  result  in  significant  environmental \n20. \nand  social  externalities.  The  addition  of  more  than  10,000  MW  of  new  power  generation \ncapacity  based  on  coal  over  the  next  5-8  years  will  increase  greenhouse  gas  emissions. \nHowever,  the  current level  of  per  capita  greenhouse  gas emissions in  Viet  Nam  is  among  the \nlowest  in  the  world.17 Viet  Nam  is  a  signatory18 to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,19 which  aims  to  reduce \ngreenhouse  gas  (including  carbon  dioxide \nthe  atmosphere.  The \nGovernment has strengthened its approval process for environment impact assessments (EIA) \nthrough  the  new  Environmental  Law  that  took  effect  on  1  July  2006.  Provincial  authorities \nrecently have been assigned more authority over the implementation of resettlement plans and \ncompensation arrangements for land acquisition for project-affected people, and improvements \nhave  been  reported.  In  this  context,  the  Project  will  comply  with  the  stringent  environmental \nmitigations  measures  required  under  the  law  and  will  have  state  of  the  art  environmental  air \npollution control equipment installed. \n \n\n[CO2])  emissions \n\nto \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\nfor \n\nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC),  Swedish \n\n21. \nA major portion of external assistance to Viet Nam\u2019s power sector has come from ADB, \nInternational  Development \nJapan  Bank \nCooperation  Agency  (Sida),  and  the  World  Bank.  JBIC  has  provided  assistance  for  thermal \npower  plants  (gas  and  coal),  hydropower  plants,  and  500 kV  transmission  lines.  The  World \nBank  has  provided  loans  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  networks.  It  also  has \nprovided TA in (i) power sector policy and strategy, (ii) institutional strengthening, (iii) demand-\nside  management,  (iv)  renewable  energy,  (v)  BOT  law,  and  (vi)  development  of  the  Electricity \nLaw. Sida has supported preparation of a hydropower development master plan and financing \nof  a  hydropower  project.  Other  bilateral  sources  of  assistance  to  the  power  sector  include \n\n                                                 \n17  The  UN  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC),  2005  shows  that  Viet  Nam  emits  0.3  tons \nCO2/capita, compared to 6.3 tons CO2/capita by Japan, 8.8 tons CO2/capita by United Kingdom, and 20.6 tons CO2 \nper capita by the USA. \n\n18 Viet  Nam  signed  the  treaty  on  3  December  1998  and  ratified  it  on  25  September  2002.

The  main \nlessons  from  these  loans  were  the  need  to  ensure  that  (i)  technical  designs  are  completed \nbefore equipment and material is procured to match design requirements; (ii) adequate capacity \nis built into the power management board (implementing agency) in regard to ADB\u2019s policies in \nconsulting  services  and  procurement;  (iii)  procurement  approval  is  delegated  to  the  project \nmanagement board; (iv) the process for bid document approval and contract award applicable \nto ADB-financed contracts under the loan is clarified at the outset; (v) a satisfactory resettlement \nplan  and  framework  is  in  place  before  loan  approval;  and  (vi)  specific  environmental \nrequirements,  including  documentation  and  reporting,  are  included  in  loan  covenants  and \nbidding documents. The Government\u2019s approval process, particularly for procurement, remains \ntime-consuming and has led to project implementation delays. Therefore, the proposed Project \nhas  provided  for  appropriate  advance  procurement  action  and  the  Government  has  delegated \nthe  approval  of  project  procurement  to  EVN  to  expedite  implementation.  EVN  Management \napproved  the  procurement  plan  in  June  2007  and  submitted  it  to  ADB  for  review  and \nendorsement.  ADB  approval  to  the  proposed  procurement  plan  was  given  on  12  July  2007. \nMoreover, day to day project management responsibilities have been reassigned from EVN to a \nproject  implementation  unit\u2014the  Thermal  Power  Project  Management  Unit  1  (TPPMU  1)\u2014to \nensure  smooth  implementation.  As  this  agency  is  a  dependent  unit  of  EVN,  which  is  the \nExecuting Agency for the Project, EVN will also monitor and oversee project implementation.  \n \n23. \nThe  lessons  from  the  implementation  of  previous  projects  have  been  incorporated  into \nthe  project  design,  and  measures  put  in  place  to  strengthen  the  Implementing  Agency.  In \naddition, experience from past coal power plants financed by ADB was taken into consideration. \nThese  include  (i)  ensuring  stack  height  is  sufficient  for  air  dispersion;  (ii)  using  clean  coal \ntechnology  for  the  boiler;  (iii)  installing  flue  gas  desulphurization  equipment,  selective  catalytic \nreduction  of  nitrogen  oxide,  and  electrostatic  precipitators;  (iv)  disposing  of  ash  properly;  (v) \nensuring the air quality monitoring component is adequate; and (v) optimizing positive impacts \non  people\u2019s  livelihood,  and  designing  appropriate  livelihood  development  programs.  In  this \ncontext,  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  management  plans  (EMP)  were  strengthened  and \nmitigation measures developed. \n \nEarlier ADB TAs (attached to loans) concentrated on (i) providing capacity building to the \n24. \npower sector, specifically to financial management of EVN\u2019s distribution units; (ii) providing cost-\nbased  electricity  tariff-setting;  (iii)  commercialization  of  distribution  companies;  and  (iv)  setting \nup a power sector regulatory framework. As a result, the corporate governance of the sector has \nimproved.  A  TA  on  power  market  design  (footnote  16)  is  assisting  the  Government  in  making \nstrategic  decisions  regarding  the  (i)  market  structure;  (ii)  role  of  EVN  and  its  subsidiaries,  and \nthe  relationship  among  them;  (iii)  nature  of  the  regulatory  regime  and  key  regulatory \nmechanisms; and (iv) the terms of power purchase arrangements for new and equitized power \nplants.  A  TA  is  being  prepared  for  approval  in  2007  to  strengthen  EVN\u2019s  environmental \nmanagement capacity and the provincial environment office capacity (para. 36) in Mong Duong. \n \n\n5. \n\nCapacity Building \n\nThe  Project  is  one  of  the  largest  undertaken  by  TPPMU1.  The  project  implementation \n25. \nunit was established and staffed by TPPMU1 in May 2006. TPPMU1 is competent to implement \nthe  Project.  Capacity  building  will  be  provided  under  the  Project  to  train  TPPMU1  staff  on  the \napplication of ADB policies for procurement of goods and services, invoicing and payments to \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\ncontractors, and project management. Capacity building on circulatory fluidized bed (CFB) boiler \ntechnology  will  be  provided  under  the  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC) \ncontract  package,  and  by  the  implementation  consultants.  The  Project  provides  for  adequate \ninternational  implementation  consulting  services  for  the  design,  procurement,  implementation, \nand capacity building phases of the Project, with participation of TPPMU1 and EVN at all stages \nof  implementation.  Suppliers  will  also  be  required  to  provide  adequate  capacity  building  for \nTPPMU1  and  EVN  staff,  and \ntechnology  during \nimplementation of the contracts.  \n \nAs  part  of  implementing  the  EMP  for  the  Project,  institutional  strengthening  activities \n26. \nwithin  EVN  and  TPPMU1  will  be  carried  out.  Training  for  key  EVN  staff  on  environmental \nmanagement,  contractor  management \nissues,  and  public \nin  relation \ninvolvement processes will be provided. A full-time environmental officer will be engaged within \nTPPMU1  to  act  as  the  overall  coordinator  of  environmental  management  activities  associated \nwith the Project. An ADB consultant will provide training for this officer, as required, based on a \ntraining  needs  assessment.  In  addition,  key  TPPMU1  staff  will  be  provided  with  training  in \nenvironmental management and contract management.   \n \n\ntransfer  CFB  boiler  operational \n\nto  environmental \n\nto \n\n6. \n\nPublic-Private Sector Development Strategy \n\n27. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  increasing  private  investment  in  the  power  sector  as \npart  of  a  broader  strategy  to  meet  the  nation\u2019s  rapidly  growing  demand  for  electricity.  The \nGovernment  has  taken  extensive  measures  within  the  past  5  years  to  use  private  capital  to \ncomplement Government-led investments in a broad public-private partnership. This began with \nthe  ADB-assisted  private  sector  participation  in  the  Phu  My  power  complex,  and  is  being \nfollowed  through  in  the  Mong  Duong  thermal  power  complex.  In  addition,  ADB  is  currently \nassisting EVN in developing a gas power plant for private sector financing in southern Viet Nam. \nFurthermore,  the  Government  has  identified  power  generation  projects  where  state-owned \nenterprises, such as Petro Viet Nam, Vinacomin, and Lilama are developing these projects, with \nEVN  purchasing  the  power  based  on  negotiated  power  purchase  agreements.  Under  these \narrangements, the relevant state enterprise may seek financing from private sector sources on \nthe understanding that such financing will be substantially on a non-recourse basis, subject to \nproject  risks,  and  mitigated  only  in  exceptional  cases  by  Government  guarantees.  Recently, \nMOI provided a mandate to the International Finance Corporation to assist the Government in \ndeveloping  an  IPP  framework  that  will  support public  private  partnerships  in  power  generation \nprojects  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  mandate  calls  for  developing  a  BOT  framework  that \nwould  support  the  development  of  IPPs  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  annual  $3  billion  power \ninvestment  program.  In  2006,  EVN  purchased  about  14%  of  its  power  requirements  from  the \nprivate sector, and this figure is expected to reach 33% by 2010. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n28. \nThe Project comprises the construction of the 1,000 MW Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power \nPlant, the power complex that will have an installed generating capacity of 2,000 MW or 2,200 \nMW upon completion, depending on the boiler technology selected for the second phase. The \nProject will (i) provide an adequate and reliable power supply to meet part of Viet Nam\u2019s rapidly \ngrowing  electricity  demand  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  manner;  (ii)  help  increase  the \nshare  of  thermal  power  generation  capacity  in  Viet  Nam,  thereby  correcting  the  current  dry \nseason  imbalance  of  hydropower  plants;  and  (iii)  facilitate,  through  the  inclusion  of  common \nfacilities to be shared by the Mong Duong 1 and 2 thermal power projects, the construction of \nMong Duong 2 by a private sector developer under a BOT arrangement. The Project will provide \nfor appropriate capacity building in number of areas, and incorporate all necessary environment \nand social safeguards.  \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n29. \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  Project  will  be  to  (i) meet  electricity  demand  growth  and \nensure  power  system  reliability  to  sustain  economic  growth  in  northern  Viet  Nam;  (ii)  diversify \nfuel generation sources by increasing the thermal generation capacity, and gradually reducing \nthe current the imbalance of hydropower plants in the power system by 2020; and (iii) facilitate \nprivate sector participation in the second phase (Mong Duong 2) of the Project. The immediate \noutcome of the Project will be that households, small business, industries, and rural consumers \nin  northern  Viet  Nam  will  have  a  reliable  supply  of  electricity  and  more  opportunities  for \neconomic development. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project site is in Mong Duong ward, Cam Pha district, Quang Ninh Province, about \n30. \n300 km northeast of Hanoi. The 107-hectare (ha) site is sufficient to support a power complex \nwith a capacity of 2,200 MW. The site is close to a major source of coal, has access to the sea \nfor cooling water, and good transport links for fuel and materials. The Project is scheduled for \ncommissioning  in  2013.  The  construction  of  Mong  Duong  1  power  plant  and  the  associated \ncommon facilities will support the development of Mong Duong 2 by the private sector.  \n \nC. \n\nTechnical Justification  \n\nAvailable  clean  coal  technologies  evaluated  for  the  Project  include  conventional \n31. \npulverized coal-fueled boilers, super critical boilers (operating at much higher temperatures and \npressures),  integrated  coal  gasification  combined  cycle  units,  and  CFB  boilers.  The  TA \nconsultants found the CFB technology to be optimal for the following reasons: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPulverized coal-fueled boilers require sulfur and nitrous dioxide cleaning equipment \n(not necessary for CFB technology) that would be more expensive in capital cost and \noperations for the type of coal to be used.  \nAlthough  super  critical  boiler  technology  is  well-established,  it  requires  high-quality \nand  costly  manufacturing  technology,  and  is  not  suitable  for  the  relatively  poor-\nquality  domestic  anthracite  available.  It  is  more  suited  for  countries  with  a  much \nhigher  cost  of  delivered  coal,  and  an  established  advanced  industrial  technology \nbase to support it during plant operation and maintenance. \nIntegrated  coal  gasification  combined  cycle  technology  is  still  largely  in  the \ndevelopment  stage,  and  the  first  commercial  plants  are  generally  at  the  prototype \nstage. \n\n \nBased  on  this  assessment,  unit  size  of  250  MW  CFB  boilers, 20  matched  with \n32. \nconventional 500 MW turbo-generators, were found optimally suited to burn the generally poor-\nquality  and  expected  variability  of  fuel  (blended  coal  mixture)  available  for  the  Project. \nWorldwide,  CFB  technology  is  still  evolving  for  boiler  sizes  above  250  MW.  As  the  long-term \nreliability of the 250 MW boilers has been established, this boiler size is being considered for the \nProject.  Thus,  the  Project  requires  four  250  MW  CFB  boilers  and  two  500  MW  turbines.  To \nsatisfy  permissible  national  air  emission  limits, 21  the  CFB  boilers  will  be  equipped  with \nelectrostatic precipitators to limit particulate emission. Moreover, sulfur dioxide emissions will be \nlimited by injecting limestone into the boiler during combustion, and nitrous oxide emissions will \n\n                                                 \n20 Actual unit sizes will depend on bids received and may vary from 250 MW to 300 MW.  \n21 Viet Nam\u2019s standard for air emissions is more stringent than the World Bank standard for sulfur dioxide (SO2) and \nnitrous oxide (NOx). World Bank standard for SO2 are 2,000 milligrams/normal cubic meters (mg/Nm3) and NOx at \n1,500  mg/Nm3.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  requirements  for  SO2 are  at  350  mg/Nm3,  NOx  700  mg/Nm3,  and  particulates  at  140 \nmg/Nm3  for  an  industrial  zone;  SO2 at  280  mg/Nm3,  NOx  at  560  mg/Nm3,  and  particulates  at  112  mg/Nm3  for  an \nurban zone. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nbe  reduced  due  to  the  low  combustion  temperature  of  a  CFB  boiler  and  the  flue  gas \nrecirculation  techniques  employed  during  combustion.  This  technology  eliminates  the  need  for \nexternal sulfur and nitrous oxide removal equipment, which is expensive in terms of capital cost \nand operational cost, and presents waste product disposal difficulties. \n\nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n33. \nEVN will use new but proven CFB technology, which enables the efficient use of poor-\nquality and waste coal by blending it with better coal. If not used, the waste coal will be burned \ninefficiently  on  a  small  scale  with  fewer  environmental  mitigation  measures,  or  it  will  remain \naround the coal mines contributing to atmospheric dust and environmental pollution. \n \n34. \nThe Project will catalyze private sector participation by (i) supporting site preparation and \ndevelopment  of  common  facilities  required  by  the  next  phase  of  Mong  Duong  expansion;  (ii) \nproviding  for  a  common  EIA,  together  with  mitigation  measures  and  a  costed  EMP  (including \ncosts  of  the  private  sector);  (iii)  preparing  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  whole  power  complex, \nplus  the  monitoring  of  its  implementation;  and  (iv)  addressing  capacity  building  of  EVN  in \nenvironment,  resettlement,  and  CFB  technology.  With  these  services  included  in  the  Project\u2019s \nscope,  the  programming  and  private  sector  financing  of  Mong  Duong  2  might  be  accelerated, \nand certain risk premiums avoided (e.g., environment and resettlement risks). The Government \nand EVN have recognized that the risk should be borne by the party most capable of controlling \nsuch  risks.  Thus,  the  Project  has  a  synergistic  application  of  facilitating  the  public-private \npartnership.  \n \n35. \nThe construction of the Project will affect 41 ha of mangrove. To offset the expected loss \nof  mangrove  ecosystems,  a  mangrove  management  and  monitoring  plan  has  been  prepared \nand  included  in  the  EIA.  The  key  elements  of  the  plan  are  described  in  Appendix  4.  About \n300,000 tons per year of ash, which has good cementatious properties, will be sold to cement \nindustries, and for use in making roller-compacted concrete for various applications (notably for \nhydropower weirs, etc.), once the plant becomes operational. \n \n36. \nCapacity Building of EVN, TPPMU1, and Quang Ninh Department of Natural Resources \nwill  be  undertaken  to  strengthen  their  institutional  capacity  in  environment  management.  ADB \nwill provide TA22 in 2007 that will strengthen Quang Ninh\u2019s Department of Natural Resources to \nenable  it  to  monitor  (a)  air  quality  in  project  area  during  construction    and  operational  phase; \nand  (b)  operations  at  the  coal  mines  in  the  province  adequately,  and  to  ensure  that  their \nenvironmental mitigation measures are implemented effectively. Capacity building in mangrove \nreplanting and monitoring activities will also be provided to personnel of Bai Tu Long National \nPark.  \n \nE. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,099.60  million.  The  summary  cost  estimates  of  the \n37. \nProject  are  in  Table  4,  while  the  detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  5.

Further, the Government has requested that \nfinancing be provided in two loans under ADB\u2019s MFF, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Pilot Financing \nInstruments and Modalities23 approved in August 2005. The Government\u2019s preferred this mode \nof financing for the Project, rather than adopting a traditional project loan approach, largely due \nto  (i)  the  loan  being  almost  $1  billion,  when  only  $27.86  million  is  needed  for  preconstruction \nworks  in  the  first  2  years;  (ii)  the  need  for  sufficient  time  (about  20  months)  to  (a)  finalize \ndetailed  designs  for  the  Project,  (b)  prepare  bidding  documents,  (c)  undertake  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) following ADB guidelines, (d) negotiate with the highest-ranked EPC \ncontractor,  and  (e)  award  the  main  EPC  contract  to  the  selected  contractor;  and  (iii) \napprehension that bids for the EPC contract could escalate unless the bidding community sees \nthat financing is firmly in place beforehand. The Government, therefore, decided on two loans\u2014\nthe first loan will be provided for the site preparation works, while the second will be extended \nwhen the EPC contractor has been selected and the contract is ready to be awarded. \n \nThe  Government  has  confirmed  its  intention  to  enter  into  a  framework  financing \n39. \nagreement (FFA) with ADB in the form presented to the Board. The FFA in this form satisfies \nthe  requirements  set  forth  in  Appendix  4  of  ADB\u2019s  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and  Modalities \n(footnote  23).  Pursuant  to  the  FFA,  the  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  the  first  periodic \nfinancing  request  (PFR)  for  a  loan  of  $27.86  million  from  OCR.  The  form  of  this  PFR  is  also \npresented to the Board of Directors with the FFA. All of the provisions of the ordinary operations \nloan regulations applicable to London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based loans24 will apply \nto each loan, subject to any modifications that may be included under any loan agreement. \n \nThe  Government  can  choose  from  eligible  currencies  and  the  interest  rate  regime  for \n40. \neach loan. The specific terms of each loan will be set out in the applicable loan agreement and \nbased  on  the  related  PFR,  with  interest  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \n\n                                                 \n23  ADB. 2005. Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities.

Meanwhile,  EVN  will  provide  local  currency \nequivalent  to  $16.15  million  (36.7%)  for  (i)  local  project  management,  (ii)  preparation  of \ntechnical designs and bid documents, (iii) taxes and duties, (iv) resettlement compensation, (v) \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  and  environment  plans,  and  (vi)  hydrological  surveys.  The \nterms of reference for the consulting services have been finalized, and ADB Management has \napproved  advance  recruitment.  EVN  has  prepared  a  long  list  of  consulting  firms  who  have \nsubmitted  expressions  of  interest,  and  will  complete  the  shortlist  in  June  2007  and  issue  the \nrequest for proposal in July 2007. The Borrower will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, and \nthe proceeds of each OCR loan will be onlent to EVN pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement \nwith terms and conditions acceptable to ADB \n \n\nb. \n\nSecond Loan \n\n43. \nApproval  of  a  second  loan  for  $902.85  million  is  expected  when  procurement \nprocedures and contract negotiations for the EPC contract are completed substantially, which is \nanticipated in the third quarter of 2009. The second loan will finance primarily the remaining civil \nworks,  the  EPC  contract  (estimated  at  $744.13  million),  and  the  second  phase  of  consulting \nservices  for  the  construction  supervision  of  the  EPC  contractor  and  the  civil  works  contracts. \nThe  scope  of  the  remaining  civil  works  will  include  construction  of  common  facilities  for  the \nProject and Mong Duong 2 (the BOT component) such as: (i) fuel oil and limestone jetties, (ii) \nsite  boundary  and  drainage,  (iii)  electrical  system  for  start  up,  (iv)  cooling  water  discharge \nchannel  beyond  the  outfall,  (v)  cooling  water  inlet  and  outlet  channels,  (vi)  fresh  water  supply \nsystem during operation of the plant, and (vii) first ash pond. \n \n44. \nThe  scope  of  works  under  the  EPC  contract  will  comprise  of  detailed  engineering \ndesign  and  drawings,  procurement,  construction,  testing,  commercial  operation,  and  warranty \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nfor  the  main  project  works.

The  consultants  will  also  provide \ntraining  to  TPPMU1  staff  in  project  financial  management,  contract  management,  CFB \ntechnology, and operation and maintenance. ADB will finance $9032.85 million (85.5%) of the \nsecond  tranche,  while  EVN  will  provide  the  equivalent  of  $152.74  million  (14.5%)  in  local \ncurrency  as  counterpart  financing  for  the  owner\u2019s  project  management,  taxes  and  duties,  and \ncontingency. The Borrower will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, and the proceeds of the \nOCR  loan  will  be  onlent  to  EVN  pursuant  to  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement,  with  terms  and \nconditions acceptable to ADB. The detailed description and cost of this second OCR loan is in \nAppendix 6 (Table A6.2). \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n46. \nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  EVN.  The  Implementing  Agency  will  be \nTPPMU1,  which  has  established  an  adequately  staffed  project  management  unit  (PMU)  with \nproject offices initially at the Hanoi headquarters. The PMU subsequently will set up an office at \nthe  project  site.  The  implementation  consultants,  therefore,  will  comprise  of  international \nconsultants  in  association  with  qualified  national  consultants.  The  consultants  will  assist  the \nPMU with EPC procurement and project management, environment management planning, and \nimplementation  of  resettlement  plans.  EVN  will  engage  suitable  national  consultants  to  assist \nwith  EVN-funded  procurement  and  project  management.  In  general,  EVN  and  TPPMU1  are \nconsidered  competent  bodies  to  administer  the  proposed  Project.  A  detailed  assessment  of \nEVN and TPPMU 1 is in Appendix 7, and in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n47. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  including  procurement  and  construction \nactivities,  and  is scheduled  to  be  completed  by  July  2013. The  first loan  will  have a  utilization \nperiod of 6 years, while the second loan will have a utilization period of 4 years. The Project has \nbeen appraised fully, and the first loan is ready for disbursement and implementation soon after \nBoard approval. The implementation schedule for the Project is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n48. \nEquipment and materials to be financed under the MFF will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be \nincorporated  in  bidding  documents  for  all  ADB-financed  contracts.  ICB  will  be  used  for  (i)  civil \nworks  with  an  estimated  value  of  $3  million  and  above,  (ii)  turnkey  contracts,  and  (iii)  supply \ncontracts estimated to cost at least $1 million. National competitive bidding (NCB) will be used \nfor civil works contracts estimated at below $3 million. NCB procedures or limited international \nbidding  will  be  used  for  supply  contracts  estimated  at  $100,000  to  $1  million.  Procurement  of \nmiscellaneous  goods  and  civil  works  contracts  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured \nusing  shopping  procedures.  Contract  packages  will  be  prepared  to  ensure  maximum \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\ncompetition  under  ICB.  The  proposed  ADB-financed  contract  packages  and  the  procurement \nplan are in Appendix 9.  \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsulting  services  will  be  procured  in  two  packages,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n49. \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, with a separate recruitment exercise for services under \neach of the two loans. Consulting inputs will total 820 person-months, comprising 556 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  264  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices.  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  method  will  be  adopted.  To  expedite \nimplementation,  EVN  has  commenced  preparation  of  detailed  designs  and  tender  documents \nfor all the main packages, including preparation of draft tender documents and other supporting \ndocumentation  for  all  other  packages.  The  international  consultants  primarily  will  review  the \nwork  completed  so  far,  and  update  and  finalize  detailed  designs  and  tender  documents.  They \nwill  assist  throughout  the  bidding  process, including  contract  negotiations  and  awarding  of  the \nEPC contract, and supervise the implementation of each loan. A brief summary of the scope of \nwork  of  the  consultants  under  each  loan  is  given  in  paragraphs  51and  52,  and  described  in \nmore  detail  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  ADB  Management  approved  advance  action  for \nrecruitment of consultants in August 2006, and EVN is finalizing the long list of consulting firms \nand terms of reference. \n \nThe  scope  of  consulting  services  under  the  first  loan  includes  (i)  reviewing  technical \n50. \ndesigns, drawings and prepared by EVN, and revising these designs, if necessary; (ii) preparing \nbid  documents  for  selection  of  the  EPC  contractor  for  Mong  Duong  1;  (iii)  reviewing  and \nupdating  the  bid  documents  for  the  civil  works  contracts;  (iv)  assisting  EVN  in  all  contract \nnegotiations and contract awards, including the EPC contract; (v) supervising implementation of \ncivil  works  under  the  first  loan;  (vii)  assisting  TPPMU1  in  implementing  the  EMP  and \nresettlement plan; (viii) assisting EVN in the selection of consultants for the second loan of the \nProject;  (ix)  guiding  and  supervising  resettlement  committees,  and  training  staff  of  TPPMU1, \nand various environmental and resettlement committees; and (x) guiding the implementation the \ngender strategy. \n \n51. \nThe scope of consulting services for the second loan primarily will cover overall project \nmanagement  and  supervision  of  the  EPC  contract,  including  construction  supervision; \ngenerating plant commissioning and commercial acceptance testing and warranties; supervision \nof  civil  works  contracts;  and  continued  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and \nresettlement plan. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n52. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, EVN, and TPPMU1. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  the  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of EVN, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \nAttention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  that  was  added  to  ADB\u2019s \n53. \nProcurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  particularly  the  need  for \nbidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of ethics in the \nprocurement  and  execution  of  contracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and  corruption  are \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\ndiscovered.  Based  on  Government  policy  and  experience  in  fighting  corruption,  EVN\u2019s \ninspectorate  department  will  take  necessary  action  to  prevent  corruption  by  (i)  closely \nsupervising the bidding processes, bid evaluation, and construction; (ii) preventing interference \nin  the  bidding  and  evaluation  process;  and  (iii)  briefing  TPPMU1  and  the  related  Government \nauthorities,  including  the  local  prosecutor\u2019s  office,  when  an  incident  of  corruption  has  been \ndetected. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements and Advance Contracting \n\nThe  proceeds  of  individual  loans  under  the  MFF  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \n54. \nADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  loan  disbursements, 25 as  amended  from  time  to  time.  The  Government \nand EVN have been informed that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n55. \nEVN  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project.  Within  6  months  of  the  close  of \neach financial year, EVN will submit to ADB annual audited project accounts and annual audited \nfinancial  statements.  The  annual  financial  statements  will  be  consolidated  for  all  of  EVN\u2019s \noperations.  The  financial  management  systems  and  procedures  of  EVN  have  been  assessed \nand found to meet ADB\u2019s requirements.  \n \nEVN  will  continue  to  engage  independent  auditors  to  audit  its  annual  financial \n56. \nstatements  and  annual  project  accounts,  with  a  memorandum  on  issues  identified  during  the \nprocess to be submitted with the respective reports. As part of the harmonization of procedures \nof  external  funding  agencies,  EVN  and  the  World  Bank  have  agreed  on  the  standards  to  be \nfollowed in auditing and preparation of financial statements. The auditors\u2019 terms of reference will \nbe  provided  to  ADB  for  review.  The  annual  financial  statements  will  be  prepared  using \nInternational Accounting Standards, and the annual audits will be carried out using International \nStandards of Auditing. The auditors will be required to provide an opinion on EVN\u2019s compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s financial covenants set out in each of the loan agreements, and indicate the details \nof the calculation for financial ratios in the covenants, in conformity with the definitions contained \nin the Loan and Project Agreement. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n57. \nTPPMU1  will  prepare  progress  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  quarterly.  The  reports \nwill  provide  a  narrative  of  (i)  progress  during  the  quarter,  (ii)  changes  in  the  implementation \nimplementation \nschedule,  (iii)  problems  encountered,  (iv)  performance  of \nconsultants, and (v) the work to be carried out in the next period. The progress reports will also \ninclude  a  summary  of  financial  accounts  of  project  expenditures  during  each  quarter  to  date, \nand  expenditures  to  date.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  and  operation  of  the  Project \nbased  on  these  reports.  Further,  ADB  will  meet  with  EVN,  TPPMU1,  and  the  Government \nsemiannually to discuss project progress. TPPMU1 will monitor the performance, which will be \nevaluated  based  on  the  performance  indicators  or  targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework. \n \n\nthe  project \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n58. \nADB  will  field  an  Inception  Mission  soon  after  approval  of  the  investment  project.  ADB \nwill  review  the  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  and  EMPs,  as  well  as  the  project \ncomponents,  based  on  the  quarterly  reports.  ADB  will  also meet  with  EVN,  TPPMU1,  and  the \n\n                                                 \n25  ADB. 2001. Asian Development Bank Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila; and ADB. 2002.

A  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  3 \nyears  after  loan  effectiveness.  Representatives  of  ADB  and  EVN  will  take  part  in  the  review, \nenabling the midcourse corrections necessary to ensure successful project implementation and \nachievement of objectives. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB within 3 months \nof  project  completion.  Finally,  staff  will  provide  to  ADB  Board  and  Management  a  yearly \nimplementation  progress  report  by  first  week  of  December  each  year  until  the  Project  is \ncompleted. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \nThe  Project  is  included  in  the  Government's  5th  and  6th  PDMP.  The  long-term  system \n59. \noptimization under the 6th PDMP confirms that the Project is part of the least-cost schedule of \ncapacity addition to meet the growing electricity demand of the country. Detailed economic and \nfinancial  analyses,  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines,  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F.  \n \nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n60. \nThe economic viability of the Project was examined based on incremental costs incurred \nand  benefits  accrued  to  the  society.  This  analysis  was  conducted  by  comparing  the  societal \ncosts and benefits of the \"with Project\" scenario against the \"without Project\" scenario. All costs \nand benefits were evaluated based on a domestic price numeraire. EVN estimated the Project's \ncosts, which ADB staff checked and verified. Staff made adjustments to bring these estimated \ncosts to include social costs by applying shadow exchange rate factor (SERF).26 \n \nThe costs to the society are the investment and operating costs of the Project, as well as \n61. \nthe environmental mitigating costs. Investment costs, in turn, consist of (i) equipment costs; (ii) \nconstruction costs; and (iii) engineering, administrative, and management costs of power plant \nconstruction.  Fuel  (coal  and  limestone)  and  related  costs  account  for  a  significant  part  of  the \noperating  costs.  While  the  total  cost  takes  into  account  physical  contingencies,  it  excludes \ninterest during the construction and price contingencies.  \n \n62. \nThe  economic  value  of  electricity  generated  by  the  Project  is  measured  by  using  the \ncosts  to  the  society  of  not  having  the  Project  (the  so-called  avoided  costs).  These  costs \ncomprise  the  costs  of  suboptimal  operation  of  thermal  power  plants  to  partially  offset  the \nshortage  of  electricity  resulting  from  not  having  the  Project,  and  the  costs  to  consumers \n(industrial, residential, commercial, and rural) due to no electricity. In other words, the societal \nbenefits  of  the  Project  is  the  sum  of  two  components:  the  non-incremental  benefits  accrued \nthrough  savings  by  not  having  to  run  other  thermal  power  plants  suboptimally;  and  the \nincremental benefits accrued to the consumers by having sufficient supply of electricity to meet \ntheir needs, thus avoiding load shedding27 and associated economic losses. \n \nA detailed analysis (Appendix 10) demonstrates that the demand for electricity will grow \n63. \nquickly  between  2005  and  2025,  particularly  in  the  northern  region  where  the  Project  is  to  be \nconstructed. The analysis also confirms that the Project, which is scheduled to be added to the \ngrid in 2011, is part of a rigorously planned schedule of capacity additions to the power system \nduring  2006\u20132025.  Economic  valuation  of  costs  and  benefits  of  the  Project,  with  extensive \nsensitivity analysis, has confirmed the economic robustness of the Mong Duong power complex. \nThe Project yields an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 22.5% and corresponding net \npresent  value  (NPV)  of  $846.6  million  over  its  economic  life  of  30  years  (Supplementary \nAppendix F). \n\n                                                 \n26  SERF = 1.1 for Viet Nam. \n27  Load shedding means cutting power to certain areas or to sectors due to not able to service the demand.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nB. \n \n64. \nAn  additional  analysis  was  carried  out  to  examine  the  possible  impacts  of  a  large \ninvestment  such  as  this  Project  on  the  country\u2019s  debt  sustainability  and  other  macroeconomic \nindicators. The analysis was based on an ADB OCR assessment paper, draft 2007\u20132010 CSP, \nand  the  calculation  of  foreign  exchange  flow  of  the  Project.  This  analysis  showed  that  the \nproject  investment  does  not  alter  the  debt  sustainability  of  the  country  in  the  medium  to  long \nterm, because the disbursement of the loan is within the OCR limit. Since more than 70% of the \nADB loan will be awarded under an EPC contract, the Project will not have significant effects on \nsupply or consumer sectors, and does not suggest excessive inflation. Further, the Project will \ngenerate sufficient revenue to repay its associated loans. The financial evaluation of the Project \nwas  undertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant  2006  prices.  The  project  cost  estimates  and \nfinancial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  the  projected \neffects of foreign and domestic inflation, and currency fluctuations. The energy generated by the \nProject was conservatively valued at $0.041 per kWh, based on the price paid by EVN to IPPs. \nThe  cost  estimates  in  Appendix  5  are  used  for  the  financial  analysis,  excluding  price \ncontingencies  and  interest  during  construction.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR), \ncomputed after tax, is 6.59%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC),  also  computed  after  tax,  of  2.85%.  The  Project  is  considered  financially  viable  and \nsustainable.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  the  FIRR  remains  robust  under  adverse  conditions. \nThe detailed financial analysis is in Appendix 11. \n \n\nC. \n\nImpacts \n\n65. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  A  full  resettlement  plan,  covering  the  plant  site, \nash pond, discharge channel, and workers\u2019 site, has been prepared in accordance with the legal \nframework  of  Viet  Nam  and  ADB\u2019s  policies.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been  disclosed  to  the \npeople affected by the Project. Land acquisition requirements have been minimized by selecting \na  project  site  at  the  mouth  of  the  Mong  Duong  River.  The  area  is  used  for  coal  transport  and \nstorage; and has been heavily modified from its natural state with earthmoving, areas of fill, and \nchanges to waterway and hydrological conditions. The project area is generally hilly with some \ntree  plantations.  Based  on  the  preliminary  design,  about  148  ha  of  land  will  be  acquired \npermanently. Most of the affected land is degraded forest land (83 ha), fish ponds (41 ha), and \nindustrial land (24 ha). \n \n66. \nKhe  Guia  Lake,  about  10  km  from  the  project  site,  initially  was  to  provide  fresh  water \nsupply to the Project. Late in project preparation, however, the Quang Ning People\u2019s Committee \ndecided  that  fresh  water  supply  for  the  Project  will  be  sourced  from  the  Thac  Thay  River.  A \nsmall reservoir will have to be built to provide fresh water during plant operation. Due to the late \ndecision of the provincial authorities, EVN had difficulty preparing a detail resettlement plan, as \nwell as determining the line route of the water pipeline. In addition, this will have to be agreed \nwith  the  provincial  authorities.  ADB,  after  a  due  diligence  assessment  of  the  proposed  site, \ndetermined that no one lived in the area because it was hilly. A few people cut trees in the area \nto supply timber as props for the coal mines, and as sleepers for the railway. In accordance with \nan  agreement  with  EVN,  a  full  resettlement  plan  based  on  the  framework  will  be  prepared \n(Supplementary  Appendix  G)  for  the  reservoir,  if  necessary,  and  disclosed  before  approval  of \nthe second loan.  \n \n67. \nThe  objective  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  to  ensure  that  impacts  are  avoided  or \nminimized.  If  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  the  plan  is  to  provide  compensation, \nassistance,  and  socioeconomic  support  programs  to  ensure  that  the  people  affected  by  the \nProject will be able to restore or improve their socioeconomic status. Resettlement impacts will \ncomprise  the  following:  (i)  37  households  will  be  affected,  of  which  32  will  be  required  to \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\nrelocate;  (ii)  eight  coal  transportation  companies  and  one  tree  plantation  company  will  be \nrequired to move; (iii) one construction company will be partially affected; (iv) land of four farm \nowners  (timber,  fishpond,  and  fruit  trees)  will  be  acquired;  and  (v)  employees  of  farm  owners \n(80) and companies (306) might lose their jobs temporarily during the transition period when the \ncompanies  reorganize  their  activities.  The  Project  also  might  affect  fisherfolk  as  the  EIA \npredicted  a  possible  loss  of  revenue  from  fishing  and  aquaculture  during  construction  of  the \nplant. A suitable compensation plan has been prepared and included in the resettlement plan, \nwhich  will  be  updated  during  detailed  design  and  disclosed  to  project-affected  persons.  The \ncompensation payments will be adjusted upwards, if necessary. The summary resettlement plan \nis  in  Appendix  12,  while  the  full  resettlement  plan  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  A  public \ninformation booklet (Annex 8 to Supplementary Appendix H) also was prepared and disclosed \nto the people affected by the Project.  \n \nEnvironment. The Mong Duong complex has been classified as a Category A project in \n68. \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual  (OM)  and  Bank  Policies  (BP)  FI/BP: \nEnvironmental  Considerations  in  ADB  Operations.  Further,  an  EIA  has  been  prepared  for  the \nproject  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003). \nThe  EIA  describes  the  environmental  baseline  conditions  in  the  project  area,  and  records  the \nresults  of  a  comprehensive  examination  of  the  potential  impacts  of  the  Project  on  the \nsurrounding  natural  and  socioeconomic  environment.  A  one-time  air  quality  sampling  and \nanalysis  at  five  locations  showed  that  concentrations  of  total  suspended  particulate  exceeded \nnational air quality standards. As the limited sampling results cannot be used to determine the \nstatus  of  air  quality  in  an  airshed,  additional  monitoring  will  be  done  during  construction,  in \naccordance with the World Bank\u2019s Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines. A core part of \nthe EIA is an EMP, which documents the environmental mitigation and monitoring activities that \nwill be implemented throughout preconstruction, construction, and operation of the Project. The \nEMP contains a discussion of the institutional arrangements that will apply to its implementation, \nand the institutional strengthening activities that will be undertaken to ensure agencies involved \nin implementation have adequate resources to fulfill their obligations under the plan. The EMP \nalso  contains  detailed  cost  estimates  for  its  implementation.  Several  public  stakeholder \nconsultations have been held. A survey on the Project and its potential social and environmental \nbenefits as well as the views expressed by the project affected people, have been incorporated \nin the final EIA. The summary EIA was prepared and provided to the Government on 14 August \n2006. \n \n69. \nImportant issues that have been considered in the EIA include the effects of the Project \non ambient air, and surface water and groundwater quality. A range of technical mitigation and \npollution control measures, as well as capacity building, has been recommended for inclusion in \nthe  Project  to  reduce  these  impacts  to  acceptable  levels.  Moreover,  a  detailed  monitoring \nprogram  has  been  developed  for  ambient  air  and  water  quality.  The  effect  of  the  Project  on \nmangrove  ecosystems  also  has  been  considered,  and  a  program  of  mangrove  replanting  to \noffset identified biodiversity losses is included in the Project. These have been discussed with \nEVN and TPPMU1, which they have agreed to implement the measures indicated in the EMP. \nThe EIA for the transmission lines that will transmit the power generated by the power plant is \nincluded in a previous approved loan in 2005. \n \n70. \nSocial  and  Gender.  The Project is formulated to minimize potential social and gender \nrisks, and such impacts have been assessed along with other potential risks. The social impact \nof  the  Project  involves  (i)  loss  of  livelihood,  (ii)  land  acquisition,  (iii)  forest  and  mangrove \nencroachment, (iv) affect on aquatic resources, and (v) incremental pollution from coal dust. The \nsocial  analysis  indicates  that  the  Project  will  not  affect  any  ethnic  minority  households.  Thus, \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  is  not  triggered.  The  Project  could  increase the  potential \nfor the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases due to the influx of workers \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nduring construction. However, this potential will be mitigated or minimized through a program to \nincrease awareness and provide preventive measures for the local communities and workforce. \nThe  Project  will  address  social  impact  through  capacity  building  of  the  stakeholders  at  the \ngrassroots  level  to  increase  the  role  of  local  communities  in  implementing  and  monitoring  the \nresettlement  activities,  occupational  health  and  safety  program,  HIV/AIDS,  and  trafficking \nawareness campaign. The Summary of Poverty Reduction and Gender Strategy (Appendix 13) \ninclude measures to facilitate participation of the affected people and relevant stakeholders. The \nincreased  capability  and  awareness  of  men  and  women  commune  leaders,  men  and  women \nrepresentatives  from  affected  households  and  the  implementing  agency  will  enable  effective \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  EIA,  occupational  health  and  safety  program,  and \nHIV/AIDS.  \n \n71. \nOccupational Health and Safety Management System. Health-related hazards in the \nproject area primarily include respiratory problems, lung disease, and eyes and nose infections. \nIn  Mong  Duong,  68%  of  children  are  reported  to  suffer  from  respiratory  diseases,  while  50% \nhave  nose  and  eyes  infection.  The  Project  will  establish  an  Occupational  Health  and \nManagement System (OHSMS) that will include raising awareness and training employees and \nresidents to change the prevailing safety and health protection cultures, particularly burning of \ncoal in households for cooking and heating. The OHSMS will explore options for fuel switching \nby the households and include features for continual feedback and self-improvement. A safety \nand health committee will be established with active participation of men and women workers. \nSurveillance of the workers health system will be incorporated. \n \nD. \n \nThe financial and economic viability of the Project depends on the implementation of the \n72. \nother  components  of  the  power  system\u2019s  expansion  in  northern  Viet  Nam.  These  include \ninvestments in the transmission network and supplementary power generation capacity to avoid \noverloading  of  facilities  and  suboptimal  generation  operation.  EVN  and  the  private  sector  are \nmaking  concerted  efforts  to  mobilize  financing  and  implement  these  projects  successfully. \nTherefore, these risks are not considered serious, because (i) some new generation plants are \nunder  construction  in  northern  Viet  Nam,  and  (ii)  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  are  financing  the \nhigh-voltage  transmission  and  distribution  networks.  Through  the  proposed  power  sector \nreforms, the Government is taking steps to create an enabling environment that removes entry \nbarriers for third parties. These reforms are on track, with MOI taking the lead in promoting the \nregulatory framework to accelerate the reforms. Further, the Project, along with domestic private \nsector investors, is facilitating the mobilization of private sector investment in generation. \n \n73. \nThe  financial  projections  of  EVN  have  been  prepared  on  the  following assumptions:  (i) \noperational  efficiency  continues  to  improve,  (ii)  proceeds  continue  to  be  received  from  EVN\u2019s \nequitization (partial privatization) program, and (iii) tariff increases are implemented in a timely \nmanner to ensure EVN\u2019s prudent compliance with financial covenants. The projected reduction \nin system losses from 12.1% to 10.1 % in 2011 will improve EVN\u2019s operational efficiency. If the \nassumptions  on  fuel  costs, cost  of purchased power  from  IPPs,  and  the  shift  in the  consumer \nmix  deteriorate,  tariffs  would  have  to  be  adjusted.  The  sensitivity  of  financial  ratios  (used  as \nfinancial covenants)  to  the  adverse  movements  of  these  assumptions  was  assessed,  which  is \ndeemed important in the context of the proposed single buyer market structure. The Electricity \nRegulator,  established  in  2005  under  the  Electricity  Law,  continues  to  build  its  capacity  to  set \ntariffs  transparently  on  sound  economic  and  financial  grounds,  which  will  mitigate  this  risk \nsignificantly. The World Bank is assisting the Electricity Regulator in developing the framework \ntariff-setting mechanisms. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n74. \nPrivate  investment  in  new  projects  and  EVN\u2019s  ongoing  program  equitization  existing \npower  plants  is  envisaged  to  increase.  The  financial  proceeds  from  selling  equity  stakes  will \nalso contribute significantly to EVN\u2019s cash flows. As such, EVN\u2019s financials are assumed to be \nat  risk  if  the  equitization  program  is  unsuccessful.  However,  this  may  not  be  the  case  as  the \nPrime  Minister  approved  EVN\u2019s  equitization  plan  in  April  2007  to  complete  the  equitization \nprocess  by  end  2008..As  the  power  market  in  Viet  Nam  is  relatively  underdeveloped,  ADB, \nAFD,  and  the  World  Bank  will  establish  regulatory  mechanisms  through  ongoing  TAs  that \nencourage the private sector to take the market and regulatory risks that arise in the electricity \nmarket. \n \n75. \nSocial and resettlement risks involve the possibility that compensation, resettlement, and \nincome restoration measures might not be delivered as agreed, thereby disadvantaging affected \npeople and possibly delaying the start of civil works. This risk is being mitigated by ensuring that \nthe consultants and TPPMU1 have appropriate and competent specialists to assist in updating \nand implementing the resettlement plan. TPPMU1 will also engage an independent monitoring \norganization to supervise implementation. The establishment of the OHSMS for surveillance of \nworkers  health,  together  with  efficient  awareness  and  training  programs,  will  mitigate \noccupational  health  risks.  The  diversion  of  the  river  and  discharge  channel  will  affect  marine \nfisheries  and  mangrove  areas,  reducing  the  livelihood  potential  of  the  fisherfolk.  The \nresettlement  plan  incorporates  compensation  arrangements  for  loss  of  fisheries,  while  the  EIA \nwill  incorporate  a  community-based  mitigation  plan  for  fishery  and  community  involvement  in \nreplanting  of  mangroves.  The  continuation  of  economic  growth  of  7.5%  is  assumed.  Slower \ngrowth  would  reduce  the  rate  of  growth  in  electricity  demand.  However,  the  analysis  of  risks \nshows that the economic viability of the investment program remains robust even with adverse \nchanges in anticipated economic growth, and in other key risk factors and assumptions.  \n \n76. \nAnother  possible  risk  is  that  a  second  PFR  and  second  loan  will  not  be  made.  In  that \nscenario, the Project could be completed under financing provided by parties that do not require \nthat  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  be  applied  to  the  Project.  ADB\u2019s  strong  and  continuing \nrelationship with EVN and the Government mitigates this risk considerably. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n77. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTechnical issues.

However,  EVN  also  has  some  non-core \nbusinesses  engaged  in  manufacturing  and  other  industries,  the  largest  being  EVN  Telecoms. \nEVN  is  organized  into  a  number  of  different  types  of  entities,  including  15  independent \naccounting  units,  20  dependent  accounting  units,  6  administrative  units,  14  construction  and \nproject  management  units,  and  some  subsidiaries  and  joint  ventures  in  which  EVN  controls \nmore than 50% of the voting rights. In early 2007, the Government decided to convert EVN into \na  holding  company  called  Viet  Nam  Electricity  (EVN)  and  most  of  its  operating  entities  will  be \nconverted to limited liability companies with EVN retaining whole or partial ownership. \n\n2. \nEVN  was created in 1995 as a vertically integrated entity responsible for the electricity \nsector  in  Viet  Nam.  EVN\u2019s  operations  have  been  profitable  and  it  has  financed  the  rapid \nexpansion  of  the  electricity  sector  without  significant  fiscal  subsidies.  The  key  financial \nperformance indicators, such as debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), self-financing ratio (SFR), \nand  receivables,  have  been  maintained  at  prudential  limits.  Meanwhile,  the  average  end  user \ntariff  has  been  maintained  at  around  Vietnamese  Dong  (D)  853  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh) \n($0.053/kWh).  However,  to  satisfy  future  demand  for  electricity  resulting  from  rapid  economic \ngrowth,  EVN  will  need  to  make  considerable  investments  in  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution. A substantial portion of these investments will be financed by debt, sustained tariff \nincreases  are  required  to  maintain  adequate  levels  of  debt  service  and  self  financing  of  these \nnew investments. \n\nB. \n\nHistorical Performance \n\n3. \nEVN's electricity sales have doubled in 2000\u20132005, representing average annual growth \nof  15.2%.  Although  the  average  tariffs  net  of  sales  taxes  have  increased  only  marginally  from \nD660/kWh  ($0.047/kWh)  in  2000  to  D810/kWh  ($0.05/kWh)  by  2005,  EVN\u2019s  revenue  has \nincreased  from  D16.8  trillion  ($1,160  million)  in  2000  to  D38.0  trillion  ($2,400  million)  in  2005. \nFurther, its net profit nearly tripled from D888 billion ($62 million) in 2000 to D2.8 trillion (about \n$180 million) in 2005.  \n\n4. \nIn  recent  loans  approved  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  World  Bank,  the \nBanks  and  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  (the  Government)  agreed  to  adopt  new  financial \ncovenants  based  on  (i)  consolidated  EVN  financial  statements;  and  (ii)  EVN's  overall  financial \nviability  and  performance,  rather  than  arbitrarily  setting  tariffs  in  foreign  currency.  These \ncovenants  were  included  in  two  recently  approved  loans 1 as  follows:  (i)  self-financing  ratio \n(SFR) of 25%, (ii) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.5, and (iii) debt-equity ratio of 70:30. \nEVN complied with these covenants during 2000 to  2005. However, there has been a reduction \nin EVN\u2019s net cash flow and operating profits due to absence of tariff increases from 2003 -2006. \nThis has reduced the SFR to 25% in 2005 from 70% in 2003, and DSCR to 2.0 in 2005 from 5.3 \nin 2003. This is expected to be reversed with tariff increases of 8.8% effective from 1 January \n2007 and a further 5% increase in July 2008. The retail tariffs beyond 2009 will be adjusted to \nreflect the market prices in the competitive generation market to be set up in 2009. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nSocialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Northern  Power  Transmission  Sector  Project.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2005. \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for the Northern Power Transmission Expansion Sector Project. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n1. \n\nSales and Income \n\n5. \nThe  fastest  growth  in  electricity  sales  has  been  in  the  industrial  sector,  where  the \naverage annual growth was between 17% and 18% during 2000-2005 period. As a result, the \nindustrial  sector\u2019s  share  of  overall  demand  increased  from  40%  in  2000  to  45%  in  2005.  The \nhousehold sector also has shown considerable annual growth, averaging 12% over the past 12 \nyears. This is a result of increasing demand by existing customers and additional demand from \nnew connections, as more households are connected to the electricity supply system.  \n\nMore than 90% of EVN\u2019s revenue comes from electricity sales, with only 8% from other \n6. \nservices and products. Income from the telecommunications business, at D378 billion in 2005,is  \nless than 1% of EVN\u2019s total income. However, EVN Telecoms has its own ambitious investment \nand expansion plans, particularly regarding the development of its mobile telephone service and \nis expected to be a major contributor to EVN\u2019s consolidated revenues from 2007 onwards. \n\n2.  \n\nProduction and Supply \n\n7. \nIn  2005,  EVN  produced  more  than  52.3  terawatt-hours  (TWh)  from  its  own  power \nstations, and purchased an additional 12.5 TWh from independent power producers (IPP). The \nlargest  source  of  power  was  hydroelectricity  (33%),  followed  by  gas  turbines  (28%),  fuel  oil \n(23%),  and  coal-fired  power  stations  (16%).  IPPs  (including  imports)  account  for  24%  of  total \nsupply. However, electricity from hydropower has declined by 7% due to adverse hydrological \nconditions, resulting in a deficit that has been made up primarily from gas-fired power stations \nand an increase in power purchases from IPPs. As the gas-fired power plants are in the south, \npower is transmitted to the north at a high cost to meet the power shortages. This has resulted n \nhigher operating expenses and lower operating profits in 2005 compared to 2004.  \n\n3. \n\nOperating Costs \n\n8. \nDepreciation is one of the largest operating costs for EVN, accounting for over 30% of its \noperating  costs.  Under  the  Vietnamese  Accounting  System  (VAS),  depreciation  periods  are \ngenerally shorter than those allowed under International Accounting Standards, which accounts \nfor the relatively high levels of depreciation. EVN also relies on these high levels of depreciation \nto  fund  its  future  capital  expenditure  program  and  to  improve  the  SFR.  The  other  major  cost \nitems are fuel costs for thermal power stations and purchased electricity from IPPs. EVN uses \nlower calorific value (4,000\u20135,500 kilocalories per kilogram [kcal/kg] of domestic anthracite coal \nfor power generation. Generally, this coal has little value unless it is washed. The higher-quality \nanthracite coal is exported as coking coal. For this type of coal, EVN\u2019s cost currently varies from \n$24\u2013$28/ton but future prices will increase. Gas prices are denominated in US dollars, based on \nagreed volume and long-term contracts. In recent months, new agreements have been linked to \na  fuel  price  index  due  to  increased  drilling  costs.  EVN  does  not  receive  any  direct  operating \nsubsidies  from  the  Government  to  cover  its  operating  costs.  However,  the  Government  does \ninject  additional  capital  to  help  finance  specific  investments,  such  as  the  Son  La  hydropower \nplant and provides access to lower interest loans from state-owned banks.  \n\n4. \n\nCapital Expenditure \n\nDuring  2000\u20132005,  EVN  invested  more  than  D81.5 trillion  in  new  capital  works. \n9. \nApproximately  45%  of  this  expenditure  has  been  financed  by  taking  out  additional  long-term \nloans, while the remainder was financed from its own resources (50%) and capital injections by \nthe Government (5%). Outstanding long-term loans have increased from about D26.9 trillion in \n2000 to more than D53.7 trillion by 2005. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\n \n\nC.  \n\nFinancial Projections (2005\u20132010)  \n\n1. \n\nSales and Revenue \n\n10. \nThe  corporate  structure  of  EVN  is  envisaged  to  change  under  the  proposed  power \nsector reforms. However, EVN is likely to remain a holding company, owning significant stakes \nof the operating subsidiaries. Electricity sales are assumed to reach 108 terawatt-hours (TWh) \nin  2011,  compared  with  44.5  TWh  in  2005,  representing  annual  growth  of  16%  during  2006\u2013\n2011. Electricity sales by each regional distribution company have been projected for different \nconsumer  categories,  and  consolidated  to  derive  the  total  sales  and  projected  revenues.  The \nprojections  are  based  on  tariff  assumptions  prepared  by  EVN  to  ensure  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants. An increase of 8.8% in the average tariff level of D853/kWh ($0.053/kWh) effective \nfrom 1 January 2007 and 5% effective from the middle of 2008 are assumed in the projections.   \n\n2. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n11. \nThe  operating  expenses  of  EVN  largely  depend  on  the  plant  mix  used  for  meeting  the \nforecast  demand  and  fuel  price  projections.  The  plant  mix  for  2006\u20132011  is  based  on  the \neconomic  merit  order  dispatch  of  the  available  plants  at  different  years,  subject  to  the \nhydrological  and  transmission  constraints  and  contractual  commitments  with  IPPs.  System \nlosses are to be reduced from their current level of 12.6% to about 10.9% by 2011. In addition, \nEVN  is  expected  to  increase  its  purchases  from  third  parties  from  12.5  TWh  in  2005  to  33.6 \nTWh  from  by  2011\u2014i.e.,  about  27%  of  total  generation  of  125 TWh  from  private  power \nproducers, joint venture companies, and imports.  \n\n12. \nFuel  consumption  is  based  on  the  projected  plant  mix,  and  the  fuel  expenses  were \nbased on Viet Nam\u2019s expected domestic fuel prices. Coal prices are kept at around $24\u2013$28 per \nton  during  2005\u20132010.  Although  these  are  below  the  prevailing  international  coal  prices,  the \ncoal  used  by  EVN  is  of  lower  quality.  As  such,  the  price  is  not  directly  comparable  with  the \ninternational  prices  for  good-quality  coal.  The  absence  of  data  on  actual  production  costs  of \ndifferent  types  of  coal  mines  and  a  transparent  coal  market  in  Viet  Nam  make  identifying  any \nimplicit subsidy to EVN through the discounted coal prices difficult. Gas prices are based on the \nproduction share agreements signed with the international gas field developers.  \n\n3.  \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\n13. \nEVN  is  to  make  cumulative  capital  investments  of  D234  trillion  ($14.2  billion)  during \n2006\u20132011, compared with D81.5 trillion during 2000\u20132005 implying a threefold increase in the \ncapital  investment.  The  debt  service  commitment  during  2006\u20132011  will  also  increase  to  D79 \ntrillion,  compared  with  D20  trillion  in  the  previous  6-year  period.  In  addition  to  the  direct \ninvestments,  EVN  is  also  planning  to  form  joint  venture  companies  to  implement  some  of  the \npower generation projects (e.g., Hai Phong coal power plant) in 2006\u20132011, and plans to invest \nD14  trillion  ($880  million)  of  equity  in  these  companies.  Investments  by  non-EVN  entities, \nincluding  the  private  sector  (mainly  in  power  generation),  would  complement  EVN\u2019s  direct \ninvestments and investments through joint ventures.  \n\n14. \nAlthough  its  internal  cash  generation  is  projected  to  reach  D152  trillion  ($9.5  billion) \nduring  2006\u20132011,  EVN  will  finance  a  significant  portion  of  the  investments  through  net \nborrowings  totaling  D160  trillion.  This  represents  significantly  more  borrowing  compared  with \n2000\u20132005, when EVN\u2019s net borrowings totaled D48 trillion. In the absence of significant equity \ninjections,  this  investment  plan  will  substantially  increase  EVN\u2019s  debt  and  its  debt  service \nrequirements. The debt-equity ratio would increase from 53:47 in 2005 to 68:32 in 2011, while \nthe debt service requirements would rise from D5.5 trillion to D21 trillion in the same period. As \na result, the DSCR would drop to 1.96 by 2011. This trend reflects EVN\u2019s transition from a lightly \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ngeared  utility  due  to  lack  of  access  to  debt  financing  before  1995  to  a  more  typical  utility  in  a \nfast-growing economy. \n\nD. \n\nFuture Developments \n\nEVN  is  moving  away  from  its  traditional  role  of  generating  its  own  electricity  to  one  in \n15. \nwhich  it  buys  a  considerable  amount  of  electricity  from  third  parties,  and  then  transmits  and \ndistributes it to end users. There is a strong case for splitting EVN into a number of independent \nentities,  such  as  transmission  companies,  distribution  companies,  and  power  stations  (where \nthe  State\u2019s  shares  in  these  entities  are  held  by  a  Holding  Company),  as  a  way  of  increasing \ntransparency in the functioning of the market. The Government has approved a plan for EVN to \nequitize  (i.e.,  partially  privatize)  minority  stakes  in  most  power  generation  plants  and  regional \npower companies. As of July 2007, three power plants, including a 1,000 MW coal power plant, \na  provincial  power  distribution  utility,  and  17  non-core  businesses  had  been  equitized.  The \nliabilities associated with the equitized entities were transferred to the equalized entity, and the \npar  value  was  computed  net  of  the  liabilities.  The  cash  proceeds  from  the  equalization  will \nimprove EVN\u2019s cash flow. However, the debt-equity ratio of EVN as a consolidated entity will not \nbe affected, as EVN intends to retain a majority stake in the equalized entities.  \n\n16. \nAs  a  means  of  attracting  non-EVN  investments  to  the  sector,  EVN  is  planning  to  form \nseveral joint ventures for the construction and operation of some power stations. The liabilities \nof new power plants to be developed as joint ventures between EVN and other parties\u2014where \nEVN is expected to be the majority shareholder\u2014are consolidated in the financial projections. In \nthe case of joint ventures where EVN is the minority shareholder, EVN\u2019s share of the expected \nprofit  from  these  entities  appears  on  its  balance  sheet  as  profit  from  other  activities  in  the \nprojections. \n \nE. \n\nProposed Covenants \n\n17.  With  EVN\u2019s  increasing  indebtedness,  a  maximum  long-term  debt-equity  ratio  of  70:30 \nand a minimum DSCR of 1.5 are proposed as financial covenants to ensure that the company\u2019s \ndebt level and its debt service capacity remain within prudential limits. Although the debt-equity \nratio is increasing steadily and DCSR is decreasing, they remain within these limits during the \nforecast period, except in 2010 when the debt-equity ratio exceeds 70:30. A minimum SFR of \n25%  is  imposed  to  ensure  that  EVN  generates  adequate  cash  flows  to  finance  a  reasonable \nportion  of  the  capital  investments,  thereby  keeping  the  company's  leverage  within  prudential \nlimits.  These  covenants  were  included  in  a  loan  approved  in  2004  and  another  approved  in \n2005  (Footnote  1),  and  EVN  complied  comfortably  with  them.  Whether  EVN  will  comply  with \nloan covenants in 2006 and future years depends largely on future tariff increases and fuel price \nfluctuations.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nProject \n \nLoans

\n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nMANGROVE AND TERRESTRIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN \n\n \n1. \nThe  Project  will  cause  the  loss  of  approximately  41  hectares  (ha)  of  mangrove \necosystems  across  the  project  site,  as  a  result  of  (i)  clearing  during  site  preparation;  or  (ii) \nindirect  adverse  effects  caused  by  changes  to  hydrology,  tidal  regime,  or  water  quality  during \nproject operation. Loss of mangrove vegetation will result in deterioration of biodiversity, water \nquality,  aquatic  nurturing,  and  coastal  protection  values  at  the  project  site.  In  turn,  this  will \ncontribute to the ongoing degradation of mangrove ecosystems in northern Viet Nam. Mangrove \necosystems  in  this  region  already  are  threatened  by  resource  extraction,  as  well  as  land  use \nchange  for  aquaculture,  industrial,  and  infrastructure  uses.  To  offset  the  expected  loss  of \nmangrove  ecosystems,  a  mangrove  management  and  monitoring  plan  (MMMP)  has  been \nprepared, and is included in the environmental impact assessment (EIA). The central feature of \nthe MMMP is the replanting of up to 100 ha of mangrove vegetation in the Bai Tu Long National \nPark,  which  is  approximately  18  kilometers  west  of  the  project  site.  The  park,  which  is  in  the \nsame  bio-geographic  zone  as  the  project  site,  was  selected  as  the  preferred  location  for \nreplanting activities in part because of the security of future land tenure and use. It also offers \nthe  potential  to  involve  the  provincial  Forest  Protection  Department  and  National  Park \nManagement  Board  in  the  replanting  activities.  Thus,  institutional  strengthening  is  provided  to \nthese organizations.   \n \nThe Project will also cause the loss of more than 35 ha of plantation forestry ecosystems \n2. \nacross  the  project  site  as  a  result  of  clearing  during  site  preparation.  These  ecosystems \ncomprise  predominantly  exotic  Acacia  and  Eucalypt  forestry  vegetation,  which  has  high \nsocioeconomic  value  for  households  and  businesses  in  the  project  area,  but  relatively  low \nbiodiversity value. Measures to address losses of plantation forestry ecosystems are contained \nin the resettlement plan and a terrestrial ecology management and monitoring plan. An outline is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix G. The key measures that will be implemented include (i) \nminimization  of  the  project  footprint  during  detailed  design  activities,  (ii)  protection  and \nmonitoring of areas of retained vegetation on site, (iii) compensation for loss of forestry crops, \n(iv) allocation of new areas of forestry land, and (v) livelihood stabilization assistance measures \nfor households affected by forestry losses caused by the Project.  \n \nA. \n\nOutline of Mangrove Monitoring and Management Plan  \n\n3. \n\nThe specific objectives of the MMMP are to \n(i) \n\nidentify  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  the  loss  of  mangrove  vegetation  at  the \nproject site,  \nidentify practical and cost-effective measures to offset residual impacts, and \ndevelop  a  program  of  ongoing  monitoring  to  ensure  the  success  of  mitigation \nmeasures and the condition of mangrove ecosystems.  \n\nMeasures to avoid or  minimize impacts on mangrove  vegetation will be the top  priority \n\n4. \nfor implementation, and will include the following: \n\nminimize  the  project  footprint,  and  confine  construction  activities  to  defined \nareas; \nundertake  dredging  activities  of  cooling  water  intake  and  discharge  channel  to \nmaximize distance from mangrove stands; and \neliminate  the  need  to  install  concrete  lining  in  Mong  Duong  River  diversion \nchannel to encourage natural recolonization of mangroves.  \n\nTo offset residual impacts on mangrove ecosystems, approximately 100 ha of mangrove \n5. \nvegetation will be replanted (representing a 1:2.5 replacement ratio) in the Bai Tu Long National \nPark. Key features of the replanting activities are as follows: \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe replanting activities will aim to replicate, as far as possible, the structure and \ntype of mangrove ecosystems at the replanting sites.  \nA detailed field survey of the replanting sites will be carried out to develop site-\nspecific replanting targets and monitoring parameters. \nA  specialist  mangrove  replanting  contractor  will  carry  out  replanting  activities, \nwith  the  involvement  of  Quang  Ninh  Forest  Protection  Department  and  Bai  Tu \nLong National Park Management Board staff. \nReplanting  techniques  will  be  based  on  practical  expertise  developed  in \nreplanting programs in northern Viet Nam. \nCuttings  of  mangroves  will  be  sourced  from  the  project  site  before  clearing, \nnatural  seedling  collection  at  the  replanting  site,  and/or  an  existing  nursery \noperated by Quang Ninh Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. \nA  qualified  mangrove  ecologist  will  monitor  replanting  success  and  condition \nduring,  and  after  completion  of,  replanting  activities.  The  aim  is  train  National \nPark staff during this time to take over monitoring activities in the long term. \n\n \nB. \n \n6. \n\nTerrestrial Ecology Monitoring and Management Plan Outline \n\nThe objectives of the terrestrial ecology management and monitoring plan are to: \n(i) \n\nidentify  practical  and  cost-effective  mitigation  measures  for  the  impacts  of  the \nProject on terrestrial ecology, other than mangrove ecosystems; and \npropose  a  monitoring  program  to  measure  the  success  of  mitigation  measures \nand the environmental performance of the Project. \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  following  measures  will  be  implemented  to  avoid  or  reduce  impacts  on  terrestrial \n\n \n7. \nvegetation in the project area: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nminimize the footprint of the construction works, as far as practical;  \nmark boundaries of construction worksites with temporary fencing or plastic tape \nor similar; \nensure  construction  activities  are  contained  within  identified  worksites,  and  no \nvegetation is cleared unnecessarily; \nprohibit  construction  and  operation  workers  from  directly  or  indirectly  disturbing \nremaining  terrestrial  vegetation  and  extracting  resources  such  as  firewood,  and \npenalize breaches of this requirement; and \nimplement sediment controls on the project site.  \n\n \n8. \nBecause  of  the  generally  low  biodiversity  value  and  high  socioeconomic  value  of  the \necosystems on the project site, compensation measures will focus on restoration of lost income \nand productivity for households affected by loss of forestry crops.

This  appendix  assesses  the  capability  of  EVN  and  TPPMU1  to  handle  the  proposed \nProject.  \n \n2.  Government-owned  EVN  is  responsible  for  (i)  producing,  transmitting,  and  supplying \nelectricity;  (ii)  designing  and  constructing  relevant  projects;  (iii)  manufacturing  electrical \nequipment; and (iv) providing related services to customers. TPPMU1, which is fully owned by \nEVN, is authorized to manage and organize thermal power plant projects in northern Viet Nam. \nEVN  and  TPPMU1  have  experience  in  implementing  major  projects  funded  by  international \nfunding agencies. Since its inception in 1995, TPPMU1 has managed one large project funded \nby  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  several  other  projects  funded  by  EVN  and \nlocal banks.  \n \nB. \n\nFlow of Funds \n\nto \n\nthese  expenditures.  EVN  will \n\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  EVN  are  the  financiers  of  the  Project.  ADB  will \n3. \nfinance  equipment,  civil  works,  international  and  national  consultants,  contingencies,  interest \nduring construction, and commitment fee. However, ADB will not finance any taxes and duties \nrelated \nlocal  overhead,  project  preparation, \nadministration,  resettlement,  and  all  taxes  and  duties.  Under  the  ADB  loan,  foreign  and  local \nequipment  will  be  paid  directly  to  the  contractors.  For  expenditures  not  covered  by  the  ADB \nloan,  TPPMU1  will  establish  a  separate  bank  account  for  receiving  necessary  fund  transfers \nfrom EVN.  \n \nC. \n\nStaffing and Accounting Policies, Budgeting System, and Payments  \n\nfinance \n\n4. \nTPPMU1  has  about  100  employees,  with  specialists  in  engineering,  environment, \nresettlement, economics, and finance. TPPMU1 reported having sufficient staff to carry out all \nits tasks and meet deadlines. Most of the staff has Vietnamese degrees in accounting, finance, \neconomics,  or  similar  discipline.  Although  no  specific  regular  training  program  exists  for \nTPPMU1 finance staff, most have  been trained to record the transactions in implementing the \nprojects. The Government requires EVN to comply with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards \n(VAS). Accordingly, EVN has adopted, for all its business units, uniform accounting policies and \nprocedures, documentation, and charts of accounts suitable to power sector. The consolidated \naccounts are converted later to International Accounting Standards (IAS). \n \n5. \nEVN and TPPMU1 have proven experience in the efficient management, budgeting, and \nfund disbursement in past projects. Budgets for physical and financial targets were prepared in \nsufficient  detail.  The  project  management  and  accounting  staff  compare  invoice  quantities, \nprices, and terms with those indicated on the purchase order, and with the records of goods and \nservices actually received, and check the accuracy of calculations.  \n \nD. \n\nPolicies and Procedures, Cash and Bank \n\nEVN follows VAS, and has an adequate policy and procedures manual to guide activities \n6. \nand ensure staff accountability. In March 1998, ADB worked with Ministry of Finance (MOF) in \npreparing  a  \u201cManual  on  Project  Accounting  and  Disbursement  Procedures\u201d  for  ADB  financed \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\nprojects. EVN uses this manual, and updates it as necessary in accordance with the changes \nrequired  by  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  procedures  exist  to  ensure  that  only  authorized \npersons of the (MOF) can alter or establish a new accounting principle, policy, or procedure to \nbe used by EVN. \n \n7. \nTPPMU1  uses  EVN\u2019s  new  computerized  finance  system  (developed  with  World  Bank \nfunding) to record all transactions. This is a sophisticated system that allows the input of invoice \ndetails  and  authorizes  payments.  Summary  information  is  transferred  electronically  to  EVN \nheadquarters  monthly.  The  adequacy  of  the  existing  accounting  policies  and  financial \nprocedures has been assessed1 in light of the Vietnamese Accounting System (VAS) and IAS. \nA comparison of major accounting policies between VAS and IAS shows that, for most part, the \nBusiness Accounting Policies promulgated by MOF for all Vietnamese enterprises and adopted \nby EVN conforms with IAS. However, certain policies are still at variance with IAS, particularly: \naccounting for (i) foreign currency and translation; (ii) fixed asset capitalization; (iii) fixed asset \ndepreciable  amount,  rate,  and  method;  (iv)  amortization  of  intangible  assets  and  organization \nexpenses; (v) long-term investment; (vi) reporting requirement; (vii) accounting frameworks; and \n(viii) audit.   \n \n8. \nThe  director  and  the  deputy  director  of  finance  of  TPPMU1  are  the  authorized \nsignatories on the bank accounts. EVN has its own established procedures and mechanisms for \ncollecting money from end users in payment for their electricity bills. The deputy head of finance \nand the appropriate TPPMU1 project manager reconcile the bank statements every month. The \nTPPMU1  director  and  the  finance  director  review  and  approve  all  unusual  items  on  the  bank \nreconciliation. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguard Over Assets and Reporting \n\n9. \nTPPMU1  is  responsible  only  for  implementing  projects;  the  completed  projects  are \nhanded  over  to  another  EVN  entity  to  operate  and  maintain.  EVN  follows  the  Government \nsystem of adequate safeguards to protect assets from fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption. Viet \nNam law expects people who suspect others of participating in corrupt practices to report them \nto  the  \u201cappropriate\u201d  authorities.  Measures  taken  include  the  issue  of  the  Anti-corruption \nOrdinance dated 26 February 1998. Solutions for preventing, detecting, and enforcing penalties \nfor corruption are also included. This ordinance\u2014coupled with the strictness of law enforcement \nagencies  in  recent  corruption  cases\u2014has  restored  some  confidence  in  the  law  and  justice \nsystems regarding anticorruption measures. The director of TPPMU1 must approve all additions \nor amendments to TPPMU1\u2019s payroll.  \n \n10. \nEVN  and  TPPMU1  are  able  to  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project.  TPPMU1, \nthrough  EVN,  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB. 2 The  reports  should  provide  a \nnarrative of (i) progress made during the quarter, (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, \n(iii) problems or difficulties encountered, and (iv) the work to be carried out in the next period. \nTPPMU1  should  be  able  to  prepare  these  financial  reports  automatically  from  their  finance \nsystem,  though  some  assistance  probably  will  be  required  initially  to  ensure  the  reports  are \nproviding the necessary information, and that all the information balances. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   World  Bank.  1997.  Project  Appraisal  Document  for  Viet  Nam:  Transmission,  Distribution,  and  Disaster \n\nReconstruction Project. Washington, DC. \n\n2   EVN\u2019s  progress  reports  for  previous  projects  have  been  submitted  on  time,  and  the  quality  of  these  reports  was \n\nadequate. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  quarterly  reports,  within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year, \n11. \nTPPMU1 should submit to ADB its annual audited accounts of EVN and annual audited financial \nstatements of the Project. The annual financial statements will be a consolidated for all EVN\u2019s \noperations.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  and  operation  of  the  Project  based  on  these \nreports,  and  will  meet  with  EVN,  TPPMU1,  and  the  Government  annually  to  discuss  project \nprogress.  A  project  completion  report  (PCR)  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  3  months  of \nproject completion.  \n \nF. \n\nInternal Audit and External Audit \n\n12. \nIndependent  auditors  audit  the  financial  statements  of  EVN  and  TPPMU1  annually. \nSince  1999,  their  audits  have  not  been  delayed.  The  audit  of  EVN  was  conducted  mostly  in \naccordance with the International Standards on Auditing for public institutions.  \n \n13. \nDuring  2001,  EVN  discovered  that  certain  costs  were  included  improperly  as  part  of \nconstruction  in  progress  as  of  31  December  2000.  This  led  to  a  restatement  of  financial \nstatements for 2000. In 2002, EVN revalued some of its power station assets, which increased \ntheir value by about D3,000 billion. The external auditors noted that this revaluation violated IAS \nprinciples,  because  any  revaluation  should  be  applied  to  the  whole  class  of  assets,  not  just  a \nsubset.  Otherwise,  the auditors  have  not  made  any  significant  qualification  to  EVN\u2019s  accounts \nduring  the  past  5  years.  According  to  the  external  auditors,  EVN  and  all  of  its  units  generally \nkeep  their  accounts  properly,  consistent  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  laws  and  regulations.  Further,  the \nauditors  commented  that  the  units  of  EVN  have  improved  how  quickly  they  produce  their \naccounts  over  the  last  few  years.  In  addition,  the  auditors  reported  that  fewer  management \nletters  have  noted  improved  procedures  in  recent  years  with  fewer  significant  internal  control \nissues identified, while the number of qualified audit opinions has declined.  \n \n14. \nIn  March  1998,  EVN  established  its  Internal  Audit  Department,  which  is  headed  by  a \nchief  of  internal  audit  and  supported  by  five  professional  accountants.  EVN  relies  heavily  on \ndirect  supervision,  detailed  reporting,  and  authorization  from  top  management  for  internal \ncontrol.  This  internal  audit  ensures  proper  checks  and  balances,  and  delineation  of \nresponsibilities. Internal reviews are conducted as follows: (i) the Inspection Department, with a \nteam  of  selected  representatives  from  the  various  business  units,  conducts  inspections  on \ncompliance with EVN policies and Government rules and regulations; (ii) an ad hoc inspection \nteam  selected  by  the  director  general  conducts  inspections  for  certain  activities  of  business \nunits;  (iii)  the  Finance  and  Accounting  Department  team  handles  accounting  supervision;  and \n(iv)  the  Management  Board  and  the  Control  Section  of  the  Board  carry  out  inspections. \nInspections are conducted based on Government guidelines, and focus on the reviews of plans, \nexpenditures,  contracts,  and  compliance.  TPPMU1  has  not  been  subject  to  an  internal  audit \nreport. \n \n15. \nThe  consolidated  financial  accounts  of  EVN  are  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of  Industry, \nMOF,  and  Tax  Department  for  review  and  approval.  MOF  audits  are  used  to  determine  tax \nliabilities,  scheduled  payments  of  \u201cstate-rented\u201d  capital,  and  other  financial  matters.  MOF\u2019s \nrevision committee has the right to audit any part of EVN, though TPPMU1 has not been subject \nto such an audit. EVN prepared financial statements of its previous projects in accordance with \nVAS.  The  TPPMU1  system  prepares  simple  financial  statements  monthly,  and  this  reporting \nshould  be  adopted  to  report  on  this  Project.  Although  trying  to  link  physical  progress  with \nfinancial progress could be useful in predicting estimated completion date and total cost, this is \nnot  really  necessary.  Most  contracts  by  TPPMU1  are  fixed-cost  contracts,  which  pay  a \ncontractor a predetermined amount when it completes a specific amount of physical work.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n41 \n\nFinancial  reports  clearly  compare \n\n \n16. \nthe  actual  expenditures  with  budgeted  and \nprogrammed  allocations.  Automated  accounting  systems  prepare  the  financial  reports  using \nspreadsheets  and  other  computerized  programs.  Under  the  current  accounting  system,  all \nEVN\u2019s  dependent  units,  including  TPPMU1,  prepare  and  submit  monthly  accounting,  financial \nstatements,  and  other  financial  reports  to  EVN.  However,  independent  accounting  units  only \nsubmit  their  reports  quarterly.  EVN\u2019s  Accounting  Department  reviews  the  reports  before \nsubmission to EVN\u2019s Management Board for consolidation.  \n \n17. \nThe  computerized  accounting  system  EVN  is  using  is  still  being  evaluated,  and \nimprovements  are  being  introduced as  necessary.  Financial statements prepared  by  TPPMU1 \nfocus on maintaining separate records and accounts adequately. It could identify (i) goods and \nservices  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan,  (ii)  other  financing  resources  received,  (iii) \nexpenditures incurred in the Project, (iv) audit of resettlement expenditures, and (v) uses of local \nfunds. TPPMU1 has used the computerized financial management system, which can produce \nthe necessary project financial reports. EVN\u2019s and TPPMU1\u2019s finance and account staffs have \nbeen  trained  adequately  to  maintain  the  systems.  The  management  organization  and \nprocessing system has safeguarded the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.  \n \n18. \nEVN  will  need  to  prepare  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  annual  project \naudit. The auditing company should inspect and substantiate the accuracy and sustainability of \naccounting documents and figures, as well as other accounting finalization reports kept by EVN \nand TPPMU1. \n\n \n\nG. \n\nConclusion and Recommendations \n\n19. \nIn  general,  TPPMU1  appears  to  be  a  fit  and  proper  body  to  administer  the  proposed \nADB  loan  for  the  Mong  Duong I  Project.  While  the  assessment  identified  no  significant  weak \npoints,  two  minor  points  were  identified.  First,  although  the  computer  system  is  backed  up \nregularly, the backups themselves are stored on TPPMU1\u2019s premises, rather than on a remote \nsite. Second, as TPPMU1 has no specific experience administering an ADB loan, the staff will \nrequire training in ADB procedures. However, they should have little difficulty in understanding \nand implementing these. If somebody from another EVN project management board with ADB \nloan  experience  (e.g.,  Northern  Power  Project  Management  Board)  could  share  the  details  of \nadministering the loan, it would be useful. \n \n\n \n\n\f4\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \nTable A8.1: Multitranche Financing Facility Loan 1 \n\n  \n Item \nA.

During  2000\u20132005, \naverage  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  was  7.3%\u2014with  growth  each  year \nexceeding  the  preceding  one.  In  2006,  GDP  growth  was  8.2%.  Industry  and  services,  which \ntogether  accounted  for nearly  80% of  GDP,  was  the  main driver  of  economic  growth.  Industry \nexpanded  by  10.3%  and  services  by  7.5%,  while  the  agriculture  sector  grew  at  3.3%.  The \naverage  annual  economic  growth  for  2006\u20132010  is  expected  to  be  about  8.5%,  with  industry \nexpanding  at  11.0%  and  services  at  8.0%.  To  increase  competitiveness  and  maintain  GDP \ngrowth of 8.5%, Viet Nam needs to maintain an investment level of more than 35% of GDP for \nthe  next  10  years,  to  develop  necessary  physical  infrastructure,  including  infrastructure  in  the \nenergy  sector  and  power  subsector.  Demand  for  electricity  is  projected  to  grow.  Maintaining \nadequate  investments  to  meet  this  rapid  growth  in  demand  is  a  formidable  task.  According  to \nthe 6th Power Development Master Plan (PDMP),1 the power sector requires an estimated $24.2 \nbillion  in  investments  for  2006\u20132010\u2014$17.1  billion  for  generation,  and  $7.1  billion  for  the \ntransmission and distribution network. \n \nB. \n\nDemand Analysis \n\nThe  average  annual  growth  rate  of  electricity  consumption  during  1990\u20132003  was \n2. \n14.2%.  Average  annual  growth  rate  from  2000  to  2005  was  15.2%.  Electricity  demand  will \ncontinue  to  grow  at  this  high  rate  to  support  economic  expansion.  The  6th  PDMP  provides  a \nprojection of electricity demand for 2006\u20132025. Table A10.1 contains the main indicators of the \ndemand projection of the 6th PDMP.  \n \n\nTable A10.1: Main Indicators of the Viet Nam Demand Forecast (2005\u20132025) \n\n2025 \nItem \n381,160 \nAnnual demand (GWh) \n8.2% \n5-year growth rate (%) \n3,703 \nPer capita consumption (kWh) \n11.7 \nT&D losses and own-use (%) \nPeak load (MW) \n71,416 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MW = megawatt, T&D = transmission and distribution. \nSource: Institute of Energy, 2006, 6th PDMP, Hanoi. \n\n2020 \n257,260 \n9.3% \n2,629 \n12.5 \n48,642 \n\n2015 \n164,960 \n11.2% \n1,774 \n13.2 \n32,196 \n\n2010 \n97,110 \n16.3% \n1,106 \n13.8 \n19,553 \n\n2005 \n45,600 \n \n549 \n14.7 \n9,512 \n\n \nAs seen in Table A10.1, electricity demand will grow at 16.3% per year until 2010, and \n3. \n11.2%  thereafter  until  2015.  The  demand  growth  is  driven  by  (i)  rapid,  broad-based  growth  in \nindustrial and commercial sectors; (ii) increase in electrification from less than 40% in 1990 to \nmore  than  88%  in  2005;  (iii)  urbanization;  and  (iv)  higher  living  standards,  with  domestic \ndemand  growing  at  19%.  The  demand  for  electricity  and  the  corresponding  peak  load  are \nexpected to reach 97.11 terrawatt-hours (TWh) and 19,553 MW, respectively, in 2010; and 165 \nTWh  and  32,200  MW,  respectively,  in  2015.  This  compares  with  a  demand  of  39.7  TWh  and \npeak load of 8,400 MW in 2004. System losses would be reduced from 14.7% in 2004 to 13.8% \nin 2010 and 12.3 % in 2015, while the load factor will improve from 65.7% in 2004 to 68.4% in \n2010 and 69.1% in 2015. \n\n                                                 \n1   The 6th PDMP has been approved by the Prime Minister on 16 July 2007.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n50 \n \n\nC. \n\nLeast-Cost System Expansion Plan of the Viet Nam Power Sector \n\n1. \n\nExisting Generating System \n\n4. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  electricity  system  is  a  well-developed,  unified  system  with  a  backbone  of \n1,700 kilometer (km) of high-voltage (500 kilovolt [kV]) lines connecting all load and generation \ncenters. At the end of 2005, installed generating capacity of the Viet Nam power system totaled \n11,386 MW. The breakdown of this capacity by fuel type is given in Table A10.2. This capacity \nis  provided  by  Viet  Nam  Electricity  (EVN)  power  plants  and  those  outside  EVN  (non-EVN \nplants). Non-EVN capacity accounts for 22.7 % of the total system capacity (Table A10.2). Non-\nEVN power plants, in turn, consist of independent power producers (IPP), build-operate-transfer \n(BOT) plants, and power plants owned by other enterprises in Viet Nam (e.g., Vinacomine and \nPetro Viet Nam). \n \n\nTable A10.2: Installed Capacity and Share by Fuel Type (End of 2005) \n\nType of Capacity \nHydro \nCoal \nOil \nGas \nDiesel \nTotal \nEVN = Viet Nam Electricity, MW = megawatt. \nSource: EVN and Institute of Energy. \n\nNon-EVN \n150 \n210 \n389 \n1,841 \n \n2,590 \n\nEVN \n4,069 \n1,245 \n200 \n3,037 \n245 \n8,796 \n\nTotal (MW) \n4,219 \n1,455 \n589 \n4,878 \n245 \n11,386 \n\nShare of Total \n37.1% \n12.8% \n5.2% \n42.8% \n2.2% \n100.0% \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOptions for Expansion of the Generating System \n\n5. \nThe options for future development of the power system, without looking at other system \nconstraints  and  investment  requirements,  are  derived  from  the  following  considerations:  (i) \navailability of domestic fuel supply, (ii) availability of domestic renewable energy resources, (iii) \npossibility of importing fuels, and (iv) power trade (import or export) with neighboring countries. \nViet  Nam  has  considerable  domestic  energy  resources  for  power  generation,  including \nhydropower,  coal,  natural  gas  and  oil,  and  some  potential  of  renewable  energy  sources.  The \nhydro potential in Viet Nam is estimated at 308 TWh per year, with a capacity of 70,000 MW. \nThe economic potential is estimated at 120 TWh per year, with a capacity of 30,000 MW. Taking \ninto account the environment and social criteria, the feasible hydropower potential is estimated \nto be 20,750 MW, or 83 TWh per year\u2019s production.  \n \n6. \nThermal  generating  capacity  in  the  future  will  rely  on  coal  and  natural  gas.  Plans  also \nare being made to use imported coal for new thermal power generation after 2012, and nuclear \npower generation starting in 2020 (4,000 MW). Coal is available in Quang Ninh Province in the \nnorth,  which  makes  the  development  of  medium-to-large  coal-fired  power  plants  in  the  north \npossible.  Plants  under  construction  are  in  Quang  Ninh,  Cam  Pha,  Hai  Phong,  Ninh  Binh,  and \nUong Bi. The Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power Project is one of the coal power complexes to be \ndeveloped  in  the  north  by  2011.  Coal  power  stations  also  are  being  built  in  central  Viet  Nam, \nsuch  as  the  Nghi  Son  and  Vung  Anh  power  plants.  Offshore  natural  gas  has  been  used  for \nelectricity  generation  in  the  south,  close  to  the  gas  production  sites.  In  the  future,  candidates \nunder  consideration  include  power  stations  in  O  Mon  power  complex  and  expansion  of  the \nexisting Phi My power plants.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\n3. \n\nSystem Planning Methodology \n\n7. \nSystem  planning  is  formulated  based  on  the  set  of  candidate  plants,  taking  into \nconsideration  constraints  that  reflect  the  fuel  availability  and  system  reliability  criteria  (power \nplant outage, maintenance requirement, transmission line reliability rule, etc.). Two gas supply \npossibilities were considered: 14 billion cubic meters and 10 billion cubic meters per year during \n2020\u20132025. The two most important reliability criteria are (i) the loss of load expectation (LOLE) \ncriteria applied to the whole generation system, and (ii) the rule n-1 applied to the transmission \ncapability.  The  LOLE  criterion  stipulates  that  the  expected  loss  of  load  should  not  exceed  24 \nhours per year, expressed in hours LOLE < 24 per year. The n-1 rule takes care of the situation \nwhen one circuit of the double-circuit 500 kV line is not functioning, while the remaining system \nwill still work stably. \n \n8. \nSystem  optimization  was  carried  out  using  software  based  on  dynamic  programming \noptimization  to  find  out  the  expansion  plan  with  lowest  total  discounted  costs.  Apart  from \ndemand  data,  other  important  inputs  for  optimization  are  (i)  technical  and  financial  economic \ndata  of  all  generation  sources,  fuel  types,  fuel  price,  investment  cost,  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  cost,  efficiency,  load  factor,  failure  frequences,  etc.;  (ii)  investment  cost, \nvoltage,  length,  O&M  cost,  losses, failure  frequences,  etc.,  for  transmission  lines; and  (iii)  fuel \nsupply availability or limitation, and fuel costs. Investment costs of generation and transmission \ncandidates are taken from prefeasibility studies, if available, or estimated based on international \nand  national  experiences.  Fuel  costs  are  forecasted  taking  into  account  international \nprojections.  O&M  costs  are  based  on  the  domestic  and  international  practices.  The  costs  are \neconomic costs without provision for taxes. Environmental costs are not included. \n \n\n4. \n\nLeast-Cost Expansion Generation Plan Up to 2025 \n\n9. \nThe  optimization  of  the  system  expansion  results  in  an  optimal  schedule  of  new \ncapacities to be added to the system for 2005\u20132025. The optimal expansion plan includes two \nstages  of  Mong  Duong  power  complex.  Stage  1  consists  of  two  units  of  500  MW  to  be \ncommissioned  in  2011  and  2012,  respectively.

The \ncomparison takes into account the costs and benefits to the society of these two scenarios.  \n \nCosts.  The  costs  to  the  society  are  the  investment  and  the  operating  costs  of  the \n11. \nProject,  as  well  as  environmental  mitigating  costs.  Investment  costs,  in  turn,  can  be  broken \ndown  into  (i)  equipment  costs;  (ii)  construction  costs;  and  (iii)  engineering,  administrative,  and \nmanagement costs related to the construction of the power plant. A significant part of operating \ncosts include fuel costs (e.g., coal), and costs of limestone used in the circulating fluidized bed \n(CFB)  boiler.  The  total  costs  considered  also  include  physical  contingencies,  but  exclude \ninterest during the construction and price contingency. \n\nTable A10.4: Investment Costs of Mong Duong 1 in Economic Terms \n\nItem \n  \n\nCost of construction \n\nCost of equipment \n\nAdministration and other costs \n\nPhysical contingency \n\nEnvironmental costs \n\nCost \n($ million) \n\nSERF \n\nShadow Value \n($  million) \n\n251.7 \n\n508.1 \n\n30.9 \n\n79.5 \n\n0.3 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.0 \n\n251.7 \n\n558.9 \n\n30.9 \n\n87.5 \n\n0.3 \n\n3.6 \n932.9 \n\nResettlement and land acquisition \nTotal Investment Without IDC \nIDC = interest during construction, SERF = shadow exchange rate factor. \nSource: Based on Viet Nam Electricity\u2019s project cost estimates.  \n\n3.6 \n874.1 \n\n1.0 \n  \n\n \n12. \nIn this analysis, a domestic price numeraire is used.

Results of the \"with Mong Duong 1\u201d scenario simulation show that the system \ndispatches about 6,400 gigawatt-hours (GWh) from the plant every year. In the \"without Mong \nDuong  1\u201d  scenario,  LOLE  increases  substantially,  especially  for  the  northern  and  southern \nregions.  This  reflects  the  severe  worsening  of system  reliability  without  Mong  Duong  1.  Given \nthe national standard of less than 24 hours outage per year, the northern system will experience \nsevere  difficulty  in  meeting  reliability  standards  starting  2014,  when  the  LOLE  will  exceed  the \nstandard  by  two  to  three  times.  More  importantly,  since  the  system  is  integrated,  the  lack  of \ncapacity  in  the  north  also  leads  to  a  large  increase  of  LOLE  in  the  south  over  the  simulation \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2003.

Power shortages in the north and south are likely to cause an economic slowdown, as \nindustrial and commercial businesses are concentrated in these regions. \n \n14. \nThe  increase  of  the  LOLE  between  the  \"with\"  and  \"without\"  scenarios  is  a  measure  of \nexpected  energy  not  served  had  the  same  value  of  LOLE  been  used  in  both  scenarios. \nIncreased  production  by  thermal  power  plants  in  the  northern  and  southern  regions  will  cover \npart  of  the  shortage  without  Mong  Duong  1.  The  economic  value  of  electricity  generated  by \nMong Duong 1 is measured by the costs to the society of not having it. This cost comprises the \ncosts of suboptimal operation of thermal power plants to partly replace Mong Duong 1, and the \ncosts to the consumers (industrial, residential, commercial) due to energy not served. In other \nwords, the societal benefits of having Mong Duong 1 is the sum of two components: (i) the non-\nincremental benefits accrued by not having to run thermal power plants at suboptimum, thereby \nproducing  savings;  and  (ii)  the  incremental  benefits  accrued  to  the  consumers  by  having  a \nsufficient power supply.  \n \n15. \nNon-Incremental Benefits. The extra generation by power plants in the northern region \nwill be coal-based, whereas in the south it will be gas-based. The average costs are $0.043 per \nkWh for coal and $0.053 per kWh for gas. These production costs are used to value the benefits \nof MD 1\u2014i.e., non-incremental benefits from the avoided costs of running thermal power plants \noutside their optimal regime. \n \nIncremental  Benefits.  Since  thermal  power  plants  cannot  cover  the  anticipated \n16. \nelectricity shortage in the \"without Mong Duong 1\u201d scenario, consumers will experience power \nshortages. This represents the incremental value of the benefits of having Mong Duong 1. In the \n\u201cwithout\u201d  scenario,  lack  of  electricity  supply  means  additional  cost,  but  these  costs  will  differ \namong consumer categories. Household consumers likely will have to curtail their consumption, \nwhile  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  will  use  alternative  generating  sources  to  replace \nthe  shortage  of  electricity.  The  cost  to  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  is  the  cost  of \nalternative  generation.  According  to  experts  at  the  Institute  of  Energy,  the  most  popular \nreplacement for grid electricity is the stand-alone diesel generator, with capacity of 150 kilowatt \n(kW) to 5 MW. The levelized4 cost of diesel generation is $0.15/kWh. Table A10.5 summarizes \nthe  results  of  the  benefits  calculation.  It  contains  the  economic  value  of  Mong  Duong  1 \nelectricity from the consumer perspective. The net present value (NPV) of the benefits amounts \nto $918.7 million, while the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of Mong Duong 1 is 23.9%. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   To quantify the unitary cost of electricity (in kilowatt-hour) generated during the lifetime of a diesel power plant and \nto compare this with the cost of other alternative technologies (coal power plant, gas fired power plant, fuel oil fired \npower plant, hydropower plants, etc.).  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n54 \n \n\nTable A10.5: Economic Benefits of Mong Duong 1 Valued by Consumer Categories  \n($ million)  \n\nAvoided Costs of \nThermal Power  \n\nYear \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n\n287.70 \n280.84 \n285.62 \n291.71 \n256.77 \n264.46 \n277.01 \n270.04 \n265.62 \n264.32 \n263.55 \n272.96 \n252.27 \n243.35 \n277.13 \n\nBenefits to \nHousehold \nConsumers \n26.95 \n35.90 \n26.01 \n27.99 \n75.19 \n64.04 \n64.03 \n63.72 \n63.29 \n62.27 \n69.79 \n55.39 \n62.10 \n64.39 \n57.23 \n\nBenefits to \nIndustrial \nConsumers \n30.44 \n40.56 \n29.39 \n31.62 \n84.95 \n72.34 \n72.34 \n71.98 \n71.50 \n70.34 \n78.84 \n62.58 \n70.15 \n72.74 \n64.65 \n\nBenefits to \nCommercial \nConsumers \n15.22 \n20.28 \n14.69 \n15.81 \n42.47 \n36.17 \n36.17 \n35.99 \n35.75 \n35.17 \n39.42 \n31.29 \n35.08 \n36.37 \n32.33 \n\nTotal \nBenefits \n\n360.30 \n377.58 \n355.71 \n367.13 \n459.38 \n437.01 \n449.55 \n441.73 \n436.16 \n432.09 \n451.61 \n422.22 \n419.60 \n416.84 \n431.33 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nE. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  NPV  and  EIRR  to  the  main  input  parameters  has  been  analyzed \n17. \nusing  the  @RISK  program.  The  main  input  parameters  for  the  sensitivity  analysis  include  (i) \ngeneration level of Mong Duong 1; (ii) capital investment costs; and (ii) values that household, \nindustrial,  and  commercial  consumers  attach  to  the  unserved  electricity.  Among  these  factors, \ntotal project cost plays an important role in the possible variation of cost components. As such, \nits  influence  on  the  total  cost  was  analyzed  first.  The  total  project  cost  was  broken  down  into \nequipment cost (54.2%), labor cost (16.5%), and cost of materials for construction (13.7%). The \nbalance  is  made  up  by  contingencies,  and  environmental  and  social  costs.  According  to  the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment,5 the consumer price index (CPI) in Viet Nam increased an \naverage  of  4.7%  per  year  during  2000\u20132005.  The  price  of  construction  materials  increased \nmore  quickly  than  other  commodities.  While  energy  prices,  including  coal,  oil  products,  and \nelectricity, are still regulated by the Government, they have increased slightly. Labor cost in Viet \nNam is low and has not increased much.  \n \n18. \nInternational  and  national  experiences  suggest  that,  of  the  three  main  cost  categories, \nthe cost of construction materials is most likely to increase. Equipment costs are also likely to \nincrease, although not as much as construction materials. Labor costs will vary, and could rise \nas much as 5% (slightly higher than last 5-year average CPI). The impacts of the variation of the \ncost components on the total costs were investigated using Monte Carlo simulation method. A \ntotal  of  500  combinations  were  simulated  taking  into  account  the  ranges  of  labor  costs  (\u20133%, \n+5%), equipment costs (\u20133%, +10%), and construction material costs (\u20135%, +25%). The results \nindicate that the total project cost is most sensitive to the equipment costs, due to its large share \nin  the  total  cost  structure,  followed  by  the  cost  of  construction  materials,  and  then  labor.  The \nrelative sensitivity indexes are 0.58 for equipment cost, 0.18 for material cost, and 0.15 for labor \ncost.  This  implies  that  for  every  1%  increase  in  equipment  cost,  the  total  project  cost  would \n\n                                                 \n5 Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2005.

Similarly, every 1% change in the costs of materials would cause a 0.18% \nchange  in  the  project  total  cost.  All  costs  are  economic  costs,  with  proper  adjustment  using \nSERF to local costs. The resulting expected total cost is $905 million, with a standard deviation \nof $12.7 million, and minimum possible value of $870 million and maximum of $954 million. This \nresult  then  is  plugged  into  another  round  of  @RISK  simulation  to  determine  the  project \nrobustness  for  all  inputs.  Regarding  the  project  generation  level,  the  simulation  of  the  whole \nsystem by the Institute of Energy demonstrated that the generation level varies between 6,064 \nGWh  per  year  and  6,696  GWh  per  year.  These  boundary  values  also  are  used  for  @RISK \nsimulation.  For  the  willingness  to  pay  of  consumers  categories,  it  is  assumed  that  they  would \nvary  within  the  -/+10%  boundary.  In  summary,  the  ranges  of  the  input  parameters  that  were \nused for the Monte Carlo simulation are in Table A10.6. \n \n\nTable A10.6: Range of Values of Key Input Parameters for Sensitivity Analysis \n\nParameter \nGenerationa (GWh) \nTotal costsb ($ million) \nNon-HH_WTP   \n($/kWh) \n\nHH_WTP ($/kWh) \n\nLow \n\nBase \n\n6,064.0 \n870.0 \n0.130 \n(-10%) \n0.115 \n(-10%) \n\n6,400.0 \n933.0 \n\n0.145 \n\n0.128 \n\nHigh \n\n6,696.0 \n954.0 \n0.160 \n(+10%) \n0.141 \n(+10%) \n\nGWh = gigawatt-hours, HH = households, kWh = kilowatt-hour, WTP = willingness to pay. \na  Generation variation according to Institute of Energy simulation of the whole Viet Nam system. \nb  Cost variation is a result of component analysis. \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation using @RISK and estimates. \n\n \n19. \nThe  input  data  given  in  Table  A10.6  were  plugged  into  @RISK  to  simulate  possible \ndistribution of EIRR and NPV of the Project as dependent on these four important inputs.

The  analysis  also  found  that  only  under  extreme  circumstances\u2014e.g.,  cost \noverrun  of  more  than  200%,  or  a  combination  of  reductions  of  willingness  to  pay  (WTP)  of  all \nconsumers by 50 %\u2014would the Project become economically unfeasible. \n \n\nTable A10.7: Result of Sensitivity Analysis of EIRR and NPV  \n(2,000 random Monte Carlo simulations) \n\nNPV \n\nEIRR \n\n Item \n 24.36% \nExpected value \n0.35% \nStandard deviation \n 23.15% \nMinimum \n 25.61% \nMaximum \n0.012 \nCoefficient of variation \nProbability of negative outcome \n0.0% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation using @RISK. \n\n$ 936.3 \n$ 21.9 \n$858.0 \n$1,017.0 \n0.029\n0.0%\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nFigure A10.1: Cumulative Distribution of EIRR \n \n\n21.00% \n\n21.50% \n\n22.00% \n\n22.50% \n\n23.00% \n\n23.50% \n\n \nFigure A10.2: Cumulative Distribution of EIRR \n\n23.00% \n\n23.50% \n\n24.00%\n\n24.50%\n\n25.00%\n\n25.50% \n\n26.00%\n\n \n20.  Moreover,  the  analysis  shows  that  project  cost  is  the  most  critical  parameter,  with  a \nrelative  sensitivity  index  of  0.75  (i.e.,  a  1%  increase  in  project  cost  would  result  in  0.75% \nreduction  in  EIRR).  The  sensitivity  indexes  for  the  other  three  inputs  are  0.52  for  generation \nlevel, 0.20 for non-household value, and 0.12 for household value of electricity. This implies that \nfor  every  1%  change  in  these  input  variables,  the  resulting  EIRR  would  change  by  0.52%, \n0.20%,  and  0.12%,  respectively.

The  analysis  was  based  on  the  ADB  ordinary  capital \nresources (OCR) assessment paper, prepared for the 2007\u20132010 country strategy and program, \nas  well  as  on  the  calculation  of  the  flow  of  foreign  exchange  from  the  Mong  Duong  1  project. \nThis analysis shows that the Mong Duong 1 investment does not alter the debt sustainability of \nthe  country  in  the  medium  to  long  term,  because  the  disbursement  of  the  loan  is  within  the \nannual  OCR  limit.  Further,  since  more  than  70%  of  ADB  loan  will  be  awarded  under  an \nengineering, procurement, and construction contract, the Project will not have significant effects \non supply or consumer sectors, and thus does not suggest excessive domestic inflation. Finally, \nMong  Duong  1  will  generate  sufficient  revenue  to  repay  its  associated  loans.  The  detailed \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nF. \n\nConclusion6 \n\n21. \nThis  analysis  demonstrates  that  the  demand  for  electricity  between  2005  and  2025  is \nexpected  to  grow  quickly,  especially  in  the  northern  region  where  Mong  Duong  1  is  to  be \nconstructed.  The  analysis  also  shows  that  Mong  Duong  1  is  part  of  a  vigorously  planned \nschedule of capacity addition. Mong Duong 1 is scheduled to be added to the grid in 2011. The \neconomic robustness of Mong Duong 1 has been confirmed by economic valuation of costs and \nbenefits of the Project, with extensive sensitivity analysis. The Project yields an expected EIRR \nof  22.5%  and  corresponding  NPV  of  $846.6  million  over  the  project  life  of  30  years  (the  base \nvalues of EIRR and NPV are 23.5% and $888 million, respectively). \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6   This is a short version of the economic analysis.

The  project \ncost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real  terms  by \nremoving the effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n2. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  calculated  over  30  years  (5-year \nconstruction  period  plus  25  years  of  operations)  on  an  after-tax  basis.  The  plant  output  is \nestimated to be 6,000 gigawatt-hour (GWh) at a plant factor of 68% and a self-consumption of \n9%.  The  energy  output  is  valued  at  $0.041  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  based  on  the  prevailing \nprices for power procured from independent power producers (IPP).  \n \n3. \nThe  project  is  assumed  to  purchase  coal  at  $26  per  ton  at  the  time  of  commissioning \n(2012).  Coal  prices  are  expected  to  increase  to  $40  per  ton  in  real  terms  (excluding  price \nincrease due to inflation) as the price distortions in the domestic market gradually are removed, \ncoal prices net of inflation increase due to resource constraints.

A resettlement framework (RF) has been prepared \nto cover the proposed reservoir, which EVN recently identified and for which no technical design \nis available. The RF sets out the resettlement policy, and screening and planning procedures.   \n \nB. \n \nLand  acquisition  requirements  have  been  minimized  by  locating  the  Mong  Duong  1 \n2. \nThermal Power Plant on a site at the mouth of the Mong Duong River. The area is being used \nfor coal transport and storage, and has been modified heavily from its natural state with earth \nmoving, areas of fill, and changes to waterways and hydrological conditions. The project area is \nalso generally hilly and forest-covered.  \n \n3. \nBased on the census, inventory of losses, and socioeconomic surveys, the RP estimates \nthat the Project will require the permanent acquisition of about 168 hectares (ha) of land. Most \nof the affected area is forestry land (83 ha), fish ponds (61 ha), and industrial land (20 ha). The \nresettlement  planning  and  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA) 1  identified  the  following \nresettlement impacts:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n37 households (118 people) will be affected, of which 32 (96 people) will be required \nto relocate, and five will be marginally affected and able to remain on the same plot \nof land; \neight  coal  transportation  companies  and  one  forestry  company  will  be  required  to \nmove;  \none construction company will be partially affected; \nfour large farm owners (timber, fishpond, and fruit trees) will be severely affected as \nalmost all their land will be acquired; and  \nemployees  of  farm  owners  (80)  and  companies  (306)  might  lose  their  jobs \ntemporarily  during  the  transition  period  when  the  companies  reorganize  their \nactivities,  or  permanently  if  their  employers  cannot  find  replacement  land  and  are \nunable to retain them. \n\n \nIn addition, the Project might affect fisherfolk. Based on the EIA Report, the construction \n4. \nphase will adversely affect 13 fishing households and one aquaculture company in Mong Duong \nRiver (Mong Duong Ward), as all fish and other aquatic habitat will be destroyed in the delta of \nthe  Mong  Duong  River  due  to  river  diversion.  The  affected  households  include  five  that  rely \ncompletely  and  eight  that  rely  partially  on  fisheries  for  their  livelihood.  The  natural  aquatic \necosystem  of  the  river  is  expected  to  take  about  2  years  to  be  restored  in  the  new  realigned \nmouth  of  the  river.  During  the  operation  phase,  particularly  in  the  discharge  channel,  an \nincrease  in  the  temperature  due  to  the  thermal  effluent  will  alter the  ecosystem  and  biological \nproductivity  of  the  De  Dach  estuary  and  near  the  ocean  outfall  at  Cam  Hai  commune.  The \nimpacts on fisheries, decline of fish captures (including sand worms), loss of income, etc., can \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006, Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Mong Duong Thermal Power Generation. \n\nManila (TA 4670-VIE, Marine Aquatic Resources Study, part of Environmental Impact Assessment Study).   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nbe assessed only during operation through a monitoring program. A rapid response mechanism \nwill be established.2 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework  \n\nThe  policy  framework  and  entitlements  of  the  Project  have  been  based  on  a  variety  of \n 5. \nViet Nam\u2019s laws and ADB\u2019s policies. The relevant Government laws are principally (i) the 1993 \nLand Law, amended in 1998, 2001, and 2003; (ii) Decree 197/CP (2004), modified in 2006, on \nCompensation, Support and Resettlement when land is recovered by the state; and (iii) Circular \n116  (2004)  on  guiding  the  implementation  of  Decree  197.  The  framework  is  rooted  in  ADB\u2019s \npolicies  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  Gender  and \nDevelopment  (1998),  Accountability  (2003),  and  Public  Communications  (2005).  With  the \npromulgation of Decree 197/CP (2004) and Decree 17/2006, the Government\u2019s policy and legal \nframework  towards  resettlement  moved  much  closer  to  the  principles  underpinning  ADB\u2019s \npolicies.  However,  in  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Government\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and \nprocedures and ADB's policies and requirements, ADB's policies and requirements will prevail.  \nThis is also in accordance with Decree 17/2001, which stipulates that for Official Development \nAssistance-financed projects, funding agencies\u2019 policies apply. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe  Project  entitlements  were  designed  to  cover  compensation,  resettlement,  and \nrehabilitation  for  all  losses  to  restore  or  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  all  affected  persons.  \nSeverely affected persons, as well as the poor and vulnerable, will be provided with livelihood \nstabilization assistance and income-restoration programs.   \n\nProject Entitlements \n\nImpacts \nPermanent Acquisition \nof Land and Fishponds \n\nStructures, Crops, and \nTrees  (irrespective of \ntenure status) \n\nCommunity Buildings, \nPublic Infrastructure and \nFacilities  \n\nLoss of Income from \nBusiness and Income \nSources (temporary) \n\nLoss of Job (temporary \nor permanent) for \nEmployees Farm and \nCoal Companies \n\nTable A12: Project Entitlements \n\nEntitlements \nFor  land  that  will  be  used  permanently,  as  a  priority,  replacement  land  or  cash \ncompensation  at  replacement  cost  (i.e.,  current  market  value,  productive  value,  and \nsimilar location attributes). Compensation will be provided to men and women. \nAll legal owners of houses and structures  will be paid based on current market prices of \nmaterials  and  labor  with  no  deduction  for  depreciation  or  salvageable  materials.  \nUnharvested crops will be compensated based on current market value, while trees will be \npaid for based on type, age, and productive capacity. \nRepair  or  restoration  to  original  or  better  conditions  of  affected  community  buildings  and \ninfrastructure at no cost to community; or placement, if necessary, at locations identified in \nconsultation with affected communities and relevant authorities, at no cost to community; \nor cash compensation at replacement cost for affected community assets. \nFor  unregistered  businesses,  cash  compensation  for  the  duration  of  business  and/or \nincome  generation  that  is  disrupted  based  on  the  minimum  wage  per  month  in  the \nprovince. For registered businesses, cash compensation for the duration of business and \nincome  generation  that  is  disrupted  based  on  net  income.  For  employees  (men  and \nwomen  farmers  and  company  workers),  cash  compensation  for  wages  for  each  month \nthey  cannot  work.  For  men  and  women  fisherfolk  relying  partially  (secondary  source  of \nincome)  on  Mong  Duong  River  (affected  during  construction  of  river  diversion), \ncompensation for lost income based on average net income from fishing for 6 months or \nlonger depending on the duration of the temporary impacts.  \nFor temporary loss of job: (i) cash compensation for lost salary and wages for each month \na  person  cannot  work;  and  (ii)  assistance  in  securing  new  employment.  For  permanent \nloss of job: (i) cash compensation for 6 months salary and wages, or cash compensation \nfor  the  remaining  period  of  contract,  whichever  is  higher;  (ii)  assistance  in  securing  new \nemployment;  and  (ii)  assistance  for  livelihood  stabilization  and  livelihood  restoration \n\n                                                 \n2 Impact cannot be determined during the EIA due to lack of information on the standing volume of the effluent stream \n\nin the channel (i.e., heat dilution capacity). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n62 \n \n\nImpacts \n\nLoss of Income from \nBusiness and \n(Permanent) \n\nDisruption and \nInconvenience During \nPhysical Relocation  \nSeverely Affecteda \nHouseholds, Poor and \nVulnerable Households, \nand Cam Hai Commune \nResidentsb \n\nTemporary Impacts  \n(during construction) \n\nEntitlements \n\nprograms. \nFor  unregistered  businesses,  cash  compensation  for  12  months  based  on  the  minimum \nwage  per  month  in  the  province,  and  assistance  to  develop  alternative  livelihood.  For \nregistered  businesses,  cash  compensation  for  12  months  based  on  net  income,  and \nassistance to develop alternative livelihood. For men and women fisherfolk relying mainly \non Mong Duong River and De Dach estuary, cash compensation for 12 months or longer \nbased on average net income from fishing.   \nAll relocating households will receive materials transport allowance from D3 million to D5 \nmillion per household, according to the actual need. \n\nIn  addition  to  payment  for  assets  and/or  lost  income,  livelihood  stabilization  allowance \n(equivalent  to  30  kilograms  of  rice  per  family  member  per  month  from  6  months  to  12 \nmonths);  assistance  for  occupational  change  or  enhancement  (training);  and  livelihood \nrestoration programs, such as project-related employment opportunities, access to credit, \nagricultural  extension,  and  development  of  alternate  livelihoods  for  men  and  women \nfisherfolk who can no longer fish. \nPayment  of  rent  for  the  use  of  land  during  temporary  use.

Special \nattention  will  be  given  to  identifying  and  addressing  any  special  needs  of  other  vulnerable \ngroups,  such  as  the  landless,  the  poor,  women-headed  households,  the  disabled,  and  war \nveterans.  This  will  be  carried  out  through  separate  consultations  for  men  and  women,  and  by \nensuring  that  they  benefit  from  the  socioeconomic  programs  to  be  implemented  under  the \nProject.  A  gender  strategy  is  prepared  for  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy \n(Appendix  13),  and  is  included  in  the  RP  and  RF.  The  project  supervision  consultants, \nindependent  monitoring  organization,  and  the  organization  that  will  plan  and  implement \nlivelihood restoration programs will ensure that the gender strategy is implemented.  \n \nF. \n \n8. \nHouseholds that have to relocate will participate in identifying and selecting options for \ngovernment  assistance  to  (i)  relocate  on  their  existing  plot,  (ii)  move  to  group  or  individual \nrelocation  sites,  or  (iii)  receive  cash  compensation  and  make  their  own  arrangements  for \nrelocation. If any businesses have to relocate, they will be assisted in finding viable new sites. \nHouseholds that are severely affected through the loss of 10% or more productive assets will be \nassisted  in  purchasing  replacement  land,  increasing  productivity  on  their  remaining  land,  or \nlearning  new  income-generating  skills through the  livelihood  restoration  programs  and  project-\nrelated job opportunities. Severely affected fisherfolk and workers will also be supported through \na  livelihood  restoration  program  and  project-related  job  opportunities.  Although  impacts  on \nfisheries  in  the  discharge  channel  (Cam  Hai  Commune)  can  be  determined  only  during \noperation, based on water quality and fisheries monitoring and comparison against a baseline \nthat  will  be  established  during  project  implementation,  alternate  livelihood  programs  will  be \n\nResettlement and Income Restoration Strategies \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n63 \n\nParticipation, Grievance Redress, and Disclosure \n\nprovided  during  project  implementation  to  prepare  them  for  possible  loss  of  fisheries  income \nduring operation.  \n \nG. \n \n8. \nBetween  January  2006  and  March  2006,  key  stakeholders  participated  in,  and  were \nconsulted  regarding,  the  preparation  for  the  RP.  These  stakeholders  included  the  (i)  People\u2019s \nCommittees of affected provinces, districts, and towns; (ii) affected households and companies; \n(iii) relevant Government agencies; and (iv) social organizations. A workshop was held in Cam \nPha  Town  to  present  the  Project\u2019s  potential  impacts,  ADB\u2019s  policies,  proposed  entitlements, \ninstitutional arrangements, and project schedule. This was followed by a stakeholder meeting in \nMong Duong Ward. The concerns and suggestions provided by the affected persons during the \nworkshops and public meetings then were incorporated in the RP. In addition, copies of public \ninformation  booklets  were  distributed  to  the  affected  persons.  Resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation will continue to follow the Project\u2019s participatory approach. Further consultations \nand stakeholder participation are to be carried out during project implementation.   \n \n9. \nA  grievance  mechanism  will  be  established  to  ensure  that  affected  persons\u2019  concerns \nand  grievances  are  addressed  and  resolved  in  a  timely  and  satisfactory  manner.  Affected \npersons  will  be  made  fully  aware  of  their  rights  verbally  and  in  writing  during  consultation, \nsurvey, and at the time of compensation. During RP planning, the affected persons were made \naware of ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism Policy by providing copies of the accountability field \nguide,  which  has  been  translated  into  Vietnamese.  The  Thermal  Power  Project  Management \nUnit 1 (TPMMU1) and resettlement committees will be responsible for the disclosure of the draft \nand  final  resettlement  planning  documents  to  the  affected  persons.  ADB  will  upload  the  draft \nand final resettlement planning documents on ADB\u2019s resettlement Web site. \n \nH. \n \n10. \nResettlement  committees  will  be  established  at  the  provincial,  district,  and  commune \nlevels, as required by Decree 197/CP (2004). These will be under the responsibility of TPPMU1, \nwhich will take on the responsibilities of a project management unit. Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) \nand TPPMU1 have limited experience in preparing and implementing resettlement activities in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  requirements.  Project  supervision  consultants  will  be \nengaged  for  supervision  and  capacity  building  to  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement. The project supervision consultants, comprising one international \nresettlement specialist, one national resettlement specialist, and one national gender specialist, \nwill  be  recruited  and  mobilized  before  any  resettlement  activities  start  (i.e.,  before  detailed \nmeasurement survey or DMS). A livelihood and community development specialist will also be \nrecruited  as  part  of  the  resettlement  team  to  assist  in  the  design  and  implementation  of \nlivelihood restoration programs; and to work closely with the fisheries specialist (part of the EIA \nteam)  to  determine  the  impacts  on  fisheries,  and  to  recommend  appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures in close consultation with affected people. \n \nI. \n \n11. \nTPPMU1  will  be  responsible  for  internal  monitoring  of  resettlement  activities.  Progress \nreports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  quarterly.  One  agency  and  institution  specializing  in  social \nsciences,  which  will  be  known  as  the  Independent  Monitoring  Agency  (IMA),  will  be  recruited \nand  mobilized  before  any  resettlement  activities  start.  The  IMA  will  be  required  to  submit \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nMonitoring  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n64 \n \n\nreports  on \n\nCost Estimates \n\nthe  progress  of \n\nimplementation,  and  make  any  necessary \n\nquarterly \nrecommendations regarding the issues identified.   \n \nJ. \n \n12. \nA replacement cost survey for land and other assets was carried out during resettlement \nplanning.  The  total  cost  for  resettlement  is  estimated  at  $3.6  million,  which  covers  (i) \ncompensation  costs  and  allowances,  (ii)  design  and  implementation  of  livelihood  restoration \nprograms,  (iii)  consulting,  (iv)  management  and  implementation  costs,  and  (v)  contingencies.  \nThese sums, however, might change at the time of the DMS to take into account actual losses, \nas well as any changes in prices that might have occurred between the preparation of the RP \nand  its  implementation.  The  Government  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for \nresettlement,  and  will  meet  any  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  the  RP  budget  to  satisfy \nresettlement objectives.  \n \nK. \n \n13. \nThe  RP  will  be  updated  by  component  following  detailed  design.  It  will  be  disclosed  to \naffected persons before submission to ADB for review and approval. All resettlement activities \nwill  be  coordinated  with  the  civil  works  schedule.  Civil  works  contractors  will  not  be  issued  a \nnotice of possession of site for a particular component until (i) compensation and relocation of \naffected persons to new sites have been completed satisfactorily; and (ii) agreed rehabilitation \nassistance  is  in  place  for  a  particular  component,  and  that  component  is  free  of  all \nencumbrances.  Land  acquisition  and  relocation  of  affected  persons  cannot  begin  until  ADB \nreviews and approves the updated RP. \n \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n65 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinks to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in Viet Nam: \n \nIn  recent  years,  strong  economic  growth  in  Viet  Nam  resulted  in  substantial  demand  for  electricity  throughout  the \ncountry.  The  link  between  economic  development  and  power  demand  is  strong.  The  demand  for  electricity  has \nincreased  about  15%  per  year  over  2000-2005.  High  demand  for  electricity  has  been  triggered  by  ongoing \nelectrification in new areas, expansion of transmission and distribution network, and an increase in industrial demand \nin  line  with  the  development  of  new  industrial  zones  and  enterprises  throughout  the  country.  The  rapid  economic \ngrowth has contributed to Viet Nam\u2019s success in bringing down the share of the population living in poverty from 58% \nin 1993 to 24.1% in 2004. Poverty reduction has been a result of rapid, stable, and inclusive economic growth. The \nGovernment\u2019s aim is to maintain economic growth of 7.5% per year until 2010, and to reduce poverty incidence to 10\u2013\n11%  by  2010.  However,  Viet  Nam  is  facing  a  growing  electricity  supply  deficit.  A  reliable  and  sufficient  amount  of \nelectricity  supply  is  important  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  To  address  this  electricity  deficit,  and  to \nimprove the quality and reliability of electricity supply to industrial, rural, commercial, and residential consumers in Viet \nNam, 12,000 megawatts (MW) of new  generating capacity is  planned.  About half of this planned additional capacity \n(6,000  MW)  will  be  generated  from  coal-fired  power  plants.  With  other  energy  generation  sources,  the  proposed \nProject  can  help  meet  the  economy\u2019s  increasing  demand  for  electrical  power  from  2010  on,  and  can  minimize  the \ncountry\u2019s  dependence  on  imported  power.  At  the  regional  level,  the  Project  can  meet  the  demand  of  the  economic \ntriangle of Hanoi\u2013Hai Phong\u2013Quang Ninh. At the provincial  level, the Project  will use local coal supply  and promote \nthe development of industries\u2014coal mining and limestone quarrying\u2014thereby creating jobs for local residents.   \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nFollowing Asian Development Bank\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), projects classified as \ngeneral  intervention  no  longer  require  project-level  poverty  assessment.  The  following  is  a  brief  description  of  the \naffected people, and the likely impact of the Project. The project site is in one ward (Mong Duong) and two communes \n(Duong Huy, Cam Hai). All the affected households in the project area are Kinh. The Project does not affect any ethnic \nminority  households.  Economic  activities  in  the  project  area  vary  by  location.  Coal  mining,  shipbuilding,  cement \nproduction, fisheries, and seafood processing are the main activities of Cam Pha town, while coal industry is the main \ndriver of the economy for Mong Duong  ward. The economy in the project area relies mainly on forestry and various \nindustries,  rather  than  agriculture.  Tree  plantation  for  timber,  aquaculture,  and  fisheries  are  the  main  sources  of \nincome at the commune level.  \n \nThe main project impacts are loss of jobs; land acquisition (refer to resettlement plan); and loss of forest, mangrove, \nand aquatic resources (refer to the environmental impact assessment). The Project will acquire forest plantation land \nfrom forest plantation cooperatives. Large land owners own the cooperatives, which have permanent wage  workers. \nSimilarly, land from a big aquaculture pond will be acquired. The Mong Duong power plant will negatively impact the \nwater quality and biological resources of marine coastal environment. The diversion of Mong Duong River and cooling \nwater  discharge  channel  to  Cam  Hai  commune  would  have  adverse  affect  on  fishery  and  mangroves  (refer  to  EIA). \nThe  resettlement  plan,  gender  strategy,  and  environment  management  plan  of  the  Project  include  strategies  to \naddress these impacts on the local environment and livelihood of the people. \n \nHealth. Coal mining in Cam Pha Town has been polluting the air and environment through discharge of wastewater, \ndust etc. The widespread diseases in the project area related to pollution are (i) respiratory problems, (ii) lung disease, \nand  (iii)  eyes  and  nose  infection.  In  Mong  Duong,  68%  of  children  suffer  from  respiratory  diseases,  and  50%  suffer \nfrom nose and eyes infections. These diseases are linked mainly to the coal dust generated by coal transportation. A \nsubstantial proportion of the coal mine workers have contracted silicosis. VINACOAL has a program to give its most \nseverely  affected  workers  access  to  silicosis  treatment.  Coal  dust-related  health  problems  of  local  people  might \nincrease  because  of  additional  dust  generated  by  the  Project.  During  project  implementation,  occupational  health \nmeasures will be developed to minimize health problems related to coal dust pollution for the workers. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n66 \n \n\nHIV/AIDS  data  indicates  significant  incidence  in  Cam  Pha  town.  Some  cases  of  HIV  are  reported  in  Mong  Duong \nward.  The  project  province,  Quang  Ninh,  has  133  kilometre  (km)  of  national  border  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina, with international border gates and unofficial crossroads through which goods and people traverse every day. \nIn  addition,  the  province  has  a  250  km  sea  border,  which  allows  various  forms  of  marine  moving,  including  human \ntrafficking. During construction, camps for construction  workers and offices  will be established in the project sites. A \nworkforce of 4,500 is expected on site during construction. The labor camp will be set up near to the project sites. In \naddition,  permanent  workers  camps  will  be  established  for  the  Mong  Duong  project.  The  presence  of  large  number \nlabor  camps  in  pre-  and  post-construction  phases  poses  a  potential  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  in  the \nproject  area.  In  the  project  province,  government  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  have  been  engaged  in \nimplementing HIV/AIDS and human trafficking-related programs. From January 1999 to February 2003, Quang Ninh \nprovincial  police  dealt  with  91  cases  of  human  trafficking.  From  January  2005,  the  International  Organization  of \nMigration,  in  partnership  with  the  Women\u2019s  Union,  implemented  an  18-month  Counter  Trafficking  Project  in  Quang \nNinh Province, Viet Nam. A national program on AIDS is implemented in the province. In addition, several NGOs are \npresent in Cam Pha, and have programs to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.  \n \nUnder the proposed Project, HIV/AIDs and human trafficking awareness program will be undertaken during pre- and \npost-construction phases in the project  area. The experience and  lessons from the  existing  program  in the  province \nwill be incorporated in designing the awareness program. In addition, the awareness program will be coordinated as \nappropriate with the existing programs of various agencies.  \n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nStakeholder  analysis  as  part  of  the  consultation  process  was  conducted  at  the  commune  and  district  level  during \npreparation of the feasibility study of the Project.   \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe  Project  will  emphasize  participatory  processes  in  implementing  the  resettlement  plan,  environmental  impact \nassessment  plan,  occupational  health  action  plan,  and  awareness  program  on  human  trafficking  and  HIV/AIDS. \nCommune-level resettlement committees will include representatives of affected people, mass organizations (women\u2019s \nunion, youth union), and relevant commune-level officials to address resettlement issues. The Government Decree 79 \n(Grassroots  Democracy)  encourages  community  participation.  The  commune-level  resettlement  committees  will \nfacilitate effective implementation of Decree 79. The occupational health and safety plan and awareness programs on \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking will facilitate active community involvement in implementing the activities (see gender \nstrategy below).  \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nIn  the  project  area,  the  main  economic  activities  include  forest  plantation,  fishery,  and  industry.  Gender  analyses \ninclude households affected by land acquisition and loss of fisheries. Women work in aquaculture and forest plantation \nas  wage  workers.  In  marine  fishery,  women  accompany  men  out  to  sea,  and  they  play  significant  role  in  all  fishing \nactivities: catching fish, preparing nets, harvesting, cleaning, and selling fish. Women also are involved in white worm \ncollection in the coastal area. Women in the forest plantation are involved in planting, taking care of trees, and cutting \ntrees. In aquaculture, women are responsible for feeding fish and taking care of the pond. To ensure the participation \nwomen  in  project  activities  during  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  as  well  as  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking, \nand health-related programs, the following measures are included in the gender strategy: \n\nAt  project  inception,  a  capacity  building  training  program  on  resettlement  activities  will  be  designed  for \nwomen  and  men  commune  officials,  and  women  and  men  from  affected  households.  The  training  will \nalso include representatives from line agencies, and representatives from the commune Women\u2019s Union \nand  Youth  Union  involved  in  resettlement  committees.  The  training  will  include  information  on \nresettlement activities, compensation, and the impact of the Project on livelihood activities related to the \nloss  of  jobs  and  fisheries.  The  objective  of  the  training  is  to  provide  affected  communities  with  an \nunderstanding resettlement issues and the environmental impact of the Project on fisheries, mangroves, \nand health. The training  will facilitate effective implementation of the resettlement plan, and  will help in \naddressing of environment-related impacts on livelihoods. \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n67 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nThe  district  resettlement  committees  will  include  women  representatives  from  the  district  Women\u2019s \nUnion.  Commune-level  resettlement  committees  will  include  the  commune  Women\u2019s  Union  and  Youth \nUnion to represent the interests of women in the affected households to assist resettlement activities.  \n\nSeparate  consultations  will  be  held  with  the  men  and  women  workers  from  the  forest  plantation,  coal \ncompanies,  aquaculture  industry,  and  households  regarding  compensation  and  deployment  in  forest \nplantation  and  aquaculture  industry  in  another  location.  Project  monitoring  will  include  information  on \ndeployment of women  workers. Similarly, separate consultation  will be held  with men and  women from \nfisherfolk households to determine relevant compensation for loss of fisheries and developing fish culture \nand plantation of mangrove-related activities. \n\nSpecific attention will be given to complaints and grievances by women.  \n\nThermal  Power  Project  Management  Unit  1  will  create  a  specific  awareness  activities  for  men  and \nwomen workers about occupational health issues linked to the power plant project. Occupational health \nand  safety  awareness  will  include  identification  of  gender-related  occupation  health  issues  and  safety \nmeasures.  \n\nTPPMU1  will  conduct  an  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  awareness  campaign  involving  communities \nduring  project  construction  and  implementation.  Women\u2019s  Union,  Youth  Union,  health  workers,  female \ncommunity leaders and members, and women from affected households will be involved in implementing \nthe campaign. \n\nAs per the Labor Code (as amended  in 2002), all  employment for the  Project  will respect Government \ncommitments  to  gender  equity,  including  (i)  deployment  of  women  workers  in  forest  plantation, \naquaculture industry, and coal companies; (ii) ensuring that no child will be used; and (iii) ensuring the \nsame wages are paid to men and women for work of equal value. \n\nThe Executing Agency will create a specific occupational health and safety awareness training program \nfor men and women workers. A gender-related occupation health and safety management system will be \nestablished. The Health and Safety Committee will include women representatives as members. \n\nGender sensitization training related to resettlement and occupational health will be provided for relevant \nstaff from the Electricity of Vietnam, TPPMU1, and resettlement committees.   \n\nA  national  consultant  on  social  development  and  gender  will  be  included  in  the  consulting  services  for \nthe  implementation  of  the  gender  strategy.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the  social  development  and \ngender consultants are included in the consulting services. \n\n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nYes, a gender strategy has been prepared (see above) \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\fE.
