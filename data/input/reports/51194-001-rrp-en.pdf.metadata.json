The  project  will  contribute to  the \nprovince\u2019s transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient development patterns. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe PRC plays a pivotal role in managing the climate change challenge in Asia and the \nPacific.  Given  the  country\u2019s  current  level  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and  climate \nvulnerability, there is a vast need for climate-related investments going beyond business as usual \nto  underpin  its  development  targets. 2 With  high  reliance  on  coal  power  and  heavy  industry, \nShandong Province is initiating systemic interventions to build climate resilience and decarbonize \nits economy. The province has a population of about 100 million and ranks eighth in the PRC in \nterms of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Shandong Province has a similar economic \nstructure to that of the PRC with a rapid industrial development and high GHG emissions.3  \n \nSince 2010, the Government of the PRC, with the support of the Asian Development Bank \n4. \n(ADB)  and  other  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs),  has  established  a  strong  policy \nframework  for  climate  change  to  promote  ecological  civilization  rather  than  a  GDP-oriented \ndevelopment.4 To support this paradigm shift and address the high level of vulnerability to climate \nchange, the PRC committed to new climate actions through its Intended Nationally Determined \nContribution  (INDC)  signed  under  the  Paris  Agreement.5 The  Work  Plan  for  Controlling  GHG \nEmissions During the 13th Five-Year Period has set specific tasks and measurable and binding \nGHG  emissions  control  goals  by  2020. 6  Shandong  Province  aims  for  carbon  dioxide  (CO2) \nemissions to peak around 2027, three years earlier than the INDC (around 2030).  \n  \n5. \nShandong Province is making efforts to scale up climate investments, but public sector \nresources  are  scarce  and  insufficient  to  meet  the  huge  financing  needs.  Private  sector \nparticipation  is  required  to  bridge  the  funding  gap  and  to  bring  in  expertise,  efficiency,  and \nadvanced technologies. A new approach beyond traditional financing and banking modalities is \nneeded to unlock significant climate finance. The project is designed to catalyze PIC finance at \nscale  for  a  new  generation  of  climate-positive  subprojects  with  perceived  high  risks  that, \notherwise, may not be attractive to commercial investors. The project will cater to climate financing \nrequirements  for  longer-term,  flexible  structuring  and  competitive  pricing;  build  climate  finance \n                                                \n1  At least 70% of the subprojects financed (in line with the fund commitment) need to be located in Shandong Province. \n2  In 2016, the PRC was the largest GHG emitter worldwide\u2014accounting for just under one-third of global emissions \n(10,151 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in the PRC versus 36,183 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \nworldwide); the Global Climate Risk Index ranks the PRC as the 12th most affected country by extreme weather \nevents and estimates financial losses amounting to $82 billion and economic losses up to 3.5% GDP. \n\n3   It is PRC\u2019s largest coal and energy consumer (about 10% of the country\u2019s consumption). \n4  Harmony between humans and nature, resulting in a low- carbon economy. \n5  United Nations. 2016.

It  will  help  overcome  barriers  such  as \naffordability constraints, first-mover risks, behavioral risks, and low-technology penetration rates. \nThe  project  design  represents  a  paradigm  shift  over  the  business  as  usual  climate-related \ninvestment, which typically complies with local regulations with minimum climate impacts. This is \ncritical  for  Shandong  Provincial  Government  (SPG)  to  meet  its  aggressive  climate  targets.  As \nsuch, the Shandong Green Development Fund (SGDF) will function as the financial arm of the \nSPG to support its proactive climate policies, and crowd in PIC investors to fund subprojects which \nproduce climate change public goods and positive externalities. \n \n6. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  to  facilitate  the \ngovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda  of  managing  climate  change.7 It  supports  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030 \noperational  plan  of  tackling  climate  change  by  fully  integrating  climate  change  mitigation  and \nadaptation  into  the  project  design,  contributing  to  increase  climate  finance  targets,  and \naccelerating  low  GHG  development  in  line  with  the  PRC INDC.8 The  project  contributes to the \nSustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)\u2014especially  SDG  9:  Industry, \nInnovation,  and \nInfrastructure,  by  building  climate-resilient  infrastructure  and  fostering  a  new  climate  finance \nmodel;  and  SDG  13:  Climate  Action,  by  taking  urgent  actions  to  promote  climate-related \ninvestments  to  combat  climate  change  impacts. ADB  has  long-term  engagement  in  the  PRC\u2019s \nenvironment-related financing initiatives such as the Low Carbon City Program; the Yangtze River \nEconomic  Belt  Framework;  and  the  Air  Quality  Improvement  Program  in  the  Greater  Beijing\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Hebei Region. Under the Air Quality Improvement Program, ADB approved an investment \nloan  for  Shandong  Province  in  2018  targeting  mitigation,  energy  efficiency,  and  air  quality \nimprovement at county level administrations with low capacity.9 Based on these experiences and \nin  partnership  with  the  PRC  agencies,  the  project  is  meant  to  have  a  catalytic,  qualitatively \ndifferent role in relation to climate finance and to complement other facilities. \n \nPriority sectors. Shandong Province was designated to pilot a shift to a low-carbon and \n7. \nclimate-resilient growth paradigm that could be replicated nationwide if successful.10 The portfolio \ndistribution  (Table  1)  of  the  SGDF  is  guided  by  a  GHG  profile  and  climate  vulnerability \nassessment,  which  analyzes  where  climate  financing  can  have  most  impacts  to  achieve  the \nprovincial  policy  objectives  and  is  summarized  in  the  climate  change  assessment.  11 , 12  The \nassessment concluded that the main sources of GHG emissions in Shandong Province are in the \nenergy  production  sector,  buildings,  and  the  rapidly  growing  urban  transport,  resulting  in  the \nSGDF\u2019s mitigation priorities (i) renewable energy production, including wind, solar, biomass, and \ngeothermal; (ii) green buildings; and (iii) low-carbon transport.13 The SGDF\u2019s adaptation priorities \nare  irrigation  and  integrated  urban  water  management,  including  flood  proofing,  through  low-\nimpact development (sponge cities); and coastal protection. \n \n\n                                                \n7  ADB.  2016.

The  SGDF  is  a  multi-tiered  fund \nstructure to accommodate a timing difference between the ADB loan (20 years) and investment \nhorizon of the PIC investors (up to 10 years). It includes a 20-year catalytic fund holding the seed \ncapital from the IFIs. The IFIs and public funding will then be blended with PIC capital at an initial \ntarget  ratio  45:55  into  a  series  of  shorter-term  funds  (8  to  10  years)  to  match  the  investment \nhorizon of PIC investors to finance climate-positive subprojects. The SGDF will be structured as \nlimited partnerships and managed by a top-tier fund manager. Any qualified subproject financed \nunder the project will comply with the provisions set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \n9. \nShandong  Green  Development  Fund  investment  strategy.  The  SGDF\u2019s  investment \nstrategy  consists  of  facilitating the  transition to  a low-carbon future  and to  both  encourage the \ndevelopment of climate-positive subprojects and leverage its public funding in Shandong Province. \nThe  objective  is  to  tap  new  funding  sources  and  leverage  existing  sources  of  finance  into  a \npipeline of viable climate-positive investments by (i) ensuring the SGDF addresses priority climate \nimpacts  and  vulnerabilities  in  Shandong  Province,  where  at  least  70%  of  the  investment  is \ntargeted; (ii) incorporating a project development mechanism funded under the output 2 capacity \ndevelopment  program  to  develop  a  pipeline  of  climate-positive,  sustainable,  and  replicable \nsubprojects based on high level of performance against the SGDF Green Climate Assessment \nGuidelines;  (iii)  incorporating  structures  for  leveraging  PIC  finance,  targeting  pension  funds, \ninsurance  companies,  commercial  banks,  and  corporate  investors  in  the  SGDF  and  in  the \nsubprojects; and (iv) bringing into subprojects the expertise from the private sector and advanced \ntechnologies. 14 By  establishing  clear  definitions,  guidelines,  and  systems  for  climate  finance \nfollowing  international  best  practices,  the  SGDF  will  ensure  transformational  change  with \nadequate risk mitigation. \n \n10. \nShandong Green Development Fund selection criteria. Any subprojects that contribute \nto  climate  change  mitigation  (measured  through  GHG/CO2eq  emissions  reduction)  or  climate \nchange  adaptation  (measured  through  improvement  of  the  beneficiaries\u2019  resilience)  that  meet \neligibility criteria in the Project Administration Manual (PAM) may be considered for investment.15 \nAll investments will be screened with the criteria set under the SGDF Green Climate Assessment \nGuidelines  (footnote  14).  Subprojects  will  be  enhanced  through  the  capacity  development \nprogram  to  maximize  their  climate  benefits  and  the  adoption  of  high-level  technologies.  All \ninvestments will be evaluated based on financial, economic, commercial, legal and safeguards \ndue diligence. \n \n11. \n\nClimate investment process. All subprojects must be financially sustainable and bring \n\n                                                \n14 Shandong  Green  Development  Fund  Green  Climate  Assessment  Guidelines  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments  in  Appendix  2  and  as  an  appendix  to  the  project  administration  manual  developed  during  project \npreparation and based on the Green Climate Fund Investment Framework). \n\n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fProject Description \n\nmeasurable and positive climate impacts. They will be screened with the SGDF Green Climate \nAssessment Guidelines (footnote 14) and categorized under the guidelines as exhibiting \u201cgood \npractices\u201d or \u201cadvanced benefits\u201d or being \u201ctransformational\u201d depending on the climate impacts.16 \nThe SGDF\u2019s investment process will incorporate screening, monitoring, evaluation, reporting, and \nverification (MERV) of the climate performance of the subprojects. The SGDF will link financing \nterms to the level of climate benefits of the subprojects. By mobilizing public and catalytic funding, \nthe  project  can  prioritize  financing  to  subprojects  with  higher  climate  impacts  (expected  to  be \ncategorized \u201ctransformational\u201d or \u201cadvanced benefits\u201d) and possibly higher financial risks, thereby \nestablishing bankability support conditions and incentivizing structures linked to climate results. \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 \n12. \nor earlier on best efforts achieved.17 The project will have the following outcome: climate resilience \nin Shandong Province enhanced.18 \n \nOutput 1: Shandong Green Development Fund established with private, institutional, \n13. \nand commercial financing leveraged. The SGDF will be structured as an investment pooling \nvehicle for climate financing and run by a professional fund management company (FMC). The \nSGDF  will  target  investing  75%  in  mitigation,  measured  through  carbon  dioxide  equivalent \n(CO2eq)  emissions  reduction;  and  25%  in  adaptation,  measured  through  improvement  of  the \nbeneficiaries\u2019  resilience.  By  2027,  the  project  is  expected  to  reduce  CO2eq  emissions  by  2.5 \nmillion  tons  per  year  and  directly  build  resilience  for  at  least  2  million  people  in  Shandong \nProvince. The project will leverage PIC funding at a market rate in both SGDF and subprojects, \nwith reinvesting occurring from years 5 to 15. \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Knowledge  and  skills  of  local  governments,  civil  society,  and  private \nsector to prepare climate-positive subprojects enhanced. The FMC will manage a capacity \ndevelopment  program  financed  under  the  loan  to  provide:  (i)  consulting  services  for  design\u2013\nreview\u2013advice to improve the quality of the subproject proposals and maximize climate benefits; \n(ii) MERV for green climate ratings of subprojects and portfolios; and (iii) capacity development, \nespecially for safeguards and disbursement procedures and policy advisory to the SPG to define \nits climate policies for the next five-year plan (2021\u20132025). \n \nC. \n \n15. \nbenchmarked to international green and climate best practices in the following aspects. \n \n16. \nLeveraging effect. ADB will provide and mobilize the IFIs\u2019 catalytic funding, on which the \nSGDF  depends,  to  attract  local  public  resources  and  maximize  PIC  capital  flows  into  climate-\npositive  subprojects.  SGDF financing  will  be  targeted  (climate-related  investment),  time-bound \n(3\u201310 years), and transitional (up to 67% of subproject costs for up to 10 years). The project\u2019s \ndesign positions the SGDF as an anchor investor to help catalyze significant additional resources. \nBy  revolving  distributions  from  shorter-term  funds,  the  SGDF  will  finance  a  large  number  of \nclimate-positive  subprojects  over  the  20-year  project  life  span.  IFIs\u2019  contribution  to  the  SGDF \n(about \u20ac260 million) is expected to achieve a leveraging ratio over five. In addition, the level of \n\nADB\u2019s participation is considered critical for the design and establishment of the SGDF, \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n                                                \n16 Such terms are defined in the Shandong Green Development Fund Green Climate Assessment Guidelines. \n17 Government of the PRC. 2015.

The  shift from  business  as  usual, \ncomplying  with  national  legislation,  to  subprojects  delivering  advanced  and  transformational \nbenefits, is supported by the stricter green climate investment criteria enshrined in the loan and \nproject  agreements.  The  project  will  also  incentivize  subprojects  to  adopt  green  procurement \nstandards,19 as greening a subproject\u2019s supply chain such that it shifts from \u201cgood practices\u201d to \n\u201cadvanced benefits\u201d will enable access to better financing terms and conditions from the SGDF.  \n \n18. \nProject development. The SGDF will promote the adoption of SOURCE, a multilateral \ndigital platform initially developed by ADB and adopted by other IFIs and the private sector, to \nfast-track  the  delivery  of  quality  infrastructure  projects.20 SOURCE  is  designed  to  help  public \nsector agencies better prepare, manage, and publish their infrastructure projects to attract private \nsector investors. This cloud-based system allows the FMC to present information on all aspects \nof  the  development  of  an  infrastructure  project  for  consistency,  quality,  transparency,  and \naccountability using sector-specific templates. A comprehensive digital platform for an enhanced \nproject management information system for MERV facilitates reporting to the IFIs and the central \nand provincial governments.21   \n \n19. \nKnowledge  management.

ADB will finance 15% of total mitigation and adaptation costs.  \n \nE. \n \n24. \nSPG is the executing agency, represented by Shandong Province Finance Bureau. SPG \nis establishing the SGDF under an experienced financial intermediary, Shandong Development \n& Investment Holding Group (SDIHG), a state-owned enterprise wholly owned by SPG, as the \nimplementing  agency.  SDIHG  operates  under  the  PRC  Company  Law,  2018  and  is  financially \nautonomous.  As  a  provincial  investment  platform  to  support  infrastructure  development  and \nindustrial  transformation,  SDIHG  has  experience  in  ensuring  that  planned  investments  meet \nbroader  policy  requirements.  Qingdao  Municipal  Government  will  invest  in  the  SGDF  to  (i) \nstrengthen Qingdao as a regional green investment center and (ii) leverage its contribution with \nPIC finance to fund climate-positive urban infrastructure and business locally. A fund manager \nincorporated in the PRC, CICC Capital Management Co., Ltd. (CCM), a subsidiary of a leading \ninvestment bank, China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC), was selected by SDIHG \nto manage the SGDF based on the criteria required by the IFIs: (i) top-ranked asset manager in \nthe  PRC  in  terms  of  track  record,  size  of  assets  under  management,  governance,  risk \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fmanagement, and management profile; (ii) licensed by the regulator to operate a fund in the PRC; \n(iii) more than 8 years\u2019 experience, including opening and closing a fund; and (iv) experience with \npublic  and  IFI  funding  mechanisms.  CCM  has  assets  under  management  of  CNY300  billion \nacross more than 20 funds with extensive experience in setting up and managing commercialized \nfunds, including mandates from the central and local governments to realize strategic visions. \n \n25. \nShandong  Province  Finance  Bureau  receives  the  loan  proceeds  from  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, maintains the foreign currency account, and transfers the proceeds to SDIHG in local \ncurrency for investment in a 20-year catalytic fund, which will manage and revolve the long-term \ncatalytic  funding  from  IFIs,  including  ADB,  into  a  series  of  shorter-term  funds  that  reflect  PIC \ninvestors\u2019 investment horizons in line with market practices. Generally, the shorter-term funds will \nhave an investment period of 4 to 5 years, an exit period of about 3 years, and a possible 2-year \nextension period to complete exits from investments in an orderly manner. Using their own funds, \nCCM and SDIHG will invest in the SGDF as co-general partners. Distributions from the shorter-\nterm funds will be made to the catalytic fund for reinvestment, except as distributed to SDIHG to \npay its debt service on onlent IFI debt. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s no-objection will be required before the ADB loan is disbursed to any fund and to \nthe  first  three  subprojects.  Subprojects  and  investees  that  receive  more  than  the  limit  of  \u20ac70 \nmillion will also require ADB\u2019s no-objection.25 The implementation arrangements are summarized \nin Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 15). \n  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nJanuary 2020\u2013December 2026 \n31 December 2026 \n30 June 2027 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii)  Key implementing agency \n(iii)  Implementing unit (fund \nmanagement company) \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nDisbursement \n\nShandong Provincial Government \nShandong Development & Investment Holding Group \nCICC Capital Management Co., Ltd. with offices in Qingdao (headquarters) \nand Jinan, Shandong, and Beijing (total staff 46)  \nAll procurement to be financed under the project will be carried out in \naccordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and regulations for financial intermediation loans. \nQBS (green rating) \nICS (MERV, PDF, capacity \ndevelopment, knowledge \nmanagement) \nRPS (policy workshops) \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \n\n1 contract \nPerson-months: \nInternational (180) and \nnational (480), as required \n\n$1.0 million \n$8.5 million \n \n$0.5 million \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; ICS = individual consultant selection; MERV = monitoring, evaluation, reporting, and \nverification; PDF = project development facility; QBS = quality-based selection; RPS = resource person selection \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n25 An investment shall be deemed to exceed the limit if the amount of such investment, when added to the amount of \nall other investments previously made or authorized by the relevant fund for the same subproject or the same investee \ncompany,  exceeds  the  limit.

One subproject linked to fossil fuels (improving boiler efficiency) \nwas dropped and the other six subprojects are under preparation. \n \nB. \n \n29. \nFinancial analysis was prepared to demonstrate that the SGDF will provide satisfactory \nreturns from investments in climate-positive subprojects. 27 The analysis was prepared under the \nfollowing  assumptions:  (i)  type  of  financing,  debt  or  equity;  (ii)  targeted  portfolio  allocation  by \nclimate  performance;  (iii)  financing  terms  and  conditions,  linked  with  climate  performance;  (iv) \nnonperforming  asset ratio;  and (v)  portfolio  allocation  by  direct  investments  in  subprojects  and \nsub-funds.  For  debt  financing,  the  assumptions  were  tailored  to  provide  attractive  funding  to \nclimate subprojects, reflecting the catalytic terms of the funding from IFIs. The financial analysis \nshows that the investments will provide a return to the PIC investors that is commensurate with \nmarket  standards  and  will  provide  a  lower  return  for  the  funding  from  the  public  investors, \nconsistent with the project design: to use catalytic and public money to crowd in PIC finance and \nprovide affordable financing for climate-positive subprojects. Under the assumptions made, the \nfinancial  analysis  shows  that  SGDF  will  provide  sufficient  cash flow to  SDIHG  to repay  the IFI \ndebt  and  will  provide  the  SGDF\u2019s  private  investors  with  a return  on  their  higher  cost  of  capital \ninvested and return expectations. \n \n30. \nEconomic  analysis  prepared for  the  same  indicative  subprojects  included  the  main  co-\nbenefit of GHG emissions reduction, valued based on recommendation by the Intergovernmental \nPanel  on  Climate  Change. 28 ,  29  Other  co-benefits  were  reduced  air  pollutants,  gases,  and \nwastewater  pollution.  The  economic  analysis  showed  that  the  economic  co-benefits  added \nsignificant value to the overall business case and a minimum of 35% to the main financial benefits. \n                                                \n26  Pre-feasibility studies (accessible from the list of Supplementary Documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2019.

Performance  by  sector  (mitigation  only)  is  established  and  benchmarked  against  the \nMcKinsey  China  Cost-Abatement  calculations,  adjusted  for  improvements  in  technology  and \ncurrent costs.30 The SGDF incentive structure encourages investee companies to improve climate \nperformance in relation to the relevant benchmarks so they can access better financing terms. \nThe  FMC  managing  the  SGDF  is  one  of  the  top  tier  fund  managers  in  the  PRC,  with  enough \ninvestment  experience  to  build  the  capacity  of  the  stakeholders.  Under an  agreement  with the \nimplementing  agency,  the  FMC  will  undertake  the  procurement  for  the  capacity  development \nprogram and will oversee procurement by the investee companies. The SGDF excludes projects \nclassified category A for both environment and involuntary resettlement and categories A and B \nfor indigenous peoples. The Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) to be agreed \nbetween ADB and the FMC, and the Gender Action Plan (GAP), apply to the entire SGDF.31 The \nproject  monitors  subprojects\u2019  beneficiaries, \nthe \nincluding  vulnerable  people, \nsocioeconomic data disaggregated by gender and recorded in the MERV report. \n \n32. \nThe  ADB  project  team  worked  with  development  partners\u2014the  China  Council  for \nInternational  Cooperation  on  Environment  and  Development,  the  United  Nations  Environment \nProgramme, and PIC funds\u2014on cofinancing, policy development, institutional arrangements, and \nharmonizing  safeguard  principles  and  requirements  across  cofinanciers.  The  subprojects\u2019 \nfeasibility  studies  provide  the  expected  environmental,  social  and  health,  and  economic  and \nenvironmental co-benefits, as well as gender consideration. Each subproject must demonstrate \nthat it has considered ways to (i) maximize the local economic benefits of the proposed investment \nand (ii) incorporate gender-sensitive design features to enhance women\u2019s inclusion. Subprojects \nshould be designed to provide opportunities for enhancing employment either directly or indirectly \nthrough  enhanced  productivity,  skills,  and  competitiveness  as  documented  in  the  gender \nframework.32 \n \nD. \n \nThe assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial mainly because of \n33. \nthe greenfield nature of the SGDF. The financial management assessment, as part of a broader \nassessment of institutional performance, covers the financial and legal status; accounting staffing; \naccounting policies and procedures; fund flow arrangements; financial reporting and monitoring \nprocedures  and  practice;  financial  management  information  systems  in  place;  and  the \nrequirements, guidelines, and results of internal and external audits.33 The results showed that \nthe financial management systems and procedures put in place and strengthened by CCM as the \n\nGovernance \n\nthrough \n\n                                                \n30 McKinsey  and  Company.  2009.

SDIHG and CCM are confirmed to have adequate financial management capacity to \nmanage the project. ADB will review and issue no objection on all the key fund documents and \ntemplates to ensure compliance with ADB requirements. \n \nAll  procurement  for  subprojects  financed  under  the  project  must  be  carried  out  in \n34. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  policy  and  regulations  for  financial  intermediaries. 34 \nProcurement, including the recruitment of consultants, must follow the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas amended from time to time). A procurement capacity assessment of the implementing agency \nand a procurement assessment of private sector commercial practice concluded that the overall \nprocurement risk for the project is moderate since the SGDF concept is being pilot tested. The \nFMC will be responsible for the procurement activities for the capacity development program. \n \n35. \nInvestee  companies  will  undertake  procurement  under  the  loan  in  accordance  with \nestablished  private  sector  or  commercial  procurement  practices  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB. \nInvestee companies may use open competitive bidding for the purchase of large single items or \nin  cases  of  large  quantities  of  goods  for  bulk  purchasing.  All  procurement  will  ensure \n(i) reasonable  prices  as  a  result  of  preferably  competitive  procedures,  (ii)  procurement  from \neligible source countries, and (iii) fair canvassing and/or evaluation. \n \nIntegrity due diligence was conducted on the project stakeholders, especially CCM and \n36. \nSDIHG.35 No  significant  integrity  risks  were  identified.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, SDIHG, and CCM. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote \n15). \n \nE. \n \nThe project is expected to improve the resilience to climate change impacts of 2 million \n37. \npeople in Shandong Province by 2027. Social co-benefits include improved cultural preservation, \nhealth,  and  safety.  ADB  social  development  and  safeguards  policies  need  to  be  addressed \nadequately in the subprojects to ensure community involvement, limit negative health impacts, \nand promotes safety. The project leads to active adoption of climate-positive action and ensures \nthat  investment  benefits  are  shared  by  lower-income  or  vulnerable  groups  in  terms  of \nemployment,  community  participation,  and  quality  of  life.  The  project  includes  an  output  on \ncapacity  development  to  finance  knowledge  products,  workshops,  community  outreach,  and \nspecific education programs designed to meet ADB\u2019s social objectives. Environmental co-benefits \ninclude improved air quality, water and soil quality, and biodiversity. For the SGDF, the output of \n2.5 million tons of CO2eq reduction per year displaces about 10 million tons of coal, resulting in a \nreduction of 80,000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 70,000 tons of sulfur oxide. \n \n38. \nThe project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, with gender-specific indicators in \nthe design and monitoring framework (footnote 18).

This  will  be  the  first  climate  fund  in  the  PRC  that \nsystematically  integrates  gender  equality  considerations  in  the  requirements  for  subproject \nfinancing. Under the SGDF, all proposed subprojects are required to conduct a social analysis \nand  gender  assessment.  As  an  incentive  to  promote  gender  equality  in  climate  financing, \nsubprojects  that  identify  specific  gender  design  features  and  prepare  a  GAP  will  move  to  the \n\u201cadvanced benefits\u201d or \u201ctransformational\u201d category, enabling access to better financial terms. The \nSGDF has set an ambitious target of 50% for projects preparing a GAP, to be financed by the \ninvestee companies with monitoring by the FMC.  \n \nF. \n \n39. \nDue  diligence  findings  show  that,  while  CCM  has  a  strong  record  in  corporate \nenvironmental and social governance, it has no specific environment and social policies in place \nor  dedicated  procedures  beyond  a  requirement  under  national  laws  and  regulations  to  avoid, \nminimize  and mitigate,  or  compensate  the  adverse  impacts  of subprojects  on  the  environment \nand  affected  people.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  an  ESMS \narrangement  has  been  prepared. 36  The  ESMS  arrangement  details:  (i)  the  exclusion  of \nsubprojects  that  fall  under  category  A  for  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement,  and  the \nexclusion of subprojects that fall under categories A and B for indigenous peoples; (ii) setting up \nof  the  FMC,  which  includes  the  establishment  of  a  safeguards  unit  with  two  full-time  staff  and \nresources to strengthen staff capacity; and (iii) the preparation of an ESMS to be agreed between \nADB and the FMC as a condition of the first disbursement.  \n \n40. \nEnvironment  and  involuntary  resettlement  (category  FI).  The  project  excludes \ncategory  A  subprojects  from  financing  by  the  SGDF.  For  category  B  and  C  subprojects,  it  will \nrequire  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval  of  the  required  safeguard  documents  for  the  first  three \nsubprojects or until such time that ADB confirms that the FMC safeguards unit is fully staffed and \nhas  sufficient  capacity  to  do  their  own  due  diligence  and  review  of  safeguards  planning \ndocuments; and any subproject above the limit of \u20ac70 million.37 Semiannual monitoring reports \nand annual consolidated environmental and social reports will be submitted to ADB for review. \n \n41. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  FI-C).  The  project  does  not  target  any  distinct  or \nvulnerable  indigenous  people  groups  and  is  not  expected  to  have  adverse  impacts  on  ethnic \nminority groups. \n \nG. \n \n42. \nThe project preparation for the SGDF with SPG and the cofinanciers provided a robust \ndesign  in  which  risk  management  and  risk  mitigation  are  evaluated.  The  level  of  financial \nmanagement risk that could affect project performance is considered substantial because of the \ngreenfield  nature  of  the  SGDF.  The  MERV  and  the  FMC\u2019s  established  operational  tools  are \nexpected to mitigate most of the risks.
