The first loan, which ADB approved in 2015, focused on policy reforms and strengthening \nregulatory  capacity  in  Hebei  Province. 3 The  second  loan,  approved  in  2016,  targeted  better \naccess to finance, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, to scale up investments in \npollution  reduction  projects  in  the  region.4 The  third  loan,  approved  in  2017,  aimed  to  deploy \nadvanced  technologies  to  reduce  air  pollution  from  large  emitters  in  the  agriculture,  energy, \ntransport, and urban sectors.5 This proposed project will help Shandong Province shift to cleaner \nand  more  efficient  heating  and  cooling  by  integrating  various  clean  and  renewable  energy \nsources.6 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  greater  BTH  region  is  one  of  the  most  important  economic  regions  in  the  PRC, \ngenerating about one-third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. However, it also has a dense \npopulation  and  a  high  concentration  of  energy-intensive  and  highly  polluting  industries,  which \nresult  in  widespread  air  pollution. 7 Cities  in  the  greater  BTH  region  consistently  top  country \nrankings for the highest concentrations of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter \n(PM2.5)  and  other  air  pollutants.  Exposure  to  high  levels  of  PM2.5  and  other  air  pollutants  is \nassociated with health risks such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease, which contribute to \nmore than 1 million premature deaths annually in the PRC. \n\n                                                \n1  The original core Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region refers to Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and Hebei Province. \nDue to air pollution\u2019s transboundary impact, in 2017, the government extended the core BTH region to its surrounding \nregions.  The  greater  BTH  region  includes  the  original  core  BTH  region  and  its  surrounding  regions  of  Henan, \nLiaoning, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces; and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n\n2   Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n3  ADB. 2015.

Country \n\nOperations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2018\u20132020. Manila.  \n\n7  More than 50% of the PRC\u2019s pollution-intensive steel and cement production capacity, about 33% of the PRC\u2019s cars \n\nand other automobiles, and about 28% of the PRC population are concentrated in the greater BTH region. \n\n\f2 \n\nShandong Province, as part of the greater BTH region, consistently experiences poor air \n4. \nquality  that  is  attributable  to  an  overreliance  on  coal  as  an  energy  source  for  heavy  industry, \nelectricity, and heating. The province is the PRC\u2019s largest coal consumer, deriving 79.3% of its \nprimary energy mix from coal. Whereas coal consumption in the PRC peaked in 2013 and started \nto decline, Shandong Province\u2019s coal consumption increased substantially from 364.7 million tons \nin 2011 to 409.3 million tons in 2015.8 High levels of coal consumption, particularly by industry \nand urban and rural households, are the main contributors to poor air quality in the province. In \n2016, Jinan city had the highest concentration of PM2.5 attributable to coal use among 74 major \ncities in the PRC, and it ranked ninth in the province for the poorest air quality. Jinan Municipal \nBureau of Environmental Protection measured the annual average concentration of PM2.5 in 2016 \nat  73  micrograms  per  cubic  meter  (\u03bcg/m\u00b3),  which  is  more  than  double  the  category  II  national \nambient air quality standards.9 In Jinan, the annual concentration of PM2.5 specifically attributable \nto coal use is 52 \u03bcg/m3, about 70% of total PM2.5 concentration levels. During winter, even higher \nlevels\u201461  \u03bcg/m3  or  84%\u2014of  PM2.5  emissions  are  attributable  to  coal  use. 10  Emissions  are \nexacerbated  during  winter  by  the  burning  of  raw  coal  by  households  for  heating.  The  health \nimpacts of raw coal burning are more severe because of direct inhalation and the poor quality and \nhigh sulphuric content of the coal.  \n \n5. \nThe  Government  of  the  PRC  has  made  air  quality  improvement  a  national  priority  and \nviews restructuring the energy mix as the key to realizing this objective. This is consistent with \nthe climate change mitigation specified in the PRC\u2019s intended nationally determined contributions. \nThe PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan sets strict air quality measures and targets on PM2.5, sulfur \ndioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds nationally, and for the BTH \nregion.  In  support  of  the  government\u2019s  efforts  on  air  quality  improvement,  ADB  contributed, \ntargeted, and coordinated financing of $1.3 billion (footnotes 3, 4, and 5) and the World Bank did \nthe same for $1.0 billion. In 2017, the Ministry of Environmental Protection introduced the Work \nProgram for Air Pollution Control in the BTH Region and Its Surrounding Areas.11 The program \naims  to  implement  strict  pollution  control  measures  in  28  cities,  of  which  7  are  in  Shandong \nProvince.  The  program  emphasizes  the  importance  of  reducing  winter  raw  coal  burning  for \nheating supply in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas of the greater BTH region. \n \n6. \nThe  Shandong  Provincial  Government  has  also  committed  to  improving  air  quality.  In \n2012,  it  published the  Action  Plan for  Air  Pollution  Control for  2013\u20132020.12 The  plan  targeted \nreducing  annual  average  PM2.5  concentration  levels  to  49  \u03bcg/m\u00b3  by  2020.  To  meet  this  target \nShandong  Province  must  reduce  its  coal  consumption.  Opportunities  include  exploiting  the \nprovince\u2019s  abundant  geothermal  resources,  agricultural  waste,  and  waste  heat  from  heavy \nindustries. \n \n7. \nThe proposed project responds directly to the urgent national, provincial, and municipal \ngovernment priorities to reduce coal consumption and improve air quality. This will be achieved \n                                                \n8  Y. Zhang, C. Liu, K. Li, and Y. Zhou. 2018.

The proposed project is well-aligned with the priorities \nof broadening the response to climate change and strengthening environmental sustainability in \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.14 It will also support key strategic \npriorities  of  (i)  tackling  climate  change  by  using  advanced  technologies  to  accelerate  low \ngreenhouse gas emissions development and ensure environmental sustainability, (ii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality through gender mainstreaming activities, and (iii) making cities more \nlivable  through  air  quality  improvement  resulting  in  safer  and  healthier  urban  environment  for \nresidents, as prescribed in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.15  \n \n8. \nADB\u2019s value addition and lessons from previous operations. Air quality improvement \nrequires coordinated interventions with different coverage and approaches. Unlike the first three \nprojects  in  ADB\u2019s  multiyear,  multisector  support  to  the  PRC  for  air  quality  improvement,  this \nproposed  project  uses  the  project  loan  modality.  Past  projects  used  the  financial  intermediary \nmodality because the subprojects they supported were spread among many sectors that required \ndifferent  business  models  and  financing  structures.  The  project  loan  modality  is  appropriate \nbecause  the  proposed  project  is  narrowly  focused  on  the  heating  and  cooling  industry  in  a \nconcentrated  geographic  area,  which  can  result  in  effective  and  efficient  delivery  of  project \noutcomes  and  large  pollution  reductions  in  a  locality.  The  proposed clean  heating  and cooling \nsolutions will be a pilot in the PRC, with a large potential to be scaled up and duplicated in similar \nregions within and outside the country. ADB will organize technical knowledge exchange sessions \nduring  project  implementation  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies  and \ndisseminate knowledge and lessons from this project to other developing member countries that \nface similar challenges in relation to cooling and heating. \n \nInnovative features. The proposed project demonstrates advanced heating and cooling \n9. \ntechnologies with an innovative business model to deliver improved and efficient heating solutions \nto rural households in a cost-effective manner. The project utilizes government incentives to lower \nthe  upfront  costs  of  heating  solutions  for  rural  households,  while  capitalizing  on  the  technical \nexpertise of the heating company to identify, manage, and deliver the most appropriate heating \nsolutions to households and enabling the company to sustainably expand its service area to semi-\nurban and rural areas around Jinan city. The project combines renewable energy technologies \nand waste heat recovered from industry and power plants and applies supply- and demand-side \nenergy efficiency measures. This will reduce the energy and carbon intensity of heat production \nand refrigeration, and thereby reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: air pollution reduced and public health in \nthe greater BTH region improved (consistent with the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan).16 The project will \n                                                \n13 The project will use advanced technologies for heating and cooling such as large temperature difference waste heat \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nexchange, deep-well geothermal district heating, ice-storage air conditioning, and distributed heat pumps.   \n\n14  ADB.  2016.

The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the \nform  of  office  accommodation,  logistics,  and  facilities  and  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff; \nstudies,  reports,  data,  other  information  and  support  needed  for  the  TA;  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nSubproject 1: West Jinan Waste Heat Utilization and Clean Energy Subproject. This \nsubproject  will  provide  heat  to  urban  residents  and  industrial  and  business  customers.  The \ntechnologies to be used on the project include the following: (i) JTPC will adopt large temperature \ndifference waste heat exchange technology for transporting waste heat from the nearby power \nplants to the city. This technology has a higher heat transport capacity and lower heat losses over \nlong distances than current networks. JTPC will use the waste heat to supply heating to about 80 \nmillion m2 of buildings. (ii) JTPC needs to provide year-round heat supply to an industrial park \nlocated  in  west  Jinan.  A  biomass-based  combined  heating  and  power  plant  using  biomass \nbriquette  will  supply  heating  to  1.54  million  m2  of  buildings  and  will  generate  electricity  of  133 \ngigawatt-hour  per  year.  A  feedstock  assessment  showed  that  the  biomass  plant  will  consume \nonly 12% of the available agriculture waste. (iii) Jinan is endowed with geothermal resources. The \n\n                                                \n20 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fsubproject  will  use  deep-well  reinjection  technology  to  extract  and  exchange  heat  from  the \nunderground  water,  which  will  then  be  filtered  and  recharged  to  the  same  aquifer,  and  (iv) \nDistributed  gas-fired  boilers  will  be  used  to  supply  heat  to  a  few  newly  built  residential \ncommunities  not  covered  by  the  heating  network  and  where  geothermal  resources  are  not \navailable. This  subproject  will  enable  Jinan to fully  utilize  waste  heat  in neighboring  regions to \nform  a  waste-heat-dominated  heating  system  with  a  supplementary  distributed  energy  supply \nfrom biomass, geothermal energy, and natural gas. \n \nSubproject  2:  Shanghe  Coal-Free  Clean  Heating  Demonstration  Subproject.  This \n26. \nsubproject  covers  the  urban  area  of  Shanghe  County,  the  semi-urban  area  of  11  towns,  and \n80,000  rural  households  where  coal-fired  stoves  or  coal-fired  boilers  are  commonly  used  for \nspace  heating. The  subproject  will  use geothermal  energy  as the main heat  source  to  replace \ncoal-fired  heating.  Other  clean  options,  such  as  air-source  heat  pumps,  will  be  selected  as \ndistributed heating sources where the pipeline network is not available. Gas-fired boilers will be \ninstalled as an auxiliary heat source. This subproject also plans to retrofit 660,400 m2 of urban \nbuildings and 30,000 rural households to improve their energy efficiency. JHG will replace heavily \npolluting coal-fired stoves in 80,000 rural households by air-to-air heat pumps, air-to-water heat \npumps, heat-storage radiators, carbon crystal plate radiators, and small household gas heaters.21 \nThis subproject will play an important role in, and have demonstration effect to, other counties in \nthe northern PRC that face similar air quality issues caused by the winter heating.   \n \n27. \nSubproject  3:  East  Jinan  Low-Emission  Combined  District  Heating  and  Cooling \nSubproject. The central business district is located in east Jinan. The large heating and cooling \ndemands of this area require a low-emission system that can supply both heat and cooling. For \nheating  supply,  east  Jinan  will  have  two  options:  (i)  industrial  waste  heat  supplied  via  a  long-\ndistance pipeline to heat 6.2 million m2 buildings; and (ii) electrode boilers with heat storage that \nwill use off-peak electricity at night, and then deliver hot water to the households in the daytime \nto heat an area of up to 700,000 m2. For district cooling, the subproject will adopt two technologies: \n(i) ice storage, which uses off-peak electricity during the night and stores the cooling energy in \nthe form of ice that is melted to provide cooling during peak daytime hours and when the cooling \ndemand is large enough; and (ii) a lithium bromide absorption chiller, driven by waste heat from \nthe  power  plant,  to  deliver  cold  water  to  consumers  through  long-distance  pipelines.  The \nsubproject  aims  to  expand  the  area  of  waste  heat  supply,  and  at  the  same  time  use  off-peak \nelectricity to produce and store heating and cooling capacity to improve waste heat utilization and \nshift load from peak.  \n \n28. \n \nB. \n \nADB estimated the economic internal rate of return of 43.0% for subproject 1, 33.2% for \n29. \nsubproject 2, and 14.2% for subproject 3, with the environmental benefits well above the 6.0% \neconomic cost of capital, making the project economically viable. Sensitivity testing indicated that \nthe project is likely to remain sustainable even in the face of adverse economic impacts of various \ntypes. The economic analysis considered all the project-related costs, benefits from cost savings \nresulting  from  the  use  of  alternative  fuels  and  system  efficiency  improvements,  and  local  and \n                                                \n21 Among them, 60,000 households will use air-to-air heat pumps with CNY4,500 capital subsidy from the government, \n10,000 households will use air-to-water heat pumps with CNY9,000 capital subsidy, 6,000 households will use heat-\nstorage  radiators  with  CNY2,000  capital  subsidy,  3,000  households  will  install  carbon  crystal  plate  radiators  and \n1,000 households have access to gas pipeline will install small household gas heaters each with CNY2,000 capital \nsubsidy from the government.  \n\nThe technical due diligence confirmed the viability of the subprojects.  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nglobal  environmental  benefits.  Global  environmental  benefits  from  carbon  dioxide  (CO2) \nabatement are valued at the 2016 global social cost of carbon of $36.3 per ton of CO2, adjusted \nto 2018 price levels, and increased annually by 2%. Local environmental benefits from pollution \nemission  abatement  are  valued  by  estimating  the  cost  of  premature  mortality  (labor  loss) \nassociated with the pollutants. The project will generate revenue from the sale of heat, electricity, \nsteam, and cooling, and from the service connection fees collected from customers in the project \nareas. Financial analysis of the project indicated a financial internal rate of return of 8.40% for \nsubproject 1, 6.71% for subproject 2, and 14.27% for subproject 3. The financial internal rates of \nreturn exceed the weighted average cost of capital of 2.02% for subproject 1, 1.67% for subproject \n2, and 1.84% for subproject 3. Sensitivity analysis showed the project is likely to remain financially \nviable under several potential adverse scenarios. \n \nC. \n \n30. \nFinancial  management  assessment.  ADB  conducted  the  financial  management \nassessment  following  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects. 22  The  result \nshowed that JHG and JTPC have adequate financial management systems and procedures in \nplace to meet ADB requirements. However, neither of them is familiar with ADB\u2019s disbursement \nprocedures, and this may delay the disbursements.23 To address the risk, ADB trained JHG and \nJTPC staff on disbursement during project preparation. ADB will provide more training programs \nduring implementation. To mitigate the potential risks, financial leverage for JHG and JTPC should \nbe controlled below 80% and both companies should set aside a mandatory reserve in a separate \nbank account equivalent to 1% of their ADB loan amount. JHG and JTPC will report the status of \ntheir reserve account in their regular monitoring report. ADB rated the financial management risk \nbefore mitigation moderate. \n \n31. \nProcurement risk assessment. An assessment of the procurement capacity of JHG and \nJTPC  showed  they  have  skilled  and  experienced  staff  and  well-established  procedures  and \nsystems needed to manage procurement in a manner consistent with ADB\u2019s requirements.24 Staff \nfrom JHG and JTPC received three training programs during project preparation. JHG and JTPC \nhave experience in international competitive bidding for other projects financed by international \ndevelopment partners. They will also hire a qualified procurement consultant and a procurement \nagent to further strengthen their capacity to carry out ADB-related procurement. \n  \n32. \nCorruption  prevention.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  JHG,  and  JTPC.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.25 ADB conducted integrity \ndue diligence and did not identify any significant integrity risk.  \n \nD. \n \n33. \nSocial benefits. The project will directly benefit 646,815 households or 1,988,011 people \nin  the  project  area  by  providing  clean  heating  and  cooling. 26 About  996,119  of  the  intended \nbeneficiaries  are  women  and  about  2,091  of  the  households  are  headed  by  poor  women.  In \naddition,  the  project  will  supply  clean  heating  to  educational  institutions,  hospitals,  and  elderly \ncare centers in the project area. There are about 35,860 children in 29 schools and kindergartens, \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n23 Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Project Procurement Risk Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n25 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 This is equivalent to 31.4% of the total population of Jinan city. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fabout 440 patients and medical staff in 9 hospitals, and 729 elderly people and caregivers in 8 \nelderly  care  centers.  The  shift  from  dirty  coal-based  heating  and  cooling  to  cleaner  and  safer \ntechnologies  supported  by  the  proposed  project  will  (i)  reduce  cases  of  respiratory  diseases \nthrough  improved  indoor  and  outdoor  air  quality;  (ii)  reduce  carbon  monoxide  poisoning  by \nproviding safer heating and cooking fuel; (iii) provide a better medical environment by installing \ncleaner and more reliable heating services; (iv) improve living conditions through adequate and \nreliable heating services; (v) reduce fuel expenditure on heating and cooking by switching from \nindividual household coal-based stoves; (vi) provide a more comfortable schooling environment \nduring  the  winter  by  supplying  cleaner  and  more  reliable  heating  services;  and  (vii)  increase \nincome  through  job  opportunities  created  during  construction.  These  benefits  will  contribute \ndirectly  to  Sustainable  Development  Goals  3,  5,  7,  and  11. 27  The  government  will  provide \nsubsidies for the installation of clean heating systems under the project so that poor households \nwill be able to choose and install the affordable clean energy heating system free of charge. \n \n34. \nGender  impact.  Women  in  project  sites  have  the  main  responsibility  for  the  use  and \nmaintenance of coal stoves and are disproportionally affected by the resulting in-door air pollution. \nBy  switching  the  type  of  energy  used  in  cooking  and  heating,  the  project  will  directly  affect \nwomen\u2019s health outcomes. The project will enable the sharp reduction in time spent by beneficiary \nwomen on unpaid household work related to the preparation of household energy for heating from \na  current  average  of  2.75  hours  to  less  than  1  hour.  This  will  allow  more  time  for  productive \nactivities and self-development, which could lead to increased income.   \n \n35. \nThe project is categorized as Effective Gender Mainstreaming. The project will (i) provide \naccess  to  clean  heating  for  about  2,091  households  headed  by  poor  women;  (ii)  improve  the \ntechnical capacity of JHG and JTPC women staff on the operation and maintenance of the new \nfacilities through training (at least 40% are women), (iii) ensure that women are employed in skilled \nand unskilled jobs generated by the project during construction and operation (at least 700 jobs \nfor women); (iv) conduct campaigns to raise awareness of the environmental and health benefits \nof  clean  energy  (at  least  40%  of  the  participants  are  women);  (v)  ensure  the  participation  of \nwomen  in  consultations  during  project  implementation  (at  least  40%  of  the  participants  are \nwomen);  and  (vi)  ensure  that  the  design  of  services  is  gender-sensitive.  The  project  will \nencourage JHG and JTPC to conduct a corporate gender analysis, which could lead to the drafting \nof a corporate gender action plan for JHG and JTPC during project implementation. The project \nwill encourage JHG and JTPC to adopt an appropriate gender policy under its corporate social \nresponsibility program with support from the TA.  \n \nE. \n \n36. \ncategories are as follows.28 \n \n37. \nEnvironment (category  A). ADB prepared an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \nand  initial  environmental  examinations,  including  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs) \nfollowing  national  environmental  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). \nPotential impacts during construction, including noise and dust emissions, construction waste and \nwastewater,  community  and  public  safety  disturbances,  and  risks  to  occupational  health  and \nsafety  are  mostly  temporary,  predictable,  and  reversible,  and  can  be  mitigated  through  the \nimplementation of the EMPs. Potential adverse environmental impacts during operation include \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n27 United Nations. Sustainable Development Goals. \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fSO2, particulate matter less than 10 micrometers in diameter, PM2.5, and NOx emissions; noise; \nsolid and hazardous waste; wastewater discharge; risks of fire and well blowout; and risks to the \ncommunity and occupational health and safety. JHG and JTPC will use low-NOx burners. Exhaust \ngas  will  be  treated  by  selective  noncatalytic reduction  denitrification  system, magnesium  oxide \ndesulfurization system, cyclone dust collector, and bag filter, and emitted through a 100-meter \nstack. The residual emissions will be offset by shutting down existing coal boilers and household \nstoves. Air quality modeling results show that the biomass-based combined heat and power plant \ncomponent  will  have  negligible  impacts  on  air  quality.  The  implementation  of  the  EMPs  and \nadherence  to  national  regulations  will  mitigate  other  impacts.  Sensitive  ecosystems  will  not  be \naffected.  JHG  and  JTPC  has  allocated  sufficient  budgets  in  the  EMPs  to  ensure  proper \nimplementation  of  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures.  The  borrower  has  committed  to \ndeveloping  an  emergency  response  plan  in  case  of  fire  and  well  blowout.  JHG  and  JTPC  will \nestablish  an  environmental  and  social  safeguard  unit  under  the  project  management  office  to \nimplement  the  mitigation  measures  stated  in  the  EIA,  initial  environmental  examinations,  and \nEMPs. The project management office will hire an independent loan implementation consultant \nto  support  in  implementing  the  EMPs.  JHG  and  JTPC  obtained  domestic  EIA  approvals  from \nrelevant environmental protection bureaus for all subprojects. \n \n38. \nJHG and JTPC have carried out meaningful consultations with the public. JHG and JTPC \nhave agreed on a set of environment-related loan covenants and have committed themselves to \nparticipating in training programs that will place a heavy emphasis on environmental safeguards. \nADB  disclosed  the  environment  safeguard  documents  to  the  affected  people  and  on  the  ADB \nwebsite.29 Potential environmental complaints or disputes will be handled following the grievance \nredress  mechanism  established  for  the  project.  JHG  and  JTPC  will  submit  environmental \nmonitoring reports to ADB semiannually during construction and annually during operation. The \npotential  climate  risks  to  the  project  components  are  high.  ADB  is  conducting  a  climate  risk \nassessment and will incorporate the findings of the assessment in the project design.  \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). The proposed project does not entail permanent \n39. \nor temporary physical or economic displacement as (i) heat exchange stations will use existing \nspace  in  residential  communities  and  buildings  that  is  reserved  for  the  construction  of  public \nfacilities; (ii) heating and cooling pipelines will be laid underground within the existing right of way \nor along roadways; (iii) the biomass-based combined heat and power plant will be built on existing \nstate-owned land that has already been acquired; (iv) geothermal and natural gas energy stations \nwill  be  constructed  in  the  existing  vacant  and  reserved  space  inside  government  buildings, \nresidential communities, and schools; and (v) clean heating facilities, such as heat pumps and \ndistributed natural gas boilers, will be constructed on the vacant state-owned land or in existing \nbuildings. ADB carried out due diligence for the associated facilities and for components where \nland acquisition had already been completed, and found no outstanding issues. \n \n40. \non ethnic minorities as the project site is not near any ethnic minority towns or villages. \n \n41. \n Environmental  benefits.  Compared  to  traditional  coal-based  heating  and  cooling \nsystems, the facilities build by the project will emit about 90.0% less CO2, 90.6% less NOx, 96.0% \nless SO2, and 87.5% less PM2.5. The use of waste heat and renewable energy sources will reduce \nthe annual consumption of coal by about 1.37 million tons. This will prevent the emission of about \n3.99 million tons of CO2, 5,347 tons of SO2, 4,536 tons of NOx, and 1,430 tons of PM2.5. \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C).

Especially \nadverse  foreign  exchange  rate  movements \nimpact  the  profitability  of  JTPC  and  JHG  and \nreduce their debt service capability.  \n\nUnfamiliarity with ADB procurement guidelines \nresults \npotential \nin \nimplementation delays. \n\nirregularities \n\nand \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe  financial  leverage  of  JHG  and  JTPC  should  be  controlled \nbelow 80%. This will be included in the loan covenants. \nThe  attached  TA  is  designed  to  strengthen  the  knowledge  and \nunderstanding of JHG and JTPC in advanced heating and cooling \ntechnologies. \nJHG and JTPC are financially stable with reliable cashflows. Both \nJHG and JTPC should set aside a mandatory reserve in a separate \nbank account equivalent to 1% of their ADB loan amount to mitigate \nthe  foreign exchange and  interest mismatch  risks.  The  money  in \nthe reserve account can only be used for making up the loss arising \nfrom the risks. JHG and JTPC will report the status of their reserve \naccount in their regular monitoring report.  \nADB  will  provide  capacity  training  on  ADB  requirements  and \nprocedures for procurement to ensure that procurement follows the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, JHG = Jinan Heating Group, JTPC = Jinan Thermal Power Co., Ltd., TA = technical \nassistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n43. \nThe  Government  of  the  PRC  and  the  Shandong  Provincial  Government  have  assured \nADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting \nservices, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \nThe Government of the PRC and the Shandong Provincial Government have agreed with \n44. \nADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  and \nproject agreement. \n \n\nVI. \n\n RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n45. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n\u20ac350,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Air Quality Improvement in the Greater \nBeijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  Region\u2014Shandong  Clean  Heating  and  Cooling  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n\n22 November 2018 \n                                                \n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n \nAir pollution reduced and public health in the BTH region improved (Thirteenth Five-Year Plan).a \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nEmissions of pollutants \nand carbon dioxide in \nShandong Province \nreduced \n\n \n\nAppendix 1     13  \n\nRisks \n\n \nAn unanticipated shift in \ngovernment priorities \nleads to fewer air pollution \ncontrol projects \n\nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and \nBaselines \n\n \nBy 2025: \na.
