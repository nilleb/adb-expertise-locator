In addition, to support the high-impact \nenergy  efficiency  and  emission  reduction  initiatives  in  large  enterprises,  the  platform  will  also \nfocus on directing investments to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nNational  plan  for  energy  savings  and  emission  reduction.  The  PRC  is  the  largest \nenergy  consumer  in  the  world.  In  2014,  it  accounted  for  21%  of  global  energy  consumption.2 \nThe highly energy-intensive and coal-dominated economic structure has taken a heavy toll on \nthe PRC\u2019s natural environment and has become the major cause for the country\u2019s high levels of \ngreenhouse gas emissions and air and water pollution. To tackle this problem, the Government \nof the PRC has made promoting environmentally sustainable growth a key priority. \n \n4. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  contains  specific  measures  and \ntargets  to  decouple  economic  growth  from  energy  consumption  and  carbon  emissions,  boost \nthe share of nonfossil energy in primary energy consumption, and reduce the release of major \nair pollutants.3 These targets will contribute to the PRC\u2019s nationally determined commitment to \nreducing the carbon intensity by 60%\u201365% by 2030, compared with 2005, and achieve carbon \npeaking  by  2030  or  earlier.  The  national  energy-saving  targets  were  disaggregated  and \nallocated  to  the  provinces.  The  government  is  providing  additional  incentives  to  western \nprovinces that are heavily dependent on coal and energy-intensive industries to reduce energy \nintensity. \n \nEnergy  savings  and  emission  reduction  in  Shaanxi  Province.  Shaanxi  Province, \n5. \nlocated in the western part of the PRC, is a major producer of coal, oil, and natural gas, and its \nindustrial  structure  heavily  relies  on  these  fossil  fuels  as  feedstock  and  as  an  energy  source. \nAlthough the province reduced its energy intensity by 16.3% during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \n2011\u20132015,  and  industrial  energy  intensity  by  18.6%,  this  was  achieved  by  mainly  targeting \nlarge  enterprises.  Shaanxi  Province  aims  to  reduce  energy  intensity  by  an  additional  15%  by \n2020,  compared  with  2015.  It  has  significant  untapped  opportunities  to  reduce  the  energy \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   International Energy Agency. 2016. Key World Energy Statistics. Paris.  \n3  Reduce energy intensity by 15% and carbon intensity by 18% (energy use and carbon emissions per unit of gross \ndomestic  product)  by  2020,  compared  with  2015,  and  increase  the  share  of  nonfossil  fuel  in  primary  energy \nconsumption from 12% in 2015 to 15% by 2020, and reduce the share of coal in primary energy consumption from \n66% in 2015 to 62% by 2020. Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform \nCommission. 2015. Outline of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Beijing (adopted in 2016). \n\n \n  \n \n\n \n\n\fintensity and air pollution caused by SMEs because these were not targeted under the Twelfth \nFive-Year Plan. \n \n6. \nMany  SMEs  in  Shaanxi  Province  are  engaged  in  energy-intensive  industries  such  as \ncoal  based  chemicals,  nonferrous  metals,  ceramic  materials,  building  materials,  and  industrial \nwaste  recycling.  What's  more,  they  rely  on  traditional  and  particularly  energy-intensive \ntechnologies.  While  SMEs  have  significant  scope  to  reduce  their  energy  intensity  and  air \npollution by recovering waste heat from industrial processes and making use of industrial gases \nfor productive purposes, their lack of knowledge about such technologies, weak understanding \nof cost\u2013benefit evaluation, and difficulties in accessing commercial credit have kept them from \nseizing  these  opportunities.  Energy  service  companies (ESCOs),  which  are  more  familiar  with \nmodern technologies and the packaging of energy efficiency investments, are particularly suited \nto  drive  energy  efficiency  and  technology  enhancements  in  SMEs.  However,  ESCOs  are  an \nunderdeveloped industry in Shaanxi and also find it difficult to access commercial credit. \n \n7. \nShaanxi  Province  also  intends  to  increase  the  installed  capacity  of  renewable  energy \nfrom 7.5 gigawatts in 2015 to 20 gigawatts by 2020, to diversify its electricity generation mix and \ngenerate about 19% of total electricity from renewable sources. Most of the capacity addition is \nlikely  to  be  from  distributed  renewable  energy  applications,  such  as  solar  photovoltaic  plants \nlocated in barren lands with low agricultural productivity and the use of geothermal and biomass \nfor heat supply. \n \n8. \nEnergy  efficiency  hurdles  in  Shaanxi.  Despite  the  past  progress  in  reducing  energy \nintensity,  further  improvements  are  difficult  because  the  recent  policy  approach  to  more \nmoderate  economic  growth  in  the  PRC  and  the  sharp  reduction  in  prices  for  coal  and  coal-\nbased  industrial  products  have  eroded  the  profitability  and  creditworthiness  of  industrial \nenterprises, which in turn undermines their willingness to borrow and invest in energy efficiency \nimprovements. This, combined with the government\u2019s efforts to move away from providing direct \nfiscal subsidies to energy efficiency investments and instead enable local financial institutions to \nprovide  suitable  financing  tools  and  financing  products,  hampers  further  investment  flows  into \nenergy efficiency efforts by large industrial enterprises and SMEs alike. \n \nFinancial barriers to energy efficiency investments. Although investments in energy \n9. \nefficiency  improvements  offer  attractive  returns,  SMEs  and  ESCOs  find  it  difficult  to  mobilize \nfinancing for such investments for the following reasons: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nCommercial  banks  are  reluctant  to  finance  discrete  and  small  investments  by \ndifferent enterprises.  \nSMEs  are  reluctant  to  pledge  their  limited  assets  to  borrow  for  relatively  small \nenergy efficiency investments. \nTaking  security  over  the  energy  efficiency  assets  is  difficult  because  of  their \ndispersed nature. \nInvestments are relatively small but technically complex. \nBanks are unfamiliar with structuring cash flow-based, limited-recourse financing \nfor energy efficiency investments. \n\nThe  proposed  CEFP  in  Shaanxi  Province  is  designed  to  help  overcome  the  financial \n\n \n10. \nbarriers faced by SMEs and ESCOs.  \n \nRationale for financial intermediation loan modality. The government requested the \n11. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to design the project and to establish the provincial CEFP so \nas  to  mobilize  domestic  financing  for  investments  in  energy  efficiency,  distributed  renewable \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fInnovative  features \n\nin  project  design.  The  proposed  CEFP  will  offer \n\nenergy,  and  environmental  improvements  in  Shaanxi  Province  by  leveraging  ADB  loan \nproceeds. The financial intermediation loan (FIL) modality enables ADB and the government to \nestablish  partnerships  with  local  commercial  banks  and  financial  institutions  so  as  to  channel \nfunding  resources  to  small  or  medium-scale  clean  energy  investments  for  which  the  financing \nrequirements  are  not  large  enough  to  warrant  direct  lending  by  ADB.  ADB  funds  will  leverage \nfinancing  from  participating  commercial  banks  and  other  financial  institutions,  and  enable \nfinancing of eligible energy efficiency investments on commercial terms. \n \nthree \n12. \ncomplementary financial products: (i) debt financing facility to provide entrusted loans,4 (ii) credit \nguarantee  facility  to  leverage  cofinancing,  and  (iii)  lease  financing  facility  for  the  purchase  of \nenergy efficient industrial equipment. The CEFP will partner with two commercial banks active in \nShaanxi  Province  to  offer  entrusted  loans,  and  the  partner  banks  are  encouraged  to  provide \ncofinancing to match at least the ADB loan proceeds. The guarantee facility will provide credit \nguarantees  to  technically  sound  subprojects  with  high  energy-saving  potential  but  lacking  in \ncollateral  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  commercial  banks  for  the  provision  of  cofinancing. \nThis  facility  is  likely  to  be  particularly  useful  for  ESCO  and  SME  borrowers.  The  CEFP  will \nprovide credit enhancement to the guarantees provided by Shaanxi SME Financing Guarantee \nCompany5 by making a cash deposit of not more than 20% of the guaranteed cofinancing loan \namount in the beneficiary bank of the guarantee. This will ensure that the guarantee facility will \nhave  a  minimum  leveraging  ratio  of  5.6 For  subprojects  that  require  the  purchase  of  energy \nefficient equipment, ADB loan proceeds can be provided as lease financing through a financial \nleasing company. \n \nAs energy efficiency investments have a short payback period, the subloans to be made \n13. \nusing the debt facility are expected to have a loan repayment period of 3\u20138 years. As the initial \nbatch of subloans is repaid, the proceeds will be relent to another batch of subprojects. For this \npurpose,  a  reflow  account  will  be  established  to  receive  the  repayments  of  the  entrusted \nsubloans  as  well  as  the  reflows  from  cash  collateral  supporting  the  credit  guarantees.  It  is \nexpected that the ADB loan proceeds will be reutilized at least twice before the loan is repaid.7 \n \n14. \nADB value addition. The project demonstrates a high degree of ADB value addition by \nstructuring  an  innovative  financing  vehicle  for  investments  in  energy  efficiency  and  distributed \nrenewable energy in Shaanxi Province. This includes:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ncapacity  building  of  domestic  financial  institutes  by  jointly  undertaking  technical \nand  environmental  as  well  as  financial  due  diligence  on  energy  efficiency \ninvestments by SMEs; \ndemonstrating how a credit guarantee facility can be structured using part of loan \nfunds  as  a  cash  collateral  to  support  credit  guarantees  to  mobilize  additional \nfinancial resources from commercial banks; \nencouraging  commercial    banks  to  offer  financing  secured  on  energy  efficiency \nequipment \nthose  projects \nimplemented by ESCOs) attributable to energy savings achieved. This would be a \n\nfinanced  using  subloans  or  cash \n\nflows  (for \n\n                                                 \n4  Entrusted loan is the provision of funds by a nonbanking commercial entity to a commercial bank to be onlent to \ndesignated  borrowers.  The  commercial  bank\u2019s  role  is  limited  to  disbursing  the  loans  to  designated  borrowers, \nkeeping  custody  of  collateral,  collecting  loan  repayments,  and  liquidating  collateral  in  the  event  of  default  by  a \nborrower. The credit risk remains with the provider of funds and not with the commercial bank. \n\n5   This company was selected by SPG based on their track record in providing credit guarantees to SMEs.  \n6  The ratio of the total amount of loans guaranteed by the guarantee fund to the special reserve fund. \n7  The duration of the ADB loan will be 15 years. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ndeparture  from  the  current  practice  of  requiring  real  estate  collateral  or  corporate \nguarantees from the parent company. \nprovision of credit lines to ESCOs  and financial leasing companies to finance a \nseries of energy-saving investments; \nsetting up partnerships with reputed local engineering design and environmental \ninstitutes to bring in technical capacity to undertake technical due diligence; and \nestablishing and implementing an environmental and social management system \n(ESMS) to build the capacity of commercial  banks and the project implementing \nagency,  for  ensuring  that  the  subprojects  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) requirements. \n \n\n15. \nLessons  from  previous  projects. The lessons learnt from previous ADB FIL projects \nfor  energy  efficiency  improvement  in  the  PRC  include  inadequate  credit  risk  transfer  to \ncommercial banks, selection of subborrowers by local government officials, absence of market \nbased  pricing  of  subloans  and  excessive  reliance  on  fixed  assets  collateral.8 In  addition,  there \nwere no credit enhancement and risk sharing mechanisms to encourage commercial banks to \nextend  financing  to  SME  and  ESCO  subborrowers.  These  lessons  have  been  incorporated  to \nthe  project  design  through  innovative  features  described  in  para.  12  and  ADB  value  addition \ndescribed in para. 14. In addition, the credit risk and credit approval have been transferred from \nthe provincial governments to commercial organizations such as SFHG and commercial banks \nbased on the lessons learnt from the previous FIL projects in the PRC.  \n \n16. \nThe  project  directly  contributes  to  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy, \n(2016\u20132020)  for  the  PRC\u2014i.e.,  supporting  the  \u201cecological  civilization\u201d  objective  of  the \ngovernment  through  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  pollution  control,  resource  recycling, \nclimate  change  mitigation,  energy  efficiency  improvement,  and  increased  use  of  renewable \nenergy.  The  project  is  also  fully  consistent  with  the  13th  plan  (footnote  2)  of  the  national  and \nprovincial  governments  to  achieve  energy  conservation,  emission  reduction,  and  industrial \ntransformation and to deepen access to finance for emerging industries and SMEs. \n \nB. \n \nThe impact will be that energy intensity and emissions in Shaanxi Province are reduced. \n17. \nThe outcome will be that financing barriers to clean energy investments in Shaanxi Province are \nreduced. \n \nC. \n \n18. \nOutput  1:  Clean  energy  financing  platform  for  financing  energy-saving  and \nemission-reduction investments in Shaanxi Province is established. As highlighted in para \n11, the proposed CEFP will offer three complementary financial products to meet the financing \nrequirements of eligible clean energy investments. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB  2008.

The  first  batch  of \nsubprojects  to  be  supported  will  include  (i)  industrial  waste  heat  recovery  and  utilization  for \nelectricity  generation  and  heat  supply,  (ii)  heat  supply  energy  efficiency  improvement,  (iii) \ndistributed solar photovoltaics, (iv) biogas and biofuel recovery for agriculture waste, (v) use of \nwaste gases from industrial processes for power generation, (vi) use of geothermal energy for \nheat  supply  for  residential  areas,  (vii)  retrofit  of  industrial  processes  with  highly  efficient \nequipment, and (viii) energy efficiency improvements in buildings and public facilities. Some of \nthese  subprojects  may  be  implemented  using  energy  management  or  build-own-operate \ncontracts. These subprojects will result in substantial energy (i.e. coal) savings and reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  first  batch  of  subprojects  is  estimated  to  be  $459.0  million, \n(Table 1), which includes the financial charges on entrusted loans and an estimated amount of \ncommercial bank loans. Cofinancing of $167.6 million will be mobilized on a collaborative basis \nfrom  commercial  banks,  including  the  two  entities  that  are  acting  as  entrusted  banks,  i.e., \nShanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPDB) and Chang\u2019an Bank. Reflows from the first batch \nwill be relent twice to finance two additional batches of subprojects of a similar nature with an \ninvestment  requirement  of  about  $500  million  each.  Hence,  the  total  investment  mobilized  by \nthe CEFP is tentatively estimated to be in the range of $1.5 billion. \n \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n21. \nresources to help finance the proposed project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 10 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n22. \nThe  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  onlent  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  the  Shaanxi \nprovincial government (SPG) and by the Shaanxi Provincial Financial Department (on behalf of \nSPG) to Shaanxi Financial Holding Group (SFHG) on terms identical to those offered by ADB to \nthe Ministry of Finance.9 SFHG is the financial intermediary for this project. The credit risks and \nthe risks of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuation will be borne by the SFHG. SFHG \nwill  also  be  responsible  for  the  payment  of  commitment  fees  on  any  undisbursed  part  of  the \nloan.  SFHG  will  use  ADB  loan  proceeds  to  support  selective  industrial  energy  efficiency \ninvestments in Shaanxi Province. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n9  SFHG,  wholly  owned  by  the  SPG,  is  a  holding  group  of  nonbank  financial  institutions  engaging  in  strategic \ninvestments,  promotion  of  financing  for  SMEs,  trading  platforms  for  nonferrous  metal,  equity  holdings  as  well  as \nemissions, and private equity investments. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAmount \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\n1.

Detailed  subproject  selection  criteria,  covering  technical,  financial,  and \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards,  were  agreed  with  the  implementing  agency.  SDIMC  is \nrequired to prepare a subproject appraisal report to verify the subproject\u2019s compliance with the \nselection  criteria  and  obtain  ADB\u2019s  \u201cno  objection\u201d  before  approving  the  subprojects  under  the \nfirst  batch.  Detailed  guidelines  on  the  subproject  screening  and  appraisal  are  provided  in  the \nPAM (footnote 11). Technical, financial, economic, and environmental due diligence was carried \nout  on  a  representative  set  of  subprojects.  The  remaining  subprojects  will  be  appraised  and \napproved before loan effectiveness. \n \nA. \n \n26. \nTechnical  due  diligence  of  a  representative  set  of  subprojects  (i)  verified  the  technical \nfeasibility  of  the  proposed  technologies  to  achieve  the  desired  energy  savings  and  emission \nreduction;  (ii)  verified  the  proposed  cost  estimates;  (iii)  assessed  the  availability  of  proposed \ntechnologies  in  the  PRC  market;  (iv)  verified  the  energy  saving  and  emission  reduction \n\nTechnical \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nestimates  in  the  feasibility  study  reports;  (v)  defined  the  technical  parameters  to  be  monitored \nbefore  and  after  implementation  to  verify  the  actual  energy  savings  and  emission  reduction \nachieved; and (vi) identified main contract packages to be procured and procurement methods \nto  be  adopted  to  ensure  competitive,  transparent,  and  efficient  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices.11 \n \nB. \n \n27. \nFinancial  due  diligence  was  carried  out  on  SFHG  and  financial  institutions  that  will \npartner with SFHG in implementing the project. (i. e. SPDB, Chang\u2019an Bank, and Shaanxi SME \nFinancing  Guarantee  Company). 12  These  entities  are  financially  viable  and  are  capable  of \nmeeting  financial  obligations  and  debt  service  payments  without  difficulty.  SFHG  has  a  solid \nfinancial standing. As of December 2015, its net assets increased to CNY9.18 billion, the ratio of \ntotal  liabilities  to  assets  was  kept  below  50%,  and  the  current  ratio  is  always  above  2.0. \nMeanwhile,  the  group\u2019s  profitability  consistently  improved:  earnings  before  interest,  taxes, \ndepreciation,  and  amortization  grew  from  CNY160.7  million  in  2011  to  CNY321.50  million  in \n2015.  SFHG\u2019s  net  profit  margin  was  quite  high  (over  50%)  during  2011\u20132015.  The  executing \nagency's financial standing is assessed to be sufficiently robust to absorb the related credit risks \nof  subprojects  as  well  as  interest  rate  and  exchange  rate  fluctuation  risks.  The  integrity  due \ndiligence of SFHG showed no negative findings. \n \n28. \nThe  financial  viability  of  the  appraised  subprojects  was  evaluated.  These  subprojects \nhave a total investment value of $157.8 million amounting to 34% of first batch of subprojects. \nThe  subborrowers\u2019  debt  service  capability  was  ascertained  for  the  representative  subprojects \nand found to be within the prudential limits set by the subproject selection criteria. The financial \ninternal rate of return was calculated for the appraised subprojects to ensure that it exceeds the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  for  each  subproject  and  ranges  from  9.24%  to  30.4%.  The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  appraised  subprojects  was  calculated  by \nestimating the economic benefits and costs, including the climate change and pollution control \nbenefits. The EIRR of each appraised subproject exceeds 9% and the subprojects\u2019 EIRR ranges \nfrom  11.3%  to  53.3%  and  the  consolidated  EIRR  of  identified  subprojects  is  24.3%.  The \neconomic benefits of carbon savings are valued at $35 per ton.  \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  (footnote  13)  was  conducted  in  July  2016  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and \nFinancial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note.13 The assessment considered the capacity of the \nSFHG,  SDIMC,  SPDB,  Chang\u2019an  Bank,  and  Shaanxi  SME  Financing  Guarantee  Company, \nincluding  funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems, \nfinancial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The assessment \nresults  show  the  financial  management  systems  and  procedures  for  proper  financial \nmanagement  and  reporting  for  ADB  loan  implementation.  SPDB  and  Chang\u2019an  Bank  fully \ncomply with the prudential regulations of the regulator. An  action plan to mitigate the financial \nmanagement risks is provided in the PAM. The overall risk was assessed to be medium \n                                                 \n11 The  detailed  technical  description  of  appraised  subprojects  is  in  Technical  Description  of  Identified  Subprojects \n\nGovernance \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB. 2005.

The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD. \n \n31. \nThe  project  is  likely  to  have  positive  social  impacts  by  reducing  the  air  pollution \nassociated with  energy  consumption  and  industrial  production,  and  create  global  public  goods \nby  contributing  to  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  In  addition,  the  project  is \nexpected to improve the efficiency and quality of heat supply to residential areas. The project is \nexpected to contribute to the development of distributed renewable energy and of value-adding \nservice  industries  such  as  the  energy  service  industry,  which  will  contribute  to  the  creation  of \nnew jobs in green economic activities for knowledge workers. However, the project will not have \ndirect poverty reduction impacts and opportunities for improving gender equity. \n \nE. \n \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  financial  intermediation  loan.  An  ESMS  is \n32. \nestablished to meet national laws and ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard requirements \nfor FIL as per the Safeguard Policy Statement.14 The ESMS provides guidance on (i) screening, \ncategorization,  and  review  of  subprojects;  (ii) organizational  structure  and  staffing,  including \nskills  and  competencies  in  environmental  and  social  areas;  (iii)  capacity  building;  and  (iv) \nmonitoring  and  reporting.  As  per  the  ESMS  requirements,  the  executing  agency  has  entered \ninto  a  long-term  contract  with  an  experienced  environment  consultancy  firm.  The  ESMS \nprovides for environment category A subprojects to be included and, if any such subprojects are \nincluded, ADB will review the environmental impact assessments and approve them if they meet \nits Safeguard Policy Statement requirement, including disclosure and consultation. The existing \nindustrial facilities where subprojects are located will be subject to an environmental audit, and \nrecommendations will be made to ensure that these facilities meet the acceptable standards. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \nfinancial intermediary. The subproject selection criteria exclude subprojects that (i) require new \nland  acquisition,  (ii) result  in  labor  retrenchment  or  labor  redundancies,  or  (iii)  have  adverse \nimpacts on ethnic minority communities. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.
