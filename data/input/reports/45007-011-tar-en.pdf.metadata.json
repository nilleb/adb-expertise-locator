This  small-scale  technical \nassistance (SSTA), for $125,000, is being implemented to support the poor and \nvulnerable households adversely affected by involuntary resettlement in the design \nand  implementation  of  pilot  livelihood  demonstration  programs  by  enhancing \nemployable skills, training and business development, creating home-based jobs, \nand  increasing  opportunities  for  job  placements,  under  Tranche  1  of  the  MFF \nprogram.3 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nJustification \n\n \nA. \n \n5. \nAbout  840,000  of  the  1.4  million  population  of  Ulaanbaatar  City  live  in  ger  (traditional \nmoveable dwelling) areas. The urban poor and most vulnerable people live in ger areas. From \n2014 to 2016, the poverty rate in Mongolia's urban areas increased from 18.8% to 29.6 %. The \nurban poor in the ger area communities have limited access to basic services and face economic \nhardships due to lack of investments that prevents any improvement of their standards of living. \nGer  areas  have  high  levels  of  air,  water,  and  soil  pollution  and  are  also  vulnerable  to  climate \nchange  and  natural  disasters.    As  ger  areas  continue  to  grow  and  densify  due  to  urban \ndevelopment  and  immigration,  inadequacy  of  basic  infrastructure  services,  public  space,  and \ncommercial services has become more serious. Modernization of ger areas is the main urban, \nsocial, and environmental challenge of Mongolia.  \n \nMany initiatives, pilots, and projects have been implemented to redevelop and modernize \n6. \nger areas through construction of basic infrastructure, communal facilities, and affordable housing. \nThe involuntary resettlement impacts triggered by these ger area redevelopment initiatives would \nincrease poverty and vulnerability of affected households, if such initiatives are not accompanied \nby livelihood support opportunities. Most of the future investments in ger areas are expected from \nthe government and the private sector. Both the government and the private sector are still not \nwell  aware  of  best  practices  in  resettlement. Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  urgently  ensure that \nresettlement  processes  associated  with  redevelopment  of  ger  areas  follow  resettlement  best \npractices for the benefit of the affected people.  \n \n7. \nThe  proposed  TRTA  will  provide  capacity  development  support  to  the  Municipality  of \nUlaanbaatar  (MUB)  to  institutionalize  an  approach  to  plan,  design,  and  implement  livelihood \nsupport programs that target affected households whose livelihoods were adversely affected by \ninvoluntary resettlement.4 It is expected to (i) strengthen project implementation procedures and \napproaches  in  managing  involuntary  resettlement  and  livelihood  impacts  of  development \ninterventions in ger areas, and (ii) build the capacity of MUB in the management of involuntary \nresettlement and livelihood restoration programs. It will also scale-up the pilot activities conducted \n\n                                                 \n3  A livelihood support plan for each of the two subcenters (Bayankhoshuu and Selbe) is being implemented under the \nSSTA  and  includes  the  following  livelihood  support  measures  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable  affected  households: \n(i) vocational  skills  and  capacity  development  training;  (ii)  home-based  business  development  support,  through \nbusiness facilitation and equipment supply; and (iii) support in creating long-term employment opportunities. \n\n4   For purposes of the proposed TRTA, affected households refer to households whose livelihoods have been adversely \n\naffected by involuntary resettlement activities under the MFF program. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs and Activities \n\nunder the SSTA (para. 4) by including affected households whose livelihoods are impacted under \nthe MFF program and will build on experiences and lessons from the implementation of the SSTA \nand the involuntary resettlement process under Tranche 1, including recent resettlement activities \nof other donors and organizations. \n \n8. \nAlthough the TRTA is not included in the approved country operations business plan for \nMongolia,  2019\u20132021,  it  is  in  accordance  with  the  (i)  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy  for \nMongolia, 2017\u201320205 on supporting urban operations; (ii) Government Action Plan, 2016\u20132020, \nwhich  proposes  to  upgrade  existing  norms  and  standards  in  conformity  with  international \nstandards and create an environment suitable to apply international norms and standardization \ndocuments;  and  (iii)  ongoing  engagement  with  CSOs  and  community  representatives  in \nMongolia.6   \n \nB. \n \n9. \nOutput  1:  Livelihood  restoration  and  support  programs  for  affected  households \nimplemented.  The  TRTA  will  design  and  implement  livelihood  improvement  and  support \nprograms  together  with  MUB.  The  TRTA  team  at  inception  stage  will  (i)  analyze  the \nsocioeconomic  survey  findings  in  the  ger  areas;  (ii)  conduct  a  needs  assessment  of  affected \nhouseholds;7 (iii)  review  the  implementation  of  the  SSTA  activities  to  identify  successful  pilot \nlivelihood  support  programs;  (iv)  review  ICT  tools  and  systems  that  have  been  developed  to \nenhance  business  and  investment  support  services  in  the  ger  areas;  and  (v)  carry  out \nconsultations with businesses in ger areas and organizations working on research and capacity \nbuilding  related  to  livelihoods  and  productivity  of  micro-small  medium  enterprises  in  Mongolia, \nincluding  the  Asian  Productivity  Organization,    to  identify  any  existing  barriers  that  limit  the \nproductivity and growth of ger-based and ger-managed enterprises. The needs assessment of \naffected households will include collection of gender disaggregated information and help identify \ndifferentiated livelihood impacts of the project on men and women. These inputs will be used for \ndevelopment  and  prioritization  of  potential  livelihood  support  activities  in  consultation  with  the \naffected  persons  and  other  stakeholders.  The  livelihood  support  will  enhance  employability \nthrough skills development, provide training on business development, improve financial literacy, \nprovide tools and equipment for the affected households,8 and widen access to credit sources, \nand increase opportunities for job placements.  \n \n10. \nThe  design  and  implementation  of  livelihood  interventions  will  be  (i)  responsive  to  the \nspecific needs of each household and attuned to its level of preparedness; (ii) geared towards \nself-determination  and  empowerment  rather  than  dependence;  and  (iii)  gender-sensitive  and \nenvironmentally sound. The TRTA will explore avenues to engage CSOs and community groups \nin planning, designing, implementing, and monitoring involuntary resettlement programs to build \ntheir  capacity,  ownership,  and  empowerment;  and  facilitate  their  involvement  to  benefit  from \ninfrastructure projects. \n \n11. \nIn addition, the TRTA will (i) identify opportunities to incorporate livelihood support function \nwithin  the  business  incubator  facility  built  under  the  MFF  program,  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit's (GIZ) \"Build for Skills Program\" initiative under Tranche 1, and \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2017\u20132020. Manila. \n6  The TRTA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 26 April 2019. \n7   The needs assessment and survey of affected households shall be designed to capture livelihood impacts on women \n\nmembers of the affected households.  \n\n8   Equipment  that  contribute  to  improved  incomes  and  livelihoods  of  the  affected  households,  such  as  sewing \n\nmachines, automobile repair tools, and welding equipment. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fother donors' and government's initiatives; and (ii) review and assess the benefits of livelihood \nimprovement  under  Tranche  1,  the  contribution  to  economic  and  social  development  of \nUlaanbaatar  City,  and  how  the  private  sector  can  integrate  livelihood  restoration  and  support \nprogram in their activities. To continuously assess the impacts of the livelihood support activities \nunder this TRTA, a concurrent monitoring and evaluation of the TRTA activities will be carried out \nto (i) identify any red flags and corrective actions in the implementation of the TRTA objectives, \nand (ii) help contribute to the sustainability of the TRTA activities in future ger area redevelopment \nprojects in Mongolia.  \n \n12. \nOutput 2: A sustainable model on integrating livelihood support to persons affected \nby urban resettlement planning in Mongolia established. The experiences gained from the \nimplementation of Output 1 of the TRTA and the two technical assistance projects (para. 4) will \nprovide inputs to the development of a sustainable model that will integrate livelihood support to \npersons affected by redevelopment and urban resettlement in the ger areas. The model will be \naligned  with  any  existing  policy  or  strategies  of  the  Government  of  Mongolia  on  enterprise \ndevelopment  and  productivity  improvement.  The  model  will  guide  MUB,  relevant  government \nagencies,  CSOs,  private  sector,  and  other  donors  engaged  in  infrastructure  development  in \nUlaanbaatar to  integrate  and  address  livelihood  restoration. It  will  also  provide  suggestions  on \nhow to improve urban resettlement planning and implementation. The TRTA is expected to have \ndemonstrable benefits that can be replicated and developed into sustainable livelihood restoration \nprograms. A knowledge product in the form of a policy paper will be produced, incorporating the \nresults from consultations with stakeholder groups and affected communities.  \n \n13. \nOutput 3: The capacity of the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar to develop and implement \nlivelihood support programs strengthened. Capacity building under the proposed TRTA will \naim  at  (i)  developing  skills  and  knowledge  of  the  Land  Agency  and  PMO  staff  under  MUB  on \npolicy  advice  and  knowledge  management  dissemination  of  best  practices  in  involuntary \nresettlement and livelihood restoration; and (ii) institutionalizing resettlement and social safeguard \nbest  practices  at  MUB,  to  benefit  future  urban  development  and  infrastructure  programs  in \nMongolia.  Capacity  building  initiatives  will  focus  on  concepts  of  and  approaches  to  livelihood \nimprovement  of  affected  persons  and  implementation  of  programs  through  external  service \nproviders, including training institutes, individual experts, private companies, and NGOs. Training \nmanuals  will  be  produced  and  translated  into  local  languages,  and  training  e-modules  will  be \ndeveloped for MUB staff to carry out training on livelihood improvement. The training modules will \ninclude  gender-specific  approaches \nimprovement  and  skills \nenhancement needs of women. About 25 MUB staff from the Land Agency and PMO, of which at \nleast  30%  will  be  women,  will  be  trained  on  implementation  of  ADB  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguards apart from planning and implementation of livelihood restoration programs.  \n \n14. \nDesign and monitoring framework. The capacity development support to be provided \nby the proposed TRTA will not result to a change in the design and monitoring framework of the \nongoing MFF program and its tranches. The TRTA will enhance the quality of outputs without any \nchange to the targeted results indicators. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nThe TRTA is estimated to cost $720,000, of which $660,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance including translators, and other in-\nkind contributions.  \n\nCost and Financing \n\nlivelihood \n\ntailored \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fConsultants \n \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\nDisbursement \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nD. \n \n16. \nADB  will  administer  the  TRTA;  and  will  select,  evaluate,  appoint,  and  supervise \nconsultants.
