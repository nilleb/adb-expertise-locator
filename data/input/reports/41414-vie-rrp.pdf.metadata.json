Traffic volume will \ndouble within 7\u20138 years. Development of transport infrastructure, \nespecially  the  expressway  network,  is  essential  to  achieve  rapid \neconomic growth. The TA Loan Project will assist the Government \nand  VEC  in  preparing  the  following  high-priority  expressway \nprojects: (i) the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway, to be linked \nwith  the  existing  Nanning\u2013Youyiguan  Expressway  in  Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC); (ii) the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway, to be \nlinked  with  the  planned  Fangcheng\u2013Dongxing  Expressway  in  the \nGZAR;  and  (iii)  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway,  to \nstrengthen  connectivity  in  the  southern  suburbs  of  Ho  Chi  Minh \nCity  (HCMC).  These  expressways  are  all  part  of  the  GMS \neconomic corridors identified in the GMS transport sector strategy \nstudy endorsed by the GMS governments in May 2006.  \n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amounts and \nLending Terms \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\nThrough  implementation  of  the  TA  Loan  Project,  the  three \nexpressway  projects  will  be  designed  and  prepared \nfor \ninvestment.

Traffic  volume  will  double  within  7\u20138  years.  Development  of \ntransport  infrastructure,  especially  the  expressway  network,  is  essential  to  achieve  rapid \neconomic  growth.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  funding  to  assist  the \nGovernment in preparing an expressway master plan for the national expressway system. 1 The \nplan  identifies  a  logical  national  network  with  a  total  length  of  about  5,000  kilometers  (km). \nBased on economic and financial viability, priority is given to the expressway network with high \ncapacity  that  will  connect  key  economic  and  industrial  zones,  large  urban  centers,  and \ninternational  borders.  In  the  expressway  master  plan,  construction  of  about  2,000  km \nexpressway  will  have  commenced  by  2015,  and  500  km  of  expressway  will  be  open  to  public \ntraffic by 2015. \n \n3. \nOut of the priority expressway network, the Government of Viet Nam has requested ADB \nto consider financing the construction of (i) the Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway (about 120 km) \nand the Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway (about 120 km) in the northern region (Map 1), which \nare  key  sections  of  the  GMS  eastern  corridor  linking  Viet  Nam  and  Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous  Region  (GZAR)  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC);  and  (ii)  the  Ben  Luc\u2013\nLong  Thanh  Expressway  (about  60  km)  in  the  south  of  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  (HCMC)  (Map  2), \nwhich  is  a  key  section  of  the  GMS  southern  corridor  which  links  Viet  Nam,  Cambodia,  and \nThailand,  and  intersects  with  the  GMS  eastern  corridor  (Map  3).  This  TA  Loan  Project,  with \nassociated  TA  grants,  will  prepare  the  three  expressway  projects.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  regional  dimension  of  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha \nLong\u2013Mong Cai Expressways is summarized in Appendix 2. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  Expressway  is  proposed  to  be  constructed  parallel  to \n4. \nNational  Highway  No.1  (NH1),  which  was  upgraded  under  the  ADB-assisted  Second  Road \n2 as  well  as  to  the  single-track  railway  in  northern  Viet  Nam  leading  to \nImprovement  Project,(cid:31)F\nGZAR. The distance between Ha Noi and the border town of Huu Nghi in Lang Son province is \nabout 130 km. The GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway forms part of the GMS eastern corridor, \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Expressway Network Development \n\nPlan Project. Manila (TA 4695-VIE).  \n\n2   ADB.  1996.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Road Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 1487-VIE). \n\n\f3 as  one  of  nine \nwhich  was  identified  under  the  GMS  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study  (TSSS)(cid:31)F\ntransport corridors, and runs from Nanning in GZAR to Ha Noi. Along the proposed expressway \nroute in Bac Ninh and Bac Giang provinces, traffic is considerable, while in Lang Son province it \nis relatively low. It currently takes 3 hours to drive from Ha Noi to Huu Nghi. Cross-border trade \nbetween GZAR and Viet Nam has been expanding at about 4% per year. However, the volume \nof  cargo  transported  by  trucks  peaked  in  2003  and  has  since  been  declining.  This  is  due  to \ncumbersome  border  crossing  formalities  and  the  absence  of  exchange  of  traffic  rights \narrangements  between  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam,  which  results  in  time-consuming  and  costly \ntransshipment  at  the  border  checkpoints.  The  proposed  expressway,  which  will  link  with  the \nADB-assisted  expressway  from  Nanning  (the  capital  of  GZAR)  to  the  border  town  of \n4 combined with streamlining of cross-border operations, is expected to boost cross-\nYouyiguan,(cid:31)F\nborder  trade  between  Viet  Nam  and  GZAR.  It  is  important  to  reasonably  forecast  the  traffic \ndemand  growth,  reflecting  the  economic  growth  in  the  area  and  potential  modal  shift  from \nmotorcycles  to  passenger  cars  in  Viet  Nam,  as  well  as  the  expansion  of  trade  between  Viet \nNam and GZAR. There is only one daily passenger train, as passenger traffic appears to have \nshifted to the improved NH1. On average, eight freight trains run per week, transporting mainly \nheavy materials and products such as ore and steel. It is less likely, therefore, that there will be \na modal shift arising from the construction of the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway.  \n \n5. \nThe  existing  NH18  runs  along  the  northern  coast  from  Ha  Long  to  Mong  Cai,  through \nMong Duong. It is identified as a priority GMS transport project under the TSSS. The distance \nbetween Ha Long and Mong Cai is about 200 km. NH18 has four lanes in city areas and two \nlanes  in  other  places.  The  road  is  generally  in  good  condition,  except  for  a  10\u201320  km  section \nfrom Mong  Cai, which is in poor condition. It currently takes 6 hours to drive from Ha Long to \nMong  Cai.  NH18  is  being  used  as  a  heavy  freight  route,  with  an  estimated  500  truck-trailers \ncarrying  40-foot  maritime  containers  using  it  each  day.  Hai  Phong  port  in  northern  Viet  Nam \nserves as a gateway for the PRC in importing goods from other Association of Southeast Asian \nNations  (ASEAN)  countries.  The  containers  arrive  at  Hai  Phong  port  and  are  immediately \ntransported  to  GZAR.  The  geometric  alignment  of  NH18  is  within  acceptable  standards,  but \ncurve radius and lane width are considered too sharp and narrow for truck-trailers; many traffic \naccidents occur on this road. It has many short bridges with a load limit of 13 tons, and these \nbridges are damaged by truck-trailers carrying 40-foot maritime containers. NH18 is also being \nused as a tourism route. Passenger bus services have been developed, but there is no railway \nservice. In this regard, a new expressway of acceptable design standards should be considered \nin order to reduce travel time and transport costs, improve road safety in the influence area of \nNH18, promote tourism, and maintain the road assets of NH18. The use of NH18 as a long-term \nfreight route, however, remains uncertain, as three major ports in GZAR are being expanded by \nthe GZAR authority. Therefore it is important to carefully carry out transport and trade analyses, \nsurvey  related  infrastructure  development  in  the  influence  area,  and  conduct  traffic  flow \nassessments between Viet Nam and GZAR along this route.  \n \n6. \nThe Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway will be a southern link of the HCMC\u2019s outer ring \nexpressway  as  well  as  a  short  link  of  the  north\u2013south  expressway  in  Viet  Nam,  and  will  be \nconnected  to  the  planned  HCMC\u2013Vung  Tau  Expressway.  The  expressway  forms  part  of  the \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  for  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study,  Manila  (TA \n6195-REG).  Objective  of  the  GMS  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study  is  to  establish  a  well-built,  seamless, \nmultimodal  subregional  transport  network  that  will  contribute  significantly  to  fully  connecting  the  GMS.

In  the \nsouthern  area  of  HCMC,  east\u2013west  traffic  is  restricted  due  to  lack  of  river  crossing  facilities, \nforcing vehicles into the center of HCMC. Modal shift from motorcycles to passenger cars has \nalready  been  substantial  in  the  project  area.  Construction  of  HCMC  ring  roads  to  establish \nconnectivity  with  neighboring  cities  by  expressway  links  is  considered  a  high  priority  by  the \nGovernment.  In  this  regard,  the  proposed  expressway  will  have  significant  impacts  on \nsocioeconomic  activities  in  the  cities  and  towns  around  HCMC,  and  also  will  improve  traffic \nproblems  in  the  center  of  HCMC  by  diverting  the  through  traffic  to  the  expressway.  The \nexpressway  will  be  used  as  freight  route  to  and  from  the  HCMC  river  port.  The  Nha  Be  and \nLong  Tau  rivers  in  the  project  area  are  used  as  navigation  channels  for  large  cargo  ships \naccessing  the  HCMC  river  port.  Two  bridges  or  tunnels  need  to  be  constructed  across  the \nrivers. If bridges are selected, these will have to be long-spanned bridges with a 50\u201360 meter \n(m) navigational clearance. The Mekong Delta area contains major agricultural fields which are \ncapable of rice triple-cropping. Industrial parks, such as in food processing, are being developed \nin the project area. The proposed expressway will be used as a freight route to transport food \nproduced in the Mekong Delta to the rest of the country by land and maritime transport.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nAppendix 3 provides an analysis of the road subsector. Goals in the sector road map set \n7. \nout  in  2006  are  being  achieved.  Major  issues  in  the  road  subsector  are  insufficient  highway \ncapacity and high accident rates. In parallel with economic growth and income increase, traffic \ndemand  for  roads  and  traffic  volume  on  roads  has  rapidly  increased.  For  example,  on  NH1 \nbetween  Ha  Noi,  Lang  Son,  and  Huu  Nghi  (the  border  with  the  PRC),  average  annual  traffic \ngrowth of 87% was recorded on the section between Ha Noi and Cao Beng; growth of 21% was \nrecorded on the section between Bac Giang and Lang Son; and growth of 37% was recorded on the \n5 Road  fatalities  and \nsection  between  Lang  Son  and  Huu  Nghi,  from  April  2001  to  July  2003.(cid:31)F\ninjuries in Viet Nam rapidly increased in the late 1990s, although this increase stopped in 2002, \nand the number of injuries from traffic accidents has substantially dropped since then. However, \nthe  number  of  fatalities  from  traffic  accidents  remains  high,  at  12,000\u201313,000  per  year  during \n2003\u20132007. The traffic accident rate for access-controlled highways is much lower than that for \naccess-free  roads.  The  development  of  high-design-standard  expressways  is  expected  to \nimprove road safety. Expressway network development will address these issues efficiently. \n \n8. \nThe  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  Expressway  will  be  connected  with  the  existing  Nanning\u2013\nYouyiguan Expressway in GZAR at the Huu Nghi\u2013Youyiguan border. The GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong \nCai Expressway will be connected with the planned Fangcheng\u2013Dongxing Expressway in GZAR \nat  the  Mong  Cai\u2013Dongxing  border.  The  demand  for  international  freight  traffic  along  these \ncorridors  is  high.  However,  the  current  slow  and  cumbersome  border  crossing  operations, \nincluding the need for transshipment between Vietnamese and Chinese trucks at these borders, \nare bottlenecks to international trade. It takes at least 3 days to forward cargo from Nanning to \nHa  Noi  by  truck.  Transport  facilitation  measures  provided  for  under  the  GMS  cross-border \ntransport agreement (CBTA), which has been ratified by the governments of Viet Nam and the \nPRC, will help remove these impediments and further boost two-way trade between Viet Nam \nand GZAR.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

For  the  GMS  Noi  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  Highway  Project,  MOT  held  meetings  with  project \nprovincial governments on the highway alignment in order to start preparing the detailed design \nand resettlement plan. However, changes in the alignment were often requested by the project \nprovinces. This resulted in a prolonged detailed design study and an increase in the consulting \nservices  cost.  Consultation  with  project  stakeholders  by  MOT  in  the  early  stage  is  required  to \nfacilitate the alignment determination process.  \n \n \n \n16. \nADB\u2019s  interventions  in  the  modern  expressway  and  highway  subsector  started  in  2005 \n(Appendix  4),  when  it  provided  technical  assistance  for  developing  a  modern  expressway  and \nhighway  network.  The  TA  for  the  Expressway  Network  Development  Plan  Project  (footnote  (cid:31)H1) \nprovided  (i)  a  business  plan  setting  out  an  institutional,  organizational,  and  financial  structure \nthat  would  allow  VEC  to  successfully  implement  the  expressway  program;  (ii)  a  long-term \nmaster  plan  for  the  expressway  network,  including  a  detailed  plan  for  expressways  to  be \ndeveloped during 2006\u20132015; and (iii) a detailed economic and financial viability assessment of \npriority expressway links, as well as a financing plan for these links. Moreover, loans for the Noi \nBai\u2013Lao  Cai  Highway  TA  Project  (footnote  15)  and  the  HCMC\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay \n16 provide for (i) detailed engineering designs, (ii) detailed economic and \nExpressway TA Project(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nfinancial studies, (iii) detailed social and environmental studies, (iv) procurement assistance for \ncivil works, and (v) VEC\u2019s capacity development. Investment loans for the GMS Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai \nHighway  Project  (footnote  14)  were  approved  in  2007.  With  other  development  partners,  ADB \ncontinues to technically and financially support expressway network development in Viet Nam. \nThe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  the  World  Bank  are  planning  to \nfinancially assist construction of expressways in the central and southern regions of Viet Nam. \nFurthermore,  private  sector  funds  have  been  used  for  construction  of  urban  expressways \ntogether with residential area development along the expressways.   \n \n17. \nThe  ADB  TA  project  (footnote  (cid:31)H1)  identified  the  following  issues  with  VEC  that  must  be \naddressed:  (i)  strengthening  of  the  organizational  structure,  (ii)  development  of  a  legal  and \nregulatory  framework,  (iii)  staff  training,  and  (iv)  development  of  a  financial  and  asset \nmanagement  system  (Appendix  3).

The  study  has  developed  several  PPP  contracting  models  for  different  levels  of \nprivate  sector  participation.  The  PPP  contracting  models  for  the  lower  level  of  private  sector \nparticipation  are  contract-out  and  concession  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  works  of \nexpressways. The PPP contracting models for the higher level of private sector participation are \nexpressway  construction  and  operation  by  public\u2013private  joint  companies,  and  expressway \nbuild\u2013operate\u2013transfer  concession  by  private  companies.  The  decision  support  model  for \nselection of the appropriate PPP model has been developed based on the ability to apply user \ntolls, the size and scope of the project, the extent of required risk transfer to the private sector, \nand the bankability of the project. The World Bank intends to use PPPs for its future expressway \nprojects.  This  financing  modality  will  be  studied,  among  others,  for  the  three  expressway \nprojects. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  ensuing  expressway  projects  will  construct  (i)  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son \n19. \nExpressway  (about  120  km),  which  will  be  connected  to  the  existing  Nanning\u2013Youyiguan \nExpressway in GZAR; (ii) the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway (about 120 km), which will \nbe  connected  to  the  existing  Nanning\u2013Fangcheng  Expressway  and  the  Fangcheng\u2013Dongxing \nhighway in GZAR; and (iii) the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway (about 60 km), which will form \npart  of  the  outer  ring  road  of  the  HCMC  urban  expressway,  and  be  an  access  link  with  the \nplanned  HCMC\u2013Vung  Tau  Expressway.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  Loan  Project  is  the  design  of \nthe  ensuing  expressway  projects  agreed  to  by  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam,  VEC,  ADB,  and \ncofinanciers. \n \n20. \nThe expected impact of the TA Loan Project is the achievement of efficient movement of \ngoods  and  people  between  northeastern  Viet  Nam  and  GZAR,  and  within  the  greater  HCMC \narea, through construction of the three expressways. International and local traffic will be able to \nuse  an  efficient,  safe,  and  reliable  express  route  from  Ha  Noi  to  the  border  with  the  PRC \nthrough  the  completion  of  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  GMS  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai \nexpressways. Connectivity of cities and towns around HCMC will be improved and the cost and \ntravel times for the movement of passengers and goods in and around HCMC will be reduced \nthrough  completion  of  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway.  Ultimately,  the  TA  Loan  Project \nwill contribute to sustainable economic growth and enhanced economic exchange between Viet \nNam and the PRC, and promote socioeconomic development in the project-influenced areas. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n21. \nThe  associated  TA  projects  will  undertake  technical  feasibility  studies  for  the  three \nexpressways.

These  associated  TA  projects  will  carry  out \ntechnical  feasibility  studies  for  the  three  expressways.  Based  on  the  draft  final  report  on  the \ntechnical feasibility study for each expressway project, the Government of Viet Nam, VEC, and \nADB will confirm whether the technical feasibility of each expressway project is satisfactory as a \ncondition to the commencement of detailed engineering studies under the TA Loan Project. The \nensuing investment loans for construction of the three expressways will be processed by using \noutputs of the associated TA projects and the TA Loan Project. \n \nThe  project  costs  for  construction  of  the  three  expressways  are  estimated  at  between \n23. \n$800 million and $1 billion each. Given the large financing requirements, cofinancing for each of \nthe projects will be explored. To date, JBIC has agreed in principle to cofinance the Ben Luc\u2013\nLong  Thanh  Expressway  Project,  and  the  Korea  Eximbank  has  expressed  interest  in \ncofinancing  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  Expressway  Project.  Cofinanciers  for  the  GMS  Ha \nLong\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project need to be identified. Private sector financing possibilities \nsupported by ADB guarantees will be explored, possibly building on ongoing study by the World \nBank on PPPs in the Viet Nam road sector (footnote (cid:31)H17). \n \n24. \nA memorandum of understanding between Viet Nam and the PRC was signed in March \n2008 by vice-ministers of transport of the two countries to include the Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son corridor \nand the Huu Nghi\u2013Youyiguan border crossings in the scope of the GMS CBTA. The CBTA is a \nmultilateral  instrument  for  the  facilitation  of  cross-border  transport  of  goods  and  people. \nFormulated  under  the  auspices  of  a  series  of  ADB  technical  assistance  projects,  the  CBTA \nprovides  a  practical  approach  to  streamlining  regulations  and  reducing  nonphysical  barriers  in \nthe GMS. It covers key aspects of cross-border transport facilitation in one document, including \n(i)  single-stop  single-window  customs  inspection;  (ii)  cross-border  movement  of  persons  (i.e., \nvisas  for  persons  engaged  in  transport  operations);  (iii)  transit  traffic  regimes,  including \nexemptions  from  physical  customs  inspection,  bond  deposit,  escort,  and  agriculture  and \nveterinary  inspection;  (iv)  requirements  that  road  vehicles  will  have  to  meet  to  be  eligible  for \ncross-border  traffic  status;  (v)  exchange  of  commercial  traffic  rights;  and  (vi)  infrastructure, \nincluding road and bridge design standards, road signs, and signals. When the CBTA between \nthe  PRC  and  Viet  Nam  enters  into  force,  i.e.,  when  both  governments  ratify  the  CBTA\u2019s \nimplementing  guidelines,  key  transport  facilitation  provisions  mentioned  above  will  have  to  be \nimplemented,  and  the  current  exchange  of  traffic  rights  arrangements  that  is  limited  to  the \nborder areas will have to be expanded to cover the entire Nanning\u2013Ha Noi corridor. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n25. \nThe TA Loan Project is estimated to cost $30.8 million equivalent, including local taxes \n(Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are in Appendix 5. \nADB  will  finance  the  base  cost  for  the  consulting  services,  and  will  not  finance  compensation \nand  allowances  for  the  project-affected  persons.  All  financing  charges  are  to  be  capitalized. \nVEC  will  finance  all  local  taxes  imposed  on  the  consulting  services.  The  local  taxes  are \nestimated at approximately 20% of the base cost, consisting of 10% for value-added taxes, 5% \nfor  corporate  income  taxes,  and  approximately  5%  for  personal  income  taxes.  Overall,  local \ntaxes are estimated at $4.3 million equivalent.   \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nB. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBase Costb \n \n \n \n \n \n\nConsulting Services \n     a.

The loan will be denominated in \nspecial drawing rights with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \ncharge of 3.15% per annum during the life of the loan, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements.  \n \n27. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  84%  of  the  total  project  cost  (Table  2).  The  remaining  cost \n($4.8 million) will be financed by VEC. The Borrower of ADB\u2019s loan will be the Government of \nViet Nam. The entire loan proceeds will be relent. VEC will borrow the loans from the Ministry of \nFinance through subsidiary loan agreements, on terms acceptable to ADB and at ADB\u2019s interest \nrate applicable to the loans, plus a relending fee pursuant to the borrower\u2019s regulations. \n \n28. \nAn additional $1.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program \nto undertake TA for preparing the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai expressway \nprojects (para. 41), and another additional $1.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  to  undertake  TA  for  preparing  the \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fBen  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway  Project  (para.  42).  The  Government  and  VEC  have  been \ninformed  that  approval  of  the  TA  Loan  Project  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  ensuing \nprojects. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nVietnam Expressway Corporation \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nTotal \n26.0 \n  4.8 \n30.8 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n% \n84 \n16 \n100 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe  executing  agency  will  be  VEC  under  supervision  of  MOT.  VEC  will  have  overall \n29. \nresponsibility for project implementation and formal correspondence with the line ministries, Ha \nNoi  City,  HCMC,  provincial  governments,  and  ADB.  VEC  will  set  up  a  new  project \nimplementation unit no. 3 (PIU3) for the TA Loan Project, which will comprise a qualified project \nfor  day-to-day  project \ndirector  and  suitable  staff.  The  PIU3  will  have  responsibility \nimplementation. To enhance knowledge sharing and improve job efficiency, PIU3 will coordinate \nwith  other  VEC  staff  in  the  Business  Planning  Department,  Technical  Department  (including \nenvironmental  unit  and  social  and  resettlement  unit),  Finance  and  Accounting  Department,  as \nwell as the existing project implementing units of other projects. VEC will engage and direct the \nwork of consultants for (i) the project design including (a) detailed design study and its related \nstudies,  (b)  update  of  the  resettlement  plans,  EMDPs  (or  EMSAs),  EIAs,  and  EMPs,  (c) \nassistance  in  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works,  and  (d)  implementation  of  the  land \nacquisition and resettlement; (ii) appraisal of the detailed designs; and (iii) external monitoring of \nthe land acquisition and resettlement activities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n30. \nThe TA Loan Project will be implemented over 4.5 years for commencement in January \n2009  and  completion  in  June  2013.  The  overall  implementation  schedule  for  the  TA  Loan \nProject is presented in Appendix 6. The ensuing investment loans are tentatively programmed \nfor ADB Board approval as follows: for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project in 2010, \nfor the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway Project in 2011, and for the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong \nCai Expressway Project  in 2012.  \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n31. \nFor each expressway project, four types of consulting services will be carried out before \nand  during  processing  of  the  ensuing  investment  loan.  First,  project  feasibility  consulting \nservices to be funded by the associated TA grants will prepare engineering, economic, financial, \nsocial,  and  environmental  feasibility  studies.  Second,  project  design  consulting  services  to  be \nfunded by the TA loan will (i) prepare detailed designs; (ii) update resettlement plans, EMDPs \n(or EMSAs), EIAs, and EMPs based on the detailed designs; and (iii) assist in the procurement \nof  civil  works  and  the  implementation  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Third,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  internal  procedures,  detailed  design  appraisal  consulting \nservices to be funded by the TA loan will review the detailed designs and project cost estimates \n\n10 \n\n \nF. \n\n \n\n\fprepared  by  the  project  design  consulting  services.  Fourth,  external  resettlement  monitoring \nconsulting services to be funded by the TA loan will monitor land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities. \n \nThe outline of the consulting services for the project feasibility study to be funded from \n32. \nthe associated TA funds is provided in Appendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix A for the GMS \nHa  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai  expressway  projects  and  Appendix  8  and \nSupplementary Appendix B for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project. ADB will recruit \nan  international  consulting  firm  for  each  TA  project  following  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection (QCBS) procedure and in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). The consultants engaged under the associated TA grants will \nnot  prepare  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  on  the  detailed  design  study,  and \ntherefore will not be excluded from the consultant selection for the ensuing project design study \nif  they  express  interest.  To  ensure  transparency  of  consultant  selection,  the  final  report  of  the \nproject  feasibility  study  will  be  disclosed  to  all  short-listed  consultants  for  the  ensuing  project \ndesign study. \n \n33. \nThe procurement plan and a list of proposed contract packages for the TA Loan Project \nare  in  Appendix  9.  VEC  will  undertake  three  consulting  services  for  each  of  the  three \nexpressways  under  the  TA  Loan  Project:  (i)  the  project  design  study,  (ii)  the  detailed  design \nappraisal  study;  and  (iii)  the  external  resettlement  monitoring.  All  consulting  firms  will  be \nselected in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nVEC  will  recruit  international  consulting  firms  for  the  project  design  study  following \nthe  QCBS  procedure.  The  quality\u2013cost  ratio  is  80:20.  The  outline  of  the  consulting \nservices for the project design study is in Appendix 10. The project design study will \n(a) undertake detailed engineering designs for the expressways and their associated \nfacilities; (b) update resettlement plans, EMDPs (or EMSAs), EIAs, and EMPs, taking \ninto  account  detailed  engineering  designs;  (c)  prepare  bidding  documents  for \nprocurement of goods and civil works and assist VEC in undertaking procurement of \nthe  goods  and  civil  works;  and  (d)  assist  in  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement \nplans prior to commencement of civil works. The consulting services contract period \nwill  last  13  months  from  November  2009  to  November  2010  for  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long \nThanh Expressway, last for 13 months from April 2010 to April 2011 for the GMS Ha \nNoi\u2013Lang Son Expressway, and last for 14 months from April 2011 to May 2012 for \nthe  GMS  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai  Expressway.  It  is  envisaged  that  about  422  person-\nmonths  of  international  experts  and  about  1,030  person-months  of  national  experts \nwill be required for the project design study of the three expressways. \nVEC will select international consulting firms for the detailed design appraisal study. \nThe  QCBS  procedure  will  be  used  for  the  consulting  services,  cost  of  which  is \nestimated at $200,000 or higher, and the quality\u2013cost ratio is 80:20. The consultants\u2019 \nqualifications selection (CQS) procedure will be used for the consulting services, cost \nof which is estimated below $200,000. The outline of the consulting services for the \ndetailed  design  appraisal  study  is  in  Appendix  11.  Prior  to  procurement  of  the  civil \nworks,  the  detailed  design  appraisal  study  will  review  detailed  designs  of  the \nexpressways and their associated facilities and cost estimates for the projects in line \nwith the Government\u2019s regulations. A period of 2 months is required to appraise the \ndetailed  designs  for  each  expressway.  The  consulting  services  contract  period  will \nstart in September 2010 for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway, start in February \n2011  for  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  Expressway,  and  start  in  March  2012  for  the \nGMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway. It is envisaged that about 30 person-months \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n(iii) \n\nof  international  experts  and  about  42  person-months  of  national  experts  will  be \nrequired for the detailed design appraisal study for the three expressway projects.  \nVEC will also recruit national consulting firms to undertake the external resettlement \nmonitoring.  The  QCBS  procedure  will  be  used  for  the  consulting  services,  cost  of \nwhich  is  estimated  at  $200,000  or  higher,  and  the  quality\u2013cost  ratio  is  80:20.  The \nCQS  procedure  will  be  used  for  the  consulting  services,  cost  of  which  is  estimated \nbelow  $200,000.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the  external  resettlement  monitoring \nconsulting  services  will  be  developed  in  the  resettlement  plans,  which  will  be \nprepared under the project feasibility study. \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n34. \nwith  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  VEC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and the project- \nrelated records and accounts of all consultants and other service providers. \n \n35. \nTo ensure transparency and good governance, VEC will publicly disclose on its website \ninformation  on  how  loan  proceeds  are  being  used.  For  each  procurement  contract,  VEC  will \ndisclose (i) the list of participating consultants, (ii) the name of the winning consultant, (iii) basic \ndetails  on  consultant  selection  procedures  adopted,  (iv)  the  amount  of  the  contract  awarded, \n(v) the  list  of  goods  and/or  services  purchased,  and  (vi)  the  intended  and  actual  utilization  of \nloan proceeds under each contract. VEC will also disclose details of resettlement reports on its \nwebsite, which will be updated within 2 weeks of each contract being awarded. Also, VEC will \nsubmit quarterly internal and external resettlement monitoring reports to ADB. The resettlement \nreports will be uploaded onto VEC\u2019s website within 2 weeks of their submission. Moreover, the \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  all  of VEC\u2019s  project  staff  are  fully  aware  of,  and  comply  with,  the \nto,  procedures \nGovernment\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  procedures, \nfor implementation,  procurement,  use  of  consultants,  disbursement,  reporting,  monitoring,  and \nprevention of fraud and corruption. \n \n\nincluding,  but  not \n\nlimited \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n36. \nLoan  disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed directly to the consultants based on \nan approved contract under the direct payment procedure.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n37. \nVEC will maintain separate financial records and accounts adequate to identify financing \nresources  received  and  project  expenditure,  including  consulting  services  and  the  local  taxes \nimposed on the consulting services financed out of the loan proceeds and local funds. The loan \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound \nauditing standards by an auditor acceptable to ADB. VEC will submit annual audited reports and \nrelated  financial  statements  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  audit \n\n \n\n \n\n\fopinion  will  include  (i)  a  detailed  description  of  the  source  of  funds  and  expenditures  made, \n(ii) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal controls systems with respect to \nproject expenditure and other financial transactions in order to ensure safe custody of project-\nfinanced assets, and (iii) confirmation of compliance with loan covenants. \n \n38. \nPIU3, on behalf of VEC, will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress \nof  project  implementation.  It  will  monitor  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation schedule, and will keep ADB informed through quarterly progress reports of any \nsignificant  deviations  from  the  schedule.  The  quarterly  reports  will  summarize  information  in \ndetailed  project  reports,  including  basic  data  related  to  the  Project,  utilization  of  funds, \nachievement  of  immediate  development  objectives,  implementation  progress,  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring, land acquisition and resettlement progress, compliance with loan \ncovenants, and major issues and problems. Within 3 months of completion of the Project, VEC \nthrough PIU3 will submit through VEC a project completion report to ADB, which will provide a \ndetailed  evaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs,  performance  of  the  consultants,  the \nperformance indicators, social impacts, and such other details as may be requested by ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n39. \nVEC,  assisted  by  the  project  feasibility  and  design  consultants,  will  establish  baseline \ndata for the performance indicators and targets for evaluating project performance in relation to \nimpacts,  outcomes,  and  outputs  of  the  expressway  projects.  The  performance  indicators  and \ntargets  will  be  again  measured  6  months  and  3  years  after  completion  of  the  construction  of \neach expressway, and compared to the baseline data to identify the project benefits.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n40. \nRegular reviews will be carried out semiannually so that ADB fact-finding and appraisal \nmissions  for  processing  of  the  ensuing  investment  loans  can  utilize  outputs  of  the  consulting \nservices,  and  approval  of  the  ensuing  investment  loans  in  the  programmed  year  may  be \nensured. A project completion review mission will be fielded about 1 year after completion of the \nTA  Loan  Project.  There  will  also  be  special  reviews  as  required  to  address  issues  that  arise \nduring project implementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nProposed  TA  of  $1.5  million  for  preparing  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha  Long\u2013\n41. \nMong Cai expressway  projects, to be funded on  a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund, is attached to the TA Loan Project. A summary of the proposed TA is provided in \nAppendix 7. These expressways will be important routes connecting the northern region of Viet \nNam  with  GZAR  in  the  PRC.  The  TA  will  therefore  give  special  emphasis  to  cross-border \naspects,  including  transport  and  trade  facilitation,  competitiveness  and  complementarities  of \nfreight transportation from a multimodal perspective, and development  of cross-border tourism \nbetween  northern  Viet  Nam  and  GZAR.  The  TA  will  determine  the  general  alignment  of  the \nGMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway, taking engineering difficulty, construction cost, economic \nimpacts, and social and environmental impacts into consideration. The engineering, economic, \nfinancial, social, and environmental studies will be carried out based on the general alignment. \nAn  EIA,  EMP,  resettlement  plan,  and  EMDP  (or  EMSA)  for  construction  of  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013\nLang Son Expressway will be prepared. The TA will also undertake a prefeasibility study on the \nGMS  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai  Expressway  Project  in  order  to  assess  its  economic  and  financial \nviability. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fProposed TA of $1.5 million for preparing the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project, \n42. \nto be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, \nwill be attached to the TA Loan Project. A summary of the proposed TA is provided in Appendix \n8.  The  TA  scope  covers  a  feasibility  study  for  the  whole  outer  ring  of  the  HCMC  Urban \nExpressway  and  access  to  the  HCMC\u2013Vung  Tau  Expressway,  as  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh \nExpressway  is  an  important  link  of  these  expressways.  The  engineering,  economic,  financial, \nsocial, and environmental studies will be carried out based on the planned alignment. An EIA, \nEMP,  resettlement  plan,  and  EMDP  (or  EMSA)  for  construction  of  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh \nExpressway will be prepared. Two bridges, or river tunnels, need to be constructed across the \nNha Be and Long Tau rivers. These rivers are used as navigation channels for large cargo ships \naccessing  the  HCMC  river  port.  Therefore,  if  bridges  are  selected,  long-spanned  bridges  with \n50\u201360  m  navigational  clearance  will  be  needed.  An  engineering  study  to  determine  the  river \ncrossing structures is included in the scope. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nThis project preparatory TA package, combining the project feasibility study and project \n43. \ndesign study, will help the Government and VEC ensure economic and financial viability of the \nlarge-scale  infrastructure  projects,  and  mitigate  social  and  environmental  risks  caused  by \nimplementation of the projects. Moreover, compared to the standard processing scheme, which \nprovides a TA loan for project design study after TA for the project feasibility study is completed, \nthe physical works would be able to commence more than 1 year earlier. In Viet Nam, project \nexecuting  agencies  cannot  start  consultant  recruitment  actions  before  the  project  loans  are \napproved.  Under  this  project  preparatory  TA  package,  ADB  will  take  advance  contracting \nactions for the consulting services on the project feasibility study to be funded by the associated \nTA grants, and VEC will start consultant recruitment for the project design study to be funded by \nthe TA loan after ADB approves the TA Loan Project with the associated TA grants.  \n \nThe main risk for the TA Loan Project is implementation delay caused by project internal \n44. \nand  external  factors.  The  consultant  selection  process  is  a  potential  cause  for  implementation \ndelay.  VEC  will  start  selection  of  the  consultant  for  the  project  design  study  immediately  after \napproval of the TA Loan Project. The decision-making process on the expressway alignments is \nanother  potential  cause  for  implementation  delay.  The  consultants  for  the  project  feasibility \nstudy  will  propose  expressway  alignments  based  on  engineering  difficulty,  construction  cost, \nand  social  and  environmental  impacts.  MOT  and  VEC  will  have  consultation  meetings  on  the \nexpressway  alignments  with  representatives \nthe  project  provinces,  districts,  and \ncommunes.  The  general  alignment  should  be  determined  before  the  detailed  design  study \nstarts. \n \n45. \nSocial.  Since  the  TA  Loan  Project  is  a  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  expressway \nprojects, it will not cause any adverse social impacts. The resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpact categories for the TA Loan Project are classified as category C. However, construction of \nthe  expressways  (under  the  ensuing  project  loans)  will  require  significant  involuntary \nresettlement,  including  relocation  of  houses  and  loss  of  agricultural  and  residential  land.  The \ngeneral  expressway  alignments  will  be  provided  under  the  associated  TA  projects,  paying \nattention  to  potential  negative  social  impacts.  The  associated  TA  projects  will  prepare  a \nresettlement plan, and an EMDP (or an EMSA) for each expressway project, and the TA Loan \nProject will assist VEC in updating these (based on the detailed design of the expressways) and \nimplementing the updated plans. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the TA \nLoan Project is provided in Appendix 12. \n \n\nfrom \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fEnvironment. Since the TA Loan Project is project preparatory TA for the expressway \n46. \nprojects,  it  will  not  cause  any  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  environmental  category  for \nthe TA Loan Project is classified as category C. The environmental impacts will be mitigated by \nthe  careful determination  of  expressway  alignments  under  the  associated  TA  projects  and  the \nTA  Loan  Project  by  avoiding  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  and  developing  environmentally \nfriendly highway designs. The associated TA grants will prepare an EIA and an EMP for each \nexpressway project, and the TA Loan Project will update these based on the detailed designs of \nthe expressways. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  VEC  have  given  the \n\n47. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe Borrower will cause VEC to ensure that the detailed design study services and \nother services to be provided under the TA Loan Project for any of the expressways \ndo  not  commence  until  the  feasibility  study  conducted  under  the  associated  TA \nprojects  for  the  relevant  expressway  has  been  completed  to  the  satisfaction  of  the \nGovernment, VEC, and ADB.  \nThe Borrower will ensure that VEC updates the EIAs, including the EMPs, taking into \naccount the detailed engineering design for the expressways in accordance with the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The Borrower will ensure that the \nprocurement documents for the civil works include specific measures as indicated in \nthe  EIA  and  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Environment  Policy  to  mitigate  negative \nenvironmental  impacts  caused  by  the  construction  of  the  expressways  and  related \nfacilities and activities and to give due consideration to prevention of damage to the \nnatural  environment  in  the  design,  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the \nexpressways and related facilities and activities. The Borrower will also ensure that \n(a)  specific  provisions  are  included  in  the  civil  works  and  consulting  services \ncontracts  for  the  implementation  of  the  EMPs  and  their  monitoring,  and  (b)  budget \nallowances are made for the implementation of these provisions. \nThe Borrower will ensure that VEC updates the resettlement plans and the EMDPs \nor EMSAs, as may be applicable, for the construction of the expressways and related \nfacilities  and  activities  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and \ntaking into account the final detailed engineering designs. The Borrower will further \nensure that VEC submits the updated resettlement plans and EMDPs or EMSAs to \nADB  for  approval,  and  that  the  updated  resettlement  plans  and  EMDPs  or  EMSAs \nare disclosed to the affected persons prior to submission to ADB. \nThe Borrower will ensure that (a) affected persons are compensated at replacement \ncost and assisted before they are displaced from their houses, land, and assets; and \n(b)  that  no  affected  persons  are  displaced  until  suitable  alternative  land  within  the \nsame or a neighboring commune has been allocated to them or compensation has \nbeen paid that is sufficient to purchase suitable alternative land within the same or a \nneighboring commune. \nIf,  at  any  time  after  a  resettlement  plan  has  been  approved  or  updated,  significant \nrealignment of any part of the expressway is required, the Borrower will revise and \nupdate  that  resettlement  plan  to  take  into  account  the  realignment.  The  updated \nresettlement plan will be updated in accordance with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n(vi) \n\nPolicy  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to  commencement  of  any  land \nacquisition  activities  for  the  realigned  part  of  the  relevant  expressway.  Significant \nrealignment  occurs  when  the  previously  approved  alignment  is  moved  entirely \noutside  the  construction  corridor  of  the  previous  design  by  a  distance  greater  than \n100  meters,  or  the  impact  of  the  realignment  increases  the  number  of  affected \npersons by more than 10%. \nThe  Borrower  will  ensure  that  VEC  contracts  an  external  monitoring  agency  (EMA) \nfor  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement  activities  and  that  the \nEMA\u2019s monitoring reports be uploaded onto VEC\u2019s website. The Borrower will ensure \nthat VEC submits copies of the EMA\u2019s monitoring reports to ADB every quarter until \nresettlement and income restoration programs are complete. \n\n(vii)  During  the  TA  loan  project  implementation,  VEC  will  have  in  place  sound  financial \nmanagement,  financial  reporting,  internal  controls,  and  internal  auditing  systems \nacceptable to ADB. \n\n(viii)  The Borrower will take all actions which will be necessary to enable VEC to perform \nits  obligations  under  the  Project  Agreement,  and  will  not  take  or  permit  any  action \nwhich would interfere with the performance of such obligations. \nThe  Borrower  will  exercise  its  rights  under  the  subsidiary  agreements  in  such  a \nmanner  as  to  protect  the  interests  of  the  Borrower  and  ADB  and  accomplish  the \npurpose of the loan. No rights or obligations under the subsidiary loan agreement will \nbe assigned, amended, abrogated, or waived without the prior concurrence of ADB. \n\n(ix) \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nIn addition to the standard conditions for loan effectiveness, the following are conditions \n\n48. \nfor loan effectiveness that are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nVEC  will  have  established  a  PIU3  for  the  TA  Loan  Project  headed  by  a  qualified \ndirector and suitably staffed. \nThe  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the  Government  and  VEC  will  have  been \nexecuted and be binding on the parties. \nThe Government will have approved TA letters for preparing the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang \nSon  and  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai  expressway  projects,  and  for  preparing  the  Ben  Luc\u2013\nLong Thanh Expressway Project. \n\nVII. \n\n RECOMMENDATION \n\n49. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  16,616,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet \nNam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son,  GMS  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai, \nand  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressways  Technical  Assistance  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 3.15% per annum during the life of the \nloan;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \n    President \n \n\n1 October 2008 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nEfficient movement of goods \nand people between \nnortheastern Viet Nam and \nGZAR, and within the \ngreater HCMC area, through \nconstruction of the three \nexpressways \n \n\nOutcome \nDesigns of the three \nexpressway projects agreed \nby the Government of Viet \nNam, VEC, ADB, and \ncofinanciers \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n17 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms  \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks  \n\n \n\u2022  Completion of the Ben Luc\u2013\nLong Thanh Expressway by \n2013, the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang \nSon Expressway by 2014, \nand the GMS Ha Long\u2013\nMong Cai Expressway by \n2015 \n\n\u2022  Travel time and costs \n\nreduced by at least 50% for \nHa Noi\u2013Nanning and Ha \nLong\u2013Nanning, and by 80% \nfor east\u2013west traffic in the \nsouthern HCMC area \n\u2022  Border crossing time \nreduced at Huu Nghi\u2013\nYouyiguan for cargo by 90% \nand goods by 50%; and at \nMong Cai\u2013Dongxing for \ncargo and goods by 50% \n\u2022  Traffic accidents reduced by \n20% on the Ha Noi\u2013Lang \nSon route and by 80% on \nthe Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai route \n\u2022  By 2016, cross-border trade \nand tourism between Viet \nNam and GZAR increased \nby at least 50% \n\n \n \n\u2022  Agreement on project \n\ndesigns for the Ben Luc\u2013\nLong Thanh Expressway by \n2010, the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang \nSon Expressway by 2011, \nand the GMS Ha Long\u2013\nMong Cai Expressway by \n2012  \n\n \n\n \n\u2022  ADB\u2019s surveys on travel \n\ntimes and costs of \ntransport between Ha Noi \nand Nanning, and \nbetween Ha Long and \nNanning \n\n\u2022  Trade and tourism \n\nstatistical yearbooks of \nViet Nam and GZAR, and \nborder trade and tourism \ndata at the Huu Nghi\u2013\nYouyiguan and Mong Cai\u2013\nDongxing border crossings \n\n\u2022  Traffic accident reports \nissued by the national \ngovernment and the \nproject provinces \n\n\u2022  ADB\u2019s surveys on traffic \nvolume, travel time, \norigin\u2013destination of trips \nin the HCMC area \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  Transport projects \nrelated to the three \nexpressways are \ncompleted on time \n\n\u2022  Stakeholders, \n\nincluding project-\naffected households, \ndo not oppose the \nexpressway projects \n\n\u2022  VEC has adequate \n\ncapacity in managing \nthe construction of the \nexpressway projects \n\u2022  Key provisions of the \nGMS CBTA related to \nfacilitation of frontier \ncrossing formalities \nand the exchange of \ntraffic rights \narrangements are \nimplemented between \nthe PRC and Viet \nNam \n\n \n\u2022  Project review missions \n\nand country programming \nmissions \n\n\u2022  Meetings with the \n\nGovernment of Viet Nam, \nVEC, and cofinanciers \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  Government priorities \nand agreements on \nprojects\u2019 designs \nremain the same \n\u2022  Funding sources for \n\nthe three expressway \nprojects are identified \n\n \n\n \n\nOutputs  \n1.

In  their \njoint declaration, the heads of governments of the six GMS countries called for accelerating the \nconstruction and improvement of the remaining sections of GMS corridors, and expanding the \ncorridor  network  through  multimodal  linkages.  They  endorsed  the  Vientiane  Plan  of  Action  for \nGMS Development (2008\u20132012), which includes the high-priority projects and programs in the \nnine  sectors  of  GMS  cooperation.  Items  under  the  Vientiane  Plan  of  Action  in  the  transport \nsector  were  derived  from  the  GMS  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study  (TSSS,  see  Box  A2)  and \nagreed  by  the  GMS  Transport  Forum.  The  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai \nexpressway projects are included in the Vientiane Plan of Action. The two expressway projects \n1 and the \nare also high-priority initiatives under the Two Corridors\u2013One Economic Ring initiative (cid:31)(cid:31)F\nPan-Beibu Gulf Cooperation Forum.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n\n2 \n\nBox A2: Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Sector Strategy (2006\u20132015) \n\nThe GMS Transport Sector Strategy was formulated under the auspices of Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional \ntechnical assistance, and endorsed by the six GMS governments in May 2006. It provides a subregional framework \nthat is implemented through individual national transport strategies and action plans in the six GMS countries. These \nstrategies  and  action  plans  are  supported  to  varying  degrees  with  sector  policy  statements,  strategies,  objectives, \npriorities, and individual project analyses. Although there are many regional and subregional cooperation groupings \ninvolved  in  transport  in  GMS  countries,  the  GMS  transport  sector  strategy  is  endorsed  at  the  highest  levels  of \nleadership in the six governments. This has provided the GMS with a leading role in coordinating and implementing \npriority subregional projects and initiatives. \n\nFormulation of the GMS transport sector strategy for the period to 2015 took account of the need for the following: \n\n(i)   sectoral focus that identifies factors critical to intraregional and transit trade and improved competitiveness (e.g., \nmissing links in the transport network and critical common needs such as maintenance, logistics, and multimodal \nintegration) and that are complementary to interregional and global trade;  \n\n(ii)  a  comprehensive  inter-sectoral  strategy  that  identifies  major  socioeconomic  trends  and  developments,  and \ndetermines  and  prioritizes  transport  initiatives  that  respond  to  these  needs;  and  that  is  a  subset  of  a \ncomprehensive  GMS  development  plan,  and  encompasses  country  and  regional  transport  and  related \ndevelopment strategies; and \n\n(iii)  goal  setting  and  a  results-oriented  management  plan  that  identifies  key  goals  of  economic  integration  and \nregional  cooperation  for  2015  and  beyond,  and  sets  performance  indicators  and  prioritizes  GMS  transport \ninitiatives to best realize these goals, e.g., the GMS as a \u201cgrowth bridge\u201d between the PRC and India, capitalizing \non the strategic location of the GMS, and the realization of Millennium Development Goals.  \n\nThe GMS Transport Sector Strategy identified five overarching goals for transport: (i) to exploit synergies in the GMS \ntransport system; (ii) to move towards an open market for transport services; (iii) to facilitate economic efficiency to \nreduce transport costs; (iv) to complete the  GMS network  and improve links  with South Asia; and (v)  to encourage \nmulti-modalism. \n\nSource: ADB. 2007.

Both  corridors  were  identified  by  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous \nRegion  (GZAR)  authorities  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  as  priority  cross-border \nroad links when GZAR became part of the GMS in early 2005.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe PRC is an important trade counterpart of Viet Nam. Table A2.1 shows the value of \nexports and imports of Viet Nam in the first 11 months of 2007. The PRC is the largest source of \nimports of Viet Nam based on value, and the third largest destination of Viet Nam\u2019s exports. Viet \nNam\u2019s total two-way trade with the PRC is estimated to have reached $15 billion in 2007. Viet \nNam exports rubber (24.8% of the total amount), coal (19.9%), crude oil (7.6%), wood product \n(5.2%), and computers, electrical goods, and components (3.5%) to the PRC, and imports steel \n(18.4%), machinery equipment and parts (18.1%), fertilizer (4.6%), computers, electrical goods, \nand components (4.2%), and petroleum (4.2%) from the PRC. \n \n\nTrade between Viet Nam and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \n\nTable A2.1: Exports and Imports of Viet Nam in the First 11 Months of 2007 \n($ million) \n\nExports \n\n \n\nUnited States \nJapan \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  \nAustralia \nSingapore \nWorld Total \n\n9,171 \n5,415 \n2,981 \n2,898 \n1,953 \n43,695 \n\nSource: General Department of Custom. \n\nImports \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nSingapore \nTaipei,China \nJapan \nRepublic of Korea \nWorld Total \n\n10,751 \n6,608 \n6,119 \n5,404 \n4,680 \n54,483 \n\n \n4. \nAs shown in Table A2.2, total exports from GZAR to Viet Nam rose from $454 million to \n$1.4 billion during the 3 years from 2004 to 2007, and imports rose from almost $300 million to \nover $950 million during the same period.

There  are  four  class  I  highways  border  ports  at  Mong  Cai\u2013Dongxing,  Huu \nNghi\u2013Youyiguan, Phuc Hoa\u2013Shuikou, and Hang Pao\u2013Long Ban, and one railway border port at \nHuu Nghi\u2013Youyiguan. Items transported from GZAR to Viet Nam are steel, chemical industrial \nproducts, and metal products; items transported from Viet Nam to GZAR are iron ore, minerals, \nand coal. Ocean transport is a major transport mode between Viet Nam and GZAR in terms of \ncargo volume, and it accounts for about 58% of the total volume. The share of road transport is \n33%  and  of  railway  transport  9%.  GZAR  mostly  exports  fruit,  textiles,  medicines,  garlic, \nelectronics, mung beans, and construction materials to Viet Nam through land transport routes. \nIts  imports  from  Viet  Nam  include  rubber,  starch,  fresh  longan,  iron  ore,  coal,  cashews,  and \ndried litchi.  \n \n6. \nBorder  trade,  which  has  increased  steadily  in  recent  years,  has  helped  stimulate \nsocioeconomic  development  in  the  border  areas.  Food  processing  companies  in  GZAR  have \nlarge demand for cassava. They can provide expertise in terms of agricultural technology to Viet \nNam,  and  contract  farming  arrangements  with  Viet  Nam  are  being  established.  There  are \ncontracted sugar plantations in Viet Nam, the outputs of which are transported back to GZAR. \nAgroprocessing areas for flour and cornstarch are found in Viet Nam. Chongzou City in GZAR \nat  the  border  with  Viet  Nam  is  famous  for  producing  high-quality  sugar.  GZAR  is  in  talks  with \nViet Nam to establish contract farming arrangements for Chinese herb plantations. GZAR can \nhelp  in  improving  the  access  of  less-developed  areas  in  northeastern  Viet  Nam  to  private \ncapital, agricultural and industrial technology, and managerial and entrepreneurial skills.  \n \n7. \nGZAR,  which  permanently  hosts  an  expo  between  the  PRC  and  the  Association  of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  in  Nanning,  is  a  gateway  for  PRC\u2013ASEAN  trade,  which  is \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n4 \nexpected to expand rapidly with the implementation of the PRC\u2013ASEAN free trade agreement.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nFor  the  ninth  year  in  a  row,  ASEAN  was  the  top  trading  partner  of  GZAR,  with  total  two-way \ntrade  reaching  almost  $3  billion  in  2007.  The  low  standard  of  infrastructure  in  neighboring \ncountries has been cited by GZAR authorities as a key constraint in further increasing trade and \ntourism between these countries and GZAR. A logistics park has been established in Pingxiang, \nGZAR,  which  included  the  establishment  of  e-ports  that  will  provide  a  platform  to  enhance \nefficiency  in  customs  clearing  operations.  Viet  Nam  and  GZAR  have  agreed  to  establish  a \ncross-border cooperation zone and industrial park at the Pingxiang\u2013Lang Son border area. \n \nC. \n\nCross-Border  Road  and  Railway  Infrastructure  between  Viet  Nam  and  Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region \n\n \nGZAR  has  two  of  the  three  trunk  highways  connecting  the  PRC  with  Viet  Nam.  One \n8. \nhighway is from Nanning to Ha Noi via Pingxiang and Lang Son, a distance of 419 kilometers \n(km).  The  distance  from  the  border  to  Lang  Son  is  18  km  and  to  Ha  Noi  130  km.  A  four-lane \n5 was opened to traffic \nexpressway from Nanning to Youyiguan, partly financed by an ADB loan, (cid:31)(cid:31)F\nin  December  2005,  and  will  connect  to  the  proposed  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  Expressway.  Another \nhighway connects Nanning to Ha Noi via Dongxing and Mong Cai, a distance of 538 km. A six-\nlane  expressway  from  Nanning  to  the  seaports  of  Fangcheng,  Quinzhou,  and  Beihai  was \ncompleted  in  1997.  A  four-lane  class  I  highway  from  Fangcheng  to  Dongxing  was  opened  to \ntraffic  at  the  end  of  2005.  A  new  four-lane  Fangcheng\u2013Dongxing  expressway,  which  will  be \nconnected to the proposed Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway, will be completed in 2011.  \n \n9. \nCross-border highway traffic in the last 3 years is set out in Table A2.3. The number of \ncross-border  passengers  reached  4.4  million  in  2007,  with  an  average  compounded  annual \ngrowth rate of 7.7%. Highway freight transport volume, after a sharp rise in 2003, continued to \ndecline. Statistics on cross-border passenger and freight traffic handled in GZAR are set out in \nTable A2.4. Currently, GZAR has four class I border-crossing highway ports and seven class II \nhighway  ports.  Among  the  four  class  I  highway  ports  in  GZAR,  Dongxing  highway  port  took \nabout  84%  of  total  cross-border  passengers  in  2007,  and  Pingxiang  and  Dongxing  highway \nports account for 62% of the total cross-border freight volume.   \n \n\n                                                 \n4   ASEAN.  2007.

Railway  freight  transport  between \nGZAR  and  Viet  Nam  has  recorded  a  sharp  increase  since  2000.  In  2007,  major  commodities \nexported  to  Viet  Nam  by  rail  included  steel  materials,  chemical  products,  and  metal  products. \nSteel materials amounted to 0.3 million t with an annual increase of 130.0%, chemical products \n0.1 million t with an annual increase of 44.5%, and metal products 0.07 million t with an annual \nincrease of 12.7%.

While road transport still has a larger share than railway transport, the volume and share \nof railway transport has been increasing. This indicates that the trading volume of bulky cargos \nsuch  as  steel  materials,  chemical  products,  and  metal  products  has  been  expanding.  It  is \nunlikely  that  these  bulk  cargos  will  be  diverted  to  road  transport.  Road  transport  remains  a \ndominant  transport  mode  for  time-sensitive  cargos  such  as  fresh  vegetable,  fruits,  seafood, \nprocessed food (chilled and refrigerated), everyday items, consumer electronics, machine parts, \nand  other  manufactured  goods.  It  is  observed  that  the  decrease  in  freight  volume  by  road \ntransport is related to slow customs control and necessary transshipment at the borders.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTourism Development \n\nThe  GMS  governments  have \n\nCross-Border Transport Facilitation in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n\nD. \n \n12. \nTourism in Guangxi grew rapidly in 2007, with the number of tourists in GZAR increasing \nby  11.5%  to  85.5  million  domestic  tourists  and  by  25.4%  to  2  million  international  tourists  per \nyear from 2006. Total income from tourism expanded by 20% in 2007, reaching CNY44.6 billion \n($6.6  billion),  equivalent  to  7%  of  GDP  in  GZAR.  Viet  Nam  is  a  key  contributor  to  the  rapid \ngrowth of international tourism for GZAR. There are partnerships between Viet Nam and GZAR \nto  mutually  promote  tourism.  In  2007,  tourist  numbers  from  Viet  Nam  were  231,800,  or  an \nannual  increase  of  19.3%.  The  daily  international  passenger  traffic  at  the  border  gate  in \nDongxing is about 10,000, of which tourists amounted to 3,000. The remaining 7,000 persons \ncrossing the Dongxing\u2013Mong Cai border are engaged in cross-border trade. \n \nIn  2007,  559,000  Chinese  tourists  visited  Viet  Nam\u2014an  annual  increase  of  8.2%.  The \n13. \nWorld  Heritage  Site  of  Ha  Long  Bay  in  Viet  Nam  is  a  popular  destination  among  Chinese \ntourists.  The  Quang  Ninh  provincial  government  prepared  a  master  plan  for  economic \ndevelopment,  which  targets  revenues  from  tourism  to  reach  D3  trillion  ($188  million)  by  2010 \nand D5 trillion ($313 million) by 2020. To achieve this, the provincial government is planning to \ndevelop four tourism areas, which include Ha Long Bay and Van Don island. Van Don island is \none the poorest areas in the province, but has abundant mangroves and beautiful scenery. The \nproposed GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway is planned to traverse Van Don island, and an \ninternational airport will be constructed on the island to help encourage ecotourism in the area. \n \nE. \n \nthat  providing  subregional  physical \nrecognized \n14. \ninfrastructure is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for increased connectivity among the \nsix GMS countries. Mitigating nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and \npeople is important to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and maximize the economic benefits of \nimproved subregional transport infrastructure. Nonphysical barriers impeding the free movement \nof  vehicles,  goods,  and  people  across  international  borders  in  the  subregion  include \n(i) restrictions  on  the  entry  of  motor  vehicles,  often  causing  costly  and  time-consuming \ntransshipment;  (ii)  different  standards  pertaining \nto  vehicle  size,  weight,  and  safety \nrequirements,  and  driver  qualifications;  (iii)  inconsistent  and  difficult  formalities  related  to \ncustoms  procedures,  inspections,  clearances,  and  assessment  of  duties;  (iv)  restrictive  visa \nrequirements;  and  (v)  inadequate  border  crossing  infrastructure  and  facilities.  Bilateral \nagreements on cross-border movement exist between many GMS members. These agreements, \nhowever,  only  partly  address  critical  cross-border  facilitation  issues,  and  hinder  transit \nmovement  of  vehicles,  goods,  and  people  to  third  countries.  In  addition,  the  bilateral \nagreements  existing  among  pairs  of  GMS  countries  are  not  necessarily  consistent  with  each \nother  and  run  the  risk  of  having  gaps  and  overlaps,  thereby  making  transport  facilitation  even \nmore  difficult.  Therefore,  a  multilateral  framework  to  facilitate  the  cross-border  movement  of \ngoods  and  people  on  a  subregion-wide  and  consistent  basis  is  necessary  to  allow  for  both \ninterstate and transit traffic. \n \nTo mitigate nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and people in \n15. \nthe  GMS,  the  six  countries  have  negotiated,  signed,  and  ratified  a  cross-border  transport \nagreement  (CBTA).  The  GMS  CBTA  is  a  multilateral  instrument  for  the  facilitation  of  cross-\nborder  transport  of  goods  and  people.  Formulated  under  the  auspices  of  a  series  of  ADB \ntechnical  assistance  projects,  the  CBTA  provides  a  practical  approach  to  streamlining \nregulations  and  reducing  nonphysical  barriers  in  the  GMS.  It  incorporates  the  principles  of \nbilateral or multilateral actions, and flexibility in recognition of differences in procedures in each \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nof the GMS countries. The implementing guidelines of the CBTA have all been signed, and are \nexpected  to  be  ratified  in  2008.  Full  implementation  of  the CBTA  is  expected  to  commence  in \n2010.  \n \nThe  CBTA  covers  all  the  relevant  aspects  of  cross-border  transport  facilitation  in  one \n16.  \ndocument.  These  include  (i)  single-stop  single-window  customs  inspection;  (ii)  cross-border \nmovement of persons (i.e., visas for persons engaged in transport operations); (iii) transit traffic \nregimes,  including  exemptions  from  physical  customs  inspection,  bond  deposit,  escort,  and \nagriculture and veterinary inspection; (iv) requirements that road vehicles will have to meet to be \neligible  for  cross-border  traffic  status;  (v)  exchange  of  commercial  traffic  rights;  and  (vi) \ninfrastructure, including road and bridge design standards, road signs, and signals. The CBTA \nwill  apply  to  selected  and  mutually  agreed  upon  routes  and  points  of  entry  and  exit  in  the \nsignatory  countries.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  between  Viet  Nam  and  the  PRC  was \nsigned in March 2008 by vice-ministers of transport of the two countries to include the Ha Noi\u2013\nLang Son corridor and the Huu Nghi\u2013Youyiguan border crossings in the scope of the CBTA. \n \n17.   A  bilateral  road  transport  agreement  between  Viet  Nam  and  the  PRC  is  in  effect \nbetween  the  two  countries,  but  its  scope  limits  access  for  trucks  in  one  country  to  only  the \nborder  areas  of  the  other  country.  Likewise,  the  costs  incurred  and  time  to  clear  the  border \ncheckpoint account for a significant portion of the total transport cost and time. When the CBTA \nenters into force between the PRC and Viet Nam, i.e., when both governments ratify the CBTA\u2019s \nimplementing  guidelines,  key  transport  facilitation  provisions  mentioned  above  will  be \nimplemented,  and  the  current  exchange  of  traffic  rights  arrangements  that  is  limited  to  the \nborder areas will be expanded to cover the entire Nanning\u2013Ha Noi corridor. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nROAD SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nRoad Asset and Road Traffic Conditions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  total  length  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  road  system  is  approximately  210,000  kilometers  (km), \n1. \nincluding 17,300 km of national roads, 17,450 km of provincial roads, 36,400 km of district roads, \n7,000 km of urban roads, and 131,500 km of rural roads. Out of the national road length, 83.5% \nis paved. National roads are the country\u2019s most important lifelines, but in 2004 only 44.8% of the \ntotal length was in good condition. The national road system is mainly of two-lane construction. \n \n2. \nThe economy of Viet Nam has been growing rapidly, with gross domestic product (GDP) \nrising  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  7.5%  during  2001\u20132005,  and  it  is  expected  to  grow  at  an \naverage annual rate of 10% up to 2010. Development of transport infrastructure is essential to \nachieve the rapid economic growth. Table A3.1 shows the transport sector road map. The shift \nfrom  motorcycles  to  passenger  cars  is  happening  in  urban  areas.  When  the  shift  happens \nnationwide,  the  national  road  system  as  it  stands  will  not  be  able  to  accommodate  traffic \ndemand.  Thus,  construction  of  expressway  networks  throughout  the  country  should  start  as \nsoon as possible.  \n \n\nTable A3.1: Viet Nam Transport Sector Road Map \n\n2015 \n \n\n2020 \n \n\n2006 \n \n\n2010 \n \n\n10 \n90 \n8 \n14 \n \n95 \n60 \n0 \n60 \n\n9.5 \n100 \n12 \n9 \n \n83 \n54 \n0 \n40 \n\n9 \n85 \n7 \n20 \n \n100 \n65 \n500 \n85 \n\n8 \n85 \n5 \n30 \n \n100 \n70 \n1,500 \n100 \n\n \nIndicators \nA.

Car ownership almost tripled in proportion to growth of GDP per capita \nduring the 10-year period. It is estimated that GDP per capita in Viet Nam will exceed $1,000 in \n2010 and a rapid increase in car ownership will then be seen in Viet Nam. \n \n4. \nRoad  traffic  is  concentrated  on  national  roads  and  around  major  urban  centers.  Rising \nlevels of motorization are a major challenge to transport planners and policy makers, especially \nin large urban areas and on primary intercity roads. The Government has started to undertake \ndevelopment  of  high-quality  highways,  designed  for  operating  speeds  which  exceed  current \nnational-road  levels\u2014i.e.,  expressways.  On  the  basis  of  preliminary  economic  and  financial \nappraisals and rationalization, the expressway construction programs shown in Table A3.2 were \n\nExpressway Master Plan \n\n                                                 \n1 China Statistics Bureau. 2008.

VEC\u2019s charter capital is D1,000 billion (about $62 million). The Ministry of Finance has \nreleased  D50  billion  to  VEC  but  the  remaining  capital  has  been  provided  in-kind  by  granting \nVEC  toll  collection  rights  for  the  Cau  Gie  and  Phu  Dong  toll  plazas  for  10  years,  starting  1 \nJanuary  2005.  By  31  December  2005,  VEC\u2019s  total  funds  were  D281.4  billion,  of  which \nD152.4 billion  had  been  released  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance\u2014in  addition  to  the  D50  billion \nallocation provided on the establishment of VEC\u2014and a further D79 billion from toll collection \nrevenues.    \n \n6. \n \n\nArticle 4 of VEC\u2019s charter sets out the following areas in which VEC is to operate: \n\nin  expressway  construction,  management,  maintenance,  and \n\ninvestment \norganizing toll collection on national expressways; \ninvestment in construction of other transport infrastructure by different modalities; \nprovision  and  operation  of  roadside  facilities  along  expressways,  such  as  rest \nhouses, restaurants, filling stations, advertisements, and provision of construction \nmaterials; \ntransport  engineering  consultancy,  including  studying  national  expressway \nnetwork development, preparing prefeasibility studies and feasibility studies, and \ndesigning and supervising transport infrastructure construction works; and \ndevelopment of roadside facilities adjacent to expressways. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n \n\nThe  immediate  objective  for  VEC  was  to  prepare  an  expressway  master  plan  and  complete \npreparations  for  the  construction  of  new  expressways  based  on  the  expressway  master  plan. \nVEC also has to identify and employ a large number of technically qualified staff to implement \nits activities. \n \n2 a review was \n7. \nundertaken  of  (i)  government  policies,  laws,  regulations,  decrees,  circulars,  and  charters \n\nUnder Asian Development Bank-funded technical assistance (TA) project,(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005.

This study identified a number \nof issues that must be addressed, these issues are presented below. \n\n \n1. \n\nOrganizational Structure \n\n \n8. \nVEC was established with an organizational structure intended for the start-up phase. As \nof  January  2007,  VEC  was  implementing  two  construction  projects  and  had  management \nsystems in place for these. However, present tolling operations are limited to two toll plazas; it \ndoes not have any expressway operating and maintenance contracts in place; it is not providing \nany  additional  support  activities  to  expressways,  such  as  roadside  facilities;  and  processes  to \nenable public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) have not been put in place. Further, VEC has limited \ncapacity  to  manage  the  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  expressways.  To  administer \nthe proposed expressway programs, VEC needs to expand its capacity to enable it to manage a \nnumber  of  large,  complex  projects  and  to  take  on  new  activities  in  terms  of  additional  skills. \nVEC was established as a fully owned SOE under MOT, however the Law on State Enterprises \nrequires  all  SOEs  to  be  converted  into  a  company  operating  under  the  Law  on  Enterprises \nbefore 2010. These demands require revision of the organizational structure. With funding from \nADB,  an  expressway  network  development  plan  report  was  prepared  that  recommends \nrevisions  to  the  organizational  framework,  but  these  recommendations  need  to  be  refined  for \nimplementation. \n \n9. \nVEC  has  established  a  project  management  team  to  manage  implementation  of  the \n3 VEC  is  strengthening  the  environmental  unit \nADB-funded  Noi  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  Highway  Project.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nand the social and resettlement unit within its technical department to provide overall guidance \non environmental, social and resettlement matters, coordinating closely with MOT and the local \nauthorities. The project management team, comprising a headquarters office in Ha Noi and four \nfield offices in Vinh Phuc, Phu Tho, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai provinces, has responsibility for day-\nto-day  project  implementation.  The  field  offices  coordinate  with  the  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees  and  district  people\u2019s  committees  on  civil  works,  environmental  management, \nimplementation  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities,  and  livelihood  development \nand income restoration program. \n \n\n2. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Framework \n\n \nThe  TA  project  undertook  a  review  of  legal  and  regulatory  documents  that  apply  to \n10. \nexpressways. This study identified a number of issues that need to be addressed either through \nclarifications  to  existing  laws  or  regulations  or  through  new  laws  or  regulations.  Of  particular \nconcern is Circular 90, covering toll regimes for roads. As presently formulated, this circular is \nvery restrictive in terms of ceilings on toll rates, which may have consequences for the financial \nviability of some expressways. The TA also recommended how this circular could be revised to \naccommodate more flexible toll arrangements. \n \nThere  is  a  need  to  improve  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment  for  private  sector \n11. \ninvestment in the transport sector. Although there is a generic PPP law, this is not tailored to the \nspecific requirements of road sector PPPs. Further, existing road sector laws do not provide a \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2007.

Initiating  and  attracting  private  investor  interest  to  road \nsector  PPPs  depends  on  a  comprehensive  policy;  such  a  policy  is  absent  in  Viet  Nam.  The \n4 is  presently  in  progress.  This  study \nWorld  Bank-funded  study  on  PPP  in  the  road  sector(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nobjective is to assist MOT to formulate a strategy for development of the road sector with PPPs, \nand the preparation of a policy framework for private sector participation in toll roads. \n \n\n3. \n\nTraining Needs \n\n \nAs  of  August  2006,  VEC  employed  96  staff,  most  of  whom  (79%)  have  university  or \n12. \npostgraduate  degrees  in  transport-related  subjects.  Given  that  VEC  is  a  new  organization, \nmany staff require training to fully engage in their roles and responsibilities. VEC plans to train \nstaff in the future through technical courses on financial management and engineering design, \nmaking  use  of  courses  at  both  domestic  and  overseas  universities  and  colleges.  The \nExpressway Network Development Plan TA undertook an initial assessment of training needs, \nbut  the  proposed  program  needs  to  be  completed  once  work  on  the  revised  organizational \nstructure has been completed. \n\n \n4. \n\nFinancial and Asset Management Systems \n\nTraffic Accidents and Road Safety \n\n \n13. \nVEC  is  currently  operating  using  standard  accounting  software  to  record  all  financial \ntransactions. However, a financial management system is needed to allow data to be accessed \nand  analyzed  to  meet  needs  other  than  formal  financial  reporting.  The  Expressway  Network \nDevelopment Plan TA also identified a need for an asset management system. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nFatalities and injuries rapidly increased in the late 1990s. This increase stopped in 2002, \nand the number of traffic accident injuries has substantially declined since then. However, traffic \naccident  fatalities  are  still  12,000\u201313,000  per  year  from  2003  to  2007.  Construction  of  high-\nquality design standard highways is effective in improving road safety. Improvement of National \nHighway  No. 1  (NH1)  started  in  1994  and  completed  in  2006  under  official  development \n5 funded by ADB and other development partners. NH1 generally has a four-\nassistance projects(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nlane  access-controlled  structure  in  urban  and  suburban  areas  and  two-lane  access-free \nstructure in rural areas. Table A3.3 shows traffic accident data on NH1 during the period from \n2003  to  2006,  in  which  the  highway  improvement  was  completed  in  many  sections  of  NH1.  It \nwas found that the number of traffic accidents has reduced drastically, from 399 in 2003 to 68 in \n2006, and the number of fatalities and injuries in 2006 was one-fifth of 2003 levels.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4   World  Bank.  2008.

Table A3.4 shows that the costs \nof  crossing the  border  accounted  for  48%  of  total  transport  costs  in  2006,  and  that  the  time  it \ntook to clear the border checkpoints accounts for 37% of the total transport time of 19 hours. It \nalso shows the potential reduction in costs and time for border crossing clearance if the CBTA is \nimplemented  along  the  Nanning\u2013Ha  Noi  corridor.

One of the logistics companies mentioned that at least 3 days \nis required to transport cargo from Nanning to Ha Noi, although the travel time from Nanning to \nHa Noi without the cross-border procedure is estimated at only 5 hours. It is estimated that more \nthan 2 days are spent for clearances and transshipment at the border. The transport and trade \ncompanies  in  Nanning  have  a  strong  desire  for  cross-border  facilitation  and  transshipment \nfacilities for unloading and loading in Viet Nam to be developed as soon as possible. \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2007.

In  the \nmemorandum of understanding between the Government of Viet Nam and ADB, it was agreed \nthat the TA would be included in the ADB nonlending program for 2008. A mission visited Viet \nNam on 17\u201329 April 2008 and held initial discussions with the Government on the proposed TA. \nAgreements  were  reached  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and outline terms of reference for the TA consultants.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  Expressway  is  proposed  to  be  constructed  parallel  to \nNational  Highway  (NH)  1,  which  was  upgraded  under  the  ADB-assisted  Second  Road \n2 as well as to the single-track railway in northern Viet Nam leading to the \nImprovement Project,(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR). It forms part of the GMS Eastern Corridor (Map \n3 as  one  of \n2),  which  was  identified  under  the  GMS  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study  (TSSS)(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nnine  transport  corridors,  which  runs  from  Nanning  in  GZAR  to  Ha  Noi.  Along  the  proposed \nexpressway  route,  in  Bac  Ninh  and  Bac  Giang  provinces  traffic  is  considerable,  while  in  Lang \nSon province it is low. It currently takes 3 hours to drive from Ha Noi to the border town of Dong \nDang  in  Lang  Son  province.  Cross-border  trade  between  GZAR  and  Viet  Nam  has  been \nexpanding at about 4% per year. However, cargo transported by trucks peaked in 2003 and has \nbeen  declining  since  then.  It  is  observed  that  the  decrease  in  truck  freight  is  related  to  slow \ncustoms control and necessary transshipment at the borders. On both sides of the border posts, \nmany trucks stand by for customs clearance of cargos. This expressway, which will link with the \nADB-assisted  expressway  from  Nanning,  the  capital  of  GZAR,  to  the  border  town  of \n4 combined with streamlining of cross-border operations, is expected to boost cross-\nYouyiguan,(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nborder  trade  between  Viet  Nam  and  GZAR.  There  is  only  one  passenger  train  that  operates \ndaily,  as  passenger  traffic  appears  to  have  shifted  to  the  improved  NH1.  On  average,  eight \nfreight trains run per week, transporting mainly heavy materials and products such as ore and \nsteel. It is less likely, therefore, that there will be a modal shift arising from the construction of \nthe GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway.  \n \n3. \nNH18 runs along the northern coast from Ha Long to Mong Cai, through Mong Duong. It \nis identified as a priority GMS transport project under the TSSS. The distance between Ha Long \nand Mong Cai is about 200 km. NH18 has four lanes in city areas and two lanes in other places \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 May 2008. \n2   ADB.  1996.

Technical Assistance for Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Sector Strategy Study, Manila (RETA \n6195). The objective of the GMS transport sector strategy study is to establish a well-built, seamless, multimodal \nsubregional transport network that will contribute significantly to fully connecting the GMS. It was endorsed by the \nGMS governments in May 2007.  \n\n4   ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Guangxi Road Development Project. Manila (Loan 1851-PRC). The project was \ncompleted on 31 January 2008. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nand  is  generally  in  good  condition,  except  for  a  10\u201320  km  section  from  Mong  Cai,  which  is  in \npoor condition. NH18 is being used as a heavy freight route, with an estimated 500 truck-trailers \ndaily carrying 40-foot maritime containers. The containers arrive at Hai Phong port in northern \nViet Nam and are immediately transported to GZAR. Passenger bus services are available, but \nthere  is  no  railway  service.  The  geometric  alignment  of  NH18  is  within  acceptable  standards, \nbut  curve  radius  and  lane  widths  are  considered  too  sharp  and  narrow  for  truck-trailers.  The \nroad has high traffic accident rates. It also has many short bridges, which have a load limit of 13 \ntons  (t)  and  are  unable  to  support  truck-trailers  carrying  40-foot  maritime  containers.  In  this \nregard,  a  new  highway  of  acceptable  design  standards  should  be  considered  in  order  to \nimprove  road  safety  in  the  influence  area  of  NH18,  as  well  as  to  maintain  the  road  assets  of \nNH18. The use of NH18 as a long-term freight route, however, remains uncertain, and, as such, \nit  is  important  to  carry  out  transport  and  trade  analyses,  survey  related  infrastructure \ndevelopment in the influence area, and carry out traffic flow assessment between Viet Nam and \nGZAR along this highway.  \n \n4. \nA  key  constraint  to  the  efficient  transnational  movement  of  goods  and  people  between \nViet  Nam  and  GZAR  is  nonphysical  and  nontariff  barriers  that  are  caused  by  the  lack  of \nharmonized  and  streamlined  rules  and  regulations  for  cross-border  traffic.  These  include \n(i) restrictions  on  the  entry  of  motor  vehicles,  often  causing  costly  and  time-consuming \ntransshipment;  (ii)  different  standards  pertaining \nto  vehicle  size,  weight,  and  safety \nrequirements,  and  driver  qualifications;  (iii)  inconsistent  and  difficult  formalities  related  to \ncustoms  procedures,  inspections,  clearances,  and  assessment  of  duties;  (iv)  restrictive  visa \nrequirements;  and  (v)  inadequate  border  crossing  infrastructure  and  facilities.  A  bilateral  road \ntransport agreement between Viet Nam and the PRC is in effect between the two countries, but \nits scope limits access for trucks in one country to only the border areas of the other country. \nLikewise,  the  costs  incurred  and  time  taken  to  clear  the  border  checkpoint  account  for  a \nsignificant portion of the total transport cost and time. Estimates of the transport costs and time \nfor a shipment of one full truckload of steel weighing 30 t from Nanning to Ha Noi were made \nunder  an  ADB-assisted  logistics  development  study  for  the  GMS  north\u2013south  economic \n5 They showed that the costs of crossing the border account for 48% of total transport \ncorridor.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ncosts of about $27/t, and that the time it takes to clear the border checkpoints accounts for 37% \nof the total transport time of 19 hours.  \n \n5. \nTo mitigate nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and people in \nthe  GMS,  the  six  countries  have  negotiated,  signed,  and  ratified  a  cross-border  transport \nagreement  (CBTA).  The  implementing  guidelines  of  the  CBTA  have  all  been  signed,  and  are \nexpected  to  be  ratified  in  2008.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  between  Viet  Nam  and  the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  was  signed in  March  2008  by  vice-ministers  of  transport  of \nthe two countries to include the Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son corridor and the Huu Nghi\u2013Youyiguan border \ncrossings  in  the  scope of  the  CBTA.  When  the  CBTA  between  Viet  Nam  and  the  PRC  enters \ninto force, i.e., when both governments ratify the CBTA\u2019s implementing guidelines, key transport \nfacilitation  provisions  of  the  CBTA  will  be  implemented,  and  the  scope  of  the  existing  bilateral \nroad transport agreement will be expanded to cover the entire Ha Noi\u2013Nanning corridor.  \n \nBoth  expressway  projects  are  likely  to  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impact \n6. \nthat  is  sensitive,  diverse,  or  unprecedented,  and  affects  an  area  broader  than  the  sites  or \nfacilities  where  the  physical  works  will  be  carried  out.  An  environmental  impact  assessment \n(EIA) for each project will be prepared. Both expressway projects will require a large amount of \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2006.

Manila (RETA 6310). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\nland acquisition and resettlement. A full resettlement plan for each project will be prepared. For \nthe GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway Project, ethnic minority groups account for a large part \nof the population in the project area. In Lang Son province, ethnic minority people account for \n86% of the population, and in Bac Giang province they account for 12%. Ethnic minority people \nare  likely  to  be  affected  by  the  Project  because  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  For  the \nGMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project, the major ethnic groups account for 95% of the \npopulation  in  Quang  Ninh  province,  and  the  percentage  of  the  ethnic  minority  people  is  low. \nHowever,  in  some  of  the  mountainous  districts  crossed  by  the  different  project  options,  the \npercentage of ethnic minority people is much higher (75% in Ba Che and 42% in Tien Yen). If \nimpacts  on  the  ethnic  minorities  living  in  the  project  areas  are  significant,  an  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  plan  (EMDP)  will  be  prepared  to  address  the  concerns  of  the  ethnic  minorities. \nThe  two  expressway  projects  will  increase  the  inter-border  traffic  between  the  PRC  and  Viet \nNam,  which  could  also  increase  the  risk  of  the  spread  of  HIV  as  well  as  the  risk  of  human \ntrafficking. \n \n7. \nThe  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation  (VEC)  was  established  in  October  2004,  as  a \nstate-owned  enterprise under  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT),  with  responsibility  for  planning, \nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  expressway  network  in  the  country.  In \naccordance  with  the  expressway  master  plan,  VEC  is  implementing  several  expressway \nprojects so that the total length of expressways open to the public traffic may reach 500 km by \n2015.  Also,  VEC  is  expected  to  transform  from  a  state-owned  enterprise  to  a  financially \nautonomous  infrastructure  provider.  ADB  provides  its  loan  funds  for  expressway  construction \nand  has  also  been  supporting  VEC\u2019s  capacity  building  on  expressway  planning,  legal  and \nregulatory  framework,  corporate  financing  management,  business  development  plans,  project \nimplementation,  operation  and \nimplementation  management,  safeguard  planning  and \nmaintenance of expressways, asset management, and private sector involvement. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe expected impact of the TA is efficient transnational movement of goods and people \nbetween  Viet  Nam  and  GZAR  through  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai \nexpressway projects. Together with a network of expressways linking Ha Noi and Kunming, and \nKunming and Nanning, the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressways will \ncomplete an \u201ceconomic triangle\u201d connecting key development centers in Viet Nam and the PRC. \nThis  economic  triangle  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the  GMS  will  support  the  GMS  program\u2019s \nstrategic objectives of enhanced connectivity, competitiveness, and community in the GMS. \n \n9. \nTogether  with  detailed  design  studies  to  be  carried  out  under  the  associated  TA  loan \nproject,  the  TA  will  result  in  the  identification  of  economically,  technically,  socially,  and \nenvironmentally  feasible  expressway  projects  that  will  link  northeastern  Viet  Nam  with  GZAR, \nwhich will be agreed by the Government of Viet Nam, VEC, and ADB. Under the TA, technical \nfeasibility  analyses  and  assessments  will  be  carried  out,  including  (i)  expressway  general \nalignment,  (ii)  cost-effective  project  design,  (iii)  evaluation  of  economic  feasibility  and  financial \nviability, and (iv) social and environmental viability for the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013\nMong Cai expressway projects.  \n \nD. \n \nGiven  the  strong  regional  dimensions  of  the  two  expressway  projects,  the  TA  will  give \n10. \nspecial  emphasis \nfacilitation, \ncompetitiveness and complementarities of freight transportation from a multimodal perspective, \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nto  cross-border  aspects, \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\ntransport  and \n\nincluding \n\ntrade \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nand  development  of  cross-border  tourism  between  northern  Viet  Nam  and  GZAR.  The  TA  will \nundertake  a  feasibility  study  on  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  Expressway  Project.  The  general \nalignment of the expressway will be determined, taking appropriate consideration of social and \nenvironmental impacts and cost-effectiveness. The engineering, economic, financial, social, and \nenvironmental  studies  will  be  carried  out  based  on  the  general  alignment.  The  TA  will  also \nundertake a prefeasibility study on the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project to assess \nits economic and financial viability. \n \nThe  expected  outputs  of  the  TA  will  include  rationale  (sector  performance,  problems, \n11. \nand  opportunities),  design  and  monitoring  frameworks  (impact,  outcome,  outputs,  and  inputs), \nspecific  features,  cost  estimates,  benefits  and  impacts,  assumptions  and  risks,  economic  and \nfinancial feasibility assessment, environmental impact assessments, resettlement plans, EMDPs \nor  ethnic  minority  specific  actions  (EMSAs),  gender  action  plans,  and  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking prevention programs for the two expressway projects. The consulting services will be \nundertaken  so  that  processing  of  the  investment  loan  for  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son \nExpressway Project may be completed by 2011, and processing of the investment loan for the \nGMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project may be completed by 2012.  \n \nE. \n \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.875  million  equivalent,  of  which  $1.5 million  will  be \n12. \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  VEC  will  finance  $375,000  to \nundertake  additional  engineering  surveys.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Table  A7.  The \nGovernment  and  VEC  have  been  informed  that  approval  of  the  TA  Loan  Project  and  the \nassociated TA grants does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n\nCost and Financing \n\nTable A7: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n\n  \n \n \n\nTotal Cost \n\nItem \nA.

The director for PIU3 will have the overall responsibility for supporting \nthe implementation of the TA and for providing guidance, administrative and technical support, \ncounterpart  staff,  documentation,  and  other  services  that  may  be  required.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 1.5 years, which will commence in January 2009 and end in June 2010. \n \n14. \nThe consulting services for the TA will be undertaken by an international consulting firm \nin  association  with  national  consultants.

In the memorandum of understanding between the Government of \nViet  Nam  and  ADB,  it  was  agreed  that  the  TA  would  be  included  in  the  ADB  nonlending \nprogram for 2008. A mission visited Viet Nam on 17\u201329 April 2008 and held initial discussions \nwith the Government on the proposed TA. Agreements were reached on the impact, outcome, \noutputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of \nreference for the TA consultants.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n \nB. \n \n2. \nHo  Chi  Minh  City  (HCMC)  is  the  largest  city  in  Viet  Nam  and  the  country\u2019s  economic \nhub,  with  a  population  (including  both  the  permanent  and  the  transient  population)  forecast  to \ngrow  by  2.1%  yearly  from  the  current  7.9 million  to  10.3  million  by  2020.  The  volume  of  trade \nthrough HCMC\u2019s port grew by more than 15% in value in 2006. With economic growth expected \nto continue in the medium term, and households earning higher incomes, many  more families \nwill  be  able  to  buy  cars  and  the  number  of  journeys  undertaken  will  significantly  increase. \nAlready, the roads within and around HCMC are becoming heavily congested, travel speeds are \ndropping,  and  transport  costs  are  rising.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  provide  relief  to  the  city \nroads connecting the center of HCMC and the port area with the suburbs to the city, and, farther \nout, to the roads leading north from the city to central and northern Viet Nam. In the southern \narea of HCMC, east\u2013west traffic is restricted due to lack of bridges and tunnels across the Nha \nBe River and its tributary streams in the Mekong Delta. Goods and people are forced to travel \nby way of the center of HCMC, and this raises concerns about traffic levels in the city center. \n \n3. \nAs part of development planning for HCMC, several master plans have been prepared to \ndeal  with  the  needs  of  specific  sectors.  A  transport  master  plan  was  prepared  in  2004,  with \n2 This plan was later consolidated \nassistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nwith a second master plan prepared by the People\u2019s Committee of Ho Chi Minh City and work \ndone  by  the  Ministry  of  Transport\u2019s  Technical  Engineering  and  Design  Institute.  This \nconsolidated  transport  master  plan,  approved  by  the  Government  in  January  2007,  sets  out  a \n$26 billion investment program up to 2020. The Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh section is included in the \nprogram. \n \nThe 60-km Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway will be a southern link of the outer ring of \n4. \nHCMC urban expressway as well as a short link of the north\u2013south expressway in Viet Nam. It \nwill be connected to the planned HCMC\u2013Vung Tau Expressway, which forms part of the GMS \nsouthern economic corridor route from Bangkok to Phnom Penh, HCMC, and Vung Tau. Due to \nthe lack of river bridges and tunnels in the southern area of HCMC, the proposed expressway \nwill have significant impacts on socioeconomic activities in the cities and towns around HCMC. \nThe proposed feasibility study will cover the whole outer ring expressway of HCMC, as well as \n\n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 May 2008. \n2   Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2004. The Study on Urban Transport Master Plan and Feasibility Study in \n\nHo Chi Minh Metropolitan Area. Ho Chi Minh City. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\naccess  to  the  HCMC\u2013Vung  Tau  expressway.  Two  bridges,  or  river  tunnels,  need  to  be \nconstructed across the Nha Be and Long Tau rivers, which are used as navigation channels for \nlarge cargo ships accessing the HCMC river port. If bridges are selected, these will have to be \nlong-spanned, cable-suspension bridges with a 50\u201360 meter (m) navigational clearance. \n \n5. \nThe  Project  is  located  north  of  the  Can  Gio  protected  area.  The  Can  Gio  mangrove \necosystem  has  been  recognized  as  an  international  biosphere  reserve  by  United  Nations \nEducational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  in  2000.  Even  if  the  proposed \nalignment is outside of the protected area, wetlands with mangroves could be present along the \nalignment. Terrestrial ecology field surveys will be conducted with a focus on species presence, \ndistribution,  and  condition  in  mangrove  ecosystems.  The  proposed  expressway  will  link  to \nProvincial  Road  15  (currently  being  rehabilitated),  which  goes  through  the  Can  Gio  mangrove \nforest. Linkage with the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway is expected to increase the number \nof visitors in the protected area and lead to high pressure on land development in this area. The \neastern part of the expressway crosses lowland terrain with an altitude of 0\u20131 m. This area is a \nsunken,  low  delta  with  alum  soil,  and  could  be  inundated  by  tidal  movements.  The  Project  is \nlikely  to  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impact  that  is  sensitive,  diverse,  or \nunprecedented, and affects an area broader than the sites or facilities where the physical works \nwill be carried out.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe expected impact of the TA is efficient movement of goods and people in the greater \nHCMC  area  through  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway.  The  expressway  will  strengthen \nconnectivity  in  the  cities  and  towns  around  HCMC,  and  will  provide  an  efficient,  safe,  and \nreliable  express  route  in  HCMC  and  its  outskirt  areas.  It  will  also  help  reduce  road  traffic \nconcerns  in  the  greater  HCMC  area,  such  as  traffic  congestion,  accidents,  and  noise  and  air \npollution. \n \n7. \nTogether  with  detailed  design  studies  to  be  carried  out  under  the  associated  TA  Loan \nProject,  the  TA  will  result  in  the  identification  of  an  economically,  technically,  socially,  and \nenvironmentally  feasible  expressway  project,  which  will  be  agreed  by  the  Government  of  Viet \nNam, the Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC), and ADB. Under the TA, technical feasibility \nanalyses  and  assessments  will  be  carried  out,  including  (i)  expressway  alignment,  (ii)  cost-\neffective  project  design,  (iii)  evaluation  of  economic  feasibility  and  financial  viability,  and  (iv) \nsocial and environmental viability for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project. The TA will \nalso help strengthen the capacity of VEC as the executing agency for the ensuing expressway \nprojects. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe  TA  scope  covers  technical  feasibility  study  for  the  whole  outer  ring  of  the  HCMC \nurban expressway, and access to the HCMC\u2013Vung Tau Expressway. General alignment of the \nBen  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway  will  be  determined,  taking  into  consideration  social  and \nenvironmental impacts and cost-effectiveness. The engineering, economic, financial, social, and \nenvironmental studies will be carried out based on the general alignment. Moreover, two bridges \nor river tunnels need to be constructed across the Nha Be and Long Tau rivers. These rivers are \nused  as  navigation  channels  for  large  cargo  ships  accessing  the  HCMC  river  port.  The \nengineering study is important to determine the river crossing structures. \n \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n45 \n\nThe  expected  outputs  of  the  TA  will  include  rationale  (sector  performance,  problems, \n9. \nand  opportunities),  design  and  monitoring  frameworks  (impact,  outcome,  outputs,  and  inputs), \nspecific  features,  cost  estimates,  benefits  and  impacts,  assumptions  and  risks,  economic  and \nfinancial  feasibility  assessment,  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  resettlement  plan  for \nthe  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway  Project.  The  TA  will  also  formulate  recommendations \nrelated to VEC, including: (i) institutional development; (ii) corporate financing management; and \n(iii)  operation  and  maintenance  of  expressways,  and  integration  of  the  existing  traffic \nmanagement  system.  The  consulting  services  will  be  undertaken  so  that  processing  of  the \ninvestment loan for the expressway project may be completed by early 2010. \n \nE. \n \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.875  million  equivalent,  of  which  $1.5 million  will  be \n10. \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. VEC \nwill finance $375,000 to undertake additional engineering surveys. Detailed cost estimates are \nin  Table  A8.  The  Government  and  VEC  have  been  informed  that  approval  of  the  TA  Loan \nProject and the associated TA grants does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n\nCost and Financing \n\nTable A8: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n\n  \n \n \n\nTotal Cost \n\nItem \nA.

The  consultants  will  be  hired  by  ADB  according  to  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and its quality- and \ncost-based  recruitment  procedures.  Short-listed  international  consulting  firms  must  submit  full \ntechnical  proposals.  The  quality\u2013cost  ratio  is  90:10,  reflecting  the  complexity  of  the  consulting \nservices. About 117 person-months of consulting inputs will be required\u201452 person-months of \ninternational  consultant  services  and  65 person-months  of  national  consultant  services.  The \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  traffic  and  highway  engineering,  (ii)  transport  economics, \n(iii)  financial  analysis  and  expressway  operations,  (iv)  environmental  impact  assessment, \n(v) resettlement planning, (vi) social and poverty analysis, (vii) social development and gender, \n(viii)  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  control,  and  (ix)  institutional  development.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nViet  Nam\u2019s  record  in  poverty  reduction  has  been  impressive  in  the  last  decade.  The  proportion  of  the  population  below  the \npoverty line has declined from around 59% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The proposed target for the Five-Year Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (2006\u20132010) is to reduce poor households to 15%\u201316% by 2010. While significant in terms of magnitude, \nprogress in poverty reduction remains fragile, with a significant number of \u201cnear poor\u201d clustered just above the poverty line. \nSustained development requires modernization and improvement of physical infrastructure and associated services. \n \nExpressways  are  intended  to  serve  long-distance  traffic.  They  do  not  necessarily  benefit  local  communities  directly,  but \naddress  poverty  in  areas  around  the  expressway  indirectly  by  facilitating  continued  economic  growth.  The  proposed  three \nexpressways are crossing areas with very different rates and types of poverty.  \n \nHowever, improved transport infrastructure is critical for sustained rapid economic growth and overall poverty reduction, and \ncan contribute to regionally balanced and equitable economic growth by stimulating agriculture production, increasing access \nto employment opportunities, and facilitating better access to social services.  \n \nAccording to the Vietnam Poverty Update Report 2006,a considerable investment in infrastructure is widely believed to have \ncontributed to raising people\u2019s welfare and to reducing poverty. The lack of infrastructure is recognized as a major reason for \nthe high rate of poverty in the rural and remote isolated localities, and good efforts have been made in this area to promote \nmore  inclusive  development  in  Viet  Nam,  rather  than  leaving  part  of  the  population  disconnected  from  the  mainstream  of \neconomic growth. Improved road connectivity under the proposed Project might contribute to poor people\u2019s ability to benefit \nfrom economic growth in the long run. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nConsiderable  progress  has  been  made  in  reducing  poverty  in  Viet  Nam.  According  to  the  Vietnam  Poverty  Update  Report \n2006, the largest improvement  was in the northeast region, including Lang Son and Quang Ninh provinces (crossed  by the \nGMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Song and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressways) where the incidence of poverty fell from 86% in 1993 to 29% \nin 2004, a reduction of 57 percentage points over 11 years. There was similarly rapid poverty reduction in the Red River Delta \nregion,  including  Bac  Giang  Province  (the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  Expressway),  where  the  incidence  of  poverty  fell  by  51 \npercentage points during the same period, from 63% in 1993 to 12% in 2004. In the southeast region, including Ho Chi Minh \nCity  and  Dong  Nai  Province  (the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway)  the  incidence  of  poverty  fell  by  32  percentage  points \nbetween 1993 and 2004. By 2004, poverty in the southeast region was only 5%. \n \nHowever, some pockets of poverty can be  found along the northern projects in rural and mountainous areas. In Bac Giang \nprovince (Lang Giang, Viet Yen, and Yen Dung districts), the incidence of poverty is between 16% and 23.5%. In Lang Son \nprovince  (Huu  Lung,  Cao  Loc,  and  Chi  Lang  districts),  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  between  18%  and  27%.  In  Quang  Ninh \nprovince (Hai Ha, Dam Ha, and Tien Yen districts), the incidence of poverty is above 20%; while in the mountainous Ba Che \ndistrict,  half  of  the  population  is  living  below  the  poverty  line.  For  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway,  all  the  districts \ncrossed have an incidence of poverty below 10%. \n \nIt is important to note that the road network has been considerably improved in all the project areas during the last 10 years.  \n \nBetween Ha Noi and Lang Son, National Highway No.1 (NH1) has been improved in 2001 under an ADB-financed project.b \nNH1 follows mainly a new alignment. The new NH1 has reduced the travel time from the border to Ha Noi from 5.5 hours to \n2.5 hours.  In  addition,  the  rural  road  component  of  the  project  was  designed  to  improve  600  kilometers  (km)  of  selected \nprovincial  and  district  roads,  in  particular  in  Bac  Giang  and  Lang  Son  provinces.  Therefore,  the  proposed  Project  will  have \nlimited  impact  on  poverty  reduction  in  Bac  Giang  and  Lang  Son  provinces  in  comparison  with  the  impacts,  due  to  the \nrehabilitation of NH1 and the improvement of rural roads.  \n \nIn Quang Ninh province, National Highway No.18 (NH18) from Cam Pha to Mong Cai has also been rehabilitated. However, \nNH18 is in constant need of repairs due to heavy vehicle traffic and also suffers from poor design standards imposed by the \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ntopography  of  the  area  through  which  it  passes.  According  to  the  Government\u2019s  prefeasibility  study,c  the  three  proposed \nalignment options  will have positive impacts on poverty reduction, especially in the poor mountainous districts (Ba Che and \nTien Yen districts in particular). The linking of these districts to the future expressway should be carefully studied during the \nTA Loan Project, whatever the alignment option chosen.  \n \nFor  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway  Project,  the  project  area  is  already  served  by  a  good  highway  and  even \nexpressway  network.  In  addition,  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  under  10%  in  all  the  districts  crossed  by  the  proposed \nexpressway. Given the generally low rates of poverty in the project area, the proposed project will have very limited impact on \npoverty reduction in the project locations. The improvement of infrastructure will increase investment, growth of industry, and \ncommerce in the project provinces. Through this economic growth, it is anticipated that employment opportunities of the poor \nin the project provinces could be increased. \n \n2. Design Features.  \nThe expressways will have auxiliary facilities, such as bus stops and service areas (michi-no-eki), that the local people living \nalong the expressways could use. The project design study will include site selection and detailed designs of these facilities. \nOther  opportunities  for  pro-poor  design,  such  as  employment  generation  during  constriction,  will  be  explored  during \nimplementation of the TA Loan Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nProfile of the Beneficiaries \nFor  a  major  highway  project,  there  are  no  beneficiaries  specifically  targeted  at  the  community  level.  The  project  is  for  the \nbenefit  of  the  wider  society  through  the  contacts,  goods,  services,  and  mobility  which  it  provides.  Its  social  and  economic \nimpacts, furthermore, are diffuse and cannot always be anticipated or controlled. As indicated above, the three project areas \n(in particular GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressways) benefit now from good rural road, highway, \nand expressway networks, which have considerably improved the living standards of the local population.  \n \nFor the three expressway projects, benefits will be found mainly at the regional and national levels, rather than the local level, \nexcept in Quang Ninh province where the proposed GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway will contribute to the development \nof some remote areas.  \n \nThe profile of beneficiaries for the three expressway projects is currently unknown; it will depend upon the option chosen for \nthe  different  projects.  The  profile  of  primary  and  secondary  beneficiaries,  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  and  their  needs, \ndemands,  constraints,  and  capacity  will  have  to  be  identified  during  the  implementation  of  the  TA  Loan  Project.  The \nsocioeconomic profile of the population disaggregated by ethnicity and gender in the project area will be prepared as well as \nthe social impact analysis along with the resettlement impact.   \n  \nEthnic Minorities \nThe presence of various ethnic minority groups is one of the main characteristics, especially for the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son \nExpressway  Project,  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  for  the  GMS  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai  Expressway  Project.  For  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long \nThanh Expressway Project, few ethnic minorities are present. \n \nEthnic minority groups account for a large part of the population in the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway Project area. The \nthree  main  ethnic  groups  present  in  the  project  area  are  the  Nung,  the  Tay,  and  the  Kinh  (major  ethnicity  in  Viet  Nam).  In \nLang  Son  province,  ethnic  minority  groups  account  for  86%  of  the  population,  and  in  Bac  Giang  province,  they  account  for \n26%. In Lang Son province, the Nung account for 43% of the total population, the Tay 36%, and the Kinh 17%. Due to the \nlarge  majority  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area,  ethnic  minorities  are  found  everywhere  (urban  areas,  valleys,  and \nmountains).  The  Kinh,  however,  are  concentrated  on  the  plains  and  in  urban  areas.  Ethnic  minorities  are  involved  in  all \neconomic activities in the project area, and along the project corridor; there is no economic difference between Kinh and non-\nKinh.  \n\nFor the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project, the major ethnic groups, the Kinh account for 95% of the population in \nQuang Ninh province, and the percentage of the ethnic minority groups is only 5%. However in some of the districts crossed \nby the different project options, the percentage of ethnic minority groups is much higher. The mountainous Ba Che district has \nby far the highest percentage (nearly 75%) of its population belonging to ethnic minority groups. Tien Yen district has also a \nhigh percentage (42%) of population belonging to ethnic minority groups. This district is crossed by the three options. Poverty \nis also more prevalent among ethnic minority groups than the Kinh majority. For the whole province, the incidence of poverty \nis 7.2% among the entire population but reaches 28.5% among the ethnic minority population.  \n\nFew ethnic minority groups are present in the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project area where they represent less than \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12       57   \n\n \n\n1% of the population of the affected districts. In addition, the Hoa, the main ethnic group present in the project area, usually \nhave a better living standard than that of other ethnic minorities.  \n\nDuring the implementation of the TA Loan Project, the resettlement and other related impacts of the Project will be assessed \nfor  the  three  expressways.  Accordingly,  the  ethnic  minority  development  plan  or  ethnic  minority  specific  actions  will  be \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nAffected Persons \nAccording to the Government\u2019s prefeasibility studies, the proposed projects involve the construction of four to six lanes for the \nGMS  Ha Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai  Expressways  and  up  to  eight  lanes  for  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh \nExpressway. The total lengths will be about 120 km for the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway and the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong \nCai Expressway and about 60 km for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway.  \n\nTherefore,  the  three  expressway  projects  will  require  considerable  land  acquisition:  around  250  hectares  (ha)  of  mainly \nagricultural  and  forestry  land  for  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  Expressway;  290\u2013320  ha  of  mainly  forestry  and  aquaculture \nponds for the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway, according to the option chosen; and 710 ha of mainly agricultural and \naquaculture ponds for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway. Residential land will also be affected in all projects. \n\nThe  number  of  affected  households  is  currently  unknown  but  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  1,000  for  each  of  the  three \nexpressway  projects.  For  the  three  expressway  projects,  resettlement  should  be  under  category  A,  and  a  full  resettlement \nplan will have to be conducted for each project. \n \nHIV/AIDS \n\nThe  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai  expressway  projects  will  increase  the  inter-border  traffic  between  the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) and Viet Nam, which could also increase the risk of the spread of HIV. As in border areas \nbetween  many  countries,  AIDS  prevention  and  control  is  challenging,  in  part  due  to  high  mobility.  According  to  a \nnongovernment organization (NGO) report,d Lang Son province is reported to have one of the highest rates of HIV prevalence \n(1.4%) in the country after Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). The risk of HIV transmission in the border \nareas of Lang Son province is likely to remain high in the coming years because HIV transmission occurs not only among the \ncommercial sex workers and intravenous drug users but also among clients and the general population. Quang Ninh province \nhas the third-highest number of people living with AIDS in the country.  \n \nThe  situation  for  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway  Project  is  different.  Even  if  HCMC  has  the  highest  HIV  rate  in  the \ncountry, the two districts belonging to HCMC which are crossed by the expressway are rural districts with slow urbanization \nand industrialization and with few AIDS cases. This expressway will also not create new pathway for diseases as it is mainly a \nring road around HCMC. \n \nHuman Trafficking \nLang  Son  and  Mong  Cai  are  two  important  gateways  for  human  trafficking  (especially  women)  between  Viet  Nam  and  the \nPRC. According to a survey by Save the Children UK and the Youth Research Institute,e poverty was the major factor leading \nto human trafficking, as persons seeking opportunities for higher-paying work outside of their home provinces are vulnerable \nto  being  deceived  into  trafficking  situations.  Other  factors  contributing  to  the  problem  include  lack  of  education  and  low \nawareness  among  women  of  the  dangers.  Many  victims  of  trafficking  were  single  women  who  legitimately  wished  to  get \nmarried,  while  many  Chinese  men  are  bachelors  seeking  wives.  The  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai \nExpressways  will  increase  the  inter-border  traffic  between  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam.  An  awareness  campaign  should  be \nconducted among the population. NGOs such as Save the Children UK should be associated with this campaign. \n \nThe Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway is quite a distance from the border area; however, the economic growth as a result of \nthe expressway will increase migration in the project area. The migrant laborer may face risk of human trafficking.  \n \nThe  social  analysis  will  include  the  risks  of  the  spread  of  HIV  and  potential  increase  in  human  trafficking  for  all  the  three \nexpressways projects. Assessment of HIV and human trafficking  will include (i) the current prevalence  of HIV in the project \narea; (ii) the type and level of vulnerability of the population along the proposed expressway to HIV (disaggregated by gender, \nethnicity, age, type of occupation, mobility, etc.); (iii) current human trafficking situation and the potential increase in human \ntrafficking  as  well  as  increase  in  migration  in  and  out  of  the  project  areas;  (iii)  review  of  provincial  plans  and  activities  on \nHIV/AIDS and  human trafficking; (iv) review  of existing programs of donors and nongovernment organizations  on HIV/AIDS \nand  human  trafficking;  (vi)  recommendations  for  activities  related  to  provincial  plans  and  links  with  other  development \npartners\u2019 programs for preventing and mitigating the impacts; and (vii) assessment of the capacity-building training needs of \nrelevant agencies for anti-HIV/AIDS. An HIV/AIDS awareness and human trafficking prevention program in the construction \nsites and the towns and villages along the expressways will be prepared for the investment loans. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe  consultation  and  participation  process  and  the  stakeholder  analysis  for  each  expressway  project  will  be  undertaken \nduring the implementation stage of the TA Loan Project. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nThe  general  alignments  of  the  three  expressways  will  be  proposed  through  initial  engineering,  social,  and  environmental \nsurveys  made  by  consultants  to  be  engaged  under  the  associated  TA  projects.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  the  Vietnam \nExpressway  Corporation  will  have  consultation  meetings  on  the  general  alignments  with  the  project  stakeholders  including \nrepresentatives from the project provinces, districts, and communes. \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \nAccording to the Vietnam Country Gender Assessment,f Viet Nam holds a reputation throughout the region for relative gender \nequality  and  has  been  able  to  close  gender  gaps  in  areas  such  as  education,  access  to  health  care,  and  some  aspects  of \nemployment.  Where  the  benefits  are  not  reaching  all,  gender  equality  issues  are  often  amplified  by  factors  such  as  age, \nethnicity, and regional differences, especially between rural and urban areas. \n \nThe  socioeconomic  profile  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender,  as  well  as  social  and  resettlement-related  impact  on  men  and \nwomen will be analyzed. The HIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention program will have specific focus on women. There \ncould be risk of human trafficking of women and children as part of increased migration because of economic growth in the \nproject  provinces.  Gender  analysis  will  be  part  of  the  social  assessment,  and  it  will  be  done  for  each  expressway  project \nduring implementation stage of the TA Loan Project. Focused initiatives may be needed in the three project areas to target \npoor women, and vulnerable women groups and geographic areas. \n \n2.  Key  Actions.
