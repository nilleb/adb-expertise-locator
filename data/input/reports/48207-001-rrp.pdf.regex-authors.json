THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Financial Market Development and Inclusion Program, and (ii) a \nproposed policy-based loan to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of the Financial \nMarket Development and Inclusion Program (FMDIP).1 \n \n2.  FMDIP  supports  the  government\u2019s  key  reform  priorities  in  the  financial  sector  and \nrepresents the start of a medium to long-term partnership between the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), the government, and the country\u2019s newly formed independent unified financial sector \nregulator, the Financial Services Authority (OJK). The government\u2019s priority areas include the \nOJK implementing its supervisory mandate over the bank and nonbank sector and promoting \nfinancial system stability; deepening the capital market and the nonbank financial sector to \nprovide efficient means for the private sector to raise capital, including infrastructure financing; \nand  promoting  access  to  financial  services  by  poor  households  to  address  rising  income \ninequality in Indonesia.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development problems. The Indonesian economy is at a crossroads. Economic growth \nhas steadily declined from 6.4% in 2010 to 4.7% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2015 and is \nprojected to grow at 5.0% in 2015, thereby underperforming its regional peers.2 This is mainly \nbecause the commodity price boom ended and macro policies were tightened to lower inflation, \ncurb the  current  account  deficit,  and  stabilize  the rupiah  exchange rate.3 The  economy  is \nexpected to pick up and grow at 5.6% in 2016, which is in line with Indonesia's estimated \npotential economic growth rate in the 5.0% range (footnote 2)4 While the sharp decline in \ncommodity prices is most likely cyclical, it has exposed structural weaknesses in the economy \nincluding  the  low  competitiveness  of  the  real  sector  and  inadequate  investments  in \ninfrastructure. Indonesia needs new sources of growth to meet its ambitious economic growth \ntarget  of  8.0%  by  2019.  This  requires  acceleration  in  public  and  private  infrastructure \ninvestments  to  improve  the  competitiveness  of  the  economy,  improvement  in  investment \nclimate, and increase in productivity. \n \n4.  Against  this  backdrop  of  slower  economic  growth  and  structural  adjustment,  the \ngovernment is also challenged by a significant rise in household income inequality. Since 2010, \nIndonesia has experienced one of the largest increases in inequality of all Southeast Asian \neconomies. The Gini index, which represents income distribution, and is commonly used to \nmeasure inequality, increased from 0.38 in 2010 to 0.41 in 2013.5 A sizeable share of the \npopulation is excluded from the financial system, which deprives the poor of opportunities to \nraise incomes through savings and pensions, and to mitigate financial risks arising from natural \ndisasters and economic shocks. With these development problems, a deep, liquid and efficient \nfinancial market is critical for promoting financial stability, new sources of economic growth, and \nfinancial inclusion.  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB. 2015. Asian Development Outlook 2015 Supplement. Manila \n3  Bank Indonesia increased BI rates to 7.75% in November 2014 after inflation peaked to above 8%.  \n4  International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  Statistics are based on the Government of Indonesia\u2019s Statistics Office http://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/ \nid/946 (accessed 20 July 2015). ", "2 \n5.  Vulnerability to external financial shocks. Indonesia has an open capital account, \nforeign holdings of bonds and equities are relatively large with above 35% for local currency \ngovernment bonds. This makes the market vulnerable to the risk of sudden capital outflows.  \nIndonesia has experienced sharp reversals in capital flows from external shocks. For example, \nin June 2013, there was a capital outflow of IDR15.76 trillion in the bond market with foreign \ninvestors as net sellers. The price of credit default swap (CDS) increased by almost 60 basis \npoints (bps) from the beginning of April to end of July 2013. This instability resulted in higher \ncost of borrowing as the 10-year government bond yield increased by 225 bps during the same \nperiod  whereas  the  bond  markets  of  Malaysia  and  the  Philippines,  where  economic \nfundamentals are stronger, have shown smaller increases in bond yields.6 As of July 2015, \nIndonesia\u2019s  5-year  CDS  spread  of  government  bonds  is  at  170  basis  points  per  annum \ncompared with 90\u2013130 basis points for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.7 Indonesia\u2019s \nhigher financial system risks transmit to higher cost of borrowing for domestic investors. \n \n6.  Underdeveloped  financial  sector  and shallow capital market. Indonesia\u2019s financial \nsector remains small compared with its regional peers. In 2013, financial sector assets (bank \ncredit, market capitalization, and bonds) represented 103% to gross domestic product (GDP) \ncompared with about 194% for the Philippines, and over 300% of GDP for Malaysia, Singapore, \nand Thailand. Moreover, financial sector assets to GDP has remained relatively constant in \nIndonesia since 2010 indicating that financial sector deepening remains a challenge since the \nend of the global financial crisis (Figure 1). In the equity market, although the number of listed \ncompanies in the stock market increased to 506 in 2014 from 440 in 2011, market capitalization \nas a percentage of GDP in 2014 is below 50%, whereas Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) comparators all exceeded 90% of their respective GDPs.  \n \nFigure 1:  Financial Sector Assets to Gross Domestic Product  \n                  A.

Key Indicators for \nAsia and the Pacific 2014. Manila. \n \n7.  In debt securities markets, illiquidity is the major problem. The government bond market \nrepresents only 13% of GDP, compared with an East Asian average of 58%. Turnover in the \nmarket is low, and bid-ask spreads have been steadily widening in recent years. At 50 basis \npoints, they are now very high by East Asian standards. Corporate bond markets face similar \nproblems. The market represents just 2% of GDP, compared with an East Asian average of \n21%, and the implied illiquidity is adversely affecting pricing. Recent issues at the popular three-\n                                                \n6  ADB.2013.Asia Bond Monitor September 2013.

Given that \nonly high quality issuers are able to tap the market, this is a significant margin. The key \nchallenge in this area is to create a more liquid and lower cost capital market. \n \n8.  Financial  exclusion  of  the  poor. Financial exclusion is a development problem in \nIndonesia, related to an underdeveloped financial sector.  Only 21.9% of the poorest 40.0% of \nthe Indonesian population has savings at a financial institution. Furthermore, over 40% of the \npopulation does not borrow, with only 13.1% having borrowed from a financial institution.8 From \nthose who do not borrow, 60% said they are not considered creditworthy. This suggests that the \nfinancial services provided may not be suitable for all segments of society. In addition, while a \nsizeable percentage of those who do not save cited lack of resources and employment as \ncontributing factors, 7% said they either do not understand financial services or see no benefit in \nit. Promoting financial inclusion is an opportunity to address this development problem, as \nincreasing basic savings and investments\u2014especially among the poorest population\u2014can raise \nincome levels and reduce gaps in income distribution.  \n \n9.  Binding constraints. Several key factors act as binding constraints to the development \nproblems outlined above. For financial stability, a recurring challenge has been establishing \neffective coordination between the government and regulators, and among financial sector \nregulators. This impaired information sharing, and deterred quick and coordinated action to \naddress financial stability issues. The establishment of the OJK is intended to address these \ncoordination and capacity constraints. However, the organization and supervisory approach of \nOJK mirrors that of the former regulators. In addition, the capacity of the regulators of each \nsector is uneven, which complicates leveraging cross-sector knowledge and adopting a fully \nintegrated approach to supervision. For financial sector development, one of the major binding \nconstraints  is  the  lack  of  an  enabling  environment  that  is  conducive  to  financial  sector \ndevelopment. This  includes  challenges  in  adopting  international  standards,  and the  limited \ndiversity of saving and capital market instruments, including for hedging and market making. For \nincreasing financial inclusion, key constraints include the low access to financial services, low \nlevel of financial literacy, and weak consumer protection. \n \n10.  National  Medium  Term  Development  Plan,  2015\u20132019.  The  government  has  set \ntargets  of  8.0%  GDP  growth  and  a  reduction  in  poverty  to  7.0%\u20138.0%  by  2019.9 The \ngovernment recognizes that promoting financial stability, financial market development, and \nimproving access to financial services for the poor, are integral to meet these targets. The \ngovernment targets the size of the financial sector growing by 10.4% per annum by 2019 \ncompared with 8.2% in 2014. The government also aims to provide access to financial services \nto 25% of the poorest 40% of the population by 2019. The government\u2019s strategy consists of a \nseries of reforms\u2014starting with implementing OJK\u2019s mandate as an independent and unified \nregulator,  preparing  crisis  management  protocols  as  prerequisites  for  anchoring  financial \nstability,  followed  by  measures  to  develop  the  capital  markets,  and  a  stronger  focus  on \nimproving financial inclusion. ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016, is consistent \nand aligned with the government\u2019s medium-term development plan.10 \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s  value  added  in  financial  sector  development.  ADB  has  had  long-term \nengagement with the government on financial sector development. It has undertaken six major \n                                                \n8  Statistics are based on the 2014 Global Financial Inclusion Database, which can be compared over a time series. \nOther surveys may have different numbers depending on the methodology adopted.  \n9  Badan  Pengawasan  Keuangan  Dan  Pembangunan.

One of the most significant \nfinancial sector reforms has been the creation of OJK as a unified and independent regulator. \nAlthough there is no consensus on the regulatory model that works best for financial sector \nregulators, in Indonesia, a unified and independent regulatory model improves coordination, \npromotes information sharing, and results in less political pressures. The establishment of OJK \ncan be traced to 1999 when, following policy dialogue between the government and ADB, \nParliament passed the Banking Law to insulate the regulatory and supervisory framework from \npolitical interference. In 2000, the government asked ADB to support the development of a \nblueprint for an integrated financial services supervisory institution. ADB responded with the \nFinancial  Governance  and  Social  Security  Reform  Program  of  2002,  supporting  the \nimplementation of nonbank financial sector reform, establishing OJK and amending relevant \nlaws and regulations.11 This was followed by ADB\u2019s capital market development program and \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant in 2007, which focused on strengthening market surveillance \nand investor protection.  Due to the 1997\u20131999 financial crisis and concerns about the transition \nfrom several regulators into one, the Parliament postponed the establishment of OJK from 2002 \nto 2010.  \n \n \n    Figure 2:  ADB\u2019s Long-Term Engagement with the Government on  \n    Financial Sector Development, 2002\u20132019 \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FMDIP = Financial Market Development and Inclusion Program , \n  NBFI = nonbank financial institution, OJK = Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (Financial Services Authority).   \n  Source:  Asian Development Bank. \n \n12.  The OJK Law was enacted in 2011, and OJK started implementing its mandate to \nregulate the capital market and nonbank financial institutions in December 2012. The initial \nfocus on the capital market and nonbank financial institutions was supported by ADB\u2019s Financial \nMarket Development and Integration Program, approved in 2012, and associated TA projects.12 \nThe  post  program  partnership  framework  of  the  program  provided  ADB  with  a  structured \ndialogue from 2012 to 2015 that also helped inform the design of FMDIP. Through FMDIP, ADB \nwill focus on supporting (i) OJK to implement its mandate including developing the technical and \nregulatory capacities for an independent and unified regulator and (ii) government to develop \nand coordinate financial sector policies including on financial inclusion through the Center for \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "5 \nFinancial Sector Policies. Lessons learned from ADB\u2019s previous operations  include (i) financial \nmarket  development  is  complex  and  involves  major  changes  to  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework, institutional arrangements, and human capacity, hence has to be charted through a \nmedium  to  long-term  strategy;  (ii)  financial  sector  supervision  requires  strong  coordination \nbetween regulator and government and is best achieved through consensus building and an \nagreed financial sector master plan; and (iii) while capital market development has an indirect \nlink to growth, this needs to be coupled with reforms to increase access to financial services \nincluding through services such as branchless banking to improve financial inclusion for the \npoor.13 Recognizing these challenges, ADB coordinates with development partners including the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Coordination for FMDIP is based on the \ngovernment\u2019s  process  through  the  Center  for  Financial  Sector  Policies.  ADB  provides  TA \nsupport  to  the  Center  together  with  the  Australia  Indonesia  Partnership  for  Economic \nGovernance, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.  \n \n13.  Policy-based  loan  approach  and  budget  support.  The  proposed  programmatic \napproach and policy-based loan are selected over other financing modalities to chronologically \nsequence packaging of policy reforms, in a coherent yet flexible framework. This allows ADB to \nsupport and sustain the government\u2019s reform efforts including to improve financial inclusion in a \nsequential manner based on targets in its medium-term development plan.  \n \n14.  Key Features of FMDIP. The program has three outputs critical to develop the financial \nsector and promote financial inclusion: (i) regulatory structure for financial stability strengthened, \n(ii) financial market deepened, and (iii) access to financial services enhanced. FMDIP consist of \nthree subprograms which will see ADB partnering with the government and OJK up to 2019. \nThe focus of each subprogram is based on the government\u2019s priorities\u2014subprogram 1 focuses \non  OJK\u2019s  supervisory  mandate  and  increasing  its  capacities  to  function  effectively  as  an \nintegrated financial services regulator as a prerequisite for financial stability and financial market \ndevelopment, while subprograms 2 and 3 will increasingly focus on financial inclusion reforms. \nOJK has developed the National Strategy on Financial Literacy, which will be updated in 2016, \nand the government is finalizing the National Strategy on Financial Inclusion. ADB is also \nsupporting OJK to complete a sector assessment on micro-finance. These strategies will be \nimplemented during subprogram 2 (2015\u20132017). The program\u2019s three outputs are expected to \nhave  positive,  economy-wide  effects  including  by  reducing  cost  of  borrowed  capital  and \ngenerating  wealth  for  those  excluded  from  the  financial  sector  (para  30).  A  capacity \ndevelopment national TA to support OJK and the government is being processed in parallel with \nthe program. This support is supplemented by ADB\u2019s regional TA on ASEAN capital market \nintegration, which integrates regional collaboration and considerations into national financial \nsector development.14 \n  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The  impact  of  FMDIP  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  national  medium-term \ndevelopment plan and will contribute to increased growth rate of the size of the financial sector. \nThe outcome of FMDIP will be increased development and inclusiveness of the financial sector, \nmeasured by increase in the size of financial assets to GDP by 12 percentage points, increased \naccess to financial services for the poorest 40% of the population from 21.9% to 25.0%, and a \nreduction in 5-year credit default swap spreads by 20 basis points. \n                                                \n13 Additional lessons learned provided in Assessment of ADB-Indonesia\u2019s Financial Sector Programs (2002-2014), \naccessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n14 ADB. 2015.Technical Assistance Report,  Enhancing ASEAN Capital Market Integration. Manila. \n ", "6 \nC.  Outputs  \n \n16.  Subprogram 1 supports the government\u2019s effort to develop the financial sector through \nthe following outputs: (i) regulatory structure for financial stability strengthened; (ii) financial \nmarket  deepened;  and (iii)  access to financial services  enhanced. The government  began \nundertaking  reforms  in  all  three  outputs  from  January  2013,  and  all  23 policy  measures \n(including 12 policy triggers)  required for subprogram 1 have been fully achieved. \n \n1.  Output 1: Regulatory Structure for Financial Stability Strengthened \n \n17.  Subprogram 1 supports the government in (i) establishing OJK\u2019s integrated supervisory \nframework  and  operations,  and  (ii)  strengthening  the  financial  sector  stability  coordination \nmechanism. \n \n18.  Financial Services Authority\u2019s integrated supervisory framework and operations. \nThe OJK took over the banking supervision function from Bank Indonesia on 1 January 2014 \u2014\nthus becoming the unified regulator of all three financial sub-sectors. This transfer of mandate \nwas implemented on a systemic level by leveraging the existing information and communication \ntechnology (ICT) systems, which included migrating Bank Indonesia\u2019s bank supervision ICT \nsystems to OJK premises. ADB supported OJK in this process by providing support for the \ndevelopment and implementation of important ICT applications, including those adopting the \nextensible  Business  Reporting  Language.  OJK  also  approved  an  information  technology \nblueprint as a medium-term strategy to consolidate the regulatory processes of the different \nsectors using ICT systems. In addition, OJK identified priority areas for a consolidated financial \nsector master plan to succeed separate master plans for each sub-sector. Both the government \nand  OJK  also  took  important  steps  to move OJK toward  partial fiscal  independence.  The \ngovernment partially funded OJK during its transition period by allocating Rp2.4 trillion in 2014 \nand approximately Rp1.7 trillion in the 2015 national budget. OJK implemented a web-based \nlevy on financial institutions and collected Rp 1.8 trillion in 2015. OJK intends to rely on fees for \nits operations in 2016 and be fiscally independent.  \n \n19.  Financial  sector  stability  coordination  mechanism.  The  government  and  OJK \nstrengthened the framework for financial stability, by establishing an interagency coordination \nmechanism and developing crisis management protocol in OJK and across government. The \ngovernment, via the Fiscal Policy Agency, established the Center for Financial Sector Policies \nas the government\u2019s main cross-agency coordination mechanism. The government and OJK \nalso implemented a financial stability framework by conducting crisis management protocol tests \nthrough the Financial Sector Stability Forum, which comprises the Ministry of Finance, Bank \nIndonesia, OJK, and the Deposit Insurance Fund. The forum covers surveillance, exchange of \ninformation, and implementation of crisis management protocols.  OJK also approved crisis \nmanagement indicators for each sub sector and implemented banking sector stress tests.  \n \n2.  Output 2: Financial Market Deepened \n \n20.  Development  of  a  deeper  and  diversified  financial  sector  complements  efforts  to \nincrease  stability,  and  provides  long-term  financing  for  needed  infrastructure.  International \nexperience shows that deepening the financial market requires addressing domestic constraints \nbased  on  international best  practice.  Subprogram  1  supports the government  and OJK  in \n(i) adopting international standards, and (ii) enhancing the enabling environment of the sector.  \n \n ", "7 \n21.  International  standards  adopted  by  the  Financial  Services  Authority.  OJK\u2019s \ncommitment to adopt international standards and promote regional integration to deepen its \nfinancial sector is clearly demonstrated by its adoption of both international best practices and \nASEAN  standards.  For  capital  markets,  OJK  completed  all  legal  requirements  and  signed \nAnnex A of the International Organization of Securities Commissions\u2019 Multilateral Memorandum \nof Understanding Concerning Consultation and Cooperation and the Exchange of Information in \n2014. In the same year, OJK joined the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB)\u2014the standard-\nsetting body for Islamic banking, capital market, and takaful (insurance based on Islamic finance \nprinciples) As a sign of its commitment, OJK adopted IFSB 15 (Revised Capital Adequacy \nStandard for Institutions Offering Islamic Financial Services) in June 2015. In ASEAN, OJK has \nbeen an active participant in the initiatives of the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum. To strengthen \nits corporate governance framework for publicly listed companies, OJK adopted the ASEAN \nCorporate Governance Scorecard, launched Indonesia\u2019s Corporate Governance Roadmap for \nPublicly Listed Companies, and issued corporate governance regulations.   \n \n22.  Enabling environment for financial market enhanced. The government improved the \nenabling environment for financial market development by diversifying capital market products \non the supply side and reforming the contractual savings sector (insurance and pension) on the \ndemand  side.  To  increase  market  liquidity,  OJK  introduced  the  global  master  repurchase \nagreement to facilitate market-making and hedging. This is expected to increase market-making \nand allow hedging of capital market instruments. Reforms were also made to diversify capital \nmarket  instruments  through  the  development  of  Islamic  capital  market.  OJK  revised  rules \nregarding the issuance of Islamic capital market products including clarifying the underlying \nassets of sukuk and the use of sukuk proceeds.15 On the demand side, the government enacted \nthe Law on Insurance, 2014, which enhanced policy holder protection, strengthened OJK\u2019s \noversight and range of administrative sanctions.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Access to Financial Services Enhanced \n \n23.  For financial sector development to benefit different segments of society, it must be \naccompanied  by  financial  inclusion  and  literacy  initiatives.  Consumer  protection  is  also \nimportant, as the impact of fraud or misappropriation of funds can be greater on the poor \nbecause  of  their  limited  resources.  Subprogram  1  supports  the  government  and  OJK  in  \n(i) broadening financial inclusion and literacy, and (ii) strengthening consumer protection. \n \n24.  Financial  inclusion  and  literacy  broadened.  The  government  and  OJK  plan  to \ndevelop the financial market for all segments of society, including the poor and disenfranchised \ngroups  of  the  community,  through  a  coordinated  financial  inclusion  and  financial  literacy \nprogram. The government enacted the Law on Microfinance Institutions in 2015, and OJK \nsigned memorandums of understanding with the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of \nCooperatives to coordinate and promote financial services at the national and local level. OJK \nalso launched a branchless banking initiative, which allows registered agents to offer basic \nbanking services to areas without a commercial bank presence. Services covered under this \ninitiative include basic savings accounts, micro-credit, and micro-insurance\u2014targeted at the \nunbanked and those excluded from financial services. OJK has also undertaken key reforms in \nfinancial literacy. It launched the National Strategy on Financial Literacy and rolled out literacy \nprograms in 24 cities in 2014.  \n \n                                                \n15 Sukuk is a capital raising instrument that provides undivided ownership over underlying assets. \n ", "8 \n25.  Consumer  protection  framework  enhanced.  OJK  has  strengthened  investor \nconfidence by enhancing consumer protection mechanisms for retail investors. This is important \nfor market integrity and to encourage more domestic investment. OJK launched the Financial \nCustomer  Care  initiative  in  2014,  which  consists  of  an  information  submission  service, \ninformation request service, and complaint handling service. By the end of 2014, OJK had \nreceived 27,000 requests, with about 10% involving disputes over insurance claims and leasing \ncompany  transactions.  OJK  also  authorized  the  establishment  of  the  Securities  Investor \nProtection Fund, with an initial size of Rp45 billion to provide assurances against investor losses \nresulting from fraud or misappropriation of funds. In February 2015, the total fund size was \nRp93 billion\u2014more than double its original amount. \n \n26.  Triggers for subprograms 2 and 3. ADB has agreed with the government and OJK on \n26  indicative  policy  actions  for  subprogram  2  to  be  completed  by  2017,  including  seven \nindicative triggers considered important to the success of the program. Triggers include the \nlaunch of a consolidated financial sector road map which includes financial inclusion and the \nestablishment of the international learning center for microfinance. Indicative actions have been \nincluded for subprogram 3, and triggers will be identified after OJK\u2019s consolidated financial \nsector road map has been approved. A medium-term framework, which includes anticipated \nachievements, is included in the policy matrix. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n27.  To support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a single-tranche loan of \n$400,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will \nhave a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 12.1 years and no maturity \npremium is payable to ADB. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any advice from ADB. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full \nforeign exchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in \nADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports listed in the negative list attached \nto the loan agreement. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nsimplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for policy-based loans.16 \nThe government has requested for disbursement in the fourth quarter of 2015.  \n \n28.  The size of the program loan is based on (i) the importance of the sector to the economy \nand the weight of the benefits of the reform program, (ii) the need to conform to government\u2019s \nfinancing requirement, and (iii) development expenditure supported by the program. Based on \nthe 2015 revised budget, the government\u2019s net development financing needs are $40.6 billion \n(deficit plus debt and non-debt payments). Overseas development assistance loans contribute \n$3.9 billion to the amount. With a larger deficit expected as a result of slower economic growth \nand continued volatility in the financial market, the government has requested additional budget \nfinancing from development partners. The government has received financing commitment of \n$3.2  billion  from  various  partners.  The  program  supports  reforms,  including  the  budget \nallocation to OJK (para 30).   \n \n                                                \n16  ADB. 1998.

Subprogram 1 covers January 2013\u2013June 2015, subprogram 2 covers July 2015\u2013June \n2017, and subprogram 3 covers July 2017\u2013June 2019. The Fiscal Policy Agency in the Ministry \nof  Finance  (MOF)  is  the  executing  agency  while  OJK  is  the  implementing  agency.  The \nexecuting and implementing agencies are responsible for implementation of FMDIP. The Center \nfor Financial Sector Policies, which has been set up within MOF will monitor the implementation \nof the policy actions under the Policy Matrix. It will coordinate with the International Department \nwithin OJK in undertaking this task. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial  \n \n30.  The program\u2019s three outputs will have positive, economy-wide effects as detailed in the \nProgram Impact Assessment.17 The first involves the modernization of structures for supervising \nfinancial institutions, particularly the formation of the new independent financial regulator. This \nconsolidation, coupled with a stronger commitment to financial stability mechanisms, should \nreduce the cost of borrowed capital by enhancing perceptions of Indonesia\u2019s creditworthiness. \nThe second output aligns Indonesia\u2019s regulations with international standards and improves \ngovernance standards. Capital inflows from abroad will likely become cheaper in each of the \naffected areas, and rising levels of liquidity\u2014particularly in interbank markets\u2014will improve \nbank efficiency and lower borrowing costs. The final output extends gains from financial reform \nto the wider population. The government is targeting higher levels of financial literacy, more \nefficient distribution channels for financial products, and a stronger microfinance sector. The \nbenefits  of  FMDIP  are  estimated  to  be  around  $403  million  per  annum.  $246  million  is \ncalculated to flow from a reduction in the cost of borrowing in the bond markets. A further $65 \nmillion follows from longer run improvements in liquidity management, and $92 million could \nfollow from a greater degree of financial inclusion. Cost of reforms involve the improvement of \nprocesses and systems, as well as incremental spend on headcount. Most fixed costs are \ngenerated in Output 1 and are associated with the creation of OJK estimated at $316 million. \nThe program imposes relatively fewer costs in terms of fiscal redistribution or dislocation of \nexisting enterprises. These estimated benefits relative to the cost of the program demonstrate \nthe value of the reforms under FMDIP. \n \nB.  Governance  \n \n31  Steady progress in strengthening public financial management. The Government \nFinancial Management and Revenue Administration Project, has been under implementation \nsince 2004. The project supports reforms aimed at strengthening efficiency, governance, and \naccountability in public financial management (PFM), especially in budget execution, together \nwith treasury modernization and revenue administration. In addition, the government\u2019s 2012 \nmedium-term strategy note seeks to improve PFM reform oversight, including strengthening the \nprocess of allocating budget resources of priority sectors, linking planning and budgeting, and \nstrengthening the results orientation of the budget. PFM reforms are also increasingly aligned \nwith the priorities identified in Indonesia\u2019s medium-term development plan. \n \n                                                \n17 The anticipated cost and benefit per output is in the Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  Only 21.9% of Indonesia\u2019s poorest 40.0% have access to formal financial services, and \nover 40% of the population does not borrow, with only 13.1% having borrowed from a financial \ninstitution. The program is classified as a general intervention as its proposed outputs will \nbenefit all citizens, including the poor. The program will help to provide more equitable and \ninclusive growth for the economy, and will specifically benefit the poor through the third output \nwhich  enhances  access  to  financial  services.  Subprogram  1  is  classified  as  no  gender \nelements, but the approach is to discuss with the government and OJK to focus on providing \naccess to financial services for women in subprograms 2 and 3.   \n \nD.  Safeguards  \n \n33.  The  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  is  classified  under \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risk and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  The  program  faces  three  main  risks  (i)  capacity  of  government  and  OJK  (high);  \n(ii) macroeconomic stability (medium), and (iii) coordination for financial sector reform (medium). \nMitigation measures include (i) TA to support the Center Financial Sector Policies (The Center) \nand  OJK  supplemented  by  regional  TAs  and  (ii)  coordination  through  the  Center  and \ninternational department of OJK. The risk assessment for FMDIP is medium.18 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n35.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 1 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Financial Market Development and Inclusion \nProgram, and \n(ii)  the loan of $400,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 1 of the \nFinancial  Market  Development  and  Inclusion  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of \n15 years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board.   \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n7 August 2015 \n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Program is aligned with: \nIncreased annual growth rate of financial sector (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019) \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020     \n       \nDevelopment and  a.
