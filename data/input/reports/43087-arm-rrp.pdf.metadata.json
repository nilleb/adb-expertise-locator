The loans \nwill  help  the  Government  of  Armenia  (the  Government)  maintain \nits core public expenditure program. \n \nTargeting classification: General Intervention \nSector  (subsectors):  Multisector  (public  expenditure  and  fiscal \nmanagement, social protection) \nThemes  (subthemes):  Economic  growth,  social  development, \ngovernance (promoting macroeconomic stability, other vulnerable \ngroups) \nLocation impact: National (high) \n \nCategory  C.  No  significant  adverse  environmental  impact  is \nanticipated. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C. \nImpact of indigenous people:  Category C. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected. \n \nAfter  growing  at  an  average  of  13.5%  in  2006\u20132007,  Armenian \neconomy  moderated  with  a  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth of 6.8% in 2008. It declined by 9.7% in the first 4 months of \n2009  and  is  expected  to  decelerate  by  around  9.5%  in  2009. \nRemittances,  which  at  $1.5  billion  accounted  for  13%  of  GDP  in \n2008,  are  projected  to  be  around  30%  less  this  year.  The \nArmenian  dram  (AMD)  has  depreciated  25%  against  the  US \ndollar,  significant  since  70%  of  the  economy  is  dollarized.  The \nGovernment faces a revenue shortfall of 22% and a financing gap \nof  $460  million.  The  fiscal  deficit  is  estimated  to  increase  from \nAMD40  billion  (1.0%  of  GDP),  forecast  in  the  original  2009 \nbudget, to 6.5% of GDP. Unemployment has been increasing and \nis  likely  to  further  rise  sharply.  The  crisis  could  reverse  much  of \nthe gains made by Armenia in reducing its poverty incidence from \n55.1%  in  1999  to  22.7%  in  2008.  Without  fiscal  support,  the \nGovernment  will  be  unable \nits  core  public \nto  maintain \nexpenditures, and recover and sustain growth. \n \n \n\nBorrower \n\nProposal  \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nSocial Safeguards \nAssessment \n\n \nRationale and \nDescription \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nSpecial Features \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nExecuting and \nImplementing Agencies \n\nTranching \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nto  be \n\nfully  used  by \n\nloan  proceeds  are  expected \n\nThe  proposed  Crisis  Recovery  Support  Program  (the  Program) \nwill enable the Government to mitigate the adverse impact of the \nglobal  financial crisis.  The  Program  is  anchored  on  the  Stand-By \nArrangement  (SBA)  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF), \nwhich provides the overall framework for macroeconomic stability \nand  structural  reform.  Further,  the  Government\u2019s  own  crisis \nmitigation  plan  will  be  the  public  expenditure  anchor  for  the \nsupport  from  ADB.  The  Program  has  been  formulated  in  close \nconsultation  with  the  Government  and  after  an  assessment  of \ncrisis impact and fiscal needs. It is part of a well-coordinated and \nconcerted  donor  effort  to  respond  to  the  Government\u2019s  urgent \nrequest for budget support. \n \nThe \n31 December 2009.  \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The \nMinistry of Economy will be the Implementing Agency, responsible \nfor  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  Program  outcome, \noutputs and targets. \n \nThe two loans will be disbursed in a single tranche once they take \neffect. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $80  million  equivalent \nfrom ADF resources. The Program will comprise two loans totaling \n$80  million  equivalent.  The  split  into  two  loans  is  due  to  the \navailability of ADF resources for Armenia. The first loan will be of \n$46.3  million  equivalent  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  with  an  annual  interest  rate  of  1%  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter; a term of 24 years including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and other terms and conditions substantially in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement.  The \nsecond  loan  of  $33.7  million  equivalent  will  be  financed  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  annual  interest  rate  of \n1.6% during the entire term of 24 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years, and other terms and conditions set forth in the program \nloan agreement. \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nof \n\nand \n\nineligible \n\nprocedures \n\ndisbursement \n\nimports,  and \n\nThe foreign currency proceeds from the loans will be used to pay \nfor items procured in ADB member countries, other than the items \nspecified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced from other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nsimplification \nrelated \nrequirements for program loans. Loan proceeds disbursed against \nimports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the  Government  stipulating \nthat  the  value  of  the  total  imports  of  Armenia,  minus  its  imports \nfrom  nonmember  countries, \nimports \nfinanced  under  other  official  development  assistance,  is  at  least \nequal  to  the  amount  of  the  loans  to  be  disbursed  during  a \nparticular year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  local  currency  generated \nfrom \nto  \n(i) compensate  in  part  for  the  large  revenue  shortfall  and  enable \nthe  Government  to  maintain  its  core  public  expenditure  program \n(salaries  and  essential  social  services);  and  (ii)  make  possible \npublic  expenditures  and  investments  that  will  provide  safety  nets \nand create jobs. \n \nThe  Program  will  help  the  Government  cushion  and  mitigate  the \nadverse  impact  of  the  crisis.  It  will  benefit  the  poor  and  support \nefforts  to  protect  the  gains  made  by  the  Government  in  reducing \npoverty. It will enable the Government to \n \n(i) \n\nmaintain  its  core  public  expenditure  program  without  any \nfurther cuts over and above adjustments already made; \nmeet its social safety net spending needs; and \ncreate at least 6,500 new jobs by the end of 2009.  \n\nthe  proceeds  of \n\nis  used  mainly \n\nloans \n\nthe \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n \nRisks: \n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n \n\n \nAssumptions: \n \n(i) \n\nWorsening of the global financial crisis\u2014or its continuation \nfor  a  period  longer  than  anticipated\u2014could  hinder  the \nGovernment\u2019s economic recovery plans. \nAny  political  changes  could  alter  the  Government\u2019s  ability \nto implement anti-crisis measures. \n\nMacroeconomic  reforms  supported  under  the  IMF  SBA \nremain on track \nDevelopment partners provide timely and adequate budget \nsupport and technical assistance. \nAll projects are initiated and completed as planned. \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\nCounterpart Funds \n \n\nBenefits  \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  the  proposed \nprogram  loans  to  the  Republic  of  Armenia  for  the  Crisis  Recovery  Support  Program  (the \nProgram).1  \n\nII. \n\nRECENT MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE  \n\n2. \nPre-Crisis  Economic  Performance.  Armenia  is  a  small,  open  economy  that  relies \nheavily  on  remittances,  foreign  investment,  and  imports.  With  real  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) increasing yearly by an average of more than 10% (Table 1), Armenia has been a stable \nand  strong  performer  in  the  region.  Much  of  the  recent  growth  was  fueled  by  the  construction \nand  mining  sectors.  The  share  of  construction  in  GDP  increased  from  9%  in  2001  to  23%  in \n2008.  Remittances  and  capital  inflows  sustained  the  construction  boom,  while  increasing \ninternational  commodity  prices  helped  the  mining  sector.  Remittances  also  boosted  domestic \nconsumption.  \n \n\nTable 1: Selected Economic Indicators for Armenia \n \n\n2001 \n9.6 \n \n228.7 \n\n10.4 \n50.9 \n\n2002 \n\n13.2 \n \n266.3 \n\n10.8 \n \n\n2003 \n\n14.0 \n874 \n343.8 \n\n10.1 \n42.9 \n\n2004 \n\n10.5 \n \n364.1 \n\n9.6 \n34.6 \n\n2005 \n14.0 \n \n449.9 \n\n8.2 \n29.8 \n\n2006 \n13.2 \n \n533.4 \n\n7.4 \n26.5 \n\n2007 \n13.8 \n \n698.3 \n\n7.0 \n25.0 \n\n2008 \n6.8 \n \n774.5 \n\n6.3 \n22.7 \n\n24,483 \n\n27,324 \n\n34,783 \n\n43,445 \n\n52,060 \n\n62,293 \n\n74,227 \n\n91,539 \n\nItem \nReal GDP growth (%) \nGDP per capita ($) \nGovernment budget \n(AMD billion) \n\nUnemployment rate (%) \nPoverty rate (%) \n(1999 = 56.1) \n\nAverage monthly wage \n(all sectors, AMD) \n\nAverage monthly \n\n4,574 \n\n5,748 \n\n7,452 \n\n8,842 \n\n9,805 \n\n10,912 \n\n12,746 \n\n21,370 \n\n341.8 \n877.3 \n555.1 \n\npension (AMD) \nExports ($ million)  \nImports ($ million) \nAMD/$ \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Asian Development Outlook (GDP estimate); International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2009, 2006) (Table 1) (real \nGDP  growth  actual;  poverty  rate);  IMF  (various)  (Table  5);  National  Statistical  Service  of  the  Republic  of \nArmenia  (Government  incomes  and  official  transfers,  exports,  imports,  unemployment  rate,  poverty  rate \n[except 2001\u20132003, 2008], and exchange rate). \n\n985.1 \n2,191.6 \n416.0 \n\n973.9 \n1,801.7 \n457.7 \n\n1,152.3 \n3,267.8 \n342.1 \n\n1,069.1 \n4,411.7 \n305.8 \n\n685.6 \n1279.5 \n578.8 \n\n722.9 \n1350.7 \n533.5 \n\n505.1 \n987.2 \n573.4 \n\n \nRobust growth boosted government revenues, which in turn led to significant increases \n3. \nin public sector wages, government  pensions,2 and social benefits (transfer payments such as \nfamily allowances and unemployment benefits) (Table 1). Average wages and GDP per capita \nmore than tripled in the past 8 years. Unemployment dropped by 40% (Figure 1), and poverty \nincidence was cut in half (Table 1 and Figure 2).  \n\n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  base  pension  amount  was  increased  by  60%  on  1  January  2008  and  by  13%\u201316%  a  year  later.  The \nunemployment  insurance  benefit  has  been  increased  to  equal  60%  of  the  minimum  consumption  basket.  As  an \nimportant  efficiency  measure,  the  Government  has  acted  to  plug  leaks  in  the  benefit  program  for  poor  families. \nFollowing better integration of household registry data, around 12,000 undeserving families were removed from the \nprogram, thereby saving AMD1.6 billion ($4.4 million).  \n\n\f 2 \n\n)\n\n%\n\n(\ne\nt\na\nR\n\nt\nn\ne\nm\ny\no\np\nm\ne\nn\nU\n\nl\n\n11\n\n10\n\n9 \n\n8 \n\n7 \n\n6 \n\n5 \n\nFigure 1: Armenia Unemployment Rate, 2001\u20132008 \n\n \nFigure 2: Poverty Incidence, 1999\u20132008 \n\n \n\n \n\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nl\nu\np\no\nP\n\n \nf\no\n \ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n1999\n\n2001\n\n2003  2004  2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\nYear \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007\n\n2008 \n\nSource: Government of Armenia. \n\nYear \n\n  Source: Government of Armenia. \n\n \n\n \nModerate  Inflation.  Inflation  accelerated  from  4.4%  in  2007  to  9.0%  in  2008,  or \n4. \nsignificantly above the Government\u2019s target of 4.0% plus or minus 1.5%. In the first half of 2008, \nrecord prices of food and energy were the main culprits. Year-on-year inflation peaked at 11.5% \nin  August  2008  before  moderating  to  5.2%  in  December 2008  and  declining  to  3.1%  in \nApril 2009 year-on-year.  \n \n5. \nStrong Commitment to Reform. Armenia has embarked on an ambitious set of \nreforms, including stimulating competition among enterprises, improvement of the business and \ninvestment  climate,  deepening  of  financial  intermediation,  reform  of  tax  policy  and  tax \nadministration,  public  sector  modernization,  regional  development,  termination  of  poorly \ntargeted  subsidies,3  and  program  budgeting  and  public  financial  management.  Reflecting  the \nprogress  of  reforms  in  some  of  these  areas,  Armenia  was  ranked  44th  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nDoing Business survey of 2009.  \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nIMPACT OF GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS \n\n6. \nArmenia  among  the  Worst-Affected  Countries  in  the  Region.  Armenia  has  felt  the \nimpact of the global economic crisis mainly because of the slowdown in the Russian Federation, \nthe  source  of  more  than  75%  of  remittances  to  Armenia  and  more  than  70%  of  foreign  direct \ninvestment (FDI) in the country. Table 2 presents the medium-term macroeconomic outlook for \nArmenia. Measured in terms of real GDP growth, Armenia has been the worst-affected country \nin the region. \n\n                                                 \n3  The  Government  has  increased  water  and  electricity  rates  and  phased  out  the  gas  subsidy  to  improve  cost \n\nrecovery and reduce poorly targeted subsidies. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \nTable 2: Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook for Armenia, 2008\u20132012 \n(% of GDP, unless noted otherwise) \n\n \nItem \nReal GDP Growth (% change) \nInvestment \nFiscal Balance \nCurrent Account Balance \n(  ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: Fiscal balance excludes grants and external interest payments. \nSource: International Monetary Fund estimates, May 2009. \n\nEstimate \n2008 \n6.8 \n38.1 \n(1.9) \n(12.6) \n\nProjections \n\n2009 \n(9.5) \n33.0 \n(5.5) \n(11.4) \n\n2010 \n1.3 \n33.2 \n(5.8) \n(10.4) \n\n2011 \n6.0 \n34.3 \n(2.6) \n(8.9) \n\n2012 \n6.0 \n34.7 \n(2.5) \n(8.1) \n\n7. \nDrop  in  Remittances.  Remittances  from  migrant  workers,  which  totaled  $1.5 billion  in \n2008 (around 13% of GDP), declined by 32% year-on-year in the first 3 months of 2009 (Figures \n3 and 4), and the reduction is expected to persist throughout 2009. Since most remittances from \nmigrant  workers  are  spent  rather  than  saved,  the  drop  in  remittances  has  directly  and \nsubstantially affected consumption, as reflected in a slump in value-added tax (VAT) revenues, \nthe largest portion of tax revenues. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Change in Amount of Remittances\nCompared to Same Month in Previous Year,\n2008\u20132009 \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Remittances, \nFigure 4: Remittances \n \nQ1 2004\u2013Q1 2009 \n \n(Q1 2004-Q12009) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nM\n$\n\n \n\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n\n \n\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n-10%\n-20%\n-30%\n-40%\n\nApr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr \n2008                                                       2009 \n\n \n\nSource: Central Bank of Armenia. \n\n2008 Q 3\n\n2009 Q 1\n\n2004 Q 1\n\n2004 Q 3\n\n2005 Q 1\n\n2005 Q 3\n\n2006 Q 1\n\n2006 Q 3\n\n2007 Q 1\n\n2007 Q 3\n\n2008 Q 1\n\nSource: Central Bank of Armenia. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n8. \nConstruction  Slowdown.  Construction,  a  major  driving  force  behind  Armenia\u2019s  robust \neconomic growth in recent years, slowed as the demand for apartments and offices weakened. \nSince  most  FDI  was  channeled  into  construction,  the  sharp  falloff  in  FDI  since  April  2008, \ncombined with the reduction in demand, slashed construction activity by 31% in the second half \nof 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, value creation in the sector was down by 22% compared \nwith the same period in 2008. \n \n9. \nWaning  Fortunes  in  Mining.  The  Armenian  mining  sector  has  also  been  seriously \naffected  by the  global  economic  slowdown.

Government  revenues,  which  had  risen  steadily  in  recent  years \n(Table 1), have fallen even more steeply than real GDP. The Government had assumed 9.2% \nGDP  growth  when  projecting  revenues.  In  fact,  revenue  collections  fell  by  16.7%  in  the  first \nquarter of 2009 (compared with the first quarter of 2008). The drop of 20.1% in VAT collections \nand 15.9% in profit tax collections in the first quarter, year-on-year, has been the most extreme. \n\n    Source: Government of Armenia. \n\n-9.7 \n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5 \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nThe Government now expects revenue collections to be 13%\u201315% lower in 2009 than in 2008, \nmissing the budget target by around 28%. \n \n12. \nLarge Budget Deficit and Financing Gap. Barring an unexpected, rapid reversal of the \nsharp  deterioration  in  the  economy  and  in  tax  revenues  since  last  quarter  of    2008,  it  is  clear \nthat the Government budget deficit for 2009 will far exceed the AMD40 billion ($105 million; 1% \nof GDP) forecast when the budget was adopted by Parliament in November 2008. As forecast \nby  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  9.5%  decline  in  GDP,  with  government  revenues \ndeclining  by  6.7%  year-on-year  from  2008  to  2009  with  corresponding  adjustments  in \nexpenditure would increase the budget deficit to AMD217 billion ($564 million), or 6.5% of GDP, \nand create a financing gap of $460 million (Table 3). The budget deficit and the corresponding \nfinancing  gap  would  be  significantly  larger  if  the  revenues  were  to  decline  further  and \nexpenditure suspensions were not made by the Government.  \n \n\nTable 3:  2009 Budget Scenarios \n(AMD billion) \n \n\nPost-Crisis Revisions a \n\n40 \n  0               \n\n                     682  \n                     919  \n                       50  \n                       30  \n                     899  \n                   (217) \n\nApproved Budget \n             879  \n             919  \n \n \n \n             (40)  \n\n Item \nRevenues and Grants (2008 estimate = 731) (A) \nExpenditures (2008 estimate = 793) \n   Less Suspensions (Non-critical) \n   Plus Additional Expenditure \nNet Expenditure (B) \nBudget Deficit  (C) = A-B  \n   Less:  Adjustments (net of domestic and  \n   external financing) (D) \nFinancing Gap = [C]-[D] \n \nMemorandum Items \nGDP Growth \nGDP (2008 estimate = 3,646) \nBudget Deficit/GDP (%) \nRevenue Shortfall against Target (%) \n \nRevenues ($ million) \nExpenditures ($million) \nBudget Deficit ($ million) \nFinancing Gap ($ million) \nExchange Rate against dollar \n(  ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \na  Revenues decline by 6.7% year-on-year.

As the financial crisis deepens \nunemployment,  poverty  will  intensify  because  unemployment  allowances  benefit  only  the \neligible unemployed in the short term and only partly replace lost income from employment. The \nslump  in  remittances,  on  which  many  families  depend  particularly  for  consumption,  will  also \ncause poverty to worsen. If GDP were to contract by 8% and remittances from immediate family \nmembers  by  25%  (and  those  from  other  remittance  senders  by  50%),  211,000  more  people \ncould  fall  below  the  poverty  line,  and  183,000  below  the  extreme  poverty  line,  in  2009.  The \npoverty rate would climb by about 6.5 percentage points in a single year, erasing the gains of \nthe  3  previous  years  (Table  4  and  Figure  7).

In response to the crisis, \nthe  Government  set  up  an  interministerial  crisis  management  committee  under  the  Prime \nMinister to mitigate its impacts at various levels. The Government\u2019s policy framework is outlined \nbelow.  This  includes  the  IMF  SBA,  which  replaced  the  PRGF  and  contains  the  Government\u2019s \nmacroeconomic framework for crisis mitigation. Under the SBA, the Government has committed \nto a range of critical reforms in monetary, exchange rate, and fiscal policies.  \n \n16. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Policy Response to the Crisis \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n \n\nReturn  to  a  Flexible  Exchange  Rate  Regime.  As  the  global  financial  crisis \ndeepened in October 2008, the Government felt it had to intervene in exchange \nrate  policy  to  prevent  a  crisis  of  confidence  from  destabilizing  the  financial \nsystem.  However,  the  maintenance  of  a  soft  peg  led  to  a  large  loss  of \ninternational reserves and significant redollarization without dousing expectations \nof a depreciation of the dram. The Central Bank of Armenia moved to a flexible \nexchange rate in March 2009. \n\nIncrease in Deposit Guarantee Fund Coverage. The authorities are working on \na plan to increase the resources of the Deposit Guarantee Fund. \n\nSupport  for  Macroeconomic  Stability.  The  Government  will  limit  the  overall \nfiscal deficit in 2009 to around 6.5% of GDP, excluding unprogrammed externally \nfinanced  investment  projects.  The  revenue  shortfall  will  be  offset  in  part  by \nrestrained spending and some tax policy measures. \n\nRestrictions on Non-priority Expenditure and Protection for Social Outlays. \nThe  Government  will  suspend  expenditures  in  nonessential  areas  (travel, \nrepresentation) and in areas where execution has been slow. At the same time, \nsocial spending on social protection programs will be protected and increased by \n0.3% of GDP. The Government has also increased the amount of pensions and \nunemployment insurance. \n\nCountercyclical  Public  Investments.  The  Government  will  initiate  public \ninvestment  projects  to  protect  and  create  jobs  from  additional  resources  that \nwould  become  available  from  external  donors  and  partners  on  top  of  what  is \ncurrently projected by the IMF (see Tables 5 and 8). \n\nTax Administration. Tax administration has been restructured and reorganized \non  a  functional  basis  through  the  merger  of  four  specialist  inspectorates  into  a \nsingle  large  taxpayer  inspectorate,  and  the  closure  of  11  tax  inspectorates  (in \nFebruary  2009).  These  measures  will  generate  savings  and  enhance \ncost-effectiveness, while securing a sustainable revenue base for effective post-\ncrisis recovery. \n\nCreation of the State Revenue Committee to Generate Efficiency. The State \nCustoms Service has been merged with the State Tax Service and a new entity, \nthe State Revenue Committee, has been set up. These moves will help improve \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ninformation  sharing  and  administrative  support  functions  such  as  human \nresources and information technology. \n\n \n17. \nAnti-Crisis Action Plan. The interministerial crisis management committee approved a \ncomprehensive  anti-crisis  action  plan  (Table  5)  in  early  December  2008.  The  plan  includes \nmeasures to protect and create jobs by accelerating existing and planned new public investment \nprograms,  and  providing  direct  support  (e.g.,  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  [SMEs]) \nand  indirect  support  (e.g.,  partnerships  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  and  improved \nbusiness climate) to the private sector.5 \n \n\nTable 5: Highlights of the Government\u2019s Anti-Crisis Action Plan \n \n\nMeasure \nTo Address Social and Economic Problems and Job Creation \nConstruction of dwellings totaling $250 million in the earthquake disaster \n\nTime Frame \n \n2009\u20132010 \n\n2009 \n2009 \n\n2009 \n\n2009\u20132014 \n \n2009 \n2009 \n2009 \n\n2009\u20132010 \n2009 \n2008\u20132009 \n\nConstruction of additional school buildings \nImplementation of new agricultural investment programs in partnership with \n\nzone \n\nthe private sector \n\nPreparation of feasibility plan for construction of Meghri\u2013Batumi highway \n\n(North\u2013South Corridor), using resources from ADB  \n\nImplementation of new energy-related projects of regional importance \nTo Support a Healthy Business Environment \nProvision of government guarantees for loans to SMEs \nState participation in the capital of enterprises meeting specified criteria \nDrafting of amendments to competition law to improve competition among \n\neconomic enterprises \n\nTo Make Doing Business in Armenia More Attractive \nEstablishment of an innovation commission and provision of support for the \n\n \n2008\u20132009 \n\ndevelopment of business plans \nStreamlining of tax administration \nEstablishment of free economic zones at Zvartnots and Gyumri airports \nImplementation of rural development programs, including infrastructure, \n\nrehabilitation and development, and public and private sector partnerships, \nwith resources from World Bank, EBRD, and ADB \n\nPan-Armenian Programs in Partnership with the Private Sector \nConstruction of new nuclear power plant  \nPreparation of action plan for construction of Iran\u2013Armenia railroad \nCreation of a pan-Armenian bank \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EBRD  =  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development, \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource: Government of Armenia. \n\n \n2009\u20132017 \n2009 \n2008\u20132009 \n\n \n18. \nthe  Government \nsuspended6  AMD93  billion7  ($244  million)  in  non-critical  expenditures,  or  10%  of  the \n\nSuspension  of  Non-critical  Expenditures. \n\nIn  March  2009, \n\n                                                 \n5 To respond to the social dimensions of the crisis, the Government announced a separate action plan for the social \nsectors in April 2009. The aim is to prevent and mitigate the adverse social impact of the crisis. It also focuses on \ndevelopment of social protection programs to assist in post-conflict recovery.  \n\n6   Suspended expenditures were deferred to the fourth quarter of the year, at which time the Government will decide \nwhether  to  make  them  or  to  seek  Parliamentary  approval  to  cancel  (\u201csequester\u201d)  them.  Many  suspended \nexpenditures  were  for  the  purchase  of  equipment  (vehicles,  computers)  and  other  indirect  costs  (furniture, \ntransport). The Government also suspended capital projects that were planned for 2009 but had not yet begun. In \naddition, most large multiyear construction projects that were under way but would not be completed in 2009 were \nalso suspended.  \n\n7   In  May,  the  amount  of  suspensions  was  reduced  to  AMD50  billion  on  the  strength  of  an  expected  increase  in \n\nresources from the IMF. \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nexpenditures in the 2009 budget. However, the Government announced that no cuts would be \nmade in pensions8 ($470 million), wages ($162 million), or social benefits ($169 million), which \ntogether constitute 32% of the budget expenditure. The critical social benefits to be maintained \nare  (i)  the  family  allowance  for  poor  families;  (ii)  the  unemployment  allowance  for  eligible \nunemployed persons; and (iii) the paid public works program, which provides temporary jobs to \nthe  unemployed.  Details  on  these  benefit  programs  are  given  in  Appendix  3.  Moreover,  the \nGovernment  pledged  to  increase  social  protection  expenditures  by  0.3%  of  GDP.  These \ndecisions reflected the Government\u2019s goal of preserving the gains in poverty reduction that have \nbeen achieved since 2000 (see Table 4, Figure 7).9 \n  \n19. \nRevised Financing Gap and Financing Plan of the Government. Taking into account \nboth the suspension of non-critical expenditures and the introduction of new expenditures under \nthe anti-crisis action plan, the Government now projects a financing gap of $460 million and a \nbudget  deficit  of  6.5%  of  GDP.  The  Government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) to participate with other development partners in filling this financing gap (Table 6). \n \n\nTable 6: Adjusted 2009 Budget and Resources to Fill Financing Gap \n \n\n \nItem \n\nRevenues (6.7% decrease from 2008) \n\nBudgeted Expenditures \n     Less:  Suspensions \n     Plus:  Additional Expenditures \nNet Expenditures \n\nDeficit \n     as % of GDP (9.5% GDP decrease from 2008) \nLess:  Adjustments (Table 3,  net) \nFinancing Gap \n \nFinancing Plan \nAsian Development Bank \nInternational Monetary Fund \nRussian Federation \nWorld Bank \n     Total Committed Financing \nNet Financing Gap \n\n \n\n(  ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: $1 = 385 AMD. \nSource:  Ministry of Finance, Government of Armenia. \n\nAMD \nbillion \n\nUSD \nmillion \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n682 \n\n919 \n(50) \n30 \n899 \n\n \n217 \n  6.5% \n(40) \n \n177 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1,771 \n\n2,387 \n(130) \n78 \n2,335 \n\n564 \n6.5% \n(104) \n460 \n \n \n80 \n155 \n150 \n60 \n445 \n15 \n\n \n\n \n20. \nInternational Donor Support. As part of its anti-crisis action plan, the Government has \nsuccessfully  sought  the  assistance  of  international  development  partners,  as  well  as  bilateral \nassistance. First, it entered into a $544 million SBA with the IMF under which the Government \nwould  take  measures  to  ensure  monetary  and  fiscal  stabilization  (Appendix  4).  Second,  it \n\n                                                 \n8   Information on the Armenian pension system is contained in Appendix 3.  \n9   According to the World Bank, the current crisis could push 172,000 more people below the poverty line in 2009\u2013\n2010, increasing the total number of the poor to about 906,000 (30.5% of the population), of which 297,000 will be \nclassified as extreme poor (World Bank. 2008. Implications of the Global Economic Crisis for Poverty in Armenia. \nWashington,  DC).  \u201cPoverty  simulations  show  that  for  every  percentage  point  reduction  in  the  GDP  growth  rate, \nnational poverty incidence increases by 0.6 percentage points.\u201d (World Bank. 2009.

Fourth, it \nhas obtained preliminary approval for an additional $250 million loan from the IMF, $155 million \nof this expected to be available as budget support in 2009. Fifth, the Government has requested \nan  $80  million  budget  support  loan  from  ADB.  Support  for  Armenia  from  international \ndevelopment  partners  is  summarized  in  Appendix  5,  while  the  financing  arrangement  for  the \nanti-crisis action plan is shown in Tables 6 and 8.  \n \n21. \nDebt  Sustainability  Assessment.  In  connection  with  the  SBA,  the  IMF  completed  a \ndebt  sustainability  assessment  of  Armenia  in  March  2009.  This  assessment  concluded  that \nArmenia  does  not  face  any  significant  risk  of  debt  distress.  All  its  external  debt  indicators  are \nwell  below  appropriate  thresholds,  even  if  the  new  $500  million  loan  from  the  Russian \nFederation is factored in.  \n \n22. \nDebt  Structure.  Armenia\u2019s  external  debt  stock  as  of  the  end  of  2008  was  $2.2  billion \n(18%  of  GDP),  mostly  representing  public  and  publicly  guaranteed  debt  owed  to  multilateral \norganizations.    Outstanding  debts  owed  to  the  World  Bank  account  for  55%  of  total  external \ndebt  stock,  and  those  owed  to  the  IMF  account  for  6%.  Armenia\u2019s  estimated  private  sector \nexternal debt outstanding is about 15% of total external debt. The assessment concluded that \nthe  share  of  domestic  debt  in  the  stock  of  public  and  publicly  guaranteed  debt  was  small,  at \n2.3% of GDP, reflecting the limited development of the domestic debt markets. \n \n23. \nDebt  Outlook.  IMF\u2019s  analysis  shows  that  Armenia\u2019s  debt  outlook  is  relatively  stable, \nthough  authorities  have  been  encouraged  to  follow  a  prudent  borrowing  strategy,  given  the \nincreasing  external  vulnerabilities.  The  baseline  scenario  shows  a  sustainable  fiscal  position, \nwith  the  net  present  value  of  public  sector  debt  gradually  rising  from  9.8%  of  GDP  in  2008  to \n23.6% of GDP in 2028.  The external debt outlook remains benign, despite a notable increase in \nnon-concessional financing over the medium term because of the crisis. The net present value \nof external debt is expected to increase from 7% of GDP in 2008 to 16% of GDP in 2013, and to \ndecline thereafter to about 7% in 2028.  External debt service will increase from 3% of exports \nto 11% over the medium term, but decline relatively quickly to a long-term average of about 3%. \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcomes \n\n24. \nThe  Program  is  intended  to  accelerate  Armenia\u2019s  recovery  from  the  adverse  impact  of \nthe global financial crisis. Its proceeds will be used to support essential public expenditures to \n\n                                                 \n10  In  2009,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  plans  to  assign  \u20ac80  million  to  Armenia \n(compared with \u20ac63 million in 2008). The European Commission released \u20ac3 million in budget support to Armenia \nfrom  the  Food  Security  Programme.  The  World  Bank  has  also  accelerated  the  approval  and  financing  of  certain \nprojects  that  were  already  in  the  pipeline.  These  projects  include  a  $50  million  credit  line  for  the  SME  sector,  a \n$25 million rural road building project, and $10 million in additional funding for small-scale infrastructure and rural \nenterprise projects. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\n25. \n \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nrevive  the  economy,  and  to  protect  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  through  adequate  safety  net \nmeasures. The Program is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy for Armenia.11  \n\nThe Program will have the following main outputs: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nan increase in social protection expenditures, 12 \nnew jobs created through public investment programs,13 and \nno salary or pension arrears.14 \n\nC. \n\nProposed Framework for the Program \n\n26. \nProgram-Based  Modality.  The  Program  has  two  anchors.  First,  the  IMF  SBA  will \nprovide the overall macroeconomic framework. Second, the Government\u2019s own anti-crisis plan \n(Table 4)  will  act  as  the  public  expenditure  anchor.  All  the  structural  benchmarks  for  the  IMF \nprogram  will  automatically  be  prior  actions  for  ADB\u2019s  support.  In  addition,  the  Government\u2019s \nfiscal stimulus and social protection measures will need to be maintained. The Program follows \nADB\u2019s Program Lending Policy, which allows the use of program-based approaches. Given the \nurgent need for fiscal support, the Program will not impose any other policy conditionalities of its \nown. The Government has articulated its anti-crisis efforts in the policy letter addressed to ADB     \n(Appendix 6). The program framework is presented in Table 7.  \n \n\nTable 7: Program Framework\u2014Prior Actions for the ADB Programa \n \n\n  \n\nTime Frame \n\nLow-priority expenditures suspended \n\nPrior Actions  \nADB Program\u2019s Anchor: IMF SBA \nPurpose: Ensuring Macroeconomic Stability \n\u2022  Return to flexible exchange rate regime \n\u2022  Approval of a plan to increase the resources of Deposit Guarantee Fund \nCountercyclical Fiscal Stimulus Measures Adopted b \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Crisis recovery support measures unveiled and implementation begun \nSocial Safety Nets Maintained \n\u2022  Basic pensions and unemployment insurance amounts enhanced  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IMF = International Monetary Fund, SBA = Stand-By Arrangement. \na See section VII (Assurances) for other commitments agreed on with the Government regarding the Program.  \nb Details of countercyclical measures are given in Table 5. \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank  estimates,  based  on  discussions  with  the  Government  of  Armenia  and  the  IMF \n\nMarch 2009 \nJune 2009 \n \nMarch 2009 \nSince December 2008 \n \nJanuary 2009 \n\noffice in Armenia. \n                                                 \n11 ADB operations in Armenia began in 2005. The Economic Report and Interim Operational Strategy for 2006\u20132009 \nfor Armenia  was approved in August 2006. The initial strategic priorities  of ADB\u2019s partnership  with Armenia  were \nacceleration of rural development, promotion of the private sector, and enhancement of regional cooperation.  \n\n12  The  Government  has  a  social  protection  system  with  many  components,  including  family  benefits  for  eligible \ncitizens,  to  reduce  extreme  poverty  and  inequality,  especially  in  small  and  medium  cities  and  rural  areas  of \nArmenia,  where  poverty  is  highest.  The  unemployment  program  is  centered  on:  (i) unemployment  benefits, \n(ii) professional training, (iii) financial support for entrepreneurial activities, (iv) compensation for material expenses \nin  relocation,  (v)  organization  of  paid  public  works,  and  (vi)  partial  wage  compensation  to  employers  for  hiring \nnoncompetitive persons in the labor market. \n\n13  This  would  be  achieved  through  countercyclical  public  expenditure  programs  as  well  as  through  direct  support \n(partnership  between  the  public  and  private  sectors,  and  SME  support)  and  indirect  support  (improved  business \nenvironment) for the private sector. \n\n14  The  Government  has  given  assurances  that  it  will  not  reduce  critical  expenditures\u2014wages  ($162  million)  and \n\npensions and social allowances ($640 million)\u2014which together constitute 32% of the budget. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n27.   Use of the International Monetary Fund Stand-By Arrangement as Overall Anchor. \nThe  SBA  approved  by  the  IMF  (Appendix  4)  provides  the  macroeconomic  foundation  for  the \nProgram. The Program is part of a concerted effort among donors to support the Government\u2019s \ncrisis  mitigation  efforts.  To  meet  the  balance-of-payments  needs  arising  from  the  crisis, \n$240 million from the IMF SBA has already been disbursed to Armenia.  \n \nUse of Program-Based Approach and Full Alignment with the Government\u2019s Own \n28. \nCrisis  Mitigation  Plan.  The  Program  was  prepared  in  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  urgent \nrequest  for  countercyclical  fiscal  support.  It  is  fully  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  own  crisis \nmitigation plan and is an integral part of the financing plan. \n \n29.  \nSupport for Fiscal Stimulus. The Program  was prepared at the Government\u2019s urgent \nrequest for support to cushion the severe impact of the crisis. It will provide budget support to \nenable  the  Government  to  meet  critical  expenditure  needs  expediently.  The  ADB  team \nconsidered various factors before proposing the public expenditure support option. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nFirst,  regardless  of  the  lending  modality,  the  country  needs  resources  to  adopt \nfiscal  stimulus  measures.  Within  ADB\u2019s  modality  of  program  lending,  the \nfinancing support needs to be linked as closely as possible with the reforms that \nare  supported.  In  Armenia,  much  like  in  many  other  countries,  the  shocks  are \nexogenous,  and  their  impact  has  been  quite  severe  despite  the  commendable \nstructural  reforms  that  Armenia  has  implemented  over  the  last  5\u20137  years.  As \nsuch,  it  is  difficult  to  formulate  policy  measures  that  deal  directly  with  the  crisis \nand  that  require  funds  for  implementation.  Restoring  fiscal  and  financial  sector \nstability is one key reform area that is supported under the IMF SBA. \n\nSecond,  at  a  time  of  crisis,  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  are  focused  on  mitigation \nand  social  protection.  While  commitment  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms  may \nnot completely wane, human resources are likely to be stretched. Moreover, it is \ndesirable that the transaction costs of any support provided by donors be kept as \nsmall  as  possible.  In  this  regard,  the  team  considered  several  other  possible \nreform  areas,  including  pension  reform,  regional  development,  and  public \nfinancial management reforms. These, however, are medium-term efforts, which \nwould need significant resources and time for satisfactory execution.  \n\nThird,  ADB  should  add  value  through  its  support.  The  proposed  public \nexpenditure  option  helps  in  that  direction.  It  will  help  reinforce  measures  to \naccelerate macroeconomic recovery. \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan and Use of Program Funds \n\nFinancing  Plan.  The  Government  faces  a  budgetary  financing  gap  of  $460 million \n30. \n(Table 6).15 The proposed Program will comprise two loans totaling $80 million equivalent. The \nfirst loan will be of $46.3 million equivalent, financed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with \nan annual interest rate of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; a term of 24 years \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and other terms and conditions substantially in accordance \n\n                                                 \n15 This does not include the balance-of-payments support needed to shore up the currency and the foreign exchange \n\nresource position. The IMF SBA is responding to that need. \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n \n\nwith those set forth in the loan agreement. The second loan of $33.7 million equivalent will also \nbe  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  annual  interest  rate  of  1.6%  during \nthe entire term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and other terms and conditions \nas  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement.  The  overall  support  was  split  into  two  loans  with  different \nterms  because  of  the  availability  of  ADF  funds  for  Armenia  (and  other  countries).  Funds  from \nIMF,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  Russian  Federation  will  also  be  used  to  fill  the  financing  gap \n(Table 8). \n\n \nTable 8: Armenia Crisis Recovery: Government's Financing Arrangements \n\n \n \nInstitution \n\n \n \nAreas of Focus \n\n \n \nType of Support \nBalance of Payments \n \nQuick-Disbursing Support \n \n \n \n \n\n \nIMF \n\nIMF \nRussian Federation \nWorld Bank \nADBb \n\nCrisis-Related Project Support \nEBRD \n \nWorld Bank \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nMacroeconomic Stability  \n \nMultiple \nAnti-Crisis Action Plan \nCompetitiveness, vulnerability \nMaintenance of core public \nexpenditures, social protection \n \nSME and Project Support \nLifeline Road Improvement Project \nSocial Investment Fund III \nRural Enterprise and Small-scale \nCommercial Agriculture Development \nSME Sector Loan \n\nAmount \nfor 2009 \n(million)  \n\n \n\n$350.0a \n \n$155.0 \n$150.0 \n$60.0 \n$80.0 \n\n \n\u20ac80.0c \n$25.0 \n$8.0 \n$2.0 \n\n \n\n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EBRD  =  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  IMF  = \nInternational Monetary Fund, SME = small- and medium-sized enterprise. \na  The  International  Monetary  Fund  disbursed  $240  million  immediately  upon  approval,  and  another  about \n$110  million  will  be  disbursed  before  the  end  of  2009  subject  to  satisfactory  progress  of  the  Stand-By \nArrangement. \n\nb  In addition to this, ADB will provide project support as part of the normal country program for Armenia. \nc  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development plans to increase its assistance to Armenia to \u20ac180 \nmillion over 2009\u20132010 (compared to \u20ac63 million in 2008). Of this, \u20ac80 million is expected to be available \nin 2009. \n\n$50.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n31. \nProcurement and Withdrawal Procedures. The proceeds of the loans will be used to \npay for items procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the negative \nlist  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  7)  and  imports  financed  from  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources.  The  proceeds  of  the  loans  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  simplification  of \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans.16  Loan  proceeds \ndisbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the  Government  stipulating  that  the \nvalue  of  the  total  imports  of  Armenia,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible \nimports, and imports financed under other official  development assistance, is at least equal to \nthe  amount  of  the  loans  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  a  particular  year.  ADB  reserves  the \nright to audit the use of loan proceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n32. \nUse of Program Funds. The proceeds of the loans will be disbursed as a single tranche \nand  will  be  used  to  meet  needs  under  two  categories:  (i)  partial  compensation  for  the  large \nrevenue  shortfall,  to  enable  the  Government  to  maintain  its  core  public  expenditure  program; \nand  (ii)  public  investments  for  job  creation.

The  funds  provided  under  the  Program  will  be  used  within \n\nG. \n\nAnticorruption, Accounting and Auditing, and Key Fiduciary Aspects \n\n35. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nallegations  of  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To \nsupport  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the \napplicable loan regulations.  \n \n36. \nThe  Government  acknowledges  that  ADB,  consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or \nthrough  its  agents,  any  possible  financial  or  management  impropriety  in  the  conduct  of  the \nProgram. The Government will cooperate fully and ensure that each of its agencies cooperates \nwith any such investigation and extends all necessary assistance, including access to relevant \nbooks and records. \n \n37. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of counterpart funds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe  Government\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government \nwill open a deposit account at the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) to receive all loan proceeds. \nThe account will be managed, operated, and liquidated according to terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nThe  2008  Public  Financial  Management  Performance  Measurement  (PFMPM)17  noted \n38. \nthat, while public resource management in Armenia has improved significantly over the years, \nthere are still weak areas. The PFMPM report gave 23 As and Bs, and 8 Cs and Ds, for the 31 \nindicators.  The  report  on  ADB\u2019s  governance  and  institutional  corruption  risk  assessment \n(GICRA)18 of Armenia in 2008 noted that Armenia needs to strengthen its internal controls and \naudit,  as  well  as  its  procurement  and  anticorruption  systems  (Appendix 8).  Armenia  is \nundertaking  a  number  of  reforms  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  its  public \nfinancial  management.  The  Government  is  improving  internal  audit  and  procurement  systems \nwith assistance from ADB and the World Bank, in line with the recommendations of the GICRA. \nAn overall public sector modernization program is also being implemented by the Government \nwith the assistance of the World Bank. \n \n\n                                                 \n17  Conducted  by  the  Government  of  Armenia  in  2008  with  the  assistance  of  the  World  Bank  and  ADB,  using  the \npublic  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  methodology.

The  social  impact  assessment \ncomponent  will  be  part  of  the  monitoring  exercise  to  help  in  determining \nthe  impact  of  the  Program  on  the  poor  and  to  assist  the  Government  in \ndesigning remedial measures.21  \nFinancial  flows  and  bank  accounts  related  to  regular  and  special  safety \nnet programs. The regular social protection programs of MOLSI and other \ncrisis-related  implementation  arrangements  (e.g.,  for  the  employment \nprogram) will come under this category. The purpose is to ensure, among \nother things, the timely delivery of stimulus support.  \n\nExpenditure  reconciliation, \nexpenditures supported by the Program. \n\nto  produce  account  reconciliation  reports \n\nfor \n\nCompliance  with  international  best-practice  standards  for  internal  controls  and \naudits, to prevent corruption related to expenditures supported by the Program.22 \n\n \n(iv)  Monitoring of procurement or contracting of services related to expenditure areas \n\nsupported by the Program.  \n\n(v) \n\nEstablishment  of  a  complaints  mechanism \nprocurement undertaken for expenditures supported by the Program. \n\nfor  beneficiary  selection  and \n\nH. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n40. \nADB  will  create,  with  the  help  of  the  Government,  through  the  Ministry  of  Economy,  a \nmonitoring and performance evaluation system, which would use the existing processes of the \nGovernment  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  anti-crisis  action  plan.  This  system  will  provide \nsupport in meeting the requirements of the design and monitoring framework of the Program. It \nwill be set up soon after the Program takes effect. ADB will also work with IMF, the World Bank, \nand other development partners in monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Program. \nThe Program will use very specific and measurable targets and indicators to facilitate objective \nassessments of program outputs, outcomes, and impact. \n\n                                                 \n19  This  will  be  done  through  a  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  project,  which  is  being  processed.  With \ncrisis-support programs being planned in Armenia, Georgia, and Tajikistan, the RETA project would help in public \nexpenditure monitoring across the region.  \n\n20 A financial management specialist will be hired to work closely with the Government in executing its crisis budget \n\neffectively. ADB\u2019s support will be closely coordinated with World Bank support. \n\n21 Feedback from a sample of the beneficiaries of the social protection programs will also be obtained as part of the \n\nsocial impact analysis. \n\n22 This covers a key risk identified by the assessments. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nVI. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n41. \nThe Program will help the Government reduce poverty incidence and restore growth to \nits pre-crisis trajectory. It will further support the Government\u2019s initiatives to ensure that the poor \nand  vulnerable  groups,  who  may  be  hit  hardest  by  the  crisis,  are  shielded  from  its  adverse \nimpact.  It  will  help  the  Government  protect  and  create  jobs  while  maintaining  effective  social \nprotection  safety  nets.  It  is  anchored  in  the  IMF  SBA  and  thereby  supports  the  Government\u2019s \nmacroeconomic stabilization and expenditure management plan.  \n \n42. \nthe Government to \n \n\nThe Program will provide specific benefits to stimulate aggregate demand. It will enable \n\n(i) \n\nmaintain  its  core  public  expenditure  program  without  any  cuts,  over  and  above \nadjustments already made; \nmeet social safety net spending needs; and \ncreate at least 6,500 new jobs by the end of 2009. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n \n43. \nRisks. There are two main risks. First, a worsening of the global financial crisis\u2014or its \ncontinuation  for  a  period  longer  than  anticipated\u2014could  hinder  the  Government\u2019s  economic \nrecovery plans. As the proposed Program is within the overall IMF framework, any such adverse \nchanges  in  the  external  economic  circumstances  need  to  be  mitigated  through  corrective \neconomic  policies  as  well  as  external  support.  ADB  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  IMF  and \nother  development  partners  in  responding  to  any  such  shocks.  Second,  any  changes  in  the \npolitical situation may weaken the Government\u2019s ability to implement anti-crisis measures. While \nthis risk is outside of ADB\u2019s control, it is unlikely that any such changes will alter the substance \nand thrust of the anti-crisis plan per se.  \n \n44. \nAssumptions.  It  is  assumed  that  all  partners  will  provide  timely  and  adequate  budget \nsupport and technical assistance. As the Program is anchored on the IMF SBA, it is assumed \nthat all the prior actions and structural benchmarks under the SBA will remain.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government\u2019s long-term vision is presented in detail in the Sustainable Development Program (SDP). Approved in \nOctober 2008, SDP is Armenia\u2019s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II) and has three key goals covering \nthe  period  2009\u20132021  (with  specific  medium-term  targets  for  2009\u20132015):  (i)  reducing  poverty  and  eliminating  extreme \npoverty;  (ii)  ensuring  human  development;  and  (iii)  deepening  economic  growth  and  accelerating  the  development  of \nlagging regions.  \n\nThe SDP builds on the considerable achievements of PRSP I. Armenia\u2019s poverty and extreme poverty rates declined in \n2006  to  26.5%  and  4.1%  of  the  population,  respectively  (from  34.6%  and  6.4%,  respectively,  in  2004).  Inequality  also \ndecreased  to  a  rate  below  the  PRSP I  goal.  Prudent  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  were  instrumental  in  maintaining \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  contributing  to  poverty  reduction.  Real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  by  13.1%  per \nyear  on  average  over  the  period  2003\u20132007,  and  inflation  averaged  3.9%  during  the  same  period,  while  social \nexpenditures increased to 4.7% of GDP, well above the projected PRSP I goal of 3.0%. Increased resources to the social \nsectors  improved  the  access  to  and  quality  of  general  secondary  education,  and  have  led  to  improvements  in  overall \nutilization of  and  geographic  access to basic health services, most notably through the  free provision  of primary health \ncare to the population. \n\nHowever,  economic  diversification  has  been  limited,  with  growth  performance  narrowly  based  on  remittances  and \nconstruction. Export performance has been disappointing, with real growth of less than 2% per annum in 2004\u20132007. The \nrevenue-to-GDP  ratio  grew  to  a  less-than-targeted  14.5%  by  2006,  reflecting  limited  progress  in  reforming  revenue \nadministration, whereas total public spending decreased by 0.7% of GDP in 2003\u20132007. \n\nThe  SDP  shows  that  Armenia  plans  to  continue  its  impressive  gains  in  combating  poverty  and  inequality.  The \nGovernment\u2019s anticipation of good progress, predicated on double-digit economic growth, the increase of labor income, \nprivate  transfers  from  abroad,  pensions,  and  the  increase  in  social  transfers  through  a  well-targeted  social  protection \nprogram, has become uncertain because of the sudden and severe nature of the financial crisis. \n\nThe SDP presents an extensive and in-depth coverage of the macroeconomic framework and of macroeconomic policies. \nProjections that were fully in line with the 2009 annual budget and the medium-term expenditure framework are now in \ndoubt, following a reduction in revenues and a deceleration of the economy.  \n\nIn the health sector, the SDP increased access to and quality of health-care services, and over the medium term, further \ndevelopment  of  the  primary  health-care  system  will  remain  among  the  key  priorities  in  order  to  complete  the \ntransformation to a more efficient, family medicine\u2013based system. In education, public expenditure is projected to reach \n4.5%  of  GDP  by  2021,  as  the  Government  is  committed  to  improving  the  quality  and  accessibility  of  school  education. \nSome of these interventions may have to be postponed to allow for a review of the budget. \n\nPerhaps the most significant new policy in the SDP is the considerable real increase in state pensions. This reflects the \nobjective of providing minimum income security against poverty in old age, and the introduction of a mandatory funded \npension pillar in 2010.a  \n\nThe Country Operations Business Plan 2008\u20132010 envisages support to enhance government effectiveness and help the \nGovernment  implement  its  innovative  governance  reforms  program.  It  also  flags  the  need  to  provide  resources  for  the \nimplementation of the SDP of the Government.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key Issues  \n \nThe Government of Armenia (the Government) has requested support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help \nmitigate the social and economic impact of the global financial crisis. After many years of strong economic performance \npredicated  largely  on  first-generation  reformsb (e.g.,  privatization),  Armenia\u2019s  real  GDP  declined  by  9.7%  in  the  first  \n4 months  of  2009  and  is  forecast  to  decline  by  around  9.5%  in  2009.  Remittances,  which  at  $1.5  billion  accounted  for \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n13% of GDP in 2008, are expected to decline by around 30% in 2009. The Armenian dram (AMD) has depreciated 25% \nagainst  the  US  dollar  and  70%  of  the  economy  is  dollarized.  The  Government  faces  a  revenue  decline  of  up  to  38%, \nwhile  expenditure  may  go  down  by  27%  with  an  estimated  financing  gap  of  about  $460  million.  The  fiscal  deficit  is \nestimated to increase from AMD40 billion (1.0% of GDP), forecast in the 2009 budget, to 6.5% of GDP. Unemployment \nhas  been  increasing,  and  the  crisis  could  wipe  out  the  gains  made  by  Armenia  in  reducing  its  poverty  incidence  from \n55.1% to 22.7% between 1999 and 2008. \n\nThe Crisis Recovery Support Program will enable the Government to respond swiftly to mitigate the adverse impact of the \nglobal  financial  crisis.  The  Program  will  help  the  Government  devise  projects  aimed  at  creating  and  protecting  jobs.  It \nwould allow for the continuation and expansion of safety net programs to cushion and mitigate the adverse impact of the \ncrisis. The Program  will benefit the poor and support efforts to ensure that gains made by the Government in reducing \npoverty are protected. \n\n2. Design Features \n \nThe  Program  is  anchored  on  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  Stand-By  Arrangement  (IMF  SBA),  which  provides  the \noverall  framework  for  macroeconomic  stability  and  structural  reform.  The  Program  has  been  formulated  in  close \nconsultation  with  the  Government  and  after  an  assessment  of  the  impact  of  the  crisis  and  fiscal  needs.  It  is  part  of  a \nwell-coordinated and concerted donor effort to respond to the Government\u2019s urgent request for budget support.  \n \nThe  Program  will,  in  coordination  with  other  international  development  partners,  work  with  the  Government  on  a \nmacroeconomic  stabilization  and  expenditure  management  plan,  and  on  the  restoration  of  economic  growth  and \ndevelopment to pre-crisis levels. \n \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nThe  Program  will  assist  the  Government  in  mitigating  the  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis  through  macroeconomic \nstabilization, and poverty and unemployment reduction measures. It will help to increase social protection expenditures, \nand to protect and create new jobs through public investment programs, especially in poorer regions of Armenia. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe Program has been prepared in response to the Government\u2019s urgent request for assistance. It has been formulated \nafter detailed discussions with the Government, especially the Ministries of Economy, Finance, Labor and Social Issues, \nand  Territorial  Administration,  and  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office.  It  has  also  been  discussed  extensively  with  the  other \ninternational development partners including the IMF and the World Bank. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe  Program  responds  to  an  emergency  need  expressed  by  the  Government.  There  was  no  PPTA.  As  such,  no  C&P \nplan was prepared. However, consultations with stakeholders are being conducted during the preparation of the Program \nand will continue throughout program implementation. \n \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\n \nAre  social  indicators  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  to  facilitate  monitoring  of  social  development \nactivities and/or social impacts during project implementation?  \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\na The pension system comprises state insurance pensions for persons who remained employed in the formal sector, \nand  social  pensions  for  the  rest.  The  average  insurance  pension  is  expected  to  reach  150%  of  the  minimum \nconsumption basket by 2018, and its ratio to the projected average wage is expected to settle at 30% in the long \nrun. Spending on state pensions is projected to increase from the current 3% of GDP to 5.4% in 2021. The funded \npillar is estimated to generate an additional fiscal burden of 0.2%\u20130.4% of GDP. \nb  GDP increased 6.8% in 2008. The average increase was 13.5% in 2006\u20132020. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nANTI-CRISIS SAFETY NET PROGRAMS \n\nSocial Protection Programs and Pensions \n \n1. \nTable A3. \n \n\nThe  2009  budgeted  allocations  for  various  social  protection  services  are  given  in \n\nTable A3: Anti-Crisis Action Plan for Social Protection Sectors \n\n700 \n \n15.9 \n\n2009 Budget \n(AMD million) \n\n3,312.0 \n249.0 \n2.7 \n15.9 \n\n2009 Budget \n($ million) \n8.2 \n0.7 \n0.01 \n0.04 \n1.8 \n \n0.04 \n\n \n \nItem \nPayment of unemployment benefits \nDelivery of professional training \nFinancial support for entrepreneurial activities \nCompensation for material expenses in relocation\nOrganization of paid public works \nPartial wage compensation to employers for \nhiring noncompetitive persons in the labor market \nSource:  Ministry of Labor and Social Issues, Government of Armenia. \n \nFamily Benefits. The Armenian Law on State Benefits grants family benefits to eligible \n2. \ncitizens  to  reduce  extreme  poverty  and  inequality,  especially  in  small  and  medium-sized  cities \nand  rural  areas  of  Armenia,  where  poverty  is highest.  A family\u2019s  eligibility  for  these  benefits  is \nbased  on  its  vulnerability  assessment  score.  The  steady  decrease  in  poverty  since  1999  has \ngreatly reduced the number receiving family benefits to 22.1% of families in 2007, versus 67.7% \nin  1999.  On  the  other  hand,  expenditures  for  family  benefits  increased  by  150%  from  2000  to \n2007, while the average size of the benefit doubled. Data from the 2005 Integrated Household \nSurvey show that family benefits have helped reduce poverty in general, and particularly poverty \namong  the  extremely  poor.  In  2006,  the  average  monthly  family  benefits  equaled  38%  of  the \nfood poverty threshold. The budgetary allocation for family benefits in 2009 is AMD36.57 billion \n($96 million). \n \nUnemployment  Programs.  The  State  Employment  Service  agency  administers  the \n3. \nfollowing  programs:  (i) payment  of  unemployment  allowances,  (ii)  training  for  the  unemployed, \n(iii)  payment  of  costs  related  to  relocation,  (iv)  partial  compensation  to  employers  for  hiring \nuncompetitive  unemployed  persons,  (v)  labor  market  surveys  and  forecasts,  (vi)  paid  public \nworks, and (vii) organization of vacancy fairs.  \n \n4. \nAn  economically  active  person  seeking  work  is  considered  unemployed.  To  receive \nunemployment allowance, a person must (i) declare that he or she has no agricultural land and \nis not involved in any economic activity, (ii) have made social insurance contributions for at least \n1 year,  and  (iii)  not  be  a  pensioner.  The  unemployment  allowance  (now  60%  of  the  minimum \nsalary) is paid for 6 months, plus 1 additional month for every 3 years of prior social insurance \ncontributions,  up  to  a  maximum  of  12  months.  In  January  2009,  the  monthly  unemployment \nallowance was increased from AMD15,000 to AMD18,000. \n \n5. \nAn outlay of AMD4.2 billion ($11 million), 13.8% more than in 2008, has been budgeted \nfor  unemployment  programs  in  2009.  The  crisis  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  the \nunemployment rate to 6.8% in April 2009. The Government estimates an additional requirement \nof AMD0.5 billion\u2013AMD1 billion to operate additional programs for the unemployed in 2009.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25\n\nin  roads, \n\nirrigation  schemes,  drinking-water \n\ntemporary  employment  contracts.  The  projects \n\nPaid Public Works. Under the paid public works (PPW) program, which was started in \n6. \n2004,  communities  (local  governments  in  the  villages)  prepare  proposals  for  small  public \ninfrastructure projects that can be implemented in 3 months or less. These proposals are then \nsubmitted to regional departments (marzpetarans). The marzpetarans and the Ministry of Labor \nand  Social  Issues  (MOLSI)  allocate  the  funds  budgeted  for  PPW  on  the  basis  of  the  social \nconditions in the communities submitting applications, including the number of unemployed and \nthe  number  of  families  registered  for  family  benefits.  To  implement  the  selected  small \ninfrastructure  projects,  the  marzpetarans  hire  registered  unemployed  persons  living  in  the \ninclude \nrespective  communities  on \nimprovements \nfacilities,  schools,  medical \ninstitutions, kindergartens, and historical and cultural assets. \n \nIn  2009,  MOLSI  has  received  applications  for  projects  totaling  AMD1,183  million, \n7. \ncompared with the budgeted amount of AMD700 million ($1.8 million). The Government plans to \nexpand  the  allocation  to  accommodate  more  PPW  requests.  In  2009,  the  daily  wage  rate  for \npersons hired for temporary employment in the PPW program is expected to be AMD2,400. In \n2008,  more  than  7,000  temporary  jobs  were  created,  with  a  budget  allocation  of  AMD683 \nmillion. \n \n8. \nPensions. The major structural reforms planned in the pension area are on track. The \ncurrent  pension  system  is  a  defined-benefit  social  insurance  scheme  supported  by  mandatory \nwage-based  contributions.  A  separate  social  assistance  scheme  financed  from  general \nrevenues  provides  a  guaranteed  pension  (\u201csocial  pension\u201d)  to  those  ineligible  for  the  old-age \npension.  The  social  insurance  program,  which  is  administered  by  the  State  Social  Security \nService (SSSS), pays three basic types of pension benefits: (i) old-age pensions to persons who \nhave  reached  the  age  of  631  and  have  made  payroll  contributions  for  at  least  5  years; \n(ii) disability  pensions  to  those  with  work-related  disabilities,  regardless  of  contribution  history, \nand to those with non-work-related disabilities if they have contributed for at least 5 years; and \n(iii) survivor\u2019s pensions for survivors of recipients of old-age pensions. The Government plans to \nreplace the existing system with a multi-pillar system on 1 January 2010. The new system will \nprovide  a  social  safety  net  for  the  vulnerable  regardless  of  past  contributions  (Zero  Pillar);  a \nbasic  pension  for  those  who  have  contributed,  with  some  differentiation  in  benefit  amounts \nbased  on  the  number  of  years  of  contributions  (First  Pillar);  and  a  funded  individual  savings \naccount for current workers, which will be invested (Second Pillar). \n\n                                                 \n1   The  old-age  pension  age  is  set  at  63  for  both  men  and  women.  However,  the  pension  age  for  women  is  being \n\nincreased gradually from 58 to 63, by 2011. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nInternational Monetary Fund Stand-By Arrangement for Armenia1 \n\n \n1. \nArmenia  enjoyed  a  long  period  of  strong  economic  performance.  Prudent  policies  and \npositive  regional  spillovers  led  to  rapid  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth,  large  capital \ninflows, reduction of government debt as a share of GDP, and low inflation. In November 2008, \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  acknowledging  Armenia's  impressive  performance, \napproved a new low-access Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. \n \nHowever, over December 2008\u2013February 2009, the scenario changed drastically as the \n2. \nglobal  financial  crisis  hit  Armenia  harder  than  envisaged  earlier.  Strong  external  shocks, \nparticularly  emanating  from  Russia,  adversely  affected  the  current  and  capital  accounts. \nRemittances  and  capital  inflows,  which  had  sustained  the  construction  boom  in  recent  years, \ndecelerated  markedly.  Falling  international  commodity  prices  hit  mining,  a  key  export  sector. \nGDP growth came to a halt in the fourth quarter, and fell to 6.8% for all of 2008, after growing at \n10.5%  from  January  to  September.  Depreciation  pressures  on  the  dram  increased  as \ndollarization  took  hold.  The  Government  resisted  the  pressures,  concerned  that  devaluation \nwould  only  make  matters  worse  by  destabilizing  foreign  currency  deposits  and  triggering \nsubstantial deposit withdrawals from the banking system.  \n \n3. \nThe rapid and unexpected deterioration of the economic situation had a strong impact on \nprogram  performance  under  the  PRGF  arrangement.  As  most  of  the  quantitative  performance \ncriteria  were  missed,  the  PRGF  arrangement  was  canceled.  The  Government  requested  the \nIMF for a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) to provide balance-of-payments support. The SBA was \napproved in March 2009 by the Executive Board of the IMF.  \n \n4. \nThe 28-month SDR368 million (about $544 million) SBA for Armenia is aimed at helping \nthe  country  adjust  to  the  deteriorated  global  outlook,  restore  confidence  in  the  currency  and \nfinancial system, and protect the poor. An amount equivalent to SDR161.5 million (about $240 \nmillion)  was  immediately  made  available,  while  the  rest  will  be  accessible  in  nine  installments \nsubject  to  quarterly  reviews.  The  IMF  SBA  entails  exceptional  access  to  IMF  resources, \namounting to about 400% of Armenia\u2019s quota.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s program under the IMF SBA is based on a consistent set of measures \n5. \nregarding exchange rate, monetary, financial, and fiscal policies, as well as continued structural \nreforms. The reforms under IMF SBA involve \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\ntackling the economic and financial challenges confronting Armenia; \nestablishing a high-level committee to monitor developments in the economy and \ncoordinate  the  policy  response  of  the  Government  to  the  ongoing  economic \nchallenges; \nreturning to a flexible exchange rate regime in the immediate future; \nstrengthening financial stability, as a critical part of the program;  \nreturning to an inflation-targeting framework as market conditions stabilize; \nachieving macroeconomic stability, while allowing for continued public investment \nand protection of social services; \nrestricting non-priority expenditures, while protecting social outlays and allowing \nfor higher investment through foreign financing;  \nrestricting  spending  financed  from  domestic  sources  and  relying  on  external \nfinancing to fund the increase in capital spending; \n\n                                                 \n1 IMF. 2009.

Under  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF)  arrangement \nthat  covered  the  period  2005\u20132008,  prudent  macroeconomic  policies  and  structural  reforms \ncontributed to double digit gross domestic product (GDP) growth, low inflation, and a significant \nreduction  in  poverty  rates.  Despite  a  widening  external  current  account  deficit,  international \nreserves  continued  to  increase,  owing  to  large  foreign  exchange  inflows  and  dedollarization, \nand  external  debt  remained  low.  The  overall  fiscal  deficit  was  contained,  and  additional \nrevenues  arising  from  improvements  in  tax  administration  could  be  used  to  finance \npoverty-reducing  expenditures.  Government  debt  remained  stable.  The  monetary  framework \nwas strengthened, contributing, with a flexible exchange rate, to maintaining low inflation. \n \n2. \nIn the first 3 quarters of 2008, growth remained strong, with GDP increasing by 10.4% \nthrough September. Driven by international prices and strong domestic demand, inflation rose to \na high of 11.5% in August, and the current account deficit continued to worsen. In response to \nthese signs of overheating, monetary policy was progressively tightened. \n \nThe  economic  outlook  changed  abruptly  as  the  global  financial  crisis  deepened  in \n3. \nOctober.  Owing  to  its  relative  international  isolation,  the  financial  sector  was  not  directly \naffected.  However,  the  mining  sector  and  exports  were  severely  hit  by  the  sharp  drop  in \ninternational  commodity  prices,  with  many  mines  stopping  operations.  In  addition,  remittances \nand capital inflows slowed considerably, which had a major impact on the construction sector. \nAs a consequence, growth came to a halt, with annual GDP growth falling to 6.8% for the year \nas a whole, and the external current account deficit rising to an estimated 12.6% of GDP. In the \nwake of falling international prices and rapidly slowing domestic demand, inflation fell to 4% in \nJanuary 2009. \n \n4. \nOut of concerns for the impact of a crisis in confidence on financial stability, the Central \nBank of Armenia (CBA) intervened repeatedly to stabilize the exchange rate in the last part of \n2008 and in early 2009. With expectations for a depreciation of the dram gaining strength, the \nCBA  faced  strong  pressures,  leading  to  a  rapid  decline  in  international  reserves.  With  a \nsignificant  amount  of  deposits  being  converted  to  foreign  currency,  and  overall  deposits \ndeclining slightly, banks came under pressure to reduce lending. In this context, and in line with \nthe  changed  inflation  outlook,  the  CBA  eased  monetary  policy,  cutting  the  policy  rate  from \n7.75% in November 2008 to 6.75% in February 2009. \n \n5. \nAs a result of the commodity price shock and our attempt to preserve financial stability, \nwe  missed  most  of  the  end-December  targets  under  the  PRGF  arrangement.  Due  to \nunexpectedly large foreign currency sales, both the end-2008 targets for international reserves \nand net domestic assets of the CBA were missed. In addition, the target on net banking system \ncredit  to  the  government,  as  well  as  that  on  the  underlying  fiscal  balance,  was  also  missed. \nOther targets under the program were respected. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nThe  short-term  economic  outlook  presents  enormous  challenges.  Difficulties  in  many \n6. \nsectors,  including  mining  and  construction,  are  affecting  growth  prospects  and  weakening  the \nlabor  market.  GDP  growth  in  2009  is  projected  to  fall  considerably  with  respect  to  2008,  and \nunemployment  is  expected  to  increase.  Depressed  international  commodity  prices,  falling \nremittances,  and  weaker  capital  inflows  are  putting  pressure  on  the  balance  of  payments, \ndespite  falling  domestic  demand.  The  redollarization  of  the  financial  system  presents  risks  for \nfinancial  stability  and  challenges  for  monetary  policy.  We  are  expecting  a  gradual  recovery  in \n2010,  but  this  is  highly  dependent  on  global  economic  developments,  and  downside  risks  are \nprevalent.  A  strong  policy  response  is  needed  to  restore  confidence,  stop  the  loss  of \ninternational reserves, and maintain macroeconomic stability. \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM FOR 2009 \n\n7. \nThe policies outlined below are designed to tackle the economic and financial challenges \nnow  confronting  Armenia.  These  policies,  which  would  form  the  basis  for  a  new  28-month \nstand-by arrangement from the Fund, are aimed at preserving economic and financial stability, \nwhile mitigating the impact of the global crisis and economic downturn on the poor. Central to \nthis strategy is the return to a flexible exchange rate regime supported by appropriate monetary \npolicies. We are also vigilant to possible distress in the financial sector, and will respond rapidly \nshould more targeted measures be needed. A sound fiscal policy will underpin our commitment \nto  macroeconomic  stability,  while  ensuring  that  growth  promoting  public  investment  moves \nforward. In addition, we want to preserve the impressive gains Armenia has made in reducing \npoverty  in  recent  years.  To  this  end,  we  will  ensure  that  the  level  of  social  services  is \nmaintained,  and  that  programs  to  protect  the  poor  are  expanded  as  needed.  We  will  continue \nour  ambitious  structural  reform  program  aimed  at  strengthening  public  finances,  boosting \nproductivity, and increasing the resilience of the economy. \n \n8. \nWe  will  establish  a  high-level  committee  to  monitor  developments  in  the  economy  and \ncoordinate  the  policy  response  of  the  authorities  to  the  ongoing  economic  challenges.  This \ncommittee  will  be  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister,  and  will  include  representatives  from  the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Economy, the CBA, and the State Revenue Committee. \n\nA. \n\nMonetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies \n\nWe are committed to return to a flexible exchange rate regime in the immediate future. \n9. \nSince  the  deepening  of  the  global  financial  crisis  in  October  2008,  intervention  has  been \nnecessary  to  prevent  a  crisis  of  confidence  that  was  threatening  the  stability  of  the  financial \nsystem.  However,  we  recognize  that  the  maintenance  of  a  soft  peg  has  led  to  a  large  loss  of \ninternational  reserves  and  significant  redollarization  without  stemming  expectations  of  a  dram \ndepreciation.  This,  in  turn,  has  undermined  the  credibility  of  our  inflation-targeting  framework \nand  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy,  which  we  are  committed  to  restoring.  Since \nOctober 2008,  our  exchange  rate  misalignment  has  increased  significantly,  owing  to  the \nworsening  economic  outlook  and  the  currency  depreciation  experienced  by  many  of  our  trade \npartners. We expect the exchange rate to move to a value in line with its fundamentals when we \nreturn  to  a  floating  regime.  When  normal  market  functioning  is  restored,  our  exchange  rate \npolicy will be a managed float with no predetermined path. We are committed to intervening only \nto smooth excessive market volatility and to increase international reserves. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n37\n\n10.  Monetary policy will be geared towards supporting the return to a flexible exchange rate \nregime. As outlined below, we will take any emergency measures necessary to address banks\u2019 \nliquidity  shortages  in  order  to  avoid  any  risks  of  bank  runs.  The  CBA  will  raise  policy  interest \nrates at the time we return to a flexible regime. This will support demand for dram-denominated \nassets,  fight  capital  outflows,  mitigate  any  inflationary  pressures  stemming  from  depreciation, \nand restore confidence in the financial sector. Throughout this transition period, we will conduct \nan open and transparent communication campaign to explain to the public the reasons behind \nthe depreciation and any additional measures needed to preserve financial stability. \n \n11. \n \n\nStrengthening financial stability will be a critical part of the program: \n\nTo  ensure  a  timely  and  consistent  policy  response,  the  CBA  will  prepare  a \ncomprehensive  and  actionable  contingency  plan  for  the  financial  sector.  This \nplan will contain the explicit policy responses to all likely developments, including \nliquidity  shortages  in  the  banking  sector,  with  responsibilities  of  various  parties \nclearly  defined.  The  CBA  will  consult  with  the  government  as  needed  on  the \npreparation of this contingency plan. \n\nWe  recognize  that  the  banking  system  will  be  adversely  affected  by  the \ndepreciation  of  the  dram  and  will  take  all  appropriate  measures  to  ensure  that \nbanks remain able to meet all liabilities as they fall due. The CBA stands ready to \nprovide  liquidity  to  banks  on  a  temporary  basis  in  exchange  for  adequate \ncollateral. The CBA will, on a temporary basis, accept a wider range of collateral, \nincluding  pledged  fixed  assets,  bank  shares,  and  high  quality  bank  loans,  if \nnecessary. \n\nShould  circumstances  warrant  it,  the  coverage  of  the  Deposit  Guarantee  Fund \nwill be increased. In addition, the authorities will approve a plan to increase the \nfor \nresources  of \nend-June 2009). \n\nthe  Deposit  Guarantee  Fund \n\n(performance  criterion \n\nBank  supervision  will  be  enhanced  with  more  intensive  on-site  and  off-site \nsurveillance  and  monitoring.  If  financial  conditions  in  any  banks  appear  to  be \ndeteriorating,  we  will  agree  with  bank  management  and  shareholders  on  a \nrestructuring plan to resolve the difficulties. In the first instance, we would expect \nthe banks\u2019 shareholders to recapitalize the bank to adequate levels. However, we \nwill also set out a framework for using public resources if this approach proves to \nbe inadequate. In exceptional cases, we will provide banks with long-term funds. \nIn  order  to  protect  taxpayers\u2019  interests,  the  banks  will  issue  subordinated  debt, \nwith  an  option  to  convert  such  debt  into  bank  equity.  We  will  also  tighten \nprudential standards,  particularly  regarding  foreign  currency  exposures,  and  will \nprogressively work to reduce banks\u2019 net open positions. \n\n \nAs market conditions stabilize, we will return to our inflation-targeting framework. In the \n12. \nshort  term,  increased  dollarization  will  hamper  the  implementation  of  monetary  policy. \nTherefore,  it  will  be  particularly  important  to  further  strengthen  the  monetary  transmission \nmechanism,  pursue  more  active  liquidity  management,  and  foster  the  development  of  the \nmoney market. To enhance monetary operations and debt management, the MOF and CBA will \nclosely  coordinate  their  liquidity  forecasting  and  MOF  debt  issuance  to  take  account  of  both \nbudget  financing  and  liquidity  management  needs.  Furthermore,  the  CBA  will  continue  to \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nconduct repo operations, and will not go back to issuing its own securities. At the same time, the \ntreasury  will  maintain  its  issuance  of  short-term  T-bills,  including  3-month  and  6-month  T-bills, \nconsistent with the recent memorandum of understanding between the CBA and the MOF. The \nCBA also plans to increase its holdings of treasury securities over the medium term in order to \nstrengthen its capacity to conduct reverse repo operations. \n\nB. \n\nFiscal Policy \n\nFiscal  policy  will  support  macroeconomic  stability,  while  allowing  for  continued  public \n13. \ninvestment  and  protection  of  social  services.  To  this  end,  we  intend  to  limit  the  overall  fiscal \ndeficit in 2009 to around 3% of GDP, excluding nonprogrammed externally-financed investment \nprojects  (see  below).  The  deterioration  in  the  deficit  target  relative  to  the  1%  of  GDP  budget \nobjective is due to the fact that revenue is projected to be significantly lower than the projection \nin  the  budget,  reflecting  the  contraction  in  economic  activity,  particularly  the  downturn  in \nrevenue-generating  sectors  such  as  mining.  As  discussed  below,  the  revenue  shortfall  will  be \noffset in part by restrained spending and some tax policy measures. \n \n14. \nOn spending, we plan to restrict non-priority expenditure, while protecting social outlays \nand  allowing  for  higher  investment  as  foreign  financing  materializes.  To  this  end,  we  expect \nsubstantial savings on nonessential spending and areas where execution has been slow. At the \nsame time, we intend to boost spending on social protection programs, and are in discussions \nwith partners, notably the World Bank, on how to strengthen these programs. \n \nOur  aim  is  to  restrict  spending  financed  by  domestic  resources  and  instead  rely  on \n15. \nexternal  financing  to  fund  the  increase  in  capital  spending.  We  expect  additional  resources  to \nbecome available from external donors and partners on top of what is currently projected by the \nIMF.  While  much  of  these  resources  are  only  partially  concessional,  they  would  allow  us  to \nfinance more public investment projects, and potentially set up credit lines for small and medium \nenterprises.  To  this  end,  we  propose  to  spend  up  to  $200  million  from  those  additional \nresources  on  public  investment  in  2009,  which  would  allow  us  to  increase  our  deficit  target \naccordingly.  We  are  committed  to  maintaining  transparency  in  the  use  of  such  resources  by \nchanneling any additional spending through the budget. We will also limit the use of government \ncash deposits to finance the budget, as we recognize the need to have a cushion for cash-flow \nmanagement purposes, and possibly for future needs. \n \n16.  We are implementing some changes to tax policy. Given the weak revenue outlook and \nthe  difficult conditions  facing  Armenian  firms  with  respect  to  trading  partners,  we  plan  to  raise \ntemporarily  customs  tariffs  for  some  goods.  We  recognize  the  distortionary  impact  of  such  a \npolicy, and the negative impact on the poor. However, the changes in tariff rates are within our \ncommitments to the WTO, and will be limited to a certain number of goods for which Armenian \nsubstitutes exist. In terms of revenue impact, we expect this measure to generate an additional \nAMD10  billion  in  receipts  in  2009.  In  addition,  we  have  recently  raised  presumptive  taxes  on \ntobacco  products,  we  plan  to  raise  excise  taxes  on  imported  alcoholic  beverages,  and  are \nconsidering raising presumptive taxes on petroleum products. Looking forward, we maintain our \nobjective of abolishing presumptive taxation for tobacco and fuel, and to this end, we will submit \nlegislation to parliament by December 2009 to bring petroleum and tobacco products within the \nregular tax regimes (excise tax, customs duties, profit tax, and value-added tax [VAT]), effective \n1 January 2011. \n \n17. \n\nIn 2009, we intend to address two long-standing problems in the tax area: \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n39\n\ntax  credits \n\nlarge  amount  of  outstanding \n\nThe \n(AMD154.4  billion  at \nend-December 2008)  is  associated  with  ad-hoc  collection  practices  in  earlier \nperiods,  including  requests  for  advance  tax  payments.  Halting  these  practices \nand  offsetting  advance  payments  against  future  tax  liabilities  will  provide  an \nimportant  stimulus  during  the  recession.  Therefore,  we  will  not  accumulate \nadditional  tax  credits  during  2009,  and,  more  generally,  we  are  committed  to \nanalyzing  and  fixing  the  systemic  problems  underlying  these  tax  credits  in  the \ncontext of our comprehensive tax administration reform. We have included in the \nprogram a quantitative indicative target on the stock of tax credits. \n\nWe remain committed to introducing best practices in VAT refund processing to \nexporters  by:  (i)  meeting  the  statutory  90-day  processing  deadline  for  all  VAT \nrefund  claims  filed  in  2009,  (ii)  clearing  the  stock  of  late  refund  claims,                        \n(iii)  implementing  risk  management  approaches  (i.e.,  taxpayers  with  good \ncompliance histories  to get  fast-track  refunds, while  risky  cases  face pre-refund \naudits); (iv) implementing a forecasting system to anticipate refund levels so that \nfunds  are  available  to  pay  legitimate  refund  claims  as  they  occur;  and                        \n(v)  submitting  legislation  to  parliament  to  strengthen  penalties  for  false  refund \nclaims  and  pay  interest  on  legitimate  late  refunds  arising  from  claims  filed  after \nDecember  2009,  with  interest  to  be  paid  out  of  VAT  revenues  (structural \nbenchmark for December 2009). We have already significantly reduced the stock \nof refund claims and plan to completely eliminate it over the next few months. \n\nC. \n\nStructural Reforms \n\n1. \n\nPublic Finances \n\nintend \n\nforward,  we \n\nthe  regional \n\nto  continue  consolidating \n\n18.  We  remain  committed  to  our  ambitious  tax  administration  reform  agenda.  To  this  end, \nwe restructured the tax administration organization by adopting a function-based organizational \nstructure, merging the four specialist inspectorates into a single large taxpayer inspectorate, and \nclosing 11 tax inspectorates, all of which became effective in February 2009. We expect these \nchanges  to  generate  savings  and  enhance  cost-effectiveness,  while  securing  a  sustainable \nrevenue  base.  Going \ntax \ninspectorates. We have also completed the merger of the State Customs Service with the State \nTax  Service  into  a  new  organization  named  State  Revenue  Committee  (SRC).  The  merger  is \nexpected  to  generate  efficiency  gains  through  information  sharing  and  administrative  support \nfunctions,  such  as  human  resources  and  IT,  while  the  core  functions  of  customs  and  tax \nadministration will not be integrated. \n \n19. \nOn other fiscal reforms, we plan to introduce a funded pension pillar on 1 January 2010. \nWe intend to revise our estimates of the costs of this reform, as well as those associated with \nthe  planned  increase  in  basic  pensions,  taking  into  consideration  the  weakening  economic \nenvironment. Legislation on the new pension system, including on the unification of income tax \nand social contributions, will be submitted to parliament by mid-2009. The SRC will assume the \ntask  of  collecting  and  reconciling  individual  contributions.  In  the  context  of  the  medium  term \nexpenditure framework (MTEF), we intend to produce an analytical report on medium-term fiscal \nrisks, including those arising from the introduction of the funded pillar and the costs associated \nwith  the  planned  increase  in  basic  and  average  pensions  over  the  next  few  years.  To  further \nimprove  our  fiscal  framework,  we  intend  to  improve  the  MTEF  by  including  a  section  on  debt \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nmanagement, which will help align policy decisions over the medium term, with their long-term \nfiscal  implications.  Finally,  we  plan  to  complete  the  specific  part  of  the  unified  tax  code  by \nJune 2009. \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Sector \n\n20.  We  remain  committed  to  the  financial  sector  reforms  outlined  in  the  Memorandum  of \nEconomic  and  Financial  Policies  underpinning  our  November  2008  PRGF  request.  In  the \ncurrent crisis, our focus is on ensuring financial stability, including through the adoption of the \nmeasures  discussed  above.  Nonetheless,  we  will  continue  to  implement  our  reform  agenda, \nincluding: \n \n\nFoster  the  development  of  commercial  banks\u2019  risk  management  capacity,  and \nintegrate  an  assessment  of  banks\u2019  risk  management  systems  into  the  CBA\u2019s \nregular supervisory activity; \n\nEnhance credit availability and improve financial intermediation; \n\nLaunch our campaign to educate consumers about financial terms, products, and \nservices; and \n\nFurther  develop  the  securities  market  as  laid  out  in  our  capital  market \ndevelopment  action  plan.  To  increase  the  stock  of  government  securities \navailable for open market operations, we will amend Article 11 of the \u201cLaw on the \nCentral  Bank  of  the  Republic  of  Armenia\u201d  to  allow  a  gradual  recapitalization  of \nthe  CBA  with  marketable  interest-bearing  securities  (structural  benchmark  for \nend-September 2009). \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nOther Structural Reforms \n\n21. \nDespite  the  difficult  economic  climate,  we  will  continue  our  wide-ranging  structural \nreform  agenda  outlined  in  our  Sustainable  Development  Program.  This  agenda  is  aimed  at \ndeepening  productivity,  enhancing  structural  reforms,  and  improving  governance.  A  key  area \nwill be continued efforts to strengthen the business environment. The tax administration reforms \noutlined above will help in this regard, and we will continue our fight against corruption. \n\nIII. \n\nPROGRAM FINANCING \n\n22. \nArmenia  faces  significant  financing  needs  during  the  program  period.  Our  estimates \nsuggest  that  a  large  financing  gap  in  2009  is  likely,  due  to  a  significant  reduction  in  export \nearnings,  private  transfers,  and  private  capital  inflows.  The  decline  in  export  earnings  reflects \nthe sharp drop in base metals prices and weakening external demand, while the steep drop in \nprivate transfers and capital inflows is particularly associated with the sharp contraction of the \nRussian  economy,  from  which  the  majority  of  both  remittances  and  foreign  direct  investment \n(FDI) originate. \n \n23. \nIn  the  current  global  climate  there  are  limited  available  sources  of  financing.  FDI  is \nprojected to slow considerably in line with the expected weakening of the Russian economy, the \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n41\n\nmain source of such inflows. The bulk of official external financing included in the program will \nbe provided by the World Bank. \n \n24. \nThe resulting financing gap can only be partially financed from domestic adjustment. The \ncurrent account position is expected to adjust significantly under the program scenario, declining \nby  close  to  $300  million  relative  to  the  program  concluded  with  the  Fund  in  November  2008. \nNevertheless,  absent  Fund  financing,  official  foreign  exchange  reserves  would  fall  below  the \ndesirable minimum level, and cover less than 3 months of imports. \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM MONITORING \n\nIn  the  context  of  significant  external  financing  needs  associated  with  severe  external \n25. \nshocks,  we  would  like  to  request  a  28-month  Stand-By  Arrangement  in  the  amount  of \nSDR368 million.  The  funding  requested  would  cover  the  remaining  projected  balance  of \npayments needs during 2009 and part of the projected financing gaps in 2010\u20132011. The IMF \nfinancing  would  be  utilized  to  assure  financial  stability  and  to  maintain  Armenia\u2019s  gross \ninternational  reserves  at  a  level  sufficient  to  cover  about  3  months  of  imports  of  goods  and \nservices at the end of the program. \n \nThe  program  will  be  monitored  via  quarterly  performance  criteria  and  structural \n26. \nbenchmarks.  Progress  in  implementing  the  program  will  be  monitored  through  quantitative \ncriteria  and  indicative  targets  outlined  in  Table  A6.1  as  well  as  structural  performance  criteria \nand benchmarks as listed in Table A6.2. The structural measures discussed above that are not \nmentioned  in  Table  A6.2  are  part  of  the  authorities\u2019  overall  reform  effort,  but  are  not  part  of \nconditionality under this program. The first review of the program is expected to be completed \non or after 15 May 2009, the second review on or after 15 August 2009, the third review on or \nafter 15 November 2009, and the fourth review on or after 15 February 2010. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nTable A6.1: Quantitative Targets, 2009a \n(End of period ceilings on stocks, unless otherwise specified) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n2009 \n\n2008 \n\n(78.2) \n\n(23.6) \n\n(36.3) \n\n(96.2) \n\n(54.0) \n\nJun \nAct. \n\nDec \nPrel. \n\nSep \nProg.b \n\nDec \nProg.b \n\nJun \nProg. b \n\n2007 \nDec \nAct. \n\n(92.5) \n427.1 \n125.3 \n\n \n75.9 \n \n \n\n \n(8.1) \n \n \n\n \n148.9 \n \n \n\n \n191.3 \n \n \n(2.7) \n \n\n \n195.5 \n \n \n(1.8) \n \n\nMar \nProg. b \n(billions of dram) \n\n \n \nItem \n \nNet domestic \nassets of the CBAc \nNet banking system \ncredit to the \ngovernment \nProgram fiscal \nbalance (floor) \nReserve moneyd \nStock of tax creditsd \n \nExternal arrears \n(continuous \ncriterion) \nNet official \ninternational \nreserves (floor)c \n(  ) = negative, CBA = Central Bank of Armenia. \na All items are defined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding between the IMF and Armenia contained in IMF Country                         \n  Report 09/140, May 2009. \nb Performance criterion. \nc At program exchange rates. \nd Indicative target. \nSource: Government of Armenia. \n \n\n(31.9) \n381.3 \n154.4 \n(millions of dollars) \n \n \n\n \n196.1 \n \n \n(9.4) \n \n\n(142.8) \n464.1 \n145.0 \n\n(102.2) \n439.5 \n145.0 \n\n(73.3) \n419.8 \n154.4 \n\n(87.6) \n449.7 \n154.4 \n\n(21.5) \n412.7 \n129.8 \n\n             0 \n505.9 \n\n             0 \n568.4 \n\n             0 \n1,279.6 \n\n             0 \n1,084.7 \n\n            0 \n455.9 \n\n            0 \n455.9 \n\n            0 \n1,350.1 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nTable A6.2: Proposed Structural Conditionality for 2009 \n\nProposed Time Frame \n(End of Period) \nJune 2009 \n\nType of Conditionality \n\nPerformance criterion \n\nSeptember 2009 \n\nBenchmark \n\nMeasure \nApprove a plan to increase the resources of \nthe Deposit Guarantee Fund (see \nMEFP\u00b611) \nSubmit to parliament an amendment to \nArticle 11 of the \u201cLaw on the Central Bank of \nthe Republic of Armenia\u201d to allow a gradual \nrecapitalization of the CBA with marketable \ninterest bearing securities (see MEFP\u00b620) \nIntroduce best practices in VAT refund \nprocessing to exporters (see MEFP\u00b617) \n\n \n\n \n\n    CBA = Central Bank of Armenia, MEFP = Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, VAT = value-added tax. \n    Sources: Government of Armenia. \n\nDecember 2009 \n\nBenchmark \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n43\n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\nNo withdrawals shall be made in respect of: \n \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  included  in  the  following  groups  or  subgroups  of  the \nUnited  Nations  Standard  International  Trade  Classification,  Revision  3  (SITC, \nRev.  3),  or  any  successor  groups  or  subgroups  under  future  revisions  in  the \nSITC, as designated by ADB to the Borrower: \n\nChapter  Heading \n\nDescription of Items \n\nTable A7: Ineligible Items \n \n\n \n\n971 \nSource: United Nations. \n \n(ii) \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n718.7 \n\nAlcoholic beverages \nTobacco, unmanufactured;

ADB also conducted a governance and institutional \ncorruption  risk  assessment  (GICRA)  in  Armenia.1  The  major  findings  of  the  two  reports  are \nsummarized below. \n\n1. \n\nAssessment of PFM Performance \n\n \n\nThe report analyzed the upstream and downstream public financial management \n\n2. \nprocesses of the Government of Armenia.  The following are the main findings of the Report. \n \n\nBudget Credibility. Budgets are realistic and largely executed as planned. State \nbudget  revenue  forecasts  are  met  and  exceeded,  allowing  the  deficit  to  be \nmaintained  at  the  planned  level.  There  is  no  significant  risk  to  overall  budget \ncredibility. \n\nand \n\nimproved,  with \n\nTransparency.  Comprehensiveness \n\nand \nComprehensiveness \ntransparency  have \ninformation  on  budget  policies  and \nmacroeconomic  forecasts  publicly  available  and  published  in  mass  media  and \nthe official websites of relevant government agencies. Some risks related to the \noversight  of  public  sector  entities  (state  and  community  noncommercial \norganizations and companies), however, remain. \n\nPolicy-Based  Budgeting.  There  has  been  a  significant  improvement  in  the \nbudget  preparation  process,  with  the  different  sectors\u2019  policies  in  long-term \nstrategies \nin  advance  with  medium-term  expenditure \nframeworks.  The  budget  proposal  preparation  process  has  a  clear  institutional \nbasis and is carried out according to legislative requirements. \n\n(PRSP)  adopted \n\n \n(iv)   Predictability  and  Control  in  Budget  Execution.  Budget  execution  is  more \npredictable,  with  largely  comprehensive  and  clear  taxpayer  liabilities,  and  fairly \nlimited discretionary powers of tax authorities. Reliable systems are in place for \nrecording and managing cash balances, debt and guarantees, and predictability \nin  the  availability  of  funds  for  commitment  of  expenditures  and  organization  of \nprocurement. \n\nAccounting,  Recording,  and  Reporting.  Budget  account  reconciliation  and \naccounting  and  reporting  are  under  control  and  regulated.  The  single  Treasury \naccount  is  reconciled  daily  with  the  corresponding  account  in  the  Central \nTreasury  at  aggregate  and  detailed  levels,  as  well  as  the  extra-budgetary \naccounts.  Data  presentation  in  reports  follows  a  functional,  economic,  and \nadministrative  classification  that  conforms  to  the  budget.  The  reports  are \n\n                                                 \n1  Ministry  of  Finance.  2008.  Public  Financial  Management  Performance  Measurement  Report.

There are concerns over the accuracy of some \ndata,  namely,  those  on  funds  outside  the  Treasury  system;  however,  overall, \nthese concerns are not significant in terms of their impact on the accuracy of the \nstatements.  A  consolidated  government  statement  (consolidating  the  state  and \ncommunity  budget  execution)  is  prepared  yearly.  Information  on  revenue, \nexpenditure,  and  bank  account  balances  may  not  always  be  complete,  but  the \nomissions  are  not  significant.  The  consolidated  statement  is  submitted  for \nexternal audit within 5 months at the end of the fiscal year. \n\nExternal  Scrutiny  and  Audit.  The  Chamber  of  Control  was  established  and \noperates  in  Armenia  and  reports  to  the  legislature.  The  Government  provides \nofficial information to the Chamber of Control on the follow-up measures taken to \ncorrect  violations  identified  in  the  reports  of  the  Chamber  of  Control  within  the \nspecified period.  \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n3. \nsome weak areas: \n \n\nIndicator \n\nThe  procedures  established  by  law  enable  the  National  Assembly  to  scrutinize \nthe  fiscal  policies,  medium-term  fiscal  framework,  and  priorities  underlying  the \nbudget  proposals  submitted  by  the  Government,  as  well  as  the  details  of \nexpenditure and revenue. Each year, the National Assembly discusses the state \nbudget  execution  report  within  the  specified  period  provided  that  there  is  an \nopinion  by  the  Chamber  of  Control.  The  legislation  covering  the  area  does  not \nenable  the  Chamber  of  Control  to  issue  recommendations  on  the  annual  state \nbudget execution report. \n \nAssessment of the Impact of PFM Weaknesses \n\n2. \n \nThere have been many improvements in the PFM system in Armenia. The following are \n\nTable A8.1: Weaknesses in PFM System \n \n\n \n\n      Scorea \n\nEffectiveness of internal audit \nComprehensiveness, relevance, and understanding of internal controls \nCoverage and quality of the internal audit function \nQuality and timeliness of annual financial statements \nAccounting standards of annual financial statements \nScope, nature, and follow-up of external audit \na  For  information  on  scoring,  please  see  World  Bank.  2005.

Public Financial Management Performance Measurement Report. Yerevan. \n\nThe Report assigns the following reasons for the poor scores against certain indicators: \n\nIn the budget credibility area, there are still issues related to the documentation \nof  expenditure  arrears.  These  could  adversely  affect  the  overall  level  of  budget \ndiscipline  and  lead  to  an  increase  in  expenditure  arrears,  thereby  undermining \nthe strategic allocation of resources, with negative impact on the effectiveness of \npublic services provided by the State. \n\n \n4. \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n  \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n  \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(i)  \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n(ii) \n\u2022 \n\n \n(iii) \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nIn budget comprehensiveness, there are still issues related to the control of the \noverall fiscal risk from other public sector entities, which do not allow a clear and \ncomplete  understanding  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  Government  in  maintaining \nfinancial discipline and managing financial risks. \n\nThe  adoption  of  policy-based  budgeting  is  very  useful.  However,  currently,  the \nincomplete  introduction  of  performance  budgeting  does  not  allow  a  proper \nlinkage  between  the  budget  and  policy  measures.  This,  in  turn,  does  not  clarify \nfor line ministers the indicators for intra-sector allocation in line with government \npolicy  priorities  for  a  given  sector,  and  undermines  the  assessment  and \ndiscussion of budget efficiency. \n\nPredictability in budget execution is commendable. However, outstanding issues \nin the area of control impede future progress. Internal audit in state bodies falls \nshort of international standards. Similarly, tax collection is affected by the lack of \nclear, risk-based criteria in audit plans.  \n\nAccounting,  recording,  and  reporting  have  improved.  However,  reports  contain \nonly  information  on  cash  expenditure,  and  thereby  do  not  give  a  full  picture  of \nlong-term  financial  stability  and  efficiency  of  policy  measures.  National  Public \nSector Financial Reporting Standards consistent with International Public Sector \nAccounting Standards (IPSAS) are not yet in place. \n\n \nB. \n \n5. \n \n\nGovernance and Institutional Corruption Risk Assessment \n\nThe GICRA completed by ADB in 2008 identified the following risks: \n\nPublic Financial Management \nThe  absence  of  an  independent  and  technically,  ethically,  and  professionally \nstrong accounting and auditing profession. \nWeak \nmethodology of internal audits and the poor quality of internal audit reports. \n\ninadequate  scope,  approach,  and \n\ninternal  controls,  due \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nProcurement \nLack of capacity at the State Procurement Agency and procuring units which may \nresult in inappropriate procurement. \n\nAnticorruption \nWeak coordination and monitoring of the Anticorruption Strategy, which may lead \nto weak implementation of the controls against corruption. \nOverall public perception of the Government\u2019s poor controls against corruption. \nEmerging legal provisions for the full range of customer due diligence. \n\nDetailed  risk  assessments,  grading  risks  by  severity  and  likelihood  of  occurrence  are \n\n \n6. \ngiven in the following matrices. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n47\n\nTable A8.2: Risk Severity Matrix for Public Financial Management \n\nLikelihood of Event Occurring \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nh\ng\nH\n\ni\n\n \n\ns\ns\ne\nn\ns\nu\no\ni\nr\ne\nS\n\n/\nt\nc\na\np\nm\n\nI\n\nLow \nTechnical demands and \nresulting implications of the \ntransition from cash-based \nto accrual-based \naccounting, which may \nconstrain the capacity of the \nGovernment to decide and \ncontrol budget totals in the \nshort term \n\nModerate \n\nNonrecognition of \ninternational \nstandards of \naccounting and \nauditing in the public \nsector, as a \nfundamental driver of \nthe statutory mandate \nof the COC \n \nInadequate \nsimultaneous \nprovisions for \neducation, training, \nqualifications, etc. \n\nAbsence of an effective \nGFMIS system, which may \nlead to shortfalls in funding \npriority expenditures \n\n \n\n \ne\nt\na\nr\ne\nd\no\nM\n\n \n\nw\no\nL\n\nNo clear differentiation \nbetween internal audit and \nexternal audit.

This factor may \nlimit public participation in \nanticorruption activities.  \n \nInadequate institutional \neducation and training in human \nrights and fundamental \nfreedoms, limiting public \ninvolvement in combating \ncorruption \n\nHigh \n\nCapacity constraints in \ncoordination, including the limited \ncapacity of the Government to \nconduct participatory monitoring \nof the implementation of the ACS \nand sector-specific anticorruption \naction plans. The constraints \nmay weaken the implementation \nof controls against corruption.  \n \nPoor overall public perception of \nthe Government\u2019s controls \nagainst corruption \n \nNo legal provisions for the full \nrange of customer due-diligence \nmeasures, and for due diligence \nfor higher-risk customers or \ntransactions, such as politically \nexposed persons. This lack may \nhamper the effective prevention, \ninvestigation, and prosecution of \ncases of corruption. \n \n\nInadequate contribution of \npolitical parties in achieving \nconsensus on and demonstrating \ncommitment to controls against \ncorruption. This may lead to \nineffective implementation of \ncontrols against corruption. \n \nAbsence of laws protecting \ncomplainants and whistle \nblowers. This lack may \ndiscourage the public from \nreporting on corruption matters. \n \nInadequate institutional capacity \nof the SCPEC, which may slow \ndown investigations of \nanticompetitive practices and \noversight of tenders and auctions \nin the context of anticompetitive \nagreements \n\nACS  =  anticorruption  strategy,  AML  =  anti\u2013money  laundering,  CBA  =  Central  Bank  of  Armenia,  FMC  =  Financial \nMonitoring  Center,  SCPEC  =  State  Commission  for  the  Protection  of  Economic  Competitiveness  of  the  Republic  of \nArmenia, STS = State Tax Service. \nSource: ADB. 2008.
