The loans \nwill help the Government of Armenia (the Government) maintain \nits core public expenditure program. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General Intervention \nSector  (subsectors):  Multisector  (public  expenditure  and  fiscal \nmanagement, social protection) \nThemes (subthemes): Economic growth, social development, \ngovernance (promoting macroeconomic stability, other vulnerable \ngroups) \nLocation impact: National (high) \n   \nEnvironment  Category  C.  No  significant  adverse  environmental  impact  is \nAssessment  anticipated. \n   \nSocial Safeguards  Involuntary resettlement: Category C. \nAssessment  Impact of indigenous people:  Category C. \nNo involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is \nexpected. \n   \nRationale and  After growing at an average of 13.5% in 2006\u20132007, Armenian \nDescription  economy moderated with a real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth of 6.8% in 2008. It declined by 9.7% in the first 4 months of \n2009 and is expected to decelerate by around 9.5% in 2009. \nRemittances, which at $1.5 billion accounted for 13% of GDP in \n2008,  are  projected  to  be  around  30%  less  this  year.  The \nArmenian  dram  (AMD)  has  depreciated  25%  against  the  US \ndollar, significant since 70% of the economy is dollarized. The \nGovernment faces a revenue shortfall of 22% and a financing gap \nof $460 million. The fiscal deficit is estimated to increase from \nAMD40  billion  (1.0%  of  GDP),  forecast  in  the  original  2009 \nbudget, to 6.5% of GDP. Unemployment has been increasing and \nis likely to further rise sharply. The crisis could reverse much of \nthe gains made by Armenia in reducing its poverty incidence from \n55.1%  in  1999  to  22.7%  in  2008.  Without  fiscal  support,  the \nGovernment  will  be  unable  to  maintain  its  core  public \nexpenditures, and recover and sustain growth. \n \n   ", "ii   \nSpecial Features  The proposed Crisis Recovery Support Program (the Program) \nwill enable the Government to mitigate the adverse impact of the \nglobal financial crisis. The Program is anchored on the Stand-By \nArrangement (SBA) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \nwhich provides the overall framework for macroeconomic stability \nand  structural  reform.  Further,  the  Government\u2019s  own  crisis \nmitigation  plan  will  be  the  public  expenditure  anchor  for  the \nsupport from ADB. The Program has been formulated in close \nconsultation  with  the  Government  and  after  an  assessment  of \ncrisis impact and fiscal needs. It is part of a well-coordinated and \nconcerted  donor  effort  to  respond  to  the  Government\u2019s  urgent \nrequest for budget support. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  The  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  fully  used  by \n31 December 2009.  \n \nExecuting and  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The \nImplementing Agencies  Ministry of Economy will be the Implementing Agency, responsible \nfor  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  Program  outcome, \noutputs and targets. \n \nTranching  The two loans will be disbursed in a single tranche once they take \neffect. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested a loan of $80 million equivalent \nfrom ADF resources. The Program will comprise two loans totaling \n$80  million  equivalent.  The  split  into  two  loans  is  due  to  the \navailability of ADF resources for Armenia. The first loan will be of \n$46.3  million  equivalent  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, with an annual interest rate of 1% during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter; a term of 24 years including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and other terms and conditions substantially in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement.  The \nsecond  loan  of  $33.7  million  equivalent  will  be  financed  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an annual interest rate of \n1.6% during the entire term of 24 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years, and other terms and conditions set forth in the program \nloan agreement. \n ", "  iii\nProcurement and  The foreign currency proceeds from the loans will be used to pay \nDisbursement  for items procured in ADB member countries, other than the items \nspecified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced from other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \nThe proceeds of the loans will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s \nsimplification  of  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements for program loans. Loan proceeds disbursed against \nimports will require a certificate from the Government stipulating \nthat the value of the total imports of Armenia, minus its imports \nfrom  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance, is at least \nequal  to  the  amount  of  the  loans  to  be  disbursed  during  a \nparticular year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nCounterpart Funds  The Government shall ensure that the local currency generated \n  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  is  used  mainly  to  \n(i) compensate in part for the large revenue shortfall and enable \nthe Government to maintain its core public expenditure program \n(salaries and essential social services); and (ii) make possible \npublic expenditures and investments that will provide safety nets \nand create jobs. \n \nBenefits   The Program will help the Government cushion and mitigate the \nadverse impact of the crisis. It will benefit the poor and support \nefforts to protect the gains made by the Government in reducing \npoverty. It will enable the Government to \n \n(i)  maintain its core public expenditure program without any \nfurther cuts over and above adjustments already made; \n(ii)  meet its social safety net spending needs; and \n(iii)  create at least 6,500 new jobs by the end of 2009.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Risks: \n \n(i)  Worsening of the global financial crisis\u2014or its continuation \nfor  a  period  longer  than  anticipated\u2014could  hinder  the \nGovernment\u2019s economic recovery plans. \n(ii)  Any political changes could alter the Government\u2019s ability \nto implement anti-crisis measures. \n \nAssumptions: \n \n(i)  Macroeconomic  reforms  supported  under  the  IMF  SBA \nremain on track \n(ii)  Development partners provide timely and adequate budget \nsupport and technical assistance. \n(iii)  All projects are initiated and completed as planned. \n   \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nprogram  loans  to  the  Republic  of  Armenia  for  the  Crisis  Recovery  Support  Program  (the \nProgram).1  \nII.  RECENT MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE  \n2.  Pre-Crisis Economic Performance. Armenia is a small, open economy that relies \nheavily on  remittances, foreign investment, and imports.  With real gross domestic product \n(GDP) increasing yearly by an average of more than 10% (Table 1), Armenia has been a stable \nand strong performer in the region. Much of the recent growth was fueled by the construction \nand mining sectors. The share of construction in GDP increased from 9% in 2001 to 23% in \n2008.  Remittances  and  capital  inflows  sustained  the  construction  boom,  while  increasing \ninternational commodity prices helped the mining sector. Remittances also boosted domestic \nconsumption.  \n \nTable 1: Selected Economic Indicators for Armenia \n \nItem  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nReal GDP growth (%)  9.6  13.2  14.0  10.5  14.0  13.2  13.8  6.8 \nGDP per capita ($)      874           \nGovernment budget  228.7  266.3  343.8  364.1  449.9  533.4  698.3  774.5 \n(AMD billion) \nUnemployment rate (%)  10.4  10.8  10.1  9.6  8.2  7.4  7.0  6.3 \nPoverty rate (%)  50.9    42.9  34.6  29.8  26.5  25.0  22.7 \n(1999 = 56.1) \nAverage monthly wage  24,483  27,324  34,783  43,445  52,060  62,293  74,227  91,539 \n(all sectors, AMD) \nAverage monthly  4,574  5,748  7,452  8,842  9,805  10,912  12,746  21,370 \npension (AMD) \nExports ($ million)   341.8  505.1  685.6  722.9  973.9  985.1  1,152.3  1,069.1 \nImports ($ million)  877.3  987.2  1279.5  1350.7  1,801.7  2,191.6  3,267.8  4,411.7 \nAMD/$  555.1  573.4  578.8  533.5  457.7  416.0  342.1  305.8 \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Asian Development Outlook (GDP estimate); International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2009, 2006) (Table 1) (real \nGDP growth actual; poverty rate); IMF (various) (Table 5); National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia (Government incomes and official transfers, exports, imports, unemployment rate, poverty rate \n[except 2001\u20132003, 2008], and exchange rate). \n \n3.  Robust growth boosted government revenues, which in turn led to significant increases \nin public sector wages, government  pensions,2 and social benefits (transfer payments such as \nfamily allowances and unemployment benefits) (Table 1). Average wages and GDP per capita \nmore than tripled in the past 8 years. Unemployment dropped by 40% (Figure 1), and poverty \nincidence was cut in half (Table 1 and Figure 2).  \n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 The base pension amount was increased by 60% on 1 January 2008 and by 13%\u201316% a year later. The \nunemployment insurance benefit has been increased to equal 60% of the minimum consumption basket. As an \nimportant efficiency measure, the Government has acted to plug leaks in the benefit program for poor families. \nFollowing better integration of household registry data, around 12,000 undeserving families were removed from the \nprogram, thereby saving AMD1.6 billion ($4.4 million).

Inflation  accelerated  from  4.4%  in  2007  to  9.0%  in  2008,  or \nsignificantly above the Government\u2019s target of 4.0% plus or minus 1.5%. In the first half of 2008, \nrecord prices of food and energy were the main culprits. Year-on-year inflation peaked at 11.5% \nin  August  2008  before  moderating  to  5.2%  in  December 2008  and  declining  to  3.1%  in \nApril 2009 year-on-year.  \n \n5.    Strong Commitment to Reform. Armenia has embarked on an ambitious set of \nreforms, including stimulating competition among enterprises, improvement of the business and \ninvestment  climate,  deepening  of  financial  intermediation,  reform  of  tax  policy  and  tax \nadministration,  public  sector  modernization,  regional  development,  termination  of  poorly \ntargeted subsidies,3 and program budgeting and public financial management. Reflecting the \nprogress of reforms in some of these areas, Armenia was ranked 44th in the World Bank\u2019s \nDoing Business survey of 2009.  \nIII.  IMPACT OF GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS \n6.  Armenia among the Worst-Affected Countries in the Region. Armenia has felt the \nimpact of the global economic crisis mainly because of the slowdown in the Russian Federation, \nthe source of more than 75% of remittances to Armenia and more than 70% of foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) in the country. Table 2 presents the medium-term macroeconomic outlook for \nArmenia. Measured in terms of real GDP growth, Armenia has been the worst-affected country \nin the region. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  The Government has increased water and electricity rates and phased out the gas subsidy to improve cost \nrecovery and reduce poorly targeted subsidies.

Drop in Remittances. Remittances from migrant workers, which totaled $1.5 billion in \n2008 (around 13% of GDP), declined by 32% year-on-year in the first 3 months of 2009 (Figures \n3 and 4), and the reduction is expected to persist throughout 2009. Since most remittances from \nmigrant  workers  are  spent  rather  than  saved,  the  drop  in  remittances  has  directly  and \nsubstantially affected consumption, as reflected in a slump in value-added tax (VAT) revenues, \nthe largest portion of tax revenues. \n \n \n \nF Figiguurere 3 :4 :R Rememittitatnacnecse,s     Figure 4: Change in Amount of Remittances\nQ1 2004\u2013Q1 2009 \n  (Q1 2004-Q12009)  Compared to Same Month in Previous Year,\n  2008\u20132009 \n   \n70%\n600   60%\n50%\n500   40%\non 400   30%\nilli 300   1200%%\nM   0%\n$  200   -10%\n-20%\n100   -30%\n0   -40%\nApr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr \n1 3  1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 2008                                                       2009 \nQ Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q\n  4  4  5  5  6  6  7  7  8  8  9 \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20\n \n    Source: Central Bank of Armenia. \nSource: Central Bank of Armenia. \n \n \n8.  Construction Slowdown. Construction, a major driving force behind Armenia\u2019s robust \neconomic growth in recent years, slowed as the demand for apartments and offices weakened. \nSince most FDI was channeled into construction, the sharp falloff in FDI since April 2008, \ncombined with the reduction in demand, slashed construction activity by 31% in the second half \nof 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, value creation in the sector was down by 22% compared \nwith the same period in 2008. \n \n9.  Waning Fortunes in Mining. The Armenian mining sector has also been seriously \naffected by the global economic slowdown. Slack demand for metals dramatically lowered the \nprices  of  copper  and  molybdenum  ores,4  and  triggered  the  layoff  of  hundreds  of  sector \n                                                 \n4  Copper prices decreased by more than 50% from July to October 2008, while molybdenum prices fell by more than \ntwo thirds from October to November 2008. \n \n ", "4   \nemployees.  These  layoffs,  combined  with  declining  employment  in  construction  and  other \nindustries, pushed up unemployment from 6.3% in January 2009 to 6.8% in early April. Since \nmineral ores compose a large portion of Armenia\u2019s exports, the value of exports also shrank, by \n47% from the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009 (Figure 5).  \n \n \n \nFigure 5: Total Exports, 2007\u20132009 \n \n  600 \n \n500 \n \n  n  400 \no\n   Milli 300 \n  $  200 \n \n100 \n \n  0 \n2007 2007 2007 2007 2008 2008 2008 2008 2009 \n \nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 \n \n  Source:GovernmentofArmenia.\n \n \n10.  Economic  Doldrums.  The  problems  in  construction  and  mining  were  mirrored  by \nproblems in the economy as a whole. Real GDP increased at an annual rate of 10.4% in the first \n3 quarters of 2008 before plunging to zero growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 and losing 9.7% \nthrough the first 4 months of 2009  (Figure 6). The Armenian dram (AMD) depreciated by 25% \nagainst the US dollar. And the percentage of delinquent loans in commercial bank portfolios \ndoubled to 8%. \n \n \nFigure 6: GDP Growth, 2001\u20132009\n \n \n20\n \n13.2\n  15 9.6 14 14 13.2 13.8\nh  10.5\n  wt10\n  o 6.8\nr\n  e G 5 \n  ag 0 \nt\n  n\ne\nc -5 \n  r\ne\n    P-10 -9.7 \n \n-15\n \n      Source: Government of Armenia. \n \n \n11.  Falling Revenues. Government revenues, which had risen steadily in recent years \n(Table 1), have fallen even more steeply than real GDP. The Government had assumed 9.2% \nGDP growth when projecting revenues. In fact, revenue collections fell by 16.7% in the first \nquarter of 2009 (compared with the first quarter of 2008). The drop of 20.1% in VAT collections \nand 15.9% in profit tax collections in the first quarter, year-on-year, has been the most extreme. ", "  5\nThe Government now expects revenue collections to be 13%\u201315% lower in 2009 than in 2008, \nmissing the budget target by around 28%. \n \n12.  Large Budget Deficit and Financing Gap. Barring an unexpected, rapid reversal of the \nsharp deterioration in the economy and in tax revenues since last quarter of  2008, it is clear \nthat the Government budget deficit for 2009 will far exceed the AMD40 billion ($105 million; 1% \nof GDP) forecast when the budget was adopted by Parliament in November 2008. As forecast \nby the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 9.5% decline in GDP, with government revenues \ndeclining  by  6.7%  year-on-year  from  2008  to  2009  with  corresponding  adjustments  in \nexpenditure would increase the budget deficit to AMD217 billion ($564 million), or 6.5% of GDP, \nand create a financing gap of $460 million (Table 3). The budget deficit and the corresponding \nfinancing  gap  would  be  significantly  larger  if  the  revenues  were  to  decline  further  and \nexpenditure suspensions were not made by the Government.  \n \nTable 3:  2009 Budget Scenarios \n(AMD billion) \n \n Item  Approved Budget  Post-Crisis Revisions a \nRevenues and Grants (2008 estimate = 731) (A)               879                        682  \nExpenditures (2008 estimate = 793)               919                        919  \n   Less Suspensions (Non-critical)                           50  \n   Plus Additional Expenditure                           30  \nNet Expenditure (B)                         899  \nBudget Deficit  (C) = A-B                (40)                      (217) \n   Less:  Adjustments (net of domestic and  \n   external financing) (D)  40                         40  \nFinancing Gap = [C]-[D]    0                                  (177) \n     \nMemorandum Items     \nGDP Growth                9.2                       (9.5) \nGDP (2008 estimate = 3,646)            4,169                     3,350  \nBudget Deficit/GDP (%)  (1.0)                        6.5  \nRevenue Shortfall against Target (%)            22.4  \n     \nRevenues ($ million)            2,882                     1,771  \nExpenditures ($million)            3,013                     2,335  \nBudget Deficit ($ million)               131                        564  \nFinancing Gap ($ million)                                      (460) \nExchange Rate against dollar  305                       385  \n(  ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \na  Revenues decline by 6.7% year-on-year.

Projected Impact of the Financial Crisis on Poverty. As the financial crisis deepens \nunemployment,  poverty  will  intensify  because  unemployment  allowances  benefit  only  the \neligible unemployed in the short term and only partly replace lost income from employment. The \nslump in remittances, on which many families depend particularly for consumption, will also \ncause poverty to worsen. If GDP were to contract by 8% and remittances from immediate family \nmembers by 25% (and those from other remittance senders by 50%), 211,000 more people \ncould fall below the poverty line, and 183,000 below the extreme poverty line, in 2009. The \npoverty rate would climb by about 6.5 percentage points in a single year, erasing the gains of \nthe 3 previous years (Table 4 and Figure 7).

Considerably  Weaker  Economic  Performance  Overall.  The  crisis  has  weakened \nArmenia's economic performance. The severity of the external shocks has derailed Armenia\u2019s \nefforts to meet the revenue and deficit targets set under the Poverty Reduction and Growth \nFacility (PRGF) approved by the IMF in November 2008. In January 2009, the Government and \nIMF agreed to cancel the PRGF and replace it with a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).

GOVERNMENT\u2019S RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS \n15.  Government\u2019s Policy Framework to Respond to the Crisis. In response to the crisis, \nthe  Government  set  up  an  interministerial  crisis  management  committee  under  the  Prime \nMinister to mitigate its impacts at various levels. The Government\u2019s policy framework is outlined \nbelow. This includes the IMF SBA, which replaced the PRGF and contains the Government\u2019s \nmacroeconomic framework for crisis mitigation. Under the SBA, the Government has committed \nto a range of critical reforms in monetary, exchange rate, and fiscal policies.  \n \n16.  Government\u2019s Policy Response to the Crisis \n \n\u2022  Return to a Flexible Exchange Rate Regime. As the global financial crisis \ndeepened in October 2008, the Government felt it had to intervene in exchange \nrate  policy  to  prevent  a  crisis  of  confidence  from  destabilizing  the  financial \nsystem.  However,  the  maintenance  of  a  soft  peg  led  to  a  large  loss  of \ninternational reserves and significant redollarization without dousing expectations \nof a depreciation of the dram. The Central Bank of Armenia moved to a flexible \nexchange rate in March 2009. \n \n\u2022  Increase in Deposit Guarantee Fund Coverage. The authorities are working on \na plan to increase the resources of the Deposit Guarantee Fund. \n \n\u2022  Support for Macroeconomic Stability. The Government will limit the overall \nfiscal deficit in 2009 to around 6.5% of GDP, excluding unprogrammed externally \nfinanced  investment  projects.  The  revenue  shortfall  will  be  offset  in  part  by \nrestrained spending and some tax policy measures. \n \n\u2022  Restrictions on Non-priority Expenditure and Protection for Social Outlays. \nThe  Government  will  suspend  expenditures  in  nonessential  areas  (travel, \nrepresentation) and in areas where execution has been slow. At the same time, \nsocial spending on social protection programs will be protected and increased by \n0.3% of GDP. The Government has also increased the amount of pensions and \nunemployment insurance. \n \n\u2022  Countercyclical  Public  Investments.  The  Government  will  initiate  public \ninvestment projects to protect and create jobs from additional resources that \nwould become available from external donors and partners on top of what is \ncurrently projected by the IMF (see Tables 5 and 8). \n \n\u2022  Tax Administration. Tax administration has been restructured and reorganized \non a functional basis through the merger of four specialist inspectorates into a \nsingle large taxpayer inspectorate, and the closure of 11 tax inspectorates (in \nFebruary  2009).  These  measures  will  generate  savings  and  enhance \ncost-effectiveness, while securing a sustainable revenue base for effective post-\ncrisis recovery. \n \n\u2022  Creation of the State Revenue Committee to Generate Efficiency. The State \nCustoms Service has been merged with the State Tax Service and a new entity, \nthe State Revenue Committee, has been set up. These moves will help improve ", "  9\ninformation  sharing  and  administrative  support  functions  such  as  human \nresources and information technology. \n \n17.  Anti-Crisis Action Plan. The interministerial crisis management committee approved a \ncomprehensive anti-crisis action plan (Table 5) in early December 2008. The plan includes \nmeasures to protect and create jobs by accelerating existing and planned new public investment \nprograms, and providing direct support (e.g., to small and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs]) \nand indirect support (e.g., partnerships between the public and private sectors and improved \nbusiness climate) to the private sector.5 \n \nTable 5: Highlights of the Government\u2019s Anti-Crisis Action Plan \n \nMeasure  Time Frame \nTo Address Social and Economic Problems and Job Creation   \nConstruction of dwellings totaling $250 million in the earthquake disaster  2009\u20132010 \nzone \nConstruction of additional school buildings  2009 \nImplementation of new agricultural investment programs in partnership with  2009 \nthe private sector \nPreparation of feasibility plan for construction of Meghri\u2013Batumi highway  2009 \n(North\u2013South Corridor), using resources from ADB  \nImplementation of new energy-related projects of regional importance  2009\u20132014 \nTo Support a Healthy Business Environment   \nProvision of government guarantees for loans to SMEs  2009 \nState participation in the capital of enterprises meeting specified criteria  2009 \nDrafting of amendments to competition law to improve competition among  2009 \neconomic enterprises \nTo Make Doing Business in Armenia More Attractive   \nEstablishment of an innovation commission and provision of support for the  2008\u20132009 \ndevelopment of business plans \nStreamlining of tax administration  2009\u20132010 \nEstablishment of free economic zones at Zvartnots and Gyumri airports  2009 \nImplementation of rural development programs, including infrastructure,  2008\u20132009 \nrehabilitation and development, and public and private sector partnerships, \nwith resources from World Bank, EBRD, and ADB \nPan-Armenian Programs in Partnership with the Private Sector   \nConstruction of new nuclear power plant   2009\u20132017 \nPreparation of action plan for construction of Iran\u2013Armenia railroad  2009 \nCreation of a pan-Armenian bank  2008\u20132009 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource: Government of Armenia. \n \n18.  Suspension  of  Non-critical  Expenditures.  In  March  2009,  the  Government \nsuspended6  AMD93  billion7  ($244  million)  in  non-critical  expenditures,  or  10%  of  the \n                                                 \n5 To respond to the social dimensions of the crisis, the Government announced a separate action plan for the social \nsectors in April 2009. The aim is to prevent and mitigate the adverse social impact of the crisis. It also focuses on \ndevelopment of social protection programs to assist in post-conflict recovery.  \n6  Suspended expenditures were deferred to the fourth quarter of the year, at which time the Government will decide \nwhether  to  make  them  or  to  seek  Parliamentary  approval  to  cancel  (\u201csequester\u201d)  them.  Many  suspended \nexpenditures  were for the  purchase of equipment (vehicles, computers) and other indirect costs (furniture, \ntransport). The Government also suspended capital projects that were planned for 2009 but had not yet begun. In \naddition, most large multiyear construction projects that were under way but would not be completed in 2009 were \nalso suspended.  \n7  In May, the amount of suspensions was reduced to AMD50 billion on the strength of an expected increase in \nresources from the IMF. \n ", "10  \nexpenditures in the 2009 budget. However, the Government announced that no cuts would be \nmade in pensions8 ($470 million), wages ($162 million), or social benefits ($169 million), which \ntogether constitute 32% of the budget expenditure. The critical social benefits to be maintained \nare  (i)  the family  allowance  for  poor  families; (ii)  the  unemployment  allowance for  eligible \nunemployed persons; and (iii) the paid public works program, which provides temporary jobs to \nthe unemployed. Details on these benefit programs are given in Appendix 3. Moreover, the \nGovernment  pledged  to  increase  social  protection  expenditures  by  0.3%  of  GDP.  These \ndecisions reflected the Government\u2019s goal of preserving the gains in poverty reduction that have \nbeen achieved since 2000 (see Table 4, Figure 7).9 \n  \n19.  Revised Financing Gap and Financing Plan of the Government. Taking into account \nboth the suspension of non-critical expenditures and the introduction of new expenditures under \nthe anti-crisis action plan, the Government now projects a financing gap of $460 million and a \nbudget deficit of 6.5% of GDP. The Government has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to participate with other development partners in filling this financing gap (Table 6). \n \nTable 6: Adjusted 2009 Budget and Resources to Fill Financing Gap \n \n  AMD  USD \nItem  billion  million \nRevenues (6.7% decrease from 2008)    682  1,771 \nBudgeted Expenditures    919  2,387 \n     Less:  Suspensions    (50)  (130) \n     Plus:  Additional Expenditures    30  78 \nNet Expenditures    899  2,335 \nDeficit    217  564 \n     as % of GDP (9.5% GDP decrease from 2008)    6.5%  6.5% \nLess:  Adjustments (Table 3,  net)    (40)  (104) \nFinancing Gap    177  460 \n       \nFinancing Plan       \nAsian Development Bank      80 \nInternational Monetary Fund        155 \nRussian Federation      150 \nWorld Bank      60 \n     Total Committed Financing        445 \nNet Financing Gap      15 \n(  ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: $1 = 385 AMD. \nSource:  Ministry of Finance, Government of Armenia. \n \n20.  International Donor Support. As part of its anti-crisis action plan, the Government has \nsuccessfully sought the assistance of international development partners, as well as bilateral \nassistance. First, it entered into a $544 million SBA with the IMF under which the Government \nwould  take  measures to  ensure monetary  and  fiscal stabilization  (Appendix  4).  Second, it \n                                                 \n8  Information on the Armenian pension system is contained in Appendix 3.  \n9  According to the World Bank, the current crisis could push 172,000 more people below the poverty line in 2009\u2013\n2010, increasing the total number of the poor to about 906,000 (30.5% of the population), of which 297,000 will be \nclassified as extreme poor (World Bank. 2008. Implications of the Global Economic Crisis for Poverty in Armenia. \nWashington, DC). \u201cPoverty simulations show that for every percentage point reduction in the GDP growth rate, \nnational poverty incidence increases by 0.6 percentage points.\u201d (World Bank. 2009.

Washington, DC, p. 8). \n ", " 11\nnegotiated a $60 million budget support loan (development policy credit) from the World Bank, \nwhich is expected to be available later this year.10 Third, it negotiated a $500 million loan from \nthe Russian Federation; $150 million is expected to be front-loaded and used in 2009. Fourth, it \nhas obtained preliminary approval for an additional $250 million loan from the IMF, $155 million \nof this expected to be available as budget support in 2009. Fifth, the Government has requested \nan  $80  million  budget  support  loan  from  ADB.  Support  for  Armenia  from  international \ndevelopment partners is summarized in Appendix 5, while the financing arrangement for the \nanti-crisis action plan is shown in Tables 6 and 8.  \n \n21.  Debt Sustainability Assessment. In connection with the SBA, the IMF completed a \ndebt sustainability assessment of Armenia in March 2009. This assessment concluded that \nArmenia does not face any significant risk of debt distress. All its external debt indicators are \nwell  below  appropriate  thresholds,  even  if  the  new  $500  million  loan  from  the  Russian \nFederation is factored in.  \n \n22.  Debt Structure. Armenia\u2019s external debt stock as of the end of 2008 was $2.2 billion \n(18% of GDP), mostly representing public and publicly guaranteed debt owed to multilateral \norganizations.  Outstanding debts owed to the World Bank account for 55% of total external \ndebt stock, and those owed to the IMF account for 6%. Armenia\u2019s estimated private sector \nexternal debt outstanding is about 15% of total external debt. The assessment concluded that \nthe share of domestic debt in the stock of public and publicly guaranteed debt was small, at \n2.3% of GDP, reflecting the limited development of the domestic debt markets. \n \n23.  Debt Outlook. IMF\u2019s analysis shows that Armenia\u2019s debt outlook is relatively stable, \nthough authorities have been encouraged to follow a prudent borrowing strategy, given the \nincreasing external vulnerabilities. The baseline scenario shows a sustainable fiscal position, \nwith the net present value of public sector debt gradually rising from 9.8% of GDP in 2008 to \n23.6% of GDP in 2028.  The external debt outlook remains benign, despite a notable increase in \nnon-concessional financing over the medium term because of the crisis. The net present value \nof external debt is expected to increase from 7% of GDP in 2008 to 16% of GDP in 2013, and to \ndecline thereafter to about 7% in 2028.  External debt service will increase from 3% of exports \nto 11% over the medium term, but decline relatively quickly to a long-term average of about 3%. \nV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcomes \n24.  The Program is intended to accelerate Armenia\u2019s recovery from the adverse impact of \nthe global financial crisis. Its proceeds will be used to support essential public expenditures to \n                                                 \n10  In 2009, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development plans to assign \u20ac80 million to Armenia \n(compared with \u20ac63 million in 2008). The European Commission released \u20ac3 million in budget support to Armenia \nfrom the Food Security Programme. The World Bank has also accelerated the approval and financing of certain \nprojects that were already in the pipeline. These projects include a $50 million credit line for the SME sector, a \n$25 million rural road building project, and $10 million in additional funding for small-scale infrastructure and rural \nenterprise projects. \n \n ", "12  \nrevive the economy, and to protect poor and vulnerable groups through adequate safety net \nmeasures. The Program is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy for Armenia.11  \nB.  Outputs \n25.  The Program will have the following main outputs: \n \n(i)  an increase in social protection expenditures, 12 \n(ii)  new jobs created through public investment programs,13 and \n(iii)  no salary or pension arrears.14 \nC.  Proposed Framework for the Program \n26.  Program-Based  Modality.  The  Program  has  two  anchors.  First,  the  IMF  SBA  will \nprovide the overall macroeconomic framework. Second, the Government\u2019s own anti-crisis plan \n(Table 4) will act as the public expenditure anchor. All the structural benchmarks for the IMF \nprogram will automatically be prior actions for ADB\u2019s support. In addition, the Government\u2019s \nfiscal stimulus and social protection measures will need to be maintained. The Program follows \nADB\u2019s Program Lending Policy, which allows the use of program-based approaches. Given the \nurgent need for fiscal support, the Program will not impose any other policy conditionalities of its \nown. The Government has articulated its anti-crisis efforts in the policy letter addressed to ADB     \n(Appendix 6). The program framework is presented in Table 7.  \n \nTable 7: Program Framework\u2014Prior Actions for the ADB Programa \n \nPrior Actions   Time Frame \nADB Program\u2019s Anchor: IMF SBA    \nPurpose: Ensuring Macroeconomic Stability \n\u2022  Return to flexible exchange rate regime  March 2009 \n\u2022  Approval of a plan to increase the resources of Deposit Guarantee Fund  June 2009 \nCountercyclical Fiscal Stimulus Measures Adopted b   \n\u2022  Low-priority expenditures suspended  March 2009 \n\u2022  Crisis recovery support measures unveiled and implementation begun  Since December 2008 \nSocial Safety Nets Maintained   \n\u2022  Basic pensions and unemployment insurance amounts enhanced   January 2009 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IMF = International Monetary Fund, SBA = Stand-By Arrangement. \na See section VII (Assurances) for other commitments agreed on with the Government regarding the Program.  \nb Details of countercyclical measures are given in Table 5. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates, based on discussions with the Government of Armenia and the IMF \noffice in Armenia. \n                                                 \n11 ADB operations in Armenia began in 2005. The Economic Report and Interim Operational Strategy for 2006\u20132009 \nfor Armenia was approved in August 2006. The initial strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s partnership with Armenia were \nacceleration of rural development, promotion of the private sector, and enhancement of regional cooperation.  \n12  The Government has a social protection system with many components, including family benefits for eligible \ncitizens, to reduce extreme poverty and inequality, especially in small and medium cities and rural areas of \nArmenia,  where poverty is highest. The unemployment program is centered on: (i) unemployment benefits, \n(ii) professional training, (iii) financial support for entrepreneurial activities, (iv) compensation for material expenses \nin relocation, (v) organization of paid public works, and (vi) partial wage compensation to employers for hiring \nnoncompetitive persons in the labor market. \n13  This would be achieved through countercyclical public expenditure programs as well as through direct support \n(partnership between the public and private sectors, and SME support) and indirect support (improved business \nenvironment) for the private sector. \n14  The Government has given assurances that it will not reduce critical expenditures\u2014wages ($162 million) and \npensions and social allowances ($640 million)\u2014which together constitute 32% of the budget. ", " 13\nD.  Special Features \n27.   Use of the International Monetary Fund Stand-By Arrangement as Overall Anchor. \nThe SBA approved by the IMF (Appendix 4) provides the macroeconomic foundation for the \nProgram. The Program is part of a concerted effort among donors to support the Government\u2019s \ncrisis  mitigation  efforts.  To  meet  the  balance-of-payments  needs  arising  from  the  crisis, \n$240 million from the IMF SBA has already been disbursed to Armenia.  \n \n28.  Use of Program-Based Approach and Full Alignment with the Government\u2019s Own \nCrisis Mitigation Plan. The Program was prepared in response to the Government\u2019s urgent \nrequest for countercyclical fiscal support. It is fully in line with the Government\u2019s own crisis \nmitigation plan and is an integral part of the financing plan. \n \n29.   Support for Fiscal Stimulus. The Program was prepared at the Government\u2019s urgent \nrequest for support to cushion the severe impact of the crisis. It will provide budget support to \nenable  the  Government  to  meet  critical  expenditure  needs  expediently.  The  ADB  team \nconsidered various factors before proposing the public expenditure support option. \n \n(i)  First, regardless of the lending modality, the country needs resources to adopt \nfiscal  stimulus  measures.  Within  ADB\u2019s  modality  of  program  lending,  the \nfinancing support needs to be linked as closely as possible with the reforms that \nare supported. In Armenia, much like in many other countries, the shocks are \nexogenous, and their impact has been quite severe despite the commendable \nstructural reforms that Armenia has implemented over the last 5\u20137 years. As \nsuch, it is difficult to formulate policy measures that deal directly with the crisis \nand that require funds for implementation. Restoring fiscal and financial sector \nstability is one key reform area that is supported under the IMF SBA. \n \n(ii)  Second, at a time of crisis, the Government\u2019s efforts are focused on mitigation \nand social protection. While commitment to policy and institutional reforms may \nnot completely wane, human resources are likely to be stretched. Moreover, it is \ndesirable that the transaction costs of any support provided by donors be kept as \nsmall as possible. In this regard, the team considered several other possible \nreform  areas,  including  pension  reform,  regional  development,  and  public \nfinancial management reforms. These, however, are medium-term efforts, which \nwould need significant resources and time for satisfactory execution.  \n \n(iii)  Third,  ADB  should  add  value  through  its  support.  The  proposed  public \nexpenditure  option  helps  in  that  direction.  It  will  help  reinforce  measures  to \naccelerate macroeconomic recovery. \nE.  Financing Plan and Use of Program Funds \n30.  Financing  Plan.  The  Government  faces  a  budgetary  financing  gap  of  $460 million \n(Table 6).15 The proposed Program will comprise two loans totaling $80 million equivalent. The \nfirst loan will be of $46.3 million equivalent, financed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with \nan annual interest rate of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; a term of 24 years \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and other terms and conditions substantially in accordance \n                                                 \n15 This does not include the balance-of-payments support needed to shore up the currency and the foreign exchange \nresource position. The IMF SBA is responding to that need. \n ", "14  \nwith those set forth in the loan agreement. The second loan of $33.7 million equivalent will also \nbe financed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an annual interest rate of 1.6% during \nthe entire term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and other terms and conditions \nas set forth in the loan agreement. The overall support was split into two loans with different \nterms because of the availability of ADF funds for Armenia (and other countries). Funds from \nIMF, the World Bank, and the Russian Federation will also be used to fill the financing gap \n(Table 8). \n \nTable 8: Armenia Crisis Recovery: Government's Financing Arrangements \n \n      Amount \n      for 2009 \nType of Support  Institution  Areas of Focus  (million)  \nBalance of Payments       \n  IMF  Macroeconomic Stability   $350.0a \nQuick-Disbursing Support     \n  IMF  Multiple  $155.0 \n  Russian Federation  Anti-Crisis Action Plan  $150.0 \n  World Bank  Competitiveness, vulnerability  $60.0 \n  ADBb  Maintenance of core public  $80.0 \nexpenditures, social protection \nCrisis-Related Project Support     \n  EBRD  SME and Project Support  \u20ac80.0c \n  World Bank  Lifeline Road Improvement Project  $25.0 \n    Social Investment Fund III  $8.0 \n    Rural Enterprise and Small-scale  $2.0 \nCommercial Agriculture Development \n    SME Sector Loan  $50.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IMF = \nInternational Monetary Fund, SME = small- and medium-sized enterprise. \na The International Monetary Fund disbursed $240 million immediately upon approval, and another about \n$110 million will be disbursed before the end of 2009 subject to satisfactory progress of the Stand-By \nArrangement. \nb  In addition to this, ADB will provide project support as part of the normal country program for Armenia. \nc  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development plans to increase its assistance to Armenia to \u20ac180 \nmillion over 2009\u20132010 (compared to \u20ac63 million in 2008).

The proceeds of the loans will be used to \npay for items procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the negative \nlist of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed from other bilateral and multilateral \nsources. The proceeds of the loans will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s simplification of \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans.16  Loan  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the Government stipulating that the \nvalue of the total imports of Armenia, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible \nimports, and imports financed under other official development assistance, is at least equal to \nthe amount of the loans expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the \nright to audit the use of loan proceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n32.  Use of Program Funds. The proceeds of the loans will be disbursed as a single tranche \nand will be used to meet needs under two categories: (i) partial compensation for the large \nrevenue shortfall, to enable the Government to maintain its core public expenditure program; \nand (ii) public investments for job creation.

Implementation Arrangements \n33.  Program Management. The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency of the \nProgram  while  the  Ministry  of  Economy  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  responsible  for \nmonitoring the implementation of the Program outcome, outputs and targets. \n \n34.  Implementation Period. The funds provided under the Program will be used within \n2009. Financial closure is expected in June 2010. \nG.  Anticorruption, Accounting and Auditing, and Key Fiduciary Aspects \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nallegations of corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \napplicable loan regulations.  \n \n36.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  ADB,  consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or \nthrough its agents, any possible financial or management impropriety in the conduct of the \nProgram. The Government will cooperate fully and ensure that each of its agencies cooperates \nwith any such investigation and extends all necessary assistance, including access to relevant \nbooks and records. \n \n37.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of counterpart funds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe Government\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government \nwill open a deposit account at the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) to receive all loan proceeds. \nThe account will be managed, operated, and liquidated according to terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n38.  The 2008 Public Financial Management Performance Measurement (PFMPM)17 noted \nthat, while public resource management in Armenia has improved significantly over the years, \nthere are still weak areas. The PFMPM report gave 23 As and Bs, and 8 Cs and Ds, for the 31 \nindicators.  The  report  on  ADB\u2019s  governance  and  institutional  corruption  risk  assessment \n(GICRA)18 of Armenia in 2008 noted that Armenia needs to strengthen its internal controls and \naudit,  as  well  as  its  procurement  and  anticorruption  systems  (Appendix 8).  Armenia  is \nundertaking  a  number  of  reforms  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  its  public \nfinancial management. The Government is improving internal audit and procurement systems \nwith assistance from ADB and the World Bank, in line with the recommendations of the GICRA. \nAn overall public sector modernization program is also being implemented by the Government \nwith the assistance of the World Bank. \n \n                                                 \n17  Conducted by the Government of Armenia in 2008 with the assistance of the World Bank and ADB, using the \npublic  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  methodology.

Manila. \n ", "16  \n39.  Given the financial management risks involved in the provision of budget support, and \nthe specific risks identified by the PFMPM and the GICRA, the Program will mitigate the risks by \ndirecting its efforts at the following:19 \n \n(i)  Monitoring  of  budget  execution  in  general,  and  monitoring  of  expenditures \nsupported by the Program, specifically: \n \n(a)  Budget  execution  reports,  which  should  properly  account  for  the \nanti-crisis programs of the Government.20  \n(b)  Expenditures  in  key  programs  for  social  protection  (pension,  family \nbenefits, and unemployment insurance). The social impact assessment \ncomponent will be part of the monitoring exercise to help in determining \nthe impact of the Program on the poor and to assist the Government in \ndesigning remedial measures.21  \n(c)  Financial flows and bank accounts related to regular and special safety \nnet programs. The regular social protection programs of MOLSI and other \ncrisis-related  implementation  arrangements  (e.g.,  for  the  employment \nprogram) will come under this category. The purpose is to ensure, among \nother things, the timely delivery of stimulus support.  \n \n(ii)  Expenditure  reconciliation,  to  produce  account  reconciliation  reports  for \nexpenditures supported by the Program. \n \n(iii)  Compliance with international best-practice standards for internal controls and \naudits, to prevent corruption related to expenditures supported by the Program.22 \n \n(iv)  Monitoring of procurement or contracting of services related to expenditure areas \nsupported by the Program.  \n \n(v)  Establishment  of  a  complaints  mechanism  for  beneficiary  selection  and \nprocurement undertaken for expenditures supported by the Program. \nH.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n40.  ADB will create, with the help of the Government, through the Ministry of Economy, a \nmonitoring and performance evaluation system, which would use the existing processes of the \nGovernment for monitoring and evaluating the anti-crisis action plan. This system will provide \nsupport in meeting the requirements of the design and monitoring framework of the Program. It \nwill be set up soon after the Program takes effect. ADB will also work with IMF, the World Bank, \nand other development partners in monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Program. \nThe Program will use very specific and measurable targets and indicators to facilitate objective \nassessments of program outputs, outcomes, and impact. \n                                                 \n19  This will be done through a regional technical assistance (RETA) project, which is being processed. With \ncrisis-support programs being planned in Armenia, Georgia, and Tajikistan, the RETA project would help in public \nexpenditure monitoring across the region.  \n20 A financial management specialist will be hired to work closely with the Government in executing its crisis budget \neffectively. ADB\u2019s support will be closely coordinated with World Bank support. \n21 Feedback from a sample of the beneficiaries of the social protection programs will also be obtained as part of the \nsocial impact analysis. \n22 This covers a key risk identified by the assessments. ", " 17\nVI.  BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n41.  The Program will help the Government reduce poverty incidence and restore growth to \nits pre-crisis trajectory. It will further support the Government\u2019s initiatives to ensure that the poor \nand vulnerable groups, who may be hit hardest by the crisis, are shielded from its adverse \nimpact. It will help the Government protect and create jobs while maintaining effective social \nprotection safety nets. It is anchored in the IMF SBA and thereby supports the Government\u2019s \nmacroeconomic stabilization and expenditure management plan.  \n \n42.  The Program will provide specific benefits to stimulate aggregate demand. It will enable \nthe Government to \n \n(i)  maintain its core public expenditure program without any cuts, over and above \nadjustments already made; \n(ii)  meet social safety net spending needs; and \n(iii)  create at least 6,500 new jobs by the end of 2009. \n \n43.  Risks. There are two main risks. First, a worsening of the global financial crisis\u2014or its \ncontinuation for a period longer than anticipated\u2014could hinder the Government\u2019s economic \nrecovery plans. As the proposed Program is within the overall IMF framework, any such adverse \nchanges  in  the  external  economic  circumstances  need  to  be  mitigated  through  corrective \neconomic policies as well as external support. ADB will coordinate closely with the IMF and \nother development partners in responding to any such shocks. Second, any changes in the \npolitical situation may weaken the Government\u2019s ability to implement anti-crisis measures. While \nthis risk is outside of ADB\u2019s control, it is unlikely that any such changes will alter the substance \nand thrust of the anti-crisis plan per se.  \n \n44.  Assumptions. It is assumed that all partners will provide timely and adequate budget \nsupport and technical assistance. As the Program is anchored on the IMF SBA, it is assumed \nthat all the prior actions and structural benchmarks under the SBA will remain. Further, it is also \nassumed that all the Government\u2019s own expenditure projects, as well as those supported by \ndevelopment partners, will be executed in a timely manner. \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n45.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the loan agreement:  \n \n(i)  The Government will work with ADB to monitor results, track aid, and assess the \nimpact of this support. \n(ii)  The Government will update ADB on the implementation of the various anti-crisis \nprograms and will ensure that necessary support is provided to ADB to review \nand  monitor  the  status  of  key  indicators  under  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework.  \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds are used for financing its \nimmediate budgetary expenditures to sustain delivery of the Government\u2019s core \npublicly funded program, in compliance with its public financial management \nprocedures and reporting arrangements, and that such proceeds are not used to \n ", "18  \nfinance ineligible items as set forth in Appendix 7, and shall provide a certificate \nto ADB to this effect. \n(iv)  The  Government  will  furnish  to  ADB  a  certified  copy  of  the  state  budget \nexecution reports for 2009, as submitted to the Parliament, by 30 June 2010, with \na  certified  English  translation  of  the  relevant  parts,  as  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. The Government will furnish to ADB a certified copy of \nthe opinion of the Chamber of Control on such reports by 30 November 2010, \nwith a certified English translation of the relevant parts, as agreed between the \nGovernment and ADB. \n(v)  The Government will provide ADB with a certified copy, in the English language, \nof  the  externally  audited  annual  report  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Armenia  in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for the fiscal year \n2009 by 30 June 2010. \n(vi)  The Government will share with ADB the reports of review missions for IMF SBA \nand the World Bank Development Policy Loan. \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n46.    I am satisfied that the proposed Program loans would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 29,735,000 \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter, and a term of 24 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years; and \n(ii)   the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 21,643,000 \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.6% per annum during the grace period \nand for each interest period thereafter, and a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, \n \nboth to the Republic of Armenia for the Crisis Recovery Support Program from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n \n15 June 2009 ", "    Appendix 1  19\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Risk \nArmenia\u2019s recovery  Gradual restoration of  Official government  The global recession is \nfrom the global financial  real GDP growth, back to  statistics (Armenia\u2019s  protracted. \ncrisis is accelerated,  2007 level, by 2013\u20132014  National Statistics Service)   \nand the social and      Assumption \neconomic impact is  By 2013, poverty  Research reports from  The Government continues to \nmitigated  headcount to be 25%  development agencies  be committed to, and \n  (2007: 25%)     implements, appropriate \nOther reports from  macroeconomic stabilization, \ndevelopment partners  fiscal, and structural reforms. \n \nReports from ADB, IMF, \nand World Bank missions \nOutcome      Assumptions \nGovernment  adopts  Budget execution for  Ministry of Finance  Development partners \ncountercyclical  fiscal  program-supported  (quarterly reports on  provide timely and adequate \nmeasures  expenditures in line with  revenues and  budget support and technical \n  fiscal measures  expenditures)  assistance. \n     \nReports on quarterly  IMF SBA remains on track. \nreview of expenditures    \n  Government is able to \nReports from MOLSI  develop and initiate \n  anti-crisis programs \nReports from ADB, IMF,  promptly. \nand World Bank missions \nRisks \nFiscal situation of the \nGovernment worsens, \nnecessitating further cuts in \nexpenditures. \nOutput      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government\u2019s long-term vision is presented in detail in the Sustainable Development Program (SDP). Approved in \nOctober 2008, SDP is Armenia\u2019s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II) and has three key goals covering \nthe period 2009\u20132021 (with specific medium-term targets for 2009\u20132015): (i) reducing poverty and eliminating extreme \npoverty; (ii) ensuring human development; and (iii) deepening economic growth and accelerating the development of \nlagging regions.  \nThe SDP builds on the considerable achievements of PRSP I. Armenia\u2019s poverty and extreme poverty rates declined in \n2006 to 26.5% and 4.1% of the population, respectively (from 34.6% and 6.4%, respectively, in 2004). Inequality also \ndecreased to a rate below the PRSP I goal. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies were instrumental in maintaining \nmacroeconomic stability and contributing to poverty reduction. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 13.1% per \nyear on average over the period 2003\u20132007, and inflation averaged 3.9% during the same period,  while social \nexpenditures increased to 4.7% of GDP, well above the projected PRSP I goal of 3.0%. Increased resources to the social \nsectors improved the access to and quality of general secondary education, and have led to improvements in overall \nutilization of and geographic access to basic health services, most notably through the free provision of primary health \ncare to the population. \nHowever, economic diversification has been limited, with growth performance narrowly based on remittances and \nconstruction. Export performance has been disappointing, with real growth of less than 2% per annum in 2004\u20132007. The \nrevenue-to-GDP ratio grew to a less-than-targeted 14.5% by 2006, reflecting limited progress in reforming revenue \nadministration, whereas total public spending decreased by 0.7% of GDP in 2003\u20132007. \nThe  SDP  shows  that  Armenia  plans  to  continue  its  impressive  gains  in  combating  poverty  and  inequality.  The \nGovernment\u2019s anticipation of good progress, predicated on double-digit economic growth, the increase of labor income, \nprivate transfers from abroad, pensions, and the increase in social transfers through a well-targeted social protection \nprogram, has become uncertain because of the sudden and severe nature of the financial crisis. \nThe SDP presents an extensive and in-depth coverage of the macroeconomic framework and of macroeconomic policies. \nProjections that were fully in line with the 2009 annual budget and the medium-term expenditure framework are now in \ndoubt, following a reduction in revenues and a deceleration of the economy.  \nIn the health sector, the SDP increased access to and quality of health-care services, and over the medium term, further \ndevelopment  of  the  primary  health-care  system  will  remain  among  the  key  priorities  in  order  to  complete  the \ntransformation to a more efficient, family medicine\u2013based system. In education, public expenditure is projected to reach \n4.5% of GDP by 2021, as the Government is committed to improving the quality and accessibility of school education. \nSome of these interventions may have to be postponed to allow for a review of the budget. \nPerhaps the most significant new policy in the SDP is the considerable real increase in state pensions. This reflects the \nobjective of providing minimum income security against poverty in old age, and the introduction of a mandatory funded \npension pillar in 2010.a  \nThe Country Operations Business Plan 2008\u20132010 envisages support to enhance government effectiveness and help the \nGovernment implement its innovative governance reforms program. It also flags the need to provide resources for the \nimplementation of the SDP of the Government.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key Issues  \n \nThe Government of Armenia (the Government) has requested support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help \nmitigate the social and economic impact of the global financial crisis. After many years of strong economic performance \npredicated largely on first-generation reformsb (e.g., privatization), Armenia\u2019s real GDP declined by 9.7% in the first  \n4 months of 2009 and is forecast to decline by around 9.5% in 2009. Remittances, which at $1.5 billion accounted for \n ", "22   Appendix 2 \n13% of GDP in 2008, are expected to decline by around 30% in 2009. The Armenian dram (AMD) has depreciated 25% \nagainst the US dollar and 70% of the economy is dollarized. The Government faces a revenue decline of up to 38%, \nwhile expenditure may go down by 27% with an estimated financing gap of about $460 million. The fiscal deficit is \nestimated to increase from AMD40 billion (1.0% of GDP), forecast in the 2009 budget, to 6.5% of GDP. Unemployment \nhas been increasing, and the crisis could wipe out the gains made by Armenia in reducing its poverty incidence from \n55.1% to 22.7% between 1999 and 2008. \nThe Crisis Recovery Support Program will enable the Government to respond swiftly to mitigate the adverse impact of the \nglobal financial crisis. The Program will help the Government devise projects aimed at creating and protecting jobs. It \nwould allow for the continuation and expansion of safety net programs to cushion and mitigate the adverse impact of the \ncrisis. The Program will benefit the poor and support efforts to ensure that gains made by the Government in reducing \npoverty are protected. \n2. Design Features \n \nThe Program is anchored on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Stand-By Arrangement (IMF SBA), which provides the \noverall framework for macroeconomic stability and structural reform. The Program has been formulated in close \nconsultation with the Government and after an assessment of the impact of the crisis and fiscal needs. It is part of a \nwell-coordinated and concerted donor effort to respond to the Government\u2019s urgent request for budget support.  \n \nThe Program will, in coordination with other international development partners, work with the Government on a \nmacroeconomic stabilization and expenditure management plan, and on the restoration  of economic growth  and \ndevelopment to pre-crisis levels. \n \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nThe Program will assist the Government in mitigating the impact of the global financial crisis through macroeconomic \nstabilization, and poverty and unemployment reduction measures. It will help to increase social protection expenditures, \nand to protect and create new jobs through public investment programs, especially in poorer regions of Armenia. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe Program has been prepared in response to the Government\u2019s urgent request for assistance. It has been formulated \nafter detailed discussions with the Government, especially the Ministries of Economy, Finance, Labor and Social Issues, \nand Territorial Administration, and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. It has also been discussed extensively with the other \ninternational development partners including the IMF and the World Bank. \n \n2.

However, consultations with stakeholders are being conducted during the preparation of the Program \nand will continue throughout program implementation. \n \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.

The average insurance pension is expected to reach 150% of the minimum \nconsumption basket by 2018, and its ratio to the projected average wage is expected to settle at 30% in the long \nrun. Spending on state pensions is projected to increase from the current 3% of GDP to 5.4% in 2021. The funded \npillar is estimated to generate an additional fiscal burden of 0.2%\u20130.4% of GDP. \nb  GDP increased 6.8% in 2008.

Family Benefits. The Armenian Law on State Benefits grants family benefits to eligible \ncitizens to reduce extreme poverty and inequality, especially in small and medium-sized cities \nand rural areas of Armenia, where poverty is highest. A family\u2019s eligibility for these benefits is \nbased on its vulnerability assessment score. The steady decrease in poverty since 1999 has \ngreatly reduced the number receiving family benefits to 22.1% of families in 2007, versus 67.7% \nin 1999. On the other hand, expenditures for family benefits increased by 150% from 2000 to \n2007, while the average size of the benefit doubled. Data from the 2005 Integrated Household \nSurvey show that family benefits have helped reduce poverty in general, and particularly poverty \namong the extremely poor. In 2006, the average monthly family benefits equaled 38% of the \nfood poverty threshold. The budgetary allocation for family benefits in 2009 is AMD36.57 billion \n($96 million). \n \n3.  Unemployment  Programs.  The  State  Employment  Service  agency  administers  the \nfollowing programs: (i) payment of unemployment allowances, (ii) training for the unemployed, \n(iii) payment of costs related to relocation, (iv) partial compensation to employers for hiring \nuncompetitive unemployed persons, (v) labor market surveys and forecasts, (vi) paid public \nworks, and (vii) organization of vacancy fairs.  \n \n4.  An economically active person seeking work is considered unemployed. To receive \nunemployment allowance, a person must (i) declare that he or she has no agricultural land and \nis not involved in any economic activity, (ii) have made social insurance contributions for at least \n1 year, and (iii) not be a pensioner. The unemployment allowance (now 60% of the minimum \nsalary) is paid for 6 months, plus 1 additional month for every 3 years of prior social insurance \ncontributions, up to a maximum of 12 months. In January 2009, the monthly unemployment \nallowance was increased from AMD15,000 to AMD18,000. \n \n5.  An outlay of AMD4.2 billion ($11 million), 13.8% more than in 2008, has been budgeted \nfor  unemployment  programs  in  2009.  The  crisis  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  the \nunemployment rate to 6.8% in April 2009. The Government estimates an additional requirement \nof AMD0.5 billion\u2013AMD1 billion to operate additional programs for the unemployed in 2009.  \n ", "    Appendix 3  25\n6.  Paid Public Works. Under the paid public works (PPW) program, which was started in \n2004,  communities  (local  governments  in  the  villages)  prepare  proposals  for  small  public \ninfrastructure projects that can be implemented in 3 months or less. These proposals are then \nsubmitted to regional departments (marzpetarans). The marzpetarans and the Ministry of Labor \nand Social Issues (MOLSI) allocate the funds budgeted for PPW on the basis of the social \nconditions in the communities submitting applications, including the number of unemployed and \nthe  number  of  families  registered  for  family  benefits.  To  implement  the  selected  small \ninfrastructure  projects,  the  marzpetarans  hire  registered  unemployed  persons  living  in  the \nrespective  communities  on  temporary  employment  contracts.  The  projects  include \nimprovements  in  roads,  irrigation  schemes,  drinking-water  facilities,  schools,  medical \ninstitutions, kindergartens, and historical and cultural assets. \n \n7.  In  2009,  MOLSI  has  received  applications  for  projects  totaling  AMD1,183  million, \ncompared with the budgeted amount of AMD700 million ($1.8 million). The Government plans to \nexpand the allocation to accommodate more PPW requests. In 2009, the daily wage rate for \npersons hired for temporary employment in the PPW program is expected to be AMD2,400. In \n2008, more than 7,000 temporary jobs were created, with a budget allocation of AMD683 \nmillion. \n \n8.  Pensions. The major structural reforms planned in the pension area are on track. The \ncurrent pension system is a defined-benefit social insurance scheme supported by mandatory \nwage-based  contributions.  A  separate  social  assistance  scheme  financed  from  general \nrevenues provides a guaranteed pension (\u201csocial pension\u201d) to those ineligible for the old-age \npension. The social insurance program, which is administered by the State Social Security \nService (SSSS), pays three basic types of pension benefits: (i) old-age pensions to persons who \nhave  reached  the  age  of  631  and  have  made  payroll  contributions  for  at  least  5  years; \n(ii) disability pensions to those with work-related disabilities, regardless of contribution history, \nand to those with non-work-related disabilities if they have contributed for at least 5 years; and \n(iii) survivor\u2019s pensions for survivors of recipients of old-age pensions. The Government plans to \nreplace the existing system with a multi-pillar system on 1 January 2010. The new system will \nprovide a social safety net for the vulnerable regardless of past contributions (Zero Pillar); a \nbasic pension for those who have contributed, with some differentiation in benefit amounts \nbased on the number of years of contributions (First Pillar); and a funded individual savings \naccount for current workers, which will be invested (Second Pillar). \n                                                 \n1  The old-age pension age is set at 63 for both men and women. However, the pension age for women is being \nincreased gradually from 58 to 63, by 2011. \n ", "26   Appendix 4 \nInternational Monetary Fund Stand-By Arrangement for Armenia1 \n \n1.  Armenia enjoyed a long period of strong economic performance. Prudent policies and \npositive regional spillovers led to rapid gross domestic product (GDP) growth, large capital \ninflows, reduction of government debt as a share of GDP, and low inflation. In November 2008, \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  acknowledging  Armenia's  impressive  performance, \napproved a new low-access Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. \n \n2.  However, over December 2008\u2013February 2009, the scenario changed drastically as the \nglobal  financial  crisis  hit  Armenia  harder  than  envisaged  earlier.  Strong  external  shocks, \nparticularly  emanating  from  Russia,  adversely  affected  the  current  and  capital  accounts. \nRemittances and capital inflows, which had sustained the construction boom in recent years, \ndecelerated markedly. Falling international commodity prices hit mining, a key export sector. \nGDP growth came to a halt in the fourth quarter, and fell to 6.8% for all of 2008, after growing at \n10.5%  from  January  to  September.  Depreciation  pressures  on  the  dram  increased  as \ndollarization took hold. The Government resisted the pressures, concerned that devaluation \nwould  only  make  matters  worse  by  destabilizing  foreign  currency  deposits  and  triggering \nsubstantial deposit withdrawals from the banking system.  \n \n3.  The rapid and unexpected deterioration of the economic situation had a strong impact on \nprogram performance under the PRGF arrangement. As most of the quantitative performance \ncriteria were missed, the PRGF arrangement was canceled. The Government requested the \nIMF for a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) to provide balance-of-payments support. The SBA was \napproved in March 2009 by the Executive Board of the IMF.  \n \n4.  The 28-month SDR368 million (about $544 million) SBA for Armenia is aimed at helping \nthe country adjust to the deteriorated global outlook, restore confidence in the currency and \nfinancial system, and protect the poor. An amount equivalent to SDR161.5 million (about $240 \nmillion) was immediately made available, while the rest will be accessible in nine installments \nsubject  to  quarterly  reviews.  The  IMF  SBA  entails  exceptional  access  to  IMF  resources, \namounting to about 400% of Armenia\u2019s quota.  \n \n5.  The Government\u2019s program under the IMF SBA is based on a consistent set of measures \nregarding exchange rate, monetary, financial, and fiscal policies, as well as continued structural \nreforms. The reforms under IMF SBA involve \n(i)  tackling the economic and financial challenges confronting Armenia; \n(ii)  establishing a high-level committee to monitor developments in the economy and \ncoordinate the policy response of the Government to the ongoing economic \nchallenges; \n(iii)  returning to a flexible exchange rate regime in the immediate future; \n(iv)  strengthening financial stability, as a critical part of the program;  \n(v)  returning to an inflation-targeting framework as market conditions stabilize; \n(vi)  achieving macroeconomic stability, while allowing for continued public investment \nand protection of social services; \n(vii)  restricting non-priority expenditures, while protecting social outlays and allowing \nfor higher investment through foreign financing;  \n(viii)  restricting  spending  financed  from  domestic  sources  and  relying  on  external \nfinancing to fund the increase in capital spending; \n                                                 \n1 IMF. 2009.

RECENT MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK \nFOR 2009\u20132010 \n1.  Armenia is now facing significant challenges following a long period of macroeconomic \nsuccess and stability. Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement \nthat covered the period 2005\u20132008, prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms \ncontributed to double digit gross domestic product (GDP) growth, low inflation, and a significant \nreduction in poverty rates. Despite a widening external current account deficit, international \nreserves continued to increase, owing to large foreign exchange inflows and dedollarization, \nand  external  debt  remained  low.  The  overall  fiscal  deficit  was  contained,  and  additional \nrevenues  arising  from  improvements  in  tax  administration  could  be  used  to  finance \npoverty-reducing expenditures. Government debt remained stable. The monetary framework \nwas strengthened, contributing, with a flexible exchange rate, to maintaining low inflation. \n \n2.  In the first 3 quarters of 2008, growth remained strong, with GDP increasing by 10.4% \nthrough September. Driven by international prices and strong domestic demand, inflation rose to \na high of 11.5% in August, and the current account deficit continued to worsen. In response to \nthese signs of overheating, monetary policy was progressively tightened. \n \n3.  The  economic  outlook  changed  abruptly  as  the  global  financial  crisis  deepened  in \nOctober.  Owing  to  its  relative  international  isolation,  the  financial  sector  was  not  directly \naffected.  However,  the  mining  sector  and  exports  were  severely  hit  by  the  sharp  drop  in \ninternational commodity prices, with many mines stopping operations. In addition, remittances \nand capital inflows slowed considerably, which had a major impact on the construction sector. \nAs a consequence, growth came to a halt, with annual GDP growth falling to 6.8% for the year \nas a whole, and the external current account deficit rising to an estimated 12.6% of GDP. In the \nwake of falling international prices and rapidly slowing domestic demand, inflation fell to 4% in \nJanuary 2009. \n \n4.  Out of concerns for the impact of a crisis in confidence on financial stability, the Central \nBank of Armenia (CBA) intervened repeatedly to stabilize the exchange rate in the last part of \n2008 and in early 2009. With expectations for a depreciation of the dram gaining strength, the \nCBA  faced  strong  pressures,  leading  to  a  rapid  decline  in  international  reserves.  With  a \nsignificant  amount  of  deposits  being  converted  to  foreign  currency,  and  overall  deposits \ndeclining slightly, banks came under pressure to reduce lending. In this context, and in line with \nthe changed inflation outlook, the CBA eased monetary policy, cutting the policy rate from \n7.75% in November 2008 to 6.75% in February 2009. \n \n5.  As a result of the commodity price shock and our attempt to preserve financial stability, \nwe  missed  most  of  the  end-December  targets  under  the  PRGF  arrangement.  Due  to \nunexpectedly large foreign currency sales, both the end-2008 targets for international reserves \nand net domestic assets of the CBA were missed. In addition, the target on net banking system \ncredit to the government, as well as that on the underlying fiscal balance, was also missed. \nOther targets under the program were respected. \n \n ", "36   Appendix 6 \n6.  The short-term economic outlook presents enormous challenges. Difficulties in many \nsectors, including mining and construction, are affecting growth prospects and weakening the \nlabor market. GDP growth in 2009 is projected to fall considerably with respect to 2008, and \nunemployment  is  expected  to  increase.  Depressed  international  commodity  prices,  falling \nremittances, and weaker capital inflows are putting pressure on the balance of payments, \ndespite falling domestic demand. The redollarization of the financial system presents risks for \nfinancial stability and challenges for monetary policy. We are expecting a gradual recovery in \n2010, but this is highly dependent on global economic developments, and downside risks are \nprevalent.  A  strong  policy  response  is  needed  to  restore  confidence,  stop  the  loss  of \ninternational reserves, and maintain macroeconomic stability. \nII.  THE PROGRAM FOR 2009 \n7.  The policies outlined below are designed to tackle the economic and financial challenges \nnow confronting Armenia. These policies, which would form the basis for a new 28-month \nstand-by arrangement from the Fund, are aimed at preserving economic and financial stability, \nwhile mitigating the impact of the global crisis and economic downturn on the poor. Central to \nthis strategy is the return to a flexible exchange rate regime supported by appropriate monetary \npolicies. We are also vigilant to possible distress in the financial sector, and will respond rapidly \nshould more targeted measures be needed. A sound fiscal policy will underpin our commitment \nto macroeconomic stability, while ensuring that growth promoting public investment moves \nforward. In addition, we want to preserve the impressive gains Armenia has made in reducing \npoverty  in  recent  years.  To  this  end,  we  will  ensure  that  the  level  of  social  services  is \nmaintained, and that programs to protect the poor are expanded as needed. We will continue \nour  ambitious  structural  reform  program  aimed  at  strengthening  public  finances,  boosting \nproductivity, and increasing the resilience of the economy. \n \n8.  We will establish a high-level committee to monitor developments in the economy and \ncoordinate the policy response of the authorities to the ongoing economic challenges. This \ncommittee will be chaired by the Prime Minister, and will include representatives from the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Economy, the CBA, and the State Revenue Committee. \nA.  Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies \n9.  We are committed to return to a flexible exchange rate regime in the immediate future. \nSince  the  deepening  of  the  global  financial  crisis  in  October  2008,  intervention  has  been \nnecessary to prevent a crisis of confidence that was threatening the stability of the financial \nsystem. However, we recognize that the maintenance of a soft peg has led to a large loss of \ninternational reserves and significant redollarization without stemming expectations of a dram \ndepreciation. This, in turn, has undermined the credibility of our inflation-targeting framework \nand  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy,  which  we  are  committed  to  restoring.  Since \nOctober 2008,  our  exchange  rate  misalignment  has  increased  significantly,  owing  to  the \nworsening economic outlook and the currency depreciation experienced by many of our trade \npartners. We expect the exchange rate to move to a value in line with its fundamentals when we \nreturn to a floating regime. When normal market functioning is restored, our exchange rate \npolicy will be a managed float with no predetermined path. We are committed to intervening only \nto smooth excessive market volatility and to increase international reserves. \n ", "    Appendix 6  37\n10.  Monetary policy will be geared towards supporting the return to a flexible exchange rate \nregime. As outlined below, we will take any emergency measures necessary to address banks\u2019 \nliquidity shortages in order to avoid any risks of bank runs. The CBA will raise policy interest \nrates at the time we return to a flexible regime. This will support demand for dram-denominated \nassets, fight capital outflows, mitigate any inflationary pressures stemming from depreciation, \nand restore confidence in the financial sector. Throughout this transition period, we will conduct \nan open and transparent communication campaign to explain to the public the reasons behind \nthe depreciation and any additional measures needed to preserve financial stability. \n \n11.  Strengthening financial stability will be a critical part of the program: \n \n\u2022  To  ensure  a  timely  and  consistent  policy  response,  the  CBA  will  prepare  a \ncomprehensive and actionable contingency plan for the financial sector. This \nplan will contain the explicit policy responses to all likely developments, including \nliquidity shortages in the banking sector, with responsibilities of various parties \nclearly defined. The CBA will consult with the government as needed on the \npreparation of this contingency plan. \n \n\u2022  We  recognize  that  the  banking  system  will  be  adversely  affected  by  the \ndepreciation of the dram and will take all appropriate measures to ensure that \nbanks remain able to meet all liabilities as they fall due. The CBA stands ready to \nprovide  liquidity  to  banks  on  a  temporary  basis  in  exchange  for  adequate \ncollateral. The CBA will, on a temporary basis, accept a wider range of collateral, \nincluding pledged fixed assets, bank shares, and high quality bank loans, if \nnecessary. \n \n\u2022  Should circumstances warrant it, the coverage of the Deposit Guarantee Fund \nwill be increased. In addition, the authorities will approve a plan to increase the \nresources  of  the  Deposit  Guarantee  Fund  (performance  criterion  for \nend-June 2009). \n \n\u2022  Bank  supervision  will  be  enhanced  with  more  intensive  on-site  and  off-site \nsurveillance and monitoring. If financial conditions in any banks appear to be \ndeteriorating,  we  will  agree  with  bank  management  and  shareholders  on  a \nrestructuring plan to resolve the difficulties. In the first instance, we would expect \nthe banks\u2019 shareholders to recapitalize the bank to adequate levels. However, we \nwill also set out a framework for using public resources if this approach proves to \nbe inadequate. In exceptional cases, we will provide banks with long-term funds. \nIn order to protect taxpayers\u2019 interests, the banks will issue subordinated debt, \nwith  an  option  to  convert  such  debt  into  bank  equity.  We  will  also  tighten \nprudential standards, particularly regarding foreign currency exposures, and will \nprogressively work to reduce banks\u2019 net open positions. \n \n12.  As market conditions stabilize, we will return to our inflation-targeting framework. In the \nshort  term,  increased  dollarization  will  hamper  the  implementation  of  monetary  policy. \nTherefore,  it  will  be  particularly  important  to  further  strengthen  the  monetary  transmission \nmechanism,  pursue  more  active  liquidity  management,  and  foster  the  development  of  the \nmoney market. To enhance monetary operations and debt management, the MOF and CBA will \nclosely coordinate their liquidity forecasting and MOF debt issuance to take account of both \nbudget  financing  and  liquidity  management  needs.  Furthermore,  the  CBA  will  continue  to \n ", "38   Appendix 6 \nconduct repo operations, and will not go back to issuing its own securities. At the same time, the \ntreasury will maintain its issuance of short-term T-bills, including 3-month and 6-month T-bills, \nconsistent with the recent memorandum of understanding between the CBA and the MOF. The \nCBA also plans to increase its holdings of treasury securities over the medium term in order to \nstrengthen its capacity to conduct reverse repo operations. \nB.  Fiscal Policy \n13.  Fiscal policy will support macroeconomic stability, while allowing for continued public \ninvestment and protection of social services. To this end, we intend to limit the overall fiscal \ndeficit in 2009 to around 3% of GDP, excluding nonprogrammed externally-financed investment \nprojects (see below). The deterioration in the deficit target relative to the 1% of GDP budget \nobjective is due to the fact that revenue is projected to be significantly lower than the projection \nin  the  budget,  reflecting  the  contraction  in  economic  activity,  particularly  the  downturn  in \nrevenue-generating sectors such as mining. As discussed below, the revenue shortfall will be \noffset in part by restrained spending and some tax policy measures. \n \n14.  On spending, we plan to restrict non-priority expenditure, while protecting social outlays \nand allowing for higher investment as foreign financing materializes. To this end, we expect \nsubstantial savings on nonessential spending and areas where execution has been slow. At the \nsame time, we intend to boost spending on social protection programs, and are in discussions \nwith partners, notably the World Bank, on how to strengthen these programs. \n \n15.  Our aim is to restrict spending financed by domestic resources and instead rely on \nexternal financing to fund the increase in capital spending. We expect additional resources to \nbecome available from external donors and partners on top of what is currently projected by the \nIMF. While much of these resources are only partially concessional, they would allow us to \nfinance more public investment projects, and potentially set up credit lines for small and medium \nenterprises.  To  this  end,  we  propose  to  spend  up  to  $200  million  from  those  additional \nresources on public investment in 2009, which would allow us to increase our deficit target \naccordingly. We are committed to maintaining transparency in the use of such resources by \nchanneling any additional spending through the budget. We will also limit the use of government \ncash deposits to finance the budget, as we recognize the need to have a cushion for cash-flow \nmanagement purposes, and possibly for future needs. \n \n16.  We are implementing some changes to tax policy. Given the weak revenue outlook and \nthe difficult conditions facing Armenian firms with respect to trading partners, we plan to raise \ntemporarily customs tariffs for some goods. We recognize the distortionary impact of such a \npolicy, and the negative impact on the poor. However, the changes in tariff rates are within our \ncommitments to the WTO, and will be limited to a certain number of goods for which Armenian \nsubstitutes exist. In terms of revenue impact, we expect this measure to generate an additional \nAMD10 billion in receipts in 2009. In addition, we have recently raised presumptive taxes on \ntobacco products, we plan to raise excise taxes on imported alcoholic beverages, and are \nconsidering raising presumptive taxes on petroleum products. Looking forward, we maintain our \nobjective of abolishing presumptive taxation for tobacco and fuel, and to this end, we will submit \nlegislation to parliament by December 2009 to bring petroleum and tobacco products within the \nregular tax regimes (excise tax, customs duties, profit tax, and value-added tax [VAT]), effective \n1 January 2011. \n \n17.  In 2009, we intend to address two long-standing problems in the tax area: ", "    Appendix 6  39\n \n\u2022  The  large  amount  of  outstanding  tax  credits  (AMD154.4  billion  at \nend-December 2008)  is  associated  with  ad-hoc  collection  practices  in  earlier \nperiods, including requests for advance tax payments. Halting these practices \nand offsetting advance payments  against future tax liabilities will provide an \nimportant  stimulus  during  the  recession.  Therefore,  we  will  not  accumulate \nadditional tax credits during 2009, and, more generally, we are committed to \nanalyzing and fixing the systemic problems underlying these tax credits in the \ncontext of our comprehensive tax administration reform. We have included in the \nprogram a quantitative indicative target on the stock of tax credits. \n \n\u2022  We remain committed to introducing best practices in VAT refund processing to \nexporters by: (i) meeting the statutory 90-day processing deadline for all VAT \nrefund  claims  filed  in  2009,  (ii)  clearing  the  stock  of  late  refund  claims,                        \n(iii)  implementing  risk  management  approaches  (i.e.,  taxpayers  with  good \ncompliance histories to get fast-track refunds, while risky cases face pre-refund \naudits); (iv) implementing a forecasting system to anticipate refund levels so that \nfunds  are  available  to  pay  legitimate  refund  claims  as  they  occur;  and                        \n(v) submitting legislation to parliament to strengthen penalties for false refund \nclaims and pay interest on legitimate late refunds arising from claims filed after \nDecember  2009,  with  interest  to  be  paid  out  of  VAT  revenues  (structural \nbenchmark for December 2009). We have already significantly reduced the stock \nof refund claims and plan to completely eliminate it over the next few months. \nC.  Structural Reforms \n1.  Public Finances \n18.  We remain committed to our ambitious tax administration reform agenda. To this end, \nwe restructured the tax administration organization by adopting a function-based organizational \nstructure, merging the four specialist inspectorates into a single large taxpayer inspectorate, and \nclosing 11 tax inspectorates, all of which became effective in February 2009. We expect these \nchanges to generate savings and enhance cost-effectiveness, while securing a sustainable \nrevenue  base.  Going  forward,  we  intend  to  continue  consolidating  the  regional  tax \ninspectorates. We have also completed the merger of the State Customs Service with the State \nTax Service into a new organization named State Revenue Committee (SRC). The merger is \nexpected to generate efficiency gains through information sharing and administrative support \nfunctions, such as human resources and IT, while the core functions of customs and tax \nadministration will not be integrated. \n \n19.  On other fiscal reforms, we plan to introduce a funded pension pillar on 1 January 2010. \nWe intend to revise our estimates of the costs of this reform, as well as those associated with \nthe planned increase in basic pensions, taking into consideration the weakening economic \nenvironment. Legislation on the new pension system, including on the unification of income tax \nand social contributions, will be submitted to parliament by mid-2009. The SRC will assume the \ntask of collecting and reconciling individual contributions. In the context of the medium term \nexpenditure framework (MTEF), we intend to produce an analytical report on medium-term fiscal \nrisks, including those arising from the introduction of the funded pillar and the costs associated \nwith the planned increase in basic and average pensions over the next few years. To further \nimprove our fiscal framework, we intend to improve the MTEF by including a section on debt \n ", "40   Appendix 6 \nmanagement, which will help align policy decisions over the medium term, with their long-term \nfiscal implications. Finally, we plan to complete the specific part of the unified tax code by \nJune 2009. \n2.  Financial Sector \n20.  We remain committed to the financial sector reforms outlined in the Memorandum of \nEconomic  and  Financial  Policies  underpinning  our  November  2008  PRGF  request.  In  the \ncurrent crisis, our focus is on ensuring financial stability, including through the adoption of the \nmeasures discussed above. Nonetheless, we will continue to implement our reform agenda, \nincluding: \n \n\u2022  Foster the development of commercial banks\u2019 risk management capacity, and \nintegrate an assessment of banks\u2019 risk management systems into the CBA\u2019s \nregular supervisory activity; \n \n\u2022  Enhance credit availability and improve financial intermediation; \n \n\u2022  Launch our campaign to educate consumers about financial terms, products, and \nservices; and \n \n\u2022  Further  develop  the  securities  market  as  laid  out  in  our  capital  market \ndevelopment  action  plan.  To  increase  the  stock  of  government  securities \navailable for open market operations, we will amend Article 11 of the \u201cLaw on the \nCentral Bank of the Republic of Armenia\u201d to allow a gradual recapitalization of \nthe CBA with marketable interest-bearing securities (structural benchmark for \nend-September 2009). \n3.  Other Structural Reforms \n21.  Despite  the  difficult  economic  climate,  we  will  continue  our  wide-ranging  structural \nreform agenda outlined in our Sustainable Development Program. This agenda is aimed at \ndeepening productivity, enhancing structural reforms, and improving governance. A key area \nwill be continued efforts to strengthen the business environment. The tax administration reforms \noutlined above will help in this regard, and we will continue our fight against corruption. \nIII.  PROGRAM FINANCING \n22.  Armenia faces significant financing needs during the program period. Our estimates \nsuggest that a large financing gap in 2009 is likely, due to a significant reduction in export \nearnings, private transfers, and private capital inflows. The decline in export earnings reflects \nthe sharp drop in base metals prices and weakening external demand, while the steep drop in \nprivate transfers and capital inflows is particularly associated with the sharp contraction of the \nRussian economy, from which the majority of both remittances and foreign direct investment \n(FDI) originate. \n \n23.  In the current global climate there are limited available sources of financing. FDI is \nprojected to slow considerably in line with the expected weakening of the Russian economy, the ", "    Appendix 6  41\nmain source of such inflows. The bulk of official external financing included in the program will \nbe provided by the World Bank. \n \n24.  The resulting financing gap can only be partially financed from domestic adjustment. The \ncurrent account position is expected to adjust significantly under the program scenario, declining \nby close to $300 million relative to the program concluded with the Fund in November 2008. \nNevertheless, absent Fund financing, official foreign exchange reserves would fall below the \ndesirable minimum level, and cover less than 3 months of imports. \nIV.  PROGRAM MONITORING \n25.  In the context of significant external financing needs associated with severe external \nshocks,  we  would  like  to  request  a  28-month  Stand-By  Arrangement  in  the  amount  of \nSDR368 million.  The  funding  requested  would  cover  the  remaining  projected  balance  of \npayments needs during 2009 and part of the projected financing gaps in 2010\u20132011. The IMF \nfinancing  would  be  utilized  to  assure  financial  stability  and  to  maintain  Armenia\u2019s  gross \ninternational reserves at a level sufficient to cover about 3 months of imports of goods and \nservices at the end of the program. \n \n26.  The  program  will  be  monitored  via  quarterly  performance  criteria  and  structural \nbenchmarks.  Progress  in  implementing  the  program  will  be  monitored  through  quantitative \ncriteria and indicative targets outlined in Table A6.1 as well as structural performance criteria \nand benchmarks as listed in Table A6.2. The structural measures discussed above that are not \nmentioned in Table A6.2 are part of the authorities\u2019 overall reform effort, but are not part of \nconditionality under this program. The first review of the program is expected to be completed \non or after 15 May 2009, the second review on or after 15 August 2009, the third review on or \nafter 15 November 2009, and the fourth review on or after 15 February 2010. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "42   Appendix 6 \nTable A6.1: Quantitative Targets, 2009a \n(End of period ceilings on stocks, unless otherwise specified) \n \n  2007  2008  2009 \n  Dec  Jun  Dec  Mar  Jun  Sep  Dec \nItem  Act.

Public Financial Management Performance Measurement Report \n1.  The World Bank, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), helped the \nGovernment  of  Armenia  conduct  the  Public  Financial  Management  (PFM)  Performance \nMeasurement in Armenia (PFMPM) in 2008. ADB also conducted a governance and institutional \ncorruption risk assessment (GICRA) in Armenia.1 The major findings of the two reports are \nsummarized below. \n1.  Assessment of PFM Performance \n2.    The report analyzed the upstream and downstream public financial management \nprocesses of the Government of Armenia.  The following are the main findings of the Report. \n \n(i)  Budget Credibility. Budgets are realistic and largely executed as planned. State \nbudget  revenue  forecasts  are  met  and  exceeded,  allowing  the  deficit  to  be \nmaintained at the planned level. There is no significant risk to overall budget \ncredibility. \n \n(ii)   Comprehensiveness  and  Transparency.  Comprehensiveness  and \ntransparency  have  improved,  with  information  on  budget  policies  and \nmacroeconomic forecasts publicly available and published in mass media and \nthe official websites of relevant government agencies. Some risks related to the \noversight  of  public  sector  entities  (state  and  community  noncommercial \norganizations and companies), however, remain. \n \n(iii)   Policy-Based  Budgeting.  There  has  been  a  significant  improvement  in  the \nbudget  preparation  process,  with  the  different  sectors\u2019  policies  in  long-term \nstrategies  (PRSP)  adopted  in  advance  with  medium-term  expenditure \nframeworks. The budget proposal preparation process has a clear institutional \nbasis and is carried out according to legislative requirements. \n \n(iv)   Predictability and Control in Budget Execution. Budget execution is more \npredictable, with largely comprehensive and clear taxpayer liabilities, and fairly \nlimited discretionary powers of tax authorities. Reliable systems are in place for \nrecording and managing cash balances, debt and guarantees, and predictability \nin the availability of funds for commitment of expenditures and organization of \nprocurement. \n \n(v)   Accounting,  Recording,  and  Reporting.  Budget  account  reconciliation  and \naccounting and reporting are under control and regulated. The single Treasury \naccount  is  reconciled  daily  with  the  corresponding  account  in  the  Central \nTreasury  at  aggregate  and  detailed  levels,  as  well  as  the  extra-budgetary \naccounts.  Data  presentation  in  reports  follows  a  functional,  economic,  and \nadministrative  classification  that  conforms  to  the  budget.  The  reports  are \n                                                 \n1 Ministry of Finance. 2008. Public Financial Management Performance Measurement Report. Yerevan; and ADB. \n2008. Armenia: Governance, Institutional and Corruption Risk Assessment. Manila. \n ", "    Appendix 8  45\npresented in a consistent format, on a quarterly basis, and are issued within \n45 days after the end of period. There are concerns over the accuracy of some \ndata, namely, those on funds outside the Treasury system; however, overall, \nthese concerns are not significant in terms of their impact on the accuracy of the \nstatements. A consolidated government statement (consolidating the state and \ncommunity  budget  execution)  is  prepared  yearly.  Information  on  revenue, \nexpenditure, and bank account balances may not always be complete, but the \nomissions  are  not  significant.  The  consolidated  statement  is  submitted  for \nexternal audit within 5 months at the end of the fiscal year. \n \n(vi)  External Scrutiny and Audit. The Chamber of Control was established and \noperates in Armenia and reports to the legislature. The Government provides \nofficial information to the Chamber of Control on the follow-up measures taken to \ncorrect violations identified in the reports of the Chamber of Control within the \nspecified period.  \n \nThe procedures established by law enable the National Assembly to scrutinize \nthe fiscal policies, medium-term fiscal framework, and priorities underlying the \nbudget  proposals  submitted  by  the  Government,  as  well  as  the  details  of \nexpenditure and revenue. Each year, the National Assembly discusses the state \nbudget execution report within the specified period provided that there is an \nopinion by the Chamber of Control. The legislation covering the area does not \nenable the Chamber of Control to issue recommendations on the annual state \nbudget execution report. \n \n2.  Assessment of the Impact of PFM Weaknesses \n \n3.  There have been many improvements in the PFM system in Armenia. The following are \nsome weak areas: \n \nTable A8.1: Weaknesses in PFM System \n \nIndicator        Scorea \n \nEffectiveness of internal audit  C \nComprehensiveness, relevance, and understanding of internal controls  C \nCoverage and quality of the internal audit function  D \nQuality and timeliness of annual financial statements  C \nAccounting standards of annual financial statements  D \nScope, nature, and follow-up of external audit  D \na For information on scoring, please see World Bank. 2005. Public Financial Management Performance \nMeasurement Framework. Washington, DC, or visit http://www.pefa.org. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. 2008. Public Financial Management Performance Measurement Report. Yerevan. \n \n4.  The Report assigns the following reasons for the poor scores against certain indicators: \n \n(i)  In the budget credibility area, there are still issues related to the documentation \nof expenditure arrears. These could adversely affect the overall level of budget \ndiscipline and lead to an increase in expenditure arrears, thereby undermining \nthe strategic allocation of resources, with negative impact on the effectiveness of \npublic services provided by the State. \n  \n ", "46   Appendix 8 \n(ii)  In budget comprehensiveness, there are still issues related to the control of the \noverall fiscal risk from other public sector entities, which do not allow a clear and \ncomplete understanding of the effectiveness of the Government in maintaining \nfinancial discipline and managing financial risks. \n \n(iii)  The adoption of policy-based budgeting is very useful. However, currently, the \nincomplete  introduction  of  performance  budgeting  does  not  allow  a  proper \nlinkage between the budget and policy measures. This, in turn, does not clarify \nfor line ministers the indicators for intra-sector allocation in line with government \npolicy  priorities  for  a  given  sector,  and  undermines  the  assessment  and \ndiscussion of budget efficiency. \n  \n(iv)  Predictability in budget execution is commendable. However, outstanding issues \nin the area of control impede future progress. Internal audit in state bodies falls \nshort of international standards. Similarly, tax collection is affected by the lack of \nclear, risk-based criteria in audit plans.  \n \n(v)  Accounting, recording, and reporting have improved. However, reports contain \nonly information on cash expenditure, and thereby do not give a full picture of \nlong-term financial stability and efficiency of policy measures. National Public \nSector Financial Reporting Standards consistent with International Public Sector \nAccounting Standards (IPSAS) are not yet in place. \n \nB.  Governance and Institutional Corruption Risk Assessment \n \n5.  The GICRA completed by ADB in 2008 identified the following risks: \n \n(i)   Public Financial Management \n\u2022  The absence of an independent and technically, ethically, and professionally \nstrong accounting and auditing profession. \n\u2022  Weak  internal  controls,  due  to  the  inadequate  scope,  approach,  and \nmethodology of internal audits and the poor quality of internal audit reports. \n \n(ii)  Procurement \n\u2022  Lack of capacity at the State Procurement Agency and procuring units which may \nresult in inappropriate procurement. \n \n(iii)  Anticorruption \n\u2022  Weak coordination and monitoring of the Anticorruption Strategy, which may lead \nto weak implementation of the controls against corruption. \n\u2022  Overall public perception of the Government\u2019s poor controls against corruption. \n\u2022  Emerging legal provisions for the full range of customer due diligence. \n \n6.
