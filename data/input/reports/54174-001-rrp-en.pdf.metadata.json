The country\u2019s limited \neconomic diversification and dependence on mining expose it to external shocks, particularly to \nswings in commodity prices. The current turmoil in the global economy and commodity markets \nhas  reduced  revenues,  increased  balance  of  payment  pressures,  and  accentuated  financial \nsector  risks.  The  most  vulnerable  groups  in  Mongolia  are  impacted  most,  as  social  transfers \naccount for about 40% of the poor\u2019s income. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) forecasts gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth in 2020 at 2.1%, down from an earlier estimate of 6.1%.2  \n \n3. \nThe  spread  of  COVID-19  also  poses  a  serious  public  health  threat  to  the  country. \nMongolia\u2019s  proactive  response  to  the  outbreak3\u2014strict  border  closures,  a  suspension  of    air \npassenger travel, enforced quarantine for arriving passengers, and restrictions on daily life\u2014has \nkept  the  number  of  COVID-19  cases  low,  but  vulnerabilities  remain. 4  The  government  has \nidentified 20% of the population at high risk in the context of a strained health system already \nsuffering from a shortage of beds, essential medical equipment, and health care professionals.  \n \n4. \nThe proposed program will help the Government of Mongolia mitigate the severe negative \nhealth and economic impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will support \nthe government\u2019s ongoing initiatives, including (i) a National Emergency Response Plan to contain \nthe spread of COVID-19 and strengthen the health system; and (ii) a countercyclical development \nexpenditure program5 (CDEP), which contains cash transfer schemes and other social protection \nmeasures  targeting  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  households,  and  businesses. 6  Table  1 \nsummarizes Mongolia\u2019s compliance with the access criteria of the CPRO.7 \n \n\nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for CPRO \n \n\nCPRO Access Criteria \n1. \n\nAdverse impact of \n\nexogenous shocks  \n\n2. \n\nCountercyclical \n\ndevelopment expenditure \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nADB forecasts growth will fall to between \u20130.4% and 2.1% in 2020 from \n5.1%  in  2019.  Employment  loss  is  estimated  at  16%\u201320%  of  total \nemployed. Financing needs have largely increased as revenues will fall \nby 9.2%, expenditures will  increase  by 11.7%. The fiscal balance  will \ndeteriorate from 1.4% of GDP in 2019 to -2.7% of GDP in 2020.  \n\nThe government announced plans to spend $1.8 billion under a targeted \nCDEP to support public health ($71.8 million), social protection ($474 \nmillion), and economic measures to mitigate the adverse impact of the \npandemic  ($1.3  billion).  The  CDEP  targets  the  most  vulnerable \nindividuals and companies. \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2020. Policy Paper: ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n2   ADB. 2020.

Macroeconomic \nmanagement  pre-COVID-19  was  generally  sound.  Mongolia  has \nreduced  debt  by  30  percentage  points  since  end  2016  and  ran  fiscal \nsurpluses in both 2018 and 2019.8 Inflation has been below target (8%) \nsince 2017. Despite weaknesses in the banking sector, macroeconomic \nindicators were robust in 2019. Exports hit a historic high of $7.6 billion \nin  2019,  and  FDI  remained  stable  at  $2.1  billion.  The  balance  of \npayments  recorded  a  surplus  of  $0.5  billion,  bringing  gross  foreign \nexchange reserves up to $4.4 billion (5.8 months of imports) in 2019. \nThe National Emergency Response Plan includes quarantine protocols, \ntravel  restrictions,  school  closures,  border  closures,  and  imports  of \nis  also  planning  several \nessential  equipment.

These  include  strengthening  national  standards  for  infection \nprevention and control, improving national standards to manage severe \nacute respiratory infections patients, and increasing the speed at which \nsuspected cases are confirmed.  \nADB\u2019s baseline scenario shows that the public debt\u2013GDP ratio will rise \nby  7.3  percentage  points  to  86.4%  in  2020  (slightly  above  the  2019 \nlevel). Debt-to-GDP is expected to resume its pre-COVID-19 downward \ntrajectory in 2021. This scenario is consistent with the IMF\u2019s views.  \nTo  support  macroeconomic  reforms  in  Mongolia,  the  IMF  established \nan  EFF  in  May  2017,  which  will  close  in  May  2020.  The  EFF  also \nprovides  a platform for coordination and dialogue among international \nfinancial institutions and major development partners.  ADB is in close \ndialogue with the IMF on macroeconomic monitoring, particularly on the \nimpact  of  COVID-19  on  the  economy,  fiscal  responses,  and  debt \nsustainability. The IMF has provided an assessment letter.   \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CDEP  =  countercyclical  development  expenditure  program,  CPRO  =  COVID-19 \nPandemic Response Option, EFF = Extended Fund Facility, FDI = foreign direct investment, GDP = gross domestic \nproduct, IMF = International Monetary Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints  \n\n \nA. \n \n5. \nMongolia\u2019s narrow economic base makes it vulnerable to external shocks across \nmultiple sectors. Mining alone accounts for 24% of GDP and almost 90% of exports, with two \ncommodities\u2014copper  and  coal\u2014representing  more  than  60%  of  exports.9 Mongolia  is  heavily \ndependent  on  trade  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  which  receives  89.1%  of \nMongolia\u2019s exports. The deceleration of the PRC\u2019s economy has triggered a sharp fall in export \nprices in Mongolia (Figure 1), the ramifications of which have depressed economic activity in the \ntransport,  tourism,  retail  trade,  and  services  sectors.  Mobility  restrictions  and  supply  chain \ndisruptions have severely impacted trade. When compared with 2019, March 2020 merchandise \nexports contracted by 41.5%, resulting in a loss of about $700 million in export revenues (Figure \n2)  and  dragging  on  the  current  account  and  balance  of  payments  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020 \n\n8  The debt-to-GDP ratio decreased from 109.1% in 2016 to 79.1% in 2019. \n9  Copper makes up 24% of exports, and coal makes up 40% of exports, according to ADB estimates that are based \n\non statistical data from the Customs General Administration of Mongolia (2020). \n\n \n\n\f(Figure  3).

Despite  Mongolia\u2019s  early  response  to  the  outbreak,  poor  and \nvulnerable  groups  are  especially  at  risk.  The  peri-urban  ger  (traditional  tent)  settlements  in \nUlaanbaatar are highly exposed, with cramped and poorly ventilated houses, limited access to \nwater and sanitation, and inadequate health facilities. Poor air quality in Mongolia means a high \nincidence of chronic respiratory diseases, adding to the underlying vulnerability of the country. \nThe 20% of the population identified to be at high risk include the elderly (400,000 people); people \nwith chronic diseases (350,000); and people with cancer, immunocompromised people, and those \nrequiring hemodialysis. The health system in Mongolia is poorly equipped to respond to a massive \ninflux of COVID-19 patients. Testing capacity for COVID-19 is inadequate, and there is a lack of \nessential health care equipment and trained medical personnel. There are 18,669 hospital beds \n\n10 Ministry of Finance. 22 April 2020. Draft Medium-Term Fiscal Framework. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fin Mongolia, but isolation wards and intensive care services are limited. Nursing care centers are \nalso at high risk because they lack the capacity to respond properly.  \n \n7. \nWomen and small businesses are particularly vulnerable. Women are facing greater \nhardship because of (i) the increased burden of unpaid care work; (ii) their predominant role in \nhealth care (82% women); and (iii) their active participation in family and sole-entrepreneur-owned \nbusinesses (nearly 60% of entrepreneurs are women), which have been affected by the economic \nslowdowns  and  mobility  restrictions.  Further,  the  crisis  has  had  an  impact  on  gender-based \nviolence, as evidenced by the large increase in the number of hotline calls and women resorting \nto shelters since the start of the pandemic.  \n \n8. \nMongolia  has  a  pre-pandemic  record  of  generally  sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement  following  a  difficult  economic  period  before  2017.  Given  its  dependency  on \ncommodity prices, Mongolia suffers from a pronounced boom-bust economic cycle. Following the \nlast episode of economic slowdown, Mongolia entered into an International Monetary Fund (IMF) \n3-year extended fund facility (EFF) in May 2017. Economic growth has been robust since then, \ngrowing by 5.3% in 2017, 7.2% in 2018, and 5.1% in 2019. Mongolia\u2019s other key macroeconomic \nperformance indicators were positive and/or stable in 2019. The overall fiscal balance was 1.4% \nof GDP, the second consecutive year of an overall fiscal surplus. The structural budget deficit was \na modest 1.7% of GDP and consistent with the Law on Fiscal Stability.11 Total exports hit a historic \nhigh of $7.6 billion, foreign direct investment (FDI) remained stable at $2.1 billion, and the balance \nof payments recorded a surplus of $0.5 billion. This brought gross foreign exchange reserves up \nto $4.4 billion (5.8 months of imports) in 2019.  \n \n9. \nFiscal policy tightening and growth recovery in recent years have reduced debt, but \nchallenges remain. Revenues have steadily increased since 2017, supported by improved tax \nadministration and stronger demand for Mongolia\u2019s exports. Expenditures have been more tightly \ncontrolled, and the public investment program has been strengthened. This has reduced public \ndebt (including central bank liabilities) from 109.1% of GDP in 2016 to 79.1% of GDP in 2019. It \nhas also turned a fiscal deficit of 15.3% of GDP in 2016 into surpluses of 2.6% in 2018 and 1.4% \nin 2019. The less favorable economic outlook is combining with a considerable amount of external \ndebt repayments, including maturing bonds during 2020\u20132024, to present important challenges \nfor  fiscal  policy.12 Average  inflation  increased  from  6.8%  in  2018  to  7.3%  in  2019  but  remains \nbelow the inflation target of 8.0%. The Bank of Mongolia gradually tightened its monetary policy \nstance from the end of 2018 because of increased downward pressure on the currency and the \npass-through  to  inflation. 13  Underlying  issues  in  the  banking  sector  around  asset  quality \ndeterioration remain, and bank recapitalization is still incomplete. These issues were identified in \nthe IMF program and constitute important policy priorities going forward.  \n \n10. \nThe  CDEP  and  monetary  policy  easing  demonstrate  Mongolia\u2019s  comprehensive \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 27 March 2020, the government launched the CDEP, \nannouncing  its  intention  to  introduce  $1.8  billion  worth  of  measures  to  counter  the  negative \nimpacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Planned  financing  will  come  from  budget  savings  (24%), \nforgone government revenue (23%), and the public investment program (53%). Under the current \nfinancing scenario, the overall fiscal balance for 2020 will deteriorate by 4.1 percentage points of \n\n \n\n11  Under the law, the structural budget deficit shall not exceed 2% of GDP. Law of Mongolia on Fiscal Stability      \n\n(certified translation): http://www.iltod.gov.mn/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Law-of-Mongolia-on-Fiscal-Stability.pdf \n(last accessed on 16 April 2020). \n\n12  Total external debt repayment during 2020\u20132024, including international bonds, external loans, and government \n\nguarantees, is forecast to be $5.9 billion. \n\n13  More information on monetary policy and inflation is included in Appendix 6. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fGDP from the 2019 level to \u20132.7%. The Bank of Mongolia reduced the policy rate twice (in March \nand  April  2020),  by  2  percentage  points  to  9.0%.  It  also  lowered  the  mandatory  reserve \nrequirements for local currency liabilities, reduced the minimum prudential requirement on liquidity \nratios  by  5  percentage  points  to  20%,  and  waived  consumer  and  housing  mortgage  credit \nrepayments. The CDEP covers three areas (Appendix 5):14 \n \n\n(i)  Measures  supporting  citizens.  At  least  1.8  million  people  will  benefit  from  social \nprotection support for vulnerable households and individuals affected by the crisis. The \nplanned spending is $474 million.  \n\n(ii)  Support  to  vulnerable  businesses  and  fiscal  stimulus  measures.  An  estimated \n30,000  companies  and  233,000  herder  households  will  be  reached  by  measures  to \nsupport vulnerable businesses. Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) \nwill receive financial support to protect jobs.  This package includes (a) fiscal stimulus \nmeasures,  such  as  support  for  enhanced  preparation  at  border  crossing  points  to \nfacilitate  exports  (e.g.,  through  vehicle  disinfection);  and  (b)  increased  financial \nassistance for heightened monitoring  of manufacturing, service, and catering facilities \nin their efforts to comply with regulations aimed at preventing the spread of infection. \nSpending  equivalent  to  $1.3  billion  is  planned,  although  this  package  is  not  yet  fully \nfinanced. \n\n(iii)  Public health protection. Planned spending of $71.8 million will finance measures that \nprotect  lives,  health,  and  safety  by  (a)  preparing  for  and  responding  to  a  potential \nCOVID-19  epidemic  within  the  country;  and  (b)  investigating  and  controlling  case \nclusters with testing, contact tracing, and isolation. The added expenditure will increase \nhealth sector spending in 2020 by 14.9% over 2019. \n\n \n11. \nThe CDEP is aligned with the country\u2019s macroeconomic framework, and public debt \nremains  sustainable.  The  government\u2019s  expenditure  program  is  consistent  with  the  Law  on \nFiscal  Stability.  The  government  aims  to  use  existing  programs  (such  as  the  Child  Money \nProgram) and channels (such as income tax, sales tax, and social security contributions) to deliver \nthe  program,  ensuring  that  the  funds  can  reach  intended  targets  quickly  and  efficiently.  As \nMongolia has been under an IMF program since 2017, it was subject to regular IMF reviews until \nthe end of 2018. The IMF conducted a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) as part of the Article IV \nConsultation  in  September  2019. 15  The  DSA  indicates  that,  although  debt  is  high,  positive \ndynamics  related  to  high  nominal  growth,  access  to  concessional  financing,  and  strong  fiscal \nperformance mean that the debt ratio has been declining and is expected to fall significantly up \nto 2024. Updated analysis conducted by ADB indicates that public debt will rise by 7.3 percentage \npoints to 86.4% in 2020 (slightly above the 2019 level) before resuming its downward trajectory \nin 2021 and decreasing steadily through 2025.16 The planned assistance under this program of \n$100  million,  at  0.9%  of  current  public  debt,  increases  the  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  by  0.7  percentage \npoints and falls within a sustainable fiscal framework to manage the potential impact on debt and \nfiscal  sustainability.  Further,  the  spread  on  Mongolian  government  bonds  in international  bond \nmarkets has widened by 5.76%\u20138.72% since 27 February 2020, indicating that other sources of \nexternal finance are not currently cost-effective options.  \n \n\n14  Further details are provided in section B.  \n15  IMF. 2019.

Mongolia  has  taken  prompt  and  decisive  actions  to  respond  to  the  COVID-19 \npandemic and remains on high alert.17 Shortly after the initial outbreak in the PRC, the National \nSecurity  Council  imposed  restrictions  to  contain  the  spread  of  COVID-19  and  limit  regional \ntransmission. A $4.3 million allocation from the state budget in February 2020 was used to procure \nmedical  equipment  and supplies to ensure that dedicated  hospitals  and health institutions  can \nprevent  transmission  and  respond  to  COVID-19  cases.  The  National  Emergency  Commission \nissued  six  directives  between  21  February  2020  and  22  March  2020  that  imposed  bans  on \ninternational travel\u2015currently no commercial air routes are available to enter or exit Mongolia. \nGiven  Mongolia\u2019s  strategic  location  in  connecting  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation,  the \ncountry\u2019s  control  of  the  spread  of  COVID-19  and  subsequent  efforts  to strengthen testing  and \ndisease  control  protocols  will  have  important  benefits  for  its  neighbors  and  for  East  Asia  and \nEurope.  The  CDEP  contains  measures  that  will  support  economic  recovery  through  trade  and \nsafeguard critical supply chains, thus planting the seeds for a recovery based on regional trade \nand integration. The government has formulated the National Emergency Response Plan, which \nidentifies  that  $240  million  is  required  to  support  the  procurement  of  10,000  units  of  priority \nemergency  medical  equipment,  increase  surveillance  capacity,  ensure  adequate  supply  of \nmedicines,  strengthen  laboratory  and  testing  protocols,  and  provide  essential  support  to \nvulnerable populations including food, fuel, and medical support.  \n \nADB\u2019s value addition. As Mongolia\u2019s largest development partner, 18 ADB has a major \n13. \nrole  to  play  in  convening  all  stakeholders.  ADB\u2019s  COVID-19  support  is  consistent  with  pillar  1 \n(economic  and  social  stability)  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia 19  and \noperational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities) of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030. 20  The  program  supports  implementation  of  the  regional  cooperation  and  integration \noperational plan under Strategy 2030\u2014 particularly its pillar on promoting regional public goods, \nwhich include joint control of transboundary health risks.21 It is also aligned with the Central Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  2030  operational  cluster  on  human  development, \nwhich highlights \u201caddressing pandemic risks and control of communicable diseases\u201d as critical \nregional public goods with significant positive externalities.22 \n \nADB\u2019s package of support for COVID-19 in Mongolia includes rapid response measures \n14. \nsuch as reallocating $1.4 million in early February under an existing health sector operation to \nsupport  the  procurement  of  emergency  health  equipment,  preparing  a  small-scale  technical \nassistance project for emergency response systems in the health sector, and approving a $1.0 \nmillion grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Facility to support further procurement of \nemergency medical equipment.23 It also includes short- and medium-term responses, such as a \n\n \n\n17  The initial outbreak has led to a United Nations resolution on global solidarity on COVID-19 that emphasizes the \n\nneed for regional and global cooperation. \n\n18  ADB  represents  35%  of  all  official  development  assistance  flows  to  Mongolia.  2018  data  taken  from \n\nhttps://stats.oecd.org/.

Support \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fproposed $30 million loan to support disease control in the health sector, a proposed $50 million \nloan to strengthen social protection measures to provide direct support to vulnerable groups, and \ntechnical assistance resources to strengthen the capacity of the domestic violence response in \nthe country. ADB is also repurposing $24 million under ADB\u2019s support to the Credit Guarantee \nFund to directly support small and medium-sized enterprises in distress. 24 The proposed COVID-\n19 Rapid Response program under the pandemic response option will support these efforts by \nhelping  the  government  manage  the  economic  impact  and  respond  to  the  health  and  social \nprotection needs the pandemic has created.   \n \n15. \nADB\u2019s  experience  in  each  of  these  sectors  can  help  the  government  translate  these \nresponses  into  permanent  structural  improvements.  ADB  has  long  been  a  major  development \npartner in Mongolia\u2019s health sector, supporting systemic reforms (notably the Health Law of 2016 \nand  laws  related  to  health  insurance,  medicines,  and  medical  devices)  and  medical  care  and \nservices.  ADB  has  combined  this  support  with  investment  lending,  including  a  $163.51  million \nmultitranche financing  facility  committed  in 2019.25 ADB\u2019s  engagement  in social  protection  has \nincluded support for the design and financing of social welfare programs, as well as ADB\u2019s first-\never stand-alone operation to combat domestic violence. ADB is also deeply involved in helping \nMongolia strengthen disaster response and resilience and is planning its first lending operation in \nthis sector for 2021. ADB is supporting Mongolia\u2019s efforts to diversify the economy and become \nless dependent on mining through investments in agriculture and tourism.  Finally, ADB\u2019s long-\nstanding engagement with the government on fiscal and macroeconomic management is a major \nadvantage.  This  enabled  ADB  to  help  the  government  shape  its  response  to  the  COVID-19 \npandemic and the CDEP, including the policies to reduce expenditures and raise revenues to help \nfinance the CDEP. ADB has also worked with the government to sharpen the CDEP\u2019s focus on \nwomen, including more explicit targeting, and to strengthen the arrangements for monitoring the \nimplementation of both the CDEP and the proposed ADB COVID-19 rapid response program.  \n \n16. \nCoordination with IMF and other development partners. Close coordination with the \nIMF is facilitated by the presence of the EFF, which provides a regular mechanism for coordination \nand  dialogue  among  international  financial  institutions  and  major  development  partners.  To \nensure that  COVID-19  pandemic  responses  are well-aligned  and complementary,  ADB  is  also \nworking on an almost daily basis through the resident mission with the IMF and the World Bank, \nother  development  partners,  and  various  United  Nations  agencies,  including  the  Humanitarian \nCountry Team. This operational coordination has been complemented by high-level discussions \nwith the IMF, the World Bank, and the government at a senior management level. The result is \nthat all development partners share a common understanding with the government of the impact \nof  COVID-19  and  the  required  response.  The  World  Bank  has  approved  a  $26.9  million \ninvestment loan in the health sector. Other development partners, including the United Nations, \nthe  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, have all made contributions to the COVID-19 response. The Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank (AIIB) has expressed an interest in budget support; discussions are ongoing, \nand ADB teams have shared their experience.

There will be a focus on primary health care and hospitals. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fImpact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nits  Rapid  Financing  Instrument.  The IMF  has  provided  ADB  with  an  assessment  letter  for  this \noperation,  which  summarizes  the  economic  impact  of  the  COVID-19  crisis  on  Mongolia  and \nhighlights the main vulnerabilities and key challenges facing the country.26  \n  \nC. \n \n17. \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  program  will  be  that  the  adverse  effects  of  the  COVID-19 \npandemic on the economy are mitigated and poverty is alleviated. The outcome will be negative \nhealth and economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis on vulnerable groups mitigated. The program \nwill have the following three outputs:  \n \n18. \nOutput 1: Measures and increased fund allocation for social protection programs \nfor the most vulnerable groups implemented. This output will provide social protection support \nto vulnerable households under the CDEP. The CDEP will increase the allocation under the Child \nMoney Program by 50% to MNT30,000 per child per month, and this is expected to reach 1.1 \nmillion  children.  Private  sector  workers  will  be  exempt  from  personal  income  tax for  6 months \nstarting from 1 April 2020. This is targeted at employees at risk of losing their jobs, so public sector \nworkers are not included. As women are overrepresented in the public sector (60.4%), which is \nnot  covered  by  the  program,  the  target  is  to  ensure  that  at  least  45%  of  the  beneficiaries  are \nwomen. Companies whose activities have been stopped because of the government restrictions \nfor  controlling  the  spread  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  will  receive  a  monthly  stipend  of \nMNT200,000 per employee retained by such companies. Individuals will receive reimbursement \nof the value-added tax (VAT) paid in the first quarter of 2020. This is expected to benefit 860,000 \ncitizens, with each gaining an average of MNT47,000. Until September, households will not be \ndisconnected or penalized if their electricity bills are not paid on time.  \n\n \n19. \nOutput 2: Measures to safeguard productive sectors and micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises from the downturn implemented. To protect jobs, support will be provided \nto MSMEs, including those engaged in international trade, particularly the import of critical food \nand medical supplies. These measures will not apply to any public or semipublic company or any \nprivate  company  that  is  implementing  public  procurement  contracts.  Businesses  whose \noperations have been impacted will be eligible for a 6-month exemption from the payment of social \ninsurance. At least 50% of these businesses will be owned or run by women. The businesses will \nbe exempt from interest and penalties due on unpaid social insurance premiums before 1 April \n2020.  Companies  with  annual  sales  of  less  than  MNT1.5  billion  will  be  exempt  from  paying \ncorporate  income  tax  for  6  months.  This  is  expected  to  benefit  30,448  vulnerable  MSMEs. \nBaseline data suggests that 34.2% of MSMEs are women-owned or run, so a target of reaching \nat  least  34.0%  of  businesses  owned by  women  has  been  set.  Entities  that  voluntarily  reduced \nlease rates for businesses affected by the economic situation will receive tax exemptions on lease \nrevenue.  There  will  a  2-month  deferment  of  customs  duties  and  VAT  due  on  staple  products, \nincluding imported goods such as rice, wheat, sugar, and vegetable oil. MSMEs will be provided \nwith increased access to guarantees on loans of less than MNT30 million. Cashmere producers \n(one of the most affected industries) will receive concessional loans, benefitting 233,000 herder \nhouseholds and 47 companies. Agri-companies will receive a 50% reduction on the purchase of \nagricultural equipment, assisting 1,500 companies.  \n\n \n20. \nOutput  3:  Measures  to  strengthen  infection  prevention  and  control  established. \nThese measures will include (i) procuring and supplying essential health care equipment, as well \nas hospital supplies for disinfection and decontamination; (ii) increasing surveillance capacity; (iii) \n\n26  IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support  \n\nstrengthening laboratory and testing protocols; (iv) enabling the health authorities to increase the \navailability of frontline health workers to promptly respond to the crisis; and (v) exempting drugs \nand health products used for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 from customs duties and \nVAT.  These  short-term  responses  will  be  complemented  by  a  set  of  medium-term  measures \noutside  of  the  CDEP,  targeting  2022  achievement,  proposed  in  the  government\u2019s  National \nEmergency  Response  Plan.  These  include  (i)  strengthening  35  hospitals  to  meet  national \ninfection prevention and control standards, (ii) improving 210 hospitals to meet national standards \nto manage Severe Acute Respiratory Infection patients, and (iii) enhancing testing capacity and \nensuring  that  75%  of  samples  from  suspected  cases  of  COVID-19  and/or  Severe  Acute \nRespiratory Infection are confirmed within the standard time.  \n \nD. \n \n21. \nIn addition to the pandemic\u2019s effect of reducing government revenues, the CDEP response \nto the crisis will raise expenditures by 11.7% over 2019 (Table 2). The overall fiscal balance will \ndeteriorate by 4.1 percentage points to \u20132.7% ($379 million), and the structural fiscal balance by \n3.4  percentage  points  to  \u20135.1%.  According  to  the  Law  on  Fiscal  Stability,  the  government  is \nrequired  to  finance  the  structural  deficit.  This  results  in  financing  needs  of  $713  million.  The \ngovernment plans to increase external borrowing by $495 million to finance 69.4% of the structural \ndeficit.  The  remainder  is  to  come  from  the  stabilization  fund  and  other  sources  now  under \nconsideration,  including  mobilizing  domestic  financing.  The  proposed  program  will  account  for \n20.2% of the government\u2019s planned external borrowing. The government is in discussions with \nother development partners, including the IMF, the World Bank, the European Union, and the AIIB \non meeting the remaining external financing needs. \n \n\nTable 2: Revised Budget Forecasts and Domestic Financing Needs \n\n2020 Revised Forecast \n(Post-COVID-19)  \n\n($ million) \n\nItem \nTotal revenues \nTotal expenditures \nOverall balance \nStructural balancea \nFinancing plan \nExternal loans  \nADB CPRO \nOther ADB COVID-19b \nOther development partnersc \nExternal financing gapd \n\nStabilization Fund \nOther (under consideration) \n\n2019 Budget \n(Pre-COVID-19) \n(% of GDP) \n32.4 \n31.0 \n  1.4 \n(1.7) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(% of GDP) \n30.3 \n33.0 \n(2.7) \n(5.1) \n5.1 \n3.5 \n0.7 \n0.2 \n1.6 \n1.0 \n0.3 \n1.3 \n\n4,231 \n4,610 \n(379) \n(713) \n713 \n495 \n100 \n30 \n227 \n138 \n36 \n182 \n\n()  =  negative,  ADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  COVID-19  =  Coronavirus  disease,  CPRO  OVID-19  Pandemic \n\nResponse Option, GDP = Gross Domestic Product \na The structural balance refers to structural revenue minus  total expenditure.

The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity method, \nthe average maturity is 10.9 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB.27  \n \nE. \n \n23. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency for the program. The proceeds \nof the loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time). As the CDEP is part of the government budget, it will be subject to \naudit by the National Audit Office. This audit will be finalized and shared with ADB for monitoring \npurposes in June 2021. The program will be implemented in coordination with the ongoing and \nplanned regional technical assistance under the CAREC framework, especially for policy dialogue \nand information sharing on the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. The loan will be withdrawn as \na single tranche. The implementation period is 1 March 2020\u201330 June 2021. \n \n24.  Monitoring and evaluation. Several of the initiatives under the CDEP are using existing \ngovernment mechanisms, such as the Child Money Program and the tax administration system. \nThese  mechanisms  are  subject  to  their  own  monitoring  arrangements,  which  will  be  used  to \nassess the effectiveness of the CDEP. The MOF has also requested that ADB help strengthen \nmonitoring of the CDEP, including sex-disaggregated data monitoring, under an existing technical \nassistance project.28 The MOF will monitor, evaluate, and regularly report to ADB on areas that \nwill include (i) developments in its macroeconomic and fiscal conditions, including the CDEP; (ii) \nimpacts of the CDEP on poor and vulnerable groups, disaggregated by sex, including the number \nof  beneficiaries  of  cash  transfer  schemes  and  other  social  assistance  programs;  (iii) \nimplementation of its National Emergency Response Plan; and (iv) progress on gender-related \ntargets and indicators in the design and monitoring framework and gender monitoring matrix. In \naddition,  there  are  several  instruments  for  health  status  monitoring  in  Mongolia,  including  the \nannual  reports  and  statistics  produced  by  the  Ministry  of  Health,  the  annual  United  Nations \nSustainable  Development  Goals  monitoring  undertaken  by  the  government  and  the  United \nNations Development Programme, as well as the monitoring of health status by the World Health \nOrganization. Finally, ADB\u2019s East Asia Department is preparing a specific tool in the form of a \nregularly  updated  monitoring  report  to  track  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  key \nindicators,  such  as  employment  and  poverty.  ADB  will  also  establish  a  platform  approach \ninvolving regular engagement with government, civil society, the private sector, and development \npartners to monitor the situation and assess the effectiveness of the CDEP.29  \n \n\n \n\n27  Assessment on risk-bearing capacity has been completed by the Office of Risk Management, and this is reflected \n\nin ADB. 2020.

Manila. \n29  Poverty monitoring will be greatly facilitated by the already existing Integrated Household Database, which is based \non a proxy means test survey and is also referred to as the PMT database.  A household's PMT score determines \neligibility  for  five  types  of  social  welfare  programs:  food  stamps,  child  grants  (the  Child  Money  Program),  cash \nallowances for emergency cases, health care fee waivers, and legal advocacy services for the poor.    \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE   \n\n \n25. \nSafeguards. No adverse environmental, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples \nimpacts under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) have been identified. The program is \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n\n \n26. \nGovernance.  Mongolia  has  strong  financial  management  legislation  (e.g.,  Integrated \nBudget  Law  and  the  Law  on  Development  Planning),  governance  structures,  and  operational \npublic financial management systems in place, including a functional Treasury single account, a \nunified  and  consistent  chart  of  accounts,  and  an  integrated  government  debt  and  financial \nmanagement information system. Despite this, there remain areas for improvement related to the \nefficiency,  effectiveness,  and  transparency  of  the  public  financial  management  system. 30 To \naddress this, MOF has adopted the Public Financial Management Reform Strategy, 2018\u20132020, \nsupported by ADB, the World Bank, the European Union,31 and the IMF.32 The strategy aims to \nstrengthen alignment of expenditures and revenue outputs with the originally approved budget, \nimprove the quality of cash flow forecasts and unpredictability in availability of funds, strengthen \nbudget  credibility  to  support  public  policy  effectiveness,  and  enhance  accounting  policies  and \nreporting frameworks. Over the medium term, ADB will continue to stay engaged.33 \n \n27. \nThe revised Public Procurement Law adopted in 2013 introduced significant changes in \nthe  public  procurement  system.  Responsibility  for  procurement  was  transferred  to  the \nGovernment  Procurement  Agency  (GPA),  now  a  division  of  the  State  Property  Administration \nAuthority  after  internal  restructuring.  Local  governments  were  given  more  responsibility  for \nprocurement.  The  revised  law  also  includes  provisions  that  genuflect  to  the  need  to  make \nprocurement  processes  more  transparent  and  participative.  The  implementation  of  these \nambitious reforms is ongoing. The Public Procurement Law was amended in 2019 with the aim \nof strengthening transparency and accountability. ADB supported the preparation of this amended \nlaw by providing technical assistance.34 While it is well documented that vulnerability to corruption \ncan undermine accountability throughout the economic and political sphere, Mongolia has also \naddressed these vulnerabilities, e.g., through its active membership of the Anticorruption Initiative \nfor  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  which  is  supported  by  ADB  and  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation and Development.35 The main governance risks and (proposed) mitigation measures \nare summarized in Table 3.    \n \n28. \nSocial,  poverty,  and  gender.

Poverty \nconcentration is growing in urban areas, with reductions in rural areas attributable to increased \ndemand for livestock and price increases. The 14.9% of people living just above the poverty line \nare  highly  vulnerable  to  shocks.  A  recent  poverty  assessment  also  found  that  social  transfers \nhave contributed to reducing poverty in rural and urban areas.36  \n \n29. \nThe program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Women are being affected \nby  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  multiple  ways.  Quarantine  measures  and  school  closures  have \nincreased unpaid household and care work, the bulk of which is traditionally carried out by women. \nWomen also play a key role in the health sector, comprising 82% of the health sector workforce. \nEconomically, women will be affected as business owners and workers, particularly as they are \nconcentrated  in sectors  likely  to  suffer  impacts  including  agriculture,  services,  and  retail  trade. \nThe packages under the CDEP have set targets to ensure vulnerable female employees benefit \nfrom tailored social protection and job retention programs, suspension of personal income tax, \nand  compulsory  and  voluntary  social  insurance  premiums.  The  packages  will  also  support \nMSMEs  owned  by  women  and  businesses  where  women  make  up  a  significant  number  of \nemployees. Sex-disaggregated data on business ownership is not available, and ADB will use \nadditional  technical  assistance resources to ensure  that  the  social  insurance and tax payment \nholidays are monitored so that this disaggregation can be clearly measured. Furthermore, ADB \nwill strengthen the availability of sex-disaggregated data in tax administration systems as part of \na  proposed  technical  assistance  project  for  2020.  This  program  will  also  benefit  from \ncomplementary  operations  planned  by  ADB  to  address  domestic  violence,  targeted  social \nprotection response measures, and improved sex-disaggregated data availability to strengthen \ngender design for upcoming projects to support MSMEs. \n  \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nProlonged COVID-19 crisis \nAn  extended  crisis  heightens  the  socio-\neconomic impact requiring a more significant \nresponse  that  is  beyond  the  government\u2019s \ncapacity to provide. \n\nin \n\npublic \n\nratios  because  of \nexpenditure \n\nPublic financial management \nHigh  level  of  budget  proposals  based  on \noverestimated  revenue  forecasts,  leads  to \ndeterioration of budget credibility. \nLow  capital  output \ninefficiencies \nmanagement. \nProcurement \nLimited  use  of  GPA  and  fragmentation  of \nprocurement functions across administration \nmay  lead  to  mis-procurement.

Adverse Impact of Exogenous \nShocks \n\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \n\nMongolia  has  taken  decisive  actions  to  contain  the  spread  of  the \ncoronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  in  the  country  but  the \nsocioeconomic  impact  and  the  pressure  on  the  country\u2019s  health \nsystems are severe.  \n \nMajor slowdown in economic growth. ADB has revised the 2020 \ngrowth  forecast  down  from  6.1%  to  2.1%.  A  protracted  global \neconomic crisis because of the COVID-19 pandemic further worsens \nthis outlook considerably. Mongolia was already vulnerable coming \ninto this crisis with growth in Q4 2019  affected by falling growth in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and moderating commodity prices. \n \nThe  slowdown  puts  a  fiscal  strain  on  the  country.  Total \ngovernment  revenue  has  fallen  by  10.6%  year  over  year  as  of \nFebruary 2020. Government revenue will drop by at least 9.2% for \n2020  from  the  approved  2020  budget.  This  will  result  in  a  budget \ndeficit  equal  to  2.7%  of  GDP  (or  $379  million),  an  increase  of  4.1 \npercentage points from the 2019 budget.  \n \nThe balance of payments is also under severe pressure. In the \nfirst  quarter  of  2020,  the  current  account  balance  deteriorated  by \n92.7%  mainly  because  of  lower  inflows  of  merchandise  exports  in \nFOB  terms  (\u201349.2%)  and  tourism  receipts  (\u201356.6%).  Net  foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) and portfolio investment decreased by 5.0% \nand  85.2%,  respectively,  resulting  in  the  shrinkage  of  the  financial \naccount  surplus  by  26.1%.  As  a  result,  the  overall  balance  of \npayments deteriorated by 259.5% to $350 million in deficit, and this \nextremely negative trend is expected to continue.  \n   \nSocial  Impacts.  The  government  estimates  that  about  20%  (over \n772,000 persons) of the population are at \u201chigh risk\u201d. These include \nelderly  people  (250,000),  people  with  chronic  diseases  (350,000), \nand other categories of people, including those dealing with cancer, \nhemodialysis,  and  immunosuppression.  There  are  18,669  hospital \nbeds in Mongolia, of which 2,916 beds (including only 633 intensive \ncare beds) are dedicated to COVID-19 treatment. The health system \nin  Mongolia  is  poorly  equipped  to  respond  to  a  massive  influx  of \nCOVID-19 patients.  Given that many people have respiratory pre-\nconditions because of the poor air quality in Ulaanbaatar and other \nurban  areas  in  the  country,  this  would  quickly  overburden  health \nfacilities and lead to a disproportionally high level of deaths  \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n21 \n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response \nOption: Criteria and Indicators \n \n\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \n\nSignificant  job  losses  and  increased  poverty.  The  national \npoverty line was 28.4% in 2018, and the pattern in Mongolia shows \nthat  poverty  is  impacted  significantly  by  economic  downturns  and \nrecovers slowly. A further 14.9% of people live just above the poverty \nline  and  are  highly  vulnerable  to  shocks.  According  to  the  annual \nsurvey of Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry \n(MNCCI)  (released  in  April),  business  confidence  in  Mongolia  is \nmuch weaker in 2020 than it was last year. The survey results show \nthat businesses expect a rising trend in unemployment and poverty, \nand  a  two-fold  decline  in  expected  earnings.  The  MNCCI  also \nestimates that as many as 20% of all jobs could be lost.  Micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) will bear the brunt of these \ndifficulties,  which  will  have  a  knock-on  impact  on  employment. \nDespite limited data on social and gender impacts of the COVID-19 \nfor  Mongolia,  women  are  facing  greater  hardship  because  of  an \nincreased burden of unpaid care work and their predominant role in \nthe health sector operations (82% women). Women comprise more \nthan  60% of entrepreneurs in the country. Most of them  run  micro \nand family-owned businesses in industries that have been adversely \naffected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such \nas wool, cashmere, farming, services, and retail.  \n \nGovernment  has \nintroduced  a  major  countercyclical \ndevelopment  expenditure  program  (CDEP)  to  respond  to  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The CDEP includes three areas of support:  \n \nMeasures supporting citizens \nThe CDEP increases income support to poor and vulnerable groups \nand households. Particularly, it will increase the allocation under the \nChild  Money  Program  by  50%  to  MNT30,000  ($11)  per  child  per \nmonth. It will reach 1.1 million children. The CDEP also supports a \nfull exemption for private sector workers of personal income tax from \n1 April 2020 for 6 months. This is targeted at employees deemed at \nrisk of losing their jobs (public sector workers have not been included \nin this measure). Companies whose activities were stopped because \nof the government restrictions for controlling COVID-19 will receive \na  monthly  stipend  of  MNT200,000  ($72  equivalent)  per  employee. \nIndividuals will receive reimbursement of the VAT paid in Q1. This \nwill benefit 860,000 citizens, each gaining an average of MNT47,000 \n($17 equivalent). Households will not be disconnected nor will they \nreceive  a  penalty  in  case  their  electricity  bill  is  paid  late.  This \nmeasure is in place until September 2020.  \n \nSupport  to  MSMEs  and  wider  economic  stimulus  measures. \nBusinesses whose operations have been impacted will be eligible for \na 6-month exemption from the payment of social insurance. These \ncompanies will be exempt from interest and penalties due on unpaid \nsocial  insurance  premiums  before  1  April  2020.  Companies  with \nsales lower than MNT1.5 billion ($541,000 equivalent) will be exempt \nfrom paying corporate income tax for a duration of 6 months. This is \nexpected  to  benefit  28%  of  private  sector  entities  or  30,448 \nfor \ncompanies.  Entities \nbusinesses  affected  by  the  economic  situation  will  receive  tax \nexemptions on lease revenue.  \n \n\nthat  voluntarily  reduced \n\nlease  rates \n\n \n\n2.

Pre-shock  record  of  generally \nsound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \n\nThere will be a 2-month deferment of customs duties and VAT due \non  staple  products,  including  such  imported  goods  as  rice,  wheat, \nsugar, and vegetable oil. The purpose of this support is to help and \nincentivize  these  companies  to  retain  their  employees  to  minimize \nthe impact on unemployment in the country. \n \nThe economic stimulus measures include enhanced preparation at \nborder  crossing  points,  such  as  vehicle  disinfection,  to  facilitate \nexports; as well as provision of increased support to and heightened \nmonitoring of manufacturing, service, and catering facilities in their \nefforts  to  comply  with  regulations  related  to  the  prevention  of  the \nspread of infection. A large number of public capital projects (1,500) \nwill  be  brought  forward  to  aid  more  than  15,000  contractors  and \n150,000  employees.  MSMEs  will  be  provided  with  an  increased \naccess to guarantees on loans of less than MNT30 million ($10,000 \nequivalent).  Cashmere  producers,  one  of  the  largest  affected \nsectors, will receive concessional loans. This is expected to benefit \n233,000 herder households and 47 companies. Agri-companies will \nreceive  50%  reduction  on  the  purchase  of  agriculture  equipment. \nThis is expected to assist 1,500 companies. \n \nPublic  health  protection.  Under  this  package,  measures  that \nprotect  human  lives,  health,  and  safety  will  be  implemented.  It \ncomprises  a  significant  increase  of  funding  in  the  health  sector, \nwhich will be under strain because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \nadditional funding will be used for (i) the procurement and supply of \nessential  health  care  equipment,  and  hospital  supplies \nfor \ndisinfection  and  decontamination;  (ii) \nincreasing  surveillance \ncapacity;  (iii)  strengthening  laboratory  and  testing  protocols;  (iv) \nenabling the health authorities to increase the availability of front line \nhealth workers to promptly respond to the crisis; and (v) exempting \ndrugs and health products used for the diagnosis and treatment of \nCOVID-19 from customs duties and VAT.  \n \nIn  2019,  Mongolia\u2019s  key  macroeconomic  performance \nindicators  were  positive  and/or  stable.  The  overall  and  primary \nfiscal  balances  both  recorded  surpluses\u2014for  the  2nd  consecutive \nyear\u2014equal to 1.4% and 3.7% of GDP, respectively. The structural \nbudget deficit was a modest 1.7% of GDP and thus consistent with \nthe Law on Fiscal Stability. Total exports hit a historical high at $7.6 \nbillion,  FDI  remained  stable  at  $2.1  billion,  and  the  balance  of \npayments had a surplus of $0.5 billion, enabling an increase of gross \nreserves to $4.4 billion. GDP growth remained robust at 5.1%.  \n \nFiscal performance has greatly improved since 2017. Revenues \nhave  steadily  increased  since  2017,  supported  by  measures  to \nimprove tax administration and benefitting from stronger demand for \nMongolia\u2019s exports. Expenditures have been more tightly controlled, \nand  efforts  have  been  made  to  strengthen  the  public  investment \nprogram. This positive performance has allowed the government to \nreduce  government  debt  (including  central  bank  liabilities)  from \n109.1% of GDP in 2016 to 79.1% of GDP in 2019 (a 30 percentage \npoint reduction) and to turn the fiscal deficit of 15.3% of GDP in 2016 \nto a surplus of 2.6% in 2018 and 1.4% in 2019. Challenges remain  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n23 \n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response \nOption: Criteria and Indicators \n \n\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \n\nover  the  composition  of  expenditure,  optimization  of  expenditures \nstructure, and fiscal governance.  \n\n \n\nMonetary  policy  was  consistent  with  promoting  external \nbalances,  restoring  confidence,  and  enabling  increasing  net \ndomestic credit. Although average inflation increased from 1.1% in \n2017 to 7.3% in 2019, this was still below the Parliament-approved \ninflation target of 8%.   The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) cut the policy \ninterest  rate  from  11.0%  to  10.0%  in  March  2020,  reduced  the \nreserve requirement for MNT by 2 percentage points to 8.5%, and \nnarrowed the  interest rate  corridor to plus  and minus 1%  from the \npolicy interest rate. The BOM also made amendments to the Asset \nClassification  and  Provisioning  Procedure  to  (i)  extend  loan \nclassification  terms  from  15  days  to  90  days  for  consumer  loans, \nfrom 31 days to 91\u2013120 days for past-due arrears, and from 90 days \nto  121  days  for  non-performing  loans;  (ii)  ease  requirements  on \nimpaired  consumer  and  business  loans;  (iii)  waive  conservation \nbuffer  requirements  on  the  banks\u2019  capital;  and  (iv)  reduce  the \nminimum  liquidity  ratio  from  25%  to  20%.  Further,  all  banks  were \nasked  to  reduce  small  transaction  fees  by  20%\u2013100%  during  the \nemergency  period.  In  April  2020,  the  BOM  allowed  banks  to \npostpone  housing  mortgage  loan  (impaired)  repayments  by  3 \nmonths.  The  BOM  also  cut  the  policy  interest  rate  by  a  further \npercentage point to 9.0% and allowed banks to postpone consumer \nloan (impaired) repayments by up to 12 months. \n \nChallenges  remain  in  the  banking  sector.  The  following  three \nstructural benchmarks under the IMF program in the banking sector \nwere not met: (a) Banks will book the provisioning gap identified by \nthe asset quality review (AQR) and reclassify their assets to the non-\nperforming  category  in  line  with  the  AQR;  (b)  Based  on  the  AQR \nfindings and advice provided by external experts, regulation on asset \nclassification and provisioning to be further improved in consultation \nwith  IMF  staff;  (c)  Financial  Stability  Council  finalization  and \npublication of an non-performing loan (NPL) resolution strategy. The \nrecapitalization of the banks is still incomplete. Banking sector reform \nwill therefore be an important policy area  going forward. Recently, \nthe  BOM  submitted  a  draft  Banking  Sector  Reform  Program  for \n2020\u20132023 for parliamentary discussion. This medium-term program \nincludes  5  core  objectives  and  49  reform  actions,  including  the \nrecapitalization.  The  draft  program  will  address  (i) bank  ownership \nconcentration  and  governance, \n(ii)  modernization  of  bank \nsupervision, (iii) the IMF program, (iv) improvement of the AML-CTF \nsystem,  and  (v)  modern  banking  operations  and  FinTech.    This \nprovides  some  confidence  that  these  issues  are  at  the  top  of  the \npolicy reform agenda. \n \nMongolia has taken decisive action to respond to the COVID-19 \nsituation. Shortly after the initial outbreak in the PRC, the National \nSecurity Council (comprising the President, the Prime Minister, and \nthe  Speaker  of  Parliament)  imposed  restrictions  on  air  travel \nmovements  across  borders  and  nationwide  school  closures  to \nprevent community transmission. \n \n \n\n \n\n4.

Debt Sustainability \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \n\nThe National Emergency Commission (chaired by the Deputy Prime \nMinister)  was  convened  and  is  currently  the  responsible  body \noverseeing  the  government\u2019s  response.  It  issued  six  directives \nbetween  21  February  2020  and  22  March  2020,  which  imposed \nadditional  restrictions  on  international  travel  to  the  point  where \ncurrently  no  commercial  air  routes  are  available  to  enter  or  exit \nMongolia.  Further  measures  included  the  cancellation  of  public \nevents,  mandatory  quarantine  measures,  and  restrictions  on  retail \nservices.  The  government  has  assigned  the  highest  possible  risk \nrating to the emergency under the Law on Disaster Protection. It has \nallocated  $4.3  million  from  the  state  budget  to  respond  to  urgent \nneeds.  The endorsed National Emergency Response Plan  requires  \naround  $240  million  to  support  the  procurement  of  emergency \nmedical equipment, increase surveillance capacity, ensure adequate \nsupply  of  medicines,  strengthen  laboratory  and  testing  protocols, \nand  provide    food,  fuel,  medical  and  other  essential  support  to \nvulnerable populations including.  \n \nin  a  state  of  high  preparedness.  \nThe  country  remains \nRespiratory  diseases  make  up  a  high  proportion  of  the  burden  of \ndisease in Mongolia; the Ministry of Health (MOH) has identified 20% \nof the population (over 772,000 citizens) to be at high risk. The $4.3 \nmillion allocated from the state budget in the first quarter of 2020 has \nbeen used to procure medical equipment and supplies to ensure that \ndedicated hospitals and health institutions can prevent transmission \nand  respond  to  COVID-19  cases.  In  anticipation  of  the  worsening \nemergency,  the  government  is  planning  to  further  increase  the \nexpenditure in the health sector to strengthen the response capacity \nof  local  health  authorities  and  medical  facilities.  In  Ulaanbaatar  as \nwell  as  provincial  level  hospitals,  there  is  a  shortage  of  essential \npriority  equipment  and  medical  supplies.  Overall,  10,000  units  of \npriority  medical  equipment  and  supplies  nationwide  are  needed  to \nrespond to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nThe government is planning medium-term improvements to the \nhealth sector. As part of the National Emergency Response Plan, \nthe government will enhance testing, diagnosis, and disease control \nsystems  in  the  country.  In  addition,  ADB  is  preparing  additional \nfinancing  under  an  existing    operation,a  which  will  increase \ndiagnostic  and  treatment  capacity  of  hospitals  to  manage  Severe \nAcute  Respiratory  Infection    patients,  establish  a  national  medical \ncountermeasures stockpile in Ulaanbaatar , and expand the project \ntertiary  and \nsites \nsecondary hospitals nationwide. \n \nThe countercyclical expenditure plan does not affect the overall \nsustainability  of  Mongolia\u2019s  debt.  The  International  Monetary \nFund  (IMF)  conducted  a  debt  sustainability  analysis  as  part  of  the \nArticle IV Report produced in September 2019.b  \n \nAccording to the IMF, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio under the baseline \nscenario is forecast to fall significantly by 16 percentage points from \n2018 to 2024. The baseline scenario for 2020\u20132024 assumed and \nreflected the following:  \n \n\nfor  upgrading  sterilization  departments \n\nin \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n25 \n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response \nOption: Criteria and Indicators \n \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Assessment \n\n(i)  high nominal GDP growth around 12.5% per annum, based \non a moderate and stable level of real GDP growth of around \n5.4% per annum;  \n\n(ii)  a  moderate  level  of  annual  inflation  of  6.7%,  which  is \nconsistent with the Bank of Mongolia (central bank) current \ninflation target of 8.0% and the medium-term target of 6.0%, \nand a stable exchange rate;  \n\n(iii)  The primary fiscal balance is projected to remain in the range \nof \u20130.5%\u20133.0%, showing no significant and adverse pressure \non the overall fiscal position; and  \n\n(iv)  Mongolia  would  retain  access  to  concessional  budget \nsupport  and  project  loans  so  that  annual  average  effective \ninterest rate remains low at 2.7% over 2020\u20132024. \n\n \nThe  IMF  assessment  also  highlighted  that  the  public  debt  and \nfinancing  needs  are  sensitive  to  shocks  to  (i)  GDP  growth,  (ii) \nexchange  rate  depreciation,  and  (iii)  financial  sector  contingent \nliabilities related to banking sector recapitalization. \n \nSince this assessment was conducted last year, growth forecasts for \nMongolia  have fallen significantly, and fiscal revenues  will decline. \nThe Government of Mongolia\u2019s countercyclical expenditure program \nwill result in an increase in expenditure by 11.7% over the 2019 level. \nConsequently,  the  overall  and  structural \nfiscal  balances  will \ndeteriorate  by  4.1  percentage  points  and  3.4  percentage  points, \nrespectively,  to  deficits  of  2.7%  ($379  million)  and  5.1%  ($713 \nmillion).  \n \nADB,  in  close  consultation  with  the  IMF,  has  calculated  the  public \ndebt\u2013GDP  ratio  for  two  scenarios  and  has  assumed  no  change  in \ncentral bank liabilities. Both scenarios show a temporary increase in \nthe debt\u2013GDP level in 2020 before a return from 2021 to 2025 to the \nprevious  trend  and  downward  trajectory.  This  assumes  that  an \neconomic  recovery  would  start  in  2021,  and  that  there  is  a  stable \ngrowth  trajectory  from  2022\u20132025.  The  ratio  remains  sensitive  to \nrisks associated with GDP growth, balance of payments shocks and \ntheir  impact  on  exchange  rate  and  fiscal  balances,  and  the \nrealization of contingent liabilities. For more detail, please refer to the \nDebt Sustainability Analysis (Linked Document 11). \n \nThe  IMF\u2019s  Extended  Fund  Facility  (EFF)  provides  for  a  regular \nmechanism  for  coordination  and  dialogue  among  international \nfinancial institutions and major development partners. The IMF is in \ndiscussion with the government for a loan from its Rapid Financing \nInstrument  designed  to  provide  support  in  the  event  of  balance  of \npayment challenges. ADB maintains a close ongoing dialogue with \nthe IMF, and this has continued since the onset of the pandemic with \nregular sharing of analysis on the economic situation.  \n \nThe Article IV of September 2019 highlighted the vigorous recovery \nof Mongolia\u2019s economy from the recent downturn. Economic growth \naccelerated to 8.6% in the first quarter of 2019, overall fiscal balance \nturned into surplus in 2018,   Gross \n\n \n\n6.

The \nrecovery stems from a stronger policy framework, significant official \nfinancing,  and a rebound in external demand. Notwithstanding the \nprogress, Mongolia remains vulnerable to external shocks given its \nhigh debt levels and the economy\u2019s dependence on mineral exports. \n \nThe IMF has provided an assessment letter to ADB that updates the \nassessment  of  Mongolia\u2019s  economic  conditions  and  policies  since \nthe 2019 Article IV consultation. As a result of slowing growth in the \nPRC  and  a  fall  in  commodity  prices,  the  Mongolian  economy  had \nalready decelerated in 2019 and now faces strong headwinds due to \nthe global COVID-19 outbreak. To mitigate the negative impact, both \nfiscal  and  monetary  policies  are  poised  to  loosen  materially.  The \nchallenge  will  be  to  support  economic  output  while  preserving \nmacroeconomic  stability.  Key  challenges  include  large  near-term \nexternal  refinancing  needs  and  limited  international  reserves.  The \nsixth  review  under  the  EFF  remains  delayed,  and  the  program  is \nscheduled to expire in May 2020. \n \n\na   ADB. 2012.

The \nplan  is  overseen  by  the  State  Emergency  Commission,  and  the  National \nEmergency  Management  Agency  leads  the  implementation.  The  plan\u2019s  key \nmeasures include the setting of the level of quarantine needed; closures of borders; \nthe  conduct  of  surveys  of  the  current  situation;  the  importation  of  essential \nequipment,  food,  and  fuel;  the  training  of  health  personal  on  emergency \npreparedness; the creation of a database on the health conditions of people aged \n60 and above; and the improvement of health facilities. The protocols are divided \ninto pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic phases. Initial estimates from the \nNational  Emergency  Response  Plan  suggest  overall  needs  are  currently  about \n$240 million, of which $50 million is required for the health sector alone.  \n\nThe  governments  has  introduced  social  distancing  measures  to  contain  the \ndisease, such as a ban on mass gatherings and celebrations, the closure of schools \nuntil  1  September,  partial  closure  of  restaurants  and  bars,  encouragement  to \ncompanies  to  work  from  home,  and  guidance  on  the  use  of  face  masks  and \nhandwashing.  A  hotline  has  been  established  by  the  government  to  support \nsurveillance measures. \n\nNo commercial airlines can travel to Mongolia. Initial restrictions were imposed on \ntravel from the People\u2019s Republic of China in February and have gradually been \nextended to cover all destinations in March. The current ban lasts until 31 May but \nmay be extended further. Some government-organized charter flights have been \narranged to facilitate the return of Mongolian nationals living abroad. Restrictions \nare also in place on internal travel between aimags (provinces). A total of 51,742 \nvehicles and 70,981 passengers have been checked at border points (as of 17 April \n2020). Disinfection and observation protocols are in place at border points. \n\nSince the outbreak, almost 5,000 people have been put under observation. A total \nof 1,687 were under observation as of 17 April 2020. A total of 6,611 individuals \nhad been tested as of 17 April 2020. \n\nIn addition to increased quarantine, observation, and testing, the government will \nincrease  (i)  procurement  and  supply  of  essential  health  care  equipment,  and \nhospital  supplies  for  disinfection  and  decontamination;  (ii)  increase  surveillance \ncapacity;  (iii)  strengthen  laboratory  and  testing  protocols;  (iv)  enable  the  health \nauthorities  to  increase  the  availability  of  frontline  health  workers  to  promptly \nrespond  to  the  crisis;  and  (v)  exempt  drugs  and  health  products  used  for  the \ndiagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 from customs duties and VAT.  \n\nThe  government  is  also  planning  several  measures  to  strengthen  the  health \nsector\u2019s response over the medium term. These include strengthening the number \nof hospitals meeting national standards related to infection prevention and control, \nimproving  national  standards  to  manage  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Infections \npatients, and increasing the speed at which suspected cases are confirmed. ADB \nwill support these measures under a complementary operationb that will increase \ndiagnostic and treatment capacity of hospitals to manage Severe Acute Respiratory \nInfections  patients,  establish  a  national  medical  countermeasures  stockpile  in \nUlaanbaatar, and expand the project sites for upgrading sterilization departments \nin tertiary and secondary hospitals nationwide. \n\nSocial protection \nmeasures \n\nThe  government  has  announced  several  measures  under  the  Countercyclical \nDevelopment Expenditure Program (CDEP) to support the most vulnerable groups. \nThese measures are as follows: \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nEconomic \nmeasures \n\ni. \n\nIt  will  increase  monthly  cash  grants  to  children  under  the  Child  Money \nProgram  by  50%  to  MNT30,000  per  child  (aged  0\u201317)  per  month  for  3 \nmonths until the end of June. This reaches 59.8% of households and 93.6% \nof all children. \n\nii.  Private  sector  workers  will  be  exempt  from  income  tax  payments  for  a \n\nperiod of 6 months. This will reach 699,753 vulnerable employees. \n\niii.  Companies whose activities have been stopped because of the government \nrestrictions for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic will receive \na monthly stipend of MNT200,000 for employee they have been retained in \ntheir jobs.  \nIndividuals will receive reimbursement of the value-added tax (VAT) paid in \nthe first quarter of 2020. This is expected to benefit 860,000 citizens, each \ngaining an average of MNT47,000. \n\niv. \n\nADB  is  preparing  an  additional  operation  to  further  support  the  government  in \nextending and expanding the social protection response. \n\nThe  second  component  of  the  CDEP  is  the  main  vehicle  for  government-led \nstimulus  measures.  These  measures  include  a  6-month  exemption  from  the \npayment  of  social  insurance  for  businesses  affected  by  COVID-19;  a  6-month \nholiday  from  the  payment  of  corporate  income  tax  for  affected  businesses;  a  2-\nmonth  deferment  of  customs  duties  and  VAT  due  on  staple  products,  including \nimported goods such as rice, wheat, sugar, and vegetable oil; increased access to \nguarantees on loans of less than MNT30 million; tax exemptions on lease revenue \nfor  entities  that  voluntarily  reduced  lease  rates  for  businesses  affected  by  the \neconomic  situation;  concessional  loans  for  cashmere  producers;  and  a  50% \nreduction on the purchase of agricultural equipment.  \n\nThe Bank of Mongolia has taken several measures to ease credit conditions. These \ninclude  cutting  the  policy  interest  rate  to  9.0%,  allowing  commercial  banks  to \npostpone  consumer  loan  and  housing  mortgage  loan  repayments  by  3  to  12 \nmonths;  easing  asset  classification  and  provisioning  regulatory  requirements; \nreducing  the  minimum  liquidity  ratio  to  20%;  and  reducing  the  MNT  reserve \nrequirement to 8.5%.     \nFurther, the BOM is submitting a draft Banking Sector Reform Program for 2020\u2013\n2023  for  parliamentary  discussion  and  approval.  This  medium-term  program \nincludes  5  core  objectives  and  49  reform  actions,  including  banking  sector \nrecapitalization. The draft  program will  address (i) bank ownership concentration \nand governance, (ii) the modernization of bank supervision; (iii) the IMF program; \n(iv) the improvement of the AML-CTF system; and (v) modern banking operations \nand FinTech. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CDEP = Countercyclical Development Expenditure Program \na Government of Mongolia.

However, inflation has been below the Bank of Mongolia (BOM)\u2019s target since July \n2015 and has remained consistent with the target since the (Figure A6.1).  \n \n2. \nIn  2018  and  2019,  annual  inflation  moved  closer  to  the  BOM  target  due  to  economic \nrecovery, supply-side factors, and exchange rate pass through on imported goods and services. \nInflation moderated towards the end of 2019 and in 2020 in response to slower economic growth, \nsignificantly lower credit growth, the fading impact of supply shocks and a more stable exchange \nrate. The continued increase in foreign exchange reserves since 2017 has enabled reserves to \nreach 5.8 months of merchandise goods and services import cover, which has positively affected \nforeign exchange market expectations (Figure A6.2).  \n \n3. \nAs  of  March  2020,  inflation  reached  6.4%,  and  annual  average  inflation  is  expected  to \nmoderate  from  7.3%  in  2019  to  6.6%  in  2020  according  to  Asian  Development  Bank  ADB \nforecasts1 as  the  economy  slows,  demand-pull  inflationary  pressure  falls,  and  the  demand  for \nforeign exchange decreases in line with reduced imports of goods and services. The International \nMonetary Fund, World Bank, and the BOM\u2019s inflation forecasts in 2020 all remained lower than \nthe targeted level of inflation.   \n \n\nFigure A6.1: Inflation and policy rate (%) \n\nFigure A6.2: Exchange rate and FX reserves \n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\nPolicy rate\n\nCentral bank target\n\nAnnual\ninflation\n\n12-month \u2026\n\n2900\n\n2600\n\n2300\n\n2000\n\n1700\n\n1400\n\nMNT/USD \nexchange rate, \nLHS\n\nGross FX \nreserves, RHS \n($ billion)\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n0\n2\n0\n2\n\n \nSources:  The  Bank  of  Mongolia.  2020.
