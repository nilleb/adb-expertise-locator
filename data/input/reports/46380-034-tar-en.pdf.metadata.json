(ii) the Eastern Indonesia Electricity Grid Development Program Phase II (EGDP II); (iii) \nthe Eastern Indonesia Power Transmission Sector Project (PTSP); and (iv) the Geothermal Power \nDevelopment Project (GPDP).  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nPGSP will support multiple small- to medium-sized natural gas-fired power plants \nacross  Eastern  Indonesia.  It  will  help  move  the  country  away  from  using  highly \npolluting and expensive diesel fuel and transition to using natural gas, combined \nwith variable renewable energy such as solar and wind. The project is expected \nfor Board consideration in 2018 for $600 million from ADB regular OCR and $35 \nmillion  from  the  ASEAN  Infrastructure  Fund.  The  program  is  included  in  the \nCountry Operations Business Plan (COBP) 2018-2020. The outcome of the project \nwill  be  expanded  access  to  modern  and  cleaner  energy  services  in  Eastern \nIndonesia. The outputs are (i) gas-fired generation capacity in Eastern Indonesia \ninstalled;  (ii)  pilot  gas-solar  hybrid  power  generation  units  installed,  and  (iii) \ninstitutional capacity enhanced for the utilization of natural gas for small- to mid-\nscale power generation and operation of gas-solar hybrid systems. \n  \nEGDP  II  is  a  result-based  lending  (RBL)  program  and  will  support  power \ndistribution operations in Kalimantan, following Phase I of EGDP approved in 2017 \nwhich covers Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara. The program is included in the COBP \n2018-2020  for  $300  million.  The  outcome  is  equitable  access  to  electricity  for \nKalimantan\u2019s  population.  The  outputs  are  (i)  distribution  system  expanded,  (ii) \nclean  energy  &  energy  efficiency  enhanced,  and  (iii)  institutional  capacity  and \nsocial monitoring enhanced.  \n\nPTSP aims to support the development of 150 kV and 70 kV high voltage power \ntransmission  systems  across  Eastern  Indonesia.  The  project  is  listed  in  COBP \n2018-2020  for  $800  million.  Outputs  include  rehabilitation,  upgrading  and \nexpansion of 150 kV and 70 kV transmission lines; and 150/70 kV, 150/20 kV and \n70/20  kV  substations  in  the  provinces:  Kalimantan,  Sulawesi,  Nusa  Tenggara, \nMaluku and Papua.  \n\nGPDP aims to support expansion of two geothermal power plants in Java, which \nwill contribute to Indonesia\u2019s efforts to increase renewable energy use and reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The outcome will be increased power generation from \ngeothermal  resources  and  lower  carbon  emissions.  The  outputs  include  the \nconstruction  and commissioning  of  additional geothermal generating capacity  at \ntwo existing geothermal power plants of 55 megawatts each. A transaction TA and \nthe proposed $300 million regular OCR allocation for the project are included in \nthe COBP 2018-2020.  \n\n \n2. \nThe  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  also  support  the  implementation  of  the  Eastern \nIndonesia Electricity Grid Development Program (EGDP) RBL program approved by the Board in \n\n                                                \n1  The government  uses the  term  \u201cEastern  Indonesia\u201d  to cover  all  those  islands  outside  Bali, Java, Madura, and  \n   Sumatra, specifically, provinces in Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, Papua, and Sulawesi. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nSeptember 2017. The TA will specifically support the implementation of three disbursement-linked \nindicators dedicated to innovation and institutional strengthening. \n  \n3. \nThese ensuing and ongoing projects are focused on the Indonesian electricity sector and \nrequire thorough and consistent understanding of relevant policies, regulations, and actors. TA \nactivities  will  involve similar  preparation,  due  diligence,  design, readiness,  and implementation \nsupport activities. Therefore, this TRTA Facility will reduce transaction costs through minimizing \nthe need for stand-alone TRTAs. \n \n\nII. \n\n THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (TRTA FACILITY) \n\nA. \n\nOverall Progress of the TA Cluster \n\n4. \nThe  Technical  Assistance  Cluster  (C\u2013TA)  0013\u2013INO:  for  the  Sustainable  Infrastructure \nAssistance Program (SIAP) is financed by the Government of Australia through the Department \nof  Foreign  Affairs  and Trade,  and  administered by  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB).   SIAP \nwas approved on 17 June 2013 and is due to close on 30 June 2019. As of 25 July 2018, total \ncommitments  are  $13,040,712  (73%  of  total  approvals  against  time  elapsed  of  85%),  and \ndisbursements are $9,034,972 (69% of commitments). Thirteen subprojects have been approved. \nFour of these are now closed. SIAP is on track to meet its outcome and outputs, including the \npreparation and implementation of approved ADB projects and programs in Indonesia of more \nthan $5 billion. As of 25 July 2018, C\u2013TA 0013\u2013INO: SIAP has an available balance of $2,377,816, \nincluding the ADB management fee and foreign exchange reservations. \n \nB. \n\nSubproject Scope \n\n5. \nThe  role  of  the  energy  sector  as  a  key  enabler  of  inclusive  growth  has  become  more \nimportant  as  the  Government  of  Indonesia  is  faced  with  the  challenge  of  diversifying  and \nexpanding  its  economy  which  has  hovered  around  5%  annual  growth.  Improved  access  to \naffordable and sustainable forms of energy is critical to enhance competitiveness, not only in the \ncountry\u2019s  manufacturing  and  commercial  centers,  but  also  in  remote  areas.  Lack  of  access  to \nenergy constrains efforts to transform the eastern part of Indonesia into a new economic growth \nengine with a focus on high-value agriculture, fisheries, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and \ntourism, all of which rely on a stable energy supply. Uneven development across provinces has \ncontributed  toward  widening  income  disparities,  with  several  provinces  in  Eastern  Indonesia \nlagging significantly behind Java and Bali.2 \n \n6. \nTo address this, the government has prioritized accelerating investment in infrastructure, \nwhich  explicitly  includes  the  \u201couter\u201d  and  eastern  regions  as  geographical  priorities.  One  of  its \npillars is to significantly improve access to electricity services by adding generation capacity and \nexpanding  power  grids  to  raise  the  national  electrification  ratio  from  89%  in  2016  to  100%  by \n2024. Eastern Indonesia, where power grids across the islands are isolated, of poor quality, and \nunderdeveloped,  presents  the  greatest  challenge  to  the  achievement  of  these  targets.  The \nelectrification ratios in some eastern provinces are particularly low\u201461% in West Sulawesi, 67% \nin Southeast Sulawesi, 76% in West Nusa Tenggara, 52% in East Nusa Tenggara, and 50% in \nPapua.3 Moreover, these areas are mainly serviced, if at all, by diesel-fired generators which are \ninefficient, polluting, and expensive. Power disruptions due to supply shortages are common and \nhousehold consumption levels remain suppressed. \n                                                \n2  For example, Jakarta\u2019s 2016 nominal per capita gross regional domestic product ($15,670) was 13 times higher than \n\nthat of East Nusa Tenggara ($1,197). \n\n3  PLN. 2016. PLN Statistik. Jakarta. \n\n \n\n\f \n7. \nThe  series  of  loans  supported  by  this  TA  aim  to  support  the  development  of  electricity \ntransmission and distribution networks to connect businesses and households and enhance the \nquality of life in remote regions across Indonesia, scale up the use of natural gas which is cleaner \nand more efficient than diesel fuel commonly used in remote areas today, and accelerate the use \nof Indonesia\u2019s vast geothermal, solar, and wind resources to help the country reduce its carbon \nemissions.  One  of the  advantages  of  using gas-fired generators  is that  they  can  respond  very \nrapidly to fluctuating power demand. This characteristic can be tapped to integrate intermittent \nrenewable energy systems while reducing the need for large battery storage and thus help make \nuse of solar and wind resources more affordable and reliable to the local communities. The loans \nwill  require  technical,  financial,  economic,  environment,  social,  governance  and  legal  and \nregulatory due diligence.  \n \nC. \n\nSubproject Outputs and Activities   \n\n8. \nOutput 1: Power sector projects and programs prepared. Technical expertise will be \nprovided to prioritize, plan, and prepare a series of investment projects for potential ADB financing. \nThis will enhance the efficiency of project preparation, address cross-common issues among the \nprojects,  and  will  reduce  the  transaction  costs  through  minimizing  the  need  for  stand-alone \ntransaction TAs. Detailed activities will include, as required: (i) feasibility studies; (ii) economic \nanalysis; (iii) financial management assessments, financial evaluation and financial analysis; (iv) \nprocurement assessments, procurement plans, and preparation of bidding documents; (v) gender \nanalysis,  collection  of  baseline  data,  and  gender  action  plans;  (vi)  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement  plans;  and  (vii)  safeguards  documents  on  environment,  involuntary  resettlement \nand indigenous peoples. \n \n9. \nOutput  2:  Innovation  and  institutional  capacity  enhanced.  The  TA  will  support  the \nimplementation of loan components on technological innovation, institutional strengthening, and \nknowledge sharing. These will include technical experts to support the development of smart grid \nguidelines  and  design  pilot  projects,  as  well  as  safeguards  specialists  to  improve  waste \nmanagement and stakeholder consultation practices under the Eastern Indonesia Electricity Grid \nDevelopment  Program  (EGDP  for  Sulawesi  and  Nusa  Tenggara).  Experts  will  also  provide \ntechnical support for the Eastern Indonesia Power Generation Sector Project to accelerate the \nimplementation of subprojects and provide technical inputs for the solar\u2013gas hybrid pilot projects. \nThe  TA  will  also  support  knowledge  development  and  sharing  between  PLN,  government \nministries, and other key stakeholders for policy and regulatory development and energy sector \nplanning,  particularly  related  to  increasing  natural  gas  and  renewable  energy  use  in  Eastern \nIndonesia. \n \nD. \n\nSubproject Cost and Financing \n\n10. \nThe  TRTA  subproject  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,530,000,  of  which  $1,500,000  will  be \nfinanced from the C-TA 0013\u2013INO: SIAP on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  key  expenditure  items  are  listed  in  Appendix  1.  The  government, \nincluding  its  State-Owned  Enterprises,  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncommunication  facilities  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  government  was  informed  that \napproval of the subproject does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nSubproject Implementation Arrangements \n\n11. \nThe TA activities for ensuing investment projects and programs will commence only after \nthe concept paper for the associated project and program is approved by ADB. Concept papers \nfor the EGDP II, PTSP, and GPDP are expected to be approved in the second half of 2018.  \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s Energy Division, Southeast Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants\u2019 outputs for the respective loan projects. PLN will be the executing agency with PLN \nand Geo Dipa Energi (GDE) as the implementing agencies. ADB will administer the TA and be \nresponsible  for  consultant  recruitment  in  consultation  with  PLN  and  GDE.  PLN  and  GDE  will \nmobilize  its  staff  to  participate  in  undertaking  analytical  work  and  provide  documents,  mission \nfacilitation, and other support to carry out the activities. \n\n \nTable 1: Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects  \nIndicative implementation period \n\nArrangements \nJune 2018\u2013June 2019 \n\nExecuting agency \n\nPLN \n\nImplementing agency \n\nPLN & GDE  \n\nConsultants \n\nIndividual consultants \n\n46 person-months \n\n$584,984 \n\nTo be selected and engaged by ADB  \n\nProcurement \n\nDisbursement \n\nFirm through QCBS (90:10) \n\n54 person-months \n\n$827,711 \n\nADB will engage consultants and all technical assistance financed goods \nshall be procured in accordance with ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and the associated Project Administration \nInstructions/TA Staff Instructions. \n\nThe TA will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n\nAsset Turnover of Disposal \nArrangement upon TA Completion \n\nAssets purchased under the transaction technical assistance will be \nhanded over to PLN \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, GDE = Geo Dipa Energi,  PLN = State Electricity Corporation, QCBS = quality- and \ncost-based selection, TA = technical assistance   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n Consulting services.
