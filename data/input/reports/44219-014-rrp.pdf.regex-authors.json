THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Norway, and \n(iii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the ADB Strategic Climate Fund \n(SCF),1 all to Nepal for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Power System \nExpansion Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting \nRural Electrification through Renewable Energy, and if the Board approves the proposed loan \nand administration of the grants, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the TA.2   \n \n2.  The project is designed to assist Nepal\u2019s energy sector development by facilitating (i) \nexpansion  of  domestic  power  transmission  capacity,  (ii)  power  exchange  with  India,  (iii) \naugmentation and expansion of the distribution networks, and (iv) mini-grid-based renewable \nenergy access in rural areas.3 The project is prioritized as part of the South Asia Subregional \nEconomic  Cooperation  Program\u2019s  Power  Generation  and  Transmission  Master  Plan  and \nRegional Cooperation Business Plan, 2014\u20132016.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Nepal is facing chronic power shortages. Only 65% of the country\u2019s households have \naccess to electricity\u201456% through the national grid and 9% through off-grid solutions. Per \ncapita electricity consumption is 102 kilowatt-hours per year, one of the lowest in the world. The \ninstalled capacity is 762 megawatts (MW), well below the peak demand of 1,095 MW. As a \nresult, consumers connected to the national grid experience scheduled power cuts of 12 hours \nper day or more during the dry season. With the expected commissioning of six hydropower \nprojects with a combined capacity of 732 MW in the next 3 to 6 years and more than 1,500 MW \nof additional capacity being developed, a wet season supply surplus is anticipated by 2018.5 \nHowever, the limited power transmission and distribution network is becoming a bottleneck for \nmeeting domestic power demand, as well as power trade with neighboring countries.  \n \n4.  The Government of Nepal has set the following key targets to be met by year 2027: (i) \nincreasing per capita electricity consumption to 400 kilowatt-hours per year, (ii) commissioning \n4,000 MW of generation capacity, (iii) providing electricity to 75% of the population through the \nnational  grid  and  25%  through  decentralized  generation  solutions,  and  (iv)  developing \nexportable power capacity.6 Steps have been taken to meet these targets: a master plan for \nhydropower with annual storage capacity has been prepared; the transmission system master \nplan is being updated; a distribution system and rural electrification master plan has been \noutlined by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA); and a long-term agreement for bulk power \ntrading  with  India  is  being  negotiated.  Parallel  institutional  improvements  are  needed.  An \nincremental retail tariff increase of 20% during 2002\u20132012 improved NEA\u2019s financial position, \n                                                \n1  Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries financed by the Strategic Climate \nFund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA.

Manila. \n5  The total installed capacity will be more than 3,000 MW against the projected peak load of 2,052 MW in FY2020. \n6  Government of Nepal. 2010. Three Year Interim Plan (2010\u20132013). Kathmandu. ", "2     \nbut it is still weak because tariffs do not reflect costs.7 In addition, system planning capacity \nneeds to be improved; NEA\u2019s generation, transmission, and distribution departments need to be \nring-fenced8 as a precursor to further corporate restructuring; and a fully independent regulatory \nagency needs to be established.  \n \n5.  To achieve the 25% electrification target through off-grid solutions, the government has \nenacted policies and plans such as the Rural Energy Policy 2006, Subsidy Policy for Renewable \n(Rural) Energy 2009\u20132013, Renewable (Rural) Energy Subsidy Delivery Mechanism 2013, and \nDelivery Mechanism of Additional Financial Support to Micro/Mini Hydro Project 2011. Enabling \nmeasures such as targeted grants (subsidies) and exemption of renewable energy projects from \ncertain licensing requirements have been set up. These activities are being coordinated and \nimplemented under the National Rural and Renewable Energy Program, a  government-led \n\u201csingle window\u201d program for off-grid renewable energy supported by development partners.  \n \n6.  The project will contribute to Nepal\u2019s energy development objectives by (i) scaling up the \non-grid and off-grid renewable energy supply, (ii) facilitating cross-border power exchange, (iii) \nincreasing access to renewable energy in rural areas, and (iv) building capacity for on-grid and \noff-grid power sector development. The on-grid components will be able to evacuate 2,000 MW \nof new generation outputs along the Kali Gandaki corridor and Marsyangdi corridor9 to the main \nload centers at Kathmandu Valley, and facilitate at least 1,200 MW of power exports to India \nonce the second 400 kilovolt (kV) cross-border transmission line from Bardaghat (Nepal) to \nGorakhpur (India) is connected.10 Half of the exports will come from the Upper Marsyangdi 2 \nHydropower Project, which is to be developed by GMR Group, India. The off-grid component \nwill provide access to electricity and facilitate productive energy use activities in rural locations \nwithout connections to the national grid, increasing the income and welfare of rural communities \nby using renewable energy mainly for agriculture, rural enterprises, health, and education.11 The \nproject is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for \nNepal, which aims to (i) improve inclusive electricity access, (ii) develop renewable energy, (iii) \npromote  regional  cooperation,  and  (iv)  strengthen  sector  governance.12 The  sector  and \nprogrammatic context of the project is presented in a supplementary document.13 \n \n7.  ADB interventions. In 2009, 2011, and 2013, ADB approved four projects14 to address \nthe immediate needs for the power sector, including generation, transmission, and distribution \nsystem  expansion  and  improvement.  Capacity  development  TA  attached  to  the  Tanahu \nHydropower Project was approved in 2013 and is being implemented to support NEA\u2019s financial \n                                                \n7  NEA incurred a net loss of NRs4.53 billion in 2013.  \n8  Financially separated in terms of assets and/or profits. \n9 The Marsyangdi Corridor transmission line could have been assigned to a private developer that is considering \nbuilding a 600 MW hydropower plant in Nepal. Although the proposal has many merits, NEA opted for a purely \npublic facility. The rationale is to offer all private investors power evacuation facilities on a national and equal basis. \n10 The feasibility study for the second cross-border transmission line is being funded by ADB. 2013.

The project \nwill supplement ADB\u2019s ongoing interventions by enhancing NEA\u2019s financial position through the \nimplementation of a pricing mechanism for the use of NEA\u2019s power grid by third parties for \nelectricity exports, as well as improvements in NEA\u2019s planning capacity by supporting initiatives \nincluding the preparation of the distribution system and rural electrification master plan.  \n \n8.  Lessons from ongoing projects. Since 2009, ADB operations in Nepal\u2019s power sector \nhave  been  instrumental  in  supporting  the  reform  process,  including  preparation  of  NEA\u2019s \nfinancial restructuring and a tariff increase of 20% after 11 years. However, the implementation \nof the ongoing projects, including the procurement of consultants and contractors, has been \nslow. NEA\u2019s decision making has also been slow. Land acquisition has been a problem, mostly \nbecause of changes in the alignment of transmission lines. Project readiness has been low. \nThese lessons have been integrated into the design of this project. A project management \ndirectorate will manage the project. The directorate, headed by a deputy managing director level \nofficer, will be responsible for procurement and construction supervision of all ADB projects.15 \nThe project preparatory TA includes a consulting firm to help NEA with the detailed design, \nroute surveys, preparation of bidding documents, and selection of turnkey contractors. A project \nsupervision consulting firm, funded by the project, will oversee construction. The implementation \nschedule will be longer than the standard 5 years. The S curve for disbursement16 is realistic \nand takes into account the difficulties encountered in project implementation in Nepal.  \n \n9.  Coordination with other development partners. The project has been developed in \ncoordination with the NEA; the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC); the Ministry of \nEnergy; the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment; the Government of Norway and \nthe Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation; the European Investment Bank (EIB); the \nGovernment  of  Denmark;  and  the  German  Development  Bank.  The  project  components \ncomplement the operations of the World Bank Group and the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency.17 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project's impact will be increased electricity access in Nepal and improved power \nexchange across the border. The outcome will be increased capacity of the national power grid \nand enhanced renewable energy development.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The project will have four outputs:  \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Power  transmission  capacity  increased.  This  comprises  (a) \nconstruction and/or augmentation of 45.0 kilometers (km) of 400 kV and 191.5 \nkm  of  220  kV  transmission  lines  along  the  Kali  Gandaki  corridor  and  the \nMarsyangdi\u2013Kathmandu  route;  (b)  construction  and/or  augmentation  of  500 \nmegavolt-ampere (MVA) of 400 kV/220 kV/132 kV, 500 MVA of 220 kV/132 \n                                                \n15 Details are in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 A display in curve of projected cumulative disbursement amount plotted against time of project implementation. \n17 The World Bank is supporting the Dhalkebar (Nepal)\u2013Muzarffarpur (India) 400 kV cross-border transmission line. \n ", "4     \nkV/33 kV, and 120 MVA of 33 kV/11 kV grid substations along the Kali Gandaki \ncorridor  and  Marsyangdi\u2013Kathmandu  route;  and  (c)  construction  and/or \nreplacement of grid service substations with an aggregate capacity of 393.8 MVA \nacross the country.18 \n(ii)  Output  2:  Power  distribution  network  improved.  This  comprises  the \nconstruction and/or upgrading of 410 km of 33 kV, 545 km of 11 kV, and 725 km \nof  400-volt  distribution  lines;  216  MVA  33kV/11kV  substations;  and  20  MVA \ndistribution substations in the east, central, and west regions.  \n(iii)  Output  3:  Mini-grid-based  renewable  energy  systems  in  off-grid  areas \nincreased. This includes installation of up to 4.3 MW of mini hydroelectric power \nplants  and  up to  0.5 MW of  mini-grid-based solar  or  solar  and  wind  hybrid \nsystems in selected rural communities through the provision of (a) a credit line of \n$5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds to user communities for mini-hydro power \nplants, and (b) a $10 million grant from the SCF administered by ADB.19 \n(iv)  Output  4:  Capacity  development  for  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  and \nAlternative Energy Promotion Centre provided. The physical investments will \nbe  reinforced  and  supplemented  by  capacity  building  for  NEA  and  AEPC, \nincluding support for project management; preparation of a distribution system \nand rural electrification master plan, as well as a feasibility study of a large-scale \nwind farm; and parallel livelihood development activities in the project area. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $440 million including physical and price contingencies \nand interest during implementation. The investment plan is summarized in Table 1. Detailed \ncost estimates are in the project administration manual (PAM).20  \n \n13.  The government has requested a loan of $180.0 million in various currencies equivalent \nto SDR116.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project.21 The loan \nwill have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  ADB  will  finance  the  interest  during \nconstruction. \n \n14.  The government also requested cofinancing of $191.2 million, comprising a loan of \n$120.0 million from the EIB,22 a grant of $60.0 million equivalent from the Government of \nNorway,23 and a grant of $11.2 million from the ADB SCF. The funds from the Government of \nNorway and the ADB SCF will be administered by ADB.24 ADB and the Government of Norway \nwill conclude a joint contractual cofinancing agreement, while ADB and EIB will conclude an \n                                                \n18 In addition, the EIB will provide parallel cofinancing for the construction of 125 km of a 220 kV transmission line and \n400 MVA of 220 kV/132 kV/33 kV substations along the Marsyangdi corridor, and 24 km of a 132 kV transmission \nline, and 30 MVA 132 kV/33 kV and 6/8 MVA of 33 kV/11 kV substations for Samundratar\u2013Trishuli 3B Hub \ntransmission line. \n19 Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries financed by the SCF, Nepal has been \nselected as a pilot country for funding and TA. The government prepared the Scaling Up Renewable Energy \nProgram Investment Plan, which was endorsed by the governing trust fund committee of the SCF in November \n2011. Outputs 3 and 4 will be implemented as integral parts of the National Rural and Renewable Energy Program. \n20 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 This includes $70 million from the allocation for regional cooperation and integration projects. \n22 The EIB cofinancing is parallel and will not be administered by ADB. \n23 The Government of Norway will provide cofinancing in Norwegian kroner. \n24 ADB  and  ADB-administered  funds  will  finance  transportation  and  insurance  costs.

The implementation arrangements are in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements  \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2015\u2013December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021 (loan and grant closing on 30 June 2022) \nManagement \n)  (i) Oversight body  Steering committee chaired by the secretary of Ministry of Energy and co-chaired \nby the secretary of Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment  \ni)  (ii) Executing agencies  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  (NEA)  and  Alternative  Energy  Promotion  Centre \n(AEPC) \nii)  (iii) Implementation units   Project management unit established in NEA and project implementation unit \nestablished  in  AEPC,  with  25  (NEA)  and  8  (AEPC)  professional  staff  and \nsupporting staff.  \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  6 packages  $217.0 million \nNational competitive bidding  16 packages  $13.70 million \nShopping  6 packages  $0.60 million \nConsulting services   Quality- and cost-based selection  300 person-months  $8.4 million \n(90:10) for firms \nIndividual  80 person-months  $0.8 million \nAdvance contracting   All eligible contract packages and expenditures ADB and the government agreed \nupon relating to all outputs \nDisbursement  The loan and grants (including ADB administered cofinancing) will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from \ntime to time) and arrangements ADB and the government agree upon. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.  The  project  will  be  implemented  over  7  years from the  date  of  loan  effectiveness. \nConsultants (individuals and firm) to be financed by ADB funds and ADB-administered funds will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended from time to time). Procurement to be financed by ADB funds and ADB-administered \nfunds will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Since ADB is administering cofinancing resources in the form of grants from \nthe Government of Norway and the SCF for operations financed by the Asian Development \nFund (ADF), universal procurement will apply to all procurement packages to be financed by \nADF resources, jointly by ADF resources and the grant from Norway, and by the SCF grant.27 \n \n18.  The government has asked ADB to approve advance contracting for procurement of \ngoods and turnkey works, and for recruitment of consultants. The government has been advised \nthat ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. The \ngovernment has requested ADB assistance in selecting the project supervision consultant. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n19.  The  project  will  be  supported  by  capacity  development  TA  for  Supporting  Rural \nElectrification  through  Renewable  Energy. 28  The  Ministry  of  Science,  Technology  and \nEnvironment will be the executing agency. AEPC and NEA will be the implementing agencies. \n                                                \n27 ADB. 2013.

The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The TA will examine \nthe feasibility of a large-scale wind farm (minimum aggregated installed capacity of 1 MW) in \nNepal, and prepare draft regulations for implementing the Renewable Energy Promotion Board \nAct. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  Technical due diligence has been undertaken on all components and confirmed that the \ncost estimates are reasonable and unit costs compare favorably with similar recent projects in \nIndia and Nepal. The proposed technologies and design concepts are similar to NEA\u2019s existing \ntechnologies and practices for transmission system design, construction, and operation, except \nthat NEA has no experience with high-temperature, low-sag conductors.29 AEPC staff is familiar \nwith  the  technologies  and  concepts for  all the  subprojects  of  the  off-grid  component. The \ncapacity development component will provide technical support to NEA and AEPC for designing \nand commissioning the subprojects. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n21.  Financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects.30 All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in \nconstant 2014 prices. The NEA\u2019s weighted average cost of capital was estimated at 1.2% (in \npre-tax real terms). Based on conservative assumptions adopted for base case analysis, a one-\noff real tariff increase of 20% and continuing annual real increases of 1.4% are required to \nensure the financial viability of the project in aggregate with a financial internal rate of return of \n1.4%.31 The financial internal rate of return will rise to 3.2% if wheeling power from the Upper \nMarsyangdi 2 hydropower station to India through transmission facilities is considered.32  \n \n22.  The project has been analyzed for economic viability using a with- and without-project \napproach in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.33 The \neconomic internal rate of return of the project is 22%. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project \nreturns are robust against changes to critical variables with a minimum economic internal rate of \nreturn of 16%.34 The on-grid components will support new clean energy supplies of at least 200 \nMW for domestic use\u2014sufficient for the minimum needs of at least 2 million people\u2014and \nfacilitate exchange of at least 1,200 MW with India. The off-grid component will help 30,500 \nhouseholds to access electricity in off-grid areas. Mainly because of the displacement of fossil \nfuel and kerosene-based lighting system in off-grid areas, about 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide \nwill be reduced annually.  \n \n                                                \n29 Technical Notes on High-Temperature, Low-Sag Conductors (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n30 ADB. 2005.

Procurement capacity assessments of NEA and AEPC were conducted as part of the \ndue diligence. The NEA has sufficient experience in local and foreign procurement, including \nADB  standard  bidding  procedures  under  domestic  projects  and  external  assistance  from \ninternational development partners. AEPC has experience in local and foreign procurement \nunder domestic projects and external assistance from international development partners. As \nthis will be AEPC\u2019s first direct experience with ADB funding, a long-term procurement consultant \nwill be engaged to provide support. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government, NEA, and AEPC. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  The project interventions are designed to benefit the poor through increased economic \nopportunity, knowledge, and rights. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. \nA gender equality and social inclusion plan has been prepared.35 Enhanced electricity access \nwill  help  reduce  poverty  including  women\u2019s  time  poverty.  The  executing  agencies  and \ncontractors will ensure that priority and preference are given to local workers, especially the \npoor,  the  disadvantaged,  and  marginalized  ethnic  groups.  The  project  will  promote  and \nadvocate for a socially inclusive, gender-equitable, and non-discriminatory work environment \nand practices. Practices will be consistent with core labor standards. Where worker migration is \nrequired,  the  project  will  minimize  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  through  information  dissemination \ncampaigns at project areas. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  Environment (category B). Initial environmental examinations and an environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  for  future  unidentified  off-grid  subprojects  have  been \nprepared for both on- and off-grid components following ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  and  the  government's  environmental  regulatory  framework.36 Potential  impacts  are \nmostly temporary and reversible, but some irreversible impacts on the natural habitat will occur \nbecause of the clearance of about 150 hectares of forested land. Available information on the \nhabitat ranges and elevations of sensitive species indicates that critical habitat will not be \ndirectly impacted; potential impacts on natural habitat and potentially sensitive ecosystems have \nbeen identified and can be readily mitigated. Due diligence has determined that associated \nhydropower facilities comply with Nepal\u2019s regulatory requirements. Cumulative and induced \nimpacts will have net positive benefits from easier access to energy and productive end uses of \nenergy. Climate change risk screening was conducted and resulted to a medium climate change \nclassification. Risks identified will be addressed through best practice engineering design.37  \n \n26.  The initial environmental examinations and environmental management plans (EMPs) \nfor all components include mitigation measures, monitoring, and budgetary provisions that are \nadequate to address the environmental impacts of the project. The EMPs\u2019 requirements will be \nincorporated into bidding documents. The NEA and AEPC have sufficient capacity to supervise \nconstruction contracts and EMP implementation, including preparation of semiannual monitoring \nreports. The EMPs will be updated as necessary during implementation. Public consultation and \ninformation disclosure requirements have been met, including requirements for consultation with \n                                                \n35 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Initial Environmental Examination; Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2) \n ", "9 \nthe management teams for protected areas. The environmental assessment for the project was \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 28 February 2014.  \n \n27.  Involuntary resettlement (category A) and indigenous peoples (category B). The \nproject  will  require  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement,  which  will  primarily  be \neconomic displacements with limited impact from physical displacement. The transmission and \ndistribution components will have permanent and temporary impacts. Permanent impacts are \nanticipated  from  land  acquisition  for  the  construction  of  new  transmission  substations, \ndistribution substations, transmission towers, and distribution poles.  The temporary impacts will \nbe from the loss of trees and crops along the right-of-way. About 715 households will be \naffected by land acquisition and loss of crops and trees. An initial assessment shows that the \nproject areas do not have any endangered indigenous peoples groups. The magnitude of the \nimpacts on indigenous peoples is not significant. Impacts are limited to loss of portions of land \nfor some indigenous peoples which will be compensated at replacement cost. Where these \ngroups  are  considered  vulnerable,  additional  resettlement  assistance  will  be  provided,  in \naddition to the compensation, and consultations will be carried out to make them aware of the \nproject and to obtain their endorsement for land acquisition.  \n \n28.  Based on surveys, two draft combined resettlement and indigenous peoples plans have \nbeen prepared for the on-grid components, in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nthe  government\u2019s  legal  framework.38 These  plans  will  be  publicly  disclosed  to  interested \nstakeholders on the ADB and NEA websites.  \n \n29.  The off-grid component will not have any resettlement impacts for sample subprojects \nand no adverse impacts on indigenous peoples.39 The minimum private land requirements for \nthe sample subprojects will be met through voluntary land donation. A due diligence report has \nbeen prepared for the sample subprojects. The off-grid component allows for future subprojects, \nwhich have not been identified and are subject to due diligence. Therefore, a resettlement \nframework40 and an indigenous peoples planning framework41 have been prepared as required \nby the Safeguard Policy Statement and related national policies and legislation. AEPC will \nmonitor the implementation of the resettlement and indigenous people plan, and will submit \nsemiannual reports to ADB.  \n \n30.  Social safeguards measures will be achieved in line with the provisions stated in the \nPAM.42 A summary of the initial social safeguards assessment is presented in the summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy.43 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.44 The project benefits are expected to \noutweigh the associated risks. \n                                                \n38 Combined Resettlement Plan and Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n39 No impacts on indigenous peoples groups are foreseen for the off-grid component. If impacts are identified, AEPC \nwill prepare an indigenous peoples plan, identifying fair and inclusive compensation and rehabilitation measures, in \nline with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national laws and regulations. \n40 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n41 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n42 Sections VII (safeguards) and VIII (gender and social) of the PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \n43 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n44 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10     \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak regulatory framework  Continued policy dialogue with government to enact Electricity Regulatory \nCommission legislation  \nFinancial sustainability of NEA  ADB is supporting the implementation of NEA financial restructuring plan and \nmanagement reforms, and strengthening ETFC\u2019s capacity to review retail \ntariff adjustment petitions.
