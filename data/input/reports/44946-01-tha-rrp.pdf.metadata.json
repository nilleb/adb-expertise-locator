If  approved,  the  project  will  constitute  ADB\u2019s  fifth \nprivate sector investment in Thailand. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n2. \nThe Thai power sector is structured under a single-buyer model whereby the Electricity \nGenerating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the state utility, enables private sector participation in \nthe  power  generation  sector  while  maintaining  control  over  system  planning,  operation,  and \npricing. EGAT owns and operates the largest share of Thailand\u2019s installed generation capacity \nand  is  the  country\u2019s  single  wholesale  purchaser  of  electricity  and  supplier  (as  transmission \nowner  and  operator)  to  the  country\u2019s  two  state-owned  electricity  distribution  authorities:  the \nMetropolitan Electricity Authority and the Provincial Electricity Authority. \n \n3. \nThe  government  has  opened  access  to  private  sector  participation  in  the  generation \nbusiness  through  three  public  \u2013  private  partnership  (PPP)  programs:  independent  power \nproducers (IPPs), small power producers, and very small power producers. The IPP and small \npower  producer  programs  allow  private  developers  to  construct,  own,  and  operate  power \nprojects and enter into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with EGAT with terms of up to 25 \nyears.  The  very  small  power  producer  program  allows  power  producers  with  projects  of  10 \nmegawatts (MW) or less to sell power to the Metropolitan Electricity Authority and the Provincial \nElectricity  Authority.  IPPs  are  large  private  power  producers  with  generating  capacity  greater \nthan  90  MW  that  use  commercial  coal,  natural  gas,  and  heavy  oil  and  sell  their  electricity  to \nEGAT  through  PPAs.  Thailand\u2019s  IPP  program  was  introduced  in  the  early  1990s  to  promote \ncompetition,  enhance  generating  efficiency,  lower  electricity  prices,  and  reduce  the  financial \nburden on the Government of Thailand of expanding generation to meet rising demand. Since \nthe  inception  of  the  IPP  program,  its  share  of  electricity  generation  supplying  Thailand  has \nsteadily increased \n \nIn accordance with the government\u2019s policy to promote private sector participation in the \n4. \npower sector, EGAT invited qualified generators in 2007 to participate in IPP bidding. This was \nthe  second  IPP  bidding  round  since the  program  was  initiated and  the first  IPP  bidding  round \nsince  the  Asian  financial  crisis. 1  At  the  time,  ADB  was  asked  for  financial  assistance  and \nexpressed to potential bidders interest in providing a guarantee that would help extend the tenor \nof IPP financial assistance.  \n \n5. \nIn 2008, the financial crisis triggered by subprime mortgage lending in the United States \nspiraled into a global economic crisis. Thailand reduced its economic growth forecasts as power \ndemand declined significantly. Accordingly, the recently awarded IPP projects were postponed, \n                                                \n1  In  the  first  IPP  bidding  round,  ADB  provided  assistance  to  BLCP  Power  Limited  (ADB.  2003.  Report  and \nRecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans  and  a  Proposed  Political  Risk \nGuarantee  to  BLCP  Power  Limited.  Manila).  The  project  was  a  1,434  MW  coal-fired  power  plant  in  Rayong \nProvince, 200 kilometers southeast of Bangkok. The plant was completed ahead of schedule on 1 February 2007 \nand generates electricity at one of the lowest costs in Thailand.   \n\n \n\n\f \n2 \n\n \n\nas the capacity and willingness of banks around the world to supply credit tightened. Thailand \nsimultaneously  experienced  political  demonstrations  that  added  to  economic  uncertainty. \nDespite  these factors,  the  Thai  economy demonstrated  remarkable  signs  of  recovery  in  2010, \nwith power demand in the first 7 months of 2010 more than 10% higher than in the same period \nof 2009. The latest demand forecast indicates that Thailand must promptly bring new capacity \nonline to avoid an impending supply as the reserve margin is expected to reach a critical level \nby 2019.2   \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsor \n\nThe  project  will  be  developed  and  operated  by  JPNS,  a  special-purpose  vehicle \n6. \nincorporated in Thailand. JPNS is a subsidiary of Gulf JP, which is 90% owned by JP Holdings \nThailand,  the  Thai  subsidiary  of  J-Power.  The  remaining  shares  are  held  by  Gulf  JP \nmanagement.3 \n \n7. \nJ-Power  supplies  electricity  to  10  major  electric  power  companies  in  Japan.  It  was \nestablished in 1952 as a special public corporation, was fully privatized in 2004, and is currently \nlisted on  the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange.  Table  1  summarizes  J-Power\u2019s financial and  operational \nperformance  in  recent  years.  Reflecting  the  steady  nature  of  its  business,  both  revenues  and \nincome remained relatively stable despite the financial crisis.

A  major  challenge  for  ADB \ndeveloping  member  countries  such  as  Thailand  is  bringing  significant  new  power  generation \nonline to maintain economic growth. Underinvestment in the power sector reduces the integrity \nof  the  system,  making  it  more  prone  to  outages.  Supply  disruptions  are  costly  for  local \nbusinesses and discourage foreign direct investment. The project\u2019s timely addition of 1,600 MW \nof capacity will help Thailand maintain a reserve margin above the Ministry of Energy\u2019s critical \nthreshold  of  15%.  Low  cost  is  important  for  making  electricity  accessible  and  affordable  to \nreduce  poverty.  Low-cost  electricity  enhances  Thailand\u2019s  labor  productivity  and  global \ncompetiveness  and  expands  livelihood  opportunities.  Further,  energy projects  that  use natural \ngas  and  efficient  combined-cycle  technology  are  more  sustainable  than  coal-fired  projects, \nwhich is the only other IPP alternative for adding new domestic base-load capacity in Thailand. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n10. \nThe outcome of the project is the provision of competitively-priced power generated from \ntechnically  and  financially  stable  gas-fired  technology,  which  emits  substantially  less  carbon \ndioxide than a coal-fired generation. Using natural gas with efficient combined-cycle technology6 \ncontributes  to  long-term  sustainable  growth.  In addition, the  project  will  provide environmental \nand social benefits. Compared with coal-fired generation, the only IPP alternative for domestic \nbase-load  generation,  the  project  will  avoid  5.7  million  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  per \nannum,  as  well  as  dust  and  ash  waste.  Cleaner  air  and  a  lower  carbon  footprint  provide \nhealthier  and  more  sustainable  living  conditions  for  the  poor.  Other  socioeconomic  benefits \ninclude employment creation and tax contributions. \n \n\n                                                \n5  Ownership share 1,023 MW. \n6  The project\u2019s net efficiency is 57.7%, using one of the industry\u2019s most efficient, commercially proven technologies.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f \n4 \n\n \n\nThe project reduces poverty by providing a significant amount of electricity at a low cost, \n11. \nwhich is essential for economic growth and human development.7 On average, the project will \ncontribute  11,845  gigawatt-hours  of  cleaner  energy  to  the  grid  per  annum  by  2015.  Modern \nforms of energy must be available, accessible, and affordable to communities, businesses, and \nhouseholds  to  reduce  poverty  and  set  development  on  an  inclusive  path.  Energy  can  be \nconsidered the  missing  Millennium  Development Goal  because  it  is  a  significant  driver  toward \nachieving the others.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  project  outputs  include  the  first  PPP  worth  over  $1  billion  to  reach  financial  close \nand  the first  IPP  of over 1,000  MW  to be  brought  online  in  Thailand  since  the global financial \ncrisis.  Both  are  important  signals  to  the  market  and  power  sector  that  will  demonstrate \nconfidence  in  the  country  as  it  recovers  from  the  economic  downturn  and  recent  political \ndisruptions.  The  financial  close  will  be  made  possible  through  ADB  and  a  bilateral  co-lender, \nwhich will catalyze the long-term financing required for infrastructure development. The design \nand  monitoring  framework  in  Appendix  1  outlines  the  project\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  and  output \nindicators. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\n13. \nCapitalizing  on  ADB\u2019s  core  strength  of  financing  infrastructure  development,  Strategy \n20208 sets  forth  that  ADB  will  help  expand  the  supply  of  energy;  promote  energy  efficiency; \nsupport clean energy; and facilitate the removal of policy, institutional, regulatory, technological, \nand legal constraints on efficient energy use. Strategy 2020 aims to promote a larger role for the \nprivate sector in financing infrastructure development by supporting PPP. \n \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\n2. \nThe central thrust of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Thailand, 2007\u201320119 is to \n14. \naddress  the  main  constraints  on  its  achieving  sustainable  economic  growth.  Ensuring  the \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure,  which  is  one  of  three  core  strategic  areas  of  the  country \npartnership  strategy,  will  ultimately  shape  the  magnitude,  direction,  and  sustainability  of \nThailand\u2019s future economic growth and development.  \n \n\n3. \nConsistency with the Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations   \nADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy10 emphasizes  investments  in  energy  efficiency,  least-cost  supply, \n15. \nprivate  sector  participation,  and  wider  access  for  the  poor.  ADB  supports  projects  that  use \nefficient technologies such as combined cycle, as well as projects that incorporate state-of-the-\nart  emission-control  equipment.  Natural  gas  is  preferred  over  coal  for  providing  base-load \nelectricity.  \n \n\n                                                \n7  Nong  Saeng submitted  a very  competitive international  bid to  secure  a  PPA  with  a capacity  charge  of  $1.18  per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) which covers the plant\u2019s fixed operation, maintenance, and capital costs, including debt service \nand equity return. \n\n8  ADB.  2008.
