THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Mumbai Metro Rail Systems Project.  \n \n2.  The project will support the implementation of the Mumbai Metro Rail System through  \nthe  (i)  design,  manufacture,  testing,  and  maintenance  of  378  energy-efficient  rolling  stock \ncarriages; (ii) procurement, installation, and testing of an advanced signaling, train control, and \nplatform access system for 58 kilometers (km) of metro lines; and (iii) establishment of a Mumbai \nmetro operations organization. The project will contribute to the development of a modern and \nsafe rail-based urban transit system in Mumbai city, which will reduce pollution and traffic \ncongestion, increase public transport ridership, and improve the overall quality of the city\u2019s \ntransport system.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Mumbai, the capital of the state of Maharashtra, is one of \nIndia\u2019s largest metropolitan areas, and is also known as the financial capital of India. The Mumbai \nMetropolitan Region (MMR) covers an area of about 4,355 square km with a population of more \nthan 18 million.1 The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai is the largest constituent of the \nMMR, with a population of about 12 million and an area of about 440 square km.2 The MMR \nmakes a very substantial contribution to India\u2019s economy\u2014the state of Maharashtra produced \nabout 15% of India\u2019s gross domestic product, about 40% of which is estimated to be from the \nMMR.3 The two ports in the MMR, Mumbai Port Trust and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, handle \nmore than 30% of India\u2019s sea trade.  \n \n4.  Transport problems. The Mumbai metropolitan area lies along a north\u2212south peninsula. \nThe resulting geographic constraints result in Mumbai city having the second-highest population \ndensity in the world.4 Mumbai\u2019s density and geography present enormous challenges to the \ntransport system. Rail is the primary transport mode in the MMR, and the Western Railway and \nCentral Railway form the peninsula\u2019s main north\u2212south transport lines. The MMR\u2019s suburban rail \nroute  network  totals  nearly  400  km.  The  bus  system  is  operated  by  the  state-owned \nBrihanmumbai  Electric  Supply  and  Transport  Undertaking  and  carries  more  than  5  million \npassengers per day in highly congested conditions.   \n \n5.  Existing public transport systems in Mumbai are extremely crowded, unsafe, and slow, \naffecting primarily the poor, women, and children. The public transport share of trips has declined \nsteadily\u2014from 88% in 1994 to 78% in 2005, and 70% in 2015\u2014but Mumbai\u2019s public transport \nmode share nevertheless remains one of the highest of any city in the world. Primary reasons for \nthe decline are the expansion of the urban area and cross-axis (east\u2013west) travel demand, both \nof which are not well-served by the existing public transport system. The suburban railway lines \ncarry more than 7.5 million passengers per day often under \u201csuper dense crush load\u201d conditions \n                                                \n1 Government of India, Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner. 2011.

These are the world\u2019s most crowded cities. Data are derived from the United Nations \nHabitat, 2013. ", "2 \nexceeding 14 passengers per square meter, making the Mumbai rail system the most crowded \npublic transport system in the world. Each train carries about 5,000 passengers, compared to a \ndesign capacity of 1,750. Suburban trains have severe safety problems, with more than 3,000 \nfatalities  per  year,  caused  mainly  by  overcrowding  and  right-of-way  encroachment.  Those \nconstraints and the overwhelming level of demand limit the speed of the rail service and its ability \nto accommodate more passengers. The inability of the current public transport system to meet \nthe demand for travel has resulted in a 400% increase in private vehicles from 2008 to 2015.  \n \n6.  Increased public transport capacity is crucial to address these severe transport problems; \nimprove livability; provide safe and convenient mobility for the poor, women, and children; arrest \nthe decline in public transport mode share; and enable the city to develop to its potential. Given \nthe geographic and existing infrastructure constraints and extremely high population density, a \nmetro rail system is the only reasonable alternative. As such, the government has developed a \nplan for 12 metro lines with a length of 276 km. Line 1 is operating, and the Metropolitan Mumbai \nRegional Development Authority (MMRDA) is implementing other lines. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) will assist the MMRDA in financing the procurement of rolling stock, signaling and \ntrain control systems, station access and platform systems; and support multimodal integration \nand access for Lines 2 and 7.  \n \n7.  Public transport development strategy. The Government of Maharashtra realizes that \nthe sustainable solution to address transport problems in Mumbai is to develop and expand rail-\nbased public transport. In 2003, MMRDA commissioned the preparation of a masterplan for the \nMumbai metro rail system. As part of the World Bank-assisted Mumbai Urban Transport Project, \nthe MMRDA also prepared a comprehensive transport study (CTS) for MMR in 2005\u20132008, for \nthe period up to 2031. The CTS sets out timeline goals for transportation and serves as a sector \nroad map that focuses on increasing the metro and suburban rail networks and services. It will \nreduce road vehicles, lower emissions, and improve the urban environment and quality of urban \nlife. Extending the metro rail system to supplement the existing suburban rail in Mumbai will help \nachieve the objectives of the CTS and the National Urban Transport Policy.5 To ensure the \nefficiency and sustainability of the metro rail system, a viable operations organization with \ncapacity to manage the metro system must be established. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor India, 2018\u20132022 recognizes the need to strengthen urban mass transit systems and to \nincrease the environmental sustainability of cities through the development of metro rail systems.6 \nThis project is also included in the country operations business plan for India, 2019\u20132021.7 \n \n8.  Metro lines under operation and development. Of the planned metro rail developments \nin the CTS, the contract for Line 1 between Andheri and Ghatkopar (11 km) was awarded to the \nMumbai  Metro  One  Private  Ltd.  in  March  2007.8 The  line  was  completed  in  2014  on  a \npublic\u2212private partnership model. This single metro rail line carries about 400,000 passengers \nper day and reduced the travel time along the corridor from 71 minutes to 21 minutes, and also \nreduced traffic congestion by shifting travel demand from private vehicles and informal public \ntransport modes to the metro. To expedite the implementation of the network, the Government of \nMaharashtra has decided to entrust the construction of new lines to the MMRDA. The scale of \ninvestment for the multiple lines is very large, and it is difficult for metro rail systems to meet equity \nreturn expectations. Hence, it is proposed to follow a model whereby the government finances \nthe assets using its own funds and development assistance,  and then outsources service \n                                                \n5  Government of India, Ministry of Urban Development. 2006.

This is the practice in most metros worldwide. The MMRDA will create a new metro rail \norganization and carry out selective aspects of operation and maintenance (O&M) with private \nsector participation.  \n \n9.  Line  3  (Colaba\u2013Bandra\u2013Santacruz  Electronic Export  Processing  Zone),  which  is  an \nunderground line of about 34 km is also being developed accordingly, with assistance from the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).9 For other lines, the MMRDA is seeking financing \nfrom  development  agencies,  including  ADB,  JICA,  and  the  New  Development  Bank.  ADB \nproposed to provide financial assistance to the following lines: (i) Line 2A from Dahisar (Charkhop) \nto D. N. Nagar, (ii) Line 2B for D. N. Nagar\u2013Bandra\u2013Mandale, and (iii) Line 7 from Dahisar (East) \nto Andheri (East). The aggregate length of these lines is about 58 km. The MMRDA has already \ncommenced the civil works of these lines using state funds.10 ADB funding will be used to finance \nthe rolling stock, signaling, platform access and safety systems, and multimodal integration, which \nwill be mainly through systems supply and installation contracts.11 \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. Mumbai has a large suburban rail system, but safety \nremains a huge challenge, with over 3,000 deaths per year since 2006 as a result of overcrowding, \npeople falling from the trains, and people crossing tracks. ADB assistance to the project will add \nvalue in the following ways:  \n(i)  Improve  transport  safety  through  high-level  technology.  The  project  will \nreduce congestion on the existing suburban rail system and significantly improve \ntransport safety by moving passengers to a modern, energy-efficient, comfortable, \nand safe transit system, with best-practice safety equipment such as platform \ndoors and a fully grade-separated right-of-way.12 ADB financing will help procure \nstate-of-the-art carriages, equipped with surveillance systems and real-time track \nmonitoring to ensure safety. ADB will also help implement the latest signaling \ntechnology and a communications-based train control system. \n(ii)  Establish an efficient and sustainable metro rail organization. The Mumbai \nmetro operations organization will be responsible for the O&M of all metro lines in \nMumbai. ADB support will help train staff; recruit qualified personnel; and develop \nstandard operating procedures, training manuals, and aids, including procurement \nof training equipment such as simulators. \n(iii)  Establish last-mile connectivity solutions. Public transport systems often have \npoor last-mile connectivity that makes reaching the final destination a challenge \nfor passengers. To overcome this limitation, ADB is helping the MMRDA to ensure \nlast-mile connectivity through nonmotorized transport and electric vehicles.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: urban mobility in the MMR improved \n(footnote 5). The project will have the following outcome: efficiency, safety, and gender- and \nsocial-inclusiveness of rail-based urban transit system in Mumbai city increased.13 \n \n                                                \n9  The metro rail line numbers are a legacy of previous studies and do not reflect priority of importance or sequencing. \n10 The civil works progress is about 40% on Lines 2A and 7, and about 15% on Line 2B. These civil works are being \nentirely funded by the government and do not involve ADB financing. \n11 New Development Bank is financing in parallel certain specific traction and power equipment to the extent of \napproximately $260 million. This will be under a separate contract and not administered by ADB. \n12 The Mumbai Metro rail will use grade of automation 4, the highest grade of automation that involves automatic train \nprotection, operation, and control. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output 1: Rolling stock operational. This will include the design, procurement, testing, \nand commissioning for operation of 378 standard-gauge rolling stock carriages, comprising 63 \ntrain sets in a configuration of 6 cars each. The rolling stock will have built-in safety features; \ndesign features for the elderly, children, women, and differently abled; and will be energy-efficient. \nThe rolling stock supplier will have an obligation under the contracts to remedy defects, to supply \nspare parts, and to provide training to the maintenance staff of the Mumbai metro operations \norganization for 2 years after the date of supply.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Signaling, train control, and telecommunications systems operational. \nThis includes the design, supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of a modern signaling \nand train control system using radio communications-based train control technology, including \ncomputerized interlocking and automatic train protection.

Output 3: Institutional support for Mumbai metro operations organization and last-\nmile connectivity provided. Consulting support will be provided for the establishment of the \nMumbai metro operations organization, which will be responsible for operating and maintaining \nall rail-based urban transit lines within the MMRDA territory. This will serve as a template for \nintegrated operations for future lines. The MMRDA will develop gender equality and social \ninclusion actions for the Mumbai metro operations organization, and provide support for a metro \noperations  and  training  center  and  procure  special  software,  computer-based  tutorials, \nsimulators, other training aids and equipment to ensure readiness for O&M. Nonmotorized and \nelectric vehicles will be piloted at select stations to enhance last-mile connectivity. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n15.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The technical viability is sound, with the use of proven technology. The technical designs \nand specifications are in accordance with applicable international standards. The executing \nagency prepared  project reports, detailed designs, and specifications. As per the specifications, \nrolling stock will be of modern design, lightweight, made of stainless steel or aluminum, and with \nregenerative braking. Modern signaling systems will be used that employ communications-based \ntrain control technology to enhance safety and efficiency. Platform screen doors will be installed \nto separate the station platform from the train and to prevent accidents. \n \n21.  The climate risk screening indicated a low risk to the project. Mumbai is prone to flooding, \nand an increase in both extreme rainfall events and the number of wet days is predicted. Flooding \nis therefore the key climate risk. Climate models did not forecast temperature increase to be \nsevere, with an average of 1.1\u00b0C\u20131.8\u00b0C during 2030\u20132050.17 The entire metro rail line is elevated \nand will have a vertical minimum clearance of 5.5 meters, while the rail level will be about 9.5 \nmeters above the road level. The risk of flooding of the metro rail lines is therefore very low. \n  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic  analysis.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines, and compared the project costs and benefits in with- and \nwithout- project cases, using a 9% discount rate, economic internal rate of return (EIRR), and net \npresent value as decision criteria.18 The project is expected to deliver significant benefits to \nsociety through savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time for both public transport and \n                                                \n17 The Energy and Resources Institute. 2014. Assessing Climate Change Vulnerability and Adaptation Strategies for \nMaharashtra: Maharashtra State Adaptation Action Plan on Climate Change. New Delhi. \n18 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \nroad  users.  The  project  will  also  deliver  social  and  economic  benefits  from  reduced  road \naccidents, improved railway passenger safety, and reduced carbon dioxide emissions and air \npollution, which have been quantified in the analysis. The EIRR for Lines 2A and 2B is estimated \nto be 16.5%, and for Line 7, 14.8%. The overall EIRR for the project is 16.1%, with a net present \nvalue of over \u20b9197 billion. The evaluation included a sensitivity analysis to investigate the \neconomic viability of the project given adverse changes in costs and benefits. The EIRR remained \nabove 9% under all scenarios, demonstrating that the project would remain economically viable \ngiven adverse changes in costs and benefits. The metro lines will also contribute significantly to \nMumbai\u2019s economic growth by structuring land use and transport patterns. \n \n23.  Financial  sustainability.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines.19 It assessed the incremental costs and earnings that would \naccrue to the MMRDA as a result of the project, and calculated the financial internal rate of return. \nThe project\u2019s weighted average cost of capital was estimated to be 2.83%. For the purposes of \nfinancial sustainability, capital costs include the costs of construction of the metro line and its \nassociated facilities, including stations, a maintenance depot, and assets to be financed by ADB \n(rolling stock and signaling). O&M costs include all staff costs, unit maintenance costs, and energy \ncosts. The evaluation assumes traffic at commencement of operations will be 25% of forecast, \nwhich is increased to forecast estimates in the fourth year after commencement. The project \nrevenues  include  ticket  sales,  advertisements,  and  rentals  at  metro  stations.  All  financial \nprojections are made in 2017 rupees, in real terms. The estimated financial internal rate of return \nof the net cash flows for Lines 2A and 2B taken together is 5.02%, in real terms, which is above \nthe weighted average cost of capital. Details are in the financial analysis.20 \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  Institutional  capacity.  The  MMRDA  was  established  through  legislation  under  the \nMumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority Act, 1974, and has been functioning for over \n40 years. Its objective was to increase economic activity in the MMR by promoting infrastructure \ndevelopment and improving the quality of life. The broad responsibilities of the MMRDA include  \n(i) preparing regional development plans, (ii) providing financial assistance for significant regional \nprojects,  (iii)  providing  help  to  local  authorities  and  their  infrastructure  projects,  and  \n(iv) coordinating execution of project schemes in the MMR. The MMRDA conceives, promotes, \nand monitors key projects to develop new MMR growth centers, and makes improvements in \nsectors  such  as  transport,  housing,  water  supply,  and  environment.  The  metropolitan \ncommissioner is a senior officer of the Government of Maharashtra and the functional head of the \nMMRDA. The MMRDA is one of the most empowered agencies in the state to raise capital and \nimplement infrastructure projects. It has adequate capacity to implement this project. \n \n25.  Financial management. This is ADB\u2019s first project with the MMRDA, but the agency is \nquite familiar with the World Bank requirements, having implemented previous projects, and is \nworking on large projects assisted by JICA. Fund flows are entirely through the budgetary process \nand revenue accruals from land development. All transactions are recorded through double-entry, \naccrual-based systems and are subject to statutory audit by the comptroller and auditor general \n(CAG) of India in line with India\u2019s constitutional provisions. Audited accounts are submitted to the \nstate legislature. In addition, transaction audits are also carried out periodically during the year by \nthe state accountant general to ensure conformity with relevant codes and standards. A financial \nmanagement system based on off-the-shelf accounting software is used. Annual statements of \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2005. Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n20 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "8 \nproject accounts are subject to audit by the accountant general, an arm of the CAG at the state \nlevel, in accordance with auditing standards promulgated by the CAG. A review of the audits from \nFY2015 to FY2017 indicates no major adverse audit comments. The MMRDA is a very large \norganization with multiple projects, and its responsiveness to ADB reporting requirements for a \nsingle project has yet to be tested; the financial management risk is therefore rated moderate. \n \n26.  Procurement. The project procurement risk is rated low. The MMRDA is experienced with \nprocurement  and  consultant  recruitment  for  the  World  Bank  and  JICA  projects,  regular \nprocurement for its own projects, as well as in the use of public\u2212private partnerships for some \nprojects. The MMRDA has entrusted the DMRC with the complete work for Line 2A, as well as \nthe procurement and commissioning of rolling stock, signaling, and platform access systems for \nthe three lines.21 The DMRC successfully developed and operates the Delhi metro rail network, \nwhich is the largest system in India. The DMRC has also prepared the detailed designs for most \nmetro rail projects in India, and acts as an implementing agency or advisor in many metros and \nprojects, including the ADB-financed Jaipur Metro project, and some outside the country.22  ADB \nfinancing for this project will be primarily for three large goods supply contracts (rolling stock, \nsignaling,  and  platform  access  systems);  procurement  commenced  in  May  2018.  Project \nreadiness is high. The procurement plan is in the PAM. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MMRDA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  Poverty. This is an urban transport project in the MMR, and the project\u2019s zone of influence \nincludes a population of about 12 million urban residents. In 2011, about 20% of the population in \nthese districts lived in poverty. Business, urban services, and wage labor are the main sources of \nlivelihood in the project area. An efficient metro rail system providing urban mass transit is an \nessential requirement for the MMR. This project will cater to about 2,000,000 passengers per day \nafter operations stabilize; improve urban transport safety and comfort; and provide residents, \nespecially the poor and vulnerable, with improved access to economic opportunities and social \nservice facilities.  \n \n29.  Gender  equality  and  social  inclusion.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. The MMRDA and ADB conducted extensive consultations with stakeholders in \npreparing a gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan with well-defined activities, \nindicators, targets, and timeframes.23 The GESI action plan provides activities integrated within \nthe project design, including (i) gender-responsive and socially inclusive design features across \nall infrastructure; (ii) affirmative measures to enhance women\u2019s safe mobility such as \u201cwomen-\nonly coaches,\u201d mobile applications for women\u2019s security, and instruction boards with helpline \nnumbers and color-coded directional signs; (iii) special initiatives such as priority e-ticket counters \nfor the elderly and differently abled, separate ticketing counters and vending machines for women, \nreporting desks to address incidents of harassment, quotas to ensure a portion of commercial \nspaces in metro stations are assigned to enterprises owned by or operated by women, and \n                                                \n21  The procurement and implementation of the civil works for Lines 2B and 7 is being done by MMRDA. \n22 ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to India for the \nJaipur Metro Rail Line 1-Phase B Project. Manila. The Project involves construction of underground rail infrastructure \nof 2.3 kilometers and two stations. Commercial operations for the project is targeted in Q3 2019. \n23 Stakeholders included state government entities in municipalities working in gender, academia, and civil society \norganizations; MMRDA women staff; staff at metro stations on Line 1; and women commuters. \n ", "9 \nestablishment of a station staffed only by women. The project will help establish a gender-\ninclusive agency, the Mumbai metro operations organization, with attention to women\u2019s equitable \nemployment,  GESI  aspects,  and  the  transformative  impacts  of  its  operations.  The \nmultistakeholder GESI advisory committee will guide the project and will support the development \nof a GESI policy for the Mumbai metro operations organization. Toward project completion, the \nMMRDA will conduct an impact study to evaluate the project\u2019s socioeconomic impact on the lives \nof at least 2,000 Mumbai residents (40% women). \n \n30.  Health. The project will provide an additional safe transport system in an existing urban \narea and is not expected to significantly increase the incidence of sexually transmitted infections \nincluding HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.24  \n  \n32.  Environment (category B). The project scope for ADB\u2019s financing involves specific items \nof goods supply for Lines 2A, 2B, and 7 of the Mumbai Metro Rail network. No civil works are \nfinanced by ADB. The key long-term environmental impact anticipated is noise and vibration from \nthe operation of the rolling stock. However, given the existing noisy conditions in the project area \ndue to heavy road traffic, the incremental impacts are expected to be minimal. Some occupational \nhealth and safety impacts may also be experienced during the installation and operation of the \nrolling stock and signaling and telecommunication systems. However, these are expected to be \nminor and easily mitigated. The MMRDA prepared an initial environmental examination report, \nincluding an environmental management plan and environmental monitoring plan, for all three \nlines. The MMRDA and ADB agreed to closely monitor environmental impacts during project \nimplementation. \n \n33.  The civil works for the three elevated lines are considered an \u201cassociated facility\u201d in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement because they are not funded under the \nproject,  but  the  viability  and  operation  of  the  lines  and  the  ADB-funded  components  are \nexclusively interdependent. An environmental due diligence review  was carried out for the \nongoing civil works to assess compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The review \nidentified a few areas for improvement for which corrective measures have been prepared.  \n   \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project scope for ADB\u2019s financing does not \ninclude civil works. The MMRDA has acquired private land and assets based on the provisions of \nnational law, state law, and sector policy.25 Due diligence with regard to involuntary resettlement \nsafeguards  implementation  was  conducted  for  the  three  lines  to  assess  if  safeguards  are \nconsistent with applicable ADB requirements. Due diligence reports indicate that MMRDA land \nacquisition and resettlement plans are prepared and implemented to ensure that (i) affected \npersons, including informal settlers, are compensated for lost assets prior to displacement and at \nreplacement cost; (ii) income restoration programs are in place for those whose livelihood will be \naffected; (iii) there is meaningful consultation and information disclosure; (iv) the standard of living \nof displaced poor and other vulnerable groups is improved; and (v) there are mechanisms for \n                                                \n24  ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n25 Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement Act, 2013; \nMaharashtra  Notification  on  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation,  2014;  and  Mumbai  Urban  Transport  Project \nResettlement and Rehabilitation Policy, 2000, developed to comply with World Bank safeguards. \n ", "10 \ngrievance  redress  and  monitoring.  The  MMRDA  and  ADB  agreed  to  closely  monitor  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  during  implementation,  and  carry  out  corrective  measures  if \nnecessary. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to affect indigenous \npeoples\u2019 communities within the meaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.
