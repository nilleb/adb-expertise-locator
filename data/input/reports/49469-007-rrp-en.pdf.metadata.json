The project will contribute to the development of a modern and \nsafe  rail-based  urban  transit  system  in  Mumbai  city,  which  will  reduce  pollution  and  traffic \ncongestion,  increase  public  transport  ridership,  and  improve  the  overall  quality  of  the  city\u2019s \ntransport system.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMumbai Metropolitan Region. Mumbai, the capital of the state of Maharashtra, is one of \nIndia\u2019s largest metropolitan areas, and is also known as the financial capital of India. The Mumbai \nMetropolitan Region (MMR) covers an area of about 4,355 square km with a population of more \nthan 18 million.1 The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai is the largest constituent of the \nMMR,  with  a  population  of  about  12  million  and  an  area  of  about  440  square  km.2 The  MMR \nmakes  a  very  substantial  contribution  to  India\u2019s  economy\u2014the  state  of Maharashtra  produced \nabout  15%  of India\u2019s gross domestic  product,  about  40%  of  which is  estimated to  be from  the \nMMR.3 The two ports in the MMR, Mumbai Port Trust and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, handle \nmore than 30% of India\u2019s sea trade.  \n \nTransport problems. The Mumbai metropolitan area lies along a north\u2212south peninsula. \n4. \nThe resulting geographic constraints result in Mumbai city having the second-highest population \ndensity  in  the  world. 4 Mumbai\u2019s  density  and  geography  present  enormous  challenges  to  the \ntransport system. Rail is the primary transport mode in the MMR, and the Western Railway and \nCentral Railway form the peninsula\u2019s main north\u2212south transport lines. The MMR\u2019s suburban rail \nroute  network  totals  nearly  400  km.  The  bus  system  is  operated  by  the  state-owned \nBrihanmumbai  Electric  Supply  and  Transport  Undertaking  and  carries  more  than  5  million \npassengers per day in highly congested conditions.   \n \n5. \nExisting  public  transport  systems  in Mumbai  are  extremely  crowded,  unsafe,  and slow, \naffecting primarily the poor, women, and children. The public transport share of trips has declined \nsteadily\u2014from 88% in 1994 to 78% in 2005, and 70% in 2015\u2014but Mumbai\u2019s public transport \nmode share nevertheless remains one of the highest of any city in the world. Primary reasons for \nthe decline are the expansion of the urban area and cross-axis (east\u2013west) travel demand, both \nof which are not well-served by the existing public transport system. The suburban railway lines \ncarry more than 7.5 million passengers per day often under \u201csuper dense crush load\u201d conditions \n                                                \n1  Government  of  India,  Office  of  the  Registrar  General  and  Census  Commissioner.  2011.

These are the world\u2019s most crowded cities. Data are derived from the United Nations \n\nHabitat, 2013. \n\n\fexceeding 14 passengers per square meter, making the Mumbai rail system the most crowded \npublic transport system in the world. Each train carries about 5,000 passengers, compared to a \ndesign capacity of 1,750. Suburban trains have severe safety problems, with more than 3,000 \nfatalities  per  year,  caused  mainly  by  overcrowding  and  right-of-way  encroachment.  Those \nconstraints and the overwhelming level of demand limit the speed of the rail service and its ability \nto accommodate more passengers. The inability of the current public transport system to meet \nthe demand for travel has resulted in a 400% increase in private vehicles from 2008 to 2015.  \n \nIncreased public transport capacity is crucial to address these severe transport problems; \n6. \nimprove livability; provide safe and convenient mobility for the poor, women, and children; arrest \nthe decline in public transport mode share; and enable the city to develop to its potential. Given \nthe geographic and existing infrastructure constraints and extremely high population density, a \nmetro rail system is the only reasonable alternative. As such, the government has developed a \nplan for 12 metro lines with a length of 276 km. Line 1 is operating, and the Metropolitan Mumbai \nRegional Development Authority (MMRDA) is implementing other lines. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) will assist the MMRDA in financing the procurement of rolling stock, signaling and \ntrain control systems, station access and platform systems; and support multimodal integration \nand access for Lines 2 and 7.  \n \n7. \nPublic transport development strategy. The Government of Maharashtra realizes that \nthe sustainable solution to address transport problems in Mumbai is to develop and expand rail-\nbased public transport. In 2003, MMRDA commissioned the preparation of a masterplan for the \nMumbai metro rail system. As part of the World Bank-assisted Mumbai Urban Transport Project, \nthe MMRDA also prepared a comprehensive transport study (CTS) for MMR in 2005\u20132008, for \nthe period up to 2031. The CTS sets out timeline goals for transportation and serves as a sector \nroad map that focuses on increasing the metro and suburban rail networks and services. It will \nreduce road vehicles, lower emissions, and improve the urban environment and quality of urban \nlife. Extending the metro rail system to supplement the existing suburban rail in Mumbai will help \nachieve  the  objectives  of  the  CTS  and  the  National  Urban  Transport  Policy.5 To  ensure  the \nefficiency  and  sustainability  of  the  metro  rail  system,  a  viable  operations  organization  with \ncapacity to manage the metro system must be established. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor  India,  2018\u20132022  recognizes  the  need  to  strengthen  urban  mass  transit  systems  and  to \nincrease the environmental sustainability of cities through the development of metro rail systems.6 \nThis project is also included in the country operations business plan for India, 2019\u20132021.7 \n \n8. \nMetro lines under operation and development. Of the planned metro rail developments \nin the CTS, the contract for Line 1 between Andheri and Ghatkopar (11 km) was awarded to the \nMumbai  Metro  One  Private  Ltd.  in  March  2007. 8  The  line  was  completed  in  2014  on  a \npublic\u2212private  partnership  model. This  single metro rail  line  carries about  400,000  passengers \nper day and reduced the travel time along the corridor from 71 minutes to 21 minutes, and also \nreduced  traffic  congestion  by  shifting  travel  demand  from  private  vehicles  and  informal  public \ntransport modes to the metro. To expedite the implementation of the network, the Government of \nMaharashtra has decided to entrust the construction of new lines to the MMRDA. The scale of \ninvestment for the multiple lines is very large, and it is difficult for metro rail systems to meet equity \nreturn expectations. Hence, it is proposed to follow a model whereby the government finances \nthe  assets  using  its  own  funds  and  development  assistance,  and  then  outsources  service \n                                                \n5  Government of India, Ministry of Urban Development. 2006.

Manila. \n8  Mumbai  Metro  One  Private  Ltd.  is  a  joint  venture  company  owned  by Reliance  Infrastructure (69%), Veolia \n\nTransport (5%), and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (26%). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fcontracts. This is the practice in most metros worldwide. The MMRDA will create a new metro rail \norganization and carry out  selective aspects of operation and maintenance (O&M) with private \nsector participation.  \n \nLine  3  (Colaba\u2013Bandra\u2013Santacruz  Electronic  Export  Processing  Zone),  which  is  an \n9. \nunderground line of about 34 km is also being developed accordingly, with assistance from the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).9 For other lines, the MMRDA is seeking financing \nfrom  development  agencies,  including  ADB,  JICA,  and  the  New  Development  Bank.  ADB \nproposed to provide financial assistance to the following lines: (i) Line 2A from Dahisar (Charkhop) \nto D. N. Nagar, (ii) Line 2B for D. N. Nagar\u2013Bandra\u2013Mandale, and (iii) Line 7 from Dahisar (East) \nto Andheri (East). The aggregate length of these lines is about 58 km. The MMRDA has already \ncommenced the civil works of these lines using state funds.10 ADB funding will be used to finance \nthe rolling stock, signaling, platform access and safety systems, and multimodal integration, which \nwill be mainly through systems supply and installation contracts.11 \n \n10. \nValue added by ADB assistance. Mumbai has a large suburban rail system, but safety \nremains a huge challenge, with over 3,000 deaths per year since 2006 as a result of overcrowding, \npeople falling from the trains, and people crossing tracks. ADB assistance to the project will add \nvalue in the following ways:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nImprove  transport  safety  through  high-level  technology.  The  project  will \nreduce congestion on the existing suburban rail system and significantly improve \ntransport safety by moving passengers to a modern, energy-efficient, comfortable, \nand  safe  transit  system,  with  best-practice  safety  equipment  such  as  platform \ndoors and a fully grade-separated right-of-way.12 ADB financing will help procure \nstate-of-the-art carriages, equipped with surveillance systems and real-time track \nmonitoring  to  ensure  safety.  ADB  will  also  help  implement  the  latest  signaling \ntechnology and a communications-based train control system. \nEstablish  an  efficient  and  sustainable  metro  rail  organization.  The  Mumbai \nmetro operations organization will be responsible for the O&M of all metro lines in \nMumbai. ADB support will help train staff; recruit qualified personnel; and develop \nstandard operating procedures, training manuals, and aids, including procurement \nof training equipment such as simulators. \nEstablish last-mile connectivity solutions. Public transport systems often have \npoor last-mile connectivity that makes reaching the final destination a challenge \nfor passengers. To overcome this limitation, ADB is helping the MMRDA to ensure \nlast-mile connectivity through nonmotorized transport and electric vehicles.  \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  urban  mobility  in  the  MMR  improved \n(footnote  5).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  efficiency,  safety,  and  gender-  and \nsocial-inclusiveness of rail-based urban transit system in Mumbai city increased.13 \n \n\n                                                \n9  The metro rail line numbers are a legacy of previous studies and do not reflect priority of importance or sequencing. \n10 The civil works progress is about 40% on Lines 2A and 7, and about 15% on Line 2B. These civil works are being \n\nentirely funded by the government and do not involve ADB financing. \n\n11 New  Development  Bank  is  financing  in  parallel  certain  specific  traction  and  power  equipment  to  the  extent  of \n\napproximately $260 million. This will be under a separate contract and not administered by ADB. \n\n12 The Mumbai Metro rail will use grade of automation 4, the highest grade of automation that involves automatic train \n\nprotection, operation, and control. \n\n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nC. \n \n12. \nOutput 1: Rolling stock operational. This will include the design, procurement, testing, \nand commissioning for  operation  of  378  standard-gauge  rolling  stock  carriages, comprising  63 \ntrain  sets  in  a  configuration  of  6  cars  each.  The  rolling  stock  will  have  built-in  safety  features; \ndesign features for the elderly, children, women, and differently abled; and will be energy-efficient. \nThe rolling stock supplier will have an obligation under the contracts to remedy defects, to supply \nspare  parts,  and  to  provide  training  to  the  maintenance  staff  of  the  Mumbai  metro  operations \norganization for 2 years after the date of supply.  \n \n13. \nOutput  2:  Signaling,  train  control,  and  telecommunications  systems  operational. \nThis includes the design, supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of a modern signaling \nand  train  control  system  using  radio  communications-based  train control  technology,  including \ncomputerized  interlocking  and  automatic  train  protection.  Stations  will  have  platform  access \nsystems and automatic platform edge doors fitted for the elderly, children, women, and differently \nabled to ensure a high level of operational safety.  \n \n14. \n Output 3: Institutional support for Mumbai metro operations organization and last-\nmile  connectivity  provided.  Consulting  support  will  be  provided  for  the  establishment  of  the \nMumbai metro operations organization, which will be responsible for operating and maintaining \nall  rail-based  urban  transit  lines  within  the  MMRDA  territory.  This  will  serve  as  a  template  for \nintegrated  operations  for  future  lines.  The  MMRDA  will  develop  gender  equality  and  social \ninclusion actions for the Mumbai metro operations organization, and provide support for a metro \noperations  and  training  center  and  procure  special  software,  computer-based  tutorials, \nsimulators, other training aids and equipment to ensure readiness for O&M. Nonmotorized and \nelectric vehicles will be piloted at select stations to enhance last-mile connectivity. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,415  million  (Table  1).

The technical designs \nand  specifications  are  in  accordance  with  applicable  international  standards.  The  executing \nagency prepared  project reports, detailed designs, and specifications. As per the specifications, \nrolling stock will be of modern design, lightweight, made of stainless steel or aluminum, and with \nregenerative braking. Modern signaling systems will be used that employ communications-based \ntrain control technology to enhance safety and efficiency. Platform screen doors will be installed \nto separate the station platform from the train and to prevent accidents. \n \n21. \nThe climate risk screening indicated a low risk to the project. Mumbai is prone to flooding, \nand an increase in both extreme rainfall events and the number of wet days is predicted. Flooding \nis  therefore  the  key  climate  risk.  Climate  models  did  not  forecast  temperature  increase  to  be \nsevere, with an average of 1.1\u00b0C\u20131.8\u00b0C during 2030\u20132050.17 The entire metro rail line is elevated \nand will have a vertical minimum clearance of 5.5 meters, while the rail level  will be about 9.5 \nmeters above the road level. The risk of flooding of the metro rail lines is therefore very low. \n  \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \n22. \naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines,  and  compared  the  project  costs  and  benefits  in  with-  and \nwithout- project cases, using a 9% discount rate, economic internal rate of return (EIRR), and net \npresent  value  as  decision  criteria.18 The  project  is  expected  to  deliver  significant  benefits  to \nsociety through savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time for both public transport and \n\n                                                \n17 The Energy and Resources Institute. 2014.

The  project  will  also  deliver  social  and  economic  benefits  from  reduced  road \naccidents,  improved  railway  passenger  safety,  and  reduced  carbon  dioxide  emissions  and  air \npollution, which have been quantified in the analysis. The EIRR for Lines 2A and 2B is estimated \nto be 16.5%, and for Line 7, 14.8%. The overall EIRR for the project is 16.1%, with a net present \nvalue  of  over  \u20b9197  billion.  The  evaluation  included  a  sensitivity  analysis  to  investigate  the \neconomic viability of the project given adverse changes in costs and benefits. The EIRR remained \nabove 9% under all scenarios, demonstrating that the project would remain economically viable \ngiven adverse changes in costs and benefits. The metro lines will also contribute significantly to \nMumbai\u2019s economic growth by structuring land use and transport patterns. \n \n23. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines.19 It  assessed  the  incremental  costs  and  earnings  that  would \naccrue to the MMRDA as a result of the project, and calculated the financial internal rate of return. \nThe project\u2019s weighted average cost of capital was estimated to be 2.83%. For the purposes of \nfinancial  sustainability,  capital  costs  include  the  costs  of  construction  of  the  metro  line  and  its \nassociated facilities, including stations, a maintenance depot, and assets to be financed by ADB \n(rolling stock and signaling). O&M costs include all staff costs, unit maintenance costs, and energy \ncosts. The evaluation assumes traffic at commencement of operations will be 25% of forecast, \nwhich  is  increased  to  forecast  estimates  in  the  fourth  year  after  commencement.  The  project \nrevenues  include  ticket  sales,  advertisements,  and  rentals  at  metro  stations.  All  financial \nprojections are made in 2017 rupees, in real terms. The estimated financial internal rate of return \nof the net cash flows for Lines 2A and 2B taken together is 5.02%, in real terms, which is above \nthe weighted average cost of capital. Details are in the financial analysis.20 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nInstitutional  capacity.  The  MMRDA  was  established  through  legislation  under  the \nMumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority Act, 1974, and has been functioning for over \n40 years. Its objective was to increase economic activity in the MMR by promoting infrastructure \ndevelopment and improving the quality of life. The broad responsibilities of the MMRDA include  \n(i) preparing regional development plans, (ii) providing financial assistance for significant regional \nprojects,  (iii)  providing  help  to  local  authorities  and  their  infrastructure  projects,  and  \n(iv) coordinating execution of project schemes in the MMR. The MMRDA conceives, promotes, \nand  monitors  key  projects  to  develop  new  MMR  growth  centers,  and  makes  improvements  in \nsectors  such  as  transport,  housing,  water  supply,  and  environment.  The  metropolitan \ncommissioner is a senior officer of the Government of Maharashtra and the functional head of the \nMMRDA. The MMRDA is one of the most empowered agencies in the state to raise capital and \nimplement infrastructure projects. It has adequate capacity to implement this project. \n \n25. \nFinancial management. This is ADB\u2019s first project with the MMRDA, but the agency is \nquite familiar with the World Bank requirements, having implemented previous projects, and is \nworking on large projects assisted by JICA. Fund flows are entirely through the budgetary process \nand revenue accruals from land development. All transactions are recorded through double-entry, \naccrual-based systems and are subject to statutory audit by the comptroller and auditor general \n(CAG) of India in line with India\u2019s constitutional provisions. Audited accounts are submitted to the \nstate legislature. In addition, transaction audits are also carried out periodically during the year by \nthe state accountant general to ensure conformity with relevant codes and standards. A financial \nmanagement system based on off-the-shelf accounting software is used. Annual statements of \n\n                                                \n19 ADB. 2005. Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n20 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nproject accounts are subject to audit by the accountant general, an arm of the CAG at the state \nlevel, in accordance with auditing standards promulgated by the CAG. A review of the audits from \nFY2015  to  FY2017  indicates  no  major  adverse  audit  comments.  The  MMRDA  is  a  very  large \norganization with multiple projects, and its responsiveness to ADB reporting requirements for a \nsingle project has yet to be tested; the financial management risk is therefore rated moderate. \n \nProcurement. The project procurement risk is rated low. The MMRDA is experienced with \n26. \nprocurement  and  consultant  recruitment  for  the  World  Bank  and  JICA  projects,  regular \nprocurement for its own projects,  as well as in the use of public\u2212private partnerships for some \nprojects. The MMRDA has entrusted the DMRC with the complete work for Line 2A, as well as \nthe procurement and commissioning of rolling stock, signaling, and platform access systems for \nthe three lines.21 The DMRC successfully developed and operates the Delhi metro rail network, \nwhich is the largest system in India. The DMRC has also prepared the detailed designs for most \nmetro rail projects in India, and acts as an implementing agency or advisor in many metros and \nprojects, including the ADB-financed Jaipur Metro project, and some outside the country.22  ADB \nfinancing  for  this  project  will  be  primarily  for  three  large  goods  supply  contracts  (rolling  stock, \nsignaling,  and  platform  access  systems);  procurement  commenced  in  May  2018.  Project \nreadiness is high. The procurement plan is in the PAM. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MMRDA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \nPoverty. This is an urban transport project in the MMR, and the project\u2019s zone of influence \n28. \nincludes a population of about 12 million urban residents. In 2011, about 20% of the population in \nthese districts lived in poverty. Business, urban services, and wage labor are the main sources of \nlivelihood  in the  project area.  An efficient  metro rail  system  providing  urban  mass transit  is  an \nessential requirement for the MMR. This project will cater to about 2,000,000 passengers per day \nafter  operations  stabilize;  improve  urban  transport  safety  and  comfort;  and  provide  residents, \nespecially the poor and vulnerable, with improved access to economic opportunities and social \nservice facilities.  \n \nGender  equality  and  social  inclusion.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender \n29. \nmainstreaming. The MMRDA and ADB conducted extensive consultations with stakeholders in \npreparing a gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan with well-defined activities, \nindicators, targets, and timeframes.23 The GESI action plan provides activities integrated within \nthe project design, including (i) gender-responsive and socially inclusive design features across \nall infrastructure; (ii) affirmative measures to enhance women\u2019s safe mobility such as  \u201cwomen-\nonly  coaches,\u201d  mobile  applications  for  women\u2019s  security,  and  instruction  boards  with  helpline \nnumbers and color-coded directional signs; (iii) special initiatives such as priority e-ticket counters \nfor the elderly and differently abled, separate ticketing counters and vending machines for women, \nreporting  desks to address  incidents  of  harassment, quotas to  ensure  a portion  of commercial \nspaces  in  metro  stations  are  assigned  to  enterprises  owned  by  or  operated  by  women,  and \n                                                \n21  The procurement and implementation of the civil works for Lines 2B and 7 is being done by MMRDA. \n22 ADB. 2013.

The Project involves construction of underground rail infrastructure \nof 2.3 kilometers and two stations. Commercial operations for the project is targeted in Q3 2019. \n\n23 Stakeholders  included  state  government  entities  in  municipalities  working  in  gender,  academia,  and  civil  society \n\norganizations; MMRDA women staff; staff at metro stations on Line 1; and women commuters. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fthe \n\nimpacts  of \n\nSafeguards \n\ntransformative \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nestablishment  of  a  station  staffed  only  by  women.  The  project  will  help  establish  a  gender-\ninclusive agency, the Mumbai metro operations organization, with attention to women\u2019s equitable \nemployment,  GESI  aspects,  and \nits  operations.  The \nmultistakeholder GESI advisory committee will guide the project and will support the development \nof a GESI policy for the Mumbai metro operations organization. Toward project completion, the \nMMRDA will conduct an impact study to evaluate the project\u2019s socioeconomic impact on the lives \nof at least 2,000 Mumbai residents (40% women). \n \nHealth. The project will provide an additional safe transport system in an existing urban \n30. \narea and is not expected to significantly increase the incidence of sexually transmitted infections \nincluding HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. \n \nE. \n \n31. \ncategories are as follows.24  \n  \nEnvironment (category B). The project scope for ADB\u2019s financing involves specific items \n32. \nof goods supply for Lines 2A, 2B, and 7 of the Mumbai Metro Rail network. No civil works are \nfinanced by ADB. The key long-term environmental impact anticipated is noise and vibration from \nthe operation of the rolling stock. However, given the existing noisy conditions in the project area \ndue to heavy road traffic, the incremental impacts are expected to be minimal. Some occupational \nhealth and safety impacts may also be experienced during the installation and operation of the \nrolling stock and signaling and telecommunication systems. However, these are expected to be \nminor and easily mitigated. The MMRDA prepared an initial environmental examination report, \nincluding  an  environmental  management  plan  and  environmental  monitoring  plan,  for  all  three \nlines.  The  MMRDA  and  ADB  agreed  to  closely  monitor  environmental  impacts  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n33. \nThe  civil  works  for  the  three  elevated  lines  are  considered  an  \u201cassociated  facility\u201d  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  because  they  are  not  funded  under  the \nproject,  but  the  viability  and  operation  of  the  lines  and  the  ADB-funded  components  are \nexclusively  interdependent.  An  environmental  due  diligence  review  was  carried  out  for  the \nongoing civil  works to assess compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The review \nidentified a few areas for improvement for which corrective measures have been prepared.  \n   \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). The project scope for ADB\u2019s financing does not \n34. \ninclude civil works. The MMRDA has acquired private land and assets based on the provisions of \nnational law, state law, and sector policy.25 Due diligence with regard to involuntary resettlement \nsafeguards  implementation  was  conducted  for  the  three  lines  to  assess  if  safeguards  are \nconsistent with applicable ADB requirements. Due diligence reports indicate that MMRDA land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  plans  are  prepared  and  implemented  to  ensure  that  (i)  affected \npersons, including informal settlers, are compensated for lost assets prior to displacement and at \nreplacement cost; (ii) income restoration programs are in place for those whose livelihood will be \naffected; (iii) there is meaningful consultation and information disclosure; (iv) the standard of living \nof  displaced  poor  and  other  vulnerable groups  is  improved;  and (v)  there  are  mechanisms  for \n\n                                                \n24  ADB.
