It is an important industrial \nand  commercial  center  and  transport  and  logistics  hub,  with  a  railway  network  of  1,450 \nkilometers (km), which includes five trunk lines and two branch lines, an expressway network of \n1,900 km with two ring roads and eight trunk expressways, and an inland waterway network with \na  freight  traffic  throughput  of  145  million  tons  annually.  Further  development  of  the  city  as  a \nregional transport and logistics hub will facilitate increased economic growth in the central and \nwestern region of the PRC, which remains underdeveloped compared with the eastern region. \n \nThe logistics sector in the PRC,4 while stronger than many Asian countries, trails behind \n4. \nseveral developed nations. According to the World Bank\u2019s logistics performance index, the PRC \nhas a global ranking of 27 (1 is the best and 160 is the worst).5 The PRC\u2019s ranking indicates a \npotential for improvement. On 11 June 2014, the State Council approved a plan to develop the \nlogistics  industry.  This  reaffirms  the  government\u2019s  continued  emphasis  on  improving  and \nreforming  the  logistics  sector,  which  is  expected  to  continue  during  the  Thirteenth  Five-Year \nPlan of the PRC.6 \n \n5. \nExisting logistics constraints. In 2015, Chongqing handled 1.1 billion tons of cargo at \n24  locations  within  the  inner  city  region  and  ring  road  in  Chongqing.  The  movement  of  freight \ntrucks  in  urban  areas  worsens  traffic  congestion,  creates  air  pollution,  and  slows  down  the \ndelivery  time  for  goods.  Moreover,  most  of  these  small  logistics  centers  do  not  have  enough \nparking  spaces,  resulting  in  large  trucks  being  parked  along  the  streets  causing  more  traffic \ncongestion. Since April 2014, the government has restricted the movement of big freight trucks \nin parts of the inner city during certain times of the day. These restrictions are expected to be \nfurther tightened to cope with growing traffic congestion. While this has provided some relief to \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Chongqing  Integrated \n\nLogistics Demonstration Project. \n\n3  The PRC\u2019s six national central cities are Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin. \n4   The  logistics  sector  is  responsible  for  the  management  of  the  flow  of  goods  between  the  point  of  origin  and  the \n\npoint of consumption in order to meet the requirements of customers or corporations. \n\n5  World Bank. 2016.

Outline of \nthe Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nBeijing (adopted in 2016). \n\n\fthe traffic congestion problem, the trucks idle just outside the inner city for several hours before \nthey are allowed to enter, thus contributing to considerable air pollution. There is also a risk that \nthe supply of daily commodities used by local residents may be affected. The government plans \nto  create  the  new  logistics  parks  beyond  the  inner  ring  road  as  a  long-term  solution  to  these \nproblems.  The  existing  logistics  centers  in  the  inner  city  would  gradually  be  consolidated  and \ntransferred to the new logistics parks. The new parks would combine all of the logistics functions \nin  one  location  which  will  eliminate  unnecessary  freight  movements.  The  parks  will  also \nintegrate the various transport modes such as railways, highways and inland waterway resulting \nin the development of an efficient multimodal logistics system. These improvements will reduce \nlogistics costs, which in turn may result in lower prices of consumer goods. \n \n6. \nInternational  rail  corridor.  In  2010,  Chongqing  launched  a  new  transport  initiative  by \ndeveloping  the  Chongqing\u2013Xinjiang\u2013Europe International  Railway  Corridor.  The  rail  corridor  is \nnow fully operational and offers a faster way to transport freight from the PRC to Europe than by \nsea and at a fraction of the cost of air transport. This provides an attractive option for shippers of \nhigh-value cargo or moderately perishable cargo that cannot tolerate 40 days of transit time by \nsea or cannot afford the high cost of air transport. This corridor, with a total length of 11,200 km, \ntakes  16  days  from  Chongqing  to  Duisburg,  Germany  through  Belarus,  Kazakhstan,  Poland, \nand  Russia.  This  new  route  is  also  called  the  \u201cNew  Silk  Road,\u201d  and  is  expected  to  become  a \nmajor  freight  corridor.  Growing  traffic  demand  for  this  route  needs  matching  logistics \ninfrastructure to handle transshipments and related processes such as sorting, packaging, and \nstorage. \n \n7. \nInland water transport. Chongqing is one of the most important inland ports in the PRC. \nThe development of the Three Gorges Dam has increased the shipping capacity of the Yangtze \nRiver. The dam has made the river deeper and slower, allowing for easier navigation, especially \nupstream,  for  cargo  and  passenger  vessels.  The  limiting  factor  for  cargo,  however,  is  the \ncapacity of the ship lock across the 181 meter high dam. Presently, container ships have to wait \nfor several days in order to pass the dam. To avoid delays, shippers unload goods upstream of \nthe  dam  and  often  transfer  goods  to  their  final  destination  by  road.  The  delays  and  costs  of \nloading and unloading goods on vessels deter shippers from using inland waterway transport. \n\n \nRo-Ro  is  a  mode  of  shipping  that  can  reduce  these  disadvantages.  It  is  designed  to \n8. \ncarry rolling cargo that does not require cranes for loading or off-loading. Loading and unloading \ncan be made easier and faster  as Ro-Ro ships are designed to allow wheeled cargo, such as \ntrucks and trailers, to be driven on and off the ship on their own wheels. This reduces the labor, \nequipment,  and  time  required  in  a  port;  lowers  transport  costs;  and  improves  the  quality  of \nfreight delivery service. The introduction of Ro-Ro ships will enable freight companies to use the \ninland  waterway  as a transport mode for  moving their  cargo.  The Ro-Ro  concept  needs  to  be \ndemonstrated successfully for it to be widely adopted by various shipping companies, including \nthose in the private sector. \n \n9. \nLogistics  information  system.  The  logistics  information  systems  in  the  PRC  are  not \nfully  developed.  The  existing  systems  provide  information  related  to  a  single  transport  mode \n(e.g.,  tracking cargo moving  on road  transport), and there  is  little  integration  between different \ntransport  modes.  Limited  information  is  available  in  the  public  domain,  making  it  difficult  for \ntransportation  companies  and  freight  forwarding  companies  to  operate  efficiently.  Poor \ninformation-sharing  creates  a  bottleneck  for  logistics  and  results  in  higher  costs  and  delays. \nThere  is  a  need  to  develop  an  accessible  information  system  that  could  be  used  by  all  the \nlogistics  centers  and  service providers. This  will  enable the  logistics  companies specializing  in \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fone or more aspects of logistic operations to work seamlessly together in a more efficient and \ncost effective manner. \n \n10. \nDemonstration  features. The  proposed  project  is  the  third  urban  development  project \nin Chongqing. Lessons from past and ongoing projects7 were incorporated in the project design, \nsuch  as  devolving  more  responsibilities  to  the  implementing  agency  while  strengthening  its \nproject  management  and  financial  management  capacity.  The  proposed  project  will  have \ndemonstration  features,  namely  integrated  logistics  parks,  logistics  information  system,  and \ninland waterway Ro-Ro operations. These features are all relatively new for logistics projects in \nthe  PRC,  and  their  successful  introduction  through  this  project  will  offer  opportunities  for \nreplication and scaling up. Integrated logistics functions and services in the new logistics parks \nwill  reduce  wasteful  freight  movements.  Logistics  information  services  will  enable  logistics \nservice providers, such as freight forwarding companies, to increase efficiency and reduce costs \nthrough better tracking and control over the supply chain. Ro-Ro operations will reduce the time \nand costs of transshipments, incentivizing freight movement on inland waterways. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  plans  of  the  Government  of  the  PRC  to  develop  the \n11. \nlogistics sector and is in line with the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (footnote 6). The project is also \nclosely  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  priorities  to  develop  the  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt8 \nand  the  Silk  Road  Economic  Belt  initiative.9 The  project\u2019s  focus  on  logistics  development  is  in \nline  with  the  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  which \nhighlights  logistics  improvements  as  an  important  opportunity  for  sustainable  transport \noperations.10 The  project  also  draws  on  the  recommendations  of  the  previous  ADB  study  on \nlogistics development in the PRC.11 \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  the  improvement  of  logistics  services  in  the  Yangtze \nRiver  Economic Belt  and  the  Silk  Road  Economic  Belt. The  outcome  of the  project  will  be  the \ndemonstration of an efficient and integrated multimodal logistics system in Chongqing. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Chongqing  transportation  logistics  park  developed.  This  output  will \ndevelop  a  park  to  handle  the  international  freight  movements.  This  will  have  three  functional \nareas:  (i)  a roadway  logistics  hub,12 (ii)  a  logistics financial  exchange center,13 and (iii)  a  road-\nrail intermodal logistics hub. This will be the major terminal for Chongqing, located at Tuanjiecun \nwithin  the  Shapingba  district  and  at  the  starting  point  of  the  Chongqing\u2013Xinjiang\u2013Europe  line. \nThe completion of the logistics park will directly support and benefit the international rail corridor \noperations. \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2010.

The  logistics \nparks  will  implement  environmental  management  system  certified  under  the  International \nOrganization  for  Standardization  14001.  The  logistics  exchange  center  within  the  Chongqing \ntransportation  logistics  park  will  conform  to  the Chongqing green  building guidelines.  A further \ndetailed  technical  review  conducted  on  green  building  certification,  storm  water  management, \nand  rain  water  re-use  confirmed  the  adequacy  of  designs.  The  design  of  the  project\u2019s  inland \nwaterway  Ro-Ro  transport  output  was  also  found  to  be  appropriate  as  it  reduces  the  freight \nhandling  time  and  improves  operational  efficiency.  The  corresponding  port  facilities  needed  to \nsupport  the  Ro-Ro  operations  have  also  been  evaluated  and  confirmed  to  have  adequate \ncapacity. The capacity of the CMG is considered adequate to implement the project\u2019s advanced \ntechnical and sustainable transport aspects.  \n \n25. \nClimate  change  risk. An initial climate risk and vulnerability analysis study determined \nthat  there  will  be  an  increased  risk  of  intensity  and  frequency  of  extreme  storm  events  and \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nflooding as a result of climate change and a significant increase in temperature.16 The capacity \nof  storm-water  drainage  will  be  increased,  and  the  logistics  park  designs  have  integrated  a \nrange of soft and hard-engineered measures to increase flood retention capacity. This includes \npermeable paving, artificial wetlands, and a roof storm-water collection and re-use system. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nThe project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of \n17.7%  and  net  present  value  of  CNY967.4  million  at  a  12.0%  discount  rate.  The  estimate \ncovered the four transport-related outputs for which the quantitative economic benefits could be \nestimated  (excluding  the  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  component).  The \nestimated  costs  include  investment  in  civil  works  and  equipment,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and operation and maintenance. The estimated benefits include savings in vehicle \noperating costs, travel time, accident costs, and reduction in carbon dioxide emissions for freight \nshifting  from  the  road  to  inland  waterway  traffic.  The  sensitivity  analysis  of  potential  cost \noverruns and benefit reductions demonstrates that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust.17 \n \n27. \nThe financial evaluation was carried out for the three revenue-generating components\u2014 \nthe  two  logistics  parks  and  the  inland  waterway  Ro-Ro  transport.  The  logistics  information \nsystem component, aimed at serving overall transportation logistics, is not expected to recover \ncosts  in  the  foreseeable  future,  and  no  specific  revenues  have  been  estimated  for  the \ncomponent. The rest of the components will generate revenues from rental, logistics operations, \nand transportation services, with pricing subject to government monitoring and intervention (e.g. \nsubsidies)  to  some  extent.  The  weighted  average  costs  of  capital  of  the  three  revenue-\ngenerating  components  are  computed  to  be  3.4%  for  the  Chongqing  transportation  logistics \npark, 3.5% for the Nanpeng logistics park, and 3.1% for the  inland waterway Ro-Ro transport. \nThe financial evaluation results in a financial internal rate of return of 8.4%, 10.2%, and 10.4% \nfor the above revenue-generating components. Since these values are higher than the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  for  all  three  components,  they  are  considered  financially  viable.  The \nsensitivity  analysis  confirms  the  robustness  of  the financial  viability  of  these  components.  The \nCQTG\u2019s  financial  performance  was  analyzed  based  on  the  consolidated  audited  financial \nstatements during 2010\u20132014. The company has experienced strong growth at a compounded \nannual growth rate of 13% for revenues and 12% for total assets. While the passenger market is \nmaturing, the CQTG is well-positioned to grow in the cargo and logistics business, capitalizing \non  Chongqing\u2019s  strategic  location  as logistics center  in the  western region of the  country.  The \nfinancial  projection  indicates  its  long-term  financial  sustainability  with  reduced  reliance  on \ngovernment subsidies given its expansion into nonsubsidized businesses. \n \nC. \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \n28. \nADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  relevant  sections  of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement \ndocuments and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  executing  agency,  the  implementing  agency,  and  the  PMO.  Specific  policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  13).  An \nassessment  of  financial  management  capacity  indicates  that  the  executing  agency  and  the \nimplementing agency carefully follow PRC policies and procedures for accounting and financial \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n16  Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nthe \n\nthe  project \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nis  considered  adequate, \n\nimplementation  units  are  new \n\nfinancial  management  capacity \n\nthe \nmanagement.

Training on procurement, disbursement, and financial management will be \nprovided in advance and during project implementation.  \n \nD. \n \nA  social  and  poverty  analysis  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  Per \n29. \ncapita gross domestic product in Chongqing is slightly higher (CNY47,859) than that of the PRC \n(CNY46,531), while 2.7% of the total population in the project area is under the minimum living \nstandard security program. This project will directly benefit 2.92 million people living in the three \nproject  districts  and  indirectly  benefit  8.19  million  residents,  and  8,412  logistics  business \ncompanies  with  over  600,000  employees.  The  benefits  of  this  project  include  (i)  improved \nlogistics facilities, operations, and management efficiency; (ii) assured commodity supplies used \nin the daily life of local residents; (iii) reduced costs of freight transport; (iv) improved transport \nsafety  and  reduced  congestion  in  urban  areas;  (v)  reduced  pollution  and  vehicle  emissions  in \nurban  areas;  and  (vi)  increased  employment  opportunities.  The  project  will  create  426  skilled \nand  5,400  unskilled  jobs  for  both  men  and  women  in  the  logistics  industry  with  additional \nopportunities during project facility construction. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  category  B  for  environment.  A  consolidated  initial \nenvironmental examination and an environmental management plan (EMP) that cover all project \ncomponents  have  been  prepared. 18  These  documents  comply  with  the  PRC\u2019s  regulatory \nrequirements  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  have  been  disclosed  on  the \nADB  website. 19  Public  consultations  were  carried  out  to  inform  the  project  design  and \nenvironmental  assessment  process  and  will  continue  during  project  implementation.  The  EMP \noutlines  potential  impacts,  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures,  institutional  arrangements, \ntraining  requirements,  and  an  implementation  budget  of  0.2%  of  the  total  project  budget. \nCapacity development and institutional strengthening will be provided to minimize environmental \nrisks. Environmental complaints will be handled through a project safeguards grievance redress \nmechanism. \n \n31. \nThe  project  will  demonstrate  the  synergistic  benefits  of  an  integrated  eco-logistics \napproach to design and provide an international benchmark for industrial building development \nin  the  PRC.  The  logistics  park  layout,  orientation,  buildings,  landscaping,  mechanical,  and \nelectrical  systems  have  been  optimized  to  conserve  energy,  water,  and  materials;  and  to \nminimize  the  generation  of  pollutant  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  during  the  design, \nconstruction,  and  operation  phases.  These  efficiencies  are  likely  to  result  in  significant  cost \nsavings for the operator.  \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n32. \nThe  economic  analysis  demonstrates  that  the  project  will  result  in  an  approximate  net \nreduction  of  18,000  tons  of  carbon  emissions  per  annum,  as  a  result  of  improved  efficiencies \nand  the  modal  shift  from  road  to  inland  waterways,  although  these  savings  may  be  offset  by \ninduced  freight  traffic  and  embodied  carbon  during  construction.  Total  carbon  emissions  from \n\n                                                \n18 Initial Environmental Examination including EMP (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. Chongqing Integrated Logistics Demonstration Project: Initial Environmental Examination. \n\nhttp://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-chongqing-integrated-logistics-demo-project-dec-2015-iee.  \n\n\fthe  operation  of  the  project  are  approximately  34,000  tons  per  annum  when  the  project \ncomponents are fully operational. \n\n \n\nthe  Chongqing  transportation \n\n33. \nAnticipated  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  risks  are modest  and  can be  limited  to \nan  acceptable  level  through  EMP  implementation  and  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  The \nmain  potential  environmental  impacts  are  noise,  air  pollution  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions, \nand  disposal  of  solid  waste.  The  closest  residences  are  within  300  meters,  and  the  Liangtan \nRiver is 2 km from the site. No other sensitive environmental receptors have been identified in \nthe project area of influence. \n \nInvoluntary  Resettlement.  The  project  is  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement.  A \n34. \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for \nlogistics  park \ncomponent. 20 It  will  acquire  a  total  of  675.13  mu  of  collective  land  that  includes  433.15  of \ncultivable  land,  40.26  mu  of  homestead  land,  18.25  mu  of  garden  land,  13.85  mu  of  forestry \nland,  and 169.62 mu  of waste  land and construction  land.21 The  house demolition  will  affect  a \ntotal  of  89  households.  A  total  of  488  people  (99  households)  will  be  significantly  affected  by \nboth  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition.  This  includes  the  relocation  of  five  enterprises, \naffecting  94  workers.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  impacts  have  been \nadequately assessed, and the appropriate mitigated measures are included in the resettlement \nplan. The LAR is expected to be completed prior to December 2017. The executing agency has \nadequate experience and staff resources in managing LAR impacts, and training was provided \non  ADB  requirements  during  the  project  preparation.  The  cost  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement is CNY205 million. The executing agency assured ADB that adequate counterpart \nfunding will be made available for LAR, in line with the annual funding requirements stipulated in \nthe resettlement plan. The LAR unit of the implementing agency will work closely with the district \nofficials for internal supervision and will engage an independent external monitor for semiannual \nmonitoring and reporting. Meaningful consultations will continue throughout the project cycle as \nscheduled. A grievance redress mechanism has been established to facilitate the resolution of \ncomplaints  regarding  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  The  resettlement  plan  has \nbeen disclosed to the affected persons and published on the ADB website (footnote 22). If there \nare any changes, the resettlement plan will be revised and disclosed to affected persons.  \n \nIn  2010,  the  Nanpeng  logistics  park  component  involved  a  total  land  acquisition  of \n35. \n356.84 mu of rural collective land, and house demolition affected 46 households. A total of 324 \npeople  from  92  households  were  affected  by  resettlement,  including  157  people  from  46 \nhouseholds  affected  by  the  land  acquisition,  and  167  people  from  46  households  affected  by \nboth the land acquisition and house demolition. The total cost was CNY47.18 million. The land \nacquisition  and  house  demolition  started  on  5  May  2010,  and  payment  of  compensation  was \ncompleted  on  30  November  2011.  Additional  compensation  payments  for  relocation  to  new \napartments  were  provided  on  30  December  2014.  A  due  diligence  report  was  prepared  to \nconfirm the procedures.22 It includes some actions to address the remaining resettlement issues. \nThis report has also been disclosed to the public.23 \n \n\n                                                \n20  Resettlement  Plan:  Chongqing  Transportation  Logistics  Park  (Output  1)  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n21 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 667 square meters; 15 mu = 1 hectare). \n22 Resettlement  Due  Diligence  Report  for  Nanpeng  Logistics  Park  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n23 The due diligence report is accessible at http://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-chongqing-integrated-\n\nlogistics-demonstration-project-nlp-rpddr.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nIndigenous  peoples.
