THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Chongqing Integrated Logistics Demonstration \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project will develop a modern and efficient multimodal logistics system in Chongqing. \nThe outputs of the project will be (i) the Chongqing transportation logistics park, (ii) the Nanpeng \nlogistics park, (iii) the Yangtze River inland waterway roll-on roll-off (Ro-Ro) operations, (iv) a \nlogistics information system, and (v) institutional capacity building.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Chongqing is a major city along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in southwest \nPRC,  and  one  of  the  six  national  central  cities.3 Covering  a  total  area  of  82,400  square \nkilometers and with a population of 30 million, it is the largest directly administered municipality \nand comprises 19 districts, 15 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. It is an important industrial \nand  commercial  center  and  transport  and  logistics  hub,  with  a  railway  network  of  1,450 \nkilometers (km), which includes five trunk lines and two branch lines, an expressway network of \n1,900 km with two ring roads and eight trunk expressways, and an inland waterway network with \na freight traffic throughput of 145 million tons annually. Further development of the city as a \nregional transport and logistics hub will facilitate increased economic growth in the central and \nwestern region of the PRC, which remains underdeveloped compared with the eastern region. \n \n4.  The logistics sector in the PRC,4 while stronger than many Asian countries, trails behind \nseveral developed nations. According to the World Bank\u2019s logistics performance index, the PRC \nhas a global ranking of 27 (1 is the best and 160 is the worst).5 The PRC\u2019s ranking indicates a \npotential for improvement. On 11 June 2014, the State Council approved a plan to develop the \nlogistics  industry.  This  reaffirms  the  government\u2019s  continued  emphasis  on  improving  and \nreforming the logistics sector, which is expected to continue during the Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan of the PRC.6 \n \n5.  Existing logistics constraints. In 2015, Chongqing handled 1.1 billion tons of cargo at \n24 locations within the inner city region and ring road in Chongqing. The movement of freight \ntrucks in urban areas worsens traffic congestion, creates air pollution, and slows down the \ndelivery time for goods. Moreover, most of these small logistics centers do not have enough \nparking spaces, resulting in large trucks being parked along the streets causing more traffic \ncongestion. Since April 2014, the government has restricted the movement of big freight trucks \nin parts of the inner city during certain times of the day. These restrictions are expected to be \nfurther tightened to cope with growing traffic congestion. While this has provided some relief to \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Chongqing Integrated \nLogistics Demonstration Project. \n3  The PRC\u2019s six national central cities are Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin. \n4  The logistics sector is responsible for the management of the flow of goods between the point of origin and the \npoint of consumption in order to meet the requirements of customers or corporations. \n5  World Bank. 2016. International LPI Global Ranking. Washington, DC. \n6  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Commission. 2015. Outline of \nthe Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nBeijing (adopted in 2016). ", "2 \nthe traffic congestion problem, the trucks idle just outside the inner city for several hours before \nthey are allowed to enter, thus contributing to considerable air pollution. There is also a risk that \nthe supply of daily commodities used by local residents may be affected. The government plans \nto create the new logistics parks beyond the inner ring road as a long-term solution to these \nproblems. The existing logistics centers in the inner city would gradually be consolidated and \ntransferred to the new logistics parks. The new parks would combine all of the logistics functions \nin  one  location  which  will  eliminate  unnecessary  freight  movements.  The  parks  will  also \nintegrate the various transport modes such as railways, highways and inland waterway resulting \nin the development of an efficient multimodal logistics system. These improvements will reduce \nlogistics costs, which in turn may result in lower prices of consumer goods. \n \n6.  International rail corridor. In 2010, Chongqing launched a new transport initiative by \ndeveloping the Chongqing\u2013Xinjiang\u2013Europe International Railway Corridor. The rail corridor is \nnow fully operational and offers a faster way to transport freight from the PRC to Europe than by \nsea and at a fraction of the cost of air transport. This provides an attractive option for shippers of \nhigh-value cargo or moderately perishable cargo that cannot tolerate 40 days of transit time by \nsea or cannot afford the high cost of air transport. This corridor, with a total length of 11,200 km, \ntakes 16 days from Chongqing to Duisburg, Germany through Belarus, Kazakhstan, Poland, \nand Russia. This new route is also called the \u201cNew Silk Road,\u201d and is expected to become a \nmajor  freight  corridor.  Growing  traffic  demand  for  this  route  needs  matching  logistics \ninfrastructure to handle transshipments and related processes such as sorting, packaging, and \nstorage. \n \n7.  Inland water transport. Chongqing is one of the most important inland ports in the PRC. \nThe development of the Three Gorges Dam has increased the shipping capacity of the Yangtze \nRiver. The dam has made the river deeper and slower, allowing for easier navigation, especially \nupstream, for cargo and passenger vessels. The limiting factor for cargo, however, is the \ncapacity of the ship lock across the 181 meter high dam. Presently, container ships have to wait \nfor several days in order to pass the dam. To avoid delays, shippers unload goods upstream of \nthe dam and often transfer goods to their final destination by road. The delays and costs of \nloading and unloading goods on vessels deter shippers from using inland waterway transport. \n \n8.  Ro-Ro is a mode of shipping that can reduce these disadvantages. It is designed to \ncarry rolling cargo that does not require cranes for loading or off-loading. Loading and unloading \ncan be made easier and faster as Ro-Ro ships are designed to allow wheeled cargo, such as \ntrucks and trailers, to be driven on and off the ship on their own wheels. This reduces the labor, \nequipment, and time required in a port; lowers transport costs; and improves the quality of \nfreight delivery service. The introduction of Ro-Ro ships will enable freight companies to use the \ninland waterway as a transport mode for moving their cargo. The Ro-Ro concept needs to be \ndemonstrated successfully for it to be widely adopted by various shipping companies, including \nthose in the private sector. \n \n9.  Logistics information system. The logistics information systems in the PRC are not \nfully developed. The existing systems provide information related to a single transport mode \n(e.g., tracking cargo moving on road transport), and there is little integration between different \ntransport modes. Limited information is available in the public domain, making it difficult for \ntransportation  companies  and  freight  forwarding  companies  to  operate  efficiently.  Poor \ninformation-sharing creates a bottleneck for logistics and results in higher costs and delays. \nThere is a need to develop an accessible information system that could be used by all the \nlogistics centers and service providers. This will enable the logistics companies specializing in \n ", "3 \none or more aspects of logistic operations to work seamlessly together in a more efficient and \ncost effective manner. \n \n10.  Demonstration features. The proposed project is the third urban development project \nin Chongqing. Lessons from past and ongoing projects7 were incorporated in the project design, \nsuch as devolving more responsibilities to the implementing agency while strengthening its \nproject  management  and  financial  management  capacity.  The  proposed  project  will  have \ndemonstration features, namely integrated logistics parks, logistics information  system, and \ninland waterway Ro-Ro operations. These features are all relatively new for logistics projects in \nthe  PRC,  and  their  successful  introduction  through  this  project  will  offer  opportunities  for \nreplication and scaling up. Integrated logistics functions and services in the new logistics parks \nwill  reduce  wasteful  freight  movements.  Logistics  information  services  will  enable  logistics \nservice providers, such as freight forwarding companies, to increase efficiency and reduce costs \nthrough better tracking and control over the supply chain. Ro-Ro operations will reduce the time \nand costs of transshipments, incentivizing freight movement on inland waterways. \n \n11.  The project is consistent with the plans of the Government of the PRC to develop the \nlogistics sector and is in line with the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (footnote 6). The project is also \nclosely aligned with the government\u2019s priorities to develop the Yangtze River Economic Belt8 \nand the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative.9 The project\u2019s focus on logistics development is in \nline with the Sustainable Transport Initiative of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which \nhighlights  logistics  improvements  as  an  important  opportunity  for  sustainable  transport \noperations.10 The project also draws on the recommendations of the previous ADB study on \nlogistics development in the PRC.11 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the project will be the improvement of logistics services in the Yangtze \nRiver Economic Belt and the Silk Road Economic Belt. The outcome of the project will be the \ndemonstration of an efficient and integrated multimodal logistics system in Chongqing. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output  1:  Chongqing  transportation  logistics  park  developed.  This  output  will \ndevelop a park to handle the international freight movements. This will have three functional \nareas: (i) a roadway logistics hub,12 (ii) a logistics financial exchange center,13 and (iii) a road-\nrail intermodal logistics hub. This will be the major terminal for Chongqing, located at Tuanjiecun \nwithin the Shapingba district and at the starting point of the Chongqing\u2013Xinjiang\u2013Europe line. \nThe completion of the logistics park will directly support and benefit the international rail corridor \noperations. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2010.

Output 2: Nanpeng logistics park constructed. This output will develop a park to \ncater to serve as the main distribution center for Chongqing city. This will have three functional \nzones: (i) a freight transfer area, (ii) a customs inspection staging area, and (iii) a free trade \nzone. This terminal will be located at Nanpeng in the Banan district. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Yangtze  River  inland  waterway  Ro-Ro  transport  demonstrated. This \noutput will (i) build energy efficient Ro-Ro ships (approximately 4,000 tons each), (ii) procure \nalternate energy (e.g., liquefied petroleum gas) tractors and trailers for the Ro-Ro operation, and \n(iii) establish a Ro-Ro logistics information system. The Ro-Ro operation will use the Guojiatuo \nPort in Chongqing and the Yinxingtuo Port in Yichang. \n \n16.  Output  4:  Logistics information  system  established. This output will develop an \ninformation system that will (i) provide real time information on freight movements; (ii) facilitate \ninteraction  between freight forwarding  companies  and  transporters;  (iii)  enable government \nclearances through an online platform; and (iv) logistics value-added services such as insurance. \nThe logistics information system will serve as the integrated logistics information system for the \nentire city of Chongqing and as the platform for logistics information sharing, logistics operations, \nlogistics trading, government clearances, and logistics financial services. \n \n17.  Output  5:  Institutional  capacity  strengthened.  This  output  will  provide  technical \nsupport for project implementation and training to improve the management capacity of the staff \nin the executing agency and the implementing agency and other related entities involved with \nlogistics development and operations. \n \nD.

The government  has requested  a  loan  of $150  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will follow the straight-line repayment method \nand have a 26-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  commitment  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \nloan and project agreements. Based on the loan terms, the average loan maturity is 15.75 years, \nand the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. \n \n20.  The loan will finance 35.06% of the project cost, including civil works, equipment and \nmaterials, and institutional strengthening (Table 2). The government will finance the remaining \n$277.79 million through counterpart funds provided by the Chongqing Transportation Holding \nGroup Company (CQTG), a state-owned enterprise of the Chongqing Municipal Government \n(CMG). \n \n21.  The PRC is the borrower of the loan and will make the loan available through the CMG \nto the CQTG. The CQTG will assume the foreign exchange and interest variation risks of the \nADB loan. The PRC, the CMG, and the CQTG have assured ADB that counterpart funding will \nbe provided in a timely manner, including any additional counterpart funding required for any \nshortfall of funds or cost overruns.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The  CMG  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  project.  The  CQTG  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. A project management office (PMO) has been established under the \nChongqing Development and Reform Commission to provide overall guidance, supervision, \ncoordination,  and  management  of  project  preparation  and  implementation.  The  Chongqing \nMunicipal Finance Bureau will be responsible for (i) signing the onlending agreements for the \nproject;  (ii)  informing  ADB  about  the  authorized  staff  with  approved  signatures  for  the \ndisbursement  of  loan  proceeds;  (iii)  operating  the  imprest  account;  (iv)  processing  and \nsubmitting to ADB, through the Ministry of Finance, any request, when required, for matters \npertaining  to  loan  or  project  agreements;  (v)  and  monitoring  project  implementation  and \nproviding coordination and facilitation as needed. \n \n23.  The  CQTG  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  and  implementing  all  project \ncomponents.15 The CQTG does not have any previous ADB or World Bank project experience, \nand  the  staff  is  not  familiar  with  ADB  procurement  policies  and  procedures.  The  PMO \nestablished  within  the  implementing  agency  will  engage  a  tendering  company  to  assist  in \nprocurement. Further support will be provided by engaging a consulting team under output 5 for \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Established in 2004, CQTG is a municipal government-owned enterprise with numbers of subsidiary companies. \n ", "6 \nguiding and training the staff in the implementing agency.

A procurement schedule has been developed accordingly.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  Technical due diligence confirmed that the project is technically feasible, with technology \nchoices based on efficient and proven designs of international logistics parks. The logistics \nparks  will  implement  environmental  management  system  certified  under  the  International \nOrganization for Standardization 14001. The logistics exchange center within the Chongqing \ntransportation logistics park will conform to the Chongqing green building guidelines. A further \ndetailed technical review conducted on green building certification, storm water management, \nand rain water re-use confirmed the adequacy of designs. The design of the project\u2019s inland \nwaterway Ro-Ro transport output was also found to be appropriate as it reduces the freight \nhandling time and improves operational efficiency. The corresponding port facilities needed to \nsupport the Ro-Ro operations have also been evaluated and confirmed to have adequate \ncapacity. The capacity of the CMG is considered adequate to implement the project\u2019s advanced \ntechnical and sustainable transport aspects.  \n \n25.  Climate change risk. An initial climate risk and vulnerability analysis study determined \nthat there will be an increased risk of intensity and frequency of extreme storm events and \n ", "7 \nflooding as a result of climate change and a significant increase in temperature.16 The capacity \nof storm-water drainage will be increased, and the logistics park designs have integrated a \nrange of soft and hard-engineered measures to increase flood retention capacity. This includes \npermeable paving, artificial wetlands, and a roof storm-water collection and re-use system. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  The project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of \n17.7% and net present value of CNY967.4 million at a 12.0% discount rate. The estimate \ncovered the four transport-related outputs for which the quantitative economic benefits could be \nestimated  (excluding  the  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  component).  The \nestimated  costs  include  investment  in  civil  works  and  equipment,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and operation and maintenance. The estimated benefits include savings in vehicle \noperating costs, travel time, accident costs, and reduction in carbon dioxide emissions for freight \nshifting  from  the  road  to  inland  waterway  traffic.  The  sensitivity  analysis  of  potential  cost \noverruns and benefit reductions demonstrates that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust.17 \n \n27.  The financial evaluation was carried out for the three revenue-generating components\u2014 \nthe two logistics parks and the inland waterway Ro-Ro transport. The logistics information \nsystem component, aimed at serving overall transportation logistics, is not expected to recover \ncosts  in  the  foreseeable  future,  and  no  specific  revenues  have  been  estimated  for  the \ncomponent. The rest of the components will generate revenues from rental, logistics operations, \nand transportation services, with pricing subject to government monitoring and intervention (e.g. \nsubsidies)  to  some  extent.  The  weighted  average  costs  of  capital  of  the  three  revenue-\ngenerating components are computed to be 3.4% for the Chongqing transportation logistics \npark, 3.5% for the Nanpeng logistics park, and 3.1% for the inland waterway Ro-Ro transport. \nThe financial evaluation results in a financial internal rate of return of 8.4%, 10.2%, and 10.4% \nfor the above revenue-generating components. Since these values are higher than the weighted \naverage cost of capital for all three components, they are considered financially viable. The \nsensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the financial viability of these components. The \nCQTG\u2019s  financial  performance  was  analyzed  based  on  the  consolidated  audited  financial \nstatements during 2010\u20132014. The company has experienced strong growth at a compounded \nannual growth rate of 13% for revenues and 12% for total assets. While the passenger market is \nmaturing, the CQTG is well-positioned to grow in the cargo and logistics business, capitalizing \non Chongqing\u2019s strategic location as logistics center in the western region of the country. The \nfinancial  projection  indicates  its  long-term  financial  sustainability  with  reduced  reliance  on \ngovernment subsidies given its expansion into nonsubsidized businesses. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocuments and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment, the executing agency, the implementing agency, and the PMO. Specific policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  13).  An \nassessment of financial management capacity indicates that the executing agency and the \nimplementing agency carefully follow PRC policies and procedures for accounting and financial \n                                                \n16  Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nmanagement.  While  the  financial  management  capacity  is  considered  adequate,  the \nimplementing  agency  and  the  project  implementation  units  are  new  to  ADB  project \nimplementation.  The  overall  financial  management  risk  is  assessed  as  moderate  before \nmitigation measures. Training on procurement, disbursement, and financial management will be \nprovided in advance and during project implementation.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  A social and poverty analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines. Per \ncapita gross domestic product in Chongqing is slightly higher (CNY47,859) than that of the PRC \n(CNY46,531), while 2.7% of the total population in the project area is under the minimum living \nstandard security program. This project will directly benefit 2.92 million people living in the three \nproject  districts  and  indirectly  benefit  8.19  million  residents,  and  8,412  logistics  business \ncompanies with over 600,000 employees. The benefits of this  project include (i) improved \nlogistics facilities, operations, and management efficiency; (ii) assured commodity supplies used \nin the daily life of local residents; (iii) reduced costs of freight transport; (iv) improved transport \nsafety and reduced congestion in urban areas; (v) reduced pollution and vehicle emissions in \nurban areas; and (vi) increased employment opportunities. The project will create 426 skilled \nand 5,400 unskilled jobs for both men and women in the logistics industry with additional \nopportunities during project facility construction. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Environment.  The  project  is  category  B  for  environment.  A  consolidated  initial \nenvironmental examination and an environmental management plan (EMP) that cover all project \ncomponents  have  been  prepared.18 These  documents  comply  with  the  PRC\u2019s  regulatory \nrequirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and have been disclosed on the \nADB  website.19 Public  consultations  were  carried  out  to  inform  the  project  design  and \nenvironmental assessment process and will continue during project implementation. The EMP \noutlines  potential  impacts,  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures,  institutional  arrangements, \ntraining  requirements,  and  an  implementation  budget  of  0.2%  of  the  total  project  budget. \nCapacity development and institutional strengthening will be provided to minimize environmental \nrisks. Environmental complaints will be handled through a project safeguards grievance redress \nmechanism. \n \n31.  The  project  will  demonstrate  the  synergistic  benefits  of  an  integrated  eco-logistics \napproach to design and provide an international benchmark for industrial building development \nin  the  PRC. The  logistics  park  layout,  orientation,  buildings,  landscaping, mechanical,  and \nelectrical  systems  have  been  optimized  to  conserve  energy,  water,  and  materials;  and  to \nminimize  the  generation  of  pollutant  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  during  the  design, \nconstruction, and operation phases. These efficiencies are likely to result in significant cost \nsavings for the operator.  \n \n32.  The economic analysis demonstrates that the project will result in an approximate net \nreduction of 18,000 tons of carbon emissions per annum, as a result of improved efficiencies \nand the modal shift from road to inland waterways, although these savings may be offset by \ninduced freight traffic and embodied carbon during construction. Total carbon emissions from \n                                                \n18 Initial Environmental Examination including EMP (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. Chongqing Integrated Logistics Demonstration Project: Initial Environmental Examination. \nhttp://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-chongqing-integrated-logistics-demo-project-dec-2015-iee.  \n ", "9 \nthe  operation  of  the  project  are  approximately  34,000  tons  per  annum  when  the  project \ncomponents are fully operational. \n \n33.  Anticipated adverse environmental impacts and risks are modest and can be limited to \nan acceptable level through EMP implementation and compliance with loan covenants. The \nmain potential environmental impacts are noise, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, \nand disposal of solid waste. The closest residences are within 300 meters, and the Liangtan \nRiver is 2 km from the site. No other sensitive environmental receptors have been identified in \nthe project area of influence. \n \n34.  Involuntary Resettlement. The project is category A for involuntary resettlement. A \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  Chongqing  transportation  logistics  park \ncomponent.20 It will acquire a total of 675.13 mu of collective land that includes 433.15 of \ncultivable land, 40.26 mu of homestead land, 18.25 mu of garden land, 13.85 mu of forestry \nland, and 169.62 mu of waste land and construction land.21 The house demolition will affect a \ntotal of 89 households. A total of 488 people (99 households) will be significantly affected by \nboth land acquisition and house demolition. This includes the relocation of five enterprises, \naffecting  94  workers.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  impacts  have  been \nadequately assessed, and the appropriate mitigated measures are included in the resettlement \nplan. The LAR is expected to be completed prior to December 2017. The executing agency has \nadequate experience and staff resources in managing LAR impacts, and training was provided \non  ADB  requirements  during  the  project  preparation.  The  cost  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement is CNY205 million. The executing agency assured ADB that adequate counterpart \nfunding will be made available for LAR, in line with the annual funding requirements stipulated in \nthe resettlement plan. The LAR unit of the implementing agency will work closely with the district \nofficials for internal supervision and will engage an independent external monitor for semiannual \nmonitoring and reporting. Meaningful consultations will continue throughout the project cycle as \nscheduled. A grievance redress mechanism has been established to facilitate the resolution of \ncomplaints regarding land acquisition and resettlement activities. The resettlement plan has \nbeen disclosed to the affected persons and published on the ADB website (footnote 22). If there \nare any changes, the resettlement plan will be revised and disclosed to affected persons.  \n \n35.  In 2010, the Nanpeng logistics park component involved a total land acquisition of \n356.84 mu of rural collective land, and house demolition affected 46 households. A total of 324 \npeople  from  92  households  were  affected  by  resettlement,  including  157  people  from  46 \nhouseholds affected by the land acquisition, and 167 people from 46 households affected by \nboth the land acquisition and house demolition. The total cost was CNY47.18 million. The land \nacquisition and house demolition started on 5 May 2010, and payment of compensation was \ncompleted on 30 November 2011. Additional compensation payments for relocation to new \napartments were provided on 30 December 2014. A due diligence report was prepared to \nconfirm the procedures.22 It includes some actions to address the remaining resettlement issues. \nThis report has also been disclosed to the public.23 \n \n                                                \n20 Resettlement  Plan:  Chongqing  Transportation  Logistics  Park  (Output  1)  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n21 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 667 square meters; 15 mu = 1 hectare). \n22 Resettlement Due Diligence Report for Nanpeng Logistics Park (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n23 The due diligence report is accessible at http://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-chongqing-integrated-\nlogistics-demonstration-project-nlp-rpddr.  \n ", "10 \n36.  Indigenous  peoples.  Indigenous peoples safeguard requirements are not triggered \n(category C) because no ethnic minorities will be affected by any project activities.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  The  overall  risk  assessment  is  medium.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 The project design \nand implementation measures are considered adequate to address the identified risks. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelays in procurement due to lack of  Implementation assistance consulting service and training on ADB\u2019s \nexperience of the implementing agency  procurement and disbursement requirements will be provided.  \nLack of continued government support for  ADB will regularly monitor government support for the logistics \ndeveloping a public logistics information  information system during review missions \nsystem \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n38.  The government and the CMG have assured ADB that the implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n39.  The government and the CMG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n40.  The disbursement from the loan account is conditional upon the government's certifying \nthat the subsidiary loan agreement between the CMG and the CQTG has been duly executed \nand delivered. \n \nV.
