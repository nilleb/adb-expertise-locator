The  reform  and  the  investment  projects \nare  integrated  as  approval  of  investment  subprojects  will  be \ndependent on the implementation of specific reform actions.  \n \nEfficient \nlevels  of \neconomic  growth  needed  for  sustainable  poverty  reduction  in \nBangladesh. BR has been losing market share and consequently \nmaking  financial  losses  thus  relying  on  Government  budgetary \nsupport.  This  financial  support  has  not  been  enough  to  allow  for \nadditional  investment  needed  in  critical  corridors  such  as  the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong  and  Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna  corridors \nto \novercome  capacity  constraints \nto  poor  operational \nperformance of the railways. This in turn causes it to lose market \nshare  thus  worsening  its  financial  performance.  Greater  use  of \nrailways  will  ease  the  pressure  on  land  since  Bangladesh  has  a \nvery high population density and land is scare. It will also ease the \npressure on the road network, which is congested in key corridors \nand  thus  benefit  transport  as  a  whole.  This  will  require  capital \ninvestments and reforms to ensure that the investments lead to a \nsustainable \nfinancial \nperformance.  \n \n\nin  BR\u2019s  operational  and \n\nto  achieve  higher \n\nimprovement \n\nis  essential \n\ntransport \n\nleading \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nSector Program \nDescription \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nInvestment  Program  will  promote  sustainable  national \nThe \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Bangladesh.  It  will \nachieve  this  by  improving  rail  transport  efficiency  and  capacity, \nthus  lowering  operating  costs  for  users  and  increasing  the \ncompetitiveness  of  Bangladesh  for  investment.  Foreign  direct \ninvestment totaling $5 billion by 2012 is currently expected. These \ninvestments are expected to increase Bangladesh\u2019s GDP by 2.9% \nor $60 billion over 30 years. A prerequisite of these investments is \nthat  the  BR  is  reformed  and  capacity  constraints  alleviated  as \nproposed under the Investment Program.  \n \n\nfinancing  of  $430  million  over  5  years \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n \n\n \nProgram Investment Plan   The Government\u2019s Railway Sector Roadmap and Investment Plan \nrequires  a  total  investment  of  $924.5  million  of  which  the \nInvestment Program to be implemented in five loans is estimated \nat $537.5 million, including taxes and duties of $43 million.  \n \nThe  Government  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nextend \nthrough  a \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF).  This  financing  represents \n46.5%  of  the  total  financing  envisaged  under  the  Government\u2019s \nInvestment Program and covers investment, reform, and capacity \nbuilding interventions. The MFF has a maximum utilization period \nof  7  years.  Individual  periodic  financing  requests  (PFR)  will  be \nconverted into individual or separate loans. The Government has \nentered  into  a  framework  financing  agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB. \nThe  FFA  satisfies  the  requirements  set  forth  in  Pilot  Financing \nInstruments and Modalities. Pursuant to the FFA, the Government \nhas submitted to ADB a PFR for $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) and $30 million from Asian Development \nFund (ADF) resources. The PFR for these two loans is presented \nto the Board, together with the FFA. Prior to acceptance of a PFR, \nADB  will  ensure  that  the  Government  and  BR  comply  in  full  with \nthe terms and conditions of the FFA. ADB teams will conduct due \ndiligence  on  these  to  ensure  that  they  are  being  satisfactorily \nadhered to.

Final  terms  and  conditions  will  be  determined  in  the \ncontext  of  each  loan,  and  be  based  on  prevailing  policies  within \nADB. OCR financing will be subject to interest to be determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The Government has the option to choose \nbetween  eligible  currencies  and  the  interest  rate  regime  most \nsuitable  for  each  loan.  ADB  also  provides  flexibility  in  terms  of \nrepayment  and  interest  rate  swaps  during  the  financing  period. \nRepayment schedules can be structured for each loan, in essence \nto  match  the  needs  of  each  batch  of  subprojects  with  their  cost \nrecovery and sustainability profile. Financing from ADF resources \nequivalent  to  $30,000,000  will  have  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a \nterm  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such \nother terms and conditions as may be set forth in the appropriate \nloan agreement.  \n \n \nThe Government of Bangladesh will make all loans from this MFF \navailable  to  BR  under  the  respective  loan  agreements.  Once  BR \nis  transformed  into  a  government-owned  corporate  entity,  a \nproject agreement with BR will be required.  \n \n1  December  2011  (Closing  date  for  submission  of  periodic \nfinancing requests) \n \n31 December 2010 for the Reform Project \n31 December 2013 for the Investment Project \n \nBangladesh Railway \n \nthe  Program.

It will \nalso  allow  the  release  of  Government  funds  from  budgetary \nsupport  of  the  railways  to  other  poverty  reduction  uses.  These \nbenefits  will  be  widely  disseminated  across  the  country.  The \nprimary  quantifiable  economic  benefits  comprise  (i)  railway \noperating  cost  savings  arising  from  faster  travel  times  for  both \ngoods  and passenger services;  (ii) savings  in  operating  costs  for \nfreight and passenger traffic arising from traffic diverted from road \nto rail made possible with the increase in rail capacity; (iii) savings \nin working capital loss for freight traffic arising from time savings, \nincluding  elimination  of  waiting  times  to  get  slots  on  railways  for \ngoods being transported; (vi) time savings for passengers arising \nfrom  faster  train  travel  times;  (vii)  facilitation  of  investment  that \notherwise  would  not  take  place  because  an  efficient  railway \n(viii) \nsystem \nemployment opportunities to poor people during construction. \n \nThe  most  significant  risk  for  the  Investment  Program  is  that  the \nreform  measures  will  not  be  implemented  in  full  and  therefore \nimprovements  in  sector  performance  will  be  less  than  expected. \nThe  assumptions  are  that  other  factors  affecting  investment, \nexport  growth,  and  economic  development  are  in  place;  and  the \npolitical and security situation remains stable so that investors are \nnot deterred by political risk factors. Economic growth is assumed \nto remain strong to ensure strong demand for rail services.  \n \nAdvisory  technical  assistance  of  $2,000,000  will  be  provided  for \nInstitutional  Support  for  Railway  Reforms.  The  proposed  TA  will \ncover  fielding  of  international  and  national  consultants  to  provide \n(i)  advisory  support  to BR  for  reform  implementation,  (ii)  improve \nrailway  operation  and  maintenance  practices;  and  (iii)  carry  out \nprocurement and performance audit.

However,  to  achieve  poverty  reduction  targets  and  related \nmillennium development goals, a sustained annual GDP growth rate of from 7%\u20138% is needed.1 \nAs  transport  plays  a  crucial  role  in  facilitating  economic  development,  a  safe,  efficient,  and \neconomical  transport  system  will  support  economic  growth  and  thus  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction.  Between  1971  and  2005,  annual  transport  demand  by  all  mechanized  modes  in \nBangladesh increased by about 6% for passenger traffic and about 5% for freight. The share of \nrail transport steadily declined from 30% in 1974 to 13% in 2005 for passenger traffic and from \n28%  to  7%  for  freight.  The  shift  in  modal  split  toward  roads  resulted  from  steady  investments \nand  improvements  in  road  transport  coupled  with  a  decline  in  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  rail \nservices. Greater use of railways will ease pressure on land; Bangladesh\u2019s very high population \ndensity  means  that  land  is  scarce.  It  will  also  ease  pressure  on  the  road  network,  which  is \ncongested  in  key  corridors,  and  thus  benefit  transport  as  a  whole.  The  Government,  in  its \nNational  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction,  identifies  development  of  the  railway \nsector  as  important  for  poverty  reduction  because  railways  play  a  key  role  in  accelerating \neconomic  growth  by  reducing  transport  costs  and  improving  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  for \nforeign and domestic direct investment.  \n \nBangladesh  Railway  (BR),  a  department  under  the  Ministry  of  Communications, \n3. \ncomprises  a  rail  network  of  2,855  route-kilometers  (km)  and  34,168  regular  employees. \nSupplementary  Appendix  A  provides  BR\u2019s  organization  chart.  The  network  is  divided  into  two \nzones:  east  and  west,  separated  by  the  Jamuna  River.  The  rail  network  includes  660  km  of \nbroad gauge track within the West Zone, i.e., 1.676 meter width track. In addition the West Zone \nhas 553 km of meter gauge i.e., 1.0 meter width track. The East Zone has 1,277 km of meter \ngauge track,, and 365 km of dual gauge track (catering for both broad and meter gauge trains). \nJamuna Multipurpose Bridge, which has a dual gauge rail link, provides the only east\u2013west rail \nlink. Appendix 2 provides a sector analysis of the railway sector.  \n \n\n2. \n\nTraffic \n\nBR  operates  a  mix  of  passenger  and  freight  services.  Passenger  services  dominate, \n4. \naccounting  for  over  83%  of  all  traffic  units2 in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2005.  Passenger  traffic  rose \nsteadily until 1983 when it reached a peak of 106 million passengers, then declined to about 40 \nmillion  passengers  in  FY2005.  Passenger-km  traveled  also  declined,  although  to  a  lesser \n\n                                                 \n1   Asian Development Bank. 2005. Country Strategy and Program 2006\u20132010: Bangladesh. Manila. \n2  Traffic units are the sum of passenger-kilometers and ton-kilometers.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nextent, reflecting an increase in journey length from 60 km in FY1983 to 100 km in FY2005. In \nFY2005, the traffic in terms of passenger-km was 4.16 billion. Passenger operations are divided \ninto  three  types  of  services:  intercity  trains,  mail/express  trains,  and  local  passenger  trains. \nDuring  FY2005,  about  40%  of  passengers  traveled  on  intercity  trains,  37%  on  mail/express \ntrains,  and  the  remaining  23%  on  local  passenger  trains.  Taken  as  a  whole,  BR\u2019s  passenger \nservices are unprofitable, with intercity trains being a notable exception. Revenue from intercity \ntrains accounts for 73% of total passenger earnings. \n \nThe  importance  of  freight  operations  for  BR  is  highlighted  by  the  fact  that,  while \n5. \naccounting for less than 17% of total traffic units, their contribution to gross revenues in FY2005 \nwas  nearly  34%.  Freight  traffic  of  3.2  million  tons  in  FY1983  decreased  to  2.6  million  tons  in \nFY1996, but then increased during FY2005 to 3.2 million tons corresponding to 819 million ton-\nkm.  BR\u2019s  core  business  in  freight  revolves  around  five  commodities:  food  grains,  containers, \npetroleum  products,  fertilizer,  and  stones;  together  they  make  up  about  72%  of  total  freight \ntraffic.  Container  traffic  between  Dhaka  and  Chittagong  represents  an  important  growth \npotential. \n \n\n3. \n\nOperational Performance \n\n \n6. \nIn  view  of  the  high  investment  cost  of  railway  infrastructure,  the  intensity  of  track \nutilization is an important dimension of productivity. Locomotive, coach, and wagon productivity \nare indicators of efficiency of utilization of a railway\u2019s assets, while staff productivity measures \nthe  efficiency  of  staff  utilization.  BR\u2019s  track  utilization;  locomotive,  coach,  and  wagon \nproductivity, as well as staff productivity figures are lower than that of other developing countries \nin the South and Southeast Asian regions.  \n \n7. \nBR\u2019s  loss  of  traffic  partly  explains  the  low  productivity  and  operational  performance \nstatistics;  if  traffic  was  at  the  levels  of  the  1970s  and  1980s,  then  the  productivity  and \noperational  performance  statistics  would  look  better.  However,  the  statistics  also  reflect  the \nreality  that  BR\u2019s  staffing  was  allowed  to  grow  too  large  and  BR  has  not  been  using  its  assets \nefficiently.  Labor  costs,  which  consumed  59.6%  of  operating  expenses  in  FY1992,  were \ngradually  reduced  to  41.5%  in  FY2005.  This  is  the  result  of  the  voluntary  staff  separation \nprogram  implemented  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance. 3 One  of  BR\u2019s  most \nserious operational problems is lack of capacity on its busiest routes, in particular the Dhaka\u2013\nChittagong  and  the  Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna  corridors.  Many  sections  on  these  corridors  have \nalready reached their maximum desirable line capacity. This results in low average speeds, low \nrolling  stock  turnaround  times,  and  longer  waiting  times  for  cargo  to  find  slots  on  wagons. \nContainers  from  Chittagong  bound  for  Dhaka  need  to  wait  about  5\u20137  days  to  find  a  slot  on \ncontainer trains. \n \nAccidents, especially derailments, are another operational problem. In FY2005, the BR \n8. \nnetwork  including  main  lines,  branch  lines,  and  yards,  had  a  total  of  566  derailments,  i.e.,  an \nincrease  of  3%  compared  with  FY2004.  Although  these  derailments  did  not  result  in  any \nfatalities  or  injuries,  they  did  cause delays  in  train  operations  and  availability,  and  point  to  the \nneed for BR to improve operation and maintenance practices. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  1994.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Railway Recovery Program (Loan 1310-BAN[SF]. Manila. \n\n\f4. \n\nTariffs \n\n \n \n9. \nSince  BR  has  been  tasked  to  meet  social  as  well  as  economic  objectives,  social  and \npolitical factors have often outweighed commercial considerations in the process of tariff setting. \nAs  a  result,  passenger  services  have  been  underpriced  and  cross-subsidized  by  freight \nservices.  Compared  with  other  countries,  the  ratio  of  BR\u2019s  average  passenger  fare  per \npassenger-km to average freight tariff per ton-km is very low. The ratio for Bangladesh is 0.26 \ncompared  with  1.2  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  2.2  for  Japan,  and  0.7  for  Thailand. \nPassenger  services  account  for  83%  of  BR\u2019s  services,  but  contribute  only  58%  of  gross \nrevenues.  \n \n \n \n10. \nAlthough  no  major  privatization  initiative  has  materialized,  BR  has  introduced  some \nprivate sector participation into segments of its activities with a view to augmenting its financial \nperformance and ensuring some customer orientation. The private sector has been active in the \nfollowing areas through outsourcing: \n \n\nOutsourcing \n\n5. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\ncommercial activities of passenger trains, \nonboard services on intercity trains, \ncomputerized ticketing and reservation systems, \noperation of fiber optic telecommunications network, \nrehabilitation of passenger coaches, \ncleaning of engines and passenger coaches, \nconversion of non-air-conditioned coaches to air-conditioned, and \nrehabilitation and maintenance of selected tracks. \n\n \n11. \nTo  date,  the  private  sector  is  carrying  out  ticketing  on  76  mail/local  passenger  trains \nthrough  outsourcing.  This  arrangement  has  provided  BR  with  additional  annual  revenue  of \nTk132 million from these 76 trains compared with when it ran the services itself. BR also obtains \nTk860 million a year from the leasing of its fiber optic cable network to the private sector. \n \n\n6. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n12. \nLike  many  other  railways,  BR  is  a  loss-making  entity.  In  FY2005,  BR\u2019s  revenue  was \nTk4,456 million and operational costs Tk6,590 million, resulting in a loss of Tk2,134 million. The \nworking ratio, i.e., operating expenses divided by total revenues, is 1.36; and the operating ratio, \ni.e.,  operating  expenses  divided  by  operating  revenues,  is  1.46  excluding  provision  of \ndepreciation and public service obligation payments and welfare grants. Operating revenues are \nnot  sufficient  to  cover  operating  expenses.  The  financial  performance  steadily  declined  since \nFY2000 as a result of stagnant passenger tariffs and freight volume. To make up for the losses, \nthe  Government  has  been  subsidizing  BR  through  deficit  financing.  The  staff  separation \nprogram in 1997\u20131998 only temporarily arrested the decline in financial performance. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n \n \nBR has reached a critical juncture in its performance and is close to a cycle of decline \n13. \nexperienced by many other countries\u2019 railway services, i.e., lower revenue leading to a lack of \nmaintenance  and  investments,  causing  poor  services  and  contributing  further  to  reduced \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nrevenue.  While  railways  worldwide  face  increasing  competition  from  road,  air,  and  water \ntransport,  BR  faces  additional  challenges  in  overcoming  its  lack  of  commercial  focus:  low \nefficiency,  poor  service  quality,  political  interference,  aging  fleet,  and  congested  network  on \nmajor  corridors  such  as  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  and  Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna  corridors.  The \nweaknesses in the railway sector are manifested in declining market share, adverse operating \nindicators,  and  reduced  revenue  generation.  Their  underlying  causes  are  to  be  found  in  the \npolicy,  institutional,  and  organizational  arrangements  for  the  railways,  which  are  based  on  the \nidea  of  running  railways  as  a  social  and  economic  arm  of  the  Government  rather  than  as  a \nbusiness. Supplementary Appendix B provides a cause-effect tree analysis.  \n \n14. \nThe future performance of BR will depend on how effectively it can adapt its services to \nits  changing  market  position.  The  fundamental  challenges  for  BR  are  therefore  to  establish  a \ncommercial  orientation  with  a  view  to  (i)  arresting  the  decline  in  its  share  of  the  main  market \nsegments; (ii) improving the profitability of its operations; and (iii) generating sufficient income to \nfinance necessary investments in selective capacity expansion, asset replacement, operational \nimprovements,  and  safety.  This  will  require  that  BR  (i)  operate  railway  services  using  good \nbusiness  principles,  (ii)  concentrate  on  core  businesses,  and  (iii)  prioritize  new  investments \nbased  on  financial  and  economic  returns  that  will  improve  performance  and  capacity  in  major \npotential markets. These include the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong and Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridors, \nwhich cater to Bangladesh imports and exports and can support potential major investments.  \n\n \n2. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n3. \n\n \n15. \nADB has been the lead agency in the railway sector providing assistance to improve the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong 4  and  Khulna\u2013Parbatipur  lines 5  and  for  the  Jamuna  Bridge  Railway  Link \nProject.6 In addition, ADB approved a program  loan for the railway sector designed to support \nthe Government\u2019s macroeconomic stabilization program (footnote 3). Other agencies previously \nactive in the railway sector are the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC); and \nbilateral agencies from Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Saudi Arabia, and Spain. Appendix \n3  provides  a  summary  of  past  external  assistance  to  BR.  None  of  the  agencies  mentioned \ncurrently has an active assistance program. However, Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n(JBIC) allowed using $25 million from its Bangladesh debt repayment forgiveness program for \nsmall-scale  railway  infrastructure  improvements.  The  World  Bank  and  JBIC  are  considering \nproviding assistance to the railway sector.  \n \n \n \nThe program performance audit report for the Railway Recovery Program (footnote 3)7 \n16. \nfound  that  program  loan  as  a  lending  modality  was  inadequate  to  achieve  and  sustain  the \nprogram\u2019s  objective  of  BR  breaking  even  against  working  expenses.  BR  faces  many  inherent \nphysical constraints relating to inadequate infrastructure and aging rolling stock that cannot be \naddressed purely by the policy and institutional reforms pursued. Without alleviating the physical \nconstraints,the  program\u2019s  objectives  could  not  be  sustained  even  if  they  were  temporarily \nachieved  and  all  the  reforms  were  to  be  implemented.  The  audit  report  recommends  that  a \nsector development program8 rather than a program loan would be more effective in providing \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1974.

Program Performance Audit Report on the Railway Recovery Program in Bangladesh. Manila. \n8  The sector development program modality was only formulated in 1996 and thus was not available in 1994 for the \n\nLessons Learned \n\nprogram.  \n\n \n\n\fpolicy,  capacity  building,  and  investment  support  in  a  holistic  manner.  The  current  Investment \nProgram  design  follows  this  holistic  approach  using  an  MFF  modality.  Of  the  Investment \nProgram\u2019s two projects, the Reform Project addresses sector policy, organizational reform, and \ncapacity  constraints;  and  the  Investment  Project  will  assist  in  overcoming  infrastructure  and \nrolling  stock  constraints.  The  attached  TA  will  provide  institutional  support  for  the  Reform \nProject.  This  holistic  approach  will  enable  the  proposed  intervention  to  achieve  both  policy \nreforms  and  infrastructure  improvements  needed  for  sustainable  improvement  of  BR\u2019s \noperational and financial performance.  \n \n17. \nThe program performance audit report pointed out that the 1994 program demonstrates, \nin  an  adverse  fashion,  that  policy-based  lending  cannot  be  successful  without  sustained \ncommitment  to  reforms  by  the  Government  and  concerned  institutions.  The  report  found  that \nalthough  commitment  was  present  at  the  beginning,  it  wavered  or  was  not  passed  on  to \nsuccessive governments or BR management teams. The same lack of commitment was seen in \nthe 1997 Jamuna Bridge Railway Link Project. Although the infrastructure works in this project \nwere  implemented  satisfactorily,  the  key  reform  covenants,  e.g.,  becoming  more  commercially \noriented and corporatizing BR were not implemented. The current Investment Program design \ntherefore  links  investment  loan  approvals  to  implementation  reform  milestones  to  create  the \nproper  incentives  to  for  the  Government  and  BR  to  sustain  commitment  to  implement  reform. \nThe  reform  itself  has  been  carefully  designed  on  a  sequential  building  block  basis  so  that \nimplementation of the reform is more manageable to increase its chances of success, while at \nthe  same  time  creating  an  irreversible  reform  process.  A  detailed  analysis  of  the  lessons \nlearned  and  how  the  design  for  the  current  Investment  Program  incorporates  these  lessons \nlearned is shown in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n \n \n18. \nOn  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor,  demand  for  rail  container  and  petroleum  transport \nservices is significant. Containers make up the most profitable freight segment, accounting for \n22%  of  BR\u2019s  freight  revenue.  The  service  is  convenient,  cheaper  than  by  road,  and  popular. \nChittagong  Port  receives  about  600,000  TEU  (twenty-foot  equivalent  unit)  containers  annually \nand the volume growth is about 15% per annum. About 75% of these are for the Dhaka area, \ni.e.,  about  450,000  TEU.  BR  is  currently  able  to  capture  only  a  fraction  of  this  traffic  (about \n43,100 TEU or about 10%). The balance is taken to Dhaka by road, although laden containers \ncannot  be  taken  by  road  between  the  two  cities;  containers  are  first  unloaded  at  Chittagong \nPort. This is not only wasteful in terms of resources as each container is loaded onto 3\u20134 lorries, \nbut  also  defeats  the  economic  benefits  of  containerization.  BR\u2019s  low  market  share  of  this \nprofitable  market  segment  mainly  results  from  it  not  being  able  to  offer  more  container  trains \ndue to infrastructure, rolling stock capacity, and management constraints. Currently containers \nhave to wait 5\u20137 days to secure a place on BR trains. Opportunities for rail freight traffic in the \nDhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridor could materialize if planned foreign private sector investment \ntotaling $5 billion for a steel mill at Ishurdi and a coal mine at Pulbari is implemented.9 If these \nproposals materialize, rail freight traffic is projected to increase by 10 million tons by 2010 and \n15 million tons by 2015. It will also enhance regional cooperation and increase trade between \nBangladesh  and  India.  Private  sector  parties  involved  in  these  proposals  have  informed  the \nGovernment  that  reform  of  rail  organization  as  well  as  infrastructure  improvements  are \nprerequisites for the proposed projects to be implemented.  \n \n\nOpportunities \n\n 4. \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department is involved in talks to take an equity share in some of these projects.  \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nADB Strategy \n\nIntercity trains have emerged as the most popular and only profitable component of BR \n19. \npassenger  services;  they  carry  about  40%  of  passengers  while  contributing  about  73%  of \npassenger revenue. Nonrevenue (ticketless) travel is not possible on intercity trains, which only \nhave  reserved  seat  accommodation.  BR  runs  four  intercity  trains  between  Dhaka  and \nChittagong daily. They run full and demand growth is pronounced. Their speeds, journey time, \nand  fares  are  competitive  with  road  service.  The  trains  complete  the  321  km  journey  in  6\u20137 \nhours at a cost of Tk130, compared with 5 hours by road (the road distance is shorter\u2014270 km) \nat  Tk150  per  passenger.  However,  due  to  lack  of  line  capacity  and  low  throughput  on  the \ncorridor,  more  intercity  trains  cannot  be  introduced  to  satisfy  the  latent  demand.  Increased \nrailway  modal  share  for  freight  and  passengers  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  will  also \nbenefit  the  corridor  transport  network  by  relieving  congestion  in  the  road  network.  Thus  road \nusers  will  also  benefit  from  faster  travel  times,  lower  operating  costs,  and  reduced  negative \nexternalities such as incremental pollution from traveling in congested traffic.  \n \n \n \nImproving the efficiency of the railway sector to address transport bottlenecks is one of \n20. \nthe  main  elements  of  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Bangladesh  for  2006\u20132010 \n(footnote 1). Improved transport infrastructure and services are essential to improve the overall \ninvestment  climate,  and  thus,  achieve  the  higher  levels  of  economic  growth  needed  for \nsustainable  development  and  poverty  reduction.  More  efficient  railway  services  will  facilitate \neconomic  growth.  This  will  raise  incomes  and  create  employment,  thereby  helping  to  reduce \npoverty.  Improved  financial  performance  by  BR  will  reduce  the  need  to  finance  railway \ninvestments and operating expenditure from budgetary sources, thereby, freeing up resources \nto  be  used  for  other  priority  sectors.  The  country  strategy  and  program  also  points  out  that \nbecause  Bangladesh  has  a  very  high  population  density  and  tremendous  land  scarcity,  the \nrailway  system  needs  to  play  a  much  more  prominent  role  in  the  transport  system.  This  is \nespecially  true  in  areas  where  rail  can  operate  at  lower  costs  and  with  less  environmental \ndamage. ADB\u2019s sector strategy aims to bring about overall improvements in the railway sector \nby (i) supporting policy, organizational, and legal reforms to restructure BR to a market-oriented \nbusiness  organization  with  improved  financial  governance,  human  resource,  and  operational \nsystems; and eventually to be transformed into a new government-owned corporate entity; and \n(ii)  financing  economically  and  financially  viable  investments  in  strategic  rail  corridors  of  the \ncountry.  \n \n\n6. \n\nSector Road Map \n\n \n21. \nADB has engaged in intensive policy dialogue with the Government to improve railway \nsector performance. As a result of this policy dialogue the Government has agreed with ADB on \na sector road map. The road map outlines sector (i) objectives, (ii) policies, (iii) reforms, and (iv) \ninvestments. The objective is to increase the freight carried by rail along the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \nand Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridors by 115% each,, as well as increase the modal share of \nrail  containers  from  12%  to  26%.  The  policies  outlined  in  the  road  map  are  to  (i)  improve  the \ninstitutional  capability  of  BR,  (ii)  enhance  the  operational  capacity  of  BR,  (iii)  obtain  a  greater \nshare  of  the  freight  market,  (iv)  improve  financial  efficiency,  (vi)  ensure  efficient  provision  and \nmanagement of railway infrastructure, (vii) reduce involvement in nonrail activities, (vii) improve \nrailway safety, and (viii) encourage greater private sector participation in railways. The railway \nreform and institutional strengthening program formulated in the sector road map in line with the \npolicies are to (i) restructure BR by line of business (LOB), (ii) improve financial governance, (iii) \nimprove  human  resource  governance,  (iv)  transform  BR  into  a  government-owned  corporate \nentity,  and  (v)  improve  BR  operation  and  maintenance.  The  reform  and  institutional \n\n\fstrengthening  actions  will  be  complemented  by  the  investment  program  outlined  in  the  sector \nroad  map.  These  include  (i)  double-tracking  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor,  (ii)  improving \nsignaling along the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong and Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna corridors, (iii) rehabilitating \nyards  and  extending  loop  lines,  and  (iv)  procuring  rolling  stock.  Improving  the  operational  and \nfinancial  efficiency  of  BR  will  enable  a  reduction  in  budget  support  to  BR.  The  details  of  the \nsector road map are given in Appendix 4.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n22. \nThe  Railway  Sector  Investment  Program  is  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  Sector \nRoadmap and Investment Plan for 2007-2013 The Investment Program will promote sustainable \nnational economic growth and poverty reduction in Bangladesh. It will achieve this by improving \nrail transport efficiency and capacity, thus lowering operating costs for users and increasing the \ncompetitiveness  of  Bangladesh  for  investment.  Foreign  direct  investment  totaling  $5  billion  by \n2012 is currently expected. These investments are expected to increase Bangladesh\u2019s GDP by \n2.9%  or  $60  billion  over  30  years.  A  prerequisite  of  these  investments  is  that  BR  is  reformed \nand capacity constraints alleviated as proposed under this Investment Program.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n23. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  ensure  that  BR  becomes  a  commercially  focused  rail \nservice  provider,  and  that  rail  infrastructure  and  rolling  stock  constraints  are  alleviated.  It  will \nhave two mutually reinforcing components, i.e., the Reform Project and the Investment Project. \nThe  proposed  reforms  will  help  ensure  that  the  proposed  investment  to  increase  capacity  will \nlead to a sustainable improvement in BR\u2019s operational and financial performance. \n \nInvestment  Project.  This  will  finance  priority  investments,  i.e.,  those  that  strengthen \n24. \nBR\u2019s  core  business  activities  and  that  form  part  of  BR\u2019s  main  route  network.  Investment \nsubprojects  will  concentrate  on  enhancing  capacity  to  overcome  constraints  to  increasing  rail \nservices  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  and  Dhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna  corridors  where  demand  for \nintercity train passenger and freight (principally transportation of containers, iron and steel, coal, \nand  petroleum  products)  services  is  high.  The  investments  will  be  part  of  the  Government\u2019s \nrailway  sector  Investment  Plan  to  be  implemented  over  7  years  ending  in  FY2013.  The  total \nestimated cost of the Investment Plan is $887 million, of which $500 million will be financed by \nthe Investment Project. The Investment Project will finance improvement of signal systems and \nloop  lines,  rehabilitation  of  bridges,  and  procurement  of  rolling  stock.  This  will  be  carried  out \nusing four loans. Details of the Government\u2019s investment plan are in Supplementary Appendix \nD. \n \n25. \nReform Project. The Reform Project covers 2007\u20132010 and is part of the Government\u2019s \nSector  Roadmap.  The  reforms  and  actions  will  make  BR  more  market-oriented  through \nreorganization  by  LOB,  with  better  financial  governance  and  human  resource  governance \nsystems;  transform  it  into  a  government-owned  corporate  entity;  and  improve  rail  safety.  The \ntotal estimated cost for the Reform Project implementation is $37.5 million.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\na. \n\nb. \n\nInvestment Project \n\nFirst Loan from Ordinary Capital Resources \n\nSecond Loan from Ordinary Capital Resources \n\n \n \n \n \nOne  sample  subproject  was  prepared  for  Board  consideration.

As  these  items  are  all  nonrevenue  generating \nexpenditures  but  are  important  for  reform  implementation  and  safety  improvement,  the  use  of \nADF resources to finance these items is considered justified.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n2. \n\n1. \n\nImproving Sector and Corporate Governance \n\nLinkage of Loan Approvals to Reform Achievement \n\n \n \nThe Investment Program is designed as a strategic integration of sector policy reforms, \n31. \ninstitutional  development,  and  investment.  Investment  Program  loan  approvals  for  capacity \nimprovement  will  be  directly  linked  to  the  achievement  of  specific  reform  actions.  The \nGovernment has already undertaken the preparatory actions agreed with ADB as being needed \nto  ensure  that  reform  and  investment  implementation  can  start  as  soon  as  possible  using  the \nADF  loan  for  $30  million  and  the  first  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  loan  for  $100  million. \nApproval  of  the  second  OCR  loan  for  $150  million  will  be  dependent  on  the  successful \nachievement  of  seven  policy  and  institutional  reform  actions  including  completion  of  the \nreorganization of BR by LOB. Approval of the third OCR loan for $100 million, will be dependent \non  BR  successfully  implementing  11  policy  and  institutional  reform  actions.  These  include \nadoption  of  approved  financial  management  and  accounting  systems  to  improve  financial \ngovernance  and  a  human  resource  management  system  to  improve  human  resource \ngovernance. Approval of the fourth loan for $50 million will be dependent on the achievement of \n12  policy  and  institutional  reform  actions  including  transforming  BR  into  a  government-owned \ncorporate  entity  and  establishing  a  rail  safety  regulatory  body.  A  project  agreement  with  the \ngovernment-owned BR corporate entity will be needed at that time.  \n \n \n \n32. \nThe design of the Reform Project incorporates measures to improve governance at three \nlevels,  i.e.,  sector,  corporate,  and  project.  The  reform  elements  are  specifically  designed  to \nimprove  sector  and  corporate  governance  of  the  railway  sector.  The  introduction  of  modern \nfinancial management and accounting systems is to ensure that financial governance within BR \nis  improved.  The  new  system,  which  will  be  computer-based,  will  incorporate  computerized \naudit trails to ensure that internal and external auditing and tracking will be up to internationally \naccepted  standards.  Audit  trails  will  also  improve  transparency  in  tracking  cash  and  financial \napprovals and decision-making from the station up to the corporate headquarters. The financial \nstatements produced using the new system will be based on internationally accepted practices \nfor  the  railway  sector,  and  provide  transparency  and  rationality  to  sector  decision-making  on \nfinancial  issues  such  as  tariff-setting  and  calculation  of  public  service  obligation  payments. \nCorporate  governance  will  also  be  improved  with  the  introduction  of  human  resource \nmanagement  systems  under  the  reform  program.  Key  performance  indicators  will  be \nestablished for top management who will be held accountable for achieving the planned results. \nA more detailed analysis of how the Reform Project is designed to improve governance and its \nrelationship to other ADB initiatives being implemented to improve national governance as well \nas anticorruption measures at the project level is shown in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n \n \n33. \nThe reform program outlined in Reform Project will also be used by the World Bank and \nJBIC.  Hence  it  will  form  the  basis  for  not  just  ADB  intervention  in  the  railway  sector  but  also \nthose  of  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC  in  financing  priority  investments  from  the  Government\u2019s \nInvestment Plan.  \n\nUse of a Common Reform Program by Other Development Partners \n\n3. \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nD. \n\nProgram Investment Plan \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

The  financing  will  be  provided  under  an  MFF  in  accordance \nwith ADB policy.10 The MFF will extend five loans to finance a range of subprojects and reform \naction implementation under the Investment Program subject to submission of a related periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) by the Government and execution of the related loan agreements. The \nGovernment  has  entered  into  a  framework  financing  agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  The  FFA \nsatisfies  the  requirements  set  forth  in  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and  Modalities,  Appendix  4 \n(footnote  11).  The  Government  is  required  to  comply  with  the  FFA  requirements.  Pursuant  to \nthe  FFA,  the  Government  has  submitted  to  ADB  the  first  PFR  for  two  loans  of  (i)  $30  million \nequivalent  from  ADF  resources  and  (ii)  $100  million  from  OCR  resources.  This  PFR  is \npresented to the Board with the FFA. The minimum amount of a loan request will be $30 million. \nAll  of  the  provisions  of  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations  and  Special  Funds  resources \napplicable to ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loans and ADF loans respectively will apply to each loan as \nappropriate,  subject  to  modifications,  if  any,  that  may  be  included  under  any  loan  agreement. \nFor LIBOR-based loans, the Government has the option to choose between eligible currencies \nand the interest rate regime for each loan. The specific terms of each LIBOR-based loan will be \nbased  on  the  related  PFR  with  the  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2005.

The  loan  financed  from  ADF \nresources will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  during  the  amortization  period;  and \nsuch other terms and conditions as may be agreed upon. A project agreement will be entered \ninto with BR once it is transformed into a government-owned corporate entity. The MFF amount \nincludes  $92.77  million  for  contingencies.  The  Government  will  provide  $107.5  million.  The \nGovernment has committed to financing any shortfall that may occur.

Two implementation units have been \n36 \nestablished:  (i)  the  Reform  Implementation  Unit  (RIU)  headed  by  a  senior  BR  officer  at  the \nAdditional  Director  General  level,  who  is  the  Reform  Project  Director  and  staffed  by  suitably \nqualified  officers  from  the  BR  and  Ministry  of  Communications  (MOC),  and  (ii)  the  Project \nImplementation  Unit  (PIU)  headed  by  a  General  Manager  from  BR  who  is  Project  Director  for \nthe Investment Project. An interministerial committee co-chaired by the Secretary, MOC and the \nSecretary, Finance Division, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and  consisting of representatives from \nthe  Economic  Relations  Division,  MOF,  the  Ministry  of  Establishment,  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nOffice,  BR,  and  other  agencies  as  determined  by  the  Borrower,  has  been  established  to \noversee,  monitor  and  provide  the  necessary  policy  guidance  to  both  Project  Directors.  The \nDirector  General,  BR  will  report  to  the  interministerial  committee  on  a  regular  basis.  BR  has \nappointed  both  project  directors.  The \nin \nSupplementary Appendix G. BR has implemented four previous ADB loans and is observed to \nhave  the  capacity  to  efficiently  administer  loans  and  implement  projects,  most  recently  the \nJamuna Bridge Railway Link Project (footnote 6) and the railway component of the Emergency \nFlood  Damage  Rehabilitation  Project.11 The  project  completion  report  for  the  Jamuna  Bridge \n\nimplementation  arrangements  are  shown \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB.  2005.

This  takes  into  account  advance  action  for  recruiting \ndetailed  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants  for  the  sample  and  nonsample \nsubprojects.  The  last  date  for  PFR  submission  is  1  December  2011  and  the  last  date  for \ndisbursement is 31 December 2013. The proposed implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n38. \nThe  project  directors  will  be  responsible  for  all  procurement  activities.  All  contracts  will \nuse  international  competitive  bidding  and  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines. For the sample subproject, two contracts (tracks and signaling) of civil works, supply \nand  installation  of  equipment  will  be  procured  through  the  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedure. For the Reform Project, relevant computer hardware and software will be procured. \nIndicative contract packages for the Reform Project and sample subproject, including consulting \nservices, are shown in the respective procurement plans in Appendix 11. Contract packages for \nadditional  nonsample  subprojects will  be  decided  during project  implementation,  based  on  the \napproach used for the sample subproject.  \n \n39. \nInternational and national consulting services will assist BR to implement the reform and \ninvestment  projects.  The  consultants  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. One consultancy contract financed under the \nloan will be necessary to help implement the Reform Project, i.e., (i) implementation of the BR \nrestructuring  by  LOB,  (ii)  preparation  of  a  BR  asset  register,  (iii)  implementation  of  a  financial \nand  accounting  system,  (iv)  BR  human  resources  planning,  and  (iv)  corporatization  advisory \nservices.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  these  consulting  services  are  attached  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  H.  Another  consultancy  contract  will  be  required  for  (i)  subproject \npreparation  and  appraisal,  (ii)  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  of  the  sample \nsubproject, (iii) the rerating study of the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge to recommend measures \nto  increase  the  rail  loading  capacity  of  the  bridge,  and  (iv)  detailed  design  of  approved \nnonsample  subprojects.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  these  consulting  services  under  the \nsample  subproject  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I,  and  for  construction  supervision  for \nnonsample  subprojects  in  Supplementary  Appendix  J.  All  consultants  financed  under  the  loan \nwill  be  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB's  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  for \nrecruiting firms under the full technical proposal. The Government asked ADB to carry out the \nselection of consultants as BR does not have the experience to evaluate consultants needed for \nsuch  a  complex  program  with  a  strong  reform  component  interlinked  with  the  investment \ncomponent. Once selected by ADB, the Government will negotiate with the selected consultants \nto finalize the consulting contracts and will retain the responsibility to supervise the consultants.  \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nRehabilitation  Project  (Summary  Procedure).

Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  bidding \ndocuments.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Program  will \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nBR and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the \nProgram.  At  the  project  level,  several  measures  to  strengthen  governance  have  been \nincorporated,  i.e.,  strong  project  supervision  with  adequate  provision  of  consulting  input,  and \nperformance  and  financial  auditing  will  be  carried  out  during  project  implementation  by \ninternational  private  sector  auditors.  The  auditors  will  also  conduct  random  or  spot  audits  for \nprocurement and contract implementation activities under the contracts. The terms of reference \nfor the performance and financial audit are given in Supplementary Appendix K. A more detailed \nanalysis  of  the  anticorruption  measures  at  the  project  level  is  provided  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F.  \n \n\n5 \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n41. \nFor consulting services; procurement of equipment; and contracts of civil works, supply, \nand  installation,  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  using  direct  payment  and  reimbursement \nprocedures \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB. BR will open and maintain an \nimprest account for each loan with Bangladesh Bank. The amount in each imprest account will \nnot exceed 6 months payment or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. All expenditures \nin  local  currency  not  exceeding  $100,000  equivalent  per  payment  will  be  disbursed  using  the \nstatement of expenditure modality. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nBR will submit detailed quarterly progress reports. BR will maintain separate records and \n42. \naccounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  financing \nresources received, expenditures incurred for the Program, and local funds. The accounts will \nbe  set  up  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  Consolidated  project  accounts  and \nrelated financial statements will be audited annually by recognized auditors acceptable to ADB. \nThe  auditors  will  be  required  to  provide  an  opinion  on  BR\u2019s  compliance  with  the  Program\u2019s \nfinancial  covenants.  The  audited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to \nADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The Financial \nAdvisor  and  Chief  Accounts  Officer  in  BR  will  coordinate  all  accounts  and  ensure  compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s audit and accounting requirements, which will be followed up in regular reviews by \nADB.  The  program  completion  report  should  be  prepared  within  3  months  after  the  physical \ncompletion of the Program  \n \n\n7. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n43. \nThe Government will ensure that within 6 months of the effective date of the first OCR \nloan,  BR  (i)  develops  a  systematic  project  performance  monitoring  system,  indicators,  and \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\fanalysis for use throughout the life of the Program; and (ii) develops and conducts a quick and \neasy rapid sample survey to establish a baseline for subsequent performance monitoring. The \nmonitoring should be gender-disaggregated, where appropriate. Thereafter, evaluation surveys \nwill be conducted annually. The scope of the survey, quantity and quality of data, and frequency \nfor  collection  will  be  guided  primarily  by  the  project  management\u2019s  need  for  progressive  rapid \nfeedback on implementation status, as well as early warning of impending situations that might \njeopardize attainment of the development objectives. The Government and BR will agree upon \nthe  key  indicators  and  assumptions  that  determine  the  required  data  for  rapid  assessment. \nSome key socioeconomic indicators are given in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n\n8. \n\nProgram Review \n\nIn addition to regular reviews including a midterm review for each loan by ADB staff, a \n44. \ndetailed midterm review of the Investment Program will identify any problems or weaknesses in \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  agree  on  any  changes  needed  to  achieve  the  Program\u2019s \nobjectives.  This  midterm  review  will  be  conducted  during  the  third  year  of  implementation. \nTerms of reference for this review will be included in the facility administration memorandum to \nbe prepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission for the Investment Program. An information paper will \nbe presented annually to the Board on the progress of the Investment Program. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n45. \nAdvisory  TA  for  $2,000,000  to  will  be  provided  for  Institutional  Support  for  Railway \nReforms. The TA will have three components. The first will be used to engage two advisers: one \ninternational  for  12  person-months  and  one  national  for  17.  Because  the  reform  program  is \ncomprehensive and will  fundamentally transform  how BR will be organized and operate in the \nfuture,  BR  management  identified  the  need  for  expert  advice  to  help  BR  evaluate  the  reform \nconsultants\u2019  proposals  and  recommendations.  The  advisers  will  also  provide  continuity  in \noverseeing Reform Project implementation should there be any change in BR top management \nbased on the Government\u2019s administrative norms and requirements.  \n \n46. \nThe second TA component will be to improve the operational efficiency of BR to make \noptimum use of the reform and investment components. This will enable BR to be more capable \nto  run  high-speed  train  operations  once  the  investment  projects  are  ready  for  use.  This \ncomponent  will  help  BR  improve  its  maintenance  standards  and  practices  for  infrastructure, \nrolling  stock,  signaling,  and  telecommunications,  as  well  as  enhance  rail  safety.  BR  training \ncurriculum  and  manuals  will  be  modernized  as  part  of  this  component.  This  will  provide \nknowledge transfer, and more importantly institutionalize and internalize this knowledge transfer \nfor the future benefit of the railway sector in Bangladesh. The third component will be to conduct \nperformance  and  procurement  audits \nto  assess  sector  and  procurement  governance, \nperformance  and  performance  results.  The  TA  will  cover  fielding  of  international  and  national \nconsultants to provide support for these three components. This TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  All  consultants  financed  under  the  TA  will  be  selected \nand  engaged  using  ADB's  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  for  recruiting  firms \nunder the simplified technical proposal and biodata technical proposal as appropriate and ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for recruiting individual consultants. The outline terms of reference for this TA are in \nSupplementary Appendix K.  \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nThe Reform Project will enable BR to restructure itself into an LOB organizational structure \n47. \nwith  distinct  cost  and  profit  centers,  and  improved  financial  governance  and  human  resource \ngovernance. It will enable BR to have accurate asset registers, and modern financial accounting \nand management systems. This will enable BR to have greater commercial focus concentrating \non  distinct  markets  as  opposed  to  the  current  government  departmental  focus  prevalent  in  BR. \nTransparency  and  accurate  information  will  be  provided  for  policy  and  operational  decision-\nmaking  and  service  planning.  Breaking  away  from  a  bureaucratic  structure  into  a  corporate \nstructure will introduce greater accountability to BR managers. With a greater commercial focus, \nBR losses could be reduced if not reversed and thus the burden on the Government to finance \nthese  losses  lessened.  Improving  BR\u2019s  efficiency  will  also  help  to  attract  greater  foreign  direct \ninvestment into the country as an efficient transportation system is one of the factors that investors \nconsider. Rail reform is a prerequisite of potential investors in coal and steel projects (para. 20). \nHence  the  Reform  Project  will  directly  help  Bangladesh  to  secure  these  two  mega  investment \nprojects. Furthermore as the ADB Private Sector Operations Department is considering being an \ninvestor in the steel project, restructuring BR by LOB is also directly creating business synergies \nand opportunities between ADB\u2019s public sector and its private sector operations. The Investment \nProject will finance infrastructure and rolling stock to alleviate capacity constraints. This will enable \nBR to carry more freight and passenger traffic while reducing the costs of transport for users, thus \ncontributing  to  economic  growth  and  additional  earnings  for  BR.  This  will  in  turn  reduce  the \nGovernment\u2019s subsidies provided to BR thus enabling the Government to devote more resources \nto other priority sectors. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n48. \nThe economic internal rate of return was calculated by comparing the with- and without-\nsubproject  scenarios  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  rail  corridor.  The  existing  available  rail  corridor \nhas reached capacity and will be unable to carry additional goods and passenger traffic without \nthe subproject. With the subproject, the capacity of the rail corridor will be increased to be able \nto carry more goods and passenger traffic. \n \nThe  subproject\u2019s  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  for  construction,  rolling \n49. \nstock  acquisition  costs,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  social  costs  arising  from  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  compensation.  The  main  economic  benefits  generated  by  the \nsubproject were quantified in terms of (i) railway operating cost savings arising from faster travel \ntimes for both goods and passenger services; (ii) savings in operating costs for both freight and \npassenger traffic arising from traffic diverted from road to rail made possible with the increase in \nrail  capacity;  (iii)  savings  in  working  capital  loss  for  freight  traffic  arising  from  time  savings, \nincluding  elimination  of  waiting  times  to  get  slots  on  railways  for  the  goods  being  transported; \nand (vi) time savings for passengers arising from faster train travel times. Other benefits such as \nsavings in avoided road maintenance costs arising from the reduction in laden trucks using the \nroad  because  the  goods  are  being  transported  by  railways;  have  not  been  considered  in  the \neconomic  evaluation,  thus  making  this  analysis  conservative.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn is estimated to be 16%, indicating that the subproject is economically viable. Sensitivity \nand  risk  analysis  indicates  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  robust  under  most \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nconditions. The summary of the economic and financial analysis is given in Appendix 12 and the \nfull details in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return  \n\n2. \n \n50. \nThe financial evaluation was completed for the subprojects required to complete double-\ntracking of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong rail corridor. The financial evaluation was undertaken in real \nterms  using  constant  2005  prices.  The  subproject  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in \nnominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and \ndomestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuation.  Incremental  benefits  and  costs  were  derived  by \nevaluating  the  financial  position  of  BR  under  with-  and  without-subproject  scenarios.  The \nfinancial internal rate of return, computed on an after-tax basis, is 14%. This compares favorably \nwith the average weighted average cost of capital of 5%, also computed on an after-tax basis. \nThe  subprojects  are  considered  both  financial  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  and  risk \nanalyses indicate that the financial internal rate of return is robust under most conditions. The \ndetailed  financial  evaluation  is  provided  in  Appendix  12,  with  further  information  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. The financial projections for BR are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Social Dimensions \n\n51. \nThe  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  connects  the  two  largest  cities  in  Bangladesh:  Dhaka, \nthe  capital  (district  population  8.6  million);  Chittagong,  Bangladesh\u2019s  main  port  (district \npopulation 6.6 million); and the other areas in between. Comilla (district population 5.0 million) is \nthe largest of the cities within the corridor. The total population in the corridor (broadly defined) \nis 38 million. The corridor has a land area that comprises only 16% of the area of Bangladesh, \nbut contains 30% of the population and accounts for 40% of the country\u2019s GDP. Expansion of \nrail  capacity  in  the  corridor  would  lead  to  increased  freight  and  passenger  services  both  for \npeople in this region as well as to other regions of the country thereby creating opportunities for \neconomic and social development that would lead to poverty reduction. As this subproject will \nprovide an efficient transport linkage from the port of Chittagong not only to Dhaka but also to \nthe  rest  of  the  rail  network,  the  Project  will  facilitate  growth  of  local  markets  and  industries \nthereby creating more employment opportunities, with substantial opportunities being passed on \nto unskilled workers of the area.  \n\nthe \n\ntransportation \n\nimproved  rail \n\nThe  benefit  of \n\nfacilities  will  be  enjoyed  by \n52. \nconsigners/consignees  since  rail  freight  tariffs  are  lower  than  truck  charges  thereby  also \nreducing  the  cost  of  goods.  With  faster  and  more  reliable  services  of  passenger  and  intercity \ntrains, travelers will increase trip frequency for both business and other purposes, and this will \nincrease  labor  mobility.  The  subproject  will  also  reduce  poverty  by  providing  employment \nopportunities  for  local  residents,  especially  the  poor,  during  construction  and  operation.  It  will \nprovide increased business opportunities to the suppliers of goods and services to the railways \nand  thus  generate  more  employment  opportunities.  The  improvement  of  the  rail  network  will \nenable  the  people,  especially  the  poor  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  to  have  greater \naccessibility to other infrastructure services, for example schools, universities, and hospitals, as \nthe travel time will be decreased enabling them to reach such facilities more efficiently and on \ntime. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 13.  \n \n \n \n\n\f2. \n\nResettlement  \n\n \n \n53. \nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  for  the  sample  subproject  will  be \nsignificant. Most of the proposed improvement and construction work will be carried out within \navailable BR land. However, an estimated 16 hectares of land will have to be acquired for the \nconstruction  of  railway  embankments  and  bridge  approaches.  A  full  census  and  a  sample \nsocioeconomic  survey  conducted  in  June  2004  identified  about  680  residential,  commercial, \ncommunity  structures  within  18\u201322  meters  right-of-way  that  will  be  affected  by  the  subproject. \nAmong  the  affected  households,  228  will  lose  residential  structures  and  432  commercial \nstructures. In terms of ownership status of the households, 23 are encroachers, 23 occupiers, \n196  owners,  180  squatters,  and  258  tenants.14 Overall  the  subproject  will  affect  3,619  people \nand  an  estimated  835  people  in  150  households  are  likely  to  be  affected  by  acquisition  of \nagricultural land. Nearly 426 agricultural and 207 commercial licensees will also lose access to \nrailway-owned  agricultural  and  commercial  land.  No  indigenous  people  will  be  affected  by  the \nsubproject.  The  estimated  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  approximately  $3.34 \nmillion  equivalent.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  (Appendix  14)  has  been  translated  into \nBangla,  disclosed  to  those  affected,  and  will  be  posted  in  the  BR  and  ADB  websites.  The \nsample  subproject  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  on  completion  of  detailed  design  and  be \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval. In compliance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s policy \non  involuntary  resettlement,15 a  resettlement  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  N)  will  be \napplicable  for  the  nonsample  subprojects.  Resettlement  plans  for  these  subprojects  will  be \nprepared based on detailed design and approved by BR, and submitted to ADB for approval.  \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nresources  and \n\n54. \nTransport,  especially  vehicle  emission,  is  the  highest  contributor  to  Bangladesh\u2019s  air \npollution  problems.  Improving  the  railway  network  will  contribute  significantly  to  reducing  air \npollution  associated  with  vehicle  emission  especially  in  Chittagong,  Dhaka  and  Khulna.  The \nother expected potential environmental impacts are related to improving access, which will lead \nto increasing uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources. However, the gradual improvement \nin  enforcing  the  Environmental  Conservation  Act,  1995  is  expected  to  minimize  the  potential \nuncontrolled  exploitation  of  natural \nthe  environment.  Nonetheless, \nimplementation of the Investment Program has environmental consequences due to its physical \nintervention such as construction of railway networks.  \n \n55. \nIn this context, the Investment Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d project in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  2002.  The  initial  environmental  examination  of  the  sample \nsubproject  systematically  illustrates  the  potential  environmental  impacts,  proposed  mitigation \nmeasures,  and  how  to  implement  the  mitigation  measures.  The  assessment  of  impacts  at  the \nsubproject  level  will  become  an  integral  part  of  managing  the  Investment  Project.  The  initial \nenvironmental  examination  for  the  Tongi\u2013Bhairab  Bazar  (64  km)  section  (as  a  sample \nsubproject)  shows  that  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  construction  of  additional \ntracks  and  formation  of  additional  embankment,  including  bridge  construction,  are  temporary \nand  will  occur  only  during  construction.  These  impacts  require  mitigation  measures  that  are \nmanageable  and  mostly  can  be  incorporated  into  construction  works. 16  Therefore,  the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan, which clearly describes the required mitigation \nmeasures,  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bidding  document  to  ensure  that  the  contractors \n                                                 \n14  Encroachers  are  landowners  adjacent  to  BR  land  who  have  encroached  into  BR  land.  Squatters  are  those  who \n\noccupy BR land without authorization and do not own any land adjacent to BR land.  \n\n15  ADB. 1995. Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n16 For example, establishment of slope stabilization, and culverts.  \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\fimplement  the  mitigation  measures  properly.  The  plan  provides  overall  guidance  to  address \nenvironmental  impacts  related  to  the  sample  subproject.  For  the  follow-up  subprojects,  an \nenvironmental  assessment  review  framework  was  prepared  to  guide  the  impacts  assessment \nprocedure.  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental  assessment \nreview framework for additional subprojects are attached as Supplementary Appendix O.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks \n\nThe  most  significant  risk  for  the  Program  is  that  the  reform  measures  will  not  be \n56. \nimplemented  in  full  and  therefore  that  improvements  in  sector  performance  will  be  less  than \nexpected. This risk has been mitigated by linking reform and investment, whereby the key steps \nin the reform process are conditions for approvals of subsequent batches of subprojects, thus \ngiving  an  incentive  to  BR  to  implement  the  reforms.  The  sequencing  of  the  reforms  has  been \ncarefully designed so that they are implemented in incremental irreversible steps to discourage \nany  backsliding.  Instead  of  transforming  BR  into  a  government-owned  corporate  entity  in  one \nsingle step, the internal reorganization is implemented first, together with putting into place the \nappropriate  financial  and  human  resource  governance  systems.  Once  visible  success  in  the \nform  of  greater  financial  and  operational  performance  is  achieved  in  these  initial  steps,  the \nreform  process  will  gain  added  credibility,  which  will  discourage  backsliding,  and  thus  the \ntransformation of BR into a government-owned corporate entity can be achieved more easily.  \n \n57. \nLinking  investment  subproject  approvals  to  achievement  of  reform  actions  carries  the \nrisk  that  investment  subprojects  will  be  delayed  because  the  relevant  reform  actions  are \nimplemented  late.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  preparing  a  realistic  reform  road  map  that \ngives  a  buffer  period  between  when  a  particular  reform  action  will  be  fully  implemented  and  a \ndeadline  when  that  reform  action  is  due  to  enable  submission  of  a  PFR  for  an  investment \ncomponent loan.  \n \nOn  the  investment  side,  the  main  risk  for  the  Program  is  that  implementation  will  be \n58. \ndelayed, especially initially as the PIU gets accustomed to its working arrangements. This risk is \nconsidered slight  as  the  project  completion  report  for  the  Jamuna  Bridge  Railway  Link  Project \nshowed that BR has good project management and implementation capacity. This risk has been \nfurther  mitigated  with  the  Government  asking  ADB  to  carry  out  the  selection  for  both  the \nconsulting  contracts  to  prepare  the  civil  works  contracts  and  the  reform  implementation  to  be \nfinanced under the Program so that no bureaucratic delays occur in this initial period before the \nPIU is functioning at optimum efficiency. The Government has also agreed that FIDIC conditions \nwill  be  used  so  that  the  construction  supervision  consultant  as  \u201cEngineer\u201d  in  the  contract  will \nhave  sufficient  authority  to  direct  the  contractors.  On  the  whole,  the  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs, given the likelihood of risks occurring.  \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n59. \nThe Government, MOC, and BR are committed to the reforms set forth in the sector road \nmap. Assurances relating to implementation of the Reform Project are in the FFA. In addition to \nthe standard assurances, highlights of the Reform Project and anticorruption assurances agreed \nto by the Government and Bangladesh Railway include \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\nWithin  12  months  of \n\nthe \nthe  effectiveness  of \n(i) \nreorganization of BR by line of business (LOB); develop an agreed 5-year business plan \nfor  each  LOB  and  BR;  develop  key  performance  indicators  (KPI);  develop  an \narchitecture/model  for  a  new  accounting  and  financial  management  system;  identify \npersonnel  requirements  and  positions  for  experts  that  need  to  be  filled  by  recruitment \nfrom outside BR if such skills are not available within BR.  \n\nloan:  complete \n\nfirst \n\nthe \n\n(ii)  Within  24  months  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  first  loan:  complete  BR\u2019s  asset \nregistry; develop an outsourcing/divestiture plan for non-core services; produce financial \nmanagement  and  accounting  statements;  implement  a  mechanism  for  public  service \nobligation  (PSO)  subsidies;  implement  a  new  internal  pricing  structure;  redefine  job \ndescriptions,  and  career  advancement  processes;  of  the  different  staff  grades;  recruit \nexperts with needed skills from outside BR as and where necessary; formulate improved \nstandards  for  maintenance  of  permanent  way,  rolling  stock  and  signaling  systems; \nimprove  operating  practices  to  reduce  journey  times  in  Dhaka-Chittagong  corridor;  and \nupdate all relevant BR operations and maintenance manuals. \n\nthe \n\nfirst \n\nloan:  complete \n\n(iii)  Within  48  months  of \nthe \nthe  effectiveness  of \ndivestiture/outsourcing  of  all  non-core  services;  implement  a  new  tariff  structure; \nformulate a new market-based financial remuneration structure for all BR employees and \nperformance-based  incentive  structure  and  accountability  measures  for  key  BR \nmanagement  personnel;  prepare  options  based  on  principle  that  staff  will  be  no  worse \noff  for  BR  personnel  to  transfer  to  government  owned  corporate  entity;  approve  social \nsafety  net  for  BR  staff,  if  any,  who,  when  BR  is  transformed  into  a  government  owned \ncorporate  entity  become  redundant;  approve  the  form  and  legal  status  of  transforming \nBR  into  a  government-owned  corporate  entity  including  the  division  and  transfer  of \nassets and liabilities; approve technical and safety regulatory framework for rail sector; \nenact and promulgate legislation required for the transformation of BR into a government \nowned corporate entity; formally establish BR as a government owned corporate entity \nwith its own assets and liabilities and establish the safety and technical regulatory body \nfor the rail sector within 48 months of effectiveness of the first loan. \n\n \nLand  and  Resettlement.  BR  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are \n60. \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples. The sample subproject resettlement plan will be updated on completion of \ndetailed  design  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  award  of  civil \nworks  contract.  In  case  of  any  discrepancies  between  the  Government\u2019s  laws,  regulations, \nand/or procedures and ADB\u2019s requirements, ADB\u2019s Policy will apply.  \n \n61. \nEnvironment.  BR  will  ensure  that  the  Investment  Program,  each  subproject,  and  all \nproject facilities are developed, conducted, implemented, and maintained in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s Environmental Conservation Act 1995, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). In \ncase of any discrepancies between the Government\u2019s laws, regulations, and/or procedures, and \nADB\u2019s requirements, ADB\u2019s policy will apply. In addition, BR will ensure that the environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring  plan  will  be  strictly  implemented.  BR  and  ADB  will  review  the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan for each loan prior to processing the follow-up \nloans.  \n \nSocial  Development  and  Gender  Issues.  BR  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works \n62. \ncontractors  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws,  use  their  best  efforts  to  employ  women  and \nlocal people living in the vicinity of the subprojects and disseminate information at worksites on \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\fthe risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for those employed during construction. \nBR will require contractors not to differentiate between men and women\u2019s wages and benefits \nfor  work  of  equal  value.  Contracts  for  all  subprojects  will  include  specific  clauses  on  these \nundertakings, and compliance will be strictly monitored by BR during project implementation. \n \n63. \nPFR  and  Subproject  Approval  Process  and  Selection.  All  subprojects  will  comply \nwith  ADB  policies,  procedures,  and  relevant  guidelines,  and  satisfy  ADB  procedures  for \nsubproject preparation. Approval of the second and subsequent PFR is contingent on the reform \nactions  specified  for  each  PFR  being  fulfilled  and  the  specified  subproject  selection  criteria \nbeing fulfilled.  \n \nB. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n64. \nNo  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  for  any  civil  works  contract  for  a \ngeographic area until all required resettlement activities have been conducted and completed in \naccordance with the applicable resettlement plan and resettlement framework approved by the \nGovernment and ADB. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \n65. \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \nthe  provision  of  loans  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  in  an  aggregate \nprincipal  amount  not  exceeding  $430,000,000  equivalent  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nBangladesh for the Railway Sector Investment Program comprising \n \n(a) \nthe  loans  not  exceeding  $400,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; and  \n \n(b) \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  $30,000,000  in  Special  Drawing \nRights from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; \n \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set \nforth in the Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board; and \n \n(ii) \nto the Government of Bangladesh for Institutional Support for Railway Reforms. \n\nthe provision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 \n\n15 September 2006 \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n \nNational economic data \nand statistics \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \nPromote sustainable \nnational economic \ngrowth and poverty \nreduction in \nBangladesh.

With \n\n \nA. \n \nPrivately owned regional railways were built in what is now Bangladesh during colonial \n1. \ntimes  to  support  commerce  and  passenger  movements.1 These  were  gradually  taken  over  by \nthe Government, with the nationalization process being completed by 1942. After independence \nin 1947, control of railways falling within the boundaries of what is now Bangladesh was with the \ncentral government of Pakistan. A Railway Board was formed in 1962 and management of the \nrailways  was  placed  under \nthe \nindependence of Bangladesh, the railways were renamed Bangladesh Railway (BR).  \n \nBR, a department under the Ministry of Communications, has a network of 2,855 route-\n2. \nkilometers  (km)  and  34,168  regular  employees.  It  is  headed  by  a  Director  General  who  is \nassisted  by  five  Additional  Director  Generals,  one  Rector  of  the  Training  Academy,  one  Chief \nPlanning Officer, and seven Joint Director Generals. The network is divided into two zones: the \neast  and  west,  separated  by  the  Jamuna  River.  Each  zone  is  headed  by  a  General  Manager \nwho  is  responsible  to  the  director  general.  Each  zone  is  in  turn  divided  into  two  geographic \ndivisions,  which  form  the  basic  unit  of  operation.  The  BR  Director  General  reports  to  the \nSecretary of the Ministry of Communications and thereafter to the Minister of Communications. \nThe  nine-member  Bangladesh  Railway  Authority  headed  by  the  Minister  of  Communications \nprovides policy guidance. Supplementary Appendix A provides BR\u2019s organization chart. \n \n3. \nThe  rail  network  comprises  two  gauges,  including  660  km  of  broad  gauge,  i.e.,  1.676 \nmeter  width  track,  in  the  West  Zone.  In  addition,  the  West  Zone  has  553  km  of  meter  gauge, \ni.e., 1.0 meter width track, and the East Zone has 1,277 km of meter gauge track. At present, \nthe meter gauge networks of the two zones are linked by railway ferry crossing over the Jamuna \nRiver between Bhahadurabad and Fulchari (Balashi) Ghat at the upper section. In addition the \nnetwork has 365 km of dual gauge track (catering for both broad and meter gauge trains). The \nJamuna Multipurpose Bridge, which has a dual gauge railway link, provides the only east\u2013west \nrail link. However, its utility to BR is limited by the significant load restrictions placed on broad \ngauge trains crossing the bridge. BR has a total of 454 stations, 243 in the east and 211 in west \nzones. It has 277 locomotives, 1,407 passenger and other coaches, and 10,631 wagons. \n \nB. \n \n \n \n4. \nBR operates a mix of passenger and freight services. Railway freight is measured in ton-\nkm and passenger traffic in passenger-km. Overall, rail traffic is measured in converted ton-km. \nOver  the  last  three  decades,  BR\u2019s  share  of  the  transport  market  has  fallen  due  to  increasing \ncompetition from road transport. In fiscal year (FY) 1974, BR had 28% market share of freight \ntraffic and 30% share of the passenger market. By FY2005, this had fallen to 7% for freight and \n13% for passenger traffic.  \n \n5. \nPassenger  services  are  dominant,  accounting  for  over  83%  of  all  train  services. \nPassenger traffic rose steadily until FY1983 when it reached a peak of 106 million passengers; \nby  FY  2005,  it  had  declining  to  about  40  million  passengers.  Passenger-km  also  declined, \n\nSector Performance \n\nTraffic \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n1  The  first  railway  line  constructed  in  Bangladesh  was  the  53.11  km  line  between  Darsana  and  Jagati  in  Kushtia \n\ndistrict by the Eastern Bengal Railway.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nalthough to a lesser extent, reflecting an increase in journey length from 60 km in 1983 to 100 \nkm  in  FY2005.  Passenger  operations  are  divided  into  three  types  of  services\u2014intercity  trains, \nmail/express trains, and local passenger trains. Intercity train services were introduced in 1985. \nDuring FY2005, about 40% of all passengers traveled on intercity trains, 37% on mail/express \ntrains,  and  the  remaining  23%  on  local  passenger  trains.  Taken  as  a  whole,  BR\u2019s  passenger \nservices are unprofitable, with intercity trains being a notable exception. Revenue from intercity \ntrains accounts for 73% of total passenger earnings.  \n \nBR  faces  tough  competition  with  other  transport  modes  for  high  value  cargo.  The \n6. \nimportance  of  freight  operations  on  BR  is  highlighted  by  the  fact  that  while  accounting  for  \nslightly less than 17% of total traffic units, their contribution to gross revenues in FY2005 was \nnearly 34%. Freight traffic was 3.2 million tons in FY1983, fell to 2.6 million tons in FY1995, but \nhas picked up thereafter, and during FY2005 was 3.2 million tons. BR\u2019s core business in freight \nrevolves  around  five  commodities:  food  grains,  containers,  petroleum  products,  fertilizer,  and \nstones,  which  together  make  up  about  72%  of  total  freight  traffic.  Container  services  were \nintroduced in 1991 and container traffic between Dhaka and Chittagong represent an important \ngrowth potential.

BR  has  several  acute  physical,  infrastructure,  operational,  and \ninstitutional inefficiencies. The physical environment, with rivers subject to periodic flooding and \nrunning  from  north  to  south,  poses  considerable  challenges  to  land  transport,  particularly  for \neast\u2013west movement.  The haul lengths available in many of the origin-destination pairs in the \nabsence  of  sufficient  bridging  are  not  competitive  with  the  road  system.  The  Jamuna  River \nvirtually splits the country and the BR system. While the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge provides \nthe only east\u2013west link, its utility to BR is limited by significant load restrictions placed on broad \ngauge trains across the bridge. The situation has been exacerbated by the severe shortage of \ncapacity  on  some  critical  sections  of  the  network,  especially  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor, \narising  from  lack  of  investment.  Table  A2.3  shows  capacities  and  operating  results  of  some \ncritical sections of the BR network.  \n \n\nTable A2.3: Current Capacity of Critical Sections of the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \nCorridor (number of trains both ways) \n \nLocal \n\nTotal  Capacity \n\nFreight \n\nSection \n\nInter \ncity \n\nMail/ \nExpress \n\nGauge \nand \nDistance \n(km) \nMG-23 \n \nMG-64 \n\nMG-71 \n\nMG-61 \n\nDhaka Tongi \n\nTongi \nBhairabbazar \nAkhaura- \nLaksam \nLaksam \nChinkiastana \n\n18 \n\n18 \n\n14 \n\n14 \n\n18 \n\n18 \n\n10 \n\n10 \n\n4 \n\n12 \n\n4 \n\n4 \n\n6 \n\n10 \n\n10 \n\n10 \n\n46 \n\n58 \n\n38 \n\n38 \n\n88 \n\n50 \n\n36 \n\n36 \n\nUtilization \n(%) \n\nTraffic\nGrowth \n(%) \n\n52 \n\n116 \n\n105 \n\n105 \n\n3.4 \n\n3.4 \n\n6.6 \n\n6.6 \n\nkm = kilometers, MG = meter gauge.  \nSource: Bangladesh Railway estimates. \n \n9. \nThe capacity constraints are also seen in the low and decreasing average train speeds. \nThe average speed of a goods train on broad gauge in FY1970 was 17.2 kilometers per hour \n(kph). This decreased to 11.1 kph in FY2005. In the case of goods trains on meter gauge, the \nspeed  was  13.6  kph  in  FY1970  and  12.2  kph  in  FY2005.  Another  major  source  of  BR \noperational  constraints  is  poor  maintenance  practices.  The  BR  locomotive  fleet  is  historically \nunderutilized  as  a  consequence  of  BR  adopting  a  very  conservative  operational  policy  and \nsending  locomotives  to  the  shed  after  each  trip.  BR  maintains  its  track  manually.  The \nBangladesh  Railway  Way  and  Works  Manual,  compiled  in  1958,  provides  for  only  manual \nmaintenance  on  old  type  tracks.  This  method  of  maintenance  requires  changes  in  view  of \nmodern  track  structure  that  permits  higher  speeds  and  the  need  for  tight  track  maintenance \ntolerances  that  higher  speeds  demand.  BR  has  a  large  number  of  wagons  fitted  with  roller \nbearings, which are scattered in the system. When mixed with ordinary wagons their usefulness \nis  restricted.  Theft  of  railway  rolling  stock  parts,  e.g.,  brake  systems,  complicates  an  already \nunsustainable rolling stock utilization system.  \n \nA further operational problem is the number of accidents, especially derailments, on BR. \n10. \nFrom  January  to  April  2005,  the  system  had  a  total  of  310  derailments,  including  main  lines, \nbranch lines, and yards. This compares with a total of 220 derailments for the same period in \n2004, i.e., an increase of 3% in 2005 compared with 2004. Although these derailments did not \nresult in fatalities or injuries, they do cause delays in train operations and availability, and point \nto the need to improve BR\u2019s operation and maintenance practices. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n3. \n\nTariffs \n\n \n \n11. \nSince  BR  has  been  tasked  to  meet  social  as  well  as  economic  objectives,  social  and \npolitical factors have often outweighed commercial considerations in the process of tariff setting. \nAs  a  result,  passenger  services  have  been  underpriced  and  cross-subsidized  by  freight \nservices. As the national carrier, BR has the obligation to carry essential commodities like food \ngrains, fertilizer, jute, cement, coal, iron and steel, stone and boulders, petroleum products, salt, \nand sugar to remote areas at a cheaper rate. Compared with other countries, the ratio of BR\u2019s \naverage passenger fare per passenger-km to average freight tariff per ton-km is very low. The \nratio  for  Bangladesh  is  0.5  compared  with  1.2  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  22.0  for \nJapan,  and  0.7  for  Thailand.  Passenger  services  account  for  83%  of  BR\u2019s  services  but \ncontribute only 58% of gross revenues.  \n \nC.  Challenges \n \n12. \nInstitutionally,  BR\u2019s  main  problem  is  linked  to  its  civil  service  department  status,  which \nhas limited its managerial and operational autonomy considerably while exacerbating its lack of \ncommercial  and  marketing  orientation.  It  is  therefore  not  in  a  position  to  take  rapid  business \ndecisions  to  focus  on  market  segments  where  rail  has  a  comparative  advantage  over  other \nmodes. Decisions such as tariffs to be charged, staff deployment, abandonment of unprofitable \npassenger  lines,  and  all  major  investment  decisions  have  to  be  referred  to  the  Government \nunder  normal  service  rules  and  practices.  The  delays  inherent  in  such  a  process  have  often \nmeant loss of business opportunities. \n \nBR has reached a critical juncture in its performance and is close to a cycle of decline \n13. \nexperienced by many other countries\u2019 railway services, i.e., lower revenue leading to a lack of \nmaintenance  and  investment,  resulting  in  poor  services  and  contributing  to  reduced  revenue. \nWhile  railways  worldwide  face  increasing  competition  from  road,  air,  and  water  transport,  BR \nfaces  additional  challenges  in  overcoming  its  lack  of  commercial  focus,  low  efficiency,  poor \nservice  quality,  political  interference,  aging  fleet,  and  congested  network  on  major  corridors \nsuch as Dhaka\u2013Chittagong. The weaknesses in the railway sector are manifested in declining \nmarket share, adverse operating indicators, and reduced revenue generation. Their underlying \ncauses  are  to  be  found  in  the  policy,  institutional,  and  organizational  arrangements  for  the \nrailways, which are based on the idea of running railways as a social and economic arm of the \nGovernment rather than as a business. A cause-effect tree analysis is shown in Supplementary \nAppendix B. However railways have the potential to be an efficient form of transport for certain \ncritical  market  segments.  A  balanced  transport  system  whereby  railways  can  achieve  their \npotential in market segments where they are economically and financially competitive will help \nin  the  economic  growth  of  the  country  and  ensure  that  the  investment  already  made  in  the \nsystem can be utilized efficiently.  \n \n14. \nThe future performance of BR will depend on how effectively it can adapt its services to \nits  changing  market  position.  The  fundamental  challenges  for  BR  are  therefore  to  establish  a \ncommercial  orientation  with  a  view  to  (i)  arresting  the  decline  in  its  share  of  the  main  market \nsegments; (ii) improving the profitability of its operations; and (iii) generating sufficient income to \nfinance necessary investments in selective capacity expansion, asset replacement, operational \nimprovements,  and  safety.  This  will  involve  BR  (i)  operating  railway  services  along  business \nlines; (ii) concentrating on core businesses; and (iii) prioritizing investments based on financial \nand economic returns with a view to improving operational performance and capacity in major \npotential  markets,  e.g.,  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong.  Another  potentially  profitable  route  for  BR  is  the \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nDhaka\u2013Darsana\u2013Khulna  corridor,  which  could  attract  traffic  of  10  million  tons  by  2010  and  15 \nmillion  tons  if  planned  foreign  direct  investment  in  coal  mines  and  steel  plants  materializes.\n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR \n1974\u20132006 \n \n\nSource \n\nProject \n\nRailway Project \nSecond Railway Project \nFlood Damage Restoration (railway component) \nSecond Flood Damage Restoration  \n     (railway component) \nRailway Recovery Program \nJamuna Bridge Railway Link Project \nEmergency  Flood  Damage  Rehabilitation  (railway \ncomponent) \n \n \nVarious assistance \nRail I \nRail II \n \n \nSupply of three relief cranes \nTrack equipment \nJamuna Bridge Railway Link Project \n \n \nSupply of locomotives \nRepair of passenger coaches \n \n \nSupply of telecommunications equipment \n \n \nJamuna Bridge Railway Link Project \n \n \nConstruction of railway workshop at Saidpur \n \n \n \nJamuna Bridge Railway Link Project \n\nADB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCanada \n \n \n \n \nFrance \n \n \n \n \nGermany \n \n \n \nNorway \n \n \nOPEC \n \n \nSaudi \nArabia \n \n \nSpain \nADB = Asian Development Bank, OPEC = Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \nSource: Bangladesh Railway. \n \n\nAmount \n($ million \nequivalent) \n23  \n46  \n18 \n32 \n \n80 \n110 \n20 \n \n \n \n29 \n44 \n73 \n \n \n6.4 \n1.4 \n8.0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n28.4 \n \n \n15.0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11.4 \n\nYear of \nApproval \n\n1971\u20131977\n1984\n1987\n\n1974\n1984\n1988\n1989\n\n1994\n1997\n2005\n\n1991\n1995\n1997\n\n1995\n\n1985\n\n1997\n\n1991\n\n1997\n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nROADMAP AND INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \n\nSector Objectives \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Government,  in  its  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction  (NSARP), \nidentified development of the railway sector as important for poverty reduction because railways \nplay  a  key  role  in  accelerating  economic  growth  through  reduction  of  transport  costs  and \nimproving  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  for  foreign  and  domestic  direct  investment.  The \nGovernment\u2019s quantified objectives for the railway sector are as shown in Table A4.1 below. \n \n\nTable A4.1 Sector Road Map for Monitoring Development Results \n\n2010 \n\n2008 \n\n2015 \n\n    335 \n\n    123 \n\n    112 \n\n    540 \n\n    277 \n\n    252 \n\nCurrent \n\nIndicator \n\n \nItem \n \n \nIncrease  in  ton-km  of  total  freight  carried  by \nrailway along Dhaka-Chittagong corridor (million) \n \nIncrease  in  ton-km  of  total  freight  carried  by \nrailway  along  Dhaka-Darsana-Khulna  corridor \n(million) \n \nIncrease  in  railway  modal  share  for  container \ntraffic (%) \n \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe Government recognizes that the Bangladesh Railway (BR) needs both reform and \ninvestment  before  it  can  achieve  the  targets  set  for  the  railway  sector.  To  this  end  the \nGovernment  has  adopted  the  following  policies  for  the  railway  sector  that  will  be  the  guiding \nprinciples for both reform and investment requirements.  \n \n\nSector Policies \n\n      26 \n\n      13 \n\n      12 \n\n      16 \n\n    240 \n\n    149 \n\n1. \n\nImprovement of Institutional Capability of Bangladesh Railway \n\nThe priorities for modernizing the organization and structure of Bangladesh Railway are: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nconvert BR to an entity with a greater commercial focus; \ngradually  separate  BR\u2019s  infrastructure  from  its  operations  and  pave  the  way  for \nincreased private sector involvement through leasing or concessions; and \nintroduction of improved accounting systems. \n\n4. \nBR  will  be  transformed  into  a  government  owned  corporate  entity  with  a  greater \nautonomy enabling it to function independently on a commercial basis and allow private sector \nparticipation in the conduct of its business as well as to invest in the railway sector. There will \nbe  transparency  in  public  service  obligations  (PSO)  compensation.  Greater  autonomy  will  be \ngiven to BR including stronger links with the private sector for services, staffing, tariff setting and \nnew  developments.  All  assets  and  liabilities  of  BR  will  be  assumed  by  the  new  government \n\n \n\n \n3. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nowned  corporate  entity.  Making  the  railway  more  responsive  to  market  needs  through \norganizational reform, incorporating structural changes and sound business practices, has been \nidentified in the NSARP as an important factor in the country\u2019s poverty reduction efforts.  \n\n \nEnhance the Operational Capacity of BR \n\n2. \n\n \n5. \nBR will publish service plans to make the best use of the new Jamuna Bridge linking the \neast and west regions of the country. BR will acquire new rolling stock to make best use of the \nopportunities created  as a result of construction of the Jamuna Bridge. Operations on the rural \nbranch  and  low  revenue  passenger  services,  such  as  local  and  mail  trains,  will  be  reviewed.  \nWhere  these  are  little  used,  BR  will  prepare  techniques  for  attracting  more  passengers  and \nenhancing    revenues.  Closure  of  the  services  which  are  unable  to  meet  their  expenses, \nalternative modes of operation, subsidy payments, and closure of loss incurring services will be \nconsidered.  In cases of social need and economic benefit the government will consider subsidy \npayments, i.e., PSO, to BR to maintain operations. This is in line with the NSARP objective of \nestablishing a more poor-friendly railway communication system in the country without at the \nsame  time  burdening  the  BR.  Improvement  in  the  operational  performance  of  the  railway \nsector  has  been  identified  as  being  necessary  to  achieve  the  NSARP  objectives  so  that \nthere  is  a  balanced  development  of  all  transport  modes,  considering  that  further  road \ndevelopment is problematic in light of the  scarcity of land in the country.  \n \n\n3. \n\nObtain a Greater Share of the Freight Market \n\n \n6. \nThe  Government  will  review  BR  tariffs  regarding  freight  traffic,  so  that  tariffs  can  be \nnegotiated  to  maximize  market  share.  BR  will  also  be  asked  to  examine  the  possibility  of \noperating inter-city freight services to fixed timetables, and to establish a joint working team with \nBangladesh  Road  Transport  Corporation  and  private  sector  partners  with  a  view  to  offering \nintegrated (multi-modal) rail/road services for freight. Accordingly, BR will look at increasing the \nnumber of container terminals. New terminals in cities outside Dhaka, as well as at Tongi, will \nbe  studied.  International  links  will  be  encouraged  where  they  are  in  the  greater  interest  of \nBangladesh  to  attract  rail  freight  traffic.  The  NSARP  identifies  linking  BR  with  the  railways  of \nneighboring  countries  through  strategic  partnership  to  have  a  high  potential  for  encouraging \nBangladesh\u2019s  economic  growth,  and  poverty  reduction  while  at  the  same  time  enhancing  the \ncommercial viability of the railway sector. \n \n\n4. \n\nImprove Financial Efficiency \n\n \n7. \nThe  Government  will  not  generally  regulate  passenger  and  freight  fares.  But  in  cases \nwhere BR is not allowed to increase the fare, the Government will pay a subsidy to make up the \nloss to BR. Investments will be made in work programs which will help improve efficiency and \nincrease profit. In order to attract a subsidy, BR must detail costs and revenues from individual \nlines  and  services.    The  Government  will  seek  to  reach  agreements  with  BR  regarding  the \nappropriate quality and service level for each line.  The Government will then be in a position to \nmake judgments concerning subsidy, against its own social and economic objectives. Subsidies \nwill  be  reviewed  annually  against  these  objectives,  and  the  Government  will  introduce  targets \nand accountability mechanisms to improve services and reduce future subsidy payments.  The \nprivate sector will be invited to compete to operate subsidized services. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n5. \n\nEfficient Provision and Management of Railway Infrastructure \n\n \n8. \nBR will prepare a plan for upgrading on a route basis, stressing the financial benefits of \nproposals. An investigation into reliability of the older signaling systems, including replacing the \nold signaling system where necessary, will be included in the plan. In terms of operations, BR \nwill  introduce  better  systems  for  planning  and  using  rolling  stock.    The  priority  call  on  better \nquality  stock  should  be  in  the  profitable  inter-city  and  freight  sectors.  The  Government  will \nencourage investment in additional and extended international rail infrastructure where there are \nclear economic benefits to Bangladesh.  BR will introduce a program for fitting vacuum-braking \nto freight wagons, so that they can be used more efficiently, and a scrapping policy for unused \nlocomotives,  coaches  and  wagons  will  be  developed.  Development  of  the  railway  sector  has \nbeen  identified  in  the  NSARP  as  being  necessary  to  encourage  an  environmentally-friendly \ntransport mode.  \n \n9. \nThe  Government  will  play  its  part  in  promoting  the  role  of  the  railway  in  the  transport \nsystem  of  Bangladesh.  For  mass  public  transport  services  for  Dhaka,  the  possibility  of \nimplementing  new  rail  commuter  services    between  Tongi  and  Narayanganj,  via  Dhaka  (and \nother  such  mass  public  services)  will  be  assessed  by  a  detailed  study.  Further  mass  transit \nproposals for Dhaka can be considered once the financial position of BR is more robust.  \n \n\n6. \n\nReduce Involvement in Nonrail Activities \n\n \n10. \nThe  Government  will  explore  with  BR  the  most  efficient  uses  of  BR\u2019s  land  assets  (for \nexample,  in  joint  ventures  with  the  private  sector)  and  invest  the  income  to  provide  efficiency \nimprovements. The Government will seek to place hospitals and schools, currently owned and \noperated  by  BR,  under  the  appropriate  ministries.    BR  should  continue  to  maintain  limited \nmedical facilities which have a railway specialty. \n \n\n7. \n\nImprovement of Railway Safety \n\n \n11. \nThe  Government  Inspector  of  Bangladesh  Railway  (GIBR)  office  will  be  given  greater \npowers  in  respect  of  safety  on  the  railways.    In  particular,  it  will  be  asked  to  investigate  and \nrecommend  operational  plans  to  improve  safety,  and  to  halt  practices  which  cause  unsafe \noperations.    The  Government  will  fund  safety  improvements  in  the  railway.  This  will  help  BR \nachieve  safety  standards  and  records  on  par  with  international    safety  standards.    The \nGovernment will ensure that in the future all authorized crossings on national and regional roads \nare  staffed,  and  that  all  staffed  crossings  have  a  means  of  communication  to  the  nearest \nstations on each side. Automatic warning signals will also be installed on main roads when the \ntrain frequency rises above threshold levels. The Government will initiate a program of flyover \nconstruction at the busiest level crossings, with priority on economic merit.  New national roads \nwill in future be grade-separated from railways. The Government will campaign to educate the \npublic  on  the  dangers  of  crossing  railways,  and  to  obey  crossing  gates.  The  Government  will \nconsider  a  program  for  more  efficient  crossing  operations  in  the  light  of  more  intensive  train \noperations in greater Dhaka.  This will include consideration of flyovers. New roads which cross \nrailway  tracks  will  be  required  to  contain  funding  proposals  for  adequate  and  safe  crossing \nfacilities in line with the above.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\n8. \n\nEncourage Greater Private Sector Participation in the Provision of Services \n\n \n12. \nEnhancement of services for passengers and freight and for promoting growth in the use \nof  the  network,  serving  the  community,  benefiting  the  environment  and  getting  good  value  for \ntaxpayer\u2019s  money,  with  private  sector  participation  will  be  encouraged.  The  Government  will \nwelcome  participation  of  the  private  sector  in  achieving  these  aims.  The  private  sector  will  be \nencouraged to take a part in (i) ticketing, ticket allocation and seat reservations (ii) operation of \nall types of passenger services (iii) supply of rolling stock (iv) freight operations (v) rolling stock \nmaintenance  and  (vi)  track  maintenance.  Outsourcing  such  activities  to  the  private  sector  has \nbeen  identified  in  the  NSARP  as  being  important  to  reduce  public  sector  expenditure  on  the \nrailways.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe Reform Project of the Investment Program aims to improve the performance of the \nrailway  sector  by  implementing  a  program  of  organizational  and  policy  reforms  The  Reform \nProject is in line with the sector policies outlined above and will cover the period 2007-2011. The \ndetails  of  the  Reform  Project  are  outlined  in  the  paragraphs  below  and  summarized  in  Table \nA4.2 below.  \n \n14.  Within 12 (twelve) months of the effective date of the first loan to be provided under the \nFacility,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  following  actions  are  completed  in  a  manner \nacceptable to ADB in order to restructure BR: \n \n\nReform Project of Investment Program \n\nReorganize BR by line of business (LOB) completed and all BR staff assigned to \npositions in the approved structure; \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nDevelop  an  agreed  5-year  business  plan  for  each  LOB  and  BR  as  a  whole \nshowing what the LOB operational and financial targets are, the service quality it \nwill offer and the expenditure necessary for each LOB and BR as a whole; \n\nDevelop key performance indicators (KPI) for each LOB to achieve business plan \ntargets; \n\nDevelop  an  architecture/model  for  a  new  accounting  and  financial  management \nsystem that will produce BR\u2019s financial statements in conformity with commercial \naccounting  standards  internationally  accepted  in  the  railway  industry  and  also \nenable  restatement  of  these  financial  statements  to  ones  that  conform  to \nGovernment reporting requirements;  \n\nSet  up  personnel  database  with  completed  data  for  all  BR  personnel  and \nprocedures for maintaining database in place; \n\nIdentify  personnel  requirements  showing  skills  needed  at  each  LOB,  skills \nexisting  at  BR,  skills  shortages  and  surplus  to  requirements,  training  and \nretraining  needs,  and  positions  for  experts  that  need  to  be  filled  by  recruitment \nfrom  outside  BR  for  successful  implementation  of  LOB  business  plans  if  such \nskills are not available within BR; and \n\n(vii) \n\nPrepare  plan  for  monitoring  system  to  collect  and  analyze  data  needed  to \nmonitor operational aspects of key performance indicators for each LOB.   \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n15.  Within 24 (twenty-four) months of the effective date of the first loan to be provided under \nthe  Facility,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  following  actions  in  a  manner  acceptable  to \nADB are completed in order to restructure BR: \n \n\nBR  asset  registry  completed  with  all  BR  assets  to  be  identified,  revalued  and \nrecorded in a new asset register which shows which LOB owns which asset; \n\n(i) \n\n  \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\nIdentify  non-core  services,  develop  and  approve  an  outsourcing/divestiture  plan \nfor non-core services; \n\nReview performance of LOBs and report on LOB performance submitted to ADB; \n\nNew accounting and financial management system to be fully implemented with \nthe production of financial management and accounting statements as agreed in \nthe accepted architecture/model; \n\nIdentify  passenger  services  that  need  public  service  obligation  (PSO)  subsidies \nand implement a mechanism to calculate and pay PSO subsidies; \n\nImplement  a  new  internal  pricing  structure  for  the  services  provided  by  an \nindividual LOB to another LOB;  \n\n \n(vii)  Redefine job description, key advancement process of the different staff grades \nand professions needed to optimize LOB structure and transformation of BR into \na government owned corporate entity; \n\n \n(viii)  Recruit experts with needed skills from outside BR as and where necessary with \n\nthe successful candidates appointed and in service with BR; \n\nFormulate  and  accept  improved  standards  for  maintenance  of  permanent  way,  \nrolling stock and signaling system; \n\nImprove timetabling, rake links, locomotive links, and terminal operating practices \nto  reduce  journey  times  in  Dhaka-Chittagong  corridor  by  10%  compared  to  the \nsituation existing in December 2005; and \n\n(xi) \n\nUpdate  all  relevant  operations  and  maintenance  manuals  by  BR  and  formally \nadopt these new manuals.  \n\n \n16.  Within 48 (forty-eight) months of the effective date of the first loan to be provided under \nthe  Facility,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  following  actions  are  completed  in  a  manner \nacceptable to ADB in order to transform BR into a government owned corporate entity: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nComplete the divestiture/outsourcing of all non-core services in accordance with  \nthe approved outsourcing/divestiture plan;  \n \nImplement a new tariff structure for all BR core services and revise tariff book  \naccording to the approved tariff structure;  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35 \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n  \n(xii) \n\n \n(xii) \n\nfor  BR \nFormulate  a  new  market-based \nemployees  to  be  implemented  after  transformation  of  BR  into  a  government \nowned corporate entity; \n\nfinancial  remuneration  structure \n\nFormulate  performance-based  incentive  structure  and  accountability  measures \nfor key BR management personnel to be implemented after the transformation of \nBR into a government owned corporate entity is approved; \n\nPrepare  options  based  on  principle  that  staff  will  be  no  worse  off  for  BR \npersonnel  to  transfer  to  government  owned  corporate  entity  and  prepare  the \nnecessary documentation for the various accepted options; \n\nPrepare  and  approve  social  safety  net  for  BR  staff,  if  any,  who,  when  BR  is \ntransformed into a government owned corporate entity become redundant; \n\n \n(vii)  Decide  on  and  approve  option  for  the  form  and  legal  status  of  BR  after  it  is \ntransformed  into  a  government  owned  corporate  entity  taking  into  account  the \nexperience gained in restructuring BR by LOB; \n\n \n(viii)  Finalize and approve the division and transfer of assets and liabilities after BR is \n\ntransformed into a government owned corporate entity; \n\nFinalize  and  approve  technical  and  safety  regulatory  framework  for  rail  sector \nafter BR is transformed into a government owned corporate entity including roles, \nreporting  arrangements  and  institutional  strengthening  for  safety  and  technical \nregulatory body;  \n\nEnact  and  promulgate  legislation  required  for  the  transformation  of  BR  into  a \ngovernment owned corporate entity with its own assets and liabilities and which \nalso provides for a regulatory framework for safety and technical regulations; \n\nBR is formally established as a transformed government owned corporate entity \nwith  its  own  assets  and  liabilities  in  line  with  provisions  of  the  legislation  as \napproved by Parliament; and \n\nSafety  and  technical  regulatory  body  for  rail  sector  formally  established  in  line \nprovisions of the legislation as approved by Parliament.   \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable A4.2: Reform and Institutional Strengthening Actions \n\nBR = Bangladesh Railway, KPI = key performance indicators, LOB = line of business, PSO = public service obligation. \nSource: Bangladesh Railway. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n37 \n\nInvestment Plan \n\nD. \n \n17. \nThe BR has prepared an Investment Plan that is in line with the sector policies to help it \nachieve the targets specified in the Government\u2019s sector road map targets for the railway sector. \nThe total investment required is $887 million.1  \n \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Project of the Investment Program \n\n \nThe cost estimate for the Investment Project of the Investment Program is $500 million \n18. \nof which $400 million will be financed from the Facility while the Government will finance $100 \nmillion.

Keeping  in  view  the \nneed to cater for possible future change over to meter gauge heavy  haul or broad gauge, the \nconstructions standard recommended is for broad gauge main line. Provision for improvement \nto signaling systems and loop lines is included. \n \nThe Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar section has high embankments of over 3.66 meters in places, \n2. \nand 11 large bridges (including Bridge No 79- Sitalakhya 1x76.2 meters +4x30.5 meters+8x18.3 \nmeters)  on  deep  foundations.  The  rivers  are  navigable  and  considerable  planning  skills  are \nneeded  to  build  the  foundation  and  erect  the  superstructure,  including  consideration  of \ntemporary  islanding.  The  major  bridges  will  be  located  at  least  30.5  meters  away  from  the \nexisting bridges. \n \n3. \nThe  sample  subproject  will  help  strengthen  the  core  business  activities  of  Bangladesh \nRailway  (BR)  by  enhancing  capacity  to  overcome  constraints  to  increasing  rail  services  in  the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  where  demand  for  intercity  passenger  and  freight  (principally \ncontainer and petroleum products) services is high. \n \nThe maximum train speed in the design is same as the existing maximum train speed of \n4. \n72 km/hour on meter gauge and 80 km/hour on broad gauge. BR\u2019s existing meter gauge rolling \nstock is operable at a maximum speed of 72 km/hr. The current BR standards for construction \nand operation are recommended with the proviso that within 5 years of opening of the double-\ntracked  line,  BR  should  decide  upon  rational  construction,  maintenance,  and  operational \nguidelines  for  high-speed  operation.  Field  trials  as  necessary  should  be  conducted  in  a \nmethodical manner. The design standards for the sample subproject are outlined here: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nEmbankment.  The  new  meter  gauge  embankment  will  be  built  to  take  future \nbroad  gauge  loading.  The  embankment  construction  will  rely  on  a  20%  mix  of \nborrow  pit  soil  and  80%  from  outside  BR  land.  Embankments  up  to  a  height  of \n1.83  meters  will  have  a  0.61  meter  sand  cushion  and  those  above,  2  layers  of \n0.61 meters  sand cushion. \nTrack. 40 A (kilograms/meter) new rails will be used for all running lines; similar \nsecond-hand  rails  will  be  used  for  the  sidings  and  yards.  Rail  welding  will  be \napplied  for  converting  the  14  meter  shipping  length  of  rails  to  3-rail  or  5-rail \npanels within stations yards and on major bridges; and the balance joints will be \ncontinuously welded. Ballast cushion will be 22 centimeters (cm) crushed stone \nover 42 cm subballast for meter gauge and 30 cm crushed stone over 42 cm sub \nballast  for  broad  gauge.  Sleepers  will  be  prestressed  concrete  with  clip  type \nelastic  fastenings  similar  to  Pandorol  clips.  Wooden  (durable  or  treated \nnondurable) sleepers provided with bearing plates and elastic fastenings will be \nused on girder bridges. \nBridges. Minor bridges will be prestressed concrete for spans up to 6.1 meters \nreinforced  concrete  slabs  for  smaller  spans  and  reinforced  concrete  pipes  for \nculverts.  For  all  other  spans  (major  bridges),  steel  girders  will  be  used  with \nstringers  placed  for  meter  gauge  rail.  broad  gauge  maximum  loading  standards \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n(iv) \n\nwill be used for girder design and fabrication, substructure, and foundation. BR's \nstandard designs of steel girders will be followed. \nSignaling  and  Telecommunications.  The  existing  relay-based  signaling \nsystems  in  the  section,  which  are  operated  by  the  stationmasters  from  stand-\nalone  an  operating  control  panel  at  each  station,  will  be  replaced  by  a  modern \ncomputer-based system with provision for remote control of station signaling as \nwell  as  level  crossing  protection  system.

The  criteria  for  selection  of  subprojects  and  the  approval \nprocess follows. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nPeriodic  Financing  Request  (PRF).  Subprojects  will  be  submitted  in  four  PFRs.  The \nfirst  will  contain  subprojects,  procurement,  and  consulting  services  with  maximum  ADB \nfinancing  of  $100  million,  the  second  batch  with  maximum  ADB  financing  of  $150  million  in \naddition to any unutilized/unrequested amount remaining from the 1st PFR, the third PFR with \nmaximum ADB financing of $100 million in addition to any unutilized/unrequested amount from \nthe 1st and 2nd PFR, and the last PFR with maximum ADB financing of $50 million in addition \nto  any  unutilized/unrequested  amount  from  the  1st,  2nd,  and  3rd  PFR.  Each  PFR  will  be \nsubmitted for ADB approval only after the corresponding reform actions that form a prerequisite \nfor the approval of a particular batch as stated in Appendix 7 have been met.  \n \nRailway  Investment  Plan.  The  subproject  will  be  part  of  the  railway  investment  plan \n3. \nthat supports the core business of BR as identified in the medium-term reform program and in \nthe case of infrastructure projects forms part of BR\u2019s main infrastructure network.  \n \n4. \nprepared. \n \n5. \nEconomic  and  Financial  Feasibility.  Economic  analysis  of  subprojects  will  be \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  and  the \nestimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  will  be  at  least  12%.  Financial  analysis  will  be \nconducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management \nof Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank to obtain the financial internal \nrate of return; it should exceed the weighted average cost of capital.  \n \n6. \nSocial  Assessment  and  Analysis.  The  subproject  will  be  socially  sound  and  will \nminimize the need for land acquisition and include measures to mitigate any social impacts. An \ninitial social assessment for the subproject will have been  prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nrelevant guidelines.  \n \nResettlement.  The  subproject  will  minimize  any  involuntary  resettlement 1  or  land \n7. \nacquisition,  or  will  have  minimal  impact  on  any  people  affected  by  land  acquisition  or  their \nlivelihood.  The  subproject  design  will  explore  all  options  to  avoid  and/or  minimize  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement. \ninvoluntary \nresettlement, a full resettlement plan2 (or short resettlement plan)3 acceptable to ADB will have \n                                                 \n1  Involuntary  resettlement  addresses  social  and  economic  impacts  that  are  permanent  or  temporary  and  are  (i) \ncaused by acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) by change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed \non land as a result of an ADB operation. An affected person is one who experiences such impacts. \n\nTechnical  Feasibility.  The subproject will be technically feasible and a detailed report \n\nland  acquisition  or \n\nIf  a  subproject \n\n2  Resettlement  is  significant  when  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impacts.  Major  impacts  are  defined  as \ninvolving  people  being  physically  displaced  from  housing  and/or  having  10%  or  more  of  their  productive,  income \ngenerating assets lost.  \n\ninvolves \n\n3   Involuntary resettlement impacts that are not deemed significant require a short resettlement plan.  \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nbeen prepared in accordance with the resettlement framework agreed between the Government \nand ADB and in accordance ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.4 \n \n8. \nIndigenous Peoples. If any indigenous people, such as tribes or settlers, as per ADB\u2019s \ndefinition,  are  likely  to  be  affected  significantly  by  a  subproject,  an  indigenous  peoples\u2019  plan \nshould be prepared in accordance with ADB's policy on indigenous peoples.5 \n \n9. \nEnvironmental Considerations. Each proposed subproject will have been screened for \nits  environmental  impacts  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB6 \nand  will  not  cause  any  major  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  in  accordance  with  the \nEnvironmental Assessment Review Framework. ADB will have received and reviewed the initial \nenvironmental examination, if any, prepared for a proposed subproject. All necessary approvals \nand  clearances  will  have  been  obtained  for  the  subproject  from  all  relevant  government \nagencies.  The  requirements,  procedures  for  environmental  assessment,  together  with  the \nsample  terms  of  reference  of  the  environmental  specialist  for  this  purpose  is  included  in \nsupplementary appendixes I and J.  \n \n10. \nCounterpart  Funding.  BR  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart  funding  will  be \nallocated to implement the subproject on a timely and efficient manner, in accordance with the \noverall implementation schedule. \n \n11. \nhave been obtained.  \n \nC. \n \n12. \nAll subprojects will be required to comply with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines, and satisfy \nADB\u2019s  procedures  for  subproject  preparation  with  respect  to  technical,  operational,  economic, \nsocial,  indigenous  people,  resettlement,  and  other  requirements.  BR  will  ensure  that  sufficient \ncounterpart  funding  will  be  available.  The  aforementioned  requirements  were  applied  for  the \nsample  subproject  during  project  preparation  and  were  found  to  be  technically  feasible, \neconomically  viable,  socially  responsible,  and  environmentally  sound.  For  additional  noncore \nsubprojects, the requirements must be met during subproject implementation. \n \n13. \nthe  project \nimplementation unit will prepare an appraisal report for one or more subprojects covering all the \nstipulated ADB requirements with assistance of the detailed design and construction supervision \nconsultant. The report will be sent to ADB for review and approval. Upon ADB\u2019s approval, the \nproject  implementation  unit  will  proceed  with  further  subproject  preparation,  procurement,  and \nsubproject implementation. Subproject designs will explore all options to avoid and/or minimize \nland acquisition and resettlement.  \n \n \n\nGovernment Approvals.

total  length  of  321  kilometers  (km),  with  121 \n1. \nkm doubled-tracked. Double tracking the Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar section is the sample subproject \nof the Investment Project of the Railway Sector Investment Program. Double tracking the other \nsections  will  be  financed  by  other  sources  or  as  another  subproject.  Hence,  all  single-track \nsections  will  be  double-tracked  within  the  Project\u2019s  time  frame.  Because  of  the  impact  of  the \ncorridor network, economic and financial analyses must be carried out for double-tracking all of \nthe 200 km of single-tracked sections.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nBangladesh  Railway  (BR)  data  shows  that  for  fiscal  year  (FY)  2005,  the  passenger \nvolume in the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor was 1,422 million passenger-km for intercity services; \nthis  is  growing  at  6.1%  per  annum.  For  FY2005,  the  freight  volume  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \ncorridor  was  144  million  ton-km  for  container  services  and  108  million  ton-km  for  other  cargo. \nBR statistics show that container volume grew at 8% per annum and other cargo by 5%. All the \nexisting  lines  in  the  subproject  corridors  have  already  reached  their  capacity;  after  2008,  no \nadditional  freight  traffic  growth  is  expected  to  be  possible.  When  the  subproject  is  open  for \nservice  in  2009,  rail  capacity  will  double,  and  boost  the  annual  growth  rate  substantially,  i.e., \n25%  for  containers,  17%  for  other  freight,  and  10%  for  intercity  train  passengers  before  the \ngrowth rate gradually returns to the current rates. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  financial  costs  of  double-tracking  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  line  consist  of  all \nincremental capital expenditures, but exclude price contingency and interest and other charges \nduring construction. The incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the subproject \nfacilities  were  estimated  on  the  basis  of  O&M  cost  parameters  developed  by  BR  from  its \naccumulated cost data. The economic costs include the resource costs for construction, rolling \nstock  acquisition  costs,  O&M  costs,  and  social  costs  arising  from  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  compensation.  Economic  costs  exclude  price  contingencies,  taxes,  duties,  and \ninterest during construction. A standard conversion factor of 0.80 was applied to financial costs \nof nontraded inputs to calculate economic prices. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nThe main economic benefits generated by the subproject were quantified in terms of (i) \nrailway  operating  cost  savings  arising  from  faster  travel  times  for  goods  and  passenger \nservices,  (ii)  savings  in  operating  costs  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic  arising  from  traffic \ndiverted from road to rail made possible with the increase in rail capacity, (iii) savings in working \ncapital  loss for  freight  traffic  arising  from  time  savings  including  elimination  of  waiting  times  to \nget  slots  on  railways  for  the  goods  being  transported,  and  (iv)  time  savings  for  passengers \narising  from  faster  train  travel  times.  Other  benefits,  such  as  savings  in  avoided  road \nmaintenance costs arising from the reduction in laden trucks using the road because the goods \nare being transported by railways, are not considered in the economic evaluation, thus making \nthis analysis conservative. \n \n\nBenefits and Revenues \n\nCosts \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\nEconomic and Financial Internal Rates of Return \n\nIn  the  financial  evaluation,  incremental  revenue  is  based  on  passenger  and  freight \n5. \nrevenue with and without the subproject. The tariff used to calculate the financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR)  is  Tk2.80/ton-km  for  container  freight,  Tk1.91/ton-km  for  other  freight,  and \nTk0.5631/passenger-km  for  intercity  train  passengers.  The  tariff  structure  is  not  assumed  to \nchange for either freight or passengers. Thus, the financial evaluation is conservative. \n \nE. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and FIRR were calculated for the base case \n6. \nand  for  five  sensitivity  test  cases,  i.e.,  (i)  construction  costs  increase  by  10%;  (ii)  benefits  or \ngross  earnings  are  reduced  by  10%;  (iii)  O&M  costs  increase  by  10%;  (iv)  the  construction \nperiod lengthens by 1 year; and (v) the construction period lengthens by 1 year and O&M costs \nincrease by 10%. Table A12 summarizes the EIRR and FIRR values.  \n \n\nTable A12: Economic and Financial Internal Rates of Return Values for Base Case and \nSensitivity Analysis Cases \n\nEconomic Internal \nRate of Return \n\nFinancial Internal Rate \nof Return \n\nScenario \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

Hence, this subproject is economically viable. The FIRR for the base case is \n14%. The weighted average cost of capital is 5% and so this subproject is financially viable. All \nthe  sensitivity  analysis  cases  also  showed  that  the  FIRR  is  above  the  threshold  weighted \naverage cost of capital.  \n \n8. \nanalysis are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n\nFurther details of the assumptions and calculations used for the economic and financial \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nThe  Government  gives  high  priority  to  improving  the  railway  sector  and  proposes  to  finance  priority  investments  to \novercome capacity bottlenecks, and implement organizational and policy reforms to improve the railway\u2019s operational \nand financial performance. This is to increase the sector\u2019s contribution to national economic growth. The absence of \nadequate  railway  infrastructure  exacerbated  by  severe  shortage  of  capacity  on  some  critical  sections,  which  include \nthe major economic and population corridors, has been considered an impediment to development, particularly for the \ntransport  of  goods,  freight,  and  passenger  traffic  between  regions.  Infrastructure  development  encourages  other \ndevelopment initiatives, which together considerably stimulate economic growth. \n \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                          Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe  Investment  Project  of  the  Railway  Sector  Investment  Program  t  will  concentrate  on  enhancing  capacity  to \novercome  constraints  to  increasing  rail  services  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  where  demand  for  intercity \npassenger  and  freight  services  is  high.  This  involves  improving  and  double-tracking  of  196  kilometers  (km)  of  the \nDhaka\u2013Chittagong rail corridor. The core subproject covers a distance of approximately 64 km from Tongi\u2013to Bhairab \nBazar, which covers a total of three districts: Gazipur, Narsindhi, and Kishoreganj. \n \nIn  Bangladesh,  the  incidence  of  povertya  is  high  at  44.9%  in  rural  areas  compared  with  43.3%  for  the  urban \npopulation. The pace of rural poverty reduction was slow in the 1980s, but increased in the 1990s. The reverse is true \nfor  urban  areas.  Progress  in  poverty  reduction  over  the  1990s  has  been  unequal  across  regions,  with  considerable \ndistrict  variation  in  poverty,  as  suggested  by  the  district  agricultural  wage  data  and  various  indicators  of  social \ndeprivations  such  as  illiteracy  and  child  mortality.  In  1999,  the  national  monthly  per  household  income  was  Tk4,812 \nwith  much  lower  levels  of  income  for  poor  households  (Tk3,006),  especially  for  the  rural  poor.  Government  records \nreveal that nearly 31% of the population in the country are engaged as wage laborers in agricultural, nonagricultural, \nand industrial activities; of these, 46% are poor households with the majority living in rural areas. Regional variation in \npoverty is also influenced by the incidence of natural hazards and tends to be higher in disaster-prone areas. The level \nof  poverty  is  typically  higher  for  the  landless,  especially  those  who  have  agricultural  wage  labor  as  their  principal \noccupation, and for those engaged in marginal occupations and skills. The national headcount measure for poverty is \nhighest among households with agricultural and nonagricultural daily wages as their main source of income, which is \nagain  more  predominant  among  rural  households.  Significant  gender  disparity  also  exists  in  income  poverty.  The \nincidence  of  poverty  is  generally  higher  for  households  headed,  managed,  and  supported  by  women,  with  female \nworkers  earning  considerably  less  than  males. The  lower  average  consumption  for  females  is  also  evident  from  the \npersistent gender inequality in severe malnutrition, mortality, and morbidity. \n \nThe Dhaka\u2013Chittagong rail corridor is one of the most important economic and population corridors, with the majority \nof  fertilizer,  natural  gas,  electric  power,  and  garment  industries  located  in  this  region.  Overall,  expansion  of  rail \ncapacity  would  lead  to  increased  freight  and  passenger  services  to  other  regions  of  the  country,  thereby  creating \nopportunities for economic and social development that would lead to poverty reduction. As this corridor provides the \ntransport  linkage  from  the  port  of  Chittagong  not  only  to  Dhaka  but  also  to  the  rest  of  the  rail  network,  the  sample \nsubproject will facilitate growth of local markets and industries thereby creating more employment opportunities, with \nsubstantial  opportunities  being  passed  on  to  unskilled  workers  of  the  area.  Thus  the  sample  subproject  will  connect \nlocal communities, especially the poor and excluded, to increased employment and market opportunities.  \n \nFreight charges by railways will be cheaper than transportation by roads. The benefit of the improved transportation \nfacilities by rail will be passed on to the individual shipper, trader, and entrepreneur in the form of lower freight rates. \nThe decrease in the cost of movement of freight will also reduce the cost of the product. The sample subproject will \nlead to faster traveling times  and rapid delivery and pickup  of cargo. Similarly, the travel time for goods movements \nbetween West Bengal will be shortened and from Chittagong Port to other regions will be reduced to a day instead of \n3\u20134 days.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n57 \n\n \nFaster passenger trips will be another major benefit to the people. With faster and more reliable services, travelers will \nincrease  trip  frequency  for  both  business  and  other  purposes.  The  intercity  running  costs  will  reduce  as  trains  will \noperate on faster schedules. More frequent rail transport services will increase labor mobility. The sample subproject \nwill also reduce poverty by providing employment opportunities during construction and operation to the local people, \nespecially  the  poor.  It  will  provide  increased  business  opportunities  to  the  suppliers  of  goods  and  services  to  the \nrailways  and  thus  generate  more  employment  opportunities.  The  improvement  of  the  rail  network  will  enable  the \npeople,  especially  the  poor  in  the  Dhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor,  to  have  greater  accessibility  to  other  infrastructure \nservices, for example, schools, universities, and hospitals, as the trip time will be decreased and they will be able to \nreach  these  facilities  more  efficiently.  Serious  road  accidents  should  be  reduced  somewhat  as  trucks  and  buses \nconstitute about 48% of the vehicles responsible for over 80% of accidental deaths. Air pollution should be reduced as \na consequence of rail gaining a larger share relative to highway as a consequence of traffic diversions. \n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nConsultations and meetings were conducted with various project communities during the course of the social analysis \nto ascertain their response to the improvement of the rail network. Assessment was made on their needs, demands, \nestimates  of  losses  that  they  would  suffer,  and  steps  to  mitigate  such  losses.  Apart  from  the  public  meetings,  focus \ngroup discussions  were organized during the course of the social appraisal. These discussions were held with men, \nwomen, farmers, traders, entrepreneurs, nongovernment organizations, and Bangladesh Railway officials to ensure a \ncomprehensive perspective on the Project as well as its impacts. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nConsultation with both men and women was ensured during the course of the social analysis to assess the impact of \nthe Project on them. Currently the major portions of the existing route is single line and the frequency of train service is \nirregular  creating  problems  for  men  and  women  in  reaching  the  work  place  and  accessing  other  social  services  on \ntime. Due to less frequent train service, platforms, waiting area, and train compartments get overcrowded, especially \nduring peak office hours when everyone wants to avail the same train service, posing more difficulty for women. The \nProject will lead to an increase in the frequency of the train service, and capacity of the platforms and waiting area will \nbe expanded, thus benefiting both men and women and offer special benefits to women by providing faster and more \nfrequent  access  to  place  of  work  and  different  social  services  like  schools,  health  care  facilities,  markets,  and \nincreased  employment  opportunities.  The  Project  will  also  provide  employment  opportunities  to  both  and  women \nduring  the  construction  phase  and  provisions  will  be  included  in  contractors\u2019  bidding  document  to  ensure  that \ncontractors do not differentiate between men and women\u2019s wages and benefits for work of equal value. Contracts for \nall  subprojects  will  include  specific  clauses  on  these  undertakings,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  by \nBangladesh  Railway  during  project  implementation.  Furthermore  as  the  Project  aims  to  improve  the  country\u2019s \ncompetitiveness in the manufacturing sector (principally the garment industry) by reducing the cost of transportation, \nand  the  vast  majority  of  workers  in  the  garment  industry  are  women,  this  Project  will  facilitate  the  enhancement  of \nsustained employment opportunities for women in the garment and other industries. \n. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n \n\nE.

To mitigate this adverse \nimpact on the affected population, a resettlement plan \nwas prepared for the core subproject. To address the \nresettlement impacts of noncore subprojects, a \nresettlement framework was prepared. Subproject \nresettlement plans will be prepared during \nimplementation. \nCommunities will be better off as a result of faster and \nmore frequent market accessibility and reduced freight \ncharges for transportation of goods. \n\nEmployment opportunities for men and women during the \nconstruction and operation stage will be at minimum wage \nrates and provide equal wages for men and women. \n \n\nNo indigenous people will be adversely affected by the \nProject. \n\nAccording to the National AIDS/STD (sexually transmitted \ndisease) Program, as of December 2004 the estimated \nnumber of HIV positive cases was 7,500, total cumulative \nHIV positive was 465 (reported and confirmed), 87 \ndeveloped AIDS, and the number of AIDS deaths was 44 \n(cumulative number). With a population of more than 140 \nmillion, the reported number of HIV/AIDS cases in \nBangladesh is very low in comparison with other \nneighboring countries. The Project will target construction \nworkers along the project site; civil works contractors will \ndisseminate information at worksites on the risks of \nsexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for those \nemployed during construction. Rail safety measures such \nas the provision of rail gates at intersections of rail and \nroad crossings will be integrated into the project design. \n\na  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, Report of the Poverty Monitoring Survey May 1999. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n\nrailway \n\nin  2003, \n\nincluding  doubling \n\nthe  Dacca\u2013Tongi-Chittagong \n\n1. \nInvestment  Project  Background.

A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  study \ni.e.,  Regional  Rail  Traffic  Enhancement  Project,  made  various \ninitiated \nrecommendations \ntrack  and \nBangladesh Railway (BR) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance for this. The \nimmediate  and  long-term  objectives  of  the  Investment  Project  are  to  (i)  reduce  travel  time,  (ii) \nincrease \nthe  volume  of  cargo  and  passenger  movement,  (iii)  ensure  uninterrupted \ncargo/passenger  movement,  and  (iv)  increase  economic  activities  of  the  people  in  the  region. \nAs a Multitranche Financing Facility Investment Project, the sections are classified as (i) sample \nsubproject to be appraised by ADB or (ii) nonsample subprojects to be prepared, screened, and \nappraised  by  BR  prior  to  submission  to  ADB  for  approval  under  the  sector  lending  approach. \nThe section Tongi\u2013Bhairab Bazar (64 km) has been selected as the sample subproject for loan \nprocessing.  Although  most  of  the  improvement  will  be  carried  out  within  existing  BR  land,  the \nsubproject will affect 832 households and other establishments (4,389 people will be affected) in \n6  thanas  of  Gazipur,  Narshingdi,  and  Kishoreganj  districts.  In  addition,  an  estimated  1,222 \npeople in 225 households are likely to be affected due to acquisition of agricultural land. Apart \nfrom  these,  some  170  agricultural  leaseholders  and  100  commercial  leaseholders  will  lose \naccess to land (licensed from BR) and suffer losses in their livelihood. \n \n\nScope  of  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  subproject  will  need  additional \n2. \nland  on  the  left  of  the  existing  railway  embankments  from  Tongi  to  Bhairab  Bazar.  The  small \nbridges will be built/strengthened for accommodation of the second track. However, the larger \nbridges (more than 12.2 meters) will need a second structure with 1 km approach at each end.  \n \n\nTable A14.1: Acquisition of Assets for the Subproject \n \n\nAcquisition of \nStructure (sm)  \n\nAcquisition of \nTrees (number) \n\n \n \nDistricts \nGazipur \n\nNarshingdi \n\nKishoreganj \n\nAcquisition \nof Land \n(ha) \n4 \n\n12 \n\n0 \n\nTotal \n\n16 \n        ha = hectare, sm = square meter. \n        Source: Socioeconomic survey, June 2004.  \n\n \n \n \n\n5,113 \n\n26,319 \n\n121 \n\n31,553 \n\n3,060 \n\n2,560 \n\n0 \n\n5,620 \n\nThe subproject will require an estimated 16.00 hectares (ha) of additional land; 4 ha in \n3. \nGazipur and 12 ha in Norshingdi districts (Table A14.1). The estimate is based on the technical \ndesign for 18.2 to 21.4 meters right-of-way from the central line of the existing railway track. The \nadverse impacts due to vacating the right-of-way land over a length of 64 km will displace 832 \nhouseholds  and  establishments.  The  displacement  will  cause  dismantling  of  31,553  square \nmeters (sm) of structures of different categories and felling 5,620 trees of various species and \nsizes.  As  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  project,  BR  will  implement  the  land  acquisition  and \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nresettlement  plan  for  replacement  of  lost  assets  by  those  affected  and  restitution  of  their  pre-\nproject socioeconomic condition.  \n\n4. \nSocioeconomic  Information  of  People  Affected.  A  full  census  and  a  sample \nsocioeconomic  survey  were  conducted  in  June  2004  to  identify  those  affected,  the  impact \ncategories, losses, and their socioeconomic condition. The date of conducting the survey will be \nconsidered  as  the  cut-off  date  for  payment  of  resettlement  benefits.  Video  filming  of  all \nstructures on the right-of-way was prepared to control fraudulent claims. However, the database \nwill be updated for concrete information as per final design. About 4,389 people will be affected \ndue  to  displacement  of  237  households  and  570  small  business  enterprises  (Table  14.2).  In \naddition,  25  community  structures  (including  a  toilet)  will  be  displaced.  Apart  from  this,  225 \nhouseholds  would  lose  narrow  strips  of  agricultural  land  and  some  of  the  persons  will  lose \naccess  to  agricultural  and  commercial  plots  licensed  from  BR  (para  3,  section  1).  Average \nhousehold  size  is  5.44  and  male-female  ratio  is  100:88.  The  households/shops  include  211 \nowners,  62  occupants,  217  squatters,  25  encroachers  and  317  tenants.  Women  head  21 \nhouseholds. The project will not affect any indigenous people or ethnic minorities.  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A14.2: Project Impacts and Displacements \n\nHHs \n\nTotal \n\nSBEs \n\nCRPs \n\nTenancy to \nLand \nEncroacher \nOccupier \nOwner \nSquatter \nTenant \n \nHHs = households, SBEs = small business enterprises, CRPs  = community resources properties. \nSource: Socioeconomic Survey, June 2004 \n\nTotal People \nAffected \n126 \n269 \n1,138 \n1,105 \n1,751 \n4,389 \n\n14 \n13 \n134 \n38 \n38 \n237 \n\n9\n48\n61\n174\n278\n570\n\n25\n62\n211\n217\n317\n832\n\n2\n1\n16\n5\n1\n25\n\nTotal \n\n% \n\n2.87\n6.13\n25.93\n25.17\n39.90\n100\n\n5. \nVery  few  people  living  on  the  right-of-way  are  involved  in  agro-farming  (5.4%)  as  a \nsource of income. Small business is the primary occupation of 47.44% of the income earners, \nwhile 17% are involved in services and 10% in petty trading. About 6% of the income earners \nare  female,  most  are  service  providers  (34%).  About  15.37%  of  the  households  and  shop-\nowners on the right-of-way earn up to Tk2,550 per month, which is below the extreme poverty \nline.1 Sixteen  percent  (16.73%)  have  income  between  Tk2,550  and  Tk3,600,2 still  below  the \npoverty line. Twenty-one percent earn a moderate income between Tk3,600 and Tk5,000. The \nremaining  47%  earn  higher  incomes  above  Tk5,000.  This  means  that  32.10%  of  the  affected \nhouseholds are poor.     \n\n6. \nLegal  Framework  for  Land  Acquisition.  At the design stage, the subproject will take \nall  measures  to  reduce  the  amount  of  land  acquisition  and  population  displacement  to  the \nminimum,  taking  into  account  the  need  for  the  subproject.  The  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of \nImmovable  Property  Ordinance  (1982)  will  be  applied,  including  the  subsequent  amendments \nfrom  1993\u20131995.  The  ordinance  requires  that  compensation  be  paid  for  (i)  land  and  assets \npermanently  acquired  (including  standing  crops,  trees,  houses),  and  (ii)  any  other  damages \ncaused  by  such  acquisition.  The  deputy  commissioner,  through  a  committee,  determines  the \nmarket  price  of  assets  based  on  the  approved  procedure  and  pays  an  additional  50% \n\n                                                 \n1   Extreme poverty line is calculated at Tk510 per person per month. \n2   The  official  poverty  line  is  calculated  for  2,122  kilocalorie  intake  per  person  per  day,  which  is  ensured  by  a  per \n\ncapita monthly income of Tk720. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n61 \n \n\ncompensation  on  the  assessed  value.  The  1994  amendment  made  provisions  for  payment  of \ncrop  compensation  to  tenant  cultivators.  The  ordinance,  however,  does  not  cover  people \naffected  by  a  project  who  do  not  have  titles  or  ownership  records  such  as  informal \nsettlers/squatters.  \n\nObjectives of the Resettlement Plan. This summary resettlement plan (RP) addresses \n7. \nboth  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  issues  within  the  legal  framework  of  the  Government  and \nADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement. The RP will cover those displaced by the subproject \nand  provide  income  restoration  assistance  to  the  poor  and  informal  settlers3 on  the  railway \nembankment. Thus, the RP approach incorporates (i) land acquisition and resettlement issues, \n(ii)  impact  mitigation  with  special  attention  to  women  and  vulnerable  groups,  and  (iii)  income \ngenerating  activities  as  a  development  program.  The  main  principles  of  the  RP  are  to  (i) \nminimize negative impacts in consultation with the design engineers and BR; (ii) closely consult \nthose  affected  on  RP  policy,  and  poverty  and  rehabilitation  issues;  (iii)  carry  out  resettlement \nand  social  development  activities  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  the  pre-project  standards  of \nliving  of  those  affected;4 and  (iv)  provide  compensation  for  affected  property  at  market  price \nprior to relocation.  \n\n8. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Policy.  The 1982 Ordinance is the only law that \nprovides  clearly  defined  compensation  for  land  acquisition  for  development  projects.  In  the \nabsence of a national resettlement policy, ADB policy on involuntary resettlement5 was followed \nin  preparing  the  RP.  Compensation  for  lost  assets  (land,  tree,  structure,  and  other  physical \nestablishments)  will  be  accorded  to  the  owners  through  the  deputy  commissioners  as  per \nmarket  value  assessed  through  legal  procedure  (Table  A14.3).  An  entitlement  matrix  was \ndeveloped  that  describes  the  unit  of  entitlements  for  compensating  for  lost  assets,  various \nresettlement  assistance,  and  benefits.  Any  positive  differential  for  acquired  assets  for \nreplacement market value as assessed by the property valuation advisory team (PVAT) through \nan  independent  agency  and  other  resettlement  benefits  as  per  ADB  policy  will  be  provided. \nHouseholds headed by women and other vulnerable households will be eligible for further cash \nassistance for relocation. \n\n \n\nTable A14.3: Entitlement Matrix \n\nType of Loss \n\nApplication \n\nEntitlement \n\nExpected Results \n\n1.

Public \nconsultation  meetings  were  held  at  various  locations  involving  those  affected,  business \ncommunity, and community leaders. The project concept and land acquisition requirements as \nper design were presented to them. They were consulted on their options and restrictions due to \nimproved  railway  and  impact  on  trade  and  transportation  of  agricultural  and  industrial \ncommodities.  Public  consultation  was  carried  out  at  various  places  on  the  65  km  railway \nembankment during the survey. Those affected had the opportunity to express their choices on \nrelocation and resettlement in the consultation meetings. Finally, participation of project-affected \npeople is also ensured through their involvement in the grievances redress committees (GRCs). \nThe  resettlement  unit  within \nfield  offices,  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  establish  and  continuously  maintain  an  ongoing \nidentify  problems  and  undertake \ninteraction  with \nremedial/correctional  actions.  BR  has  notified  those  affected  of  the  RP. A  summary  of  the  RP \nwas prepared specifically for this purpose and translated into simple Bangla, and presented in \nthe form of a brochure, to enable local communities to read it by themselves and be aware of \n\nthose  affected  and  communities \n\nimplementation  unit,  BR \n\nthe  project \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n63 \n \n\nthe  subproject's  benefits  and  provisions  available  herein  for  various  types  people  affected,  as \ngiven in the entitlement matrix. In addition, the RP will be disclosed through the official websites \nof BR and ADB.  \n\n10. \nRelocation  of  Housing  and  Settlement.  The  subproject  is  taking  land  along  a  long \nnarrow  strip.  It  will  not  be  desirable  to  provide  an  organized  relocation  site  because  this  will \ncause  more  social  disruption.  The  subproject  will  encourage  \u201cself-relocation\u201d  by  affected \nhouseholds selecting replacement homestead land in the vicinity of their relatives. The objective \nis to minimize social disruption in the resettlement process and allow people to remain together \nwithin  kin  groups  for  mutual  support.  The  affected  households  and  shops  are  very  much \ninterested in remaining close to the present location for their client base, income and livelihood \nopportunity associated with the railway stations, and market places developed near the railway \nline. The subproject will provide support to the host area in the form of additional civic amenities \n(for  example,  provision  for  tube-wells  for  drinking  water,  schools,  and  access  roads,  if \nnecessary) for community uses. This will encourage villagers to accept more of those affected in \ntheir vicinities.  \n\nIncome  Restoration  Strategy.  The  vulnerable  people  affected,  including  those \n11. \nexperiencing  indirect  or  secondary  impacts,  will  be  eligible  for  assistance  due  to  loss  of \nemployment/wages because of dislocation. There is the risk that the cash compensation to the \nhead  of  the  household  may  not  meet  the  women's  and  children's  subsistence.  Therefore,  the \neligible  members  of  affected  families  should  receive  training  and  credit  support  for  income \ngenerating  activities  for  sustainable  income  restoration.  The  poor  and  the  vulnerable  will  be \ncovered  under  income  generating  activities  through  HRD  and  OSD  training  and  subsequent \ncredit  support.  The  RP  will  have  provisions  to  provide  assistance  to  affected  CBEs  to  restore \nand  regain  their  businesses.  All  CBEs,  irrespective  of  titled/nontitled  owners  of  business \npremises,  will  receive  a  cash  grant  for  loss  of  access  to  business  premise,  plus  shifting  or \nmoving  allowance,  and  one-time  cash  grant  for  loss  of  income.  This  assistance  is  intended  to \nsupplement CBEs duration transitional period to reestablish businesses in new locations. \n\n12.  \nInstitutional  Framework.  BR  will  implement  the  RP  by  setting  up  a  resettlement  unit \nwithin the project implementation unit, which will be established for the Investment Project. The \nresettlement unit, under the overall responsibility of the project director, will implement the RP. \nThe resettlement unit will have one deputy director at headquarters and one deputy director in \nthe field who will implement the plan. The resettlement unit staff will be trained after deployment. \nThe  project  director  will  confirm  the  land  acquisition  with  assistance  of  district  administrations \nand  deputy  directors  (Resettlement).  Upon  clearance  of  the  land  acquisition  proposal  by  the \ndeputy commissioner or Ministry of Land, a PVAT will be formed through Government gazette to \nrecommend  replacement  market  price  of  land  and  other  properties.  PVAT  will  have \nrepresentatives from BR in the chair, representative from the implementing NGO as the member \nsecretary,  and  representative  from  the  deputy  commissioners.  An  implementing  NGO  will  be \ncontracted to assist the resettlement unit in implementing the resettlement tasks. The NGO will \ncollect,  collate,  computerize,  and  process  data  for  identification  of  eligible  people  for \nresettlement benefits and assess their entitlements as per RP policy. The resettlement unit will \neffect the payments after necessary scrutiny.  \n \n13. \nthose  affected, \nwomen/vulnerable  groups,  local  government,  and  NGOs.  Those  affected  can  call  upon  the \nsupport  of  NGOs  to  assist  them  in  presenting  their  grievances  or  queries  to  the  GRC.  The \ndeputy director, resettlement, field, will chair the GRC. Other than disputes relating to ownership \nright under the court of law, the GRC will review grievances involving all resettlement benefits, \nrelocation, and other assistance. Grievances will be redressed within a month from the date of \n\nGRCs  will  be  established  with \n\nrepresentation \n\nfrom  BR, \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nlodging  the  complaints.  To  ensure  people\u2019s  participation,  the  NGO  will  form  a  resettlement \nadvisory  committee  comprising  local  leaders,  both  men  and  women,  such  as  people's \nrepresentatives,  teachers,  imams,  knowledgeable  persons,  headmen,  etc.  The  committee  will \nadvise on the best ways to implement the RP smoothly and efficiently. The GRCs, resettlement \nadvisory  committees,  as  well  as  the  JVT  and  PVAT  formed  and  activated  during  the  land \nacquisition  process  will  allow  those  affected  sufficient  time  to  lodge  complaints  and  safeguard \ntheir recognized interests.  \n\n14. \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Budget and Financing. The land acquisition and \nresettlement  budget  includes  all  costs  for  acquisition  of  assets  and  costs  associated  with \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  The  management  and  implementation  of  RP  activities  include \nadditional  studies  for  needs  assessment,  capacity  building,  hiring  NGO  for  implementation, \ntransport,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  etc.  The  total  estimated  cost  is  Tk216.09  million  ($3.712 \nmillion) and will be financed by the Government. At this stage, the costs can be considered as \nestimates and will be revised after updating the RP database during implementation.  \n\nTable A14.4: Land Acquisition and Resettlement Budget \n\nCost Items \nLand Acquisition \nResettlement \nRehabilitation \nAdministration and Management \n \n\nTotal \n\n$ million \n2.597 \n0.672 \n0.259 \n0.184 \n3.712 \n\nTk million \n151.96 \n39.29 \n15.20 \n10.75 \n216.09 \n\n15. \nRP  Implementation  Schedule.  The  RP  will  be  implemented  from  April  2007  over  3 \nyears. BR will initiate some advance actions such as the establishment of the resettlement unit; \nidentification of resettlement staff in the field offices; formation of PVAT and GRCs; and hiring of \nan NGO for resettlement implementation following loan negotiations. The overall schedule of RP \nimplementation is based on the principle that people affected by land acquisition are paid their \nlegal  compensation  and  due  resettlement  benefits  prior  to  relocation.  House  transfer  will  be \nassisted  prior  to  or  during  relocation  of  the  households  from  the  right-of-way.  The  RP \nimplementation  schedule  may  be  revised  as  per  field  situation  in  consultation  with  BR  and \nconcurrence from ADB.  \n\n16.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  implementation  will  be \nsupervised  and  monitored  by  the  project  director  in  coordination  with  the  deputy  director-\nresettlement,  BR  field  staff,  construction  supervision  consultant,  and  the  resettlement-\nimplementing  NGO.  The  monitoring  will  be  done  both  internally  and  externally  to  provide \nfeedback  to  BR  and  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  RP  implementation  process.  A \ncomputerized  management  information  system  will  be  in  operation  for  monitoring  RP \nimplementation.  The  internal  monitoring  by  BR  will  deal  with  all  aspects  of  relocation, \nresettlement,  and  rehabilitation  of  the  households.  The  field  deputy  director-resettlement, \nassisted  by  the  RP  implementing  NGO  will  conduct  field  monitoring  and  assess  the  daily \noperation of resettlement activities.  \n \n17. \nThe  resettlement  specialist  of  the  construction  supervision  consultant  will  supervise, \nmonitor, and assist RP implementation. The supervision and monitoring work will involve review \nof resettlement implementation, verification of the results of internal monitoring in the field, and \nconsultation with those affected, officials, and community leaders for preparing review reports. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n65 \n \n\nMonthly  progress  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  the  project  director  by  the  NGO. \nDuring  the  implementation,  the  project  director  will  periodically  send  status  reports  to  ADB  on \nRP  implementation  and  a  final  report  once  the  resettlement  is  completed.
