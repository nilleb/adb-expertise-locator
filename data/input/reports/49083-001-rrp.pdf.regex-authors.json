THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nfor Countercyclical Support to the Republic of Kazakhstan.  \n \n2.  The proposed loan will help the government mitigate the sudden and significant negative \neconomic impact caused by the steep fall in oil prices and the economic slowdown in the \nRussian Federation. The government\u2019s planned fiscal stimulus expenditure will help Kazakhstan \nstabilize and continue its economic growth trajectory while targeting fiscal sustainability in the \nmedium  term.  The  proposed  loan  will  contribute  to  employment  creation,  social  services \nprovision, and low-income household support; expand and modernize physical infrastructure; \nand promote inclusive private sector development.1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed from an average of 10.2% during 2000\u2013\n2007 to 3.3% in 2008 and 1.2% in 2009 during the global financial crisis. Responding to the \ncrisis  the  government  implemented  the  Anti-Crisis  Plan  and  the  Employment  Generation \nProgram,  which  included  funding  from  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  countercyclical \nsupport  loan  of  $500  million.2 The  government  also  drew  upon  the  National  Fund  of  the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan (NFRK) to implement the reforms, which cost the government about \n$24.4 billion during 2008\u20132010.3 The countercyclical measures undertaken in response to the \nglobal crisis, along with rising oil prices, enabled a return to higher economic growth averaging \n6.4% during 2010\u20132013, but growth did not rebound to pre-crisis growth rates. \n \n1.  Serious Impact of Adverse External Factors \n4.  In  2014,  two  significant  external  factors  impaired  economic  growth,  revenue \nperformance, and the government\u2019s ability to mitigate these effects. The first was the \nRussian Federation\u2019s economic slowdown, which triggered a downward adjustment in the tenge \nexchange rate equivalent to 16.2%, or a 19.4% rise in the tenge\u2013dollar exchange rate.4 The \nRussian Republic provides all pipelines and ports for Kazakh oil and mineral exports, and \nsupplies about 36% of total imports. The economies are further linked through joint membership \nin the European Economic Union. The second was the steep fall in world oil prices, which fell by \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

Manila.  \n3  The NFRK, established in 2000, ensures stable social and economic development and saving of financial \nresources for future generations. To ensure transparency, transfers from the NFRK are published, and pass \nthrough the republican budget. Transfers include (i) guaranteed transfers to support economic growth, and  \n(ii) targeted transfers for socially important projects that are not self-sustaining and that can be provided by order of \nthe President of Kazakhstan in the absence of alternative financing sources. Direct transfers from the NFRK to \nstate-owned enterprises are not reflected in the republican budget. Collected Acts of the President and the \nGovernment of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 2010. On the Concept of establishment and use of the National Fund \nof the Republic of Kazakhstan. Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 962 dated 2 April 2010. \nSource for NFRK assets: http://www.nationalbank.kz \n4  Since September 2013, the tenge has been measured against a basket of currencies, which helped reduce the \neffect of the weakening Russian ruble. The exchange rate band has gradually widened from T185 \u00b1 T3 = $1 in \nFebruary 2014, from T155 the previous day; T185 +T3 to T185 -T15 in September 2014; and to T185 +T13 to \nT185 -T15 in July 2015, widening the band to T170\u2013T198 = $1. \n ", "2 \n \nmore than 50% from the end of 2013 to the end of 2014.5 Kazakhstan\u2019s economy is heavily \ndependent on oil, which accounts for about 20.0% of GDP, 50.0% of budget revenues, and \n76.0% of exports. \n \n5.  The downward exchange rate adjustment of the domestic currency in February \n2014 undermined confidence in the tenge, increased dollarization, and increased the \nlikelihood of firms\u2019 balance sheet and liquidity risks. Firms and households converted tenge \ndeposits  into foreign  currency, the tenge money  supply  dropped,  and  deposit  dollarization \nincreased from 37.4% in 2013 to 52.2% by May 2015. Loan dollarization has remained largely \nthe same. Lending has slowed and had by May 2015 contracted 1.9% on a year-on-year basis. \nDeposits  contracted  0.7%  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  Market  indicators  suggest  a  higher \nperceived credit risk, which is making it harder for Kazakhstan to access international markets \nfor  funding  without  increased  cost.  In  2015,  two  of  three  main  global  rating  agencies \ndowngraded Kazakhstan\u2019s sovereign rating, contributing to greater increases in the cost of \nsovereign borrowing on international capital markets.6 Kazakhstan on 14 July 2015 issued a 10-\nyear dollar denominated bond in the amount of $2.5 billion with a 5.1% coupon and a 30-year \ndollar denominated bond in the amount of $1.5 billion with a 6.5% coupon. A Eurobond was \nissued in October 2014 in 10-year dollar-denominated bonds priced to yield 4.07% and 30-year \ndollar-denominated bonds priced to yield 5.12%, prices which were 1.03% and 1.38% lower \nrespectively than the 2015 bonds.  \n \n6.  The adverse external factors have had a significant negative effect on the real \neconomy. GDP growth fell from 6% in 2013 to 4.3% in 2014, and is projected to drop to \n1.9% in 2015. The slowdown is due to lower oil industry output, weaker external demand for \nKazakhstan\u2019s  metal  exports,  and  declining  domestic  demand. The  lower  commodity  prices \ncaused export revenues to fall by 8.6% in 2014, from a 1.1% decline in 2013. Consumption \ngrowth\u2014a key economic growth driver\u2014fell from 12.8% in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014, due to the \ndownward  adjustment  of  the  tenge  and  tighter  consumer  lending.  The  current  account  is \nprojected to move to a deficit of 1.0% in 2015. The 12-month inflation rate increased from 5.8% \nin 2013 to 6.7% in 2014,7 but in June 2015 inflation was 3.9% year-on-year. \n \n7.  While fiscal policy is sound, the government budget is under pressure to meet \ncritical expenditures. The budget deficit expanded from 2.0% of GDP in 2013 to 2.7% in 2014 \n($6 billion equivalent) and is projected to increase to 3.0% in 2015 ($6.8 billion equivalent). \nTransfers from the NFRK to the budget were increased from 26.7% of total revenue in 2013 to \n32.6% of total revenue in 2014. The increased NFRK transfers in 2014, together with a 13.3% \nrise in corporate income tax revenue, caused total budget revenue to increase to 15.1% of GDP \nin 2014. However, the post-tenge adjustment pay rise and higher pensions and social transfers \nincreased expenditure to 17.9% of GDP in 2014. To meet the budget gap, the government sold \n$2.5 billion in Eurobonds in October 2014, pushing public and publicly guaranteed debt up 2.3% \nto about 15.2% in 2014. \n \n8.  The economic decline dampens employment prospects. The historic relationship \nbetween job creation and growth has been weak. This reflects the capital-intensive nature of the \neconomy,  dominated  by  the  oil  subsector  with  a  small,  undiversified  private  sector.  The \n                                                \n5  Due to measurement methods and economic developments, the report may contain minor data inconsistencies. \n6  Moody's rates Kazakhstan Baa2 (stable outlook), S&P rates it BBB (negative outlook), and Fitch rates it BBB+ \n(stable outlook). Kazakhstan retained its investment grade through the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis. \n7  Core inflation increased from 4.3% in 2013 to 6.7% in 2014. ", "3 \ngovernment implemented the first employment road map in 2009 in response to the global \nfinancial  crisis,  undertaking  public  works  to  contain  sudden  rises  in  unemployment.  This \ncountercyclical measure contributed to a reduction in unemployment from 6.6% in 2009 to 5.1% \nin 2014.8 Job creation in services helped keep poverty low, and poverty incidence decreased \nfrom 6.6% in 2009 to 2.8% in 2014.9 However, 28.0% of the economically active population is \nself-employed, and is highly vulnerable to the current economic downturn. These workers also \nare less likely to be covered by social protection and support.10 Current challenges that the \ngovernment  will  address  using  countercyclical  measures  include  (i)  the  unproductive  farm \nstructure, which reflects limited access to credit and weak integration of food value chains; (ii) \nthe underdeveloped private sector, which does not sufficiently increase employment; (iii) the \nlarge public sector, with higher compensation and benefit packages than the private sector; and \n(iv) the demand for labor, which does not match the available skills mix. \n \n2.  Countercyclical Response by the Government  \n9.  Starting in 2014 the government introduced three main measures to mitigate the \nsignificant negative impacts of Russian Federation\u2019s economic slowdown and steep fall in \nworld oil prices, and to deliver the conditions for sustainable, long-term, inclusive economic \ngrowth.  First,  in  early  2014  the  government  launched  a  long-term  development  strategy, \nKazakhstan 2050, to transform the economy into a diversified, private sector-driven, developed \neconomy. To commence implementation of this strategy, the government developed medium-\nterm action plans to be implemented under Partnership Framework Arrangements (PFA) with \nmultilateral development banks (MDBs).11 Spending priorities include (i) $1 billion equivalent to \nincrease lending for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in manufacturing to increase \nincome-generating opportunities; (ii) $0.8 billion equivalent to finance infrastructure projects, \nparticularly  regional  projects  in  housing  and  utilities,  road  construction  and  repair,  and \nreconstruction of social facilities; (iii) $1.4 billion equivalent for the Fund for Problem Loans to \nsupport banking by purchasing qualified nonperforming loans (NPLs); and (iv) an additional $2.2 \nbillion equivalent for other projects under the PFA. ADB is expected to support two programs in \n2016 under the PFA.12 \n \n10.  The  second  measure  is  the  Nurly  Zhol  program  for  infrastructure  development, \napproved in April 2015. It includes economic support of $9 billion equivalent\u2014with annual \nallocations for 2015, 2016, and 2017\u2014to be financed through the budget by the NFRK and \nMDB loans. The program will continue reforms to support and stabilize economic growth and \nemployment, including anti-crisis measures for individual sectors of the economy facing export \ndeclines. Spending priorities include (i) developing and modernizing infrastructure to support \neducation, tourism, housing, utilities, transport, and logistics; (ii) developing non-oil business \nsectors, including manufacturing and agribusiness; and (iii) improving the business environment, \n                                                \n8  World Bank.

The PFA will deepen cooperation to achieve the goals to  support the \ngovernment\u2019s development strategies over the next decade. This is reflected in the government\u2019s increased \nfunding share in ADB. (ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Kazakhstan, 2012\u20132016. Manila). 2014.

Among  other  results,  Nurly  Zhol  will  address \nproblems  with  the  shortage  of  preschool  educational  institutions,  three-shift  education  in \nsecondary schools, and poor materials and technical equipment in higher education institutions. \nTo stimulate entrepreneurship, funds will be provided for loans to manufacturing businesses to \nhelp create work for more than 4,000 people. In total, the Nurly Zhol expects to generate about \n395,000 jobs by 2019 through investment projects. \n \n11.  The  third  measure  is  the  Employment  Roadmap  2020,  financed  with  $200  million \nequivalent in the revised March 2015 budget, with similar allocations planned for 2016 and 2017. \nTarget population groups include the self-employed, unemployed, part-time, and low-income \npersons, including youth, women, and the disabled. The road map has three objectives: (i) \npromote employment of self-employed, unemployed, and target population groups; (ii) develop \nhuman resources; and (iii) improve targeted social assistance. It includes increased access to \nemployment opportunities, training, and retraining; and strengthening of the linkage between \nparticipation in employment programs (training) and access to social services and aid. By 2020, \nthe target is to keep the total unemployment rate below 5.0%, the unemployment rate of women \nbelow 5.5%, and the youth unemployment rate (15\u201328 years of age) below 4.6%. \n \n12.  The government also has taken steps to attract investment to the non-oil economy. The \nFramework for Attracting Foreign and Domestic Investment into Kazakhstan presented in April \n2014 includes a package of incentives for investors: (i) investment subsidies, tax preferences, \nand  procurement  incentives;  (ii)  stable  laws  and  cost  predictability  for  tax,  migration  and \nenvironmental  legislation,  and  predictable  tariffs  and  prices  of  regulated  services;  (iii) \nestablishment of a single window for investors; (iv) energy and transport cost subsidies; and (v) \nattraction  of  foreign  labor.  Additional  measures  include  (i)  a  simplified  visa  regime,  \n(ii)  extended  duration  of  agricultural  land  leases  for  foreigners,  and  (iii)  an  investment \nombudsman. In May 2015, the Plan for the Nation: 100 Concrete Steps for Implementation of \nInstitutional Reforms was approved in response to current global and domestic challenges. A \ndetailed action plan includes policy improvements, outputs, and activities to be completed in \n2015. It supports activities in both the Nurly Zhol and the Employment Roadmap 2020. \n \n3.  Measures  to  Ensure  Sound  Macroeconomic  Management,  Including  a \nSound Fiscal Position \n13.  The government and the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK), the country\u2019s central \nbank, have taken proactive monetary, fiscal, and regulatory measures to address the \nsignificant negative external pressures on the economy. Monetary policy in 2014 aimed to \nmaintain price stability and rehabilitate the banking system, while preventing a post-devaluation \ndownturn. The monetary policy for 2015 and 2016 targets macroeconomic and financial stability, \nas well as domestic and external competitiveness.13 To restore trust in the tenge and stimulate \nlending, measures have been taken to address the scarcity of long-term tenge funding and the \nhigh level of dollarization in the banking system. In a move towards inflation targeting, which will \nrequire a shift to a more flexible exchange rate, since the February 2014 devaluation the \ngovernment has widened the exchange rate band on two occasions (footnote 4).14 The NBK \nalso plans to moderate exchange rate fluctuation, while limiting market intervention to conserve \n                                                \n13 Monetary Policy Guidelines of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2015, approved by Resolution of the Board of the \nNational Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated 25 February 2015 No. 30; and ADB. 2015.

Measures to reduce dollarization in the economy include a doubling of the ceiling on \ntenge deposit insurance guarantees to T10 million, while maintaining the T5 million limit on \nforeign currency deposits.  \n \n14.  Efforts are under way to strengthen the financial system, rehabilitate weakened \nbanks, and develop capital markets. Requirements for higher bank capitalization will take \neffect on 1 January 2016. Measures under way to reduce the high number of non-performing \nloans (NPLs), a legacy from the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis, include (i) implementation of \nmaximum percentages of NPLs in bank portfolios (10% starting January 2016); (ii) amendments \nto three laws to facilitate the writing off of NPLs; (iii) write-offs of bad loans from bank balance \nsheets; and (iv) provision of funds to buy qualified NPLs from banks for work-outs at later dates. \nIn 2014, the government allocated $1.4 billion equivalent from the NFRK to capitalize the Fund \nfor Problem Loans to purchase NPLs from banks. These steps enabled NPL reduction from \n33.7% of total bank portfolios in April 2014 to 23.1% ($17.6 billion equivalent) in April 2015. \n \n15.  Government fiscal policy is to balance the budget and manage drawdowns from \nthe NFRK by (i) developing a consistent medium-term macro-fiscal framework; (ii) increasing \nthe sustainability of the non-oil deficit over the medium-term; and (iii) reducing the non-oil deficit \nfrom 7.7% of GDP in 2014 to 2.8% by 2020. However, for the next two years the budget and \nrelated NFRK transfers will be under significant pressure. In March 2015, the budget was \nrevised, at which time revenues were reduced by 14% and expenditures by 10%. Government \nsalary increases were delayed, but social support and services allocations were increased to \n39.1% of the budget. Slower growth, lower oil revenues, reduced export duties, and constrained \nimports are expected to continue to limit revenues, while expenditure must be sustained to meet \neconomic growth needs. Thus the revised budget projects a deficit of 3.0% of GDP in 2015 or \n$6.8 billion equivalent, and the provisional 2016 budget projects a deficit of 2.4% of GDP or \nabout  $5.8  billion  equivalent.15 To  support  the  2015  budget,  the  government  allocated \nguaranteed and targeted transfers from the NFRK of $13.4 billion equivalent or 41.5% of total \nrevenue. Total NFRK allocations for 2016 are projected at about $11.2 billion. The transfers in \nboth years will be insufficient to fill the budget deficit, and the government will need to go to the \nmarket and MDBs to meet the shortfall.16 The projections suggest that public and publicly \nguaranteed debt will need to increase to 17.6% of GDP in 2015 and to 19.0% in 2016.17 \n \n16.  To ensure sustainable use of NFRK resources, a presidential decree established rules of \noperation which provide for maximum guaranteed transfers to support the economy, a minimum \ntotal asset size to perform the mandated savings functions of the NFRK, a limit for government \ndebt service tied to investment income, and a debt service link to revenues including NFRK \ntransfers (footnote 3). The maximum amount for guaranteed transfers has now been reached. \nThe increased use of NFRK resources to support the economy, together with lower income from \noil, have resulted in a contraction of asset growth, Total assets of the NFRK of $69 billion in May \n                                                \n15 The revised budget revenues are based on oil price forecasts of $50.00 a barrel. This is not sufficient to meet the \nfiscal break-even oil price of $80.00/barrel for 2015.The external break-even point, the price of oil when the current \naccount balance is zero, is about $105.30 for 2015. The fiscal break-even point is the price of oil at which the fiscal \nbalance is zero. \n16 Transfers from the NFRK in 2015 are $9.2 billion equivalent in guaranteed transfers, and $4.2 billion equivalent in \ntargeted transfers. Equivalent amounts in 2016 are projected at about $9.2 billion in guaranteed transfers and $2.0 \nbillion in targeted transfers. \n17 Monetary Policy Guidelines of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2015, approved by the Resolution of the Board of the \nNational Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated 25 February, 2015 No. 30; International Monetary Fund. 2014. \nRegional  Economic  Outlook:  Middle  East  and  Central  Asia.

The threshold for annual government debt service is expected \nto be $3.3 billion in 2015, given the impact of the exchange rate adjustment. The 2014 debt \nservice ratio is expected to increase to 10.2% in 2015.18 These debt ratios are within the limits. \n \n17.  Based on government macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions, the public debt\u2013GDP \nratio is expected to increase to 17.6% in 2015 and 19.0% in 2016. It is projected to fall to 15.0% \nby 2018 and 13.9% by 2020, as economic growth rebounds and fiscal deficits shrink. A low debt \nratio suggests that public debt is sustainable, if government assumptions are realized. Assets of \nthe NFRK support ADB\u2019s conclusion that the medium term outlook is generally benign. The \nimpact  of  the  proposed  loan  for  countercyclical  support  on  public  debt  sustainability  was \nassessed under a scenario that reflects ADB disbursing a $1 billion loan in two equal tranches \nof $500 million in 2015, jointly with expected World Bank loans of $1 billion in 2015 and $1 \nbillion in 2016. The joint effect initially raises the public debt ratio to 20.2% by 2016, compared \nwith the baseline of 19.0%, and then converges to the baseline due to swift amortization and the \npredominantly benign debt dynamics incorporated in the projections.19 \n \n4.  Proposed Loan for Countercyclical Support  \n18.  The  proposed  loan  results  from  extensive  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment and development partners on economic developments, policy reform, anti-\ncrisis measures, management and monitoring of reform efforts, and other related areas.20 \nThe government is committed to mitigating the impacts of the adverse economic developments, \nimplementing  countercyclical  expenditures  and  related  policies  to  address  the  significant \nnegative effects of the oil price decline and the Russian Federation\u2019s economic slowdown, and \nmaintaining sound macroeconomic management.21 The proposed loan will support budgeted \ncountercyclical  programs  and  help  the  government  achieve  a  sound  macro-fiscal  position. \nPayments  of  the  proposed  loan  are  divided  into  two  tranches  of  $500  million  each,  with \ndisbursement conditions for the second tranche based on key policy reforms (para 24). The \ngovernment  has  met  the  access  criteria  for  countercyclical  support:  (i)  significant  adverse \nimpact  of  the  crisis;  (ii)  planned  countercyclical  development  expenditures  to  address  the \nchallenges and protect low-income households; and (iii) sound macroeconomic management, \nincluding a solid fiscal position.  \n \n19.  Reforms will be carried out in cooperation with ADB and other MDBs that will \nprovide financial and technical support. ADB\u2019s proposed loan will complement the World \nBank\u2019s  development  policy  financing;  the  PFA  designed  to  support  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment  strategies;  and  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support  to  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprise development.22 It is in line with ADB support to upper middle-income countries, and \nwith the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in their support to countries affected \nby falling export receipts and tax revenue.23 Lessons from previous loans for countercyclical \n                                                \n18 The Law on Republican Budget, with amendments, as of 11 March 2015. \n19 ADB staff debt sustainability assessment. \n20 The proposed loan for countercyclical support has also considered the IMF Article IV report, August 2014; and the \nstatement from the IMF staff visit, December 2014. \n21 The development policy letter in Appendix 3 confirms the government\u2019s commitments. \n22 ADB. 2013.

", "7 \nsupport implemented by ADB are reflected in this proposed loan through (i) strengthened review \nand  analysis  of  macroeconomic  and  finance  sector  development,  and  (ii)  better  internal \ncoordination and collaboration among ADB departments. Another key lesson is the need for \ngreater ADB institutional readiness and flexibility in responding to crises to ensure relevance of \nADB  support,  especially  for  expenditures  for  social  and  pro-poor  schemes  supported  by \ngovernment policies. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The impact will be sustained pro-poor economic growth. The outcome will be improved \nfiscal sustainability. \n \nC.  Outputs \n21.  The proposed loan will have three outputs: (i) measures to promote non-oil and private \nsector development implemented, (ii) measures to increase employment implemented, and (iii) \npriority expenditures to sustain jobs and social expenditure maintained. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n22.  To meet the budget gap in 2015, the government transferred $13.4 billion equivalent \nfrom the NFRK to the budget. Despite this transfer, the budget deficit is projected at $6.8 billion \nequivalent. The government will finance $4.8 billion equivalent of the budget deficit through the \nissuance of bonds, including from internal sources. The World Bank is expected to provide $1.0 \nbillion in 2015 and $1.0 billion in 2016 through its development policy financing.  \n \n23.  The government has requested ADB to provide a $1 billion loan in 2015 from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  to  support  critical \ncountercyclical expenditures.24 One of the features of the Countercyclical Support Facility, as \nmainstreamed under the 2011 Review of ADB\u2019s Policy-Based Lending, is the ceiling of $500 \nmillion for lending to each country.25 To support the government\u2019s request, it is recommended \nthat the ceiling be waived for this proposed loan. The lending terms are considered appropriate \nwith regards to the government debt repayment capacity and with ADB\u2019s risk-bearing capacity. \nADB\u2019s risk-bearing capacity and the proposed $1 billion loan are considered to be in line with \nADB\u2019s long-term capital adequacy framework.26  \n \n24.  ADB will release the proposed loan in two equal tranches of $500 million. The first \ntranche will be released upon loan effectiveness. ADB management will authorize release of the \nsecond tranche once the government has met the following disbursement conditions: (i) the \nestablishment of a single database for tax and customs administration is approved through an \norder of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), (ii) the establishment of an information system for e-\ndeclaration of customs clearance is approved through an order of the MOF, (iii) a draft law is \nsubmitted to the Parliament to increase attractiveness of investment in the electricity generation \nsubsector. The tariff policy will introduce a feed-in tariff structure based on a fixed component to \ncover capital expenditures and a variable component to cover generation costs; and (iv) a draft \nlaw is submitted to the Parliament to introduce optimized social aid with a targeted approach.27 \n                                                \n24  Compliance status with the access criteria for Countercyclical Support Facility is in Appendix 4. \n25 ADB. 2009.

Borrowing from MDBs reflects a rational \ndebt strategy that minimizes the cost of debt to the budget, subject to the timeliness of cash flow \nto meet budget needs. A further drawdown on the NFRK to stabilize the economy will require \nthe government to amend the rules of operation of the NFRK, which exist to stabilize medium-\nterm  expenditure  plans  and  ensure  long-term  savings  when  oil  resources  are  depleted. \nRepeated  amendments  risk  weakening  Kazakhstan\u2019s  international  investment  position,  as \nNFRK size and management is a key factor in assessing sovereign creditworthiness. Lack of \nMDB support would force the government to access international financial markets when the \ncost  of  borrowing  is  expected  to  increase,  given  the  higher  perceived  risk  suggested  by \navailable market indicators. Lack of MDB support in 2015 will also have negative implications for \nthe debt management strategy, and affect the government\u2019s ability to maintain priority social \nexpenditures during this fragile economic period. The proposed loan will have a 5-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; straight line repayment option with a 10% discount factor; \nan annual interest rate will be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank-offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 200 basis points; a commitment charge of 75 basis \npoints  on  the  undisbursed  loan  balance;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement.28  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  The  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  proposed  loan.  The  implementing \nagencies  will  be  the  Ministry  of  National  Economy,  the  Ministry  of  Healthcare  and  Social \nDevelopment, the Ministry of Energy and the NBK (Table 1). Macroeconomic and financial \nsector conditions will be monitored to determine the impact of countercyclical measures. The \ngovernment will provide annual reports to ADB on (i) macroeconomic and financial sector \nconditions; (ii) expenditures made from the republican budget to support the countercyclical \nmeasures,  as  well  as  the  budget  execution;  and  (iii)  implementation  of  countercyclical \nmeasures, including progress in the implementation of the Nurly Zhol development program, \nand the Employment Roadmap 2020. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2015\u2013December 2016 \nEstimated closing date  31 December 2016 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(ii)  Key implementing agencies  Ministry of National Economy, Ministry of Healthcare and Social Development \nMinistry of Energy, National Bank of Kazakhstan \nDisbursement  The proposed $1 billion loan for countercyclical support will be disbursed in \ntwo tranches: $500 million upon effectiveness and $500 million on completion \nof disbursement conditions in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Governance \n27.  A system of budget preparation and reporting is in place, and monthly budget execution \nreports are available on the MOF website. To enhance budget efficiency and improve fiscal \nsustainability, government agencies have migrated to accrual-based accounting and financial \n                                                \n28 Based on these terms, the average loan maturity is 4.25 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. ", "9 \nreporting  in  line  with  the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards.  In  2013,  the \ngovernment adopted public audits and prepared a draft law on public audit and financial control, \nbut it has not been passed.29 The budget does not cover all fiscal activities. Budget execution \nand accounting procedures are not regularly applied to development programs, especially if \nthey are financed through transfers from the NFRK.30 Revenue collection is consolidated within \none authority to create a favorable climate for businesses and reduce administrative barriers. \nProcurement is decentralized to national and regional bodies, and is executed through the \nelectronic government procurement web portal established in 2008. The Public Procurement \nLaw  was  updated.  Elements  of  e-procurement  were  introduced,  and  public  procurement \nrequirements amended to reflect Eurasian Economic Union requirements. To further align the \nlaw with these requirements, a new amendment for the Public Procurement Law has been \nsubmitted  to  Parliament,  including  new  procurement  mechanisms,  such  as  online  contract \nsigning. It is expected to become effective on 1 January 2016. \n \n28.  A  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  combating  corruption  is  in  place.  The  anti-\ncorruption law, adopted in 1998, defines the core principles underlying the anticorruption effort, \ntypes of corruption crimes, and responsible anticorruption agencies. It supports and protects \nwhistle-blowing. The criminal code criminalizes active and passive bribery, attempted corruption, \nextortion, money laundering, abuse of office, and bribe facilitation by third parties. On 6 August \n2014, the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Fighting Economic and Corruption was \ndissolved, and the function for fighting corruption was transferred to the newly established \nAgency  for  Civil  Service  Affairs  and  Fight  against  Corruption.31 In  December  2014,  the \nAnticorruption Strategy 2015\u20132025 was adopted.32 Kazakhstan joined the ADB\u2013Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development Anticorruption Initiative for Asia\u2013Pacific in May 2002, \nand  the  Istanbul  Anti-corruption  Action  Plan  in  2003.33 It  acceded  to  the  United  Nations \nConvention against Corruption in June 2008. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOF. In October 2013, the \ninternational board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative assigned Kazakhstan the \nstatus of \u201ccompliant country\u201d in observing the international standard of revenue transparency. \nKazakhstan  provides  annual  reports  disclosing  revenues  from  natural  resource  extraction. \nCompanies disclose what they have paid, and the government discloses what it has received.34 \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The proposed loan will help the government (i) meet expenditures for social support and \nservices,  (ii)  maintain  the  confidence  of  international  markets,  (iii)  invest  in  education \nimprovements  and  other  social  infrastructure;  and  (iv)  improve  employment  and  social \nprotection  for  low  income  families.  This  will  enable  more  inclusive  growth  and  economic \ndiversification, with increasing business growth and employment. The gender mainstreaming \ncategory is some gender elements, with women\u2019s employment and social welfare incorporated. \n \n                                                \n29 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2014 Anti-Corruption Reforms in Kazakhstan.

Kazakhstan can be classified \nas a severely affected country. \n \nOil prices dropped 51% from January 2013 to June 2015. As of 10 July 2015, the Brent spot price was \n$58.73. Oil revenue accounts for about 20% of GDP, 50% of total revenues, and 76% of exports. The \nfiscal break-even oil price is $80.00 for 2015 (as of May 2015). This is the oil price at which the fiscal \nbalance is zero. The fiscal deficit of 2.7% in 2014 is projected at 3.0% for 2015. The external break-\neven oil price is $105.30 for 2015 (as of October 2014). This is the oil price at which the current account \nbalance is zero. The current account balance in percent of GDP is projected at -1.0% in 2015 according \nto the Asian Development Outlook (the IMF projects a current account balance in percent of GDP at  \n-4.4% in 2015.) Futures prices indicate a sustained period of low oil prices: $68.30/barrel in 2015 and \n$77.20/barrel in 2022, below the fiscal and external break-even points.  \n \nFollowing the announcement by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation of a transition to a floating \nexchange rate in 2013, the tenge has appreciated 32.1% against the Russian ruble from January 2013 \nto June 2015. Since September 2013, the tenge has been measured against a basket of currencies. \nWhile this helped decrease the effect of the weakening Russian ruble, the depreciation of the ruble \ntriggered a downward adjustment of the tenge\u2013dollar exchange rate in February 2014. At this time, NBK \nreset its exchange rate band for the tenge at T185 \u00b1T3 = $1, from T155 the previous day; equivalent to \na 16.2% downward adjustment of the exchange rate, or a 19.4% rise in the tenge\u2013dollar rate. It has \nsince been reset twice: in September 2014 at an asymmetric band T185 +T3 to T185 -T15 = $1, \nwidening the band to T170\u2013T188; and in July 2015 to T185 +T13 to T185 -T15, widening the band to \nT170\u2013T198 = $1. The tenge has depreciated 20.2% against the dollar, depreciated 17.3% against the \nyuan, and appreciated 26.2% against the ruble from February 2014 to July 2015. Deposit dollarization \n ", "22  Appendix 4 \nCountercyclical  Support  Facility   \nCriteria and Indicators  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nhas increased from 37.4% in 2013 to 52.2% in May 2015. Loan dollarization has remained largely the \nsame at 29.7% as of May 2015. Dollarization can limit the effectiveness of monetary policy, and \nincrease the likelihood of balance sheet and liquidity risks.  \n \nIn  the  long  run,  the  depreciation  of  the  ruble  against  the  tenge  is  weighing  heavily  on  the \ncompetitiveness of Kazakhstan\u2019s non-oil and nonmetal exports, with cheaper imports from the Russian \nFederation outcompeting domestic products. In total, exports declined 7.6% in 2014 and are projected \nto drop by 32.0% in 2015, and be unchanged in 2016. In 2014, exports to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina decreased by 31.7%, to the Netherlands by 11.8%, and to the Russian Federation by 11.9%. \nImports decreased by 14.5% in 2014, and are projected to contract by 10% in 2015 on lower volume \nand declining prices for  goods from the Russian  Federation. In 2013,  imports from the Russian \nFederation decreased by 23.6%, from the People\u2019s Republic of China by 11.9%, and from the United \nStates by 6.4%. \n \nIn addition, (i) inflation increased from 5.8% in 2013 to 6.7% in 2014. In June 2015, year-on-year \ninflation had fallen to 3.9%, below the authorities\u2019 objective target range of 6%\u20138%; (ii) bank lending has \nslowed  from  a  credit  expansion  of  13.4%  in  2013  to  a  credit  contraction  of  1.9%  in  May;  (iii) \nconsumption growth declined from 12.8% in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014 (consumption is a key growth driver); \nand (iv) the budget deficit expanded from 2.0% of GDP in 2013 to 2.7% in 2014, and is projected at \n3.0% of GDP in 2015. \n \n(ii) Kazakhstan is facing significant  The fiscal deficit is expected to expand in 2015 to 3.0% of GDP or $6.8 billion equivalent, and to 2.4% \nfiscal constraints because of the  or $5.8 billion equivalent in 2016. This deficit estimate was calculated after revisions to the budget in \neffects of external developments.  March 2015, when revenues were reduced by 12.9% and expenditures by 4.8%. Slower growth, lower \noil revenues, cuts in export duties, and constrained imports are expected to limit revenue growth to \n14.5% of GDP in 2015 and 13.8% in 2016. Tax income is expected to decrease to 7.4% in 2015 and \nincrease again in 2016 to 10.1%. Expenditure is forecast at 17.5% of GDP in 2015 and 16.2% in 2016. \nPlanned wage increases for 2015 have been postponed. The government increased funding for social \nsupport and services, which comprise 39.1% of budget expenditures, 6.9% of GDP, or $15.3 billion \nequivalent. Expenditures were also increased to support for example financing for agriculture and \nindustry.  In  2013  and  2014,  social  support  and  services  comprised  38.5%  and  37.5%  of  total \nexpenditures respectively. \n \nThe projected deficit suggests that public and publicly guaranteed debt will increase to 17.6% of GDP in \n2015 and to 19.0% in 2016. The revised budget is based on oil price forecasts of $50.00/barrel. This is \nnot sufficient to meet the fiscal break-even oil price\u2014the price of oil at which the fiscal balance is zero\u2014\nof $80/barrel for 2015 (as of May 2015).

The non-oil deficit is expected to increase in 2015, and then fall to a sustainable \nmedium-term rate. Measured on IMF methodology, the non-oil deficit is projected to fall to 8.7% of GDP \nby 2020, which compares to an estimated medium-term sustainable non-oil deficit 5.5% on GDP. (The \nexternal break-even point is about $105.30 for 2015. The external break-even oil price is when the \ncurrent account balance is zero.) \n \nTo meet budget expenditures in 2015, the government transferred $13.4 billion equivalent from the \nNFRK to the budget. Despite this transfer, the budget deficit is projected at $6.8 billion equivalent. The \ngovernment will finance $4.8 billion equivalent of the budget deficit through issuance of bonds and from \ninternal sources, including issuance of government bonds for  internal borrowing from the Unified \nPension Fund and other investors. The government has requested ADB to finance $1 billion in 2015 \nthrough the proposed loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The World Bank is expected to \nprovide  \n$1.0 billion in 2015 and $1.0 billion in 2016 through development policy financing. \n \n(iii) Available market indicators (credit  Based on available information, market indicators suggest a higher perceived credit risk, which is likely \ndefault swap spreads and market- to increase the cost of borrowing.

Increased borrowing on the international debt \nmarket is likely to have negative implications in terms of the debt management strategy. \n \nKazakhstan on 14 July 2015 issued a 10-year dollar denominated bond in the amount of $2.5 billion \nwith a 5.1% coupon and a 30-year dollar denominated bond in the amount of $1.5 billion with a 6.5% \ncoupon. By contrast, a Eurobond was issued in October 2014 in 10-year dollar-denominated bonds \npriced to yield 4.07% and 30-year dollar-denominated bonds priced to yield 5.12%, prices which were \n1.03% and 1.38% lower respectively than the 2015 bonds. \n \n2.

The \ngovernment has also taken steps to attract investment in the non-oil economy. The Framework for \nAttracting  Foreign  and  Domestic  Investment  into  Kazakhstan  presented  in  April  2014  includes  a \npackage of incentives for investors. In May 2015, the Plan for the Nation: 100 Concrete Steps for \nImplementation of Institutional Reforms was approved in response to current global and domestic \nchallenges.

(In 2013 and 2014 social support and \nservices comprised 38.5% and 37.5% of total expenditures respectively.) Budget expenditures for 2015 \nwere also increased to support financing for agriculture and industry.  \n \nIn  2014,  the  government  allocated  about  $10.9  billion  equivalent  from  the  NFRK.  In  2015  total \nallocations will be about $13.4 billion equivalent, and in 2016 about $11.2 billion equivalent. In terms of \nGDP, transfers from the NFRK will increase to 6.0% in 2015 and decline to 4.6% in 2016. The projected \ndeficit of 3.0% of GDP in 2015 and 2.4% in 2016 suggests that public and publicly guaranteed debt will \nincrease to 17.6% of GDP in 2015 and to 19.0% in 2016. \n \nGovernment policies to balance the budget and the NFRK will be aimed at developing a consistent \nmedium-term macro-fiscal framework; increasing the sustainability of the non-oil deficit over the medium \nterm; and reducing the non-oil deficit from 7.7% of GDP in 2014 to 2.8% by 2020. The non-oil deficit is \nexpected to increase in 2015, and then fall to a sustainable medium-term rate. Measured on IMF \nmethodology, the non-oil deficit is projected to fall to 8.7% of GDP by 2020, which compares to an \nestimated medium-term sustainable non-oil deficit 5.5% on GDP.  \n \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nCountercyclical  Support  Facility   \nCriteria and Indicators  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nKazakhstan has established a sound system of budget preparation and reporting. Monthly budget \nexecution reports are available on the website of the Ministry of Finance. To enhance budget efficiency \nand improve fiscal sustainability, government agencies have migrated to accrual-based accounting and \nfinancial reporting in line with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards. In 2013, the \ngovernment adopted public audits in Kazakhstan and prepared a draft law on public audit and financial \ncontrol. However, the pending adoption of the law delays the implementation of relevant audit standards \nand the setup of internal audit units. The budget does not cover all fiscal activity. Budget execution and \naccounting procedures are not regularly  applied  to development programs, especially  if they  are \nfinanced through transfers from the NFRK.

It is projected to fall to 15.0% by 2018 and to 13.9% \nby 2020, driven by rebounding economic growth and shrinking fiscal deficits. A low debt ratio suggests \nthat public debt is sustainable if government assumptions are realized. Assets of the NFRK support the \nconclusion that the outlook is generally benign. The impact of the  proposed loan on public debt \nsustainability is assessed by a scenario that reflects disbursement of an ADB $1 billion loan in 2015, \njointly with expected World Bank loans of $1 billion in 2015 and $1 billion in 2016.c The joint effect \ninitially raises the public debt ratio to 20.2% by 2016, compared with the baseline of 19.0%, then \nconverges to the baseline due to swift amortization and the predominantly benign debt dynamics \nincorporated in the projections.
