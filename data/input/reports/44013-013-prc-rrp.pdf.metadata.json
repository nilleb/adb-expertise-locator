The  project  follows  and  complements  two  previous  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) projects in the province, which have been completed successfully. 2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe PRC\u2019s rapid economic growth and its reliance on coal, which provided about 70% of \nprimary  energy  in  2010,  are  causing  continued  rapid  growth  of  harmful  emissions.3  Coal \ncombustion  releases  large  amount  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  the  main  greenhouse  gas \nresponsible for  causing climate  change.4  Coal  combustion  also  emits  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  and \nnitrogen oxides (NOx), which are the main causes of acid rain, and total suspended particulates, \nwhich  cause  serious  respiratory  diseases.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  has  recognized  the \nenvironmental challenges posed by the rapid increase in coal consumption and has committed \nto achieve a reduction in carbon intensity of 40%\u201345% by 2020, compared with 2005, primarily \nby  targeting  reductions  in  energy  intensity.5  During  the  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan,  2006\u20132010, \nthe energy intensity was reduced by 19.1% compared with a target of 20.0%. The Twelfth Five-\nYear Plan, 2011\u20132015 has set the target of reducing energy intensity by a further 16%, carbon \nintensity  by  17%,  and  emissions  of  SO2  by  8%  and  NOx  by  10%.  Shanxi  province  has  set  a \ncorresponding  target  of  reducing  energy  intensity  by  16%,  carbon  intensity  by  17%,  and \nemissions of SO2 by 11.3% and NOx by 13.9%.6 \n \n4. \nAbout half of the PRC\u2019s CO2 emissions come from the generation of electricity and heat. \nDemand  for  centralized  heating  (or  district  heating)  is  growing  rapidly  along  with  economic \ndevelopment and urbanization. In 2010, the total quantity of heat supplied in the urban areas of \nthe PRC reached 2.9 billion gigajoules and the total area covered by district heating reached 4.4 \nbillion  square  meters  (m2),  compared  with  1.9  billion  m2  in  2003.  Beijing  and  Tianjin \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Project preparatory technical assistance was approved on \n14 December 2010 for $550,000 (ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing \nthe Shanxi Energy Efficiency and Environment Improvement Project. Manila [TA 7736-PRC]). \n\n2  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Shanxi Environment Improvement Project. Manila (Loan \n1715-PRC  and  TA  3325-PRC);  and  ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Coal  Mine  Methane  Development  Project. \nManila (Loan 2146-PRC). \n\n3  The PRC data in this document  were  taken from the National Bureau of Statistics and Shanxi Statistics Bureau, \nunless quoted otherwise. CO2 emissions data were taken from the International Energy Association website while \nthe  other  emissions  data  came  from  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  2011  Annual  Report.  During  the \nEleventh Five-Year Plan period, CO2 emissions increased by 60%; SO2 and NOx emissions rose by 10% and 21%; \nand TSP emissions decreased by 29%. \n\n4  One ton of coal combustion on average releases more than 2.4 tons of CO2. \n5  Carbon  intensity  is  the  amount  of  greenhouse  gas  emitted  per  unit  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  whereas \n\nenergy intensity is the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP. \n\n6  Decree  No.  26:  Circular  of  the  State  Council  on  Issuing  the  Comprehensive  Work  Plan  for  Energy  Conservation \n\nand Emission Reduction during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan period. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nmunicipalities, and 19 provinces in the PRC have adopted district heating. Despite this, district \nheating  in  the  PRC  still  covers  only  30%  of  the  total  floor  area,  compared  with  about  60% \ncoverage in European countries. In the absence of district heating, inefficient and polluting coal-\nbased  household  stoves  and  small  neighborhood  boilers  continue  to  be  widely  used.  The \ngovernment  plans  to  expand  the  coverage  of  district  heating,  which  would  allow  to  close  the \nsmall, inefficient heat-only boilers, and increase the use of energy-efficient combined heat and \npower  (CHP)  plants  as  a  heat  source.  District  heating  also  allows  the  introduction  of \nconsumption-based  billing,  which  enables  consumers  to  regulate  the  amount  of  heat  they \nconsume.  It  avoids  significant  heat  losses  in  the  system,  reinforcing  the  energy  efficiency  of \ndistrict heating. \n \n5. \nShanxi is an underdeveloped inland province in the PRC\u2019s north-central region. It covers \nan  area  of  about  156,300  square  kilometers.  The  heating  season  lasts  for  5  months  and \ntemperatures  can  fall  below  \u201320\u00b0C.  Shanxi\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  in  2010  was \n$4,107  equivalent,  which  is  about  88%  of  the  national  average  ($4,686).  It  ranks  18th  among \nthe PRC\u2019s provinces. Shanxi is well known for its rich coal resources, estimated at about one-\nthird of the PRC\u2019s total coal reserves. In 2011, it produced 870 million tons of coal, about one-\nfourth  of  the  PRC\u2019s  total  coal  production  and  an  increase  of  17.7%  over  2010  production.  It \nfaces serious pollution and environmental problems that are closely related to the mining, use, \nand transport of coal.7 \n \n6. \nThe  underground  coal  mines  in  Shanxi  release  large  amounts  of  methane  during \noperation, commonly referred to as CMM.8 The capture and use of CMM not only helps avoid \nserious  mining  accidents  but  provides  large  environmental  and  climate  change  mitigation \nbenefits.  ADB  supported  a  CMM  project  in  Jincheng,  in  one  of  the  largest  coal  mines  in  the \nprovince  (footnote  2).  It  was  the  first  such  project  in  the  province  that  demonstrated  the  twin \nbenefits of greater coal-mine safety by capturing methane and of utilizing the captured methane \nfor electricity generation and as fuel for household consumption. In 2010, more than 2.8 billion \ncubic  meters  (m3)  of  CMM  was  extracted,  of  which  the  province  utilized  about  0.9 billion  m3 \n(34%),  mainly  for  residential  cooking,  transport,  commercial  and  industrial  use,  and  power \ngeneration.  Its  use  for  district  heating  and  space  cooling  has  been  very  limited.  The  project \nrectifies this by demonstrating CMM utilization for district heating and space cooling in one city. \nIt is also the first ADB initiative to use CMM for such purposes. \n \n7. \nLike in many other provinces, Shanxi's rapid urbanization is fuelling demand for housing \nand  urban  infrastructure.9  Likewise,  strong  economic  growth,  higher  incomes,  and  the \nprivatization  of  housing  are  driving  demand  for  district  heating.  Thus,  Shanxi  has  rapidly \nexpanded its coverage of heat supply, from 71.1 million m2 in 2003 to 287.4 million m2 in 2010\u2014\nan annual growth rate of 21%, much higher than the national average of 12%. \n \nAlthough the high growth rate of Shanxi's heat supply provides significant opportunities \n8. \nfor the private sector, private participation has been relatively slow because (i) initial investment \ncosts are high and financial returns low; (ii) local commercial finance institutions are reluctant to \nprovide  debt  financing,  particularly  in  remote  urban  areas  with  small  markets,  because  of \n\n                                                 \n7  In 2011, about 580 million tons, or about two-thirds of total coal production in Shanxi, were transported outside the \n\nprovince. \n\n8  CMM refers to methane released from the coal and surrounding rock strata during mining. Methane is a nontoxic \ncombustible greenhouse gas, about 21 times more potent than CO2. In underground mines, the methane is drained \nbefore the mining operation can take place to avoid explosions and injuries to miners. \n\n9  ADB extended support to Shanxi\u2019s urban sector development through ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of \nthe  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and  Administration  of  Grant  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina for the Shanxi Small Cities and Towns Development Demonstration Project. Manila (Loan 2606-PRC). \n\n\fperceived  high  risks;  and  (iii) only  a  handful  of  private  companies  have  the  required  technical \nand managerial capacity to operate such utilities, and these tend to focus on large urban areas. \nWhile some of the reforms that will remove most of these barriers are underway, district heating \nas an industry is still not commercially mature and requires public investment to meet growing \ndemand, and thus remains an essential public service in Shanxi. \n \n9. \nDue to the abundance of locally produced coal, district heating in Shanxi relies primarily \non coal as a fuel source. Many of the heating systems in urban areas are old and inefficient and \nlack  proper  emission  control  equipment.  Environmental  impacts  from  these  systems  are \ndisproportionately high on the poor and on women. Urban pollution from small boilers worsens \noutdoor  air  quality  and  causes  significant  cumulative  harm  to  public  health.  Inadequate \ncoverage  of  district  heating  in  low-income  urban  areas  drives  residents  to  use  indoor  coal \nstoves  for  heating,  a  major  cause  of  respiratory  diseases.  Women  and  small  children  are \nparticularly vulnerable to high indoor pollution, as they tend to spend more time indoors. \n \n10. \nThe  project  will  help  solve  the  issues  described  above  by  extending  and  expanding \nenergy-efficient  district  heating  to  more  than  270,000  residents  in  five  highly  polluted  urban \nareas  of  Shanxi.  It  will  replace  small,  inefficient,  and  polluting  inner-city  coal-fired  boilers  and \ncoal-fired household stoves with a highly energy-efficient CHP plant and large heat boilers, and \nwith  CMM  supply,  thereby  reducing  the  overall  environmental  footprints  of  district  heating.10 \nLessons from previous ADB interventions of a similar type were taken into account in the project \ndesign.11 The project has a strong rationale as part of the ongoing energy intensity improvement \nin  the  PRC,  its  Energy  Conservation  Law,  and  its  Energy  Conservation  Ordinance  for  Civil \nConstruction. The project is also in line with ADB's country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nthe  PRC,  and  its  Energy  Policy,  which  prioritizes  energy  efficiency  projects,  including  district \nheating, and promotes access to energy for all. 12 \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  will  be  greater  energy  efficiency  and  a  cleaner  environment  in  Shanxi \n11. \nprovince. The outcome will be better air quality and reduced greenhouse gases emission in five \nurban areas in Shanxi province. \n \nC. \n \n12. \n \nPart  A:  District  heating.  This  consists  of  four  district  heating  subprojects  that  will \n13. \nrehabilitate  2.9  million  m2  of  existing  heating  coverage  and  extend  district  heating  to  another \n3.9 million m2. It will install (i) five large, efficient coal-fired boilers with an aggregate capacity of \n261 megawatt  thermal  (MWt),  which  will  allow  the  closure  of  232  small,  inefficient  coal-fired \nboilers with an aggregate capacity of 340 MWt and of 4,000 household heating stoves with an \naggregate  capacity  of  60  MWt;  (ii)  a  heat  transmission  and  distribution  network  with  100  heat \n\nThe project has three parts as described below: \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n10 Small heat-only boilers operate at 50%\u201360% combustion efficiency compared with 80%\u201390% for new large boilers. \n\nHousehold heating stoves have an even lower combustion efficiency at only 35%\u201340%. \n\n11 Summarized  in  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Energy:  District  Heating  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\n12 ADB.  2012.

Technical  due  diligence  showed \nthat  renewable  sources  of  heat  are  not  feasible  due  to  technical  and/or  financial  limitations. \nWherever feasible, CHP plants and gas-fired boilers are the preferred heat source. A new CHP \nplant  in  Jinzhong,  financed  and  built  by  other  owners,  has  been  selected  as  the  source  for \ndistrict  heating  in  Jinzhong.  The  Liulin  CMM  subproject  will  use  gas-fired  boilers.  For  district \nheating in the cities of Licheng, Qin, and Zhongyang, CHP is not available and large, efficient \ncoal-fired boilers are the only feasible option.17 \n \n22. \nSpecial features. To further boost energy savings and environmental benefits, several \ninnovative technical measures have been adopted for all district heating subprojects: (i) use of \npre-insulated  bonded  pipe  to  reduce  heat  loss,  (ii)  installation  of  state-of-the-art  technology  to \ntrap  fly  ash  and  of  external  flue  gas  desulfurization  devices  to  remove  SO2,  and  (iii)  use  of \nSCADA systems to monitor the operational parameters and prevent heat loss. In addition, the \nJinzhong district heating subproject will (i) install an energy management center to regulate heat \nsupply and demand, reduce water and electricity consumption, and assess the system\u2019s energy \nconservation  potential  and  suggest  options  to  save  energy;  and  (ii)  use  packaged  heat \nexchange stations, which are compact and more energy efficient than traditional heat exchange \nstations.  Successful  operation  of  these  innovative,  energy-saving  measures  under  the  project \ncan be replicated in other places in Shanxi province and the northern PRC. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nEconomic  analyses  of  the  subprojects  indicate  that  the  project  is  economically  viable \nwith economic internal rates of return ranging from 14.4% to 24.6% for part A subprojects, and \n31.3% for the part B subproject, all higher than the 12.0% economic cost of capital. The  of the \nwhole project is 17.9%.18 Financial analyses of the part A subprojects indicate financial internal \nrates of return of between 6.0% and 7.2%, and 19.8% for the part B subproject, all substantially \nhigher than the corresponding weighted average costs of capital.19 The financial internal rate of \nreturn  for  the  whole  project  is  8.2%,  compared  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of \n2.5%.   Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  is  economically  and  financially  viable  under \nvarious adverse scenarios. \n \nC. \n \nThe  financial  management  capacity  of  the  individual  implementing  agencies  has  been \n24. \nassessed and found to be adequate to ensure that loan funds are utilized for intended purposes. \nSome capacity strengthening is needed for the two newly created implementing agencies. The \nimplementing agencies are responsible for undertaking the procurement of goods and services \nwhile  the  PMO  is  responsible  for  reviewing  and  approving  these  procurement  activities.  The \nprocurement  capacity  assessment  indicates  that  the  PMO  has  experienced  staff  and  has \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n17 The technical description of the subprojects is in Appendix 1 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n18 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nprevious experience in administering ADB projects. Among the implementing agencies, only the \nJinzhong  one  has  experience  in  dealing  with  an  international  finance  organization  and  has \nexisting  project  management  teams.  Both  the  PMO  and  the  Jinzhong  implementing  agency \nhave  procedures  and  systems  in  place  to  manage  procurement  that  is  consistent  with  ADB \nrequirements.  The  other  implementing  agencies  have  little  or  no  experience  in  conducting \ninternational  competitive  bidding  and  will  be  trained  in  various  aspects  of  procurement  and \nproject management (para. 15). \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n25. \nwith the government, the Shanxi Provincial Government (SPG), and the implementing agencies. \nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 16). \n \nD. \n \n26. \nAccess  to  reliable  district  heating  and  CMM  supply  will  indirectly  benefit  more  than \n710,000  urban  residents  in  project  districts,  of  which  approximately  4.7%  are  poor.20  Direct \nbeneficiaries  will  be  about  270,000  residents  (83,300  households),  of  which  6.4%  are  poor; \n100,400  children  studying  in  51  schools;  and  patients  and  medical  staff  in  17  hospitals.21  The \nincreased use of CMM and the expanded district heating will reduce the use of raw coal, wood, \nand  coal  briquettes  as  fuels  for  indoor  heating  and  cooking,  and  will  benefit  public  health, \nparticularly  the  health  of  the  poor  and  women,  who  spend  most  of  the  time  indoors.  About \n30,000 households, 2,400 of which are poor, will use CMM for cooking. The poor households, \nincluding  703  headed  by  women,  will  receive  a  70%  heating  tariff  subsidy  from  the  local \ngovernment, under the minimum living standard security program, and have the connection fees \nwaived. By providing cleaner and more reliable heating services, the project will (i) reduce cases \nof  respiratory  diseases  and  carbon  monoxide  poisoning  through  better  quality  of  indoor  and \noutdoor air; (ii) improve living, school, and hospital conditions during winter; (iii) reduce heating \ncosts  by  switching  to  centralized,  energy-efficient  heating  systems;  and  (iv)  create  1,758  full-\ntime  jobs  during  construction  and  942  full-time  jobs  during  operation.  The  local  poor  and \nvulnerable people will have more job opportunities and be given priority in hiring. \n \n27. \nThe  project  will  benefit  339,300  women  indirectly,  and  133,000  women  directly.  The \ncentralized heating system will save women about 1 hour per day of the time spent for attending \nto  heating  needs  during  winter.  Women  will  have  equal  opportunities  for  employment  in \navailable  positions  and  will  be  given  priority  when  hiring  heating  bill  collectors  (at  least  50%). \nAwareness  campaigns  focusing  on  health,  safety,  and  energy  conservation,  and  knowledge-\nsharing  sessions  will  be  organized  with  women\u2019s  federations  in  each  subproject  area,  in \naccordance with the gender action plan.22 \n \n28. \nClosure of 275 small, heat-only boilers will affect 401 boiler workers (80 regular full-time \nemployees  and  321  seasonal  workers  with  contracts  for  a  single  heating  season).  A  labor \nretrenchment plan has been prepared.23 The implementing agencies have agreed to ensure that \nall affected regular employees are reemployed in a timely manner and in accordance with the \nlabor  retrenchment  plan,  and  that  seasonal  workers  will  be  reemployed  where  possible. \nEmployment training will be arranged for all affected workers. \n\n                                                 \n20 Local  residents  who  will  use  the  district  heating  and  CMM  services  provided  by  the  subprojects  are  considered \ndirect beneficiaries, while other local residents, who will not be connected to the system but will benefit from better \nair quality resulting from the project, are considered indirect beneficiaries. \n\n21 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Labor Retrenchment Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nThe  project  has  been  classified  as  environmental  category  B,  involuntary  resettlement \n\n \nE. \n \n29. \ncategory B, and indigenous peoples category C. \n \n30. \nEnvironmental.  The  project  results  in  substantial  environmental  benefits  by  improving \nenergy efficiency and avoiding combustion of 85,390 tons of coal per year, resulting in emission \nreductions of 4,121 tons of SO2, 16,234 tons of total suspended particulates, 1,942 tons of NOx, \nand  254,379  tons  of  CO2.24  The  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  from  the  project \ninclude (i) during construction: noise, soil erosion, and safety risks to community members and \nworkers, including fire and explosion risks posed by working with CMM; (ii) during operation: (a) \ninappropriate handling of waste when decommissioning small boilers; (b) untreated wastewater, \nsolid  and  hazardous  wastes;  (c)  noise  and  air  pollution  from  boiler  stacks  and  from  coal \nhandling, gas emissions and safety risks. The initial environmental examination (IEE) concludes \nthat  the  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  adequately  mitigated  by  measures \noutlined in the IEE, and the project will result in environmental and socioeconomic benefits that \nsignificantly  outweigh  potential  negative  impacts.25  The  project  fully  complies  with  ADB\u2019s \ninformation disclosure and consultation requirements.26 \n \n31. \nSPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  shall  ensure  that  the  project  is  designed, \nconstructed,  and  operated  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  relevant  national  and  local \nenvironmental \nlaws,  regulations,  procedures,  and  guidelines;  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009);  and  the  project  environmental  management  plan  attached  to  the  IEE.  SPG \nwill  ensure  that  the  boilers  constructed  under  the  project  comply  with  PRC  gas  emission \nstandards stipulated in Emission Standard of Air Pollutants for Coal-burning, Oil-burning, Gas-\nfired  Boilers  (GB  13217-2001)27  and  with  the  World  Bank  Group\u2019s  Environmental,  Health,  and \nSafety  Guidelines  for  Thermal  Power  Plants.28  Environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  twice  a  year  during  construction  and  annually  during  operation. Closures  of \nsmall  boilers  will  be  reported  annually.  The  environmental  management  plan  will  be  updated \nduring  the  engineering  design  and  incorporated  in  the  bidding  documents  and  civil  works \ncontracts. \n \nLand  acquisition.  Land  acquisition  under  the  Liulin  CMM  subproject  will  affect  people \n32. \nand a resettlement plan has been prepared.29 The other subprojects entail no land acquisition, \nrestriction in land use, or structure demolition, as they will be implemented on government land \nor existing premises. The CMM subproject will permanently acquire 24.7 mu (a mu is a Chinese \nunit of measurement, e.g., 15 mu = 1 hectare), of which 15 mu is cultivated land and will affect \n17 people  from  four  households.  Of  the  remaining  land,  7.7  mu  is  wasteland  and  2  mu  is \nforestry land and will not affect any people. SPG shall ensure that (i) all land and rights-of-way, \nand counterpart funds are provided in a timely manner; (ii) the resettlement plan is implemented \nin  accordance  with  its  terms  and  that  compensation  and  entitlements  for  affected  peoples  are \n                                                 \n24 The  capture  of  CMM  for  use  in  the  project  will  avoid  its  release  into  the  atmosphere.  This  is  equivalent  to  an \n\nadditional 764,568 tons per year of CO2 emissions. \n\n25 The project IEE was prepared based on domestic environmental assessments for each subproject and supported \nby  site  visits,  stakeholder  consultations,  and  additional  surveys  by  the  environment  specialists  engaged  under \nADB\u2019s project preparatory TA for Shanxi Energy Efficiency and Environment Improvement Project. \n\n26 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  State  Environmental  Protection  Agency.  2001.

The benefits \nand  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 5 and detailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nFuture heating tariff increases may \nbe insufficient to ensure financial \nsustainability of the heating industry. \nProject implementation may be \ndelayed because of (i) delays in the \napproval process, (ii) inadequate \nproject management capacity of the \nPMO, and/or (iii) low institutional \ncapacity and inadequate experience \nof the agencies responsible for \nsubproject implementation. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nEstablished mechanisms for tariff setting are based on full cost recovery \nplus adequate profit. The government is committed to market-based \nheating industry without recourse to subsidies. \nEfforts have been made to avoid delays by incorporating lessons learned \nfrom the implementation of similar loans in other provincesa: \n(i)  Rigorous examination of subprojects and early approval of feasibility \n\nreports and environmental impact assessments should prevent delays. \n\n(ii)  The PMO has gained sufficient experience under two previous ADB \n\nloans. \n\n(iii)  The institutional capacity building component is an integral part of the \nloan to strengthen the capacities of the PMO and the implementing \nagencies. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PMO = project management office. \na  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Energy:  District  Heating  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\nSources: Executing agency and Asian Development Bank.\n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe  government  and  SPG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \n34. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.
