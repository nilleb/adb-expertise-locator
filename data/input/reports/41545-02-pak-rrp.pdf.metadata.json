This will be achieved by reforming public expenditure management \nand  improving  the  business  environment  for  the  private  sector  to  participate  in  infrastructure \ninvestments and service delivery. The program will stimulate economic activity, which will create \nemployment opportunities. Gender mainstreaming at policy and project design levels will ensure \nthat  benefits  accrue  to  both  men  and  women  in  Sindh.  The  program  will  thus  help  reduce \npoverty, starting with rural Sindh.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSindh  has  about  a  quarter  of  Pakistan's  population,  generates  a  third  of  its  gross \ndomestic  product.  Sindh  has  a  strategic  location  for  trade,  entrepreneurial  capacity,  and  a \nvibrant  financial  sector. 1   Sindh  has  a  strategic  location  and  is  relatively  better  off,  with  a \nprovincial  per  capita  income  that  is  37%  higher  than  the  national  average.2 Yet  growth  and \nincome  distribution  have  been  uneven.  While  54%  from  services  (led  by  construction  and \nfinance) of the gross provincial product came from industry and 30% from industry, agriculture \ncontributed  only  15%  during  2002\u20132008.  Half  of  Sindh\u2019s  population  lives  and  is  employed  in \nrural  areas.  However,  budget  allocations  do  not  reflect  this  distribution;  the  government  has \nunderinvested in rural infrastructure.  \n \nResources  are  limited  in  Sindh  and  are  not  used  efficiently.  The  economic  crisis  has \n4. \nconstrained federal support, the security crisis has made investments uncertain, and structural \nweaknesses  in  public  expenditure  management  limit  the  quality  and  geographic  coverage  of \nservices. Despite pressing needs-for transport, energy, water and sanitation infrastructure, and \naccessible,  quality  health  and  education  services-16%  of  Sindh\u2019s  annual  development  budget \nwas  not  used  in  FY2009  due  to  capacity  and  structural  constraints.3 And  without  an  enabling \nlegal  framework  and  the  requisite  institutional  structure,  private  sector's  role  in  infrastructure \nprovision and service delivery has remained limited. \n \n5. \nIn 2008, Sindh developed a multi-sector reform agenda for the program jointly with the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB) 4  to  reduce  urban\u2013rural  disparities,  attract  private  sector \ninvestment, and create fiscal space through public financial management reforms. Subprogram \n1 supported the start-up phase of the reform agenda of the Government of Sindh (GoS), which \nis in line with ADB's country partnership strategy.5 The reforms under subprogram 1 included: (i) \ninitiation  of  policy  work  on  public-private  partnerships  (PPPs)  in  Sindh;  (ii)  establishment  of  a \nPublic  Enterprise  Working  Group  to  assess  public  enterprise  performance,  and  to  develop \nreform  options  for  these  enterprises;  (iii)  rationalization  of  development  budgets  in  line \n\n                                                 \n1  Summary Country Economic Indicators for Pakistan are provided as linked document 6. \n2  Advanced Economic Research Centre. 2010.

Manila. \n\n\fdepartments; (iv) establishment of a Public Accounts Committee in the Provincial Assembly and \nshort-listing of four departments for reducing audit backlogs; (v) establishment of an Employee \nBenefit  Administration  Task  Force  and  adoption  of  an  action  plan  to  better  manage  employee \nbenefits; (vi) identification of rural development priorities and initiating work on  rural investment \nplan;  and  (vi)  improvements  in  primary  health  care  provision  in  rural  areas  through  PPPs  and \nrural empowerment initiatives. \n \n6. \nThe  proposed  subprogram  2  builds  on  and  supports  these  reforms.  GoS  has  taken \nmeasures to: (i) strengthen public financial management for efficient planning and utilization, to \nget  maximum  value  for  money;  (ii)  reform  planning  and  budgeting  processes  and  procedures; \n(iii) implement a rural revitalization and investment plan to improve growth prospects; (iv) create \ninstitutional and regulatory structures to attract private sector investments through public\u2013private \npartnerships,  thereby  generating  fiscal  space;  and  (v)  increase  investments  in  roads  and \ncommunications  to  connect  and  open  up  remote  and  rural  areas  to  markets  and  investors, \nstimulating economic activity and contributing to poverty reduction. The resource requirements \nare significant, however, and Sindh faces fiscal constraints at present. The proceeds of the loan \nwill partly alleviate those constraints, while helping to leverage the proposed reforms. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nSubprogram 2 will promote broad-based growth across the province and spur growth in \n7. \nthe  depressed  rural  economy.  The  program's  long-term  impact  will  be  inclusive  and  balanced \neconomic growth. The main outcome of the program will be improved efficiency and delivery of \nselected services in Sindh, through greater private sector participation, institutionalized gender \nmainstreaming, and adequately provisioned employee benefit management. \n \n8. \nTo  facilitate  robust  and  inclusive  growth,  it  is  necessary  to  increase  rural  incomes  and \ninvestments  in  Sindh.  Poor  seed  quality  and  market  distortions  reduce the  income  of  farmers, \nparticularly  small-scale  growers.  Accordingly,  Sindh  Seed  Corporation  will  be  given  greater \nautonomy through private sector management to improve the supply of certified seeds. Another \nkey  challenge  is  access  to  finance.  With  accurate  and  readily  available  land  titles,  land  can \nconstitute  a  marketable  asset.  Computerization  of  land  records  will  help  generate  definitive \ntitles, which in turn will enable small as well as large farmers' access to commercial credit and \nrural  support  programs.  By  removing  barriers  to  private  sector  investment  in  the  agriculture \nproduce  markets  (APMs)  and  corporatizing  public  APMs,  growers  will  be  able  to  sell  their \nproduce  directly  at  the  best  possible  price.  Kotri,  Larkana,  and  Nooriabad  industrial  estates \nunder  the  Sindh  Industrial  Trading  Estate  Limited  will  be  restructured  to  attract  private \ninvestment  and  help  promote  industrial  activity.  Moreover,  GoS  will  partner  with  the  private \nsector to provide infrastructure, generate employment, and supply better services. \n \nThe lack of adequate health and social welfare services imposes considerable costs that \n9. \nadversely  impact  economic  wellbeing.  PPPs\u2014which  are  currently  in  their  infancy  and  focus \nlargely  on  physical  infrastructure\u2014will  be  diversified  to  provide  basic  health  services  with  the \npublic  sector,  enforcing  minimum  service  delivery  standards  and  monitoring  results  through \ncitizen  satisfaction  surveys.  Public  sector  employees  are  an  important  element  of  service \ndelivery,  but  face  difficulties  in  obtaining  their  employee  benefits,  including  pensions.  Pension \nreforms  will  be  implemented  to  ensure  that  budgetary  provisions  are  adequate,  and \nadministrative reforms will be made to allow timely allocation and payment of benefits. Women \ngenerally  have  limited  representation,  opportunities,  and  access,  and  the  program  will  help \ninstitutionalize  gender  mainstreaming  in  policy  formulation,  project  implementation,  and \nperformance monitoring.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nOutputs \n\nSubprogram 2 will support reforms in three core policy areas (CPAs). Reforms aimed at \n\n10. \npromoting gender equality cut across all these policy areas. \n \n\ni.  Core Policy Area 1: Private Sector Participation in Economic Activities \n\n \n11. \nEnabling  Environment  for  PPPs.  The  private  sector  can  be  a  powerful  ally  of  the \ngovernment  in  infrastructure  development  and  service  delivery.  The  government  recognizes  it \ncannot meet development financing needs alone. PPPs will allow the private sector\u2019s financial \nresources  and  technical  and  managerial  expertise  to  supplement  public  resources,  freeing \ngovernment  resources  for  investment  in  priority  non-infrastructure  sectors  such  as  education, \nhealth,  and  agriculture.  Subprogram  2  will  support  the  development  of  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional frameworks for PPPs.  \n \n12. \nDuring  subprogram  2  period,  a  PPP  law  was  drafted  and  enacted.  A  PPP  policy  was \ndeveloped to provide operational guidance; it incorporates environmental and social safeguards, \nand gender provisions to ensure sound project design and inclusive implementation. The PPP \nand  risk  management  units  were  formed,  and  their  capacity  will  be  developed  systematically \nover the next two years. Guidelines for a project development facility (PDF) and a viability gap \nfund  were  developed  to  support  PPPs.  Current  procurement  rules  were  amended  to  include \nPPPs. \n \n13. \nCommercialization  of  PSEs.  The  private  sector  will  become  a  more  prominent \nstakeholder in managing public sector enterprises (PSEs).  Efficient and financially sustainable \nPSEs can generate revenues and reduce the fiscal burden on the government. To help unlock \nthe  economic  potential  of  PSEs  and  attract  private  investments,  chief  executive  officers  and \nmembers of boards of directors with proven experience in competitive market settings with be \nhired.  Four  PSEs  from  industry  and  agriculture  sectors  were  chosen  as  pilot  cases.  Their \nArticles and Memorandum of Association are being revised to empower the respective boards \nof directors. GoS developed a restructuring policy for the three pilot industrial estates, based on \nthe lessons learned from these pilots. The Sindh Seed Corporation Act 1976 is being revised to \nprovide for private sector-led management in order to improve corporate efficiency and increase \nprovision of certified seed. \n \n\nii.  Core Policy Area 2: Public Expenditure Management  \n \n14. \nEfficiency  of  Investments.  Planning  and  informed  budget  preparation  will  enable \nefficient management of public resources. In order to improve the quality of public investments \nand align public expenditure with policy objectives, the government will roll out the medium-term \nfiscal  framework  (MTFF)  to  all  government  fiscal  operations,  and  adopt  a  medium-term \nbudgetary  framework  (MTBF)  for  Departments  of  Education  and  Irrigation  and  Power  in \nFY2011. The MTBF will be extended to Departments of Agriculture and Livestock, and Fisheries \nduring  FY2012.  A  rural  investment  plan  is  being  developed  to  identify  key  requirements  and \nmobilize resources for rural revitalization. Investments will be prioritized based on development \ntargets  and  resources.  Twice  tokenization  of  projects  in  annual  development  plans  has  been \ndiscontinued.  \n \n15.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Systematic  monitoring  of  results  will  support  informed \npolicy decisions. Effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) against performance standards and \npriorities  improves  the  accountability  of  resource  use  and  service  delivery,  and  can  inform \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fpolicymaking  and  budget  preparation.  During  Subprogram  2  period,  business  process \nreengineering  of \nintroduction  of  a \nthe  government's  M&E  systems  continued  with \ncomprehensive  automated  monitoring  system  (i.e.,  the  Project  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nSystem) and capacity building of M&E staff. The government will have third party evaluation of \nlarge  development  schemes,  and  publish  evaluation  reports  on  its  website  to  improve \ntransparency. To inform policy decisions, the Sindh Bureau of Statistics will be restructured to \ncapture and analyze gender-disaggregated data. \n \nAudit  and  oversight.  Improved  internal  controls,  audit  compliance  and  legislative \n16. \noversight will improve management of scarce resources. Strengthened audit capacity will help in \nimproving  compliance  with  financial  and  accounting  provisions,  thereby  reducing  waste  and \nleakages.  To  improve  internal  controls  for  public  financial  management,  in  line  with  notified \nbudget  ceilings,  an  MTBF  for  FY2011  will  be  adopted.  New  scheme  approvals  for  the  Annual \nDevelopment  Plan  (ADP)  will  precede  budget  deliberations  in  the  Assembly  starting  with \nFY2012.  The  Sindh  Public  Procurement  Regulatory  Authority  (PPRA)  Act  was  enacted,  and \nPPRA rules aimed at greater transparency in public procurement were developed and adopted \nduring subprogram 2. A project feasibility fund has been established to finance feasibility studies \nfor proposed projects to ensure high quality projects when the relevant line department lacks the \nrequisite  capacity.  The  Public  Accounts  Committee  (PAC)  will  provide  timely  legislative \noversight  on  public  investments.  Departmental  Accounts  Committees  (DACs)  will  continue  to \nreduce  audit  backlogs  and  improve  audit  compliance.  Business  processes  in  PAC  will  be \nstreamlined  and  a  customized  management  information  system  (MIS)  adopted,  to:  (i)  improve \nits  capacity,  and  (ii)  ensure  audit  backlogs  are  systematically  cleared  by  DACs.  To  decrease \nbudgetary losses, the government will strengthen its internal control strategy and improve public \nauction rules for moveable assets.  \n\n \n17. \nEmployee Benefits. Improved management of employee benefits will provide adequate \nincome  security  for  civil  servants,  reduce  contingent  liability,  and  create  much  needed  fiscal \nspace.  In  2002,  GoS  began  pre-financing  its  growing  pension  and  general  provident  fund \nliabilities.  With  ADB's  support,  GoS  has  undertaken  actuarial  valuations,  estimating  the \ncontingent  liabilities  of  pensions  and  the  general  provident  fund  for  FY2008  and  FY2009,  to \ninform  policy  decisions.  FY2009  accrued  liabilities  were  reported  and  cost  of  both  schemes \ncalculated  in  line  with  the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standard  (IPSAS)  25.  In \naddition,  Pay  and  Pension  Commission  reviewed  reform  options  and  a  financing  strategy  has \nbeen  prepared  for  the  partial  pre-funding  of  both  pension  and  general  provident  fund  benefit \npayments.  GoS  established  the  Sindh  Fund  Management  House  (SFMH),  which  will  manage \nthese funds to improve transparency and accountability during the investment process.  \n \n18. \nDuring  subprogram  2  period,  an  SFMH  investment  unit  was  established.  GoS  adopted \nan SFMH strategy. An SFMH Bill is being prepared, based on the government's SFMH strategy. \nA reliable recordkeeping system is required to manage the employee benefits effectively and to \nprovide  accurate,  timely  payments.  The  accountant  general  of  Sindh  has  computerized  its \nrecordkeeping  system,  and  all  available  data  were  entered  during  subprogram  2  period.  The \naccountant  general  of  Sindh  has  launched  one-window  facilitation  cells  for  swift  processing  of \npension  applications.  Employee  benefits  package  was  reviewed;  reform  options  for  an \naffordable and sustainable employee benefit system were identified for adoption.  \n \n\niii.  Core Policy Area 3: Rural Economy  \n\n \n19. \nInvestments in Rural Areas. A rural investment plan will identify means of bridging the \nrural\u2013urban economic divide. A sector development plan will be prepared to prioritize areas for \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fshort-,  medium-  and  long-term  interventions.  GoS  will  develop  an  MTBF  aimed  at  rural \nrevitalization  with  Departments  of  Irrigation  and  Power,  Education,  Agriculture,  Livestock  and \nFisheries.  \n \nEntry to and Management of Agriculture Produce Markets. Free entry to markets will \n20. \nenable competition and long-term productivity gains, and ultimately contribute to growth. GoS is \namending the Agriculture Produce Market Act (1939) to remove the exclusive territory protection \nfor APMs established under the act. This will broaden the participant base, increase commercial \nactivity in APMs, and help raise rural incomes. More competitive APMs will become financially \nself-sustainable,  thereby  reducing  the  fiscal  burden.  The  amended  APM  law  will  enable  the \nprivate  sector  to  establish  and  manage  APMs,  and  incorporate  existing  public  APMs  as \ncompanies.  Initially,  all  market  administrators  will  be  removed  and  more  broad-based  market \ncommittees  will  be  appointed.  Seven  of  the  largest  APM  committees  have  already  been \nconstituted.  The  committees  will  oversee  the  transition  to  company  status.  ADB  will  provide \ntechnical assistance to pilot-test the corporatization of three APMs.  \n \nLand  Titles.  Proof  of  land  ownership  allows  farmers  access  to  credit  and  support \n21. \nprograms.  Definitive  land  titles  will  provide  legal  certainty  with  respect  to  land  ownership  and \nconfer rights on farmers, enabling them to access commercial credit, which is a key constraint \nfor farmers in purchasing farm inputs and increasing agricultural outputs. To improve the quality \nand  management  of  land  records,  the  Board  of  Revenue  will  conserve  paper  land  records, \ncomputerize  them,  create  a  geographic  information  system  for  land  management,  and \nrestructure  its  Survey  and  Settlement  Department.  Pilot  testing  of  the  geographic  information \nsystem at taluka level and computerization of land records will start in July 2010 to support the \nmilestones  identified  in  the  rural  investment  plan.  The  Land  Revenue  Act  of  1967  will  be \nreviewed for possible amendments. \n\n \n22. \nBasic  Heath  Care  Provision.  Access  to  adequate  primary  health  care  contributes  to \noverall productivity gains in rural areas. Poor health imposes considerable costs on those least \nable  to  purchase  private  health  care,  adversely  affecting  their  employment  opportunities  and \nincomes. Since resources are limited, innovative solutions are required to finance and provide \nquality health care at the basic health unit (BHU) level. In 2005, the government partnered with \nthe People\u2019s Primary Health Care Initiative to manage the BHUs. During subprogram 2 period, \nthe initiative's management contract has expanded to include 18 of 23 Sindh districts. Service \ndelivery performance can be monitored using measurable and objectively verifiable standards. \nA GoS committee, led by the Health Department, updated and improved the existing minimum \nservice delivery standards. New standards will provide a benchmark for health service provision \nin Sindh. A third-party assessment will be conducted to take stop of beneficiary satisfaction with \nhealth  services  at  BHU  level.  Beneficiary  feedback  and  minimum  service  delivery  standards \nbenchmarks will be used in developing a results-based health sector policy. \n \n\niv. \n\nCrosscutting Reforms Aimed at Promoting Gender Equality \n\n \n23.  Women face challenges in accessing quality health services, employment opportunities, \nand  securing  entitlements.  During  subprogram  2  term,  to  integrate  gender  priorities  and \nresponsiveness  into  policy  decisions  and  project  implementation,  the  Planning  Commission's \ndevelopment project pro forma for concept papers (PC-1) was modified. It now requires gender-\ndisaggregated data on the target beneficiaries and impact of every project in the ADP, with the \ngoal of moving from targeted programs for women to resource allocation that is inherently based \non gender needs.  \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nSupported by the program, GoS also reconstituted the Provincial Development Working \n24. \nParty,6 which now includes the secretary of the WDD as a permanent member, thereby ensuring \ngender-related  policy  inputs  are  incorporated  in  investment  decisions  and  ultimately  the  entire \npublic sector development portfolio. This will encourage equitable budgetary allocations. At the \noperational  level,  GoS  adopted  a  new  coordination  mechanism  (in  its  business  processes) \namong  WDD  and  line  departments.  Sindh\u2019s  accountant  general  and  the  Sindh  Bureau  of \nStatistics will maintain gender disaggregated data to inform policy decisions. Moreover, the PPP \npolicy and PDF guidelines have been drafted. They include clear provisions for addressing any \nadverse project impacts (e.g., loss of livelihoods) on women, and ensure that positive impacts \nstemming from PPP projects (e.g., employment generation) accrue to women as well as men. In \naddition,  the  program\u2019s  technical  assistance  resources  supported  the  Board  of  Revenue  in \ncomputerizing land records (with a gender filter), which will transform land into an undisputable \nand  marketable  asset.  Women  landowners,  including  haris,  will  be  able  to  access  credit  and \nsupport programs using land as collateral, and earn their livelihoods.7   \n \n25. \nAchievements under subprogram 2 will form the foundation of subprogram 3-supported \nreforms  during  July  2010\u2013December  2011.  Under  subprogram  3,  ADB  will  continue  its \npartnership  with  the  government    to:  (i)  develop  a  PPP  pipeline  in  the  transport  sector  and \nstrengthen risk management capacity of GoS; (ii) restructure selected public sector enterprises; \n(iii) rationalize the ADP process; (iv) fully staff and operate SFMH; (v) strengthen the technical \ncapacity  of  agriculture,  industries,  and  women  development  departments,  the  State  Bureau  of \nStatistics, and the M&E cell; and (vi) develop a results-based health sector plan. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nGoS  has  initiated  a  number  of  programs  to  revive  rural  growth  in  Sindh  and  has \ncommitted to increase rural investments in line with MTFF during FY2009\u2013FY2012 period. It has \nalso  allocated  PRs20.7  billion  within  its  ADP  to  targeted  programs  for  rural  development  in \nFY2010  (Table  1)  and  plans  to  allocate  PRs22.5  billion  in  FY2011.  To  meet  its  pension \nliabilities, \ntough \nsocioeconomic challenges, and it is committed to addressing them with well-designed initiatives, \nsuch  as  the  provision  of  land,  technical,  and  financial  support  to  landless  haris,  thus \nincorporating marginalized segments of society into mainstream economic activities.  \n \n27. \nTo  effectively  support  marginalized  groups  and  sustain  inclusive  development,  GoS \nrequires about PRs29 billion ($342.9 million) in FY2011. In order to meet these overall program-\nrelated  requirements  of  GoS\u2014which  otherwise  may  not  be  met\u2014the  Government  of  Pakistan \nhas  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR81,100,000  ($120  million)  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  for  subprogram  2.8 GoS  will  provide  the  remaining  resources. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  term  of  24  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and program agreements. The Government of Pakistan will relend the \nloan  proceeds  to  the  Sindh  government.  The  terms  and  conditions  will  be  the  same  as  those \nextended by ADB to the federal government, including those relating to foreign exchange and \ninterest rate risks. \n \n \n\nthe  government  has  allocated  PRs5  billion \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\nin  FY2010.

The  specific  terms  and  size  of  the  loan  will  be \nconfirmed during the processing of subprogram 3, on the basis of reform progress, requirement \nfor and availability of resources.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n29. \nThe  Sindh  Planning  and  Development  Department,  as  the  executing  agency,  will  be \nresponsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  subprogram  2,  including  coordinating  the \nimplementation  of  policy  actions  by  various  departments,  program  administration, \ndisbursements,  and  the  maintenance  of  program  records.  The  program  management  unit,  set \nup  under  subprogram  1,  will  continue  to  coordinate  day-to-day  implementation  requirements \nand  arrangements.  Finance  Department  will  coordinate  the  activities  of  major  implementing \nagencies  (i.e.,  the  Departments  of  Agriculture,  Livestock  and  Fisheries,  Health,  Industries, \nWorks  and  Services,  Irrigation  and  Power,  Board  of  Revenue).  Subprogram  2  implementation \nperiod is from January 2009 to June 2010. Loan proceeds will be available for subprogram 2 for \nwithdrawal  in  a  single  tranche,  to  be  released  subject  to  conditions  specified  in  the  loan \nagreement.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nsimplified  disbursement  procedures  for  program  loans. 9  The  Governments  of  Pakistan  and \nSindh  will  ensure  that  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds  generated  from  loan  proceeds  for \nsubprogram 2 are used to support reforms in line with the program.  \n \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n30. \nThe  constraints  impeding  economic  growth  in  Sindh  need  to  be  addressed  through \nvarious  instruments.  ADB  has  reviewed  economic  and  financial  performance  of  Sindh, \nespecially the provincial expenditure management and rural development options, and worked \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 1998.

Analytical \nunderpinnings  of  program  design  are  consistent  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund \nassessments for financial viability of the program.11 It will help alleviate policy, institutional, legal \nand regulatory bottlenecks. By so doing, the program will expand the fiscal space of the GoS, \nand attract private sector to commercially viable propositions previously handled by GoS. \n \n31. \nIn  parallel,  ADB  is  also  assisting  Sindh  to  improve  its  water  supply  and  sanitation \nsystems in secondary cities and peri-urban areas. ADB's large-scale transport and power sector \nprojects  are  channelled  through  the  federal  government.  From  an  economic  and  financial  due \ndiligence  point  of  view,  the  proposed  loan  will  leverage  reforms  and  provide  considerable \nbenefits to Sindh, as noted under the three core policy areas.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n32. \nThe program includes regulatory and administrative reforms for fiscal transparency and \npublic  financial  management.  Introduction  of  an  encompassing  MTFF  and  development  of  an \nMTBF will support improvements in planning and budget implementation. Efficient use of fiscal \nresources  is  crucial,  and  requires  effective  fiscal  monitoring  and  control  procedures,  internal \ncontrol  functions,  and  appropriate  procurement  procedures.  Recent  initiatives  by  the  PAC  and \nDACs  have  substantively  reduced  the  outstanding  external  audit  observations.12 The  adoption \nof  the  Sindh  PPRA  Law  and  the  fuller  complement  of  (new  and  revised)  rules  will  support \ntransparency,  consistency  and  accountability \nIn  addition,  a \nprocurement  manual  for  PPPs  will  be  developed.  The  program  will  support  introduction  of \nenterprise resource planning software for accounting and professional off-budget management \nof pension and other contingent liabilities. Service delivery will benefit from greater transparency \nresulting from MIS adoption, public private partnerships, and third party evaluations.  \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  GoS.  And  they  agreed  to  the  provisions  of  the \nprogram on efficient and effective use of loan proceeds, for the reforms in program areas. \n\nin  procurement  practices. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n\n34. \nKarachi, Sindh's capital city, has the highest per capita income in the country, while rural \ninhabitants  are  among  the  country\u2019s  poorest.  Sindh  has  the  highest  incidence  of  absolute \nlandlessness  (62%)  and  the  lowest  share  of  land  ownership  (26%)  in  Pakistan. 13  Wealthy \nlandlords account for less than 1% of all farmers, but hold 60% of all farmland in Sindh. There \nhas  been  no  perceptible  improvement  in  children\u2019s  health  indicators  during  the  last  15  years. \nMaternal and infant mortality rates remain higher than in other countries with comparable levels \nof  development,  and  malnutrition  rates  are  extremely  high.  Fertility  rate  in  Sindh  (4.1  children \nborn per woman) is higher than the national average (3.4), even though Sindh has the highest \nnumber of per capita health care professionals in the country. While access to public services \n\n                                                 \n10  A development coordination matrix is provided as linked document 5. \n11  A  summary  sector  assessment  and  the  IMF  assessment  letter  are  provided  as  linked  documents  2  and  7, \n\nrespectively, to this report. \n\n12 Since December 2008 (subprogram1), audit backlogs for the four departments addressed under this program have \nbeen  systematically  reduced.  Reductions  of  61%  in  Agriculture  Department,  69%  in  Irrigation  and  Power \nDepartment, 58% in Livestock and Fisheries Department, and 89% in Works and Services Department have been \nachieved during subprogram 2 period. PAC and DACs will continue to address the remaining backlog. \n\n13 Government of Pakistan. 2003. Pakistan Agricultural Census 2000.

Under CPA 2, more efficient use and management of public resources will enable (i) \nimproved service provision by the public sector, and (ii) fiscal space for GoS to provide social \nservices. And under its rural revitalization component (CPA 3), the program supports initiatives \nthat  aim  to  address  some  of  these  disparities.  In  the  long  run  the  computerization  of  land \nrecords will allow land titling to be regularized, which is necessary to access agricultural credit \nand  support  schemes,  and  improving  livelihoods  of  the  rural  poor.  Finally,  the  productivity  of \npeople derives in part from their physical well-being. Under subprogram 2, the GoS developed \nnew  minimum  service  delivery  standards,  incorporating  maternal  and  child  health  care  (in  line \nwith Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5) as a benchmark; started assessing current gaps in \nservice delivery via third party evaluation of public and private service providers at basic health \ncare units. These will contribute to preparation of a health sector plan to close these gaps. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n36. \nThe  program  is  categorized  as  category  C  with  respect  to  potential  impacts  on \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples,  and  does  not  trigger  any  of \nADB's safeguard requirements under ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.15  \n \n37. \nProgram design also includes safeguard measures beyond program completion. During \nsubprogram 2 period, a PPP unit was established, but it is not a project financier. The PPP Law \n2010, prepared under the program, requires that project preparation include a feasibility study, \ninitial  environmental  examination,  and  environmental  impact  assessment  in  line  with  industry \ninternational best practices. A PPP policy was drafted to ensure compliance with best practice \nstandards and procedures on environmental and social safeguards.  \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n\n38. \nBenefits from the program may be fully realized only if risks are addressed or mitigated. \nMitigation  measures  have  been  incorporated  into  the  subprogram  2  design. 16  Overall,  the \nintegrated benefits and positive impact of the program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2:   \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nPolitical risks.

They  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \ncovenants  for  the  program,  including  those  on  policy  actions  and  their  continuation,  policy \ndialogue, use of counterpart funds and program implementation, which are set forth in the loan \nagreement  and  program  agreement.  As  part  of  program  reforms,  GoS  has  also  agreed  to  the \nfollowing:  \n\nGoS  shall  prepare,  by  31  October  2010,  a  capacity  development  plan,  with  an \nindicative budget for its implementation, for undertaking environmental and social \nreview and audits of PPP projects. \n\n(ii)  GoS shall adopt a restructuring policy for Kotri, Larkana, and Nooriabad industrial \n\nestates by 30 July 2010. \n\n(iii)  GoS  shall  refine  it  financing  strategy  for  pension  and  general  provident  fund  to \nprovide for long-term targets in line with actuarial estimates for FY2011 onwards, \nand approve it by 31 December 2010. \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n41. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR81,100,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 2 of \nthe Sindh Growth and  Rural Revitalization Program from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter;
