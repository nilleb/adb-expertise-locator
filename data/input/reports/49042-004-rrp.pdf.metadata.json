Tajikistan  is  a  landlocked\n3.\nmountainous country in Central Asia bordered by Afghanistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China,\nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan.  Despite  its  strategic  location,  the  country  has  a  gross \ndomestic  product  per  capita  of  just  $1,037,  and  35%  of  the  population  still  lived  below  the \npoverty line in 2013. Almost 70% of the population lives in rural areas, in a largely mountainous \nterritory (90%), where only 10% of the land is suitable for cultivation. Tajikistan heavily depends \non transport corridors to support investment, job creation, trade, and ultimately economic growth \nand poverty reduction. The road transport sector suffers from low quality, long travel times, and \npoor  reliability,  which  hinder  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth.  Four  CAREC  regional  corridors\n(2, 3, 5, and 6) cross parts of Tajikistan, offering a great opportunity for Tajikistan to enhance its \nconnectivity and trade competitiveness.  \n\nInadequate  road  connectivity,  efficiency,  and  safety.  The  27,000  kilometers  (km)\n4.\nroad network was largely constructed before the 1970s, and the rapid increase of traffic in some \narterial  roads  is  intensifying  pressure  on  aging  transport  infrastructure.  Tajikistan  has  limited \nlinks to neighboring countries, especially Afghanistan and the People\u2019s Republic of China. The\noverall  condition  of  the  road  network  is  relatively  poor,  which  is  due  in  part  to  the  initial  poor \ndesign  and  quality  of  construction,  as  well  as  inadequate  subsequent  maintenance  of \npavements  and  structures.  Funding  for  routine  and  periodic  road  maintenance  has  increased \nsteadily from TJS30.3 million in 2009 to TJS60.5 million in 2016. Yet, there is a funding gap to \nmeet  network  maintenance  needs.  The  lack  of  a  road  asset  management  system  compounds \nthe  problem,  thus the  need  to  optimize  the  allocation  of  funds  based  on  needs  and  functions. \nThe road safety record in Tajikistan is dismal despite its low level of vehicle ownership (about 50 \nvehicles  per  1,000  people).  The  World  Health  Organization  estimates  that  there  were  1,543 \nfatalities in 2013, which corresponds to 18.8 fatalities per 100,000 people. The transport system \nneeds  to  be  planned  and  operated  to  reduce  road  safety  crashes.  A  better  road  asset \nmanagement  is  needed  to  maintain  the  network  in  good  serviceable  condition  and  provide  a \n\n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n3 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the CAREC Corridors 2, \n\n5, and 6 Road (Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa) Project (TA 8945-TAJ).\n\n\f2 \n\nreliable  service  throughout  the  year  to  support  Tajikistan\u2019s  internal  and  external  trade\ncompetitiveness. \n\n5.\nRoad  sector  achievements  and  lessons.  The  road  network  under  MOT  jurisdiction\ntotals 13,968 km, comprising 3,178 km of international roads (23%), 2,120 km of national roads \n(15%), and 8,670 km of local roads (62%). The backbone of Tajikistan\u2019s national road network\nhas been largely improved with assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment  partners.4 ADB  investments  in  the  transport  sector  improved  about  810  km  of \nCAREC  roads  and  350  km  of  rural  roads,  introduced  pilot  projects  on  performance-based \nmaintenance,  raised  awareness  regarding  road  safety,  and  reduced  cross-border  barriers. \nLessons from previous projects were incorporated into the design of this project, including giving \nspecific attention to project readiness, and developing systems and capacity regarding financial \nmanagement, road safety, and road asset management. \n\n6.\nGovernment  sector  strategy  and  plans.  The  development  of  the  transport  sector  is\nguided  by  the  government\u2019s  National  Development  Strategy  and  the  Transport  Sector  Master\nPlan,5 and  implemented  through  the  State  Program  on  Transport  Sector  Development,  2010\u2013\n2025.  The  Transport  Sector  Master  Plan,  developed  with  ADB  assistance,  is  the  basis  for  the \ngovernment\u2019s strategic sector planning; as such it provides a framework for coordination among\ngovernment  bodies  and  development  partners.  The  State  Program  on  Transport  Sector \nDevelopment  includes  a  list  of  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  investments  that  is  regularly \nreviewed and updated. The size of the ADB transport sector program, coupled with its leading \nrole  in  the  CAREC  transport  program,  has  positioned  ADB  to  successfully  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s sector strategies, policies, and plans.\n\n7.\nProgressive  improvement  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa  road.  The  government\nhas  requested  ADB  assistance  to  improve  portions  of  CAREC  corridors  2,  5,  and  6  by \nupgrading  the  82  km  Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa  road,  for  which  ADB  has  programmed  two\nprojects  in  2016  and  2018  as  presented  in  the  Tajikistan  country  operations  business  plan, \n2016\u20132018.6 The project road passes through terrain that varies from flat to mountainous, and\nconnects  Dushanbe  to Afghanistan.  The first  project  will  focus  on  improving  an  approximately \n33  km  section  of  the  road  from  Dushanbe  to  Chashmasoron,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  the \nproject  road.  Financing  of  the  second  project,  from  Chashmasoron  to  Kurgonteppa,  may  be \nconsidered through additional financing subject to satisfactory progress on the first project. \n\n8.\nImproving the road is a government priority, as reflected by its inclusion in the National\nDevelopment  Strategy,  and  its  consistency  with  the  ADB  country  partnership  strategy.7 The \nproject  is  also  consistent  with the  CAREC Transport  and Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  2020  and \nwill contribute to achieving goals 3 (good health and well-being) and 9 (industry, innovation, and \ninfrastructure) of the Sustainable Development Goals.8  \n\n9.\nThe  project  area.  Dushanbe  is  the  capital  and  largest  city  in  Tajikistan,  with  775,000\nresidents. Kurgonteppa is the capital of the Khatlon region and the third-largest city in Tajikistan, \nwith a population of about 100,000. Kurgonteppa is home to a number of industrial enterprises, \n\n4 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5 Government of Tajikistan. 2007.

Except  for  a  3.4  km  section  immediately  south  of \nDushanbe, the project road has two lanes, with few safety features. It could serve as a powerful \nengine  for  regional  integration  and  inclusive  economic  growth,  but  this  potential  is  limited  by \nthree  factors:  road  capacity,  condition,  and  safety.  In  addition,  during  the  winter  season  when \nglacial  melt  is  at  its  lowest  and  energy  demand  the  highest,  villages  and  facilities  along  the \nproject  area  experience  frequent  energy  cuts,  which  affect  road  safety,  restrict  economic \nactivities, and increase domestic hardship, especially for women. \n\nTransforming  local  challenges  into  national  opportunities. The  project  will  support\n10.\nthe government\u2019s program to progressively improve the road by (i) expanding its width from two \nto  four  lanes  to  address  impending  capacity  constraints,  (ii)  improving  its  surface  condition \nthrough  construction  of  a  new  pavement,  and  (iii)  providing  well-designed  safety  facilities  to \naddress existing road safety deficiencies. The project will introduce clean energy technologies\u2014\nsuch as solar street lighting and solar-based backup systems\u2014to enhance power reliability and\nefficiency along the project road. This will contribute to improved living standards in the villages \nalong the project road, and to reduced carbon dioxide emissions. \n\n11.\nThe  project  will  also  develop  guidelines  on  safe  arterial  road  design  and  initiate  the\ndevelopment  of  a  tailored  road  asset  management  system,  with  a  view  to  incrementally \nstrengthening  MOT  capacity  in  these  areas.  This  approach  will  support  a  continued  policy \ndialogue  that  will  run  parallel  with  progressive  improvement  of  the  road,  and  will  be  closely \ncoordinated with other development partners active in the transport sector. \n\nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\n12.\nThe project will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) the strategic pillar on promotion\nof economic growth of the Tajikistan National Development Strategy, and (ii) CAREC\u2019s strategic \ngoal  of  establishing  competitive  corridors  across  the  CAREC  region.  The  outcome  will  be \nimproved  efficiency  and  safer  movement  of  goods  and  people  on  selected  sections  of  the \nDushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa road.\n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13.\nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  improved  road  conditions, facilities,  and  safety  along,  and  in the\nvicinity  of,  the  project  road  (33  km); 9 (ii)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  of  MOT  regarding \nfinancial  management,  road  safety,  and  road  asset  management;  and  (iii)  completed \nprocurement readiness for the next section of the road to be improved, from Chashmasoron to \nKurgonteppa. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n14.\n\nThe project is estimated to cost $96.4 million (Table 1).\n\n9 Includes  provision  of  road  signs,  pedestrian  crossings,  road  lighting,  livestock  underpasses,  bus  stops,  and \n\nimprovement of rest areas and road bazaars. \n\n\f4 \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the financing agreements. \n\n16.\nThe  government  has  also  requested  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development\n(OFID) to provide a loan of $12 million, which will finance exclusively a part of the civil works of \nthe project road. The OFID loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nand an interest rate of 2.75% per annum  inclusive of a 1.00% service charge. ADB and OFID \nwill  cofinance  the  civil  works  of  the  project  as  collaborative  cofinancing.  ADB  will  not  be \nadministering  the  OFID  loan  and  each  cofinancier  will  manage,  in  close  coordination,  its  own \npro rata share of disbursements for civil works-related payments. \n\n17.\nIn addition, the CEF (footnote 2) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility\nwill provide grant cofinancing equivalent to  $2 million, to be administered by ADB, to integrate \nclean energy  and  energy  efficiency  technologies for  street  lighting and  power  backup systems \nfor  communities  living  adjacent  to  the  project  road.  This  grant  will  also  finance  lighting \nimprovement  in  the  Ozodi  tunnel  on  the  Dushanbe\u2013Dangara  road  to  ensure  that  lighting  is\navailable on a 24-hour basis. ADB will fully administer the CEF grant on a parallel cofinancing \nbasis.

Some  sections  of  the \nroad  that  were  reconstructed  under  a  previous  ADB  project  have  the  lowest  IRI,  about  4  on \naverage.12 Overall, the road pavement requires improvement, either immediately or in the near \nto medium term, due to the emergence of cracking and potholes and damage to structures and \ndrainage  systems.  The  road  also  has  a  poor  safety  record,  with  a  high  concentration  of \naccidents in the more heavily trafficked sections adjacent to Dushanbe and Kurgonteppa. \n\n23.\nThe  completed road  will  have  two carriageways,  each  with two traffic  lanes 3.5 meters\nwide,  separated  by  a  median  typically  3.0  meters  wide  in  rural  areas  and  narrower  where  the \nroad  passes  through  villages  and  difficult  mountain  terrain.  This  complies  with  the  Tajikistan \nstandard for roads of this category, and with Asian Highway standards. Since the existing two-\nlane  road  will  reach  capacity  within  5  years,  the  proposed  double  carriageway  four-lane \nconfiguration  is  appropriate.  The  project  road  alignment  will  follow  the  existing  road  alignment \nbecause  of  terrain  considerations  and  to  minimize  land  acquisition,  with  some  adjustments  to \nhorizontal  and  vertical  alignments  to  meet  the  required  standards.  The  design  speed  will \ntypically be 100 km per hour, which is appropriate for a road of this class in the terrain through \nwhich it passes. \n\n24.\nThe  completed  road  will  have  a  flexible  pavement  with  asphaltic  concrete  surfacing\n(average  IRI  of  2).  The  pavement  structure  has  been  designed  using  appropriate  design \nmethods  based  on  the  traffic  projected  to  use  the  road  over  a  20-year  period  (2021\u20132040)\nfollowing  project  completion,  assuming  two  asphaltic  concrete  overlays  during  this  period  to \nprovide the additional strength required for traffic loading for the latter part of the road\u2019s service \nlife.  The  road  design  takes  into  account  the  severe  weather  conditions  that  the  road  will \nexperience,  which  range  from  high  temperatures  in  summer  to  below  freezing  with  heavy \nsnowfall  in  winter.  Relevant  disaster  risks  and  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation \n\n12 ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n\n\f7 \n\nmeasures have also been factored into the design (drainage structures, slope stability, and solar \nstreet lighting). \n\n25.\nThe road design meets internationally accepted standards and practices in terms of road\nsafety.  The  design  will  be  subjected  to  detailed  road  safety  audits  before  construction \ncommences, during construction, and prior to final acceptance of the completed road. The road \ndesign  also  reflects  consultations  with  communities  living  adjacent  to  the  road,  as  a  result  of \nwhich  several  underpasses  for  people,  livestock,  and  agriculture;  pedestrian  crossings  with \nappropriate warning devices; and other community-relevant facilities will be provided. \n\n26.\nThis technical due diligence has confirmed that the project\u2019s technical design, alignment,\ncross-section, drainage structures, pavements, and road safety are appropriate for a road in this \nlocation, and for the volume of traffic that is projected to use it. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  viability.  The economic  evaluation  of the  project  was undertaken  using the\n27.\nhighway development and management model, and following ADB guidelines.13 For the purpose \nof  the  economic  analysis,  the  with-project  scenario  assumed  the  improvement  of  the  33.2  km \nDushanbe\u2013Chashmasoron road section. Without the project, the road is expected to deteriorate\nto  an  average  IRI  value  of  16  within  15  years,  rendering  it  unmaintainable.  Future  traffic  was \nestimated  based  on  classified  traffic  counts  conducted  in  2016,  and  available  gross  domestic \nproduct  growth  forecasts.  The  project  is  economically  viable  with  an  estimated  economic \ninternal rate of return of 23.5%, with a net present value of $90 million at a 12.0% discount rate. \nThe principal quantifiable benefits are reduced vehicle operating costs, reduced travel time, and \nreduced maintenance costs. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the economic viability of the project \nis robust against project cost increases of up to 187%, and decreases in vehicle operating costs \nsavings of up to 71%. \n\n28.\nFinancial  sustainability.  The  project  is  non-revenue  generating.  The  design  of  the\nproject road pavement and structures has been carefully developed with a view to ensuring the \nroad\u2019s long-term sustainability. The project will initiate the development of a tailored road asset\nmanagement system in close coordination with other development partners (e.g., the European \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  the \nWorld  Bank),  all  of  which  have  operations  that  involve  some  forms  of  operation  and \nmaintenance. The government is committed to maintaining the project road and facilities at the \nrequired standard as reflected in the financing agreement. The financial analysis concluded that \nMOT  has  sufficient  financial  capacity,  within  the  government\u2019s  budgetary  procedures,  to  meet\nrecurrent expenditures to operate and maintain the project road in a sustainable manner. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n29.\nFinancial management. The financial management assessment (FMA) was undertaken\nin  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines  regarding  project  financial  management  (footnote  13)  and \nfinancial  due  diligence.14 The  FMA  considered  the  PIURR\u2019s  capacity  with  regard  to  funds-flow\narrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information \nsystems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  The  MOT  and  PIURR  will  maintain \n\n13 Economic  and  Financial  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2);  and  ADB.  2005. \n\nGuidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

The  FMA  concluded  that  the  overall  financial  management  risk  of  the \nimplementing agency is substantial. \n\nProcurement.  The  MOT  and  PIURR  have  an  adequate  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s\n30.\nprocurement  and  financial  management  policies  and  procedures  as  a  result  of  the  sizable \nportfolio  of  ADB-supported  operations  in  Tajikistan.  A  procurement  risk  assessment  was \nundertaken  and  considered  the  PIURR\u2019s  capacity  with  regard  to  organization  and  staffing,\nresolution \ninformation  management,  procurement  practices,  complaints  and  dispute \nmechanisms,  and  accountability  measures.  The  assessment  concluded  that  the  overall \nprocurement management risk of the implementing agency is low to moderate. \n\nThe PMCSC team includes an international financial management specialist, a national\n31.\nfinancial management specialist, and an international procurement specialist, who will assist the \nPIURR in implementing key actions and measures to address the deficiencies identified in the \nFMA and procurement risk assessment. \n\nADB\u2019s  Integrity  Principles  and  Guidelines15 and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as\n32.\namended  to  date)  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  the  MOT,  and  the \nPIURR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the \nPAM (footnote 11). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe project will directly benefit residents in Dushanbe and 19 villages located along the\n33.\nproject  road  by  improving  access  to  jobs,  markets,  and  public  services  while  reducing  the \nlikelihood  and  severity  of  road  collisions.  The  project  will  also  enhance  the  reliability  and \nefficiency  of  power  solutions  along  the  project  road  by  introducing  solar-based  street  lighting \nand backup systems for communities living adjacent to the project road. Socioeconomic surveys \nwere  carried  out  for  project  preparation  and  a  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy \nwas prepared.16 \n\nThe  gender  categorization  of  the  project  is  some  gender  elements.  The  project  design\n34.\nwill address some of the factors that inhibit female mobility by increasing safety features (road \nsigns and street lighting), enhancing connectivity of villages (pedestrian crossings and livestock \nunderpasses),  constructing  bus  stops,  improving  rest  areas  and  road  bazaars,  and  promoting \nconfidence  in  the  new  road  configuration  through  road  safety-awareness  training  and \nworkshops. The MOT and PIURR will take all necessary actions to encourage women living in \nthe  project  area  to  participate  in  planning  and  implementing  project  activities  following  the \nprinciples of the ADB Policy on Gender and Development (1998). \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n35.\nResettlement. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement impacts.\nDue to the linear design and limited number of agricultural plots located along the project road, \nthe  impacts  will  not  be  significant.  The census carried  out  during  project  preparation  identified \napproximately 74 affected households\u2014including private agriculture plots, owners and users of\nland  and  buildings,  business  owners,  renters,  and  employees\u2014with  609  household  members\n\n15 ADB. 2015.

Only six land plots will lose more than 10% of their area. One residential building and \nfour main business buildings will be permanently impacted. A land acquisition and resettlement \nplan (LARP) has been prepared to mitigate and address all the associated losses in accordance \nwith the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and relevant national legislation.17 The LARP \nwas disclosed on the ADB website in August 2016. Consultations with the project stakeholders \nand  displaced  persons  were  undertaken  in  the  course  of  LARP  preparation,  and  will  continue \nthroughout  implementation.  If  modification  of  the  LARP  is  required,  or  additional  land \nrequirement  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  identified,  the  LARP  will  be  updated  in \nfurther \naccordance  with  applicable \nimplementation.  All  displaced  people  will  receive  compensation  in  accordance  with  the  LARP \nprovisions. The land will be made free of encumbrances in sections prior to commencement of \nconstruction. A grievance redress mechanism is in place in accordance with the LARP to assist \naffected  persons  in  resolving  grievances  and  complaints.  The  MOT  will  submit  semiannual \nsafeguards monitoring reports to ADB for review and disclosure. \n\nlaws,  and  ADB  approval  obtained  prior \n\nto  any \n\ninvolved  people \n\n36.\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  category B for  environmental  impacts.  An  initial\nenvironmental examination and an environmental management plan (EMP) have been prepared \nfor the project and were disclosed on the ADB website in August 2016, in accordance with the \nADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. 18  Public  consultations  were  conducted  during  initial \nenvironmental  examination  preparation,  and \nroadside  villages, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  other  project  stakeholders.  The  environmental  assessment \nestablished that the project will have site-specific environmental impacts related to air and water \npollution,  noise  and  vibration,  soil  erosion,  loss  of  roadside  trees,  relocation  of  utilities,  and \ntraffic  disruption  during  the  construction  stage.  Additionally,  it  was found that  the  project  could \nresult  in  split  communities,  disruption  of  farming  patterns,  and  loss  of  access  to  roadside \nbusinesses  during  operation.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in,  and  will  be \nimplemented  through,  the  EMP.  The  project  design  incorporates  measures  for  preserving \ncommunity cohesion such as improved road crossings, access to public facilities, and access of \nagricultural  machinery  to  fields  and  livestock  to  pastures.  The  cost  for  implementing  the  EMP \nwill  be  financed  by  the  project  through  the  civil  works  contract  (mitigation  measures)  and  the \nPMCSC\u2019s contract (environmental monitoring).\n\nfrom \n\nIndigenous  peoples.  There  are  no  indigenous  peoples,  as  defined  in  the  ADB\n37.\nSafeguard Policy Statement, in the project area, and thus the project is classified category C for \nindigenous peoples impacts. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38.\nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail\nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 19  The  project  risks  are  considered \nmanageable  through  the  prescribed  mitigating  measures.
