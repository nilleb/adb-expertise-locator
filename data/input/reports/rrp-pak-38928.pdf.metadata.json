If approved, the Project will be the \nfirst  private  hydroelectric  (hydel)  power  generation  project  in  Pakistan  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  via  its  private  sector  operations.  It  will  also  be  the  first  private  sector \ncofinancing between ADB and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). \n \n\n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nLaraib, which was formed in August 1995 by a group of private investors, applied for and \n2. \nreceived  a  letter  of  interest  to  develop  the  Project,  under  a  build-own-operate-transfer  public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  scheme,  and  to  carry  out  a  feasibility  study.  Laraib  was  issued  a  letter  of \nsupport  on  18  May  1996  allowing  it  to  develop  the  Project,  negotiate  a  tariff  with  the  Pakistan \nWater  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  and  proceed  to  finance,  build,  and  operate \nthe Project.  Following  delays largely attributable to the  economic  downturn and to  disputes  with \nthermal independent power producers (IPPs) in the late 1990s, the company has recently signed \nproject  agreements  with  the  Government  of  Pakistan,  the  government  of  Azad  Jammu  and \nKashmir  (GOAJK),  and  their  relevant  power  sector  entities,  including  agreements  pertaining  to \nwater use, power purchase, and government approvals and undertakings. \n \n3. \nThe  situation  in  the  power  sector  in  Pakistan  has  improved  markedly  over  the  last  few \nyears,  and  it  is  today  deemed  an  attractive  sector  for  investment  by  both  local  and  overseas \nsources. This can be attributed to the resolution of disputes between WAPDA, the Government, \nand the IPPs; continued efforts at sector reform; a dramatic reversal of the capacity oversupply \nprevalent  in  the  mid  to  late  1990s;  and  very  robust  economic  growth.  This  turnaround  is \nevidenced by the proposed new IPP development, proposed expansions of existing IPPs, and \nIPP  refinancing  activity.  Private  hydel  development  is  particularly  encouraged  today  as  it  will \nadd  much-needed  generation  capacity  in  an  environmentally  acceptable  way,  rebalance  the \nhydro/thermal  generation  mix  (all  current  IPP  generation  is  thermal),  and  exploit  indigenous \nrenewable resources, all of which are consistent with the Government\u2019s power sector policies. \nPakistan has a strong comparative advantage in hydel power generation, and the Project should \nhelp  the  country  to  realize  that  advantage  within  the  private  sector.  The  Project,  being  at  an \nadvanced  stage  of  development  and  already  specifically  featured  in  WAPDA\u2019s  least-cost \nGeneration Expansion Plan, merits ADB\u2019s particular support. \n \n4. \nThe Project is at an advanced stage of development with its contractual structure largely in \nplace.  The  Project\u2019s  original  developers  have  now  attracted  a  major  international  corporate \ninvestor in the form of Ranhill Berhad of Malaysia to cosponsor the Project, demonstrating that the \nclimate  for  private  sector  investment  generally,  and  for  private  power  development  particularly, \nand for private hydel projects specifically, has vastly improved. The conditions are now felt to be \nhighly supportive for realizing this landmark transaction.  \n \n5. \nThe financing of the Project is being closely coordinated with IDB, and it is expected that \nADB and IDB will lead the financing with similar participation (up to $37.3 million each). This will \nbe  IDB\u2019s  first  private  sector  project  financing  in  Pakistan,  and  it  will  be  the  first  private  sector \ncofinancing between ADB and IDB.  \n \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\nThe Project is also in line with ADB\u2019s policy for the energy sector in Pakistan1 where the \n6. \nfocus is on structural reform, privatization, cleaner fuels, and renewable energy, as well as with \nADB\u2019s  multisector  rehabilitation  and  improvement  project  for  AJ&K,2  which  has  an  important \npower sector component. The Project will help to strengthen the role of NTDC within the power \nsector (a role that ADB has strongly supported3), as well as help to stabilize the power network \nby  building  generation  in  the  north  of  the  country.  The  Project  may  also  encourage  the \ndevelopment  of  the  market  for  certified  emissions  reduction  credits.  The  central  and  local \ngovernments have confirmed both their support for the Project and for ADB\u2019s participation.  \n \n7. \nSubstantial due diligence has been undertaken, and ADB has been heavily involved in \nstructuring this transaction.  The Fact-Finding and Initial Due Diligence Mission was fielded from \n17  to  18  February  2004,  and  the  Project  received  concept clearance  on  6  October  2004.  The \nmain  Appraisal  Mission  was  fielded  during  the  last  week  of  November  2004.  In  addition,  the \nADB  project  team  joined  an  IDB-led  due  diligence  mission  and  has  participated  in  numerous \nsubsequent due diligence and negotiation missions to Pakistan and Malaysia. \n \n \n\nIII.  BACKGROUND \n\nA. \n \n\nThe Power Sector in Pakistan  \n\n1. \n\nDemand and Supply \n\n8. \nPakistan\u2019s  electricity  consumption  increased  at  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  of \n4.84% from 1999 to 2003, with faster rates of growth registered among certain classes of users \nsuch  as  domestic,  commercial,  and  industrial.  Future  electricity  consumption  is  expected  to \nexceed recent economic growth rates of about 6%, with WAPDA registering unit sales growth of \n8.6%  in  2004.  Strong  economic  growth  is  also  expected  to  contribute  to  greater  levels  of  per \nannum  per  capita  consumption  of  electricity  (413  kilowatt-hours  [kWh]  compared  to  the \nPhilippines\u2019 497 kWh and Thailand\u2019s 1,414 kWh) and thus magnify demand growth. This growth \nin demand has essentially erased a significant capacity overhang to the point where, today, load \nshedding  and  other  adverse  economic  impacts  of  declining  reserve  margins  relative  to  peak \ndemand are becoming pronounced. WAPDA shed 676 gigawatt-hours (GWh) from July 2003 to \nJune  2004,  slightly  more  than  the  annual  generation  of  426  GWh  expected  from  the  Project. \nThe  situation  is  not  helped  by  significant  levels  of  technical  and  non-technical  losses  and  the \nlack  of  recent  sizable  investment  in  generation  and  transmission  and  distribution  systems  to \nmeet  expected  demand  (notwithstanding  the  recent  completion  of  the  Ghazi  Barotha \nHydropower Project). \n \n9. \nTotal  installed  power  generating  capacity  in  Pakistan  amounts  to  19,252  megawatts \n(MW), of which 11,196 MW is provided by WAPDA (58.1%), 5,808 MW by IPPs (30.2%), 1,756 \nMW  by  KESC  (9.1%)  and  30  MW  by  AJ&K  Hydel  (0.2%),  the  remainder  being  government \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2002.

Manila \n(TA No. 4635- PAK). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nowned  nuclear  (462  MW  or  2.4%).    Hydroelectric  generation  capacity  represents  about  6,491 \nMW, or 34% of total installed generation capacity. \n \n10. \nThermal  generation  (excluding  nuclear)  is  fueled  by  oil  (24%),  natural  gas  (75%),  and \ncoal (under 1%).  Hydel generation, which is currently all in the public sector, represents about \n34% of the existing generation capacity, but that capacity of approximately 6,491 MW uses less \nthan 20% of the estimated hydropower resources of the country. In addition, hydel generation \nhas declined relative to total generation as the large capacity additions in the mid to late 1990s \nwere  all  oil  and  gas  fired  IPPs.  This  trend  is  considered  unfavorable  by  the  Government  and \nWAPDA, which prefer a more balanced thermal/hydro generation mix. Other considerations are \ncost  and  environmental  issues  and  benefits  specific  to  hydel.  Like  other  Himalayan  countries, \nPakistan has a significant comparative advantage in hydel power. \n \n11. \nPakistan  is  expected  to  face  significant  capacity  shortfalls  relative  to  peak  demand  as \nearly  as  2006.  With  seasonal  electricity  consumption  seeing  peak  consumption  occurring  in  the \nsummer months, the country had about a 1,215 MW surplus in 2004, representing an 8% reserve \nmargin, which is considered tight. This surplus is expected to decline to only 440 MW at the end of \n2005. If no capacity is added, the surplus will turn to deficit from 2006 (minus 411 MW), and the \nGovernment\u2019s  Private  Power  and  Infrastructure  Board  projects  that  the  deficit  will  exceed  4,000 \nMW by 2009. WAPDA, whose system delivers 87% of total electricity consumption, projects and \nconfirms a similar deficit. To address this precarious situation, WAPDA has developed a least-cost \nGeneration  Expansion  Plan  (2006-2010)  in  which  this  Project  is  featured  as  adding  79  MW  of \nhydel capacity in 2009. The plan is designed to add some 3,557 MW of new capacity in that time \nperiod (i.e., the next 4 years) via 19 separate projects. Even assuming these projects go ahead \nand are implemented on time, the deficit in generation relative to peak demand will still amount to \n330MW in 2006 and 2,376 MW in 2009 (please refer to Appendix 1). It is in this context that the \nProject is being developed and ADB\u2019s support is being sought.4\n \n\n2. \n\nSector Regulations and Reform  \n\n12. \nThe power sector, which encompasses the generation, transmission, and distribution of \nelectricity,  is  governed  and  regulated  under  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority \n(NEPRA) Act of 1997. NEPRA, which was constituted under this Act as an independent entity, \nis  exclusively  empowered  under  the  act  and  related  rules  to  regulate  all  facets  of  the  power \nsector.5  NEPRA  is  thus  empowered  to  grant  licenses  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution;  to  approve  tariffs,  rates,  and  charges  across  the  sector;  and  to  establish  uniform \nindustry  performance  via  codes  and  standards,  which  it  enforcements.  NEPRA,  although \nmandated as an independent entity, is governed by a chairman and four members who are all \nappointed by the Government, with the members recommended by and representing provincial \ninterests.  ADB  supported  NEPRA\u2019s  capacity  building  in  2001  and  2003  with  technical \nassistance.6  \n \n\n                                                 \n4   The data provided in paras. 8\u201311 is from WAPDA and/or Laraib. \n5   There  are  some  exceptions  related  to  self-generation,  or  generation  undertaken  directly  by  provinces  for  within-\nprovince distribution, provided that provinces set up their own distribution networks and are not connected to the \nnational grid. It is worth noting that NEPRA does not have jurisdiction in AJ&K, but does over NTDC. However, the \nInspectorate  of  Electricity  of  AJ&K,  which  assumes  the  role  of  regulator  in  AJ&K,  voluntarily  follows  the  rules, \nregulations,  and  tariffs  set  by  NEPRA.  It  is  understood  that,  in  respect  of  the  Project,  the  primary  role  of  the \nInspectorate is to issue the standard consents under the terms of the Electricity Act 1938 (see also footnote 11). \n6   ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Institutional  Capacity  Building  of  the \n\nNational Electric Power Authority. Manila \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nlegislative \n\nPower  sector  policies  and  related \n\nframeworks  are  developed  and \n13. \nimplemented by the Government via the Ministry of Water and Power. The Government initiated \nthe  process  of  power  sector  reforms  and  restructuring  in  the  early  1990s  on  the  advice  of  the \nWorld  Bank.  The  power  sector  restructuring  and  reform  process  developed  through  various \nstages  and  policies,  such  as  the  Power  Policy  1994,  Hydel  Policy  1995,  Transmission  Line \nPolicy  1995,  Power  Policy  1998,  and  Power  Policy  2002.  These  were  designed,  to  a  large \nextent,  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in  a  newly  restructured  power  sector.  In  addition, \nthe NEPRA Act was promulgated to provide the overall regulatory umbrella for the sector. The \nGovernment  is  today  unbundling  WAPDA  into  various  independent  entities.  The  broad \nobjectives  of  all  these  policies  have  been  to  inculcate  sector-wide  efficiencies  through \ncompetitive  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  with  appropriate  independent  regulatory \noversight;  rationalize  prices  and  subsidies;  and  encourage  private  capital  formation  and \ninvestment to meet growing electricity demand. ADB has directly supported these endeavors.7\n \n14. \nAs  a  result,  the  power  sector  is  in  transition  and  is  today  semi-privatized  and  semi-\nderegulated.  The  sector  has  historically  been  characterized  by  very  significant  Government \ncontrol  via  the  WAPDA  and  KESC  monopolies  (which  function  as  vertically  integrated  utilities \nencompassing  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution)  and  by  significant  inefficiency  (with \nlosses in excess of 25%) and inability to meet demand. This characterization, at least in terms \nof outright Government control, has changed over the last decade with significant private sector-\nled generation via IPPs, which together represent in excess of 30% of total generation capacity. \nSignificant reforms have taken place to break WAPDA\u2019s power assets into discreet generation \nand  distribution  units,  and  to  place  WAPDA\u2019s  transmission  assets  into  a  single  corporatized \nentity,  NTDC.  NTDC  will  assume  the  additional  function  of  acting  as  the  single  buyer  of \nwholesale generation from multiple companies in the market (but excluding KESC) for onward \ntransmission and sale to distribution entities, in addition to responsibilities as market and system \noperator  (as  an  interim  step  to  a  fully  competitive  electricity  market).  This  single-buyer  model \nnow being implemented will ultimately evolve into a multiple-buyer and multiple-seller regime in \nwhich generators and distributors can contract directly. However, this development is expected \nto  take  quite  some  time,  and  it  is  not  expected  in  the  foreseeable  future  that  a  full  merchant \nmarket  will  replace  long-term  structures  under  the  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  signed \nwith NTDC on 16 April 2004.  PPAs are felt to be the best way of delivering needed power to the \nsystem.  It  is  important  to  note  that  existing  IPPs,  and  those  already  approved  and  under \ndevelopment  will  be  grandfathered  under  existing  legislation  preserving  their  contractual \nframeworks including tariff structures, which in itself promotes policy consistency. The role and \nresponsibilities of NTDC are more fully described in Appendix 2.  \n \n15. \nGOAJK wishes to develop its hydropower resources to meet some 300 MW of demand, \nwhich is currently being met from the national grid. AJ&K is rich in hydropower resources, and \nthus  GOAJK  has  prioritized  hydropower  development  to  meet  its  own  load  requirements  and \ncreate  an  exportable  surplus.8  So  far  there  has  been  only  limited  success  with  small-scale \nprojects, and a total capacity of some 36 MW in operation. GOAJK adopted the Government\u2019s \nHydel  Policies  of  1995  and  1998  and  is  developing  its  own  power  policy  partly  based  on  the \nPower  Policy  2002  to  attract  and  enable  private  sector  development.  GOAJK  has  developed \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for Energy Sector Restructuring Program. Manila \n\n8  GOAJK\u2019s Electricity Department/Inspectorate has administrative control over the development, generation, supply, \nand  distribution  of  hydel  and  thermal  power  in  AJ&K,  including  the  administration  of  relevant  Government  Acts, \nand  liaison  with  WAPDA.  GOAJK  has  specifically  tasked  the  Hydro  Electric  Board,  a  unit  of  GOAJK,  with \nresponsibility  for  both  public  and  private  hydel  projects  and  with  implementing  the  Government\u2019s  hydel  policy \nthrough the private sector. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nspecial  hydel  concessions,  such  as  leasing  state-owned  land  at  attractive  rates  and  attractive \ntax  and  levy  incentives.  GOAJK  is  also  planning  a  power  highway  to  disperse  power  from \nremote  hydel  sites  as  well  as  the  development  of  its  own  grid  to  distribute  the  electricity \ngenerated. The Project is not dependant on these efforts as it will connect directly to an NTDC \ntransmission line. \n \n16. \nThe Project is being developed under the Government\u2019s Hydel Policy 1995, which offers \nconcessions,  facilities,  and  incentives  to  the  private  sector  to  design,  build,  own,  operate,  and \nultimately transfer back to government hydropower projects. In 1998, the Government allowed \nthe continued implementation of the Project under the Hydel Policy 1995 subject to negotiation \nand agreement of the tariff with WAPDA (or its successors). These tariffs have been agreed as \ndescribed more fully in section C and are viewed by the Government (including NEPRA, NTDC \nand PPIB), GOAJK, and the private sector as being highly competitive. \n \n17. \nIt  should  be  noted  that  several  of  the  thermal  IPPs  that  were  promoted  largely  in  the \nearly 1990s faced considerable difficulties both because some of them were arguably politically \nmotivated and due to an acute power surplus in the latter part of the 1990s. However, all of the \nsubstantive  disputes  between  the  Government  and  the  IPPs  have  been  satisfactorily  resolved \nwith  some  tariff  renegotiation,  a  change  in  government,  and  with  the  disappearance  of  the \npower surplus. The existing IPPs are now successfully operating, and a number are looking at \nexpansions and/or refinancing on improved terms. Even should further problems occur with the \nIPPs (a situation that is considered unlikely by both the Government and the IPPs), the Project, \nwith  its  low  tariffs  and  preferred  merit  order  characteristics, is  expected  to  be  one  of  the  least \nvulnerable to any change in political sentiment. \n \n\nB. \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\n18. \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP),  approved  in  May  2002  and  updated  in \nSeptember 2004, aims to support poverty reduction in Pakistan through specific interventions in \nthe  following  three  areas:  (i)  supporting  good  governance  including  sector  reform;  (ii) \nsustainable  pro-poor  growth  with  infrastructure  and  rural  development  and  employment \ngeneration;  and  (iii)  inclusive  social  development.  The  CSP  acknowledges  and  supports  the \npriority  that  the  Government  accords  to  developing  economic  infrastructure  as  an  engine  for \nhigher  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  medium  term,  and  it  recognizes  that,  given  the \nconstraints  on  public  sector  resources  and  capacity,  the  private  sector  needs  to  play  an \nimportant and growing role in infrastructure development. In particular, the CSP calls for ADB to \nredirect  its  ordinary  capital  resource  lending  towards  infrastructure  projects  that  will  have  the \ngreatest  impact  on  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  One  of  the  identified  priorities  is  addressing \ncritical  gaps  in  the  power  sector  as  well  as  facilitating  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  for \ninfrastructure development. Experience has also shown that the private sector can reduce the \ncost of project development by some 30\u201350% compared with Government-developed projects. \nThis can be seen from the publicly financed Chashma and Ghazi Barotha hydropower projects, \nwhere cost escalation and delays significantly increased costs. \n \n19. \nTo  support  private  sector  involvement  in  infrastructure  development,  ADB  will  focus  on \nproviding assistance in (i) the development of a strategy to determine the role of the private sector \nin financing, constructing, operating, and maintaining infrastructure through the formation of PPPs; \n(ii) the creation of policy, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to support such PPPs; and (iii) \nthe  development  of  pilot  partnership  models  for  specific  projects.  Under  its  private  sector \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\ndevelopment strategy, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department is directed to provide direct \nassistance to private sector entities through investments, lending, and guarantees, principally for \nprojects in the power, water, transport, and oil and gas sectors.  \n\n \n2. \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy9  designates  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  as  (i)  reducing \n20. \npoverty by, among other ways, creating energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth; \n(ii)  promoting  private  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an \nenabling  environment  for  private  investors;  (iii)  addressing  regional  and  global  environmental \nimpacts; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. In particular, the strategy strongly encourages \nADB\u2019s  interventions  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the  energy  sector  to  take \nadvantage of the higher operational efficiencies that private sector operators can achieve and to \nmeet  the  large  capital  requirements  of  energy  infrastructure.  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy \npromotes a shift to cleaner fuels and processes. The strategy also encourages the liberalization \nof markets and elimination of cross subsidies.  \n\n \n3. \n\nProject Consistency with Asian Development Bank Strategies \n\n21. \nThe Project promotes and is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country and energy sector strategies \nand  its  thematic  priorities  of  economic  development,  private  sector  development,  good \ngovernance,  and  environmental  protection.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  economic \ndevelopment and reform of the power sector, which are vital for economic growth and efficiency. \nThe  Project  will  promote  private  sector  investment  in  infrastructure  development,  freeing  up \ngovernment resources for other types of expenditure. The Project will enable NTDC to distribute \nelectricity  to  the  consumer,  where  demand  is  currently  not  fully  met,  and  will  help  meet  the \nenergy  needs  of  the  industrial  and  commercial  sectors,  thus  enabling  economic  growth.  The \nProject will also help to stabilize the grid and promote the lowering of system losses, given its \nproximity to the load center. The Project will use clean energy, which is essential for sustainable \ndevelopment.  The  Project  may  be  eligible  for  certified  emissions  reduction  credits,  upon \napplication, under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, which would help to promote the Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  (CDM)  market.10  ADB  has  supported  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  in \nrestructuring  the  power  sector  to  enable  it  to  attract  more  private  sector  investments.  ADB\u2019s \nfinancial  assistance  to  the  Project  will  represent  a  natural  and  consistent  extension  of  its \nprescribed policy support to Pakistan.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n10  The  Project  may  be  eligible  to  apply  for  certified  emissions  reduction  credits,  subject  to  its  meeting  certain \nprescribed  criteria  and  independent  third  party  validation,  pursuant  to  the  CDM  established  under  the  Kyoto \nProtocol. Pakistani projects are now eligible to apply for CDM treatment under the Kyoto Protocol, which Pakistan \nratified  on  11  January  2005,  and  its  pre-curser,  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change, \nwhich Pakistan ratified on 1 June 1996. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nSponsors and Ownership  \n\nA. \n \nThe Project was conceived and developed by a group of private investors. These private \n22. \ninvestors incorporated Laraib Energy Limited as a public limited company to undertake the Project \npursuant to a Letter of Support issued by the Government of Pakistan and dated 18 May 1996. \nMr.  Khalid  Faizi,  who  leads  Laraib  as  chief  executive  officer,  and  his  co-investors  financed \nLaraib\u2019s  long  development  process  and  have  managed  to  negotiate  a  financially  sustainable \nproject  that  meets  NTDC\u2019s  capacity  generation  and  tariff  requirements.  It  also  fits  well  with \nWAPDA\u2019s  least-cost  Generation  Expansion  Plan,  in  which  it  is  listed,  and  is  underpinned  by  a \nrobust  contractual  structure.  Laraib\u2019s  success  can  be  attributed  largely  to  the  persistence  and \nprofessional and technical capabilities of Laraib\u2019s initial owners and management team. Laraib\u2019s \nowners  and  managers  are  associated  with  several  other  business  enterprises  built  over  many \nyears  including,  for  example,  representing  Sumitomo  Corporation\u2019s  power,  energy,  and \ncommunications interests in Pakistan. Laraib\u2019s owners are also involved, via separate companies, \nin a captive hydropower generating plant  that generates 10 GWh per annum. It is the only private \nhydel  plant  in  Pakistan,  serving  a  steel  furnace  and  other  small-scale  hydropower  development \ninitiatives in AJ&K. \n \nLaraib\u2019s  initial  owners\u2019  and  investors\u2019  intention  was  to  attract  additional  large-scale \n23. \ninvestors to the Project once it achieved a sufficient level of development. The original owners of \nLaraib  have  recently  achieved  this  important  objective  with  the  introduction  into  the  Project  of \nRanhill, which will take a 51% stake in Laraib.  \n \n24. \nRanhill  Berhad,  which  has  been  listed  in  the  Main  Board  of  the  Kuala  Lumpur  Stock \nExchange since 2001, was originally established in 1973 by the Australian consulting engineers \nRankine  and  Hill  to  provide  mechanical  and  electrical  engineering  design  services.  Ranhill \nbecame wholly Malaysian owned in 1981 and expanded its range of engineering services to the \noil  and  gas  sector  through  a  partnership  with  Flour  Daniel  of  the  USA.  Its  business  objectives \nhave  since  expanded  to  include  power,  infrastructure,  water,  and  oil  and  gas.  Ranhill  today \nprovides  full  engineering  and  construction  services,  from  initial  concept  design  to  detailed \nengineering,  construction,  and  commissioning,  and  its  activities  encompass  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contracts; project management and operations; and maintenance. \nRanhill\u2019s  activities  are  international  in  scope  and  include  work  performed  in  Southeast  Asia,  the \nIndian subcontinent including Pakistan, the Middle East, and Africa. Ranhill\u2019s investment in Laraib \nis  part  of  its  recent  strategy  since  1999  of  developing  outright  ownership  of  infrastructure  and \nutility  assets,  domestically  and  internationally,  as  a  way  to  stabilize  cash  flows  over  economic \ncycles. Ranhill Berhad is also Malaysia\u2019s first fully integrated private water company (from water \nsource to tap) under a 30 year concession serving 2.2 million customers in the state of Johor.  \n  \n25. \nThe  management  resources  of  Laraib  will  be  supplemented  by  the  resources  of  the \ndesignated operation and maintenance contractor, a subsidiary of Union Fenoza of Spain, which \nhas  extensive  hydropower  assets  and  operating  experience,  and  which  will  provide,  subject  to \nagreement on terms, support during the initial years of project operation. \n \n26. \nto provide strong overview and control by the owner.  \n \n \n \n\nThe project construction administration will be established including an owners\u2019 engineer \n\n \n\n\fProject Description \n\nB. \n \n27. \nThe Project involves construction and operation of a run-of-the-river, low-head, 79 MW \nhydel  power-generating  complex.  The  Project  is  located  at  the  New  Bong  Escape,  7.5  km \ndownstream of the existing Mangla Dam, which was completed in 1967 on the Jhelum River in \nAJ&K. The project site is 120 km from Islamabad. The Project will be fed by water originating \nfrom the Mangla Reservoir, which is released through the Mangla powerhouse (1,000 MW) into \nthe Bong Canal. There is no new reservoir or other water storage envisaged for the Project. The \nproject site, scheme, and environmental aspects are illustrated in Appendix 3. \n \n28. \nThe  key  components  of  the  Project  include  the  headrace  channel,  power  intake, \npowerhouse  complex,  tailrace  channel,  substation,  switchyard,  road,  bridge,  subsidiary  outfall \nstructure,  and  interconnection  with  132  kV  transmission  line.  The  headrace  channel  is  around \n500  meters  (m)  long  and  will  connect  the  Bong  Pond  and  the  proposed  powerhouse.  The \nheadrace channel is concrete lined, with a capacity of 1,080 cubic meters per second (m3/sec) \nof  water  flow.  The  powerhouse  complex  will  house  four  sets  of  bulb  turbines  and  generators, \nand associated electrical and mechanical systems. The tailrace channel is 4,014 m long and will \nrelease  water  from  the  powerhouse  to  the  Hari  River,  a  channel  of  the  Jhelum  river.  The \nswitchyard  will  provide  connectivity  with  the  existing  132  kV  system  through  an  in-out \narrangement on the 132 kV Mangla\u2013Kharian transmission line passing over the project site.  \n \n29. \nProject  construction  will  take  approximately  36  (required  42  months),  including  civil \nworks  taking  approximately  24  months  and  electro-mechanical  works  taking  approximately \n36months.  The  delivery,  installation,  and  commissioning  of  the  first  of  four  turbines  will  take \nplace  in  the  26th  month,  and  of  subsequent  turbines  after  that.  The  powerhouse  should \ncommence electricity production some 27 months after the start of construction with full capacity \nbeing  reached  at  the  end  of  the  36th  month.  The  Project\u2019s  technical  aspects,  including \nhydrology and construction arrangements, will be comprehensively reviewed by Mott McDonald \nof the United Kingdom, which has been retained as independent engineer to ADB and IDB. It is \nenvisaged  that  this  role  will  continue  through  construction  and  initial  operations.  Mott \nMacDonald has visited the project site, and its initial assessments are satisfactory. \n \nC. \n \n30. \nSherman  &  Sterling  and  Kabraji  &  Talibuddin  have  been  retained  by  ADB  and  IDB  as \nlenders\u2019  external  legal  counsel  to  coordinate  legal  due  diligence  on  project  permitting  and \nlicenses, implementing legislation, and project contracts and financing arrangements. The legal \ndue diligence process is under way. \n \n\nKey Project Implementation Arrangements   \n\n1. \n\nPower Offtake \n\n31. \nThe power generated by the Project will be sold to NTDC under a long-term PPA during a \n25-year  concession  period.  The  PPA  contains  a  take-or-pay  undertaking  whereby  energy \nproduction  not  purchased  by  NTDC  will  be  compensated  through  a  minimum  energy  payment, \nbased on the possible energy production and historic hydrology. \n\n 8 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nNTDC,  which  is  more  fully  discussed  in  Appendix  2,  was  incorporated  on  6  November \n32. \n1998  and  commenced  commercial  operations  on  1  March  1999.  Ultimately,  NTDC\u2019s  financial \nstrength  and  operational  capacity  stems  from  being  wholly  owned  by  the  Government.  This \nGovernment\u2019s support of NTDC\u2019s critical role in the power sector is evidenced, in the case of the \nProject, by the Government\u2019s guarantee of NTDC\u2019s performance obligations under the PPA.  \n \n33. \nOperationally,  NTDC  links  power  generation  units  and  load  centers  around  the  country, \npurchasing power from public and private sector generators (noting that the process of transfer of \npurchase obligations for private power from WAPDA to NTDC is ongoing) and selling this to the \neight distribution companies through its network of some 32,000 km of transmission lines, 624 grid \nstations,  and  47  consumer  substations  of  varying  capacities  all  over  the  country.  This  network \nmakes NTDC one of the largest contiguous grid systems in the world.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Tariff, Project Award, and Government Approval  \n\n34. \nThe  project  concession  was  awarded  to  Laraib  under  the  Government\u2019s  Hydel  Policy \n1995.  This  policy,  like  the  thermal  policy  before  it,  lays  down  a  framework  and  process  for \nselecting and developing private hydel power projects. Laraib applied for and received a letter of \ninterest to develop the Project as a raw site and carry out a feasibility study. After completing the \nfeasibility  study,  Laraib  was  issued  a  letter  of  support  on  18  May  1996,  allowing  it  to  further \ndevelop  the  Project,  negotiate  the  tariff  with  WAPDA,  and  proceed  to  financial  closing, \nconstruction, and commercial operations. Two years after promulgation of the Hydel Policy 1995, \nthe  Government  decided  that  all  projects  that  had  been  issued  letters  of  support  would  not  be \nautomatically eligible for the Hydel Policy 1995 tariff but would have to negotiate directly with the \npower  purchaser.  This  disrupted  the  development  process  and  caused  a  delay  in  finalizing  the \ntariff with NTDC (originally, WAPDA). The change in policy was a direct repercussion of the tariff \ndisputes with the thermal IPPs. The upside of this process, and of the finely negotiated tariff that \nresulted from it, are the creation of a \u201cwilling buyer\u2013willing seller\u201d agreement and the tariff security \nthat this brings. Further, the tariff has been approved by NEPRA, the regulator that oversees the \ntariff  regime  in  Pakistan  and  seeks  to  balance  the  rights  of  consumers  with  the  commercial \nimperatives of the generating companies. \n \n35. \nlimited to, the following:  \n \n\nThe Government's selection criteria for awarding such concessions include, but are not \n\n(i) \n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\nsponsors\u2019 financial strength, technical capability, and past experience;  \nproject parameters such as the requirements that projects must generate at least \n40%  of  their  design  capacity  in  the  January\u2013June  winter  months  of  low  water \nflow,  plant  factors  must  be  50%  or  above,  and  projects  must  be  located  on \nsmaller  rivers  or  canals,  as  projects  on  main  rivers  require  special  permission; \nand  \nthe  Hydel  Policy  1995  tariff  must  be  met,  such  that,  for  example,  levelized  and \nnominal tariffs are within prescribed ranges.   \n\n \nTo  achieve  a  level  playing  field  and  economic  efficiency,  the  Government  indicated \n36. \ntarget  tariffs  for  projects  of  different  sizes.  It  was  then  made  incumbent  on  the  developer  to \nframe its tariff profile to meet the target tariff guidelines provided. The ultimate tariff negotiated \nand agreed would have to take into account the plant factor, project cost, and any other project-\nspecific  features,  but  was  essentially  designed  to  reflect  cost  recovery  with  a  maximum \npermitted indicative equity internal rate of return. The Government ensured its goal of low-cost \ngeneration by capping tariffs and thus returns, leaving private sector developers to develop their \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nprojects to meet its needs. Thus, by controlling the tariff and indirectly capping project costs, the \nGovernment  was  able  to  achieve  transparency  and  cost  control,  which  is  critical  to  its  goal  of \nlow-cost electricity.  \n \nInternational experience shows that the tariff is competitive, while the project cost is also \n37. \nwell  within  accepted  international  norms  for  such  projects  based  on  bulb  turbines,  low  heads, \nand  a  relatively  large  volume  of  water  flow.  The  lenders\u2019  independent  engineer  has  already \nprovided an initial validation, and this subject will be covered in detail in its due diligence report. \n \n38. \nThe  Project  is  situated within  an  area  of  high  demand  near  a  generation-deficient  load \ncenter.  Based  on  load  studies,  forecasts,  and  information  available  for  the  power  market,  it  is \nexpected that there will be high demand for the Project\u2019s output. The Project is designed to feed \ninto  a  transmission  line  at  132  kV  and  will  mainly  feed  the  nearby  Gujranwala  Electric  Power \nCompany (GEPCO) load center, which is currently deficient in generation. As such, the Project \nwill  not  only  meet  GEPCO\u2019s  load  center  needs  but  also  reduce  NTDC\u2019s  500  kV  and  220  kV \npower flow imports that presently feed GEPCO, relieving the burden on NTDC\u2019s higher voltage \ntransmission  system  and  reducing  NTDC\u2019s  transmission  losses.  In  addition,  the  Project  is  a \nsource  of  reactive  power  to  the  132  kV  systems  and  thus  improves  its  voltage  profile  and \nstability. Consequently, the Project is expected to rank high in dispatch merit among the peak \nload power plants in AJ&K and Pakistan generally, as is the case with the Mangla plant. NTDC\u2019s \nintent  in  this  regard  is  explicit,  as  NTDC  is  specifically  obligated  under  the  PPA  to  give \npreferential dispatch to the Project ahead of thermal plants. In addition, hydropower plants such \nas the Project are ideally suited for frequency control and peak demand operation. In any power \nsystem,  peaking  power  is  the  most  expensive,  and  using  hydropower  for  peaking  imputes  the \nmaximum  value  to  hydel  capacity.  Further  benefits  of  hydel  power  include  rapid  response  to \nsudden system requirements, and the low cost of generation. As water released by the Mangla \npowerhouse  (1,000  MW)  will  be  utilized  by  the  Project  in  the  same  pattern  and  volume,  the \nProject\u2019s  generation  will  shadow  that  of  the  Mangla  plant and  will  thus  provide  additional,  and \nmuch needed, critical peaking power to the system. \n \n\n3. \n\nPower Evacuation \n\nThe Project\u2019s electricity will be evacuated through the existing 132 kV Mangla-Kharian \n39. \ntransmission line, which passes over the Project site. Minimal new construction is required for \nconnection other than for the switchyard and cable ducts of approximately 500 meters to the \nexisting transmission line, and the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract \nincludes this cost. Through this line, the power will be transmitted to the AJ&K regional grid for \nsupply to NTDC and its customers. The interconnection and transmission facilities will be built \nby the Project and included under the EPC contract, thus minimizing connection risks. \n\n \n4. \n\nWater Use and Hydrology \n\n40. \nThe  Project\u2019s  energy  generation  relies  upon  the  flows  through  the  Bong  Canal,  less  the \nwater requirement of the Upper Jhelum Canal, which is drawn based on irrigation requirements. \nThe Bong Canal is in the Mangla powerhouse tailrace and fed from the Mangla Reservoir, which \nis in turn fed by the rivers Jhelum, Kanshi, and Punch together with flows of the Jhelum tributaries \nKunhar  and  Neelum.  The  catchment  of  the  Jhelum  River  above  Mangla  is  33,330  square \nkilometers  of  which  82%  is  higher  than  1,220  m  and  28%  is  higher  than  3,050  m.  The  basin  is \nbounded  on  the  north  by  the  Great  Himalayas  and  contains  the  whole  Vale  of  Kashmir.  The \nMangla Reservoir was constructed in 1967 with a storage capacity of some 5.88 million acre feet \n(MAF), of which about 1.2 MAF has been lost through sedimentation in its first 37 years. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nThe  Project  will  rely  on  well-regulated  and  proven  water  releases  from  the  existing \n41. \nMangla powerhouse (which currently has 1,000 MW of capacity). The Mangla Reservoir has an \naverage annual inflow of about 23 MAF. Of this, around 2.6 MAF has been passing through the \nspillway  annually  and  6.6  MAF  has  been  the  annual  requirement  of  the  Upper  Jhelum  Canal, \nthus  leaving  an  average  of  about  13.6  MAF  annually  for  the  Project.  The  Project  has  been \ndesigned to utilize an average of 12.2 MAF per annum.  \n \n42. \nThe Project\u2019s hydrology risk has been extensively studied and is considered to be low.  \nReliable hydrological data is available from the Mangla Dam Organization records from 1922 to \ndate. Furthermore, a scheme is currently under implementation on the Mangla Dam itself, which \nshould significantly increase water flows to the Project and thus further reduce hydrological risk.  \nThe proposed Mangla Raise project (raising the storage of Mangla Reservoir from 4.7 MAF to \n7.6  MAF)  was  signed  on  28  June  2004  and  is  due  for  completion  in  2007  or  2008.  This  will \ncontribute an additional 15%\u201320% of energy generation to the Project, although this additional \ngeneration is not included in the base case or economic analysis.  \n \n43. \nsupported by the summary initial environmental evaluation, which is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n44. \nA  water  use  agreement  (WUA)  allowing  Laraib  exclusive  right  to  use  the  waters  of  the \nBong Canal was signed between the company and GOAJK on 16 April 2004. The WUA, which \nis guaranteed by the Government of Pakistan, provides for the grant of exclusive rights to utilize \nthe  water  of  the  Bong  Canal  with  water  releases  assured  on  the  basis  of  historic  hydrology. \nNTDC is responsible for paying a water charge directly to GOAJK. \n \n \n\nThe  Project  will  not  alter  the  existing  water  regime  of  the  area.  This  conclusion  is \n\n5. \n\nGovernment Implementation Agreements and Guarantee \n\nSimultaneously  with  the  PPA,  two  implementation  agreements  have  been  signed \n45. \nbetween  Laraib  and  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  GOAJK  respectively.  The  agreements \nallow Laraib to implement the Project and specify the incentives and concessions offered. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  implementation  agreements,  a  Government  of  Pakistan  guarantee \n46. \nprovides an overriding performance security from the Government in favor of Laraib, in addition \nto the other security provisions set forth in the PPA and the implementation agreements. \n \n\n6. \n\nEngineering, Procurement, and Construction Contract  \n\n47. \nThe Project will be constructed under a lump-sum, fixed-price, date-certain turnkey EPC \ncontract.  The  non-EPC,  non-critical  parts  of  the  Project,  including  the  housing  colony, \nlandscaping, roads, etc., may be contracted out to various local contractors, package-wise on a \nturnkey basis, but under the responsibility of the EPC contractor. \n \n48. \nThe process of securing a fixed-price, lump-sum, turnkey EPC contract was competitive. \nLaraib initiated the process in September 2004 when nine firms from Pakistan, Malaysia, China, \nand Germany were asked to submit fixed-price bids using the Project's feasibility study as the \nbasis for their offer. This initial set of bids, while inconclusive, established a range of prices for \nthe EPC contract works. In view of  its past track record, together with its appreciation of EPC \ncontracting, the decision was made to negotiate with Ranhill Engineers and Constructors as the \nEPC contractor for the Project. \n \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nThe lenders' independent engineer reviewed both the above tendering process and the \n49. \nfinal  prices  and  has  expressed  an  initial  positive  opinion  on  both  matters.  The  Project's  EPC \ncost compares favorably with similar projects elsewhere. Laraib was thus satisfied that the cost \nof both the EPC contract and the Project as a whole is indeed reasonable when compared to \nsimilar projects elsewhere in the world and the best price available in the market at the moment. \n \n\n7. \n\nOperational Arrangements \n\nSoluziona, a wholly owned subsidiary of Union Fenosa, the third largest electricity utility \n50. \nin  Spain,  is  expected  to  be  the  O&M  contractor.  Soluziona  has  significant  operational \nexperience,  as  it  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and  management  of  Union  Fenosa\u2019s \ngenerating assets amounting to some 9,782 MW, including 2,727 MW of hydel, as well as third-\nparty plants. Union Fenosa has annual turnover of \u20ac5.8 billion and total group assets of \u20ac15.2 \nbillion.  Laraib\u2019s  owners  themselves  have  experience  in  small-scale  hydel  operations,  and  the \nmanagement team is expected to include one or more hydel experts. \n \n\n8. \n\nLand Lease Arrangements \n\n51. \nThe project site was originally leased by WAPDA from AJ&K as part of the Mangla Dam \nproject in the 1960s. As per the terms of this original arrangement, WAPDA returned the site to \nAJ&K  as  land  surplus  to  the  needs  of  the  Mangla  Dam  project.  Laraib  has  now  leased  21.4 \nhectares of this land from AJ&K, with the formal lease notification executed on 9 October 2003. \nThe required lease payment has been made and possession of the land taken by Laraib. The \nlease period is 25 years with an option for extension. \n \n\n9. \n\nInsurance Arrangements \n\n52. \nLaraib will take out insurance to cover essential risks for the supply and transportation of \nplant and machinery for erecting and commissioning and to cover all risks during construction \nand after commencement of commercial operations. The insurance package will be designed to \nmaximize cover for insurable risks. An insurance advisor to the lenders will be retained to review \nand implement insurance arrangements. \n \nD. \n \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment  \n\n53. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  environmental  category  B  considering  the  Project\u2019s \ndesign as a run-of-the-river scheme and its environmental and ecological setting. Environmental \nclearance  for  the  Project  was  received  from  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  of \nGOAJK  and  the  Government  of  Pakistan  EPA  in  20  August  1996  and  6  January  1997, \nrespectively. Clearance was later reconfirmed by GOAJK EPA in August 2004 for increasing the \nproject  capacity  from  45MW.  Notwithstanding  the  reconfirmation  of  the  environmental \nclearance, Laraib updated the original environmental and social assessment to reflect any new \ndevelopments that had taken place after the clearance and to assess any possible impacts due \nto  the  increase  in  project  capacity.  The  updated  environmental  and  social  assessment  was \nprepared  in  the  form  of  an  initial  environmental  examination  document,  and  its  summary  is \npresented in Appendix  3. The examination confirmed that the findings and conclusions on the \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  Project  in  the  original  environmental  and  social \nsoundness assessment11 report remain valid.  \n                                                 \n11  The designated term for the environmental impact assessment process in Pakistan. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n54. \nDuring construction, the Project will create certain environmental disturbances, such as \nthe  noise  and  dust  invariably  associated  with  construction.  These  environmental  disturbances \nwill  be  temporary  and  can  be  effectively  addressed  through  established  sound  engineering \ndesign and mitigation measures as well as sound environmental management practices in the \nconstruction process. These issues will be prescribed and included as part of the EPC contract. \nThe  dredging  of  one  channel  of  the  Jhelum  River  and  the  embankment  works  will  have  no \nimpacts  on  the  river  flow  regime  and  ecosystem,  as  the  flood  plain  is  broad  and  has  several \nchannels  during  the  dry  season.  The  Project  will  utilize  water  currently  discharged  from  the \nMangla  hydropower  plant  into  the  Jhelum  River.  Therefore,  it  will  not  change  the  current  flow \nregime  of  the  river.  Proper  treatment  of  wastes  from  the  construction  and  residential  quarters \nand offices, the minor environmental management issue that has been raised, will be mitigated. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n55. \nNo indigenous people live in the area surrounding the Project, no inhabitants occupy the \nsite itself, and so no resettlement issues exist. The only minor social issue is the unauthorized use \nof  about  6  hectares  of  land  on  small  areas  of  the  Project  site  by  families  from  two  adjacent \ncommunities  for  fodder  cultivation  and  grazing.  To  resolve  this  issue,  public  consultations  were \nheld  in  the  two  adjacent  communities,  and  the  few  families  concerned  agreed  to  stop  their \nunauthorized land use. Laraib has expressed its willingness to provide suitable compensation to \nthem (see Appendix 3). \n \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\nThe  Project  is  designed  primarily  to  promote  economic  growth  through  increasing  the \n56. \nsupply  of  electricity  at  relatively  low  cost.  The  power  generated  by  the  Project  will  help  the \ncountry  to  bridge  a  pending  electricity  shortfall,  thus  avoiding  energy  shedding  and  economic \ndisruption.  Sponsored  by  private  investors,  complemented  by  Malaysian  and  Spanish \nengineering and power companies, the Project will provide best practice in energy infrastructure \ndevelopment. As the first private hydel power investment in Pakistan, the Project will provide an \nimportant benchmark for future hydel projects that are planned. The Project was developed in \nthe  context  of  the  Hydel  Policy  1995,  which  ensures  competitive  power,  and  it  thus  improves \nsector-wide  efficiency.  The  Project  is  based  on  indigenous  and  renewable  energy,  which  is \nessential for sustainable economic development and particularly well suited to Pakistan, and will \nsupport the development of the CDM market under the Kyoto Protocol, to which Pakistan is a \nsignatory. The Project will catalyze financing from local and/or international commercial banks, \nencouraging these institutions to develop their private infrastructure lending activities to support \nthe newly evolving private hydel sector and extend the maturities of their financing beyond those \ntypically  available  in  the  market  at  present.  The  Project  will  also  be  the  first  ADB  cofinacing \nagreement  integrating  Islamic  banking  principles  and  conventional  banking  instruments.  The \nProject will create employment opportunities for up to 500 workers at any one time during the \nconstruction  period  and  some  30\u201350  workers  during  operations.  Laraib  will  seek  to  maximize \nthe hiring of local people and is also committed to equal opportunities for women. A significant \nnumber of jobs for women are expected at Laraib as well as at the social facilities (a school and \nclinic) that will be constructed by Laraib for the benefit of the Project and the local community. \nThis  employment  creation  is  particularly  important  given  that  this  is  a  relatively  poor  region  of \nPakistan and that the Project will thus directly help to create conditions for economic growth and \npoverty alleviation. \n \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n4. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n57. \nADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  and  Operations  Evaluation \nDepartment  are  formulating  guidelines  for  implementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for \nEvaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations,  which  were  prepared  by  the  Evaluation \nCooperation Group12 of the multilateral development banks. These standards cover the roles of \nthe  independent  evaluation  department  and  the  PSOD  itself,  the  evaluation  dimensions  for \nprivate  sector  operations,  the  nature  of  annual  reporting,  and  dissemination  of  reports  and \nlessons. According to the standards, the three principal dimensions for private sector evaluation \nare  development  outcome  (encompassing  project  performance,  the  project\u2019s  contribution  to \neconomic  sustainability,  and  its  contribution  to  private  sector  development),  investment \nprofitability  of  the  project  intervention  to  the  institution  itself  (i.e.,  specific  returns  on  the  loan, \nguarantee, or equity investment), and operational effectiveness measured and assessed on an \noverall department level.  \n \n58. \nThe  Project  has  been  assessed  and  described  from  the  perspectives  of  development \neffectiveness  and  project  framework  in  terms  of  its  specific  performance,  and  the  Project\u2019s \ncontribution  to  both  economic  sustainability  and  private  sector  development  (please  refer  to \nAppendix  4).  The  Project  is  deemed  to  be  developmentally  effective,  and  its  performance \nmeasurable. A brief summary discussion follows on each of these parameters. \n \n\na. \n\nProject Performance \n\n59. \nThe  Project  will  be  assessed  against  its  specific  investment  capital,  construction, \noperational,  and  financial  objectives.  Essentially,  effectiveness  will  be  measured  against  how \nsuccessfully the Project (i) attracted capital (both debt and equity), (ii) secured fixed construction \ncosts  and  contracting  arrangements  for  on-time  construction  within  budget  and  specifications, \n(iii)  secured  suitable  operational  arrangements  to  enable  optimal  production  of  electricity  and \ndispatch  to  NTDC,  and  (iv)  was  profitable  as  measured  both  by  debt  repayment  capacity  and \ninvestor returns. \n \n\n \nb. \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\n60. \nThe Project will be assessed from an economic sustainability point of view on its ability \nto add needed generation capacity to the country\u2019s resources, in a least-cost manner and in an \nenvironmentally and socially acceptable way. In addition, the Project\u2019s outputs and contributions \nto the Government are considered, such as contributions to the economy via construction and \noperational  expenditures  and  employment  opportunities  created.  The  Project\u2019s  contribution  to \nsystem efficiency (via its competitive tariff) and sector reform are considered. \n \n\nc. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n61. \nThe  Project  will  be  assessed  and  measured  on  how  it  contributes  to  private  sector \ndevelopment. The focus of this assessment is on the Project\u2019s commercial and financial viability \nand  its  lasting  demonstrative  and  catalytic  effect  on  future  private  sector  developments  in  the \nsector  itself  (with  particular  note  of  its  demonstrative  role  as  the  first  private  hydel  project  in \nPakistan) and the economy as a whole. \n \n\n                                                 \n12  The  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  was  established  by  multilateral  development  banks  to  design  common \nevaluation  standards  for  private  sector  operations.  This  work  is  ongoing,  and  some  aspects  of  the  evaluative \nframework may be subject to change according to best practices. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\nThe project was not specifically assessed from an investment profitability point of view, as \n62. \na  profitability  assessment  is  better  gauged  and  measured  against  a  portfolio  of  similar  loans. \nSimilarly, the Project was not assessed and measured against overall operational effectiveness, \nas this is a department-wide consideration.  \n \n63. \nThe  EPC  cost,  which  is  the  major  portion  of  the  project  cost,  is  expected  to  be \ndenominated  largely  in  dollars.  It  is  intended,  subject  to  market  conditions  and  economic \nconstraints, that the funding be provided in a combination of dollars and Pakistani rupees. \n \nE. \n \n64. \nThe economic analysis attempts to quantify the net benefits the Project generates for the \nPakistani  economy  in  the  context  of  the  present  and  projected  electricity  demand  and  supply \nbalance.  The  Project\u2019s  capacity  output  is  considered  incremental  and  non-tradable.  The \nincremental benefit is calculated using the Project\u2019s quantity output. Output was based on 426 \nGWh\u2014ignoring an additional potential 95 GWh output based on increased and better regulated \nflows expected on completion of the Mangla Raise Project being undertaken by WAPDA\u2014and \nan  average  end-user  tariff.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis,  a  consumer  surplus  was  not \nconsidered,  as  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  demonstrate  a  sufficiently  robust  economic  result.  The \nincremental  project  benefit,  due  to  the  non-tradable  nature of  electricity,  was  adjusted  using  a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.9. The incremental benefit was considered in light of economic \ncosts,  namely  capital  expenditures,  O&M  costs,  and  transmission  and  distribution  costs.  No \nhydro  costs  or  water  charges  were  considered  due  to  there  being  no  opportunity  cost  of  the \nwater  used  by  the  Project.  Similarly,  the  Project  is  located  on  uninhabited  scrubland,  so  the \nopportunity cost of the land used is considered nil. No resettlement issues or costs attach to the \nProject. \n \n65. \nThe  resulting  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  strong  and  is  an  important  conclusion \ngiven  that,  while  the  Project  itself  represents  a  negotiated  investment  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Hydel  Policy  1995,  significant  economic  benefits  will  accrue  to  Pakistan  as  a \nresult of the Project. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ASSISTANCE \n\nLoan \n\nA. \n \n66. \nThe  proposed  loan  of  up  to  $37.3  million  without  government  guarantee  from  the \nordinary capital resources of ADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  amount  will  be  determined  so  that  ADB\u2019s  total \nexposure  to  the  Project  will  not  exceed  ADB  PSOD\u2019s  single-transaction  limit  of  25%  of  total \nproject cost. \n \nB. \n \n67. \n \n\nThe Project merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons:  \n\nJustification for Assistance \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Project  will  help  Pakistan  meet  growing  demand  for  electricity,  which  is \nessential  for  economic  growth,  in  a  least-cost  manner  by  generating  renewable \nenergy with no detrimental environmental or social impacts.   \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  strategy  of  encouraging  private \nThe  Project  supports \nparticipation in the power sector, and especially in hydropower generation, where \nPakistan is  deemed to  have a  very strong competitive advantage.  As  well as the \naddition of generating capacity, the Project will help ameliorate the balance of the \ndeclining  hydro/thermal  generation  mix  in  Pakistan,  which  is  an  objective  of \nWAPDA and the Government. \nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  and  energy  sector  strategies,  which \nemphasize  supporting  energy  infrastructure  development  with  private  sector \nparticipation  and  environmentally  clean  technology.  It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s \nthematic  priorities  of  private  sector  development,  sustainable  economic  growth, \nand environmental sustainability. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s public sector \noperations, which have assisted the Government\u2019s effort to restructure the power \nsector to attract more private sector investments, and ADB\u2019s emphasis on pro-poor \neconomic development in AJ&K. \nThrough the Project, ADB will be able to endorse best practices in infrastructure \ndevelopment.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  provide  a  benchmark  to  other \nhydropower generators and will contribute to the development and reform of the \npower sector.  \nADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  Project  will  enable  and  support  local  and  overseas \nequity  investment  in  the  Project  and  catalyze  local  and/or  overseas  sources  of \ndebt  capital.  The  Project  also  promotes  combining  conventional  and  Sharia-\ncompliant debt facilities for infrastructure projects. \nThe Project will help to support Pakistan\u2019s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and \nthe  development  of  the  CDM  markets,  which  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  thematic \ninterests. \n\nVI. \n\nINVESTMENT LIMITS \n\nThe proposed loan, which is PSOD\u2019s 39th in Pakistan, would, if approved by the Board, \n68. \nincrease PSOD total exposure13 to Pakistan from 2.05% to 4.57%, and increase infrastructure \nsector exposure from 51.37% to 52.62%. The proposed loan is within ADB\u2019s aggregate country, \nindustry, and single-project exposure limits for private-sector projects.14\n\nVII.  ASSURANCES \n\n \n\nA framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \n69. \nto its equity investments, lending operations, and guarantee operations in the private sector is in \neffect  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  ADB.15  Consistent  with  the  agreement \nestablishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  will  be  requested  to \nconfirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  Laraib.  No  funding  will  be \ndisbursed  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.  ADB  will  also  obtain  appropriate  assurances \nfrom Laraib in the financing documents customary to transactions of this nature including those \nrelevant to related party transactions.   \n\n                                                 \n13 Exposure refers to drawn and undrawn portions of PSOD committed loans, equity investments, and guarantees as \nof 31 March 2005, which is the latest data currently available. An investment is considered committed when there   \nare signed legal agreements.  \n\n14 These exposure limits are set in the Operations Manual, Section D10/BP, paras. 15\u201322. \n15 Letters dated 21 June 1983, 9 December 1985, and 17 July 2002 between ADB and the Ministry of Finance and       \n\nEconomic Affairs.  \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n70. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $37,300,000 to Laraib Energy Limited \nfor  the  New  Bong  Escape  Hydropower  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 15 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this  report,  and  as  may  be  reported  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n31 October 2005 \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n18 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nPOWER SECTOR IN PAKISTAN \n\nlegislative \n\nSector Framework and Reform \n\nPower  sector  policies  and  related \n\n \nA. \n \nElectricity represents 16.3% of the total final energy consumption in Pakistan. The power \n1. \nsector,  which  encompasses  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity,  is \ngoverned and regulated under the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) Act of \n1997. NEPRA, which was constituted as an independent entity, is exclusively empowered under \nthe act and related rules to regulate all facets of the power sector. NEPRA is thus empowered to \n(i)  grant  licenses  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  (ii)  approve  tariffs,  rates,  and \ncharges across the sector; (iii) establish uniform industry performance via codes and standards; \nand (iv) enforce the above. NEPRA, although mandated as an independent entity, is governed \nby  a  chairman  and  four  members,  all  of  whom  are  appointed  by  the  Government,  with  the \nmembers recommended by, and representing, provincial interests. \n \n2. \nframeworks  are  developed  and \nimplemented by the Government via the Ministry of Water and Power. The Government initiated \nthe  process  of  power  sector  reforms  and  restructuring  in  the  early  1990s  on  the  advice  of  the \nWorld  Bank.  The  power  sector  restructuring  and  reform  process,  developed  in  various  stages \nand through different initiatives, is reflected today in various policies, such as the Power Policy \n1994, Hydel Policy 1995, Transmission Line Policy 1995, Power Policy 1998, and Power Policy \n2002. These were designed, to a large extent, to attract private sector participation in a newly \nrestructured power sector. In addition, the NEPRA Act was promulgated to provide the overall \nregulatory umbrella for the sector. Finally, the Government is today undertaking the unbundling \nof  the  Pakistan  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  into  various  independent \nentities. The broad objectives of all these policies have been to (i) bring efficiencies across the \nentire  sector  via  competitive  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  with  appropriate \nindependent regulatory oversight; (ii) rationalize prices and subsidies; and (iii) encourage private \ncapital formation and investment to meet growing electricity demand. \n \n3. \nThe power sector, as a result of the policies and reforms referenced above, has been, \nand continues to be, in transition and is today semi-privatized and semi-deregulated. The power \nsector  has  historically  been  characterized  by  very  significant  Government  control  through  the \nWAPDA  and  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Corporation  (KESC)  monopolies  (which  function  as \nvertically  integrated  utilities  encompassing  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution)  and  by \nboth  significant  inefficiency,  with  losses  in  excess  of  25%,  and  inability  to  meet  demand.  This \ncharacterization,  at  least  in  terms  of  outright  Government  control,  has  changed  over  the  last \ndecade,  and  Pakistan \nthrough \nindependent  power  producers  (IPPs),  which  together  represent  in  excess  of  30%  of  total \ngeneration  capacity\u2014and  where  KESC  has  recently  been  privatized.  The  evident  success  in \nattracting  private  sector  generators  was  not  without  issues,  and  most  IPPs  ended  up  in \nsometimes  acrimonious  contract  disputes  with  the  Government  and  WAPDA.  These  disputes \nwere  largely  driven  by  a  significant  capacity  overhang  in  the  mid-to-late  1990s  (the  exact \nopposite  situation  of  today)  and  consequent  tariff  implications.  Notwithstanding  discord,  these \ndisputes  have  ultimately  been  settled  amicably  with  minimal  adjustments  to  the  contracts.  In \nhindsight,  the  terms  of  the  contracts,  although  renegotiated,  were  ultimately  honored,  which \nprovides a degree of comfort in the present investment environment. \n \nSignificant  reforms  are  today  well  underway  with  the  aim  of  breaking  WAPDA\u2019s  Power \n4. \nWing  into  multiple  and  discreet  generation  and  distribution  units,  and  by  placing  WAPDA\u2019s \ntransmission  assets  into  a  single  corporatized  entity,  the  National  Transmission  and  Dispatch \n\ntoday  enjoys  significant  private  sector-led  generation \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n19\n\nCompany  Limited  (NTDC).  NTDC  will  assume  the  additional  function  of  acting  as  the  single-\nbuyer of wholesale generation from multiple companies in the market (but excluding KESC) for \nonward  transmission  and  sale  to  multiple  distribution  entities,  in  addition  to  responsibilities  as \nmarket  and  system  operator  as  an  interim  step  to  a  fully  competitive  electricity  market.  The \nsingle-buyer  model  now  being  implemented  will  ultimately  evolve  into  a  multiple-buyer  and \nmultiple-seller regime where generators and distributors can contract directly. It is important to \nnote  that  existing  IPPs  and  those  already  approved  and  under  development  will  be \ngrandfathered  under  their  respective  enabling  legislative  schemes  and  thus  preserve  their \ncontractual  frameworks,  including  tariff  structures.  Such  is  the  case  for  the  Project,  which  will \ncontinue  to  be  implemented  under  the  Hydel  Policy  1995  with  a  25-year  power  purchase \nagreement with NTDC and the benefit of a Government guarantee. \n \n5. \nbut only partly implemented, as shown in Figure A1.1. \n \n\nThe following depicts the proposed structure of the power sector, as currently envisaged \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n20 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nn\no\n\n \n \n \n \n    \n     \n  \n  \n     \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n\na\nr\ne\nn\ne\nG\n\n \n \n\ni\nt\n\n    \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n    \n\n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\ni\n\ni\n\nn\no\ns\ns\nm\ns\nn\na\nr\n\n   T\n\n \n\n     \n\n \n\n   \n\n \nFigure A1.1: Present State of Pakistan\u2019s Power Sector \n \n  \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n  \nWAPDA \n \n(Power Wing)   \n \nHydel \n \n  \n\nSOUTHERN GENCO \nNORTHERN GENCO \nCENTRAL GENCO \nLAKHRA GENCO \n\n  \nIPPs \n  \n\n  \nKESC \n  \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n  \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n  \n \nNTDC (Ex-WAPDA) \n  \n\n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n \n \n \n      \n  \n\n      \n\n     \n\n \n\n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  \n    \n  \n    \n        \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  \n  \n\n  \n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \nPRODUCERS    \n  \n  \n\n  \nSMALL \nPOWER \n\n  \n\n \n \n \n \n     \n     \n \n \n  NUCLEAR   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n     \n \n  \nKESC \n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n    \n\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n     \n\n \nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\n\ni\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  \n  \n  \n\n \n \n     \n\n \n \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n \n \n      \n                Lahore Electric Supply Co.

NEPRA  is  responsible  for  determining  tariffs  under  its  Tariff  Standards  and \nProcedures Rules of 1998, which specify standards by which tariffs are set, and procedures by \nwhich tariffs are adjudicated. These standards are sufficiently broad to allow discretion and thus \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\nenable  the  development  of  various  tariff  regimes.  Tariff  determinations  are  based  on  the \nprinciple  of  recovering  prudently  incurred  costs  and  returns  on  the  applicant\u2019s  rate  base, \napplicable  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  They  contain  certain  automatic  quarterly  increases  on \naccount of changes in fuel costs or purchased power costs, as the case may be, in addition to \nmacroeconomic  indexation  of  costs.

WAPDA\u2019s Power Wing, in collaboration with both WAPDA\u2019s Energy Wing Planning and \nDevelopment  Division  and  the  Government,  developed  several  long-term  electricity  demand \nload projections for the WAPDA system (comprising about 87% of total electricity consumption \nin Pakistan, but excluding KESC), which confirm the above projections. Its medium base case \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23\n\nscenario forecast assumes growth in peak load of about 5% per annum to 2010, compared to \nPPIB\u2019s  projected  growth  from  2004  to  2010  of  6.8%.  In  conjunction  with  this  exercise,  and  in \norder  to  meet  demand,  WAPDA  developed  a  least-cost  Generation  Expansion  Plan,  which \nemphasizes  indigenous  sources  of  energy  such  as  coal  and  hydro  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s power-sector policies.

NTDC lies at \nthe center of the power sector today with a distinct corporate identity. NTDC is one of 12 newly \ncorporatized  entities  that  were  previously  part  of  the  Pakistan  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority  (WAPDA).  In  addition  to  NTDC,  eight  distribution  companies  and  three  thermal \ngenerating  companies  have  been  established,  with  WAPDA  itself  retaining  hydroelectric \ngeneration  assets.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  corporatize  these  entities  with  the  final \nobjective of privatizing the generators and the distributors. NTDC  will, however, remain wholly \nowned  by  the  Government  given  its  critical  central  roles  as  the  sole  national  transmission \nnetwork, dispatch coordinator, and market operator. \n \n2. \nNTDC was incorporated on 6 November 1998 and commenced commercial operation on \n1 March 1999. It was organized to take over all the properties, rights, assets, obligations, and \nliabilities  of the  220  kV and  500  kV  grid  station  and  transmission  lines and  network  owned  by \nWAPDA.  NTDC was granted Transmission License No. TL/01/2002 on 31 December 2002  by \nthe  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA)  to  engage  in  the  exclusive \ntransmission  business  for  a  term  of  30  years,  pursuant  to  section  17  of  the  Regulation  of \nGeneration, Transmission, and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 1997 (NEPRA Act 1997). This \n30-year  license  calls  for  NTDC  to  undertake  three  specific  functions:  (i)  the  transmission \noperations of  the  high  voltage  power  network  (220  kV  and  500  kV  voltage  capacity),  normally \nreferred to as the wire business; (ii) the dispatch of all power generation linked to the national \ngrid;  and  (iii)  the  single  purchaser/seller  of  power  between  generators,  including  independent \npower  producers  (IPPs)  and  distributors,  with  the  notable  exception  of  the  Karachi  Electric \nSupply Corporation (KESC), which conducts its own purchase and distribution functions within \nits franchise area but is also able, as a distributor, to purchase from NTDC. Although the power \ntrading  activities  are  major  new  responsibilities  for  NTDC,  the  company  has  to  maintain  and \nincrease  its  focus  on  the  wire  business  in  terms  of  design  and  planning,  as  well  as  the \nsubsequent expansions, with a view to meeting the requirements of a competitive power trading \nmarket. These considerations are similar in the case of its dispatch function. The focus of NTDC \nin  terms  of  dispatch  has  changed  from  the  integrated  utility  operations  within  WAPDA  of  the \npast to the single-buyer model of today, which will evolve into a competitive economic dispatch \nmodel in due course. \n \n3. \nDistributors  will  place  their  demands  on  NTDC  through  their  power  acquisition  or \nexpansion  programs  by  indicating  additional  demand  for  load  growth  and  new  bulk  load \nadditions. Similarly, the generators will intimate their intention to offer generation capacity in the \nfuture.  In  the  constantly  changing  equation  of  demand  and  supply  (i.e.,  generation),  NTDC  is \nbeing  licensed  as  a  transporter  of  power  from  generation  companies  to  distributors  able  to \nmaintain an optimal balance between generation and demand by ensuring adequate capacity, \nat  all  times,  under  all  system  conditions.  NTDC\u2019s  function  is  critical  as  neither  generation \ncompanies nor distribution companies may have sufficient overall information to plan the entire \ntransmission system. Moreover, all distributors will be required to inform NTDC about their load \nforecasts, along with the locations and amount of expected load growth, and other information \nregarding their transmission requirements. As a result, NTDC will be able to plan and develop \nan adequate, reliable, and cost-effective transmission system and, in addition, provide the most \ncost  effective  means  of  locating  additional  generation  to  meet  expected  demand.  To  ensure \nadequate generation capacity at all times, NTDC is required to publicly announce its generation \ncapacity expansion plan and preferred sites for generation additions, to assist policymakers in \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nproposing the most economic generation and potential investors in making decisions about their \ninvestment in generation. \n \n4. \nPrior to the commencement of a fully competitive market, NTDC has been designated as \nthe  procurer  of  power  on  behalf  of  ex-WAPDA  distributors  according  to  their  demand.  NTDC \nwill\u2014after  the  fully  competitive  market  is  implemented  and  where  generators  and  distributors \nmay  contract  directly,  as  specified  under  sub-article  (2)  of  the  NEPRA  Act  1997\u2014procure \nelectric power for balancing services only. However, an important feature is the preservation of \ncontracts previously entered into between the generators and WAPDA/NTDC, which are backed \nby  the  sovereign  guarantee  of  the  Government  of  Pakistan.  This  grandfathering  of  contracts \nalso  applies  to  the  New  Bong  Escape  Hydroelectric  Project  (the  Project),  which  is  being \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  previously  enacted  policies  and  so  benefits  from  a \nGovernment\u2019s guarantee of NTDC\u2019s obligations under its power purchase agreement. \n \n5. \nOperationally, NTDC links power generation units and load centers around the country, \nthus  creating  one  of  the  largest  contiguous  grid  systems  in  the  world.  It  is  responsible  for \npurchasing  the  power  from  hydroelectric  stations  located  in  the  north  and  thermal  units  in  the \npublic  and  private  sectors,  installed  mostly  in  the  central  and  southern  regions  of  the  country, \nand for selling power to the nine distribution companies. The large power transportation network \nis  composed  of  transmission  lines  and  grid  stations  of  500  kV  and  220  kV  voltage  capacities. \nNTDC is also responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the transmission \nfacilities  throughout  the  country  except  the  area  served  by  KESC  (Karachi  and  the  Lasbela \ndistrict of Balochistan Province). The company also constructs 132 kV and 66 kV grid stations \nand  transmission  lines  for  the  distribution  companies.  NTDC  currently  operates  and  maintains \nnine  500  kV  and  twenty-four  220  kV  grid  stations  along  with  10,167  kilometers  of  associated \ntransmission  lines.    NTDC\u2019s  functions  and  capabilities  include  (i)  design  and  engineering \nservices for the construction of transmission lines and grid stations; (ii) comprehensive system \noperation and specialized technical assistance to power sector participants; and (iii) the proper \ndesign, application, and functioning of a protective relay system. \n \n6. \nAlthough  NTDC  has  very  significant  assets  inherited  from  WAPDA  and  is  an \nindispensable part of the national power sector and system, NTDC\u2019s corporatization process is \nstill under development. In this light, NTDC derives the necessary financial strength to operate \nand meet its obligations from its full Government ownership and, in the case of the Project, full \nand  explicit  Government  guarantees  of  its  obligations.  NTDC  is  accordingly  regarded  as  a \nquasi-sovereign/sovereign entity with financial capacity equivalent to that of the Government of \nPakistan. \n \n7. \nin Table A2. \n\nNTDC\u2019s audited balance sheets for the fiscal year ends of 2003 and 2004 are presented \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTable A2:  National Transmission and Dispatch Co.

The  proposed  New  Bong  Escape  Hydropower  Project  (the  Project),  with  a  generation \ncapacity of 79 megawatts (MW), is to be constructed on a 21.3 hectare site on the left bank of \nthe Jhelum River 7.5 kilometers (km) downstream of Mangla Dam in Azad Jammu and Kashmir \n(AJ&K), about 120 km from Islamabad. The Project was initially conceived with a capacity of 45 \nMW  and  received  environmental  and  social  clearance  from  the  national  and  provincial \nenvironmental agencies on 20 August 1996 and 6 January 1997, respectively. The clearance for \nthe enhanced capacity was reconfirmed by the  provincial environmental agency on 23 August \n2004  subject  to  the  condition  that  sewage  from  residential  and  office  premises  would  be \nsubjected to proper treatment.    \n \n2.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  B.  No  people  reside  on  the  Project  site,  and  no \nindigenous people live in the surrounding area. Therefore, relocation and indigenous people are \nnot  issues.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  by  the  project  sponsor \nduring  October\u2013November  2004  to  update  and  reconfirm  the  previous  findings  on  the \nenvironmental  and  social  soundness  of  the  Project,  and  a  summary  IEE  was  prepared  as  a \nstandalone  document  for  public  disclosure.  Only  the  main  IEE  findings  are  summarized  and \npresented in this report and recommendation to the President. \n\nDescription of the Project  \n\n \nB. \n \n3.  The Project facilities will consist of inlet, headrace channel, power house, tailrace channel, \nswitchyard, and houses for about 50 operational personnel; public utilities, including a sewage \ntreatment  plant;  and  a  bridge  crossing  the  headrace  channel.  Technical  features  of  major \nfacilities are summarized below. \n\n \n\nProject Facility \n\nHeadrace channel \n\nRoad bridge \n\nTailrace channel \n\nTable A3: Technical Features of Major Project Facilities \n \nTechnical Features \n\nCapacity: 1,080 m3/sec, length: 500  m, bed width: 78 m, bed \nslope: 1:6,000, concrete lining \n\nOrdinary reinforced concrete road bridge spanning the headrace \nchannel \nCapacity: 1,392 m3/sec, length: 4,136  m, bed width: 91 to 152 m, \nbed slope: 1:4,000 \n\nTailrace embankment \n\nLength: 4,663  m, height: 6 m, top width 122 m, side slope 1:1.75, \nstone pitching \n\nPowerhouse  \n\nWidth: 66 m, length: 67 m, operating head 10\u201313 m, design flow: \n1,023\u20131,136 m3/sec \nLength: 1,040 m, width: 61 m \n\nNew Bong Escape \nchannel embankment \nm = meter, m3/sec = cubic meters per second. \nSource: Laraib Energy Limited. \n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n4.  The Project is a run-of-the-river hydropower scheme. It will divert water currently discharged \nfrom  the  Mangla  powerhouse  through  the  New  Bong  Escape  structure,  into  the  new  project \nheadrace  channel  to  drive  four  sets  of  low-head  bulb  turbine  generators  before  returning  the \nwater into the river through the project tailrace channel. The electricity generated will be fed into \nthe  existing  132  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  passing  over  the  site.  The  Project  tailrace \nchannel will be constructed to develop additional head by excavating the Hari Channel, one of \nseveral  channels  of  the  Jhelum  River,  to  further  drop  its  water  level  and  create  an  operating \nhead  of  about  10\u201313  meters  (m)  on  the  turbines.  The  spoil  from  excavation  of  the  tailrace \nchannel  will  be  used  for  flood  protection  through  construction  of  an  embankment  running \nparallel  to  the  tailrace  channel.  An  embankment  will  also  be  constructed  along  the  New  Bong \nEscape channel to divert the flow to the main channel to  the Jhelum River.  \n \n5.  The Project will be constructed on a design-and-build basis. An engineering, procurement, \nand construction (EPC) contractor will be awarded a comprehensive contract covering detailed \ndesign,  civil  works  construction,  installation  of  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  and \nmachines, test run, and commissioning. Description of the Environment  \n \n\n1. \n\nNatural Environment  \n\n \n6.  The Project site, owned by the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) as part of \nthe  Mangla  Dam  project  in  the  1960s,  is  vacant  land  with  shrubs  and  few  trees  and  no \narchaeological  sites,  graveyards,  or  mosques.  The  project  area  is  a  part  of  the  Jhelum  Valley \nand is in an active seismic area. Consequently, the earthquake return period of 1,000 years will \nbe adopted in the design of the powerhouse and major project facilities.  \n \n7.  The  Jhelum  River  is  the  principal  water  resource  in  the  project  area,  with  a  mean  annual \nflow  of  about  28.37  billion  cubic  meters.  Its  flow  is  perennial  and  characterized  by  a  great \nfluctuation in its discharge, with large flows during wet monsoons. The Jhelum River drains into \nthe  Mangla  Dam  Reservoir.  The  water  in  the  reservoir  is  used  to  generate  electricity  in  the \nMangla powerhouse, with a total generation capacity of 1,000 MW. The water from the Mangla \nDam powerhouse is discharged into a tailrace channel, a man-made canal named Bong Canal. \nPart  of  the  flow  of  the  Bong  Canal  is  fed  into  the  Upper  Jhelum  Canal  to  meet  irrigation \nrequirements, and the remaining flow is discharged into the Jhelum River through a man-made \nstructure named the New Bong Escape.  \n \n8.  During  low  flows,  the  Jhelum  River  downstream  of  the  Mangla  Dam  meanders  in  several \nchannels through a very broad floodplain that is several kilometers wide in some locations. The \nJhelum River floodplain adjacent to the project site is more than 1,800 m in width. One of the \nchannels of the Jhelum River adjacent to the project site, called the Hari Channel, will be used \nas tailrace channel. This channel represents only a very small portion of the entire floodplain.  \n \n9.  As the project area is not densely populated and has no major industries, ambient air quality \nand water quality in the Jhelum River are high.  \n \n10. The project area has no ecological or biologically sensitive areas, as it has been subjected \nto human interventions for decades. Because of the degraded habitat conditions, the project site \nand its surroundings do not support any flora or faunal of ecological or economic significance.   \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 3\n\n29\n\n2. \n\nSocioeconomic Environment  \n\n \n11. There  are  21  communities  within  a  5  km  radius  of  the  project  site.  Only  two  communities, \nLehri  and  Ferozabad,  are  adjacent  to  the  project  site    and  could  be  impacted  by  it.  Some \nfamilies  in  these  two  villages  use  parts  of  the project site,  without  authorization  from  WAPDA, \nfor  fodder  cultivation  and  animal  grazing.  The  Project  will  need  to  discontinue  their  use  of  the \nproject site. \n \n12. Lehri  village  has  about  150  households,  of  which  around  a  dozen  are  involved  in \nunauthorized  use  of  parts  of  the  project  site.  An  overwhelming  majority  of  the  households  are \nfinancially  supported  by  relatives  living  in  foreign  countries,  especially  the  United  Kingdom. \nLocal  trade  and  government  and  private  employment  is  their  secondary  source  of  income. \nAgriculture  and  livestock  are  fringe  economic  activities,  practiced  at  a  level  that  is  even  less \nthan subsistence.   \n \n13. Ferozabad  village  has  only  about  12  houses  occupied  by  one  extended  local  family  and \nsome small families that have come to the area after being displaced by conflict in their native \nnortheastern  AJ&K.  The  primary  source  of  livelihood  for  these  families  is  employment  in  the \ngovernment and private sectors. Agriculture is a secondary economic activity. Young men from \na couple of families work abroad and remit money.   \n \n14. The social infrastructure and public amenities in the two villages are poor, as evidenced by \nunpaved roads and the absence of schools or clinics. The project proponent intends to assist in \nimproving social infrastructure and public amenities in these two villages.  \n \nC. \n \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nImpacts during Construction \n\n \n15. The  construction  of  project  facilities  will  inevitably  create  environmental  disturbances  and \nimpacts.  But  these  will  be  transient  and  have  no  adverse  ecological  consequences,  as  the \nproject  site  is  small  and  has  no  flora  or  fauna  species  of  ecological  importance.  Mitigation \nmeasures including physical measures and good environmental management practices will be \nincluded  in  the  EPC  contract  to  ensure  that  the  design  and  construction  minimize  such \nenvironmental  problems  as  disposal  of  excavated  materials,  soil  erosion  and  degradation, \nfugitive  dust,  noise,  safety  and  public  health  hazards,  waste  disposal,  water  turbidity  in  the \nJhelum  River  during  the  excavation  of  the  Hari  Channel,  and  blocked  access  to  houses  and \ncommunal facilities. \n \n16. In addition, the project sponsors are willing to pay compensation to those families that have \nto discontinue their unauthorized use of land in the project site. \n \n17. The Project will not induce population influx as the area experiences a general trend of out-\nmigration to larger towns and cities. During the detailed design, the project sponsors will consult \nwith  the  local  administration  for  advanced  planning  to  ensure  minimum  adverse  impacts  from \nany population influx. \n \n18. Although  the  Project  will  not  have  significant  adverse  social  impacts,  the  project  sponsors \nintend to help build social facilities in collaboration with the local agencies concerned.  \n \n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n1. \n \n\n \nD. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpacts During Operation \n\n \n19. The  Project  will  have  no  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts  during  the  operation \nphase, as it will not affect water availability in the Upper Jhelum Canal, and will not reduce the \nflows  in  the  Jhelum  River  downstream  of  the  New  and  Old  Bong  Escapes.  However,  after \nproject  completion,  the  New  Bong  Escape  channel  will  receive  water  only  in  case  of  the \nshutdown  of  the  project  powerhouse.  This  1,200  m  man-made  channel  has  no  ecological \nsignificance, and is not used by the local communities. Therefore, its drying up will not have any \nsignificant environmental or social impacts.  \n \n20. To ensure harmony of the Project with the environment, the project sponsor will implement \nsound  environmental  management  practices  to  effectively  handle  the  basic  environmental \nissues, including \n(i) \n\nwaste  management  of  residential  complex  and  offices,  particularly  sewage \ntreatment  to  the  required  standard  and  reuse  of  the  treated  effluents  for \ngardening;   \nwaste management of warehouse, workshops, and motor pools; \nlandscaping and plantation; \nenvironmentally responsible conduct of personnel, who will be expected to refrain \nfrom such activities as hunting and tree cutting; and  \nnoise and other public nuisance abatement. \n\n \n21. The above practices and conducts will be institutionalized in the environmental management \nsystem of the company. Appropriate undertakings and associated reporting requirement will be \nset out in the loan documentation.  \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan  \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan  \n\n22. A project environmental management plan (EMP) was formulated, and it clearly defines (i) \norganizational structure, (ii) the roles and responsibilities of the various entities concerned, (iii) \nan  impact  mitigation  plan,  (iv)  an  environmental  monitoring  plan,  (v)  communication  and \ndocumentation,  and  (vi)  environmental  training.  The  EMP  was  prepared  for  both  the \nconstruction phase and the operational phase.  \n \n23. As  the  mitigation  measures  are  part  of  the  construction,  their  costs  are  included  in  the \ncontract  cost  and  represent  only  a  very  small  part  of  the  project  cost.  The  cost  of  sewage \ntreatment facilities for 50 operating personnel is also low compared to the cost of houses. The \nproject  sponsor  has  budgeted  about  PRs7.4  million  to  meet  the  cost  of  environmental \nmanagement personnel and administrative expenses over the construction period. \n \n24. The  project  sponsors  will  assume  overall  responsibility \nthe \nenvironmental  and  social  management  requirements  of  the  provincial  government  and  the \nlenders.  The  EPC  contractor  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  the  environmental \nperformance of all the subcontractors, ensuring that the subcontractors effectively implement all \nenvironmental management measures stipulated in the EMP and in the contracts. The project \nmanager, representing the project sponsors, will discharge the project company\u2019s environmental \nand social responsibility as part of project implementation management. The project proponent \nwill  appoint  an  environmental  and  social  inspector  to  assist  the  project  manager  and  provide \n\nfor  compliance  with \n\n\fAppendix 3\n\n31\n\npolicy  support  on  all  environmental  and  social  matters.  The  project  proponent  will  coordinate \nwith  relevant  government  departments  and  other  stakeholders  through  its  environmental  and \nsocial inspector.  \n \n25. The EPC contractor will appoint an environmental and social supervisor to assist its project \nmanager in overseeing and monitoring the environmental performance of all the subcontractors. \nEach  subcontractor  will  appoint  an  environmental  and  social  officer  to  assist  its  resident \nengineer in implementing EMP aspects specific to its contract.  \n \n26. The  mitigation  plan  for  the  construction  phase  is  prepared  and  presented  in  the  IEE.  It \ncontains \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\na comprehensive listing of mitigation measures (actions), \nthe person(s) responsible for ensuring the full implementation of the action, \nthe persons responsible for monitoring the action, and \na timescale for the implementation of the action to ensure that the objectives of \nmitigation are fully met. \n\n \n\n27. The identified mitigation measures will be translated into environmental requirements and \nspecifications for the detailed design and construction, with legally binding effect.  \n \n28. Environmental  and  social  management  tasks  during  the  operational  phase  will  be  minimal \nand  become  routine  activities  as  part  of  the  overall  management  of  the  powerhouse.  \nManagement of wastes from residential quarters and offices will be the only main task.   \n \n\n2. \n\nMonitoring Plan \n\n \n29. During the construction phase, the environmental performance of all subcontractors will be \nclosely  monitored  by  the  EPC  contractor  under  the  oversight  of  the  project  sponsor.  The \nmonitoring  will  cover  both  compliance  monitoring  and  effects  monitoring  in  line  with  the \nrequirements in the mitigation plan focusing on soil erosion, water quality, air quality, noise, and \nsocioeconomic aspects. A detailed monitoring plan will be developed during the detailed design \nphase of the Project, when specific information on field activities will be known. The monitoring \nschedule will be linked to the construction schedule.  \n \n30. An  effective  mechanism  for  storing  and  communicating  environmental  information  will  be \nestablished.  The  data  and  information  will  be  systematically  filed  and  stored  in  a  central \nlocation. Periodic meetings of all parties concerned will review the implementation of the EMP \nand  monitoring  results  and  resolve  any  identified  problems.  The  EPC  contractor  will  produce \nperiodic  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports.  At  the  end  of  the  construction  phase,  the  EPC \ncontractor  will  prepare  a  final  monitoring  and  evaluation  report  to  be  a  part  of  a  Project \ncompletion report.  \n \n31. In addition, the EPC contractor will establish at the Project site a social complaint register to \ndocument  all  complaints  received  from  local  communities.  The  register  will  also  record  the \nmeasures taken to mitigate these concerns. All  community complaints received will be sent to \nthe  project  proponent\u2019s  environmental  and  social  inspector  and  project  manager  for  their \ninformation and further action.  \n \n32. The EPC contractor will provide training to the project sponsor staff, the subcontractors, and \nother  staff  engaged  for  the  Project.  Training  will  cover  the  requirements  of  the  IEE  and  EMP, \nwith special emphasis on sensitizing project staff to the environmental and social aspects of the \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nProject. A training program will be prepared before the commencement of the Project during the \ndetailed design phase.   \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure  \n\nE. \n \n33. A consultation was held on 30 October 2004 with representatives of government agencies \nconcerned  including  WAPDA,  the  Irrigation  Department  of  the  government  of  Punjab,  and  the \nprovincial  government\u2019s  Revenue  Department.  All  the  representatives  expressed  their  support \nfor the Project and willingness to cooperate.  \n \n34. A public consultation was held in Ferozabad on 1 November 2004. The public consultation \nteam visited seven houses that have been using the project site.  In each house visit, the public \nconsultation team explained the project layout, scope, and requirements as well as the impacts, \nparticularly on the unauthorized grazing and occasional cultivation on the project site practiced \nby some families. Their reactions to the various aspects of the Project were sought in a semi-\nstructured discussion. The villagers showed no concerns about environmental disturbances and \ninconveniences  that  the  Project  may  cause  during  construction,  since  they  had  similar \nexperiences  with  much  larger  projects  in  the  past.  The  affected  households  expressed  their \nwillingness  to  discontinue  their  unauthorized  use  of  the  project  site  but  expect  some \ncompensation.  \n \n35. In Lehri, a group consultation was held on 2 November 2004 involving about 16  household \nrepresentatives  that  have  been  using  the  project  site.  The  results  were  similar  to  those  of \nFerrozabad. \n \n36. The  outcomes  of  the  consultations  led  to  a  conclusion  that  the  Project  would  have  no \nsignificant  social  impacts.  The  small  extent  of  unauthorized  cultivation  and  grazing  does  not \nsignificantly  contribute  to  the  income  of  the  residents  of  Lehri  and  Ferozabad  villages.  The \ngrazing activity can be conveniently shifted to the adjacent areas.   \n \nF. \n \n37. The  IEE  findings  confirm  that  the  Project,  being  a  run-of-the-river  hydropower  project,  is \nunlikely  to  cause  any  significant,  lasting  environmental  or  social  impacts.  Environmental \ndisturbances  normally  associated  with  construction  activities  will  be  minimized  through \nimplementation  of  the  EMP  and  close  monitoring  of  its  implementation.  Sound  environmental \nmanagement practices and effective mitigation measures will be prescribed as part of the EPC \ncontract for detailed design and construction. \n \n38.
