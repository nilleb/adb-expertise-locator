The  report  also  describes  (i)  the  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be \nprovided by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation \nFund  (PRC  Fund),  and  (ii)  the  proposed  partial  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the \nAsian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank  (AIIB)  for  the  project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the grant and the loan. \n \n2. \nThe project will contribute to the goal of the Government of Bangladesh to achieve electricity \nfor all by 2021.1 It will improve the reliability and efficiency of the electricity supply in the Greater \nDhaka and western zone of Bangladesh by expanding the national transmission grid system and \nstrengthening the capacity of the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited (PGCB).2 The project \nwill  also  expand  regional  power  connectivity  in  western  Bangladesh.  Specifically,  it  will  support            \n(i) the construction of 40 kilometers (km) of transmission lines and 4,450 megavolt-amperes (MVA) \nof substations in Greater Dhaka; (ii) the construction of 368 km of transmission lines, 3,070 MVA of \nsubstations, and 20 bay extensions in the western zone; and (iii) the establishment of an enterprise \nresource planning (ERP) system and a drone inspection center to strengthen PGCB\u2019s capacity in \nasset management and operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEconomic  development.  Prudent  macroeconomic  management  helped  Bangladesh \nachieve  average  annual  GDP  growth  of  6.5%  during  fiscal  year  (FY)  2009  to  FY2018. 3 \nBangladesh reached lower-middle-income country status in FY2015, and gross national income per \ncapita  has  risen  steadily  from  $1,316  in  FY2015  to  $1,751  in  FY2018. 4  The  structure  of  the \nBangladesh economy is gradually shifting from agriculture to manufacturing and services. Poverty \nrate  has  been  halved  from  2000  to  2016,  and  the  country  has  met  many  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal targets.5 Building on these achievements, the government has set new priority \ntargets to (i) accelerate annual economic growth to 8.0% by 2021; (ii) create jobs and support rural \ndevelopment and inclusive growth to reduce poverty; (iii) reduce poverty rate to 18.6% by 2020, from \n24.8% in 2015 below the national poverty line, and reduce extreme poverty rate to 8.9% by 2020, \n\n                                                \n1   Government  of  Bangladesh,  Ministry  of  Planning,  Planning  Commission.  2012.

Western  zone  of  Bangladesh  comprises  of  the  divisions  of  Rangpur, \nRajshahi, Gopalganji, Khulna, and Barishal. \n\n3  Government of Bangladesh, Bureau of Statistics. http://www.bbs.gov.bd/ (accessed 15 January 2019). \n4   Footnote 3, and World Bank. Data: World Bank Country and Lending Groups.  \n\nhttps://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups  \n(accessed 8 March 2019). A country is classified as lower-middle-income if its gross national income per capita \naverages $996\u2013$3,895, and as upper-middle-income if it averages $3,896\u2013$12,055. \n\n5  The national poverty line is set to the threshold of a minimum intake of 2,122 kilocalorie per person per day of food, \nand the extreme poverty line is set to the threshold of living on less than $1.90 per person per day (2011 Purchasing \nPower Parity). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfrom  12.9%  in  2015  below  the  extreme  poverty  line  (footnote  5);  and  (iv)  reduce  environmental \ndegradation and reduce vulnerability to climate change.6 \n\n4. \nDespite its economic success, Bangladesh faces major challenges in maintaining growth \ntrends  and  reducing  poverty  because  of  infrastructure  deficiencies  in  the  energy  sector  and \nelsewhere. To address these deficiencies, the government is prioritizing the provision of modern, \nreliable, and affordable energy services to those who lack access.7 \n \nPower  generation  and access. The  energy  sector has  seen  considerable  progress  in \n5. \nincreasing generation capacity to meet the growing demand for electricity. Daily load shedding \ndropped  significantly  from  2,264  gigawatt-hours  in  FY2007  to  32  gigawatt-hours  in  FY2018. \nHowever,  the  sector  is  still  characterized  by  recurring  power  supply  shortages  in  the  face  of       \never-rising  demand  in  a  growing  economy.  In  FY2017,  the  estimated  peak  power  demand  in \nBangladesh was 12,644 megawatts (MW). However, the utilities in the electricity industry served \nonly  9,479  MW  of  this  demand.  While  commercial  and  industrial  consumers  met  a  significant \namount  of  the  remaining  demand  with  captive  generation,  a  portion  of  power  demand  was \ncurtailed  through  load  shedding.8 The  government  forecast  in  2016  that  planned  and  ongoing \npower generation projects would generate additional power exceeding 13,300 MW by 2020 and \n19,900 MW by 2025.9 With the government\u2019s effort to expand electrification, the country achieved \n91% electricity access in FY2018, although about 15 million people out of 163.7 million population \nin Bangladesh still lack access to electricity.  \n \n6. \nPower transmission. The power transmission system is solely owned and operated by \nPGCB. Investments to strengthen the power network and measures taken to reduce nontechnical \nlosses have resulted in a decline in overall system losses. However, interruptions (i.e., customers \nlose  access  to  electrical  grid)  resulting  from  transmission  system  issues  throughout  the \ntransmission network increased from 15 interruptions in FY2017 to 60 interruptions in FY2018, \nwith the cumulative duration of outages increasing from almost 20 hours to 80 hours (footnote 8). \nBecause  of  weakness  in  power  system  control  and  operation,  system  frequency  and  voltage \nfluctuate  beyond  established  standards,  which  causes  excessive  wear-and-tear  on  electrical \nequipment and interrupts the power supply. As the economy grows and the power grid becomes \nmore congested, upgrading and expanding the transmission network will be crucial.  \n \n7. \nRegional power connectivity. The power transmission grid is connected with India\u2019s grid \nand  Bangladesh  imports  1,000  MW  of  power  from  India  through  a  high  voltage  direct  current \nsubstation at Bheramara in the western zone. However, this power flows into the national power \ngrid via a 400-kilovolt (kV) to 230 kV transmission line without directly dispatching the power to \nlocal consumers in the western zone. To ensure that power interconnection operates at its full \ncapacity and that imported power is utilized across western Bangladesh, the transmission system \nwithin the western zone needs to be strengthened.  \n \n8. \nEnergy sector governance. PGCB is a state-owned enterprise incorporated as a public \nlimited company in 1996 under the Companies Act, 1994. The Bangladesh Power Development \nBoard (BPDB), a wholly government-owned entity, owns 76.25% of the share capital of PGCB, \n\n                                                \n6  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015.

PGCB has been listed \nin the Dhaka Stock Exchange and Chattgrom Stock Exchange since 2006. The authorized capital \nat the time of establishment was Tk10 billion.  \n\n \n\nthe  Power  System  Master  Plan  (footnote  9) \n\nGovernment  programs.  To  sustain  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  momentum,  the \n\nDespite  substantial  improvements  in  operational  and  financial  performance,  weak \n9. \nfinancial  management  capacity  within  PGCB  and  low-cost  recovery  tariffs  in  the  past  have \nimpaired its financial health. From FY2011 to FY2018, PGCB saw revenues increase because of \nincreased electricity sales. However, its after-tax profit margin shrank from FY2011 to FY2014, \nmainly  because  of  delayed  and/or  insufficient  increases  in  transmission  tariffs.  PGCB  had  a \nnegative after-tax profit margin of Tk29 million in FY2015. In September 2015, the government \nincreased the transmission tariff from 0.229 Tk/kWh to 0.279 Tk/kWh and PGCB realized a net \nprofit  from  FY2016  to  FY2018.  However,  given  the  need  for  increased  investments  in  the \ntransmission  system,  PGCB\u2019s  return  on  net fixed  assets  is  declining  in  the  absence  of  regular \ntransmission  tariff  adjustments.  Furthermore,  while  it  has  prioritized  transmission  system \nexpansion, PGCB needs to concentrate more on O&M to reduce transmission losses and ensure \nthe reliability and quality of the power supply. \n \n10. \ngovernment  has  prepared \npower-generation capacity, as well as improve and extend the power transmission and distribution \nnetwork,  with  the  aim  of  achieving  universal  access  to  electricity  by  2021.  Furthermore, \nBangladesh\u2019s Seventh Five Year Plan (footnote 6) envisages an integrated development strategy \nfor the Greater Dhaka area and western zone encompassing Dhaka, Khulna, and Barishal, which \nare  economic growth  centers.  Energy  reforms  have  led  to the  unbundling  of  the  power  supply \nindustry, resulting in (i) a reduction in overall system losses from more than 30% of generation in \nthe 1990s to 13%\u201315% of generation; (ii) the establishment of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory \nCommission  (BERC)  in  2004;  and  (iii)  approval  of  an  electricity  transmission  tariff  fixation \nmethodology in 2015 by the government.  \n \n11. \nAsian  Development  Bank  assistance  to  the  sector.  Since  the  mid-1990s  and  in \ncollaboration with development partners, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing \nextensive support for energy sector reforms in Bangladesh and the sustainable development of \nthe  sector,  including  support for the  creation of PGCB. This  support  has  resulted  in  significant \nimprovements in the operational and financial performance of the sector. As part of its strategy \nfor the sector, ADB has supported the corporatization and commercialization of energy entities \nas well as the expansion and upgrading of the power system as part of a least-cost expansion \nplan. ADB has been a key financier of PGCB\u2019s fast-expanding transmission investments.10 ADB \nand the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources are co-chairs of the Local Consultative \nGroup for the sector, which enhances the effectiveness of ADB assistance. The group facilitates \nenergy project cofinancing among development partners, conducts policy dialogue on addressing \ngrid code application issues, develops the financing strategy for PGCB, and works on building \nPGCB\u2019s  asset  registry.  ADB  is  now  turning  its  focus  towards  improving  PGCB\u2019s  financial \n\nto \n\n                                                \n10  ADB assistance includes the following: ADB. 2007.

This includes staffing finance positions in the company \nwith qualified personnel, addressing issues related to the fixed-asset registry, and seeking timely \ntariff adjustments through regular tariff filing. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, \n2016\u22122020 highlights ADB\u2019s support for easing infrastructure constraints in key sectors like the \nenergy sector.11 With increasing demand for a reliable and high-quality power supply, not only \ndoes PGCB need to invest in new transmission infrastructure but it also needs to improve its O&M \npractices, which directly impact the reliability and quality of the power supply. ADB\u2019s continued \nengagement in the energy sector, particularly at PGCB, will help address these issues.  \n \n12. \nLessons learned. ADB\u2019s experience in transmission system projects in South Asia have \nshown that the success and sustainability of projects hinge on (i) advanced planning and detailed \nproject  preparation;  (ii)  strong  capacity  of  the  executing  agencies  in  project  preparation, \nprocurement, \n(iii) incorporating O&M requirements at the early stage of project design and implementation. The \nproject team will incorporate these lessons in the implementation of the proposed project. \n \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB  will  add  value  by  developing  capacity  and \n13. \nintroducing  high-level  technology  applications  at  PGCB.  In  the  Southwest  Transmission  Grid \nExpansion  Project  approved  in  2018,  ADB  assisted  PGCB  in  using  high-temperature  low-sag \nconductors  and  developing  a  detailed,  time-bound  action  plan  to  implement  an  enterprise \nresource  planning (ERP)  system.12 ADB  will  help  equip  PGCB\u2019s  workforce with  technical  skills \nalong with new and advanced technologies to modernize and maintain the power transmission \ninfrastructure. As a continuation of this effort, the project will finance the use of high- temperature \nlow-sag  conductors  to \nimprove  reliability  and  efficiency  of  electricity  supply  and  the \nimplementation of the ERP system to improve PGCB\u2019s information flow, financial capacity, and \noptimization of corporate operations. In addition, the proposed PRC Fund grant will pilot a drone \ninspection  center  to  support  high-level  technology  application  and  digitize  PGCB\u2019s  operations, \nwhich  will  improve  O&M  efficiency  and  enhance  system  reliability.  The  proposed  project \ncomplements  the  activities  of  development  partners  in  Bangladesh.  Further  details  are  in  the \ndevelopment coordination and financial management assessment.13 \n \n14. \nAlignment with ADB\u2019s priorities (including Strategy 2030). The project is aligned with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020, which maps out ADB\u2019s support \nfor  government  efforts  to  expand  power  generation  capacity,  improve  the  efficiency  of \ntransmission and distribution networks, and expand regional interconnections (footnote 11). The \nproject  supports  five  operational  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030:  (i)  accelerating  progress  in \ngender  equality  by  encouraging  PGCB  to  employ  women  and  supporting  women\u2019s  capacity \ndevelopment  at  the  drone  inspection  center  and  within  PGCB\u2019s  finance  division;  (ii)  tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability by supporting the climate- and disaster-resilient design of high-temperature low-sag \nconductors  and  indoor  gas-insulated  substations  (GIS); 14  (iii)  making  cities  more  livable  by \n\n                                                \n11 ADB. 2016.

PGCB  is  the  executing \nagency of the project. The proceeds of the ADB loan will be re-lent to PGCB under a subsidiary \nloan agreement, with terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  applies  to  all  ADB-  and  non-ADB-financed  components  under  the  project.  PGCB  will \nprocure goods, equipment, civil works, and consultants financed by ADB, AIIB, and the PRC Fund \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nProcurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will \nreview and partially administer procurement packages financed by the AIIB loan per the ADB\u2013\nAIIB cofinancing agreement. Advance contracting is allowed. Universal procurement applies to \nthe project. In accordance with the prevailing law of Bangladesh, bidders may be excluded from \nparticipating in procurement under the project if they are from countries with which Bangladesh \nprohibits  commercial  relations,  provided  that  ADB  is  satisfied  that  such  exclusion  does  not \npreclude effective competition in relation to such procurement.

ADB,  AIIB,  and  the  transaction  technical  assistance \nconsultants  reviewed  the  project  list  presented by  PGCB for  compliance  with  best  practices  in \ntransmission planning and projects. PGCB finalized the list of transmission lines and substations \nthat are proposed in the project against the forecast power demand of each division. The voltage \nlevels,  technology,  and  equipment  proposed  under  the  project  are  compatible  with  PGCB\u2019s \nexisting  standards  and  practices.  PGCB  will  adhere  to  international  standards  in  specifying, \ntesting, and commissioning the equipment procured under the project. To address issues related \nto climate change such as flooding and heat dissipation, PGCB incorporated high-temperature \nlow-sag  conductors  and  GIS  in  the  project  design.  Both  technologies  have  been  used  in \nBangladesh in the past, and PGCB has the know-how to incorporate these technologies. \n \nB. \n \nThe project team carried out an economic analysis of the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n28. \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 20  BPDB  is  developing  additional  power \ngeneration capacity to meet increasing demand for power. However, if no sufficient transmission \nand  distribution  infrastructure  is  available  to  evacuate  the  generated  electricity  to  consumers, \nincremental demand will have to be curtailed. In the \u201cwith-project\u201d scenario, electricity can flow to \nscattered  areas  and  will  be  used  to  meet  any  unserved  power  demand  through  expanded \ntransmission networks. In the \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario, loss of economic activities occurs in the \nabsence of a reliable power supply.  \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n20 ADB. 2017.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nThe economic analysis measured the costs and benefits of the project in constant 2019 \n29. \nprices, and confirmed that the project is economically viable. The overall economic internal rate \nof return for the project is 21.1% and its economic net present value is Tk70.843 billion. Removing \nenvironmental benefits, the overall economic internal rate of return for the project is 19.3% and \nits economic net present value is Tk58.101 billion. The economic analysis examined the project\u2019s \nsensitivity to adverse changes such as an increase in capital costs, a delay in commissioning, \nand  a  decrease  in  fuel  prices.  The  analysis  determined  that  the  project  remains  economically \nviable in the face of such changes.  \n \n30. \nThe project team carried out a financial analysis of the project in accordance with ADB's \nHandbook for Borrowers on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.21 The financial \nanalysis measured all financial costs and benefits in constant 2019 prices. The analysis assessed \nthe project\u2019s financial viability by comparing incremental costs with incremental benefits over the \nlife of the project. Incremental revenue for outputs 1 and 2 were based on incremental electricity \ntransmitted  over  the  project  assets.    The  incremental  electricity  wheeled  was  valued  at  the \nestimated  tariff  to  be  set  by  BERC  under  the  approved  transmission  tariff  methodology.22 The \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of the project is 1.80%. The analysis determined the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  investments  to  be  6.81%,  which  exceeds  the  weighted \naverage cost of capital. The analysis measured the sensitivity of the financial internal rate of return \nto adverse changes in underlying assumptions and determined the project to be financially viable.  \n \nC. \n \n31. \nADB  assessed the  executing  agency,  PGCB,  against  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and financial \nmanagement requirements. PGCB has significant experience in implementing projects financed \nby ADB, and is conversant with ADB\u2019s procurement processes and regulations. Procurement risk \nis rated low. The financial management risk is rated substantial (footnote 13). The project team \nproposed  mitigation  measures  in  the  financial  management  assessment.23 In  terms  of  funding \npolicy, PGCB has not committed to exit from concessional loans from development partners and \nthe government since the commercial financial market for infrastructure projects is not mature yet \nin Bangladesh. To meet its significant investment requirements, PGCB should develop a financing \nplan to tap both domestic and international financial markets. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly \nor through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nthe project. Procurement contracts financed by ADB are subject to prior ADB review and must \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the project.  \n \n32. \nPGCB has prepared an action plan to address the substantial financial management risk. \nThe  government  and  the  BERC  published  and  made  effective  electricity  transmission  and \ndistribution  tariff  regulations  in  June  2016.  These  regulations  established  a  transparent \nmechanism to periodically review and reset transmission tariffs to recover transmission costs and \nimprove  PGCB\u2019s  financial  sustainability.  PGCB  has  executed  similar  projects  before  and  is \ncapable of managing the fund flow, disbursement procedures, accounting, and financial reporting \nunder the project. Mitigation measures to be taken to address key financial management risks \ninclude  the  appointment  of  additional  staff  in  the  finance,  accounting,  and  internal  audit \ndepartments of PGCB. The project will support auditors of PGCB to issue qualified audit opinions \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2005.  Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

Based on these opinions, PGCB will \ncome up with a time-bound action plan to improve its audit function, including compilation of a \nfixed-asset registry; strengthening the internal audit department (including the appointment of a \ngeneral manager); and implementing the ERP that will be financed under the project to address \nrisks posed by the existing manual accounting system.  \n \n33. \nERP  is  an  integrated  information  technology  system  that  will  help  strengthen  PGCB\u2019s \ncapabilities to manage its assets. The ERP system will standardize PGCB\u2019s business processes \nto  improve  transparency  and  improve  PGCB\u2019s  internal  controls, creating greater  accountability \nand governance within PGCB.  \n \n34. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and PGCB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. The project team conducted integrity due diligence and did not identify \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risks.  \n \nD. \n \n35. \nOut  of  a  population  of  163.7  million  in  2018,  21.8%  of  the  population  lived  below  the \nnational  poverty  line,  a  decline  from  31.5%  in  2010.  Faster  economic  growth,  increasing \nurbanization,  rising  labor  productivity  and  wages,  a  shift  from  low-return  agricultural  labor  to \nnonfarm employment, and growth in export industries have underpinned the decline in poverty. \nAccess to  a  reliable  supply  of  electricity  is  an  important  input  to  economic growth  and  poverty \nreduction. \n \n36. \nThe major benefit of the project will be improved access to electricity and improved delivery \nof reliable power to support sustained economic growth and reduce poverty. Improved access to a \nreliable electricity supply will promote business expansion and create employment opportunities for \nlocal communities, including the poor and socially disadvantaged. The project will also generate \njobs  for  local  communities  during  construction  as  a  direct  benefit.  Furthermore,  the  capacity \ndevelopment program under output 3 of the project will improve human resources development in \nthe energy sector. \n \n37. \nThe project is categorized as having some gender elements. Under output 3, the project \nwill directly support women\u2019s employment and capacity development in PGCB\u2019s finance division \nand in the drone inspection center. PGCB will ensure compliance with national labor laws, with \nno child labor employed. The contractors will educate workers through a PGCB training program \non the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. With ADB\u2019s support, gender \ntraining  is  envisaged  for  the  executing  agency  and  its  contractors  to  prevent  issues  related  to \nsexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse.  \n \nE. \n \n38. \nare as follows.24 \n \n39. \nEnvironment  (category  B).

PGCB and the project team conducted meaningful \nconsultations, with project information disclosed locally and on ADB\u2019s website. The IEE includes \nan environmental management plan for outputs 1 and 2. The project team disclosed the IEE on \nthe  ADB  website  on  12  July  2019.  PGCB  is  committed  to  implementing  the  environmental \nmanagement plan under the IEE, and this plan will be sufficient to mitigate potential environmental \nimpacts.  PGCB  and  ADB  agreed  to  closely  monitor  environmental  impacts  during  project \nimplementation and for PGCB to submit environmental monitoring reports to ADB semiannually. \n \n40. \nClimate change. The climate change impact of the project is categorized medium. The \nproject  team  conducted  a  climate  risk  vulnerability  assessment  (CRVA)  and  incorporated  its \nresults into the project design.26 The project\u2019s use of indoor GIS will be its main contribution to \nclimate change adaptation. In addition, the project contributes to climate mitigation by using high-\nefficiency  transmission  lines.  Details  are  in  the  CRVA  (footnote  26)  and  climate  change \nassessment (footnote 19).  \n \n41. \nInvoluntary  resettlement (category  A).  PGCB carefully  designed  the  substations  and \ntransmission  line  alignments  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  The \noverhead transmission lines have temporary impacts for crops, and permanent impacts for trees \nand land under four tower legs. Underground lines will follow rights-of-way of existing roads to \navoid creating resettlement impacts. PGCB estimated that the transmission lines will economically \naffect  870  households  with  a  population  of  3,828  persons.  The  project  will  require  about  79.6 \nacres  of  land  acquisition  for  new  substations  and  existing  bay  extension;  this  will  affect  281 \nhouseholds and 1,221 people. No physical displacement is required under the project but several \nhouseholds will be significantly affected by losing 10% of their productive assets because of land \nacquisition.  PGCB  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  and  national regulations.  PGCB  will  implement the  resettlement  plan to  ensure  that           \n(i)  affected  persons,  including  informal  settlers,  are  compensated  for  lost  assets  prior  to \ndisplacement and at replacement cost; (ii) rehabilitation and restoration programs are in place for \nthose  whose  livelihood  will  be  affected;  (iii)  meaningful  consultations  and  timely  information \ndisclosure occur; (iv) the standard of living of affected persons is improved to at least national \nminimum  standards;  and  (v)  a  three-tier  grievance  redress  mechanism  is  established.  If  the \nproject  scope  changes, PGCB  will  update the  resettlement  plan  accordingly. The  project  team \ndisclosed the resettlement plan on the ADB website on 15 July 2019. PGCB agreed to closely \nmonitor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  during  project  implementation.  PGCB  has  an \nenvironmental and social unit with staff in charge of resettlement plan implementation. PGCB has \nimplemented  several  ADB  projects  and  has  adequate  institutional  capacity  and  experience  to \nimplement  the  resettlement  plan.
