A  summary  initial  environmental \nAssessment  examination  was  prepared  and  circulated  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Board of Directors and made public \nthrough the ADB website on 19 February 2009. \n  \nProject Description  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Highway  Expansion \nProject  will  upgrade  178  kilometers  (km)  of  two-lane  national \nhighways to four-lane divided highway standard. Highway 12 from \nPhitsanulok  to  Lom  Sak  (105  km)  is  on  the  GMS  East\u2013West \nEconomic Corridor; and Highway 359 from Phanom Sarakham to \nSa Kaeo (73 km) is along the GMS Southern Economic Corridor.  \n \nThe Project will also assist the Department of Highways (DOH) \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  in  preparing  an \nimplementation plan for the Strategic Intercity Motorway Network. \nThis will include a detailed and coordinated implementation and \nfinancing  plan  for  strategic  intercity  motorways  along  three \ncorridors radiating out from Bangkok to a distance of 200\u2013250 km, \nas well as a detailed analysis of financing alternatives.  \n  ", "ii       \nRationale  After  3  decades  of  rapid  economic  development,  Thailand\u2019s \ngrowth has slowed. Strengthening competitiveness has become \nthe  centerpiece  of  Thailand\u2019s  economic  policy  to  reinvigorate \ngrowth. Deficient infrastructure is consistently cited as a major \nconstraint on productivity growth. To address high logistics costs \nin  the  transport  sector,  the  DOH  is  prioritizing  five  areas:  (i) \nintercity motorways, (ii) Bangkok express ring roads, (iii) industrial \nring  roads,  (iv)  four-lane  highway  widening,  and  (v)  roadway \nnetwork  connections  to  neighboring  countries.  ADB\u2019s  strategy \nfocuses  on  assisting  the  MOT  in  these  five  areas  of  road \ndevelopment.  In  the  longer  term,  ADB  can  offer  the  most \nadditionality  by  assisting  the  MOT  in  the  development  of  the \nmotorway  network  using  public\u2013private  partnerships.  However, \nplanning  for  the  motorway  network  is  incomplete,  whereas \npreparation for making critical sections of the highway network \nfour lanes\u2014which is essential in the short to medium term\u2014is well \nadvanced. \n   \n  The economic corridor approach, which was adopted by GMS \nleaders and reaffirmed by the 15th GMS Ministerial Conference \n(June 2009, Cha-am, Thailand), aims to (i) generate more cross-\nborder trade; (ii) extend the benefits of improved transport links to \nremote and landlocked locations in the GMS, which have been \ndisadvantaged by their lack of integration with more prosperous \nand better-located neighboring areas; (iii) provide a spatial focus \nto GMS activities, with the backbone, growth centers, and nodal \npoints serving as catalysts for the development of surrounding \nareas; (iv) open up many opportunities for investments from within \nand outside the GMS; and (v) enhance the impact of subregional \nactivities through the clustering of projects. The adoption of this \napproach  assumes  that  the  underlying  national  networks  are \nadequate  and  efficient,  which  has  not  been  the  case  in  most \ncountries. Cross-border traffic constitutes a small portion of total \nroad traffic in Thailand, but ongoing improvements in transport \ninfrastructure could soon exhaust the capacity of already busy \nroads. Therefore, managing road network capacity in the GMS \ncorridors  is  required  to  avoid  defeating  the  purpose  of \ntransforming these corridors into full-fledged economic corridors. \n  ", "    iii \nImpact and Outcome  The project impact will be an increase in competitiveness of the \nlocal economy in the provinces along the East\u2013West Economic \nCorridor  (EWEC)  and  Southern  Economic  Corridor  (SEC).  By \n2018,  gross  domestic  product  in  the  provinces,  in  which  the \nproject highways are expanded, is expected to be increased by \n20%, and value of cross-border trade carried by road transport \nwith other GMS countries along the EWEC and SEC is expected \nto be increased by 20%, compared to the baseline data of 2010. \nThe project outcome will be a more efficient and safer EWEC and \nSEC in Thailand. Compared to the baseline data, a reduction in \npassenger  and  freight  operating  costs  of  10%,  a  reduction  in \ntravel times of 15%, an increase in traffic volume of 5%, and a \nreduction in traffic accidents fatalities of 40% are expected for the \nproject highway sections by 2015.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The Project is estimated to cost $179.4 million, including taxes \nand duties of $15.4 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $77,100,000 from ADB's ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n  \nAllocation and Relending  The loan from ADB will be provided to the Kingdom of Thailand. \nTerms  The proceeds of the loan will be directly disbursed to civil works \ncontractors and consultants to be engaged by the DOH under the \nProject. \n  \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2015 \n  \nEstimated Project  31 December 2014 \nCompletion Date \n  \nExecuting Agency  DOH \n   \nImplementation  The  DOH  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project \nArrangements  implementation.  The  DOH  will  engage  and  direct  the  work  of \nconsultants, and will procure and direct all contractors. Within the \nDOH, the deputy director general\u2013engineering, who will be the \nproject  director,  will  be  responsible  for  project  implementation. \nThe director, Highway Construction Bureau, will assist the project \ndirector  as  the  deputy  project  director.  The  assistant  project \ndirector, who will be the director, Bureau of International Highways \nCooperation, will have day-to-day responsibility. \n   \n ", "iv       \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). All civil works to be funded from the \nADB loan will be procured using international competitive bidding \nprocedures with prequalification. Eight civil works packages will be \nprocured, of which five will be for Highway 12 (Phitsanulok\u2013Lom \nSak) and three for Highway 359 (Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo). \n   \nConsulting Services  The  DOH  will  recruit  an  international  consulting  firm  for  the \nconstruction supervision consulting services using the quality- and \ncost-based  selection  procedures,  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The quality and cost ratio is 80:20. The full technical \nproposal  will  be  used.  About  65  person-months  of  input  from \ninternational  experts  will  be  required  with  about  145  person-\nmonths from national experts to assist the international experts. \nExpertise will be required in civil works contract management, \nhighway  construction,  road  safety,  resettlement  and  social \nimpacts, HIV/AIDS awareness, environmental impacts mitigation, \nand project performance monitoring. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The major beneficiaries of the Project will be the residents of the \nBeneficiaries  project area and users of transport services within Thailand and in \nthe GMS. By reducing travel times and vehicle operating costs \nalong the improved sections, the Project will encourage economic \nactivities  in  the  affected  provinces.  The  Project's  economic \nbenefits are derived primarily from savings on vehicle operating \ncosts and travel time. The estimated economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) for the project road is 15.8%, indicating that the \nProject is economically viable. The results of sensitivity testing \nand risk analyses indicate that the Project is robust with a low risk \nof the EIRR falling below the minimum acceptable EIRR of 12%. \n  ", "    v \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project has been designed to reduce potential risks. A full \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared,  and  the  engineering \ndesigns  incorporate  measures  to  reduce  resettlement  impacts. \nEnvironmental documentation has been prepared in compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Previous  road  sector \nprojects in Thailand identified the following issues: (i) procurement \nwas  delayed  because  the  DOH  was  not  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding documents; (ii) some covenants, especially on \nsubmission of audited accounts, were not complied with, and (iii) \nan  excessive  number  of  components  involving  too  many \nexecuting  agencies  complicated  project  administration.  To \naddress  these  issues,  the  following  measures  have  been \nincorporated  in  the  design  of  the  Project:  (i)  the  project \npreparation  technical assistance (TA)  consultants  are  assisting \nDOH in preparing international standard contract documentation \nfor  the  civil  works  following  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \ninternational competitive bidding procedures, and will assist DOH \nin undertaking the procurement until the contracts are awarded; \n(ii) timely compliance with loan covenants will be addressed in all \nADB  loan  review  missions;  and  (iii)  the  Project  has  only  two \ncomponents, and the DOH will be the Executing Agency for both. \n  \nTechnical Assistance  Technical assistance (TA) will be provided under the Project for \nthe  preparation  of  the  implementation  plan  for  the  Strategic \nIntercity Motorway Network. The overall objective of the TA will be \nto provide the Government with a detailed implementation plan for \nthe  three  motorway  corridors,  and  prepare  the  highest  priority \nproject ready for award and implementation using an appropriate \npublic\u2013private  partnership  model.  The  cost  estimate  for  these \nservices is $1.45 million; it is proposed that ADB will finance $1.0 \nmillion. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial  Fund.  The  Government  of  Thailand  will  finance  the \nremaining  $0.45  million  through  in-kind  contributions  of  the \nExecuting Agency. The DOH will be the Executing Agency for the \nProject,  and  the  Bureau  of  Planning  under  the  DOH  will  the \nimplementing agency responsible for day-to-day oversight.  \n \nAn  international  consulting  firm,  in  association  with  national \nconsultants,  will  undertake  the  consulting  services  for  the  TA. \nADB will hire the consultant using the quality- and cost-based \nselection procedures, according to the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants.  The  quality  and  cost  ratio  is  90:10.  The \nsimplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used.  About  45  person-\nmonths  of  consulting  inputs  will  be  required  for  services \nimplemented  over  18  months  (1  April  2010  to  30  September \n2011). \n  \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Thailand for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Highway Expansion \nProject. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the implementation \nplan  for  the  Strategic  Intercity  Motorway  Network  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Over the past 3 decades, Thailand has become one of the most dynamic and diversified \neconomies in Southeast Asia. Rapid economic growth in the past 20 years has significantly \nreduced poverty, particularly in northeastern Thailand. By 2007 the official national poverty \nheadcount ratio was 8.1%. Thailand\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an average \nannual rate of 6.2% from 2002 to 2004, but slowed down to 4.8% in 2007 and 2.6% in 2008. \nGDP is envisaged to contract by 2.0% from 2008 to 2009 because of the global economic \nrecession. As many people have incomes that place them just above the poverty line, the recent \neconomic recession could push them back into poverty. Strengthening competitiveness has \nbecome the centerpiece of Thailand\u2019s economic policy agenda to reinvigorate economic growth. \nThe 10th National Economic and Social Development Plan1 emphasizes that Thailand\u2019s path to \na more competitive, productive, and open economy will require more investment in economic \ncapital, which the plan defines as having physical, financial, and human dimensions. This \napproach is consistent with priority initiatives to invest in physical and social infrastructure, to \ndevelop the domestic capital market, and to become a knowledge-based economy. Since the \neconomy depends heavily on exports, which account for more than two-thirds of GDP, and in \nline with the 10th plan, economic growth should be stimulated by increasing trade within the \nGMS through investment in transport infrastructure of the GMS corridors in Thailand.  \n \n3.  The economy\u2019s performance over the medium term will depend on political stability, and \non  raising  productivity  and  competitiveness  by  pushing  through  priority  infrastructure \ninvestments and advancing structural reforms. Transport infrastructure has been important in \nsupporting Thailand\u2019s growth and meeting the demand for transport services. The demand for \ninfrastructure services and infrastructure investment has declined, and especially investment for \nroads and highways construction sharply decreased from 2006 to 2008. However, in the long \nrun,  traffic  demand  will  grow  rapidly  and  road  capacity  shortages  will  emerge.  Transport \nbottlenecks will constrain economic growth, and the impact of insufficient investment in transport \ninfrastructure is becoming increasingly evident. Deficient infrastructure is consistently cited as a \nmajor constraint on private investment and productivity growth.2 For example, logistics costs in \nThailand are estimated to be as high as 20% of GDP, compared with 11% in Japan, 10% in the \nUnited States, and 7% in the European Union. Therefore, the Government has programmed \nlarge-scale  investments  in  the  road  subsector,  such  as  constructing  intercity  motorways, \nwidening highways to four lanes, and strengthening roads connections with the neighboring \ncountries  (para.11).  The  intercity  motorways  project  from  2007  to  2017  and  the  four-lane \n                                                 \n1  National Economic and Social Development Board. 2006. The 10th National Economic and Social Development \nPlan (2007\u20132011). Bangkok.  \n2  Infrastructure, skills shortages, and heavy regulatory burdens have been cited as the three principal constraints to \nprivate investment and productivity growth in Thailand. See National Economic and Social Development Board and \nWorld Bank. 2006. Thailand Investment Climate, Firm Competitiveness and Growth Study. Bangkok. ", "2   \nhighway widening project (phase II) from 2010 to 2015 are estimated to cost about B156.8 \nbillion and B41.7 billion, respectively, but the Government will not be able to entirely allocate the \nstate budget for the projects. To fill the gap, the Government requires financing by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and the private sector.  \n \n4.  The  GMS  transport  network  in  Thailand  is  in  good  condition  relative  to  the  GMS \ntransport network in other countries. With funding from ADB, Japan, and the World Bank, an \ninitial rehabilitation program on the GMS East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC) has been \ncompleted in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam. A minimum standard \nof an all-weather sealed, two-lane highway has been achieved across the EWEC sections in \nLao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  Similarly  for  the  Southern  Economic  Corridor  (SEC),  an  initial \nrehabilitation program in Cambodia and Viet Nam is underway, and large sections have been \ncompleted with funding from ADB, Japan, the OPEC Fund for International Development, and \nthe World Bank. With this minimum standard throughout both corridors about to be achieved, \nattention has turned to sections where improvements to a four-lane standard are required.  \n \n5.  At the Third GMS Summit held in March 2008 in Vientiane, Lao PDR, a GMS Plan of \nAction, 2008\u201320123 was adopted. This plan includes a project to upgrade the EWEC within \nThailand (Mae Sot\u2013Mukdahan) and the GMS Highway Expansion Project. The Government of \nThailand intends to improve the entire length of the sections of the EWEC and SEC that lie \nwithin Thailand. For the EWEC in Thailand, work is under way to upgrade a series of sections of \nhighway, and planning has been completed for upgrading the remaining sections in phases. Of \nthe remaining work, the first phase will upgrade 105 kilometers (km) from Phitsanulok to Lom \nSak. Detailed engineering for these sections is in progress. The Department of Highways (DOH) \nwill  upgrade  highways  along  the  remainder  of  the  EWEC  under  the  Mae  Sot\u2013Mukdahan \nupgrading project, as included in the GMS Plan of Action. For the SEC between Bangkok and \nthe border with Cambodia, the entire length has been upgraded to a four-lane highway with the \nexception of a 73 km section between Phanom Sarakham and Sa Kaeo. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  The DOH has had sufficient funds to cover all routine maintenance, but not enough to \ncover periodic maintenance requirements on all arterial roads. The World Bank\u2019s Highways \nManagement Project4 helped to reduce this backlog by funding work on 700 km of national \nhighways, and enhancing the planning and programming capability at the DOH. The DOH's \nroad maintenance budget has risen significantly. The road maintenance budget as a percentage \nof the total DOH budget was 17.5% in 1995, 25.6% in 2000, and 28.1% in 2008. The gap in \nperiodic maintenance funding for the arterial roads will be completely bridged within 4\u20135 years. \n \n7.  The economic corridor approach, which was adopted by GMS leaders and reaffirmed by \nthe 15th GMS Ministerial Conference (June 2009, Cha-am, Thailand), aims to (i) generate more \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008. Report on the Third Greater Mekong Subregion Summit, Manila. \n4  The development objective of the Highways Management Project is to enhance the efficiency, productive use, and \nmanagement of the road network. Specifically, it supports the commercialization of the road sector, strengthens the \noperations of the DOH, helps preserve road assets, and improves competition and transparency in the award of \ncontracts. Furthermore, the project will reduce traffic accidents and fatalities on national highways and decentralize \nthe  implementation  of  periodic  maintenance  to  the  districts. The  project  has  four  components:  (i)  highway \nrehabilitation and maintenance, (ii) highway upgrading and intersection improvement, (iii) road safety improvement, \nand (iv) institutional strengthening. The fourth component includes TA for the development of a framework for and a \ncase study on public\u2013private partnerships in highways. The World Bank approved an $84.3 million loan for the \nproject on 9 December 2003, and is processing an additional loan for widening of five more sections (216 km total) \nof priority national highways from two to four lanes (Table 1). \n ", "  3 \ncross-border trade; (ii) extend the benefits of improved transport links to remote and landlocked \nlocations in the GMS, which have been disadvantaged by their lack of integration with more \nprosperous and better-located neighboring areas; (iii) provide a spatial focus to GMS activities, \nwith the backbone, growth centers, and nodal points serving as catalysts for the development of \nsurrounding areas; (iv) open up many opportunities for investments from within and outside the \nGMS; and (v) enhance the impact of subregional activities through the clustering of projects. \nThe adoption of this approach assumes that the underlying national networks are adequate and \nefficient, which has not been the case in most countries. Cross-border traffic constitutes a small \nportion of total road traffic in Thailand, but ongoing improvements in their transport infrastructure \ncould soon exhaust the capacity of already busy roads. Therefore, managing road network \ncapacity in the GMS corridors is required to avoid defeating the purpose of transforming these \ncorridors into full-fledged economic corridors. Details are in Appendix 2. \n \n8.  The  governments  in  the  GMS  have  recognized  that  providing  subregional  physical \ninfrastructure is a necessary but not sufficient condition for more connectivity among the six \nGMS countries. As part of the economic corridor approach, mitigating nonphysical barriers to \nthe cross-border movement of goods and people is important to increase efficiency, reduce \ncosts, and maximize the economic benefits of improved subregional transport infrastructure. To \nmitigate such barriers, the six GMS countries5 have negotiated, signed, and ratified a cross-\nborder transport agreement (CBTA). Formulated under a series of ADB TA projects, the CBTA \nprovides a practical approach to streamline regulations and reduce nonphysical barriers to the \ncross-border transport of goods and people in the GMS. It incorporates the principles of bilateral \nor multilateral actions, and flexibility in recognizing differences in procedures in each of the GMS \ncountries. The implementing guidelines of the CBTA have been signed and are expected to be  \nratified by all of the GMS countries in 2009. Implementation of the CBTA along major GMS \ncorridors is expected to start in 2010. More information on the CBTA is in Appendix 2. \n \n9.  Private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  financing  in  Thailand  has  suffered  from \nfinancial and contractual problems, and private investors may not be ready to reenter the \nmarket. A better policy environment is needed for private sector participation in the provision \nand  management  of  infrastructure  services,  and  for  improvement  of  the  infrastructure \nprioritization and delivery process to allow good projects to be implemented in a timely and \nefficient manner. The World Bank-financed Highways Management Project (footnote 4) has a \nTA component that will (i) recommend revisions to Thailand's policy, legal, and regulatory \nframework for the roads sector to ensure a clear separation of responsibilities and to provide \neffective  management  of  road  infrastructure;  (ii)  develop  a  program  for  increasing  the \ninstitutional capacity of the DOH, which will be responsible for managing highway assets; and \n(iii) prepare a preliminary technical and financial assessment of the Bang Pa-In (Bangkok) to \nNakhon Ratchasima motorway, including preparation of a concession agreement for a public\u2013\nprivate partnership to finance, implement, and operate the motorway. The TA component was \ncompleted in the second quarter of 2009. \n \n1.  The Government\u2019s Strategy \n \n10.  To reduce logistics cost and increase the country\u2019s global competitiveness, the Thai \nCabinet on 27 February 2007 agreed upon a Thailand logistics road map. The overall objective \nof the road map is to reduce logistics costs in Thailand through the promotion of (i) more \nefficient logistics in the production sector, (ii) more efficiency in the transport sector, (iii) the \n                                                 \n5  The GMS comprises Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. \n ", "4   \ndevelopment of private sector logistics businesses, (iv) better facilitation for international trade, \nand (v) better human resource development.  \n \n11.  To support the policy of the Cabinet with respect to increasing efficiency in the transport \nsector, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and its Office of Transport and Traffic Policy, with the \nDOH, will prioritize five areas of road development: (i) intercity motorways, (ii) Bangkok express \nring roads, (iii) industrial ring roads, (iv) widening of highways to four lanes, and (v) roadway \nnetwork  connections  to  neighboring  countries.  Within  the  road  subsector,  the  Government \nintends to pursue its overall goal of reducing logistics costs and maintaining or increasing the \ncountry\u2019s regional competitiveness primarily within the framework of these five areas. A number \nof challenges and constraints must be overcome to achieve this goal within a reasonable period, \nincluding  (i)  developing  a  broadly  based  financing  plan  that  reaches  well  beyond  the \ndependence on normal yearly DOH budget allocations; and (ii) making significant changes to \nThailand's  legal  and  contractual  frameworks  to  provide  the  environment  essential  for  the \nintroduction of innovative public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n12.  In 2009, the Government announced two economic stimulus packages to revitalize the \neconomy  and  help  low-income  people  in  particular.  The  second  package  focused  on \ninfrastructure investment, and the highway four-lane expansion is one of the major projects in \nthe package. However, the Government cannot fund such large investment programs and \nprojects from domestic financial sources alone. The FY2009 budget provides for expenditures of \nB1.835 trillion plus a supplementary budget of B116.7 billion, while revenue is expected to be \nB1.425 trillion. This will result in a fiscal deficit of B526.7 billion in 2009. Thus, in addition to \ntapping domestic capital markets, the Government is seeking to diversify the sources of funds \nfor these programs and projects. It has approached ADB, Japan, World Bank, and others as \npotential cofinanciers. \n \n13.  Thailand has been an active member of the GMS program since its inception in 1992. \nThailand has financed components of priority subregional transport projects in its territory, \nparticipated in subregional projects in the other areas of GMS cooperation, and assisted in the \nimplementation of priority subregional projects in other GMS countries. Thailand initiated the \nAyeyawaddy\u2013Chao Phraya\u2013Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy initiative to complement \nGMS cooperation by enhancing the competitiveness of member countries (Cambodia, Lao \nPDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam), thereby facilitating deeper economic integration of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. \n \n2.  Lessons  \n \n14.  The most recent ADB-funded project in the road subsector in Thailand was the Second \nRegional Roads (Sector) Project,6 which was approved in September 1995 and completed in \nSeptember 2004. In the project completion report,7 the following issues were identified: (i) cash \nflow problems were the single biggest cause of civil works delays, although it was noted that this \nwas largely caused by the 1997 financial crisis; (ii) procurement was delayed because the DOH \nwas unfamiliar with ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents and Cabinet approval of contracts was \nrequired; (iii) covenant compliance, especially with regard to submission of audited accounts \nand  adequate  maintenance  of  project  facilities,  needs  to  be  enforced  thoroughly  during \nimplementation; and (iv) an excessive number of components involving too many executing \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n ", "  5 \nagencies complicated project administration. To address these issues, the following actions are \nproposed: (i) using international standard contract documentation following the requirements of \nADB\u2019s international competitive bidding procedures, (ii) providing assistance to the DOH during \nthe preparation and procurement of civil works contracts, (iii) specifically addressing compliance \nwith loan covenants in all ADB loan review missions, and (iv) minimizing the number of project \ncomponents and executing agencies. \n \n3.  ADB Strategy \n \n15.  The  country  partnership  strategy  for  Thailand  (2007\u20132011)8  identifies  infrastructure \ndevelopment as a core area of partnership with ADB at the national level. By increasing the \ncapacity of strategic national highway corridors to transport goods and people, the strategy will \ncontribute to higher productivity and sustainable economic growth. The strategy promotes the \napplication of country safeguard and procurement systems, which is consistent with the Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness.9 ADB and the World Bank are working to harmonize policies \nand procedures to reduce transaction costs and to align Thailand\u2019s systems with international \nbest practice. The strategy also refers to the development partnership between Thailand and \nADB at the subregional level, and seeks to elevate Thailand\u2019s role in facilitating trade and \ninvestment within the GMS. By widening key segments of the EWEC and SEC, Thailand will \nimprove  transport  logistics,  strengthen  trade  links  with  neighboring  countries,  and  deepen \nsubregional cooperation. \n \n16.  ADB approved the regional cooperation strategy and program (RCSP) for the GMS10 in \nMarch 2004. The RCSP update, 2007\u2013200911 noted progress in implementing the strategic \npillars  of  the  RCSP,  which  provide  the  backbone  of  ADB  assistance  toward  enhancing \nconnectivity, improving competitiveness, and engendering a greater sense of community in the \nGMS. In 2006, a GMS transport sector strategy12 was prepared for the period up to 2015 based \non the theme \u201ctowards seamless transport services on a fully connected and integrated GMS \ntransport network.\u201d To develop the transport infrastructure of the GMS, the strategy proposed \nthe following goals: (i) sectoral focus, (ii) comprehensive intersectoral strategy, and (iii) goal-\nsetting and results-oriented management. A project to improve sections of the GMS transport \ncorridors in Thailand would be consistent with the RCSP, as well as the GMS transport sector \nstrategy. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the road sector in Thailand focuses on assisting the MOT in the five \npriority areas of road development to address improvements to the highway network that will \nreduce  transport  costs  and  increase  competitiveness.  Appendix  3  shows  development \ncoordination in the transport sector with development partners. In the longer term, ADB can \noffer the most additionality by assisting the MOT in the development of the motorway network \nusing public\u2013private partnerships. However, planning for the motorway network is incomplete, \nwhereas preparation for making critical sections of the highway network four lanes\u2014which is \nessential  in  the  short  to  medium  term\u2014is  well  advanced.  Given  the  Government\u2019s  recent \nincreased interest in the use of public\u2013private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects, \nconsideration has been given to the use of these modalities for the program to make certain \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2007.

However, the use of public\u2013private partnerships for the program is not \nfeasible in most cases, because these highways are not tolled and cannot be readily tolled. \nTypically the roads being upgraded to a four-lane standard are multiuse highways that service \nlocal  and  long-distance  traffic.  The  highways  can  be  accessed  at  any  point,  and  private \naccesses to residential and commercial developments line the highways, particularly in urban \nareas. Thus, the toll system would need to be very complex to capture long-distance traffic while \nexempting  local  users  in  an  equitable  and  cost-effective  manner.  Further,  if  tolls  were \nintroduced, the resulting reduction in traffic levels, through the diversion of long-distance traffic \nto alternative routes, would substantially reduce the economic viability of the investment. In \nthese circumstances, designing public\u2013private partnerships that are financially viable enough to \nattract private investment would be very difficult. \n \n4.  External Assistance \n \n18.  The main thrusts of regional cooperation in the transport sector have been (i) developing \nthe north\u2013south corridor between Kunming in Yunnan Province of the People's Republic of \nChina and Bangkok in Thailand, and the east\u2013west corridor from Thailand and the central coast \nof Viet Nam through Lao PDR; (ii) linking the capitals, other population centers, and major \ntourist  destinations  in  the  subregion;  (iii)  helping  develop  remote  and  low-income  areas \ntraversed  by  subregional  road  projects  by  improving  access  to  markets,  and  social  and \neconomic services; (iv) providing access to the sea for landlocked Lao PDR, and alternative \naccess to seaports for such areas as northeastern Thailand and Yunnan Province; and (v) \nreducing, with the objective of eliminating, nonphysical barriers (such as regulations covering \nborder crossings) to the movement of people and goods in the subregion. GMS road subsector \nprojects financed by ADB are listed in Appendix 3. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n19.  The EWEC links the southern part of Myanmar and the northern and northeastern parts \nof Thailand, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. This corridor has undergone significant infrastructure \nimprovements, particularly the upgrading of Highway 9 in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and the \nbridge across the Mekong River between Mukdahan and Savannakhet, which opened to traffic \nin  January  2007.  Within  Thailand,  improvements  to  the  corridor  have  included  upgrading \nsections to a four-lane standard using domestic funding. It is the policy of the Government of \nThailand to upgrade the entire length of the EWEC within Thailand to a four-lane standard. The \nEWEC connects at a number of points in Thailand to the country's main highway network and \nthe GMS North\u2013South and Northeastern Corridors, thus providing good access to Bangkok and \nthe ports of Thailand. Improving the project section will increase access to international trade \nwith Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and accelerate the economic development of the less-developed \nareas along the EWEC. Trade at the Mukdahan-Savannakhet border checkpoint was sluggish \nduring the construction of the Second Mekong International Bridge funded by Japan (December \n2003 to December 2006). However, trade in both directions has expanded significantly recently. \nBetween 2006 and 2008, the value of Thai exports expanded by nearly 90%, while Lao PDR \nexports surged by more than 350% as a result of larger copper shipments and the rise in the \nprice of that commodity. Movement of people has also increased from under 300 persons per \nday in 2000 to about 500 persons per day in 2006 and 750 persons per day in 2007.13 However, \nthe number of vehicles crossing the border\u2014estimated at about 150 vehicles a day\u2014is below \npotential and a small improvement from the 130 vehicles a day that crossed the border in 2000. \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "  7 \nCross-border trade and traffic, including transit trade, is expected to increase with the start in \nJune 2009 of the three-country exchange of traffic rights' arrangements and the introduction of a \ncustoms transit system among Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam along the EWEC. \n \n20.  The SEC's central sub-corridor links Bangkok with Cambodia and the southern areas of \nViet Nam, including Ho Chi Minh City, by a 924 km road. It may be extended west from Bangkok \nto provide an additional link with Myanmar. The subproject section on this corridor, Phanom \nSarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo, is the only one in Thailand that is not already four lanes. An alternative \nroute using highways 304 and 33 is four lanes, but the route using Highway 359 (Phanom \nSarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo section) is the most direct and is preferred for long-distance traffic. It is a \nnew road with a very high standard of alignment, avoiding the urban centers of Kabin Buri and \nSa Kaeo that are located on the alternative route. The main border crossing point between \nThailand and Cambodia is east of Sa Kaeo at Aranyaprathet\u2013Poipet. The SEC continues as \nCambodian Highway 5 to Phnom Penh (with a branch via Highway 6 to the major tourist site of \nAngkor Wat near Siem Reap), then as Highway 1 to the  Bavet\u2013Moc Bai border crossing into \nViet Nam, and finally as Viet Nam Highway 22 to Ho Chi Minh City. Formal cross-border exports \nfrom Thailand to Cambodia rose from B1.26 billion in 1996 to B32.2 billion in 2007, an average \nincrease of 42.8% per year.14 The Aranyaprathet border checkpoint accounted for about half of \nthe cross-border exports from Thailand to Cambodia. Major exports from Thailand include \nmotorcycles and parts, cement, engines, livestock feeds, petroleum, woven fabrics, textiles, and \nchemical  fertilizers,  with  the  largest  being  motorcycles  and  parts.  Cross-border  imports  of \nThailand from Cambodia also rose from B1.0 billion in 1996 to B1.6 billion in 2007, an annual \naverage growth rate of 20%; the Aranyaprathet border checkpoint accounted for two-thirds of \nthe total. The major products imported by Thailand through the border gates include metal \nwastes, used clothes, corn feeds for livestock, soybean grain, ready-made clothes, and tapioca. \nThe balance of trade has consistently been in favor of Thailand, whose exports were 20 times \nlarger than its imports in 2007. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n21.  The project impact will be increase in competitiveness of the local economy in the \nprovinces along the EWEC and SEC. By 2018, GDP in the provinces, in which the project \nhighways are expanded, is expected to be increased by 20%, and value of cross-border trade \ncarried by road transport with other GMS countries along the EWEC and SEC is expected to be \nincreased by 20%, compared to the baseline data to be collected in 2010. The project outcome \nwill be a more efficient and safer EWEC and SEC in Thailand. Compared to the baseline data, a \nreduction in passenger and freight operating costs of 10%, a reduction in travel times of 15%, \nan increase in traffic volume of 5%, and a reduction in traffic accidents fatalities of 40% are \nexpected for the project highway sections by 2015.   \n \n22.  The economy in the project area depends mainly on agriculture and natural resources, \nand  rearing  livestock  is  very  important.  The  project  area  shows  little  evidence  of  contract \nfarming, except among vegetable growers who provide a range of cool-weather vegetables \n(e.g.,  peas,  beans,  and  broccoli)  to  high-end  supermarkets  in  Thailand.  Apart  from  the \nmanufacture of pulp and paper products, the project area has little manufacturing. However, \nthere are many examples and small amounts of products being manufactured locally. The \n                                                 \n14 Cross-border trade covers only formal trade and is defined as trade conducted through land borders as contrasted \nto trade conducted through sea and air transport.

Access to the limited areas of forests that remain to collect non-timber \nforest  products  is  very  circumscribed,  although  it  is  permitted  in  some  instances.  Service \nindustries are well developed in the major provincial centers; Khon Kaen is the most developed \nin  terms  of  education  and  health  care.  Other  sectors,  such  as  tourism,  are  not  very  well \ndeveloped in the project area, except in Phetchabun. In general, the project area offers few \nemployment  opportunities  outside  of  agriculture.  Positive  impacts  arising  from  the  Project \nrelating  to  poverty  reduction  will  include  (i)  the  development  of  agriculture-based  income-\ngeneration activities to meet unmet demand for meat products in other GMS countries; (ii) \nimportation of sugarcane and cassava from the Lao PDR for value-adding into biofuels; (iii) \ngrowth in domestic, regional, and international tourism; (iv) greater development of small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, especially with the bridging finance afforded when activities can be \nlinked to Thailand\u2019s One-Tambon (subdistrict), One-Product program; (v) revitalization of local \nculture  and  preservation  of  traditional  skills,  including  dance,  music,  embroidery,  and  silk-\nweaving; and (vi) promotion of greater cultural understanding in a region where it has taken \nmore than 4 decades to transcend lingering cultural doubts about GMS neighbors. Further \ninformation is in Appendix 4.   \n \nB.  Outputs \n23.  The Project will upgrade about 178 km of two-lane national highway to a four-lane \ndivided  highway  standard.  Works  include  new  bridges  and  widening  of  existing  bridges, \nreinforced  concrete  box  and  pipe  culvert  improvements,  new  asphaltic  concrete  pavement \nsections, and the strengthening and overlay of existing pavement sections. In addition, specific \nroadway safety improvements, such as provision for pedestrian overpasses, improved signage \nand pavement markings, and pavement widening at bus stops, will be incorporated into the \nimprovements. The 178 km are along two sections of highway: Highway 12 from Phitsanulok to \nLom Sak (105 km) is on the EWEC; and Highway 359 from Phanom Sarakham to Sa Kaeo (73 \nkm), is along the SEC. A summary of the proposed civil works under this component is in \nAppendix 5. The DOH will establish a project performance monitoring system (para. 40). \n \n24.  Over the past 10 years, attempts have been made to initiate the development of the \nmotorway network. However, these foundered  because a detailed implementation strategy and \na credible financing plan were lacking. TA will be provided to assist the MOT and DOH in \npreparing an implementation plan for the Strategic Intercity Motorway Network Project. The plan \nwill develop a detailed and coordinated implementation and financing plan for strategic intercity \nmotorways along three corridors radiating out from Bangkok to a distance of 200\u2013250 km, and \nwill include a detailed analysis of financing alternatives. This implementation plan is intended to \nprovide the basis for future ADB assistance to Thailand\u2019s road subsector through public and \nprivate sector operations. ADB will fund this component through a TA grant. \n \nC.  Special Features \n25.  The Project is part of the DOH Four-Lane Highway Widening Project (Phase II) to \nupgrade about 433 km of eight national highway sections from a two-lane highway standard to a \nfour-lane divided highway standard. The project profile is in Table 1. The Ministry of Finance \ninvited ADB and the World Bank to jointly assist in financing the Project, which includes seven \nhighway sections in the north, east, and south of the country. It is proposed that ADB assist the \nDOH by providing funding for the upgrading of the Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak section on the EWEC \nand the Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo section on the SEC. The World Bank will assist the DOH \nwith funding for five sections. ADB and the World Bank are preparing separate projects to cover \n ", "  9 \ntheir respective sections. However, the institutions are closely cooperating with each other, and \nharmonizing  and  standardizing  documentation  and  procedures  to  the  extent  possible.  The \nProject supports the Government\u2019s strategy to reduce logistics costs by widening highways to \nfour lanes and improving roadway network connections to neighboring countries. \n \nTable 1: DOH Four-Lane Highway Widening Project (Phase II) \n \n      Length   Planned \nNo.  Highways  4-Laning Highway Sections  (km)  Financer \n1  12  Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak  105  ADB \n2  201  Si Kiu\u2013Nongbuakhok    60  World Bank \n3  2042  Nakrai\u2013Khamcha-i     33  DOHa \n4  24  Si Kiu\u2013Ubon Ratchathani    65  World Bank \n5  331  Satthahip\u2013Phanom Sarakham    28  World Bank \n6  359  Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo    73  ADB \n7  4  Phang Nga\u2013Krabi     27  World Bank \n8  408  Nakhon Si Thammarat\u2013Ranot Sathing Phra    36  World Bank \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DOH = Department of Highways, km = kilometer. \na Because of difficulty with land acquisition and resettlement along Highway 2042, the DOH decided to finance the \nhighway widening of the Highway by the Government fund. \nSources: Department of Highways and ADB. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n26.  The Project is estimated to cost $179.4 million, including taxes and duties of $15.4 \nmillion. A summary of the project investment plan is in Table 2, and detailed cost estimates are \nin Appendix 6.  \nE.  Financing Plan \n27.  The Government has requested a loan of $77.1 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, an annual commitment charge of 0.15%, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n28.  The ADB loan will finance about 43% of the project costs. The ADB loan will be allocated \nto fund 50% of the civil works costs and the consulting services costs. The Government will \nfinance about 57% of the project cost, the equivalent of about $102.3 million. The Government \nfunds will be allocated to fund the remainder of the civil works costs and the consulting services \ncosts, taxes and duties, and financial charges during implementation.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n29.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  the  DOH,  which  will  have  overall \nresponsibility  for  project  implementation.  The  DOH  established  a  project  management  unit \n(PMU) that will act as the focal point for interagency coordination and communication with ADB \nand the Government agencies concerned. The PMU will (i) carry out procurement, (ii) supervise \nthe consultants and contractors under the Project, (iii) prepare the necessary documentation for \nthe withdrawal of loan proceeds, and (iv) prepare periodic reports to ADB. The DOH appointed \nthe  deputy  director  general  for  engineering  as  the  project  director  to  head  the  PMU  and \nsupervise project implementation. The director of the Highway Construction Bureau, DOH will \nassist the project director as the deputy project director. In addition, the DOH appointed the \ndirector of the Bureau of International Highways Cooperation to act as the assistant project \ndirector of the PMU and assume responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of the Project. \n ", "  11 \nThe assistant project director will be assisted by a number of qualified DOH staff. The DOH will \nalso assign an advisory team of technical specialists as well as two area chief engineers. The \nDOH will engage and direct the work of the construction supervision consultant, and will procure \nand direct all contractors. The consultant will provide a project manager and two area engineers \nand other specialists15 to provide construction management services. The DOH will appoint \neight resident engineers (one for each of the eight civil works contract packages), as well as a \nfull complement of field engineers, inspectors, technicians, and surveyors, working with the \nconsultant. The consultant and DOH staff will occupy adjoining office space in the same building \nto be provided under the civil works contracts at each of the two subprojects sites. This will \nensure close communication and coordination between the DOH and consultant teams. A \nproject organization chart is in Appendix 7.  \n \n30.  Within 2 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish a project steering \ncommittee (PSC), to be chaired by the director general of the DOH. Its members will be senior \nrepresentatives from the DOH, the Public Debt Management Office of the Ministry of Finance, \nthe National Economic and Social Development Board, the Bureau of Budget, the Office of \nTransport and Traffic Policy and Planning, the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental \nPolicy and Planning, and the Office of the Attorney General. The PSC will meet semiannually. \nThe PSC will (i) provide the PMU with policy guidance, (ii) review the progress of project \nimplementation, and (iii) handle cross-sector issues related to the Project. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n31.  The Project will be implemented over 4.5 years with completion date by 31 December \n2014. It is expected that the construction works on Highway 359 will start in the third quarter of \n2010, and the works on Highway 12 will begin by the second quarter of 2011. Highway 12 may \noffer  the  most  construction-related  difficulties  during  implementation  because  of  the \nmountainous terrain and the need to carefully monitor environmental safeguards. Hence, the \nimplementation period for each of the five packages on Highway 12 has been extended to 36 \nmonths, or until the first quarter of 2014. An additional 6 months, or until the third quarter of \n2014, is allowed to provide for any construction time extensions, final contract payments, and \nfor the maintenance period. An implementation schedule for the Project is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n32.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All civil works to be \nfunded from the ADB loan will be procured using international competitive bidding procedures \nwith pre-qualification. Eight civil works packages will be procured, of which five will be for \nHighway 12 (Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak) and three for Highway 359 (Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo). \nProcurement details are in the procurement plan in Appendix 9. \n \n33.  Advance contracting for civil works contracts will be required; retroactive financing will \nnot be required. The Government was advised that the approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n                                                 \n15  Environmental specialists, resettlement and social development specialists, and HIV/AIDS specialists. \n ", "12   \n4.  Consulting Services \n34.  The DOH will recruit an international consulting firm for construction supervision using \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Full technical proposals will be required. \nIn the evaluation of proposals, to calculate the total scores of short-listed firms, the technical \nproposals will be given a weight of 80% and the financial proposals will be given a weight of \n20%. About 65 person-months of input from international experts will be required, with about \n145 person-months from national experts to assist the international experts. Expertise will be \nrequired in contract management, highway construction, resettlement and social development, \nHIV/AIDS  awareness,  environmental  mitigation,  and  project  performance  monitoring. \nRecruitment details are in the procurement plan in Appendix 9. The outline terms of reference \nfor the construction supervision consulting services are in Appendix 10.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government and Executing Agency. The Government will: (i) undertake necessary \nmeasures to create and sustain a corruption-free environment for activities under the Project; (ii) \ncomply  with  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy;  and  (iii)  where  appropriate,  ensure  that  relevant \nprovisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in all bidding documents for the Project. \nConsistent with ADB's commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, the \nGovernment: (i) acknowledges ADB's right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project; and (ii) agrees \nto cooperate fully with any such investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including \nproviding access to all relevant books and records, as may be necessary for the satisfactory \ncompletion of any such investigation. All external costs related to such investigations will be met \nby the Project resources or by the Government. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe  Project.  In  particular,  the  Government  shall:  (i)  conduct  periodic  inspections  on  the \nsuppliers', contractors', and other service providers' activities related to the Loan proceeds, fund \nwithdrawals and settlements; and (ii) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n36.  To ensure transparency and good governance, the DOH will publicly disclose on its \nwebsite information on how loan proceeds are being used. For each procurement contract, the \nDOH will disclose (i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) the name of the winning bidder, (iii) \nbasic details on bidding procedures adopted, (iv) the amount of the contract awarded, and (v) a \nlist of goods and/or services purchased. The DOH will also disclose details of resettlement \nreports on its website. The website will be updated within 2 weeks of each contract being \nawarded. The DOH will also submit resettlement monitoring reports to ADB every quarter. The \nresettlement  reports  will  be  uploaded  onto  the  DOH\u2019s  website  within  2  weeks  of  their \nsubmission. Moreover, the Government will ensure that all of the DOH\u2019s project staff are fully \naware of and comply with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s procedures, including procedures for (i) \nimplementation, (ii) procurement, (iii) use of consultants, (iv) disbursement, (v) reporting, (vi) \nmonitoring, and (vii) prevention of fraud and corruption. \n \n ", "  13 \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n37.  Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  directly  to  the  contractors  and \nconsultants,  based  on  an  approved  contract  using  direct  payment  procedures. An  imprest \naccount will not be established. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n38.  The DOH will maintain separate records and accounts to identify the works and services \nfinanced from the proceeds of the project loan, financing resources received, expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and use of local funds. Within 6 months of the close of the each year, \nthe DOH will submit to ADB audited annual project accounts that  provide a detailed description \nof the source of funds and expenditures made. Annual project accounts will be audited by an \nauditor acceptable to ADB, and the auditor\u2019s terms of reference will be approved by ADB before \nwork starts if the DOH engages an auditing firm. \n \n39.  The construction supervision consultants will prepare progress reports on the Project, \nwhich will be reviewed by the DOH and submitted by the DOH to ADB every month during the \nproject implementation period. The reports will include a description of the physical progress, \nstatus of implementation of updated resettlement plans, status of work subject to provisions of \nthe environmental management plan (EMP), procurement and contractual status, and highlights \nof any implementation issues. The reports will also contain a summary of project accounts, \nincluding details of the latest project expenditures and contract amounts. The reports will include \nan evaluation of progress in implementing the Project. Within 6 months of physical completion of \nthe Project, the DOH will furnish to ADB a project completion report covering details of project \nimplementation, the use of loan proceeds, and accomplishments in relation to the Project's \noutcome and impact. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n40.  The DOH will establish, within 6 months of the loan effective date, a project performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  that  will  operate  throughout  the  life  of  the  Project  and \nintegrate it with the existing management information system. Initially, the monitoring system will \ndevelop and conduct sample surveys to establish baseline data for subsequent performance \nmonitoring, and will establish pre-project social and economic living conditions for the direct \nproject beneficiaries. These baseline surveys will be carried out within a year of the start of the \nservices of the supervision consultant, and will ensure that sufficient data is gathered to monitor \nthe indicators set out in the design and monitoring framework for the Project. A second survey \nwill be carried out on project completion and a third survey not less than 5 years after project \ncompletion. The baseline and impact surveys will include areas affected by the Project and will \nassess  all  interventions  under  the  Project,  including  resettlement  and  other  safeguard \ninterventions that affect the livelihood of project beneficiaries. In addition, a set of indicators \nreflecting transport costs, tariffs, and mobility will be developed to assess the effects of better \naccess. District indicators will include agricultural productivity, economic activity, and health and \neducation sectors. \n \n ", "14   \n9.  Project Review \n41.  ADB, with Government representatives and in coordination with the World Bank's project \nteam, will undertake regular reviews of the Project at about 6-month intervals to assess (i) the \nprogress of the resettlement and civil works, (ii) environmental impact mitigation works, (iii) \ndisbursement progress, and (iv) compliance with the loan assurances. The reviews will also \nassess the potential risk for achieving the project outcome, particularly after the midterm review. \nAt  critical  periods  during  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  EMPs,  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement and environment specialists will join the reviews. In addition to these regular \nreviews, a comprehensive midterm review of Project implementation will be carried out at the \nend of the second year of the project implementation. This midterm review will allow for any \nnecessary midcourse corrections. About 1 year after project completion a project completion \nreview will document the achievements of the Project. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Background \n42.  The road network in Thailand comprises about 202,000 km, of which about 51,500 km \nare classified as highways, 150,000 km as rural roads, and about 450 km as controlled access \nexpressway and motorways. The DOH is the primary Government agency responsible for the \nplanning, construction, maintenance, and operation of the road network. Over the past 10 years, \nthe Government's highway subsector strategy has focused on making national highways four \nlanes. However, during this period, intercity motorways or additional expressways in the vicinity \nof Bangkok have not been emphasized, and a coherent public investment plan for intercity \nmotorways does not appear to exist. The development of this network is becoming essential if \nadequate highway capacity is to be provided, particular in the areas close to Bangkok. The \nGovernment prioritizes construction of intercity motorways (para. 11). The World Bank-financed \nHighways Management Project (footnote 4) includes a TA component prepared for the DOH \nthat will provide recommendations for implementing a restructured framework for private sector \nparticipation in financing, construction, operations, and maintenance activities.  \n \n43.  The GMS economic corridors are defined as an expansion of key transport corridors to \nenhance economic activities and benefits. The development of nodal points of the corridors, \nwhich should serve as centers for enterprise development, is required to transform transport \ncorridors into economic corridors. Bangkok is one of the principal nodal cities in the GMS, and is \nthe origin and destination of the GMS North\u2013South, Southern, and Southern Coastal Corridors. \nConstruction of the motorways in the Bangkok metropolitan area will strengthen connectivity \nbetween Bangkok and cities in the suburbs of Bangkok, and will induce private investment in the \nmetropolitan area. In the GMS context, the Bangkok motorway projects will serve as the nodal \ndevelopment,  compared  to  the  GMS  Highway  Expansion  Project  and  other  GMS  highway \nprojects referred as link development.     \n \nB.  Proposed Study \n44.  The overall objective of the TA study will be to provide the Government with a detailed \nimplementation plan for the motorway corridors, and to prepare the highest priority project ready \nfor award and implementation using an appropriate public\u2013private partnership model. The TA \nwill concentrate on three motorway links: (i) Chonburi to Map Ta Put, including an access link to \nLaem Chabang Port; (ii) Bang Yai to Nakhon Pathom (Bang Pong) to Cha-am; and (iii) Nakhon \nPathom to Kanchanaburi. In general, the TA study will build upon the work and documentation \n ", "  15 \nalready prepared under the World Bank's TA for the DOH on the Bang Pa-In to Nakhon \nRatchasima Motorway. To realize the overall objective, the TA study will carried out in three \nphases:  (i)  the  inspection  and  screening  phase  to  review  and  study  market  issues  and \nregulatory structures for the Thai road sector; (ii) the project preparation phase to prepare a \nproject for the selected motorway link; and (iii) the procurement assistance phase to finalize the \ntender documents and assist the DOH with procurement. A summary of the TA, including terms \nof reference for the consulting services, reporting requirements, and detailed breakdown of the \ncost estimate, is in Appendix 11. \n \n45.  These services are estimated to cost $1.45 million; it is proposed that ADB will finance \n$1.0 million. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by Japan Special Fund. The Government \nof  Thailand  will  finance  the  remaining  $0.45  million  through  in-kind  contributions  of  the \nExecuting Agency\u2014remuneration and allowances for counterpart staff; furnished offices for the \nstudy team; and the provision of maps, reports, and other information.  \n \n46.  The DOH will be the Executing Agency for the study. The Bureau of Planning will be the \nimplementing  agency  responsible  for  day-to-day  oversight.  A  steering  committee  will  be \nestablished to give direction and guidance to the consultants. Members of this committee will be \nnominated from the DOH (at deputy director general level), the Office of Transport and Traffic \nManagement Policy and Planning, the National Economic and Social Development Board, the \nPublic Debt Management Office, and the Budget Bureau of the Office of the Prime Minister.  \n \n47.  An international consulting firm in association with national consultants will undertake the \nconsulting services for the TA. The consultants will be hired by ADB according to the ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and its quality- and cost-based recruitment procedures. \nShort-listed international consulting firms will submit simplified technical proposals, which will be \nassigned a weight of 90% in the calculation of the firms\u2019 total scores; the financial proposals will \nbe  given  a  weight  of  10%.  This  proposed  weighting  reflects  the  technical  difficulty  and \ncomplexity of the consulting services. About 45 person-months of consulting inputs will be \nrequired\u201422 person-months from international consultants and 23 person-months from national \nconsultants. The consulting services will be implemented over 18 months, from 1 April 2010 to \n30 September 2011. The consultants will have expertise in (i) project feasibility assessment, (ii) \nhighway design and construction, (iii) formulation of public\u2013private partnerships appropriate for \nlarge infrastructure projects, (iv) financial analysis, (v) legal documentation and regulations, (vi) \nsocial and environmental safeguards, and (vii) procurement. Equipment financed under the TA \nwill be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and will be handed over to the \nDOH at the end of the services. The TA will start in October 2009 and close in December 2011 \nto allow time for completion of documentation and final payments.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n48.  Economic Viability. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project was \ncalculated by comparing the with- and without-project scenarios for the project highways. In the \nwithout-project scenario, the highways are assumed to remain at their current width. Both \nproject scenarios include routine and periodic maintenance according to current Thai standards. \nWithout the Project, the traffic volume would exceed the capacity of the highways, which would \nbecome congested\u2014leading to increases in travel time and vehicle operating costs (VOCs). \nWith the Project, travel time would decrease because of higher speeds, and VOCs would \ndecline  because  of  the  faster  and  smoother  ride  on  the  project  highways.  The  economic \nanalysis was carried out using the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model. The \nmodel evaluates the project investment considering capital and recurrent costs, as well as the \n ", "16   \nbenefits derived from savings in road user costs for the with- and without-project cases. In the \neconomic analysis, the project life after completion of works was taken to be 20 years. The \neconomic costs of the Project include the resource costs for construction, and operation and \nmaintenance; and the social costs of compensation for land acquisition and resettlement. The \neconomic benefits were quantified in terms of VOC, time, and accident cost savings. The \nestimated EIRR for the Highway 12 section is 12.2% and for the Highway 359 section is 20.1%, \nindicating that all project components are economically viable. The estimated EIRR for the \nProject  as  a  whole  is  15.8%.  The  economic  viability  is  generally  robust.  The  capital  cost \nincrease up to 52.6% or the benefit reduction up to 36.1% ensures the project EIRR higher than \n12%. A risk analysis using the @Risk computer program was also undertaken to determine the \nprobability of the EIRR falling below 12%. The analysis shows a 15.3% risk that the Project \nwould not reach the minimum EIRR of 12% for economic viability. The economic analysis is \nsummarized in Appendix 12. \n \n49.  Resettlement.  The  highway  right-of-ways  (ROWs)  has  been  acquired,  and  it  was \nestablished and demarcated as early as the 1950s (Highway 12) and 2000 (Highway 359). The \nentire ROW of highways 12 and 359 will be cleared of all obstructions. The census and detailed \nmeasurement surveys carried out in October and November 2008 in Highway 359 identified \nabout 261 households. An additional 92 households were found during the census and detailed \nmeasurement  survey  in  March  2009  in  Highway  12.  These  households  had  stalls  and/or \nshelters and tilling paddy land inside the ROW. The resettlement plan prepared for the Project \nwas formulated in a way that recognizes that, while the ROWs of the two highways have been \nacquired, the affected people\u2019s livelihood will be able to continue with minimal disruption and \nthat their socioeconomic conditions will be maintained, if not improved. A copy of the project \nresettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix A and a summary of the resettlement plan is in \nAppendix 13. The DOH will assist by coordinating with the resettlement coordinating committee \nand Tambon Administration Office to find replacement land for stalls and shelters in a way that \nwill allow for the gradual transfer of business operation to the new site, thereby avoiding any \nbusiness disruption. Poor and vulnerable households will be given priority in choosing stalls in \nthe new sites. Consultation meetings were carried out during preparation of the resettlement \nplan,  and  key  information  was  disclosed  to  the  affected  people  before  ADB  appraisal. \nImplementation arrangements have been designed following a participatory approach, while a \ngrievance mechanism and monitoring have been established to ensure compliance with the \nresettlement plan from updating to implementation.  \n \n50.  Environmental Impacts. The Project will widen two sections of paved highways. Based \non the requirements of the ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), the Project has been classified as \nenvironmental  category  B  (sensitive)  because  the  alignment  along  Highway  12  (the \nPhitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak section) traverses the Thung Salaeng Luang National Park and several \nsensitive watershed designations. The highway was constructed in 1960, while the national park \nwas declared as such in 1975. The proposed highway expansion will be restricted to areas \nwithin the existing 60-meter ROW of Highway 12. The park designation does not extend inside \nthe ROW pursuant to the Royal Decree for Separation of Highway Right-of-Way from Thung \nSalaeng  Luang  National  Park.  Further,  all  portions  of  the  ROW  that  encompass  sensitive \nwatersheds or are adjacent to the national park have been previously disturbed or developed \nthrough activities such as logging, agriculture, or roadway and commercial construction. As \nsuch,  these  areas  are  in  a  degraded  condition  with  respect  to  ecological  resources.  The \nadjacent portions of the national park have also been previously degraded through similar \nactivities, as noted for the ROW. Native habitats generally are absent within 50\u201360 meters of \nthe ROW, and the most sensitive (core) habitat areas of the park are about 2 km or more south \nof the alignment. No protected areas, such as national parks, designated forests, or sensitive \n ", "  17 \nwatersheds, are within or adjacent to Highway 359 (the Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo section). \nThe section is in an area of generally level terrain and is predominantly agricultural. \n \n51.  The predicted environmental impacts during construction include air pollution, mainly \nfrom dust emissions; noise and vibration; water pollution from fuel spills and improper waste \ndisposal; soil erosion and siltation of water courses because of earthworks and extraction of \nborrow materials; and habitat loss from vegetation clearing. The Project is expected to improve \nthe ecological condition within the ROW of the two highway sections. The Project will include \nextensive  tree  replanting  (utilizing  native  species),  landscaping,  erosion  control,  slope \nstabilization, and water quality control. Wildlife crossings will also be provided for road sections \nalong Highway 12. These will be either project design or mitigation measures, and will include \napplicable  monitoring  programs  to  ensure  proper  function  and  identify  necessary  remedial \nmeasures. Impacts during the operations phase are expected to be limited mainly to air and \nnoise pollution from vehicles. The proposed project design includes a number of monitoring \nefforts to identify site-specific locations where regulatory standards cannot be met. In those \ncases, additional mitigation measures will be implemented, as appropriate. \n \n52.  An EMP has been prepared detailing mitigation and monitoring requirements, associated \nimplementation responsibilities, schedules, preliminary costs, reporting frequency, and capacity \nbuilding or training requirements. Timely and proper implementation of mitigation measures \ndefined in the EMP will help ensure that the Project will not significantly harm the environment. \nA copy of the summary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n53.  Gender. In the project area, poor women and households headed by females are more \nat risk economically (loss of productive assets because of construction activities) and socially \n(risks posed by HIV/AIDS, road safety, and possible human trafficking) than males. To address \nthe  loss  of  livelihoods  of  poor  women  and  households  headed  by  females,  the  project \nresettlement plan includes livelihood restoration targeted at women in the project districts. A \nproject-specific gender strategy has been prepared, as set out in the summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy (Appendix 4). The gender strategy includes capacity building training and \nconsultation workshop with affected households to increase their understanding of resettlement \nissues (such as compensation, entitlements, and grievance procedures), and to develop skills \nfor appropriate livelihood activities. The contractors and construction supervision consultant are \nalso encouraged to employ preferentially female workers from project-affected households for \ntheir office work positions. \n \n54.  HIV. To meet the challenge of an increase in sexually transmitted infections, including \nHIV, that can be directly linked to construction-based activities, mitigation measures have been \nincluded. As part of an HIV awareness campaign, activities will include the distribution of free \ncondoms to targeted groups, advice on access to testing and treatment for HIV and other \nsexually transmitted diseases, and greater awareness of behavior that increases risks. Activities \nunder this campaign will be consistent with the work proposed under the TA for HIV Prevention \nand Infrastructure: Mitigating Risk in the Greater Mekong Subregion, funded by the Government \nof Australia.16 Awareness activities, including capacity building of the DOH, will also address \nhuman trafficking, awareness on safe migration, and community monitoring. The Project will \nsupport campaigns in schools and temples of local communities to raise awareness of the \nnegative impacts of people trafficking. Consultations with a range of local experts (including law \nenforcement  officials)  strongly  suggested  that  there  is  little  causal  relationship  between \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2008. HIV Prevention and Infrastructure: Mitigating Risk in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila (TA6467-\nREG).  \n ", "18   \nwidening  of  these  highways  to  four  lanes  and  an  increase  in  people  trafficking  or  drug \ntrafficking. \n \n55.  Road Safety.  The four-lane highways are expected to provide road users with a safer \nenvironment compared with two-lane roads. However, to realize this benefit, road users who are \naccustomed to driving at low speeds on two-lane roads will have to adapt their behavior to the \nimproved four-lane highways. To address the adaptation process and other road safety issues, \nroad safety audits and road safety awareness campaigns are included in the tasks for the \nconstruction supervision consultant. \n \n56.  Project  Implementation.    Previous  road  sector  projects  in  Thailand  identified  the \nfollowing issues: (i) procurement was delayed because the DOH was not familiar with ADB\u2019s \nstandard  bidding  documents;  (ii)  some  covenants,  especially  on  submission  of  audited \naccounts, were not complied with; and (iii) an excessive number of components involving too \nmany executing agencies complicated project administration. To address these issues, the \nfollowing  measures  have  been  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  Project:  (i)  the  project \npreparation  TA  consultants  are  assisting  DOH  in  preparing  international  standard  contract \ndocumentation for the civil works following the requirements of ADB\u2019s international competitive \nbidding procedures, and will assist DOH in undertaking the procurement until the contracts are \nawarded; (ii) timely compliance with loan covenants will be addressed in all ADB loan review \nmissions; and (iii) the Project has only two components, and the DOH will be the Executing \nAgency for both. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES  \n57.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart  fund.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  the \nimplementation of the Project, adequate budgetary allocation of the required \ncounterpart funds are requested, approved and released in a timely manner to \nensure proper implementation of the Project. \n(ii)  Resettlement. The Government will ensure that: (a) any involuntary resettlement \nis  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  Resettlement  Plan,  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations  on  involuntary  resettlement.  In  case  of  differences  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB's Policy, ADB's Policy will prevail; \n(b)  adequate  resources  are  made  available  for  the  implementation  of  the \nResettlement Plan; (c) the Resettlement Plan is implemented effectively and in a \ntimely manner; (d) civil works contractors will assist DOH in the resettlement \nactivities, and do not commence construction work in a particular geographic \narea  until  the  affected  people  in  the  area  are  assisted  and  relocated  in \naccordance  with  the  agreed  Resettlement  Plan;  and  (e)  monitoring  of  the \nresettlement  activities  is  carried  out  and  related  reports  are  prepared  and \nsubmitted to ADB every quarter and uploaded onto the Government website \nwithin  two  weeks  of  their  submission  until  the  affected  people  have  been \nresettled and their income restored. \n(iii)  Social  protection.  The Government will ensure that all civil works contracts \nunder  the  Project  incorporate  provisions  and  budgets  to  the  effect  that \n ", "  19 \ncontractors:  (a)  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  labor  laws  and  applicable \ninternational treaty obligations and do not employ child labor; (b) provide safe \nworking  conditions  and  water  and  sanitation  facilities  for  male  and  female \nworkers; (c) provide equal wages to male and female workers for work of equal \nvalue;  (d)  provide  day-care  services  for  child-care  needs  of  the  female \nconstruction  workers;  and  (e)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \neducation and awareness campaigns in the construction campsites with such \ncampaigns being held in coordination with the Government\u2019s programs and other \ninitiatives.  \n(iv)  The Government will also ensure that, prior to construction of the community \ninfrastructure such as footbridges, pedestrian refuges and bus shelters under the \nProject, DOH carries out consultations with the local communities concerned to \nappropriately identify their needs and determine the optional location of such \ninfrastructure.  \n(v)  Gender. The Government will ensure that the Gender Strategy provided in the \nResettlement Plan and the Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy prepared for \nthe  Project  are  undertaken  to  maximize  Project  benefits  to  women.  The \nGovernment will (a) develop disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender and \nethnic group for purposes of monitoring and reporting; and (b) conduct gender \nsensitization training on gender and resettlement for its staff concerned. Where \nland is granted to affected people for compensation purposes, the Government \nand DOH will, when applicable, ensure joint registration of land or land use rights \nin the names of both the husband and wife.  \n(vi)  Environment. The Government will ensure that: (a) the Project is implemented \nin accordance with the Government\u2019s laws and regulations on environment, as \nwell as ADB's Environment Policy (2002), and that there is no significant damage \nto the natural environment as a result of the design, construction, operation and \nmaintenance of the Project facilities. If there is any discrepancy between the \nGovernment\u2019s laws and regulations, and ADB's environment policy, the ADB \npolicy requirements will apply; (b) the civil works contracts under the Project \ninclude specific measures to mitigate negative environmental impacts caused by \nthe  construction  activities  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) prepared for the Project, and the EMP \nwill  be  included  in  the  bidding  documents  as  a  basis  for  the  contractors  to \nprepare  site  specific  EMPs;  (c)  adequate  budget  and  staff  resources  are \nallocated for the EMP implementation; (d) the contractors engaged under the civil \nworks contracts are in strict compliance with all environmental impact mitigation \nand monitoring requirements set out in the EMP and contract documents; (e) \nquarterly progress reports cover the implementation of the EMP and include \nupdates  on  the  development  and  implementation  of  mitigation  measures, \nincluding  any  approved  changes  to  the  EMP;  and  (f)  in  case  of  any  future \nsubstantial  changes  in  the  Project  design  that  may  cause  significant \nenvironmental impact, if required, additional environmental study is undertaken \nand  corresponding  approval  from  the  Office  of  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironmental Policy and Planning and the Environmental National Board is \nobtained in a timely manner.

Introduction \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) comprises Cambodia, Yunnan Province and \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Lao People's \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  Myanmar,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  In  1992,  with  the \nassistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the six countries entered into a program of \nsubregional  economic  cooperation.  The  ultimate  objective  of  the  program  is  to  facilitate \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  to  improve  the  standard  of  living  of  the  people  in  the \nsubregion. The program has contributed to the development of infrastructure to enable the \ndevelopment and sharing of the resource base, and to promote a freer flow of goods and people \nin  the  subregion.  ADB\u2019s  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  update  for  the  GMS1 \nincludes  four  strategic  pillars,  the  first  of  which  addresses  strengthening  connectivity  and \nfacilitating cross-border movement and tourism. The high priority given to cooperation in the \ntransport sector is because of the poor state of the transport infrastructure in most of the GMS, \nwhich is a major constraint to economic growth, trade, and other forms of cooperation. Most \nfreight and passengers moved through the GMS by road. Although subregional traffic is still \nmodest relative to domestic traffic, the governments of the GMS countries give high priority to \nthe development of transport infrastructure links that will facilitate regional and international \ntrade  and  economic  cooperation,  especially  when  such  transport  facilities  also  serve  their \nrespective domestic needs.  \n \n2.  The  main  thrusts  of  regional  cooperation  in  the  transport  sector  have  been: \n(i) developing the north\u2013south corridor from Kunming in Yunnan Province of the PRC to Ho Chi \nMinh City in the southern part of Viet Nam, and the east\u2013west corridor from Thailand and the \ncentral coast of Viet Nam through Lao PDR; (ii) linking the capitals, other population centers, \nand major tourist destinations in the subregion; (iii) helping develop remote and low-income \nareas traversed by subregional road projects by improving access to markets, and social and \neconomic services; (iv) providing access to the sea for landlocked Lao PDR, and alternative \naccess  to  seaports  for  such  areas  as  northeastern  Thailand  and  Yunnan  Province;  and \n(v) reducing, with the objective of eliminating, nonphysical barriers (such as regulations covering \nborder crossings) to the movement of people and goods in the subregion.  \n \n3.  To help accelerate subregional economic cooperation the GMS countries adopted the \neconomic corridor approach to subregional development during the Eighth GMS Ministerial \nMeeting  held  in  Manila,  Philippines  in  1998.  Three  priority  GMS  economic  corridors  were \nidentified during that meeting: the East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC), the North\u2013South \nEconomic Corridor, and the Southern Economic Corridor (SEC). The development of these \ncorridors was subsequently designated as flagship initiatives under the Ten-Year GMS Strategic \nFramework, which leaders of the GMS countries endorsed during the First GMS Summit held in \nPhnom Penh, Cambodia in 2002. At the Third GMS Summit held in Vientiane, Lao PDR in \nMarch 2008, the GMS leaders stressed the need to redouble efforts to transform transport \ncorridors into economic corridors to maximize benefits from improved physical connectivity in \nthe subregion. GMS ministers reaffirmed this at their 15th meeting held in Cha-am, Thailand in \nJune 2009. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (2007\u20132009): The Greater Mekong Subregion\u2013\nBeyond Borders. Manila. \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nB.  Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Sector Strategy \n4.  The GMS transport sector strategy provides a framework that is implemented through \nindividual national strategies that often also involve subregional plans and agencies. Thus, each \nGMS member country has its own transport program developed for 5-year plans and as a basis \nfor year-to-year budgets. These programs are supported to varying degrees with sector policy \nstatements,  strategies,  objectives,  priorities, and  individual  project analyses.  The  programs \nincorporate consideration of the importance of undertaking GMS-related projects. While many \nregional and subregional cooperation groupings are involved in transport in the GMS, the GMS \nframework  allows  initiatives  to  be  endorsed at  the  highest  levels  of  leadership.  The  GMS \nconcept has rapidly become an effective forum for international cooperation\u2014from the working \nlevel to the heads of government level. This has provided the GMS with a leading role in \ncoordinating projects and in developing strategy.  \n \n5.  The GMS transport sector strategy study2 financed by ADB identified five key goals for \ntransport: (i) to exploit synergies in the GMS transport system; (ii) to move towards an open \nmarket for transport services; (iii) to facilitate economic efficiency to reduce transport costs; \n(iv) to complete the GMS network and improve links with South Asia; and (v) to encourage \nmultiple modes of transport. The GMS Highway Expansion Project will support these objectives \nby upgrading two sections of the Thai road system in two of the GMS corridors; EWEC and \nSEC.  \n \n6.  The GMS transport corridors include strategic roads in the national road networks, and \ninterconnections between these national transport networks. Generating trade and efficiency \nbenefits from these corridors requires that the underlying national networks are adequate and \nefficient. This has not been the case in most GMS countries. ADB has funded GMS transport \nsector projects in four of the six member countries, as listed in Appendix 3, but has made no \ncontribution  in  Thailand  or  in  Myanmar.  In  terms  of  investment  in  road  infrastructure,  the \nemphasis has been on the completion of \u201cmissing links\u201d in the corridors. Roads in Thailand have \nnot  been  a  high  priority  because  of  their  generally  good  design  standard  and  condition \ncompared with the other countries. Within Thailand, GMS corridor routes are developed as part \nof a wider program of road upgrading using domestic funding. Traffic on some sections of the \nGMS economic corridors in Thailand is increasing to levels where upgrading of these roads is \nnow required to prevent congestion. The combined impact of growing domestic traffic demand \nin Thailand and increasing cross-border traffic demand in step with rehabilitation and upgrading \nof the transport networks in the neighboring countries could soon exhaust the capacity of roads \nand highways in Thailand. Therefore, road network capacity in the GMS corridors must be \nmanaged to avoid defeating the purpose of developing these corridors. \nC.  The Greater Mekong Subregion Cross-Border Transport Agreement \n7.  The governments in the six GMS member countries have recognized that providing \nsubregional  physical  infrastructure  is  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient  condition  for  more \nconnectivity among the countries. Mitigating nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement \nof  goods  and  people  is  important  to  increase  efficiency,  reduce  costs,  and  maximize  the \neconomic benefits of improved subregional transport infrastructure. In 1996, ADB provided \ntechnical assistance (TA) 3  to the six GMS countries to (i) identify and assess priority transport-\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004.

Technical Assistance for the Mitigation of Nonphysical Barriers to Cross-Border Movement of Goods \nand People. Manila (TA 5686-REG). \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \n \nrelated cross-border issues, (ii) assess the viability of existing international conventions or \nagreements as possible \u201csolutions\u201d or \u201cresponses\u201d to the priority issues, (iii) identify and assess \nissues that existing international conventions or agreements do not address, and (iv) identify \nimplementation requirements for addressing priority issues. The findings of the TA showed that \nthe barriers to trade and the free movement of people between GMS countries were substantial. \nA number of nonphysical barriers impeding the free movement of vehicles, goods, and people \nacross international borders in the subregion were identified, including (i) restrictions on the \nentry of motor vehicles, often causing costly and time-consuming transshipment; (ii) different \nstandards pertaining to vehicle size, weight, safety requirements, and driver qualifications; (iii) \ninconsistent and difficult formalities related to customs procedures, inspections, clearances, and \nassessment of duties; and (iv) restrictive visa requirements.  \n \n8.  Bilateral agreements on cross-border movement exist between many GMS members. \nHowever, these agreements only partly address critical cross-border facilitation issues; and \nhinder transit movement of vehicles, goods, and people to third countries. In addition, the \nbilateral agreements between pairs of GMS countries are not necessarily consistent with each \nother and run the risk of having gaps and overlaps, thereby making transport facilitation even \nmore difficult. Therefore, a multilateral framework to facilitate the cross-border movement of \ngoods  and  people  on  a  subregion-wide  and  consistent  basis  is  necessary  to  allow  both \ninterstate and transit traffic. \n \n9.  The  GMS  Cross-Border  Transport  Agreement  (CBTA)  is  a  multilateral  instrument \nadopted  by  all  GMS  members  to  facilitate  cross-border  transport  of  goods  and  people. \nFormulated under ADB-funded TA,4 the CBTA provides a practical approach to streamline \nregulations and reduce nonphysical barriers in the GMS over the short to medium term. It \nincludes  measures  such  as  more  efficient  inspection  procedures  and  reciprocal  traffic \nregulations. The CBTA incorporates the principles of bilateral or multilateral action, and flexibility \nin recognizing differences in procedures in each of the GMS countries. It includes references to \ninternational conventions that have demonstrated their usefulness in a broad range of countries. \nThe CBTA also takes into account, and is consistent with, similar initiatives of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which five of the six GMS countries are members. In this \nregard, ADB consults and coordinates extensively with the United Nations Economic and Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific and the ASEAN Secretariat to ensure the consistency of \nthe CBTA with international conventions and regional agreements. ADB has also consulted with \nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to learn from its experience in promoting \ncross-border land transport in Europe. \n \n10.  The CBTA  became effective in December 2003 with its ratification by all six GMS \nmember countries. The 20 implementing annexes of the CBTA were negotiated during 2003\u2013\n2007,  and  all  six  GMS  countries  signed  them  by  March  2007.  Except  for  Myanmar  and \nThailand, GMS countries have ratified all 20 annexes, rendering them effective among them. \nWhile countries are in the process of ratifying the 20 annexes and protocols, to achieve early \nresults in transport and trade facilitation, the countries agreed to implement the CBTA initially at \nseven key border crossings5 from the long list of designated border crossings in the CBTA.

However, implementation has not started, as the two countries have not agreed on the \nestablishment  of  common  control  area  at  the  buffer  zone  of  the  borders.  Thailand  and \nCambodia are working to begin bilateral exchange of traffic rights' arrangements through the \nAranyaprathet\u2013Poipet border crossing based on an MOU signed by the two governments at the \nThird GMS Summit. At the border of Mukdahan (Thailand) with Savannakhet (Lao PDR) along \nthe EWEC, Thailand, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam signed an MOU in August 2007 to implement the \nexchange  of  traffic  rights'  provisions  of  the  CBTA  and  a  GMS  customs  transit  quarantine \nsystem; implementation of the MOU started in June 2009. ADB is providing assistance to these \ninitiatives through regional TA.6   \n \n11.  Key challenges for the effective implementation of the CBTA include (i) establishing \nefficient  management  systems  and  associated  capacity  building;  (ii)  streamlining  and \nharmonizing border control documents; (iii) preparing revised manuals of operation at the border \ncheckpoints  and  associated  training;  (iv)  establishing  required  infrastructure,  and,  in  some \ncases, relocating and/or modifying layouts of border checkpoints, as well as providing common \ncontrol areas to allow single-stop inspection and single-window inspection; and (v) mitigating \nnegative externalities associated with increased cross-border movement. The CBTA will apply \nto selected and mutually agreed upon routes and points of entry and exit in the signatory \ncountries.  \n \n12.  An ongoing diagnostic study has identified key issues that need to be addressed for the \ntimely, effective, and sustainable implementation of the CBTA and other transport and trade \nfacilitation (TTF) initiatives: (i) ratification of the CBTA and its annexes and protocols has taken \nlonger than expected, and ratification does not mean implementation in most GMS countries; (ii) \na  strategic  and  integrated  approach  to  TTF  is  needed;  (iii)  institutional  arrangements  are \ninsufficient to allow sustainable and effective coordination; (iv) border checkpoints and other \nrelated infrastructure remain a constraint; (v) there is a need to focus on results and ensure \ncoordination; and (vi) the private sector's awareness of and involvement in the CBTA have been \ninsufficient. Based on this study, a strategy and work program for the timely and effective \nimplementation  of  the  TTF  initiatives,  including  the  CBTA,  has  been  proposed.  A  single, \nintegrated TTF project, under one management or specialist team, has been identified with 11 \ncomponents  and  subprojects  (clusters  of  related  activities)  covering  transport  facilitation, \ncustoms, sanitary and phytosanitary inspection, support to TTF institutions, trade logistics, and \nestablishment of a GMS freight transport association. \nD.  Economic Corridor Development \n13.  The role of economic corridors in GMS development is reflected in the Joint Statement \nof the Eighth GMS Ministerial Meeting in 1998. It stated that \u201cGMS member countries will create \neconomic corridors linking the subregion to major markets; nodal points within these economic \ncorridors  will  serve  as  centers  for  enterprise  development;  economic  corridors  will  be  an \nexpansion of key transport corridors so as to enhance economic activities and benefits, and \nover the longer term to build on the potential of the subregion as a land bridge serving the PRC, \nSoutheast Asia, South Asia and East Asia.\u201d7 \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Transport and Trade Facilitation in the GMS. Manila (TA 6450-\nREG). \n7  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/Mekong/Proceedings/min8_app4.asp \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n \n14.  Conceptually,  GMS  economic  corridor  development  involves  a  holistic,  multisector \napproach,  where  infrastructure  development  is  linked  with  trade,  investment,  and  other \neconomic, social, and environmental opportunities. The development of economic corridors8 is \nexpected  to  help  in  achieving  the  vision  of  the  GMS  as  a  prosperous,  harmonious,  and \nintegrated  subregion  through  more  connectivity,  enhanced  competitiveness,  and  a  greater \nsense of community. It supports the strategic thrusts of the GMS 10-Year Strategic Framework: \n(i) strengthening infrastructure links; (ii) facilitating cross-border trade, investment, and tourism; \n(iii) enhancing private sector participation and competitiveness; (iv) protecting the environment \nand  promoting  sustainable  use  of  shared  natural  resources;  and  (v)  developing  human \nresources and skills competencies. From a broader perspective, the development of the GMS \neconomic corridors offers a means for the less-developed member countries of ASEAN to catch \nup  with  the  more  economically  advanced  member  countries,  and  to  reinforce  the  market \nintegration process that is increasing in East Asia. \n \n15.  Operationally,  the  economic  corridor  approach  aims  to  (i)  extend  the  benefits  of \nimproved transport links to remote and landlocked locations in the GMS, which have been \ndisadvantaged by their lack of integration with more prosperous and better-located neighboring \nareas; (ii) provide a spatial focus to GMS activities, with the backbone, growth centers, and \nnodal points serving as catalysts for the development of surrounding areas; (iii) open up many \nopportunities for investments from within and outside the GMS; (iv) enhance the impact of \nsubregional activities through the clustering of projects; (v) serve as a mechanism for prioritizing \nand  coordinating  investments  among  neighboring  countries;  and  (vi)  generate  tangible \ndemonstration effects. \n \nE.  Impact of Greater Mekong Subregion Strategy on Traffic Growth \n \n16.  On most roads, cross-border traffic is a fraction of domestic traffic, but its share of total \ntraffic is increasing. Passenger traffic has grown as a result of increased domestic demand and \ntourism, while commodity trade between the GMS countries has grown more quickly than trade \nin general. In 1992, about 5.7% of total GMS country trade was between GMS countries; by \n2003, it had risen to 12.0%, a period in which total trade grew rapidly. Within the GMS transport \nsector strategy study, a preliminary version of the GMS transport model (GTM) was developed \nto estimate traffic flows in the subregion to 2015. The analysis was based on both demand-side \nfactors and supply-side issues. Demand-side factors included forecasts of key economic and \ndemographic factors: (i) gross domestic product (GDP), (ii) population, (iii) GDP per capita, (iv) \nexports, (v) imports, and (vi) tourist arrivals. Supply-side issues included infrastructure and \npolicy. Therefore, the GTM enabled the assessment of the impact of changes in, for example, \nroad condition or faster border procedures. The GTM needs further work before it is accurate \nenough to analyze specific subprojects, but the traffic flow projections indicate that the GMS \nstrategy will lead to higher traffic levels on many routes.  \n \n17.  A more recent study funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency,9 building on \nthe GTM, examined five scenarios representing a range of improvements\u2014from infrastructure \nimprovements in specific corridors to full implementation on the CBTA at all major border points \n                                                 \n8   An economic corridor is not simply a connection between points A and B. The movement of people and goods can \noriginate from and end at any intermediate point between points A and B. The impact of an economic corridor also \ngoes beyond the main route or \u201cline.\u201d It extends to the areas that can be accessed, or areas whose access to major \neconomic centers could be improved through the connection between points A and B. \n9  Japan International Cooperation Agency and ALMEC Corporation. 2007.

Evidence suggests that by stimulating economic diversification and improving cross-\nborder traffic flows and facilities, the GMS strategy has already led to an increase in subregional \nflows of passengers and freight traffic. Of significance for this Project, the traffic count results for \nrecent years show rapid growth in traffic on the project section nearest international borders. \nTraffic volume on the Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo section doubled between 2003 and 2007. \nTherefore, the Project is seen in terms of providing adequate road standards for traffic levels \nthat are projected to rise as a result of the generally improved connectivity along the corridors, \nrather than the Project itself directly stimulating economic growth and traffic flows.  \n \n \n                                                 \n10  There are 40 class I cross-border points between GMS countries where people and goods traffic between the two \nbordering countries, as well as traffic from third countries, is allowed to pass through. \n11  In the report, the additional traffic generated is estimated at the sum of traffic generated in (or attracted to) one \nGMS country that was attracted to (or generated in) all other countries. \n12  Gross regional domestic product is estimated at the sum of economic activity in the country, stemming from cross-\nborder traffic. \n ", "  Appendix 3  29 \n \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION \nSector: Transport, Information and Communication Technology Sector \nThemes: Economic Growth, Private Sector Development, and Regional Cooperation  \n \nA.

JICA's  assistance  to  Thailand  in  the \ntransport  sector  is  linked  to  the promotion of regional  cooperation  for  the  development  of \nneighboring countries. The Second Mekong International Bridge, completed in 2006, is an \nintegral part of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) East\u2013West Economic Corridor. JICA does \nnot provide financial support for road projects in Thailand at present, but JICA is providing a \nloan to construct a mass rapid transit system aiming to alleviate traffic congestion, and improve \nthe urban environment in the Bangkok metropolitan area.   \n \n3.  World Bank. The World Bank provided a loan for the Highways Management project in \n2004. The development objective of the project is to enhance the efficiency, productive use, and \nmanagement  of  Thailand's  road  network.  Specifically,  the  project  supports  the \ncommercialization of the road sector, strengthens the operations of the Department of Highways \n(DOH), helps preserve road assets, and improves competition and transparency in the award of \ncontracts. The project has four components: (i) highway rehabilitation and maintenance, (ii) \nhighway  upgrading  and  intersection  improvement,  (iii)  road  safety  improvement,  and  (iv) \ninstitutional strengthening. The fourth component includes technical assistance (TA) for the \ndevelopment of a framework for and a case study on public\u2013private partnerships in highways.  \n \nB.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n4.  The Ministry of Finance in Thailand requested ADB and the World Bank to jointly assist \nin financing the DOH Four-Lane Highway Widening Project (Phase II) to upgrade about 433 km \nof eight national highway sections from a two-lane highway standard to a four-lane divided \nhighway standard. ADB will provide funding for two sections on the East\u2013West and Southern \nEconomic Corridors, the World Bank will provide funding for five sections, and the DOH will \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nfinance one section. While ADB and the World Bank have prepared separate projects to cover \ntheir respective sections, the institutions have cooperated closely with each other to harmonize \nand standardize documentation and procedures, to the extent possible. \n \n5.  Over the past 10 years, the Government's highway subsector strategy has focused on \nmaking  national  highways  four  lanes.  However,  during  this  period,  intercity  motorways  or \nadditional expressways in the vicinity of Bangkok have not been emphasized, and a coherent \npublic investment plan for intercity motorways does not exist. The World Bank-financed TA for \nthe DOH provided recommendations for private sector participation in financing, construction, \noperations, and maintenance activities of intercity motorways, and also provided documentation \nfor procurement of the Bang Pa-In to Nakhon Ratchasima Motorway.  \n \n6.  ADB's TA study under the GMS Highway Expansion Project will build upon the World \nBank's TA and concentrate on three motorway links: (i) Chonburi to Map Ta Put, including an \naccess link to Laem Chabang Port; (ii) Bang Yai to Nakhon Pathom (Bang Pong) to Cha-am; \nand (iii) Nakhon Pathom to Kanchanaburi. ADB's TA study will provide the Government with a \ndetailed  implementation  plan  for  the  motorway  corridors,  and  identify  implementation \narrangements using an appropriate public\u2013private partnership model. Through the respective \nloan projects and TAs, ADB and the World Bank will continue to work closely together on \nimproving Thailand's capacity to structure public\u2013private partnerships in the road subsector. \n \n7.  In the context of development partner coordination at the subregional level under the \nGMS program, the Government of Thailand has taken steps to develop the GMS North\u2013South \nand Southern Economic Corridors, and facilitate cross-border operations.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.    Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Project is not directly linked to Thailand\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy, but rather to Thailand\u2019s desire to deepen \npartnerships with its neighbors. It reflects a strong appreciation that inclusive and sustainable development in the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) brings growth and stability to Thailand. Similarly, if Thailand\u2019s economy is strong, this will \ncontribute to growth, development, and poverty reduction in neighboring countries. As a middle-income country, Thailand is \nalso expected to assume a leadership role in maintaining and providing regional public goods, and in addressing cross-border \nissues such as environmental management, the trafficking of drugs and people, and the control of communicable diseases. In \nline  with  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  8  (Global  Partnerships),  these  economic,  social,  and  environmental \ninterdependencies highlight the importance of strengthening Thailand\u2019s role, capacity, and effectiveness as a development \npartner. \n \nThailand plays a crucial role in realizing the four major areas of the GMS regional cooperation strategy and program by (i) \nstrengthening connectivity and facilitating cross-border movement and tourism; (ii) integrating national markets to promote \neconomic efficiency and private sector development; (iii) addressing health and other social, economic, and capacity building \nissues associated with subregional links; and (iv) managing the environment and shared natural resources, especially \nwatershed systems of the Mekong River. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                          Targeting Classification:  General intervention  \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe  gross  provincial  product  (GPP)  of  the  project  provinces  reflects  the  fundamentally  different  levels  of  economic \ndevelopment in the provinces within the project area. Of the project provinces, the province with the highest GPP is \nChachoengsao at B160,511,000, which makes it the seventh-largest province in terms of GPP in Thailand. This is not \nsurprising because it is one of the five provinces contiguous with the greater Bangkok area. The province with the second-\nhighest GPP is Khon Kaen at B92,081,000, followed by Prachin Buri at B62,164,000, Phitsanulok at B40,146,000, and \nPhetchabun at B39,816,000. However, much of the economic development takes place around the major cities, including \nKhon Kaen (the major center for economic development on the East\u2013West Economic Corridor), Phitsanulok, and along the \nSouthern Corridor in Chachoengsao and Prachin Buri. \n \nThe Project has not been designed specifically reduce poverty. Thailand is the least poor of the GMS countries with an official \npoverty headcount ratio of 8% in 2007 based on B1,386 per capita per month. In northern Thailand, where Highway 12 \ntraverses, the poverty rate is 12%; and in central Thailand, where Highway 359 traverses, the poverty rate is 3%. However, \naccording to the data collected during project preparation, using poverty lines specific to each of the impacted provinces, the \npoverty rates range from a high of 20.4% in Phetchabun (Highway 12) to a low of 3.2% in Chachoengsao (Highway 359). The \npoverty rates in the major cities are as follows: 9.0% in Khon Kaen (Highway 12), 12.0% in Phitsanulok (Highway 12), and \n13.8% in Sa Kaeo (Highway 359). Nevertheless, all of the project areas stand out as being considerably more developed \nsocially and economically than elsewhere in the GMS, although levels of inequality are greater than in neighboring Lao PDR, \nViet Nam, and southwestern People's Republic of China (PRC). \n \nThe economic rationale underlying the widening of these GMS corridor highways to four lanes is that they will reduce the cost \nof delays for passenger and freight traffic. The lower costs for freight traffic will reduce the costs for goods consumed in the \nlocal market and will improve the competitive advantage of producers. New economic activity along all corridors could create \njobs for the poor.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \nThe Project does not include pro-poor design, although some potential exists for the local hire of daily wage labor for some of \nthe construction activities. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nNot Applicable. \n \n  \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  33 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe social and poverty analysis was conducted to assess the social and poverty impacts of this Project on people living in the \nprovinces in northern and eastern Thailand where the two highways traverse. The economy in the project area depends \nmainly on agriculture and natural resources. The project area does not have any legal commercial forestry, as the forests of \nwere almost completely logged out long ago. Access to forests to collect non-timber forest products is circumscribed, although \npermitted in some instances. Shrimp and prawn farming are relatively important in Chachoengsao because of its proximity to \nthe Gulf of Thailand, but not in other provinces. Areas that have access to year-round sources of water have some small-\nscale aquaculture, but such areas are few. Livestock-rearing is important in the project area. Elsewhere, project area shows \nlittle evidence of contract farming, except perhaps among vegetable growers such as the Hmong, who provide a range of \ncool-weather  vegetables  (e.g.,  peas,  beans,  and  broccoli)  to  high-end  supermarkets  in  Thailand.  However,  with  the \nestablishment of biofuel factories to extract the juice of sugarcane for use in vehicles, some form of contract-based sugarcane \nfarming is likely, because these factories require a guaranteed supply of harvested sugarcane. Apart from the manufacture of \npulp and paper products and biofuels, the project area has little real manufacturing. However, there are many examples and \nsmall amounts of products being manufactured locally. Service industries are well developed in the major provincial centers, \nalthough Khon Kaen is the most developed in terms of education and health care. Other sectors, such as tourism, are not \nvery well developed in the project area, except in Phetchabun. Better roads in the project area will facilitate travel to popular \ntourist destinations, and it is assumed that local business will benefit as well because of increased traffic. In general, the \nproject area offers fewer jobs outside agriculture than in other more economically diversified provinces of Thailand. School \ncompletion rates are typically lower in the project area than elsewhere in Thailand. Thus, the project area has fewer formally \nwell-educated people than in the main centers of Thailand\u2019s economic development.   \n \nAlthough the Project is not explicitly linked to poverty reduction issues, it does have some positive impacts relating to poverty \nreduction, including (i) agriculture-based income-generation activities (e.g., the ability to meet unmet demand for pork, beef, \nand chicken products in other GMS countries, especially the PRC; and importing sugarcane and cassava from the Lao PDR \nfor value-adding into bio-fuels), resulting in the generation of more jobs, and widening highways to four lanes also makes it \neasier for poor farmers to transport crops such as sugarcane and cassava to biofuel processing plants in northeastern \nThailand; and (ii) anticipated growth in domestic, regional, and international tourism, especially enabling regional tourists from \nother GMS countries to visit this part of Thailand rather than flying directly into the major tourist areas in Thailand such as \nBangkok, Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai, and for poorer people the existing forms of agro-tourism (including farm stays) \nincrease  the  possibilities  for  non-farm-based  livelihood  opportunities.  Other  positive  impacts  include  the  (i)  greater \ndevelopment of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially with the bridging finance afforded when activities can be \nlinked to Thailand\u2019s One-Tambon (subdistricts), One-Product program; (ii) revitalization of local culture and preservation of \ntraditional skills, including dance, music, embroidery, and silk-weaving; and, (iii) promotion of greater regional cultural \nunderstanding in a region where it has taken more than 4 decades to transcend lingering cultural doubts about GMS \nneighbors. \n \nThe main social and livelihood impacts of the Project are related to temporary loss of stallholders\u2019 incomes, increase in \nsexually  transmitted  infections  including  HIV/AIDS,  possible  increase  in  people  trafficking,  possible  increase  in  drug \ntrafficking, depletion of common property resources, and an increased risk of road accidents.  \n \nNegative resettlement impacts have been mitigated in the resettlement plan prepared for the Project. To meet the challenge \nof an increase in sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS that can be directly linked to construction-based activities, \na number of mitigation measures have been included. The HIV awareness campaign will include the distribution of free \ncondoms to targeted groups, advice on access to testing and treatment for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, and \nincreasing awareness of behavior that increases risks. Awareness activities will also address human trafficking, including \ncapacity building of the Executing Agency, awareness on safe migration, and community monitoring. In the schools and \ntemples of local communities, the Project will support measures to reinforce awareness of the negative impacts of people \ntrafficking. Consultations with a range of local experts (including law enforcement officials) strongly suggested that there is \nlittle causal relationship between making these highways four lanes and an increase in people trafficking or drug trafficking. A \nroad safety awareness program will address risks of increased traffic accidents. The environment management plan includes \nmeasures to address dust- and pollution-related issues. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultation meetings were held with project-affected people to discuss the impact of the Project on resettlement and \nenvironmental impacts. Meetings were held in all of the subdistricts within the project areas, and the results of these meetings \nwere incorporated into the project resettlement plan, environmental impact assessment, and environmental management \nplan. \n \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \nDuring project construction, consultation will continue during updating and implementation of the resettlement plan. A series of \nconsultations with affected people will be held during the detailed measurement survey.  \n \nTo minimize the risk of the highways dividing local communities by disrupting existing local road communications, the \nDepartment of Highways has already discussed with local communities construction of highway-crossing facilities including \nunderpasses and overpasses. The need for and location of these facilities will be confirmed during the detailed engineering \ndesign. Planning for community infrastructure will be through local committees; membership of these committees will consist \nof representatives of the District Highway Office, project consultants, and representatives of the local communities. Local \ncommunities will be consulted to determine the maximum distance between facilities to cross the highways\u2014by either \noverpasses or underpasses\u2014to avoid the disruption of livelihood and social networks and the existing local road system. \nCommunity consultations will be facilitated by the construction supervision consultant\u2019s team.  \n    \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nA separate C&P plan is not required. Consultation and participatory processes have been mainstreamed in relevant project \ncomponents and documents such as the resettlement plan and environmental impact assessment. The resettlement plan and \nenvironmental impact assessment report include appendixes on the consultation process.  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. \nThe Project will improve sections of the highway network. Project impacts relate to (i) increased risks of exposure to HIV/AIDS \nand trafficking of women and children during construction and the post-construction phase because of large volumes of transit \ntraffic along the road; and (ii) poor women in the project area more at risk economically (loss of productive assets because of \nconstruction work) and socially (risks posed by HIV/AIDS, road safety, and possible human trafficking) than males. On the \nother hand, the Project can create jobs for poor women during construction. The negative impacts relating to resettlement, \nHIV/AIDS, and human trafficking will be addressed through a gender strategy in the resettlement plan and HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevention of human trafficking awareness program.  \n \n2.  Key Actions.    Gender plan         Other actions/measures    No action/measure      \n \nA project-specific gender strategy has been prepared and has been included in the resettlement plan. An HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking awareness program will target women.  \n \nThe gender strategy includes the following specific activities to ensure project benefits for women:  \n(i)  Consultation meeting on resettlement activities will be held separately with women, households headed by \nfemales, and elderly women.  \n(ii)  At the inception of the Project, community-level meeting will be held with the affected households to orient them \nabout resettlement activities. Participation of poor women, households headed by females, and ethnic minorities \n(if any) in the meeting will be ensured.  \n(iii)  The inception meeting will provide information on resettlement activities, compensation, grievance procedures, \nand potential impacts of the Project on livelihood activities related to loss of agricultural produce, and other \nproductive assets. The objective of the meeting is to provide affected communities with understanding of \nresettlement issues and better access to compensation resources and information on grievance procedures. \n(iv)  During preparation of the detailed measurement survey (DMS), men and women from affected households will \nparticipate in the preparation of the DMS. \n(v)  Local level committees for community infrastructure will include women from the community to plan community \ninfrastructure activities. \n(vi)  If compensation is to be paid, it will be given to both men and women from the households. Specific attention will \nbe provided for households headed by poor women or elderly women to ensure that compensation is paid on \ntime. \n(vii)  Relocation of houses will include separate discussions with women from affected households, households \nheaded by females, elderly women, and ethnic minority households (if any).  \n(viii)  The Department of Highways will conduct an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness campaign during the \nconstruction and post construction phases. The provision of educational materials, workshop, and campaigns on \nHIV/AIDS and a human trafficking prevention program will be conducted separately for women. \n(ix)  All employment for the Project will respect the Government\u2019s commitments to gender equity, including staffing in \nthe project implementation unit and resettlement committees. Construction contractors will ensure that (a) no \nchild labor will be used; (b) men and women are paid equally for work for equal value; (c)  basic facilities (water \n ", "  Appendix 4  35 \nand sanitation) for men and women workers are provided in the construction camps; (d) separate bathing and \ntoilet facilities are provided for women workers; and (e) day care services will be provided for the children of \nwomen construction workers.  \n(x)  Disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender will be developed for monitoring of social benefits, economic \nopportunities,  livelihood  program,  road  safety,  resettlement  activities,  HIV/AIDS,  and  human  trafficking \nprevention program. \n(xi)  The monitoring indicators will include (a) women's participation in resettlement committees, capacity building \ntraining, consultation meeting, livelihood training, and restoration of income; (b) recruitment of women laborers \nin construction, provision of separate bathing and toilet  facilities in the construction site, and child care facility in \nconstruction camp; and (c) participation of women in road safety awareness campaign.  \n(xii)  Women's and girls' awareness on safe migration, human trafficking, and HIV/AIDS will be enhanced.  \n(xiii)  The project-specific gender strategy with be implanted by the Executing Agency in collaboration with the project \nconstruction supervision consultants.  \n(xiv)  National consultants with expertise in social development and gender will be included in the consulting services \nfor the implementation of the gender strategy. Terms of reference for the social development and gender are \nincluded in consulting services. The budget to implement the gender strategy is included in the resettlement plan \nand consulting service package. The social development and gender specialist will monitor implementation of \nthe gender strategy in various components of the Project. \n \nIII.

Civil Works Scope \n \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Highway Expansion Project involves upgrading \nabout  178  kilometers  (km)  of  two-lane  national  highways  to  a  four-lane  divided  highway \nstandard. Works include new bridges and widening of existing bridges, reinforced concrete box \nand  pipe  culvert  improvements,  new  asphaltic  concrete  pavement  sections,  and  the \nstrengthening  and  overlay  of  existing  pavement  sections.  In  addition,  roadway  safety \nimprovements, such as provision for pedestrian overpasses, improved signage and pavement \nmarkings, and pavement widening at bus stops, will be incorporated into the improvements. The \n178 km are along two sections of highways: (i) Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak (105 km) is on the GMS \nEast\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC); and (ii) Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo (73 km) is along \nthe GMS Southern Economic Corridor (SEC). \n \nB.  Highway 12 from Phitsanulok to Lom Sak \n \n2.  The east\u2013west alignment of the Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak section (Highway 12) connects \ntwo of the primary north\u2013south corridors (Highways 11 and 21) in central-northern Thailand. It is \nthe  primary  road  connecting  two  of  the  richest  provinces  of  the  region,  Phitsanulok  and \nPhetchabun. The western end of the Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak section starts in the Nan river valley \nnear Wong Thong district, at an elevation of 50 meters and climbs more than 700 meters as it \ncrosses through a series of small mountain passes.1 It passes through Nakhon Thai and Khao \nKho districts, and then descends about 600 meters until it reaches the expansive Issan Plateau \nnear an elevation of 160 meters in Lom Sak district.   \n \n3.  The horizontal and vertical alignments in the mountainous terrain are often severe, \nrequiring significant reductions in design speed. Many of these sections will necessitate large \nvolumes of civil works earthwork quantities to complete improvements to a four-lane standard. \nThe  existing  two-lane  road  is  centered  within  the  60-meter  right-of-way  (ROW),  and \nconsequently  little  of  the  existing  roadway  section  or  bridges  can  be  salvaged  during  the \nwidening work.2 The roadway section will be upgraded within the limit of existing ROW to the \nDepartment of Highways (DOH) four-lane divided class standard, i.e., traffic lanes 3.5\u20134.0 \nmeters wide, outer paved shoulders 2.0\u20132.5 meters wide, and inner paved shoulders 1.5\u20132.0 \nmeters wide. Construction will be divided into five contract packages. The primary civil works \ncomprise  widening  of  embankments  and  cut  sections  to  accommodate  the  new  four-lane \nhighway;  construction  of  sub-base  and  base  courses,  and  asphaltic  concrete  pavements; \nreplacing  and  lengthening  of  existing  cross  drainage  structures.  The  works  also  include  a \nsignificant amount of erosion control and slope stabilization works (utilizing various geo-grid and \nreinforced earth slope protection techniques). The median width will vary greatly because of the \nroughness of the terrain, and the necessity to keep all limits of construction within the existing \nROW. Medians sections include a 9-meter depressed median in open, flat areas; a 5.1-meter \nraised median with street lighting in more built-up areas; and a 3.8-meter wide median with \nconcrete barrier. Six at-grade road intersections will be improved with channelization suitable for \nthe new four-lane highway. \n \n                                                 \n1  The alignment also passing along the northern edge of the Thung Salaeng Luang National Park. \n2  At the 10 locations requiring bridge improvements, existing bridges at seven locations will be demolished and \nreplaced with new four-lane bridges, totaling 273 meters in length; and existing two-lane bridges will be salvaged at \nthree locations, and widened left and right to four lanes, with bridge work at these locations totaling 152 meters in \nlength. \n ", "  Appendix 5  37 \n \nC.  Highway 359 from Phanom Sarakham to Sa Kaeo \n \n4.  The Project, located at the eastern end of the Thai section of the SEC, passes through \nsections of three provinces of eastern Thailand: Chachoengsao, Prachin Buri, and Sa Kaeo. \nThe Project starts in Phanom Sarakham district at the junction with Highway 304, and passes \nthrough 4 rural districts until reaching Sa Kaeo district just west of the provincial capital of Sa \nKaeo.  \n \n5.  The road section traverses flat terrain and detailed designs for horizontal and vertical \ngeometry will easily be within allowable DOH criteria for four-lane divided class. The existing \ntwo-lane  construction  is  offset  within  the  60-meter  ROW,  which  will  greatly  facilitate  the \nwidening to four lanes. All existing two-lane bridges will be utilized, and nine new two-lane \nbridges totaling 214 meters in length will be constructed. The typical roadway section for this \nsubproject will be upgraded to DOH class, i.e., traffic lanes 3.5\u20134.0 meters wide, outer paved \nshoulders  2.0\u20132.5  meters  wide,  and  inner  paved  shoulders  1.5\u20132.0  meters  wide.  The \nconstruction will be divided into two construction packages. The primary civil works comprise \nconstruction of new embankments; construction of sub-base and base courses, and asphaltic \nconcrete pavements; and improving existing cross drainage. A typical 9 meters depressed \nmedian will be used throughout. \n \n ", "   \n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n3\n  8\n \n \nTable A6.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \nA\n  p\np\ne\n         Total Cost      Total Cost   % of Total   n\nd\n Item      B million     $ Million  Base Costs  ix 6\nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  transport  sector  in  Thailand  is  significantly  more  developed  than  the  transport \nsectors in its neighboring countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion countries. The degree of \ndevelopment of the road subsector is particularly well advanced in Thailand. The road network \ncomprises  about  202,000  kilometers  (km),  of  which  51,500  km  is  classified  as  highways, \n150,000  km  are  rural  roads,  and  about  450  km  are  controlled  access  expressways  or \nmotorways. The Department of Highways (DOH) of the Ministry of Transport (MOT) is the \nprimary  government  agency  responsible  for  the  planning,  construction,  maintenance,  and \noperation of the road network in Thailand. It is also responsible for cooperation and coordination \nwith highway agencies in neighboring countries. \n \n2.  In April 1997, the Cabinet approved a 20-year intercity motorway network master plan, \nconsisting of 13 networks, totaling 4,150 km, with an estimated construction cost of B472 billion \nand right-of-way cost of B66 billion. However, the Government's highway subsector strategy \nsince has focused on widening national highways to four lanes, and there has been little \nemphasis on intercity motorways or additional expressways in the vicinity of Bangkok. Much of \nthe  planning  and  programming  of  the  ongoing  DOH  Four-Lane  Highway  Widening  Project \n(Phase II)1 takes adequate notice of the need to expand such improvements to connect with key \nborder road crossings with its neighbors, primarily with Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR)  and  Cambodia.  However,  a  coherent  public  investment  plan  with  regard  to  intercity \nmotorways does not appear to exist. \n \nB.  World Bank's Precursor Study \n \n3.  The  World  Bank's  Highways  Management  Project2  included  a  recently  completed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  component  that  was  prepared  for  the  DOH.  It  provided \nrecommendations  to  implement  a  restructured  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in \nfinancing, construction, operations, and maintenance activities. The draft final report, in three \nvolumes,3 was submitted in September 2008. This TA was been developed around three tasks:   \n(i)  review and study existing market issues and regulatory structures for the Thai \nroad subsector (motorways, expressways, and highways); \n(ii)  study and recommend policy, legal, and regulatory framework to ensure a clear \nseparation  of  responsibilities  and  to  provide  effective  management  of  road \ninfrastructure, taking into account the current legislative regime and international \nbest practices; and to develop a program for increasing the institutional capacity \nof the DOH (or a successor agency, i.e., a new \"Roads Authority\"), which will be \nresponsible for managing public\u2013private partnership assets; and  \n(iii)  prepare a preliminary technical and financial assessment of the Bang Pa-In to \nNakhon  Ratchasima  Motorway,  as  a  case  study,  including  preparation  of  a \n                                                 \n1  The Four-Lane Highway Widening Project (Phase II) encompasses 4,366 km of widening at an estimated cost of \n$2.58 billion; Phase I was completed at a cost of $1.15 billion, covering 1,891 km. \n2  An $84.3 million loan; approved 9 December 2003 under the Streamlined Procedure; Washington, D.C.; with loan \neffectiveness extended to 30 June 2009. \n3  World Bank and Mott MacDonald (Thailand) Ltd. et al. 2007.

The three volumes are (i) draft final \nreport; (ii) draft public\u2013private partnership contract; and (iii) motorway assessment report. \n ", "  Appendix 11  49 \nconcession agreement for a public\u2013private partnership to finance, implement, \nand operate the motorway. \n \n4.  The two investment options that are being most prominently considered are: (i) setting \nup a toll road investment fund to mobilize funds from the private sector; and (ii) a build-operate-\ntransfer  agreement,  with  the  public  sector  providing  a  subsidy  sufficient  to  encourage \ninvestment interest from the private sector. \n \n5.  The World Bank intends to include a follow-up advisory TA component to their new loan \nfor the second phase of the Highway Management Project to assist the Government in moving \nahead with a public\u2013private partnership project to implement the first section of the Bang Pa-In \nto Nakhon Ratchasima Motorway, i.e., from Bang Pa-In to Sarabari. \n \nC.  The Government's Strategy  \n \n6.  In anticipation of the need for certain reforms to the Thai legal framework, and to be \ncompatible with international norms and requirements that will arise with the utilization of public\u2013\nprivate partnership contracts, the MOT has drafted a new transport management act. The \npresent draft of this proposed legislation is divided into three parts: (i) the first part deals with the \nrequired structural reforms needed to ensure a clear separation of responsibility and authority \nbetween the transport entities and agencies of government with respect to policy, regulation and \noperation;  (ii)  the  second  part  deals  with  specific  legal  issues  dealing  with  public\u2013private \npartnerships, including definitions; models; and the rights, benefits, and risks of both parties; \nand (iii) the third part deals with supporting mechanisms for investment in infrastructure, such as \nestablishing and administering toll road investment trusts or other investment type funds, and \npromotion incentives with respect to tax and other promotional benefits. This law is in the draft \nand review stage, with enactment contemplated for late 2009 or early 2010. \n \n7.  In June 2008, the Government announced that it had established a high-level public\u2013\nprivate partnership committee, chaired by the Prime Minister. The committee would be under \nthe supervision of the Budget Bureau, with the director of the Budget Bureau as the vice \nchairman. Other committee representatives would come from the National Economy and Social \nDevelopment Board (NESDB), the Fiscal Policy Office, the Public Debt Management Office and \nthe State Enterprise Office of Ministry of Finance, the Security and Exchange Commission, and \nthe  Office  of  the  Attorney  General.  In  addition  to  selecting  and  approving  projects,  the \ncommittee will consider fund mobilization for major projects in the public sector, all in line with \nthe Government's policies. It will also monitor project implementation and work progress, while \nthe responsible government agency will carry out the project in accordance with the legal \nframework. One of the primary sectors for public\u2013private partnerships is expected to be the \ntransport sector.4 In August 2008, the committee approved three pilot projects to be carried out \non a public\u2013private partnership basis, one of which was in the transport sector: the 199 km \nmotorway from Bang Pa-In to Nakorn Ratchasima. \n \nD.  Objective of the Technical Assistance \n \n8.  In  conjunction  with  the  emphasis  the  Government  is  placing  on  public\u2013private \npartnerships, and as a logical follow-up to the World Bank-assisted TA (para. 3), ADB will assist \nthe  Government  in  preparing  an  implementation  plan  for  the  Strategic  Intercity  Motorway \nNetwork utilizing a public\u2013private partnership. The final output of the implementation plan will be \n                                                 \n4 Other sectors that are being considered for involvement include public health, energy and environmental. \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \na  detailed  and  coordinated  scheme,  in  the  form  of  a  clear  and  detailed  financial  and \nimplementation plan utilizing the appropriate public\u2013private partnership arrangement, so that \ncertain motorways along five corridors5 radiating out from Bangkok to a distance of 250\u2013300 km \nwill have been constructed and have become operational by 2017.  \n \n9.  The overall objective of the plan will be to provide the Government with a detailed \nimplementation scheme for the planned motorway corridors, and to prepare the highest priority \nproject ready for award and implementation using an appropriate public\u2013private partnership \nmodel. The TA will concentrate on three motorway links: (i) Chonburi to Map Ta Put, including \nan access link to Laem Chabang Port; (ii) Bang Yai to Nakhon Pathom (Bang Pong) to Cha-am; \nand (iii) Nakhon Pathom to Kanchanaburi. In general, the TA study will build upon the work and \ndocumentation prepared under the World Bank's TA for the DOH on the Bang Pa-In to Nakhon \nRatchasima Motorway. \n \nE.  Scope of the Technical Assistance \n \n10.  The TA study will be carried out in three phases as follows: (i) the inspection and \nscreening  phase  (1  month),  (ii)  the  project  preparation  phase  (5  months),  and  (iii)  the \nprocurement assistance phase (12 months of intermittent input).   \n   \n11.  Inspection and Screening Phase. The objective of this task is to establish a priority \nranking of the three motorway links (para. 9) in terms of financial and economic feasibility, and \nin terms of social and environmental feasibility (i.e., implementation difficulty). In addition, the \nconsultant shall take into account planning and priority objectives of the Government. The \nconsultant is expected to utilize past route and feasibility studies, preliminary and detailed \ndesigns and reports, and historical and existing traffic counts, and to devise a weighted matrix \nmethodology  to  rank  the  three  links.  Components  of  the  weighted  matrix  shall  include  (i) \nestimated  civil  works  construction  costs;  (ii)  estimated  rights-of-way  costs;  (iii)  social  and \nresettlement  feasibility,  most  critically,  the  degree  of  difficulty  in  complying  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  on \ninvoluntary resettlement; (iv) environmental feasibility, particularly the identification of protected \nareas environmentally and culturally; (v) impacts on climate change; (vi) economic viability; and \n(vii) financial viability, particularly the ranking of the contemplated degree of interest the private \nsector would have in investing in each link. \n \n12.  To accomplish this task within a limited time frame, the consultant will rely heavily on \nexisting documentation and order of magnitude estimates. The consultant will also need to \nemploy a high level of judgmental experience, and to collaborate closely with the Government. \nThis  phase  is  expected  to  require  expertise  in  international  infrastructure  public\u2013private \npartnership investment  schemes  and  models,  financial  analyses,  transport  economics,  and \nmotorway and cost engineering.  \n \n13.  At the end of the inspection and screening phase, the consultant will organize and \nfacilitate  the  first  tripartite  meeting,  which  will  be  attended  by  representatives  from  the \nGovernment, ADB, and the consultant. The primary objective of this meeting will be to insure \nthat all parties have an opportunity to discuss the findings of the inspection and screening phase, \n                                                 \n5  The five corridors are (i) Bang Pa-In to Nakhon Ratchasima, (ii) Chonburi to Map Ta Put, (iii) Bang Pa-In to Nakhon \nSawan, (iv) Bang Yai to Kanchanaburi, and (v) Nakhon Pathom to Cha-am.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  51 \nand to reach an agreement on which motorway link has been nominated as the highest priority, \nto allow project preparation to begin without undue delay.  \n \n14.  Project Preparation Phase.  This is the most intense and demanding phase of the TA. \nThe output from this phase will focus on preparing a project for the selected motorway link. The \nwork will include the following: \n(i)  Engineering:  a  refined  alignment  study,  including  preliminary  vertical  and \nhorizontal  alignment;  preliminary  engineering  field  investigations  sufficient  to \nproduce  a  detailed  cost  estimate  of  civil  works,  tolls  systems,  and  related \nmotorway  facilities;  determination  of  preliminary  right-of-way  costs;  and \ndetermination of engineering and tendering costs. \n(ii)  Environmental:  preparation  of  environmental  assessment  assessments  and \ndocuments in accordance with ADB and Government requirements. \n(iii)  Resettlement:  preparation of a resettlement plan in accordance with ADB and \nGovernment requirements. \n(iv)  Economics: an economic evaluation of the motorway, including calculation of the \neconomic internal rate of return and related sensitivity analyses. \n(v)  Financial:  financial  evaluations  based  on  various  toll  regime  scenarios  and \nvarious financial model options6 together with a risk analyses for the various \nscenarios. \n(vi)  Tender Documents: preparation of draft public\u2013private partnership procurement \ndocuments. \n(vii)  Scheduling: preparation of a detailed implementation schedule, and a detailed \naction plan numerating, in a time line, each step\u2014as well as the prerequisites \nrequired  for  each  step\u2014that  will  be  required  to  process  the  projects  for \nimplementation.  This  action  plan  shall  be  central  to  the  work,  and  shall  be \ncontinuously monitored and updated by the consultant. \n \n15.  At the end of the project preparation phase, the second tripartite meeting, together with \nthe ISC, shall take place. The consultant shall organize and facilitate the meeting. The meeting \nwill validate and endorse the results of the project preparation phase, and agree on the direction, \nscope, and timing of activities to be undertaken in the procurement assistance phase.   \n \n16.  Procurement Assistance Phase. The objective of this phase is that at the end of this \n12 month period, all project preparation activities will be complete up to the award of the \nconcession. Task shall include the following:  \n(i)  verify and refine the business plan or business need; \n(ii)  undertake a detailed financial market assessment, to include exploring both \nlocal and international financial markets available for raising funds for this PPP \nproject; and assist the Government in locating and securing funding from both \ntraditional (government budgets) and international infrastructure funds; \n(iii)  finalize project details, studies, and feasibility; and \n(iv)  finalize tender documents, and assist in advertising and inviting expressions of \ninterest,  pre-qualifying  bidders,  refining  the  tender  documents  as  may  be \nrequired,  evaluating  tenders  received,  and  conducting  concession  contract \nnegotiations. \n                                                 \n6  Options might include (i) land purchased by the Government or the concessionaire, (ii) staged road construction, \nand/or  (iii)  various  options  for  shared  financing  construction  costs  between  the  Government  and  the \nconcessionaire. \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \n17.  During the procurement assistance phase, about three tripartite meetings shall take \nplace to review, discuss, and finalize the procurement documents. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangement \n \n18.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the DOH, under the MOT. The Implementing \nAgency will be the Bureau of Planning at the DOH, which will be responsible for the day-to-day \nsupervision and direction of the consultant. In addition, an inter-ministerial steering committee \nwill be created consisting of officers (deputy director level) of the DOH, the NESDB, the Office of \nTransport and Traffic Management Policy and Planning, the Public Debt Management Office, \nand the Budget Bureau. The committee will provide policy guidance to the consultant as well as \nthe required liaison between the consultant and other key agencies of Government. \n \nG.  Consultant Recruitment \n \n19.  The consultancy will be executed by an international consulting firm to be appointed by \nADB. The international firm will be required to form a joint venture or join in association with one \nor more national firms. Selection will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and its quality- and cost-based recruitment \nprocedures. Short-listed international consulting firms will submit simplified technical proposals. \nThe quality\u2013cost ratio is 90:10, reflecting the complexity of the consulting services. About 45 \nperson-months  of  consulting  inputs  will  be  required\u201422  person-months  from  international \nconsultants and 23 person-months from national consultants. The consulting services will be \nimplemented over 18 months, from April 2010 to September 2011. The consultants will have \nexpertise  in  (i)  project  feasibility  assessment,  (ii)  highway  design  and  construction,  (iii) \nformulation  of  public\u2013private  partnership  arrangements  appropriate  for  large  infrastructure \nprojects,  (iv)  financial  analysis,  (v)  legal  documentation  and  regulations,  (vi)  social  and \nenvironmental  safeguards,  and  (vii)  procurement.  The  DOH  will  provide  the  following:  (i) \ncounterpart staff for staff position of the consultant; (ii) office furniture and facilities for the \nconsultant and for counterpart staff; (iii) local transport and local communications for counterpart \nstaff; and (iv) copies of maps, reports, and other project-related information. Equipment financed \nunder the TA will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) and will be handed over to the DOH at the end of the services. All surveys will \nbe commissioned by the consultants and funded through the consulting services contract.  \n \nH.  Reporting Requirements \n \n20.  The following reports shall be submitted: (i) an inspection and screening phase report \nand notes on the first tripartite meeting at the end of 1 month, (ii) a project preparation report at \nthe end of 6 months, (iii) a draft final report and notes on the second tripartite meeting by the \nend of 6 months, (vi) a final report within 15 days after receipt of comments on the draft final \nreport, and (v) procurement documents at the end of 18 months.

Introduction \n1.  The economic analysis was carried out on the Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak section of Highway \n12, the Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo section of Highway 359, and for the Project as a whole, by \ncomparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  This  was  done  using  the  Highway \nDevelopment and Management Model 4 (HDM-4), which allows for modeling of the impact of \ncongestion and road safety in addition to simulating the development and impact of road surface \nconditions on vehicle operating costs (VOCs). In the without-project case, the project roads are \nassumed  to  remain  as  two-lane  single  carriageway  roads,  while  the  with-project  scenario \nassumes that they are widened to four-lane dual carriageway standard. Construction of the \nroads is expected to begin at different times and with different implementation periods. The \noverall economic analysis covers 24 years, from 2010 to 2033\u2014a construction period of 4 years \nfollowed by a benefit period of 20 years. All benefits and costs are in constant early 2008 prices. \nThe economic prices are expressed using the domestic price numeraire for non-traded goods \nand border prices for traded goods. The project design is the low-cost option as the Project will \nupgrade selected sections of the highway network, and the possibility that other transport \nmodes may offer lower costs is not plausible, simply by inspection. Cost reduction options that \nmay arise from alternative highway design standards, or details, will be addressed during the \ndetailed engineering design process. \n \nB.  Road Condition and Traffic Forecast \n2.  Road Condition. Information on the existing roads was collected from the road network \ninventory maintained by the Department of Highways (DOH) and verified by field observation. \nThe  existing  roads  are  7  meter  (m)  asphaltic  concrete  paved  roads  with  an  average \nInternational Roughness Index (IRI) in the range of IRI 3.0 meter/kilometer (m/km) to IRI 5.0 \nm/km. In the with-project case, road roughness is assumed to be IRI 2.0 m/km immediately after \nconstruction.  Future  roughness  levels  are  forecast  using  the  HDM-4  model  assuming \napplication of the standard road maintenance regime in Thailand. \n \n3.  Traffic  Volume.  The  DOH  annually  performs  classified  traffic  counts  on  all  project \nroads. The traffic counts identify 13 vehicle types, ranging from non-motorized vehicles to truck-\ntrailers. Non-motorized vehicles (such as bicycles) and agricultural vehicles were excluded \nsince  these  are  unaffected  by  widening  the  project  roads.  For  the  Phitsanulok\u2013Lom  Sak \nsubproject, a detailed feasibility study1 was carried out in 2006. These additional traffic counts \nwere also taken into account in preparing base-year traffic data since they document significant \nweekend  and  tourist  traffic  that  is  not  reflected  in  the  DOH  database.  A  summary  of  the \nestimated traffic volumes in 2007 is shown in Table A12.1. \n \n4.  Traffic Forecast. The DOH maintains a traffic counting database for all national roads. \nUnfortunately, the database does not provide accurate information on overall traffic growth \nbecause local road networks are expanding rapidly. This diverts an increasing share of total \ntraffic out of view of the DOH database, which does not record traffic on local roads. As a result, \ncomparisons over time are distorted. Therefore, traffic growth forecasting has been based on \napplying  income  elasticities  to  forecast  economic  growth  as  measured  by  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) in constant prices. Between 2003 and 2006, Thailand\u2019s GDP grew at an average \nrate of about 5% per year. For 2007, it is expected that GDP has grown by about 4.3% because \n                                                 \n1  Thai DCI Company Limited et al. 2006.

Future \nGDP growth is forecast to average about 5% per year.2 Based on this, a set of general traffic \ngrowth rates have been estimated by applying income elasticities of 1.1 for freight transport and \n1.2 for passenger transport. These are lower than usual and take into account the almost \ndoubling of fuel prices between 2006 and early 2008, as well as the expectation that high fuel \nprices will remain in future.3 The traffic forecast ignores generated traffic since the Project has \nlimited impact on VOCs; it also generally ignores diverted traffic since other parts of the network \nare being upgraded concurrently.  \n  \nTable A12.1: Estimated Average Annual Daily Traffic in 2007 \n    Motor- Light       \nHighway  Subproject/Section  cycles  Vehicles  Buses  Trucks  Total \n12  Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak           \n  1.

Costs \n5.  The Project\u2019s economic costs were derived from the financial construction costs and \ninclude the cost of construction, future road maintenance, land acquisition, and resettlement \ncompensation. The routine and periodic maintenance unit costs were derived from rates for \nindividual work items. The construction cost estimates cover improving the roads from the \nexisting carriageway width of 7 meters to dual carriageways with a total width of 14 meters. \nEconomic costs exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, and interest during construction, but \ndo include physical contingencies, construction supervision costs, and detailed design costs. \nThe  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  A12.2.  The  higher  costs  per  km  for  the \nPhitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak subproject mainly reflect that some sections are in severe mountainous \nterrain and large volumes of civil works earthworks will be required.  \n \nTable A12.2: Cost Estimates  \n(B million) \n  Civil Worksa  Resettle-   Total Economic \nHighway Section  Financial  Economic  ment  Land  Project  Per Km\nPhitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak      4,082.8     3,815.7         17.0  1.0   3,833.7  36.5 \nPhanon Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo     1,812.2     1,693.6           7.0  4.9   1,705.6  23.4 \nOverall Project     5,894.9     5,509.3         24.0  6.0   5,539.2 \nkm = kilometer.   \na Includes physical contingencies, supervision costs and environmental mitigation  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n2  The average annual economic growth targets in the 10th, 11th, and 12th Plans of the National Economic and \nSocial Development Board, which together cover 2007\u20132021, are in the range of 5.0% to 5.6%. \n3  The Government\u2019s National Transport Plan uses traffic growth rates of about 5% per year for both passenger and \nfreight transport. The previous feasibility studies for the project roads also used long-term average traffic growth \nrates ranging between 5.0% and 5.6% per year. The World Bank\u2019s Thailand Highways Management Project uses \ntraffic growth rates of 3%\u20136% in the short term and 3% in the long term. \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \nD.  Benefits \n6.  The benefits to road users is estimated as the differences between VOC, time cost for \npassengers, and accident costs in the with-project and the without-project cases using the \nHDM-4 model. The main benefit resulting from the improved road standard is in the form of \ntravel time savings, which is a direct result of the higher speeds that are achieved on four-lane \nroads. VOC savings are smaller because the road surface condition of the present roads is \nalready good to fair, and because higher speeds do not always produce VOC benefits because \nof progressively increasing fuel cost. Accident savings can only be estimated, but the general \npattern of a 25%\u201340% reduction in accidents when two-lane roads are upgraded to four-lane \ndual carriageway standard is confirmed by data from Thailand. The reduction is particularly \nnoticeable in the number of head-on collisions, which have the worst casualty rate and therefore \nthe highest cost. Unit prices for valuing VOC, time, and accident costs were derived from a \nreport on road user costs4 prepared for the DOH in early 2008 using 2006 prices. With minor \nadjustment, the report remains valid today. The exception is fuel prices, which have nearly \ndoubled and therefore were estimated independently. \n \n7.  The  estimated  economic  fuel  prices  are  based  on  import  prices,  which  are  closely \nrelated to crude oil prices. There are no official forecasts of future crude prices, and the few \navailable forecasts for the medium term (up to 2010) vary from a reduction to $60 per barrel or \nless to increases to $200 per barrel or more. For both petrol and diesel fuel, a price of B25 per \nliter was used based on an assumed long-term average crude oil price of $120 per barrel in \nconstant price terms. However, it should be noted that a road project benefit evaluation is based \non the difference in VOC between the with- and without-project cases. Because the difference in \nfuel consumption for the type of projects being considered is small, the level of fuel prices has \nlittle impact on road user benefits. However, fuel cost does affect the propensity to travel and \nthereby the traffic forecast. This impact is tested by varying forecast future traffic growth rates in \nthe sensitivity analysis. Estimated VOC for the with- and without-project cases in the opening \nyear, distributed by vehicle type, are in Table A12.3.  \n \nTable A12.3: Estimated Typical Vehicle Operating Costs  \n(B/km) \n  Without  With \nVehicle Type  Project  Project \nMotorcycle   1.37  1.36 \nCar < 7 passengers  6.34  6.35 \nCar > 7 passengers  7.65  7.52 \nLight Bus  6.60  6.56 \nMedium Bus  9.90  9.34 \nHeavy Bus  20.59  18.43 \nLight Truck  5.94  5.96 \nMedium Truck  9.90  11.67 \nHeavy Truck  20.87  19.50 \nArticulated Truck  27.73  26.81 \n  km = kilometer. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n \n                                                 \n4  Team Consulting Engineering and Management Co.

A small increase was made to unit time values to reflect changes in \nincome per head since 2006, but significantly lower proportions were assumed to be traveling \nduring working time compared with the 2008 study, especially in the case of bus passengers. \nThe values of passenger time per hour for different vehicle types and their occupancy rates are \nin Table A12.4.   \n  \nTable A12.4: Value of Passenger Time \n    Non-work  Percentage  Passengers \n  Work Time Time  Work Time  per Vehicle \nVehicle Type  (B/hour)  (B/hour)  (%)  (persons) \nMotorcycle   45.00  11.25  25  1.2 \nCar < 7 passengers  70.00  17.50  35  2.3 \nCar > 7 passengers  70.00  17.50  30  8.0 \nLight Bus  45.00  11.25  5  10.0 \nMedium Bus  45.00  11.25  5  25.0 \nHeavy Bus  45.00  11.25  5  40.0 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimate. \n \n9.  Because the surface condition of most roads is good, and some components of VOC \nincrease with the higher speeds in the with-project case, the VOC benefits are generally small, \nand can be negative. They are less important than time savings, which are directly related to \nvehicle speeds and are always higher in the with-project case. Time savings increase rapidly, \nsignificantly faster than traffic growth rates. This is because the growth in traffic would lead to \nmore congestion and progressively lower speeds without the Project. As a result, the time \nbenefits per vehicle-km will increase each year, and when these rising benefits per vehicle-km \nare multiplied by the increasing traffic level, the total annual time benefits can rise to very high \nlevels. This effect translates into particularly high time savings on the Phanon Sarakham\u2013Sa \nKaeo section, because of the higher traffic levels on that road. For the Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak \nsection, the combined effect of road gradient, curvature, and traffic flow on speeds increases \ntime benefits. This increased benefit effect compensates for the higher construction cost on that \nroad. \n \n10.  The rates of accidents, classified by the severity of the accident, together with their \naverage cost are in Table A12.5. These were derived from the 2008 road user cost study. \n \nTable A12.5: Accident Rates and Average Cost per Accident \n  Accident Rate    \n  (number per 100 million vehicle-km)  Cost per Accident \nItem  Two-Lane Road  Four-Lane Road  (B'000) \nFatal  1.65  1.03  4,000 \nInjury  32.51  20.29  300 \nDamage Only  130.02  81.16  30 \n  km = kilometer. \n  Source: Department of Highways, Report on Feasibility Study of Economic Engineering and \nEnvironmental Aspects for Road Development: Road User Costs. \n \n11.  The project roads are expected to have an economic life of 20 years, after which they \nwill  require  rehabilitation  and  possibly  further  widening  to  meet  future  traffic  growth.  It  is \nassumed that about 30% of the initial capital invested in the Project\u2014notably for embankments, \nbase, and sub-base materials\u2014and a share of the structures will be retained since these \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \ncomponents have a much longer economic life than 20 years.

Results of the Economic Analysis \n \n3.  All subprojects were shown to be viable with the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nfor the Project as a whole estimated as 15.8%.

Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n4.  The sensitivity of the Project road was analyzed for (i) an increase in construction costs \nof 20%, reflecting the possible impact of higher fuel and raw materials cost; (ii) a decrease in \nbenefits of 20%, reflecting uncertainties in benefit estimation and the possible impact of high oil \nand raw materials prices on economic growth; and (iii) a combination of an increase in capital \ncosts of 20% and a reduction of benefits of 20%. The results of the sensitivity analysis (Table \nA12.7)  show  that  the  economic  viability  is  generally  robust.  The  switching  values  were \ncalculated for 12.0% of the EIRR, which is ADB's criterion for project's economic viability. As the \nswitching values in the Table show, capital costs increase by 52.6% or benefits decrease by \n36.1% renders the project unviable.  \n \nTable A12.7: Results of Sensitivity Tests \nScenario  EIRR (%)  Switching Value (%) \nBase Case  15.8  \u2014 \nCapital Costs increased by 20%  14.3  52.6 \nBenefits reduced by 20%  13.7  36.1 \nCapital costs increase 20% and benefits decrease 20%  12.2  \u2014 \n  \u2014 = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.  The @Risk computer software program was used for risk analysis. The uncertain values \nhave been taken as the civil works cost, VOC benefits, time benefits, and accident benefits.  For \neach, the maximum possible value for that parameter is 20% higher than the estimated most \nlikely value, and the minimum possible value is 80% of the most likely value used in the \nevaluation. The analysis shows a 15.3% risk that the Project would not reach the minimum \nEIRR of 12% for economic viability. \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  59 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \nA.  Project Background \n1.  The Government of Thailand plans to widen highways 12 and 359 to four lanes as part \nof the Greater Mekong Subregion Highway Expansion Project. The aim of the Project is to \nimprove the transport infrastructure in the East\u2013West and Southern corridors of the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS). The right-of-ways (ROW) have been acquired, and were established \nand demarcated starting in 1950s (Highway 12) and in 2000 (Highway 359). The ROW of \nhighways 12 and 359 is 60 meters (m) wide (i.e., 30 m each way from the road centerline). The \nentire ROW of the highways will be cleared of all obstructions. \n2.  In August 2008, the first resettlement plan was prepared based on the results of an \ninventory of affected fixed assets using a reduced corridor of impact (COI). On Highway 359, for \nexample, an 11 m wide corridor from the edge of the ROW on the two new lanes construction \nside was not included in the survey as this empty space was to be provided for the use of \nvendors to move back their affected stalls and shelters.1 On Highway 12, the COI in areas with \nstalls and/or shelters was reduced to 14 m from the road centerline.  The intention to reduce the \nCOI  was  laudable.  However,  further  consideration  by  the  Department  of  Highways  (DOH) \nconvinced project authorities that it was not sustainable because it would not address the issue \nof encroachment in the ROW, and because the presence of obstructions and vendors in the \nROW puts pedestrians and motorists at risk.  \n3.  The updated resettlement plan is based on a detailed measurement survey (DMS) of \nfixed assets inside the ROW of highways 12 and 359. The DMS included assets and affected \npeople and households excluded in the inventory of affected fixed assets in 2008. \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n4.  The DMS for Highway 359 was carried out 27\u201331 October and 5\u20139 November 2008, \nwhile that for Highway 12 was done on 16\u201331 March 2009. At least 353 households (about \n1,765 persons) will be adversely affected by the Project. The following is a breakdown of project \nimpacts: \n(i)  Highway 12. The total number of the affected households is 261. While 243 \nstalls and shelters and five houses will relocate outside the ROW, 13 other \nhouses will be partially affected. In addition, 41 plots (with an aggregate area of \nabout 64,883 square meters) located along the highway and inside the ROW will \nbe cleared in the highway widening. During the DMS, 43 persons farming inside \nthe ROW were located and interviewed.  \n(ii)  Highway 359. The total number of the affected households is 92. One house, 91 \nstalls and shelters, 1 government-owned waiting shed, and 1 farm shack will \nrelocate outside the ROW. In addition, 133 plots (with an aggregate area of about \n402,770 square meters) located along the highway and inside the ROW have \nbeen planted with food and cash crops, such as rice, cassava, and eucalyptus. \nThese plots will be cleared to make way for the construction of two new lanes. \nDuring  the  DMS,  41  persons  farming  inside  the  ROW  were  located  and \ninterviewed.  \n                                                 \n1 Also referred to as small shops or kiosks. Most of the stalls and shelters have no walls.  \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \nC.  Legal and Policy Framework \n5.  The  project  resettlement  policy  has  been  developed  taking  into  account  the  2007 \nConstitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, the Expropriation of Immovable Property Act of B.E. \n2530 (1987), the Highway Act of B.E. 2535 (1992), and the Highway Act of B.E. 2549 (2006).  It \nalso takes into account the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995) and relevant sections of the Operations Manual (2006), and other ADB policies that have \nbearing on resettlement planning and implementation, such as indigenous peoples, gender, \npublic communications, and accountability mechanism. The project resettlement policy has \nbeen formulated in a way that recognizes that, while the ROW for most of the project roads has \nbeen acquired, it is important to ensure that the affected people will be able to continue, with \nminimal disruption, with their livelihood and that their socioeconomic conditions are maintained, \nif not improved, during road construction. The entitlement matrix is in Table A13.1.     \nTable A13.1: Entitlement Matrix \nTypes of Impacts  Rehabilitation Measures \nOn Income (permanent or  The DOH will assist by coordinating with the resettlement coordinating committee \ntemporary)  and  Tambon  Administration  Office  in  finding  replacement  land  for  stalls  and \nshelters in a way that will allow for the gradual transfer of business operations to \nthe new site, thereby avoiding any business disruption. Poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds will be given priority in choosing stalls in the new sites. For farmers, \nthe DOH will assist in finding replacement land with similar productive attributes for \nlease. \nOn Houses, House with Stalls  The DOH and/or civil works contractor will provide in-kind assistance during the \nand/or Shelters, and Stalls and  dismantling and transfer of structures and belongings or goods outside the ROW, \nShelters  and will provide similar materials for damaged building materials and materials that \ncannot be reused, as necessary. For house owners who will have to relocate, \ntemporary shelter will be provided, as necessary.  \nOn Crops and Trees  Affected households will be allowed to harvest annual crops and timber products \nbefore the start of construction. For the trees that will be transplanted, the DOH \nwill provide assistance in balling the trees and transport them for replanting \noutside of the ROW.   \nWhere trees will not be transplanted, the DOH will coordinate with the concerned \ndepartment to provide the owner of the trees with saplings that are equivalent to \nthe productive value or age of the trees in that area; and/or coordinate with civil \nworks contractor to purchase the trees and utilize them for the civil works, such as \nlandscaping and temporary works, and/or to provide the tree owners in-kind \nassistance, such as leveling their unused land. \nDOH = Department of Highways, ROW = right-of-way.  \nSource: Department of Highways estimates. \nD.  Ethnicity, Vulnerability and Gender Issues \n6.  No ethnic minority households are located along Highway 359. The 2008 resettlement \nplan identified 28 households headed by women, 29 poor households, and 16 households that \nwere headed by persons within the retirement age bracket of the Government. During the DMS, \nthe  identities  of  42  affected  households  whose  assets  were  also  tagged  during  the  2008 \ninventory of losses survey have been determined. Of these, 41 have cultivated plots inside the \nROW, while 1 was a stall or shelter owner. Women head 13 of these newly identified affected \nhouseholds. All of them are ethnic Thai. None of the household heads is disabled, 33 claim to \nhave  a  household  monthly  income  below  the  poverty  line,  and  14  of  the  newly  identified \nhousehold heads are within the retirement age group. \n ", "  Appendix 13  61 \n7.  The 2008 resettlement plan identified 99 households headed by women along Highway \n12, 37 households below the poverty line, and 38 households headed by persons within the \nretirement age bracket. During the DMS, 63 affected households\u2014some of which are affected \nbecause of the recovery of the entire ROW\u2014were identified. Of these, 43 have cultivated plots \ninside the ROW, while 19 are stall or shelter owners, and 1 is affected by the loss of a garage. \nWomen head 31 of these newly identified affected households. All of them are ethnic Thai. \nNone of the household heads is disabled, while 37 claim to have a household monthly income \nbelow the poverty line.   \n8.  Additional measures are incorporated in the resettlement plan to help ensure that poor \nand other vulnerable affected households are not further disadvantaged; and that, along with \nthe other affected households, they will benefit from the Project. Specifically, greater care and \nattention will be provided to these affected households during the transfer of their stalls and \nshelters to spare them from any additional hardship during displacement. During the updating of \nthe resettlement plan, it was determined that farmers will take turns cultivating paddy land. If \nduring  clearing  of  the  ROW,  farmers  are  found  to  be  severely  affected  (i.e.,  the  loss  is \nequivalent to 10% ore more of their total income capacity), the DOH will assist by coordinating \nwith  the resettlement coordinating committee (RCC) and Tambon Administration Office to find \nreplacement land with similar productive attributes for lease. \nE.  Consultation, Participation, and Grievance Redress \n9.  Consultations, public meetings, and village discussions with the affected households and \nthe local governments were done before and after the conduct of the IOL in 2008 and during \nand after the DMS in 2009 as part of the resettlement planning process. These activities will \ncontinue  during  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  consistent  with  the  Project\u2019s \nparticipatory approach. A grievance redress mechanism has been designed to ensure that the \nconcerns and complaints of the affected households are readily addressed at the village level in \na timely and satisfactory manner. The affected households have been made aware of their \nrights through verbal and written means during resettlement planning and updating, and this will \ncontinue during resettlement implementation.  \nF.  Livelihood Restoration \n10.  The DOH, through its sub-district offices, will ensure that the livelihood activities of the \nowners  of  affected  houses,  house  with  stalls  and/or  shelters,  and  independent  stalls  and \nshelters are not disrupted. The owners of stalls and shelters will be assisted in gradually \ndismantling, reorganizing, or setting up their operations in a way that will allow them to gradually \nphase out their operation in their old place and begin their operation in their new place. Under \nthis arrangement, the owners of stalls and shelters, whose business caters to road users, will \nnot experience any stoppage in their operation. Therefore, the livelihood of these owners will not \nbe severely affected by the highway widening. For households with farms inside the COI, the \nProject will ensure that they will be able to harvest their crops before construction. The DMS \ndetermined that none of these farming households will lose 10% or more of their source of \nlivelihood or income.   \n11.  The DOH and/or civil works contractor will provide in-kind assistance in dismantling and \ntransferring all affected structures, including the preparation of replacement market sites where \ndisplaced stalls and shelters could transfer. All standing annual crops, including perennial and \ntimber trees, will be allowed to be harvested or cut before the start of civil works in a section of \nthe  project  road.  Young  perennial  trees  will  be  balled  and  transferred  by  the  civil  works \ncontractor to the affected person\u2019s own land. Where trees will not be transplanted, the DOH will \ncoordinate with the concerned department to provide the owner of the trees with saplings that \n ", "62  Appendix 13 \nare equivalent to the productive value or age of the trees in that area; and/or coordinate with \ncivil  works  contractor  to  purchase  the  trees  and  utilize  them  for  the  civil  works,  such  as \nlandscaping and temporary works, and/or to provide the tree owners in-kind assistance, such as \nleveling their unused land. \nG.  Implementation Arrangements, Monitoring, and Resettlement Plan Budget \n12.  The DOH, through its project management office (PMO), has overall responsibility for \nplanning  and  implementing  all  aspects  of  resettlement.  The  DOH  sub-district  offices,  with \nassistance from technical assistance consultants, spearheaded the updating of the resettlement \nplan. The sub-district offices will continue this lead role during resettlement plan implementation. \nAn RCC, composed of representatives from the DOH sub-district offices, the local government \n(district or municipality), and the affected households (most of whom are stall and/or shelter \nowners)  was  set  up  to  facilitate  systematic  relocation  of  stalls  and  shelters  and  houses, \nincluding the harvesting of annual crops and perennial trees. The RCC will serve as the main \nvehicle through which the affected households can actively participate in looking for a place \noutside of the ROW for them to continue operating their roadside livelihoods. The RCC will also \nhelp ensure that affected households are updated on the project, and that they are informed \nabout the start of civil works in a specific section at least 3 months in advance. The project \nsupervision consultants and the civil works contractors will also be represented in the RCC after \nthey have been selected and mobilized. The project supervision consultants will continue to \nassist the PMO and the DOH sub-district offices during the implementation of the resettlement \nplan to ensure that social safeguard measures laid out in the resettlement plan are complied \nwith. These consultants will provide needed training and capacity building inputs on a full-time \nbasis. For this purpose, the consultants will have its own social development and  resettlement \nteam,  composed  of  one  international  social  development  and  resettlement  specialist,  one \ndomestic resettlement specialist, and one domestic gender specialist working an intermittently. \n13.  The  DOH,  through  its  PMO,  will  be  overall  responsible  for  internal  monitoring  of \nresettlement activities. Related reports will be submitted to ADB quarterly and uploaded onto the \nDOH's website and the ADB website. \n14.  The  cost  for  in-kind  assistance  and  restoration  measures  for  the  two  highways  is \nestimated at B34,157,210. This amount includes the costs of (i) dismantling and transferring \naffected stalls and shelters and houses, (ii) transporting totally affected stalls and shelters and \nhouses to their new sites, (iii), preparing new sites for the stalls and shelters, (iv) operational \nand administrative expenses, and (v) contingencies. All assistance will be in-kind, and no cash \nassistance  will  be  provided  to  the  affected  households.  The  DOH  will  ensure  the  timely \navailability  of  funds  for  resettlement,  including  unforeseen  costs  in  excess  of  resettlement \nbudget estimates to satisfy the project resettlement objectives. \nH.  Implementation Schedule and Disclosure Activities \n15.  The resettlement schedule is provided in Table A13.2. The schedule of civil works in a \nparticular segment of each road will be planned out with the direct participation of the RCC to \nensure that construction works are synchronized with the relocation of affected structures and \nthe harvesting of crops and trees. The DOH will not allow construction activities in a segment to \nstart  until  the  affected  households  have  been  relocated  in  accordance  with  the  project \nresettlement policy and the segment of the road is free of all encumbrances.  \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  63 \nTable A13.2: Resettlement Schedule \nActivity  Schedule \nResettlement plan preparation  May\u2013Aug 2008 \nADB approval of draft resettlement plan   Sep 2008 \nResettlement plan updating   Mar\u2013Jun 2009 \nDistribution of public information leaflets to affected persons and submission to ADB  Jul 2009 \nADB approval of updated resettlement plan   Jul 2009 \nImplementation of the approved updated resettlement plan   Jul 2009\u2013Mar 2010 \n   \u2013 Public meetings on final implementation schedule  Jul\u2013Dec 2009 \n   \u2013 Identification of relocation sites for houses and stalls and shelters   Jul\u2013Dec 2009 \n   \u2013 Identification of owners of crops and trees   Jul\u2013Dec 2009 \n   \u2013 Identification of poor, vulnerable, and severely affected households  Jul\u2013Dec 2009 \n   \u2013 Relocation of houses and stalls and shelters, cutting and balling of trees  Aug 2009\u2013Mar 2010  \n   \u2013 Provision of assistance to poor, vulnerable, and severely affected households  Aug 2009\u2013Mar 2010 \nInternal monitoring (submission of quarterly progress reports)  Jul 2009\u20132012 \nGrievance redress  Jul 2009\u20132012 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Department of Highways estimates. \n16.
