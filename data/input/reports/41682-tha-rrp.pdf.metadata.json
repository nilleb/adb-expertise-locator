Highway 12 from \nPhitsanulok  to  Lom  Sak  (105  km)  is  on  the  GMS  East\u2013West \nEconomic Corridor; and Highway 359 from Phanom Sarakham to \nSa Kaeo (73 km) is along the GMS Southern Economic Corridor.  \n \nThe  Project  will  also  assist  the  Department  of  Highways  (DOH) \nin  preparing  an \nunder \nimplementation plan for the Strategic Intercity Motorway Network. \nThis  will  include  a  detailed  and  coordinated  implementation  and \nfinancing  plan  for  strategic  intercity  motorways  along  three \ncorridors radiating out from Bangkok to a distance of 200\u2013250 km, \nas well as a detailed analysis of financing alternatives.  \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Transport \n\n(MOT) \n\n \nBorrower \n  \nClassification \n\n  \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n  \nProject Description \n\n  \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nAfter  3  decades  of  rapid  economic  development,  Thailand\u2019s \ngrowth  has  slowed.  Strengthening  competitiveness  has  become \nthe  centerpiece  of  Thailand\u2019s  economic  policy  to  reinvigorate \ngrowth.  Deficient  infrastructure  is  consistently  cited  as  a  major \nconstraint  on  productivity  growth.  To  address  high  logistics  costs \nin  the  transport  sector,  the  DOH  is  prioritizing  five  areas:  (i) \nintercity motorways, (ii) Bangkok express ring roads, (iii) industrial \nring  roads,  (iv)  four-lane  highway  widening,  and  (v)  roadway \nnetwork  connections  to  neighboring  countries.  ADB\u2019s  strategy \nfocuses  on  assisting  the  MOT  in  these  five  areas  of  road \ndevelopment.  In  the  longer  term,  ADB  can  offer  the  most \nadditionality  by  assisting  the  MOT  in  the  development  of  the \nmotorway  network  using  public\u2013private  partnerships.  However, \nplanning  for  the  motorway  network  is  incomplete,  whereas \npreparation  for  making  critical  sections  of  the  highway  network \nfour lanes\u2014which is essential in the short to medium term\u2014is well \nadvanced. \n \nThe  economic  corridor  approach,  which  was  adopted  by  GMS \nleaders  and  reaffirmed  by  the  15th  GMS  Ministerial  Conference \n(June 2009, Cha-am, Thailand), aims to (i) generate more cross-\nborder trade; (ii) extend the benefits of improved transport links to \nremote  and  landlocked  locations  in  the  GMS,  which  have  been \ndisadvantaged  by  their  lack  of  integration  with  more  prosperous \nand  better-located  neighboring  areas;  (iii)  provide  a  spatial  focus \nto  GMS  activities,  with  the  backbone,  growth  centers,  and  nodal \npoints  serving  as  catalysts  for  the  development  of  surrounding \nareas; (iv) open up many opportunities for investments from within \nand outside the GMS; and (v) enhance the impact of subregional \nactivities  through  the  clustering  of  projects.  The  adoption  of  this \napproach  assumes  that  the  underlying  national  networks  are \nadequate  and  efficient,  which  has  not  been  the  case  in  most \ncountries.  Cross-border  traffic  constitutes  a  small  portion  of  total \nroad  traffic  in  Thailand,  but  ongoing  improvements  in  transport \ninfrastructure  could  soon  exhaust  the  capacity  of  already  busy \nroads.  Therefore,  managing  road  network  capacity  in  the  GMS \nthe  purpose  of \ncorridors \ntransforming these corridors into full-fledged economic corridors. \n\nto  avoid  defeating \n\nrequired \n\nis \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n  \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n  \nPeriod of Utilization \n  \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n  \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\nThe  project  impact  will  be  an  increase  in  competitiveness  of  the \nlocal  economy  in  the  provinces  along  the  East\u2013West  Economic \nCorridor  (EWEC)  and  Southern  Economic  Corridor  (SEC).  By \n2018,  gross  domestic  product  in  the  provinces,  in  which  the \nproject  highways  are  expanded,  is  expected  to  be  increased  by \n20%,  and  value  of  cross-border  trade  carried  by  road  transport \nwith other GMS countries along the EWEC and SEC is expected \nto be increased by 20%, compared to the baseline data of 2010. \nThe project outcome will be a more efficient and safer EWEC and \nSEC  in  Thailand.  Compared  to  the  baseline  data,  a  reduction  in \npassenger  and  freight  operating  costs  of  10%,  a  reduction  in \ntravel  times  of  15%,  an  increase  in  traffic  volume  of  5%,  and  a \nreduction in traffic accidents fatalities of 40% are expected for the \nproject highway sections by 2015.  \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $179.4  million,  including  taxes \nand duties of $15.4 million.  \n \nA loan of $77,100,000 from ADB's ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n\nlending \n\nThe  loan  from  ADB  will  be  provided  to  the  Kingdom  of  Thailand. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  directly  disbursed  to  civil  works \ncontractors and consultants to be engaged by the DOH under the \nProject. \n\n30 June 2015 \n\n31 December 2014 \n\nresponsibility \n\nDOH \n \nThe  DOH  will  have  overall \nfor  project \nimplementation.  The  DOH  will  engage  and  direct  the  work  of \nconsultants, and will procure and direct all contractors. Within the \nDOH,  the  deputy  director  general\u2013engineering,  who  will  be  the \nproject  director,  will  be  responsible  for  project  implementation. \nThe director, Highway Construction Bureau, will assist the project \ndirector  as  the  deputy  project  director.  The  assistant  project \ndirector, who will be the director, Bureau of International Highways \nCooperation, will have day-to-day responsibility. \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n  \n\nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). All civil works to be funded from the \nADB loan will be procured using international competitive bidding \nprocedures with prequalification. Eight civil works packages will be \nprocured,  of  which  five  will  be  for  Highway  12  (Phitsanulok\u2013Lom \nSak) and three for Highway 359 (Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo). \n \nThe  DOH  will  recruit  an  international  consulting  firm  for  the \nconstruction supervision consulting services using the quality- and \ncost-based  selection  procedures,  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). The quality and cost ratio is 80:20. The full technical \nproposal  will  be  used.  About  65  person-months  of  input  from \ninternational  experts  will  be  required  with  about  145  person-\nmonths  from  national  experts  to  assist  the  international  experts. \nExpertise  will  be  required  in  civil  works  contract  management, \nhighway  construction,  road  safety,  resettlement  and  social \nimpacts,  HIV/AIDS  awareness,  environmental  impacts  mitigation, \nand project performance monitoring. \n \nThe major beneficiaries of the Project will be the residents of the \nproject area and users of transport services within Thailand and in \nthe  GMS.  By  reducing  travel  times  and  vehicle  operating  costs \nalong the improved sections, the Project will encourage economic \nactivities  in  the  affected  provinces.  The  Project's  economic \nbenefits  are  derived  primarily  from  savings  on  vehicle  operating \ncosts  and  travel  time.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (EIRR)  for  the  project  road  is  15.8%,  indicating  that  the \nProject  is  economically  viable.  The  results  of  sensitivity  testing \nand risk analyses indicate that the Project is robust with a low risk \nof the EIRR falling below the minimum acceptable EIRR of 12%. \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\n  \nTechnical Assistance \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nv \n\nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  risks.  A  full \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared,  and  the  engineering \ndesigns  incorporate  measures  to  reduce  resettlement  impacts. \nEnvironmental  documentation  has  been  prepared  in  compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Previous  road  sector \nprojects in Thailand identified the following issues: (i) procurement \nwas  delayed  because  the  DOH  was  not  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \nstandard  bidding  documents;  (ii)  some  covenants,  especially  on \nsubmission of audited accounts, were not complied with, and (iii) \nan  excessive  number  of  components \ntoo  many \nexecuting  agencies  complicated  project  administration.

The overall objective of the TA will be \nto provide the Government with a detailed implementation plan for \nthe  three  motorway  corridors,  and  prepare  the  highest  priority \nproject ready for award and implementation using an appropriate \npublic\u2013private  partnership  model.  The  cost  estimate  for  these \nservices is $1.45 million; it is proposed that ADB will finance $1.0 \nmillion.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan \nSpecial  Fund.  The  Government  of  Thailand  will  finance  the \nremaining  $0.45  million  through  in-kind  contributions  of  the \nExecuting Agency.

Rapid  economic  growth  in  the  past  20  years  has  significantly \nreduced  poverty,  particularly  in  northeastern  Thailand.  By  2007  the  official  national  poverty \nheadcount ratio was 8.1%. Thailand\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an average \nannual  rate  of  6.2%  from  2002  to  2004,  but  slowed  down  to  4.8%  in  2007  and  2.6%  in  2008. \nGDP  is  envisaged  to  contract  by  2.0%  from  2008  to  2009  because  of  the  global  economic \nrecession. As many people have incomes that place them just above the poverty line, the recent \neconomic  recession  could  push  them  back  into  poverty.  Strengthening  competitiveness  has \nbecome the centerpiece of Thailand\u2019s economic policy agenda to reinvigorate economic growth. \nThe 10th National Economic and Social Development Plan1 emphasizes that Thailand\u2019s path to \na  more  competitive,  productive,  and  open  economy  will  require  more  investment  in  economic \ncapital,  which  the  plan  defines  as  having  physical,  financial,  and  human  dimensions.  This \napproach  is  consistent  with  priority  initiatives  to  invest  in  physical  and  social  infrastructure,  to \ndevelop  the  domestic  capital  market,  and  to  become  a  knowledge-based  economy.  Since  the \neconomy  depends  heavily  on  exports,  which  account  for  more  than  two-thirds  of  GDP,  and  in \nline  with  the  10th  plan,  economic  growth  should  be  stimulated  by  increasing  trade  within  the \nGMS through investment in transport infrastructure of the GMS corridors in Thailand.  \n \nThe economy\u2019s performance over the medium term will depend on political stability, and \n3. \ninfrastructure \non  raising  productivity  and  competitiveness  by  pushing \ninvestments  and  advancing  structural  reforms.  Transport  infrastructure  has  been  important  in \nsupporting Thailand\u2019s growth and meeting the  demand for transport services. The demand for \ninfrastructure services and infrastructure investment has declined, and especially investment for \nroads  and  highways  construction  sharply  decreased  from  2006  to  2008.  However,  in  the  long \nrun,  traffic  demand  will  grow  rapidly  and  road  capacity  shortages  will  emerge.  Transport \nbottlenecks will constrain economic growth, and the impact of insufficient investment in transport \ninfrastructure is becoming increasingly evident. Deficient infrastructure is consistently cited as a \nmajor constraint on private investment and productivity growth.2 For example, logistics costs in \nThailand are estimated to be as high as 20% of GDP, compared with 11% in Japan, 10% in the \nUnited  States,  and  7%  in  the  European  Union.  Therefore,  the  Government  has  programmed \nlarge-scale  investments  in  the  road  subsector,  such  as  constructing  intercity  motorways, \nwidening  highways  to  four  lanes,  and  strengthening  roads  connections  with  the  neighboring \ncountries  (para.11).  The  intercity  motorways  project  from  2007  to  2017  and  the  four-lane \n\nthrough  priority \n\n                                                 \n1   National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Board.  2006.  The  10th  National  Economic  and  Social  Development \n\nPlan (2007\u20132011). Bangkok.  \n\n2  Infrastructure, skills shortages, and heavy regulatory burdens have been cited as the three principal constraints to \nprivate investment and productivity growth in Thailand. See National Economic and Social Development Board and \nWorld Bank. 2006. Thailand Investment Climate, Firm Competitiveness and Growth Study. Bangkok. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nhighway  widening  project  (phase  II)  from  2010  to  2015  are  estimated  to  cost  about  B156.8 \nbillion and B41.7 billion, respectively, but the Government will not be able to entirely allocate the \nstate  budget  for  the  projects.  To  fill  the  gap,  the  Government  requires  financing  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and the private sector.  \n \n4. \nThe  GMS  transport  network  in  Thailand  is  in  good  condition  relative  to  the  GMS \ntransport  network  in  other  countries.  With  funding  from  ADB,  Japan,  and  the  World  Bank,  an \ninitial  rehabilitation  program  on  the  GMS  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  (EWEC)  has  been \ncompleted in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam. A minimum standard \nof  an  all-weather  sealed,  two-lane  highway  has  been  achieved  across  the  EWEC  sections  in \nLao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  Similarly  for  the  Southern  Economic  Corridor  (SEC),  an  initial \nrehabilitation  program  in  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam  is  underway,  and  large  sections  have  been \ncompleted with funding from ADB,  Japan, the OPEC Fund for International Development, and \nthe  World  Bank.  With  this  minimum  standard  throughout  both  corridors  about  to  be  achieved, \nattention has turned to sections where improvements to a four-lane standard are required.  \n \nAt  the  Third  GMS  Summit  held  in  March  2008  in  Vientiane,  Lao  PDR,  a  GMS  Plan  of \n5. \nAction,  2008\u201320123  was  adopted.  This  plan  includes  a  project  to  upgrade  the  EWEC  within \nThailand (Mae Sot\u2013Mukdahan) and the GMS Highway Expansion Project. The Government of \nThailand  intends  to  improve  the  entire  length  of  the  sections  of  the  EWEC  and  SEC  that  lie \nwithin Thailand. For the EWEC in Thailand, work is under way to upgrade a series of sections of \nhighway, and planning has been completed for upgrading the remaining sections in phases. Of \nthe  remaining  work,  the  first  phase  will  upgrade  105  kilometers  (km)  from  Phitsanulok  to  Lom \nSak. Detailed engineering for these sections is in progress. The Department of Highways (DOH) \nwill  upgrade  highways  along  the  remainder  of  the  EWEC  under  the  Mae  Sot\u2013Mukdahan \nupgrading project, as included in the GMS Plan of Action. For the SEC between Bangkok and \nthe border with Cambodia, the entire length has been upgraded to a four-lane highway with the \nexception of a 73 km section between Phanom Sarakham and Sa Kaeo. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nThe  DOH  has  had  sufficient  funds to  cover  all  routine  maintenance,  but  not  enough  to \ncover  periodic  maintenance  requirements  on  all  arterial  roads.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Highways \nManagement  Project4  helped  to  reduce  this  backlog  by  funding  work  on  700  km  of  national \nhighways,  and  enhancing  the  planning  and  programming  capability  at  the  DOH.  The  DOH's \nroad maintenance budget has risen significantly. The road maintenance budget as a percentage \nof  the  total  DOH  budget  was  17.5%  in  1995,  25.6%  in  2000,  and  28.1%  in  2008.  The  gap  in \nperiodic maintenance funding for the arterial roads will be completely bridged within 4\u20135 years. \n \n7. \nThe economic corridor approach, which was adopted by GMS leaders and reaffirmed by \nthe 15th GMS Ministerial Conference (June 2009, Cha-am, Thailand), aims to (i) generate more \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008. Report on the Third Greater Mekong Subregion Summit, Manila. \n4  The development objective of the Highways Management Project is to enhance the efficiency, productive use, and \nmanagement of the road network. Specifically, it supports the commercialization of the road sector, strengthens the \noperations  of  the  DOH,  helps  preserve  road  assets,  and  improves  competition  and  transparency  in  the  award  of \ncontracts. Furthermore, the project will reduce traffic accidents and fatalities on national highways and decentralize \nthe  implementation  of  periodic  maintenance  to  the  districts.  The  project  has  four  components:  (i)  highway \nrehabilitation and maintenance, (ii) highway upgrading and intersection improvement, (iii) road safety improvement, \nand (iv) institutional strengthening. The fourth component includes TA for the development of a framework for and a \ncase  study  on  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  highways.  The  World  Bank  approved  an  $84.3  million  loan  for  the \nproject on 9 December 2003, and is processing an additional loan for widening of five more sections (216 km total) \nof priority national highways from two to four lanes (Table 1). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ncross-border trade; (ii) extend the benefits of improved transport links to remote and landlocked \nlocations  in  the  GMS,  which  have  been  disadvantaged  by  their  lack  of  integration  with  more \nprosperous and better-located neighboring areas; (iii) provide a spatial focus to GMS activities, \nwith the backbone, growth centers, and nodal points serving as catalysts for the development of \nsurrounding areas; (iv) open up many opportunities for investments from within and outside the \nGMS;  and  (v)  enhance  the  impact  of  subregional  activities  through  the  clustering  of  projects. \nThe adoption of this approach assumes that the underlying national networks are adequate and \nefficient, which has not been the case in most countries. Cross-border traffic constitutes a small \nportion of total road traffic in Thailand, but ongoing improvements in their transport infrastructure \ncould  soon  exhaust  the  capacity  of  already  busy  roads.  Therefore,  managing  road  network \ncapacity in the GMS corridors is required to avoid defeating the purpose of transforming these \ncorridors into full-fledged economic corridors. Details are in Appendix 2. \n \n8. \nThe  governments  in  the  GMS  have  recognized  that  providing  subregional  physical \ninfrastructure  is  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient  condition  for  more  connectivity  among  the  six \nGMS  countries.  As  part  of  the  economic  corridor  approach,  mitigating  nonphysical  barriers  to \nthe  cross-border  movement  of  goods  and  people  is  important  to  increase  efficiency,  reduce \ncosts, and maximize the economic benefits of improved subregional transport infrastructure. To \nmitigate  such  barriers,  the  six  GMS  countries5  have  negotiated,  signed,  and  ratified  a  cross-\nborder transport agreement (CBTA). Formulated under a series of ADB TA projects, the CBTA \nprovides a practical approach to streamline regulations and reduce nonphysical barriers to the \ncross-border transport of goods and people in the GMS. It incorporates the principles of bilateral \nor multilateral actions, and flexibility in recognizing differences in procedures in each of the GMS \ncountries. The implementing guidelines of the CBTA have been signed and are expected to be  \nratified  by  all  of  the  GMS  countries  in  2009.  Implementation  of  the  CBTA  along  major  GMS \ncorridors is expected to start in 2010. More information on the CBTA is in Appendix 2. \n \n9. \nPrivate  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  financing  in  Thailand  has  suffered  from \nfinancial  and  contractual  problems,  and  private  investors  may  not  be  ready  to  reenter  the \nmarket.  A  better  policy  environment  is  needed  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision \nand  management  of  infrastructure  services,  and  for  improvement  of  the  infrastructure \nprioritization  and  delivery  process  to  allow  good  projects  to  be  implemented  in  a  timely  and \nefficient  manner.  The  World  Bank-financed  Highways  Management  Project  (footnote  4)  has  a \nTA  component  that  will  (i)  recommend  revisions  to  Thailand's  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory \nframework  for  the  roads  sector  to  ensure  a  clear  separation  of  responsibilities  and  to  provide \neffective  management  of  road  infrastructure;  (ii)  develop  a  program  for  increasing  the \ninstitutional capacity of the DOH, which will be responsible for managing highway assets; and \n(iii)  prepare  a  preliminary  technical  and  financial  assessment  of  the  Bang  Pa-In  (Bangkok)  to \nNakhon Ratchasima motorway, including preparation of a concession agreement for a public\u2013\nprivate partnership to finance, implement,  and  operate the motorway.  The TA component was \ncompleted in the second quarter of 2009. \n \n\n1. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Strategy \n\n \n10. \nTo  reduce  logistics  cost  and  increase  the  country\u2019s  global  competitiveness,  the  Thai \nCabinet on 27 February 2007 agreed upon a Thailand logistics road map. The overall objective \nof  the  road  map  is  to  reduce  logistics  costs  in  Thailand  through  the  promotion  of  (i)  more \nefficient  logistics  in  the  production  sector,  (ii)  more  efficiency  in  the  transport  sector,  (iii)  the \n\n                                                 \n5   The  GMS  comprises  Cambodia,  the  People's  Republic  of  China,  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic,  Myanmar, \n\nThailand, and Viet Nam. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ndevelopment of private sector logistics businesses, (iv) better facilitation for international trade, \nand (v) better human resource development.  \n \n11. \nTo support the policy of the Cabinet with respect to increasing efficiency in the transport \nsector,  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  and  its  Office  of  Transport  and  Traffic  Policy,  with  the \nDOH, will prioritize five areas of road development: (i) intercity motorways, (ii) Bangkok express \nring  roads,  (iii)  industrial  ring  roads,  (iv)  widening  of  highways  to  four  lanes,  and  (v)  roadway \nnetwork  connections  to  neighboring  countries.  Within  the  road  subsector,  the  Government \nintends  to  pursue  its  overall  goal  of  reducing  logistics  costs  and  maintaining  or  increasing  the \ncountry\u2019s regional competitiveness primarily within the framework of these five areas. A number \nof challenges and constraints must be overcome to achieve this goal within a reasonable period, \nincluding  (i)  developing  a  broadly  based  financing  plan  that  reaches  well  beyond  the \ndependence  on  normal  yearly  DOH  budget  allocations;  and  (ii)  making  significant  changes  to \nThailand's  legal  and  contractual  frameworks  to  provide  the  environment  essential  for  the \nintroduction of innovative public\u2013private partnerships. \n \nIn 2009, the Government announced two economic stimulus packages to revitalize the \n12. \neconomy  and  help  low-income  people  in  particular.  The  second  package  focused  on \ninfrastructure  investment,  and  the  highway  four-lane  expansion  is  one  of  the  major  projects  in \nthe  package.  However,  the  Government  cannot  fund  such  large  investment  programs  and \nprojects from domestic financial sources alone. The FY2009 budget provides for expenditures of \nB1.835 trillion plus a supplementary budget of  B116.7 billion, while revenue is expected to be \nB1.425  trillion.  This  will  result  in  a  fiscal  deficit  of  B526.7  billion  in  2009.  Thus,  in  addition  to \ntapping domestic capital markets, the Government is seeking to diversify the sources of funds \nfor  these  programs  and  projects.  It  has  approached  ADB,  Japan,  World  Bank,  and  others  as \npotential cofinanciers. \n \n13. \nThailand  has  been  an  active  member  of  the  GMS  program  since  its  inception  in 1992. \nThailand  has  financed  components  of  priority  subregional  transport  projects  in  its  territory, \nparticipated in subregional projects in the other areas of GMS cooperation, and assisted in the \nimplementation  of  priority  subregional  projects  in  other  GMS  countries.  Thailand  initiated  the \nAyeyawaddy\u2013Chao  Phraya\u2013Mekong  Economic  Cooperation  Strategy  initiative  to  complement \nGMS  cooperation  by  enhancing  the  competitiveness  of  member  countries  (Cambodia,  Lao \nPDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam), thereby facilitating deeper economic integration of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n14. \nThe most recent ADB-funded project in the road subsector in Thailand was the Second \nRegional  Roads  (Sector)  Project,6  which  was  approved  in  September  1995  and  completed  in \nSeptember 2004. In the project completion report,7 the following issues were identified: (i) cash \nflow problems were the single biggest cause of civil works delays, although it was noted that this \nwas largely caused by the 1997 financial crisis; (ii) procurement was delayed because the DOH \nwas unfamiliar with ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents and Cabinet approval of contracts was \nrequired;  (iii)  covenant  compliance,  especially  with  regard  to  submission  of  audited  accounts \nand  adequate  maintenance  of  project  facilities,  needs  to  be  enforced  thoroughly  during \nimplementation;  and  (iv)  an  excessive  number  of  components  involving  too  many  executing \n                                                 \n6   ADB.  1995.

To address these issues, the following actions are \nproposed: (i) using international standard contract documentation following the requirements of \nADB\u2019s international competitive bidding procedures, (ii) providing assistance to the DOH during \nthe preparation and procurement of civil works contracts, (iii) specifically addressing compliance \nwith loan covenants in all ADB loan review missions, and (iv) minimizing the number of project \ncomponents and executing agencies. \n \n\n3. \n\nADB Strategy \n\n \nThe  country  partnership  strategy  for  Thailand  (2007\u20132011) 8   identifies  infrastructure \n15. \ndevelopment  as  a  core  area  of  partnership  with  ADB  at  the  national  level.  By  increasing  the \ncapacity of strategic national highway corridors to transport goods and people, the strategy will \ncontribute  to  higher  productivity  and  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  strategy  promotes  the \napplication  of  country  safeguard  and  procurement  systems,  which  is  consistent  with  the  Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness.9 ADB and the World Bank are working to harmonize policies \nand  procedures  to  reduce  transaction  costs  and  to  align  Thailand\u2019s  systems  with  international \nbest  practice.  The  strategy  also  refers  to  the  development  partnership  between  Thailand  and \nADB  at  the  subregional  level,  and  seeks  to  elevate  Thailand\u2019s  role  in  facilitating  trade  and \ninvestment  within  the  GMS.  By  widening  key  segments  of  the  EWEC  and  SEC,  Thailand  will \nimprove  transport  logistics,  strengthen  trade  links  with  neighboring  countries,  and  deepen \nsubregional cooperation. \n \nADB approved the regional cooperation strategy and program (RCSP) for the GMS10 in \n16. \nMarch  2004.  The  RCSP  update,  2007\u20132009 11  noted  progress  in  implementing  the  strategic \npillars  of  the  RCSP,  which  provide  the  backbone  of  ADB  assistance  toward  enhancing \nconnectivity, improving competitiveness, and engendering a greater sense of community in the \nGMS. In 2006, a GMS transport sector strategy12 was prepared for the period up to 2015 based \non  the  theme  \u201ctowards  seamless  transport  services  on  a  fully  connected  and  integrated  GMS \ntransport  network.\u201d  To  develop  the  transport  infrastructure  of  the  GMS,  the  strategy  proposed \nthe  following  goals:  (i) sectoral  focus,  (ii)  comprehensive  intersectoral  strategy,  and  (iii)  goal-\nsetting  and  results-oriented  management.  A  project  to  improve  sections  of  the  GMS  transport \ncorridors in Thailand would be consistent with the RCSP, as well as the GMS transport sector \nstrategy. \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s strategy for the road sector in Thailand focuses on assisting the MOT in the five \npriority  areas  of  road  development  to  address  improvements  to  the  highway  network  that  will \nreduce  transport  costs  and  increase  competitiveness.  Appendix  3  shows  development \ncoordination  in  the  transport  sector  with  development  partners.  In  the  longer  term,  ADB  can \noffer the most additionality by assisting the MOT in the development of the motorway network \nusing  public\u2013private  partnerships.  However,  planning  for  the  motorway  network  is  incomplete, \nwhereas  preparation  for  making  critical  sections  of  the  highway  network  four  lanes\u2014which  is \nessential  in  the  short  to  medium  term\u2014is  well  advanced.  Given  the  Government\u2019s  recent \nincreased  interest  in  the  use  of  public\u2013private  partnerships  to  finance  infrastructure  projects, \nconsideration  has  been  given  to  the  use  of  these  modalities  for  the  program  to  make  certain \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2007.

However,  the  use  of  public\u2013private  partnerships  for  the  program  is  not \nfeasible  in  most  cases,  because  these  highways  are  not  tolled  and  cannot  be  readily  tolled. \nTypically the roads being upgraded to a four-lane standard are multiuse highways that service \nlocal  and  long-distance  traffic.  The  highways  can  be  accessed  at  any  point,  and  private \naccesses  to  residential  and  commercial  developments  line  the  highways,  particularly  in  urban \nareas. Thus, the toll system would need to be very complex to capture long-distance traffic while \nexempting  local  users  in  an  equitable  and  cost-effective  manner.  Further,  if  tolls  were \nintroduced, the resulting reduction in traffic levels, through the diversion of long-distance traffic \nto  alternative  routes,  would  substantially  reduce  the  economic  viability  of  the  investment.  In \nthese circumstances, designing public\u2013private partnerships that are financially viable enough to \nattract private investment would be very difficult. \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n18. \nThe main thrusts of regional cooperation in the transport sector have been (i) developing \nthe  north\u2013south  corridor  between  Kunming  in  Yunnan  Province  of  the  People's  Republic  of \nChina and Bangkok in Thailand, and the east\u2013west corridor from Thailand and the central coast \nof  Viet  Nam  through  Lao  PDR;  (ii)  linking  the  capitals,  other  population  centers,  and  major \ntourist  destinations  in  the  subregion;  (iii)  helping  develop  remote  and  low-income  areas \ntraversed  by  subregional  road  projects  by  improving  access  to  markets,  and  social  and \neconomic  services;  (iv)  providing  access  to  the  sea  for  landlocked  Lao  PDR,  and  alternative \naccess  to  seaports  for  such  areas  as  northeastern  Thailand  and  Yunnan  Province;  and  (v) \nreducing,  with  the  objective  of  eliminating,  nonphysical  barriers  (such  as  regulations  covering \nborder crossings) to the movement of people and goods in the subregion. GMS road subsector \nprojects financed by ADB are listed in Appendix 3. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n19. \nThe EWEC links the southern part of Myanmar and the northern and northeastern parts \nof  Thailand,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  This  corridor  has  undergone  significant  infrastructure \nimprovements,  particularly  the  upgrading  of  Highway  9  in  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam,  and  the \nbridge across the Mekong River between Mukdahan and Savannakhet, which opened to traffic \nin  January  2007.  Within  Thailand,  improvements  to  the  corridor  have  included  upgrading \nsections  to  a  four-lane  standard  using  domestic  funding.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  Government  of \nThailand to upgrade the entire length of the EWEC within Thailand to a four-lane standard. The \nEWEC connects at a number of points in Thailand to the country's main highway network and \nthe GMS North\u2013South and Northeastern Corridors, thus providing good access to Bangkok and \nthe  ports  of  Thailand.  Improving  the  project  section  will  increase  access  to  international  trade \nwith Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and accelerate the economic development of the less-developed \nareas along the EWEC. Trade at the Mukdahan-Savannakhet border checkpoint was sluggish \nduring the construction of the Second Mekong International Bridge funded by Japan (December \n2003 to December 2006). However, trade in both directions has expanded significantly recently. \nBetween  2006  and  2008,  the  value  of  Thai  exports  expanded  by  nearly  90%,  while  Lao  PDR \nexports  surged  by  more  than  350%  as  a  result  of  larger  copper  shipments  and  the  rise in  the \nprice of that commodity. Movement of people has also increased from under 300 persons per \nday in 2000 to about 500 persons per day in 2006 and 750 persons per day in 2007.13 However, \nthe number of vehicles crossing the border\u2014estimated at about 150 vehicles a day\u2014is below \npotential and a small improvement from the 130 vehicles a day that crossed the border in 2000. \n                                                 \n13 ADB.  2008.  Performance  Evaluation  Report  on  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor \n\nProject in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nCross-border  trade  and  traffic,  including  transit  trade,  is  expected  to  increase  with  the  start  in \nJune 2009 of the three-country exchange of traffic rights' arrangements and the introduction of a \ncustoms transit system among Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam along the EWEC. \n \nThe SEC's central sub-corridor links Bangkok with Cambodia and the southern areas of \n20. \nViet Nam, including Ho Chi Minh City, by a 924 km road. It may be extended west from Bangkok \nto  provide  an  additional  link  with  Myanmar.  The  subproject  section  on  this  corridor,  Phanom \nSarakham\u2013Sa  Kaeo,  is  the  only  one  in  Thailand  that  is  not  already  four  lanes.  An  alternative \nroute  using  highways  304  and  33  is  four  lanes,  but  the  route  using  Highway  359  (Phanom \nSarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo section) is the most direct and is preferred for long-distance traffic. It is a \nnew road with a very high standard of alignment, avoiding the urban centers of Kabin Buri and \nSa  Kaeo  that  are  located  on  the  alternative  route.  The  main  border  crossing  point  between \nThailand  and  Cambodia  is  east  of  Sa  Kaeo  at  Aranyaprathet\u2013Poipet.  The  SEC  continues  as \nCambodian Highway 5 to Phnom Penh (with a branch via Highway 6 to the major tourist site of \nAngkor Wat near Siem  Reap), then as Highway 1 to the   Bavet\u2013Moc  Bai border crossing into \nViet Nam, and finally as Viet Nam Highway 22 to Ho Chi Minh City. Formal cross-border exports \nfrom Thailand to Cambodia rose from B1.26 billion in 1996 to B32.2 billion in 2007, an average \nincrease of 42.8% per year.14 The Aranyaprathet border checkpoint accounted for about half of \nthe  cross-border  exports  from  Thailand  to  Cambodia.  Major  exports  from  Thailand  include \nmotorcycles and parts, cement, engines, livestock feeds, petroleum, woven fabrics, textiles, and \nchemical  fertilizers,  with  the  largest  being  motorcycles  and  parts.  Cross-border  imports  of \nThailand from Cambodia also rose from B1.0 billion in 1996 to B1.6 billion in 2007, an annual \naverage  growth  rate  of  20%;  the  Aranyaprathet  border  checkpoint  accounted  for  two-thirds  of \nthe  total.  The  major  products  imported  by  Thailand  through  the  border  gates  include  metal \nwastes, used clothes, corn feeds for livestock, soybean grain, ready-made clothes, and tapioca. \nThe balance of trade has consistently been in favor of Thailand, whose exports were 20 times \nlarger than its imports in 2007. \n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n21. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  increase  in  competitiveness  of  the  local  economy  in  the \nprovinces  along  the  EWEC  and  SEC.  By  2018,  GDP  in  the  provinces,  in  which  the  project \nhighways are expanded, is expected to be increased by 20%, and value of cross-border trade \ncarried by road transport with other GMS countries along the EWEC and SEC is expected to be \nincreased by 20%, compared to the baseline data to be collected in 2010. The project outcome \nwill be a more efficient and safer EWEC and SEC in Thailand. Compared to the baseline data, a \nreduction in passenger and freight operating costs of 10%, a reduction in travel times of 15%, \nan  increase  in  traffic  volume  of  5%,  and  a  reduction  in  traffic  accidents  fatalities  of  40%  are \nexpected for the project highway sections by 2015.   \n \nThe economy in the project area depends mainly on agriculture and natural resources, \n22. \nand  rearing  livestock  is  very  important.  The  project  area  shows  little  evidence  of  contract \nfarming,  except  among  vegetable  growers  who  provide  a  range  of  cool-weather  vegetables \n(e.g.,  peas,  beans,  and  broccoli)  to  high-end  supermarkets  in  Thailand.  Apart  from  the \nmanufacture  of  pulp  and  paper  products,  the  project  area  has  little  manufacturing.  However, \nthere  are  many  examples  and  small  amounts  of  products  being  manufactured  locally.  The \n\n                                                 \n14 Cross-border trade covers only formal trade and is defined as trade conducted through land borders as contrasted \nto trade conducted through sea and air transport.

Access  to  the  limited  areas  of  forests  that  remain  to  collect  non-timber \nforest  products  is  very  circumscribed,  although  it  is  permitted  in  some  instances.  Service \nindustries are well developed in the major provincial centers; Khon Kaen is the most developed \nin  terms  of  education  and  health  care.  Other  sectors,  such  as  tourism,  are  not  very  well \ndeveloped  in  the  project  area,  except  in  Phetchabun.  In  general,  the  project  area  offers  few \nemployment  opportunities  outside  of  agriculture.  Positive  impacts  arising  from  the  Project \nrelating  to  poverty  reduction  will  include  (i)  the  development  of  agriculture-based  income-\ngeneration  activities  to  meet  unmet  demand  for  meat  products  in  other  GMS  countries;  (ii) \nimportation  of  sugarcane  and  cassava  from  the  Lao  PDR  for  value-adding  into  biofuels;  (iii) \ngrowth  in  domestic,  regional,  and  international  tourism;  (iv)  greater  development  of  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprises, especially with the bridging finance afforded when activities can be \nlinked  to  Thailand\u2019s  One-Tambon  (subdistrict),  One-Product  program;  (v)  revitalization  of  local \nculture  and  preservation  of  traditional  skills,  including  dance,  music,  embroidery,  and  silk-\nweaving;  and  (vi)  promotion  of  greater  cultural  understanding  in  a  region  where  it  has  taken \nmore  than  4  decades  to  transcend  lingering  cultural  doubts  about  GMS  neighbors.  Further \ninformation is in Appendix 4.   \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n23. \nThe  Project  will  upgrade  about  178  km  of  two-lane  national  highway  to  a  four-lane \ndivided  highway  standard.  Works  include  new  bridges  and  widening  of  existing  bridges, \nreinforced  concrete  box  and  pipe  culvert  improvements,  new  asphaltic  concrete  pavement \nsections, and the strengthening and overlay of existing pavement sections. In addition, specific \nroadway safety improvements, such as provision for pedestrian overpasses, improved signage \nand  pavement  markings,  and  pavement  widening  at  bus  stops,  will  be  incorporated  into  the \nimprovements. The 178 km are along two sections of highway: Highway 12 from Phitsanulok to \nLom Sak (105 km) is on the EWEC; and Highway 359 from Phanom Sarakham to Sa Kaeo (73 \nkm),  is  along  the  SEC.  A  summary  of  the  proposed  civil  works  under  this  component  is  in \nAppendix 5. The DOH will establish a project performance monitoring system (para. 40). \n\n \n24. \nOver  the  past  10  years,  attempts  have  been  made  to  initiate  the  development  of  the \nmotorway network. However, these foundered  because a detailed implementation strategy and \na  credible  financing  plan  were  lacking.  TA  will  be  provided  to  assist  the  MOT  and  DOH  in \npreparing an implementation plan for the Strategic Intercity Motorway Network Project. The plan \nwill develop a detailed and coordinated implementation and financing plan for strategic intercity \nmotorways along three corridors radiating out from Bangkok to a distance of 200\u2013250 km, and \nwill include a detailed analysis of financing alternatives. This implementation plan is intended to \nprovide  the  basis  for  future  ADB  assistance  to  Thailand\u2019s  road  subsector  through  public  and \nprivate sector operations. ADB will fund this component through a TA grant. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n25. \nThe  Project  is  part  of  the  DOH  Four-Lane  Highway  Widening  Project  (Phase  II)  to \nupgrade about 433 km of eight national highway sections from a two-lane highway standard to a \nfour-lane  divided  highway  standard.  The  project  profile  is  in  Table  1.  The  Ministry  of  Finance \ninvited ADB and the World Bank to jointly assist in financing the Project, which includes seven \nhighway sections in the north, east, and south of the country. It is proposed that ADB assist the \nDOH by providing funding for the upgrading of the Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak section on the EWEC \nand the Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo section on the SEC. The World Bank will assist the DOH \nwith funding for five sections. ADB and the World Bank are preparing separate projects to cover \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\ntheir respective sections. However, the institutions are closely cooperating with each other, and \nharmonizing  and  standardizing  documentation  and  procedures  to  the  extent  possible.  The \nProject  supports  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  reduce  logistics  costs  by  widening  highways  to \nfour lanes and improving roadway network connections to neighboring countries. \n \n\nTable 1: DOH Four-Lane Highway Widening Project (Phase II) \n \n\n \nHighways \n\n \n4-Laning Highway Sections \n\n \nNo. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n\n12  Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak \n201  Si Kiu\u2013Nongbuakhok \n\n2042  Nakrai\u2013Khamcha-i  \n\n24  Si Kiu\u2013Ubon Ratchathani \n\n331  Satthahip\u2013Phanom Sarakham \n359  Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo \n\n4  Phang Nga\u2013Krabi  \n\nLength  \n(km) \n105 \n  60 \n  33 \n  65 \n  28 \n  73 \n  27 \n  36 \n\nPlanned \nFinancer \nADB \nWorld Bank \nDOHa \nWorld Bank \nWorld Bank \nADB \nWorld Bank \nWorld Bank \n\n408  Nakhon Si Thammarat\u2013Ranot Sathing Phra \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DOH = Department of Highways, km = kilometer. \na Because of difficulty with land acquisition and resettlement along Highway 2042, the DOH decided to finance the \nhighway widening of the Highway by the Government fund. \nSources: Department of Highways and ADB. \n\n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $179.4  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $15.4 \n26. \nmillion. A summary of the project investment plan is in Table 2, and detailed cost estimates are \nin Appendix 6.  \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n27. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $77.1  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, an annual commitment charge of 0.15%, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n28. \nThe ADB loan will finance about 43% of the project costs. The ADB loan will be allocated \nto  fund  50%  of  the  civil  works  costs  and  the  consulting  services  costs.  The  Government  will \nfinance about 57% of the project cost, the equivalent of about $102.3 million. The Government \nfunds will be allocated to fund the remainder of the civil works costs and the consulting services \ncosts, taxes and duties, and financial charges during implementation.

The  DOH  established  a  project  management  unit \n(PMU) that will act as the focal point for interagency coordination and communication with ADB \nand the Government agencies concerned. The PMU will (i) carry out procurement, (ii) supervise \nthe consultants and contractors under the Project, (iii) prepare the necessary documentation for \nthe withdrawal of loan proceeds, and (iv) prepare periodic reports to ADB. The DOH appointed \nthe  deputy  director  general  for  engineering  as  the  project  director  to  head  the  PMU  and \nsupervise  project  implementation.  The  director  of  the  Highway  Construction  Bureau,  DOH  will \nassist  the  project  director  as  the  deputy  project  director.  In  addition,  the  DOH  appointed  the \ndirector  of  the  Bureau  of  International  Highways  Cooperation  to  act  as  the  assistant  project \ndirector of the PMU and assume responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of the Project. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \nF. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nThe assistant project director will be assisted by a number of qualified DOH staff. The DOH will \nalso assign an advisory team of technical specialists as well as two area chief engineers. The \nDOH will engage and direct the work of the construction supervision consultant, and will procure \nand direct all contractors. The consultant will provide a project manager and two area engineers \nand  other  specialists 15  to  provide  construction  management  services.  The  DOH  will  appoint \neight resident engineers (one for each of the eight civil works contract packages), as well as a \nfull  complement  of  field  engineers,  inspectors,  technicians,  and  surveyors,  working  with  the \nconsultant. The consultant and DOH staff will occupy adjoining office space in the same building \nto  be  provided  under  the  civil  works  contracts  at  each  of  the  two  subprojects  sites.  This  will \nensure  close  communication  and  coordination  between  the  DOH  and  consultant  teams.  A \nproject organization chart is in Appendix 7.  \n \n30.  Within 2 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish a project steering \ncommittee (PSC), to be chaired by the director general of the DOH. Its members will be senior \nrepresentatives from the DOH, the Public Debt Management Office of the Ministry of Finance, \nthe  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Board,  the  Bureau  of  Budget,  the  Office  of \nTransport and Traffic Policy and Planning, the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental \nPolicy and Planning, and the Office of the Attorney General. The PSC will meet semiannually. \nThe  PSC  will  (i)  provide  the  PMU  with  policy  guidance,  (ii)  review  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation, and (iii) handle cross-sector issues related to the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nthe  most  construction-related  difficulties  during \n\n31. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4.5  years  with  completion  date  by  31  December \n2014. It is expected that the construction works on Highway 359 will start in the third quarter of \n2010, and the works on Highway 12 will begin by the second quarter of 2011. Highway 12 may \noffer \nthe \nmountainous  terrain  and  the  need  to  carefully  monitor  environmental  safeguards.  Hence,  the \nimplementation period for each of the five packages on Highway 12 has been extended to 36 \nmonths,  or  until  the  first  quarter  of  2014.  An  additional  6  months,  or  until  the  third  quarter  of \n2014,  is  allowed  to  provide  for  any  construction  time  extensions,  final  contract  payments,  and \nfor the maintenance period. An implementation schedule for the Project is in Appendix 8. \n \n\nimplementation  because  of \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n32. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  civil  works  to  be \nfunded  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures \nwith  pre-qualification.  Eight  civil  works  packages  will  be  procured,  of  which  five  will  be  for \nHighway 12 (Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak) and three for Highway 359 (Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo). \nProcurement details are in the procurement plan in Appendix 9. \n \n33. \nAdvance  contracting  for  civil  works  contracts  will  be  required;  retroactive  financing  will \nnot  be  required.  The  Government  was  advised  that  the  approval  of  advance  action  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n15  Environmental specialists, resettlement and social development specialists, and HIV/AIDS specialists. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  DOH  will  recruit  an  international  consulting  firm  for  construction  supervision  using \n34. \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Full technical proposals will be required. \nIn  the  evaluation  of  proposals,  to  calculate  the  total  scores  of  short-listed  firms,  the  technical \nproposals  will  be  given  a  weight  of  80%  and  the  financial  proposals  will  be  given  a  weight  of \n20%.  About  65  person-months  of  input  from  international  experts  will  be  required,  with  about \n145  person-months  from  national  experts  to  assist  the  international  experts.  Expertise  will  be \nrequired in contract management, highway construction, resettlement and social development, \nHIV/AIDS  awareness,  environmental  mitigation,  and  project  performance  monitoring. \nRecruitment details are in the procurement plan in Appendix 9. The outline terms of reference \nfor the construction supervision consulting services are in Appendix 10.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n35. \nwith  the  Government  and  Executing  Agency.  The  Government  will:  (i)  undertake  necessary \nmeasures to create and sustain a corruption-free environment for activities under the Project; (ii) \ncomply  with  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy;  and  (iii)  where  appropriate,  ensure  that  relevant \nprovisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in all bidding documents for the Project. \nConsistent with  ADB's  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  the \nGovernment:  (i)  acknowledges  ADB's  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project; and (ii) agrees \nto cooperate fully with any such investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including \nproviding  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  may  be  necessary  for  the  satisfactory \ncompletion of any such investigation. All external costs related to such investigations will be met \nby the Project resources or by the Government. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe  Project.  In  particular,  the  Government  shall:  (i)  conduct  periodic  inspections  on  the \nsuppliers', contractors', and other service providers' activities related to the Loan proceeds, fund \nwithdrawals  and  settlements;  and  (ii)  ensure  that  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection \nwith the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \nTo  ensure  transparency  and  good  governance,  the  DOH  will  publicly  disclose  on  its \n36. \nwebsite information on how loan proceeds are being used. For each procurement contract, the \nDOH  will  disclose  (i)  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  (ii)  the  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  (iii) \nbasic details on bidding procedures adopted, (iv) the amount of the contract awarded, and (v) a \nlist  of  goods  and/or  services  purchased.  The  DOH  will  also  disclose  details  of  resettlement \nreports  on  its  website.  The  website  will  be  updated  within  2  weeks  of  each  contract  being \nawarded. The DOH will also submit resettlement monitoring reports to ADB every quarter. The \nresettlement  reports  will  be  uploaded  onto  the  DOH\u2019s  website  within  2  weeks  of  their \nsubmission.  Moreover,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  all  of  the  DOH\u2019s  project  staff  are  fully \naware of and comply with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s procedures, including procedures for (i) \nimplementation,  (ii)  procurement,  (iii)  use  of  consultants,  (iv)  disbursement,  (v)  reporting,  (vi) \nmonitoring, and (vii) prevention of fraud and corruption. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nLoan  disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n37. \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  directly  to  the  contractors  and \nconsultants,  based  on  an  approved  contract  using  direct  payment  procedures.  An  imprest \naccount will not be established. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n38. \nThe DOH will maintain separate records and accounts to identify the works and services \nfinanced  from  the  proceeds  of  the  project  loan,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and use of local funds. Within 6 months of the close of the each year, \nthe DOH will submit to ADB audited annual project accounts that  provide a detailed description \nof  the  source  of  funds  and  expenditures  made.  Annual  project  accounts  will  be  audited  by  an \nauditor acceptable to ADB, and the auditor\u2019s terms of reference will be approved by ADB before \nwork starts if the DOH engages an auditing firm. \n \n39. \nThe  construction  supervision  consultants  will  prepare  progress  reports  on  the  Project, \nwhich will be reviewed by the DOH and submitted by the DOH to ADB every month during the \nproject  implementation  period.  The  reports  will  include  a  description  of  the  physical  progress, \nstatus of implementation of updated resettlement plans, status of work subject to provisions of \nthe environmental management plan (EMP), procurement and contractual status, and highlights \nof  any  implementation  issues.  The  reports  will  also  contain  a  summary  of  project  accounts, \nincluding details of the latest project expenditures and contract amounts. The reports will include \nan evaluation of progress in implementing the Project. Within 6 months of physical completion of \nthe Project, the DOH will furnish to ADB a project completion report covering details of project \nimplementation,  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  and  accomplishments  in  relation  to  the  Project's \noutcome and impact. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n40. \nThe DOH will establish, within 6 months of the loan effective date, a project performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  that  will  operate  throughout  the  life  of  the  Project  and \nintegrate it with the existing management information system. Initially, the monitoring system will \ndevelop  and  conduct  sample  surveys  to  establish  baseline  data  for  subsequent  performance \nmonitoring,  and  will  establish  pre-project  social  and  economic  living  conditions  for  the  direct \nproject beneficiaries. These baseline surveys will be carried out within a year of the start of the \nservices of the supervision consultant, and will ensure that sufficient data is gathered to monitor \nthe indicators set out in the design and monitoring framework for the Project. A second survey \nwill be carried out on project completion and a third survey not less than 5 years  after project \ncompletion. The baseline and impact surveys will include areas affected by the Project and will \nassess  all  interventions  under  the  Project,  including  resettlement  and  other  safeguard \ninterventions  that  affect  the  livelihood  of  project  beneficiaries.  In  addition,  a  set  of  indicators \nreflecting  transport  costs,  tariffs,  and  mobility  will  be  developed  to  assess  the  effects  of  better \naccess. District indicators will include agricultural productivity, economic activity, and health and \neducation sectors. \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB, with Government representatives and in coordination with the World Bank's project \n41. \nteam, will undertake regular reviews of the Project at about 6-month intervals to assess (i) the \nprogress  of  the  resettlement  and  civil  works,  (ii)  environmental  impact  mitigation  works,  (iii) \ndisbursement  progress,  and  (iv)  compliance  with  the  loan  assurances.  The  reviews  will  also \nassess the potential risk for achieving the project outcome, particularly after the midterm review. \nAt  critical  periods  during  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  EMPs,  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement  and  environment  specialists  will  join  the  reviews.  In  addition  to  these  regular \nreviews,  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  of  Project  implementation  will  be  carried  out  at  the \nend  of  the  second  year  of  the  project  implementation.  This  midterm  review  will  allow  for  any \nnecessary  midcourse  corrections.  About  1  year  after  project  completion  a  project  completion \nreview will document the achievements of the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\n42. \nThe road network in Thailand comprises about 202,000 km, of which about 51,500 km \nare classified as highways, 150,000 km as rural roads, and about 450 km as controlled access \nexpressway  and  motorways.  The  DOH  is  the  primary  Government  agency  responsible  for  the \nplanning, construction, maintenance, and operation of the road network. Over the past 10 years, \nthe  Government's  highway  subsector  strategy  has  focused  on  making  national  highways  four \nlanes. However, during this period, intercity motorways or additional expressways in the vicinity \nof  Bangkok  have  not  been  emphasized,  and  a  coherent  public  investment  plan  for  intercity \nmotorways does not appear to exist. The development of this network is becoming essential if \nadequate  highway  capacity  is  to  be  provided,  particular  in  the  areas  close  to  Bangkok.  The \nGovernment prioritizes construction of intercity motorways (para. 11). The World Bank-financed \nHighways  Management  Project  (footnote  4)  includes  a  TA  component  prepared  for  the  DOH \nthat will provide recommendations for implementing a restructured framework for private sector \nparticipation in financing, construction, operations, and maintenance activities.  \n \nThe GMS economic corridors are defined as an expansion of key transport corridors to \n43. \nenhance  economic  activities  and  benefits.  The  development  of  nodal  points  of  the  corridors, \nwhich  should  serve  as  centers  for  enterprise  development,  is  required  to  transform  transport \ncorridors into economic corridors. Bangkok is one of the principal nodal cities in the GMS, and is \nthe origin and destination of the GMS North\u2013South, Southern, and Southern Coastal Corridors. \nConstruction  of  the  motorways  in  the  Bangkok  metropolitan  area  will  strengthen  connectivity \nbetween Bangkok and cities in the suburbs of Bangkok, and will induce private investment in the \nmetropolitan area. In the GMS context, the Bangkok motorway projects will serve as the nodal \ndevelopment,  compared  to  the  GMS  Highway  Expansion  Project  and  other  GMS  highway \nprojects referred as link development.     \n \nB. \n\nProposed Study \n\n44. \nThe overall objective of the TA study will be to provide the Government with a detailed \nimplementation plan for the motorway corridors, and to prepare the highest priority project ready \nfor  award  and  implementation  using  an  appropriate  public\u2013private  partnership  model.  The  TA \nwill concentrate on three motorway links: (i) Chonburi to Map Ta Put, including an access link to \nLaem Chabang Port; (ii) Bang Yai to Nakhon Pathom (Bang Pong) to Cha-am; and (iii) Nakhon \nPathom to Kanchanaburi. In general, the TA study will build upon the work and documentation \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nalready  prepared  under  the  World  Bank's  TA  for  the  DOH  on  the  Bang  Pa-In  to  Nakhon \nRatchasima  Motorway.  To  realize  the  overall  objective,  the  TA  study  will  carried  out  in  three \nphases:  (i)  the  inspection  and  screening  phase  to  review  and  study  market  issues  and \nregulatory  structures  for  the  Thai  road  sector;  (ii)  the  project  preparation  phase  to  prepare  a \nproject for the selected motorway link; and (iii) the procurement assistance phase to finalize the \ntender documents and assist the DOH with procurement. A summary of the TA, including terms \nof reference for the consulting services, reporting requirements, and detailed breakdown of the \ncost estimate, is in Appendix 11. \n \n45. \nThese services are estimated to cost $1.45 million; it is proposed that ADB will finance \n$1.0 million. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by Japan Special Fund. The Government \nof  Thailand  will  finance  the  remaining  $0.45  million  through  in-kind  contributions  of  the \nExecuting Agency\u2014remuneration and allowances for counterpart staff; furnished offices for the \nstudy team; and the provision of maps, reports, and other information.  \n \n46. \nThe DOH will be the Executing Agency for the study. The Bureau of Planning will be the \nimplementing  agency  responsible  for  day-to-day  oversight.  A  steering  committee  will  be \nestablished to give direction and guidance to the consultants. Members of this committee will be \nnominated from the DOH (at deputy director general level), the Office of Transport and Traffic \nManagement Policy and Planning, the National Economic and Social Development  Board, the \nPublic Debt Management Office, and the Budget Bureau of the Office of the Prime Minister.  \n \n47. \nAn international consulting firm in association with national consultants will undertake the \nconsulting  services  for  the  TA.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  by  ADB  according  to  the  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  its  quality-  and  cost-based  recruitment  procedures. \nShort-listed international consulting firms will submit simplified technical proposals, which will be \nassigned a weight of 90% in the calculation of the firms\u2019 total scores; the financial proposals will \nbe  given  a  weight  of  10%.  This  proposed  weighting  reflects  the  technical  difficulty  and \ncomplexity  of  the  consulting  services.  About  45  person-months  of  consulting  inputs  will  be \nrequired\u201422 person-months from international consultants and 23 person-months from national \nconsultants. The consulting services will be implemented over 18 months, from 1 April 2010 to \n30 September 2011. The consultants will have expertise in (i) project feasibility assessment, (ii) \nhighway design and construction, (iii) formulation of public\u2013private partnerships appropriate for \nlarge infrastructure projects, (iv) financial analysis, (v) legal documentation and regulations, (vi) \nsocial and environmental safeguards, and (vii) procurement. Equipment financed under the TA \nwill  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  will  be  handed  over  to  the \nDOH at the end of the services. The TA will start in October 2009 and close in December 2011 \nto allow time for completion of documentation and final payments.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n48. \nEconomic  Viability.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  was \ncalculated by comparing the with- and without-project scenarios for the project highways. In the \nwithout-project  scenario,  the  highways  are  assumed  to  remain  at  their  current  width.  Both \nproject scenarios include routine and periodic maintenance according to current Thai standards. \nWithout the Project, the traffic volume would exceed the capacity of the highways, which would \nbecome  congested\u2014leading  to  increases  in  travel  time  and  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs). \nWith  the  Project,  travel  time  would  decrease  because  of  higher  speeds,  and  VOCs  would \ndecline  because  of  the  faster  and  smoother  ride  on  the  project  highways.  The  economic \nanalysis  was  carried  out  using  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance  Standards  Model.  The \nmodel evaluates the project investment considering capital and recurrent costs, as well as the \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nbenefits derived from savings in road user costs for the with- and without-project cases. In the \neconomic  analysis,  the  project  life  after  completion  of  works  was  taken  to  be  20  years.  The \neconomic  costs  of  the  Project  include  the  resource  costs  for  construction,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance;  and  the  social  costs of  compensation  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The \neconomic  benefits  were  quantified  in  terms  of  VOC,  time,  and  accident  cost  savings.  The \nestimated EIRR for the Highway 12 section is 12.2% and for the Highway 359 section is 20.1%, \nindicating  that  all  project  components  are  economically  viable.  The  estimated  EIRR  for  the \nProject  as  a  whole  is  15.8%.  The  economic  viability  is  generally  robust.  The  capital  cost \nincrease up to 52.6% or the benefit reduction up to 36.1% ensures the project EIRR higher than \n12%. A risk analysis using the @Risk computer program was also undertaken to determine the \nprobability  of  the  EIRR  falling  below  12%.  The  analysis  shows  a  15.3%  risk  that  the  Project \nwould  not  reach  the  minimum  EIRR  of  12%  for  economic  viability.  The  economic  analysis  is \nsummarized in Appendix 12. \n \n49. \nResettlement.  The  highway  right-of-ways  (ROWs)  has  been  acquired,  and  it  was \nestablished and demarcated as early as the 1950s (Highway 12) and 2000 (Highway 359). The \nentire ROW of highways 12 and 359 will be cleared of all obstructions. The census and detailed \nmeasurement  surveys  carried  out  in  October  and  November  2008  in  Highway  359  identified \nabout 261 households. An additional 92 households were found during the census and detailed \nmeasurement  survey  in  March  2009  in  Highway  12.  These  households  had  stalls  and/or \nshelters and tilling paddy land inside the ROW. The resettlement plan prepared for the Project \nwas formulated in a way that recognizes that, while the ROWs of the two highways have been \nacquired,  the  affected  people\u2019s  livelihood  will  be  able  to  continue  with  minimal  disruption  and \nthat  their  socioeconomic  conditions  will  be  maintained,  if  not  improved.  A  copy  of  the  project \nresettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix A and a summary of the resettlement plan is in \nAppendix 13. The DOH will assist by coordinating with the resettlement coordinating committee \nand Tambon Administration Office to find replacement land for stalls and shelters in a way that \nwill  allow  for  the  gradual  transfer  of  business  operation  to  the  new  site,  thereby  avoiding  any \nbusiness disruption. Poor and vulnerable households will be given priority in choosing stalls in \nthe  new  sites.  Consultation  meetings  were  carried  out  during  preparation  of  the  resettlement \nplan,  and  key  information  was  disclosed  to  the  affected  people  before  ADB  appraisal. \nImplementation  arrangements  have  been  designed  following  a  participatory  approach,  while  a \ngrievance  mechanism  and  monitoring  have  been  established  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \nresettlement plan from updating to implementation.  \n \n50. \nEnvironmental Impacts. The Project will widen two sections of paved highways. Based \non the requirements of the ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), the Project has been classified as \nenvironmental  category  B  (sensitive)  because \nthe  alignment  along  Highway  12  (the \nPhitsanulok\u2013Lom  Sak  section)  traverses  the  Thung  Salaeng  Luang  National  Park  and  several \nsensitive watershed designations. The highway was constructed in 1960, while the national park \nwas  declared  as  such  in  1975.  The  proposed  highway  expansion  will  be  restricted  to  areas \nwithin the existing 60-meter ROW of Highway 12. The park designation does not extend inside \nthe  ROW  pursuant  to  the  Royal  Decree  for  Separation  of  Highway  Right-of-Way  from  Thung \nSalaeng  Luang  National  Park.  Further,  all  portions  of  the  ROW  that  encompass  sensitive \nwatersheds  or  are  adjacent  to  the  national  park  have  been  previously  disturbed  or  developed \nthrough  activities  such  as  logging,  agriculture,  or  roadway  and  commercial  construction.  As \nsuch,  these  areas  are  in  a  degraded  condition  with  respect  to  ecological  resources.  The \nadjacent  portions  of  the  national  park  have  also  been  previously  degraded  through  similar \nactivities,  as  noted  for  the  ROW.  Native  habitats  generally  are  absent  within  50\u201360  meters  of \nthe ROW, and the most sensitive (core) habitat areas of the park are about 2 km or more south \nof  the  alignment.  No  protected  areas,  such  as  national  parks,  designated  forests,  or  sensitive \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nwatersheds, are within or adjacent to Highway 359 (the Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo section). \nThe section is in an area of generally level terrain and is predominantly agricultural. \n \n51. \nThe  predicted  environmental  impacts  during  construction  include  air  pollution,  mainly \nfrom  dust  emissions;  noise  and  vibration;  water  pollution  from  fuel  spills  and  improper  waste \ndisposal;  soil  erosion  and  siltation  of  water  courses  because  of  earthworks  and  extraction  of \nborrow materials; and habitat loss from vegetation clearing. The Project is expected to improve \nthe  ecological  condition  within  the  ROW  of  the  two  highway  sections.  The  Project  will  include \nextensive  tree  replanting  (utilizing  native  species),  landscaping,  erosion  control,  slope \nstabilization, and water quality control. Wildlife crossings will also be provided for road sections \nalong Highway 12. These will be either project design or mitigation measures, and will include \napplicable  monitoring  programs  to  ensure  proper  function  and  identify  necessary  remedial \nmeasures.  Impacts  during  the  operations  phase  are  expected  to  be  limited  mainly  to  air  and \nnoise  pollution  from  vehicles.  The  proposed  project  design  includes  a  number  of  monitoring \nefforts  to  identify  site-specific  locations  where  regulatory  standards  cannot  be  met.  In  those \ncases, additional mitigation measures will be implemented, as appropriate. \n \n52. \nAn EMP has been prepared detailing mitigation and monitoring requirements, associated \nimplementation responsibilities, schedules, preliminary costs, reporting frequency, and capacity \nbuilding  or  training  requirements.  Timely  and  proper  implementation  of  mitigation  measures \ndefined in the EMP will help ensure that the Project will not significantly harm the environment. \nA copy of the summary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n53. \nGender. In the project area, poor women and households headed by females are more \nat  risk  economically  (loss  of  productive  assets  because  of  construction  activities)  and  socially \n(risks posed by HIV/AIDS, road safety, and possible human trafficking) than males. To address \nthe  loss  of  livelihoods  of  poor  women  and  households  headed  by  females,  the  project \nresettlement  plan  includes  livelihood  restoration  targeted  at  women  in  the  project  districts.  A \nproject-specific gender strategy has been prepared, as set out in the summary poverty reduction \nand  social  strategy  (Appendix  4).  The  gender  strategy  includes  capacity  building  training  and \nconsultation workshop with affected households to increase their understanding of resettlement \nissues  (such  as  compensation,  entitlements,  and  grievance  procedures),  and  to  develop  skills \nfor appropriate livelihood activities. The contractors and construction supervision consultant are \nalso  encouraged  to  employ  preferentially  female  workers  from  project-affected  households  for \ntheir office work positions. \n \nHIV.  To  meet  the  challenge  of  an  increase  in  sexually  transmitted  infections,  including \n54. \nHIV, that can be directly linked to construction-based activities, mitigation measures have been \nincluded.  As  part  of  an  HIV  awareness  campaign,  activities  will  include  the  distribution  of  free \ncondoms  to  targeted  groups,  advice  on  access  to  testing  and  treatment  for  HIV  and  other \nsexually transmitted diseases, and greater awareness of behavior that increases risks. Activities \nunder this campaign will be consistent with the work proposed under the TA for HIV Prevention \nand Infrastructure: Mitigating Risk in the Greater Mekong Subregion, funded by the Government \nof  Australia.16  Awareness  activities,  including  capacity  building  of  the  DOH,  will  also  address \nhuman  trafficking,  awareness  on  safe  migration,  and  community  monitoring.  The  Project  will \nsupport  campaigns  in  schools  and  temples  of  local  communities  to  raise  awareness  of  the \nnegative impacts of people trafficking. Consultations with a range of local experts (including law \nenforcement  officials)  strongly  suggested  that  there  is  little  causal  relationship  between \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2008. HIV Prevention and Infrastructure: Mitigating Risk in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila (TA6467-\n\nREG).  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nwidening  of  these  highways  to  four  lanes  and  an  increase  in  people  trafficking  or  drug \ntrafficking. \n \n55. \nRoad  Safety.  The four-lane highways are expected to provide road users with a safer \nenvironment compared with two-lane roads. However, to realize this benefit, road users who are \naccustomed to driving at low speeds on two-lane roads will have to adapt their behavior to the \nimproved four-lane highways. To address the adaptation process and other road safety issues, \nroad  safety  audits  and  road  safety  awareness  campaigns  are  included  in  the  tasks  for  the \nconstruction supervision consultant. \n \n56. \nProject  Implementation.    Previous  road  sector  projects  in  Thailand  identified  the \nfollowing  issues:  (i)  procurement  was  delayed  because  the  DOH  was  not  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \nstandard  bidding  documents;  (ii)  some  covenants,  especially  on  submission  of  audited \naccounts,  were  not  complied  with;  and  (iii)  an  excessive  number  of  components  involving  too \nmany  executing  agencies  complicated  project  administration.  To  address  these  issues,  the \nfollowing  measures  have  been  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  Project:  (i)  the  project \npreparation  TA  consultants  are  assisting  DOH  in  preparing  international  standard  contract \ndocumentation for the civil works following the requirements of ADB\u2019s international competitive \nbidding procedures, and will assist DOH in undertaking the procurement until the contracts are \nawarded;  (ii)  timely  compliance  with  loan  covenants  will  be  addressed  in  all  ADB  loan  review \nmissions;  and  (iii)  the  Project  has  only  two  components,  and  the  DOH  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency for both. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n57. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nfund.  The  Government  will  ensure \n\nCounterpart \nthe \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  adequate  budgetary  allocation  of  the  required \ncounterpart  funds  are  requested,  approved  and  released  in  a  timely  manner  to \nensure proper implementation of the Project. \n\nthroughout \n\nthat \n\nResettlement. The Government will ensure that: (a) any involuntary resettlement \nis  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  Resettlement  Plan,  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations  on  involuntary  resettlement.  In  case  of  differences  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s  laws  and regulations and  ADB's  Policy,  ADB's  Policy  will  prevail; \n(b)  adequate  resources  are  made  available  for  the  implementation  of  the \nResettlement Plan; (c) the Resettlement Plan is implemented effectively and in a \ntimely  manner;  (d)  civil  works  contractors  will  assist  DOH  in  the  resettlement \nactivities,  and  do  not  commence  construction  work  in  a  particular  geographic \narea  until  the  affected  people  in  the  area  are  assisted  and  relocated  in \naccordance  with  the  agreed  Resettlement  Plan;  and  (e)  monitoring  of  the \nresettlement  activities  is  carried  out  and  related  reports  are  prepared  and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  every  quarter  and  uploaded  onto  the  Government  website \nwithin  two  weeks  of  their  submission  until  the  affected  people  have  been \nresettled and their income restored. \n\n(iii) \n\nSocial  protection.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contracts \nunder  the  Project  incorporate  provisions  and  budgets  to  the  effect  that \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n19 \n\ncontractors:  (a)  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  labor  laws  and  applicable \ninternational  treaty  obligations  and  do  not  employ  child  labor;  (b)  provide  safe \nworking  conditions  and  water  and  sanitation  facilities  for  male  and  female \nworkers; (c) provide equal wages to male and female workers for work of equal \nvalue;  (d)  provide  day-care  services  for  child-care  needs  of  the  female \nconstruction  workers;  and  (e)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \neducation  and  awareness  campaigns  in  the  construction  campsites  with  such \ncampaigns being held in coordination with the Government\u2019s programs and other \ninitiatives.  \n\nThe  Government  will  also  ensure  that,  prior  to  construction  of  the  community \ninfrastructure such as footbridges, pedestrian refuges and bus shelters under the \nProject,  DOH  carries  out  consultations  with  the  local  communities  concerned  to \nappropriately  identify  their  needs  and  determine  the  optional  location  of  such \ninfrastructure.  \n\nGender.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Gender  Strategy  provided  in  the \nResettlement  Plan  and  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  prepared  for \nthe  Project  are  undertaken  to  maximize  Project  benefits  to  women.  The \nGovernment will (a) develop disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender and \nethnic  group  for  purposes  of  monitoring  and  reporting;  and  (b)  conduct  gender \nsensitization  training  on  gender  and  resettlement  for  its  staff  concerned.  Where \nland  is  granted  to  affected  people  for  compensation  purposes,  the  Government \nand DOH will, when applicable, ensure joint registration of land or land use rights \nin the names of both the husband and wife.  \n\nthe  requirements  of \n\nEnvironment.  The Government will ensure that: (a) the Project is implemented \nin  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  on  environment,  as \nwell as ADB's Environment Policy (2002), and that there is no significant damage \nto the natural environment as a result of the design, construction, operation and \nmaintenance  of  the  Project  facilities.  If  there  is  any  discrepancy  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB's  environment  policy,  the  ADB \npolicy  requirements  will  apply;  (b)  the  civil  works  contracts  under  the  Project \ninclude specific measures to mitigate negative environmental impacts caused by \nthe  construction  activities \nthe \nin  accordance  with \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  prepared  for  the  Project,  and  the  EMP \nwill  be  included  in  the  bidding  documents  as  a  basis  for  the  contractors  to \nprepare  site  specific  EMPs;  (c)  adequate  budget  and  staff  resources  are \nallocated for the EMP implementation; (d) the contractors engaged under the civil \nworks contracts are in strict compliance with all environmental impact mitigation \nand  monitoring  requirements  set  out  in  the  EMP  and  contract  documents;  (e) \nquarterly  progress  reports  cover  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  include \nupdates  on  the  development  and  implementation  of  mitigation  measures, \nincluding  any  approved  changes  to  the  EMP;  and  (f)  in  case  of  any  future \nsubstantial  changes \nthat  may  cause  significant \nenvironmental  impact,  if  required,  additional  environmental  study  is  undertaken \nand  corresponding  approval \nthe  Office  of  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironmental  Policy  and  Planning  and  the  Environmental  National  Board  is \nobtained  in  a  timely  manner.  Such  changes  will  be  screened  for  environmental \nsignificance  and  determination  of  the  environmental  category  as  per  the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. The respective environmental impact \n\nthe  Project  design \n\nfrom \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nassessment \n(IEE)/summary IEE will be submitted to ADB for evaluation. \n\n(EIA)/summary  EIA  or \n\ninitial  environmental  examination \n\n(vii)  Award  of  civil  works  contracts.  The  DOH  will  not  award  any  civil  works \ncontract  related  to  Sections  2,  3,  and  4  of  Highway  12  in  the  procurement  plan \nuntil  all  necessary  environmental  approvals  for  the  site  (or  sites)  have  been \nobtained.    \n\n(viii)  Commencement  of  civil  works.  The  DOH  will  not  issue  any  notice  to \nthe  approved  updated \nfor  any  section  until:  (a) \ncommence  civil  works \nresettlement  plan  has  been  implemented  and  the  section  is  clear  of  all \nencumbrances; and (b) the respective EMP for such section has been submitted \nto, and been approved by, ADB.  \n\n \n(ix) \n\nOperation and maintenance of project facilities. The DOH will be responsible \nfor  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  facilities  by  providing  proper \ntechnical  supervision  and  ensuring  adequate  fund  allocation.  The  Government \nwill  ensure  that  adequate  budget  is  requested  and  made  available  annually  for \nthe  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  facilities  during  and  after  the \nProject. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n58. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$77,100,000 to the Kingdom of Thailand for the Greater Mekong Subregion Highway Expansion \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  15  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n20 November 2009 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nIncreased \ncompetitiveness of \nlocal economy in the  \nprovinces along EWEC \nand SEC in Thailand \n\nOutcome \nA more efficient and \nsafer EWEC and SEC \nin Thailand  \n \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \nBy 2018 compared to the \nbaseline data of 2010: \n \nGDP increased by 20% in the \nprovinces in which project \nhighways are expanded and \nintercity motorways are \nconstructed \n \nValue of cross-border trade \ncarried by road transport with \nother GMS countries along the \nEWEC and SEC increased by \n20%  \n\n \nBy 2015 compared to the \nbaseline data of 2010: \n \nPassenger and freight operating \ncosts reduced by an average of \n10% in real terms  \n \nTravel times reduced by 15%  \n \nTraffic volume along project \nroads increased by 5%  \n \nFatalities caused by traffic \naccidents reduced by about 40%  \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\n \nAssumptions and Risks  \n\nAssumptions \nComplementary investments \nare made in the linked road \nsystem \n \nThailand remains \ninternationally competitive, \nand continues to attract \nforeign direct investment \n \nRisk \nImproper operation and \nmaintenance of the project \nhighways and intercity \nmotorways \n\nAssumptions \nEconomy of Thailand keeps \ngrowing   \n \nThe GMS cross-border \ntransport agreement is \nimplemented along the \nEWEC and SEC \n \nFinanciers to construct \nintercity motorway are \nidentified  \n \nRisk \nGovernment fails to endorse \nor take action on \nrecommendations of TA for \nthe implementation plan for \nthe Strategic Intercity \nMotorway Network \n \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\n \nAnnual provincial and \nnational statistical reports for \nmanufactured goods  \n \nField surveys and interviews \nof road transport operators \nand road users undertaken \nby the DOH \n \nDOH annual reports \nAnnual import and export \nstatistics prepared by  \n \nDepartment of Customs \nProject performance \nmonitoring surveys \n\n \nDOH measurements of \ntraffic and transport cost \ndata \n \nProvincial and national \nstatistical reports  \n \nPolice department accident \nstatistics \n \nField surveys and interviews \nof road transport operators \nand road users by the DOH \n \nDOH periodic traffic counts \nDOH district office reports \nand surveys \n \nResults of the Cabinet \nresolution on the intercity \nmotorway implementation \nplan \n \nProject performance \nmonitoring surveys \n\nOutputs  \n1.

In  1992,  with  the \nassistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the six countries entered into a program of \nsubregional  economic  cooperation.  The  ultimate  objective  of  the  program  is  to  facilitate \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  to  improve  the  standard  of  living  of  the  people  in  the \nsubregion.  The  program  has  contributed  to  the  development  of  infrastructure  to  enable  the \ndevelopment and sharing of the resource base, and to promote a freer flow of goods and people \nin  the  subregion.  ADB\u2019s  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  update  for  the  GMS 1  \nincludes  four  strategic  pillars,  the  first  of  which  addresses  strengthening  connectivity  and \nfacilitating  cross-border  movement  and  tourism.  The  high  priority  given  to  cooperation  in  the \ntransport sector is because of the poor state of the transport infrastructure in most of the GMS, \nwhich  is  a  major  constraint  to  economic  growth,  trade,  and  other  forms  of  cooperation.  Most \nfreight  and  passengers  moved  through  the  GMS  by  road.  Although  subregional  traffic  is  still \nmodest relative to domestic traffic, the governments of the GMS countries give high priority to \nthe  development  of  transport  infrastructure  links  that  will  facilitate  regional  and  international \ntrade  and  economic  cooperation,  especially  when  such  transport  facilities  also  serve  their \nrespective domestic needs.  \n \ntransport  sector  have  been: \n2. \n(i) developing the north\u2013south corridor from Kunming in Yunnan Province of the PRC to Ho Chi \nMinh  City  in  the  southern  part  of  Viet  Nam,  and  the  east\u2013west  corridor  from  Thailand  and  the \ncentral  coast  of  Viet  Nam  through  Lao  PDR;  (ii) linking  the  capitals,  other  population  centers, \nand  major  tourist  destinations  in  the  subregion;  (iii) helping  develop  remote  and  low-income \nareas  traversed  by  subregional  road  projects  by  improving  access  to  markets,  and  social  and \neconomic  services;  (iv) providing  access  to  the  sea  for  landlocked  Lao  PDR,  and  alternative \naccess  to  seaports  for  such  areas  as  northeastern  Thailand  and  Yunnan  Province;  and \n(v) reducing, with the objective of eliminating, nonphysical barriers (such as regulations covering \nborder crossings) to the movement of people and goods in the subregion.  \n \n3. \nTo  help  accelerate  subregional  economic  cooperation  the  GMS  countries  adopted  the \neconomic  corridor  approach  to  subregional  development  during  the  Eighth  GMS  Ministerial \nMeeting  held  in  Manila,  Philippines  in  1998.  Three  priority  GMS  economic  corridors  were \nidentified  during  that  meeting:  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  (EWEC),  the  North\u2013South \nEconomic  Corridor,  and  the  Southern  Economic  Corridor  (SEC).  The  development  of  these \ncorridors was subsequently designated as flagship initiatives under the Ten-Year GMS Strategic \nFramework, which leaders of the GMS countries endorsed during the First GMS Summit held in \nPhnom  Penh,  Cambodia  in  2002.  At  the  Third  GMS  Summit  held  in  Vientiane,  Lao  PDR  in \nMarch  2008,  the  GMS  leaders  stressed  the  need  to  redouble  efforts  to  transform  transport \ncorridors  into  economic  corridors  to  maximize  benefits  from  improved  physical  connectivity  in \nthe subregion. GMS ministers reaffirmed this at their 15th meeting held in Cha-am, Thailand in \nJune 2009. \n \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2007\u20132009):  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion\u2013\n\nBeyond Borders. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nB. \n\nGreater Mekong Subregion Transport Sector Strategy \n\n4. \nThe  GMS  transport  sector  strategy  provides  a  framework  that  is  implemented  through \nindividual national strategies that often also involve subregional plans and agencies. Thus, each \nGMS member country has its own transport program developed for 5-year plans and as a basis \nfor year-to-year budgets. These programs are supported to varying degrees with sector policy \nstatements,  strategies,  objectives,  priorities,  and  individual  project  analyses.  The  programs \nincorporate  consideration  of  the  importance  of  undertaking  GMS-related  projects.  While  many \nregional and subregional cooperation groupings are involved in transport in the GMS, the GMS \nframework  allows  initiatives  to  be  endorsed  at  the  highest  levels  of  leadership.  The  GMS \nconcept has rapidly become an effective forum for international cooperation\u2014from the working \nlevel  to  the  heads  of  government  level.  This  has  provided  the  GMS  with  a  leading  role  in \ncoordinating projects and in developing strategy.  \n \nThe GMS transport sector strategy study2 financed by ADB identified five key goals for \n5. \ntransport:  (i) to  exploit  synergies  in  the  GMS  transport  system;  (ii) to  move  towards  an  open \nmarket  for  transport  services;  (iii) to  facilitate  economic  efficiency  to  reduce  transport  costs; \n(iv) to  complete  the  GMS  network  and  improve  links  with  South  Asia;  and  (v) to  encourage \nmultiple modes of transport. The GMS Highway Expansion Project will support these objectives \nby  upgrading  two  sections  of  the  Thai  road  system  in  two  of  the  GMS  corridors;  EWEC  and \nSEC.  \n \n6. \nThe GMS transport corridors include strategic roads in the national road networks, and \ninterconnections  between  these  national  transport  networks.  Generating  trade  and  efficiency \nbenefits  from  these  corridors  requires  that  the  underlying  national  networks  are  adequate  and \nefficient.  This  has  not  been  the  case  in  most  GMS  countries.  ADB  has  funded  GMS  transport \nsector  projects  in  four  of  the  six  member  countries,  as  listed  in  Appendix  3,  but  has  made  no \ncontribution  in  Thailand  or  in  Myanmar.  In  terms  of  investment  in  road  infrastructure,  the \nemphasis has been on the completion of \u201cmissing links\u201d in the corridors. Roads in Thailand have \nnot  been  a  high  priority  because  of  their  generally  good  design  standard  and  condition \ncompared with the other countries. Within Thailand, GMS corridor routes are developed as part \nof a wider program of road upgrading using domestic funding. Traffic on some sections of the \nGMS economic corridors in Thailand is increasing to levels where upgrading of these roads is \nnow required to prevent congestion. The combined impact of growing domestic traffic demand \nin Thailand and increasing cross-border traffic demand in step with rehabilitation and upgrading \nof the transport networks in the neighboring countries could soon exhaust the capacity of roads \nand  highways  in  Thailand.  Therefore,  road  network  capacity  in  the  GMS  corridors  must  be \nmanaged to avoid defeating the purpose of developing these corridors. \n\nC. \n\nThe Greater Mekong Subregion Cross-Border Transport Agreement \n\n7. \nThe  governments  in  the  six  GMS  member  countries  have  recognized  that  providing \nsubregional  physical  infrastructure  is  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient  condition  for  more \nconnectivity among the countries. Mitigating nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement \nof  goods  and  people  is  important  to  increase  efficiency,  reduce  costs,  and  maximize  the \neconomic  benefits  of  improved  subregional  transport  infrastructure.  In  1996,  ADB  provided \ntechnical assistance (TA) 3  to the six GMS countries to (i) identify and assess priority transport-\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2004.

Technical Assistance for the Mitigation of Nonphysical Barriers to Cross-Border Movement of Goods \n\n6195-REG). \n\nand People. Manila (TA 5686-REG). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\n \n\nrelated  cross-border  issues,  (ii)  assess  the  viability  of  existing  international  conventions  or \nagreements as possible \u201csolutions\u201d or \u201cresponses\u201d to the priority issues, (iii) identify and assess \nissues  that  existing  international  conventions  or  agreements  do  not  address,  and  (iv)  identify \nimplementation requirements for addressing priority issues. The findings of the TA showed that \nthe barriers to trade and the free movement of people between GMS countries were substantial. \nA number of nonphysical barriers impeding the free movement of vehicles, goods, and people \nacross  international  borders  in  the  subregion  were  identified,  including  (i)  restrictions  on  the \nentry  of  motor  vehicles,  often  causing  costly  and  time-consuming  transshipment;  (ii)  different \nstandards  pertaining  to  vehicle  size,  weight,  safety  requirements,  and  driver  qualifications;  (iii) \ninconsistent and difficult formalities related to customs procedures, inspections, clearances, and \nassessment of duties; and (iv) restrictive visa requirements.  \n \nBilateral  agreements  on  cross-border  movement  exist  between  many  GMS  members. \n8. \nHowever,  these  agreements  only  partly  address  critical  cross-border  facilitation  issues;  and \nhinder  transit  movement  of  vehicles,  goods,  and  people  to  third  countries.  In  addition,  the \nbilateral agreements between pairs of GMS countries are not necessarily consistent with each \nother  and  run  the  risk  of  having  gaps  and  overlaps,  thereby  making  transport  facilitation  even \nmore  difficult.  Therefore,  a  multilateral  framework  to  facilitate  the  cross-border  movement  of \ngoods  and  people  on  a  subregion-wide  and  consistent  basis  is  necessary  to  allow  both \ninterstate and transit traffic. \n \n9. \nThe  GMS  Cross-Border  Transport  Agreement  (CBTA)  is  a  multilateral  instrument \nadopted  by  all  GMS  members  to  facilitate  cross-border  transport  of  goods  and  people. \nFormulated  under  ADB-funded  TA, 4   the  CBTA  provides  a  practical  approach  to  streamline \nregulations  and  reduce  nonphysical  barriers  in  the  GMS  over  the  short  to  medium  term.  It \nincludes  measures  such  as  more  efficient  inspection  procedures  and  reciprocal  traffic \nregulations. The CBTA incorporates the principles of bilateral or multilateral action, and flexibility \nin recognizing differences in procedures in each of the GMS countries. It includes references to \ninternational conventions that have demonstrated their usefulness in a broad range of countries. \nThe CBTA also takes into account, and is consistent with, similar initiatives of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which five of the six GMS countries are members. In this \nregard, ADB consults and coordinates extensively with the United Nations Economic and Social \nCommission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  and  the  ASEAN  Secretariat to  ensure  the  consistency  of \nthe CBTA with international conventions and regional agreements. ADB has also consulted with \nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to learn from its experience in promoting \ncross-border land transport in Europe. \n \n10. \nThe  CBTA  became  effective  in  December  2003  with  its  ratification  by  all  six  GMS \nmember  countries.  The  20  implementing  annexes  of  the  CBTA  were  negotiated  during  2003\u2013\n2007,  and  all  six  GMS  countries  signed  them  by  March  2007.  Except  for  Myanmar  and \nThailand,  GMS  countries  have  ratified  all  20  annexes,  rendering  them  effective  among  them. \nWhile  countries  are  in  the  process  of  ratifying  the  20  annexes  and  protocols,  to  achieve  early \nresults in transport and trade facilitation, the countries agreed to implement the CBTA initially at \nseven key border crossings5 from the long list of designated border crossings in the CBTA.

However,  implementation  has  not  started,  as  the  two  countries  have  not  agreed  on  the \nestablishment  of  common  control  area  at  the  buffer  zone  of  the  borders.  Thailand  and \nCambodia  are  working  to  begin  bilateral  exchange  of  traffic  rights'  arrangements  through  the \nAranyaprathet\u2013Poipet border crossing based on an MOU signed by the two governments at the \nThird GMS Summit. At the border of Mukdahan (Thailand) with Savannakhet (Lao PDR) along \nthe EWEC, Thailand, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam signed an MOU in August 2007 to implement the \nexchange  of  traffic  rights'  provisions  of  the  CBTA  and  a  GMS  customs  transit  quarantine \nsystem; implementation of the MOU started in June 2009. ADB is providing assistance to these \ninitiatives through regional TA.6   \n \nKey  challenges  for  the  effective  implementation  of  the  CBTA  include  (i)  establishing \n11. \nefficient  management  systems  and  associated  capacity  building;  (ii)  streamlining  and \nharmonizing border control documents; (iii) preparing revised manuals of operation at the border \ncheckpoints  and  associated  training;  (iv)  establishing  required  infrastructure,  and,  in  some \ncases, relocating and/or modifying layouts of border checkpoints, as well as providing common \ncontrol  areas  to  allow  single-stop  inspection  and  single-window  inspection;  and  (v)  mitigating \nnegative  externalities  associated  with  increased  cross-border  movement.  The  CBTA  will  apply \nto  selected  and  mutually  agreed  upon  routes  and  points  of  entry  and  exit  in  the  signatory \ncountries.  \n \n12. \nAn ongoing diagnostic study has identified key issues that need to be addressed for the \ntimely,  effective,  and  sustainable  implementation  of  the  CBTA  and  other  transport  and  trade \nfacilitation (TTF) initiatives: (i) ratification of the CBTA and its annexes and protocols has taken \nlonger than expected, and ratification does not mean implementation in most GMS countries; (ii) \na  strategic  and  integrated  approach  to  TTF  is  needed;  (iii)  institutional  arrangements  are \ninsufficient  to  allow  sustainable  and  effective  coordination;  (iv)  border  checkpoints  and  other \nrelated  infrastructure  remain  a  constraint;  (v)  there  is  a  need  to  focus  on  results  and  ensure \ncoordination; and (vi) the private sector's awareness of and involvement in the CBTA have been \ninsufficient.  Based  on  this  study,  a  strategy  and  work  program  for  the  timely  and  effective \nimplementation  of  the  TTF  initiatives,  including  the  CBTA,  has  been  proposed.  A  single, \nintegrated TTF project, under one management or specialist team, has been identified with 11 \ncomponents  and  subprojects  (clusters  of  related  activities)  covering  transport  facilitation, \ncustoms, sanitary and phytosanitary inspection, support to TTF institutions, trade logistics, and \nestablishment of a GMS freight transport association. \n\nD. \n\nEconomic Corridor Development \n\n13. \nThe role of economic corridors in GMS development is reflected in the Joint Statement \nof the Eighth GMS Ministerial Meeting in 1998. It stated that \u201cGMS member countries will create \neconomic corridors linking the subregion to major markets; nodal points within these economic \ncorridors  will  serve  as  centers  for  enterprise  development;  economic  corridors  will  be  an \nexpansion  of  key  transport  corridors  so  as  to  enhance  economic  activities  and  benefits,  and \nover the longer term to build on the potential of the subregion as a land bridge serving the PRC, \nSoutheast Asia, South Asia and East Asia.\u201d7 \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  for  Enhancing  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  in  the  GMS.  Manila  (TA  6450-\n\n7  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/Mekong/Proceedings/min8_app4.asp \n\nREG). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n \n\n14. \nConceptually,  GMS  economic  corridor  development  involves  a  holistic,  multisector \napproach,  where  infrastructure  development  is  linked  with  trade,  investment,  and  other \neconomic, social, and environmental opportunities. The development of economic corridors8 is \nexpected  to  help  in  achieving  the  vision  of  the  GMS  as  a  prosperous,  harmonious,  and \nintegrated  subregion  through  more  connectivity,  enhanced  competitiveness,  and  a  greater \nsense of community. It supports the strategic thrusts of the GMS 10-Year Strategic Framework: \n(i) strengthening infrastructure links; (ii) facilitating cross-border trade, investment, and tourism; \n(iii) enhancing private sector participation and competitiveness; (iv) protecting the environment \nand  promoting  sustainable  use  of  shared  natural  resources;  and  (v)  developing  human \nresources and skills competencies. From a broader perspective, the development  of the GMS \neconomic corridors offers a means for the less-developed member countries of ASEAN to catch \nup  with  the  more  economically  advanced  member  countries,  and  to  reinforce  the  market \nintegration process that is increasing in East Asia. \n \n15. \nOperationally,  the  economic  corridor  approach  aims  to  (i)  extend  the  benefits  of \nimproved  transport  links  to  remote  and  landlocked  locations  in  the  GMS,  which  have  been \ndisadvantaged by their lack of integration with more prosperous and better-located neighboring \nareas;  (ii)  provide  a  spatial  focus  to  GMS  activities,  with  the  backbone,  growth  centers,  and \nnodal points serving as catalysts for the development of surrounding areas; (iii) open up many \nopportunities  for  investments  from  within  and  outside  the  GMS;  (iv)  enhance  the  impact  of \nsubregional activities through the clustering of projects; (v) serve as a mechanism for prioritizing \nand  coordinating  investments  among  neighboring  countries;  and  (vi)  generate  tangible \ndemonstration effects. \n \nE. \n \n16. \nOn most roads, cross-border traffic is a fraction of domestic traffic, but its share of total \ntraffic is increasing. Passenger traffic has grown as a result of increased domestic demand and \ntourism, while commodity trade between the GMS countries has grown more quickly than trade \nin  general.  In  1992,  about  5.7%  of  total  GMS  country  trade  was  between  GMS  countries;  by \n2003, it had risen to 12.0%, a period in which total trade grew rapidly. Within the GMS transport \nsector strategy study, a preliminary version of the GMS transport model (GTM) was developed \nto estimate traffic flows in the subregion to 2015. The analysis was based on both demand-side \nfactors  and  supply-side  issues.  Demand-side  factors  included  forecasts  of  key  economic  and \ndemographic factors: (i) gross domestic product (GDP), (ii) population, (iii) GDP per capita, (iv) \nexports,  (v)  imports,  and  (vi)  tourist  arrivals.  Supply-side  issues  included  infrastructure  and \npolicy. Therefore, the GTM enabled the assessment of the impact of changes in, for example, \nroad  condition  or  faster  border  procedures.  The  GTM  needs  further  work  before  it  is  accurate \nenough  to  analyze  specific  subprojects,  but  the  traffic  flow  projections  indicate  that  the  GMS \nstrategy will lead to higher traffic levels on many routes.  \n \nA more recent study funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency,9 building on \n17. \nthe  GTM,  examined  five  scenarios  representing  a  range  of  improvements\u2014from  infrastructure \nimprovements in specific corridors to full implementation on the CBTA at all major border points \n\nImpact of Greater Mekong Subregion Strategy on Traffic Growth \n\n                                                 \n8   An economic corridor is not simply a connection between points A and B. The movement of people and goods can \noriginate from and end at any intermediate point between points A and B. The impact of an economic corridor also \ngoes beyond the main route or \u201cline.\u201d It extends to the areas that can be accessed, or areas whose access to major \neconomic centers could be improved through the connection between points A and B. \n\n9   Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  and  ALMEC  Corporation.  2007.

The report showed that substantial additional regional passenger \nand  freight  traffic  would  be  generated, 11   resulting  in  increases  in  gross  regional  domestic \nproduct12 in each of the GMS countries. The report also showed that increases in traffic levels \nwould be widespread, affecting all major routes in the national networks. However, the impact \nwould be most pronounced on the GMS corridors themselves and around the major population \ncenters.

The  Research  on  the  Cross-border  Transportation  Infrastructure: \nPhase 2 - Final Report. Tokyo (Tables 6.6.1\u20136.6.3). \n \n18. \nEvidence  suggests  that  by  stimulating  economic  diversification  and  improving  cross-\nborder traffic flows and facilities, the GMS strategy has already led to an increase in subregional \nflows of passengers and freight traffic. Of significance for this Project, the traffic count results for \nrecent  years  show  rapid  growth  in  traffic  on  the  project  section  nearest  international  borders. \nTraffic  volume  on  the  Phanom  Sarakham\u2013Sa  Kaeo  section  doubled  between  2003  and  2007. \nTherefore,  the  Project  is  seen  in  terms  of  providing  adequate  road  standards  for  traffic  levels \nthat are projected to rise as a result of the generally improved connectivity along the corridors, \nrather than the Project itself directly stimulating economic growth and traffic flows.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n10  There are 40 class I cross-border points between GMS countries where people and goods traffic between the two \n\nbordering countries, as well as traffic from third countries, is allowed to pass through. \n\n11  In  the  report,  the  additional  traffic  generated  is  estimated  at  the  sum  of  traffic  generated  in  (or  attracted  to)  one \n\nGMS country that was attracted to (or generated in) all other countries. \n\n12  Gross regional domestic product is estimated at the sum of economic activity in the country, stemming from cross-\n\nborder traffic. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION \nSector: Transport, Information and Communication Technology Sector \nThemes: Economic Growth, Private Sector Development, and Regional Cooperation  \n\nMajor Development Partners \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe last road sector project in Thailand financed by an ADB loan was approved in 1995 \nand  completed  in  2004.

JICA's  assistance  to  Thailand  in  the \ntransport  sector  is  linked  to  the  promotion  of  regional  cooperation  for  the  development  of \nneighboring  countries.  The  Second  Mekong  International  Bridge,  completed  in  2006,  is  an \nintegral part of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) East\u2013West Economic Corridor. JICA does \nnot  provide  financial  support  for  road  projects  in  Thailand  at  present,  but  JICA  is  providing  a \nloan to construct a mass rapid transit system aiming to alleviate traffic congestion, and improve \nthe urban environment in the Bangkok metropolitan area.   \n \n3. \nWorld Bank. The World Bank provided a loan for the Highways Management project in \n2004. The development objective of the project is to enhance the efficiency, productive use, and \nthe \nroad  network.  Specifically, \nmanagement  of  Thailand's \ncommercialization of the road sector, strengthens the operations of the Department of Highways \n(DOH), helps preserve road assets, and improves competition and transparency in the award of \ncontracts.  The  project  has  four  components:  (i)  highway  rehabilitation  and  maintenance,  (ii) \nhighway  upgrading  and  intersection  improvement,  (iii)  road  safety  improvement,  and  (iv) \ninstitutional  strengthening.  The  fourth  component  includes  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the \ndevelopment of a framework for and a case study on public\u2013private partnerships in highways.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe Ministry of Finance in Thailand requested ADB and the World Bank to jointly assist \nin financing the DOH Four-Lane Highway Widening Project (Phase II) to upgrade about 433 km \nof  eight  national  highway  sections  from  a  two-lane  highway  standard  to  a  four-lane  divided \nhighway  standard.  ADB  will  provide  funding  for  two  sections  on  the  East\u2013West  and  Southern \nEconomic  Corridors,  the  World  Bank  will  provide  funding  for  five  sections,  and  the  DOH  will \n\nDevelopment Partner Coordination \n\nthe  project  supports \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nfinance one section. While ADB and the World Bank have prepared separate projects to cover \ntheir respective sections, the institutions have cooperated closely with each other to harmonize \nand standardize documentation and procedures, to the extent possible. \n \nOver  the  past  10  years,  the  Government's  highway  subsector  strategy  has  focused  on \n5. \nmaking  national  highways  four  lanes.  However,  during  this  period,  intercity  motorways  or \nadditional  expressways  in  the  vicinity  of  Bangkok  have  not  been  emphasized,  and  a  coherent \npublic investment plan for intercity motorways does not exist. The World Bank-financed TA for \nthe  DOH  provided  recommendations  for  private  sector  participation  in  financing,  construction, \noperations, and maintenance activities of intercity motorways, and also provided documentation \nfor procurement of the Bang Pa-In to Nakhon Ratchasima Motorway.  \n \nADB's  TA  study  under  the  GMS  Highway  Expansion  Project  will  build  upon  the  World \n6. \nBank's TA and concentrate on three motorway links: (i) Chonburi to Map Ta Put, including an \naccess  link  to  Laem  Chabang  Port;  (ii)  Bang  Yai  to  Nakhon  Pathom  (Bang  Pong)  to  Cha-am; \nand (iii) Nakhon Pathom to Kanchanaburi. ADB's TA study will provide the Government with a \nimplementation \ndetailed \narrangements  using  an  appropriate  public\u2013private  partnership  model.  Through  the  respective \nloan  projects  and  TAs,  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  will  continue  to  work  closely  together  on \nimproving Thailand's capacity to structure public\u2013private partnerships in the road subsector. \n \n7. \nIn  the  context  of  development  partner  coordination  at  the  subregional  level  under  the \nGMS program, the Government of Thailand has taken steps to develop the GMS North\u2013South \nand  Southern  Economic  Corridors,  and  facilitate  cross-border  operations.  The  GMS  Highway \nExpansion  Project  is  the  first  loan  project  for  Thailand  under  the  GMS  program.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Project is not directly linked to Thailand\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy, but rather to Thailand\u2019s desire to deepen \npartnerships  with  its  neighbors.  It  reflects  a  strong  appreciation  that  inclusive  and  sustainable  development  in  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS)  brings  growth  and  stability  to  Thailand.  Similarly,  if  Thailand\u2019s  economy  is  strong,  this  will \ncontribute to growth, development, and poverty reduction in neighboring countries. As a middle-income country, Thailand is \nalso expected to assume a leadership role in maintaining and providing regional public goods, and in addressing cross-border \nissues such as environmental management, the trafficking of drugs and people, and the control of communicable diseases. In \nline  with  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  8  (Global  Partnerships),  these  economic,  social,  and  environmental \ninterdependencies  highlight  the  importance  of  strengthening  Thailand\u2019s  role,  capacity,  and  effectiveness  as  a  development \npartner. \n \nThailand  plays  a  crucial  role  in  realizing  the  four  major  areas  of  the  GMS  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  by  (i) \nstrengthening  connectivity  and  facilitating  cross-border  movement  and  tourism;  (ii)  integrating  national  markets  to  promote \neconomic efficiency and private sector development; (iii) addressing health and other social, economic, and capacity building \nissues  associated  with  subregional  links;  and  (iv)  managing  the  environment  and  shared  natural  resources,  especially \nwatershed systems of the Mekong River. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                          Targeting Classification:  General intervention  \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe  gross  provincial  product  (GPP)  of  the  project  provinces  reflects  the  fundamentally  different  levels  of  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  provinces  within  the  project  area.  Of  the  project  provinces,  the  province  with  the  highest  GPP  is \nChachoengsao  at  B160,511,000,  which  makes  it  the  seventh-largest  province  in  terms  of  GPP  in  Thailand.  This  is  not \nsurprising  because it is  one of the five provinces contiguous  with the greater Bangkok area. The province  with the  second-\nhighest  GPP  is  Khon  Kaen  at  B92,081,000,  followed  by  Prachin  Buri  at  B62,164,000,  Phitsanulok  at  B40,146,000,  and \nPhetchabun  at  B39,816,000.  However,  much  of  the  economic  development  takes  place  around  the  major  cities,  including \nKhon Kaen (the major center for economic  development on  the East\u2013West Economic  Corridor), Phitsanulok, and  along the \nSouthern Corridor in Chachoengsao and Prachin Buri. \n \nThe Project has not been designed specifically reduce poverty. Thailand is the least poor of the GMS countries with an official \npoverty  headcount  ratio  of  8%  in  2007  based  on  B1,386  per  capita  per  month.  In  northern  Thailand,  where  Highway  12 \ntraverses, the poverty rate is 12%; and in central Thailand, where Highway 359 traverses, the poverty rate is 3%. However, \naccording to the data collected during project preparation, using poverty lines specific to each of the impacted provinces, the \npoverty rates range from a high of 20.4% in Phetchabun (Highway 12) to a low of 3.2% in Chachoengsao (Highway 359). The \npoverty rates  in the major cities are  as follows: 9.0% in Khon Kaen (Highway  12), 12.0% in Phitsanulok (Highway 12), and \n13.8%  in  Sa  Kaeo  (Highway  359).  Nevertheless,  all  of  the  project  areas  stand  out  as  being  considerably  more  developed \nsocially and economically than elsewhere in the GMS, although levels of inequality are greater than in neighboring Lao PDR, \nViet Nam, and southwestern People's Republic of China (PRC). \n \nThe economic rationale underlying the widening of these GMS corridor highways to four lanes is that they will reduce the cost \nof delays for passenger and freight traffic. The lower costs for freight traffic will reduce the costs for goods consumed in the \nlocal market and will improve the competitive advantage of producers. New economic activity along all corridors could create \njobs for the poor.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \nThe Project does not include pro-poor design, although some potential exists for the local hire of daily wage labor for some of \nthe construction activities. \n \nC.   Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nNot Applicable. \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.   Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe social and poverty analysis was conducted to assess the social and poverty impacts of this Project on people living in the \nprovinces  in  northern  and  eastern  Thailand  where  the  two  highways  traverse.  The  economy  in  the  project  area  depends \nmainly on agriculture and natural resources. The project area does not have any legal commercial forestry, as the forests of \nwere almost completely logged out long ago. Access to forests to collect non-timber forest products is circumscribed, although \npermitted in some instances. Shrimp and prawn farming are relatively important in Chachoengsao because of its proximity to \nthe  Gulf  of  Thailand,  but  not  in  other  provinces.  Areas  that  have  access  to  year-round  sources  of  water  have  some  small-\nscale aquaculture, but such areas are few. Livestock-rearing is important in the project area. Elsewhere, project area shows \nlittle  evidence  of  contract  farming,  except  perhaps  among  vegetable  growers  such  as  the  Hmong,  who  provide  a  range  of \ncool-weather  vegetables  (e.g.,  peas,  beans,  and  broccoli)  to  high-end  supermarkets  in  Thailand.  However,  with  the \nestablishment of biofuel factories to extract the juice of sugarcane for use in vehicles, some form of contract-based sugarcane \nfarming is likely, because these factories require a guaranteed supply of harvested sugarcane. Apart from the manufacture of \npulp and paper products and biofuels, the project area has little real manufacturing. However, there are many examples and \nsmall amounts of products being manufactured locally. Service industries are well developed in the major provincial centers, \nalthough  Khon  Kaen  is  the  most  developed  in  terms  of  education  and  health  care.  Other  sectors,  such  as  tourism,  are  not \nvery well developed in the project area, except in Phetchabun. Better roads in the project area will facilitate travel to popular \ntourist  destinations,  and  it  is  assumed  that  local  business  will  benefit  as  well  because  of  increased  traffic.  In  general,  the \nproject  area  offers  fewer  jobs  outside  agriculture  than  in  other  more  economically  diversified  provinces  of  Thailand.  School \ncompletion rates are typically lower in the project area than elsewhere in Thailand. Thus, the project area has fewer formally \nwell-educated people than in the main centers of Thailand\u2019s economic development.   \n \nAlthough the Project is not explicitly linked to poverty reduction issues, it does have some positive impacts relating to poverty \nreduction, including (i) agriculture-based income-generation activities (e.g., the ability to meet unmet demand for pork, beef, \nand chicken products in other GMS countries, especially the PRC; and importing sugarcane and cassava from the Lao PDR \nfor value-adding into bio-fuels), resulting in the generation of more jobs, and  widening highways to four lanes also makes it \neasier  for  poor  farmers  to  transport  crops  such  as  sugarcane  and  cassava  to  biofuel  processing  plants  in  northeastern \nThailand; and (ii) anticipated growth in domestic, regional, and international tourism, especially enabling regional tourists from \nother  GMS  countries  to  visit  this  part  of  Thailand  rather  than  flying  directly  into  the  major  tourist  areas  in  Thailand  such  as \nBangkok,  Chiang  Mai,  and  Chiang  Rai,  and  for  poorer  people  the  existing  forms  of  agro-tourism  (including  farm  stays) \nincrease  the  possibilities  for  non-farm-based  livelihood  opportunities.  Other  positive  impacts  include  the  (i)  greater \ndevelopment  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  especially  with  the  bridging  finance  afforded  when  activities  can  be \nlinked  to  Thailand\u2019s  One-Tambon  (subdistricts),  One-Product  program;  (ii)  revitalization  of  local  culture  and  preservation  of \ntraditional  skills,  including  dance,  music,  embroidery,  and  silk-weaving;  and,  (iii)  promotion  of  greater  regional  cultural \nunderstanding  in  a  region  where  it  has  taken  more  than  4  decades  to  transcend  lingering  cultural  doubts  about  GMS \nneighbors. \n \nThe  main  social  and  livelihood  impacts  of  the  Project  are  related  to  temporary  loss  of  stallholders\u2019  incomes,  increase  in \nsexually  transmitted  infections  including  HIV/AIDS,  possible  increase  in  people  trafficking,  possible  increase  in  drug \ntrafficking, depletion of common property resources, and an increased risk of road accidents.  \n \nNegative resettlement impacts have been mitigated in the resettlement plan prepared for the Project. To meet the challenge \nof an increase in sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS that can be directly linked to construction-based activities, \na  number  of  mitigation  measures  have  been  included.  The  HIV  awareness  campaign  will  include  the  distribution  of  free \ncondoms to targeted groups, advice on access to testing and treatment for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, and \nincreasing  awareness  of  behavior  that  increases  risks.  Awareness  activities  will  also  address  human  trafficking,  including \ncapacity  building  of  the  Executing  Agency,  awareness  on  safe  migration,  and  community  monitoring.  In  the  schools  and \ntemples  of  local  communities,  the  Project  will  support  measures  to  reinforce  awareness  of  the  negative  impacts  of  people \ntrafficking.  Consultations  with  a  range  of  local  experts  (including  law  enforcement  officials)  strongly  suggested  that  there  is \nlittle causal relationship between making these highways four lanes and an increase in people trafficking or drug trafficking. A \nroad safety awareness program will address risks of increased traffic accidents. The environment management plan includes \nmeasures to address dust- and pollution-related issues. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultation  meetings  were  held  with  project-affected  people  to  discuss  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  resettlement  and \nenvironmental impacts. Meetings were held in all of the subdistricts within the project areas, and the results of these meetings \nwere  incorporated  into  the  project  resettlement  plan,  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  environmental  management \nplan. \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n\n    \n\nDuring project construction, consultation will continue during updating and implementation of the resettlement plan. A series of \nconsultations with affected people will be held during the detailed measurement survey.  \n \nTo  minimize  the  risk  of  the  highways  dividing  local  communities  by  disrupting  existing  local  road  communications,  the \nDepartment  of  Highways  has  already  discussed  with  local  communities  construction  of  highway-crossing  facilities  including \nunderpasses and overpasses. The need for and location of these facilities will be confirmed during the detailed engineering \ndesign. Planning for community infrastructure will be through local committees; membership of these committees will consist \nof  representatives  of  the  District  Highway  Office,  project  consultants,  and  representatives  of  the  local  communities.  Local \ncommunities  will  be  consulted  to  determine  the  maximum  distance  between  facilities  to  cross  the  highways\u2014by  either \noverpasses  or  underpasses\u2014to  avoid  the  disruption  of  livelihood  and  social  networks  and  the  existing  local  road  system. \nCommunity consultations will be facilitated by the construction supervision consultant\u2019s team.  \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nA separate C&P plan is not required. Consultation and participatory processes have been mainstreamed in relevant project \ncomponents and documents such as the resettlement plan and environmental impact assessment. The resettlement plan and \nenvironmental impact assessment report include appendixes on the consultation process.  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues. \nThe Project will improve sections of the highway network. Project impacts relate to (i) increased risks of exposure to HIV/AIDS \nand trafficking of women and children during construction and the post-construction phase because of large volumes of transit \ntraffic along the road; and (ii) poor women in the project area more at risk economically (loss of productive assets because of \nconstruction  work)  and  socially  (risks  posed  by  HIV/AIDS,  road  safety,  and  possible  human  trafficking)  than  males.  On  the \nother  hand,  the  Project  can  create  jobs  for  poor  women  during  construction.  The  negative  impacts  relating  to  resettlement, \nHIV/AIDS,  and  human  trafficking  will  be  addressed  through  a  gender  strategy  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevention of human trafficking awareness program.  \n\n \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n2.  Key Actions. \n \nA  project-specific  gender  strategy  has  been  prepared  and  has  been  included  in  the  resettlement  plan.  An  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman trafficking awareness program will target women.  \n \nThe gender strategy includes the following specific activities to ensure project benefits for women:  \n\n  Other actions/measures  \n\n No action/measure      \n\nConsultation  meeting  on  resettlement  activities  will  be  held  separately  with  women,  households  headed  by \nfemales, and elderly women.  \nAt the inception of the Project, community-level meeting will be held with the affected households to orient them \nabout resettlement activities. Participation of poor women, households headed by females, and ethnic minorities \n(if any) in the meeting will be ensured.  \nThe inception meeting will provide information on resettlement activities, compensation, grievance procedures, \nand  potential  impacts  of  the  Project  on  livelihood  activities  related  to  loss  of  agricultural  produce,  and  other \nproductive  assets.  The  objective  of  the  meeting  is  to  provide  affected  communities  with  understanding  of \nresettlement issues and better access to compensation resources and information on grievance procedures. \nDuring preparation of the detailed measurement survey (DMS), men and women from affected households will \nparticipate in the preparation of the DMS. \nLocal level committees for community infrastructure will include women from the community to plan community \ninfrastructure activities. \nIf compensation is to be paid, it will be given to both men and women from the households. Specific attention will \nbe provided for households headed by poor  women or elderly  women to ensure that compensation is  paid on \ntime. \nRelocation  of  houses  will  include  separate  discussions  with  women  from  affected  households,  households \nheaded by females, elderly women, and ethnic minority households (if any).  \nThe Department of Highways will conduct an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness campaign during the \nconstruction and post construction phases. The provision of educational materials, workshop, and campaigns on \nHIV/AIDS and a human trafficking prevention program will be conducted separately for women. \nAll employment for the Project will respect the Government\u2019s commitments to gender equity, including staffing in \nthe  project  implementation  unit  and  resettlement  committees.  Construction  contractors  will  ensure  that  (a)  no \nchild labor will be used; (b) men and women are paid equally for work for equal value; (c)  basic facilities (water \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n(xiii) \n\n(xiv) \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n35 \n\nand sanitation) for men and women workers are provided in the construction camps; (d) separate bathing and \ntoilet  facilities  are  provided  for  women  workers;  and  (e)  day  care  services  will  be  provided  for  the  children  of \nwomen construction workers.  \nDisaggregated  monitoring  indicators  by  gender  will  be  developed  for  monitoring  of  social  benefits,  economic \nopportunities,  livelihood  program,  road  safety,  resettlement  activities,  HIV/AIDS,  and  human  trafficking \nprevention program. \nThe  monitoring  indicators  will  include  (a)  women's  participation  in  resettlement  committees,  capacity  building \ntraining, consultation meeting, livelihood training, and restoration of income; (b) recruitment of women laborers \nin construction, provision of separate bathing and toilet  facilities in the construction site, and child care facility in \nconstruction camp; and (c) participation of women in road safety awareness campaign.  \nWomen's and girls' awareness on safe migration, human trafficking, and HIV/AIDS will be enhanced.  \nThe project-specific gender strategy with be implanted by the Executing Agency in collaboration with the project \nconstruction supervision consultants.  \nNational consultants with expertise in social development and gender will be included in the consulting services \nfor  the  implementation  of  the  gender  strategy.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  social  development  and  gender  are \nincluded in consulting services. The budget to implement the gender strategy is included in the resettlement plan \nand  consulting  service  package.  The  social  development  and  gender  specialist  will  monitor  implementation  of \nthe gender strategy in various components of the Project. \n\n \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \nSignificant \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nA full resettlement plan has been \nprepared \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\nNo Impact \n\nNo ethnic minorities are affected \non Highway 12 and 359.  \n\nLabor \n\nNo Impact \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\nAffordability \n\nNo Impact \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \n\nHIV \nHuman trafficking \nDrug trafficking \n\nSignificant \n\nThe Project will not have direct \nimpact on labor retrenchment.

Works include new bridges and widening of existing bridges, reinforced concrete box \nand  pipe  culvert \nthe \nstrengthening  and  overlay  of  existing  pavement  sections.  In  addition,  roadway  safety \nimprovements,  such  as  provision  for  pedestrian  overpasses,  improved  signage  and  pavement \nmarkings, and pavement widening at bus stops, will be incorporated into the improvements. The \n178 km are along two sections of highways: (i) Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak (105 km) is on the GMS \nEast\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC); and (ii) Phanom Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo (73 km) is along \nthe GMS Southern Economic Corridor (SEC). \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  east\u2013west  alignment  of  the  Phitsanulok\u2013Lom  Sak  section  (Highway  12)  connects \ntwo of the primary north\u2013south corridors (Highways 11 and 21) in central-northern Thailand. It is \nthe  primary  road  connecting  two  of  the  richest  provinces  of  the  region,  Phitsanulok  and \nPhetchabun. The western end of the Phitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak section starts in the Nan river valley \nnear Wong Thong district, at an elevation of 50 meters and climbs more than 700 meters as it \ncrosses through a series of small mountain passes.1 It passes through Nakhon Thai and Khao \nKho districts, and then descends about 600 meters until it reaches the expansive Issan Plateau \nnear an elevation of 160 meters in Lom Sak district.   \n \n3. \nThe  horizontal  and  vertical  alignments  in  the  mountainous  terrain  are  often  severe, \nrequiring  significant  reductions  in  design  speed.  Many  of  these  sections  will  necessitate  large \nvolumes of civil works earthwork quantities to complete improvements to a four-lane standard. \nThe  existing  two-lane  road  is  centered  within  the  60-meter  right-of-way  (ROW),  and \nconsequently  little  of  the  existing  roadway  section  or  bridges  can  be  salvaged  during  the \nwidening  work.2  The  roadway  section  will  be  upgraded  within  the  limit  of  existing  ROW  to  the \nDepartment  of  Highways  (DOH)  four-lane  divided  class  standard,  i.e.,  traffic  lanes  3.5\u20134.0 \nmeters  wide,  outer  paved  shoulders  2.0\u20132.5  meters  wide,  and  inner  paved  shoulders  1.5\u20132.0 \nmeters  wide.  Construction  will  be  divided  into  five  contract  packages.  The  primary  civil  works \ncomprise  widening  of  embankments  and  cut  sections  to  accommodate  the  new  four-lane \nhighway;  construction  of  sub-base  and  base  courses,  and  asphaltic  concrete  pavements; \nreplacing  and  lengthening  of  existing  cross  drainage  structures.  The  works  also  include  a \nsignificant amount of erosion control and slope stabilization works (utilizing various geo-grid and \nreinforced earth slope protection techniques). The median width will vary greatly because of the \nroughness of the terrain, and the necessity to keep all limits of construction within the existing \nROW.  Medians  sections  include  a  9-meter  depressed  median  in  open,  flat  areas;  a  5.1-meter \nraised  median  with  street  lighting  in  more  built-up  areas;  and  a  3.8-meter  wide  median  with \nconcrete barrier. Six at-grade road intersections will be improved with channelization suitable for \nthe new four-lane highway. \n \n                                                 \n1   The alignment also passing along the northern edge of the Thung Salaeng Luang National Park. \n2   At  the  10  locations  requiring  bridge  improvements,  existing  bridges  at  seven  locations  will  be  demolished  and \nreplaced with new four-lane bridges, totaling 273 meters in length; and existing two-lane bridges will be salvaged at \nthree locations, and widened left and right to four lanes, with bridge work at these locations totaling 152 meters in \nlength. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n37 \n\nHighway 359 from Phanom Sarakham to Sa Kaeo \n\n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe Project, located at the eastern end of the Thai section of the SEC, passes through \nsections  of  three  provinces  of  eastern  Thailand:  Chachoengsao,  Prachin  Buri,  and  Sa  Kaeo. \nThe Project starts in Phanom Sarakham district at the junction with Highway 304, and passes \nthrough  4  rural  districts  until  reaching  Sa  Kaeo  district  just  west  of  the  provincial capital  of  Sa \nKaeo.  \n \n5. \nThe  road  section  traverses  flat  terrain  and  detailed  designs  for  horizontal  and  vertical \ngeometry  will  easily  be  within  allowable  DOH  criteria  for  four-lane  divided  class.  The  existing \ntwo-lane  construction  is  offset  within  the  60-meter  ROW,  which  will  greatly  facilitate  the \nwidening  to  four  lanes.  All  existing  two-lane  bridges  will  be  utilized,  and  nine  new  two-lane \nbridges  totaling  214  meters  in  length  will  be  constructed.  The  typical  roadway  section  for  this \nsubproject  will  be  upgraded  to  DOH  class,  i.e.,  traffic  lanes  3.5\u20134.0  meters  wide,  outer  paved \nshoulders  2.0\u20132.5  meters  wide,  and  inner  paved  shoulders  1.5\u20132.0  meters  wide.  The \nconstruction  will  be  divided  into  two  construction  packages.  The  primary  civil  works  comprise \nconstruction  of  new  embankments;  construction  of  sub-base  and  base  courses,  and  asphaltic \nconcrete  pavements;  and  improving  existing  cross  drainage.  A  typical  9  meters  depressed \nmedian will be used throughout. \n \n\n \n\n\f3\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n\ni\n\n \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A6.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n \n\n% of Total  \nBase Costs \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nTotal Cost  \nB million \n\nTotal Cost  \n$ Million \n\nInvestment Costsa \n  1.

The  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  the \nDepartment  of  Highways  (DOH).  The  DOH  intends  to  contract  with  an  international  consulting \nfirm  to  carry  out  construction  supervision  services  as  set  out  in  these  terms  of  reference.  The \nDOH established a project management unit and assigned a project director, a deputy project \ndirector, and an assistant project director to supervise and coordinate with the consulting firm.   \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  scope  of  the  construction  supervision  services  includes  (i)  assisting  the  DOH  with \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  Project;  (ii)  assisting  the  DOH  in  ensuring \ncompliance  with  the  environmental  guidelines  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and \nenvironmental  management  plans  of  the  Project;  (iii)  functioning  as  the  engineer  in \nadministering  all  civil  works  contracts  and  ensuring  completion  of  construction  of  the \ncomponents in accordance with the contract provisions; (iv) undertaking road safety audits and \nroad  safety  awareness  campaigns;  (v)  assisting  the  DOH  with  the  implementation  of  an \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  awareness  program  (HHTAP);  (vi)  upgrading  the  DOH's \ncomputerized  accounting  systems;  and  (vii)  establishing  a  project  performance  monitoring \nsystem. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe construction supervision services will be executed by an international consulting firm \nto  be  appointed  by  the  DOH  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nD. \n \n4. \nThe  DOH  updated  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  two  project  highway  sections.  The \nupdated resettlement plan provides project resettlement policy, project impacts, socioeconomic \nprofile of affected households, organizational framework, public consultation, grievance redress, \nmonitoring and evaluation, and cost and budget tables for each highway section. The consultant \nwill  monitor  implementation  of  the  updated  resettlement  plan  for  the  two  highway  sections.  In \naddition, the consultant will assist the DOH to implement procedures for (i) minimizing adverse \nsocial impacts from resettlement and loss of other assets; (ii) coordinating resettlement activities \non  the  two  highway  sections;  (iii)  ensuring  that  at  all  stages  of  resettlement  planning, \nmanagement and monitoring, and gender concerns are incorporated, including gender-specific \nconsultation  and  information  disclosure;  (iv)  tracking  compliance  with  project  policies;  and  (v) \nassisting in monitoring and implementing corrective actions and resolving grievances as may be \nrequired. \n \n5. \nThe consultant will undertake the following tasks for the two highway sections (i) monitor \nthe  inclusion  of  mitigation  actions  required  during  the  design  phase  and  as  defined  in  the \napproved  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE);  (ii)  prepare  site-specific  environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs), including an implementation schedule for environmental mitigation \nand monitoring activities recommended in the approved IEE\u2019s EMP; (iii) prepare an erosion and \n\nOutline Terms of Reference \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nsedimentation  control  plan;  (iv)  prepare  and  conduct  a  training  program  for  contractors  and \nDOH  staff  on  erosion  and  sedimentation  control;  and  water  quality  and  construction-related \nhazardous material use, handling, disposal and spill prevention and clean-up; (v) in coordination \nwith  the  Environmental  Group  of  the  DOH,  undertake  quarterly  monitoring  of  contractors\u2019 \nenvironmental  performance  in  terms  of  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and  conduct  of \nenvironmental  effects  monitoring  indicated  in  the  EMP;  (vi)  monitor  and  report  on  the \nenvironment impacts during construction, and recommend measures to improve the situation as \nrequired;  (vii)  review  the  results  of  environmental  effects  monitoring  conducted  by  contractors \nbefore  submission  to  the  DOH  and  ADB;  and  (viii)  prepare  quarterly  monitoring  reports  for \nsubmission to the DOH and ADB. \n \n6. \nThe  construction  supervision  will  be  carried  out  jointly  by  the  DOH  and  the  consultant.  \nThe project manager of the consultant will act as the engineer\u2019s representative for all civil works \ncontracts. The engineer\u2019s representative will implement the civil work contracts and ensure that \nthe works are constructed in accordance with its provisions. In addition to the project manager, \nthe  consultant  will  provide  an  area  engineer  for  each  of  the  two  highway  sections.  The  area \nengineers will work closely with and assist the resident engineers of the DOH. The consultant \nwill also provide monitoring and supervision specialists as numerated in this terms of reference. \nThe  DOH  will  provide  all  resident  engineers,  inspectors,  technicians,  surveyors,  and  support \nand administrative staff required to carry out daily construction supervision activities. In addition, \nthe consultants\u2019 responsibilities will include (i) preparation of formal contract documentation, (ii) \ncontract  administration,  and  (iii)  civil  works  progress  monitoring  by  using  the  critical  path \nanalysis for each civil works package. \n \nThe  consultant  will  undertake  road  safety  audits  for  the  highway  detailed  designs \n7. \nprepared  by  the  DOH  and  the  national  consultants  engaged  by  the  DOH  before  civil  works \nbegin,  and  will  recommend  the  need  for  additional  road  safety  structures.  In  addition,  the \nconsultant will undertake road safety audits for the improved four-lane highway before opening \nto the public traffic to confirm that road safety structures have been properly installed.  \n \n8. \nBefore  completion  of  the  civil  works,  the  consultant  will  carry  out  the  road  safety \nawareness  campaigns  so  that  road  users  who  are  accustomed  to  traveling  at  low  speeds  on \ntwo-lane  roads  may  become  familiar  with  the  proper  use  of  the  improved  four-lane  highways, \nreflecting  road  safety  issues  specific  for  the  project  sites  and  also  referring  to  the  ADB- \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Road Safety program.1 \n \nThe  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  addressing  overall  social  development,  poverty, \n9. \nethnic  minority,  and  gender  issues.  The  consultant  will  help  the  DOH  plan,  implement,  and \nmonitor the social dimension of the resettlement plan, including capacity development training, \nactivities  specific  to  ethnic  minorities,  overall  project-specific  gender  strategy,  and  community \nawareness of the HHTAP. The purpose of the HHTAP is to (i) raise public awareness, address \nthe risks, and highlight multisector roles and responsibilities for HIV/AIDS transmission among \nconstruction  contractors  and  workers,  sex  workers,  injecting  drug  users,  local  communities, \ntransport  service  providers  and  truck  drivers,  local  police  and  border  officers,  and  other  road \nusers; and (ii) increase awareness on the prevention of human trafficking. Experts engaged for \nthis  work  will  be  highly  experienced  in  social  analysis  and  in  monitoring  and  evaluating  such \nprograms and associated management monitoring and evaluating systems. The consultant will \nensure that the HHTAP components of the Project are effectively and efficiently implemented.  \n\n                                                 \n1 http://www.adb.org/Documents/Reports/Arrive-Alive/Action-Plans/action-plan-09-tha.pdf \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Facilities \n\n \n10. \nThe consultant will design and assist the financial and accounting section of the Bureau \nof  International  Cooperation  with  the  implementation  of  a  financial  control  and  computerized \naccounting  system.  The  system  will  be  compatible  with  the  financial  and  accounting \nrequirements  of  the  ADB.  The  work  will  also  include  the  purchase  and  delivery  of  certain \ncomputer hardware. The consultant is expected to use the national consultants to carry out this \npart of the services.  \n \nThe  consultant  will  implement  necessary  systems  and  programs  that  will  enable \n11. \nmonitoring  of  the  performance  with  regard  to  project  implementation  and  the  impact  and \noutcome  of  the  Project  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  In  support  of \nthese activities, the consultant will assist DOH in assembling appropriate data and carrying out \nadditional necessary socioeconomic and other baseline surveys.  \n \nE. \n \nThe consultant will establish a project field office headed by a full-time project manager. \n12. \nThe  DOH  will  approve  the  location  of  the  project  office.  In  addition,  the  DOH  will  provide  the \nconsultant  with  administrative  office  space  at  the  DOH  headquarters  in  Bangkok  to  closely \ncoordinate and liaise with the consultant. The consultant shall also establish field site offices for \neach the two project highway sections. The DOH will provide the space for two field site offices, \nincluding the provision of utilities, and site security. The consultant will provide office furnishings, \nequipment, and supplies. All required project vehicles for the consultant staff will be provided by \nthe consultant.   \n \nF. \n \n13. \nThe consultant will submit the following reports: (i) an inception report at the end of the \nfirst  month,  (ii)  monthly  progress  reports,  (iii)  quarterly  progress  reports,  (iv)  road  safety  audit \nreports,  (v)  quarterly  resettlement  monitoring  reports,  (vi)  project  performance  monitoring \nreports  for  the  baseline  survey  and  project  completion  survey,  and  (vii)  a  project  completion \nreport  at  the  end  of  the  consulting  services.  The  quarterly  resettlement  monitoring  reports  are \nuploaded  onto  the  Government  website  within  2  weeks  of  their  submission  to  ADB  until \nresettlement and income are restored. \n\nReports and Public Disclosure \n\n \n\nStaffing  \n\nG. \n \n14. \nThe consulting services will be implemented over 52 months, from January 2010 to April \n2014. About 65 person-months of input from international experts will be required in addition to \nabout 145 person-months from national experts to assist the international experts. Expertise will \nbe required in civil works contract management, highway construction, road safety, resettlement \nand  social  development,  HHTAP,  environmental  impacts  mitigation,  and  project  performance \nmonitoring.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR STRATEGIC INTERCITY MOTORWAY NETWORK \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  transport  sector  in  Thailand  is  significantly  more  developed  than  the  transport \nsectors in its neighboring countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion countries. The degree of \ndevelopment of the road subsector is particularly well advanced in Thailand. The road network \ncomprises  about  202,000  kilometers  (km),  of  which  51,500  km  is  classified  as  highways, \n150,000  km  are  rural  roads,  and  about  450  km  are  controlled  access  expressways  or \nmotorways.  The  Department  of  Highways  (DOH)  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  is  the \nprimary  government  agency  responsible  for  the  planning,  construction,  maintenance,  and \noperation of the road network in Thailand. It is also responsible for cooperation and coordination \nwith highway agencies in neighboring countries. \n \n2. \nIn April 1997, the Cabinet approved a 20-year intercity motorway network master plan, \nconsisting of 13 networks, totaling 4,150 km, with an estimated construction cost of B472 billion \nand  right-of-way  cost  of  B66  billion.  However,  the  Government's  highway  subsector  strategy \nsince  has  focused  on  widening  national  highways  to  four  lanes,  and  there  has  been  little \nemphasis on intercity motorways or additional expressways in the vicinity of Bangkok. Much of \nthe  planning  and  programming  of  the  ongoing  DOH  Four-Lane  Highway  Widening  Project \n(Phase II)1 takes adequate notice of the need to expand such improvements to connect with key \nborder road crossings with its neighbors, primarily with Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR)  and  Cambodia.  However,  a  coherent  public  investment  plan  with  regard  to  intercity \nmotorways does not appear to exist. \n \nB. \n \nThe  World  Bank's  Highways  Management  Project 2   included  a  recently  completed \n3. \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  component \nIt  provided \nrecommendations  to  implement  a  restructured  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in \nfinancing,  construction,  operations,  and  maintenance  activities.  The  draft  final  report,  in  three \nvolumes,3 was submitted in September 2008. This TA was been developed around three tasks:   \n\nWorld Bank's Precursor Study \n\nthat  was  prepared \n\nthe  DOH. \n\nfor \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nreview  and  study  existing  market  issues  and  regulatory  structures  for  the  Thai \nroad subsector (motorways, expressways, and highways); \n\nstudy and recommend  policy, legal, and regulatory framework to ensure a clear \nseparation  of  responsibilities  and  to  provide  effective  management  of  road \ninfrastructure, taking into account the current legislative regime and international \nbest practices; and to develop a program for increasing the institutional capacity \nof the DOH (or a successor agency, i.e., a new \"Roads Authority\"), which will be \nresponsible for managing public\u2013private partnership assets; and  \n\n(iii) \n\nprepare  a  preliminary  technical  and  financial  assessment  of  the  Bang  Pa-In  to \nNakhon  Ratchasima  Motorway,  as  a  case  study,  including  preparation  of  a \n\n                                                 \n1  The Four-Lane Highway Widening Project (Phase II) encompasses 4,366 km of widening at an estimated cost of \n\n$2.58 billion; Phase I was completed at a cost of $1.15 billion, covering 1,891 km. \n\n2  An $84.3 million loan; approved 9 December 2003 under the Streamlined Procedure; Washington, D.C.; with loan \n\neffectiveness extended to 30 June 2009. \n\n3  World Bank and Mott MacDonald (Thailand) Ltd. et al. 2007. Consulting Services for Framework and Case Study \nfor  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  In  Thailand's  Highway  Program.  Bangkok.  The  three  volumes  are  (i)  draft  final \nreport; (ii) draft public\u2013private partnership contract; and (iii) motorway assessment report. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nconcession  agreement  for  a  public\u2013private  partnership  to  finance,  implement, \nand operate the motorway. \n\nThe Government's Strategy  \n\n \n4. \nThe  two  investment  options  that  are  being  most  prominently  considered  are:  (i)  setting \nup a toll road investment fund to mobilize funds from the private sector; and (ii) a build-operate-\ntransfer  agreement,  with  the  public  sector  providing  a  subsidy  sufficient  to  encourage \ninvestment interest from the private sector. \n \nThe World Bank intends to include a follow-up advisory TA component to their new loan \n5. \nfor the second phase of the Highway Management Project to assist the Government in moving \nahead with a public\u2013private partnership project to implement the first section of the Bang Pa-In \nto Nakhon Ratchasima Motorway, i.e., from Bang Pa-In to Sarabari. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nIn  anticipation  of  the  need  for  certain  reforms  to  the  Thai  legal  framework,  and  to  be \ncompatible with international norms and requirements that will arise with the utilization of public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  contracts,  the  MOT  has  drafted  a  new  transport  management  act.  The \npresent draft of this proposed legislation is divided into three parts: (i) the first part deals with the \nrequired  structural  reforms  needed  to  ensure  a  clear  separation  of  responsibility  and  authority \nbetween the transport entities and agencies of government with respect to policy, regulation and \noperation;  (ii)  the  second  part  deals  with  specific  legal  issues  dealing  with  public\u2013private \npartnerships,  including  definitions;  models;  and  the  rights,  benefits,  and  risks  of  both  parties; \nand (iii) the third part deals with supporting mechanisms for investment in infrastructure, such as \nestablishing  and  administering  toll  road  investment  trusts  or  other  investment  type  funds,  and \npromotion incentives with respect to tax and other promotional benefits. This law is in the draft \nand review stage, with enactment contemplated for late 2009 or early 2010. \n \nIn  June  2008,  the  Government  announced  that  it  had  established  a  high-level  public\u2013\n7. \nprivate  partnership  committee,  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister.  The  committee  would  be  under \nthe  supervision  of  the  Budget  Bureau,  with  the  director  of  the  Budget  Bureau  as  the  vice \nchairman. Other committee representatives would come from the National Economy and Social \nDevelopment Board (NESDB), the Fiscal Policy Office, the Public Debt Management Office and \nthe State Enterprise Office of Ministry of Finance, the Security and Exchange Commission, and \nthe  Office  of  the  Attorney  General.  In  addition  to  selecting  and  approving  projects,  the \ncommittee will consider fund mobilization for major projects in the public sector, all in line with \nthe Government's policies. It will also monitor project implementation and work progress, while \nthe  responsible  government  agency  will  carry  out  the  project  in  accordance  with  the  legal \nframework.  One  of  the  primary  sectors  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  is  expected  to  be  the \ntransport sector.4 In August 2008, the committee approved three pilot projects to be carried out \non  a  public\u2013private  partnership  basis,  one  of  which  was  in  the  transport  sector:  the  199  km \nmotorway from Bang Pa-In to Nakorn Ratchasima. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nIn  conjunction  with  the  emphasis  the  Government  is  placing  on  public\u2013private \npartnerships, and as a logical follow-up to the World Bank-assisted TA (para. 3), ADB will assist \nthe  Government  in  preparing  an  implementation  plan  for  the  Strategic  Intercity  Motorway \nNetwork utilizing a public\u2013private partnership. The final output of the implementation plan will be \n\nObjective of the Technical Assistance \n\n                                                 \n4 Other sectors that are being considered for involvement include public health, energy and environmental. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nScope of the Technical Assistance \n\na  detailed  and  coordinated  scheme,  in  the  form  of  a  clear  and  detailed  financial  and \nimplementation  plan  utilizing  the  appropriate  public\u2013private  partnership  arrangement,  so  that \ncertain motorways along five corridors5 radiating out from Bangkok to a distance of 250\u2013300 km \nwill have been constructed and have become operational by 2017.  \n \n9. \nThe  overall  objective  of  the  plan  will  be  to  provide  the  Government  with  a  detailed \nimplementation scheme for the planned motorway corridors, and to prepare the highest priority \nproject  ready  for  award  and  implementation  using  an  appropriate  public\u2013private  partnership \nmodel. The TA will concentrate on three motorway links: (i) Chonburi to Map Ta Put, including \nan access link to Laem Chabang Port; (ii) Bang Yai to Nakhon Pathom (Bang Pong) to Cha-am; \nand (iii) Nakhon Pathom to Kanchanaburi. In general, the TA study will build upon the work and \ndocumentation prepared under the World Bank's TA for the DOH on the Bang Pa-In to Nakhon \nRatchasima Motorway. \n \nE. \n \nThe  TA  study  will  be  carried  out  in  three  phases  as  follows:  (i)  the  inspection  and \n10. \nscreening  phase  (1  month),  (ii)  the  project  preparation  phase  (5  months),  and  (iii)  the \nprocurement assistance phase (12 months of intermittent input).   \n \n \nInspection  and  Screening  Phase.  The  objective  of  this  task  is  to  establish  a  priority \n11. \nranking of the three motorway links (para. 9) in terms of financial and economic feasibility, and \nin  terms  of  social  and  environmental  feasibility  (i.e.,  implementation  difficulty).  In  addition,  the \nconsultant  shall  take  into  account  planning  and  priority  objectives  of  the  Government.  The \nconsultant  is  expected  to  utilize  past  route  and  feasibility  studies,  preliminary  and  detailed \ndesigns and reports, and historical and existing traffic counts, and to devise a weighted matrix \nmethodology  to  rank  the  three  links.

The  consultant  will  also  need  to \nemploy a high level of judgmental experience, and to collaborate closely with the Government. \nThis  phase  is  expected  to  require  expertise  in  international  infrastructure  public\u2013private \npartnership  investment  schemes  and  models,  financial  analyses,  transport  economics,  and \nmotorway and cost engineering.  \n \n13. \nAt  the  end  of  the  inspection  and  screening  phase,  the  consultant  will  organize  and \nfacilitate  the  first  tripartite  meeting,  which  will  be  attended  by  representatives  from  the \nGovernment,  ADB,  and  the  consultant.

This  was  done  using  the  Highway \nDevelopment  and  Management  Model  4  (HDM-4),  which  allows  for  modeling  of  the  impact  of \ncongestion and road safety in addition to simulating the development and impact of road surface \nconditions on vehicle operating costs (VOCs). In the without-project case, the project roads are \nassumed  to  remain  as  two-lane  single  carriageway  roads,  while  the  with-project  scenario \nassumes  that  they  are  widened  to  four-lane  dual  carriageway  standard.  Construction  of  the \nroads  is  expected  to  begin  at  different  times  and  with  different  implementation  periods.  The \noverall economic analysis covers 24 years, from 2010 to 2033\u2014a construction period of 4 years \nfollowed by a benefit period of 20 years. All benefits and costs are in constant early 2008 prices. \nThe  economic  prices  are  expressed  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  for  non-traded  goods \nand border prices for traded goods. The project design is the low-cost option as the Project will \nupgrade  selected  sections  of  the  highway  network,  and  the  possibility  that  other  transport \nmodes may offer lower costs is not plausible, simply by inspection. Cost reduction options that \nmay  arise  from  alternative  highway  design  standards,  or  details,  will  be  addressed  during  the \ndetailed engineering design process. \n \nB. \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic Forecast \n\nRoad Condition. Information on the existing roads was collected from the road network \n2. \ninventory  maintained  by  the  Department  of  Highways  (DOH)  and  verified  by  field  observation. \nThe  existing  roads  are  7  meter  (m)  asphaltic  concrete  paved  roads  with  an  average \nInternational  Roughness  Index  (IRI)  in  the  range  of  IRI  3.0  meter/kilometer  (m/km)  to  IRI  5.0 \nm/km. In the with-project case, road roughness is assumed to be IRI 2.0 m/km immediately after \nconstruction.  Future  roughness  levels  are  forecast  using  the  HDM-4  model  assuming \napplication of the standard road maintenance regime in Thailand. \n \nTraffic  Volume.  The  DOH  annually  performs  classified  traffic  counts  on  all  project \n3. \nroads. The traffic counts identify 13 vehicle types, ranging from non-motorized vehicles to truck-\ntrailers.  Non-motorized  vehicles  (such  as  bicycles)  and  agricultural  vehicles  were  excluded \nsince  these  are  unaffected  by  widening  the  project  roads.  For  the  Phitsanulok\u2013Lom  Sak \nsubproject, a detailed feasibility study1 was carried out in 2006. These additional traffic counts \nwere also taken into account in preparing base-year traffic data since they document significant \nweekend  and  tourist  traffic  that  is  not  reflected  in  the  DOH  database.  A  summary  of  the \nestimated traffic volumes in 2007 is shown in Table A12.1. \n \n4. \nTraffic  Forecast.  The DOH maintains a traffic counting database for all national roads. \nUnfortunately,  the  database  does  not  provide  accurate  information  on  overall  traffic  growth \nbecause  local  road  networks  are  expanding  rapidly.  This  diverts  an  increasing  share  of  total \ntraffic out of view of the DOH database, which does not record traffic on local roads. As a result, \ncomparisons  over  time  are  distorted.  Therefore,  traffic  growth  forecasting  has  been  based  on \napplying  income  elasticities  to  forecast  economic  growth  as  measured  by  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) in constant prices. Between 2003 and 2006, Thailand\u2019s GDP grew at an average \nrate of about 5% per year. For 2007, it is expected that GDP has grown by about 4.3% because \n\n                                                 \n1   Thai  DCI  Company  Limited  et  al.  2006.

Future \nGDP growth is forecast to average about 5% per year.2 Based on this, a set of general traffic \ngrowth rates have been estimated by applying income elasticities of 1.1 for freight transport and \n1.2  for  passenger  transport.  These  are  lower  than  usual  and  take  into  account  the  almost \ndoubling of fuel prices between 2006 and early 2008, as well as the expectation that high fuel \nprices will remain in future.3 The traffic forecast ignores generated traffic since the Project has \nlimited impact on VOCs; it also generally ignores diverted traffic since other parts of the network \nare being upgraded concurrently.  \n  \n\nTable A12.1: Estimated Average Annual Daily Traffic in 2007 \n\n \nHighway \n\n \nSubproject/Section \n\nMotor-\ncycles \n\nLight \nVehicles \n\n \nBuses \n\n \nTrucks \n\n \nTotal \n\n12 \n\n \n \n \n359 \n\nPhitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak \n\n1.

The  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  unit  costs  were  derived  from  rates  for \nindividual  work  items.  The  construction  cost  estimates  cover  improving  the  roads  from  the \nexisting  carriageway  width  of  7  meters  to  dual  carriageways  with  a  total  width  of  14  meters. \nEconomic costs exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, and interest during construction, but \ndo  include  physical  contingencies,  construction  supervision  costs,  and  detailed  design  costs. \nThe  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  A12.2.  The  higher  costs  per  km  for  the \nPhitsanulok\u2013Lom  Sak  subproject  mainly  reflect that  some  sections  are in  severe  mountainous \nterrain and large volumes of civil works earthworks will be required.  \n \n\nTable A12.2: Cost Estimates  \n(B million) \n\nCivil Worksa \n\nFinancial \n\nResettle-\nment \n\n \nLand \n\n \nHighway Section \n\nPhitsanulok\u2013Lom Sak  \nPhanon Sarakham\u2013Sa Kaeo \nOverall Project \nkm = kilometer. \na Includes physical contingencies, supervision costs and environmental mitigation  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n   4,082.8 \n   1,812.2 \n   5,894.9 \n\n       17.0 \n         7.0 \n       24.0 \n\n \n\nEconomic \n   3,815.7 \n   1,693.6 \n   5,509.3 \n\nTotal Economic \nProject  Per Km\n36.5 \n23.4 \n\n1.0   3,833.7 \n4.9   1,705.6 \n6.0   5,539.2 \n\n                                                 \n2   The  average  annual  economic  growth  targets  in  the  10th,  11th,  and  12th  Plans  of  the  National  Economic  and \n\nSocial Development Board, which together cover 2007\u20132021, are in the range of 5.0% to 5.6%. \n\n3  The Government\u2019s National Transport Plan uses traffic growth rates of about 5% per year for both passenger and \nfreight  transport.  The  previous  feasibility  studies  for  the  project  roads  also  used  long-term  average  traffic  growth \nrates ranging between 5.0% and 5.6% per year. The World Bank\u2019s Thailand Highways Management Project uses \ntraffic growth rates of 3%\u20136% in the short term and 3% in the long term. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nD. \n\nBenefits \n\n6. \nThe benefits to road users is estimated as the differences between VOC, time cost for \npassengers,  and  accident  costs  in  the  with-project  and  the  without-project  cases  using  the \nHDM-4  model.  The  main  benefit  resulting  from  the  improved  road  standard  is  in  the  form  of \ntravel time savings, which is a direct result of the higher speeds that are achieved on four-lane \nroads.  VOC  savings  are  smaller  because  the  road  surface  condition  of  the  present  roads  is \nalready good to fair, and because higher speeds do not always produce VOC benefits because \nof  progressively  increasing  fuel  cost.  Accident  savings  can  only  be  estimated,  but  the  general \npattern  of  a  25%\u201340%  reduction  in  accidents  when  two-lane  roads  are  upgraded  to  four-lane \ndual  carriageway  standard  is  confirmed  by  data  from  Thailand.  The  reduction  is  particularly \nnoticeable in the number of head-on collisions, which have the worst casualty rate and therefore \nthe  highest  cost.  Unit  prices  for  valuing  VOC,  time,  and  accident  costs  were  derived  from  a \nreport  on  road  user  costs4  prepared  for  the  DOH  in  early  2008  using  2006  prices. With  minor \nadjustment,  the  report  remains  valid  today.  The  exception  is  fuel  prices,  which  have  nearly \ndoubled and therefore were estimated independently. \n \n7. \nThe  estimated  economic  fuel  prices  are  based  on  import  prices,  which  are  closely \nrelated  to  crude  oil  prices.  There  are  no  official  forecasts  of  future  crude  prices,  and  the  few \navailable forecasts for the medium term (up to 2010) vary from a reduction to $60 per barrel or \nless to increases to $200 per barrel or more. For both petrol and diesel fuel, a price of B25 per \nliter  was  used  based  on  an  assumed  long-term  average  crude  oil  price  of  $120  per  barrel  in \nconstant price terms. However, it should be noted that a road project benefit evaluation is based \non the difference in VOC between the with- and without-project cases. Because the difference in \nfuel consumption for the type of projects being considered is small, the level of fuel prices has \nlittle  impact on  road  user  benefits.  However,  fuel  cost  does  affect  the  propensity  to  travel  and \nthereby the traffic forecast. This impact is tested by varying forecast future traffic growth rates in \nthe  sensitivity  analysis.  Estimated  VOC  for  the  with-  and  without-project  cases  in  the  opening \nyear, distributed by vehicle type, are in Table A12.3.  \n \n\nTable A12.3: Estimated Typical Vehicle Operating Costs  \n(B/km) \n\n \nVehicle Type \nMotorcycle  \nCar < 7 passengers \nCar > 7 passengers \nLight Bus \nMedium Bus \nHeavy Bus \nLight Truck \nMedium Truck \nHeavy Truck \nArticulated Truck \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nWithout \nProject \n1.37 \n6.34 \n7.65 \n6.60 \n9.90 \n20.59 \n5.94 \n9.90 \n20.87 \n27.73 \n\n \n\nWith \nProject \n1.36 \n6.35 \n7.52 \n6.56 \n9.34 \n18.43 \n5.96 \n11.67 \n19.50 \n26.81 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4  Team  Consulting  Engineering  and  Management  Co.

A small increase was made to unit time values to reflect changes in \nincome per head since 2006, but significantly lower proportions were assumed to be traveling \nduring  working  time  compared  with  the  2008  study,  especially  in  the  case  of  bus passengers. \nThe values of passenger time per hour for different vehicle types and their occupancy rates are \nin Table A12.4.   \n  \n\nTable A12.4: Value of Passenger Time \n\n \n \nVehicle Type \nMotorcycle  \nCar < 7 passengers \nCar > 7 passengers \nLight Bus \nMedium Bus \nHeavy Bus \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimate. \n\n \nWork Time\n(B/hour) \n45.00 \n70.00 \n70.00 \n45.00 \n45.00 \n45.00 \n\nNon-work \nTime \n(B/hour) \n11.25 \n17.50 \n17.50 \n11.25 \n11.25 \n11.25 \n\nPercentage \nWork Time \n(%) \n\nPassengers \nper Vehicle \n(persons) \n1.2 \n2.3 \n8.0 \n10.0 \n25.0 \n40.0 \n\n25 \n35 \n30 \n5 \n5 \n5 \n\n \n \nBecause  the  surface  condition  of  most  roads  is  good,  and  some  components  of  VOC \n9. \nincrease with the higher speeds in the with-project case, the VOC benefits are generally small, \nand  can  be  negative.  They  are  less  important  than  time  savings,  which  are  directly  related  to \nvehicle  speeds  and  are  always  higher  in  the  with-project  case.  Time  savings  increase  rapidly, \nsignificantly faster than traffic growth rates. This is because the growth in traffic would lead to \nmore  congestion  and  progressively  lower  speeds  without  the  Project.  As  a  result,  the  time \nbenefits per vehicle-km will increase each year, and when these rising benefits per vehicle-km \nare multiplied by the increasing traffic level, the total annual time benefits can rise to very high \nlevels.  This  effect  translates  into  particularly  high  time  savings  on  the  Phanon  Sarakham\u2013Sa \nKaeo  section,  because  of  the  higher  traffic  levels  on  that  road.  For  the  Phitsanulok\u2013Lom  Sak \nsection,  the  combined  effect  of  road  gradient,  curvature,  and  traffic  flow  on  speeds  increases \ntime benefits. This increased benefit effect compensates for the higher construction cost on that \nroad. \n \n10. \naverage cost are in Table A12.5.

It  is \nassumed that about 30% of the initial capital invested in the Project\u2014notably for embankments, \nbase,  and  sub-base  materials\u2014and  a  share  of  the  structures  will  be  retained  since  these \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ncomponents have a much longer economic life than 20 years. The Project\u2019s share of the future \nbenefits stemming from the reuse of these parts of the project investment have been included \nas  terminal  values  estimated  at  30%  of  the  net  present  value  of  the  last  year\u2019s  net  benefits, \nperpetuated  indefinitely.  No  further  traffic  growth  is  assumed  to  avoid  including  benefits \nstemming from possible additional traffic that could be accommodated if the roads were further \nwidened. \n \nE. \n \n3. \nAll subprojects were shown to be viable with the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nfor  the  Project  as  a  whole  estimated  as  15.8%.

The results of the sensitivity analysis (Table \nA12.7)  show  that  the  economic  viability  is  generally  robust.  The  switching  values  were \ncalculated for 12.0% of the EIRR, which is ADB's criterion for project's economic viability. As the \nswitching  values  in  the  Table  show,  capital  costs  increase  by  52.6%  or  benefits  decrease  by \n36.1% renders the project unviable.  \n\n \nTable A12.7: Results of Sensitivity Tests \n\nScenario \nBase Case \nCapital Costs increased by 20% \nBenefits reduced by 20% \nCapital costs increase 20% and benefits decrease 20% \n\n15.8 \n14.3 \n13.7 \n12.2 \n\n\u2014 \n\n52.6 \n36.1 \n\u2014 \n\nEIRR (%)  Switching Value (%) \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n  \u2014 = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \n \n \n5. \nThe @Risk computer software program was used for risk analysis. The uncertain values \nhave been taken as the civil works cost, VOC benefits, time benefits, and accident benefits.  For \neach,  the  maximum  possible  value  for  that  parameter  is  20%  higher  than  the  estimated  most \nlikely  value,  and  the  minimum  possible  value  is  80%  of  the  most  likely  value  used  in  the \nevaluation.  The  analysis  shows  a  15.3%  risk  that  the  Project  would  not  reach  the  minimum \nEIRR of 12% for economic viability. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n59 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\nA. \n\nProject Background \n\n1. \nThe Government of Thailand plans to widen highways 12 and 359 to four lanes as part \nof  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Highway  Expansion  Project.  The  aim  of  the  Project  is  to \nimprove  the  transport  infrastructure  in  the  East\u2013West  and  Southern  corridors  of  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS). The right-of-ways (ROW) have been acquired, and were established \nand  demarcated  starting  in  1950s  (Highway  12)  and  in  2000  (Highway  359).  The  ROW  of \nhighways 12 and 359 is 60 meters (m) wide (i.e., 30 m each way from the road centerline). The \nentire ROW of the highways will be cleared of all obstructions. \n\n2. \nIn  August  2008,  the  first  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  based  on  the  results  of  an \ninventory of affected fixed assets using a reduced corridor of impact (COI). On Highway 359, for \nexample, an 11 m wide corridor from the edge of the ROW on the two new lanes construction \nside  was  not  included  in  the  survey  as  this  empty  space  was  to  be  provided  for  the  use  of \nvendors to move back their affected stalls and shelters.1 On Highway 12, the COI in areas with \nstalls and/or shelters was reduced to 14 m from the road centerline.  The intention to reduce the \nCOI  was  laudable.  However,  further  consideration  by  the  Department  of  Highways  (DOH) \nconvinced project authorities that it was not sustainable because it would not address the issue \nof  encroachment  in  the  ROW,  and  because  the  presence  of  obstructions  and  vendors  in  the \nROW puts pedestrians and motorists at risk.  \n\n3. \nThe  updated  resettlement  plan  is  based  on  a  detailed  measurement  survey  (DMS)  of \nfixed assets inside the ROW of highways 12 and 359. The DMS included assets and affected \npeople and households excluded in the inventory of affected fixed assets in 2008. \n\nB. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\nThe  DMS  for  Highway  359  was  carried  out  27\u201331  October  and  5\u20139  November  2008, \n4. \nwhile  that  for  Highway  12  was  done  on  16\u201331  March  2009.  At  least  353  households  (about \n1,765 persons) will be adversely affected by the Project. The following is a breakdown of project \nimpacts: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nHighway  12.  The  total  number  of  the  affected  households  is  261.  While  243 \nstalls  and  shelters  and  five  houses  will  relocate  outside  the  ROW,  13  other \nhouses will be partially affected. In addition, 41 plots (with an aggregate area of \nabout 64,883 square meters) located along the highway and inside the ROW will \nbe cleared in the highway widening. During the DMS, 43 persons farming inside \nthe ROW were located and interviewed.  \nHighway 359. The total number of the affected households is 92. One house, 91 \nstalls  and  shelters,  1  government-owned  waiting  shed,  and  1  farm  shack  will \nrelocate outside the ROW. In addition, 133 plots (with an aggregate area of about \n402,770  square  meters)  located  along  the  highway  and  inside  the  ROW  have \nbeen planted with food  and cash crops, such as rice, cassava, and eucalyptus. \nThese  plots  will  be  cleared  to  make  way  for  the  construction  of  two  new  lanes. \nDuring  the  DMS,  41  persons  farming  inside  the  ROW  were  located  and \ninterviewed.  \n\n                                                 \n1 Also referred to as small shops or kiosks. Most of the stalls and shelters have no walls.  \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nC. \n\nLegal and Policy Framework \n\n5. \nThe  project  resettlement  policy  has  been  developed  taking  into  account  the  2007 \nConstitution  of  the  Kingdom  of  Thailand,  the  Expropriation  of  Immovable  Property  Act  of  B.E. \n2530 (1987), the Highway Act of B.E. 2535 (1992), and the Highway Act of B.E. 2549 (2006).  It \nalso  takes  into  account  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995) and relevant sections of the Operations Manual (2006), and other ADB policies that have \nbearing  on  resettlement  planning  and  implementation,  such  as  indigenous  peoples,  gender, \npublic  communications,  and  accountability  mechanism.  The  project  resettlement  policy  has \nbeen formulated in a way that recognizes that, while the ROW for most of the project roads has \nbeen  acquired,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  the  affected  people  will  be  able  to  continue,  with \nminimal disruption, with their livelihood and that their socioeconomic conditions are maintained, \nif not improved, during road construction. The entitlement matrix is in Table A13.1.     \n\nTypes of Impacts \nOn Income (permanent or \ntemporary) \n\nOn Houses, House with Stalls \nand/or Shelters, and Stalls and \nShelters \n\nOn Crops and Trees \n\nTable A13.1: Entitlement Matrix \n\nRehabilitation Measures \nThe DOH will assist by coordinating with the resettlement coordinating committee \nand  Tambon  Administration  Office  in  finding  replacement  land  for  stalls  and \nshelters in a  way that will allow for the gradual transfer of business operations to \nthe  new  site,  thereby  avoiding  any  business  disruption.  Poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds  will  be  given  priority  in  choosing  stalls  in  the  new  sites.  For  farmers, \nthe DOH will assist in finding replacement land with similar productive attributes for \nlease. \n\nThe  DOH  and/or  civil  works  contractor  will  provide  in-kind  assistance  during  the \ndismantling and transfer of structures and belongings or goods outside the ROW, \nand will provide similar materials for damaged building materials and materials that \ncannot  be  reused,  as  necessary.  For  house  owners  who  will  have  to  relocate, \ntemporary shelter will be provided, as necessary.  \n\nAffected households  will be allowed to harvest annual crops and timber products \nbefore  the  start  of  construction.  For  the  trees  that  will  be  transplanted,  the  DOH \nwill  provide  assistance  in  balling  the  trees  and  transport  them  for  replanting \noutside of the ROW.   \n\nWhere trees will not be transplanted, the DOH will coordinate  with the concerned \ndepartment  to  provide  the  owner  of  the  trees  with  saplings  that  are  equivalent  to \nthe  productive  value  or  age  of  the  trees  in  that  area;  and/or  coordinate  with  civil \nworks contractor to purchase the trees and utilize them for the civil works, such as \nlandscaping  and  temporary  works,  and/or  to  provide  the  tree  owners  in-kind \nassistance, such as leveling their unused land. \n\nDOH = Department of Highways, ROW = right-of-way.  \nSource: Department of Highways estimates. \n\nD. \n\nEthnicity, Vulnerability and Gender Issues \n\n6. \nNo  ethnic  minority  households  are  located  along  Highway  359.  The  2008  resettlement \nplan identified 28 households headed by women, 29 poor households, and 16 households that \nwere headed by persons within the retirement age bracket of the Government. During the DMS, \nthe  identities  of  42  affected  households  whose  assets  were  also  tagged  during  the  2008 \ninventory of losses survey have been determined. Of these, 41 have cultivated plots inside the \nROW, while 1 was a stall or shelter owner. Women head 13 of these newly identified affected \nhouseholds. All of them are ethnic Thai. None of the household heads is disabled, 33 claim to \nhave  a  household  monthly  income  below  the  poverty  line,  and  14  of  the  newly  identified \nhousehold heads are within the retirement age group. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n61 \n\nThe 2008 resettlement plan identified 99 households headed by women along Highway \n7. \n12,  37  households  below  the  poverty  line,  and  38  households  headed  by  persons  within  the \nretirement age bracket. During the DMS, 63 affected households\u2014some of which are affected \nbecause of the recovery of the entire ROW\u2014were identified. Of these, 43 have cultivated plots \ninside the ROW, while 19 are stall or shelter owners, and 1 is affected by the loss of a garage. \nWomen  head  31  of  these  newly  identified  affected  households.  All  of  them  are  ethnic  Thai. \nNone of the household heads is disabled, while 37 claim to have a household monthly income \nbelow the poverty line.   \n\nAdditional measures are incorporated in the resettlement plan to help ensure that poor \n8. \nand  other  vulnerable  affected  households  are  not  further  disadvantaged;  and  that,  along  with \nthe other affected households, they will benefit from the Project. Specifically, greater care and \nattention  will  be  provided  to  these  affected  households  during  the  transfer  of  their  stalls  and \nshelters to spare them from any additional hardship during displacement. During the updating of \nthe  resettlement  plan,  it  was  determined  that  farmers  will  take  turns  cultivating  paddy  land.  If \nduring  clearing  of  the  ROW,  farmers  are  found  to  be  severely  affected  (i.e.,  the  loss  is \nequivalent to 10% ore more of their total income capacity), the DOH will assist by coordinating \nwith  the resettlement coordinating committee (RCC) and Tambon Administration Office to find \nreplacement land with similar productive attributes for lease. \n\nE. \n\nConsultation, Participation, and Grievance Redress \n\n9. \nConsultations, public meetings, and village discussions with the affected households and \nthe  local  governments  were  done  before  and  after  the  conduct  of  the  IOL  in  2008  and  during \nand  after  the  DMS  in  2009  as  part  of  the  resettlement  planning  process.  These  activities  will \ncontinue  during  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  consistent  with  the  Project\u2019s \nparticipatory approach. A grievance redress mechanism has been designed to ensure that the \nconcerns and complaints of the affected households are readily addressed at the village level in \na  timely  and  satisfactory  manner.  The  affected  households  have  been  made  aware  of  their \nrights through verbal and written means during resettlement planning and updating, and this will \ncontinue during resettlement implementation.  \n\nF. \n\nLivelihood Restoration \n\n10. \nThe DOH, through its sub-district offices, will ensure that the livelihood activities of the \nowners  of  affected  houses,  house  with  stalls  and/or  shelters,  and  independent  stalls  and \nshelters  are  not  disrupted.  The  owners  of  stalls  and  shelters  will  be  assisted  in  gradually \ndismantling, reorganizing, or setting up their operations in a way that will allow them to gradually \nphase out their operation in their old place and begin their operation in their new place. Under \nthis  arrangement,  the  owners  of  stalls  and  shelters,  whose  business  caters  to  road  users,  will \nnot experience any stoppage in their operation. Therefore, the livelihood of these owners will not \nbe  severely  affected  by  the  highway  widening.  For  households  with  farms  inside  the  COI,  the \nProject  will  ensure  that  they  will  be  able  to  harvest  their  crops  before  construction.  The  DMS \ndetermined  that  none  of  these  farming  households  will  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  source  of \nlivelihood or income.   \n\n11. \nThe DOH and/or civil works contractor will provide in-kind assistance in dismantling and \ntransferring all affected structures, including the preparation of replacement market sites where \ndisplaced stalls and shelters could transfer. All standing annual crops, including perennial and \ntimber trees, will be allowed to be harvested or cut before the start of civil works in a section of \nthe  project  road.  Young  perennial  trees  will  be  balled  and  transferred  by  the  civil  works \ncontractor to the affected person\u2019s own land. Where trees will not be transplanted, the DOH will \ncoordinate with the concerned department to provide the owner of the trees with saplings that \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nare  equivalent  to  the  productive  value  or  age  of  the  trees  in  that  area;  and/or  coordinate  with \ncivil  works  contractor  to  purchase  the  trees  and  utilize  them  for  the  civil  works,  such  as \nlandscaping and temporary works, and/or to provide the tree owners in-kind assistance, such as \nleveling their unused land. \n\nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements, Monitoring, and Resettlement Plan Budget \n\n12. \nThe  DOH,  through  its  project  management  office  (PMO),  has  overall  responsibility  for \nplanning  and  implementing  all  aspects  of  resettlement.  The  DOH  sub-district  offices,  with \nassistance from technical assistance consultants, spearheaded the updating of the resettlement \nplan. The sub-district offices will continue this lead role during resettlement plan implementation. \nAn RCC, composed of representatives from the DOH sub-district offices, the local government \n(district  or  municipality),  and  the  affected  households  (most  of  whom  are  stall  and/or  shelter \nowners)  was  set  up  to  facilitate  systematic  relocation  of  stalls  and  shelters  and  houses, \nincluding  the  harvesting  of  annual  crops  and  perennial  trees.  The  RCC  will serve  as  the  main \nvehicle  through  which  the  affected  households  can  actively  participate  in  looking  for  a  place \noutside of the ROW for them to continue operating their roadside livelihoods. The RCC will also \nhelp  ensure  that  affected  households  are  updated  on  the  project,  and  that  they  are  informed \nabout  the  start  of  civil  works  in  a  specific  section  at  least  3  months  in  advance.  The  project \nsupervision consultants and the civil works contractors will also be represented in the RCC after \nthey  have  been  selected  and  mobilized.  The  project  supervision  consultants  will  continue  to \nassist the PMO and the DOH sub-district offices during the implementation of the resettlement \nplan  to  ensure  that  social  safeguard  measures  laid  out  in  the  resettlement  plan  are  complied \nwith. These consultants will provide needed training and capacity building inputs on a full-time \nbasis. For this purpose, the consultants will have its own social development and  resettlement \nteam,  composed  of  one  international  social  development  and  resettlement  specialist,  one \ndomestic resettlement specialist, and one domestic gender specialist working an intermittently. \n\n13. \nThe  DOH,  through  its  PMO,  will  be  overall  responsible  for  internal  monitoring  of \nresettlement activities. Related reports will be submitted to ADB quarterly and uploaded onto the \nDOH's website and the ADB website. \n\n14. \nThe  cost  for  in-kind  assistance  and  restoration  measures  for  the  two  highways  is \nestimated  at  B34,157,210.  This  amount  includes  the  costs  of  (i)  dismantling  and  transferring \naffected stalls and shelters and houses, (ii) transporting totally affected stalls and shelters and \nhouses  to  their  new  sites,  (iii),  preparing  new  sites  for  the  stalls  and  shelters,  (iv)  operational \nand administrative expenses, and (v) contingencies. All assistance will be in-kind, and no cash \nassistance  will  be  provided  to  the  affected  households.  The  DOH  will  ensure  the  timely \navailability  of  funds  for  resettlement,  including  unforeseen  costs  in  excess  of  resettlement \nbudget estimates to satisfy the project resettlement objectives. \n\nH. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Disclosure Activities \n\n15. \nThe resettlement schedule is provided in Table A13.2.
