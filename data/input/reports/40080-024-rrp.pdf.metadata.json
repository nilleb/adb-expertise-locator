By \ncontributing to an efficient, integrated, and sustainable metro system, the project will support the \nHa  Noi  urban  transport  master  plan  objectives  of  increasing  the  use  of  public  transport  and \nreducing dependency on private vehicles. 4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  is  investing  in  major  public  transport  infrastructure  to \ninduce a substantial switch by urban citizens from private to public modes of transport.5 A failure \nto  invest  in  public  transport  infrastructure  and  to  encourage  this  shift  away  from  the  use  of \nprivate  vehicles  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  large  cities  will  hurt  economic  growth  and  accelerate  the \ndegradation of the urban environment. The government is supporting climate change mitigation \nefforts  by  adopting  a  low-carbon  transport  growth  path  that  will  be  more  energy  efficient  and \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. ADB\u2019s 2012\u20132015 country partnership strategy for Viet Nam \nsupports  the government's  program to  improve  urban  transport  infrastructure  and  promote the \nuse of public transport.6 \n  \n4. \nHa  Noi  is  at  an  early  stage  of  urban  transport  development,  having  moved from  heavy \nusage of bicycles to motorcycles and now increasingly to cars. Private vehicles dominate urban \ntransportation,  about  90%  of  which  consists  of  motorcycles.  Continued  increasing  car \nownership,  together  with  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of  motorcycles,  has  resulted  in \nsevere congestion during peak hours, resulting in degradation of the urban environment and a \nrise in traffic accidents. The situation is expected to worsen if the current traffic growth trend of \n9% per year continues and more motorbike users convert to cars. The existing public transport \nsystem  consists  of  an  inadequate  bus  network  that  is  becoming  less  competitive  with  private \nmodes of transport.7 Traffic planning and parking management is weak and unable to effectively \nhandle  traffic  and  demand.  Importantly,  there  are  no  policy  and  regulatory  measures  to \n\n                                                \n1  Financed by the Clean Technology Fund.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Strengthening \n\nSustainable Urban Transport for Ha Noi Metro Line 3 Project. Manila. (TA-7894-VIE). \n\n4  ADB  Clean  Technology  Fund  financing  is  based  upon  the  sustainable  transport  benefits  of  the  metro  line  3 \n\n5   Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, 13th National Assembly. 2011. Socio-Economic Development Plan for the 2011\u2013\n\ninvestment. \n\n2015 Period.  Ha Noi. \n\n6   ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. \n7   Improvements  to  the  bus  system  are  expected  under  an  ongoing  World  Bank  project  that  will  implement  a  bus \nrapid transit line, establish a public transport authority, and improve bus operations and management systems by \n2016. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndiscourage private modes of transport, so the existing inadequate public transport system is not \nattractive to private vehicle users. \n \n5. \nThe  Ha  Noi  People\u2019s  Committee  (HPC)  plans  to  develop  a  city-wide  mass  transit \nsystem,  and  four  metro  lines  and  one  bus  rapid  transit  line  are  currently  under  development. \nConstruction of phase 1 for metro line 3 commenced in October 2010 and it is expected to be \noperating  in  2019. 8  The  three  other  metro  lines  are  expected  to  be  completed  by  2020. 9 \nHowever,  complementary  measures  building  upon  other  sector  reforms  to  improve  public \ntransport  will  need  to  be  designed  to  ensure  the  emergence  of  an  integrated  public  transport \nsystem  that  is  attractive,  accessible,  and  affordable.  The  proposed  project  will  support  a \nmultimodal,  integrated  transport  system  to  attract  passengers  from  private  vehicles  to  public \ntransport  services.  This  modal  shift  will  promote  inclusive  low-carbon  transport,  thereby \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution. \n \n6. \nThe  project  will  directly  support  the  integration  of  metro  line  3  into  the  public  transport \nnetwork  by  providing  infrastructure  to  improve  connectivity  to  metro  line  3  stations  through \nfeeder  bus  links.  The  project  will  develop  integrated  multimodal  stations  for  metro  line  3  with \nparking  plans  and  park-and-ride  facilities  to  improve  station  accessibility.  The  supporting \ninfrastructure,  public  transport  services,  and  other  facilities  will  be  designed  to  incorporate \ngender-sensitive features that will complement similar measures under the metro line 3 project \n(footnote  8).  In  addition,  policy  and  regulatory  measures  developed  will  be  fully  inclusive  by \naddressing the needs of all potential public transport users. The proposed institutional capacity \nbuilding measures for metro agencies, together with expected policy and regulatory reforms, will \nalso help achieve an improved public transport system and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n7. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  an  enhanced  public  transport  system  serving  six \ndistricts of Ha Noi.10 The outcome will be the improved integration of metro line 3 stations with \nother modes of public transport. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n8. \nMetro  line  3  station  accessibility  improved.  These  improvements,  including  public \ntransport facilities, will be constructed along the first stage of metro line 3 from Nhon to Ha Noi \nmain  railway  station,  up  to  500  meters  from  the  four  underground  and  eight  elevated  stations \nalong the 12.5 km line. Civil  works will include pedestrian subways and footbridges, bus stops \nand  feeder  links,  dedicated  taxi  stands,  park-and-ride  facilities  for  two-wheeled  vehicles,  and \nwaiting  areas  for  other  public  transport  service  providers.  All  infrastructure  and  other  facilities \nwill  have  gender-sensitive  and  universal  accessibility  features  and  safe  passageways  for \npedestrians. The project will also establish a station access management system to facilitate the \nefficient flow  of  people  and  traffic  around metro  line  3  stations.  Enforcement  measures  will  be \nimproved to  ensure  clear pedestrian  access  and  smooth traffic flow  and to  manage  parking of \nprivate  vehicles  around  the  metro  stations.  The  project  will  finance  consulting  services  for \n\n                                                \n8   ADB.  2011.

The  project  will  provide  52  buses to  service  bus \nfeeder lines and an information system along metro line 3. The information system will be linked \nto  the  main  bus  control  center  in  Ha  Noi  to  provide  real-time  bus  and  train  arrival  information \nthat will make the public transport system more convenient and reliable. The project will include \nthe  installation  of  equipment  for  the  information  system  at  the  metro  line  3  stations,  including \nrequired equipment on buses and at bus stops.  \n \n10. \n Public  transport  policy  developed.  To  support  the  objectives  of  the  Ha  Noi  urban \ntransport  master  plan  and  make  public  transport  more  financially  sustainable,  the  project  will \nprovide  consulting  services  to  develop  (i)  a  station  access  management  system  and \nenforcement  measures  to  ensure  clear  pedestrian  access  and  proper  use  of  public  space  by \nvendors around the stations; (ii) a station parking policy to facilitate the efficient flow of vehicles \nto  and  from  the  metro  line  3  stations;  and  (iii)  a  policy  framework  on  public  transport  ticketing \nand  pricing  of  public  and  private  transport  in  Ha  Noi  to  promote  a  modal  shift  from  private \nvehicles  to  the  public  transport  system.  The  project  will  include  capacity  development  and \ntraining to enable the Ha Noi transport agencies to implement and enforce the new policies and \nregulations.  It  will  also  provide  equipment  and  consulting  services  to  establish  comprehensive \nmultimodal  transport  and  traffic  management  modeling  systems  that  will  be  used  to  develop \ndetailed pilot schemes to improve the integration of the public transport system.  \n \nD. \n \n11. \n The project is estimated to cost $58.95 million, consisting of $44.10 million in base costs \n(including  local  taxes  and  duties),  $13.70  million  for  contingencies,  and  $1.15  million  for \nfinancing  charges  during  construction  (Table  1).  The  investment  cost  will  include  civil  works \n(48.63%  of  the  total  cost),  systems  and  equipment  (30.26%  of  the  total  cost),  and  consulting \nservices  (16.71%  of  the  total  cost).

The combination of \nphysical infrastructure and policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms provided by the project is \nexpected to increase ridership on metro line 3 by more than 10% over current forecast ridership \nand reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 15% (equivalent to 540,000 tons of carbon \ndioxide over the project\u2019s 20-year lifetime) over emissions without these improvements. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nThe main economic benefits will be the reduction of travel time for public transport users \nthrough  improved  access  and  egress  at  metro  stations,  less  congestion  around  stations, \nenhanced comfort and convenience, and savings in vehicle operating costs due to an envisaged \nshift from private to public transport. A reduction in the congestion on city roads, improvements \nto  the  environment,  and  fewer  fatalities  from  accidents  involving  private  vehicles  will  be \nimportant  indirect  benefits,  even  though  they  are  minor  in  economic  terms.  The  economic \nanalysis  estimates  the  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  to  be  14.0%  when  only \nconsidering direct user impacts, and 17.2% when integrating indirect benefits, for an economic \nnet  present  value  discounted  at  12.0%  of  $15.2  million. 14 Sensitivity  testing  showed  that  the \neconomic internal rate of return would remain equal to or above 12% if (i) the capital costs rose \nby  not  more  than  30%  over  the  base-case  projection,  (ii)  the  projected  benefits  did  not  fall  by \nmore than 20%, or (iii) the capital costs rose by 15% and the project benefits fell by 15% at the \nsame time. \n \n21. \nThe  HPC  will  be  the  project  owner  and  will  be  responsible  for  operation  and \nmaintenance  after  project  completion.  Ha  Noi\u2019s  municipal  budget  is  financed  directly  through \nnational and city taxes, duties, and other revenue sources.15 The HPC will ensure assignment of \na  share  of  the  public  transport  funding  that  is  within  the  city\u2019s  budget  resources  for  operation \nand maintenance of the project components. The future financial position of the HPC confirms \nits  financial  capacity  to  cover  the  recurrent  expenditures  of  the  project  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of facilities developed under the project. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n22. \nLoan  disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements between the government, the \nHPC, and the DOT. The DOT will maintain separate financial records and accounts to identify \nfinancing  resources  received  and  project  expenditures,  including  goods,  works,  and  services \nfinanced  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  local  funds.  The  loan  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements will be audited annually, in accordance with sound auditing standards by an auditor \nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  made  public.  Details  on  disbursement,  auditing,  and  financial \nmanagement are provided in the project administration manual (footnote 11). \n \n\n                                                \n14 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 The city retains 28% of all national revenue against future budgetary support transfers from the Ministry of Finance. \n\n\fA  financial  management  assessment  found  that  the  DOT  has  acceptable  financial \n23. \nmanagement  capacity  and  experience  in  managing  and  implementing  similar  projects  but  has \nlimited experience and knowledge of ADB\u2019s financial management requirements. To improve its \nfinancial  management  capacity  for  implementing  the  project,  the  DOT  will  engage  external \nfinancial  management  consultants  to  provide  support  and  assistance  to  the  UTPMU.  The \nfinancial  management  consultants  will  train  the  UTPMU\u2019s  accounting  staff  in  ADB  loan \ndisbursement  procedures  and  financial  management  practices.  If  needed,  the  UTPMU  will \nensure  that  sufficient  accounting  staff  is  available  for  effective  financial  management  during \nimplementation by recruiting and/or mobilizing extra accountants. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  HPC,  and  the  DOT.  HPC  will  ensure  contracts  clearly  include  ADB \nright  to  examine  records  and  accounts,  and  complete  periodic  inspections  of  contractor \nactivities.  HPC  will  publicly  disclose  on  the  project  website  information  on  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds for procurement of each contract. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 11). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n25. \nA  social  action  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  project,  based  on  a  social  impact \nassessment.  Smooth  accessibility  to  the  metro  line  3  stations  and the  integration  of  the  metro \nwith  the  bus  system  and  other  modes  of  transport  will  benefit  women,  students,  children,  and \nolder people, who are identified as the primary users of public transport. The project will improve \neconomies in the metro line 3 localities by creating business opportunities, reducing congestion, \nimproving  quality  of  life  in  areas  around  stations,  and  developing  a  public  transport  pricing \nframework  to  make  fares  affordable.  The  six  project  districts  will  benefit  from  temporary \nconstruction jobs and local employment in operation and maintenance. \n \nGreater safety risks constitute a potential adverse social impact for the larger numbers of \n26. \npedestrians  expected  to  walk  along  roads  near  the  stations.  Pedestrian  safety  risks  will  be \nmitigated by providing footbridges and pedestrian subways and good traffic control around the \nstations. The detailed design will follow universal accessibility and pedestrian safety guidelines. \n \n27. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  action  plan \nensures  that  appropriate  physical  design  related  to  the  accessibility  of  rail,  metro,  and  bus \nservices  pays  attention  to  affordability  and  meets  the  various  travel  patterns  and  needs  of \nwomen.  Proposed  measures  include  (i)  accessibility  design  features  such  as  safe  pedestrian \naccess,  adequate  lighting,  and  installation  of  closed-circuit  TV  around  stations;  (ii)  priority \nseating and allocated waiting spaces for women; (iii) 30% of unskilled civil works jobs provided \nto  women;  (iv)  ticketing  and  fare  pricing  structured  to  increase  affordability  and  access; \n(v) pedestrian-friendly traffic management and traffic calming measures; and (vi) gender issues \nincorporated into all intermodal public transport policy and regulations.16 \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nUnder the ADB and Clean Technology Fund framework agreement, the requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) will apply to all project components financed by the \nADB  Clean  Technology  Fund.  The  project  is  assessed  category  B  for  environment.  The  initial \nenvironmental examination, which has been prepared in accordance with the Safeguard Policy \n\n                                                \n16  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fStatement, has been posted on ADB website on 10 November 2014.17 No natural ecosystems \nexist in the project area, which is heavily populated. Land use is predominantly commercial or \nresidential. The project will not involve major civil works and is not likely to result in significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts  during  construction  and  operation.  Public  consultations  with \naffected  people  were  conducted  during  preparation  of  the  initial  environmental  examination,  in \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements.  The  DOT  will \nensure that the environmental management plan is included in all bid documents.  \n \nA  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  prior  to  commencement  of  site \n29. \nworks. The construction supervision consultant will conduct environmental management training \nto help the DOT monitor and report on the environmental performance of contractors. \n \nThe  project  is  assessed  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Land  adjoining  Ngoc \n30. \nKhanh station will be provided unencumbered to the project in 2018. This land will be acquired \nunder the ADB-financed metro line 3 project (footnote 8) in full compliance with the Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement,  to  be  used  as  a  construction  work  area  by  a  contractor  under  the \naforementioned project. Resettlement due diligence of the project sites has indicated that there \nwill  be  no  other  involuntary  resettlement  impacts. 18 The  project  is  assessed  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples safeguards. \n  \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31. \nThe  project  faces  risks  related  to  its  innovative  character,  demands  on  executing  and \nimplementing agency capacity, dependence on timely execution by and coordination with other \nprojects, and need for effective transport reforms to fully achieve the project impact. These risks \nwill be mitigated through provision of international expert support to the DOT for development of \ndesigns, and project management. In view of the DOT\u2019s limited experience with ADB guidelines \nand  policies,  mitigation  measures  to  address  associated  public  financial  management  and \nprocurement  risks,  as  detailed  in  the  project  administration  manual  (footnote 11),  will  require \nclose monitoring to ensure effective implementation of proposed support measures. \n \n32. \nThe project must be sequenced with implementation progress on the metro line 3. The \nimplementation  delay  risk  this  poses  will  be  mitigated  through  the  government\u2019s  institutional \narrangements,  project  management  support,  and  coordination  with  development  partners \nsupporting public transport investments in Ha Noi. Because the viability of the project relies on \nachieving  the  passenger  levels  and  patronage  projected  for  the  metro  line  3,  insufficient \ngovernment  commitment  to  implementing  the  policy  and  regulatory  reforms  in  promoting  a \nmodal  shift  from  private  to  public  transport  is  a  key  risk.  This  will  be  mitigated  by  providing \nadvisory  services  and  training  to  public  transport  agencies  on modernizing  and  integrating the \npublic  transport  system.  The  HPC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  its  plans  to  modernize  the \ncity\u2019s  bus  fleet  and  its  operations  and  to  provide  efficient  links  and  an  effective  interchange \nsystem with the new metro lines are developed on time. Corruption risk will be mitigated through \nan  action  plan  to  ensure  identified  accountable  agencies  comply  with  tasks,  making  project \ninformation more publicly available, strengthening financial management and internal audits will \nbe segregated from project management. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.19 Overall,  the  benefits  and  positive \nimpacts of the project are expected to outweigh any mitigation costs. \n\n                                                \n17 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Resettlement Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n33. \nThe  government  and  the  HPC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government and the HPC have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project \nagreements. \n \n34. \n\nThe following conditions for effectiveness are expected for the project: \n (i)   \n\nThe ADB Clean Technology Fund loan agreement shall have been duly executed \nand  delivered  on  behalf  of  the  government,  and  all  conditions  precedent  to  its \neffectiveness shall have been fulfilled. \nThe  ADB  Special  Funds  resources  loan  agreement  shall  have  been  duly \nexecuted  and  delivered  on  behalf  of  the  government,  and  all  conditions \nprecedent to its effectiveness shall have been fulfilled.  \nThe project agreement shall have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of \nthe HPC, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness (other than a condition \nrequiring the effectiveness of the loan agreement) shall have been fulfilled. \n\n (ii)  \n\n (iii)  \n\n \n35. \nThe following condition for disbursement of CTF loan amount is expected for the project: \nThe  subsidiary  loan  agreement  shall  have  been  duly  executed  and  delivered  on  behalf  of  the \ngovernment  and  the  executing  agency  upon  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  all \nconditions precedent to its effectiveness shall have been fulfilled.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n36. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR2,810,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for the Strengthening Sustainable Urban Transport for Ha \nNoi  Metro Line 3 Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 2% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for a \nterm of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements presented to the Board; and \nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  the  loan  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$48,950,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Strengthening \nSustainable Urban Transport for Ha Noi Metro Line 3 Project, to be provided by \nthe ADB Clean Technology Fund.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nBindu N.
