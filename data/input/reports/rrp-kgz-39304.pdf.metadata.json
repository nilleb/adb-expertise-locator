The  Project  will \n\n \nThe  Second  Education  Project  (the  Project)  will  build  on  past \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to  continue  to \nenhance the quality of, and participation in, primary (grades 1\u20134) \nand  general  secondary  (grades  5\u201311)  education.  It  will  help  the \nGovernment deliver education to children in poor areas and from \ndisadvantaged \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  in  modernizing  the  curriculum  with  a \nstudent-centered  approach  linked  with  developing  an  improved \nlearning  assessment  system  and  a  new  generation  of  textbooks \nand  learning  materials;  (ii)  strengthen  in-service  teacher  training \nand  incentives  for  teachers  in  rural  areas;  and  (iii) rehabilitate \nfacilities and provide educational equipment for 90 priority schools \nin rural areas, to improve the learning environment. \n \nEconomic  transition  has  had  major  implications  for  the  quality  of \neducation  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Despite  high  educational \nattainment  and  near  universal  literacy  during  the  Soviet  period, \nthe education system currently needs considerable investment to \nimprove quality, access and participation, and to help the country \nsustain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for education. \nMajor  problems  in  the  education  sector  arise  from  the  current \ncurriculum,  the  state  of  the  teaching  profession,  and  limited \naccess to education in rural areas. The current curriculum differs \nsomewhat  from  the  Soviet  one  but  continues  the  tradition  of \nheavily \nsubjects.  The  development  and \nimplementation  of  a  revised  curriculum  require  a  new  generation \nof textbooks and learning materials that reflect it. The shortage of \nteachers  in  some  schools,  aging  of  the  teaching  corps,  and \ninability  of  the  education  system  to  provide  adequate  in-service \ntraining are key constraints to improving the quality of education. \nAll  three  problems  stem  from  insufficient  funding,  resultant  low \nsalaries for teachers, and the teaching profession\u2019s consequently \ndeclining  incentives,  morale,  and  motivation.  Rural  schools  are \ndilapidated,  lack  learning  materials  and  equipment,  and  suffer \nattendance problems. \n\ncontent-based \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nGrant Amount \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \n \n\nfrom  different \n\nlevels  of  government, \n\nCommitment  to  improving  both  the  quality  and  effectiveness  of \neducation  is  a  key  element  of  the  Government's  economic \nstrategy.  The  overall  development  plans  and  strategies  for  the \neducation  sector  to  2010  are  reflected  in  the  national  Education \nDevelopment Concept. The Ministry of Education (MOE) places a \nhigh  priority  on  developing  an  education  system  that  will  provide \nknowledge and skills to meet the demands of a market economy.  \n \nThe  Project  will  build  on  the  achievements  of  the  ADB-financed \nEducation  Sector  Development  Program.  Sustainability  of  the \nproject  achievements  will  be  ensured  through  broad  stakeholder \nparticipation \nlocal \ncommunities,  the  private  sector,  donors,  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  a  general  education  system \nresponsive  to  the  needs  of  a  modern  market-oriented  economy \nand focused on poorer areas of the country. The outcomes of the \nProject are increased enrollment in primary and general education \nin poorer areas and student performance raised. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $21.85  million \nequivalent  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes,  and \nduties.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $4.78  million \nequivalent, or 22% of the total cost, with the local currency cost at \n$17.07 million equivalent, or 78%. \n \n \n\n  \nSource \nAsian  \nDevelopment Bank        4.78 \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\n($ million) \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nPercent \n \n\n       10.72 \n\n     15.50 \n\n      71  \n\nGovernment \n\n       0.00 \n\n         6.35 \n\n       6.35 \n\n      29  \n\n    100  \n\n       4.78 \n\n      21.85 \n\n       17.07 \n\n \nTotal \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n \nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $15.50  million  equivalent  from  its \nSpecial Funds resources to finance 71% of the total project cost. \nThe  remaining  $6.35  million  equivalent,  or  29%,  will  be  provided \nby the Government. Grant financing for the Project is considered \njustified  because  of  its  focus  on  basic  (primary  and  secondary) \neducation,  and  the  fact  that  a  significant  part  of  the  investment \ntargets poor and remote areas. \n \nUntil 30 June 2011 \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n31 December 2010 \n\nthrough \n\n \nMinistry of Education \n \nA  national  project  steering  council  will  provide  overall  strategic \npolicy  guidance,  monitor  implementation,  and  ensure  donor \ncoordination.  The  first  deputy  minister  of  MOE  will  be  project \ndirector and coordinate overall implementation of project activities. \nA  central  project  implementation  unit  headed  by  a  project \nmanager  will  be  established  to  coordinate  day-to-day  project \nactivities.  Two  regional  project  implementation  units  headed  by \nregional  project  coordinators  will  be  located  in  oblast  (province) \ndepartments  of  education  and  will  be  responsible  for  project \nactivities in oblasts. \n \nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Procurement  of  civil \nworks  will  be  carried  out  through  local  competitive  bidding. \nProcurement  of  equipment  will  be \ninternational \ncompetitive  bidding,  and  local  competitive  bidding  satisfactory  to \nADB, and by direct purchase. \n \nThe  Project  will  contract  81  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  791  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services.  These  will  include  experts  in  the  fields  of \npolicy research and evaluation, curriculum and learning materials \ndesign, \ntraining,  procurement, \nfinance,  civil  engineering,  project  management,  accounting, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  and  translation.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. \n \nDirect  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  50,000  students  and \n1,500 teachers and school administrators in the 90 priority schools \nselected,  who  will  benefit  from  a  significantly  improved  learning \nenvironment. Teachers throughout the country will benefit from in-\nservice  teacher  training  programs.  Staff  of  teacher  training \ninstitutes  throughout  the  country  will  benefit  from  their  enhanced \ncapacity and upgraded teaching facilities. Nationwide, 1.14 million \nstudents  will  benefit  from  an  improved  curriculum  and  better \nlearning materials and assessment systems. \n \n\nlearning  assessment, \n\nteacher \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nBenefits will include the improved quality of education in terms of \nteaching and learning standards. The new curriculum and learning \nassessment system  will create an enabling environment to  equip \na new generation of workforce entrants with knowledge and skills \nin  line  with  the  needs  of  a  market  economy.  The  Project  will \nenhance  efficiency \nin  school  management,  particularly  by \nreducing  the  costs  of  utilities  and  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M). \n \nImplementation Capacity Risk. The risk exists that responsibilities \nor  tasks  required  will  be  beyond  the  capabilities  of  the  staff \nmembers  to  which  they  have  been  assigned.  The  risk  will  be \nmitigated through training and capacity building. \n \nSector  Policy  Risk.  Policy  impact  will  be  significant  with  the \nintroduction of a new curriculum and learning assessment system \nreflecting the Government\u2019s priority to improve access to, and the \nquality  of,  education  and  converting  to  a  12-year  system  of \neducation.  Risks  include  resistance  from  decision  makers  to \nrecommended  policy  or  legislative  changes,  and  from  parents  or \nthe  community  at  large  to  new  and  unfamiliar  innovations  in  the \ncurriculum  and  learning  assessment  system.  The  risk  will  be \nmitigated  by  adopting  a  stakeholder  participatory  approach  and \nimplementing  a  public  awareness  campaign  that  includes  the \nactive involvement of local communities and NGOs.  \n \nFinancial  Sustainability  Risk.  Financial  risk  arises  from  the \npossible  inability  of  national  or  local  government  to  provide  the \nto  ensure  effective  project \ncounterpart  resources  required \nimplementation,  or  to  provide  for  incremental  recurrent  costs  for \nO&M during implementation and after project completion. The risk \nmay \nlack  of \n(ii)  discontinued  dissemination  of  new \nmaintenance;  and \ntextbooks  and  learning  materials,  teaching  methodologies,  and \nlearning  assessment  systems  after  the  project  ends.  To  mitigate \nthe  risk,  ADB  will  work  closely  with  the  Government  to  ensure \nadequate  resource  allocation  for  the  education  sector,  project \ncounterpart funds, and incremental recurrent costs for O&M, and \nappropriate assurances are included. \n\nto  (i)  deterioration  of \n\nfacilities  due \n\nlead \n\nto \n\n\f42  30'No\n\nDzhergalan\n\n42  30'No\n\no\n\n71  00'E\n\no\n78  00'E\n\nKYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\nSECOND EDUCATION PROJECT\n\nK A Z A K H S T A N\n\nShopokov\n\nKara Balta\n\nBISHKEK\n\nTokmok\n\nCholpon-Ata\n\nCHUI\n\nBalykchy\n\n- K u l\n\nk\n\ny\n\ns\n\ns\n\nI\n\ne  \n\nL a k\n\nKochkorka\n\nTyup\n\nKara Kol\n\nISSYK-KUL\n\nChaek\n\nLake Song-Kul\n\nNARYN\n\nNaryn\n\nLake Chatyr-Kul\n\nN\n\nMaimak\n\nTalas\n\nTALAS\n\nTerek Sai\n\nToktogul\n\nToktogul Reservoir\n\nKarakul\nJALAL-ABAD\n\nTash Kumyr\n\nShamaldy Sai\n\nKok Yangak\n\nKochkor Ata\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nJalal-Abad\n\nAndizhan Reservoir\n\nKara Su\n\nUzgen\n\nOsh\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\nBatken\n\nFrunze\n\n38  00'No\n\nNaiman\n\nKyzyl Kiya\n\nOSH\n\nSulyukta\n\nBATKEN\n\nHaidarkan\n\nSary Tash\n\nPEOPLE'S    REPUBLIC\nOF   CHINA \n\n38  00'No\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n78  00'Eo\n\n0\n5\n-\n4\n0\n8\n8\n \nR\nM\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\no\n\n71  00'E\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \n\n1. \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the Second Education Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nIn 2001, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic requested from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) technical assistance1 (TA) for preparing the Second Education Project (the Project) \nas a follow-up to the Education Sector Development Program (ESDP).2 The Project is included \nin the 2004 Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132006,3 which prioritizes investments in \neducation and early childhood development as important means of achieving poverty reduction. \nThe project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe  education  system  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  follows  the  Soviet  model  of  11  years  of \n3. \ngeneral  education.  Primary  education  (grades  1\u20134)  begins  at  age  6  or  7.  Lower  secondary \n(basic)  education  comprises  grades  5\u20139.  Basic  education  is  compulsory.  Upper  secondary \neducation  includes  grades  10\u201311.  The  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  is  responsible  for  setting \neducation  policy  and  standards,  and  it  controls  implementation  through  oblast  (province) \ndepartments  of  education  and  raion  (district)  departments  of  education.  Aiyil  okmotu  (village \nauthorities)  administer  their  schools  and  are  responsible  for  allocating  resources  for  school \noperation and maintenance (O&M). The structure of the education system is in Appendix 2. \n \n4. \nThere  are  2,045  general  education  schools  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  of  which  351  are \nurban  and  1,694  rural.  Of  these,  1,614  schools  used  a  single  language  of  instruction  (Kyrgyz, \nRussian,  or  Uzbek)  in  2004,  and  431  schools  used  two  or  more  languages  of  instruction \n(Kyrgyz,  Russian,  Uzbek,  and/or  Tajik).  In  school  year  (SY)  2004,  most  general  education \nschools\u20141,525,  or  75%\u2014operated  in  two  shifts.  In  addition,  105  schools  with  a  total  of  about \n18,100 students operated in three shifts. The number of children with special needs in inclusive \nclasses was 250 in SY2004. An analysis of the education sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n5. \nThe education reforms started in the Kyrgyz Republic in 1993, emphasizing accessibility \nfor all children without exception.4 Following independence in 1991, macroeconomic conditions \nin  the  Kyrgyz  Republic deteriorated  dramatically,  resulting  in  a  50%  decline  in  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP). In 1996, these trends reversed, and annual economic growth averaged 5% from \n1997  to  2004.  Economic  transition  has  had  major  implications  for  the  financing  of  education. \nThe  education  budget  declined  sharply  in  the  early  1990s  and  gradually  started  to  increase \nagain in 1999. In real terms, education expenditure was increased gradually from $63.7 million \nin 1999 to $91.4 million in 2004, and it is projected to increase about 2% annually in 2005\u20132007. \nBy share of GDP, education expenditure has increased gradually from 4.0% in 1999 to 4.3% in \n2004, and it is expected to exceed 5.0% by 2010. Education expenditure as percentage of the \nnational  budget  varied  from  a  low  of  19.8%  in  2000  to  a  high  of  22.2%  in  2003  but  is \nconsistently the largest single item in the national budget. \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n3   ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update: the Kyrgyz Republic. Manila. \n4   Kyrgyz Parliament. 1993. The Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, Article 32. Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic. \n\n\f2 \n\nIn 2003, the estimated population of the Kyrgyz Republic was 5.1 million, of whom 45% \n6. \nwere between 5 and 19 years of age and 70% lived in rural areas, where poverty is prevalent. \nGovernment\u2019s statistics indicate that, in 2003, 40% of the urban population and 47% of the rural \npopulation lived in poverty. The widening poverty gap significantly disadvantages children from \nrural areas in terms of access to basic education and its quality. \n \n7. \nIn  SY2003,  97.8%  of  boys  and  95.8%  of  girls  of  school  age  were  enrolled  in  primary \nschools, for a gross enrollment rate of 96.8%. Lower secondary enrollment was 92.8% (92.6% \nof boys and 93.0% of girls). Upper secondary enrollment was 72.0% (68% of boys and 76.1% of \ngirls). \n \n8. \nCommitment  to  improving  both  the  quality  and  the  effectiveness  of  education  is  a  key \nelement of the Government's economic strategy. The overall development plans and strategies \nfor  the  education  sector  are  reflected  in  the  national  Education  Development  Concept  to  the \nYear  2010.5  MOE  emphasizes  developing  an  education  system  that  provides  students  with \nknowledge  and  skills  to  meet  the  demands  of  a  market-oriented  economy.  Despite  high \neducational  attainment  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  with  near  universal  literacy  during  the  Soviet \nperiod,  the  education  system  currently  needs  considerable  investment  to  improve  quality, \naccess,  and  participation,  and  to  help  the  country  sustain  its  achievement  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) for education. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nPrimary and General Secondary Education Subsector Issues \n\n \nNeed for a New Curriculum.6 Prior to independence, the curriculum was consistent with \n9. \nthat of the Soviet Union. Following independence, the Kyrgyz Republic revised the curriculum in \n1992.  Notable  among  the  many  minor  changes  since  1992  are  the  introduction  of  foreign \nlanguages into primary school, the replacement of environmental studies with homeland studies \nand  of  Soviet  history  with  that  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  the  introduction  of  information  and \ncommunications  technology  (ICT)  courses,  as  well  as  of  ethics.  A  set  of  state  educational \nstandards, developed in 1996 and subsequently revised in 2002 and 2004, are still in draft form \nawaiting the Government\u2019s consideration. The current curriculum comprises 24 subjects. While \nit  differs  somewhat  from  the  old  Soviet  curriculum,  particularly  persistent  is  the  tradition  of \nheavily content-based subjects. \n \n10.  MOE  is  considering  lengthening  the  general  education  system  to  12  years  from  the \npresent  11  years  and  the  question  of  whether  the  proposed  additional  year  would  follow  the \nexisting 11 years or precede it as an additional preschool year. The need is urgent to introduce \na modern curriculum that not only reflects the national context of education but also ensures a \nstudent-centered  approach,  supported  by  modern  learning  materials  and  a  modern  learning-\nassessment system, and implemented by highly qualified educators. \n \n11. \nNeed  for  Textbooks  and  New  Learning  Materials.  After  independence,  there  was  a \nmajor shortage of textbooks. The ESDP addressed the urgent need for textbooks by procuring \n3.35  million  copies  of  textbooks  and  teachers\u2019  guides  and  establishing  a  basis  for  the \n                                                 \n5  Ministry of Education and Culture of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2002. The National Education Development Concept to \n\nthe Year 2010. Bishkek  \n\n6  \u201cCurriculum\u201d as used here includes the overall aims of learning, general objectives by level of education, curriculum \nframework  (subjects  and  hours  by  grade  level),  and  subject  curriculum  (topics,  detailed  learning  objectives, \nindicative teaching methods, and assessment methods).   \n\n\ftextbooks.  However, \n\nthe  development  and \ncompetitive  development  and  printing  of \nimplementation  of  a  new  curriculum  requires  a  new  generation  of  textbooks  and  learning \nmaterials that reflect the new curriculum and provide a resource base for learning. Successfully \ndeveloping,  publishing,  and  distributing  new  textbooks  and  learning  materials  requires  several \neffort.  At  present,  the  Kyrgyz  Academy  of  Education  (KAE)  is  responsible  for  developing  the \ncurriculum and textbooks and learning materials in all curriculum subjects, at all grades, in the \nfour  approved  languages  of  instruction;  generating  authors\u2019  manuscripts;  and  approving \ntextbooks and learning materials. This creates a conflict of interest and is not conducive to the \nrobust  and  effective  production  and  distribution  of  textbooks  and  learning  materials.  The \nGovernment  urgently  needs  to  separate  these  four  functions.  Improvements  are  required  to \nattract  and  train  qualified  textbook  authors  drawn  from  a  pool  of  proficient  educators  that \nincludes current teachers and is not limited to academics who do not actively teach in schools. \nTraining  is  needed  for  curriculum  developers  and  textbook  authors  to  ensure  better  textbooks \nand learning materials that consistently reflect the revised curriculum. \n \n12. \nThe Government policy is to provide textbooks and learning materials to all students in \ngeneral education (grades 1\u201311) in the four approved languages of instruction: Kyrgyz, Russian, \nTajik, and  Uzbek.  Out  of  1.144  million  students  enrolled  in 2004,  716,572  use  Kyrgyz  as  their \nlanguage  of  instruction,  273,223  use  Russian,  151,163  use  Uzbek,  and  only  3,078  use  Tajik. \nMost  of  the  materials  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  have  been  translated  from  Russian,  with  the \nnotable  exceptions  of  textbooks  on  the  history  and  geography  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  which \nwere developed under the ESDP. In the years immediately following independence, textbooks \nin  Uzbek  and  Tajik  were  imported  from  Uzbekistan7  and  Tajikistan.  The  Osh  Center  of \nAdaptation  of  Textbooks  in  the  Uzbek  language  was  engaged  under  the  ESDP  to  develop \ntextbooks for students studying in Uzbek in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n13. \nFree  distribution  of  textbooks  to  enrolled  students  was  discontinued  in  1994  due  to \nsevere  constraints  on  expenditures.  In  1999,  the  Government,  with  support  from  the  ESDP, \nintroduced a textbook rental scheme (TRS) to address the resulting problems of access to and \naffordability  of  textbooks,  in  particular  for  the  poor.  Under  the  TRS,  textbooks  are  rented  to \nstudents for Som15 ($0.37) per book per year in Bishkek city and Chui oblast, and for Som12 \n($0.29) elsewhere in the country, with a waiver of rental fees for students whose parents cannot \nafford  to  pay.  The  TRS  is  complex  and  needs  reform  to  make  it  more  effective.  The  World \nBank\u2019s  Rural  Education  Project  (REP)8  is  supporting  Government  efforts  to  further  refine  the \nTRS and develop commercial textbook production initiated under the ESDP. It is envisaged that \na textbook approval board independent of KAE will be established under the REP. \n \n14. \nAlmost all schools in the country lack learning aids, including maps, didactic materials, \nscience  models,  and  globes,  as  their  provision  has  been  discontinued  since  1991  for  lack  of \nfunds. Several pilot schools received learning aids for science and language classes under the \nESDP, but unmet demand for learning aids remains high. \n \n15. \nNeed  to  Upgrade  Learning  Assessment.  Few  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  recognize  the \nneed for different assessment strategies, their purpose, or how they can help improve students\u2019 \neducation.  No  clear  assessment  policy  exists.  Continuous  assessment  conducted  in  schools \nfocuses on developing retentive memories and measures the knowledge that the students have \n                                                 \n7   As  Uzbekistan  now  uses  the  Roman  alphabet,  importing  Uzbek  learning  materials  is  impossible  because  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  still  uses  the  Cyrillic  alphabet.  In  any  case,  textbooks  and  learning  materials  produced  in \nUzbekistan neither meet the requirements of the national curriculum nor were written from the cultural and social \nperspective of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n\n8   World Bank. 2004. Rural Education Project. Washington, DC. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nreceived. These assessments are mostly diagnostic in that they identify what the students are \nunable to do. Student grades are used to judge the quality of education provided by schools, so \nit is in the interest of the school management to ensure that all students receive passing grades. \nThis practice needs to be changed by upgrading teachers\u2019 classroom learning assessment skills \nand  providing  them  with  skills  for  a  student-centered,  active  learning  approach  and \nmethodology. \n \n16.  While  competent  academically,  teachers  have  little  knowledge  of  student-centered \nteaching methods. Teachers do not express dissatisfaction with traditional assessment systems \nand need to be convinced of the value of new methods, as well as provided with training support \nwhen shown new methods of classroom assessment. It will be a challenge for the Government \nto  introduce  new  assessment  methods,  integrate  them  into  a  new  curriculum,  and  facilitate \nacceptance.  To  ensure  the  institutionalization  and  sustainability  of  local  capacity,  programs  in \neducation  assessment  are  needed  to  develop  expertise  at  in-service  teacher  training \ninstitutions. Initially, this will require external degree training for a selection of MOE staff as the \nbasis  for  strengthening  in-country  training.  A  public  awareness  campaign  is  needed  to  ensure \npublic  acceptance  and  stakeholder  understanding  of  the  new  curriculum  and  learning \nassessment system, and to ensure their successful implementation. \n \n17.  Weak  Incentives  for  the  Teaching  Profession.  The  shortage  of  qualified  teachers, \nparticularly in rural schools,  an aging teaching corps, and the inability of the education system \nto provide adequate in-service training are key constraints on improving the quality of education. \nAll three problems stem from insufficient funding, the resultant low salaries for teachers, and the \nconsequent declining incentives, morale, and motivation within the teaching profession. A large \nand increasing number of teachers are over the age of 45. Recruiting qualified new teachers to \nreplace retirees is proving difficult primarily due to very low salaries. Salaries for teachers and \nprincipals are usually well below the average monthly wage, and even the top monthly salary of \nSom9769 ($23.8) is below the poverty level of Som1,144 ($27.9) calculated using the minimum \nconsumer basket approach. Salary increases for teachers are critically important for improving \nteacher  morale  and  attracting  young  teachers,  particularly  to  schools  in  rural  areas.  The \nGovernment increased teachers\u2019 salaries by 15% in April 2004 and a further increase of almost \n15% was approved in October 2004, leading to a cumulative increase of 30% in 2004. However, \nteachers\u2019 salaries remain very low, and teachers are reluctant to undertake assignments in rural \nschools. Teachers also have little motivation to improve their performance, as doing so does not \nbring  salary  increases  or  other  forms  of  professional  recognition.  A  new  promotion  scheme \nbased on performance will be supported under the World Bank\u2019s REP. \n \n18. \nInadequate  Supply  of  Teachers.  The  distribution  of  teachers  is  uneven  both \ngeographically  and  by  subject  area.  National  statistics  indicate  sufficient  teachers  in  primary \nschools. Overall student-teacher ratios were 15.7:1 in 2002 and 15.5:1 in 2003. Numbers range \nfrom 12.9:1 in Naryn oblast to 19.0:1 in Bishkek. Serious shortages of teachers affect schools in \npoorer and more remote raions. Teacher shortages by subject area occur at the secondary level \nbut  not  the  primary  level.  A  2003  study  conducted  by  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF)  found  that,  on  average,  half  of  the  needed  classes  in  mathematics,  chemistry, \ngeography,  physics,  biology,  foreign  languages,  and  ICT  were  not  conducted  due  to  teacher \nshortages in rural areas. Teacher shortages often arise from the inability of the education sector \nto compete with the private sector in attracting personnel with such skills. \n\n                                                 \n9    The  public  service  salary  scale  has  23  levels  from  Som160  ($3.9)  to  Som1,280  ($31)  per  month.  Teachers  and \nprincipals  fall  in  the  range  receiving  Som720\u2013Som976  per  month.  World  Bank.  2004.  Report  of  the  Teacher \nDevelopment Specialist. Washington, DC.    \n\n\fIn 2004, 2,300 teachers graduated from pre-service teacher training institutions, but only \n19. \n1,050 new graduates entered the teaching profession. In the same year, the education system \nrequired  3,084  new  teachers.  Continued  efforts  are  needed  to  make  the  teaching  profession \nmore  attractive  by  improving  teachers\u2019  remuneration,  providing  support  through  various \nincentives,  and  upgrading  teachers\u2019  qualifications  and  skills.  Key  issues  for  review  include \nintroducing promotion based on performance rather than seniority, as well as incentives for new \ngraduates and current teachers to teach in rural areas. \n \nLack  of  In-Service  Teacher  Training.  National  coordination  of  teacher  training  is  the \n20. \nresponsibility  of  the  National  Institute  for  Raising  the  Qualifications  of  Teachers  and  Teacher \nTraining  (NTTI)  under  KAE.  In  oblasts,  in-service  teacher  training  is  handled  by  a  network  of \nseven  teacher  training  institutes  (TTIs).  MOE  finances  in-service  training  conducted  by  NTTI, \nwhile  oblast  in-service  training  is  financed  mainly  through  oblast  administration  budgets.  In \nsome cases, there are limited fee-paying programs. In other cases, oblast governments pay the \ntraining  cost  by  allocating  funds  directly  to  TTIs,  but  travel,  subsistence,  and  accommodation \nexpenses  are  paid  by  the  teachers  themselves.  Rural  teachers  cannot  meet  such  expenses \nfrom a monthly salary of about $19 equivalent. The ESDP addressed the most urgent need for \nteacher  training  by  training  7,000  teachers  nationwide  but  did  not  address  the  need  to \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  TTIs.  Due  to  budget  constraints,  oblasts  have  had  limited  funds  to \nequip  TTIs,  which  struggle  to  support  adequate  in-service  teacher  training.  At  all  oblast  TTIs, \nICT  training  facilities  and  language  laboratories  are  poorly  equipped  or  nonexistent.  TTIs  in \nBishkek are only marginally better equipped. Urgent support is needed for TTIs in all oblasts. \n \n21. \nInadequate  Access  and  Participation  in  Rural  Schools.  Despite  recent  progress, \naccess  to  and  participation  in  education  remains  a  problem,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  In \nSY2004,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  1,694  rural  schools  (82%  of  all  schools  in  the  country)  served \n816,337  students  (70%  of  all  students).  The  enrollment  rate  in  general  education  rose  from \n86.9%  in  1998  to  90.6%  in  2002,  but  in  primary  schools  enrollment  declined  from  98.7%  to \n96.8%  in  the  same  period.  The  drop  was  steepest  for  boys,  from  98.1%  to  95.8%.  Rates  for \ngrades 5\u20139 rose from 82.6% to 92.8%, and for grades 10\u201311 from 70.6% to 72.0%. \n \n22.  MOE  statistics  indicate  that  the  total  number  of  children  not  attending  school  declined \nfrom  3,516  in  SY2001  to  1,344  in  SY2004.  However,  many  enrolled  students  do  not  attend \nschool  for  extended  periods.  A  study  conducted  by  UNICEF10  in  1999  indicates  that  this  is \nparticularly  true  for  students  in  poor,  remote,  and  mountainous  areas.  Declining  attendance \nrates can, like the poor quality of education, be attributed to the inferior condition of schools and \nlack of learning materials, aids, and equipment. In addition, children from poor families drop out \nof  school  in  grade  7  or  8  to  help  support  to  the  household.  These  hidden  dropouts  from  the \nsystem reflect serious participation and efficiency problems. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n \n23. \nThe  Project  will  build  on  the  achievements  of  the  ESDP,  the  first  external  assistance \nprovided  to  the  Government  in  the  education  sector.  The  ESDP  addressed  priority  needs  by \nhelping the Government implement (i) urgent policy reforms in education finance through TRS \nand other policy actions,  (ii) policy planning by rationalizing MOE staffing and enhancing sector \nmanagement  to  improve  its  efficiency,  (iii)  a  policy  framework  to  tackle  immediate  issues  of \nquality  and  relevance  in  basic  education  by  allowing  private  sector  participation  in  the \n\n                                                 \n10  UNICEF  and  Center  for  Public  Opinion  Studies  and  Forecast.  2003.

Bishkek. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n3. \n\nproduction  of  textbooks,  and  (iv)  a  social  sector  assistance  mechanism  to  help  poor  families \nenroll their children in basic and early childhood education. The ESDP\u2019s capacity development \nstrengthened  MOE\u2019s  capability  to  implement  externally  funded  projects.  Key  investment \nactivities  focused  on  (i)  providing  3.35  million  textbooks,  (ii)  developing  a  few  new  textbook \ntitles,  (iii)  providing  library  materials,  (iv)  training  over  7,000  teachers  and  306  school \nadministrative  staff,  and  (v)  upgrading  the  deteriorated  facilities  of  192  schools.  An  education \nmanagement information system (EMIS) was established and is fully operational. \n \nThe  Project  will  build  on  the  ESDP\u2019s  achievements  and  focus  on  (i)  modernizing  the \n24. \ncurriculum,  developing  learning  materials  for  the  new  curriculum,  and  modernizing  learning \nassessment  to  promote  a  student-centered  teaching  process;  (ii)  comprehensively  supporting \nteachers  and  school  principals  by  strengthening  in-service  teacher  training  and  incentives,  in \nparticular to attract teachers to rural areas; and (iii) upgrading schools in rural and poor areas by \nrehabilitating facilities and providing equipment and learning aids. \n \n25. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  target  poor  communities  by  expanding  and  ensuring  their \naccess to education, particularly for children from poor families in rural areas. Nationwide, the \nProject  will  bring  about  changes  to  improve  the  quality  of  education  and  assist  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  sustain  the  achievement  of  education  MDGs.  The  sustainability  of \nproject achievements will be ensured through broad stakeholder participation from all levels of \ngovernment,  local  communities,  the  private  sector,  donors,  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs). \n \n \n \n26. \nThe  project  design  takes  into  consideration  experience  gained  in  implementing  the \nESDP and the Social Services Delivery and Finance Project.11 The ESDP was initially impeded \nby MOE counterparts\u2019 and project staff members\u2019 unfamiliarity with ADB operational procedures \nand guidelines. It was impeded throughout by the high turnover of counterpart and project staff, \nincluding frequent changes of project manager. Experience gained under ESDP and the Social \nServices  Delivery  and  Finance  Project  highlighted  the  importance  of  staff  continuity  to  ensure \nsustainable capacity building and effective implementation. \n \n27. \nA  second  lesson  learned  relates  to  the  importance  of  coordinating  with  other  donors \nactive  in  the  education  sector.  Stronger  donor  coordination  and  information  sharing  in  future \nprojects should be assured through various interagency mechanisms, including the International \nAdvisory Council on Education,12 established in 2003 by MOE and including all donors working \nin the country\u2019s education sector. \n \n28. \nDeclining  enrollment  and  attendance  rates  and  the  poor  quality  of  education  can  be \nattributed in part to the poor condition of school buildings and facilities. The ESDP focused on \nrehabilitating heating systems, which was justified given the condition of schools and resource \nconstraints prevailing when the ESDP was appraised. However, the experience highlighted the \nimportance of a more comprehensive approach to school rehabilitation (insulation of windows, \nroof and floor repair, and sanitation improvements) to ensure an improved learning environment, \nextended school lifespan and reduced O&M costs. Further lessons learned from the ESDP are \n                                                 \n11  ADB.  1998.

Manila. \n\n12  ADB  was  invited  by  the  Government  to  chair  the  International  Advisory  Council  on  Education  from  its \nestablishment, reflecting ADB\u2019s role as the lead donor in the education sector. In October 2004, the MOE took over \nchairing the Council. \n\n\f4. \n\nGovernment Policy \n\nthe need to ensure that (i) oblast administrations make adequate budgetary provision to cover \nthe cost of ICT equipment in schools, and (ii) the necessary infrastructure is in place prior to the \nprovision of ICT equipment. \n \n \n \n29. \nThe  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  for  2003\u20132005  is  a  medium-term  plan  to \nimplement the country development framework until 2010. It was prepared by the Government, \nin close consultation with civil society, as a framework for development. Both the strategy and \nthe  framework  identify  poverty  reduction  as  the  overarching  objective  and  emphasize \nparticipation and access to education as a priority toward reducing poverty. The Medium-Term \nBudget  Framework  (2005\u20132007)13  sets  out  parameters  for  midterm  annual  budgets  and \nindicates that the education sector is one of four priority sectors. \n \n30. \nThe Law on Education, the Education Development Concept until 2010, and the National \nAction Plan on Education for All define the framework for the Government\u2019s policy and strategy \nin  developing  education  and  set  goals.  The  Law  on  Education  was  adopted  in  2003  and \nmandates  primary  and  secondary  education  for  all  citizens.  The  National  Action  Plan  on \nEducation  for  All  includes  primary  and  secondary  education  and  aims  to  ensure  universal \nenrollment  by  encouraging  students  not  to  drop  out,  promoting  inclusion,  fostering  innovation, \nimproving  the  curriculum  and  textbooks,  upgrading  facilities  and  equipment,  strengthening \ncommunity  and  parental  participation,  improving  assessment,  and  introducing  certification \nsystems. \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n \n31. \nADB has been the primary source of external support for the education sector since the \nmid-1990s.  Assistance  has  included  program  and  project  loans  for  the  ESDP  (footnote  2), \napproved  in  1997  with  cofinancing  from  the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries\u2019 \nOPEC  Fund  for  International  Development,  which  supported  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reforms \nand initial improvements in delivering education. The Social Services Development and Finance \nProject,14 which was approved in 1998, provided support for rehabilitating education and health \nfacilities  in  Jalal-Abad  and  Osh  oblasts.  The  Community-Based  Early  Childhood  Development \nProject,15 which was approved in 2003, focuses on improving health, nutrition, and educational \ndevelopment  for  children  between  birth  and  8 years  of  age  in  the  12  poorest  raions  of  the \ncountry. External assistance to the sector is reported in Appendix 4. \n \n32. \nThe World Bank designed its REP (footnote 8) in close coordination with ADB and used \nthe findings of ADB\u2019s feasibility study for the Project. The REP was approved in 2004 and aims \nto (i) improve teacher incentives, including the development of a performance-based promotion \nsystem and fellowships to attract new teachers; (ii) provide school grants for improved learning \nin the pilot oblasts of Issyk-Kul and Talas; (iii) revise the TRS and reprint textbooks and learning \nmaterials  to  cover  the  immediate  needs  of  primary  and  lower  secondary  schools;  and  (iv) \ndevelop  sample-based  national  student  assessment.  The  Project  has  been  prepared  in  close \ncoordination with the World Bank\u2019s REP and other donors active in the education sector. \n\n                                                 \n13 Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2004.

The  Project \nbuilds  on  the  initial  policy  reforms  and  sector  investments  carried  out  under  the  ESDP.  The \nProject will recommend approaches to improve the quality of education and children\u2019s access to \nit, as well as strengthening management. Within this framework, it will support improvements in \nthe  delivery  of  education  to  children  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas,  with  particular  attention  to \npoor areas and children from disadvantage families. The Project will assist the Government to \nsustain achievements relevant to the education MDGs. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n35. \nThe impact of the Project will be a general education system responsive to the needs of \na modern market-oriented economy and focused on poorer areas. The outcomes of the Project \nare  increased  enrollment  in  primary  and  general  secondary  education  in  poorer  areas  of  the \ncountry and student performance raised. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  modernizing  the  curriculum  and  learning \n36. \nassessment,  (ii)  strengthening  the  teaching  profession,  and  (iii)  improving  participation  and \nquality in rural schools. \n \n\n1. \n\nModernizing the Curriculum and Learning Assessment \n\n \n37. \nThe Project will support MOE and KAE in developing a new curriculum (footnote 6) and \nmodernizing learning assessment system. This component aims to improve the quality of basic \neducation  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  Education  Development  Concept  to  the  Year  2010. \nThis component has three subcomponents: (i) modernizing the curriculum and developing new \nlearning  materials,  (ii)  modernizing  learning  assessment,  and  (iii)  raising  public  awareness  on \nthe new curriculum and learning assessment. \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2002. Policy on Education. Manila.. \n\n\f38.  Modernizing  the  Curriculum  and  Developing  New  Learning  Materials.  This \nsubcomponent will focus on developing a curriculum that supports improving students\u2019 higher-\norder  cognitive  and  problem-solving  skills  through  a  student-centered  learning  process.  The \nnational  curriculum  framework  will  be  developed  and  ensure  a  new  curriculum  for  all  subject \nareas for all grades. The Project will support the phased development of textbooks and learning \nmaterials for grades 1\u20135, 6\u20139, and 10\u201311 or 12. In the context of the Government\u2019s program for \ndeveloping  new  learning  materials,  the  Project  will  provide  support  to  develop,  produce,  and \nsupply  at  least  670,000  copies  of  a  new  generation  of  textbooks  and  at  least  61,000  teacher \nguides to cover primary school. \n \n39. \nCapacity  will  be  built  throughout  the  education  system  to  ensure  the  Government\u2019s \ncontinued  and  complete  provision  of  required  textbooks  and  learning  materials  for  all  other \ngrades.  Twelve  subject  specialists  and  two  senior  education  officials  will  receive  external \ntraining  in  curriculum  development  and  learning  assessment  before  the  national  curriculum \nframework is developed. These 14 specialists, together with another 14 specialists in textbook \nand  learning  materials  development,  will  form  a  core  group  to  develop  the  new  curriculum, \ntextbooks,  learning  materials,  and  learning  assessment  system.  The  core  group  will  also \nmonitor  testing,  the  trial  of  the  new  curriculum,  and  new  textbook  production.  It  will  make \nnecessary  adjustments  jointly  with  curriculum  developers  and  textbook  authors.  In-country \ntraining for 150 trainers will be conducted by international and domestic consultants to enable \nthe trainers to train teachers to implement the new curriculum, use the new learning materials, \nand manage assessment in schools. Training will be carried out in the school year prior to the \nintroduction of the new curriculum and learning materials. The system and standards of learning \naids provision will be reviewed in coordination with other donors. \n \n40. \nPrior  to  the  development  of  the  new  curriculum,  a  series  of  policy  studies  on  related \neducational  issues  will  be  conducted,  including,  for  Government  consideration,  a  detailed \nassessment  with  outlined  recommendations  and  an  action  plan  for  implementing  a  12-year \nsystem of education. The policy studies, which are outlined in Supplementary Appendix B, will \nhelp MOE implement its overall education strategy and the Education Development Concept to \nthe Year 2010. \n \nAll activities for developing the new curriculum and learning assessment will stress wide \n41. \nstakeholder participation including (i) developing sessions, (ii) nationwide discussion workshops, \n(iii)  revision,  (iv)  training  for  implementing  activities  at  a  2-day  national  seminar  for  100  senior \neducators  followed  by  a  1-week  workshop  for  up  to  20  people  in  each  raion,  and  (v)  a \nnationwide public awareness campaign (para. 44).  \n \n42.  Modernizing  Learning  Assessment.  With  support  from  the  Project,  the  Government \naims to train teachers, educators, and education sector managers to be reflective practitioners \nable  to  engage  in  ongoing  inquiry  to  improve  the  quality  of  education.  The  purpose  of  this \nsubcomponent  is  to  strengthen  the  relationship  between  curriculum  and  learning  assessment, \nand to introduce and implement a new concept of assessment. This subcomponent will focus on \ndeveloping  and  implementing,  for  each  grade,  a  clear  policy,  assessment  standards,  and \nregulations on formative and summative classroom assessment systems. \n \n43. \nTraining  to  develop  learning  assessment  will  be  closely  linked  with  activities  toward \ncurriculum development. About 12 subject specialists and two senior education officials will be \ntrained in learning assessment and formulate a new learning assessment system. They will be \npart  of  the  core  group  developing  the  new  curriculum,  textbooks  and  learning  materials,  and \nlearning  assessment  system.  About  288  trainers  will  receive  training  to  enable  them  to  train \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nteachers to use the new curriculum and learning assessment system. A report and system for \nanalyzing  examinations  and  student  results  will  be  developed  under  the  existing  education \ninformation management system at MOE. Monitoring and evaluation activities will be conducted \nto  assess  the  impact  and  effectiveness  of  the  new  curriculum  and  learning  materials  and  the \nquality of assessment centrally and regionally. The Project will institutionalize the new learning \nassessment system by supporting TTIs\u2019 institutional capacity and providing two TTI specialists \nwith  an  opportunity  to  study  overseas  and  obtain  a  master\u2019s  degree  in  learning  assessment. \nThese  specialists  will  establish  the  new  learning  assessment  program  at  the  TTIs  upon  their \nreturn,  training  21  secondary  school  teachers  by  the  end  of  the  Project.  To  ensure \nunderstanding of new assessment techniques, 4,000 teachers and 2,000 school principals and \nrepresentatives  of  TTIs  will  participate  in  a  2-week  training  program  on  learning  assessment \nmethods  and  techniques.  International  and  domestic  consultants  will  help  develop  training \nmaterials in formative and summative assessment. \n \n44. \nRaising Public Awareness on the New Curriculum and Learning Assessment . This \nsubcomponent  will  help  the  Government  ensure  successful  implementation  of  the  new \ncurriculum  and  learning  assessment  system.  The  Project  will  conduct  public  awareness \ncampaigns to support public acceptance and stakeholder understanding of the new curriculum, \ntextbooks, \nincluding \nlearning  assessment,  and \nparticipatory \nforums  and  dissemination  of  multimedia  programs  and  materials.  Local \ncommunities and NGOs will be encouraged to take part in these programs. Advocacy programs \non  inclusive  education  will  also  be  conducted.  Teachers  involved  in  the  resulting  inclusive \neducation activities will attend training programs at the TTI chosen to be the training center for \ninclusive education. \n \n\nlearning  materials, \n\nincentives, \n\nteacher \n\n2. \n\nStrengthening the Teaching Profession \n\n45. \nThis  component  will  build  on  initial  measures  under  the  ESDP  to  support  teacher \ndevelopment.  It  has  two  subcomponents:  (i)  strengthening  in-service  teacher  training  and  (ii) \nproviding incentives for rural teachers. \n \n46. \nStrengthening In-Service Teacher Training. This subcomponent will strengthen the in-\nservice  training  of  teachers  and  principals  toward  implementing  the  new  curriculum,  textbooks \nand  learning  materials,  and  learning  assessment  systems,  as  well  as  upgrade  teachers\u2019 \nprofessional skills. The Project will strengthen the capacity of NTTI at KAE, which serves as a \nnational  center  for  in-service  teacher  training  and  trains  school  teachers  and  principals  in \nBishkek, Chui, and Naryn oblasts. The Project will also strengthen the capacity of seven TTIs to \ndeliver professional in-service training for teachers and school principals in all other oblasts. \n \n47. \nThe  Project  will  provide  NTTI  and  each  of  the  seven  TTIs  with  a  computer-equipped \nclassroom  and  a  language  laboratory,  as  well  as  with  classroom  furniture  and  teaching  and \nlearning  materials.  The  Project  will  train  teacher  trainers  and  support  the  development  of  in-\nservice  training  programs  for  teachers  and  education  sector  managers  regarding  new \ncurriculum  and \nlearning  materials,  classroom  assessment,  performance  management, \nmentoring  of  newly  qualified  teachers,  resource  management,  and  library  management. \nSeventy-one oblast education specialists will be trained in group facilitation skills. \n \n48. \nProviding Incentives for Rural Teachers. This subcomponent will support Government \nefforts  to  strengthen  the  teaching  profession  and  enhance  and  expand  the  teaching  corps, \nespecially  in  rural  schools,  through  a  pilot  incentive  scheme.  The  Project  will  support  a  rural \n\n\fteacher incentive scheme17 (RTIS) designed to attract and retain teachers in rural schools. The \nProject  will  provide  incentives  for  at  least  300  teachers,  including  newly  graduated  teachers, \nwho will be assigned to rural schools. Teachers of key subjects, and those in schools with an \noversupply  of  teachers,  will  be  redeployed  to  rural  schools  for  3  years  on  a  pilot  basis.  The \nincentive under the RTIS will be at least Som2,000 ($48.8) per month per teacher deposited in a \ndesignated  bank  for  the  3  years.  Each  teacher  will  receive  the  accumulated  incentive  with \ninterest upon completion of the teaching contract. To qualify for selection, rural schools must (i) \nhave a shortage of teachers in key subjects, (ii) serve a large number of rural children, and (iii) \nbe located in a remote area. Newly graduated and current teachers applying for the incentives \nmust  agree  to  teach  in  a  rural  area  and  have  high  qualifications  in  the  required  subject  area. \nImplementation of the incentive scheme will be reviewed periodically, and the Government will \nconsider its continuation upon completion of the pilot stage. \n \n\n3. \n\nImproving Participation and Quality in Rural Schools \n\n49. \nThis  component  will  help  MOE  improve  participation  and  the  quality  of  education  in \nselected rural schools. Ninety schools have been identified for comprehensive rehabilitation by \nMOE  in  close  consultation  with  oblast  and  raion  departments  of  education  and  other \nstakeholders.  The  list  of  schools  for  rehabilitation  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Their \nselection is based on the following criteria: \n  \n\n(i)  \n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n(iv) \n\nthe school is located in a poor, rural area;  \nthe  school\u2019s  foundation,  walls,  and  load-bearing  structures  are  sound  and  can \nfeasibly be rehabilitated;  \nschool staff and community members are committed to improving the school; and \noblast and raion administrations commit to budgeting for incremental O&M costs \nduring the Project and following completion of rehabilitation. \n\n \nThe Project will rehabilitate and upgrade school facilities and infrastructure by repairing \n50. \nheating systems and electrical wiring, insulating windows, repairing floors and roofs, improving \nsanitation, and providing access for handicapped students. The Project will provide the schools \nwith  classroom  and  library  furniture,  a  computer  classroom  with  13  computers,  a  language \nlaboratory with 15 stations, audiovisual equipment, and learning aids. \n \n51. \nThis component also includes project management activities through the CPIU and the \nRPIUs. To ensure the quality of the school rehabilitation, a project engineer at each of the two \nRPIUs  will  oversee  the  Project\u2019s  civil  works  implementation  (para.58).  Raion  and  oblast \narchitects  will  be  employed  to  prepare  designs  and  help  prepare  tender  documents  in \ncooperation with the school community, local administration, and project civil engineer. Schools \nselected  for  rehabilitation  will  not  require  additional  land  or an  environmental  impact  study,  as \nno environmental impact is envisaged. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nPro-Poor  Design.  The  Project  is  designed  to  improve  the  learning  environment  for \n52. \nstudents  in  rural  areas,  where  poverty  is  prevalent.  This  will  be  done  by  comprehensively \nrehabilitating the schools most in need. Support will be provided to a mechanism for attracting \nteachers  to  rural  schools  and  to  nationwide  activities  fostering  inclusive  education.  Learning \n\n                                                 \n17 Under the RTIS, the Government will support 200 teachers annually; the World Bank\u2019s Rural Education Project will \n\nsupport 300 teachers. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nmaterials,  including  textbooks,  will  be  provided  nationwide  under  the  TRS,  which  includes \nprovisions  to  ensure  affordability  and  the  full  provision  of  textbooks  to  children  whose  families \ncannot afford to pay. \n \nthe \nInstitutional  Changes  and  Decentralization.  The  Project  will  support \n53. \ndecentralization of in-service teacher training by strengthening oblast TTIs with training and new \nequipment. In-service teacher training will be demand driven. \n \nParticipatory Approach and Community Involvement. The Project was designed with \n54. \nthe  participation  of  key  policy  makers,  central  and  local  government  authorities,  teachers, \nparents,  students,  aiyl  okmotu  (village  authority)  representatives,  and  private  publishers. \nPreliminary  and in-depth assessments and situation analyses were conducted centrally and in \noblasts, raions, and villages. These included regular stakeholder consultations, workshops, and \npresentations. During implementation, the Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation, \nincluding community participation in the public awareness campaign, facility improvement, and \nresults monitoring. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n55. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $21.85 million equivalent, including physical \nand  price  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties.  Of  the  total,  $4.78  million  (22%)  is  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $17.07  million  equivalent  (78%)  the  local  currency  cost.  The  indicative \nproject cost estimates by expense category are in Table 1.

The  remaining  $6.35  million  equivalent,  or  29%  of  the  total \nproject cost, will be provided by the Government. The financing plan is in Table 2, and details of \nthe  financing  plan  are  in  Appendix  6.  Grant  financing  for  the  Project  is  considered  justified \nbecause of its focus on basic (primary and secondary) education, and the fact that a significant \npart of the investment targets poor and remote areas. The Kyrgyz Republic is eligible for Asian \nDevelopment Fund grant financing up to 50% of its total Asian Development Fund allocation. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nForeign  \nExchange \n\nLocal  \nCurrency \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\n            4.78 \n\n          10.72 \n\nTotal  \nCosta \n           15.50 \n\nPercent \n\n            71  \n\nGovernment \n\n            0.00 \n\n            6.35 \n\n             6.35 \n\n            29  \n\n                                Total \na  The  allocation  of  grant  proceeds  in  the  Grant  Agreement  will  be  presented  in  $,  with  reference  only  to  total \nexpenditure,  in  accordance  with  the  policy  on  Cost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  of  Expenditure  for  Asian  Development \nBank Financing: A New Approach. \n\n           21.85 \n\n            4.78 \n\n          17.07 \n\n          100  \n\nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe  project  Executing  Agency  will  be  MOE.  A  national  project  steering  council  will  be \n57. \nestablished and chaired by the vice prime minister responsible for social sectors. It will include \nrepresentatives from MOE, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, President\u2019s \nAdministration, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, and Parliamentary Committee on Education. The council \nwill meet quarterly or, if required, more often. It will provide overall strategic guidance, monitor \nimplementation of the Project and World Bank\u2019s REP, and ensure donor coordination. The first \ndeputy minister of MOE will be the project director, who will coordinate overall implementation of \nproject activities. Two regional project steering councils will be established to guide and monitor \nimplementation of the project activities in the oblasts. \n \n58. \nA  CPIU  will  be  established  at  MOE  in  Bishkek  to  coordinate  the  day-to-day \nimplementation of project activities. It will be staffed by domestic consultants including a project \nmanager,  procurement  specialist,  finance  manager,  accountant,  administrative  assistant,  and \ninterpreter.  It  will  be  assisted  by  domestic  consultants  on  teacher  training  and  learning \nmaterials, curriculum and learning assessment, monitoring and evaluation, and civil works and \nequipment,  and  translation.  The  CPIU  will  be  responsible  for  project  activities  overall  and \ndirectly  responsible  for  implementing  activities  in  Chui  and  Talas  oblasts.  Two  RPIUs  will  be \nestablished at oblast departments of education and will be responsible for implementing project \nactivities in the other oblasts, one RPIU covering the southern oblasts of Osh, Jalal-Abad, and \nBatken,  and  the  other  covering  Naryn  and  Issyk-Kul.  The  two  RPIUs  will  each  be  staffed  with \ndomestic consultants including a coordinator, accountant, assistant, civil works and equipment \nspecialist,  and  driver.  The  Project  will  cover  consultants\u2019  salaries  and  office  equipment  and \noperational costs. The two RPIU coordinators will  report directly to the  project manager in the \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nCPIU, providing quarterly and annual progress reports. The RPIU offices will be located in the \nOsh  and  Karakol  oblast  education  departments.  The  project  management  structure  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n \nThe  Project  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  REP  have  been  prepared  in  close  cooperation,  are \n59. \nmutually  complementary  and  will  coordinate  closely  on  sector  policy  issues  as  well  as  project \nimplementation.  Each  project  will  begin  with  administratively  separate  project  implementation \nunits,  each  with  its  own  staff  headed  by  a  project  manager.  The  national  project  director  and \nnational project steering council will ensure policy coordination. The scope for closer integration \nwill  be  reviewed  within  one  year  of  project  implementation.  The  two  project  offices  with  be \nlocated  near  each  other  at  MOE  to  ensure  close  coordination  and  information  sharing,  and  a \nunified salary scale for unit staff will be agreed. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years, from January 2006 to December 2010. A \n\n60. \nproject implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n \n \nAll  ADB-financed  civil  works,  goods,  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \n61. \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works will include the rehabilitation of existing facilities \nbut  no  new construction.  As  civil  works  contracts  will  be  small  and  scattered,  each contract is \nestimated to cost much less than $1 million. As domestic contractors are capable of carrying out \nsuch  works,  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $1  million  or  less  will  be  procured  through \nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n62. \nEquipment for computer classrooms and language laboratories, audiovisual equipment, \nand  classroom  furniture,  as  well  as  textbooks  and  learning  materials,  will  be  provided  to \nschools,  NTTI,  and  TTIs.  Equipment  and  goods  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  will  be \nprocured  under  the  international  competitive  bidding  procedure.  Equipment  and  goods \nestimated to cost $500,000 or less will be procured under local competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB\u2014except for equipment and goods valued at $100,000 or less, which will be \nprocured by direct purchase. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 9. \n \n \n \n63. \nA total of 81 person-months of international consulting services and 791 person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  contracted,  including  600  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants  for  CPIU  and  RPIU.  These  will  include  experts  in  policy  research  and  evaluation, \ncurriculum  and  learning  materials  design,  learning  assessment,  teacher  training,  procurement, \nfinance,  civil  engineering,  project  management,  accounting,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and \ntranslation. The  domestic  consultants  for  the  CPIU  and  RPIUs  will  be  recruited  as individuals, \nand all other consultants will be recruited as firms in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Quality and cost-based selection, with simplified technical proposals, will be applied \nto consulting firms. Consulting services and outline terms of reference are in Appendix 10. \n \n \n \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n4. \n\n\f5. \n\nStaff Development and Training \n\n \n \n64. \nThe  Project  will  provide  extensive  in-country  and  external  training  to  upgrade  the  skills \nand knowledge of teachers, principals, and education administrators. The CPIU will prepare the \nselection criteria for training candidates within 6 months of project effectiveness, for approval by \nADB.  Subsequently,  the  CPIU  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  a  list  of  the  nominated  candidates,  (ii) \nproposed  institutions,  and  (iii)  detailed  costing  of  the  proposed  courses.  The  external  training \nprovider will be selected based on the competitive submission of training proposals. In-country \ntraining will be held at TTIs or other relevant training institutions selected on a competitive basis. \nEducation  specialists  selected  for  training  overseas  will  have  current  teaching  experience  in \nschools. The staff development program is in Appendix 11. \n \n \n \nThe  proposed  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n65. \nHandbook. An imprest account will be established to expedite disbursement of grant proceeds. \nThe  CPIU  will  open  the  account  in  a  commercial  bank  selected  by  the  Government  and \nacceptable to ADB. The Government may make withdrawals from the imprest account for CPIU \nand  regional  staff  costs;  training,  seminars,  and  studies;  locally  available  equipment  and \nmaterials; domestic consultants; and civil works contracts under local competitive bidding. The \ninitial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed $500,000. ADB\u2019s statement \nof  expenditure  procedures  will  be  followed  to  liquidate  the  imprest  account  and  reimburse \nindividual payments that do not exceed $50,000. \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n66. \nThe  Government  has  requested  advance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing \nfor  the  CPIU\u2019s  office  equipment  and  a  vehicle,  office  equipment  for  the  curriculum  writing \ngroups,  and  the  recruitment  of  CPIU  and  RPIUs  staff,  including  a  project  manager,  finance \nmanager,  accountant,  and  procurement  specialist.  This  was  approved  in  principle  by  ADB \nmanagement. The advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Retroactive financing will apply to expenses incurred after appraisal of the Project \nuntil  the  date  the  grant  becomes  effective  and  for  an  amount  not  exceeding  $100,000.  The \nGovernment was advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance action and retroactive financing does \nnot  commit  ADB  to  financing  the  Project.  Accumulated  experience  in  implementing  the  ESDP \ndemonstrates MOE\u2019s proven competence and capacity to carry out procurement effectively. \n \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n67.  MOE  will  maintain  the  project  account  and  prepare  financial  statements  according  to \ninternational  accounting  standards.  MOE  will  have  the  project  account  and  related  financial \nstatements  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  with  adequate \nqualification, knowledge, and experience in international accounting practices. Certified copies \nof  the  audited  project  accounts  and  audited  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  in \nEnglish by 6 months after the end of each financial year. A separate opinion on the use of the \nimprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  should  be  incorporated  in  the  audited  reports. \nThe Government has been advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely submission of audited \nproject accounts and financial statements, including the suspension of disbursements in case of \nnoncompliance. \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n68.  MOE  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  reports,  in  English  and  in  a  format \nacceptable  to  ADB,  on  progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under \nreview; the steps taken or proposed to remedy these problems; and the proposed activities and \nexpected progress during the following period. Within 3 months of completion of the Project, the \nCPIU  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  that  will  provide  details  about \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n69. \nIn  addition  to  targets  specified  in  the  project  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nsystematic  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  developed  and  undertaken  during  project \nimplementation.  MOE  and  ADB  agreed  on  a  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating \nproject performance regarding impact, outcome, and outputs. The project monitoring indicators \nare  in  Appendix  12.  The  baseline  values  of  the  indicators  will  be  established  prior  to \nimplementation.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be  measured  with  the  necessary  frequency  during \nproject implementation. Comments and findings on these indicators will be incorporated in the \nquarterly  report  to  ADB.  In  addition  to  indicators  for  monitoring  implementation,  indicators  for \nproject evaluation will be measured at project completion and 3 years after completion. Where \nfeasible  and  appropriate,  these  data  should  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  At  project  inception, \ncompletion, and 3 years after completion, MOE will submit to ADB a report that summarizes the \nkey findings of monitoring and evaluation of changes that occurred in the 3 preceding years. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  review  project  implementation  semiannually.  The \n70. \nreviews  will  assess  progress  under  each  component,  identify  issues  and  constraints,  and \ndetermine  necessary  remedial  action  and  adjustments.  A  comprehensive  midterm  review  of \nproject  performance  will  be  conducted  at  the  end  of  the  third  year  of  implementation.  The \nmidterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and implementation arrangements; (ii) identify \nany changes required since the time of the project appraisal; (iii) assess the progress of project \nimplementation against performance indicators; (iv) establish compliance with grant covenants; \nand (v) recommend changes, if necessary, to design or implementation arrangements. \n \n\n11. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n71. \nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy has been explained to Government officials and highlighted \nparas.  1.06\u201310.8  of  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  on  issues  concerning  fraud  and \ncorruption.  The  Government  is  committed  to  creating  and  sustaining  a  corruption-free \nenvironment  and  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  in  all \ndocuments and contracts during bidding for and implementation of the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries \n\nA. \n \n72. \nProject  Beneficiaries.  The  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  50,000  students \nand 1,500 teachers and school administrators in the 90 priority schools selected, most of them \nin rural communities. About 60% of students in the selected schools hold social passports that \nindicate that they come from poor families. These schools will benefit from the comprehensive \nrehabilitation  of  facilities  and  the  provision  of  educational  equipment,  furniture  and  learning \nmaterials, which will create a significantly improved learning environment. \n\n\fTeachers  throughout  the  country  will  benefit  from  measures  to  make  the  teaching \n73. \nprofession  more  attractive,  including  in-service  teacher  training  programs  provided  to  16,000 \nteachers  and  6,000  school  directors  on  the  new  curriculum,  learning  assessment  system,  and \ntextbooks,  as  well  as  the  professional  skills  needed  to  improve  the  overall  quality  of  teaching \nand school administration. The education staff at TTIs throughout the country will benefit from \ntheir enhanced capacity and upgraded teaching facilities. \n \n74. \nAbout 1.2 million students nationwide will benefit from the improved curriculum, learning \nassessment system, and textbooks and learning materials, as well as from having better-skilled \nteachers.  These  benefits  will  help  students  prepare  for  pursuing  further  education,  which  will \nenhance their potential for securing viable employment and enhance their future income-earning \npotential. \n \n75. \nEducational  Benefits.  Benefits  will  include  an  overall  improvement  in  the  quality  of \neducation offered in terms of teaching and learning standards. The new curriculum and learning \nassessment system will help equip a new generation of workforce entrants with the knowledge \nand skills needed in a market economy. Best practices in curriculum and learning assessment \nsystems,  and  the  introduction  of  innovative  methods  for  improving  the  delivery  of  education \nservices  based  at  the  TTIs,  will  be  institutionalized  to  ensure  the  sustained  impact  of  project \noutputs. \n \n76. \nIncentives  to  teach  in  rural  areas  will  address  a  key  bottleneck  in  teacher  supply  and \nhelp to ensure that subjects are taught in rural schools. The provision of computer classrooms, \nlanguage laboratory equipment, and furniture to rural schools will improve the learning process \nand environment and contribute to improving students\u2019 achievements.  \n \n77. \nPoverty  and  Gender  Impact.  The  Project  is  classified  as  a  targeted  intervention,  as \napproximately 60% of the project beneficiaries are poor, reflecting a poverty rate higher than the \n40% of the country as a whole. The Project will directly and indirectly benefit students from poor \nfamilies, including children with disabilities. It will increase access to education in areas with the \nlow  enrollment  rates,  particularly  rural  areas.  The  benefits  of  the  Project  will  include  improved \naccess  to  education  for  disadvantaged  rural  students.  As  90%  of  teachers  are  female,  the \nProject  will  directly  benefit  female  teachers  in  rural  areas  by  enhancing  the  incentives  and \nattractiveness of the teaching profession. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 13. \n \nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards. The Project will entail modest rehabilitation of \n78. \nschool  facilities  and  internal  refurbishing,  with  no  environmental  or  resettlement  impact.  The \nProject will enhance access and equity for ethnic minorities by providing, in addition to textbook \nand  learning  materials  in  Kyrgyz  and  Russian,  textbooks  and  learning  materials  in  Uzbek  and \nTajik. \n \n79. \nEconomic  and  Financial  Sustainability.  Finance  data  from  a  survey  of  140  priority \nschools conducted in 2004 indicated that 25% of the schools\u2019 recurrent budgets was spent on \nutilities and 7.5% on O&M. On average, the cost of utilities and O&M is Som278,000 ($6,620) \nper school, which is high considering the limited budgetary resources of the schools.  \n \n80. \nThe  Project  will  enhance  efficiency  in  school  management  by  reducing  the  cost  of \nutilities and O&M, which account for a third of the recurrent expenditures in individual schools. \nBy  rehabilitating  heating  systems;  repairing  roofs,  floors,  and  water-supply  systems;  and \ninsulating windows, the Project aims to achieve significant reductions in O&M costs per student. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nRisks \n\nUnder  the  ESDP,  savings  in  O&M  costs  of  up  to  53%  annually  were  achieved  as  a  result  of \nschool rehabilitation, particularly of heating systems. Based on this figure, by 2009, the Project\u2019s \ninvestments  in  the  90  schools  are  expected  to  reduce  school  annual  expenditures  by  over \nSom11.4 million ($272,000 equivalent) yearly. The sustainability of the school rehabilitation will \nbe  ensured  by  continuous  community  involvement  in  maintaining  and  supporting  school \ninfrastructure. Economic and financial sustainability is analyzed in Appendix 14. \n \nB. \n \n81. \nImplementation  Capacity  Risk.  The  risk  exists  that  responsibilities  or  tasks  required \ncentrally  and/or  in  oblasts  and  raions  will  be  beyond  the  capabilities  of  the  staff  members  to \nwhich  they  have  been  assigned,  including  (i)  designing  school  facilities;  (ii)  supervising \nconstruction;  (iii)  procuring  and  delivering  equipment,  furniture,  and  learning  materials; \n(iv) policy  studies;  (v)  designing  the  curriculum  and  learning  materials;  and  (vi)  designing  and \ndelivering in-service training. The risks will be mitigated by training and capacity building of the \nresponsible staff at a central, oblast, and raion levels. \n \n82. \nSector  Policy  Risk.  Policy  impact  will  be  significant  with  the  introduction  of  a  new \ncurriculum  and  learning  assessment  system  reflecting  the  Government\u2019s  priority  to  improve \naccess  to,  and  the  quality  of  education  and  consideration  to  introduce  a  12-year  system  of \neducation. Risks include resistance from decision makers to recommended policy or legislative \nchanges, and from parents or the community at large to new and unfamiliar innovations in the \ncurriculum  and  learning  assessment  system.  Overall,  the  Government  is  consistent  in  its \nstrategy on educational reforms and enhancing access to education and its quality. The risk will \nbe  mitigated  by  adopting  a  stakeholder  participatory  approach  and  implementing  a  public \nawareness campaign that includes the active involvement of local communities and NGOs. \n \n83. \nFinancial Sustainability Risk. Financial risk arises from the possible inability of national \nor  local  government  to  provide  the  counterpart  resources  required  to  ensure  effective  project \nimplementation,  or  to  provide  for  incremental  recurrent  costs  for  O&M  during  implementation \nand  after  project  completion.  The  risk  may  lead  to  (i)  deteriorated  facilities  due  to  lack  of \nmaintenance  and  (ii)  discontinued  dissemination  of  new  textbooks  and  learning  materials, \nteaching methodologies, and learning assessment systems after the Project ends. To mitigate \nthe risk, ADB will work closely with the Government to ensure adequate resource allocation for \nthe  education  sector,  counterpart  funds,  and  incremental  recurrent  costs  for  O&M,  and \nappropriate assurances are included. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to standard assurances, the Government and MOE have given the following \n\n84. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nWithin 6 months of grant effectiveness, the MOE will adopt a project monitoring \nand  evaluation  plan  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  key  Project  monitoring  indicators \nagreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB  will  be  used  to  evaluate  project \nachievements and impact. \nThe  Government  will  allocate  in  a  timely  manner  adequate  funding  for  (a)  its \nshare of local costs of training programs for teachers and school directors and of \nlearning  materials,  (b)  government  counterpart  staff  salaries,  (c)  incremental \nrecurrent  costs  for  the  O&M  of  NTTI  and  all  schools  and  TTIs  rehabilitated  or \nsupported  under  the  Project,  and  (d)  replacement  capital  costs  for  computer \n\n\f(iii) \n\nequipment to be procured 4\u20135 years after initial procurement of such equipment. \nLocal  administrations  will  give  written  commitments  to  provide  budgetary \nresources for the O&M of schools and TTIs supported under the Project prior to \nthe tendering of civil works or provision and installation of equipment. \nThe  Government  will  endeavor  to  maintain  annual  expenditure  for  education \nsector activities during project implementation equal to at least 4.5% of GDP, in \nline with its medium-term budget framework. In this connection, the Government \nwill annually provide ADB with information on allocations and actual expenditure \nfor the education sector. \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(iv)  Within 12 months of grant effectiveness, MOE will review the results of the policy \nstudy  on  introducing  a  12-year  general  education  system  and  make  a \nrecommendation to the Government. \nMOE  will  establish  national  curriculum  writing  groups  based  on  competitive \nselection  and  ensure  the  provision  of  adequate  budgetary  funds  for  the  writing \ngroups by October 2005. \nThe  Government  will  approve  a  new  curriculum  for  primary  school  by  year  2, \nbasic  secondary  school  by  year  3,  and  upper  secondary  by  year  4  of  project \nimplementation  based  on  the  review  of  the  new  curriculum  prepared  by  the \nnational curriculum writing groups. Within 24 months of grant effectiveness, MOE \nwill  adopt  a  written  policy  on  teacher  training  standards,  and  professional \nrequirements  at  different  levels  will  be  adopted  in  synchronization  with  the \nadoption of the new curriculum. \nThe  Government  will  continue  its  policy  of  strengthening  teacher  incentives  to \nmake the teaching profession more attractive and ensure that adequate numbers \nof qualified teachers are attracted to teaching positions in rural and remote areas. \nThe  Government  will  progressively  increase  teacher  salaries  by  at  least  15% \nannually during the project period. \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)  Within  6  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  prepare  a  time-\nbound  action  plan,  detailed  criteria,  and  implementation  mechanisms  and \nprocedures  for  the  RTIS  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  RTIS  shall  provide  for  the \ntransfer of at least Som2,000 per month for each teacher selected to work in rural \nschools into a special deposit account for at least 3 years. In addition to support \nfor  the  RTIS  from  grant  funds,  the  Government  will  provide  RTIS  funding  for  at \nleast 200 additional teachers annually from budget funds. \n\n(ix)  MOE  will  include  detailed  information  on  the  implementation  of  the  RTIS  in \nquarterly  progress  reports  submitted  to  ADB,  including  the  number  of  teachers \ncovered, their subject areas, and the schools to which they are assigned. RTIS \nimplementation  will  be  reviewed  periodically,  and  necessary  amendments  may \nbe  agreed  between  ADB  and  the  Government.  A  comprehensive  review  of  the \nfunctioning of the RTIS will be undertaken in connection with the midterm review, \nand may serve as the basis for necessary adjustments. Prior to completion of the \n3-year  pilot  phase  of  the  RTIS,  the  Government  will  review  the  measures \nnecessary  to  ensure  sustainability  of  its  impact,  including  continuation  of  the \nscheme under budget financing until the schools are staffed with teachers. \n(x)  Within 12 months of grant effectiveness, and prior to provision and installation of \ncomputer  and  language  laboratory  equipment,  the  Government  will  ensure  that \nall schools, NTTI, and TTIs to receive the computer equipment will have at least \none  qualified  computer/informatics  teacher,  and  that  all  schools  and  TTIs  to \nreceive  language  laboratory  equipment  have  at  least  one  qualified  language \nteacher. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(xi)  Within 12 months of grant effectiveness, and prior to provision and installation of \ncomputer  equipment  the  Government  will  ensure  that  security  arrangements \n(steel  doors,  burglar  bars  on  windows)  are  in  place  in  computer  classrooms  of \nthe project schools. \n\n(xii)  Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, MOE and the CPIU will prepare selection \ncriteria  for  external  training  on  curriculum  development  and  learning  materials, \nand  on  learning  assessment,  and  a  list  of  candidates  and  submit  the  same  to \nADB for approval. \n\n(xiii)  The Government will require that each participant in the external training program \nenters into a contract with the Government which commits the participant to work \nfor  a  government  institution  for  at  least  3  years  after  completing  the  external \ntraining,  or  reimburse  the  full  cost  of  the  external  training  provided  under  the \nproject, if the participant fails to complete the contract. \n\n(xiv)  The Government will ensure that the Project will not entail any land acquisition or \n\nresettlement. \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n85. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  of \n$15,500,000  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Second  Education  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources, upon terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the

Primary  and  lower  secondary  (basic)  education  are  compulsory.  Primary \neducation (grades 1\u20134) begins at age 6 or 7. Lower secondary education covers grades 5 to 9. \nUpper  secondary  education  includes  grades  10\u201311.  The  Constitution  stipulates  free  basic \neducation to all children.  \n \n2. \nIn 2002, 9.5% of children 1\u20136 years of age were enrolled in 416 preschools, down from \nabout one in four enrolled before independence. Urban enrollment was 24.7%, and rural 3.8%. \nIn 2002, 96.8% of the primary school age group was enrolled in primary schools (97.8% of boys, \n95.8%  of  girls).  Lower  secondary  education  enrollment  was  92.8%  (92.6%  of  boys,  93.0%  of \ngirls). Enrollment in upper secondary education was 72.0% (68% of boys, 76.1% of girls).  \n \n3. \nThere were 2,045 daytime general education schools in school year (SY) 2004, of which \n351  were  urban  and  1,694  rural.  Of  the  total,  137  schools  were  primary  only,  164  were  basic \n(grades  1\u20139),  and  1,722  were  complete  secondary  schools.  The  large  majority  of  schools \n(1,323)  taught  in  Kyrgyz.  There  were  148  Russian-only  schools,  132  Uzbek-only  schools,  and \none Tajik-only school. Two or more languages of instruction were offered in 421 schools. There \nwere  380  state  schools with  a  focus  on  certain  subjects  enrolling  147,767  students,  110  state \ngymnasiums  with  60,300  students,  and  54  state  lyceums  with  18,624  students.  Eight  schools \noffered evening classes for 1,238 working students in SY2004. Table A3.1 presents an overview \nof general education. \n \n4. \nA total of 26 boarding schools enrolled 5,434 students in SY2004, of which 873 students \nwere without parental care and 496 disabled. Twenty of the boarding schools (12 in rural areas) \nenrolled  2,456  students  with  special  needs.  Of  these  special  students,  most  were  mentally \ndisabled, 205 were blind or had vision difficulties, 530 had hearing disabilities, 237 were haring \nfeeble,  and  277  had  grave  speech  disabilities.  Another  250  children  with  mental  disabilities \nattended  inclusive  classes  in  daytime  boarding  schools.  The  number  of  children  in  inclusive \nclasses rose from 377 in SY1999 to 674 in SY2002 but dropped to 250 the following year.  \n \n5. \nIn  SY2004,  most  general  education  schools  (1,525,  or  75%)  operated  two  shifts.  In \naddition,  105  schools  with  18,109  students  operated  three  shifts.  A  normal  school  week  for \nchildren in grade 1 consists of 20\u201322 \u201chours\u201d (45-minute lessons). The number of hours is 35 in \ngrade 9 and 32\u201333 in grades 10 and 11. A school week is 6 days, however the schedule may \nvary. \n \n6. \nVocational training is offered at two levels and administered by the Ministry of Labor and \nSocial Protection. There were 113 primary vocational education institutions (vocational technical \ncolleges or lyceums) in SY2003, of which 65 were rural. Total enrollment was 25,972 including \n9,258  female  students;  22,007  were  financed  by  the  state  budget  and  most  (12,051)  were \ngraduates  of  basic  education  (grade  9).  In  addition,  66  secondary  vocational  education \ninstitutions  (technikum)  operated  in  SY2003.  Three  were  not  state  owned.  Enrollment  was \n25,989, among whom 16,861 were female. A total of 13,114 students were studying with state \nbudget  funding  in  23  specializations.  The  majority  studied  healthcare  (8,166),  followed  by \neconomics and management/business administration (5,276) and education (2,673).    \n \nHigher education is offered in 46 institutions, the majority of which (30) are in Bishkek. \n7. \nAmong  the  199,124  students  in  SY2003,  103,577  were  in  day  programs,  1,251  in  evening \nstudy,  and  94,296  in  distance-learning  programs.

In \nresponse, the (then) Ministry of Education and Culture proposed in its Education Development \nConcept  for  the  year  20101  a  number  of  basic  principles  for  a  democratic  education  system. \nto  high-quality  education,  decentralization, \nThey \ninternational quality standards, openness and mobility, and trust. A number of these principles \nhave  been  followed,  but  not  always  with  desired  consequences.  For  example,  more \nresponsibility has been decentralized to local government agencies, but most have such limited \nfinancial resources that schools struggle to finance utilities and maintenance and have no funds \nleft for other expenditures. National testing systems, rather than proving trustworthy have led to \ndistrusted  by  parents  on  the  part  of  parents,  and  the  implementation  of  autonomous  testing \nsystem ACCELS. Other reforms, however, have proven positive. School committees have been \nformed and have become involved in decision making in schools. Despite financial constraints, \nsome  local  administrations  have  been  very  supportive  of  their  schools.

Bishkek. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nmanagement  information  system  has  been  established  with  help  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB). \n \n9. \nIn March 2004, the Ministry of Education and Culture was reorganized with the removal \nof the culture section. The Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for education policy and \nits  implementation,  education  strategy  development,  state  education  standards,  ensuring  the \nright  to  education  and  equal  development  between  regions,  the  introduction  of  innovative \npractices,  the  training  and  upgrading  of  teachers,  statistical  support  and  monitoring,  and \ninternational  cooperation.  It  also  administers  national  institutions  (some  vocational  and \nspecialized  secondary  schools  and  colleges,  as  well  as  higher  education  institutions)  and \ndetermines, according to norms, expenditure for education on behalf of local government. MOE \ninstitutional capacity was strengthened under the ESDP, which supported (i) rationalizing MOE \nstaff and providing retraining to those laid off, (ii) strengthening the policy and planning unit at \nMOE,  and  (iii)  establishing  an  education  management  information  system  for  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n \nOblast  (provincial)  departments  of  education  are  responsible  for  secondary  education, \n10. \nand  administer  vocational,  technical,  and  higher  education.  Raion  (district)  departments  of \neducation  are  responsible  for  preschool  and  primary  education  and  administer  secondary \neducation.  Aiyil  okmotu  (village  authorities)  administer  their  schools  and  are  responsible  for \nproviding maintenance and materials. This management system is not yet fully decentralized,2 \nbut some authority exists for autonomous decision making. For example, local administrations \ncan raise and allocate funds for non-salary expenditures in schools. In other ways, however, the \neducation system is deconcentrated rather than devolved.   \n \n11.  Management improvement needs to continue both nationally and locally. National policy \nand strategy making and operational planning need improvement. Two new autonomous units \nwill be attached to the Kyrgyz Academy of Education: the Center for Strategic Planning and the \nCenter for Monitoring and Assessment. The World Bank\u2019s Rural Education Project (see footnote \n8  of  the  main  text)  will  provide  support  for,  and  build  the  capacity  of,  staff  in  these  new  units. \nMuch also needs to be done to strengthen management capacity locally, regarding both school \ndirectors and school committees.   \n \n\n2. \n\nMedium-Term Budget Framework \n\n \n12.              Human  resource  development  is  a  priority  in  the  comprehensive  development \nframework of the Kyrgyz Republic to 2010. As such, the Government is making efforts, despite \nits  limited  financial  resources,  to  support  the  education  system  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements of a market economy. In its recently published Medium-Term Budget Framework \n(MTBF)  2005\u20132007,3  the  education  sector  is  one  of  four  priority  sectors,  with  health,  social \nprotection, and agriculture. \n \n13. \n\nThe priority activities outlined in the MTBF are as follows: \n(i) \n\n\u201cEnsure  targeted  support  for  children  from  socially  vulnerable  strata,  orphan \nchildren, including supply of clothes, shoes, [and] school books. Release 10% of \nchildren from requirement to pay for textbooks. \nBased  on  availability  of  resources,  carry  out  capital  repairs  of  secondary \neducational establishments and equip and renew schools\u2019 furniture. \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n2  Decentralization refers to a continual process of delegation from deconcentration to devolution (fully autonomous \n\ndecision making). \n\n3  Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2004.

This  was  an  increase  from  2000  (3.5%)  but  a \ndecrease  from  1998  (4.9%).4  Between  75%  and  80%  of  the  budget  of  MOE  pays  teachers\u2019 \nsalaries.  Allocation  of  the  remaining  amount  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  MOE,  most  often  for \nrecurrent  expenditures.  General  education  (grades  1\u201311)  receives  the  majority  of  education \nexpenditures (nearly 70% in 2001) and will continue to do so. More emphasis, however, will be \nplaced  upon  preschool  education  and  vocational  and  technical  education  in  the  next  medium-\nterm plan.  \n \n16.  Most capital expenditures are financed by donors (who provided Som45 million in 2003). \nOther education expenditures are financed by the regional administrations in oblasts and raions. \nApproximately  35%  of  the  resources  raised  locally  through  taxes  are  sent  to  the  center  for \nreallocation. Naryn, Talas, and Batken oblasts are in deficit, with income at only about 30% of \nexpenditures. Another significant resource of school funding is parental contributions.  \n \n17. \nSchool  Recurrent  Expenditure  and  Per  Capita  Cost.  On  average,  66%  of  the  total \nexpenditure  on  vocational  education  comes  from  the  state  budget,  and  the  balance  of  34% \ncomes from parental contributions. In higher education, parental contributions averaged 59% of \nthe  total  expenditures  during  the  past  4  years,  and  only  41%  came  from  the  state  budget.  A \ntenth of the students in higher education are on scholarship programs financed by the state, and \nthe rest have to pay tuition fees averaging Som16,000 per year per student. Data on financing \nrecurrent expenditures on education from 2001 to 2004 are presented in Table A3.3 below. \n \n18. \nAlthough the state budget is the major source of financing for the education system, data \non parental contributions during the last 4 school years\u2014averaging 9% of total expenditures in \npreschool  and  6%  in  general  secondary  education\u2014shows  that  the  share  of  community \ncontributions  toward  financing  the  education  system  has  been  constant,  except  for  slight \ndecrease  of  1  percentage  point  during  SY2002  and  SY2003  in  preschool  education  and  an \nincrease of the same size in the same school years for general secondary school (Table A3.3).  \n \n19. \nParental  contributions  to  vocational  education  and  higher  education  were  maintained \nfrom  2001  to  2003  but  declined  in  2004  by  17%  and  22%,  respectively.  It  should  be  noted, \nhowever,  that  the  annual  budget  allocated  by  the  Government  to  finance  the  whole  education \nsystem from 2001 to 2004 consistently met the annual recurrent expenditures financed from the \nstate budget.   \n\n                                                 \n4 National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic.

At the same time, they feel the \nneed  to  align  their  education  systems  more  closely  with  those  of  other  countries.  To  help \novercome  this  lack  of  exposure,  short  external  training  programs  and  longer  overseas  degree \nprograms  can  be  provided.  The  Project  will  provide  a  specially  designed  1-month  training \nprogram for 28 participants in two groups. Its objective is to provide participants with a thorough \nunderstanding  of  approaches  and  recent  innovations  in  curriculum  development,  learning \nassessment, and teacher training used in other countries. Participants will use this experience \nto develop the best means of modernizing their education system.   \n \n2. \nThe Project will recruit an international consulting firm expert in curriculum development, \ntextbook  and  learning  materials,  learning  assessment,  and  teacher  training.  It  will  initiate \ncapacity development in the Kyrgyz Academy of Education\u2019s National Teacher Training Institute \n(NTTI) and seven oblast teacher training institutes (TTIs) by reviewing their current approaches \nfor  curriculum  development,  classroom  assessment,  and  teacher  training,  and  their  need  for \nexposure to alternatives. The consulting firm will then develop a 1-month training program to be \ndelivered at each institution for two groups of 14 specialists each. The first group will focus on \ncurriculum  development  and  learning  assessment,  and  the  second  on  teacher  training \nmethodology.  These  28  specialists  will  form  a  core  group  to  develop  the  new  curriculum  and \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n41 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nassessment  and  teacher  training  programs,  and  to  act  as  trainers  of  trainers.  The  core  group \nwill  design  training  for  curriculum  and  learning  assessment  developers;  authors,  editors,  and \npublishers; and teacher trainers. The core group will develop the new  curriculum and learning \nassessment  systems  and  be  involved  in  the  design  and  delivery  of  the  training  programs  for \nteachers  and  school  directors.  The  core  group  will  monitor  testing  and  the  impact  of  the \nintroduction  of  national  curriculum,  learning  materials,  and  learning  assessment,  and  make \nnecessary adjustments. It will work closely with the textbook and learning materials specialists \nof the World Bank\u2019s REP (footnote 8). \n \nB. \n \n\nComponent 1.

  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic: \n \nAccess to education is a Government priority under the national poverty reduction program. The National Education \nDevelopment Concept to 2010 outlines quality of education as a priority. Education is the basis for development of all \nchildren  and  leads  to  better  human  capital  development.  Basic  education  brings  benefits  such  as  a  better-educated \nworkforce,  improved  skills  allowing  people  to  earn  higher  income,  and  a  reduction  of  poverty.  The  proposed  project \nactivities  are  based  on  an  integrated  approach  to  address  interlinked  education  issues  related  to  poverty  reduction. \nThe  activities  include  developing  a  modern  curriculum,  a  new  generation  of  learning  materials,  modern  student \nlearning assessment and improved teacher training, and upgraded school facilities. These innovations will contribute \nto improved quality of and access to education, particularly for poor and vulnerable children. \n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                  Poverty Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nGovernment  statistics1  indicate  that  in  2001  more  than  40%  of  urban  and  47%  of  rural  residents  were  poor.  Today, \n10%  of  the  population  receives  government  allowances  or  welfare,  and  97%  of  these  people  are  children.  Special \nstate  care  is  given  to  handicapped  children.  These  children  receive  monthly  social  allowances  regardless  of  their \nfamilies\u2019 needs and income.  \n \nA priority of state social policy is to help the development of children by creating opportunities for social participation, \nnot simply by providing welfare. The first step in this direction was the social passport system started in 1999, which \nallows  families  to  be  categorized  by  their  social  and  economic  potential.  State  support  led  to  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  through  start-up  capital  (microfinancing;  microcredit;  the  provision  of  land  and  equipment;  the \nteaching/learning of basic knowledge; and re-training unemployed people to learn professions in high demand).  \n \nIn 1999, the state budget allocated funds to an education foundation with the purpose of supporting pupils from poor \nfamilies. To provide timely and complete financing, five foster homes and 15 specialized boarding schools with a total \nof 3,000 pupils have been transferred to the republican budget since 1996. In addition, the state budget also supports \nfoster homes for children. During 1997\u20132000, Som3.3 million were allocated to foster homes. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  intervention  is  classified  as  a  targeted  intervention\u2013household,  because  project  activities  focus  on \nschools in rural areas,  where 60% of students hold a social passport2  indicating that they come from poor families. \nThe  Project  contributes  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  particularly \nregarding universal access to education and the eradication of poverty. The Project\u2019s focus on poor rural schools will \ncontribute to alleviating the poverty of more than 50,000 students and their families.  \n \n\nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nThe  Project  was  designed  for  stakeholder  participation,  including  key  policy  makers  in  the  central  and  regional \ngovernment,  line  ministries,  parliamentary  representatives,  oblast  (provincial)  and  raion  (district)  education \nadministration  authorities,  the  donor  community,  private  publishers,  parents,  teachers,  students,  village  authorities, \nand children with disabilities. \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   National Statistics Committee.

Activities  include  a  public \nawareness  campaign  to  support  the  successful  implementation  of  the  new  curriculum  and  learning  assessment \nsystems,  as  well  as  village  community  involvement  in  monitoring  the  rehabilitation  of  school  facilities  and  support \nthrough in-kind contributions. Particular focus is given to the inclusive education and poor children.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nNo gender bias in access to the basic education exists in the Kyrgyz Republic. Children of both genders have equal \nopportunity to receive basic education, which is granted free under the Constitution.  \n \nThe Project activities, including in-service teacher training to improve the professional and teaching skills required for \npromotion and the incentives scheme, will allow female teachers, who represent 80% of the teaching corps, to benefit \nand receive higher recognition and salaries through promotion.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No.  \n\n \nE.

In  the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  70%  of  the  total  population,  or  3.5  million  people,  live  in  rural  areas.  The \npoverty prevalence survey conducted for the Kyrgyz Republic in 1999 showed that 70% of the \nrural population lived below the poverty line.1 The findings of the 2001 household budget survey \nreflected  in  the  2003  Kyrgyz  Poverty  Report2  also  showed  an  inverse  correlation  between \nschooling and the prevalence of poverty (Table A14.1).     \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n            35.8                      \n            52.6                         \n            66.7  \n            56.3                \n            68.1 \n            78.0 \n            56.4 \n\nTable A14.1: Headcount Prevalence of Poverty by Education of Household Head \n(2001) \n____________________________________________________________________________ \n   Level of Education                               Absolute Poverty (%)             Extreme Poverty (%) \n               9.9 \n   Higher/incomplete higher            \n   Secondary vocational                  \n21.8 \n \n  \n32.4 \n \n   Secondary general                        \n                          27.2 \n   Incomplete secondary                   \n36.3 \n \n   Primary                                           \n19.1 \n \n   Below primary  \n   All households \n24.7 \n \nSources: World Bank. 2001.

Regressed  data  from  the  1998  Kyrgyz  Poverty  Monitoring  Survey3  showed  that \ncompletion  of  secondary  schooling  was  associated  with  12%  higher  earnings  than  those  with \nlower level of education. Education, therefore, is an important instrument for poverty reduction. \nThe  same  study  also  found  that  the  dropout  rate  before  completing  secondary  education  is \nhigher in rural areas than in urban areas, and higher among the poor than the non-poor. \n     \nB. \n \n4. \nFinance  data  from  the  survey  of  the  90  priority  schools  conducted  in  2004  during  the \nproject  feasibility  study  indicated  that  25%  of  the  schools\u2019  recurrent  budgets  was  spent  on \nutilities and 7.5% on O&M. On average, the cost of utilities and O&M is Som278,002 ($6,620) \nper school annually. This is quite high considering schools\u2019 limited budgetary resources. \n \n5. \nThe  Project  will  significantly  reduce  recurrent  expenditures  in  covered  schools  by \nimproving management efficiency and reducing utility and maintenance costs. By improving the \nefficiency of building heating systems through repairs to windows, roofs, floors, insulation, and \nwater  supply  systems,  the  operating  cost  per  student  will  be  decreased.

Old  heating  systems  in  these \nschools  will  be  replaced  to  make  heating  facilities  of  the  school  operate  more  efficiently, \nparticularly during the harsh winter climate conditions in the rural and mountainous communities \nof  the  country.  In  addition,  these  schools  will  be  provided  with  necessary  instructional  and \ntraining  materials,  as  well  as  teaching  and  classroom  computers  and  language  laboratory \nequipment under the Project. To increase internal efficiency, 4,000 teachers and 2,000 school \ndirectors  from  almost  all  the  2,045  primary  and  secondary  schools  in  the  country  will  receive \ntraining to improve their overall quality of teaching, student assessment, and administration.  \n \nStudents  in  project-supported  schools  and  programs  will  directly  benefit  from  better \n8. \ntrained teacher, improved learning materials, and better school educational facilities. These will \nhelp  them  prepare  for  further  education,  which  will  enhance  their  potential  for  securing  viable \nemployment and future income-earning potential as educated citizens. Other economic benefits \ninclude  the  improved  viability  of  village  agriculture,  better  access  to  income  opportunities  for \ndisadvantaged  rural  students,  a  more  highly  educated  workforce  in  future  generations,  better \nquality  of  production  from  better-educated  workers,  and  greater  employability  for  educated \nKyrgyz citizens. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nThe  social  benefits  include  more  highly  educated  parents  to  guide  and  influence  their \n9. \nchildren,  expanded  opportunities  and  access  to  services  and  income,  and  reduced  risk  of \npeople suffering hardship, particularly in rural areas. \n  \n10. \nof teaching and learning standards, and an improved learning environment. \n\nTargeted benefits include an overall increase in the quality of education offered in terms \n\n \nAvailability of Adequate Funds \n\nD. \n \n11. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic macroeconomic situation stabilized significantly during 1999\u20132002. \nIn  2003,  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  by  6.7%  in  real  terms,  driven  largely  by  the \nexpansion of agriculture and industry. From 1999 to 2001, real GDP grew at an average rate of \n4.8%  per  year.  Growth  particularly  in  the  agriculture  sector  has  provided  the  necessary \nconditions for growth in the private consumption by 5.2% in 2001. The inflation rate of 39.9% in \n1999 significantly dropped to only 2.3% in 2002, the lowest rate since independence. The som has \nremained relatively stable against the US dollar, which is the predominant traded currency in the \ncountry. In the full year to December 2003, the som appreciated against the US dollar by 1.5%.  \n \n12.   Economic reforms initiated after the economic crisis in the late 1990s have significantly \ncontributed to improving the Government\u2019s annual revenue, which has increased by about 30% \nfrom  Som12.55  billion  in  2001  to  Som16.28  billion  in  2003.  Tax  revenues  rose  from  Som9.2 \nbillion  to  Som11.9  billion,  or  an  increase  of  29%,  during  the  same  period.  In  view  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  continuing  economic  growth,  particularly  in  agriculture  and  industry,  and  of \nimprovements  in  tax  administration,  the  Government  expects  to  sustain  increases  in  revenue \ncollections during the medium-term period from 2005\u20132007 (Table A14.3). \n\nTable A14.3: Consolidated Revenue Receipts \n(Som million) \n\n2005 \n20,062.5\n18,337.4\n15,044.7\n3,189.8\n1,723.1\n4,529.0\n\nItem \n\n                     2006 \n\n                   2007 \n\n19.5%\n18.7%\n18.6%\n3.2%\n0.8%\n4.5%\n\n21,999.9\n20,375.9\n16,758.7\n3,504.2\n1,624.0\n4,971.0\n\n23,771.1 \n22,737.1 \n18,747.7 \n3,864.5 \n1,034.0 \n5,479.0 \n\n          19.9 \n18.4\n15.2\n3.2\n1.5\n4.1\n\nConsolidated Budgetary Receipts \nDomestic Budgetary Revenues \nTax Revenues \nNon-Tax Revenues \nGrants including PIP grants \nExtra-Budgetary Funds (Social Fund) \nPIP = public investment plan \nSource: Ministry of Finance. 2004. Medium-Term Budget Framework. \n \n13. \nAs part of the overall strategy to develop the country, the Government has identified the \neducation  sector  as  a  priority  area  for  public  investment  under  its  medium-term  budgetary \nframework (MTBF). It has already incorporated in the budget framework for 2004\u20132007 the funds \nrequired  to  finance  public  investment  projects  including  the  cost  of  recurrent  expenditures  in  the \neducation  sector,  for  which  funding  commitments  have  already  been  negotiated.  Although  the \nrecurrent cost implications of public investment projects in the 2003\u20132007 MTBF are still indicative, \nthe  Government  also  strongly  emphasized  in  the  plan  financing  the  recurrent  costs  of  public \ninvestment  projects,  which  will  be  fully  incorporated  into  the  annual  recurrent  budget  in  future \nMTBFs. The Government budget will therefore be the main source of funds to meet the cost of \npublic  investment  projects  and  recurrent  expenditures  for  the  education  sector.  The  Country\u2019s \ncontinuing  economic  growth  and  improving  fiscal  stability  are  indicative  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncapacity to finance public investment projects such as this Project. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nFiscal Adequacy \n\nE.  \n \n14. \nA financial plan has been prepared showing details of expenditure and funding sources \nnecessary to ensure availability of resources to finance expenditures. The plan covers the entire \nimplementation  period  to  ensure  that  funds  are  available  to  cover  both  capital  and  recurrent \nexpenditures.  The  full  fiscal  impact  of  the  Project  for  each  year  of  its  implementation  is \nsummarized in Table A14.4.  \n \nTable  A14.4  shows  project  development  as  well  as  recurrent  costs  over  the  period \n15. \n2005\u20132009 based on the assumption that the GDP will continue to grow at 5.20%, the share of \neducation expenditure in the GDP will remain at 5.3%, and the share of state budget going to \neducation will increase significantly to 22.09%. The development cost of the Project is estimated \nat 0.017% of education expenditure in 2005, increasing to 0.649% in 2008, and decreasing to \n0.471% in the last project year. Project recurrent costs are insignificant as they represent only \nabout 0.049\u20130.053% of expenditure on education.   \n \n\nTable A14.4: Macroeconomic Framework for Education Financing \n \n2003 \n1,909 \n\n2004 \n2,086 \n305.31  240.59  250.10  307.28  371.05  526.33  585.34  621.09  661.67  696.49  770.23 \n\n2000 \n1,367 \n\n2001 \n1,525 \n\n2006 \n2,512 \n\n2002 \n1,601 \n\n2005 \n2,285 \n\n2009 \n2,954 \n\n2008 \n2,740 \n\n2007 \n2,766 \n\n91.40  110.96  132.22  154.44  151.47  170.17 \n\n81.35 \n\n71.44 \n\n20.80 \n\n17.37 \n\n19.80 \n\n18.96 \n\n23.25 \n\n22.02 \n\n22.71 \n\n48.07 \n\n63.67 \n\n58.83 \n\nItem \n1999 \nGDP ($ million)  1,226 \nState budget  \n($ million) \nEducation \nexpenditures. \n($ million) \nEducation \nexpenditures \nas % of state \nbudget \nGovernment \nshare \nof project \ndevelopment \ncost  \n($ million)a \nProject \ndevelopment \ncost as % of \neducation \nexpenditure \nGovernment \nShare  \nof project \nrecurrent cost \n($ million)a \nProject \nrecurrent cost \nas % of \neducation \nexpenditure \na Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n  Source: Ministry of Finance. 2004.
