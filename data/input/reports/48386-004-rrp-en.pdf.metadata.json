The report also describes (i) proposed technical assistance \n(TA)  for  Capacity  Development  and  Reform  Support  for  Railway  Sector  Development,  and  (ii) \nproposed administration of a project loan to be provided by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD), and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA and the administration of the project loan.1 \n \n2. \nThe program will provide project financing for the rehabilitation of the track and structure of \nthe Sumgayit\u2013Yalama rail line\u2014a key link in the North\u2013South Railway Corridor within the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation network. It will improve rail network serviceability (the project \nloan);  and  support  the  railway  sector  development  reforms  in  management  autonomy  and \ngovernance,  financial  restructuring,  reporting  and  control,  operational  efficiency,  and  corporate \nrestructuring (the PBL).2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSector development context. There has been a steady decline of railway market share \nin  Azerbaijan,  as  also  observed  in  other  countries  in  the  region.  Road  network  expansion  and \npipeline network improvements brought competitive pressures onto railways that compounded the \ndifficulties  imposed  on  its  infrastructure  by  the  dearth  of  investment  over  the  years.3 During the \n2000s, following major investments in the oil and gas industry and a related boom in non-tradable \nsectors  (construction  and  real  estate),  railway  sector  benefited  from  growing  resource-related \nexports and imports of construction materials and consumer goods. But the market share of rail \ntransport  continued  to  decline.  In  2006,  at  the  peak  of  the  economic  cycle  that  Azerbaijan \nexperienced, over 26.5 million tons of goods were transported by railways.4 This volume dropped \nto 22.4 million tons in 2010 and 15.5 million tons in 2016 with the current economic downturn. \n \nMacroeconomic context. With low hydrocarbon prices since mid-2014 and limited new \n4. \nopportunities  for  extracting  hydrocarbons,  the  economy  of  Azerbaijan\u2014whose  foreign  trade  is \ndominated by oil\u2014is facing macroeconomic difficulties. Two waves of currency devaluation in 2015 \naffected  consumers\u2019  purchasing  power  (especially  of  imported  goods)  and  the  stability  of  the \nfinance sector (as well as its credit origination capacity).5 Lower hydrocarbon revenues also led to \na contraction in public investments, tightening domestic demand growth. Gross domestic product \ngrowth fell from 2.8% in 2014 to 1.1% in 2015 and \u20133.8% in 2016. To cope with these shocks, the \nauthorities are deploying short-term measures to coordinate monetary, fiscal, and financial stability \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Railway  Sector \n\nDevelopment Program (TA 9154). \n\n3   Policy  issues  were  also  a  deep  root contributor  to  the  current  situation. For  example, the  railways  sector  faces  a \nparticular  cost-disadvantage  vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis  the  road  sector,  as  no  road  tolls  are  paid  by  users  in  Azerbaijan.  Road \nconstruction and maintenance is 100% paid directly by the Government. \n\n4   Of these, 54% were oil-related products (exports and transit almost equally split) and 32% were construction materials \n\n(mostly imports from the north or the south). This is only about one-third of peak rail traffic handled in the past. \n\n5   Credit to the economy declined sharply by 24% in 2016. Devaluation of the local currency in 2015\u2014with a depreciation \nof  over  100%\u2014triggered  higher  dollarization,  with  75.2%  of  deposits  in  foreign  currency  at  the  end  of  2016.  This \ncreated a severe shortage of credit.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\npolicies; 6  and  devising  finance  sector  stability  solutions  to  avoid  further  deterioration  of \nmacroeconomic conditions. \n \n5. \nCore development problem. Decades of deteriorating infrastructure and rolling stock, as \nwell  as  lack  of  commercial  orientation  in  management  and  planning  decisions,  have  affected \nrailway service competitiveness and financial viability. Lack of supporting policy and institutional \nmechanisms\u2014the  deep  root  causes  of  the  current  problems\u2014aggravated  the  financial \nperformance of Azerbaijan Railways Closed Joint Stock Company (ADY) over time, and only rising \nindebtedness  allowed  company  operations  to  continue. 7 The  recent  steep  reduction  in  freight \ndemand and the level of losses in passenger services have made the heavy legacy (institutional \nand financial) problems at ADY increasingly difficult to manage. With the economic growth decline \nin Azerbaijan, gross expenditure on railway services decreased substantially, exposing the current \nrailway problems. Crucially, while the East\u2013West rail corridor has been under modernization since \n2009,8 railway sector prospects need to be further enhanced on the North\u2013South rail corridor.9 The \nlatter has great potential once the network from Yalama (on Azerbaijan's Russian border) to Astara \n(on  the  Iranian  border)  is  upgraded,  and  the  planned  Rasht\u2013Astara  link  in  Iran  is  completed.10 \nThese  service  improvements  will  enable  ADY  to capitalize  on  the country's  crossroads  location \nand provide safer, more energy-efficient, cheaper, and less road-intensive transport. Nevertheless, \ndeep reforms are crucial for all this to be fiscally sustainable. \n \n6. \n\nADY management11 and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) face the following challenges:  \n(i) \n\ninvestments \n\nreplacement \n\nmaintaining deteriorated infrastructure and rolling stock to industry standards to avoid \nimmediate reductions in service competitiveness, while financing key infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and \nfuture  service \ncompetitiveness;  \nservicing legacy debt against stagnating free cash flow, while incurring the short-term \ncosts  of  reducing  and  rationalizing  an  oversized  workforce,  to  implement \nproductivity-enhancing changes and afford better compensation levels; and \nchanging  ineffective  management  information  and  financial  control  systems,  and \nestablishing  proper  accounting  systems  to  provide  key  financial  information  to \nsupport effective service level and pricing decisions. \n\nimprove \n\nto \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda.

Manila. \n\n7    ADY, transformed from a government railway department into a government-owned self-accounting closed joint stock \ncompany in 2009, manages the country\u2019s railway network\u2014about 2,096 track route-kilometers (km). Most of ADY\u2019s \nrevenues come from freight; passenger services lose money but are socially important.  \n\n8    Railway infrastructure modernization on the 503 km East\u2013West railway line is largely financed by the World Bank \nand  the  \u010cesk\u00e1  exportn\u00ed  banka  (Czech  Export  Bank).  This  forms  part  of  the  almost-completed  Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Kars \ncorridor, which will provide a direct link from the Caspian countries to Turkey and on to Europe. \n\n9   The unification of the railways of Azerbaijan, Iran, and the Russian Federation forms part of the International North\u2013\nSouth Transport Corridor\u2014a multimode network of ship, rail, and road routes for moving freight from Northern Europe \nto South and Southeast Asia. \n\n10   Construction of this link is expected to be launched in 2018 with funding from the governments of Azerbaijan and \n\n11   By  September  2015,  the  government  had  appointed  a  new  ADY  chairperson  and  new  members  to  the  senior \nmanagement team of ADY, empowered to have greater operational and managerial autonomy and report directly to \nthe Cabinet of Ministers (COM).  \n\nIran. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fbuilding  blocks  include  a  new  port  complex, free  trade  zones, the  North\u2013South  and  East\u2013West \nrailways,  and  a  comprehensive  set  of  legal-regulatory  reforms  in the  warehousing  and  logistics \noperations. The roadmap sets out an integrated vision for how these building blocks can create \nsynergies between the development of a logistics and trading hub in Azerbaijan and the country\u2019s \ncapacity to start attracting foreign direct investment in non-hydrocarbon processing activities. The \ndevelopment  of  the  latter  and  their  competitiveness  is  now  a  key  priority  in  the  government\u2019s \neconomic  policy.  The  government  has  launched  initiatives  to  reform  several  sectors  of  the \neconomy,  especially  those  with  prominent  state-owned  enterprises  like  ADY.  Also,  as  part  of \nstructural reform efforts to improve public financial management efficiency and develop a sound \nframework  leading  the  country  into  a  future  of  fiscal  discipline, 12 the  government  has  started \naddressing  financial  management  issues  and  operational  and  institutional  inefficiency  issues  in \nstate-owned enterprises.13  \n \n8. \nA  sustained  policy  implementation  effort  to  engineer  a  transition  towards  a  less  oil-\ndependent economy is an urgent priority, and railway development can be a crucial enabler of this \nalternative  development  path.  With  railway  infrastructure  installations  in  almost  all  strategic \nlocations of Azerbaijan (border cross points, ports, oil production and agricultural regions), railways \ncompetitiveness  can  be  essential  to  the  country\u2019s  production,  trade,  and  distribution  of  bulk \nmaterials such as agricultural products. However, reform challenges in the sector are urgent. \n \nNeed for a sector development program. The development problem summarized above \n9. \nurgently  requires  a  comprehensive  policy  and  fiscal  response  from  the  government  that  (i) \npromotes  institutional,  corporate,  financial  management  and  control,  and  labor  and  debt-\nrestructuring reforms; and (ii) makes crucial financing available to upgrade ADY\u2019s service capacity \nand/or  competitiveness.  The  railway  development  challenges  require  properly  sequenced \ninstitutional  and  corporate  reform  actions.  These  reforms  are  crucial  so  that  a  financially \nsustainable outlook for investment financing can help tackle the physical constraints to the freight \nand  passenger  businesses.  The  sector  development  program  modality  enables  multiyear \nassistance to such a sector-focused reform and investment financing agenda.14  \n \n10. \nValue addition. The program, included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country \noperations  business  plan  for  Azerbaijan,  2018\u20132020, 15  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  intervention  in \nAzerbaijan\u2019s railways.

Forthcoming. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nthe  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  Improving  Governance  and  Public  Sector  Efficiency  Program.  Manila.  There  are \ncomplementarities between the forthcoming Improving Governance and Public Sector Efficiency Program (IGPSE) \nand  the  railway  sector  development  program:  while  the  IGPSE  promotes  appropriate  corporate  and  financial \ngovernance standards across state-owned enterprises of different sectors, the proposed railways program represents \na sector-focused package of sector, financial, governance, and corporate reforms in railways.  \n\n14   ADB  has  undertaken  similar  initiatives  in  the  past.  See  for  example  the  Rajasthan  Urban  Sector  Development \nProgram: ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and \nGrant to the Republic of India for the Rajasthan Urban Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n15   ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Azerbaijan, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n16   ADB approved the program\u2019s concept paper in July 2016, and TA has supported the preparation of reforms and the \nproject design across all outputs. Key aspects of the program have also benefited from past advisory support from \nrailway stakeholders, lessons from past ADB projects, and an ongoing World Bank railway project in Azerbaijan. ADB \nhas ensured that the proposed program reforms complement past TA initiatives by other development partners (in \nsome cases by providing critical leverage). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fcomponent  synergizes  infrastructure  improvement  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  East\u2013West  and  North\u2013South \nrailway corridors to maximize the country\u2019s transit potential. In addition, since ADY\u2019s capacity is \nsignificantly stretched by the wide range of pressing challenges, ADB will allocate TA to facilitate \npolicy dialogue and support implementing further change. This will enhance the coordination with \ndevelopment partners, key ADY stakeholders and other policy makers regarding the challenging \nreform processes. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  railway  development  for  Azerbaijan  economically  sustained.  The \noutcome  will  be  rail  service  delivery  and  financial  viability  of  railway  operations  in  Azerbaijan \nimproved.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe program will have five outputs: the PBL will support reforms under outputs 1\u20134 with \ntwo tranches (tranche 1 includes 23 actions and tranche 2 includes 22 actions); the project loan \nwill  support  output  5.  A  more  detailed  elaboration  of  the  reform  outputs  summarized  below  is \nincluded in a dedicated supplementary linked document.17   \n \nOutput 1: Enhanced governance, and management and financial autonomy. ADY\u2019s \n13. \nnew management team has brought a renewed reform drive to the sector, making the case for the \nneed to enhance ADY\u2019s financial autonomy.18 To strengthen its financial autonomy, ADY was given \nstronger authority in early 2016 to set railway service tariffs. Effective adjustments in the pricing of \nfreight services still require the completion of key accounting and operational upgrades (discussed \nin  outputs  3\u20134  below).  ADY  has  undertaken  key  steps  to  start  addressing  the  loss-making \nconditions in passenger services. Proposals were submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers (COM) to \nclose profitability gaps through a combination of tariff adjustments, rationalization of service and \nintroduction of public service obligation contracts.  \n\n \n14. \nAs  a  PBL  tranche  1  action,  ADY\u2019s  legal  department  took  leadership  in  drafting  and \nsubmitting  to  COM  a  law  for  railways,  introducing,  inter  alia,  an  openness  to  private  sector \nparticipation. Approval of this law on railways is a condition for PBL tranche 2 release, as well as \nreforms on the pricing of ADY\u2019s passenger services and the pilot introduction of (i) public service \nobligation contracts in case ADY is mandated to operate routes at a loss, and (ii) performance-\nbased contractual solutions for operational maintenance subsidies. Establishment of a Supervisory \nBoard for ADY and other key corporate governance upgrades are also part of the conditionality of \nPBL tranche 2. As covenanted in the program\u2019s loan agreement, railway sector financing solutions \nwill be mainstreamed from the piloting results before the program completion. \n \nOutput 2: Effective financial restructuring of ADY\u2019s debt liabilities. The debt legacy \n15. \non  the  books  of  ADY  cannot  be fully  serviced  by  ADY. This  over-indebtedness  and  the  related \nconstant  financial  distress  and  uncertainty  that  it  produces  make  it  extremely  difficult  for  ADY \nmanagement to plan reforms and implement a financial and business turnaround. The government \nhas committed to shouldering the debt-service obligations connected with ADY\u2019s state-guaranteed \nliabilities until term end. For its remaining debt liabilities, discussions on a three-phase financial \nrestructuring plan began in late 2015 to enable ADY to avoid default. The three-phase plan was \n\n                                                 \n17   Railway Sector Development Program Reform Outputs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n18   Although the government established ADY\u2019s operational and institutional autonomy in 2009, little subsequent reform \n\noccurred until mid-2015. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fformalized in October 2017.19 MOF and ADY executed the first phase of financial restructuring in \nmid-2017,  including  restructuring  of  the  debt  from  commercial  creditors, 20  and  established  a \nspecial escrow account (automatically credited with a proportion of ADY\u2019s monthly revenues) for \nthe sole purpose of servicing ADY\u2019s main liabilities in a specific order of priority.21  \n \n16. \nImplementation of the second phase of the financial restructuring plan is a PBL tranche 2 \ncondition,  together  with  validation  by  a  reputable  third  party  of  the  assumptions  and  financing \nrequirements considered in the original plan. The phased approach in the financial restructuring \nplan  enables  its  implementation  and  the  fiscal  support  for  it  to  remain  intertwined  with  the \nconditionality  proposed.22 This  provides  an  incentivized  way  of  dealing  with  ADY\u2019s  debt  legacy \nproblem.  As  covenanted  in  the  program\u2019s  loan  agreement,  the  third  phase  of  the  financial \nrestructuring plan is to be implemented before the program completion. \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  Improved  financial  and  management  control  and  reporting.  ADY\u2019s \naccounting  processes  are  mostly  manual,  and  the  financial  reporting  that  is  produced  (e.g., \nquarterly management accounts) is not timely. This impairs management decisions. ADY\u2019s current \ncost accounting systems are not useful for analytical purposes (e.g., proper pricing or planning of \nservice  provision  levels)  either.  ADY  is  implementing  a  comprehensive  set  of  financial \nmanagement control and reporting changes (and system upgrades23) to address this fundamental \nhandicap.  To  enhance  financial  control,  ADY\u2019s  ongoing  activities  under  tranche  1  include  the \nrevamping of its finance department, centralization of the registry for all contracts, consolidation of \nall bank accounts into a single-ledger bank account, and centralization of all payment-authorization \nresponsibilities  with  the  newly  appointed  chief  financial  officer.  ADY  also  established  effective \ninternal audit functions. The continuation of these efforts in 2018 will fundamentally upgrade ADY\u2019s \nfinancial management and reduce fiduciary concerns.  \n \n18. \nAs  conditions for tranche  2,  ADY  will  have  to  establish  a  risk management system,  and \nfinalize the implementation of the integrated financial and management accounting and financial \nreporting  and/or  control  system.  This  is  expected  to  enable  ADY\u2019s  financial  governance  and \nanalytical  cost-accounting  capacity  and  cost-recovery  pricing.  ADY  will  also  have  to  initiate  the \n\n                                                 \n19   With  ADB  TA  support,  ADY  and  MOF  estimated  the  total  required  fiscal  effort  to  bring  ADY  to  a  sustainable  debt \nservice coverage ratio by 2020 at $600 million. The financial restructuring plan registers that these fiscal injections \nshould at least be in the form of subordinated loans, with high levels of concessionality in terms (at least 3 years of \ngrace period and 15 years of term). The plan, comprising $200 million for each phase, also articulated the benefits of \nexecuting  these  injections  as  new  equity,  and  agreement  was  reached  with  ADB  to  revisit  the  issue  during  the \nimplementation  of  phases  2  and  3,  as  elaborated  in  the  Railway  Sector  Development  Program  Reform  Outputs \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). It is expected as a result of the compact of reform and \ninvestment  interventions  under  the  program,  these  improvements  can  be  sustained  further  and  a  debt  service \ncoverage ratio of 1.2 can be achieved and maintained by 2022 (see related performance indicators in Appendix 1). \n20   In each phase of the plan, ADY and MOF are expected to target the most expensive and short-term liabilities of ADY \nfor  either  full  debt  retirement,  or  renegotiation  of  terms  with  the  respective  creditors  (to  include  the  stretching  of \nmaturities, lowering of terms, granting of grace periods, and/or waiver of loan covenants in case of loans already in \narrears). Targeted creditors will see a reduction of their net present value and ADY will gradually push forward the \ntime  profile  of  its  total  debt  servicing  responsibilities.  Ex-ante  execution  and  evaluation  of  each  phase  is  a  policy \ncondition under each tranche release of the PBL. \n\n21   As a condition for PBL tranche 2, the arrangements of the special escrow account will need to be reviewed, to take \n\nADY\u2019s liquidity management challenges into account.  \n\n22   Debt restructuring per se will not have a sustainable impact on the underlying operational profitability of ADY. But the \napproval of a funding plan for the debt restructuring effort that is crucially needed will (a) avoid debt default, and (b) \nenable ADY management to focus on the actual reform agenda that can lift ADY\u2019s business performance. \n\n23   The implementation of an integrated financial and management accounting and financial reporting system is largely \nsupported under the ongoing Rail Trade and Transport Facilitation Project financed by the World Bank. World Bank. \n2008.  Rail  Trade  and  Transport  Facilitation  Project.  http://projects.worldbank.org/P083108/rail-trade-transport-\nfacilitation?lang=en  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fprocurement  for  a  credit  rating  from  an  international  rating  agency  as  a  tranche  2  condition. \nPreparation for such an in-depth assessment will generate additional momentum for improvements \nin ADY\u2019s finance department. As covenanted in the program\u2019s loan agreement, ADY is to obtain a \ncredit rating before the program completion. \n \n19. \nOutput  4:  Enhanced  operational  efficiency  and  effective  corporate  restructuring. \nADY approved its organizational/corporate restructuring implementation plan in September 2017. \nIn  addition,  from  the  establishment  of  a  centralized  procurement  department,  to  the  pilot \nintroduction of outsourcing solutions and the elimination of 10 subsidiaries, ADY has started taking \nimportant  steps  to  develop  into  a  more  focused,  leaner  and  better  performing  corporate  group. \nADY has also initiated the establishment of effective human resource management functions to \nsupport  the  preparation  and  execution  of  a  time-bound  (with  concrete  targets),  multi-optional \n(regular and corporate retirement, labor rationalization initiatives, etc.) labor restructuring plan. The \nlatter  was  approved  in  October  2017.  An  open-ledger  of  operational  and  non-operational  key \nperformance indicators, to be monitored and reported regularly was set up in September 2017. \nThis will set the stage for deeper operational efficiency efforts across the board. ADY\u2019s property \ncommercialization  efforts  have  also  made  progress  from  2016  to  September  2017,  with  ADY\u2019s \nproperty assets inventory and valuation program substantially completed. Submission to COM of \na Business Plan to integrate these business and corporate restructuring efforts within an effective \nstrategy will lock-in commitments going forward. \n \n20. \nAs  a  condition  for  tranche  2,  and  with  support  of  expert  advice,  ADY  will  finalize  a \ncomprehensive  review  of  its  operational  efficiency  levels,  and  build  on  it  to  update  relevant \noperational  key  performance  indicator  (KPI)  targets  going  forward.  ADY  will  also  study  the \nfeasibility of establishing operational performance auditing requirements, as a condition for tranche \n2.  ADY  will  fully  implement  an  infrastructure  traffic  planning  system (i.e., for time-tabling freight \nand passenger services). A formal and strategic separation of core and non-core assets will take \nplace during PBL tranche 2. ADY will submit commercialization and privatization plans for non-\ncore assets to MOF and the Ministry of Economy, including a proposal to privatize non-core assets \nand expedite improvements in non-core revenue generation.24  \n \n21. \nOutput  5:  Infrastructure  of  the  Sumgayit\u2013Yalama  rail  line  improved.  Through  this \noutput,  the  project  will  rehabilitate  about  166  kilometers  (km)  of  double-line  main  track  from \nSumgayit  to  Yalama,  including  civil  structures  and  level  crossings.  Other  existing  facilities, \nincluding  signaling, telecommunications,  and  electrification  systems,  will  continue  as  at present \nbut  with  increased  maintenance  funding.  This  output  will  also  comprise  consulting  services  to \ndevelop  future  projects,  including  a  phased  strategy  for  the  improvement  of  other  key  railway \nassets.  This  includes  electrification,  signaling,  and  telecommunications  to  complete  the \nmodernization of the North\u2013South Railway Corridor from Yalama to Astara.  \n  \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Investment and Financing Plans  \n\n22. \nThe PBL will help the government bear the fiscal costs of the policy reforms outlined in the \ngovernment\u2019s development policy letter (Appendix 3) and the policy matrix (Appendix 4). The size \nof the PBL was determined on the basis of (i) the fiscal support required to prepare, implement, \nand  monitor  the  proposed  policy  actions,  including  system  capacity  needs  of  ADY;  and  (ii)  an \n\n                                                 \n24   As covenanted in the program\u2019s loan agreement, the implementation of the Operations Management System and \nthe labor restructuring plan, and the achievement of operational and non-operational KPI targets remains on schedule \nbefore the completion of the program. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fassessment  of  the government\u2019s  overall fiscal  resources  and  allocation for the railway  sector.25  \nThe government has requested a PBL of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and \na policy loan of $75 million from AFD, which is not administered by ADB, in support of the PBL \ncomponent of the program.  \n \n23. \nThe  project  component  of  the  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $325  million  (Table  1).  The \ngovernment has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the project component. Government counterpart financing for the project component will \nbe  $75  million  equivalent  covering  taxes  and  duties,  maintenance  of  existing  signaling  and \nelectrification  on  the  project  rail  line,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  contingencies.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  to  ADY  through  a  subsidiary \nagreement.  AFD  is  expected  to  provide  a  loan  of  $100  million  equivalent  to  jointly  finance  the \nproject works contract, and ADB will partially administer the AFD loan by providing services on \nprocurement, safeguards, and review of withdrawal applications. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\n              Subtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \nInfrastructure improvement for the Sumgayit\u2013Yalama rail line \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancing Charges During Implementationd \n \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n \nB.  \nC.  \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of $36.1 million to be financed from the Government of Azerbaijan\u2019s resources. \nb  In mid-2017 prices.

The ADB PBL will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate (LIBOR)-based  lending facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The ADB project loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, straight-line repayment method, an \nannual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (interest  and  other  charges  during  construction  to  be \ncapitalized  in  the  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and \nproject  agreements.  Based  on  this,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  15.25  years  and  the  maturity \npremium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum.  \n \n\n                                                 \n25   Railway reform adjustment costs\u2014many of which relate to resolving legacy debt, staff rationalization, formalization \nof subsidy solutions and other costs of corporate restructuring\u2014 are estimated in excess of $900 million over the \nduration  of  the  program.  The  PBL  will  help  fund  part  of  these  fiscal  costs,  taking  into  account  the  government\u2019s \ngeneral  funding  requirements.

Tranche 1 is expected \n25. \nto  be  released  when  loans  become  effective.  Tranche  2  policy  actions  will  be  completed  as  a \ncondition for Tranche 2 release (expected in 2019). ADY has established a program management \noffice (PMO) for the program implementation. The PMO, consisting of a policy support unit and a \nproject  implementation  unit,  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  management  of  the  program \nincluding  procurement,  financial  management,  loan  covenant  compliance,  support  with  the \nimplementation  of  the  tranche  release  policy  actions  under  the  PBL,  and  liaison  with  ADB. \nIncremental  operational  expenses  of  the  PMO  will  be  financed  out  of  the  loan  funds  to  attract \ncompetitive staff. \n \n26. \nAll procurement financed under the ADB loan and AFD loan partially administered by ADB \nwill follow international competitive bidding procedures pursuant to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time) and will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior review. As AFD is expected \nto  cofinance  the  program  and  ADB  is  expected  to  partially  administer  the  AFD financing  of the \nproject  component  of  the  program,  universal  procurement  will  be  applied.26 ADB  will  recruit  the \nconsultants\u2014for the construction supervision and subsequent project development to be financed \nunder the ADB loan\u2014following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time).

The $250 million PBL will be \ndisbursed in two tranches, tranche 1 of $175 million and tranche 2 of $75 million.a \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADY = Azerbaijan Railways Closed Joint Stock Company, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise \nde D\u00e9veloppement, MOF = Ministry of Finance, PBL = policy-based loan, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \na The front-loading of resources in ADB\u2019s PBL is justified by two factors: (i) AFD's approval time line (expected in the \nsecond  quarter  of  2018)  does  not  allow  its  policy  loan  ($75  million)  to  be  disbursed  along  ADB\u2019s  tranche  1;  and \n(ii) MOF\u2019s direct fiscal outlays in 2017 into ADY, as a result of tranche 1 conditionalities, have been substantial. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n27. \nThe  proposed  transaction  TA  will  support  capacity  development  and  reforms  at  ADY, \nfocusing on outputs 1\u20134 with certain support for output 5. The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, \nof which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources). The government through ADY will provide counterpart support in the form \nof counterpart staff, office space, workshop venues, and other in-kind contributions. ADY will be \nthe  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be  implemented  over  3  years  during  program \nimplementation.28 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n28. \nThe  project  design  compared  various  rehabilitation  options  and  considered  track \nrehabilitation most appropriate given the traffic characteristics, service condition of railway systems, \nand competing demands for limited funds among railway assets. Comprehensive track renewal of \nthe rail line will enable the commercial speed for freight to be restored from an average of 25 km \nper hour to 60 km per hour.  \n \n29. \nThe  project  activity  qualifies  as  climate  mitigation  as  it  promotes  the  reduction  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions by a modal shift to a low-carbon transport mode. Climate change risk \nfactors in the project area include sea level rise, rising temperatures, and increased frequency and \nmagnitude  of  flooding  caused  by  increased  intensity  of  single  rainfall  events.  The  project  will \nincorporate  climate-proofing  design  in  the track  rehabilitation,  including  continuous  welded  rails \nand improved drainages.   \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic viability. ADB carried out an economic analysis of the project loan, comparing \n30. \nthe incremental changes in costs and benefits arising from the project against a without-project \nscenario that assumes continued and gradual deterioration of the railway link between Sumgayit \nand Yalama.29  The current and forecast traffic with and without the project was assessed based \non detailed data provided by ADY; an analysis of prospective flows on the North\u2013South Transport \nCorridor;  an  analysis  of  international  trade  traffic  data  (from  statistics  provided  by  the  United \nNations,  European  Union,  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States,  and  other  countries);  and \nthrough the comparison of alternative routes. The main economic benefits are (i) time savings for \nfreight traffic and passengers; (ii) vehicle operating cost savings; (iii) reduced externalities (carbon \n\n                                                 \n28   Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29  ADB conducted the analysis based on ADB. 1997.

The  project  is \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 12.4% and a net present value of \n$118.6 million at a 9.0% discount rate.  \n \nFinancial viability. To ascertain the project\u2019s financial viability, ADB conducted a financial \n31. \nanalysis of the project30  on an incremental basis to compare cash flow with and without the project. \nThe financial internal rate of return is 6.7%, exceeding the calculated weighted average cost of \ncapital  of  2.3%.  The  project  remains  economically  and  financially  viable  against  key  variables, \nincluding a capital cost increase of 20% and traffic reduced by 20%.  \n\n \n32. \nFinancial sustainability of ADY. The PBL component of the program will strengthen the \nfinancial  capacity  of  ADY  and  the  government  to  implement  the  project.  Assuming  a  gradual \nphasing-in of the financial benefits to be realized from implementation of reform measures through \ndelivery  of  4  PBL  outputs,  ADY\u2019s  operating  income  will  grow  faster  than  that  of  the  no-reform \nscenario, which will be critical for ADY to remain a going concern, averting default situation,31 and \ncome back to a financially sustainable level of service delivery competitiveness.32  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\n33. \nADY\u2019s financial management and reporting systems need strengthening. ADY is on track \nto begin operation of its integrated financial and management accounting, and financial reporting \nand control system, in early 2018. Under the project loan, direct payments for large contracts will \nbe used. An advance account will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, and all \npayments to contractors and consultants below a certain threshold will be made from the account \nwith the endorsement of responsible senior staff in ADY and MOF. Overall financial management \nrisk  is  considered  substantial  before  the  mitigation  measures  and  moderate  afterward.33 ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment  and  ADY.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 27). \n  \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nAzerbaijan  has  made  significant  progress  in  reducing  poverty.  But  the  developments  in \n34. \nemployment growth and poverty reduction have largely been skewed in favor of Baku instead of \nrural  areas  and  non-Baku  urban  areas.  The  government\u2019s  various  poverty  reduction  and \ndevelopment programs now emphasize, among others, inclusive growth, poverty reduction, and \ninfrastructure  development.  The  project  will  improve  the  rail  network  efficiency  and  reduce \ntransport costs and travel time, bringing a positive impact on poverty alleviation for rural areas and \nnon-Baku urban areas along the project railway. The primary beneficiaries will be passengers and \nfreight transporters, including mobile vendors, shippers, freight transporters, and producers.  \n \n                                                 \n30  In accordance with ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n31   Debt default would shut down ADY\u2019s access to private credit markets\u2014for formal finance and operational trade credit \n\u2014 in the foreseeable future, and imply Government direct funding of every single capital replacement item going \nforward. The soft-budget constrains regime of the past would likely set in again, and the fiscal cost of this railway \nsector scenario would be augmented by such circumstances. \n\n32   Financial (Fiscal) Impact Assessment of Railway Sector Reforms (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n33   The bidding documents for the works contract will include provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit all project records \nand accounts, as well as those of all contractors, suppliers, and other service providers as they relate to the project. \nKey measures to ensure proper governance are (i) independent external auditing of contracts, project accounts, and \nfinancial  statements;  (ii)  transparent  decision  processes  for  all  procurement  matters;  and  (iii)  verification  of \ncontractors\u2019 payment claims by the supervision consultant and oversight by the project implementation agency. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fGender. The project loan is classified some gender elements. It is expected to bring certain \n35. \nbenefits to women, including reduced travel time and easy access to public and business facilities, \nadditional  employment  opportunities,  and  improved  railway  safety  from  the  reconstruction  of \noverpasses and bridges, installation of safety fences and lighting, rest areas with separate toilets \nfor men and women, and a community safety awareness campaign. Advertisements for project-\nrelated  jobs  will  include  that  women  are  encouraged  to  apply.  ADY  will  implement  a  skills \ndevelopment  program  under  the  PBL,  and  ensure  30%  participation  by  women.  ADY  will  also \ndesign a new pricing strategy for passenger services that incorporates measures to mitigate any \npotential negative impact on the poor, women, children, and the elderly. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nSocial safeguards. The project loan is classified category B for involuntary resettlement \n36. \nand  category  C for  indigenous  peoples.  Meaningful  public  consultations were  conducted  and  a \ndraft  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)34 was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 5 October 2017. ADY has \noverall  responsibility  for  LARP  finalization  and  implementation.  It  has  adequate  institutional \ncapacity and is committed to managing social safeguard compliance. The construction supervision \nconsultant will monitor LARP implementation. The PMO will ensure the project complies with social \nsafeguards loan covenants, including semiannual social safeguard monitoring reporting. No land \nacquisition and resettlement impact is expected for the PBL.35 \n \n37. \nEnvironmental safeguards. The project loan is classified category B for environmental \nsafeguards.  Meaningful  public  consultations  were  conducted  and  an  initial  environmental \nexamination was prepared in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement and disclosed on \nADB\u2019s website on 7 November 2017. Project impacts during construction are expected to be site-\nspecific,  temporary,  and  related  to  the  direct  replacement  of  track,  such  as  noise  in  residential \nareas, dust and exhaust emissions from equipment, impacts of bridge rehabilitation on the crossing \nrivers,  and  waste  management.  During  operations,  potential  noise  and  vibration  impacts  are \nexpected from the increased train speed and frequency after track improvement. The project will \nimprove railway safety by fencing along the whole alignment. An environmental management plan \nprovides mitigation and monitoring measures, as well as a capacity building plan for the PMO and \nADY.  Contractors  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  mitigation  measures.  The  loan  has \nallocated funds for institutional strengthening, including safeguard compliance and railway safety \nimprovement. The PMO will ensure the project complies with the environmental loan covenants, \nincluding  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reporting.
