Adhikari \n \n\nThe  northeast  power  region  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  comprises  the  provinces  of  Jilin, \nHeilongjiang, Liaoning and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Mine-mouth coal-fired power generating \nplants are located in the sparsely populated, northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, while the energy-\nconsuming areas are mainly in the industrial south of Liaoning Province. Hence, considerable benefit can be \nrealized by interconnecting the north and the south.  The first part of such interconnection from Heilongjiang \nProvince to Shenyang in Liaoning Province was completed in June 2001 under an Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  loan.  This  Project  was  designed  to  complete  the  interconnection  by  extending  the  transmission  line \nfurther  south  thereby  increasing  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  electricity  transmission  from  Shenyang  to \nDalian  in  Liaoning  Province,  thereby  increasing  the  availability  and  reliability  of  electricity  supply  in  the \nprovince  through  putting  in  place  an  integrated  regional  grid  that  facilitates  establishment  of  a  regional \ncompetitive power market as envisage by the Government. \n \n b. Objectives or Expected Outcomes: \n  \nThe  principle  objective  of  the  Project  was  to  increase  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  electricity  transmission \nfrom  the  northeastern  part  of  the  PRC  to  the  southern  part  of  Liaoning  Province,  thereby  increasing  the \navailability  of  electricity  and  the  reliability  of  electricity  transmission  and  distribution  systems  in  Liaoning \nProvince  and  avoiding  harmful  emissions  associated  with  new  power  generation  in  the  densely  populated \nsouthern part of Liaoning Province. Other objectives were to complete the upgrading and expansion of rural \nelectrification in the relatively poor rural areas of Liaoning Province and to develop an integrated regional grid \nthat will enable restructuring of the power sector in Liaoning Province.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f 2 \n\n c. Outputs: \n\n \nAt appraisal, the specific outputs were expected to be: \n(i) \n\nelectricity transmission \n\n(a)  construction of a single-circuit, 500 kV transmission line of 502 km from Shenyang to Dalian.  \n(b)  extension of four 500 kV substations at Shaling, Xujia, Wangshi, and Nanguanling and construction    of a 500 \n\nkV substation at Shendong \n\n(c)  installation of communication systems and environmental monitoring equipment \n\n(ii) \n\nelectricity transmission expansion and upgrading \n(a)  upgrading and expansion of the Shenyang electricity network, including the upgrading of 220kV substations at \n\n(b)  upgrading and expansion of the Dalian electricity network \n(c)  upgrading and expansion of the Nanguanlin-Yanshu electricity network, including the construction of a 220kV \n\nTaiyuan and Suncheng \n\nsusbstation at Yanshui \n\ninstallation of 66 kV transformers and rehabilitation of existing 66 kV transformers \n\nrural electrification upgrading and expansion in the poverty counties of Kangpin, Xiuyan, and Xinbin and the \npoverty city of Zhuanghe \n(a)  construction of 66 kV transmission lines \n(b) \n(c)  upgrading of 10 kV distribution lines \n(d)  upgrading and replacement of low voltage transformers and installation of new capacitors \n(e) \n(f)  provision of energy efficient lighting \n\ntraining of staff in rural electricity supply companies in operation and maintenance of low voltage networks \n\nupgrading of urban distribution in Shenyang and Dalian \ncompetitive power market development -  (a)  study on transmission and distribution tariff distribution, restructuring \nof LEPC, and network management improvement; and  (b)  domestic training of Liaoning Electric Power Company \n(LEPC) staff \nconsulting services for project implementation \ninternational training of LEPC staff in management of a power grid company in a competitive market \nclosure of 10 coal-fired power generation units (with a total capacity of 437 MW) in Liaoning Province. \n\n3. Evaluation of Design and Implementation (Evaluator assessment of actual vs. envisioned) \n  \n a.  Relevance of design and formulation: \n  \n\nThe  design  and  formulation  of  the  project  was rated  as relevant.  It  was  in  line  with  the Government\u2019s main \nobjective  of  increasing  the  supply  of  power  to  support  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth.  Providing  support  to \nachieve economic growth in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner was the central theme of ADB\u2019s \noperational strategy for the PRC. More specifically, ADB focused on three strategic objectives: (i) efficiency \nimprovements,  (ii)  environmental  protection,  and  (iii)  growth  promotion  in  less  developed provinces.  Finally, \nthe  project  was  a  logical extension  of  ADB\u2019s  support  to  strengthen  the  provincial  and regional  transmission \nnetwork to optimize utilization of existing power sources in the northeast power grid.   \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n  \nb.

This  was  mainly  attributed  to  very \ncompetitive bidding and design refinements during detailed design. The appraisal estimate was based on \npreliminary designs and costs. Major differences in the cost of individual items included (appraisal versus \nactual) several items but most notably the Dalian Electricity Network which increased by over 5 times. No \nexplanation is given for this in the PCR. Land acquisition also cost about 1.7 times the appraisal estimate. \nSome  cost  items  were  considerably  below  appraisal  estimates  but  these  were  small  items  including \ncontingencies, which were not needed. Domestic training costs were apparently absorbed by LEPC and not \nquantified. The only significant, although small financially,  deviation was not meeting a poverty reduction \ncomponent involving the provision of 100,000 compact florescent light bulbs to the poorest households in \nthree poverty counties and one poverty city. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f 4 \n\n \n\n c. Project Cost, Disbursements, Borrower Contribution, and Conformance to Schedule (as relevant to \n\nproject performance): \n\nProject costs were generally within estimates. There were no delays in the provision of counterpart funds. \nFollowing the delayed effectiveness of the loan, the disbursement was revised. Initial disbursements were \nslow  but  caught  up  in  the  last  three  years  of  implementation.  Adjusting  for  the  10  month  delay  in  loan \neffectiveness,  the  implementation  schedule  was  generally  followed  except  for  part  of  the  Rural \nElectrification Upgrading, which delayed project completion by about four months. \n\n \n d. Implementation Arrangements, Conditions and Covenants, and related Technical Assistance:  \n  \n\nLEPC was the executing agency and remained as such following a major restructuring of the power sector \nby the Government. The restructuring did not affect project implementation except for the rural component \ninvolving the installation of 100,000 energy efficient florescent light bulbs in poverty areas, which was not \nundertaken. \n \nThe loan covenants were designed to cover sector reforms, tariff and enterprise reforms and governance, \nenvironmental  and  social  impact,  financial  performance  of  the  EA,  and  implementation  issues.  The  loan \ncovenants  were  generally  complied  with.  The  covenant  involving  tariff  reform  was  not  fully  met  as  it  is  a \nsector issue but progress was made on tariff unification. The PCR stated that \u201c\u2026significant progress has \nbeen  achieved  in  the  PRC\u2026\u201d  in  this  regard.  The  covenants  on  environment  and  social  impacts  were \ncomplied  with.  Concerning  the  financial  covenants,  LEPC\u2019s  return  on  assets  was  low  compared  with \nappraisal  estimates,  mainly  because  it  lost  many  of  its  better-performing  generating  assets.  Appraisal \nestimates of transmission tariffs were high resulting in a lower return on assets. \n \nThe related TA was provided to help LEPC prepare the project to meet ADB requirements, particularly in \nthe  areas  of  environmental  impact  assessment,  resettlement,  procurement,  project  implementation,  and \neconomic and financial analyses. \n\n \n\n \n\n  e. Performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency: \n \n\nThe  performance  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  representing  the  Government  as  the  borrower,  was \nconsidered  satisfactory.  MOF  helped  to  facilitate  completion  of  the  requirements  for  the  loan  to  become \neffective.  Loan  effectiveness  was  delayed  by  10  months  and  coincided  with  submission  of  the  first  loan \nwithdrawal application.  This simply represents good fiscal management on the part of MOF and suggests \nthat  loan  approval  dates  should  be  more  realistic  especially  given  approval  of  advance  action  and \nretroactive financing, which does not place any pressure on ministries of finance. \n \nLEPC as the executing agency was considered to have performed in a generally satisfactory manner. The \nproject was implemented within budget and within the schedule except for some works and completion of a \nrevised rural poverty component, issues beyond the control of LEPC.  \n\n \n  f.  Performance of the Asian Development Bank: \n \n\nADB\u2019s  performance  in  monitoring  the  project  was  considered  generally  satisfactory.  Most  issues  were \nresolved  quickly  and  loan  savings  cancelled  in  a  timely  manner.  Two  issues  arose  concerning  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements.  One  involved  the  standard  of  insulation  to  be  used.  ADB  rightly  insisted  on  international \nstandards to ensure that the international bidding would be competitive. The other involved the installation \nof  100,000  efficient  light  bulbs  in  poor  households.  With  sector  reform,  LEPC  had  been  turned  into  a \ntransmission company with its distribution mandate assigned to another company. Thus, LEPC considered \nthat it could not distribute and install light bulbs. LEPC suggested an alternative subcomponent too help the \npoor,  which  was  accepted  by  ADB.  This  alternative  involved:  (i)  road  construction  and  upgrading,  (ii) \nrenovation  and  upgrading  of  school  buildings  and  facilities,  (iii)  construction  of  a  bridge,  and  (iv) \nconstruction of school boarding facilities. If installing light bulbs is outside the mandate of LEPC, then it is \ndifficult to understand how building roads, bridges, and school facilities are within its mandate. This is not \nexplained in the PCR. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n4. Evaluation of Performance (Evaluator assessment): \n\n \n a. Relevance \n     The project was \u201chighly relevant\u201d. See 3. a. above. \n \n b. Effectiveness in Achieving Outcome \n\nThe project was \u201ceffective\u201d.  \n\n \n c. Efficiency in Achieving Outcome and Outputs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe project was \u201chighly efficient\u201d and is reportedly running at or near capacity. \n\n d. Preliminary Assessment of Sustainability \n\nSustainability is \u201clikely\u201d. The transmission tariffs have been set to allow for maintenance, operations and \ndebt payment. The financial assessment at appraisal uses a depreciation rate of 4.36 percent while the \nPCR uses a depreciation rate of 6.0 percent. The effect of this cannot be evaluated as the presentation \nin  the  appendix  of  the  PCR  is  a  summary.  This  change  was  not  explained  in  the  PCR;  its  possible \neffects on sustainability need to be evaluated. The depreciation rates used appear to be on higher side \n\u2013 (i) Transmission has a 50 year span, hence 2% is appropriate. Larger Transformers would be around \n25  years,  for  which  a  higher  rate  say  4%.  The  sustainability  analysis  should  have  examined  the \ncompany finances to determine long term viability.   \n\n \n e. Impact (both intended and unintended) \n\nNo  serious  unintended  impacts  were  identified.  The  intended  impact  of  the  installation  of  100,000 \nenergy efficient light bulbs and accompanying savings to poor families was not realized. No evaluation \nwas undertaken of the impacts of the substitute works for the rural poor were assessed. \n\n5. Overall Assessment, Lessons, and Recommendations (Evaluator assessment): \n \n\n a. Overall Assessment \n\nOverall  the  project  was  successful.  It  was  completed  within  LEPC\u2019s  budget  and  reasonably  close  to  the \noriginal schedule taking into account the delay in making the loan effective. The only component that was not \nundertaken was the installation of 100,000 light bulbs but this was replaced with works designed to improve \nthe conditions of the rural poor in selected locations.  \n\n \n b. Lessons \n\n(i)  Responsible ministries of finance are not going to meet the requirements of loan effectiveness until they \n\nare ready to utilize the loan. The effect of this needs to be evaluated. \n\n(ii)  Projects  based  on  preliminary  design  will  experience  design  and  cost  changes  and,  in  some  cases, \n\nunintended environmental and social effects. \n\n(iii)  This  project  was  prepared  knowing  that  a  major  restructuring  of  the  power  sector  was  imminent.  The \nscope  of  the  project  and  related  covenants  might  have  been  improved  if  it  had  been  prepared  after \nrestructuring had been implemented. \n\n(iv)  Sector policy changes require considerable time especially in large countries where many issues and \n\npossible positive and negative effects must be evaluated. Adequate time for such issues to be resolved \nshould be allowed. \n\nRecommendations follow the lessons learned above: \n(i)  always evaluate the effect of delayed loan effectiveness on ADB and country considerations and \n\nc. Recommendations \n\nproject implementation \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii)  evaluate the effect of basing projects on preliminary design \n(iii)  understanding the effects of sector restructuring would help improve project design \n(iv)  implementation and disbursement schedules should take past experience into account \n(v)  recognize that significant policy decisions may require considerable time to prepare and implement \n(vi)  the financial evaluation assumptions in the PCR should be the same as those used at appraisal. If \nnot, an explanation should be provided. Company finances should be looked in to while assessing \nlong term viability. \n\n 6. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization (Evaluator assessment): \n\nThe  design  of  the  project  involved  mainly  civil  works  and  some  training.  Results  are  easily  confirmed  as  such  projects \ngenerally have very good records. There are no significant issues to be brought out here. \n\n 7. Other (Safeguards, including governance and anticorruption; Fiduciary aspects):  \n\nSafeguards  were  complied  with  including  environmental  and  resettlement  concerns  were  handled  well. \nFiduciary aspects appear to have been well handled. \n\n8.

Comments on PCR Quality: \n \n\nBased on:  \n\u2022  Quality and completeness of evidence and analysis to substantiate claimed ratings \n\u2022  Consistency with PCR Guidelines (PAI 6.07) \n\u2022  PCR  Candor  and  internal  consistency;  consistency  of  narrative/ratings  with  monitoring  indicators,  other \n\ndata \n\n\u2022  Candid, accurate consideration of exogenous factors (positive and negative) and attribution of results \n\u2022  Extent to which lessons and recommendations are based on evidence and analysis \n \n \nThe PCR is generally satisfactory but it raises a few matters that should have been adjusted. \n\u2022  The cancelled loan amount of $37.0 million is not included in the basic data \n\u2022  The  basis  for  changing  the  depreciation  rate  from  that  used  at  appraisal  is  not  explained,  company \n\nfinance not analyzed. \n\n\u2022  The change in the rural component seems to be an after thought. The substituted rural components and \ntheir impact on poverty is not explained nor is how these components come under the purview of LEPC. \n\n\fREGIONAL DEPARTMENT\u2019S RESPONSE TO THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT \nVALIDATION REPORT \n\n \n \nOn 22 September 2007, Director, OED2 received the following comments from Energy Division \nof East Asia Regional Department. \n \n \nWe have reviewed the Project Completion Report (PCR) Validation report and found it generally \nsatisfactory.  We  have  following  clarifications  on  the  comments  stated  in  the  PCR  Section  9. \nComments on PCR Quality.  \n \nThe reason why the PCR used a higher depreciation rate of 6% compared to the 4.36% \n1. \nused  at  appraisal  is  to  align  it  with  the  grid  company  practices  established  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China.  Please  note  that  the  PCR  for  the  Yunnan  Dachaoshan  Transmission  Line \nProject (L 1644-PRC) circulated in 2005, a comparable transmission line project, also adopted a \n6% depreciation rate. The accelerated depreciation rate adopted in the PCR has resulted in a \nmore conservative financial projection of the project company while not affecting its viability. \n\n2. \nRegarding the change in rural electrification component (100,000 energy efficient fittings \nin  poorest  households  of  4  poverty  counties),  we  have  noted  the  comment  made  in  the  PCR. \nDue to limited page numbers a detailed explanation could not be included in the PCR. However, \nplease note that Liaoning Electric Power Company did not implement these alternative projects \non  its  own,  but  provided  the  funds  (comparable  to  the  cost  of  original  component)  for  the \nrelevant county governments' specific priority rural development projects. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nPCR \nEA \nLEPC \nMOF \nOCR \nOED \nPRC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nproject completion report \nexecuting agency \nLiaoning Electric Power Company \nMinistry of Finance \nordinary capital resources \nOperations Evaluation Department \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \n", " \n", "Key Words \n \nasian development bank, China, energy, distribution, generation, performance evaluation, power, project \ncompletion report, rural electrification, shen-da, transmission, validation. \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \nDirector General \nDirector \n", "Quality Control \nReviewers \n", " \nB.

Mine-mouth coal-fired power generating \nplants are located in the sparsely populated, northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, while the energy-\nconsuming areas are mainly in the industrial south of Liaoning Province. Hence, considerable benefit can be \nrealized by interconnecting the north and the south.  The first part of such interconnection from Heilongjiang \nProvince to Shenyang in Liaoning Province was completed in June 2001 under an Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  loan.  This  Project  was  designed  to  complete  the  interconnection  by  extending  the  transmission  line \nfurther  south  thereby  increasing  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  electricity  transmission  from  Shenyang  to \nDalian  in  Liaoning  Province,  thereby  increasing  the  availability  and  reliability  of  electricity  supply  in  the \nprovince  through  putting  in  place  an  integrated  regional  grid  that  facilitates  establishment  of  a  regional \ncompetitive power market as envisage by the Government. \n \n b. Objectives or Expected Outcomes: \n  \nThe  principle  objective  of  the  Project  was  to  increase  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  electricity  transmission \nfrom  the  northeastern  part  of  the  PRC  to  the  southern  part  of  Liaoning  Province,  thereby  increasing  the \navailability  of  electricity  and  the  reliability  of  electricity  transmission  and  distribution  systems  in  Liaoning \nProvince  and  avoiding  harmful  emissions  associated  with  new  power  generation  in  the  densely  populated \nsouthern part of Liaoning Province. Other objectives were to complete the upgrading and expansion of rural \nelectrification in the relatively poor rural areas of Liaoning Province and to develop an integrated regional grid \nthat will enable restructuring of the power sector in Liaoning Province.  \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n"]}
