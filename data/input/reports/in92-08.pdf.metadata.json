Rationale and Expected Impacts: \n \nThe northeast power region of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) comprises the provinces of Jilin, \nHeilongjiang, Liaoning and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Mine-mouth coal-fired power generating \nplants are located in the sparsely populated, northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, while the energy-\nconsuming areas are mainly in the industrial south of Liaoning Province. Hence, considerable benefit can be \nrealized by interconnecting the north and the south.  The first part of such interconnection from Heilongjiang \nProvince to Shenyang in Liaoning Province was completed in June 2001 under an Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) loan. This Project was designed to complete the interconnection by extending the transmission line \nfurther south thereby increasing the capacity and efficiency of electricity transmission from Shenyang to \nDalian in Liaoning Province, thereby increasing the availability and reliability of electricity supply in the \nprovince through putting in place an integrated regional grid that facilitates establishment of a regional \ncompetitive power market as envisage by the Government. \n \n b. Objectives or Expected Outcomes: \n  \nThe principle objective of the Project was to increase the capacity and efficiency of electricity transmission \nfrom the northeastern part of the PRC to the southern part of Liaoning Province, thereby increasing the \navailability of electricity and the reliability of electricity transmission and distribution systems in Liaoning \nProvince and avoiding harmful emissions associated with new power generation in the densely populated \nsouthern part of Liaoning Province. Other objectives were to complete the upgrading and expansion of rural \nelectrification in the relatively poor rural areas of Liaoning Province and to develop an integrated regional grid \nthat will enable restructuring of the power sector in Liaoning Province.  \n \n \n \n ", "2   \n c. Outputs: \n \nAt appraisal, the specific outputs were expected to be: \n(i)  electricity transmission \n \n(a)  construction of a single-circuit, 500 kV transmission line of 502 km from Shenyang to Dalian.  \n(b)  extension of four 500 kV substations at Shaling, Xujia, Wangshi, and Nanguanling and construction    of a 500 \nkV substation at Shendong \n(c)  installation of communication systems and environmental monitoring equipment \n \n(ii)  electricity transmission expansion and upgrading \n(a)  upgrading and expansion of the Shenyang electricity network, including the upgrading of 220kV substations at \nTaiyuan and Suncheng \n(b)  upgrading and expansion of the Dalian electricity network \n(c)  upgrading and expansion of the Nanguanlin-Yanshu electricity network, including the construction of a 220kV \nsusbstation at Yanshui \n \n(iii)  rural electrification upgrading and expansion in the poverty counties of Kangpin, Xiuyan, and Xinbin and the \npoverty city of Zhuanghe \n(a)  construction of 66 kV transmission lines \n(b)  installation of 66 kV transformers and rehabilitation of existing 66 kV transformers \n(c)  upgrading of 10 kV distribution lines \n(d)  upgrading and replacement of low voltage transformers and installation of new capacitors \n(e)  training of staff in rural electricity supply companies in operation and maintenance of low voltage networks \n(f)  provision of energy efficient lighting \n \n(iv)  upgrading of urban distribution in Shenyang and Dalian \n(v)  competitive power market development - (a)  study on transmission and distribution tariff distribution, restructuring \nof LEPC, and network management improvement; and  (b)  domestic training of Liaoning Electric Power Company \n(LEPC) staff \n(vi)  consulting services for project implementation \n(vii)  international training of LEPC staff in management of a power grid company in a competitive market \n(viii)  closure of 10 coal-fired power generation units (with a total capacity of 437 MW) in Liaoning Province. \n \n \n3. Evaluation of Design and Implementation (Evaluator assessment of actual vs. envisioned) \n  \n a.  Relevance of design and formulation: \n  \nThe design and formulation of the project was rated as relevant. It was in line with the Government\u2019s main \nobjective of increasing the supply of power to support the country\u2019s economic growth. Providing support to \nachieve economic growth in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner was the central theme of ADB\u2019s \noperational strategy for the PRC. More specifically, ADB focused on three strategic objectives: (i) efficiency \nimprovements, (ii) environmental protection, and (iii) growth promotion in less developed provinces. Finally, \nthe project was a logical extension of ADB\u2019s support to strengthen the provincial and regional transmission \nnetwork to optimize utilization of existing power sources in the northeast power grid.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  3\n  \nb.

This was mainly attributed to very \ncompetitive bidding and design refinements during detailed design. The appraisal estimate was based on \npreliminary designs and costs. Major differences in the cost of individual items included (appraisal versus \nactual) several items but most notably the Dalian Electricity Network which increased by over 5 times. No \nexplanation is given for this in the PCR. Land acquisition also cost about 1.7 times the appraisal estimate. \nSome cost items were considerably below appraisal estimates but these were small items including \ncontingencies, which were not needed. Domestic training costs were apparently absorbed by LEPC and not \nquantified. The only significant, although small financially,  deviation was not meeting a poverty reduction \ncomponent involving the provision of 100,000 compact florescent light bulbs to the poorest households in \nthree poverty counties and one poverty city. \n \n \n \n ", "4   \n \n c. Project Cost, Disbursements, Borrower Contribution, and Conformance to Schedule (as relevant to \nproject performance): \n \nProject costs were generally within estimates. There were no delays in the provision of counterpart funds. \nFollowing the delayed effectiveness of the loan, the disbursement was revised. Initial disbursements were \nslow but caught up in the last three years of implementation. Adjusting for the 10 month delay in loan \neffectiveness,  the  implementation  schedule  was  generally  followed  except  for  part  of  the  Rural \nElectrification Upgrading, which delayed project completion by about four months. \n \n d. Implementation Arrangements, Conditions and Covenants, and related Technical Assistance:  \n  \nLEPC was the executing agency and remained as such following a major restructuring of the power sector \nby the Government. The restructuring did not affect project implementation except for the rural component \ninvolving the installation of 100,000 energy efficient florescent light bulbs in poverty areas, which was not \nundertaken. \n \nThe loan covenants were designed to cover sector reforms, tariff and enterprise reforms and governance, \nenvironmental and social impact, financial performance of the EA, and implementation issues. The loan \ncovenants were generally complied with. The covenant involving tariff reform was not fully met as it is a \nsector issue but progress was made on tariff unification. The PCR stated that \u201c\u2026significant progress has \nbeen achieved in the PRC\u2026\u201d in this regard. The covenants on environment and social impacts were \ncomplied with. Concerning the financial covenants, LEPC\u2019s return on assets was low compared with \nappraisal estimates, mainly because it lost many of its better-performing generating assets. Appraisal \nestimates of transmission tariffs were high resulting in a lower return on assets. \n \nThe related TA was provided to help LEPC prepare the project to meet ADB requirements, particularly in \nthe areas of environmental impact assessment, resettlement, procurement, project implementation, and \neconomic and financial analyses. \n \n  e. Performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency: \n \nThe performance of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), representing the Government as the borrower, was \nconsidered satisfactory. MOF helped to facilitate completion of the requirements for the loan to become \neffective. Loan effectiveness was delayed by 10 months and coincided with submission of the first loan \nwithdrawal application.  This simply represents good fiscal management on the part of MOF and suggests \nthat  loan  approval  dates  should  be  more  realistic  especially  given  approval  of  advance  action  and \nretroactive financing, which does not place any pressure on ministries of finance. \n \nLEPC as the executing agency was considered to have performed in a generally satisfactory manner. The \nproject was implemented within budget and within the schedule except for some works and completion of a \nrevised rural poverty component, issues beyond the control of LEPC.  \n \n  f.  Performance of the Asian Development Bank: \n \nADB\u2019s performance in monitoring the project was considered generally satisfactory. Most issues were \nresolved quickly and loan savings cancelled in a timely manner. Two issues arose concerning ADB\u2019s \nrequirements. One involved the standard of insulation to be used. ADB rightly insisted on international \nstandards to ensure that the international bidding would be competitive. The other involved the installation \nof 100,000 efficient light bulbs in poor households. With sector reform, LEPC had been turned into a \ntransmission company with its distribution mandate assigned to another company. Thus, LEPC considered \nthat it could not distribute and install light bulbs. LEPC suggested an alternative subcomponent too help the \npoor, which was accepted by ADB. This alternative involved: (i) road construction and upgrading, (ii) \nrenovation  and  upgrading  of  school  buildings  and  facilities,  (iii)  construction  of  a  bridge,  and  (iv) \nconstruction of school boarding facilities. If installing light bulbs is outside the mandate of LEPC, then it is \ndifficult to understand how building roads, bridges, and school facilities are within its mandate. This is not \nexplained in the PCR. ", "  5\n \n4. Evaluation of Performance (Evaluator assessment): \n \n a. Relevance \n     The project was \u201chighly relevant\u201d. See 3. a. above. \n \n b. Effectiveness in Achieving Outcome \nThe project was \u201ceffective\u201d.  \n \n c. Efficiency in Achieving Outcome and Outputs \nThe project was \u201chighly efficient\u201d and is reportedly running at or near capacity. \n \n d. Preliminary Assessment of Sustainability \nSustainability is \u201clikely\u201d. The transmission tariffs have been set to allow for maintenance, operations and \ndebt payment. The financial assessment at appraisal uses a depreciation rate of 4.36 percent while the \nPCR uses a depreciation rate of 6.0 percent. The effect of this cannot be evaluated as the presentation \nin the appendix of the PCR is a summary. This change was not explained in the PCR; its possible \neffects on sustainability need to be evaluated. The depreciation rates used appear to be on higher side \n\u2013 (i) Transmission has a 50 year span, hence 2% is appropriate. Larger Transformers would be around \n25 years, for which a higher rate say 4%. The sustainability analysis should have examined the \ncompany finances to determine long term viability.   \n \n e. Impact (both intended and unintended) \nNo serious unintended impacts were identified. The intended impact of the installation of 100,000 \nenergy efficient light bulbs and accompanying savings to poor families was not realized. No evaluation \nwas undertaken of the impacts of the substitute works for the rural poor were assessed. \n \n \n5. Overall Assessment, Lessons, and Recommendations (Evaluator assessment): \n \n a. Overall Assessment \nOverall the project was successful. It was completed within LEPC\u2019s budget and reasonably close to the \noriginal schedule taking into account the delay in making the loan effective. The only component that was not \nundertaken was the installation of 100,000 light bulbs but this was replaced with works designed to improve \nthe conditions of the rural poor in selected locations.  \n \n b. Lessons \n(i)  Responsible ministries of finance are not going to meet the requirements of loan effectiveness until they \nare ready to utilize the loan. The effect of this needs to be evaluated. \n(ii)  Projects based on preliminary design will experience design and cost changes and, in some cases, \nunintended environmental and social effects. \n(iii) This project was prepared knowing that a major restructuring of the power sector was imminent. The \nscope of the project and related covenants might have been improved if it had been prepared after \nrestructuring had been implemented. \n(iv) Sector policy changes require considerable time especially in large countries where many issues and \npossible positive and negative effects must be evaluated. Adequate time for such issues to be resolved \nshould be allowed. \n \nc. Recommendations \nRecommendations follow the lessons learned above: \n(i)  always evaluate the effect of delayed loan effectiveness on ADB and country considerations and \nproject implementation \n ", "6   \n(ii)  evaluate the effect of basing projects on preliminary design \n(iii) understanding the effects of sector restructuring would help improve project design \n(iv) implementation and disbursement schedules should take past experience into account \n(v)  recognize that significant policy decisions may require considerable time to prepare and implement \n(vi) the financial evaluation assumptions in the PCR should be the same as those used at appraisal. If \nnot, an explanation should be provided. Company finances should be looked in to while assessing \nlong term viability. \n \n \n 6. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization (Evaluator assessment): \nThe design of the project involved mainly civil works and some training. Results are easily confirmed as such projects \ngenerally have very good records. There are no significant issues to be brought out here. \n \n \n 7. Other (Safeguards, including governance and anticorruption; Fiduciary aspects):  \nSafeguards were complied with including environmental and resettlement concerns were handled well. \nFiduciary aspects appear to have been well handled. \n \n8.

The substituted rural components and \ntheir impact on poverty is not explained nor is how these components come under the purview of LEPC. \n ", " \nREGIONAL DEPARTMENT\u2019S RESPONSE TO THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT \nVALIDATION REPORT \n \n \nOn 22 September 2007, Director, OED2 received the following comments from Energy Division \nof East Asia Regional Department. \n \n \nWe have reviewed the Project Completion Report (PCR) Validation report and found it generally \nsatisfactory. We have following clarifications on the comments stated in the PCR Section 9. \nComments on PCR Quality.  \n \n1.  The reason why the PCR used a higher depreciation rate of 6% compared to the 4.36% \nused at appraisal is to align it with the grid company practices established in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Please note that the PCR for the Yunnan Dachaoshan Transmission Line \nProject (L 1644-PRC) circulated in 2005, a comparable transmission line project, also adopted a \n6% depreciation rate. The accelerated depreciation rate adopted in the PCR has resulted in a \nmore conservative financial projection of the project company while not affecting its viability. \n2.  Regarding the change in rural electrification component (100,000 energy efficient fittings \nin poorest households of 4 poverty counties), we have noted the comment made in the PCR. \nDue to limited page numbers a detailed explanation could not be included in the PCR. However, \nplease note that Liaoning Electric Power Company did not implement these alternative projects \non its own, but provided the funds (comparable to the cost of original component) for the \nrelevant county governments' specific priority rural development projects. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080424131323+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "pcv prc 2008\u201309, pcv prc 30386,loan 1901, shen da power transmission, grid rehabilitation project, evaluation validation report, adb \r\n", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080425152056+08'00'", "Title": "Shen-Da Power Transmission and Grid Rehabilitation Project"}}
