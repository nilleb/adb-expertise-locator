RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Challenges and Opportunities \n \n2.  Importance  of  Infrastructure.  Since  its  inception  over  40  years  ago,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has invested extensively in infrastructure. This long-term commitment \nto the sector, through both the bank\u2019s public and private sector departments, results from ADB\u2019s \nconviction regarding the critical importance of infrastructure to economic growth and poverty \nreduction. \n \n3.  Infrastructure Needs in Asia. Across ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs), the \nstate  of  infrastructure  (in  the  roads,  water  and  sanitation,  power,  and  telecommunications \nsectors) is often poor. Appendix 1 provides country- and sector-specific information on the state \nof infrastructure in each DMC; highlights of particular sectors in particular countries include:1\n \n(i)  Roads. The percentage of roads that are paved in countries like Bangladesh \n(23.7% in 2006) and Afghanistan (9.5%) is far below the average even for the \nSouth Asian region (56.9%, which is itself well below other regional averages). In \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, only 11% of the road network is in good condition, with 51% \nin poor or very poor condition.2  \n \n(ii)  Water and Sanitation. ADB DMCs include some of the poorest performers in \nthe world with regard to access to clean water and sanitation. In Indonesia, piped \nwater supply reaches only 39% of urban dwellers, and only 1.5% have access to \nsewage coverage.3 Central Asia generally ranks relatively well with regard to \nwater and sanitation, but even there, some areas face challenges; in 2005 in the \nKyrgyz Republic, only 53% of the urban population had access to sanitation.4  \n \n(iii)  Power.  Electric  power  consumption  per  capita  in  many  countries  is  low \ncompared to regional averages, and DMCs across the region often have minimal \naccess to power (e.g., Bangladesh, where 42% of the population has access to \nelectricity,5 and Indonesia, with a 53% electrification rate6), while others (such as \nAzerbaijan) experience power outages on an ongoing basis. \n \n(iv)  Telecommunications. Telecommunications penetration rates are low in many \nDMCs as well, and the proportion of the population that subscribes to fixed line \nand mobile services in many countries is well below 20%\u2014e.g., 19% in Kyrgyz \n                                                 \n1  Unless otherwise footnoted, the percentages in this paragraph, available in Appendix 1, are from the World Bank \nGroup\u2019s  \u201cPrivate  Sector  at  a  Glance\u201d  data  tables  from  2006,  available  on  the  World  Bank\u2019s  website  at: \nhttp://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:21323532~menuPK:1192714~p\nagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html (March 2009).    \n2  ADB. 2007.

", "2   \nRepublic, 8% in Tajikistan, and 10% in Uzbekistan7\u2014while only 25% of people in \nBangladesh use cellular services.8 The cost of telecommunications services in \nmany DMCs (as measured by the cost to place a call to the United States) is far \nhigher than regional averages, and higher than averages for comparable income \ngroups.  Even  in  Malaysia,  a  regional  leader  in  the  quantity  and  quality  of \ninfrastructure, progress needs to be made to meet the country\u2019s own objectives \nin areas like information and communications technology.  \n  \n4.  Infrastructure Investment Demand.  Worldwide demand for infrastructure investment \nis enormous, with estimates of global infrastructure needs by organizations such as ADB,9 the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation, the World Bank, and the United Nations as high as \n$130 billion\u2013$600 billion annually. Estimates of infrastructure demand in Asia and the Pacific \nalone are exceptionally large, with some estimates ranging as high as $1 trillion over the coming \ndecade.10 Using techniques applied in other regions, in 2007 ADB calculated that the total \ninfrastructure finance requirements for Asia and the Pacific averaged more than $250 billion per \nannum ($125 billion in East Asia, $76 billion in South Asia, $42 billion in Southeast Asia, and \n$12 billion in Central and West Asia).11 Even removing the huge needs of India and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China from the survey totals, well over $50 billion annually is needed for \nthe region\u2019s smaller economies.  \n \n5.  Country-Specific Investment Needs. Several country-specific examples provide a vivid \nillustration of the scale of investment needed to build new and maintain existing infrastructure. \nFor  example,  the  World  Bank  has  stated  that  underperformance  of  Pakistan\u2019s  transport \ninfrastructure costs the economy $5 billion a year, and that the aging and inadequate irrigation \nand water infrastructure deficit alone is estimated at an aggregate of approximately $70 billion.12 \nThe Institute on Research and Information Systems for Developing Countries in India estimated \nin a February 2009 presentation that the infrastructure investment needed annually between \n2008  and  2012  was  $11.6  billion  in  Bangladesh,  and  $13.3  billion  in  Pakistan.13  A  2005 \n                                                 \n7  This data is from the World Bank's 2006 data set. ADB Uzbekistan Resident Mission has noted that, as of 31 \nDecember 2008, there were 12.7 million mobile subscribers and 1.84 million fixed line subscribers in Uzbekistan.   \n8  Central Intelligence Agency. 2009.

Manila: ADB. \nThis study, submitted to ADB\u2019s Board in November 2007, surveys the demand for subnational financing, using \ninfrastructure and utilities as a proxy for the magnitude of financial demand by subnational entities in the region. \nThe survey serves as the source of many of the statistics in these paragraphs. The survey is available at \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Papers/Market-Survey-Subnational-Finance/market-survery.pdf;  the  survey \nreferences the following quantitative infrastructure studies that served as starting points for infrastructure demand \ncalculations ADB DMCs: (i) ADB, JBIC, and World Bank Infrastructure Flagship Study. 2005.

Financial Crisis Global Economic Governance and Development. Available: http://www.ris.org.in/.  \n ", "    3\npresentation by the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs identified the gap \nbetween investment demand and identified sources of supply to be 62% ($90 billion); most of \nthat gap will have to be closed by the private sector.14 Finally, the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific estimates annual average infrastructure investment \nneeds in Central Asia of $46 billion, or 6.9% of GDP, between 2006 and 2010.15  \n \n6.  This gap in infrastructure investment means there is a large stock of infrastructure \nprojects seeking financing, including greenfield projects, upgrades, expansions, refinancings, \nbrownfields, etc.  ADB itself receives much greater deal flow (investment proposals) than it \ncould conceivably finance with available resources. \n \n7.  Infrastructure Finance Supply. The existing supply of infrastructure finance does not \ncome  close  to  meeting  the  scale  of  demand  described  above.  Between  1992  and  2003, \napproximately $280 billion was invested in infrastructure projects in Asia and the Pacific. About \n22% of this came from the private sector, 70% from the public sector, and 8% from official \ndevelopment assistance.16 To put this in perspective, the $280 billion of aggregate infrastructure \ninvestment made over the course of a decade is approximately equal to the projected amount \nneeded in the region per year over the next decade. Aggregate capital flows into ADB DMCs \n(i.e., for infrastructure and all other sectors) increased from $32 billion in 2000 to $160 billion in \n2005, with private sector investors comprising an increasing percentage of that total (footnote \n16). The Institute for International Finance substantiates this recent trend, noting that net private \nsector flows to emerging Asian markets has continued to rise, increasing from $259 billion in \n2006 to $315 billion in 2007.17 Private capital flows are notoriously capricious, however, and \ncontracted sharply in response to the 2008 global financial crisis. The Institute for International \nFinance estimates flows for 2008 at only $96 billion, and projects that they will fall in 2009 to a \nmere  $65  billion. 18   These  figures\u2014which  refer  to  all  investable  sectors,  including \ninfrastructure\u2014are  tiny  compared  to  the  level  of  demand  in  the  region  for  infrastructure \ninvestment alone. Substantial debt and equity are needed on a long-term basis, both to maintain \nexisting infrastructure and to build new capacity, and neither debt nor equity comes close to \nmeeting projected demand. In particular, many countries have great difficulty accessing private \nequity  funding;  these  underserved  countries  include  many  of  the  countries  across  South, \nSoutheast, and Central Asia. Very few funds globally have investment strategies that target \nthese regions.  \n \n8.  Capital in the Islamic World. Great wealth exists in many Middle Eastern countries, \ngenerated in large part from substantial oil revenues, which have greatly increased the fortunes \nof high net-worth individuals and sovereign wealth funds. The Council on Foreign Relations \nestimates that the sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries19 held $1.2 \ntrillion in 2008. This actually represented a decrease of approximately $100 billion from 2007, \nreflecting $300 billion of inflow (driven by average oil prices of $100 a barrel throughout 2008), \noffset by the mark-to-market losses on their equity portfolios.20 The size of these funds may \n                                                 \n14 Infrastructure  Summit.  2005.

Despite this recent volatility, great \nwealth still resides in the region, and investors are increasingly interested in channeling this \ncapital  into  investment  opportunities  that  comply  with  Shari'ah  law  and  values.  Accenture \nestimates that demand for Islamic finance products has grown by up to 15% a year; households \nalone could direct as much as $24 billion of savings per year into Islamic savings products by \n2020. As recently as 2005, however, Shari\u2019ah-compatible traded stocks amounted to only $300 \nbillion, and Islamic mutual funds amounted to only $11 billion.21 In order to attract that money to \nAsian investment opportunities, suitable investment vehicles must exist to tap that capital. \n \n9.  Unlocking the Capital. Institutional investors in many Middle Eastern countries that \nmight otherwise have appetite for investment risk in the Fund\u2019s target countries require Shari\u2019ah-\ncompliant investment opportunities, and are thus precluded from investing in traditional private \nequity funds that are not specifically structured to accommodate that requirement. Indeed, the \nnumber of private equity funds set up to accommodate Shari\u2019ah-compliant investment is limited. \nProject sponsors across ADB DMCs, constrained by the general undersupply of risk capital in \ntheir regions (particularly given recent reversals in capital flows), are eager to tap into the large \npools of wealth that exist in many countries throughout the Middle East, but are unable to \naccess that money in the absence of suitably structured funds that can serve as intermediaries \nbetween investors and project sponsors. To help bridge this gap, ADB will collaborate with IDB \nto establish a Shari\u2019ah-compliant private equity fund (the Islamic Infrastructure Fund, L.P., or the \nFund)  to  invest  in  infrastructure  projects  across  those  member  countries  common  to  both \ninstitutions.  By  structuring  the  Fund  to  accommodate  the  needs  of  investors  for  Shari\u2019ah-\ncompliant investment vehicles, the Fund will \u201cunlock\u201d for project sponsors in the target region a \nlarge pool of money seeking investment opportunities. This will in turn channel more equity \ncapital into infrastructure projects throughout the region, and will also allow project sponsors \nspecifically seeking Islamic funding access to financing tools structured around their particular \nrequirements. \n \nB.  Consistency with ADB Strategies and Approaches \n \n10.  Given the crucial role of infrastructure in economic growth and poverty reduction, ADB \nhas affirmed its commitment to assist in developing infrastructure throughout Asia and the \nPacific in virtually all of its strategic documents, including its long-term strategic framework \n2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020),22 as well as its specific country strategies and programs (CSPs). \nThe project is also aligned with ADB's approach to Islamic finance, and to using private equity \nfunds for specific purposes. \n \n1.  Long-Term Strategic Framework \n \n11.  This initiative is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities, as reflected in Strategy 2020, \nwhich was approved by ADB\u2019s Board in 2008, and which articulates infrastructure as the first of \nfive priority areas for ADB over the next 12 years. Strategy 2020 states that \u201cADB investment in \ninfrastructure  is  fundamental  to  achieving  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth,\u201d23  and \nmentions  specific  areas  of  operational  focus,  including:  transport  and  communication \nconnectivity within and between DMCs; energy supply (including clean energy), and promotion \n                                                 \n21 Accenture. 2007.

In addition to affirming ADB\u2019s commitment to infrastructure, Strategy 2020 provides \nguidance regarding appropriate investment modalities. It affirms the importance of both public \ninvestment  and  an  expanding  role  for  private  capital  and  markets,  noting  that:  \u201cADB\u2019s \ninfrastructure  operations  will  emphasize  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  private  sector \nengagement. ADB will promote a larger role for the private sector in financing infrastructure, \neither as a project sponsor or an institutional bond or equity investor. The latter role carries \ngreat promise for augmenting the supply of capital for infrastructure in developing the region.\u201d24 \nThis project is consistent with the long-term strategic framework because it positions ADB to \nplay a catalytic role in mobilizing, through the Fund, additional private sector resources into \ninfrastructure projects, alongside the commitments made by ADB and IDB.  \n \n2.  Country Strategies and Programs \n \n13.  The CSPs for virtually all ADB DMCs identify infrastructure as a target sector. Some \nexamples from the Fund\u2019s target countries include the following: \n \n(i)  Kazakhstan. 25 Kazakhstan\u2019s  most  recent  CSP  targets  private  sector \ninfrastructure  operations  focused  on  water,  wastewater,  solid  waste,  power, \nairports, toll roads, rail, ports, and oil and gas operations.  \n \n(ii)  Pakistan.  Pakistan\u2019s  CSP  for  2006\u20132008  emphasized  lending  for  economic \ninfrastructure, with a primary focus on water resources, power, transport and \ncommunications, and urban renewal and development, and states that \u201cADB \nviews itself as one of Pakistan\u2019s strategic development partners for infrastructure \ndevelopment.\u201d  26  Regarding  private  sector  operations  in  particular,  the  CSP \nmentions that consideration was being given to supporting investment projects in \nwater, power, and energy infrastructure. \n \n(iii)  Indonesia.  ADB\u2019s  Indonesia  strategy  for  2006\u20132009  (footnote  6)  targeted \nimprovements to infrastructure and infrastructure services, mainly through public \nsector operations, to be delivered primarily through the Infrastructure Reform \nProgram cluster. \n \n(iv)  Kyrgyz Republic.27 The CSP for the Kyrgyz Republic stated that ADB\u2019s Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  financing  would  focus  on  several  sectors,  including  road \ntransport and communications, noting that roads play a particularly crucial role \nfor a landlocked country\u2019s economic growth.  \n \n(v)  Uzbekistan.28 The CSP for Uzbekistan identifies ADB\u2019s focus on transit and \ntransport in the region, with a particular focus on regional transport corridors, \nidentifying technical assistance (TA) for preparing a transport sector strategy, a \n                                                 \n24 Strategy 2020 (footnote 21), p. 18. \n25 ADB. 2005.

This project aligns with several other initiatives undertaken by ADB related to Islamic \nfinance. In 2004, ADB provided TA to the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), which sets \nregulatory standards for Islamic financial institutions. The TA funded technical experts to work \non a number of regulatory concerns, and resulted in new transparency and market discipline \nstandards,  financial  soundness  indicators  for  Islamic  institutions,  and  assessments  of  the \npotential  for  Islamic  asset  securitization.29  ADB  and  IFSB  have  agreed  to  continue  this \ncollaboration under a new TA, approved in March 2009, which aims to follow up on and expand \nupon earlier initiatives.30 The new TA will address development of prudential and supervision \nstandards for Islamic financial markets, and is cofinanced by ADB and IFSB; the IFSB funding is \nbeing provided by IDB. To complement regional initiatives, ADB is also working directly with a \nnumber of financial sector regulators, such as in Indonesia and Pakistan, to develop an enabling \nlegal and regulatory framework for Islamic finance. ADB has thus been involved in several \ninitiatives that have assisted in opening the Asian market to Islamic financing sources. This \nproject will be ADB's first involvement in parallel private sector efforts to develop the market. \n \n4.  Use of a Private Equity Fund \n \n15.  Although substantial direct work in the infrastructure sector is undertaken directly by \nADB through its public and private sector infrastructure divisions, ADB has elected in this case \nto utilize a fund (or indirect investment) structure. The primary reason for creating a fund is that \nADB is seeking to mobilize Islamic financing capital into the underlying transactions (paras. 8\u20139), \nwhich it would be unable to mobilize into its own conventionally structured transactions. A fund \nstructure permits ADB to mobilize Islamic financing capital into suitable projects in the targeted \ncountries. Additionally, the creation of a fund that mobilizes third-party capital (both private \nsector commitments to the Fund and additional Islamic debt used in the Fund's transactions) \ngenerates a multiplier effect beyond what could be achieved through direct ADB interventions.  \n \nC.  Development Impact \n \n1.  Development Impact \n \n16.

Technical Assistance Completion Report Development of International Prudential Standards for Islamic \nFinancial Services. Manila. Specifically, the TA addressed a number of regulatory concerns, including (i) gaps in \nregulatory frameworks; (ii) lack of comparability of Islamic financial products across borders; (iii) the risk of \nregulatory arbitrage; (iv) lack of a level playing field with conventional financial products; and (v) the absence of \nreliable data on Islamic financial institutions and countries\u2014or among banks within a country\u2014due to differences in \naccounting standards and weak accounting and auditing environments. The TA funded technical experts who \nprovided assistance to the IFSB to (i) develop a new transparency and market discipline standard to more \neffectively address the unique mix of risks that arise from the contractual design of instruments based on Shari\u2019ah \nprinciples, which was subsequently adopted after widespread consultation with IFSB members; (ii) develop a \ncompilation guide for an Islamic financial database modeled on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s financial \nsoundness indicators, which was approved by the IFSB in March 2007 and issued as an IFSB guide; and (iii) \nconduct a cross-country assessment of the legal framework for Islamic asset securitization as a first step in \ndeveloping an appropriate legal framework. The assessment was presented at the 2007 IFSB annual meeting.  \n30 ADB. 2009. Technical assistance on Development of Prudential and Supervision Standards for Islamic Financial \nMarkets.

In this transaction, ADB's establishment of and investment in this \ninfrastructure fund is ultimately intended to help increase the set of economic opportunities \navailable to the inhabitants of the Fund's targeted DMCs. This set of linkages, as detailed in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (DMF, see Appendix 2), can be understood as follows: \n \n(i)  Output.  The  output  of  the  project  will  be  that  this  Fund  is  established  as \nanticipated in this proposal; that it identifies, screens, and evaluates investment \nopportunities; makes investments; and divests from those projects over time.  \n \n(ii)  Outcome. The outcome of the project is an expanded and improved stock of \nbasic infrastructure in the Fund's targeted DMCs.  \n \n(iii)  Impact. Long-term, it is anticipated that accelerated infrastructure development \nwill increase access to economic opportunities for the inhabitants of the Fund's \ntargeted DMCs. \n \n17.  The logic of the DMF implies that infrastructure investment results in economic growth \nand  poverty  reduction  through  an  expansion  of  economic  opportunities.  This  logic  can  be \nsummarized as follows:  \n \n18.  Infrastructure and Growth. Infrastructure investment contributes to economic growth in \na number of ways. Most fundamentally, infrastructure services, such as transport, water, and \nelectricity, are intermediate inputs to production, and any reduction in these input costs raises \nthe profitability of production, thus allowing higher levels of output, income, and/or employment. \nInfrastructure services also increase labor productivity by (i) reducing workers' commuting time, \ntravel costs, and travel stress (via improvements to roads and bridges); (ii) increasing output \nand  efficiency  via  introduction  of  electricity;  (iii)  increasing  agricultural  productivity  through \ninvestment in irrigation facilities; (iv) improving information flows through telecommunications; \nand  (v)  creating  economies  of  scale  and  scope.  The  links  between  improvements  in \ninfrastructure and economic growth are numerous and apparent. \n \n19.  Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction. Economic growth has the effect of raising \nthe incomes of all members of society, including the poor, thereby reducing poverty. Richard \nAdams,  of  the  World  Bank's  Poverty  Reduction  Group,  summarizes  this  by  stating  that \n\u201c[e]conomic growth reduces poverty in\u2026developing countries\u2026because average incomes of the \npoor tend to rise proportionately with those of the rest of the population.\u201d31 The relationship \nbetween  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  has  been  consistently  substantiated  by \nempirical evidence.  \n \n20.  Infrastructure and Poverty Reduction. In addition to the indirect link described above \nthat ties infrastructure to economic growth, and thereby to poverty reduction, infrastructure \ninvestment is also more directly linked to poverty reduction: (i) electricity and gas allow poor \npeople to heat their homes and cook their food more efficiently, and use electrical appliances to \ngenerate self-employment income; (ii) roads and urban mass transit allow people access to \nemployment and markets, as well as to health and education services; and (iii) clean water and \nsanitation lead to improved health outcomes. These are only a few of the ways in which \ninfrastructure investment has the potential to result in improved socioeconomic conditions for \nthe poor.  \n                                                 \n31 Adams, Richard H., Jr.. 2003. Economic Growth, Inequality, and Poverty: Findings from a New Data Set. \nWashington, DC: The World Bank. \n ", "8   \n \n21.  Further Developmental Impact. Finally, although the DMF captures only the core logic \nof  this  project  related  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  there  are  a  number  of \nadditional indirect development outcomes anticipated from the transaction. These include: (i) an \nincreased use of private equity funding in ADB DMCs, 32 and (ii) mobilization of capital from the \nMiddle East into the rest of Asia.33 Indeed, a key developmental aspect of this transaction is that \nADB's  participation  in  the  Fund  will  help  widen  access  to  finance  for  groups  that  would \notherwise  be  unable  to  utilize  Shari'ah-compliant  financing  for  infrastructure  projects,  by \nleveraging new sources of financing into the region. Additionally, ADB's participation and policy \nrequirements will assist in the development of international best practices for Shari'ah-compliant \nfunds.  \n \n2.  Value Added by ADB \n \n22.  General.  ADB  will  add  value  to  the  Fund  in  a  number  of  ways.  ADB\u2019s  principal \nadditionality comes in the form of sponsoring and establishing the Fund from the outset; without \nADB\u2019s support, the Fund would not exist. Through its investment, ADB will demonstrate its \nconfidence in the transaction, which may by example encourage further investment by other \ndevelopment institutions and institutional investors. ADB will assist in deal sourcing on an \nongoing basis, and its seat on the Fund\u2019s investment committee will allow ADB to comment and \nvote on each transaction contemplated by the Fund.  \n \n23.  Environmental and Social Safeguards. Environmental and social safeguard (ESS) \nissues are of great importance to ADB, and are an active focus for ADB's private equity funds \nportfolio. The Fund Manager has been an active partner in ADB's efforts to ensure the Fund \ncomplies with ADB\u2019s ESS requirements. Activities in this regard have included: (i) providing the \nFund Manager with, and incorporating their feedback on, ADB's ESS management system \nframework; (ii) providing the Fund Manager with guidelines for annual reporting on ESS issues; \n(iii) fielding a mission to Kuala Lumpur to deliver a one-day training on ADB\u2019s ESS policies, and \non the Fund's responsibilities in complying with those policies; (iv) developing a flow chart \ndelineating the responsibilities of the Fund Manager, the portfolio companies, and ADB in \ncomplying with the relevant policies; and (v) providing samples of standard documents used in \nvarious parts of the process. The Fund Manager will ensure that the Fund's investments comply \nwith ADB's ESS policies. ADB will monitor the Fund Manager\u2019s compliance with ADB policies \nthroughout the life of the Fund.  \n                                                 \n32 The Fund will provide financing specifically in the form of private equity, which confers benefits (such as expertise, \nadvice, mentoring, and strategic inputs) beyond those that accrue to other forms of financing (e.g., debt and public \nequity). In Private Equity Impact 2008, Venture Intelligence summarizes the comments of private equity-funded \ninfrastructure companies regarding the particular advantages of private equity. Those managers stated that private \nequity firms add value in a number of key areas, including: (i) expertise in valuing infrastructure projects, (ii) advice \nin  fine-tuning  business  models,  (iii)  improvements  in  operational  efficiency,  (iv)  strengthening  of  corporate \ngovernance, (v) mentoring for management teams, (vi) assistance in accessing follow-on financing, (vii) expertise \nin tapping public markets, (viii) strategic inputs to identify new opportunities, and (ix) working with regulators and \nthe government to speed up clearances. Venture Intelligence. 2008. Private Equity Impact 2008. Chennai. \n33 By structuring this Fund to accommodate the needs of investors for Islamic investment vehicles, and by soliciting \ninvestment from third-party investors, the Fund will help mobilize Middle Eastern capital into productive investment \nopportunities in ADB\u2019s DMCs, thus \u201cunlocking\u201d for Asian project sponsors a large pool of new capital. As described \nabove, there are large pools of untapped wealth across the Middle East in search of appropriate investment \nopportunities, with sovereign wealth funds controlling trillions of dollars (much of it in Islamic countries), and oil \nrevenues across the Arab states amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Investors in these countries \nare increasingly interested in investing in Shari\u2019ah-compliant projects. Asian project sponsors are eager to tap into \nthese large pools of wealth, but are unable to access this capital in the absence of suitably structured Shari\u2019ah-\ncompliant private equity funds that can serve as intermediaries between investors and sponsors. \n ", "    9\n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n \nA.  Overview \n \n24.  Strategy and Objective. The Fund will make strategic, Shari\u2019ah-compliant investments \nin infrastructure projects in countries that have membership in both ADB and IDB, namely: \nAfghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  Bangladesh,  Indonesia,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Malaysia, \nMaldives, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, and such other countries that \nmay become common member countries of ADB and IDB in the future. The Fund\u2019s sector focus \nwill comprise transport; telecommunications; energy; and water supply, sanitation, and waste \nmanagement.  \n \n25.  Size. The Fund will have a first closing of $260 million, including an investment of up to \n$100 million from ADB, and a $150 million investment from IDB.  \n \n26.  Anchor  Investors.  As anchor  investors, ADB and IDB have taken the lead in the \nstructuring and documentation of the Fund, and will contribute to the operations and governance \nof the Fund in a number of ways. IDB, headquartered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, is a multilateral \nfinancial institution that started operations in 1975, and is owned by its 56 member countries. \nThe IDB\u2019s objective is to foster the economic development and social progress of member \ncountries and Muslim communities, in accordance with the principles of Shari\u2019ah, or Islamic law. \nThe functions of the IDB are to participate in equity capital and provide loans for productive \nprojects and enterprises, and to provide other forms of financial assistance to member countries \nfor the purpose of economic and social development.   \n \nB.  Fund Manager \n \n27.  CIMB  Standard  (the  Fund  Manager).  CIMB  Standard  Islamic  Infrastructure  Fund \n(General Partner) Limited (the General Partner) is a joint venture established by CIMB Group \nand Standard Bank, which will act as the general partner of the Fund. The Fund Manager was \nselected for this project due to several key competitive advantages. It is one of the only fund \nmanagement teams in Southeast Asia specifically focused on infrastructure, and is currently \nmanaging The South East Asian Strategic Assets Fund L.P. (SEASAF), a private equity fund \nfocusing  on  provision  of  growth  and  expansion  capital  to  energy,  infrastructure,  natural \nresources, and associated industries in Southeast Asia. The team has in-depth expertise in core \ninfrastructure, as well as significant financial engineering expertise in investment structuring. \nCIMB Standard is also well positioned for deal sourcing; deal referrals from CIMB Group and \nStandard Bank (as well as the parent institutions\u2019 strong presence in the geographic areas \ntargeted by the Fund) are anticipated to grant the Fund Manager privileged access to deal flow. \nFinally,  due  to  the  Islamic  finance  capabilities  of  its  parent  institutions,  the  Fund  is  well \nestablished to source and execute Shari'ah-compliant transactions. \n \n28.  CIMB Group. CIMB Group is one of Southeast Asia\u2019s leading universal banking groups, \nand the second-largest financial services provider in Malaysia, with over 36,000 employees in \nnine countries. As of year-end 2008, it had total assets of over $55 billion, market capitalization \nof over $6 billion, and revenues of over $2 billion. CIMB Group offers a full suite of services in \nbanking,  capital  markets,  and  asset  and  fund  management.  It  has  financed  the  largest \ninfrastructure  projects  in  both  Malaysia  and  Indonesia,  and  has  received  multiple  awards, \nincluding \u201cBank of the Year,\u201d \u201cBest Investment Bank,\u201d and \u201cBest Equity House,\u201d among others, \nin 2007 and/or 2008. CIMB Group\u2019s high profile gives its various businesses access to key \n ", "10  \ndealmakers, and facilitates cross-border deals due to the depth of its relationships. Within its \ncorporate  umbrella,  CIMB  Group  owns  CIMB  Islamic,  a  leading  Islamic  bank  which  has \npioneered the development and provision of a complete suite of Shari\u2019ah-compliant services. \nCIMB Islamic has won international recognition for its role in many groundbreaking Islamic \ntransactions, and has structured dozens of Shari\u2019ah-compliant funds. CIMB Group has over $5 \nbillion in assets under management (20% of which is Shari\u2019ah-compliant), comprising about \n$4.5 billion in publicly traded funds and $0.5 billion in private equity.34 (See Appendix 3 for more \ndetails on CIMB Group.) \n \n29.  Standard Bank. Standard Bank is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and has \na global presence in 38 countries across Africa, Asia, the Americas, Central and Eastern \nEurope, and the Middle East, with over 48,000 employees worldwide. It had assets of over $174 \nbillion as at 30 June 2008, and a market capitalization of over $7 billion as at 20 February 2009, \nplacing Standard Bank in the top sixty global banks by market capitalization. It has consistently \nachieved headline earnings growth and return on equity in excess of 20% for 20 years.35 It is an \nestablished emerging markets bank providing a full spectrum of financial services, including \nbanking, advisory, capital markets, and investment and asset management services. Standard \nBank was the winner of the \u201cEmerging Markets Bank of the Year\u201d in The Banker Awards in 2007, \nand The Banker\u2019s \u201cBank of the Year\u201d award in multiple African countries in both 2007 and 2008 \n(as well winning other awards in other years). The bank has broad and deep infrastructure \nexperience in power, concessions, telecommunications, and export finance. Since 2003, it has \ntransacted over a hundred deals worth in excess of $40 billion in 32 countries, and is the lead \nAfrican project finance franchise, with rapid expansion into other emerging markets, including \nCentral Asia. Standard Bank, which focuses its fund management on emerging markets and the \ninfrastructure sector, has over $2 billion in funds invested and under management, which it \nplans to grow to $5 billion in the medium term.36 (See Appendix 3 for more details on Standard \nBank.) \n \nC.  Governance Structure \n \n30.  Fund Manager. The Fund Manager will: (i) provide general business advice, including \nidentification of, and recommendations concerning, investments and potential investments; (ii) \nsupervise the preparation of and review all documents required to complete each investment; (iii) \nmonitor the performance of each portfolio company; (iv) provide advice and recommendations \nconcerning the disposition of investments; (v) provide strategic and financial planning; and (vi) \nother activities as appropriate. The Fund will have an investment committee, an advisory board, \nand a Shari'ah supervisory board. \n \n                                                 \n34 CIMB Group's previous experience with funds includes management of CIMB Mezzanine Fund, CIMB Private \nEquity Fund I, CIMB-Mapletree Real Estate Fund I, CAV Growth Buyout Fund, Commerce Technology Ventures \nFund, Commerce Agro Ventures Fund, Commerce Khazanah Agro Teroka, Commerce-KPF, and C-Bat / I-BAT \nFund. These funds focus or focused on Malaysia and Association of Southeast Asian Nations member countries, \nand in various sectors, including growth capital, buyout, pre-IPO, real estate, and small and medium enterprises. \nCIMB Group thus has institutional commitment to the private equity business. Since these funds were not managed \nby the Fund Manager of this Fund, their full track records have not been presented in this RRP. \n35 Normalized for adjustments, unaudited.  \n36 Standard Bank's previous experience with funds includes management of Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund, \nGuarantCo, Gulf Cooperation Countries Energy Fund, SU Turkish Private Equity Opportunities Fund, Standard \nAfrica Development Fund, and Standard Bank SA proprietary investments. These funds focus or focused on Africa, \nthe Gulf Cooperation Countries, and other emerging markets, and in various products and sectors, including debt \nand mezzanine, guarantees, private equity, and energy and energy-related businesses. Since these funds were not \nmanaged by the Fund Manager of this Fund, their full track records have not been presented in this RRP. \n ", "    11\nIV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s investment in the Fund is classified as category FI (financial intermediary) under \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), as category C under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995),  and  as  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  The  Fund \nManager will be required to adopt an environmental and social management system, and will \nensure that all investments comply with ADB social safeguards policies, and that all necessary \nassessments  have  been  made  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures  have  been  taken.  In \naddition, the Fund will not invest in activities set out in ADB\u2019s list of prohibited investment \nactivities.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption, and Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism \n \n32.  The Fund Manager was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  and  the  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB will require the Fund Manager to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant \nwith ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The investment documentation between \nADB and the Fund will allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n33.  Following the approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s Board, ADB will enter into \nsuitable investment documentation, and ensure that such documentation and other principal \nagreements  relating  to  the  Fund  will  be  on  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB  and \nincorporate all relevant ADB policies. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to $100,000,000 in the Islamic Infrastructure Fund, L.P., from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, on terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board; and  \n             \n             \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n \n \n \nx April 2009\n ", " \n1 \n2\n
