I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $140 million to Le Gaga Holdings Limited (Le Gaga), comprising (i) a direct loan of up to \n$80 million and (ii) a B-loan of up to $60 million equivalent in US dollars and/or euros to be \nfunded by participating commercial banks, for the Greenhouse Agricultural Development Project \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  In a recent study, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) reconfirmed that food security is \nessential for poverty reduction. The study highlighted the adverse impact of rising food prices on \npoverty, and the attendant negative effects of food price volatility on population and health. 2 \nADB\u2019s support in agriculture will help create and expand economic opportunities and promote \nbroader  access  to  these  opportunities  to  support  inclusive  economic  growth  and  reduce \nvulnerability and inequality.3 \n \n3.  Responding  to  the  decision  to  expand  operations  in  agricultural  businesses,  ADB \nidentified Le Gaga, a greenhouse vegetable producer in the PRC, as having a proven business \nmodel and proprietary technology to (i) increase the productivity of agriculture, (ii) promote food \nsafety and quality standards, and (iii) improve the resilience of agriculture to the impacts of \ndisasters and climate change, all of which are ADB aims according to its Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020.3 \n \n4.  The project is consistent with a key goal of the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u2013\n2015), i.e., to boost the agriculture sector and farmers\u2019 benefits.4 The plan calls for (i) speeding \nup the development of modern agriculture, (ii) increasing farmers\u2019 income, (iii) improving the \nliving  and  production  conditions  in  rural  areas,  and  (iv)  improving  rural  development \nmechanisms and institutions. The project is selected for its satisfactory fit with ADB\u2019s strategic, \ncountry, and sector approaches to poverty reduction. The project represents the first private \nsector opportunity for ADB to provide direct assistance to the farming industry in the PRC. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n5.  The project will support Le Gaga in establishing and expanding a series of modern \ngreenhouse operations in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, which have optimal weather and \nadequate infrastructure for vegetable production, particularly for providing (mainly in winter)  \noff-season vegetables to the entire PRC and some neighboring countries. All the greenhouses \nare built on leased farmland and operated by PRC companies owned and controlled 100% by \nLe Gaga. \n \n6.  Le Gaga maximizes its greenhouse operations by (i) customizing them to mitigate local \nweather risk and disease pressure; (ii) building structures that are more efficiently laid out, taller, \nand connected to create a uniform growing environment; (iii) adopting temperature and airflow \ncontrol,  and  (iv)  using advanced  drip  irrigation  systems.  Le Gaga  is also  accelerating  the \n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2013.

", "2  \nconversion  to  soilless  greenhouse  production,  which  has  been  proved  to  further  increase \nproductivity, enhance efficiency, and improve quality. \n \n7.  The project is designed to be a least-cost solution to financing agricultural development, \nwhich on a stand-alone site-specific basis could involve relatively high transaction costs. ADB \nand Le Gaga aim to expand the operations under a portfolio approach (financing multiple  \nsub-projects with common natures under one facility) to reduce transaction costs and diversify \nthe risk of adverse natural conditions. The portfolio approach, which is broader in reach, will \nenable  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  increase  efficiency  in  geographic  coverage  and  impact \ndissemination. \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsor \n \n8.  The project sponsor and borrower, Le Gaga Holdings Limited, is a holding company \nincorporated in Cayman Islands. Its subsidiaries operate as greenhouse vegetable producers in \nthe PRC. Since its initial public offering in October 2010, Le Gaga has been publicly listed on \nthe NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ). \n \n9.  Le Gaga specializes in modern greenhouse farming (as opposed to traditional open-field \nfarming)  with  multi-arched,  steel-framed  structures  that  have  retractable  walls  and  head \nwindows and use only natural sunlight and natural ventilation to create a favorable microclimate \nconducive to off-season vegetable production. To cultivate the farms, Le Gaga hires farmers, \nmostly  women,  and  both  local  and  migrant  workers.  Le  Gaga  grows  mainly  solanaceous \nvegetables  during  off-seasons,  which  command  higher  selling  prices,  but  complements  its \nproduct mix with leafy and cruciferous vegetables.5 \n \n10.  Le Gaga\u2019s competitive edge lies in its unique greenhouse-based production process. \nSince its inception in 2004, it has developed a comprehensive database in planning each stage \nfrom seed selection to crop production to harvesting, including information on weather patterns \nand  historical  vegetable  price  movements  in  various  regions.  Through  research, \nexperimentation, and experience, Le Gaga\u2019s farming technology has evolved to (i) customizing \nits greenhouse structure and layout; and (ii) using a soilless production system that promotes \nresource conservation and efficiency and improves product yield and quality. \n \n11.  The vegetables of Le Gaga are sold mainly to wholesalers in the PRC for distribution \nacross the country, including urban cities with increasingly high demand for quality produce. \nSome of the wholesalers export the produce to neighboring countries such as Japan and the \nRepublic of Korea. By selling primarily to these market segments, Le Gaga is able to focus on \nits core business of growing high-quality off-season vegetables. Le Gaga is able to capitalize on \nits greenhouse technology, market positioning, and superior quality, which allows it to take full \nadvantage of seasonal pricing differences and avoid selling into a highly commoditized market. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n1.  Impacts \n \n12.  The development impact of the project will be the increased availability of quality, fresh, \nand  nutritious  food  all  year around,  which  helps  increase the  awareness  about and satisfy \nthe  demand for high-quality and safe food products in the PRC. The project is essential in \n                                                      \n5  Solanaceous vegetables include tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, pumpkins, and cucumbers. Leafy vegetables include bok \nchoy, shanghai greens, and choi sum. Cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, Chinese cabbage, and lettuce.  ", "  3\ndeveloping an efficient and sustainable venue for the upstream agricultural value chain, which \nhelps the country realize the economic, social, and ecological benefits of sector modernization \nand seek the full potential of agriculture for inclusive and sustainable growth. \n \n13.  Agricultural development in the PRC is still in transition to modernization, and food \nsecurity, food safety, and efficient supply of primary products are yet to be fully achieved. The \nrapid growth of the national economy, an accelerated level of urbanization, and continued  \nimprovement of people\u2019s living standards mean that awareness of health, nutrition, and food \nsafety issues as well as demand for quality vegetables are also steadily rising. Greenhouse \nfarming is acknowledged as an effective solution to these issues. As a critical source of quality \nsupply,  which  stably  supplements  traditional  farming,  it  can  better  serve  the  national  and \nneighboring markets by helping alleviate the demand\u2013supply gap and price volatility of key \nnutritious produce all year around. \n \n14.  The  project  is  expected  to  serve  as  a  catalyst for  private  sector  development  and \nparticipation,  which  is  still  limited  to  upstream  productivity  enhancement  in  the  agriculture \nsector. As outlined in Le Gaga\u2019s growth plan, increased agricultural involvement of the private \nsector will lead to the expansion of related industries such as food processing and distribution. \nThe project\u2019s forward and backward links between agriculture and non-agriculture industries will \ncatalyze  broader  economic  transition  by  stimulating  growth  in  the  secondary  and  tertiary \nsectors, which are the primary domain of the private sector. Growth outside agriculture also \nhelps stimulate the agriculture sector, particularly through the reverse-link effects of urbanization \non demand for high-value agricultural products, which is the project\u2019s focus. \n \n15.  Increasing scarcity of water and arable land and weather volatility threaten the PRC\u2019s \nefforts to meet its objectives for food security and safety, rural livelihoods, and natural resource \nmanagement. The project\u2019s modern agricultural production helps the country achieve these \nobjectives  because  it  supports  high  yields  of  quality  produce,  resource  conservation,  and \nenvironmental protection at the same time. \n \n16.  Vegetable farming still is a fragmented industry, and modern greenhouse know-how is \nnot widely available to most producers in the PRC. Le Gaga achieves the highest greenhouse \ncoverage ratio in the industry and is leading its peers through its effective combination of \nintensive research and development, comprehensive market intelligence, advanced horticultural \ntechnologies, cost control, and marketing and distribution networks to build its brand. Le Gaga\u2019s \nexpanded greenhouse operations will strongly demonstrate a proven approach, which Le Gaga \nwill keep upgrading. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n17.  The  project\u2019s  expected  outcome  is  demonstrated  viability  and  productivity  gains  in \ngreenhouse farming. By accelerating agriculture modernization through industrialized production \nmanagement, the project will contribute to the transformation to and growth of competitive and \ndynamic greenhouse farming that achieves higher productivity and integration of industry and \nmarkets, increases farm and nonfarm employment, and improves rural livelihoods of farmers \nand  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  the  aged.  On-farm  employment  is  critically \nimportant to the rural farmers as well as the landless and vulnerable people, who are usually \npoor  and  unskilled.  Greenhouse  farming  is  labor-intensive  in  nature  and  the  increasing \nagricultural  yield  realized  by  the  project  will  boost  the  demand  for  labor  and  increase \nemployment and wages. \n \n ", "4  \n18.  The project\u2019s impact comes not only in direct forms, but also from its off-farm activities. \nIn addition to expanded demand for manufactured products such as greenhouse materials, \nfertilizers, and packaging goods, rising agricultural labor incomes will be spent on off-farm \nproducts and services like household goods and rural and urban services, including education, \nhealth care, and financial and domestic services. Many of these demands can be efficiently \ncaptured by local small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n3.  Output \n \n19.  The output of the project is the successful completion of Le Gaga\u2019s expansion of modern \ngreenhouse  facilities  in  Guangdong  and  Fujian  provinces.  Direct  benefits  brought  by  the \nexpansion include the procurement of local goods and services for construction. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 \n \n20.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which strongly \nemphasizes food security and agricultural productivity, and committed about $2 billion in new \nfunding annually to remove country-specific and regional constraints to food security and reduce \nthe vulnerability of poor populations to food price increases (footnote 3). The project fully meets \nthe strategic objective for poverty reduction by promoting inclusive economic growth through \nincreased productivity. The project also aligns with the objective of promoting private sector \ndevelopment and private sector operations, and the focus on inclusive growth. \n \n2.  Consistency with Country Strategy \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s PRC country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 identifies agriculture and natural \nresources as one of four priority sectors of ADB support for inclusive and environmentally \nsustainable development. 6 Private sector development remains a key driver of change. The \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015) of the PRC shares this development agenda and places \nnational priority on agricultural and rural development with specific emphasis on agricultural \nmodernization and improvement of farmers\u2019 living standards, along with resource conservation, \nenvironmental protection, and social inclusion elements. The project is fully aligned with these \nnational priorities by promoting industrial management of agriculture with advanced horticultural \ntechniques and increasing productivity and income opportunities for rural farmers. \n \n3.  Consistency with Sector Strategy \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s  operational  plan  for  sustainable  food  security  supports  its  intervention  in \nagriculture and rural development, particularly the aim to boost primary production, strengthen \nlinks along food and agricultural value chains, ensure food security for the poor and vulnerable, \nand increase their participation in economic activities.7 The plan suggests expanded partnership \nwith the private sector to attract more direct investments in productivity enhancement. The \nproject fully meets the sector strategy by seeking to upgrade inclusive food and agricultural \nvalue chains, which enhance agricultural productivity, broaden the rural economy with expanded \nincome channels, promote sector integration and efficiency, and improve food security for the \nurban and rural poor. \n \n                                                      \n6  ADB. 2012.

Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n23.  Le  Gaga  intends  to  fund  the  capital  expenditure  over  the  FY2015\u2013FY2017  mainly \nthrough borrowing and internal cash flow.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  Table 1 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Pro-farming policies and measures of the People\u2019s Republic of China are defined in the \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan and the National Modern Agriculture Development Plan (2011\u2013\n2015), which made agriculture, rural areas, and farmers the nation\u2019s top priority. \nManagement  The management team of Le Gaga Holdings Limited (Le Gaga) is composed of experienced \nindividuals with many years of work history and solid background in the agriculture sector. \nConstruction  For its farming expansion, Le Gaga will hire local construction workers to build its steel-\narrangements  framed greenhouses. Materials such as plastic film, cement, steel, and tubing are all \nsourced locally and will be procured in a transparent manner. \nOperational  Each farm is led by a management team with extensive experience in agricultural production \narrangements  and in managing modern farms. Local and migrant workers are hired for planting, sowing, \nand harvesting. Le Gaga has long-standing relationships with its suppliers.a \nSales  Le Gaga sells its produce primarily to various wholesalers in the PRC. These wholesalers \ntypically pick up vegetables at the farms to distribute them to retailers and traders. \nPerformance  Le Gaga will report on its operations and financial performance, including key indicators and \nmonitoring  relevant ratios, to measure its performance, including information relating to development \neffectiveness and environmental and social issues. \na  Le Gaga will follow applicable provisions of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time)  for \nprocurement of goods and services from ADB member countries. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n25.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance to Le Gaga comprises (i) a direct loan of up to $80 million, \nand (ii) a B-loan of up to $60 million equivalent in US dollars and/or euros. ADB will fund the \ndirect  loan  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources;  the  B-loan  will  be  funded  by  participating \ncommercial banks. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s assistance is justified by its development impacts and demonstration effects. It \nwill support the government\u2019s development plan and ADB\u2019s operation strategies. \n(i)  The long-term debt financing to private-sector agriculture projects almost does \nnot exist in the PRC.8 The project will have a significant demonstration effect as it \nfeatures  a  strong  model  for  minimizing  the  transaction  costs  for  agricultural \nfinancing, which is disproportionately high due to perceived risks among potential \nlenders without sufficient sector experience. \n(ii)  The project will directly provide thousands of jobs to poor, unskilled farmers, \nmost of whom are women and/or aged people from poor rural areas. \n                                                      \n8 The lending to agriculture sector is not a main focus of commercial banks in the PRC while the support from policy banks is \nlimited. Most of the loans in the sector are for short-term working capital purpose. \n ", "6  \n(iii)  The project will tremendously increase productivity on Le Gaga\u2019s farms; help \nconserve arable land, water, and energy; improve product quality; protect the \nenvironment; and increase employment opportunities for women. \n(iv)  The prospect of the project\u2019s financial success is promising under the proposed \ntransaction structure. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n27.  The project is classified as category B for environment because the potential adverse \nenvironmental impacts of the group\u2019s subprojects are site-specific and reversible based on the \nnature  of  the  project.  The  initial  environmental  examination  will  include  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan  to  manage  possible  environmental  impacts  during  construction  and \noperation. The ESMS will also include a screening checklist to avoid environmentally sensitive \nareas and potential significant adverse impacts. \n \n28.  The project is classified as category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. The project is not expected to entail any involuntary resettlement. Land acquisition is \nbased  on  the  willing  lessor\u2013willing  lessee  principle  and  involves  only  existing  farmland. \nConstruction and operation of greenhouse facilities will be mainly on existing farmland in the \ncoastal  provinces,  and  therefore  the  project  will  not  have  any  adverse  impact  on  ethnic \nminorities. \n \n29.  The social corrective action plan for the ESMS includes the design and implementation \nof  (i)  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  screening  and  categorization  procedures;  (ii)  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples policy principles and procedures, including those for land \nleasing  arrangement,  to  make  sure  that  subprojects  using  ADB  funds  are  screened  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; and (iii) an effective grievance mechanism \nwith proper documentation. Le Gaga will recruit capable staff and/or consultants to ensure that \nthe ESMS is duly implemented. \n \n30.  Other social dimensions. The project is categorized as some gender elements. Le \nGaga upholds gender equality, and provides equal benefits and training opportunities for both \nmen and women employees. Jobs to be created by farms will be offered to the local labor force \nregardless of gender, and priority will be given to the female labor force where interest is high in \nagricultural production. Le Gaga will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and shall \ntake measures to comply with the national labor laws and relevant internationally recognized \ncore labor standards.9 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n31.  Le Gaga was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice in \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n   \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n32.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  \nsingle-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n                                                      \n9 ADB. 2003.

Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to Le Gaga will be obtained.10 ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following \napproval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the direct loan of up to $80,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and \n(ii)  the B-loan of up to $60,000,000 equivalent in US dollars and/or euros to be \nfunded by participating commercial banks, \nto  Le  Gaga  Holdings  Limited  for  the  Greenhouse  Agricultural  Development  Project  in  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n11 November 2014\n                                                      \n10 ADB. 1966.
