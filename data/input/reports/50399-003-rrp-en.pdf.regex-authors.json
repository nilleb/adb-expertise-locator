THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan (PBL) and a proposed project loan, both to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR) for the Education for Employment Sector Development Program. \n \n2.  The proposed sector development program (SDP) is part of long-term Asian Development \nBank (ADB) support to strengthen human capital development in the Lao PDR. The PBL will help \nthe Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) to undertake reforms to progressively align post-\nprimary education (PPE)\u2014including secondary education, technical and vocational education and \ntraining (TVET), and higher education\u2014with evolving labor demand and skill needs. The project \ncomponent  will  support  MOES  in  delivering  these  reforms  effectively,  widening  access  to \nsecondary education, and improving its quality. The SDP builds on the Secondary Education \nSector Development Program (SESDP) and will tap synergies with ongoing ADB support for \nTVET and higher education.1  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  \n  Rationale \n3.  Economic  performance.  The  Lao  PDR  is  among  the  fast-growing  economies  in \nSoutheast Asia. Owing to a boom in minerals, hydropower, and forest products, and strong foreign \ndirect investment in these areas, its gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of \n7.5% per year during 2010\u20132018. Gross national income per capita grew from $1,000 in 2010 to \n$2,270 in 2017. The Lao PDR met the criteria for graduation from least-developed country status \nfor the first time in 2018.2 Despite this growth, the pace of structural transformation from an \neconomy based on the primary sector to one driven by industry and services remains sluggish, \nwith little change in the sectoral composition of employment. In 2018, services accounted for 48% \nof value added and 30% of employment, while industry accounted for 34% of value added and \n10% of employment. Nearly 60% of the workforce remains employed in agriculture, even though \nit accounts for only 18% of value added.3 The shift in the employment structure remains limited \nbecause of the capital-intensive nature of natural resource exploitation, weak infrastructure, and \nlow employability of the labor force. The country\u2019s performance in reducing poverty and improving \nsocial development has been below expectation.4 The Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey \nshows that poverty declined from 27.6% in 2007 to 23.2% in 2013. Income inequality widened \nbetween 1993 and 2013, with the Gini coefficient increasing from 0.31 to 0.36.5 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB.

Manila. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  The  development  problem.  Low  human  capital,  poor  infrastructure,  and  weak \ngovernance and inefficient public management are the three main cross-cutting challenges \nimpeding the Lao PDR\u2019s structural transformation, and its efforts toward poverty reduction and \ninclusive growth.6 The country\u2019s human capital base is weak mainly because of the very low \nenrollment and completion rates in lower secondary (grades 6 to 9) and upper secondary (grades \n10 to 12) education. As the Lao PDR nears universal primary schooling with completion rates \nabove 83%, access to good-quality secondary education has become a binding constraint. Only \n54% of the country\u2019s youth (54% males and 53% females) aged 22\u201324 years surveyed in 2012-\n2013 had completed lower secondary, and only 31% (32% males and 31% females) had \ncompleted  upper  secondary  education.7  Inequalities  across  wealth,  gender,  ethnicity,  and \ngeographic dimensions are interlinked: e.g., among 17\u221219-year-olds in households in the lowest \nwealth quintile, only 13% of females and 16% of males complete lower secondary education, \ncompared with 91% of female and 89% of male counterparts in the richest quintile. A high \nproportion of young people drop out of secondary schools and take up low-skill, temporary jobs \nin the informal sector.8 The high dropout rate is a result of various factors\u2014acute shortage of \nsecondary schools; poor quality of school facilities and dormitories; lack of properly trained \nteachers; social norms surrounding girls\u2019 education, and early marriage in some communities; \nand the expenses for school supplies and transportation, which make it difficult for poor families \nto keep their children in school up to grade 12.9 \n \n5.  Low employability of youth. Secondary education graduates in the Lao PDR account \nfor 47% of 18\u201327-year-olds in industry and services, while higher education and TVET graduates \ntogether account for only 29%. Employers in the Lao PDR face a shortage of vocation-specific \nhard skills (e.g., welding, electrical, and automotive); foundational skills (e.g., reading, writing, \nbasic mathematics and science, critical thinking, analytical  ability, transfer of learning, and \nproblem solving); and soft skills (e.g., communication, punctuality, hygiene, ability to work within \nteams,  gender,  and  cultural  sensitivity).  Unless  the  country\u2019s  youth  complete  secondary \neducation, their basic foundational and soft skills, which are critical for higher studies and/or work, \nwill remain inadequate. This will trap them in a vicious cycle of low-skill, informal sector jobs, with \nbleak prospects for decent employment or a meaningful career. Among those aged 18\u221227 years, \n67.3% of women and 61.6% of men are in vulnerable employment (unpaid family or own-account \nwork).10 The gap between the demand and supply of skills will continue to widen unless the \ncoverage and quality of secondary education are improved. The economy will find it difficult to \nreduce its dependence on  natural resource exploitation and low-cost labor, and make the \ntransition to higher value-added sectors. The Lao PDR will not be able to tap its potential \ndemographic dividend or reduce its dependence on foreign-skilled workers.  \n \n6.  Weak alignment between post-primary education and skill needs. While raising \nsecondary education enrollment, completion, and quality is a necessary condition for the Lao PDR \nto tap the full potential of its human resources, this will not be sufficient. Progressively, the quality \nand relevance of the entire PPE\u2014secondary education, TVET, and higher education\u2014must be \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2017.

Manila.  \n7  By comparison, estimated female lower secondary education completion rates are: Cambodia (57%), Thailand \n(82%), and Viet Nam (90%). \n8  Unless otherwise noted, quantitative figures are based on an ADB analysis of data from the 2015 Population and \nHousing Census and 2017 Lao PDR Social Indicator Survey datasets. \n9  Enrollment in secondary education is estimated to grow from 671,000 in 2018 to 819,900 by 2025.  \n10 According to the 2018 Household and Youth Survey, (i) the youth unemployment rate at 13% in the Lao PDR is more \nthan six times higher than the adult rate (2%); and (ii) an estimated 473,000 youth aged 15\u201329 years were not \nenrolled in education, employment, or training.

Owing to fiscal challenges, the Lao PDR\u2019s education \nbudget grew by only 9% during 2013\u20132018. PPE is severely under-resourced. Per-student block \ngrant financing for secondary schools is lower than that for primary schools, even though per-\nstudent costs are higher at the secondary level. Moreover, PPE continues to be supply-driven \nand fragmented across separate MOES departments (i.e., General Education, TVET, Higher \nEducation,  Teacher  Education,  Nonformal  Education,  and  Planning;  Education  and  Sports \nStatistics Center; and Research Institute for Education and Sciences), with no unifying strategic \nframework to ensure that they collectively prepare the youth for the labor market.  \n \n7.  Required reforms. Crosscutting policy reform is required to break the silos and improve \ncoordination  across  MOES  departments.  This  will  enable  comprehensive,  evidence-based \nplanning to strengthen the links between PPE and employment and raise budget allocations. \nMOES should strengthen its engagement with the private sector to understand its needs better. \nIt should involve industry associations in the design of training curricula, competency standards, \nand apprenticeship programs.11 Reforms are also required to (i) improve the quality of the \nsecondary  education  curricula,  textbooks,  learning  material,  pedagogy,  and  assessment \nstandards; and (ii) ensure that MOES targets its budget to underserved areas and disadvantaged \ngroups to improve their access to schools with dormitories, laboratories, libraries, and toilets.12 \nIntegrated policy reforms will provide the platform and enabling environment for the investment \nsupport needed to raise the coverage and quality of secondary education, including building more \nschools, investing in teacher training based on the improved teaching and learning materials, and \nstrengthening the alignment of PPE with labor demand. \n \n8.  Alignment with government\u2019s priorities. The Lao PDR\u2019s 8th National Socio-economic \nDevelopment Plan, 2016\u20132020 prioritizes education as a prerequisite for poverty reduction and \ninclusive growth.13 Secondary education reform is central to its goal of graduating from a least-\ndeveloped country status by 2020. The Education and Sports Sector Development Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020 calls for increased funding for PPE to raise youth employability.14 Its midterm review, \ncompleted in late 2018, emphasized the need to (i) increase transition from primary to lower \nsecondary  to  upper  secondary  levels;  (ii)  move  toward  universal  enrollment  at  the  lower \nsecondary level, and eventually at the upper secondary level; (iii) raise secondary completion \nrates; (iv) improve teaching and student learning outcomes; and (v) strengthen the evidence basis \nfor policies and investments to link education more effectively to employment.15 The proposed \nSDP has been designed accordingly to reinforce the government\u2019s efforts to fulfill these priorities. \nFurther,  by  improving  the  resilience  of  school  facilities  against  floods,  droughts,  higher \ntemperatures, erratic precipitation, and other extreme events, the SDP will support the adaptation \n                                                \n11 These policy reforms and the investment support needed for operationalization are included under output 1. \n12 These policy reforms and the investment support needed for operationalization are included under outputs 2 and 3. \n13 Government of the Lao PDR.

ADB engagements and lessons. ADB\u2019s Lao PDR country partnership strategy, 2017\u2013\n2020 reinforces ADB\u2019s continuing role of supporting PPE and complementing the work of other \ndevelopment partners that focus on pre-primary and primary education.18 Strategic priority 2 of \nthe country partnership strategy emphasizes the need for human resource development by \nstrengthening PPE to ensure that graduates are more employable and able to diversify into \nindustry and services. The proposed SDP is aligned with this priority. It will build on lessons from \nthe SESDP (footnote 1) and its reforms, which include revision of the secondary education \ncurriculum; extension of secondary education to grade 12; and introduction of a new bachelor-\nlevel, preservice teacher education program for secondary school teachers. Under the proposed \nSDP, all teacher training programs and capacity-building workshops will be made more results-\noriented. The aim is to build capacity within MOES departments and teacher training colleges, so \nthat they can gradually reduce dependence on consultants and sustain the reforms on their own. \nTeacher training colleges will make greater use of education technology and digital modules to \npromote  learner-centered  pedagogy  and  improve  the  quality  of  teacher  training.  Advance \ncontracting will raise project readiness and ensure that the proposed schools and related facilities \nare  constructed  within  2\u22123  years.  This  will  enable  an  early  increase  in  secondary  school \nenrollments. The SDP will tap synergies with the ongoing TVET and higher education projects \n(footnote 1) and strengthen coordination with other development partners.19 \n \n10.

Choice of modality. As elaborated in para. 7, complementary policy and investment \nsupport is required to reform PPE with a focus on secondary education. The PBL finances eight \npolicy actions under MOES\u2019 reform agenda, which will align PPE with evolving skill needs and \nhelp equip secondary school youth with the foundational and soft skills needed in the labor force \nand/or for pursuing TVET and higher education. These policy actions provide a platform for project \n                                                \n16 Some of the priority actions under the Lao PDR\u2019s National Adaptation Program of Action for Climate Change to be \nsupported under the proposed SDP include improving systems for the sustainable supply of drinking water and \nsanitation, with community participation in flood- and drought-prone areas; building capacity and skills of engineers \nwho design and build water and sanitation systems; and raising public awareness on sanitation. \n17 Climate-proofing measures such as enhancing the resilience of public buildings (in this case, schools and related \nfacilities) against floods, integrated under the proposed SDP, are aligned with the Lao PDR\u2019s intended nationally \ndetermined contributions. \n18 ADB. 2017.

The project will combine nationwide \nsupport for  strengthening secondary  education curricula  and teacher training  with  targeted \nsupport for building new facilities at 60 schools in disadvantaged districts (footnote 24). The SDP \nwill facilitate partnerships between secondary schools and local TVET institutes and centers for \nnonformal education, to allow secondary school students to undertake short internships during \nvacations (para. 14). The project will pilot innovations such as secondary school clusters (para. \n16), wherein groups of six schools across 20 selected districts (i.e. 120 schools in all) will be \norganized into hubs and spokes, so that they can tap into each other\u2019s resources (i.e., pedagogical \nadvisers, information technology facilities, and laboratories) and use them more efficiently. The \nproject component will help MOES undertake follow-on reform actions by 2022 as part of the post-\nprogram partnership framework (P3F).21 In view of these considerations, the sector development \nprogram modality is the most appropriate. \n \n  Sector Development Program Description \n12.  Impact. The SDP is aligned with the following impact: inclusive, balanced, and skills-\ndriven economic growth achieved (footnote 13). It will have the following outcome: employability \nof secondary school youth enhanced.22 \n \n13.  Output  1:  Alignment  of  post-primary  education  with  labor  market  demand \nstrengthened. The SDP will provide policy and investment support to align PPE with the evolving \nskill needs of the Lao PDR\u2019s economy. Under the PBL component, two policy actions have been \nachieved. First, to strengthen PPE planning and budgeting, MOES departments are preparing \naction plans for secondary education, TVET, and higher education, with an emphasis on gender \nequity as instructed by MOES. These action plans will provide a unifying strategic framework, \nimprove coordination and information exchange across departments, facilitate comprehensive \nplanning and data analysis, and progressively align all three with the changing labor demand. \nSecond, MOES has increased the block grant per student for secondary education from kip \n(KN)50,000 to KN70,000; and for TVET, from KN270,000 to KN300,000 per student.23 This will \nenable secondary schools and TVET institutions to increase spending on non-salary recurrent \ncosts, including quality-related inputs such as consumables for teaching and learning, extra-\ncurricular activities to promote all-round learning, and operations and maintenance of school \nfacilities. \n \n14.  Under output 1, the project component will (i) strengthen the capacity and systems of \nMOES departments for monitoring the skills supply from PPE, improve cross-departmental \ncollaboration, and deepen industry engagement; (ii) pilot partnering models linking secondary \nschools with nearby TVET and nonformal education centers in 20 selected districts (including the \n12 disadvantaged districts); and (iii) improve student counseling on academic and career options. \nSupport will be provided to the National Commission on Human Resource Development to \nconsolidate fragmented data and conduct sex-disaggregated analysis on education\u2212employment \nlinks and evolving skill needs. MOES will pilot partnerships between secondary schools and \nnearby TVET schools, nonformal education centers, and local industries to allow secondary \nschool students to undertake brief internships during vacations. This will expose students to the \nworld of work and prepare them better for employment. Counseling material will be developed \n                                                \n21 The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. ADB may consider subsequent support for P3F reform actions. \n22 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n23 Block grants are nondiscretionary budget allocations determined through formulae based on objective parameters \nsuch as the number of students and teachers in a school, location, socioeconomic and poverty indicators, and quality \nof facilities. As they are based on objective parameters, the block grants increase the transparency in fund allocation \nand enable schools and TVET institutions to raise spending to improve facilities and the overall learning environment.   \n ", "6 \nunder the SDP to address gender stereotypes and raise the awareness of secondary school \nstudents about career and job opportunities. Output 1 will thus support MOES in undertaking the \ndownstream reforms included in the P3F to continue with comprehensive planning and budgeting \nto target PPE investments in underserved regions. \n \n15.  Output 2: Quality and relevance of secondary education to emerging skills demands \nstrengthened. To enhance the employability of youth, it is essential to improve the quality and \nrelevance of secondary education in the priority subjects\u2014sciences, mathematics, English, and \nLao language\u2014that are critical for higher education and/or for jobs. Under the PBL component, \nMOES accomplished five policy actions to support comprehensive reforms. Textbooks for the \npriority subjects are being aligned to the updated curricula. MOES accredited eight provincial \nteacher training institutions to ensure that they offer quality teacher training at the bachelor's \ndegree level in these subjects. To encourage active participation by students during classes and \nto enhance their confidence and creative thinking (as opposed to rote learning), MOES introduced \nlearner-centered pedagogy. It has increased support for continuing professional development \n(CPD) to complement in-service teacher training. This will ensure that teachers regularly refresh \ntheir knowledge in these priority subjects and use improved delivery methods. The policy on \nnational student assessment is being aligned with international standards.  \n \n16.  Under output 2, the project component will further operationalize these policy reforms by \n(i) strengthening secondary education curriculum, pedagogy, and student assessment, focusing \non the priority subjects; (ii) supporting nationwide in-service training in the priority subjects and \nupgrading the qualifications of secondary teachers (prioritizing women) who teach these subjects, \npiloting CPD in 20 districts (including the 12 disadvantaged districts), and expanding the use of \neducation technology to improve the delivery of learner-centered teaching; and (iii) providing print-\nbased and digital learning resources for science laboratories and libraries to the secondary school \nclusters (para.11), so that they can deliver the improved curriculum effectively. Support will be \nprovided to update lower and upper secondary curricula in the priority subjects and to revise the \nteachers\u2019 guides and learning materials, ensuring sensitivity to gender, ethnicity, and disabilities. \nThe approach towards classroom and sample-based assessments of student learning outcomes \nwill be reviewed and aligned with international standards. Output 2 will help MOES deliver the \npolicy reforms and support progress toward the downstream reforms included in the P3F on (i) \nupdating of the curricula in the priority subjects, (ii) reforming CPD further; and (iii) undertaking \nrigorous assessments of learning outcomes.  \n \n17.  Output 3: Equitable secondary education access and completion increased. The \nSDP will support reforms and investments to address supply and demand-side constraints that \nare keeping secondary school enrollment and completion low. Under the PBL component, MOES \napproved  a  list  of  47  districts  that  suffer  from  an  acute  shortage  of  secondary  schools, \novercrowded schools, and high dropout rates after the primary level. This will enable MOES to \ntarget more funding for school facilities, teacher training, and deployment to these underserved \nareas. The project component will (i) alleviate supply-side constraints in 12 of these 47 districts \nby constructing additional classroom blocks, sex-segregated dormitories, sanitation facilities, and \ntoilets at 60 primary and secondary school sites (owned by the government); and (ii) reduce \ndemand-side constraints to access and completion by providing stipends based on a combination \nof need and merit, and prioritizing female and ethnic group students.24 At primary schools, new \n                                                \n24 MOES has designated 47 districts of the Lao PDR as \u201cpriority districts\u201d for secondary education investments under \npolicy action 8 of the PBL. From these 47 districts, it selected 20 districts for the activities proposed under outputs 1 \nand 2.

All these \nmeasures will ensure that more girls and boys, including those belonging to ethnic groups, will be \nable to enroll in secondary schools and complete their education.  \n \n  Value Added by ADB \n18.  Value addition. The SDP will build the capacity of MOES for undertaking comprehensive \nplanning and data analysis of PPE, which collectively supplies four-fifths of the entrants to industry \nand services. It will build on the reforms supported under the SESDP (para. 9). The SDP will \ncomplement the European Union\u2019s budget support and linked United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \ntechnical assistance, which focus on pre-primary and primary education.25 The SDP will support \ninnovations and add value by (i) piloting partnership arrangements linking secondary schools, \nTVET, nonformal education centers, and local industries, and improving counseling for students, \nto better prepare them for jobs; (ii) making greater use of education technology solutions to \nimprove teacher training; (iii) improving secondary school assessments to shift the focus from rote \nlearning to critical thinking and soft skills; and (iv) introducing a secondary school cluster model \nto improve education quality and management. Crosscutting public finance reforms planned \nunder ADB\u2019s proposed Strengthening Public Finance Management Program26 will support the \nSDP  by  strengthening  the  medium-term  planning  framework  in  the  education  sector  and \nimproving the management of limited resources.  \n \n  Development Financing Needs and Investment and Financing Plan   \n19.

DUE DILIGENCE \n  Economic and Financial Viability \n23.  An inadequately educated and skilled workforce continues to be a binding constraint, \nmaking the Lao PDR\u2019s economy heavily reliant on natural resource exploitation and cheap labor. \n ", "10 \nThis  is  unsustainable.  A  background  analysis  confirms  that  increasing  secondary  school \nenrollment and completion rates will yield a high return to the economy.29 For individuals, \ncompletion of secondary education is estimated to yield a wage return of about 18% (roughly \ndouble that of primary education or TVET, though significantly less than that of university \ndegrees), with higher wage returns for women.30 This is consistent with global evidence that \nemployers often find it hard to get youth with the required soft skills, and that education yields the \nhighest returns for females and disadvantaged groups.31 In addition to opening access to higher-\npaying formal sector jobs, educating females breaks long-term poverty traps by lowering fertility \nrates and increasing investments in the human capital of the next generation. The overall benefits \nare expected to significantly exceed the SDP\u2019s incremental costs (investment and recurrent). \nThese will peak at 2.7% of the total education budget mid-project and average 0.5% post-project, \nwhich is deemed modest and sustainable. The net present value of the project (using a 6% \neconomic discount rate) is conservatively assessed at $333.1 million, with a 13.7% economic \ninternal rate of return.32 \n \n  Sustainability \n24.  MOES remains committed to education reform. However, owing to the Lao PDR\u2019s high \nfiscal debt, the government\u2019s capacity to provide adequate funds for secondary education, TVET \nand higher education may be constrained. Despite the recent increase in the amount of block \ngrants for secondary schools, the sustainability of the project assets may be at risk due to the lack \nof  adequate funding for  operations  and  maintenance.  ADB\u2019s  Strengthening  Public  Finance \nManagement Program (footnote 26) will strengthen debt management and tax reforms, and \nmedium-term fiscal and expenditure frameworks to ensure that limited resources are aligned with \ngovernment priorities, while meeting fiscal deficit targets to promote macroeconomic stability. If \nsustained, these measures, together with the assistance being provided by the International \nMonetary Fund to strengthen the revenue base, will create additional fiscal space and enable the \nLao PDR to raise (nonrecurrent) education sector spending to the required level. \n \n  Governance \n25.  Due diligence reviews confirmed the strong track record of MOES in managing ADB \nprograms  and  projects,  including  in  the  areas  of  financial  management,  procurement,  and \nanticorruption efforts. The unmitigated financial management risk is substantial mainly because \nof inefficiencies in multi-tiered internal processes, delayed reporting and liquidation of completed \nactivities, use of multiple project finance-related data systems, and capacity gaps at schools and \nin districts. To mitigate financial management and procurement risks, MOES will recruit qualified \nfinancial management and procurement specialists to be based in the PMU. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and \nMOES. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM \n(footnote 28). \n \n                                                \n29 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n30 World Bank. 2013.

Endemic  poverty  and  inequalities  across  wealth,  gender,  ethnicity,  and  geographic \ndimensions in the Lao PDR are interlinked.33 Among the 15\u201317-year-olds in households in the \nlowest wealth quintile, only 13% of females and 14% of males complete lower secondary \neducation, compared with 88% of female counterparts and 81% of male counterparts in the richest \nwealth  quintile.  About  35%  of  non-Lao-Tai  females  complete  lower  secondary  education, \ncompared with 44% of non-Lao-Tai males; among the Lao-Tai, 66% of females and 63% of males \ndo so. While the country as a whole now has near gender parity in access to primary and lower \nsecondary education, a gender gap exists at the upper secondary level.34 The SDP will focus on \nareas with high female and male dropout rates and prevalence of ethnic groups. The gender \naction plan will mainstream gender concerns in program implementation. The construction of \n60 schools (with dormitories and wash facilities) in 12 disadvantaged districts (footnote 24) will \nimprove access for girls, youth from ethnic groups, and the differently abled. MOES will prioritize \nstipend support for females and disadvantaged students. The school facilities will incorporate \nresilience measures to mitigate the impacts of floods, droughts, high temperatures, and extreme \nstorm events. The design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) provides gender-disaggregated \nindicators for the outcome and outputs. The SDP is categorized gender equity theme. \n \n  Safeguards \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nare as follows.35 \n \n28.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination has been prepared \ncovering all 60 selected schools and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.36 Project civil works are minor \nin scope and limited to existing school sites. Impacts during construction will be localized and \nshort-term, and can be addressed with good construction site management and practice, as set \nout in the environment management plans. Overall, impacts are expected to be beneficial, \nimproving hygiene, sanitation, and waste management.  The project will finance a national \nenvironmental  safeguard  consultant  to  support  the  government  in  meeting  the  safeguard \nrequirements. The PMU will establish a site-specific grievance redress mechanism to manage \ncomplaints and issues during implementation. The PBL component is not anticipated to have any \nenvironmental impacts.  \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not involve any involuntary \nresettlement.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  confirmed  that  there  will  be  no  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts since all works will take place within the boundaries of existing facilities on \nstate-owned land, are free of encumbrances, and will not restrict access to lands or impinge on \npeople\u2019s livelihoods. \n \n30.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  indigenous  peoples  plan  (ethnic  group \ndevelopment plan) ensures that (i) analysis of education\u2212employment links will be disaggregated \nby ethnic groups; (ii) new secondary teacher education curriculum and teaching materials are \nsensitive  to  ethnic  group  concerns;  (iii)  dormitory  conditions  are  sensitive  to  ethnic  group \ndimensions; (iv) capacity development programs prioritize participation by ethnic group staff and \nteachers; and (v) youth from disadvantaged ethnic groups are prioritized for stipend support.  \n                                                \n33 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 ADB.
