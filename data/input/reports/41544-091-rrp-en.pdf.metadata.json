THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased  grant  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Second  Investment  Climate \nImprovement Program.1  \n \n2.  The program aims to improve the private sector investment climate and help diversify the \neconomy.2 The program will accomplish this by supporting increasing access to finance for small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), enabling private participation in infrastructure, diversifying \nexport products and markets, encouraging diversified foreign direct investment (FDI), improving \nskills to match market needs, increasing transparency in the government, and reducing the cost \nof doing business.3  \n  \nII.  THE PROGRAM  \nA.  Rationale  \n3.  Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the Kyrgyz Republic slowed marginally to 3.8% \nin 2016 from 3.9% in 2015. Recovery of the gold sector, an increase in private consumption fueled \nby increased remittances resulting from easier access to the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) \nlabor markets,4 and government spending helped offset a slowdown in manufacturing, the \nspillover effect of the recession in the Russian Federation, and slower growth in the Republic of \nKazakhstan. In 2016, overall exports increased by 4.8%\u2014exports to EEU member countries \nincreased by 4.3%,5 and exports to other main markets by 5.3%. Imports declined by 5.7%, mainly \nas a result of lower energy imports and weak domestic demand. The 2016 fiscal deficit increased \nto 4.5% of GDP from 3% in 2015, fueled by a shortfall in tax revenue. However, appreciation of \nthe Som, restrained spending on nonpriority items, and the rephasing of externally financed \ninvestment projects limited the increase in the fiscal deficit. Public debt increased by $300 million \nin 2016, with the ratio of public debt to GDP at about the legal threshold of 60% of GDP.6 The de-\ndollarization policy actions of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) led to a sharp \ndecline in dollarization levels. From 2015 to 2016, the proportion of deposits held in dollars \ndeclined by 15.7% to 56.2%, while the proportion of loans denominated in dollars fell by 12.2% to \n44.1%. GDP growth is expected to slow slightly to 3.5% in 2017 before accelerating to 4.3% in \n2018. However, slow growth is expected in regional economies7, and the Kyrgyz economy is \nexpected to remain on a lower-growth trajectory because its links with these economies through \nremittances, trade, and foreign investment channels.  \n \n4.  Since 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working with the government \nto support one of the key priorities of the country\u2019s National Sustainable Development Strategy, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The proposed subprogram 3 is included in ADB. 2013. Country Partnership Strategy: Kyrgyz Republic, 2013\u20132017. \nManila and in ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Kyrgyz Republic, 2016\u20132018. Manila. Subprogram 1 \nwas approved on 17 June 2015, and Subprogram 2 on 29 July 2016. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction technical assistance for the Second Investment Climate \nImprovement Program.  \n4  In 2016 remittances increased by 21.6% from 2015 levels, and totaled $1.6 billion, but remain below pre-crisis levels. \nRemittances constituted about 30% of GDP in 2016. \n5  In 2016, the share of exports to the EEU comprised about 26% of the country\u2019s total exports.  \n6  The legislation allowing the government to review the debt threshold level on an annual basis came into force in \nJanuary 2017, effectively removing the administrative constraint for government debt to be capped at 60% of GDP. \n7  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. May 2017. Regional Economic Prospects in EBRD Countries \nof Operations.  \n ", "2 \n2013\u20132017,  to  decrease  the  country\u2019s  dependence  on  natural  resource  exploitation  and \nmigration-led remittances by improving the investment climate and supporting private sector \ndevelopment.8 Past  and  ongoing  ADB  assistance  (footnote  2)  has  contributed  to  progress \nincluding growing private sector contributions to diversified and sustainable economic growth. \nSince investment climate improvement reforms are a process requiring continuous support,9 \nsubprogram 3 of the Second Investment Climate Improvement Program (Second ICIP) focuses \non the remaining policy and institutional reforms, as well as their implementation, necessary to (i) \nfurther expand access to financial services, (ii) improve physical infrastructure and services \ndelivery, (iii) diversify trade and investment away from commodities, (iv) align workforce skills with \nthe needs of employers, and (v) reduce corruption and the cost of doing business.  \n \n5.  Inadequate access to financial services. The level of financial intermediation has \nimproved significantly, with the share of loans to GDP increasing from 27.1% in 2015 to 38.9% in \n2016. SMEs contributed about 40% of GDP in 2016,10 13% of total exports in 2015, and about \n19% of total employment in 2015. However, the use of suitable products and services by SMEs \nis constrained by high bank lending interest rates (with a weighted average of 18.2%, and 22.0% \nfor Som-denominated loans) and high collateral requirements (120%\u2013200% of the loan amount). \nThis prevents SMEs from contributing to economic growth in the formal sector and creating \ndiversified and high value-added jobs. To meet SME financing needs and reduce reliance on \ncollateral-based lending, credit guarantee mechanisms should be expanded to increase access \nto bank financing. The failure of the banking sector to effectively capture remittances (footnote 4) \nreduces the size of the deposit base that could otherwise be used for long-term SME financing. \nLending processes are underdeveloped, with a greater focus on collateral-based lending than on \nbusiness cash flows. Access to finance for those who are underbanked\u2014 particularly women and \nrural and remote populations\u2014is impaired by the weak payment infrastructure, including mobile \nbanking, and low levels of financial literacy. The move to an e-economy and greater use of mobile \nfinancial services can lower the cost of financial intermediation and expand outreach to new \ncustomers (especially in rural areas), women, and marginalized groups, thus helping them to \nengage in productive economic activities. Addressing these issues can help increase funding \nopportunities for the private sector and broaden private sector access to finance. \n \n6.  High  infrastructure  and  service  needs.  Substantial  investments  and  expertise, \nparticularly  from  the  private  sector,  are  needed  to  develop  critical  economic  and  social \ninfrastructure  and  services  to  facilitate  private  sector  activity.  Progress  has  been  made  in \ndeveloping the policy, legal and regulatory, institutional, and financial enabling environment for \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs).11 Further strengthening is needed to build an effective PPP \nprogram and crowd-in private sector expertise and investments. Dedicated financing for project \npreparation and advisory services, and improved knowledge and technical capacity of key \ngovernment ministries and agencies will help prepare bankable projects and bring private sector \nparticipation, including through PPP transactions. The government needs to improve its capacity \n                                                \n8  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, National Council for Sustainable Development of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013. \nNational Sustainable Development Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic 2013\u20132017. Bishkek. \n9  Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 SMEs are broadly distributed among the trade sector (26%), real estate sector (24%), transport and communications \n(9%), production sector (14%), construction sector (10%), and others (17%). As of the end of 2015, 795 of the 14,027 \nSMEs could be classified as medium-sized. In addition, there are more than 366,000 individual entrepreneurs and \n400,700 peasant farms. \n11 ADB. Kyrgyz Republic. Strengthening the Enabling Environment for Public\u2013Private Partnerships. Achievements \ninclude the PPP law and regulations assigning roles for the Ministry of Economy (coordination), Ministry of Finance \n(risk management), and line ministries (project initiation and development); establishment of the Project Development \nSupport Facility for project preparation advisory and structuring; and a pipeline of 13 projects. The technical \nassistance supports output 2 of the program.  ", "  3 \nto plan, regulate, execute, and oversee PPP projects; and increase private investor confidence \nthrough  proper  allocation  of  risk  and  reward  incentives  for  investors,  and  by  executing \ndemonstration projects (footnote 12). Given the early stage of PPP market development in the \ncountry and the absence of long-term finance, continued government support through risk \nparticipation is needed to ensure the viability and affordability of PPP projects. Experience in well-\ndeveloped markets indicates that at least 5 years is required to bring the first PPP projects to the \nmarket and reach contract awards. \n \n7.  Undiversified trade and investment. The country\u2019s trade and FDI policies support \nmarket openness, as indicated by the improvement in the trade-to-GDP ratio, from 95% in 2005 \nto 110% in 2015.12 However, exports\u2014which increased by 4.8% in 2016\u2014remain concentrated, \nboth with respect to destinations (with Switzerland accounting for 34.0%, Kazakhstan for 17.8%, \nthe Russian Federation for 9.0%, and Uzbekistan for 8.1%) and product (gold and other minerals \naccount for 34%). FDI is focused on a few capital-intensive investments in mining and energy, \nwith minimal technology and skills transfer, or links with the local economy.13 Diversification of the \nexport  base  and  FDI,  and  realization  of  the  intended  benefits  of  EEU  accession  and  the \nGeneralized System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) trade privilege of the European Union (EU), \nrequire substantial improvements in customs infrastructure and logistics, infrastructure, and \ntechnical expertise.14 These improvements are critical to implement product standardization, \nmetrology, and accreditation, and harmonization with the EEU. FDI expansion and diversification \nwill also require addressing risks related to disputes with foreign investors. In most disputes \nbetween foreign investors and the government, the Kyrgyz judicial system fails to act as an \nindependent arbiter.15 A transparent investor dispute resolution mechanism will provide for out-of-\ncourt settlements, thereby avoiding protracted and costly litigation, and renegotiation of contracts. \n  \n8.  Industry\u2013labor market skills mismatch. Potential employees lack the skills needed for \nemployment in the private sector, particularly in the agri-industrial, energy, mining, transport and \ncommunications,  tourism  and  services,  and  manufacturing  and  logistics  sectors.  A  skilled \nworkforce is needed to increase productivity and accelerate private sector development, and \nthereby expand opportunities for better-paid jobs and higher incomes. Industry sector skills \n  \ncouncils have been operationalized to support better interaction between technical and vocational \neducation and training (TVET) and the labor market. However, occupational standards and \ncompetence-based learning content need further improvement, as they are not streamlined and \ninstitutionalized to ensure that TVET curricula meet the needs of private enterprises.16 \n \n \n9.  Weak governance and high cost of doing business. Real and perceived corruption \nremains  a  key  obstacle  for  doing  business.  Public  service  delivery  lacks  transparency, \naccountability, and efficiency. The high costs of compliance with government regulations and high \nprofit tax rates impair private sector development. The move to government e-procurement \nsystems and tax administration reforms will help reduce compliance costs and provide incentives \nfor formalization of businesses. \n                                                \n12 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. 2016. Investment Policy Review: Kyrgyzstan. Geneva. \n13 In 2016, FDI was concentrated in manufacturing (31%) and power generation (15%), dwarfing mining (7%). The top \ninvestors were from the People\u2019s Republic of China, Canada, and the Russian Federation. \n14 GSP+ is a trade privilege granted by the EU to a few countries to help diversify their economies. It eliminates or sets \nhighly preferential tariffs for more than 7,000 product exports from these countries. The countries are required to \nratify and implement international conventions on human and labor rights, environment, and good governance. \n15 The country is a member of the (i) 1958 New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral \nAwards since March 1997, and (ii) International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes since July 1997.  \n16 One of the key objectives of the Education Development Strategy 2012-2020 of the government is to ensure greater \nsynergy  between  labor  market  needs  and  skills  and  vocational  education  and  training. \nhttp://www.globalpartnership.org/fr/download/file/fid/44406.  ", "4 \n10.  Government efforts. The State Guarantee Fund (SGF) has been in operation since \nNovember 2016, and has leveraged Som125 million ($1.1 million) in guarantees to provide \nSom520 million ($5.5 million) in bank lending. Risk-based supervision of microfinance institutions \nis also helping reduce the risk of lending to SMEs. To reduce the share of cash circulating in the \neconomy,  all  public  sector  salaries  are  paid  through  local  payment  cards.  Social  benefits \npayments through cards have increased from 9.3% (2015) to 13.0% (2016) and pensions \npayments through cards have increased from 38.4% (2015) to 43.0% (2016). SMEs receive tax \nincentives for using noncash transactions. The NBKR\u2019s strengthened regulations are increasing \nservice offerings through electronic payment transactions, payment cards, ATMs, and point-of-\nsale terminals. As of the first quarter of 2017, the volume of payment card transactions totaled \nSom38 million, an increase of a 46.1% over the first quarter of 2016. More than 6.2 million \npayment card transactions had been executed as of 31 March 2017, an increase of 12.2% \ncompared with the same period in 2016. Greater access to electronic payments tends to increase \nthe number of transactions rather than the value of each transaction, indicating improving financial \nservices  for  small  transactions.  Comprehensive  PPP  project  development  and  transaction \nadvisory and government financial support have resulted in 10 projects at various stages of \npreparation. Amendments to the Law on Investment have improved investor protection.  \n \n11.  Development  coordination.  Key  development  partners  are  supporting  government \nefforts  to  improve  the  investment  climate  and  ADB\u2019s  program  is  closely  coordinated  with \ndevelopment partners\u2019 interventions.17 The Extended Credit Facility of the International Monetary \nFund (IMF) was approved in April 2015, and the combined fourth and fifth reviews is expected for \nconsideration by the IMF Board in December 2017.18 The Facility supports fiscal and debt \nsustainability and finance sector stability. The World Bank supports reforms in public financial \naccounting and audit. The International Finance Corporation assists in improving the foreign \ninvestment policy and related laws, and agribusiness regulations, as well as providing PPP \ntransaction advisory services. The United States Agency for International Development helps \nimprove the competitiveness of textile, tourism, and construction sectors. The Japan International \nCooperation  Agency,  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  German \ndevelopment  cooperation  through  KfW  and  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale \nZusammenarbeit are supporting SMEs and private sector development, and PPPs. \n \n12.  ADB value addition. Continued ADB engagement has motivated the government to \ncomplete several ambitious reforms that it might not have undertaken otherwise. ADB advised \nthe government to expedite the piloting of electronic and mobile financial services, in key \ngovernment agencies which deal with public services. This is helping expand financial services \nto the currently underbanked (mainly the poor and women) and gradually reduced the size of the \ninformal economy by increasing electronic and mobile transactions through the banks. ADB\u2019s \ntechnical advice on the establishment of the SGF and initial capitalization of $1 million has \nenabled the government to channel its support for SMEs through the more effective SGF \nmechanism rather than as direct interest rate subsidies. The SGF mechanism has brought \nsubstantial value for money for the government\u2014catalyzing nearly $5.5 million in bank lending \nthrough $1.1 million of guarantees. The success of the SGF has also resulted in the Russian\u2013\n                                                \n17 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 The Second Investment Climate Improvement Program has been coordinated closely with the IMF through \ndiscussions during missions as well as through the Kyrgyz resident mission. The IMF staff has completed its country \nvisit for the combined fourth and fifth reviews under the Extended Credit Facility on 8 November 2017 and have \nreached an agreement with the authorities on the next steps, including the prior conditions for consideration of the \nreviews by the IMF Board in December 2017. The IMF is expected to disburse its fourth and fifth tranches after the \npending conditions are met. The ADB program complements the IMF program which also stresses the need to further \nimprove the country\u2019s investment climate. ", "  5 \nKyrgyz  Development  Fund  agreeing  in-principle  to  provide  additional  capitalization  of \napproximately $1.5 million. ADB\u2019s advisory on PPPs has helped the government develop its PPP \npolicy, legal, institutional, and financial framework in line with international good practice and a \npipeline of 15 projects, in addition to the first PPP contract awarded in August 2017.19 Continuous \nengagement and guidance has enabled the country to reap the benefits of the EU\u2019s GSP+ trade \nprivilege (footnote 17) in a relatively short time\u2014exports to the EU have increased by 53.4% (from \n$20.1 million in 2015 to $66.7 million in the first 11 months of 2016), and helped maintain its \nsovereign credit rating (B2 Stable) obtained from Moody\u2019s Investors Service in December 2015,20 \nenabling investors and lenders to better price country risks and open avenues to diversify the \ncountry\u2019s funding sources.  \n \n13.  Lessons. The key lessons from past interventions21\u2014that activity-oriented policy actions \nand  sustained  engagement  with  the  government  yield  substantive  results\u2014have  been \nincorporated into subprogram 3. The implementation of the Investment Climate Improvement \nProgram System Support Project has also shown that the procurement and project management \ncapacities as well as internal control environments of executing and implementing agencies \nshould be strengthened to ensure effective utilization of public resources (para 26).  \n \n14.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategy. The overall program, including subprogram 3, is aligned \nwith the country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 and the Strategy 2020 midterm review,22 and \nincluded in the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019. The new government, elected in \nOctober 2017, also supports investment climate improvement reforms including support provided \nby ADB under the Second Investment Climate Improvement Program.    \n \n15.  Programmatic approach. The Second ICIP is a programmatic approach with a results \norientation. Upstream policy and institutional reforms are followed by downstream implementation. \nFour outputs are being delivered through a package of reforms phased over three subprograms \nin a manner that allows each subprogram to build on the progress of the previous one and \nincorporate changes as necessitated by the evolving economic environment. The approach helps \nensure that the reforms are effectively implemented, and not confined to enactment of laws and \nregulations. Subprogram 3 builds on and complements the achievements under subprograms 1 \nand 2 (paras. 18\u201321). \n    \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact will be increased private sector investment in the economy. The outcome will \nbe an improved business and investment climate in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n17.  Subprogram 3 continues the reforms under subprograms 1 and 2 in four output areas \n(paras. 18\u201321). All policy actions completed under subprograms 1 and 2 remain intact; the 15 \nsubprogram 3 policy actions have helped the overall program make substantive achievements.   \n \n \n                                                \n19 The contract is for the provision of hemodialysis services in Bishkek, Osh, and Jalal-Abad.

This output aims to increase access to finance \nby reducing the risks of lending to SMEs, and increasing the access of the underbanked to the \nformal financial system, including by increasing cashless payments. Subprograms 1 and 2 (i) \napproved the establishment of the SGF for SMEs; (ii) established the legal and regulatory \nframework for e-payments and mobile financial services; and (iii) established risk management \nand dispute resolution systems for e-payments and mobile financial services. Under subprogram \n3, (i) the government (a) piloted the Internet Payment Gateway project to enable online (noncash) \npayments for key public services (State Registration Service, State Tax Service, State Service of \nIntellectual  Property  and  Innovation,  Mandatory  Health  Insurance  Fund,  Higher  Attestation \nCommission of Kyrgyz Republic, and the State Communications Agency); and (b) operationalized \nthe SGF, issuing 33 guarantees amounting to $1.1 million and catalyzing $5.5 million in bank \nlending for SMEs in priority sectors (exports and agriculture); and (ii) SGF management approved \nthe SGF\u2019s medium-term business strategy (2017\u20132022), with targets for capitalization (Som1.9 \nbillion) and guarantees issued (Som8.5 billion). \n \n19.  Output 2: Public\u2013private partnership program enhanced. This output aims to support \nprivate sector participation in infrastructure and services by bringing bankable PPPs to the market, \nand gradually builds operational experience through pilot projects.23 Subprograms 1 and 2 \nstrengthened the PPP policy, legal and regulatory, institutional, and financial framework for \ndeveloping the country\u2019s PPP program and market (footnote 12), including developing project \nselection criteria, templates for project concept notes, a model concession agreement, and \nguidelines for managing PPP fiscal risks and contingent liabilities. The government\u2019s operational \nexperience is gradually being increased through pilot projects. Under subprogram 3, the \n(i)   Ministry of Health signed a competitively tendered PPP agreement with the private \nsector for the implementation of the Hemodialysis Services Project in Bishkek, Osh, \nand Jalal-Abad (footnote 21);  \n(ii)   government approved the development strategy\u2014Sports for Kyrgyzstan 2018\u2013\n2022\u2014and a multiyear investment plan of the State Agency for Youth Affairs, \nPhysical Culture and submitted project concept notes to the Ministry of Economy \n(MOE)  for  the  Modernization  of  Edelveis  Sports  Base  Project  and  the \nModernization of Small Sports Arena Project;  \n(iii)   Bishkek City Development Agency approved the city development strategy\u2014\nProgram on Economic and Social Development for 2017\u20132020\u2014and a multiyear \ninvestment plan of the Bishkek City Development Agency and submitted project \nconcept notes to MOE for the On-Street Parking Project and Development of Pre-\nschool Organizations (Kindergartens) Project;  \n(iv)   government initiated commissioning prefeasibility studies for five projects\u2014Uzgen \nBypass Road Project (Ministry of Transport and Communication), Customs and \nLogistics Complex  (State  Customs  Services),  Public  Transportation Project \n(Bishkek City Development Agency), On-street Municipal Parking Project; and \nDevelopment of Pre-school Organizations (Kindergartens) Project; and \n(v)   government, in line with PPP legislation, (a) allocated budget funds (including an \nexemption from taxes and other payments) to enable implementation of PPP \nprojects on the request of the concerned public partner (ministry or agency); and \n(b) strengthened fiscal risk management of PPPs by limiting annual budget support \nfor implementation of PPP projects to 0.3%\u20130.5% of the budget. \n \n20.  Output 3: Trade and investment diversified. This output aims to more effectively \nimplement the country\u2019s largely open trade and investment policies. The focus is on dedicated \n                                                \n23 Pilot projects are being developed in health, medical services, roads, tourism, and urban transport.

Subprograms \n1 and 2 helped (i) the country obtain the GSP+ (footnote 15), and its first sovereign credit rating; \n(ii) streamline export and investment facilitation under a single entity (the Investment Promotion \nAgency); (iii) prepare a draft process for addressing investor grievances; and (iv) introduce \nindustry-reviewed TVET curricula in select institutes. Under subprogram 3, (i) the government \nmodernized and operationalized three laboratories to enhance the potential for exports of high-\nvalue and value-added food products to the EU, and trained 30 officials from two key state \nbodies\u2014sanitary epidemiological inspection and veterinary inspection\u2014in hazard analysis and \ncritical control points (HACCP); (ii) MOE approved two guidance manuals (one each for the \napparel and agriculture sectors), which were piloted with at least one exporter from each sector; \n(iii) the government ratified the Trade Facilitation Agreement and operationalized the National \nTrade Facilitation Committee as per the requirements set out in this agreement; (iv) MOE \napproved the action plan to institutionalize an improved investor grievance mechanism, with \nimproved  procedures,  for  out-of-court  settlement  of  investor  disputes,  and  the  Investment \nPromotion  Agency  resolved  two  investor-related  grievances  in  its  current  portfolio;  (v)  the \ngovernment obtained a sovereign credit rating update for 2017 from Moody\u2019s Investors Services, \nand made budget allocations for the 2018 and 2019 rating reviews; and (vi) the Agency for \nVocational Education implemented market-oriented training modules in textile, agriculture and \nfood processing, and manufacturing sectors and trained 100 students (for the academic year \nending  in  May  2017)  under  the  TVET  institutes\u2019  internship  program.  This  intervention  is \ncomplementing ADB\u2019s proposed Skills for Inclusive Growth Sector Development Program which \nis aimed at strengthening technical and vocational education and training in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \n21.  Output 4: Transparency and ease of doing business increased. This output aims to \nincrease transparency in government procurement and ease of doing business by providing \nincentives to businesses to expand and join the formal economy. Subprograms 1 and 2 supported \nimplementation of a government e-procurement system, reduction of the tax burden of businesses, \nand simplification of tax administration. Under subprogram 3, the government (i) allocated Som4 \nmillion in the 2017 annual budget to ensure continued utilization and maintenance of the e-\nprocurement system, and allocated Som8 million to develop additional e-procurement modules; \nand (ii) further reduced tax administrative burdens on small businesses by (a) decreasing the \nsingle tax from 4% to 2% and 6% to 3% for SMEs making cashless payments, and (b) approving \namendments to the Tax Code setting limitations for resolution of taxpayer grievances, and \nrelaxing time limitations on the validity of tax patents. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n22.  The overall program has three subprograms with an estimated funding requirement \nequivalent to $70 million for 2015\u20132017. A grant of $20 million disbursed in 2015 funded \nsubprogram 1, while a loan and grant totaling $25 million equivalent disbursed in 2016 funded \nsubprogram 2. The government has requested a grant not exceeding $25 million from ADB \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance subprogram 3 in 2017 \n(Appendix 3). Subprogram 3 funding will be disbursed in a single tranche upon completion, to \nADB\u2019s satisfaction, of all the policy actions set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4).24 \n \n                                                \n24 ADB has agreed with the government to withhold $407,960 from the subprogram 3 disbursal pending agreement \nbetween ADB and the government on the aggregate amount of acceptable expenditures financed under Grant0121-\nKGZ: Investment Climate Improvement Program System Support Project.  Upon reaching such agreement, ADB will \ndisburse the balance (if any) to the government before the grant closing date. ", "8 \n23.  The size of subprogram 3 is based on the government\u2019s development financing needs, \nthe nature of the required reforms, and the development impact. The 2017 development-related \nfinancing gap is about $320.7 million, up 1% from 2016.25 The fiscal deficit is projected at 4.7% \nof GDP in 2017. The gap will be met mainly by long-term loans from foreign sources (projected \nat $109.9 million) and budget support expected from ADB ($29.0 million), the World Bank ($24.0 \nmillion), IMF ($26.0 million), and EU and other development partners ($37.9 million) (footnote 19). \nIn addition, there is expected budget support of $32 million from the Russian Federation. \nRevenues from proposed privatization ($2 million) and government bonds will fill the remaining \ngap. ADB\u2019s subprogram 3 will help narrow the financing gap by about 7.8% in 2017. Budget \nsupport is necessary to finance part of the development financing needs projected for the period \ncovering subprogram 3 (2016\u20132017).26 Specific elements of the government\u2019s development \nexpenditure  program  supported  by  counterpart  funds  of  ADB\u2019s  budget  support  include \nexpenditures needed to (i) develop new infrastructure and rehabilitate existing assets, along with \noverall sector reforms to take advantage of private sector expertise and investments; and (ii) \ndevelop agriculture value chains, including product quality assurance infrastructure and related \ntraining and services, to capitalize on EEU market and the GSP+ trade privileges.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  The executing agency (MOE) will oversee and coordinate timely implementation of the \npolicy actions. The implementing agencies\u2014MOE, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the \nNBKR\u2014are  responsible  for  completing  their  respective  subprogram  3  policy  actions.  The \ngovernment has effectively implemented reforms, including under the first Investment Climate \nImprovement Program (footnote 23), and policy-based programs with other development partners. \nTwo technical assistance projects support subprogram 3 implementation.27 All subprogram 3 \npolicy actions were completed by 31 October 2017. The proceeds of the policy-based grant will \nbe disbursed in accordance with the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from \ntime to time). Proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items, excluding items \non the list of ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.28 \nImplementation is expected to be completed by 30 November 2017.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The reforms supported by the program entail (i) short-term direct and indirect costs to the \ngovernment to implement and monitor reforms, and (ii) fiscal benefits in the form of increased \nrevenues from greater and diversified economic activities. Indirect costs are staff time and \nadministrative expenses. Direct costs include the costs associated with capitalizing the SGF and \nimplementing pilot Internet Payment Gateway in key government agencies; government funding \nto develop and implement infrastructure PPP projects and develop product quality certification \ninfrastructure for trade; and sovereign ratings reviews. Key economic benefits will be (i) an \nincrease in labor force participation by women in the formal economy as a result of broader access \nto e-payments for public services and digital financial services; (ii) expanded access to credit for \nthe private sector through guarantee facilities, as well as an increase in the volume of money in \nthe banking system; (iii) financial savings and efficiency gains from improved public investment \n                                                \n25 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, Ministry of Finance. 2016.

Higher expenditures are imperative, necessitating budget support (para. 22).  \n \nB.  Governance \n26.  Public financial management risks are high.29 Budget processes are being improved with \nmultidonor  support.  Integration  of  the  public  procurement  web  portal  with  the  automated \ninformation system Kazna Budzhet is enabling consistency of budgetary obligations to fiscal year \nappropriations. Since 1 January 2017, the central treasury is a direct participant in the interbank \npayment system, with the Unified Treasury Account functioning as the centralized account of all \nbudgets. The World Bank supports strengthening the quality of audits and financial reporting \ncapacity  of  state-owned  enterprises.30 Based  on  the  lessons  learned  from  implementing \nGrant0121-KGZ:  Investment  Climate  Improvement  Program  System  Support  Project  that \nsupported the first Investment Climate Improvement Program, 2008\u20132012 (footnote 26), ADB and \nthe government have also agreed on an action plan to strengthen the internal control environment \nand procurement and project management capacity of MOE, MOF and other concerned ministries \nand agencies. They have also agreed to implement the action plan within six months from the \ndate of the grant agreement for subprogram 3. Streamlined tax regulations, lower tax rates, and \nthe automation of tax filing (supported under output 4) are reducing the cost of compliance and \nrent-seeking opportunities of tax collection officials. The ADB Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOE.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Better access to finance, diversified trade and investment, improved public infrastructure, \nand reduced costs of doing business will stimulate private sector activity. Growth and innovation \nin existing and emergence of new enterprises will create more and higher value-added jobs. \nImproved public infrastructure and services will directly benefit the poor and vulnerable, as will \nthe  expansion  of  mobile  and  e-payments.  Subprogram  3,  categorized  effective  gender \nmainstreaming,  will  address  the  insufficient  representation  of  women  in  economic  policy \ndevelopment and implementation, and unequal access to assets and resources. SMEs, including \nthose owned or managed by women, will be supported by the SGF. In addition to financial \nservices, dedicated business development support will be provided to these SMEs to help them \ncapitalize on EEU and GSP+ export opportunities and become part of global value chains. Key \nimplementing agencies under the program, including the MOE and MOF, are hiring women to \nensure  an  appropriate  gender  balance  in  key  technical  positions,  and  to  ensure  women\u2019s \nparticipation in training in the new, expanding technical fields of PPPs and HACCP. Infrastructure \nPPP projects with positive poverty and gender impacts are being prioritized. The market-linked \nTVET programs will aim to provide 45% of jobs and internships to women. Reducing taxes and \ntax compliance requirements will encourage unregistered businesses, many of which are owned \nby women, to enter the formal economy. \n                                                \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30  World Bank.
