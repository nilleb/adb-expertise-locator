Recovery of the gold sector, an increase in private consumption fueled \nby  increased remittances  resulting from  easier  access to  the  Eurasian  Economic  Union  (EEU) \nlabor  markets, 4  and  government  spending  helped  offset  a  slowdown  in  manufacturing,  the \nspillover effect of the recession in the Russian Federation, and slower growth in the Republic of \nKazakhstan.  In  2016,  overall  exports  increased  by  4.8%\u2014exports  to  EEU  member  countries \nincreased by 4.3%,5 and exports to other main markets by 5.3%. Imports declined by 5.7%, mainly \nas a result of lower energy imports and weak domestic demand. The 2016 fiscal deficit increased \nto 4.5% of GDP from 3% in 2015, fueled by a shortfall in tax revenue. However, appreciation of \nthe  Som,  restrained  spending  on  nonpriority  items,  and  the  rephasing  of  externally  financed \ninvestment projects limited the increase in the fiscal deficit. Public debt increased by $300 million \nin 2016, with the ratio of public debt to GDP at about the legal threshold of 60% of GDP.6 The de-\ndollarization policy actions of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) led to a sharp \ndecline  in  dollarization  levels.  From  2015  to  2016,  the  proportion  of  deposits  held  in  dollars \ndeclined by 15.7% to 56.2%, while the proportion of loans denominated in dollars fell by 12.2% to \n44.1%. GDP growth is expected to slow slightly to 3.5% in 2017 before accelerating to 4.3% in \n2018.  However,  slow  growth  is  expected  in  regional  economies7,  and  the  Kyrgyz  economy  is \nexpected to remain on a lower-growth trajectory because its links with these economies through \nremittances, trade, and foreign investment channels.  \n \n4. \nSince 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working with the government \nto support one of the key priorities of the country\u2019s National Sustainable Development Strategy, \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The proposed subprogram 3 is included in ADB. 2013.

Subprogram 1 \nwas approved on 17 June 2015, and Subprogram 2 on 29 July 2016. \n\n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction technical assistance for the Second Investment Climate \n\nImprovement Program.  \n\n4  In 2016 remittances increased by 21.6% from 2015 levels, and totaled $1.6 billion, but remain below pre-crisis levels. \n\nRemittances constituted about 30% of GDP in 2016. \n\n5  In 2016, the share of exports to the EEU comprised about 26% of the country\u2019s total exports.  \n6  The legislation allowing the government to review the debt threshold level on an annual basis came into force in \nJanuary 2017, effectively removing the administrative constraint for government debt to be capped at 60% of GDP. \n7  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. May 2017. Regional Economic Prospects in EBRD Countries \n\nof Operations.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n2013\u20132017,  to  decrease  the  country\u2019s  dependence  on  natural  resource  exploitation  and \nmigration-led  remittances  by  improving  the  investment  climate  and  supporting  private  sector \ndevelopment. 8  Past  and  ongoing  ADB  assistance  (footnote  2)  has  contributed  to  progress \nincluding  growing  private  sector  contributions  to  diversified  and  sustainable  economic  growth. \nSince  investment  climate  improvement  reforms  are  a  process  requiring  continuous  support,9 \nsubprogram 3 of the Second Investment Climate Improvement Program (Second ICIP) focuses \non the remaining policy and institutional reforms, as well as their implementation, necessary to (i) \nfurther  expand  access  to  financial  services,  (ii)  improve  physical  infrastructure  and  services \ndelivery, (iii) diversify trade and investment away from commodities, (iv) align workforce skills with \nthe needs of employers, and (v) reduce corruption and the cost of doing business.  \n\n \n5. \nInadequate  access  to  financial  services.  The  level  of  financial  intermediation  has \nimproved significantly, with the share of loans to GDP increasing from 27.1% in 2015 to 38.9% in \n2016. SMEs contributed about 40% of GDP in 2016,10 13% of total exports in 2015, and about \n19% of total employment in 2015. However, the use of suitable products and services by SMEs \nis constrained by high bank lending interest rates (with a weighted average of 18.2%, and 22.0% \nfor Som-denominated loans) and high collateral requirements (120%\u2013200% of the loan amount). \nThis  prevents  SMEs  from  contributing  to  economic  growth  in  the  formal  sector  and  creating \ndiversified  and  high  value-added  jobs. To  meet  SME  financing  needs  and  reduce  reliance  on \ncollateral-based lending, credit guarantee mechanisms should be expanded to increase access \nto bank financing. The failure of the banking sector to effectively capture remittances (footnote 4) \nreduces the size of the deposit base that could otherwise be used for long-term SME financing. \nLending processes are underdeveloped, with a greater focus on collateral-based lending than on \nbusiness cash flows. Access to finance for those who are underbanked\u2014 particularly women and \nrural and remote populations\u2014is impaired by the weak payment infrastructure, including mobile \nbanking, and low levels of financial literacy. The move to an e-economy and greater use of mobile \nfinancial  services  can  lower  the  cost  of  financial  intermediation  and  expand  outreach  to  new \ncustomers  (especially  in  rural  areas),  women,  and  marginalized  groups,  thus  helping  them  to \nengage  in  productive  economic  activities.  Addressing  these  issues  can  help  increase  funding \nopportunities for the private sector and broaden private sector access to finance. \n \n6. \nHigh  infrastructure  and  service  needs.  Substantial  investments  and  expertise, \nparticularly  from  the  private  sector,  are  needed  to  develop  critical  economic  and  social \ninfrastructure  and  services  to  facilitate  private  sector  activity.  Progress  has  been  made  in \ndeveloping the policy, legal and regulatory, institutional, and financial enabling environment for \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs).11 Further strengthening is needed to build an effective PPP \nprogram and crowd-in private sector expertise and investments. Dedicated financing for project \npreparation  and  advisory  services,  and  improved  knowledge  and  technical  capacity  of  key \ngovernment ministries and agencies will help prepare bankable projects and bring private sector \nparticipation, including through PPP transactions. The government needs to improve its capacity \n\n                                                 \n8  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, National Council for Sustainable Development of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013. \n\nNational Sustainable Development Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic 2013\u20132017. Bishkek. \n\n9  Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 SMEs are broadly distributed among the trade sector (26%), real estate sector (24%), transport and communications \n(9%), production sector (14%), construction sector (10%), and others (17%). As of the end of 2015, 795 of the 14,027 \nSMEs could be classified as medium-sized. In addition, there are more than 366,000 individual entrepreneurs and \n400,700 peasant farms. \n\n11 ADB.  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Strengthening  the  Enabling  Environment  for  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships.  Achievements \ninclude the PPP law and regulations assigning roles for the Ministry of Economy (coordination), Ministry of Finance \n(risk management), and line ministries (project initiation and development); establishment of the Project Development \nSupport  Facility  for  project  preparation  advisory  and  structuring;  and  a  pipeline  of  13  projects.  The  technical \nassistance supports output 2 of the program.  \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nto plan, regulate, execute, and oversee PPP projects; and increase private investor confidence \nthrough  proper  allocation  of  risk  and  reward  incentives  for  investors,  and  by  executing \ndemonstration projects (footnote 12). Given the early stage of PPP market development in the \ncountry  and  the  absence  of  long-term  finance,  continued  government  support  through  risk \nparticipation is needed to ensure the viability and affordability of PPP projects. Experience in well-\ndeveloped markets indicates that at least 5 years is required to bring the first PPP projects to the \nmarket and reach contract awards. \n \nUndiversified  trade  and  investment.  The  country\u2019s  trade  and  FDI  policies  support \n7. \nmarket openness, as indicated by the improvement in the trade-to-GDP ratio, from 95% in 2005 \nto 110% in 2015.12 However, exports\u2014which increased by 4.8% in 2016\u2014remain concentrated, \nboth with respect to destinations (with Switzerland accounting for 34.0%, Kazakhstan for 17.8%, \nthe Russian Federation for 9.0%, and Uzbekistan for 8.1%) and product (gold and other minerals \naccount for 34%). FDI is focused on a few capital-intensive investments in mining and energy, \nwith minimal technology and skills transfer, or links with the local economy.13 Diversification of the \nexport  base  and  FDI,  and  realization  of  the  intended  benefits  of  EEU  accession  and  the \nGeneralized  System  of  Preferences  Plus  (GSP+)  trade  privilege  of  the  European  Union  (EU), \nrequire  substantial  improvements  in  customs  infrastructure  and  logistics,  infrastructure,  and \ntechnical  expertise. 14 These  improvements  are  critical  to  implement  product  standardization, \nmetrology, and accreditation, and harmonization with the EEU. FDI expansion and diversification \nwill  also  require  addressing  risks  related  to  disputes  with  foreign  investors.  In  most  disputes \nbetween  foreign  investors  and  the  government,  the  Kyrgyz  judicial  system  fails  to  act  as  an \nindependent arbiter.15 A transparent investor dispute resolution mechanism will provide for out-of-\ncourt settlements, thereby avoiding protracted and costly litigation, and renegotiation of contracts. \n  \n8. \nIndustry\u2013labor market skills mismatch. Potential employees lack the skills needed for \nemployment in the private sector, particularly in the agri-industrial, energy, mining, transport and \ncommunications,  tourism  and  services,  and  manufacturing  and  logistics  sectors.  A  skilled \nworkforce  is  needed  to  increase  productivity  and  accelerate  private  sector  development,  and \nthereby  expand  opportunities  for  better-paid  jobs  and  higher  incomes.    Industry  sector  skills \ncouncils have been operationalized to support better interaction between technical and vocational \neducation  and  training  (TVET)  and  the  labor  market.  However,  occupational  standards  and \ncompetence-based learning content need further improvement, as they are not streamlined and \ninstitutionalized to ensure that TVET curricula meet the needs of private enterprises.16  \n \n9. \nWeak  governance  and  high  cost  of  doing  business.  Real  and  perceived  corruption \nremains  a  key  obstacle  for  doing  business.  Public  service  delivery  lacks  transparency, \naccountability, and efficiency. The high costs of compliance with government regulations and high \nprofit  tax  rates  impair  private  sector  development.  The  move  to  government  e-procurement \nsystems and tax administration reforms will help reduce compliance costs and provide incentives \nfor formalization of businesses. \n\n                                                 \n12 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. 2016. Investment Policy Review: Kyrgyzstan. Geneva. \n13 In 2016, FDI was concentrated in manufacturing (31%) and power generation (15%), dwarfing mining (7%). The top \n\ninvestors were from the People\u2019s Republic of China, Canada, and the Russian Federation. \n\n14 GSP+ is a trade privilege granted by the EU to a few countries to help diversify their economies. It eliminates or sets \nhighly preferential tariffs for more than 7,000 product exports from these countries. The countries are required to \nratify and implement international conventions on human and labor rights, environment, and good governance. \n\n15 The country is a member of the (i) 1958 New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral \nAwards since March 1997, and (ii) International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes since July 1997.  \n16 One of the key objectives of the Education Development Strategy 2012-2020 of the government is to ensure greater \ntraining. \n\nvocational \n\neducation \n\nskills \n\nand \n\nand \n\nand \n\nsynergy \nlabor  market \nhttp://www.globalpartnership.org/fr/download/file/fid/44406.  \n\nbetween \n\nneeds \n\n\f4 \n\nGovernment  efforts.  The  State  Guarantee  Fund  (SGF)  has  been  in  operation  since \n10. \nNovember  2016,  and  has  leveraged  Som125  million  ($1.1  million)  in  guarantees  to  provide \nSom520 million ($5.5 million) in bank lending. Risk-based supervision of microfinance institutions \nis also helping reduce the risk of lending to SMEs. To reduce the share of cash circulating in the \neconomy,  all  public  sector  salaries  are  paid  through  local  payment  cards.  Social  benefits \npayments  through  cards  have  increased  from  9.3%  (2015)  to  13.0%  (2016)  and  pensions \npayments through cards have increased from 38.4% (2015) to 43.0% (2016). SMEs receive tax \nincentives for using noncash transactions. The NBKR\u2019s strengthened regulations are increasing \nservice offerings through electronic payment transactions, payment cards, ATMs, and point-of-\nsale terminals. As of the first quarter of 2017, the volume of payment card transactions totaled \nSom38  million,  an  increase  of  a  46.1%  over  the  first  quarter  of  2016.  More  than  6.2  million \npayment  card  transactions  had  been  executed  as  of  31  March  2017,  an  increase  of  12.2% \ncompared with the same period in 2016. Greater access to electronic payments tends to increase \nthe number of transactions rather than the value of each transaction, indicating improving financial \nservices  for  small  transactions.  Comprehensive  PPP  project  development  and  transaction \nadvisory  and  government  financial  support  have  resulted  in  10  projects  at  various  stages  of \npreparation. Amendments to the Law on Investment have improved investor protection.  \n \n11. \nDevelopment  coordination.  Key  development  partners  are  supporting  government \nefforts  to  improve  the  investment  climate  and  ADB\u2019s  program  is  closely  coordinated  with \ndevelopment partners\u2019 interventions.17 The Extended Credit Facility of the International Monetary \nFund (IMF) was approved in April 2015, and the combined fourth and fifth reviews is expected for \nconsideration  by  the  IMF  Board  in  December  2017. 18  The  Facility  supports  fiscal  and  debt \nsustainability  and  finance  sector  stability.  The World  Bank  supports  reforms  in  public  financial \naccounting  and  audit.  The  International  Finance  Corporation  assists  in  improving  the  foreign \ninvestment  policy  and  related  laws,  and  agribusiness  regulations,  as  well  as  providing  PPP \ntransaction  advisory  services.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  helps \nimprove the competitiveness of textile, tourism, and construction sectors. The Japan International \nCooperation  Agency,  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  German \nInternationale \ndevelopment  cooperation \nZusammenarbeit are supporting SMEs and private sector development, and PPPs. \n \nADB  value  addition.  Continued  ADB  engagement  has  motivated  the  government  to \n12. \ncomplete several ambitious reforms that it might not have undertaken otherwise. ADB advised \nthe  government  to  expedite  the  piloting  of  electronic  and  mobile  financial  services,  in  key \ngovernment agencies which deal with public services. This is helping expand financial services \nto the currently underbanked (mainly the poor and women) and gradually reduced the size of the \ninformal  economy  by  increasing  electronic  and  mobile  transactions  through  the  banks.  ADB\u2019s \ntechnical  advice  on  the  establishment  of  the  SGF  and  initial  capitalization  of  $1  million  has \nenabled  the  government  to  channel  its  support  for  SMEs  through  the  more  effective  SGF \nmechanism  rather  than  as  direct  interest  rate  subsidies.  The  SGF  mechanism  has  brought \nsubstantial value for money for the government\u2014catalyzing nearly $5.5 million in bank lending \nthrough $1.1 million of guarantees. The success of the SGF has also resulted in the Russian\u2013\n\nthrough  KfW  and  Deutsche  Gesellschaft \n\nf\u00fcr \n\n                                                 \n17 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 The  Second  Investment  Climate  Improvement  Program  has  been  coordinated  closely  with  the  IMF  through \ndiscussions during missions as well as through the Kyrgyz resident mission. The IMF staff has completed its country \nvisit for the  combined  fourth  and  fifth  reviews  under  the  Extended  Credit Facility  on  8  November 2017  and  have \nreached an agreement with the authorities on the next steps, including the prior conditions for consideration of the \nreviews by the IMF Board in December 2017. The IMF is expected to disburse its fourth and fifth tranches after the \npending conditions are met. The ADB program complements the IMF program which also stresses the need to further \nimprove the country\u2019s investment climate. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nto  provide  additional  capitalization  of \nin-principle \nKyrgyz  Development  Fund  agreeing \napproximately $1.5 million. ADB\u2019s advisory on PPPs has helped the government develop its PPP \npolicy, legal, institutional, and financial framework in line with international good practice and a \npipeline of 15 projects, in addition to the first PPP contract awarded in August 2017.19 Continuous \nengagement and guidance has enabled the country to reap the benefits of the EU\u2019s GSP+ trade \nprivilege (footnote 17) in a relatively short time\u2014exports to the EU have increased by 53.4% (from \n$20.1  million  in  2015  to  $66.7  million  in  the  first  11  months  of  2016),  and  helped  maintain  its \nsovereign credit rating (B2 Stable) obtained from Moody\u2019s Investors Service in December 2015,20 \nenabling  investors  and  lenders  to  better  price  country  risks  and  open  avenues  to  diversify  the \ncountry\u2019s funding sources.  \n\n \nLessons. The key lessons from past interventions21\u2014that activity-oriented policy actions \n13. \nand  sustained  engagement  with  the  government  yield  substantive  results\u2014have  been \nincorporated  into  subprogram  3.  The  implementation  of  the  Investment  Climate  Improvement \nProgram System Support Project has also shown that the procurement and project management \ncapacities  as  well  as  internal  control  environments  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies \nshould be strengthened to ensure effective utilization of public resources (para 26).  \n \n14. \nAlignment with ADB\u2019s strategy. The overall program, including subprogram 3, is aligned \nwith the country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 and the Strategy 2020 midterm review,22 and \nincluded in the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019. The new government, elected in \nOctober 2017, also supports investment climate improvement reforms including support provided \nby ADB under the Second Investment Climate Improvement Program.    \n\n \nProgrammatic approach. The Second ICIP is a programmatic approach with a results \n15. \norientation. Upstream policy and institutional reforms are followed by downstream implementation. \nFour outputs are being delivered through a package of reforms phased over three subprograms \nin  a  manner  that  allows  each  subprogram  to  build  on  the  progress  of  the  previous  one  and \nincorporate changes as necessitated by the evolving economic environment. The approach helps \nensure that the reforms are effectively implemented, and not confined to enactment of laws and \nregulations. Subprogram 3 builds on and complements the achievements under subprograms 1 \nand 2 (paras. 18\u201321). \n \nB. \n\n  \nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be increased private sector investment in the economy. The outcome will \n\n16. \nbe an improved business and investment climate in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nSubprogram  3  continues  the  reforms  under  subprograms  1  and  2  in  four  output  areas \n17. \n(paras.  18\u201321).  All  policy  actions  completed  under  subprograms 1  and  2  remain  intact; the  15 \nsubprogram 3 policy actions have helped the overall program make substantive achievements.   \n \n \n\n                                                 \n19 The contract is for the provision of hemodialysis services in Bishkek, Osh, and Jalal-Abad.

This output aims to increase access to finance \n18. \nby reducing the risks of lending to SMEs, and increasing the access of the underbanked to the \nformal  financial  system,  including  by  increasing  cashless  payments.  Subprograms  1  and  2  (i) \napproved  the  establishment  of  the  SGF  for  SMEs;  (ii)  established  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework for e-payments and mobile financial services; and (iii) established risk management \nand dispute resolution systems for e-payments and mobile financial services. Under subprogram \n3, (i) the government (a) piloted the Internet Payment Gateway project to enable online (noncash) \npayments for key public services (State Registration Service, State Tax Service, State Service of \nIntellectual  Property  and  Innovation,  Mandatory  Health  Insurance  Fund,  Higher  Attestation \nCommission of Kyrgyz Republic, and the State Communications Agency); and (b) operationalized \nthe  SGF,  issuing  33  guarantees  amounting  to  $1.1  million  and  catalyzing  $5.5  million  in  bank \nlending for SMEs in priority sectors (exports and agriculture); and (ii) SGF management approved \nthe SGF\u2019s medium-term business strategy (2017\u20132022), with targets for capitalization (Som1.9 \nbillion) and guarantees issued (Som8.5 billion). \n \n19. \nOutput 2: Public\u2013private partnership program enhanced. This output aims to support \nprivate sector participation in infrastructure and services by bringing bankable PPPs to the market, \nand  gradually  builds  operational  experience  through  pilot  projects. 23  Subprograms  1  and  2 \nstrengthened  the  PPP  policy,  legal  and  regulatory,  institutional,  and  financial  framework  for \ndeveloping  the  country\u2019s  PPP  program  and  market  (footnote  12),  including  developing  project \nselection  criteria,  templates  for  project  concept  notes,  a  model  concession  agreement,  and \nguidelines for managing PPP fiscal risks and contingent liabilities. The government\u2019s operational \nexperience is gradually being increased through pilot projects. Under subprogram 3, the \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\n(iv)  \n\n(v)  \n\nMinistry of Health signed a competitively tendered PPP agreement with the private \nsector for the implementation of the Hemodialysis Services Project in Bishkek, Osh, \nand Jalal-Abad (footnote 21);  \ngovernment  approved  the  development  strategy\u2014Sports  for  Kyrgyzstan  2018\u2013\n2022\u2014and  a  multiyear  investment  plan  of  the  State  Agency  for  Youth  Affairs, \nPhysical Culture and submitted project concept notes to the Ministry of Economy \n(MOE)  for  the  Modernization  of  Edelveis  Sports  Base  Project  and  the \nModernization of Small Sports Arena Project;  \nBishkek  City  Development  Agency  approved  the  city  development  strategy\u2014\nProgram on Economic and Social Development for 2017\u20132020\u2014and a multiyear \ninvestment plan of the Bishkek City Development Agency and submitted project \nconcept notes to MOE for the On-Street Parking Project and Development of Pre-\nschool Organizations (Kindergartens) Project;  \ngovernment initiated commissioning prefeasibility studies for five projects\u2014Uzgen \nBypass  Road  Project  (Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communication),  Customs  and \nLogistics Complex  (State  Customs  Services),  Public  Transportation Project \n(Bishkek  City  Development  Agency),  On-street  Municipal  Parking  Project;  and \nDevelopment of Pre-school Organizations (Kindergartens) Project; and \ngovernment, in line with PPP legislation, (a) allocated budget funds (including an \nexemption  from  taxes  and  other  payments)  to  enable  implementation  of  PPP \nprojects on the request of the concerned public partner (ministry or agency); and \n(b) strengthened fiscal risk management of PPPs by limiting annual budget support \nfor implementation of PPP projects to 0.3%\u20130.5% of the budget. \n\n \n20. \nOutput  3:  Trade  and  investment  diversified.  This  output  aims  to  more  effectively \nimplement the country\u2019s largely open trade and investment policies. The focus is on dedicated \n\n                                                 \n23 Pilot projects are being developed in health, medical services, roads, tourism, and urban transport.  \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\ntrade and investment facilitation services for Kyrgyz exporters and prospective foreign investors; \ndeveloping national product quality infrastructure (standardization, metrology, and accreditation); \naddressing investors\u2019 grievances; and aligning workers\u2019 skills with market demand. Subprograms \n1 and 2 helped (i) the country obtain the GSP+ (footnote 15), and its first sovereign credit rating; \n(ii) streamline export and investment facilitation under a single entity (the Investment Promotion \nAgency);  (iii)  prepare  a  draft  process  for  addressing  investor  grievances;  and  (iv)  introduce \nindustry-reviewed  TVET  curricula  in  select  institutes.  Under  subprogram  3,  (i)  the  government \nmodernized and operationalized three laboratories to enhance the potential for exports of high-\nvalue  and  value-added  food  products  to  the  EU,  and  trained  30  officials  from  two  key  state \nbodies\u2014sanitary  epidemiological  inspection  and veterinary  inspection\u2014in  hazard  analysis  and \ncritical  control  points  (HACCP);  (ii)  MOE  approved  two  guidance  manuals  (one  each  for  the \napparel and agriculture sectors), which were piloted with at least one exporter from each sector; \n(iii)  the  government  ratified  the  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  and  operationalized  the  National \nTrade  Facilitation  Committee  as  per  the  requirements  set  out  in  this  agreement;  (iv)  MOE \napproved  the  action  plan  to  institutionalize  an  improved  investor  grievance  mechanism,  with \nimproved  procedures,  for  out-of-court  settlement  of  investor  disputes,  and  the  Investment \nPromotion  Agency  resolved  two  investor-related  grievances  in  its  current  portfolio;  (v)  the \ngovernment obtained a sovereign credit rating update for 2017 from Moody\u2019s Investors Services, \nand  made  budget  allocations  for  the  2018  and  2019  rating  reviews;  and  (vi)  the  Agency  for \nVocational  Education  implemented  market-oriented  training  modules  in  textile,  agriculture  and \nfood  processing,  and  manufacturing  sectors  and  trained  100  students  (for  the  academic  year \nending  in  May  2017)  under  the  TVET  institutes\u2019  internship  program.  This  intervention  is \ncomplementing ADB\u2019s proposed Skills for Inclusive Growth Sector Development Program which \nis aimed at strengthening technical and vocational education and training in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \n21. \nOutput 4: Transparency and ease of doing business increased. This output aims to \nincrease  transparency  in  government  procurement  and  ease  of  doing  business  by  providing \nincentives to businesses to expand and join the formal economy. Subprograms 1 and 2 supported \nimplementation of a government e-procurement system, reduction of the tax burden of businesses, \nand simplification of tax administration. Under subprogram 3, the government (i) allocated Som4 \nmillion  in  the  2017  annual  budget  to  ensure  continued  utilization  and  maintenance  of  the  e-\nprocurement system, and allocated Som8 million to develop additional e-procurement modules; \nand  (ii)  further  reduced  tax  administrative  burdens  on  small  businesses  by  (a)  decreasing  the \nsingle tax from 4% to 2% and 6% to 3% for SMEs making cashless payments, and (b) approving \namendments  to  the  Tax  Code  setting  limitations  for  resolution  of  taxpayer  grievances,  and \nrelaxing time limitations on the validity of tax patents. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n22. \nThe  overall  program  has  three  subprograms  with  an  estimated  funding  requirement \nequivalent  to  $70  million  for  2015\u20132017.  A  grant  of  $20  million  disbursed  in  2015  funded \nsubprogram 1, while a loan and grant totaling $25 million equivalent disbursed in 2016 funded \nsubprogram  2.  The  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $25  million  from  ADB \nSpecial  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  subprogram  3  in  2017 \n(Appendix  3).  Subprogram  3 funding  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single tranche  upon completion, to \nADB\u2019s satisfaction, of all the policy actions set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4).24 \n \n                                                 \n24 ADB has agreed with the government to withhold $407,960 from the subprogram 3 disbursal pending agreement \nbetween ADB and the government on the aggregate amount of acceptable expenditures financed under Grant0121-\nKGZ: Investment Climate Improvement Program System Support Project.  Upon reaching such agreement, ADB will \ndisburse the balance (if any) to the government before the grant closing date. \n\n\f8 \n\nThe size of subprogram 3 is based on the government\u2019s development financing needs, \n23. \nthe nature of the required reforms, and the development impact. The 2017 development-related \nfinancing gap is about $320.7 million, up 1% from 2016.25 The fiscal deficit is projected at 4.7% \nof GDP in 2017. The gap will be met mainly by long-term loans from foreign sources (projected \nat $109.9 million) and budget support expected from ADB ($29.0 million), the World Bank ($24.0 \nmillion), IMF ($26.0 million), and EU and other development partners ($37.9 million) (footnote 19). \nIn  addition,  there  is  expected  budget  support  of  $32  million  from  the  Russian  Federation. \nRevenues from proposed privatization ($2 million) and government bonds will fill the remaining \ngap.  ADB\u2019s  subprogram  3  will  help  narrow  the  financing  gap  by  about  7.8%  in  2017.  Budget \nsupport is necessary to finance part of the development financing needs projected for the period \ncovering  subprogram  3  (2016\u20132017). 26  Specific  elements  of  the  government\u2019s  development \nexpenditure  program  supported  by  counterpart  funds  of  ADB\u2019s  budget  support  include \nexpenditures needed to (i) develop new infrastructure and rehabilitate existing assets, along with \noverall  sector  reforms  to  take  advantage  of  private  sector  expertise  and  investments;  and  (ii) \ndevelop agriculture value chains, including product quality assurance infrastructure and related \ntraining and services, to capitalize on EEU market and the GSP+ trade privileges.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n24. \nThe  executing  agency  (MOE)  will  oversee  and  coordinate  timely  implementation  of  the \npolicy  actions.  The  implementing  agencies\u2014MOE,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  and  the \nNBKR\u2014are  responsible  for  completing  their  respective  subprogram  3  policy  actions.  The \ngovernment  has  effectively  implemented  reforms,  including  under  the  first  Investment  Climate \nImprovement Program (footnote 23), and policy-based programs with other development partners. \nTwo  technical  assistance  projects  support  subprogram  3  implementation.27 All  subprogram  3 \npolicy actions were completed by 31 October 2017. The proceeds of the policy-based grant will \nbe disbursed in accordance with the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from \ntime to time). Proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items, excluding items \non the list of ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.28 \nImplementation is expected to be completed by 30 November 2017.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nThe reforms supported by the program entail (i) short-term direct and indirect costs to the \ngovernment  to  implement  and  monitor  reforms, and  (ii) fiscal  benefits  in  the form  of  increased \nrevenues  from  greater  and  diversified  economic  activities.  Indirect  costs  are  staff  time  and \nadministrative expenses. Direct costs include the costs associated with capitalizing the SGF and \nimplementing pilot Internet Payment Gateway in key government agencies; government funding \nto  develop  and  implement  infrastructure  PPP  projects  and  develop  product quality  certification \ninfrastructure  for  trade;  and  sovereign  ratings  reviews.  Key  economic  benefits  will  be  (i)  an \nincrease in labor force participation by women in the formal economy as a result of broader access \nto e-payments for public services and digital financial services; (ii) expanded access to credit for \nthe private sector through guarantee facilities, as well as an increase in the volume of money in \nthe banking system; (iii) financial savings and efficiency gains from improved public investment \n\n                                                 \n25 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, Ministry of Finance. 2016.

Higher expenditures are imperative, necessitating budget support (para. 22).  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nPublic financial management risks are high.29 Budget processes are being improved with \n26. \nmultidonor  support.  Integration  of  the  public  procurement  web  portal  with  the  automated \ninformation system Kazna Budzhet is enabling consistency of budgetary obligations to fiscal year \nappropriations. Since 1 January 2017, the central treasury is a direct participant in the interbank \npayment system, with the Unified Treasury Account functioning as the centralized account of all \nbudgets.  The  World  Bank  supports  strengthening  the  quality  of  audits  and  financial  reporting \ncapacity  of  state-owned  enterprises. 30  Based  on  the  lessons  learned  from  implementing \nGrant0121-KGZ:  Investment  Climate  Improvement  Program  System  Support  Project  that \nsupported the first Investment Climate Improvement Program, 2008\u20132012 (footnote 26), ADB and \nthe government have also agreed on an action plan to strengthen the internal control environment \nand procurement and project management capacity of MOE, MOF and other concerned ministries \nand agencies. They have also agreed to implement the action plan within six months from the \ndate of the grant agreement for subprogram 3. Streamlined tax regulations, lower tax rates, and \nthe automation of tax filing (supported under output 4) are reducing the cost of compliance and \nrent-seeking  opportunities  of  tax  collection  officials.  The  ADB  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOE.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nBetter access to finance, diversified trade and investment, improved public infrastructure, \nand reduced costs of doing business will stimulate private sector activity. Growth and innovation \nin  existing  and  emergence  of  new  enterprises  will  create  more  and  higher  value-added  jobs. \nImproved public infrastructure and services will directly benefit the poor and vulnerable, as will \nthe  expansion  of  mobile  and  e-payments.  Subprogram  3,  categorized  effective  gender \nmainstreaming,  will  address  the  insufficient  representation  of  women  in  economic  policy \ndevelopment and implementation, and unequal access to assets and resources. SMEs, including \nthose  owned  or  managed  by  women,  will  be  supported  by  the  SGF.  In  addition  to  financial \nservices, dedicated business development support will be provided to these SMEs to help them \ncapitalize on EEU and GSP+ export opportunities and become part of global value chains. Key \nimplementing  agencies under  the  program,  including the  MOE  and  MOF,  are  hiring  women  to \nensure  an  appropriate  gender  balance  in  key  technical  positions,  and  to  ensure  women\u2019s \nparticipation in training in the new, expanding technical fields of PPPs and HACCP. Infrastructure \nPPP projects with positive poverty and gender impacts are being prioritized. The market-linked \nTVET programs will aim to provide 45% of jobs and internships to women. Reducing taxes and \ntax compliance requirements will encourage unregistered businesses, many of which are owned \nby women, to enter the formal economy. \n\n                                                 \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30  World Bank.

Safeguards categorization for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples are all C, in accordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n29.  Major risks and mitigation measures are summarized in the table and detailed in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan (footnote 31). The benefits and impacts of subprogram 3 \nare expected to outweigh the costs and mitigate risks. \n \n\nSummary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nCompliance requirements for EEU regulations could \ndelay unrelated reforms and heighten the negative \neffects of slow growth in major trade and investment \npartners (Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation). \nWeak public financial management systems adversely \nimpact budget planning and execution, and transparency \nand accountability.  \n\nWeak internal rules and entrenched public procurement \npractices bear significant risks of fraud and abuse of \nfunds. \n\nCorruption and weak implementation of laws\u2014including \nbreach of contractual obligations without fair \ncompensation\u2014could deter private investment.  \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nSome trade and investment diversification is being \nsupported under the program, including through \ninterventions to capitalize on the EU\u2019s GSP+ trade \nprivilege (obtained in January 2016). \nBudget processes, internal audit, and project \nmanagement systems are being improved, and related \ninstitutional and human resource capacity is being \nstrengthened with development partner support.    \nA centralized public e-procurement system, in line with \ninternational standards, is operating in all state \norganizations. Annual budget allocations, starting in \n2017 under the program, will support sustainability. \nThe program is supporting electronic payments and \nmobile financial services, tax compliance reforms, and \ninstitutionalization of a mechanism for out-of-court \nsettlement of investors\u2019 grievances.  \n\nEEU = Eurasian Economic Union, EU = European Union, GSP+ = Generalized System of Preferences Plus. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n30. \nThe government and MOE have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 3 shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the grant agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n31. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant not exceeding $25,000,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Asian  Development  Fund)  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Second  Investment  Climate  Improvement \nProgram, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft grant agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n\n \n\n \n27 November 2017\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTakehiko Nakao  \nPresident \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \nCompliance \nrequirements for \nEEU regulations \ndelay non-EEU- \nrelated reforms \nand worsen the \nnegative effects \nof slow growth in \nmajor trade and \ninvestment \npartners \n(Kazakhstan and \nthe Russian \nFederation). \n \n\nData Sources \nand Reporting \nMechanisms \na.
