The  deteriorating  fiscal \nposition since fiscal year (FY) 1998 has impeded both central and \nstate  governments  in  their  efforts  to  effectively  finance  desirable \npublic  investment  and  provide  social  sector  expenditure  to  foster \npoverty reduction. To successfully achieve fiscal and governance \nreforms, the state governments must join the central Government \nin addressing fiscal imbalance problems as the states collectively \naccount for about half of the country\u2019s aggregate fiscal deficit.  \n \nThe Assam state government (ASG) faces fiscal and governance-\nrelated  structural  problems;  its  limited  infrastructure  endowment \nlags most Indian states. The state\u2019s fiscal position is weak due to \nstagnation  of  tax  and  nontax  revenues  and  growing  revenue \nexpenditures.  ASG  must  also  contend  with  high  interest  debt, \nrising  government  wage  and  salary  expenditure,  and  pension \nliabilities.  The  several  public  sector  enterprises  (PSEs)  that  are \nloss  making  impose  a  considerable  budgetary  burden,  suppress \ncompetition, and deter private sector participation.  \n \nASG is therefore facing increasing fiscal stress from mounting and \nunsustainable  fiscal  deficits  and  concomitant  large  public  debt. \nWithout  meaningful  fiscal  stabilization  and  consolidation,  and \ngovernance  reforms  to  promote  efficiencies  and  plug  leakages, \ndeteriorating  fiscal  imbalances  and  governance  deficiencies  will \nincreasingly  erode  physical  and  human  capital  expenditures  and \ncrowd  out  private  investment.  This  will  prevent  Assam  from \nfashion.  To \nreaching \nsuccessfully  fulfill  its  development  objectives,  including  poverty \nreduction,  ASG  must  address  its  fiscal  imbalances  and  enhance \ngovernance efficiencies. \n\nits  potential  growth \n\nin  a  sustainable \n\n\fii\n\n \n\n \n     Objective  \n \n\n \n     Components and   \n     Output \n\n \n     Financing Plan \n \n \n\n \n     Program Period  \n     and Tranching \n\nincludes \n\nfinances; \n\n(i)  enhanced \n\nreform  measures  under \n\ntax  base  and  enhanced \n\n \nThe  Program  supports  ASG\u2019s  stabilization  and  consolidation  of \nto  enhance  growth  and  reduce  poverty  by \nstate \nfinances \nstrengthening  public \nfiscal  governance;  and  core \ngovernance  through  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nreforms. \n \nThe  Program  will  support \nthree \ncomponents:  (i)  reform  of  state  finances,  (ii)  reform  of  fiscal \ngovernance,  and  (iii)  reorientation  of  the  role  of  the  state.  The \nfiscal \nfollowing  outcomes  are  expected: \nresponsibility,  (ii)  broadened \ntax \ncollection,  (iii)  enhanced  nontax  revenues,  (iv)  restructured  state \ndebt,  (v)  containment  of  state  pension  liabilities,  (vi)  improved \nstate  budgeting,  (vii)  enhanced  poverty-focused  and  growth-\noriented  expenditure,  (viii)  public  sector  enterprise  reforms,  (ix) \n(x)  public \nstrengthened  public-private  partnership,  and \nadministration review. \n \nThe  Program \nthe  program  cluster  modality  and \ncomprises  two  subprograms  with  a  combined  lending  volume  of \nup to $225 million for the program cluster.  \n \nUnder  subprogram  1,  a  loan  of  $125  million  from  the  ordinary \ncapital  resources  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term including \na  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \nfacility,  a \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nUnder the subsequent subprogram 2, which will be presented for \nconsideration  and  approval  by \nthe  ADB  Board  based  on \nimplementation  progress  with  subprogram  1,  a  loan  of  $100 \nmillion from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will be provided \nunder  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  be \nprovided in two equal installments of $50 million each under terms \nand conditions prescribed by ADB and approved by the Board.  \n \nSubprogram 1 will be implemented over 2.5 years from December \n2004 to June 2007. The loan will be released in three installments: \n$45 million in the first tranche, $45 million in an incentive tranche, \nand  $35  million  in  a  second  tranche.  The  first  tranche  will  be \nreleased  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  incentive  tranche  will  be \nreleased  subject  to  satisfactory  compliance  with  the  tranche \nrelease  conditions.  The  second  tranche  is  expected  to  be \nreleased  within  24  months  from  release  of  the  first  tranche, \nsubject  to  satisfactory  compliance  with  the  tranche  release \nconditions. \n \nSubprogram  2  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  2  years  from \n\nlending \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \n     Estimated Program   \n     Cluster Completion   \n     Date \n \n     Executing Agency  \n     and Implementation  \n     Arrangements \n\n \n     Procurement \n\nDecember  2007  to  December  2009.  The  loan  is  expected  to  be \nreleased  in  two  installments  of  $50  million  each  in  FY2008  and \nFY2010. \n \nDecember 2009 \n\n \nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Program  will  be  the  ASG  Finance \nDepartment. A program steering committee will be responsible for \noverall  coordination, \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  policy \napprovals of the Program; and will assist the Finance Department. \nThe  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary,  include  all \nprincipal  secretaries  and  commissioners  of  participating \ndepartments and the Finance Department, and report to the chief \nminister and the Cabinet.  \n \nA  State-Level  Empowered  Committee  will  monitor  public \nadministration  reform  requirements  under  the  Program.  It  will  be \nchaired  by  an  additional  chief  secretary  and  include  all  principal \nsecretaries  and  commissioners  of  departments  incurring  material \npublic  expenditure.  A  PSE  reform  committee  will  be  responsible \nfor monitoring the progress of PSE reforms under the Program. It \nwill  be  chaired  by  an  additional  chief  secretary  and  include \nrepresentatives of the Department of Public Enterprises, Finance \nDepartment, and PSEs. The Department of Public Enterprises will \nact  as  the  nodal  agency  for  PSE  reforms  and  secretariat  to  the \nPSE  reform  committee.  A  public-private  partnership  task  force, \ncomprising representatives of labor, management, private sector, \ncivil society, and ASG, will report to the PSE reform committee. \n \nASG will establish a fiscal management unit (FMU) in the Finance \nthe  steering  committee.  The  FMU  will \nDepartment  under \nundertake  management  of  fiscal  responsibility,  debt,  and  central \ntransfers,  and  be  responsible  for  daily  implementation  of  the \nProgram under the guidance of the steering committee. The FMU \nwill  coordinate  with  ADB  and  various  stakeholders  and  regularly \nsolicit feedback from experts from within and outside Assam.  \n \nThe FMU will have five reform cells: revenue reform, expenditure \nreform,  budget  reform,  pension  reform,  and  debt  management. \nTheir responsibilities are outlined in the policy matrix.  \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program \nloan  will  be  disbursed  to  India  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting \nimport  documentation  will  be  required, if  during  each  year that \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nloan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed, the  value  of  India\u2019s \ntotal  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible \nimports,  and  imports  financed  under  other  official  development \nassistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan \nexpected \nto  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The  central \nGovernment will certify its compliance with this formula with each \nwithdrawal  request.  Otherwise, \nimport  documentation  under \nexisting  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \naudit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \ncentral Government\u2019s certification. Loan proceeds may be used to \nfinance eligible imports for which expenditures were incurred 180 \ndays before the loan becomes effective. \n \n\nThe Project Loan \n      Objective \n\n \n     Components and     \n     Outputs \n\n \n     Counterpart Funds  The  rupee  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  out  of  the  loan \nproceeds  will  be  transferred  by  the  central  Government  to  ASG. \nThe  counterpart  proceeds  will  be  treated  as  an  addition  to  the \ntransfers allocated annually from the central Government to ASG \nand will be provided on a grant-loan ratio of 90:10. \n \nThe  project  loan  will  provide  (i)  procurement  of  equipment \nrequired  to  develop  and  implement  an  integrated  public  financial \nmanagement  information  system  for  institutional  strengthening; \nand (ii) capacity building to support ASG\u2019s fiscal and governance \nreform  efforts  to  strengthen  its  implementation  of  processes  and \nprocedures  outlined  in  the  Program  through  engagement  of \nconsulting services, increased public awareness, and training.  \n \nThe specific components are (i) coordination, (ii) capacity building \nfor  reform  of  state  finances,  (iii)  capacity  building  for  fiscal \ngovernance reforms, (iv) capacity building for reorienting the role \nof the state, (v) public finance information technology, (vi) training \nprograms, and (vii) public awareness programs. \n \nA  loan  of  $25  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement.  \n \nThe ASG Finance Department will be the Executing Agency. The \nFinance  Department\u2019s  FMU  will  support  project  implementation \nand  be  responsible  for  coordination  with  ASG  departments  and \ntimely implementation of the Project. A project manager, who will \nbe  appointed  for  the  FMU  reporting  to  the  program  steering \ncommittee, will have the authority to make decisions, essential to \nensuring  project  progress  and \nfacilitate  procurement  of \nequipment and recruitment of consulting services.  \n \n \n \n\n \n     Executing Agency  \n     and Implementation  \n     Arrangements \n\n     Financing Plan \n\n \n \n \n\nto \n\n\f \n\n     Procurement and  \n     Consulting  \n     Services \n\n     Benefits and    \n     Beneficiaries \n\n \n     Risks and  \n     Safeguards \n\nv\n\nfor  all  project  components, \n\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Expenditure  procedures  will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nConsultants to be financed from the project loan will be recruited \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  recruitment  of \ndomestic  consultants.  A \ntotal  of  153  person-months  of \ninternational  and  306  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \ninputs will be required.  \n \nConsulting services for the Project\u2019s coordination component (the \ncoordination  consultants)  will  be  provided  by  a  firm  through  the \nquality-based selection method or individual consultants recruited \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement \nof  domestic  consultants  given  the  specialized  nature  of  the \nassignment in undertaking 30% of the total person-months of the \nconsulting  services \nfacilitating \nrecruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement,  and  managing \nconsultants.  Consulting  services  recruited \nfor  other  project \ncomponents  by  the  coordination  consultants  will  be  provided \nthrough  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  by  one  or \nmore  consulting  firms  or  individual  consultants  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic  consultants.  If  firms  are  to  be  selected,  simplified \ntechnical proposals will be used where possible and appropriate.  \n \nThe Program is expected to strengthen the fiscal and governance \npositions of ASG. ASG will have additional resources available to \nbetter translate priority spending to increase growth and ultimately \nreduce  poverty.  ASG  will  be  able  to  reorient  existing  public \nexpenditures  to  capital  outlay  and  maintenance,  which  will  help \nunderpin growth. The Program will help discontinue unproductive \nsubsidies for the public sector, enable poverty-targeted subsidies, \nand  improve  the  quality  of  public  expenditures.  Together  this \nshould  positively  affect  the  livelihood  of  the  more  than  26  million \nwho live in Assam\u201436% are poor.  \n \nIdentifiable benefits will accrue over the medium term in line with \noutcomes detailed in the program framework and policy matrix.  \n \nSpecific and immediate benefits include restructured state debt. In \naddition, several specific actions are directly targeted at the poor, \nsuch as user fees with targeted protection for the poor.  \n \nThe impact on beneficiaries in the population in terms of the labor \nmarkets,  prices,  access  to  public  goods  and services,  and  public \ntransfers should be positive over time. \n \nPolitical  Risks.  Assam  has  experienced  a series  of  political  and \nsocial  challenges  during  the  last  5  to  6  decades.  The  state  has \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nan \n\nprovide \n\nstrategy, \n\nincluding \n\nshown  great  resilience  in  the  face  of  insurgency  accentuated  by \nthe  partition  of  the  country  in  1947,  demographic  changes  and \nreorganization  of  the  state  in  1972  against  a  backdrop  of \neconomic \na \ndeceleration.  The  Program  will \ncomplementary  growth-oriented  program  to  the  steps  already \ntaken by ASG to contain insurgency, and law and order problems \nthrough the Assam Accord of 1985 and the recent Bodo Accord of \nFebruary 2003.  \n \nThe  Program\u2019s  policy  actions  are  structured  through  first  and \nincentive  tranches  to  achieve  critical  results  early  given  the  state \nelectoral  calendar  in  2006.  In  addition,  the  accomplishment  of \nsubprogram  1  second  tranche  policy  actions  after  the  state \nelections  will  set  the  stage  for  deepening  of  policy  reforms  in \nsubprogram 2.   \n \nTo  mitigate  the  risks  of  misinformation  and  lack  of  clear \ncommunication  about  the  implications  of  the  Program  for  key \nstakeholders, the Program includes measures to build consensus \nthrough  a  comprehensive \nand  strong  stakeholder  support \nannual  Assam \ncommunications \ndevelopment  forum.  The  Project  specifically  addresses  public \nawareness. \n \nBureaucratic Risks. The Program aims to increase transparency \nthrough fiscal and governance reforms; and enhance government \nperformance,  accountability, \nresponsiveness,  and  vigilance \nthrough  core  governance  reforms.  To  mitigate  any  opposition  to \nthe  reform  process,  strong  ownership  at  the  highest  political  and \nbureaucratic  levels  has  been  built  into  the  Program  and  its \nimplementation  arrangements.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  build \ncapacity to support reform champions within the system. \n \nInstitutional  Risks.  The  Program\u2019s  comprehensive  nature  will \nplace  considerable  demands  on  the  modest  institutional  capacity \nof  ASG,  which  has  limited  experience  with  this type  of  fiscal  and \ngovernance  reform  program.  The  Project  will  provide  significant \ncapacity  building  and  systems  support,  and  include  performance \nbenchmarks to track institutional performance.  \n \nImplementation  Risks.  Close  performance  monitoring  will  help \nreduce  the  adverse  effects  of  implementation  delays  due  to \ncapacity constraints. The FMU will draw on lessons learned from \nother  programs.  Implementation  delays  caused  by  frequent \nchanges  of  personnel  will  be  mitigated  through  assurances  on \ncontinuity and by the Project\u2019s capacity building. \n \nLegislative  Risks.  Risks  of  delay  in  legislative  enactment  may \narise.  These  will,  to  the  extent  possible,  be  mitigated  through \npolicy  commitment,  prior \ninstitutional  actions,  and  public \nawareness,  which  will  propel  the  critical  substantive  content  of \nreforms. \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on    (i)  a  proposed \nprogram cluster concept for the Assam Governance and Public Resource Management Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (AGPRM  SDP);  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  to  India  for  subprogram  1  of  the \nAGPRM SDP; and (iii) a proposed loan to India for the Assam Governance and Public Resource \nManagement Project to support implementation of AGPRM SDP policy reforms.  \n \n\nII. \n\nMACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nSustainability of Recent Economic Performance. The recent economic performance \nof India has been impressive with gross domestic product (GDP) growth more than doubling to \n8.2% in fiscal year (FY) 2004 as compared with 4.0% in FY2003. The key question is whether \nthis  high  growth  is  sustainable.  The  downside  risks  during  the  current  year  include  the  still \ninadequate progress in fiscal consolidation at the center as well as by the states.1 Inadequate \nfiscal  consolidation  by  the  states  has  the  potential  to  undermine  the  sustainability  of  recent \neconomic  performance  and  the  delivery  of  promised  economic  prospects.  Given  the  state \ngovernments\u2019 demands for funds, the national economy is  more prone to higher interest rates \nand to crowding out private investment. The high percentage of revenue deficit in the state fiscal \ndeficit,2  primarily  due  to  wages,  salaries,  pensions,  and  interest  payments,  limits  government \nspending  on  education,  health,  and  infrastructure,  and  means  that  the  burden  of  fiscal  deficit \ncorrection  tends  to  fall  on  public  investment.  This  does  not  allow  government  to  address \nconstraints to economic growth caused by inadequate infrastructure and poor social indicators.  \n \nDevelopment in Assam. Assam is the largest of the seven states3 in the northeast of \n3. \nIndia. It has 2.6% (or 26.6 million) of India\u2019s population spread over 2.4% of the country\u2019s area \n(78,438 square kilometers). Assam\u2019s development is of particular significance as a gateway for \ndevelopment  of  the  northeast  given  both  its  relative  size,  and  its  position  as  a  center  of \ninterstate trade and integrated infrastructure in the northeast. Assam is rich in natural resources, \nincluding  substantial  forest  resources;4  produces  54%  of  India\u2019s  tea  production;  and  produces \nover 5 million tons of crude oil a year, making it India\u2019s leading producer of crude oil. The long \nBrahmaputra  river  basin  running  through  the  state  serves  as  its  lifeline.  The  state  is  prone  to \nflooding  and  earthquakes,  and  is  geographically  isolated.  The  central  Government  explicitly \nrecognized these unique geographic, natural, and exogenous constraints on Assam\u2019s capacity \nto develop by granting the state the status of Special Category State and extending assistance \non a grant-loan ratio of 90:10.  \n \n4. \nDespite  its  natural  resources  and  special  status,  Assam  is  lagging  in  terms  of \ndevelopment.  This  becomes  apparent  through  a  comparative  examination  of  a  number  of  key \ndevelopment indicators such as growth, per capita income, poverty ratios, and unemployment. \nAs economic liberalization in the 1990s has taken the nation and some other states on a higher \ngrowth  trajectory,  Assam  has  recorded  slow  economic  growth.  During  the  9th  Five  Year  Plan \nperiod  (1997\u20132002),  India\u2019s  GDP  grew  at  5.4%,  while  Assam\u2019s  corresponding  gross  state \ndomestic product (GSDP) growth was only 2.1%. In per capita income terms, while per capita \nincome in Assam in FY1951 was Rs1,173 as compared with Rs1,127 for India (i.e., Assam\u2019s per \n                                                 \n1   The combined gross fiscal deficit of the central and state governments remains high at 10% of GDP. About half of \nthis  fiscal  deficit  may  be  attributed  to  the  central  Government  with  most  of  the  rest  attributable  to  the  fiscal \nprofligacy of the states. \n\n2   Currently, the percentage of revenue deficit in the fiscal deficit is 62%. \n3   These states are Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura. \n4   The total area under forest in Assam at the end of March 2001 was 267,781 square kilometers, about 34.14% of \nthe total geographic area. Forest products mainly comprise industrial wood, fuelwood, bamboo, and thatched cane.  \n\n\f 2\n\ncapita  income  was  104.1%  of  India\u2019s),  Assam\u2019s  per  capita  income  as  a  percentage  of  the  all-\nIndia per capita income declined to 55.4%, an alarming trend. Over 40% of the rural population \nlive below the poverty line,5 and over 36% of the total population do so in Assam; this compares \nunfavorably with national poverty levels. The poverty ratio of Assam as of FY2000 was 36.09% \ncompared  with  26.10%  for  India.  Furthermore,  low  economic  growth  has  meant  a  slower \nreduction  in  poverty  in  Assam  compared  with  India  as  a  whole.6  Finally,  in  terms  of \nunemployment,  the  slow  growth  of  the  economy  together  with  the  rapid  growth  of  population \nand declining job creation7 have given rise to a serious unemployment problem in the state. As \nof FY2002, the number of unemployed per 1,000 was 21 in rural areas and 20 in urban areas in \nAssam as compared with 5 in rural areas and 14 in urban areas in India.8 Against this economic \nbackdrop,  the  tribal  diversity,  and  the  inherent  and  immigration  accentuated  ethnic  mix  of  the \nstate9  have  made  it  prone  to  indigenous  and  tribal  unrest.  The  insurgency  movements  of  the \n1980s and 1990s cast a shadow on Assam\u2019s development. In light of these facts, any progress \nin  addressing  Assam\u2019s  developmental  lag  can  be  expected  to  complement  steps  taken  to \ncontain insurgency in the form of the Assam Accord of 1985 and the Bodo Accord of 2003, and \nalleviate the development of \u201ctwo Indias\u201d in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\nFiscal Constraints. The critical factors for Assam\u2019s developmental lag are found in the \n5. \nfiscal and governance constraints of the state. Fiscal trends for Assam show that the average \nrevenue  and  fiscal  deficits  were  significantly  higher  in  the  1990s  than  in  the  1980s.  This  was \nprimarily due to the sharp increase in revenue expenditures,10 especially following the pay and \npension  revisions  in  FY2000  resulting  from  the  central  Government\u2019s  Fifth  Pay  Commission \nrecommendation.  Thus,  as  a  ratio  of  GSDP,  the  fiscal  deficit  deteriorated  sharply  to  5.68%  in \nFY2000.11  The  trend  was  similar  for  revenue  deficits,  which  deteriorated  to  3.55%  in  FY2000, \nafter the pay and pensions revision.12  \n \n6. \nFrom  FY2001  to  FY2003,  fiscal  and  revenue  deficits  improved  to  3.1%  and  1.41% \nrespectively  with  indications  that  this  trend  is  continuing  in  FY2004.13  However,  despite  the \nimprovement in the revenue deficit and fiscal deficit indicators, the underlying picture is troubling \nbecause  the  increasing  pressure  to  spend  on  revenue  expenditures  has  crowded  out  capital \nexpenditures. While revenue expenditures grew at more than 12% per annum during FY1992 to \nFY2002,14  capital  expenditure  declined  from  2.34%  of  GSDP  in  FY1992  to  1.4%  of  GSDP  in \n                                                 \n5   The  cut-off  expenditure  for  Assam  poverty  according  to  the  Planning  Commission  is  Rs365.43  per  capita  per \n\nmonth for FY2000 in rural areas and Rs343.99 per capita per month for urban areas. \n\n6   In  Assam,  the  poverty  ratio  declined  from  40.86%  in  FY1994  to  36.09%  in  FY2000.  In  comparison,  the  national \n\npoverty ratio declined from 35.97% in FY1994 to 26.10% in FY2000. \n\n7   While  the  decadal  population  growth  in  Assam  according  to  the  2001  census  was  1.73%,  the  growth  in  workers \n\nwas only 0.13%.  \n\nexpenditures.  \n\n8   Given the remoteness of certain parts of Assam, the number of registered unemployed may be understated. \n9   In 1947, the state of Assam consisted of the entire northeast represented today by seven states in the northeast. \n10  Revenue  expenditures  include  current  expenditures  on  salaries,  pensions,  and  interest,  and  exclude  capital \n\n11  The fiscal deficit was 1.03% in FY1999. \n12 The revenue deficit was 2.21% in FY1992. \n13  A  comparison  between  the  all-states  average  and  Assam  on  revenue  deficit  and  fiscal  deficit  shows  a  steeper \ndeterioration  in  Assam  than  the  all-state  average  as  a  result  of  the  pay  revision  (FY2000)  and  a  catching  up  of \nAssam to the fairly stagnant all-state average thereafter (FY2001 to FY2003).  \n\n14  The secular deterioration in revenue expenditure in the 1980s and 1990s was transformed into a state fiscal crisis \nas a result of the pay and pensions revision in FY2000. Thus, salaries as a ratio of own revenues rose from 147% \nin FY1994 to 258% in FY2000. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\ninfrastructure  availability.15  This  has  had  adverse \nFY2003  with  adverse  effects  on \nconsequences for growth. While the growth rate of GSDP in the 1990s accelerated in the rest of \nthe country, it declined in Assam. The real growth of GSDP at about 2% per annum compares \npoorly with the 5.4% growth in GDP in the country during the 1990s. \n \nAlongside  galloping  revenue  expenditures,  the  state  also  suffered  a  slowdown  in  the \n7. \ngrowth  of  revenues.  The  stagnancy  of  the  state  economy  is  one  of  the  reasons  for  a \ndecelerating effect on revenues16 even though buoyancy17 of the state\u2019s own taxes continued to \nbe above unity. The state\u2019s own revenue finances less than one third of total public expenditure \n(current expenditure and capital outlay) with central transfers contributing to the remaining two \nthirds.  Despite  the  fact  that  state\u2019s  tax  effort  has  improved,18  this  basic  imbalance  limits  the \nextent to which fiscal consolidation can be accomplished through reforms on the revenue side of \nthe budget.  \n \n8. \nThe  major  taxes  in  Assam,  including  sales  tax,  state  excise  duty,  vehicle  taxes,  stamp \nduty,  and  registration  fees  and  land  revenue,  exhibit  divergent  trends.  The  bulk  of  revenue \ncomes  from  sales  tax  and  state  excise  duties.19  Average  growth  rates  of  stamps,  registration \nfees,  and  agricultural  income  tax  declined  in  the  1990s  when  compared  with  the  1980s;  while \nthose of sales tax, state excise, and taxes on vehicles increased. However, sales tax registered \nonly a marginal rise in growth. Although growth of the state economy has been slow, much of \nGSDP growth in recent years has been in the services sector, a large proportion of which is not \nincluded  in  the  tax  base.  In  addition  to  such  structural  issues,  administrative  and  compliance \nissues have been major factors in the decelerating trend in the growth of key taxes. Most of the \nneighboring  states  in  the  northeast  have  acted  as  tax  havens,  resulting  in  significant  evasion \nand avoidance of taxes.  \n \n9. \nNontax revenue was virtually stagnant in the 1990s. The average growth rate of nontax \nrevenues  declined  from  17%  during  the  1980s  to  a  mere  4%  during  the  1990s.  The growth of \npetroleum royalty, which contributed 77% of the total nontax revenue in FY2003, does not depend \non state action; and  receipts from forestry, which were a significant source, lost their importance \nfollowing  the  judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  banning  the  felling  of  trees.  However,  the  Assam \nstate government (ASG) has failed to effectively tap other nontax revenue sources, which do fall \nwithin  the  realm  of  state  policy  making.  While  the  expenditure  on  most  public  services  has \nmaintained a rising trend, the inertia of successive state governments to revise fees, tariffs, rents, \nand royalties linked to affordability and service quality has led to the corresponding revenues from \nthose  services  not  keeping  pace,  and  very  low  recovery  rates,  even  compared  with  the  national \naverage.20  \n \n10. \nThe sharp increase in Assam\u2019s revenue expenditures alongside slowing revenue growth \ncould  only  be  supported  by  higher  borrowings  by  ASG.  This  led  to  increasing  indebtedness, \ngrowing from 24% of GSDP in FY1996 to 36% in FY2002.21 The increasing levels of debt have \n\n                                                 \n15  Assam\u2019s infrastructure index in 1999 was only 72.7 compared with the all-India average of 100. \n16 State tax revenues declined in annual growth rate from 16.8% in 1981\u20131991 to 13% in 1992\u2013 2002. \n17  Buoyancy  represents  the  percentage  change  in  tax  collections  associated  with  a  1%  change  in  the  tax  base \n\n(typically GSDP). \n\n18 The share of own tax revenue to GSDP ratio increased from 3.1% in FY1982 to 5.3% in FY2003. \n19 In FY2003, sales tax formed 74.45% of own tax revenues, state excise formed 6.3%, taxes on vehicles amounted \n\nto 6%, stamp duty and registration fees formed 2.6%, and land revenues accounted for 3.2%.   \n\n20  For example, the recovery rate in health is 2.4% as against 4% at the national level. Cost recovery for higher education \n\nand technical education is negligible at 0.3%. \n\n21  From FY1988 to FY2003, outstanding state debt increased 4.8 times. \n\n\f 4\n\nalso  led  to  higher  interest  payments,22  exacerbated  by  recourse  to  increased  borrowing  from \nhigh  cost  sources  such  as  small  savings  and  provident  funds,  and  poor  cash  management.23 \nThus, the average rate of interest on the state\u2019s borrowing increased from 7% in the early 1990s \nto around 10.5% in FY2002. Since the interest rate is higher than the rate of growth of the state \neconomy (approximately 7\u20138%), the debt position of the state is becoming unsustainable.  \n \n11. \nFiscal Governance Constraints. The fiscal constraints on the amount of resources due \nto  rising  revenue  expenditures,  choking  capital  expenditures,  limits  to  revenue  enhancement, \nand  increased  reliance  on  borrowing,  has  been  compounded  in  Assam  by  fiscal  governance \nconstraints that result in ineffective use of existing resources. At first sight, the state would seem \nto have little leeway in this regard since central transfers constitute over 62% of total revenues. \nHowever,  the  significance  of  current  fiscal  governance  weaknesses  in  financial  management \nand  state  budgeting  on  prioritization  of  expenditures  in  Assam  can  be  illustrated  through  the \nunderutilization  of  centrally  sponsored  schemes.  ASG\u2019s  inability  to  allocate  the  necessary \ncounterpart funds required under centrally sponsored schemes has prevented the utilization of \ngrants allocated to it. In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General Report for FY1996\u20132001 \npointed  to  a  lack  of  submission  of  utilization  certificates  and  diversion  of  funds  for  education, \nirrigation, health and family welfare, public health engineering, and municipal administration.24  \n \n12. \nCore  Governance  Constraints.  Core  governance  constraints  comprise  overarching, \ncross-sector governance constraints that adversely affect the rationalization and quality of public \nexpenditure for the delivery of public goods and services. Poor public administration can act as \nsuch  a  core  governance  constraint.  Various  sociopolitical  reasons  during  the  last  2  decades \nhave  given  rise  to  an  inordinate  number  of  ASG  employees.  This  is  distorting  the  local  labor \nmarket.25  Notwithstanding  efforts  by  ASG  to  make  government  more  responsive  and \naccountable,  there  are  concerns  about  the  limited  capacity  of  ASG  to  effectively  undertake  its \ncore functions as a result of inadequately aligned organizational structures, skills and incentives, \nhuman resources management, and performance and accountability rules. Such organizational \nstructures  are  evident  in  overlapping  assignment  of  functions  and  responsibilities,  the  skewed \nassignment of employees, and the high \u201ctail to teeth\u201d ratio of ASG employees where the tail is \nrepresented  by  grade  III  and  IV  and  the  teeth  are  represented  by  grades  I  and  II,  i.e.,  an \noverwhelming  predominance  of  grade  III  and  IV  employees.26  The  qualitative  performance \nindicators  in  the  sectors  suggest  that  this  kind  of  government  bureaucracy  has  not  been \neffective in delivering public goods and services.27\n\n                                                 \n22  Interest payments grew by 13.6% per annum from FY1988 to FY2003. \n23  During  FY2002,  the  state  incurred  interest  expenditure  of  Rs1.39  billion  on  ways  and  means  advances  and \noverdrafts.  In  FY2003,  the  state  was  in  overdraft  for  287  days,  and  for  154  working  days  payments  were \nsuspended.  The  central  Government  and  Reserve  Bank  of  India  provide  ways  and  means  advances  to  help  the \nstate  overcome  temporary  liquidity  shortfalls.  Overdrafts  are  amounts  drawn  by  a  state  in  excess  of  ways  and \nmeans advances. \n\n24  For example, for the Nonformal Education Scheme, ASG did not utilize 45% of the central Government funds; for \nthe  National  Blindness  Control  Program  Rs0.0157  billion  out  of  Rs0.0159  billion  remained  unutilized;  and  for  the \nIntegrated  Irrigation  Scheme  on  Kollong  River  and  the  Accelerated  Urban  Water  Supply  Program  committed \ncentral assistance was never released. \n\n25  Three thousand teachers  were recruited  without sanctioned positions according to the 2003 Medium-Term Fiscal \nReform  Program  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  between  the  central  Government  and  ASG.  Taking  an \naverage family size of five, 1 of every 10 households in Assam is deriving income from government employment. \nGovernment employment pays approximately 250% of the local unskilled market rate in Assam. \n\n26 Based on 1998 estimates the total number of ASG employees was 443,934, the largest number were in the grade \nIII  category,  namely  333,085  representing  76.48%  of  total  employees.  Grades  I  and  II  represent  the  higher \ncategories of ASG employees. \n\n27  The census figures for Assam show that while Assam is in the mid-range of national literacy at 64.28% in 2001, in \nparticular districts like Dhubri, more than half the population aged seven and above is illiterate. In terms of infant \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \nThe  poor  performance  of  Assam\u2019s  public  sector  enterprises  (PSEs)  has  adversely \n13. \naffected the rationalization and quality of public expenditure for services by requiring subsidies \nand  causing  the  buildup  of  contingent  liabilities;  some  of  these  services  could  instead  be \nprovided by the private sector. ASG owns 47 PSEs, excluding the Assam State Electricity Board \n(ASEB).28  The  performance  of  the  PSEs  has  been  poor:  only  629  are  profitable  and  of  these, \nonly 2 (Assam Gas Co. Ltd. and Assam Petrochemicals Ltd.) are able to provide dividends. As \nPSEs  underperformed,  their  ability  to  borrow  from  the  market  on  the  strength  of  their  balance \nsheets  declined.  Consequently,  they  increasingly  turned  to  ASG  guarantees  to  access  debt. \nASG guarantees, related largely to PSE borrowings, have grown approximately 1.8 times from \nFY1992 to FY2002. In addition, certain PSEs continue to act as a drain on the state budget by \nobtaining subsidies to cover their operations losses.30 A sector analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \nGovernment  Reform  Commitment.  ASG  has  responded  to  these  challenges  by \n14. \nsignaling  its  clear  intent  to  bring  public  finances  back  on  a  sustainable  path  and  improve \ngovernance to enable income poverty reduction and employment generation through enhanced \ngrowth.  Sustained  high  growth  in  turn  depends  crucially  on  creating  fiscal  resources  for \nadditional  public  investment.  Consequently,  the  state  signed  the  Medium-Term  Fiscal  Reform \nProgram  (MTFRP)  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  in  March  2003  with  the  central \nGovernment, indicating its commitment to a medium-term strategy for fiscal consolidation. The \nMOU  was  signed  under  the  aegis  of  the  central  Government\u2019s  Fiscal  Reforms  Facility,  which \nlinks  a  portion  of  untied  central  grants  to  the  fiscal  performance  correction  of  states  and \nprovides states with incentives to take up MTFRPs. In 2003, the state conducted debt swaps for \nhigh interest debt and undertook efforts to enact a value-added tax (VAT) law.31 ASG initiated a \nprogram to computerize its treasuries. By the end of 2003, ASG had adopted the Assam Power \nSector  Development  Program  with  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The \nprogram initiated restructuring of ASEB and the transparent reflection of power sector liabilities \nin the state budget. ASG also implemented a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for the Assam \nState  Transport  Corporation.  Between  1999  and  2003,  it  reduced  regular  government \nemployees from 459,701 to 435,534\u2015an average reduction of about 6,042 a year.32 Finally, in \n2004,  ASG  ceased  to  pay  approximately  3,000  unsanctioned  teachers  identified  in  the  2003 \nMTFRP MOU. \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n15. \nTo build on this determination to solve fiscal and governance problems, the intent of the \nMTFRP MOU must be translated, through institutional strengthening and capacity building, into \na  medium-term  program  framework  of  realistic  fiscal  and  governance  performance  targets.  A \nprogram that addresses the opportunities offered by specific fiscal, fiscal governance, and core \ngovernance issues can provide a fiscal stabilization solution suitable for Assam. \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nmortality rates, the divergence between Assam (76 per 1,000 births) and India (70 per 1,000 births) was increasing \nby the end of the 1990s.  \n\n28 ASEB\u2019s performance is illustrated in Assam Power Sector Development Program. Asian Development Bank. 2003. \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  on  Assam  Power  Sector  Development  Program.  10  Dec  2003. \nManila. \n\n29  The six PSEs are ARTFED; Assam Cooperative Jute Mills; Assam Electronics Development Corporation; Assam \n\nGas Company; Assam Petrochemicals; and Assam State Textbook Production and Publication Corporation.  \n\n30  For example, Assam State Transport Corporation is still obtaining state budget support. \n31  ASG\u2019s attempt to enact VAT legislation in 2003 did not go forward in the absence of a national consensus on VAT.  \n32  This represents a cumulative reduction in government employee strength by 6.54%. \n\n\f 6\n\n1. \n\nFiscal \n\n16.  Medium-Term  Fiscal  Plan  and  Fiscal  Responsibility.  If  the  impetus  to  medium-term \nfiscal planning is to effectively contain Assam\u2019s revenue and fiscal deficits along a sequenced, \nbalanced,  and  time-bound  path,  legislation  is  needed  to  embed  transparent  and  accountable \nfiscal discipline based on medium-term fiscal reform scenario targets supported by institutional \nmonitoring  mechanisms.  This  would  align  Assam  with  the  central  Government,  which  adopted \nthe Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act in 2003.33  \n \nNarrow  Tax  Base  and  Discretionary  and  Inefficient  Tax  Collection.  The  sales  and \n17. \nexcise  taxes  in  Assam  offer  a  particular  opportunity  for  addressing  the  narrow  tax  base  and \ninefficient  tax  collection,  and  consequent  enhancement  of  revenues.  In  terms  of  tax  policy,  a \nmajor shortcoming of the sales tax system is the narrow base due to the predominance of the \nlevy  at  the  first  point  of  sale.  A  part  of  the  tax  base  is  eroded  because  of  fiscal  incentives, \nthough  their  efficacy  in promoting  industrialization  in  the  state  is  doubtful.  Equally  important  is \nthe  low  sales  tax  administrative  capacity  and  poor  management  information  system  (MIS) \nleading to large-scale evasion and avoidance of tax, especially given the fact that neighboring \nstates, where sales tax is in its infancy, act as tax havens. Some problems relate to ineffective \nenforcement  and  inefficient  utilization  of  staff  on  functional  lines,  such  as  internal  audit, \ncompliance,  enforcement,  and  recovery.  Assessment  of  sales  tax  on  an  all-returns  basis  has \nbeen a continuing problem that needs immediate attention. As of 31 March 2003, as many as \n30,635  cases  were  pending  assessment.  Excise  duty  in  Assam  is  currently  constrained  by  a \nvariety of factors, including (i) inadequacies of border controls; (ii) system of specific levies, with \nexcise  duties  varying  by  type  of  brand  and  percentage  of  alcohol;  and  (iii)  system  of \ndepartmental controls on number of outlets under a fixed vendor fee and license fee system.  \n \n18. \nThe key question on stamp duty and registration fees is why they do  not appear to be \nincreasing  commensurate  with  the  growth  in  land  values  in  Assam,  especially  in  urban  areas. \nThe revenue from stamps and registration fees depends heavily on the valuation of properties \ntransacted.  Because  Assam  has  inadequately  implemented  the  law  to  fix  property  value,  the \nsystem and associated high rates of duty result in heavy undervaluation of property and loss of \nrevenue for ASG. \n \n19. \nThe  question  arises  as  to  how  the  motor  vehicles  tax  can  be  improved  commensurate \nwith the increase in transport traffic given its buoyancy. Tax administration measures proposed \naim to expand the tax base and curb evasion, especially at the interstate border.  \n \n20. \nAgricultural income tax generated revenues of Rs1.03 billion in FY1992, but declined to \nRs0.02 billion in FY2003 given the fluctuating fortunes of the tea industry. A key issue is the lack \nof  harmonization  of  the  peak  rate  of  agricultural  income  tax  with  business  income,  leading  to \nunderstatement  of  composite  income  and  transfers  of  proceeds  from  agriculture  to  pure \nbusiness income.  \n \n21. \nNontax Revenue Enhancement. Tapping the potential of nontax sources for enhancing \nrevenue  would  require  raising  fees,  rent,  and  inflation-indexed  user  charges.  Linking  such  hikes \nwith  improvement  in  quality  and  delivery  of  service  with  targeted  protection  for  the  poor  is  a  key \nissue. Such linkage and local administration of such nontax revenues provides opportunities that \n\n                                                 \n33  The  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budgetary  Management  Act  requires  the  central  Government  to  eliminate  the \nrevenue deficit by FY2008 (shifted to FY2009 through an amendment under the Finance Bill of July 2004). Various \nstates  such  as  Karnataka,  Kerala,  Punjab,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  have  enacted  fiscal  responsibility \nlegislation at the state level. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nhave  not  been  sufficiently  exploited.  This  lack  of  participatory  management  of  maintenance \nreinforces reliance on costly departmental staffing and attendant revenue expenditures.  \n \n22. \nRestructure  State  Debt.  Key  issues  that  present  significant  potential  for  containing \nASG\u2019s  debt  stock  and  interest  payments  are  (i)  redressing  reliance  on  ways  and  means \nadvances  and  overdrafts,  (ii)  using  available  debt  swapping  and  settlement  to  relieve \nprepayable  past  high  interest  debt,  and  (iii)  addressing  debt  policy  inadequacies  and \nadministrative  constraints  on  effective  cash  and  debt  management  of  ASG.  ASG  has  been \nundertaking  Rs8.35  billion  of  debt  swapping  of  high  interest  debt,  drawing  on  National  Small \nSavings Fund proceeds (and matching market borrowings) in FY2003. It has contained the level \nof reliance on ways and means advances and overdrafts from the peak of FY2001 and FY2002. \nHowever, more opportunities exist combined with better institutional mechanisms and systems \nfor cash and debt management to increase data on loans and reduce reliance on the Reserve \nBank of India and Comptroller and Auditor General for loan information requirements. \n \n23. \nContainment  of  State  Pensions.  Three  key  issues,  if  addressed,  can  potentially \ncontribute to containing burgeoning retirement benefits in Assam. First, in terms of the structure \nof retirement benefits: (i) benefits are coupled with rising wages and salaries; (ii) dearness relief \noutstrips  inflation;  and  (iii)  significant  up-front  commutation  payments  are  available.  The \nincrease  in the  number  of  employees  retiring,  compounded  by  particularly  significant  spurts  in \nemployment growth in the 1970s and 1980s, means that in the longer term, the state may face a \nliquidity issue as it seeks to meet retirement benefit dues.  \n \n24. \nSecond,  given  the  substantial  liability  represented  by  the  retirement  benefits  dues  the \nstate is obligated to pay current employees when they retire, the state budget will be faced with \nunmanageable  and  unfunded  pension  liabilities  if  no  systemic  change  is  made  to  the  defined \nretirement benefit costs for new ASG employees. This will undermine the sustainability of state \nfinances in the medium term.34  \n \n25. \nFinally,  in  terms  of  administrative  processing  capacity  and  management,  the  rising \npension  expenditures  will  require  more  efficient  processing  capacity  than  the  state  currently \npossesses. Failure to address this key institutional constraint over the medium term will result in \nabuse  of  pension  entitlements,  pension  arrears  for  ASG  employees,  and  forecasting \nweaknesses that the state cannot afford given the trend of pension liabilities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nFiscal Governance \n\n26. \nState  Budgeting  and  Financial  Management.  In  Assam,  state  budgets  are  prepared \non  an  annual  basis  without  medium-term  planning.  Medium-term  planning  over  a  3-  to  5-year \ntime horizon provides an opportunity for state budget planning, preparation, and presentation to \nfoster revenue forecasting that is not overly optimistic. It would strengthen budget expenditure \ninformation  for  state  policy  on  medium-term  fiscal  plan  (MTFP)  targets  and  rigorous  capital \nexpenditure  priorities  over  the  medium-term,  as  well  as  enhance  the  scrutiny  of  expenditures \nconsistent  with  the  resource  available.  There  is  a  corresponding  need  for  transparent  fiscal \nreporting on critical fiscal data that are not distorted in terms of off-budget borrowings (such as \nby public sector enterprises) and arrears on bills and dues that defer deficits. This requires an \nintegrated  public  financial  MIS  that  ultimately  links  reliable  and  comprehensive  employee  and \npension  databases  to  a  treasury  and  payments  information  technology  system  and  state-wide \nuniform  procurement  standards.  These  are  yet  to  be  established  in  the  state.  The  integrity  of \n                                                 \n34 According to current actuarial estimates this liability for ASG could amount to a present value of as much as three \n\ntimes its FY2003 GSDP. \n\n\f 8\n\nany  future  medium-term  fiscal  planning  and  legislatively  mandated  fiscal  responsibility  for  the \nstate will be dependent on such fiscal governance issues being addressed. \n \n\n3. \n\nCore Governance \n\nSecond,  assessment  of  public  administration  performance,  in  terms  of  leakage, \n\nPublic Administration. Several key issues need to be addressed to rationalize the high \n27. \ncomponent of salaries and wages of ASG employees in revenue expenditures, and assess the \nquality of expenditure on such employees.  \n \nFirst, the level of replacement of retiring government employees needs to be addressed. \n28. \nGiven  the  high  public  administration  cost  as  a  percentage  of  GSDP,35  containment  of  the \nreplacement to attrition ratio is of critical importance for creating sustainable fiscal resources.36 \nAgainst the background of government employment in a high unemployment state, this will need \nto be accompanied by support for developing businesses and vocational training.  \n \n29. \ncorruption, and appropriate functional efficiency is important for effective rationalization. \n \n30. \nFinally,  the  absence  of  a  full  employee  database  constrains  the  ability  of  ASG  to \nresponsibly and efficiently restructure the size of its government employment and the collateral \neffects that reducing government employment would have on retirement benefits. The database \nwould address the weak administrative capacity of ASG with regard to government employment, \nevidenced by ASG\u2019s inability to identify all nonessential posts since 1999. \n \nPublic  Sector  Enterprises.  Five  key  issues  need  to  be  addressed  to  contain  the \n31. \ninvestment  and  operating  losses  and  guaranteed  loan  overdues  of  PSEs  in  Assam.  First,  the \nfiscal effect of the noncommercial orientation of PSEs must be limited by enhancing corporate \ngovernance  requirements  for  PSEs.  The  noncommercial  character  of  a  substantial  number  of \nPSEs  has  resulted  in  large-scale,  commercially  unjustified  employment  creation,37  and \nappointments to senior management positions and the board that are not based on professional \nexpertise or the best commercial talent, but are subject to political/bureaucratic influences.  \n \nSecond  strengthened  financial  governance  is needed  to  contain  loss making  by  PSEs. \n32. \nFor  example,  for  the  47  PSEs,  on  average,  the  most  current  financial  statements  are  8  years \nold.  Some  PSEs  have  not  prepared  financial  statements  for  up  to  20  years.38  Financial \ngovernance would also require ASG to explicitly acknowledge unfunded liabilities of PSEs, like \nASEB, and reflect these in the state budget. Improved financial governance would enable ASG \nto better manage its PSE exposure.  \n \n33. \nThird,  the  excessive  debt  burden  for  some  loss-making  PSEs  raises  the  issue  of \nimpediments to their closure. Cumulative losses and lack of funding combined with lack of hard \nbudget  constraints  applied  by  ASG  to  PSEs,  enabled  PSEs  to  increasingly  borrow\u2014through \nASG\u2014guaranteed loans from financial institutions and unguaranteed loans, and incur overdues \nwith financial institutions. This means that PSEs have ended up carrying an unfavorable debt-\n                                                 \n35  Assam\u2019s  public  administration  outlay  was  7.76%  of  GSDP  in  FY2001;  this  was  higher  than  Andhra  Pradesh \n\n(5.25%), Karnataka (4.99%), and West Bengal (6.10%). \n\n36 The price effects on the average salary of ASG employees are also important. These include the potential merger \n\nof 50% of dearness allowance with basic pay initiated by the central Government. \n\n37 Assam currently has approximately 32,000 PSE employees. \n38 Examples of long-dated arrears, include Assam Government Marketing Corporation (20 years arrears) and Assam \nLivestock and Poultry Development Corporation (17 years arrears). The availability of up-to-date audited accounts \nis critical for a PSE closure and restructuring program. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nFourth,  the  needs  of  employees  to  be  separated  from  PSEs  to  be  closed  must  be \n\nequity  ratio  with  an  unsustainable  debt  burden.39  The  shifting  of  PSE  funding  gaps  to  PSE \nemployees prevents legal closure and results in further debts for state finances.40  \n \n34. \naddressed through an appropriate VRS and social safety net (SSN). \n \n35. \nFinally, the fragmented and inadequate oversight of ASG needs to be addressed. ASG \nhas no comprehensive PSE policy and no coordinating senior decision-making body that is able \nto  effectively  champion  and  guide  PSE  reforms.  No  effective  implementing  agencies  are \navailable for such reforms. Instead, the responsibility to manage ASG interest in the 47 PSEs is \nspread over 21 government departments.  \n \n36. \nLessons  Learned.  These  issues  underlying  weak  sector  performance  confirm  lessons \ndrawn  from  previous  experience  in  policy-based  adjustment  lending  in  India.41  Careful \nconsideration should be given to (i) the need for extensive time in consensus building dialogue \nand  ownership  of  the  policy-based  program  lending,  not  only  from  the  executing  agency,  but \nalso across different line departments and levels of government and government officials; (ii) the \nneed for a reform program that carefully integrates governance and public finance reforms and \ndoes so in a manner of a program of manageable proportions focused on end results; (iii) the \ncrucial  linkage  between  power  sector  reforms  and  public  resource  management  reforms  in \nterms  of  fiscal  impact;  (iv)  the  need  to  ensure  transparent  flexibility  in  numerical  targets  for \nrevenue and fiscal deficit, given the sensitivity to changes in the external environment including \nchanges in central Government policies and natural calamities; (v) the need to emphasize not \nmerely  policy  reforms  but  also  institutional  capacity  building  through  a  project  loan  under  a \nsector  development  program  modality  that  modernizes  public  finance  and  management \nsystems,  and  provides  training,  consulting  services,  and  information  technology  systems  that \nhelp  state  governments  ensure  assessment,  identification,  and  timely  achievement  of  desired \npolicy reforms; (vi) the need for a public awareness program that explains the rationale of the \nreforms  and  its  benefits  to  all  stakeholders,  including  the  general  public,  government  officials, \nand  taxpayers  and  user  charge  payers;  and  (vii)  the  need  to  incorporate  institutional \nmechanisms and capacity building of government officials for intensive and rigorous monitoring.  \n \nRationale. Since the mid-1990s, ADB\u2019s strategy has been, at the request of the central \n37. \nGovernment, to focus on state policy and institutional reform operations successively in Gujarat, \nMadhya  Pradesh,  Kerala,  and  now  Assam.  Sustainable  state  reform  efforts  on  fiscal  and \ngovernance  issues  is  key  to  central  Government  efforts  to  inject  effective  fiscal  management, \neliminate  the  revenue  deficit,  gradually  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  to \nachieve  the  development  goals  of  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2002\u20132007),  and  attain  a  well-\ndistributed growth of income in line with the Millenium Development Goals in the country as a \nwhole.  Such  a  state-level  reform  effort  is  particularly  critical  in  Assam  as  the  gateway  to  the \nnortheast if the threat of a widening development gap between different parts of India is to be \naverted.  However,  this  will  only  be  possible  if  India\u2019s  development  partners  support  Assam\u2019s \nefforts, anchored on the 2003 MTFRP MOU by financing the cost of adjustment of reforms by \nway  of  state  programs  that  have  (i)  broad-based  stakeholder  support  for  implementation  of  a \ncarefully  sequenced  fiscal  and  governance  reform  agenda;  (ii)  sustained  monitoring  of \nrealistically  set  fiscal  and  governance  targets  founded  on  careful  diagnostic  analysis;  and  (iii) \n\n                                                 \n39  Some  PSE  debt-equity  ratio  examples  are  Fertichem  7.9:1,  and  Assam  Financial  Corporation  5.3:1;  the \n\nsustainable norm of a debt-equity ratio is 2:1. \n\n40 In the case of Fertichem (one of the 47 PSEs in Assam), a court decision held that the PSE was liable for any labor \n\ncost obligations between the closure of operations and the issuance of notice to employees for closure. \n\n41 A more general description of lessons by ADB is in ADB.1999. Review of ADB\u2019s Program Lending Policies. Manila. \n\n\f 10\n\ninstitutional strengthening  and  capacity  building  to  ensure effective  implementation  of  reforms, \nespecially  in  a  state  with  weak  institutional  capacity.  The  proposed  Program  would  deepen \npower sector reform efforts of the Assam Power Sector Development Program (footnote 28) and \ncomplement  the  efforts  of  other  development  agencies  that  are  increasingly  focusing  on  a \nvariety of sectors in Assam. The development coordination matrix is in Appendix 2. \n \n\nIV. \n\n THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n38. \nObjectives.  The  Program  seeks  to  further  ASG\u2019s  goal  of  sequenced  stabilization  and \nconsolidation of state finances to enhance growth and reduce poverty in Assam initiated by its \n2003  MTFRP  MOU  with  the  central  Government.  The  Program  does  so  by  supporting  a \nprogram of sustainable reduction of fiscal and revenue deficits through policy, legal, regulatory, \nand  institutional  reforms  for  (i)  creating  fiscal  resources;  (ii)  improving  utilization  and \nprioritization  of  existing  fiscal  resources;  and  (iii)  stemming  unproductive  expenditure  and \nfostering  the  quality  of  public  expenditure,  as  well  as  facilitating  alternative  opportunities  for \nprivate-sector-driven growth and employment. \n \n39. \nScope. To achieve this objective, the Program will comprise both a policy loan (program \nloan) as part of a program cluster (the Program) and a project loan. Given the balanced nature \nof  the  reforms  needed  to  address  fiscal  and  governance  constraints  and  the  medium-term \nnature of the reform process required in institutionally more challenged states like Assam, the \nprogram  loan  supports  the  first  of  two  sequential  subprograms  under  a  program  cluster \nmodality.  This  allows  for  the  realistic  delivery  of  commitments  and  a  measured  building  up  of \nmomentum  for  reform.  Subprogram  1  will  develop  a  fiscal  stabilization  and  governance \nframework  through  (i)  a  coherent  fiscal  responsibility  regime  and  performance  targets,  and \nestablishment  of  cash  management  discipline;  (ii)  key  policy  reforms  on  revenues,  nontax \nliability  containment,  expenditure  prioritization,  PSEs,  and  public \nrevenues,  pension \nadministration  rationalization;  (iii)  key  assessment  of  private  sector  development  and  public \nadministration  quality;  (iv)  key  operationalization  of  debt  restructuring  and  settlement,  PSE \nclosure,  SSN,  and  acknowledgment  and  budget  provision  for  ASEB  terminal  benefit  liabilities; \nand  (v)  institutional  development  targets  for  fiscal,  revenue,  tax,  debt,  pension,  and  employee \nadministration;  and  key  elements  of  an  ultimate  integrated  public  financial  management \ninformation  system.  This  will  establish  the  foundation  for  subprogram  2,  which  will  seek  to \ndevelop deeper fiscal consolidation and governance reforms for reorienting the role of the state \nthrough  (i)  revenue  administration  integration  synergies  and  continued  updating  of  the  MTFP; \n(ii)  implementation  of  user  fee  policy  reforms,  and  private  sector  participation  outsourcing  and \nparticipation founded on user fee reforms; (iii) debt restructuring based on enhanced public debt \nmanagement;  (iv)  parametric  reforms  regarding  state  pension  liabilities  and  automation  of  all \npension  settlement  and  payment  processes;  (v)  departmental  budget  performance  orientation; \n(vi) performance accountability and reporting for sector departments and implementation of an \nintegrated public financial MIS; (vii) PSE closures and restructuring based on implementation of \nsubprogram  1  PSE  closures  and  acknowledgement  of  ASEB  terminal  benefit  liabilities;  (viii) \ndevelopment  of  a  private  sector  facilitation  policy  and  action  plan  for  implementation;  and  (ix) \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  a  public  administration  restructuring  action  plan,  and \ncomputerization  of  salaries  and  wages  settlement  and  payment  processes.  The  maturing  of \ninstitutional  developments  needed  to  underpin  key  fiscal  reforms  will  be  sequenced  over  two \nappropriate  subprogram  implementation  periods.  The  project  loan  is  designed  to  address \ncapacity  building,  institutional  and  systems  constraints  through  consulting  services  and \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nprocurement  to  enable  accomplishment  of  fiscal  and  governance  reforms  under  the  program \nloan, and support the deeper fiscal and governance reforms of subprogram 2.  \n \nB. \n\nImportant Features \n\nfinances, \n\nfor  reform  of  public \n\nAn  important  feature  of  the  Program  is  the  application  of  the  program  cluster  within  a \n40. \nsector  development  program  modality \nthe \ncircumstances  in  Assam.  This  will  allow  a  holistic  approach  to  reform  over  the  medium  term. \nFlexibility  is  built  in  for  accelerating  performance-based  adjustment  through  an  incentive \ntranche.  In  addition  to  enabling  a  medium-term  reform  process  with  suitable  acceleration,  the \nProgram  also  carefully  addresses  the  institutional  challenges  in  Assam  by  sequencing \ninstitutional  development  prior  to  introducing  legislation,  such  as  on  fiscal  responsibility. \nParticular  attention  is  given  to  institutional  and  capacity  weaknesses  in  Assam  through  the \nprovision of the project loan, which will support institutional strengthening and capacity building. \nA chronology of program processing is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nC. \n\nThe Program Loan \n\ntailored \n\nto \n\n1. \n\nObjectives  \n\n41. \n Subprogram  1  of  the  program  cluster  aims  to  enhance  growth  and  ultimately  reduce \npoverty  by  reducing  Assam\u2019s  fiscal  and  revenue  deficits  on  a  sustainable  basis  through  fiscal \nand  governance  reforms  that  (i)  stabilize  state  finances;  and  (ii)  establish  the  foundation  for \neffective utilization, prioritization, and reorientation of public expenditures. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n42. \nSubprogram  1.  The  three  main  components  of  fiscal  and  governance  reforms  under \nsubprogram  1  are  (i)  reform  of  state  finances  to  create  fiscal  resources;  (ii)  reform  of  fiscal \ngovernance  to  improve  budget  and  expenditure  management  processes  for  better  utilization \nand prioritization of existing fiscal resources; and (iii) reorientation of the role of the state to stem \nunproductive government and public sector enterprise expenditure, improve the quality of public \nexpenditure,  and  facilitate  alternative  opportunities  for  private-sector-driven  growth  and \nemployment. \n \n43. \nThree component goals underpin the overall objective; each is met by attaining certain \noutcomes.  To  attain  the  outcomes  in  a  phased  manner,  broad  achievement  targets  are \nformulated  for  each  of  the  subprograms  and  for  each  of  the  tranches  in  the  subprogram.  To \nmeet  the  achievement  targets,  which  will  trigger  a  release  of  the  particular  tranche  of \nsubprogram  1,  specific  policy  actions  underpinning  the  achievement  need  to  be  implemented. \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  policy  letter  and  detailed  policy  matrix  (Appendix  3)  provide \nachievements and policy actions across the tranches of both subprograms of the Program. The \nprogram  framework  is  in  Appendix  4.  A  summary  table  of  commitments  by  components  and \noutcomes is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n44. \n \n\nThe three component goals and their related outcomes are \n\n(i) \n\nComponent 1: goal: reform of state finances; outcomes are \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n\nenhance fiscal responsibility, \nbroaden the tax base and enhance tax collection, \nenhance nontax revenues, \nrestructure state debt, and \n\n\f 12\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ncontain state pension liabilities; \n\n(e) \n \nComponent 2: goal: fiscal governance reforms; outcomes are \n(a) \n(b) \n\nimprove state budgeting, and \nenhance poverty-focused and growth-oriented expenditure; \n\nComponent 3: goal: reorienting the role of the state; outcomes are \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n\npublic sector enterprises reform, \nstrengthen public-private partnerships, and \npublic administration review. \n\na. \n\nComponent 1: Reform of State Finances \n\ni. \n\nEnhance Fiscal Responsibility \n\n45.  Medium-Term Fiscal Plan. Addressing ASG\u2019s fiscal constraints requires the Program to \nset  the  foundation  stones  for  a  fiscal  responsibility  regime  that  introduces  key  fiscal  prudence \nchecks and balances. A critical element is the formulation, adoption, and implementation of an \nMTFP.  An  MTFP  would  link  integrated  fiscal  and  governance  reform  measures  to  the \nachievement  of  fiscal  projection  target  outcomes  to  create  sustainable  fiscal  resources  over  a \nmedium-term time frame.  \n \n46. \nThe  MTFP  fiscal  projection  targets  for  creating  sustainable  fiscal  resources  under  the \nProgram are designed to achieve (i) at least two percentage points reduction in revenue deficit \nto revenue receipts ratio on average per annum from FY2005 to FY2009; (ii) a gradual increase \nin  the  capital  outlay  to  GSDP  ratio  from  1.5%  to  2.5%,  subject  to  absorptive  capacity;  (iii)  a \nsustainable  revenue  surplus  by  FY2008;  and  (iv)  a  significant  reduction  in  the  debt  to  GSDP \nratio  from  40%  to  37%  by  FY2009.  The  MTFP  will  measure  projections  through  a  single \nindicator (revenue deficit to revenue receipts ratio). This indicator is proposed under the central \nGovernment\u2019s Fiscal Reform Facility to monitor and evaluate overall reduction of fiscal stress by \ncapturing  key  off-budget  impacts.  However,  since  Assam  is  a  Special  Category  State  with \nsignificant  dependence  on  the  central  Government  for  its  resources,  the  MTFP  should  also \nfocus  on  multidimensional  fiscal  performance  indicators,  including  revenue  deficit  to  own \nrevenue,  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  purposes.  These  reform  scenario  projection  targets, \nprepared  in  consultation  with  ASG  and  the  central  Government,  will  form  inputs  into  ASG\u2019s \nFY2007  and  FY2008  budgets  in  the  context  of  a  medium-term  fiscal  consolidation  framework \nthrough FY2009. The MTFP is in Appendix 5, and the key assumptions underpinning the MTFP \nare in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n47. \nFiscal  Responsibility  Legislation.  Given  the  pressures  on  state  finances,  the \nestablishment  of  a  fiscal-enabling  framework  introducing  transparent  and  accountable  fiscal \ndiscipline will need to be legislatively embedded after careful calibration of targets predicated on \nserious multiyear plans that translate targets into realistic strategies. The Program will support \nintroduction of a fiscal responsibility bill after due examination of fiscal targets under the MTFP. \nThe  up-front  adoption  of  MTFP  fiscal  projection  targets  under  subprogram  1,  which  will  be \nreviewed on a regular basis, will enable updating of the targets based on new information. Thus \nin due course the awards of the 12th Finance Commission will be incorporated into subsequent \nMTFP  updates.  Eventually,  having  tested  the  MTFP  over  the  course  of  a  state  budget  cycle, \nASG will introduce a fiscal responsibility bill by the incentive tranche of subprogram 1 and take \nall steps for its adoption. This legislation will establish a fiscal constitution for the state, including \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nquantitative and time-bound targets for fiscal and revenue deficits,42 multiyear budget forecasts \nin line with these targets, regular reporting requirements of performance against these targets, \nand requirements on off-budget liabilities and guarantees.  \n \n48. \nFiscal Management Unit. For a fiscal responsibility regime to be effective, regular and \ndetailed monitoring of fiscal targets is essential. Under the Program, ASG will establish a fiscal \nmanagement unit (FMU) in the ASG Finance Department to act as the secretariat for a program \nsteering committee. The FMU will provide institutional support for managing fiscal responsibility \nwith regular monitoring, evaluation, follow-up, and remedial action, and reporting of MTFP fiscal \nprojection  targets.  Buttressed  by  skills  and  systems  development,  the  role  of  the  FMU\u2019s  five \nreform  cells\u2014revenue  reform,  expenditure  reform,  budget  reform,  pension  reform,  and  debt \nmanagement\u2014will enable the FMU to act as a key driver of institutional reforms such as (i) debt \nmanagement  with  the  sourcing  of  loan  data  information;  and  (ii)  management  of  central \ntransfers, including recording, monitoring, and evaluating the utilization of central transfers. This, \nin turn, will strengthen the basis for the FMU to undertake quarterly MTFP review and remedial \naction  reports  for  monitoring,  evaluating,  and  follow-up  of  MTFP  performance  indicators  on \nrevenues,  expenditure,  debt,  central  transfers,  subsidies,  and  cost  recovery.  The  successful \nestablishment  and  operationalization  of  the  FMU  under  subprogram  1  will  form  the  basis  of \neffective  monitoring  and  compliance  with \nin \nsubprogram 2.  \n \n49. \nCash  Management  Reform.  To  instill  fiscal  prudence  and  responsibility  in  cash \nmanagement as part of the Program\u2019s overall fiscal responsibility against the backdrop of state \nrecourse to expensive ways and means advances and overdrafts, ASG will commit to adopting \na policy of not resorting to overdrafts with the Reserve Bank of India so as to ensure that there \nare  no  year-end  negative  cash  balances.  Subprogram  1  will  support  this  commitment  by \nproviding  one-time  adjustment  cost  support  for  ASG\u2019s  existing  negative  cash  balance  for \nFY2006,  and  introducing  key  elements  of  a  public  financial  MIS  as  part  of  fiscal  governance \nreforms. \n \n\nlegislation  provisions \n\nfiscal  responsibility \n\nii. \n\nBroaden the Tax Base and Enhance Tax Collection \n\nTax Policy Reforms. Given the current constraints on revenue enhancement, ASG will \n50. \nneed  to  adopt  certain  revenue  measures  under  subprogram  1,  as  part  of  a  package  of  fiscal \nmeasures designed to achieve the MTFP fiscal projection targets. These revenue measures will \nneed to focus on (i) widening the tax base rather than increasing tax rates, to bring economic \nactivities  that  are  currently  exempted  within  the  scope  of  the  tax  system;  (ii)  increasing  tax \nbuoyancy  linked  to  higher  GSDP;  and  (iii)  reducing  incentives  for  tax  evasion  rather  than \nthrough imposing taxes ad hoc, which may adversely affect the growth of GSDP. Consequently, \nthe Program will entail tax policy reforms for major taxes, such as, sales tax, excise, stamp, and \nagricultural  taxes  in  accordance  with  such  policy  parameters.  Tax  policy  measures  will  be \ndeveloped under the aegis of the FMU\u2019s revenue reform cell, which will be mandated to prepare \nand monitor the development of tax policy measures agreed under the policy matrix. \n \nSales  Tax.  Against  the  backdrop  of  a  marginal  rise  in  recent  growth  and  a  narrow  tax \n51. \nbase for sales tax, critical policy actions under subprogram 1 will entail (i) up-front commitment \nto overall policy direction to a VAT or stand-alone VAT equivalent system by the first tranche; \nand (ii) introduction of a VAT or stand-alone VAT equivalent law by the incentive tranche. In so \ndoing,  subprogram  1  will  build  on  ASG  commitment  to  move  toward  introducing  a  VAT \namendment  law  in  line  with  a  national  consensus  on  rate  harmonization,  or  if  the  national \n                                                 \n42 These targets will be subject to exceptions for exogenous circumstances outside ASG control. \n\n\f 14\n\nconsensus fails to emerge, introducing a VAT equivalent law on a stand-alone basis in advance \nof state elections due in 2006. This indicates the acceptance of the compelling logic of VAT by \nthe state irrespective of rate harmonization in terms of ensuring a broadening of the tax base by \nmoving  beyond  a  first  point  of  sale  tax  system,  and  establishing  a  destination-based  tax  that \neliminates  the  cascading  effect  of  sales  tax  linked  to  different  stages  of  production  and \ndistribution. \n \n52. \nExcise. Promoting best practices in the levy of excise will help capture price rises as a \nresult  of  inflation.  The  introduction  of  competitiveness  in  the  collection  of  excise  will  enhance \nrevenues  and  improve  the  long-term  buoyancy  of  excise  duties.  Consequently,  under \nsubprogram 1, critical policy actions on excise enhancement will entail (i) commitment to overall \npolicy direction to a less discretionary and more competitive excise system by the first tranche; \nand  (ii)  introduction  of  amendments  to  the  Excise  Act  for  ad  valorem  excise  duty  on  Indian-\nmade foreign liquor by the incentive tranche, and an alternative competitive method of collection \nof excise for country spirits by the second tranche. \n \nStamp  Duties  and  Registration  Fees.  Given  concerns  for  underlying  property \n53. \nundervaluation  for  stamps  and  registration  fees  under  subprogram  1,  commitment  to  overall \npolicy direction for an objective method of underlying property valuation in the first tranche will \nbe followed by adoption and operationalization of an objective valuation method by the second \ntranche. This will improve fairness and transparency, while reducing vulnerability to corruption. \n \n54. \nAgricultural  Income  Tax.  Policy  actions  under  subprogram  1  seek  to  counteract  the \ndecline in buoyancy and total tax collection of the potentially important  agricultural income tax \nrelated  to  the  local  tea  industry  by  stipulating  a  reduction  in  the  peak  rate  consistent  with \nbusiness income. This is designed to counter the incentive to understate the composite income \nand transfer part of the proceeds from agriculture to pure business income.  \n \nTax  and  Revenue  Administration.  To  address  fiscal  constraints  on  tax  collection \n55. \ninefficiencies  that  can  undermine  sustainable  revenue  increases,  substantial  tax  and  revenue \nadministration  actions  will  be  required.  The  introduction  of  tax  policy  reform  measures  under \nsubprogram  1,  such  as  a  VAT  equivalent  system,  ad  valorem  excise  duty,  and  objective \nproperty  valuation  for  stamps  and  registration  fees,  will  need  to  be  accompanied  by  tax  and \nrevenue  administration  measures  under  subprogram  1  if  the  tax  policy  reform  measure  gains \nare  to  be  achieved.  In  sequencing  terms,  subprogram  1  acknowledges  ASG\u2019s  capacity  and \nsystems  needs  in  designing  a  phased  introduction  of  tax  administration  reforms  for  sales  tax, \nexcise,  motor  vehicles,  and  stamps  and  registration  fees  commencing  with  commitment  to \noverall  policy  direction  in  the  first  tranche.  The  specific  tax  administration  measures,  specific \nrevenue  administration  measures  (composite  check  posts),  and  supportive  tax  administration \nmeasures  under  an  action  plan  for  development  of  validating  management  information  to \nsupport  composite  check  posts  will  be  spearheaded  by  the  FMU\u2019s  revenue  reform  cell  under \nsubprogram  1.  This  is  designed  to  eventually  lead  to  a  unified  and  integrated  revenue \nadministration system under subprogram 2.  \n \nTax policy is only as good as its corollary tax administration. To maximize VAT tax policy \n56. \ngains,  substantive  sales  tax  administration  measures  under  subprogram  1  will  focus  on  four \nareas. First, sales tax will be functionally reorganized, moving away from the current geographic \norganization  to  increase  the  effectiveness  and  efficiencies  of  tax  compliance.  Sales  tax \nadministration  will  be  aligned  with  the  introduction  of  a  VAT  equivalent  system.  Information \ntechnology  and  modern  process  engineering  will  be  introduced  that  is  capable  of  providing \naccurate, timely, and sufficient tax information and clear tax assessment arrears. Second, sales \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ntax  administration  measures  will  focus  on  a  risk-based  assessment  role  that  will  balance \nconcerns  on  identification  and  penalization  of  tax  evaders  and  late  filers  with  a  voluntary \ncompliance  taxpayer-friendly  system.  Third,  performance  management  and  other  human \nresource  management  tools  will  be  employed  as  incentives  to  improve  performance  of  tax \nadministration staff. Fourth, an MIS for sales tax, including dealer registration, will be developed.  \n \n57. \nTo  counter  the  vulnerability  of  excise  duties  to  crossborder  smuggling  based  on  rate \ndifferentials and to ensure that the revenue gains of ad valorem levy are attained, subprogram 1 \nwill  target  functional  reorganization  of  excise  enforcement,  and  enhancement  of  excise \nenforcement and monitoring procedures and excise MIS. \n \n58. \n Subprogram 1 will establish composite check posts linked to automated processing and \nsystems  for  various  tax  regimes.  These  composite  check  posts  will  be  designed  to  provide  a \ncommon  tax  administration  facility  to  reduce  corruption,  effectively  control  border  evasion  of \ntaxes,  track  noncompliant  taxpayers,  and  impose  penalties.  In  addition,  common  taxpayer-\nfriendly  information  will  be  developed  as  part  of  revenue  administration  at  such  check  posts, \nthereby  reducing  duplicative  citizen  compliance  costs.  This  will  form  the  foundation  for \ndevelopment of integrated systems and institutional structures for accountable, transparent, and \nperformance-based revenue administration under subprogram 2.  \n \nFiscal  Empowerment  of  Local  Governments  Given  the  state  of  ASG  finances,  local \n59. \ngovernments  in  Assam  cannot  effectively  discharge  their  responsibilities  under  constitutionally \nmandated  legislation,  notwithstanding  recent  panchayat  (local  body)  elections  in  Assam. \nBuilding  on  the  thrust  of  Assam\u2019s  Second  State  Finance  Commission  report,  subprogram  1 \nfocuses on developing local fiscal empowerment, culminating with approval of unit area method-\nbased property tax to provide financing of local bodies by the second tranche.  \n \n\niii. \n\nEnhance Nontax Revenues \n\n60. \nUser  Charges.  To  address  the  poor  performance  of  state-determined  user  charges  in \nAssam, while taking account of potential opposition to the introduction of commercial discipline \nto nonpaying customers and improvement of cost recovery in the public sector, under the first \ntranche of subprogram 1, the affordability, service quality, and feasibility43 of increases in user \ncharges  for  a  cross  section  of  significant  sectors  such  as  health,  transport,  water  supply,  and \neducation will be reviewed. In this review, principles of cost recovery and commercial discipline \nwill be applied, balanced by requirements of improved service delivery and targeted protection \nfor  the  poor.  By  the  second  tranche  of  subprogram  1,  ASG  will  approve  certain  measures  to \ninitiate  the  enhancement  of  user  charges  as  indicated  in  the  policy  matrix.  These  methods  of \ncost recovery and institutional reforms to improve collection efficiency under subprogram 1 will \nbe  implemented  and  form  the  basis  for  enhanced  service  delivery  through  private  sector \nparticipation under subprogram 2. \n \n\niv. \n\nRestructure State Debt \n\nDebt  Restructuring.  To  contain  the  substantial  high  interest  debt  burden  on  the  state \n61. \nfor creating critical fiscal resources in accordance with the MTFP beyond the agreement in the \nMTFRP MOU, ASG must focus on substantial swapping and settlement of previous state debt. \nConsequently, under subprogram 1, ASG will undertake (i) a swap of high-cost, small savings \nloans availed of from the central Government with lower cost loans; and (ii) settlement of high \n                                                 \n43  Economics and Research Department, ADB. 2003. Setting User Charges for Public Services: Policies and Practice \n\nat ADB. Technical Note Series 9. Manila.  \n\n\f 16\n\ninterest institutional loans.44 The debt swap will entail (i) small savings being collected in Assam; \n(ii) small savings being transferred to the National Small Savings Fund and being provided by \nthe central Government as National Small Savings Fund small savings loans to ASG; and (iii) a \npart  of  such  small  savings  loans  being  retained  by  the  central  Government  to  provide  a  debt \nswap for the earlier high-cost small savings loans to ASG with interest in excess of 12%. The \nproportion of the small savings loans that can be used to prepay earlier costlier debt was 20% \nfor FY2003, 30% in FY2004, and will be 40% in FY2005. Depending on the quantum of small \nsavings  loans  that  can  be  used  to  prepay  the  earlier  higher  cost  debt,  a  matching  amount  for \nsuch debt swapping is also permitted by the central Government by way of market borrowings. \nBased  on  crystallized  and  documented  negotiation  with  banks  and  financial  institutions,  ASG \nwill  reduce  identified  high-interest  debt  by  settling  such  institutional  loans  to  PSEs  and  other \nentities. The Program provides earmarked adjustment cost support for such debt settlement. \n \nDebt  Management.  To  ensure  the  sustainability  of  fiscal  resources  created  by  debt \n62. \nrestructuring  in  Assam,  such  debt  restructuring  will  need  to  be  accompanied  by  institutional \nsupport  and  process  performance  benchmarks  for  public  debt  management.  Consequently,  in \nsubprogram 1, ASG will undertake several key measures through the FMU\u2019s debt management \ncell.  Under  the  first  and  second  tranches,  the  buildup  and  establishment  of  an  automated \ncomprehensive  loan  database  of  government  and  government  guaranteed  borrowing  and \nonlending  will  be  sequenced.  This  database,  which  will  include  an  inventory  of  all  terms  of \nborrowing,  maturity,  loan  amount,  source,  debt-servicing  dates,  outstanding  balances,  and \nguarantees, will address the currently fragmented nature of debt data requiring ASG to rely on \ninformation provided by the Reserve Bank of India and Comptroller and Auditor General. Such a \nloan  and  guarantees  database,  linked  to  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  will  enable  the  FMU  to \ngenerate periodic MIS reports for ASG related to the MTFP, including any compliance report of \nthe  MTFP  to  the  Cabinet  that  would  precede  enactment  of  a  fiscal  responsibility  act.  By \nrecording  and  reporting  guarantees  made  and  discharged,  the  database  will  also  enable \nsystematic  risk  analyses  to  be  undertaken  on  ASG\u2019s  contingent  liabilities  for  evaluating  and \nmonitoring the risk of these guarantees, and undertaking necessary follow-up action. In addition, \nsubprogram 1 will ensure that a loan procedures and systems manual is developed based on an \naudit of loan procedures, and administrative circulars and orders on public sector borrowing to \nembed process benchmarks. In subprogram 2, this debt-restructuring and management strategy \nwill continue targeted reduction of debt servicing in accordance with the MTFP.  \n \n\nv. \n\nContain State Pension Liabilities \n\nAgainst  the  background  of  burgeoning  unfunded  state  pension  liabilities,  no  reliable \n63. \nestimation  of  pension  liabilities  is  available,  no  pension  policy  framework  is  in  use  to  contain \nfuture  liabilities,  and  no  pension  administration  is  in  place  to  ensure  pension  processing \ndiscipline  and  mitigate  forecasting  difficulties  on  future  liability  requirements.  To  assess  the \nextent of  vulnerability of the state\u2019s public finance system resulting from the current system of \npension  payments,  ASG  will  complete  an  actuarial  estimation  of  total  pension  liabilities  by  the \nsecond  tranche  of  subprogram  1,  based  on  full  employee  and  pension  data,  MTFP  policy \nassumptions,  and  a  75-year  estimation  for  projections  given  that  pension  reform  will  take  at \nleast  50  years  to  yield  desired  results.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  completion  of  this  actuarial \nestimation of Assam\u2019s pension liability will be accompanied by the introduction of pension policy \nreform. Pension liability estimation will be accomplished under a time-bound action plan of the \nFMU  pension  reform  cell.  Pension  policy  and  administration  reforms  agreed  under  the  policy \nmatrix will also be developed under the aegis of the FMU pension reform cell. \n                                                 \n44  Such  high  interest  institutional  loans  to  PSEs  and  other  entities  guaranteed  by  ASG  do  not  include  one-time \n\nsettlement of government guaranteed loans to PSEs identified for closure (para. 73). \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \nIn  terms  of  pension  policy  reform,  ASG  will  address  the  issue  of  rising  pension \n64. \nexpenditure as part of revenue expenditures under subprogram 1. ASG will commit up front to \nan overall policy direction on (i) parametric reform options to contain the cost of the current pay-\nas-you-go  system  for  the  current  stock  of  government  employees;45  and  (ii)  commitment  to \nsystemic  reforms  in  terms  of  shifting  to  a  pension  scheme  for  new  government  employees \naligned  to  one  announced  by  the  central  Government,  which  will  be  cheaper  and  less  fiscally \nrisky than the current pension scheme for government employees. By the incentive tranche of \nsubprogram  1,  ASG  will  approve  systemic  reform  for  new  government  employee  pensions \nbased  on  employee  and  employer  contributions.  Under  subprogram  1,  initial  earmarked \nadjustment  cost  support  for  this  systemic  change  will  be  provided.  Further  earmarked \nadjustment cost support for such major systemic change and introduction of parametric reforms \nwill then be considered under subprogram 2.  \n \n65. \nIn  terms  of  pension  administration  reform,  under  subprogram  1,  ASG  will  mitigate  the \npension  data  weaknesses  in  forecasting  pension  liability  and  the  consequent  gaps  between \nactual expenditure and budgeted estimates and opportunity for abuse of the pensions system, \nby establishing a pension database by the second tranche.  \n \n\nb. \n\nComponent 2: Fiscal Governance Reforms \n\n \n66. \nImprove  State  Budgeting.  Currently,  ASG  operates  a  traditional  state budget  system, \nwhich is endemically overstretched in terms of a plethora of initiatives that are underfunded and \nsystemically overoptimistic in terms of budget revenue estimates as opposed to actuals. Under \nsubprogram  1,  ASG  will  seek  to  realign  state  budgeting  commensurate  with  the  needs  of \nenhanced  fiscal  responsibility.  First,  ASG  will  address  transparency  in  state  budget  planning, \npreparation, and presentation to contain factors that may distort or limit state budget data and \nthereby affect the quality and comprehensiveness of fiscal data required for fiscal adjustments \nunder  the  MTFP  and  ultimately  the  state\u2019s  fiscal  responsibility  act.  Consequently,  by  the \nincentive tranche of subprogram 1, ASG will adopt operating guidelines on transparency in state \nbudgeting  that  will  govern  items  such  as  off-budget  borrowings  and  contingent  liabilities  with \nregard  to  PSEs,  PSE  losses  and  subsidies,  and  salary  and  pension  arrears.  Second,  under \nsubprogram  1,  ASG  will  (i)  build  medium-term  planning  over  a  3-  to  5-year  time  horizon  into \nstate  budget  planning,  preparation,  and  presentation  to  foster  revenue  forecasting  that  is  not \noveroptimistic; (ii) strengthen the budget expenditure information for MTFP targets and rigorous \ncapital  expenditure  priorities  over  the  medium  term;  as  well  as  (iii)  enhance  the  scrutiny  of \nexpenditures consistent with the resource envelope for containing unrealistic and overoptimistic \nbudget  revenue  estimates  and  arrears  on  bills  and  dues.  ASG  will  do  this  by  incorporating \nupdated MTFP projections for revenue and expenditure into the state budget.  \n \nUnder  subprogram  1,  ASG  will  align  state  budget  reporting  to  MTFP  targets  and \n67. \nremedial  action  reporting  needs  in  two  ways.  First,  ASG  will,  by  the  second  tranche,  build  on \ntransparency  in  budget  data  presentation  to  foster  transparency  in  state  budget  reporting \nthrough  submission  of  state  budget  semiannual  reports  that  include  all  key  fiscal  information \nrelevant  to  measurement  against  the  fiscal  responsibility  bill  (FRB)  fiscal  performance \n\n                                                 \n45  Parametric reform options include consideration of (i) gradual changes to the commutation factor by increasing the \nunderlying interest rate to reflect the true rate of government borrowing; (ii) a change in the base salary from the \nlast  10  months  average  pay  to  the  last  3  years;  and  (iii)  changes  related  to  the  decoupling  of  pensions  from  the \nsalaries  of  serving  employees.  The  current  pension  scheme  for  government  employees  in  Assam  is  a  defined \nbenefit system where the pension is available after qualifying in terms of years of service, is commutable, and is \ndetermined using a wage reference. \n\n\f 18\n\nindicators. Second, in terms of the comprehensiveness of state budget reporting, particularly in \nlight of reliance on central transfers, ASG will, in a phased manner, complete an inventory of all \ncentral schemes and report their up-to-date status and funding requirements through the state \nbudget. These reforms in state budget planning, preparation, presentation, and reporting, to be \ndeveloped  by  the  FMU\u2019s  budget  reform  cell,  will  form  the  basis  for  subprogram  2  indicative \ntargets of performance-orientated budgeting at the department level.  \n \n68. \nThe inventory of central transfers will be accomplished under a time-bound action plan of \nthe  FMU\u2019s  budget  reform  cell.  Under  such  an  action  plan,  the  budget  reform  cell  will  be \nmandated  to  annually  estimate  counterpart  funding  needs  and  determine  annual  funds \nutilization  of  ASG  departments.  Budget  planning,  preparation,  and  presentation,  and  budget \nreporting measures agreed under the policy matrix will be developed by the budget reform cell. \n \nEnhance  Poverty-Focused  and  Growth-Oriented  Expenditure.  ASG\u2019s  current \n69. \nexpenditure  management  framework  does  not  appropriately  serve  the  effectiveness  of \ngovernment spending of existing resources focused on poverty reduction and growth consistent \nwith the MTFP targets. In terms of capital expenditures, ASG will therefore undertake two key \npolicy actions under the Program. First, given gradual increases in repressed or skewed capital \noutlay  under  the  MTFP,  ASG  will  undertake  a  rationalization  of  the  existing  portfolio  of \ndevelopment  projects  in  Assam  so  that  capital  expenditures  are  directed  through  objective \nprioritization criteria for sectors and schemes that have the most direct impact on the poor or in \nterms of GSDP growth. An ineffective spread of capital expenditure over too many projects will \nthereby  be  avoided.  This  will  result  in  a  core  investment  program  of  development  projects \nselected  in  accordance  with  objective  prioritization  criteria  that  will  underpin  the  MTFP  capital \nexpenditure  targets  adopted  in  the  state  budget  as  of  FY2008.  Second,  to  support  the  MTFP \ncapital expenditure targets as adopted in the state budget of FY2008, ASG will ensure related \noperation and maintenance expenditure targets are incorporated in the state budget by FY2008.   \n \nUnder  subprogram  1,  ASG  will  promote  the  quality  of  public  expenditure  in  terms  of \n70. \ncompliance  with  medium-term  fiscal  planning  and  legislatively  mandated  fiscal  responsibility \ntargets, disciplined cash management, and timely responsiveness to audits by establishing key \nelements  of  a  public  financial  MIS,  in  terms  of  reliable  and  comprehensive  employee  and \npensions  data,  treasury  and  payments  information  technology  procurement,  and  state-wide \nuniform  procurement  standards.  These  reforms  will  form  the  foundation  for  subprogram  2  to \nimplement the core investment program and operation and maintenance targets supplemented \nby  published  departmental  performance  reports  based  on  core  investment  program  and \noperation  and  maintenance  performance  indicators,  and  supported  by  implementation  of  an \nintegrated public financial MIS. \n \n71. \nCapital and operation and maintenance expenditure reforms and financial management, \nTreasury  payments,  and  procurement  reform  measures  agreed  under  the  policy  matrix  will  be \ndeveloped by the FMU\u2019s expenditure reform cell. \n \n\nc. \n\nComponent 3: Reorienting the Role of the State \n\n \n72. \nPublic  Sector  Enterprises  Reform.  A  review  of  the  PSE  sector  in  Assam  shows  a \npersistently widespread picture of unproductive investments, accumulation of losses, and a slow \nbut steady leakage of public funds from ASG to the PSEs. This may be partly attributed to the \nabsence  of  a  comprehensive  enabling  framework  that  examines  PSEs  beyond  the  immediate \nfiscal imperative in terms of restraint on government activity with no public policy justification. It \ncan  also  be  attributed  to  the  absence  of  a  focused  transactional  program  of  PSE  closure  and \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nrestructuring.  Under  subprogram  1,  ASG  will  undertake  four  key  policy  actions  related  to  the \nenabling  framework  and  transactional  support  for  PSE  reform  to  stem  unproductive  public \nexpenditure  and  contain  the  buildup  of  future  liabilities  and  budgetary  support  for  loss-making \nPSEs, as well as embed the foundation for fundamental restructuring of certain PSEs.  \n \nFirst,  the  Program  will  develop  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  for  ASG  oversight \n73. \nover its PSE investments and conduct of PSE reform. Under subprogram 1, ASG will (i) adopt \nup front a comprehensive PSE reform policy designed to provide a governance framework for \nclosure, restructuring, divestment, SSN, corporate governance, and accountability of PSEs; and \n(ii) establish a PSE reform committee and mandate the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) \nas the nodal agency for PSE reforms with subsequent measurable and transparent publication \nof PSE-related information by DPE. Second, under subprogram 1, the  Program will undertake \ntransactional  support  for  closure  of  at  least  seven  identified  loss-making  PSEs46  through  one-\ntime  settlement  of  government  guaranteed  loans  to  such  PSEs.  Subject  to  completion  of \naccounting  arrears  and  asset  valuation,  initiation  of  the  closure  process  for  such  PSEs  will \ncontain ASG financial exposure to the loss-making PSEs. Third, under subprogram 1, ASG will \npromote PSE restructuring by (i) ASG acknowledgement of unfunded terminal benefit liabilities \nof  ASEB,  including  ASG\u2019s  budget  reflection  of  such  liabilities  to  complement  the  transparent \nacceptance of net ASEB liabilities under the Assam Power Sector Development Program; and \n(ii)  approving  and  issuing  corporate  and  financial  governance  rules  and  regulations  for  PSEs, \nincluding MOUs between ASG and identified PSEs whose financial and operating performance \nand corporate conduct warrant eventual restructuring or divestment. Finally, under subprogram \n1, ASG will, in a phased manner, design and fully implement a SSN program for employees of \nPSEs  to  be  closed.  The  SSN  program  will  provide  communications,  training,  financing,  and \nvocational  and  financial  counseling.  The  adjustment  costs  related  to  mitigation  of  such  PSE \nreforms  in  terms  of  a  VRS  and  SSN  will  be  supported  through  earmarked  funds.  These  key \nactions under subprogram 1 will be the basis for further PSE closure and restructuring support \nunder subprogram 2. \n \n74. \nStrengthen  Public-Private  Partnerships.  To  redress  the  shrinking  employment  and \ndelivery  of  public  goods  and  services  from  the  unsustainably  poor  performance  of  PSEs  in \nAssam, ASG\u2019s role must shift from provider of goods and services to facilitator, and the private \nsector must provide alternative employment and services. Consequently, under subprogram 1, \nat  a  policy  level,  ASG  will  (i)  establish  a  public-private  task  force  to  review  impediments  to \npromoting  private  investment,  such  as  rationalization  of  labor,  environmental  and  business \nestablishment-related laws, inspection procedures, licensing and regulations, and single-window \nclearance  facilities;  and  (ii)  formally  review  the  report  of  the  task  force.  Second,  at  an \ninstitutional level, ASG will (i) establish a business incubation unit and a skills development and \nplacement  unit  in  DPE  to  outsource  services  development  and  employment  training;  (ii) \noperationalize these units as part of the SSN program with PSEs; and (iii) formally review the \nfunctioning  of  these  units  in  terms  of  outcomes.  The  policy  and  institutional  actions  in \nsubprogram 1 will form the basis for indicative targets in subprogram 2 in terms of adoption of a \nprivate sector facilitation policy and related time-bound action plans.  \n \nPublic Administration Review. Given the fiscal stress caused by the size of the state \n75. \ncivil service and its salaries, under subprogram 1, key public administration rationalization policy \nactions will be undertaken to address ASG wages and salaries. ASG will adopt up front a public \nadministration  rationalization  policy  under  which  two  key  actions  will  be  taken.  First,  a \n\n                                                 \n46  The  seven  PSEs  may  include  (i)  Assam  Conductors  and  Tubes;  (ii)  Assam  Cooperative  Sugar  Mills;  (iii)  Assam \nSpun  Silk  Mills;  (iv)  Assam  State  Minor  Irrigation  Development  Corporation;  (v)  Assam  State  Weaving  and \nManufacturing Company; (vi) Cachar Sugar Mills; and (vii) Fertichem. \n\n\f 20\n\nreplacement rate to attrition of ASG employees of 70% will be set on average for all government \ndepartments throughout the Program as part of the MTFP. To the extent the 70% replacement \nratio  is  not  met,  ASG  will  adopt  other  fiscal  measures  to  meet  the  key  fiscal  indicators  of  the \nMTFP  for  that  year47  and  will  meet  an  average  of  70%  over  that  and  the  subsequent  year. \nSecond,  under  the  public  administration  rationalization  policy,  ASG  will  enable  departmental \nreplacement  or  recruitment  in  accordance  with  functional  reviews  to  entitle  departments  to \nrecruit  replacement  staff  at  higher  levels  than  those  retiring  if  the  skills  sets  of  those \ndepartments so requires.  \n \nIn  light  of  the  poor  performance  of  ASG\u2019s  public  administration,  under  subprogram  1, \n76. \nASG will address the quality of public expenditure on public administration by preparing a public \nadministration quality assessment to address two key areas related to (i) functional reviews of \nselected departments of ASG to determine an efficient and optimal mix of skill sets for improved \npersonnel  management  and  performance  orientation;48  and  (ii)  enhancement  of  anticorruption \nprocedures  and  mechanisms  for  improved  corruption  prevention  and  investigation  through \npublic expenditure tracking surveys in selected departments of ASG, as well as a review of the \nexisting anticorruption mechanisms of the state.49  \n \nAs  indicated  in  ADB\u2019s  participatory  poverty  assessment  for  Assam  in  2003,50  poor \n77. \nmanagement of public institutions responsible for service delivery is a major cause of poverty. \nThus improving public administration quality will have a direct impact on poverty reduction.  \n \n78. \nFinally,  under  subprogram  1,  ASG  will  address  the  institutional  aspects  of  public \nadministration reform by developing a comprehensive and reliable employee database that will \nprevent  abuse  of  the  employment  system  and  form  a  cornerstone  of  reliable  expenditure \nforecasting  for  the  MTFP  and  a  critical  pillar  of  a  public  financial  MIS  for  improved  fiscal \ngovernance. The subprogram 1 reforms will form the basis for subprogram 2 implementation of \na  public  administration  restructuring  action  plan  and  a  performance  accountability  system  for \ngovernment employees. \n  \n\n \n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nProgram  Loan  Amount,  Terms,  and  Conditions.  The  Program  adopts  a  cluster \n79. \napproach comprising subprograms 1 and 2 totaling $225 million. The Government of India has \nrequested a loan of $125 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance the \ncost  of  reforms  under  subprogram  1  of  the  Program.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75% \nper  annum  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The central Government will bear the exchange risk on the \nloan,  and  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  ASG.  The  Government\u2019s  current  policy  of \nassistance to a Special Category State like Assam is a grant-loan ratio of 90:10. The program \ncosts schedule is in Appendix 6. \n\n                                                 \n47 There is a need to be realistic about the extent to which alternative measures could generate offsets. \n48  Functional  reviews  and  reviews  of  anticorruption  mechanisms  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Assam  Administrative \nReforms Commission, building on work already commenced by the Assam Administrative Reforms Commission. \n\n49  Public expenditure tracking surveys will be undertaken by the expenditure reform cell of the FMU. \n50 ADB. 2002. Participatory Poverty Assessment II. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nProgram  Cost.  Program  implementation  will  involve  structural  adjustment  costs \n\n \n80. \ntentatively estimated at $347 million51 during almost 5 years. The main components are \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nstate debt restructuring costs ($159 million), \ncost of cash management reform ($20 million), \ncost of containing pension liabilities ($30 million), and  \nPSE reform costs ($138 million). \n\n \nThe  total  adjustment  costs  for  subprogram  I  amount  to  $247  million  of  which  (i)  $111 \n81. \nmillion is for debt swaps under the central Government\u2019s scheme, (ii) $13 million for settlement \nof guaranteed loans of PSEs, (iii) $35 million for debt settlement or debt swaps of high interest \nfinancial  institution  and  bank  loans,  (iv)  $20  million  for  cash  management  reforms,  (v)  $30 \nmillion for settlement of outstanding liabilities of PSEs, (vi) $28 million for ASEB terminal benefit \nliabilities, and (vii) $10 million for the new ASG employee pension scheme. \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\n82. \nExecution  and  Implementation  Arrangements.  ASG  will  be  responsible  for  the \neffective  administration  and  utilization  of  program  loan  proceeds  and  the  counterpart  funds. \nASG  will  appoint  the  Finance  Department  as  the  Executing  Agency.  The  program  steering \ncommittee  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  policy \napprovals of the Program and will assist the Finance Department and report to the chief minister \nand the Cabinet on the Program. The steering committee will be headed by the chief secretary \nand will include all principal secretaries and commissioners of departments participating under \nthe Program as well as the Finance Department.   \n \n83. \nA  state-level  empowered  committee,  chaired  by  an  additional  chief  secretary  and \ncomprising all principal secretaries and commissioners of departments incurring material public \nexpenditure, will monitor public administration review requirements under the Program. A PSE \nreform  committee  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  progress  of  PSE  reforms  under  the \nProgram. The PSE reform committee will be chaired by an additional chief secretary and include \nall  principal  secretaries  and  commissioners  of  line  departments  responsible  for  PSEs,  PSE \nrepresentatives,  as  well  as  DPE  and  the  Finance  Department.  DPE  will  be  the  committee\u2019s \nsecretariat.  A  public-private  partnership  task  force  consisting  of  labor,  management,  private \nsector, civil society, and ASG representatives, will be responsible for developing policy actions \nfor  private  sector  facilitation  and  alternative  business  and  employment  opportunities  in  the \nprivate sector. It will report to the PSE reform committee. The program steering committee, the \nstate-level  empowered  committee,  PSE  reform  committee,  and  public-private  task  force  will \nmeet at least quarterly. \n \n84. \nASG  will  establish  the  FMU  in  the  Finance  Department  under  the  program  steering \ncommittee.  The  FMU  will  undertake  management  of  fiscal  responsibility,  debt,  and  central \ntransfers, and be responsible for daily implementation of the Program under the guidance of the \nsteering  committee.  The  FMU  will  coordinate  with  ADB  and  various  stakeholders  and  solicit \nfeedback from experts from within and outside Assam on a regular basis. The responsibilities of \nthe  five  FMU  reform  cells  (para.  48)  are  outlined  in  the  policy  matrix.  The  program \nimplementation organization chart is in Appendix 7.   \n                                                 \n51  Subprogram 2 will likely have additional ASG-borne adjustment costs. \n\n\f 22\n\n \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n85. \nSubprogram 1 is expected to be completed in about 2.5 years from December 2004 to \nJune 2007 taking due account of the state electoral calendar in 2006. Based on progress under \nsubprogram 1, the proposal for subprogram 2 is expected  to be submitted for separate Board \nconsideration before the end of 2007. \n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n86. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and \ntaxes)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries,  other  than  ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  8)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement  will  be  through  normal  commercial  practices  in  the  case  of  procurement  by  the \nprivate sector, or prescribed procedures acceptable to ADB in the case of procurement by the \npublic sector, with due regard for the principles of economy and efficiency.   \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures \n87. \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed to the central Government as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will \nbe required if, during each year, in which program loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, \nthe value of the central Government\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to \nor  greater  than  the  program  loan  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The \ncentral Government will, however, certify with each withdrawal request its compliance with this \nformula.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  Loan \nproceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  for  which  expenditures  were  incurred  180 \ndays before the program loan becomes effective. \n \n\nd. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n88. \nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  costs  of  structural  adjustment  under  the \nProgram, including the establishment of particular funds such as for the new employee pension \nscheme,  debt  swapping  and  settlement,  and  the  State  Renewal  Fund  for  PSE  reforms,  which \nwill be held in accounts to be agreed with ADB. The rupee counterpart funds to be generated \nout  of  the  program  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  by  the  central  Government  to  ASG.  The \ncounterpart proceeds will be treated as an addition to the transfers allocated annually from the \ncentral Government to ASG. \n \n\ne. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching    \n\n89. \nThe loan under subprogram 1 will be disbursed in three installments based on meeting \nspecified  tranche  release  conditions.  The  achievement  targets  represent  such  tranche  release \nconditions  and  their  accomplishment  will  be  measured  by  a  review  of  policy  actions.  Under \nsubprogram  1,  policy  and  institutional  development  commitments  must  be  signaled  in  the  first \ntranche.  This  is  followed  by  an  incentive  tranche,  which  translates  first  tranche  commitment \nsignals  into  sufficiently  unequivocal  commitments  on  key  reforms.  The  incentive  tranche \nbalances the need to take account of capacity constraints in ASG with the need to ensure that \nkey  policy  and  institutional  actions  are  not  too  long  delayed,  given  potential  external \nenvironment uncertainties, including forthcoming state elections around mid 2006. This provides \na  foundation  for  subsequent  implementation  of  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the  second \ntranche. The incentive tranche provides for flexibility based on progress made on commitments \n\n\f \n\n23\n\ntailored  to  ASG  since  it  can  be  released  at  any  point  during  subprogram  1  when  ASG  is  in \ncompliance with the incentive tranche requirements. The loan under subprogram 2 is tentatively \nintended to be released through two equal tranches, and the policy matrix (Appendix 3) provides \na list of indicative milestones expected to be achieved at the end of subprogram 2. \n \nSubprogram 1 tranching will provide program loan resources equivalent to $125 million, \n90. \nwhich will be divided into a first tranche of $45 million to be disbursed upon loan effectiveness \nand  ASG  compliance  with  all  prior  actions  under  the  Program;  an  incentive  tranche  of  $45 \nmillion to be disbursed upon satisfactory compliance with all incentive tranche conditions; and a \nsecond tranche of $35 million to be disbursed by December 2006 upon satisfactory compliance \nof  the  corresponding  second  tranche  conditions.  Subprogram  2  is  expected  to  provide  loan \nresources of $100 million through two equal installments of $50 million each. \n \n\nf. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n91. \nThe  central  Government  and  ASG  will  maintain  accurate  records  of  accounts.  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  program  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \ncentral Government\u2019s certification of withdrawals.  \n \n\ng. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nASG  will  operate  a  system  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  results  being  attained  by  the \n92. \nProgram  using  the  targets,  indicators,  monitoring  mechanisms,  and  assumptions  and  risks  in \nthe  program  framework.  The  FMU  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  the  program  steering \ncommittee,  which  will  be  made  available  to  ADB  and  published.  Not  later  than  3  months  after \nprogram completion, ASG will provide ADB with a program report, including an assessment of \noverall  program  performance.  ASG  and  ADB  will  carry  out  periodic  reviews  of  the  Program \nbased on reports; such reviews will include tracking the fiscal indicators under the MTFP.  \n \n\nh. \n\nProgram Review  \n\n93. \nASG and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review of the Program in the last \nquarter  of  2005.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  program  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation  arrangements;  (ii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  program \nperformance  indicators  and  objectives;  (iii)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  legal \ncovenants;  and  (iv)  identify  problems  and  constraints.  If  the  midterm  review  determines  that \nchanges  are  required  in  program  implementation,  ASG  and  ADB  will  agree  on  measures, \nincluding changes in implementation arrangements, to ensure that program obligations are met. \nSatisfactory progress in the review for the second tranche release of subprogram 1 will be the \ntrigger for processing subprogram 2. ASG and ADB will carry out a final review at the conclusion \nof subprogram 1.  \n \nD. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\nObjective. The objective of the Project is to enhance ASG\u2019s capacity to accomplish the \n\n94. \npolicy and institutional reforms under the Program.  \n \n\n\f 24\n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n95. \nThe  scope  of  the  Project  in  terms  of  outputs  is  to  support  (i)  assessments,  analytical \nstudies,  and  strategies  for  key  policy  reform  areas  addressed  in  the  Program;  (ii)  capacity \nbuilding  in  key  institutions  responsible  for  public  finance,  fiscal  governance,  and  public \nadministration and service delivery across various activities to improve fiscal performance and \nenhance  governance;52  (iii)  development  and  implementation  of  a  new  integrated  public \nfinancial  MIS,  and  information  technology  support  for  composite  check  posts  to  enhance \ncapacity,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness  of  public  finance  institutions  of  ASG;  and  (iv)  public \nawareness underpinning required for sustainability of all reforms. The Project will, for example, \nsupport  strategic  reviews  and  assessments  for  analytical  underpinning  of  key  policy  reforms, \nsuch  as  a  user  fees  policy,  public  administration  quality  assessment,  and  private  sector \ndevelopment.  Critical  policy  reform  areas  depend  on  institutional  developments  being \nappropriately  supported  by  the  Project.  Capacity-building  support  will,  for  example,  therefore \nunderpin (i) budget mechanisms and processes incorporating MTFP projections in anticipation \nof  introduction  of  a  fiscal  responsibility  legislation;  (ii)  functional  refocusing  of  sales  tax \nadministration  in  anticipation  of  VAT  and  post-VAT  audit,  and  information  and  communication \ntechnology  training  assistance  geared  to  a  self-compliance  regime;  (iii)  pension  liability \nestimation and database creation and maintenance, underpinning introduction of a predictable \nand quantifiable contributory pension scheme; (iv) operationalization of the key fiscal monitoring \nand review institution of the reform program, i.e., the FMU; (v) MIS support for operationalizing \ncomposite  check  posts;  and  (vi)  accounting  backlog  clearance  and  verification  of  assets  and \nliabilities of PSEs prior to introducing the VRS.  \n \nThe  specific  components  of  the  Project  are  (i)  coordination,  (ii)  capacity  building  to \n96. \nreform state finances, (iii) capacity building for fiscal governance reforms, (iv) capacity building \nto  reorient  the  role  of  the  state,  (v)  provision  of  public  finance  information  technology,  (vi) \nconduct of training programs, and (vii) provision of public awareness programs.  \n \n97. \nThe details of the Project\u2019s analytical assessment, capacity building, skills enhancement, \nand  procurement-based  support  to  ASG  under  the  various  project  components  are  linked  to \nsubprogram 1 incentive and second tranches.53 The Project will also support indicative outputs \nof  subprogram  2.  The  linkage  between  key  program  output  milestones  and  the  Project\u2019s \ncapacity-building and institutional-strengthening activities is provided under Appendix 9. Details \nare provided in Supplementary Appendix D. \n  \n\n3. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n\n98. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $38  million  equivalent,  including \ncontingencies,  comprising  $11,964,000  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $26,036,000  equivalent \nin local currency costs.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe reasons for the decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  ADB  loan \nwill cover $8,964,000 of foreign exchange cost and $16,036,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncost.  The  Government  will  cover  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $3  million  for  interest  and \ncommitment  charges  on  the  loan.  The  Government  will  bear  the  exchange  risk  on  the  project \nloan. The Government will make the loan proceeds available to ASG.

Execution  and  Implementation  Arrangements.  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the \nFinance  Department  of  ASG.  The  FMU  in  the  Finance  Department  will  support  project \nimplementation  and  be  responsible  for  coordination  with  ASG  departments  and  timely  project \nimplementation.  A  project  manager,  who  will  manage  the  FMU,  will  report  to  the  program \nsteering  committee,  have  the  authority  to  make  decisions  essential  to  ensure  progress  of  the \n\n\f 26\n\nProject  with  regard  to  facilitating  procurement  of  equipment  and  recruitment  of  consulting \nservices.  \n \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n101.  The Project is planned to commence following loan effectiveness of the Program, and be \ncompleted over 5 years after inception and before December 2009. Details of the program and \nproject implementation schedules, including advance action on the coordination component and \nthe public finance information technology component of the Project, is provided in Appendix 9. \nAdvance  action  on  these  project  components  will  support  targeted  second  tranche  reform \nmeasures under the program loan. The central Government and ASG have been advised that \nsuch advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n102.  Procurement.  The  computer  hardware  and  software  for  the  information  technology \ncomponent  of  the  Project  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost the equivalent \nof more than $1,000,000 will be procured through international competitive bidding. The public \nfinancial  MIS  equipment  will  be  procured  on  a  turnkey  basis  through  international  competitive \nbidding  as  an  integrated  system  of  information  and  communication  technology.  The  computer \nhardware and software required for computerized financial control and management systems in \nthe sales tax, excise, and transport departments to validate and cross check composite check-\npost  information  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping.  Details  of  the  procurement \npackages are provided in Appendix 10. \n \n103.  Disbursement  Arrangements.  Since  the  disbursements  under  the  Project  will  be \nmainly for equipment supply and international consulting services, ADB\u2019s commitment letter and \ndirect  payment  procedures  will  be  used  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Loan \nDisbursement  (January  2001)  and  ADB\u2019s  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  of  Operations, \nLIBOR-based Loan Projects (July 2002) as amended from time to time. \n \n\nd. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n104.  The  Project  will  require  a  459  person-months  of  consulting  services,  including  153 \nperson-months  of  international  and  306  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services. \nConsulting  services  for  the  coordination  consultants  component  will  be  provided  by  a  firm \nselected  through  quality-based  selection  or individual  consultants  recruited  in accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The coordination consultants will ensure quality control by \nundertaking  30%  of  the  total  person-months  of  the  consulting  services  for  all  project \ncomponents; facilitating recruitment of consultants and procurement; and managing consultants. \nSeparate  subcontracting  of  the  services  of  individual  consultants  or  firms  may  be  required  for \nother  project  components.  Consulting  services  for  such  other  components  will  be  provided \nthrough  quality  and  cost-based  selection  by  one  or  more  consulting  firms  or  individual \nconsultants recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  For  selecting \nconsulting firms, simplified technical proposals will be used where possible and appropriate. The \nterms of reference of the coordination consultants are provided in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\ne. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n105.  Accounting  and  Auditing.  The  Finance  Department  will  establish  and  maintain \nseparate accounts and records for the Project in accordance with sound accounting principles, \nand  will  have  such  accounts  and  records  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  standards \nacceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited accounts and financial statements, and the \nreport  of  the  auditors  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  the \nfiscal year to which they relate.   \n \n106.  Project Reports. Each project component will be implemented in three phases. During \nthe  inception  phase,  the  consultants  of  the  various  components  will  revalidate  the  objectives \nand  assess  priorities,  key  issues,  and  capacity-building  needs.  At  the  end  of  this  phase, \nresource inputs may be adjusted, as appropriate, within the overall budget and project scope, to \nbetter  align  the  terms  of  reference,  activities,  and  outputs  with  client  expectations  and  needs. \nDuring  the  design  phase,  the  consultants  will  formulate  in  detail  the  capacity-building  and \noperational  development  plans.  Finally,  in  the  implementation  phase,  the  consultants  will \ndocument  required  regulations,  procedures,  and  systems,  as  well  as  arrange  for  training  and \nskill development, as appropriate. \n \n107.  The consultants for each component will prepare (i) an inception report, within 2 months \nof service commencement, to fine tune and detail the work program and establish time-bound \noutputs; (ii) medium-term review reports 1 and 2 at the end of 18 months and 36 months; (iii) a \ndraft final report with complete documentation at the end of 52 months; and (iv) a final report at \nproject completion, after incorporating comments of ADB, the central Government, and ASG. \n \n108.  The FMU will submit quarterly reports on the Project to ADB within 1 month of the end of \neach  quarter  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  system  guidelines. \nThe reports will contain a narrative description of progress made during the period, changes to \nthe  implementation  schedule  if  any,  problems  or  difficulties  encountered  and  the  remedial \nactions taken, the performance of the project consultants where applicable, and the work to be \ncarried out in the upcoming period. The reports will include a summary financial account for the \nProject, consisting of project expenditure to date. A project completion report will be submitted \nto ADB within 3 months of project completion. \n \n\nf. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nIn addition to regular and ongoing interaction of the Finance Department, ADB, and its \n109. \nconsultants,  ASG  and  ADB  will  periodically  review  project  implementation  based  on  quarterly \nreports of the FMU and consultant reports. The reviews will include evaluation of project scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  consultations  with  the  Finance  Department  and  FMU,  progress \nwith the policy reform agenda, and capacity-building measures. \n \n\ng. \n\nProject Review  \n\nIn  addition  to  regular  ADB  reviews,  two  comprehensive  midterm  reviews  will  be \n110. \nundertaken  18  and  36  months  after  commencement  of  the  Project  to  evaluate  all  aspects  of \nimplementation. Based on this review, modifications and improvements will be considered. \n \n\n\f 28\n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n111.  Overall. The Program is expected to yield material benefits to the population in Assam, \nincluding  the  36%  who  are  poor  by  supporting  (i)  the  generation  of  fiscal  space  for  increased \nspending  on  social  sector  expenditure  to  reduce  poverty  and  growth-inducing  capital \nexpenditure  on  infrastructure;  (ii)  improved  fiscal  governance  for  effective  utilization  and \nprioritization  of  existing  resources  to  increase  GSDP  growth  and  reduce  poverty;  and  (iii) \nimprovements  in  the  rationalization  and  quality  of  public  expenditure,  and  creation  of  an \nenabling environment for improved opportunities for sustainable employment and growth.   \n \n112.  Creation of Sustainable Fiscal Resources. Benefits will accrue over the medium term \nlinked  to  the  policy  matrix  and  the  MTFP.  Several  actions  under  the  policy  matrix  for \nsubprogram  1  are  specifically  designed  to  create  benefits.  Thus,  the  various  deficit  reduction \nfiscal policy actions anchored by the MTFP and the restructuring of debt utilizing loan proceeds \nwill enable an additional creation of fiscal space in a sustainable manner that can be utilized for \ntargeted growth-inducing and poverty-reducing public expenditure.  \n \n113.  Strengthened  Growth-Orientated  and  Poverty-Reduction  Projects.  The  benefit  of \neffective  utilization  of  additional  fiscal  space  for  poverty  reduction  and  growth  will  result  from \nsubprogram  1\u2019s  fiscal  governance  component  under  which  a  core  investment  program  will \nobjectively prioritize capital outlay on development projects that have the most significant impact \non poverty reduction or growth.  \n \n114.  Strengthened ASG Operations. The core governance component of subprogram 1 will \nresult  in  the  benefits  of  (i)  containment  of  staff  costs  in  the  interests  of  growth  and  poverty \nreduction focused public expenditure; (ii) a results-based, responsive, and performance-oriented \nstate government; and (iii) the additional employment, growth, and income generation resulting \nfrom a public-private partnership. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n115.  Poverty Impact. The Program\u2019s policy and institutional reforms are expected to overall \nhave a positive impact on poverty reduction. The Program mitigates potential adverse poverty \nimpacts  in  three  ways.  First,  in  terms  of  PSE  reform,  the  Program\u2019s  support  for  closure  of  7 \nPSEs will entail a VRS-SSN program. The closure of these PSEs will not lead to loss of regular \nemployment as these units are already inoperative. Second, the Program will mitigate any short-\nterm  deterioration  of  household  spending  of  pensioners  by  containing  unfunded  pension \nliabilities in the long run on behalf of all government employees. In any event, the Program will \nnot  affect  the  current  targeted  social  security  arrangements  for  the  poor,  such  as  old  age \npensions.  Third,  the  Program  will  implement  a  user  fees  policy  only  after  a  careful  strategic \nreview to assess possible adverse impacts on the poor in terms of access and affordability for \nthe poor and targeted protection for the poor. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis in Appendix 11. The matrix on poverty impact and mitigation assessment is in Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n \n116.  Environmental,  Involuntary  Resettlement,  and  Impact  on  Indigenous  People.  The \nProgram will not have any direct or immediate environmental impacts (Supplementary Appendix \nH).  The  Program  will  help  implement  and  streamline  clear  application  of  existing  laws  against \nenvironmental pollution resulting from the public-private taskforce review of environmental laws, \n\n\f \n\n29\n\nrules,  and  regulations.  The  Program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples\u2019 policies. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n1. \n\nThe Program  \n\n117.  Political Risks. Assam has a history of insurgency and law and order problems. Assam \nhas experienced a series of political and social challenges during the last 5 to 6 decades. The \nstate  has  shown  great  resilience  in  the  face  of  insurgency  accentuated  by  the  partition  of  the \ncountry  in  1947,  demographic  changes  and  reorganization  of  the  state  in  1972  against  a \nbackdrop of economic deceleration. The Program is providing a complementary growth-oriented \nprogram to the steps already taken by ASG to contain insurgency and law and order problems \nthrough  the  Assam  Accord  of  1985  and  the  recent  Bodo  Accord  of  February  2003.  The \nProgram\u2019s  policy  actions  are  structured  through  first  and  incentive  tranches  to  achieve  critical \nresults  early  given  the  state  electoral  calendar  in  2006.  In  addition,  the  accomplishment  of \nsubprogram 1 policy actions will set the stage for deepening of policy reforms in subprogram 2 \nafter the state elections.   \n \n118.  To  mitigate  the  risks  of  misinformation  and  lack  of  clear  communication  about  the \nimplications  of  the  Program  to  key  stakeholders,  the  Program  includes  measures  to  build \nconsensus and strong stakeholder support through a comprehensive communications strategy, \nincluding an annual Assam development forum.  \n \n119.  Bureaucratic  and  Legislative  Risks.  The  Program  aims  to  increase  transparency \nthrough  fiscal  and  fiscal  governance  reforms;  and  enhance  government  performance, \naccountability, responsiveness, and vigilance through core governance reforms. Those opposed \nto  such  a  process  could  seek  to  impede  the  reforms  and  delay  legislative  enactment.  To \nmitigate such risks, strong ownership at the highest political and bureaucratic levels is built into \nthe  Program  and  its  implementation  arrangements.  Key  institutional  actions  are  to  precede \nlegislation.  In  addition,  capacity  building  and  public  awareness,  through  the  attached  Project, \nwill help foster reform champions within the system. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Project  \n\n120. \nInstitutional  Risks.  The  Program\u2019s  comprehensive  nature  will  place  considerable \ndemands on ASG\u2019s weak institutional capacities. ASG has only limited experience with this type \nof fiscal and governance reform programs. To mitigate these risks, significant capacity building \nand systems support are built into the Program through the Project. In addition, the Project will \ninclude performance benchmarks to track institutional performance.  \n \n121. \nImplementation  Risks.  Close  performance  monitoring  will  help  reduce  the  adverse \neffects  of  implementation  delays  due  to  capacity  constraints.  The  FMU  will  draw  on  lessons \nlearned from other programs. Implementation delays caused by frequent changes of personnel \nwill be mitigated through assurances on continuity. \n  \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  ASG  have  given  the \n\n122. \nfollowing specific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n\n\f 30\n\n \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\n1. \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n123.  Assurances for the program loan include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  and  ASG  will  ensure  that  the  achievements  met  and  policy \nactions adopted as set forth in the policy letter and the policy matrix will continue \nto  be  in  full  force  and  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  program  period,  and  ensure \nthe sustainability of the reforms beyond the program period. \nThe Government will transfer the counterpart funds generated under the program \nloan under the normal arrangements for transferring external assistance to ASG, \nand  will  treat  such  counterpart  funds  as  additional  to  its  transfers  allocated \nannually to the State of Assam. ASG will use these counterpart funds to finance \nstructural adjustment under the Program for the (a) ASG debt restructuring costs, \n(b) cost of cash management reform, (c) cost of containing pension liabilities of \nASG,  (d)  cost  of  ASG  acknowledgement  of  unfunded  ASEB  terminal  benefit \nliabilities, and (e) PSE reform costs. \nASG  will establish a program steering committee chaired by the chief secretary \nof ASG to oversee all fiscal and governance reforms under the program loan. \nBy  April  2005,  ASG  will  approve  the  operating  guidelines  and  structure  for  the \nprudential management and discharge of the state renewal fund. \nBy  October  2005,  ASG  will  establish  a  SSN  unit  supervised  by  the  DPE  to  be \nresponsible for developing an SSN program for employees of PSEs to be closed. \nThe  SSN  program  will  include  a  communication  program,  training,  financing, \nvocational,  and  financial  counseling  for  employees  of  PSEs  to  be  closed.  The \nSSN  program  will  be  developed  in  consultation  with  relevant  stakeholders, \nincluding employees of PSEs. \nASG  will  submit  a  compliance  report  to  the  Cabinet  on  compliance  with  MTFP \nparameters  prior  to  introduction  of  the  fiscal  responsibility  bill  in  the  State\u2019s \nLegislative Assembly. \nASG  will  ensure  that  in  carrying  out  the  policy  actions  included  under  the \nProgram and the policy matrix, due consideration will be given to the findings and \nrecommendations of the Project. \n\n(viii)  ASG  will  undertake  a  subprogram  review  in  consultation  with  ADB  prior  to \nrelease  of  tranche  2  under  subprogram  1  and  formulation  of  subprogram  2. \nSatisfactory  progress  in  the  subprogram  review  will  precede  any  decision  to \nproceed with subprogram 2. \n\n2. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n124.  Assurances for the project loan include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nADB,  ASG,  and  the  Government  will  undertake  two  comprehensive  reviews  of \nthe Project 18 months and 36 months after its commencement. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness  \n\n125.  The  following  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness  will  be  incorporated  into  the  Program \nLoan Agreement: (i) The Project Loan Agreement will have  been duly executed and delivered \non  behalf  of  the  central  Government,  and  all  conditions  precedent  to  its  effectiveness  (other \nthan those requiring the effectiveness of the Program Loan Agreement) will have been fulfilled; \n\n\f \n\n31\n\nand (ii) the ASG shall (a) acknowledge the total and annualized quantum of the unfunded ASEB \nterminal benefit liabilities, and (b) submit updated MTFP figures taking into account such ASEB \nterminal benefit liabilities. \n \n126.  The following condition for loan effectiveness will be incorporated into the Project Loan \nAgreement:  The  Program  Loan  Agreement  will  have  been  duly  executed  and  delivered  on \nbehalf  of  the  central  Government,  and  all  conditions  precedent  to  its effectiveness  (other  than \nthose requiring the effectiveness of the Project Loan Agreement) will have been fulfilled. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n127. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nthe  program  cluster  concept  of  $225,000,000  for  the  Assam  Governance  and \nPublic Resource Management Sector Development Program in India; \nthe  loan  of  $125,000,000  to  India  for  the  Assam  Governance  and  Public \nResource  Management  Subprogram  1  of  the  Assam  Governance  and  Public \nResource  Management  Sector  Development  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3 \nyears;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements presented to the \nBoard; and \nthe loan of $25,000,000 to India for the Assam Governance and Public Resource \nManagement  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 25 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and \nProject Agreements presented to the Board. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n25 November 2004 \n\n\f32\n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nBackground and Recent Performance \n\n \n A. \n \n1. \nFiscal.  The  fiscal  health  of  Assam  deteriorated  sharply  during  the  last  decade.  The \naverage revenue, fiscal, and primary deficits in the 1990s were significantly higher than that of \nthe  1980s.1  This  was  exacerbated  by  a  sharp  increase  in  revenue  expenditures  in  fiscal  year \n(FY)1999  due  to  pay  and  pension  revisions.2  Following  these  revisions,  the  hardening  budget \nconstraint forced the Assam state government (ASG) to adopt measures to tackle the deficits. \nASG was able to steadily improve the fiscal health of the state.3  \n \n2. \nHowever,  these  improvements  in  the  fiscal  situation  in  Assam  were  undertaken  by \nsteadily crowding out capital expenditures from 4.3% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) in \nFY1992  to  1.7%  in  FY2003  with  adverse  effects  on  infrastructure  availability  and  the  future \ngrowth potential of the state. To meet the growing gap between rising revenue expenditure and \nslowing revenue growth, the burden of indebtedness of the state increased steadily from about \n24%  of  GSDP  in  FY1996  to  36%  by  FY2002.  With  the  move  away  from  financial  repression, \ninterest rates increased sharply after FY1994, and ASG\u2019s poor cash management added to the \ninterest burden. The average rate of interest on ASG\u2019s borrowing increased from 7% in the early \n1990s  to  around  10.5%  in  FY2002.  With  the  state\u2019s  economy  growing  at  a  much  slower  rate, \nhigher  interest  rates  made  the  situation  increasingly  unsustainable  with  interest  payments \ngrowing  at  17%  per  annum  during  the  1990s.  Consequently,  the  fiscal  picture  in  Assam \ncontinues to be worrisome. \n \nFiscal  Governance.  In  terms  of  fiscal  governance,  the  weaknesses  in  financial \n3. \nmanagement  and  state  budgeting  are  evidenced  in  the  ineffective  use  of  existing  resources \nincluding  central  transfers.  For  example,  in  FY2003,  the  Rural  Development  Ministry  of  the \ncentral  Government  allocated  Rs4.25  billion  of  grants  for  various  rural  poverty  reduction \nschemes.  However  only  Rs3.61  billion,  or  85%,  of  the  allocated  sum  were  actually  released. \nASG  was  to  provide  Rs1.41billion  of  counterpart  funding,  but  could  only  contribute  Rs0.27 \nbillion. \n \nCore  Governance.  Despite  the  efforts  of  ASG  to  control  the  overall  number  of  ASG \n4. \nemployees by freezing recruitment and promotion, except with the approval of the State-Level \nEmpowered  Committee,4  and  to  increase  the  delegation  of  authority,  concerns  about  public \nadministration-related  expenditure  and  the  organizational  structure  and  performance  of  public \nadministration in terms of the required quality of public expenditure continue. According to the \nAssam  Administrative  Reforms  Commission  reports  of  2003  and  2004,  ASG  is  unable  to \neffectively fulfill its core functions as a result of misaligned organizational structures; inadequate \nskills and incentives; and poor human resource management, performance, and accountability. \n \n5. \nPublic  sector  enterprise  (PSE)  performance  problems  characterize  many  state \ngovernments  in  India.  While  ASG  has  initiated  reform  efforts  for  individual  PSEs  like  Assam \nState  Electricity  Board  (ASEB)  and  Assam  State  Transport  Corporation,  the  overall  financial \n\n                                                           \n1   As  a  ratio  of  gross  state  domestic  product,  the  fiscal  deficit  was  2.09%  in  FY1992  and  worsened  to  3.36%  in \n\nFY1996. \n\nrevisions. \n\n2   A  revenue  surplus  of  2.21%  in  FY1992  deteriorated  to  a  3.55%  deficit  in  FY2000  after  the  pay  and  pensions \n\n3   As a percentage of GSDP, the revenue deficit was reduced from 3.5% in FY2000 to 1.4% in FY2003, and the fiscal \n\ndeficit improved during this period from 5.7% to 3.1%. \n\n4   The overall number of ASG employees has been reduced from 459,701 to 429,627 from FY1999 to FY2004. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n  33\n\nResource Mobilization \n\nperformance  of  the  PSEs  in  Assam,  including  ASEB,  in  terms  of  percentage  of  loss  to \ncumulative government investment, is substantially worse than in other states. For Assam, this \nis a loss of 1.6 times; no other state among the 17 reviewed by the Ministry of Disinvestment of \nthe  central  Government  had  a  ratio  of  loss  to  cumulative  investment  exceeding  100%  (using \nFY2002 data). \n \nB. \n \n6. \nOwn  Tax  Revenue.  The  major  tax  sources  for  Assam,  as  a  percentage  of  own-tax \nrevenue, are sales tax (74%), state excise duties (6%), motor vehicle tax (6%), stamp duty and \nregistration fees (3%), and land revenue (3%). However, given that central transfers constitute \n67% of the total revenues of ASG, own-tax revenue collections of ASG only account for 26% of \nthe total revenue receipts. This limits the extent of resource mobilization from own-tax revenue. \nNevertheless,  tax  policy  and  administration  weaknesses  are  limiting  own-tax  revenue  growth. \nThus, although the quantum of total own-tax revenue collections has increased from Rs1 billion \nto over Rs15.5 billion during the 20-years beginning FY1982, with an annual growth rate of over \n15.5%  per  annum,  the  actual  recorded  growth  rates  have  fluctuated  considerably  from  a \nnegative  1.5%  to  a  positive  40%.  Consequently,  while  the  long-term  average  growth  rate  is \n15.5%,  evidence  of  a  decline  is  illustrated  by  the  average  growth  in  the  1990s  at  13.8%  as \ncompared with 17.7% in the 1980s.  \n \n7. \nRevenue productivity of the tax system has increased substantially over the last 3 years. \nThe revenue-GSDP ratio increased sharply from 4.3% in FY2000 to 5.3% in FY2003. However, \nindividual tax revenue-GSDP ratios are not stable over time. For instance, taxes on agricultural \nincome used to account for over 7% in FY1982, but have recorded a sustained decline in recent \nyears  and  accounted  for  only  0.1%  of  total  tax  collections  in  FY2003.  Tax  policy  reforms  are \nneeded.  The  demerger  of  sales  tax  on  liquor  from  excise  in  2002  will  likely  have  a  negative \nimpact  on  revenue  buoyancy  in  the  future;  the  annual  growth  rate  of  stamps  and  registration \nfees is declining;5 and capture of the services sector in the sales tax system is not sufficient. \n \n8. \nA  major  reason  for  the  decelerating  trend  in  the  growth  of  taxes,  apart  from  the  slow \ngrowth  of  the  economy,  is  the  serious  administrative  and  compliance  issues.  Since  FY2000, \nrevenue collections from own taxes in the state have improved significantly. This is mainly due \nto  concerted  efforts  to  improve  both  the  structure  and  operation  of  the  sales  tax  system, \nincluding efforts to clear the arrears. However, most of the neighboring states act as tax havens \nresulting  in  significant  evasion  and  avoidance  of  taxes.  In  this  context,  ASG  has  been  taking \nsome initiatives to spearhead a move to increase coordination among the northeastern states. A \nstep  in  this  direction  was  a  recent  meeting  of  the  finance  ministers  of  these  states  to  build \nconsensus  on  sales  tax-related  issues.  The  efforts,  however,  need  to  be  expanded  through \ninstitutional  reforms,  such  as  composite  check  posts.  In  addition,  functional  reforms  in  major \nindividual tax administration like sales tax administration are required. \n \n9. \nNontax  Revenues.  The  growth  rate  of  ASG\u2019s  own  nontax  revenues  declined  sharply \nduring  the  1990s  compared  with  the  1980s.  The  average  growth  rate  of  nontax  revenues \ndeclined from 17% during the 1980s to a mere 4% during the 1990s. Important nontax revenues \nconsist of royalty on crude oil, revenue from forest, and user charges and fees on various public \nservices provided. The state has very limited control over royalty rates and the ban on logging \nand  movement  of  trucks  in  reserved  forests  imposed  by  a  Supreme  Court  of  India  order  has \nsignificantly reduced forest revenues. However, the nontax revenue from other sectors that are \n\n                                                           \n5   This declined from 16% in the 1980s to 14% in the 1990s. \n\n\f34\n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nExpenditure Management \n\nwithin the control of the state is marginal with collection in the irrigation sector being only Rs5 \nmillion.  Assam  does  not  have  a  prevalent  system  of  user  charges  for  roads  and  bridges. \nConsequently, it does not have any income from tolls; other receipts for roads and bridges have \nfluctuated  between  Rs0.03  billion  and  Rs3.95  billion  from  FY1999  to  FY2003.  These  receipts \nare  essentially  the  \u201cagency  charges\u201d  paid  to  the  Public  Works  Department  by  the  Ministry  of \nRoad  Transport  &  Highways  for  management  of  capital/maintenance  works  undertaken  by \nPublic  Works  Department  on  its  behalf.  Contribution  of  user  fees  to  finance  health  care \nexpenditure is about 2%, although medical college hospitals report a higher user fee collection. \nIn the education sector, the revenue receipts were about Rs9.8 million.  \n \nC. \n \n10. \nExpenditure  Management  Reform  Path.  Limits  to  resource  mobilization  in  Assam \nmean  that  expenditure  management  is  key  to  accomplishing  fiscal  consolidation  in  the  state. \nHowever,  sustainable  fiscal  consolidation6  can  only  be  achieved  over  the  medium  term  in \nAssam  by  building  on  a  set  of  fiscal  stabilization  measures  on  expenditure  management \nencompassing  key  institutional  foundation  stones  on  employee  and  pension  databases  and \ntreasury systems for improved cash management, debt swaps and settlements accompanied by \na debt inventory, enhanced budget reporting, and a central transfers inventory. An assessment \nof  the  state\u2019s  expenditure  management  issues  shows  that  these  measures  need  to  be \naccompanied  by  appropriately  focused  fiscal  and  fiscal  governance  capacity  building  and \ninstitutional strengthening given Assam\u2019s institutional challenges. \n \n11. \nSalaries,  Wages,  and  Pensions.  ASG  currently  spends  as  much  as  45.19%  of  total \nexpenditures  on  salaries  for  its  regular  employees,  3.21%  on  salaries  for  employees  in  fully \naided  educational  institutions,  and  another  9.84%  on  pensions  (including  other  retirement \nbenefits)  to  its  employees.  A  review  of  the  employee  and  salary  expenditure  numbers  for  the \nlast  5  years  (FY2000  to  FY2004)  reveals  that  while  the  number  of  ASG\u2019s  regular  employees \ndecreased  by  6.54%  during  this  period  (from  459,701  to  429,627),  the  salary  expenditure  on \nthese employees increased by 52.57%. This means that the reduction in the number of regular \nemployees  was  more  than  offset  by  the  increase  in  the  average  salary  per  employee.  The \naverage salary per employee increased by 63.26%, the major spikes being on account of ASG\u2019s \npayments  to  implement  the  central  Government\u2019s  Fifth  Pay  Commission  recommendations. \nConsequently,  continued  action  on  containing  the  overall  size  of  the  government  bureaucracy \nthrough  public  administration  rationalization  is  important  as  is  a  medium-term  reform  path  for \ncompression  of  wages  and  salaries  expenditure  and  linked  benefits7  to  release  resources  to \nfinance more productive expenditure.  \n \n12. \nDebt. The resources available to ASG have not increased concurrent with the increase \nin expenditure commitments. This has resulted in an increase in revenue deficit, which in turn \n\n                                                           \n6   A  review  of  ongoing  programs  shows  that  deep  expenditure  management  reforms,  such  as  public  administration \nand enterprise restructuring and  parametric pensions reforms, cannot be sustained if they are pursued early in a \nreform program without institutional measures as part of fiscal stabilization. \n\n7   Pensions and other retirement benefits are linked to wages and salaries, and are a material factor in rising revenue \nexpenditure. They have grown from 9% of revenue expenditures in FY1994 to approximately 13% in FY2003. The \nnumber of pensioners grew from 75,999 in FY1998 to 135,549 in FY2003, representing an average growth of 12%. \nPensions are provided to government employees under a defined benefit plan financed by the current revenues of \nthe state  with  no contributions either from the current  workers or government to finance these  liabilities. All state \ngovernment  employees  are  entitled  to  retirement  benefits,  which  include  a  monthly  basic  pension  with  full \nindexation  to  wage  and  price  changes,  dearness  relief,  a  family  pension,  gratuity,  and  leave  encashment. \nPensioners are also entitled to commute a portion of their pension.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n  35\n\nhas compelled ASG to borrow to meet its revenue expenditure. The state plan has also grown \non an incremental basis out of step with growth in resources, compelling ASG to avail of high \ncost  borrowings.  The  growth  in  debt  has  largely  followed  the  level  of  revenue  deficits  of  the \nstate. The large and increasing gross fiscal deficit of ASG has led to a steady accumulation of \noutstanding  debt.  The  increasing  debt  stock  of  Assam  has  led  to  an  increase  in  interest \npayments.  From  FY1988  to  FY2003,  while  the  outstanding  debt  increased  4.8  times,  interest \npayments grew by 13.6% annually or 6.74 times. Debt swaps have resulted in interest savings \nfor  the  state  that  would  help  reduce  the  revenue  deficit  strain,  but  not  the  debt  stock,  which \nwould require an accelerated timetable of institutional loan settlements. \n \n13. \nCash  Management.  Prudent  cash  management  has  been  lacking,  with  ASG  incurring \nlarge expenditures on interest payment on ways and means advances taken from the Reserve \nBank  of  India  to  tide  over  short-term  cash  requirements.  During  FY2003,  the  state  was  in  an \noverdraft position for 287 days, and for 154 working days the payments remained suspended. In \nFY2002, ASG incurred interest expenditure of Rs1.39 billion on ways and means advances and \noverdrafts. Besides taking the precious time of senior officials away from proper fiscal planning, \nthis  brings  uncertainty  and  inefficiency  in  expenditure  implementation.  Strengthening  the  cash \nmanagement  system  is  of  critical  importance,  not  only  to  reduce  the  interest  burden  on  ASG, \nbut also to reduce the cost of delivering public services.  \n \nBudget,  Financial  Management,  and  Capacity  Building.  While  reorientation  to \n14. \nmultiyear fiscal forecasting and output-based and performance-oriented budgeting is a medium-\nterm  prospect  in  Assam,  the  strengthening  of  systems  and  capacity  and  comprehensive \nemployee,  pensions,  debt,  and  cash  management  data  is  critical  for  the  success  of  the  fiscal \nstabilization  thrust  of  subprogram  1.  This  explains  the  front-loaded  thrust  of  capacity-building \nsupport under the project loan in these areas to underpin the accomplishment of these goals by \nthe end of 2006. By contrast, the deeper expenditure management reforms, such as reforms on \npublic  administration  and  enterprise  restructuring  and  parametric  pension  reform,  will  be \nsupported  through  back-loaded  capacity-building  support  and  integration  of  public  financial \nmanagement information systems and automated settlement processes under the project loan \nfrom 2007 onward. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nExpenditure  Orientation  Reform  Path.  The  fiscal  stabilization  path  of  the  first \nsubprogram will entail a focus on a public expenditure review process as a key element of fiscal \ngovernance  measures.  Such  a  process  will  entail  both  prioritization  of  capital  outlay  and \norientation to operation and maintenance expenditure away from salaries and wages. This will \nculminate  in  a  core  investment  program  and  operation  and  maintenance  targets  under  the \nmedium-term  fiscal  plan.  The  latter  needs  to  anchor  functional  reviews  of  ASG\u2019s  expenditure \ndepartments if any sustainable results are to be achieved from a functional review for medium-\nterm public administration restructuring. The core investment program will be implemented over \nthe medium term and aligned to gradual increases in capital outlay for critical economic growth \nin  the  state.  A  review  of  current  sector  expenditure  patterns  in  certain  key  selected  sectors \nexplains  the  importance  of  this  phased  approach  for  Assam  given  the  magnitude  of  current \nexpenditure orientation problems. \n \n16. \nEducation. For example, from FY2004, an annual investment of Rs3.5 billion to 4 billion \nis  expected  under  the  Sarva  Shiksha  Mission  (a  centrally  sponsored  scheme  with  a  75:25 \nsharing pattern between the central Government and ASG. This will change to 50:50 from the \nnext  5-year  plan  that  will  commence  from  April  2007).  However,  given  ASG\u2019s  precarious \nfinancial condition, it is likely to be constrained in providing the requisite state share. This could \n\nExpenditure Orientation \n\n\f36\n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\njeopardize the implementation of the Sarva Shiksha Mission, which is the biggest investment for \nuniversal elementary education in the state.  \n \n17. \nHealth.  The  trend  of  budgetary  allocation  to  the  health  sector  in  Assam  shows  a \ncontinuous decline. One notable feature is the decline in plan allocation from 50% in FY1998 to \n30.1%  in  FY2003.  This  indicates  that  development  activities  concerning  health  are  being \ncontinuously downsized given salary expenditures. A breakdown of government expenditure on \nhealth  suggests  that  the  nonsalary  component  suffered  the  most  because  of  the  decline  in \nbudgetary share.  \n \n18. \nTransport. ASG\u2019s transport sector illustrates the deleterious effects of lack of adequate \ncapital  expenditure  and  project  prioritization  leading  to  unbalanced  and  inefficient  capital \nexpenditure  allocations.  From  FY1999  to  FY2003,  capital  expenditure  increased  as  a  whole \nfrom Rs1.37 billion to Rs1.86 billion. However, the dominant share of that expenditure was on \nroads  and  bridges  with  the  balance  being  on  road  transport  (i.e.,  Assam  State  Transport \nCorporation) with no capital outlay on inland water transport. For roads and bridges, most of the \ncapital  outlay  was  on  rural  roads  with  a  small  quantum  on  state  highways  and  major  district \nroads  leading  to  a  capital  expenditure  backlog  of  Rs500  billion.  This  meant  that  capital \ninvestment  planning  was  insufficient  for  capital  expenditure  to  be  effectively  prioritized  both \nwithin a subsector (such as roads and bridges), and within the sector, given financing for Assam \nState Transport Corporation to meet its operating deficits and failure to provide capital outlay for \ninland water transport. \n \n19. \nIrrigation  and  Water  Supply.  The  irrigation  sector  illustrates  rising  departmental \nexpenditures on salaries and wages with resulting cutbacks on operation and maintenance, and \nan  absence  of  due  consideration  for  the  effects  on  rural  and  agricultural  growth.  Thus,  the \nrevenue expenditure trend in the irrigation sector for the past 13 years from FY1991 to FY2003 \nshows a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11%, albeit with significant fluctuations from \nFY2000  to  FY2003.8  The  expenditure  on  salaries  and  wages  also  implies  that  operation  and \nmaintenance  expenditures  were  correspondingly  severely  constrained  by  the  Irrigation \nDepartment.  Instead  of  careful  consideration  of,  for  example,  Tenth  Finance  Commission \nnorms, under which operation and maintenance expenditure of Rs0.23 billion would be required, \nonly about Rs0.03 billion was actually made available. The resultant impact of such inadequate \ndepartmental  expenditure  criteria  and  management  has  been  the  poor  creation  of  irrigation \npotential in Assam as compared with the national average.9   \n \nE. \n \n20. \nCore  Governance  Reform  Path.  The  diagnostic  assessment  of  public  administration \nand  public  sector  enterprises  in  Assam  shows  that  certain  priority  core  governance  measures \nare  needed  to  underpin  fiscal  stabilization  in  the  first  subprogram  and  set  the  necessary \nfoundation  for  fiscal  consolidation  in  the  second  subprogram.  These  measures  include \ndevelopment  of  reliable  employee  data  for  containment  of  the  overall  size  of  the  government, \nfunctional  reviews  for  key  expenditure  departments,  and  containment  of  public  expenditure \nleakage  and  corruption  through  expenditure  tracking  surveys  and  review  of  anticorruption \n\nCore Governance \n\n                                                           \n8   In FY2000 revenue expenditure was Rs0.36 billion and rose to Rs0.8 billion in FY2001 before declining to around \nRs0.55 billion in FY2002 and FY2003. The main component of irrigation sector revenue expenditure is salaries and \nwages (over 95%) and the fluctuations  therefore reflect the arrears because of the recommendations of the Fifth \nPay Commission as well as transfers of employees from completed schemes. \n\n9   In India as a whole, the irrigation potential created is approximately 68% of the total assessed irrigation potential; in \n\nAssam, this is less than 11%.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n  37\n\nfinancial  governance  and  social  safety  net  programs \n\nmechanisms and procedures. Such measures enable deeper public administration restructuring \nunder  the  second  subprogram.  Demonstrable  achievement  of  closure  of  identified  PSEs  and \nrelated \nfostering  private  sector \nopportunities enable a PSE restructuring and private sector policy implementation thrust under \nthe second subprogram.  \n \n21. \nPublic  Administration.  Like  other  states  in  the  northeast,  absence  of  alternative \nemployment  avenues  has  led  to  the  development  of  the  role  of  ASG  as  a  primary  provider  of \nemployment.  The  resulting  government  overemployment,10  coupled  with  comparatively  high \nwages has eroded the ability of the state to invest in infrastructure and critically undermined the \nability of ASG to ensure adequate, well-targeted, and quality public goods and services related \nto poverty reduction. \n \n22.  Weaknesses  of  the  underlying  employee  data  collection  and  recording  in  Assam  have \nimpeded  the  systematic  identification  of  nonessential  posts  at  different  levels  of  various \ndepartments  so  that  excess  human  resources  can  be  reduced  proportionately  in  time. \nConsequently,  efforts  since  1999,  first  by  the  State-Level  Empowered  Committee  and \nsubsequently by the Assam Administrative Reforms Commission to identify such posts have not \nsucceeded.  \n \nA  diagnostic  study  of  ASG\u2019s  Education  Department,11  which  provides  examples  of \n23. \nconcern  on  quality  of  public  expenditure  and  performance  orientation,  illustrates  the  need  for \nfunctional reviewing. Whereas, elementary education has an overall pupil-teacher ratio of 40:1 \nthe  nonobjective  placement  of  teachers  results  in  substantial  interdistrict  disparities.  For \nexample,  Dhubri  district  has  a  pupil-teacher  ratio  of  58:1  and  Goalpara  district  48:1.  Although \nthe  number  of  high  schools  has  increased  ten-fold  from  FY1951  to  FY1998  and  enrolment  of \nhigh  and  higher  secondary  schools  increased  two-fold  from  FY1981  to  FY1998,  during  this \nsame  period,  the  dropout  rate  increased  faster  than  the  national  average.  Furthermore,  from \n1997 to 2000, only 32.6% of students passed the state\u2019s high school leaving examination. \n \n24. \nIn  addition  to  the  size  and  qualitative  performance  of  the  government  bureaucracy  in \nAssam,  there  are  also  indications  of  vulnerability  to  leakage  of  public  expenditures  under  its \ntrust.  Again,  taking  the  example  of  the  Education  Department,  a  limited  high-level  public \nexpenditure  tracking  survey  was  conducted  on  an  ongoing  scheme  called  Operation \nBlackboard.  The  scheme  was  undertaken  to  help  provide  teaching-learning  equipment  for \nprimary schools. Material supply under Operation Blackboard was tracked from the directorate \nto the district, from the district to blocks, and from the blocks to schools. Allowing for significant \ndata  constraints,  in  many  cases  the  quality  of  materials  like  desk  benches  were  poor  and \nbroken, and record keeping at block and school level was poor, so that they had no clarity on \nthe number and time of receipt of material.  \n \n25. \nPublic  Sector  Enterprises.  The  47  PSEs  in  the  PSE  sector  are  involved  in  a  broad \nrange of sectors in the state economy: inland and water transport (excluding ASEB), housing, \nfinance,  textiles,  water  and  sewerage,  petrochemicals,  gas  transportation,  construction, \nwarehousing  and  logistics,  retail,  agricultural  production  and  processing,  tourism,  electronics, \n\n                                                           \n10  Overemployment  is  evidenced  both  by  number  of  government  employees  to  population  (20.51  per  1,000 \npopulation)  and  as  a  percentage  of  GSDP  (7.76%),  which  is  higher  than  other  states  (Andhra  Pradesh  5.25%, \nKarnataka 4.99%, West Bengal 6.10%)  according to FY2001 data. Within such overemployment, the  numbers in \ngrades  III  and  IV  are  skewed.  As  an  example,  the  Elementary  Education  Directorate  has  37  grade  I  employees, \n234 grade II employees, 123,969 grade III employees, and 7,993 grade IV employees. \n\n11 The Education Department had 208,827 employees (1998 data) and is one of the largest ASG departments. \n\n\f38\n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\ntea  plantation,  manufacturing  and  contract  assembly,  welfare  support  to  minority  and \ndisadvantaged sections of society, state promotional activity, industrial development parks, and \npaper  and  paper-derived  industry.  The  PSEs  differ  in  business  purpose;  some  are  welfare \ndriven or act as tools for implementing ASG policy and are not businesses as such. \n \nThe financial condition of the PSE sector is not sound. Of the 47 PSEs, only around 6 \n26. \nare profitable; most have large negative equity positions. State investment has taken the form of \ndirect  equity,  loans,  and  grants/subsidies,  and  indirect  support  when  standing  as  guarantor  to \nPSE loans from financial institutions. Data collection to assess the condition of the PSE sector \nhas  been  particularly  difficult,  as  the  average  years  in  arrears  in  PSE  submission  of  audited \nfinancial statements is about 8 years. Based on the latest provisional statements from 25 PSEs, \nrepresenting  around  87%  of  state  investment  in  the  sector  excluding  ASEB  (as  per  DPE \nrecords),  the  total  state  investment  in  the  sector  is  estimated  at  Rs14.07  billion.  The  annual \nASG contribution to the PSEs is estimated to be around Rs0.44 billion per year. Based on the \nprovisional accounts of the 25 PSEs, the annual losses of the total PSE sector are estimated to \nbe  around  Rs1  billion\u20131.2  billion  per  annum.  As  a  result  of  the  losses  exceeding  the  annual \ncontribution, the value of state investment in the PSEs has been eroding continuously.  \n \n27. \nASG has reached a critical stage in its investment in this sector. With such a position of \nnegative equity, PSEs have no capacity to meet their outstanding and growing liabilities. These \nliabilities are mainly in the form of employee entitlements, statutory dues, and overdue financial \nloans  (principal  and  interest).  In  respect  to  these  outstanding  liabilities,  ASG  has  an  explicit \ncontingent liability where it has guaranteed specific PSE loans. In respect to the balance, ASG, \nas shareholder, knew of the poor state of the financial affairs in the particular PSEs when these \nliabilities were incurred.  \n \n28.  With  likely  annual  losses  of  Rs1  billion\u20131.2  billion  per  annum,  and  banks  and  financial \ninstitutions  unlikely  to  provide  additional  loans  given  the  poor  repayment  track  record  of  the \nPSEs,  ASG  will  need  to  provide  more  explicit  funding  to  these  PSEs.  The  clear  trend  is  for \nPSEs to be an increasing and significant burden on state finances. The one positive systemic \nfactor for ASG in the PSE portfolio is the value tied up in land and buildings in the PSEs. While \nthe  land  and  buildings  could  represent  significant  value,  no  comprehensive  assessment  has \nbeen made of this value in the sector.  \n \nF. \n \nResource Mobilization. Since FY2000, revenue collections from own taxes in the state \n29. \nhave  improved  significantly.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  concerted  efforts  in  improving  both  the \nstructure and operation of the sales tax system, including efforts to clear the arrears. Adopting a \nvalue-added tax has been actively on the agenda from April 2003 and preparation to introduce \nthe tax is to be intensified. \n \n30. \nDebt  Management.  ASG  opted  for  the  debt  swap  scheme  announced  by  the  central \nGovernment.  In  addition,  ASG  has  negotiated  debt  settlements  with  financial  institutions, \nincluding  Industrial  Financial  Corporation  of  India  and  Industrial  Credit  and  Investment \nCorporation of India Limited in FY2003. It is expected to negotiate similar settlements with the \nIndustrial  Development  Bank  of  India,  the  Housing  and  Urban  Development  Corporation,  and \nother  banks  during  FY2005.  The  state  has  been  successful  in  negotiating  favorable  one-time \nsettlements  with  financial  institutions  as  it  involved  the  payment  of  only  75%  of  the  principal \noutstanding and the full waiver of interest and other penalties. In its negotiations with the banks, \nthe settlement has been successful though less favorable than those with financial institutions. \nThe settlement with the banks involved the payment of 100% principal and only a minor part of \n\nASG Reform Achievements \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n  39\n\nthe  interest  payable.  Additionally,  ASG  has  successfully  rescheduled  loans  overdue  of  Rs2.3 \nbillion  to  the  Housing  and  Urban  Development  Corporation,  which  involved  waivers  of \ncompound and penal interest totaling Rs1.45 billion. \n \n31. \nPublic  Administration.  The  developments  that  reflect  the  political  and  bureaucratic \ncommitment  for  reforming  public  administration  are  (i)  the  three  interim  reports  of  Assam \nAdministrative Reforms Commission in 2003 and 2004, and the stage of action taken by ASG \nfor their implementation; (ii) the decision to reduce the size of the Council of Ministers from 35 to \n19 consequent to the 91st Constitutional amendment; (iii) based on the recommendation of the \nAssam  Administrative  Reforms  Commission,  the  in-principle  decision  to  reduce  the  number  of \ndepartments from 54 to 25; (iv) measures for devolution of functions and transfer of schemes to \nelected  local  bodies  in  pursuance  of  the  73rd  and  74th  Constitutional  amendments;  (v) \nestablishment  of  the  High-Powered  Committee  under  the  chief  secretary  to  consider  and \nrecommend  action  to  ASG  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Assam  Administrative  Reforms \nCommission;  and  (vi)  the  ongoing  efforts  of  ASG  to  restructure  the  civil  service  and  contain \nsalary  costs  subsequent  to  undertakings  under  the  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the \nGovernment  of  India  in  2003,  which  are  being  overseen  by  the  State-Level  Empowered \nCommittee. \n \n32. \nInformation  Technology  Initiatives.  AMTRON  (one  of  the  PSEs  in  Assam)  has \ndeveloped the Assam Wide Area Network program, under which a fiber-optic backbone is being \nprogressively run to all state district commissioners\u2019 offices. Two districts (Nagaon and Tezpur) \nare  already  connected,  with  Silchar  and  Bongaigaon  to  follow  in  August  2004,  and  Jorhat  in \nOctober  2004.  With  the  objective  of  integrated  financial  management,  a  centralized  treasury \nmanagement information system is being executed by ASG. The Treasury system is now being \npiloted  in  the  Dispur  Treasury.  It  will  shortly  be  extended  to  the  Kamrup  and  New  Guwahati \ntreasuries,  and  to  the  Finance  (Budget  Department)  for  budget  formulation.  Seventy-seven  of \nthe Tax offices are computerized and interlinked throughout the state.

State finance reforms for fiscal stabilization will support additional fiscal \nresources that can be used for poverty-focused social sector expenditure and some user fee reforms enabling better \ntargeting  of  the  poor  as  well  as  enhanced  infrastructure  spending,  fostering  economic  growth  and  contributing  to \npoverty  reduction.  The  fiscal  governance  reform  promoting  a  sharpened  level  of  attention  to  growth-oriented  capital \nexpenditure, including the core investment program, and enabling pro-poor budgeting  will also help in strengthening \npoverty  reduction  efforts.  Finally,  core  governance  reforms  that  stem  unproductive  subsidies  on  public  sector \nenterprises (PSEs), for example,  will free up resources for targeted subsidies to the poor. Core governance reforms \naimed at improving the quality of public administration expenditure and stopping corruption related to fiscal leakages \nwill  also  assist  expenditures  reaching  the  poor.  In  addition,  core  governance  promotion  of  alternative  avenues  of \ngrowth  and  employment  through  the  private  sector  will  help  to  address  poverty.  Since  development  is  intricately \nrelated  to  quality  of  governance  as  indicated  in  the  recent  Human  Development  Report  for  Assam  (2003)  and  poor \nmanagement of public institutions for service delivery has been identified as a major cause of poverty as indicated by \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) supported participatory poverty assessments in the state, the Program will contribute \nto poverty reduction. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nPoverty  monitoring  and  poverty  impact  assessment  for  the  loan  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  Handbook  on \nPoverty and Social Analysis (Section III, para. 44 and appendices 2.4, 3.4, 9.2). The likely poverty and social impacts \nof the Program have been identified and indicated in the  supplementary appendix table on Matrix of Poverty Impact \nand  Mitigation  Assessment  (Supplementary  Appendix  H).  Poverty  monitoring  and  poverty  impact  assessment  will \nensure that appropriate mitigation measures are introduced where necessary and the Program contributes to poverty \nreduction as intended. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nExtensive consultations were held with the Assam state government (ASG), civil society organizations, and the private \nsector and poor people were also consulted during ADB-supported participatory poverty assessments carried out in \nthe state.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe  consultations  were  intended  for  feedback  on  the  priorities  for  poverty  reduction  and  policy  reform.  The  policy-\nbased reform program at the macro level has, as an integral part, a public awareness component provided under the \n\n  Yes        \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n71  \n\nProject, supporting further participation.  \n\n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nSubprogram 1 of the Program will not have any specific adverse impacts on women. It will support the setting up of a \nfiscal management unit that will strengthen the poverty focus and growth orientation of ASG expenditures. Based on \nits  analysis  and  impact  assessments  the  scope  of  subprogram  2  can  incorporate  effective  pro-poor  budgeting \n(including geographic, gender, and sector targeting based on poverty analysis).  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

ASG  will \nimplement the user fee revisions only after this review. \n \nRestructuring  of  state  public  enterprises  could  affect \nregular  employment  and  living  standards.  However,  this \nwill  be  taken  care  of  by  an  appropriately  designed  social \nsafety  net  program  to  encourage  self-employment  and \nprovide financial counseling. \n  \nAbout  20%  of \nin  Assam  comprises \nscheduled  tribes  and  indigenous  people.  However,  this \nProgram will not have any specific adverse impacts on the \nindigenous people.
