The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES  \n\n \nA. \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \n                                                \n1  The project team will seek endorsement from ADB\u201fs Investment Committee on pricing and material terms based on \n\nan updated financial analysis prior to ADB entering into the loan agreement with Inecobank. \n\n\f2 \n \n\nIn  most  developing  countries,  SMEs  act  as  an  important  engine  of  growth  and  a  key \n2. \ncontributor  to  poverty  reduction  by  creating  employment,  increasing  individual  incomes,  and \ngenerating  tax  revenues.  In  Armenia,  in  2009  SMEs  accounted  for  97.7%  of  businesses,  and \ncontributed  42.5%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  42.2%  of  employment, \nrepresenting a doubling of the SME contribution to the economy since 1999.2  The SME share \nof Armenia\u201fs export volume has also risen, reaching 17.9% in 2009 from 14.3% in 2003. SMEs \nhave  made  a  significant  contribution  to  the  creation  of  new  jobs  in  the  country,  particularly \noutside the capital Yerevan.  \n \n3. \nProviding  financial  support  to  SMEs  in  the  form  of  medium-  and  long-term  funding  is \nessential  for  SMEs  to  invest  in  the  technology  and  capital  they  need  to  increase  their \nproductivity  and  competitiveness.  However,  access  to  finance  remains  a  major  obstacle  for  a \nmajority  of  businesses  in  Armenia.  3 Armenia  relies  heavily  on  remittances  as  a  source  of \ncapital,  and  this  is  particularly  true  for  informal  SMEs.  The  global  economic  slowdown, \nparticularly  as  it  affects  the  Russian  Federation,  may  slow  growth  in  remittances  and  this \nsource of financing is not likely to be as reliable as it was prior to the crisis.4 Moreover, private \nsector credit was only 23.7% of GDP in 2009 and 27.1% of GDP in 2010, lower than Armenia\u201fs \nsimilarly  rated  peers  and  other  countries  in  the  region.5 Much  of  the  recent  increase  in  bank \nlending  has  not  reached  SMEs,  especially  outside  Yerevan.  Historically,  banks  have  been \ndisinclined to lend other than to large top-tier enterprises, citing lack of collateral, poor business \nplans, and lack of transparency on the part of prospective borrowers.  \n \n4. \nBank loans are the dominant form of external financing for SMEs in Armenia. Banks look \nto  SMEs  to  diversify  their  loan  portfolios  and  improve  interest  margins.  The  growth  in  SME \nfinancing  has  been  supported  by  development  finance  institutions  (DFIs),  such  as  German \ndevelopment  cooperation  through  KfW,  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development, \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), and the World Bank, through the provision of funds and \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  Armenian  banks.  However,  SME  financing  remains  inadequate, \nand  the  financing  gap  is  expected  to  increase  as  a  result  of  the  expiry  of  some  DFI  facilities, \ncoupled with past SME unmet funding needs, continued growth of the SME sector, and limited \nability of the banks to raise medium-term funds. The local bond market is underdeveloped and \ndormant, and local banks are only able to obtain facilities from international commercial banks \non a short-term basis or linked to specific projects.  \n \n5. \nArmenia  was  identified  as  a  candidate  for  an  ADB-supported  SME  financing  program \nbecause of the financial obstacles experienced by its SMEs, its banking sector\u201fs relatively good \nhealth and their readiness to accept such facilities, and ADB\u201fs goal to expand its private sector \noperations  in  the  region  and  reach  more  A  and  B  countries6.  SME  term  facilities  are  being \noffered to several banks simultaneously to (i) increase the development impact of the program \non the overall market; (ii) enable creditworthy banks that have experience in providing financing \nto SMEs to compete, as much as possible, on an equal basis; and (iii) diversify ADB\u201fs exposure \nto  Armenian  banks.  Four  banks  were  selected  for  the  program  based  on  their  (i)  desire  and \n                                                \n2   Small  and  Medium  Entrepreneurship  Development  National  Center  of  Armenia.  2010.

The median ratio of private credit to GDP is 36% for BB-rated countries and 27% for \nB-rated countries. In 2009, the ratio was 35% for Caucasus and Central Asia, 75% for Central and Eastern Europe, \nand 163% for OECD countries. \n\n6  ADB. 2010 Classification and Graduation of Developing Member Countries.

Each  bank  has  loans  from  other  IFIs,  but  in \naggregate these loans fall short of the banks\u201f projected SME lending pipeline. The program will \nallow  ADB  to  develop  partnerships  with  key  Armenian  banks  to  further  financial  sector \ndevelopment.  The  program  is  ADB\u201fs  first  activity  (public  or  private)  in  the  country  to  promote \nSMEs.   \n \n6. \nACBA  Credit  Agricole Bank.  Ranked first in Armenia in terms of total assets, lending, \nand capital as of the end of 2010, ACBA Credit Agricole Bank (ACBA) is the leader in lending to \nthe agriculture sector with over 51% share of the market.7 Loans to SMEs accounted for 44% of \nthe bank\u201fs portfolio at the end of Q2 2011. ADB and ACBA have been discussing possible areas \nof collaboration since 2007. ACBA was selected based on its large branch network, particularly \noutside of Yerevan, its large SME loan book, and its relatively long history as a major bank in \nArmenia. \n \n7. \nArdshininvestbank.  As  Armenia\u201fs  fifth-largest  bank  in  terms  of  assets  and  fourth  in \nterms  of  capital  and  deposits  in  2010,  Ardshininvestbank  (ASHIB)  has  the  largest  branch \nnetwork outside Yerevan and it is the second-largest lender to industry and agriculture (footnote \n7). Loans to SMEs as a share of ASHIB\u201fs portfolio grew to 32.9% at the end of Q2 2011. ADB \nand ASHIB began discussing possible partnerships in 2008. ASHIB was selected based on its \nbranch  network,  its  strong  customer  base  in  both  agriculture  and  industry,  and  history  as  a \nmajor bank in Armenia. \n \n8. \nAmeriabank.  As  the  second-largest  bank  in  Armenia  in  terms  of  assetsand  capital  in \n2010,  Ameriabank  (Ameria)  is  the top  lender to  industry  and  the transport  and  communication \nsector.  Loans to SMEs represented 21.4% of Ameria\u201fs portfolio at the end of Q2 2011. Ameria \napproached ADB in early 2010 to look for opportunities to collaborate. Ameria was selected due \nto  its  progressive  management  that  is  committed  to  adopting  international  best  practices,  its \ndemonstrated ability to execute its stated strategy, and its desire to expand its SME portfolio. \n \n9. \nInecobank. Ranked 12th for assets and 10th for lending in 2010, Inecobank (Ineco) has \ntraditionally supported micro and small enterprises. Its SME portfolio  is about the same size as \nthe largest banks. It was among the first in the market to apply cash-flow analysis in its lending \npractices.  ADB  provided  a  $3  million,  4-year  loan  to  Ineco  in  2008  as  part  of  a  program  to \nsupport  microfinance  institutions  and  small  business  banks.  Ineco  was  selected  based  on  its \ngood track record with ADB and its ongoing commitment to provide financial services to lower-\nincome segments of the population.  \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview, Ownership, and Strategy \n\nACBA.  ACBA  was  established  in  1996  with  help  from  the  European  Union  and  Credit \n10. \nAgricole,  the  bank\u201fs  largest  shareholder  (28%  ownership).  Remaining  shares  belong  to  10 \nagricultural cooperatives from all regions of Armenia. While the bank began with the distribution \nof very short-term micro-loans to farmers, it started issuing loans to SMEs in 1999 and is now a \nuniversal  bank  offering  a  full  range  of  services  through  41  branches  across  all  of  Armenia\u201fs \nprovinces.  ACBA\u201fs  strategy  continues  to  be  focused  on  agriculture  (farms  and  farmers). \nHowever, loans to SMEs as a customer segment (including SMEs in agribusiness) has grown to \nmake up the largest share of the bank\u201fs portfolio and it strives to maintain its market leadership \nin small  business financing  products  and leasing.  ACBA  is  rated  Ba3  (stable)  by  Moody\u201fs  and \n                                                \n7  Arminfo Independent News Agency.  2011 Analysis (Ranking) of the banking sector of Armenia. Yerevan. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\nBB  (stable)  by  Fitch  (one  notch  higher  than  the  sovereign  to  reflect  support  from  its  largest \nshareholder, Credit Agricole, rated AA\u2212 [stable]). \n\n11. \nAmeria.  Ameria  is  a  full-service  commercial  and  investment  bank  owned  by  TDA \nHoldings  since  2007  (99.9%),  which  in  turn  is  95%  owned  by  Ruben  Vardanian,  founder  of \nTroika  Dialog  Group,  a  top  investment  bank  in  the  Russian  Federation.  Ameria  is  the  leading \nbank in renewable energy and has the largest hydropower portfolio in Armenia. Ameria benefits \nfrom  an  energetic,  progressive,  and  professional  management  team  that  has  been  able  to \nrapidly transform the bank into one of the country\u201fs top financial institutions. Ameria had higher \nlevels  of  capital  and  liquidity  during  the  crisis  than  other  banks,  enabling  it  to  draw  select \ncorporate  clients  away  from  top  banks.  In  2010  Ameria  adopted  a  new  strategy,  seeking  to \ncapitalize on its reputation to expand its SME and retail operations; the latter will provide Ameria \nwith greater access to retail deposits. Ameria aims to reduce its large-borrower concentration by \nexpanding its lending focus to SMEs and their employees, and increasing its SME lending from \n21%  to  about  one-third  of  its  portfolio  by  2013.  Ameria  plans  to  expand  its  currently  small \nbranch  network  both  organically  and  through  further  acquisitions.  Ameria  is  not  yet  rated,  but \nplans to obtain a rating by 2014. \n \n12. \nASHIB.  ASHIB  is  a  full-service  financial  institution  offering  corporate,  SME,  and \nconsumer loans. ASHIB\u201fs primary beneficial shareholder is Karen Safaryan (83% ownership), a \nRussian citizen of Armenian origin who holds interests in mining and food across Armenia and \nthe Russian Federation. In December 2007, the IFC acquired a 10% stake in ASHIB. During the \ncrisis ASHIB adopted more restrictive lending policies and its market position in terms of assets \nweakened  from  second  in  2008  to  fifth  in  2010.  ASHIB  recently  completed  a  comprehensive \nbottom-up  analysis  of  its  business  to  understand  the  profitability  dynamics  of  its  products  and \nmarket  segments.  As  a  result  ASHIB  restructured  its  organization  and  has  started  to  classify \nclients and differentiate its strategy between market segments. ASHIB is also launching a cards \nprocessing  center  through  which  it  plans  to  offer  its  customers  a  full  suite  of  products  and \nservices,  including  payment  services,  which  will  help  increase  dram  deposits.  Moody\u201fs  rates \nASHIB\u201fs long-term global local currency deposit rating at Ba2 (stable).  \n \n13. \nIneco.  Ineco  is  37%  owned  by  Avetis  Baloyan,  who  is  also  the  bank\u201fs  chief  executive \nofficer,  and  33%  owned by  Karen  Safaryan,  the  primary  owner  of  ASHIB.  IFC  owns  10%  and \nDeutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellshaft owns 13.5%. SME financing has long been \na strategic business line for Ineco; more than half of its loans have historically been devoted to \nSMEs, with the balance in retail and microlending.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n19. \nThe  program  will  provide  US  dollar-denominated  senior  unsecured  loans  totaling  up  to \n$65 million to ACBA, ASHIB, Ameria, and Ineco. Ineco\u201fs loan will be extended upon approval of \nthe Investment Committee of material terms and conditions based on updated due diligence and \npricing closer to the target date of funding. The loans to the PFIs will be offered in parallel with \ncapacity  development  TA  to  enhance  the  banks\u201f  SME  lending  capabilities  and  for  product \ndevelopment.8 The  funding  needs  for  each  PFI\u201fs  SME  loan  portfolio  over  the  loan  availability \nperiod was carefully assessed and compared with recently signed and anticipated facilities from \nother IFIs to estimate the funding gap.  \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Financial Institutions (Phase 2). Manila (TA 7707-REG). \n\n\f5 \n\n \n\n20. \nProgram  parameters.  The  loan  agreements  with  the  PFIs  must  be  signed  within  2 \nyears of Board approval. The loan agreements have common criteria for onlending, including (i) \na common SME definition that is suited to the market and conforms  to the government\u201fs SME \ndefinition; (ii) subloan amount limits; and (iii) targets aimed at increasing SME subloans outside \nYerevan,  where  the  poverty  rate  is  higher.  Borrowers  will  have  the  option  to  convert  the \ncurrency of repayment from US dollars to dram, if and when ADB is able to execute a currency \nconversion on agreeable terms and conditions. The TA offered to PFIs will be tailored to each \nbank\u201fs needs, will complement TA provided by other IFIs or government agencies, and focus on \nbuilding bank capacity to lend to SMEs (footnote 11).  \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n21. \nThe program-based approach results in more uniform intervention by ADB in SMEs and \nefficiencies in implementation (i.e., in legal documentation and expenses), TA processing, and \nongoing monitoring. For monitoring, the proposed terms of the loan agreement will require the \nbanks  to  provide  the  following  information:  (i)  unaudited  financial  statements  on  a  quarterly \nbasis;  (ii)  audited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis;  (iii)  compliance  certificates  for \nagreed-upon  financial  covenants  on  a  quarterly  basis;  and  (iv)  reports  on  the  subloans  on  a \nsemiannual basis. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB on a regular basis \n(at  least  annually)  based  on  the  Operations  Manual  section  on  nonsovereign  operations.9 The \nfirst monitoring report will be submitted no later than 12 months after Board approval. \n \n22.  Many  SMEs  in  Armenia  import  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  from  or  are \nengaged  in  trade  with  both  members  and  nonmembers  of  ADB  (including  the  Russian \nFederation),  and  a  request  for  Board  approval  is  therefore  being  made,  pursuant  to  the  ADB \nCharter,  to  approve  procurement  from  nonmembers  in  appropriate  circumstances. 10  Board \napproval  on  this  issue  is  being requested with respect to procurement  by  SME  sub  borrowers \nusing  loan  proceeds  under  the  program.  This  request  reflects  the  market-based  nature  of  the \ninvestment program, trade agreements, and SME demand and procurement history. \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n23. \nThe program will provide critically needed funding to SMEs. The program will support the \nbanking  system  by  providing  funding  to  banks  whose  ability  to  raise  funds  is  constrained  by \nArmenia\u201fs underdeveloped finance sector and further limited by the financial crisis. The program \ndifferentiates itself from other DFI assistance in several ways: (i) it is the first SME loan known \nto  incorporate  the  government\u201fs  definition  of  SME,  assuring  that  the  types  of  enterprises \ntargeted by public policy makers are served; (ii) it requires banks to devote a minimum share of \nproceeds  to  SME  loans outside  Yerevan,  where  the  poverty  rate  is  higher;  and (iii)  it  sets  the \ngroundwork for the first known effort to collect sex-disaggregated data from banks to understand \ntheir  lending  practices toward  SMEs  owned by  women. Through  the TA, the  program  will  also \n                                                \n9   ADB. 2010. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10. Manila. \n10 ADB. 1966.

However, due diligence \nhas ascertained that the PFIs identified have appropriate risk management processes in place \nand  are  taking  steps  to  improve  their  risk  underwriting  and  portfolio  monitoring  capability. \nAdditionally,  the  TA  is  expected  to  help  the  banks  strengthen  their  SME  lending  practices \n(footnote 11).   \n \nForeign  exchange  risk.   ADB\u201fs investment will be denominated in US dollars and, as \n25. \nsuch, there is foreign exchange risk.  If there are currency fluctuations, performance of the PFIs \nmay  be  impacted.    However,  this  is  partly  mitigated  by  (i)  the  PFIs\u201f  large  foreign  currency \ndeposits);  (ii)  the  additional  DFI  funding  being  made  available  in  local  currency;  and  (iii)  CBA \nguidelines  that  mandate  limited  open  foreign  exchange  positions.  Also,  the  facilities  may  be \nconverted  to  local  currencies  if  ADB  is  able  to  offer  such  an  option.    SMEs  that  borrow  from \nPFIs in US dollars and do not earn US dollar revenues could encounter similar risks. This risk is \nmitigated to some extent by the PFIs\u201f credit assessment processes and collateral requirements \nof  SME  subborrowers,  which  take  currency  mismatch  risk  into  consideration.  Since  the  crisis, \nthe  NPL  ratios  of  the  PFIs\u201f  SME  portfolios  have  not  differed  from  that  of  their  total  loan \nportfolios,  despite  being  heavily  weighted  by  US  dollar  loans.  Moreover,  many  SMEs  benefit \nfrom  remittance  inflows  in  foreign  currency,  as  over  a  third  of  Armenian  families  receive \nremittances from abroad. Since most consumption in Armenia is import-driven and the economy \nis  highly  dollarized,  businesses  often  and  are  able  to  adjust  their  prices  to  exchange  rate \nfluctuations. Finally, the CBA is taking steps to stabilize exchange rates.11  It is important to note \nthat  ADB\u201fs  loan  will  be  repaid  by  the  banks  from  the  entirety  of  their  operations,  and  not \nexclusively from their SME businesses. \n \n26. \nRefinancing  risk  and  program  sustainability.  Armenia\u201fs  banks  are  very  small  by \ninternational  standards  and  the  local  capital  markets  are  undeveloped.  This  limits  funding \nsources for banks, which must depend on deposits and DFI support. Once ADB\u201fs facility expires \nthere is a risk that PFIs will face challenges in obtaining additional financing. However, all PFIs \nhave  taken  steps  to  increase  their  deposit  base,  and  have  high  levels  of  US  dollar  deposits. \nThey also enjoy support from strong shareholders and other DFIs. The TA is also an important \ncomponent in enhancing the PFIs\u201f SME lending capabilities, which will ensure the program has \na long-lasting impact that extends beyond the deployment of ADB funding (footnote 11).  \n \n27. \nSlow  economic recovery. Armenia\u201fs recovery from the economic crisis is expected to \nbe slow in the medium term. GDP is predicted to expand by 4.0% in 2011 and 4.5% in 2012.12 \nSlow economic growth could reduce PFI lending and profitability, and put strains on the SMEs.  \n \n \n                                                \n11 IMF. 2011. Armenia: Program Note. http://www.imf.org/external/np/country/notes/pdf/armenia.pdf  (29 June). \n12  ADB. 2011. Asian Development Outlook 2011. Manila (Armenia country chapter). \n\n\f7 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nThe impact will be increased SME contribution to the economy to promote broad-based \n29. \ngrowth. Supporting SME activity can help raise SMEs\u201f contribution to employment, and hence to \nindividual  incomes,  particularly  outside  Yerevan.  SME  activity  enhances  entrepreneurship  and \ninnovation,  which  will  help  Armenia  increase  its  competitiveness.  SMEs  can  help  diversify \nArmenia\u201fs economy beyond areas such as metals and mining and break down oligopolies. The \noutcome will be access by banks to medium-term funding, which will also result in an improved \nasset\u2013liability  profile  for  the  PFIs.    This  will  enable  PFIs  to  extend  medium-term  funding  to \nSMEs.  The  outputs  will  be  providing  banks  with  additional  funds  for  onlending  to  SMEs.  The \nfunding provided to banks under the program will allow them to reach more SMEs and offer their \nSME  customers  more  financial  products  and  services.  Enabling  banks  to  provide  SMEs  with \nlonger-term  capital  will  allow  SMEs  to  invest  in  technology  and  equipment  to  increase  their \ngrowth  and  productivity.  The  TA  will  increase  the  capacity  of  banks  to  onlend  the  funds  more \nefficiently and with greater probability of repayment (footnote 11). \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n30. \nStrategy 2020 identifies private sector development and private sector operations as one \nof  the  five  drivers  of  change  to  mobilize  resources  to  help  alleviate  poverty  in  the  region.  \nFinancial  sector  development  is  noted  as  one  of  the  five  core  specializations  that  will  be \nundertaken  in  support  of  this  agenda.13 The  SME  Finance  Program  supports  private  sector \ndevelopment  through  financial  sector  development  by  increasing  the  capacity  and  ability  of \nArmenian banks to expand lending to urban and non-urban SMEs, which comprise an important \nand  underserved  portion  of  Armenia\u201fs  economy.  The  documents  that  detail  the  government\u201fs \nbroad  macroeconomic  objectives  repeatedly  emphasize  private  sector  operations  as  essential \nto  Armenia\u201fs  growth.14 ADB\u201fs  Economic  Report  and  Interim  Operational  Strategy,  2006\u20132009 \nfor Armenia cites that an underdeveloped finance sector, including lack of access to long-term \nfinancing,  is  a  major  bottleneck  to  private  sector  development.15 The  interim  strategy  directs \nADB  to  build  capacity  in  the  finance  sector  through  direct  intervention  in  banking  to  improve \nstandards,  governance,  and  liquidity  in  the  market.  The  program  meets  the  government\u201fs  and \nADB\u201fs  country  strategy  by  providing  Armenia\u201fs  banks  with  medium-term  debt  financing  and \ncapacity building to increase support for SMEs, which are an important segment of the private \nsector, and will aid its overall development.  \n  \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\nArmenia is at an early stage of finance sector development. Under the PSCM Business \n31. \nPlan and Priorities, 2010\u2013201216, ADB will assist stronger private banks with loans, equity, and \nTA  to  encourage  and  support  market  participants  at  the  forefront.  ADB  intervention  in  such \nsituations  will  likely  involve  a  long  process,  involving  repeat  and  follow-on  loans  from  ADB  or \nother  DFI  programs.  The  Financial  Sector  Operational  Plan  calls  for  enhanced  focus  on  the \n                                                \n13 ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\ntraditionally  underserved  (including  SMEs)  to  achieve  inclusive  growth,  one  of  the  three \nstrategic agendas of Strategy 2020. 17 The plan recognizes that the region\u201es SMEs have yet to \ngain  adequate  access  to  financial  services,  that  capacity  building  support  for  bank  and  end-\nborrowers  in  credit  assessment  needs  to  be  strengthened,  and  ADB\u201fs  performance  in  SME \nfinancing, where it has been less active, needs improvement.  This program will help to address \nthe prior gaps of capacity building through the provision of the TA. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions Summary \n\n \n\n32. \nThe program is classified under category FI for impacts on environment and involuntary \nresettlement, and category FI (treated as C) with respect to indigenous peoples. An assessment \nhas been made of (i) the program's potential environment and social safeguards impacts; (ii) the \nrisks associated with the PFls' existing and likely future portfolio; and (iii) the PFIs\u201f commitment, \nsystems,  and  capacity  for  managing  environmental  and  social  safeguards  impacts.  For  each \nPFI, existing environmental and social management systems (ESMSs) have been reviewed and \nareas  where  improvements  are  needed  have  been  identified;  effective  measures  to  address \nthem are laid out in the linked document describing ESMS arrangements. The PFls will ensure \nthat an ESMS satisfactory to ADB and compliant with ADB\u201fs Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nis  in  place  prior  to  first  disbursement  and  that  subloans  comply  with  the  agreed  ESMS  and \napplicable  national  laws  and  regulations.  PFIs  will  also  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment \nactivities list, and submit annual reports on ESMS implementation. \n \nA  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  and  PFls  are  encouraged  to  track  and report \n33. \nonlending  to  businesses  owned  or  led  by  women.  PFls  adopting  the  plan  will  receive \nimplementation assistance from ADB. Armenia has ratified all conventions with respect to core \nlabor  standards.  ASHIB  and  Ameria  have  adopted  standards  covering  labor  and  working \nconditions of their own staff and clients\u201f employees. All PFl annual reports will need to include \ninformation on compliance with core labor standards by PFI subborrowers using ADB funds. \n \nB. \n \n34. \nDue diligence on each PFI\u201fs anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer procedures \nwas  performed  and  verified  to  meet  all  requirements  of  the  CBA.  The  PFIs  were  advised  of \nADB\u201fs  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  its  policy  of  implementing  best \ninternational  practice  relating  to  the  combating  of  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of \nterrorism.  ADB  will  ensure \nincludes  appropriate \nthe \nanticorruption provisions and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.  \n \nC. \n \n35. \nThe  proposed  loans  are  within  the  medium-term  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \ninvestment  exposure  limits  for  nonsovereign  investments.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement \nEstablishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,18 the  Government  of  Armenia  will  be  requested  to \nconfirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  program.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance \ndocumentation in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of this proposal by \nthe Board of Directors. \n \n                                                \n17 ADB Financial Sector Development Community of Practice. 2011.
