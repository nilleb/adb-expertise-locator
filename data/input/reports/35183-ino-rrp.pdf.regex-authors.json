An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \nAssessment  The summary of findings is a core appendix.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project will support the Government\u2019s program to promote \nsustainable  and  community-managed  freshwater,  brackishwater \nand  marine  aquaculture  development  to  reduce  poverty  and \nincrease the food supply among poor fish-farming communities. It \nwill  focus  on  the  development  of  small-scale  and  low-cost \naquaculture production systems that are economically sound and \nenvironment friendly, and that can be easily replicated by fish \nfarmers  organizations  and  small-  to  medium-scale  private \nentrepreneurs. The Project will provide technical and extension \nsupport  to  fish  farmers  in  order  to  ensure  successful  project \nimplementation. Such support will include innovative mechanisms \nto assist organized fish farmer groups with securing production \ninputs and marketing their final product. The Project will build the \ncapacity of the Directorate General of Aquaculture (DGA) and the \nparticipating  district  governments  to  formulate  policies  and \nregulations  for  sustainable  aquaculture  development  and \nenvironmental  management,  and  to  support  the  needs  of  the \nbeneficiaries,  their  communities,  and  the  country\u2019s  aquaculture \nindustry as a whole. \n \nThe Project will be implemented in five districts in four provinces: \nnamely:  (i)  Langkat  in  North  Sumatera  Province,  (ii)  Ogan \nKomering Ilir (OKI) in South Sumatera Province, (iii) Karawang \nand  Sumedang  in  West  Java  Province,  and  (iv)  Buton  in \nSoutheast Sulawesi Province. \n   \nRationale  Aquaculture has been playing an increasingly significant role in \nIndonesia\u2019s  economy  providing  household  food  security, \ngenerating  valuable  foreign  exchange  and  domestic  revenues, \nboosting  international  trade  in  fish  and  aquatic  products,  and \nimproving  the  living  standards  of  poor  rural  communities  in \nIndonesia. It has been accepted as a viable alternative livelihood  \nfor fisherfolks engaged in open sea fishing and can help reduce \npressure on marine and coastal resources including the depleting \nfish  stock,  degrading  fish  habitats  and  declining  marine \nbiodiversity. \n   \n \n ", "ii     \n  However, the subsector is confronted with numerous problems \nthat need to be addressed urgently. These problems include (i) \nlow  growth  and  productivity  resulting  from  poor  fish-farming \nsystems  and  lack  of  good  quality  fish  and  shrimp  seed;  (ii) \nenvironmental degradation and pollution resulting from poor fish-\nfarm management and technology; (iii) lack and inaccessibility of \ncredit  for  poor  or  small-scale  fish  farmers;  (iv)  high  costs  of \nimported  production  inputs;  (v)  lack  of  social  preparation, \ninefficient extension services, and post-production facilities and \nmarketing  infrastructure;  and  (vi)  user  conflicts  in  open  water \nareas among fish farmers and other users. All these problems \nhave been acting as deterrents to aquaculture by small-scale fish \nfarmers. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  expected  impact  is  reduced  poverty  and  increased  food \nsecurity among Project beneficiaries. The outcome of the Project \nwill be sustainable increase in fish production in the five project \ndistricts.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is estimated at $44.52 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.92 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  equivalent  to  $33.3 \nmillion from the Special Funds resources (ADF) to help finance \nthe Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest charge of 1.00% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The loan \nwill finance 75% of the total project cost.

The  district \ngovernments  will  be  primarily  responsible  for  the  supervision, \ncoordination,  and  management  of  field-level  activities  in  their \nrespective districts. DGA, as the Executing Agency, will exercise \noversight responsibility for all project activities to ensure efficient \nand effective delivery of project inputs to target beneficiaries and \ntimely  completion  of  project  activities.  DGA  will  undertake \nnational-level  activities,  mainly  pertaining  to  policy  formulation, \noverall  coordination  of  capacity-building  interventions, \ncoordination of research and development, and supporting the \ndistrict governments in implementing local-level regulations and \nother  technical  aspects  of  the  Project,  such  as  aquaculture \ndevelopment,  environmental  and  fish  health  management,  and \nculture-based fisheries management. \n \n  A national steering committee (NSC) will be established to guide \nthe  overall  direction  of  the  Project,  ensure  interagency \ncoordination,  and  ensure  that  project  activities  mesh  with \ngovernment  aquaculture  policy.  NSC  will  be  supported  by  a \nnational technical committee (NTC) headed by the NSC secretary. \nAt the regional level, a regional advisory committee (RAC) will be \nestablished  in  each  project  province  to  oversee  project \ncoordination among the different local agencies and liaise with the \nNSC. A project management office (PMO) will be established in \nDGA, to be headed by a competent project director and staffed by \nan adequate number of competent technical, administrative, and \nfinancial personnel. At the district level, a project implementation \nunit  (PIU)  will  be  established  to  oversee  and  coordinate  the \nimplementation of field-level project activities.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  DGA of the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF)  \n   \nProcurement  Goods  and  services  financed  partly  or  wholly  by  ADB  will  be \nprocured in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nContract packages for goods exceeding $500,000 will be awarded \non  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Each \ncontract costing between $100,000 and $500,000 will be awarded \nthrough national competitive bidding (NCB). Minor equipment and \nmaterials  costing  less than  $100,000  will  be  procured  through \nshopping. Civil works contract packages exceeding $1,000,000 \nwill be awarded on the basis of ICB. Contract packages between \n$100,000 and $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of NCB. \nSmall  scale  civil  works  contracts  with  an  average  value  of \n$10,000\u2013$25,000 equivalent will follow procurement procedures \nfor community participation in procurement as contained in ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. \n   \n   \n ", "iv     \nConsulting Services  International and national specialists will be engaged through a \nconsulting firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe consultants will provide technical assistance to the Project at \nthe  central  and  regional  levels.  The  consulting  services \nrequirement  is  estimated  at  a  total  of  672  person-months, \ncomprising  56  international  and  616  national  person-months. \nLeast-cost selection and single source selection methods maybe \nused for NGO services and surveys, studies and research. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will increase incomes of 14,000 poor fish farmers by \nBeneficiaries  enhancing  aquaculture  production  and  productivity.  Apart  from \nincreased  aquaculture  production  and  income  and  employment \ngeneration,  the  Project  is  expected  to  generate  a  number  of \nbenefits that are not readily quantified, including (i) environmental \nbenefits  arising  from  improved  aquaculture  resources \nmanagement at the district and the scheme levels; (ii), improved \nnutrition and health of rural populations resulting from increased \nsupplies of animal protein and an overall expansion of the food \nsupply; (iii) strengthening of the national aquaculture agency and \nthe district fisheries services, which will gain improved capacity to \ntake the lead in aquaculture development on national and local \nlevels;  (iv)  enhanced  inter-agency  and  public-private  sector \nlinkages  through  strengthened  partnerships  in  aquaculture \ndevelopment; and (v) empowerment of small-scale fish farmers \nand rural communities with knowledge and skills in community-\nbased aquaculture and culture-based fisheries management. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The types of risks that may constrain the attainment of project \nobjectives  are  (i)  institutional  inadequacies  of  the  Executing \nAgency and Implementing Agencies, (ii) lack of cooperation and \ncoordination among government agencies and between national \nand local fisheries agencies, (iii) lack of government counterpart \nfunds, and (iv) possibility of misuse of project funds and facilities \nduring  project  implementation.  The  following  measures  should \nhelp minimize these risks: (i) strong commitment and involvement \nfrom MMAF and DGA management to support the Project and \noversee project implementation; (ii) effective capacity building at \ngovernment institutions and community levels; (iii) adoption of a \n\u201clearning approach\u201d to project implementation, whereby relatively \nnew technologies will be demonstrated and pilot-tested prior to \nfull-scale implementation; (iv) the establishment of linkages and \nthe fostering of close working relationships among fish farmers \norganizations, extension staff, participating rural communities, and \nthe private sector; (v) design and implementation of an effective \nmonitoring and reporting system, with a view toward obtaining \nprompt  feedback  and  enabling  timely  action;  (vi)  improved  \ntransparency  and  accountability  through  participating  project \nmanagement at the national, regional and field levels; and (vii) \nstrong ownership of the Project by various stakeholders. \n ", "     \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Sustainable Aquaculture Development for Food Security \nand Poverty Reduction Project.1 The Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Indonesian marine and fisheries sector, which includes aquaculture, plays a major \nrole in the national economy, contributing 25\u201330% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. \nGross output value from fisheries in 2005 was estimated at about $6.3 billion, or about 5% of \nthe output of the agriculture sector and 3% of the output of the entire economy. Indonesia is the \nninth largest fish producer and the tenth largest fish exporter in the world. From 1994\u20132005, fish \nproduction increased by an average 4.8% per year, from 4.01 million tons (t) in 1994 to an \nestimated 6.6 million t in 2005, with 66% of the production coming from capture fisheries and \nthe balance (34%) from aquaculture. Export revenues reached $1.68 billion in 1998 and were \nestimated at $1.91 billion in 2005. The country\u2019s exports of fish and aquatic products consist of \nshrimp, skipjack and Eastern little tuna, and other fish and aquatic species such as grouper, red \ntilapia, abalone, seaweeds, sea cucumber, pearls, and other mollusks. \n \n3.  Fish is a staple food item in the diet of Indonesian families, providing about two-thirds of \nthe total domestic animal protein supply. Among the different sources of animal protein, fish is \nstill relatively inexpensive and is, thus, the main source of protein for the poor. Fish has also \nbecome increasingly popular as a food item among higher income consumers as a result of its \npublicized health benefits. Per capita fish consumption in the country nearly doubled from a low \nof 12.8 kg/yr in 1982 to an estimated 22.67 kg/yr in 2005. From 1994\u20132005, average per capita \nfish consumption increased by about 2.67% per year. However, current per capita consumption \nis still lower than the per capita animal protein requirement of 26.55 kg recommended by the \nFood and Nutrition Study.2  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Sector Opportunities and Issues \n4.  Indonesia has an abundance of freshwater, brackishwater, and marine resources with \npotential for aquaculture development. It has a large variety of cultivable fish and other aquatic \nspecies  and  the  available  technology  for  aquaculture  in  fresh,  brackish,  and  marine \nenvironments. It has about 26 million ha of coastal/marine and freshwater areas suitable for \naquaculture, of which only about 680,000 ha, representing less than 3% of the total potential \narea,  are  currently  utilized  for  production.  Production  from  aquaculture  has  increased \ndramatically  since  the  late  1980s,  with  current  figures  for  the  major  commodities  (shrimp, \nmilkfish, tilapia, and carp) being at least double and at most four times 1988 levels. In 2005, the \ntotal  aquaculture  output  of  about  2.1  million  t  was  about  20%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  fish \nproduction. In the same year, fish and aquatic products generated combined foreign exchange \nearnings of over $2.1 billion. \n                                                 \n1  The Project was prepared under ADB 2003. Technical Assistance to the Government of Indonesia for Sustainable \nAquaculture Development for Food Security and Poverty Reduction. Manila (TA 4148-INO). \n2  Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. 2003. Annual Report of the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries for the \nYear 2002.Jakarta. ", "2     \n5.  Aquaculture has, therefore, been playing an increasingly significant role in ensuring food \navailability,  providing  household  food  security,  generating  valuable  foreign  exchange  and \ndomestic revenues, boosting exports of fish and aquatic products, and improving the living \nstandards of poor rural communities in Indonesia. Besides contributing almost one-quarter of \nthe country\u2019s estimated total fish production, the aquaculture subsector provides employment to \nsome 2.5 million people, which is about 40% of the total number of people employed in the \nfisheries sector. Aquaculture has absorbed much of the country's growing labor force, even if it \ndoes not generally pay well. Therefore, it has cushioned the economic hardship faced by people \nlooking for means of livelihood to support their families. \n \n6.  As Indonesia's growing population demand more fish and fish products, particularly in \nrural areas, and as production from artisanal capture fisheries is maintained at sustainable \nlevels, aquaculture is seen as an alternative source of high-quality animal protein and livelihood, \nespecially for lower income groups. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has projected \nthat aquaculture may soon surpass marine capture fisheries in providing high-quality animal \nprotein, employment, and export earnings. \n \n7.  However,  the  Indonesian  aquaculture  subsector  is  characterized  by  a  number  of \nproblems that need to be addressed to sustain production levels. These problems include (i) low \ngrowth and productivity resulting from poor fish-farming systems and lack of quality fish and \nshrimp  seed;  (ii)  environmental  degradation  and  pollution  resulting  from  poor  fish-farm \nmanagement and technology; (iii) lack and inaccessibility of credit for poor or small-scale fish \nfarmers;  (iv)  high  costs  of  imported  production  inputs;  (v)  absence  of  social  preparation, \ninefficient extension services, and lack of post-production facilities and marketing infrastructure, \nparticularly for use by small farmers; and (v) conflicts in water use in open water areas between \nfish farmers and other users. \n \n8.  The  industry  suffers  from  low  productivity  as  a  result  of  technical,  economic,  and \nenvironmental factors. Small-scale fish farmers usually practice extensive culture using low-\nyielding, low-input, and low-level technology, and lack the technical know-how or skills to adopt \nnew or improved production methods, techniques, and farming systems. Their problems are \ncompounded, in some areas, by the occurrence of fish or shrimp disease, which in turn is \nusually triggered by poor environmental quality, pollution, inferior seed quality, and/or poor \nhatchery and culture management. Small-scale fish farmers also lack the funds required to shift \nto higher-density farming or higher-value commodities. Moreover, problems associated with \npoor aquaculture system management have contributed to the image of aquaculture as a high-\nrisk industry, making financial institutions reluctant to provide credit to meet the production \nneeds of small-scale fish farmers, who must therefore rely on their own labor and meager \nfinancial resources for their subsistence culture operations. \n \n9.  The various problems outlined above have resulted in low incomes, poor quality of life, \nand high incidence of poverty among small-scale fish farmers. Their incomes fall way below the \nnational average and they have limited or no access to basic social infrastructure facilities and \nservices such as health, education, water supply and sanitation, transport, and communication. \nAs a result, literacy levels are low, mortality and morbidity rates are high, and more than one-\nthird of open sea fisherfolk and fish farmers live below the poverty line. \n \n10.  Law  32/2004  on  Regional  Government,  which  broadened  the  authority  of  regional \ngovernments, called for the devolution of fisheries management responsibilities from the central \ngovernment to the provincial and district governments. This has various implications on the \naquaculture  sector.  First,  there  remains  much  ambiguity  in  the  definition  of  roles  and ", "  3   \nresponsibilities of central, provincial, and district governments, particularly concerning marine \nand coastal management. Second, the responsibility for aquaculture development and spatial \nplanning for aquaculture activities now lies with the district governments, except when foreign \ninvestments are involved, in which case DGA\u2019s review and recommendations are required prior \nto approval by the provincial and district governments concerned. Finally, while the central \ngovernment retains the responsibility for formulating the criteria for determining and changing \nthe land use of areas designated for aquaculture, it is now the district governments that make \nthe final decision on whether or not to consider such criteria in the preparation of their spatial \nplans. The district governments now have the main responsibility for aquaculture development, \nand DGA\u2019s role has been limited to formulating sector policies, defining technical guidelines for \naquaculture development, setting directions for aquaculture research and development, and \nendorsing local government projects for external funding.  \n \n11.  The provincial and district governments, now charged with providing extension support \nto fish farmers and handling a range of technical responsibilities, lack the capacity (in terms of \nknowledge, skills, and resources) to adequately perform these tasks. They need to receive \ncapacity-building  and  logistical  support  to  develop  general  policies  and  regulations  for \nsustainable aquaculture development, develop and deliver extension services to fish farmers, \nimprove  marketing  facilities  and  information  for  small-scale  fish  farmers,  and  create  an \ninvestment environment conducive to private sector investment in aquaculture. \n \n12.  A detailed analysis of the sector is given in Appendix 2. \n \n2.  External Assistance to Aquaculture Development  \n13.  Many agencies and organizations have provided technical and financial assistance for \naquaculture development in Indonesia in the last 20 years. These include ADB, FAO, Australian \nCenter for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), Network of Aquaculture Centers in Asia \n(NACA),  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  Japan  International  Corporation \nAgency (JICA), and the World Bank. \n \n14.  ADB has been the lead agency in providing much-needed support for fisheries and \naquaculture development. Since 1972, when it approved its first fisheries loan to the Indonesian \nGovernment, ADB has provided more than $648 million in loans and technical assistance grants \nto the fisheries sector (Appendix 3). Since 1982, ADB has financed eight projects that support \naquaculture development in Indonesia. Four projects,3 each implemented before 1997, focused \nmainly on the development of brackishwater shrimp culture, mainly for export.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1982.

From the implementation of previous aquaculture development projects, as well as the \nexperiences of other aquaculture projects in Asia, a number of important lessons could be \nextracted for consideration in the design, planning, and implementation of aquaculture projects. \nThese include the following : (i) the poorest people generally may be excluded from engaging \ndirectly  as  operators  in  aquaculture  production,  but  they  may  gain  other  benefits  from \nassociated employment opportunities (in, for example, the marketing chain of farm inputs and \noutputs) and increased availability of affordable fish in their diets; (ii) fish farming cannot be \nfeasibly pioneered and left to sustain its own existence in isolated areas where essential support \nservices and markets are absent; (iii) as small fish farmers are generally ineligible for credit from \nformal sources, informal credit schemes from non-bank sources can provide small farmers with \nthe necessary financial capital for their aquaculture operations; (iv) access to reliable fish-seed \nsupply is critical to fish farming; strategic linkages between fish-breeding centers and private \nhatcheries and nurseries can enable fish farmers in major production areas to gain access to \nreliable fish seed; (v) with the decentralization of extension services to the local government and \nthe resulting deterioration in the quality of fisheries extension, innovative means of bridging the \ntechnology-transfer  gap  have  to  be  devised,  including  private  extension  services,  social \nnetworks,  and  farmer-to-farmer  contacts;  (vi)  appropriate  policies,  legal  instruments,  and \nregulations  can  act  as  enabling  agents  to  remove  identified  constraints  to  aquaculture \ndevelopment; and (vii) the development of aquaculture cannot be sustained without paying \nadequate  attention  to  aquatic  resources  management,  environment,  and  aquatic  health. \nLessons learned are detailed in Appendix 4. \n \n4.  Government Policy and Strategy for Aquaculture Development \n16.  MMAF\u2019s  Rencana  Strategis  (2005\u20132008)  provides  for  the  sustainable  utilization  and \nmanagement  of  the  country\u2019s  marine  and  fisheries  resources  and  the  improvement  of  the \nsocioeconomic condition of coastal and inland communities. In the aquaculture subsector, the \ngoal  is  development  of  competitive,  fair,  economically  viable,  and  sustainable  aquaculture \nenterprises.  More  specifically,  aquaculture  development  will  be  geared  toward  responsible, \nenvironment-friendly, and technology-based aquaculture, resulting in increased fish supply for \ndomestic consumption, industrial use, and export, as well as improved welfare of fish farmers.  \n \n17.  The Government proposes to support aquaculture development through various means, \nin  particular  (i)  increasing  production  and/or  yield  through  intensification,  diversification,  or \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1997.

Considerable resources are required to implement the broad range of \ninterventions covering physical investments and capacity building. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategies \n18.  ADB\u2019s country operational strategy for Indonesia5 has two strategic priorities: pro-poor, \nsustainable economic growth; and social development. ADB will help the Government raise \nlevels of economic growth and social development by catalyzing public and private sector \ninvestments, equitable fiscal decentralization, policy and institutional reforms, natural resources \nmanagement, and capacity development. In the agriculture and natural resources sector, the \nstrategic  thrust  in  the  short-  to  medium-term  will  focus  on  growth  in  rural  economy  and \nmanagement of natural resources in sustainable manner, with the specific aim to include the \npoor and disadvantaged section of the community as the target beneficiary, whenever possible.    \n \n19.  The  proposed  project  is  a  part  of  fishery  subsector  of  the  agriculture  and  natural \nresources sector. According to the priority classification of sectors/subsectors under ADB\u2019s \nMedium-Term Strategy II, the fishery belongs to Group III subsectors future ADB operations in \nwhich will be based on specific demand for assistance. In the world\u2019s largest archipelagic nation \nlike Indonesia, the fishery subsector has an important role in the overall economy and the well \nbeing of the 5 million fisherfolk and fish farmers. Fish is a staple in the Indonesian diet, providing \ntwo-thirds  of  the  total  animal  protein  intake.  However,  a  combination  of  complex  factors \nincluding  the  open  access  to  seas,  over  fishing  and  destructive  fishing,  and  weak  law \nenforcement have seriously affected coastal fish stock and threatened Indonesia\u2019s rich marine \nbiodiversity. The declining fish stock has reduced the fisherfolk\u2019s income levels, and the coastal \nfishing communities are among the poorest segments of society in the country.  \n \n 20.  Aquaculture has been established as a viable alternative livelihood for fisherfolk which \ncould reduce pressure on marine and coastal resources, help conserve marine biodiversity, and \nmake substantial improvements in fisherfolk\u2019s income levels. With proven technologies that \nhave been adapted locally and 25 million hectare suitable area available for it, aquaculture has \nimmense potentials for contributing to the growth of rural economy, enhancing food security and \nreducing poverty. The proposed project forms part of the Government program for harnessing \nthe aquaculture development potentials in the country and has been included in the Indonesia \nCountry Strategy and Program 2006-2009.  The Project will be complementary to the ongoing \nADB-funded Marine and Coastal Resource Management Project6 and Coral Reef Rehabilitation \n                                                 \n5  ADB.2006.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n21.  The expected impacts of the Project are reduced poverty and increased food security \nthrough  sustainable  aquaculture  development.  The  expected  outcomes  are  increased \nproduction of fish and other aquatic products, and improved income, nutrition, and employment \nstatus of poor fish farmers and coastal communities. \n \n22.  The Project will be implemented in five districts of four provinces, namely: (i) Langkat in \nNorth  Sumatera  Province;  (ii)  Ogan  Komering  Ilir  (OKI)  in  South  Sumatera  Province;  (iii) \nKarawang  and  Sumedang  in  West  Java  Province;  and  (iv)  Buton  in  Southeast  Sulawesi \nProvince. The districts meet the following selection criteria: (i) they have good potential for \nfurther  resource  development  and  are  in  need  of  improved  aquaculture  systems  to  raise \nproductivity and protect the environment; (ii) they exhibit high poverty incidence among the \nagricultural  population;8 (iii)  the  district  government  is  committed  to  improving  aquaculture \nproduction and socioeconomic conditions for fish farmers; and (iv) the limited financial capacity \nof the district government constrains further investment in aquaculture. Within each district, \nspecific villages and fish farmers to participate in the project will be identified during project \nimplementation. The criteria for selection of subproject sites and beneficiaries are outlined in \nAppendix 5. \n \nB.  Outputs \n23.  The  Project  will  comprise  three  components,  namely:  (i)  aquaculture  production \nenhancement, (ii) aquaculture support services, and (iii) institutional strengthening and project \nmanagement. \n \n  1.  Aquaculture Production Enhancement \n \n24.  This core component of the Project will aim at improving the production performance of \nthe  major  types  of  aquaculture  systems  in  the  project  area  through  community-based \nmanagement.  Market-driven,  sustainable  aquaculture  development  will  be  made  possible \nthrough (i) social preparation and community empowerment; (ii) fish production enhancement in \nfreshwater, brackishwater, and mariculture systems; and (iii) community-based management of \nculture-based fisheries. \n   \n25.  Social  Preparation  and  Community  Empowerment.  A  social  preparation  will  be \nundertaken to facilitate the formation of fish farmers organizations and the training of their \nmembers  in  the  establishment  and  management  of  aquaculture-based  or  related \nmicroenterprises.  To  be  undertaken  with  the  assistance  of  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  activities  will  involve  conducting \nparticipatory needs assessments in order to identify key problems of the communities and \ndetermine  potential  solutions.  Needs  assessments  will  be  done  though  poverty  mapping, \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2002.

", "  7   \nperception analysis, gender analysis, and assessment of the organization and structure of the \nvarious groups. Training will also include modules on nutrition, child care, and family financial \nmanagement.  To  enhance  the  poverty-reduction  objective  of  the  Project,  disadvantaged \ncommunities  will  be  provided  with  some  basic  social  infrastructure  (e.g.,  community  water \nsupply facilities and village pathways). These social infrastructure facilities will complement \naquaculture development and income-generating interventions.  \n \n26.  Fish Production Enhancement. The Project will improve the production performance of \nthe  major  aquaculture  systems  in  the  project  area  by  rehabilitating  key  public  aquaculture \nsystem facilities and access roads to these facilities. Organized fish farmers will be actively \ninvolved in rehabilitation works through the provision of in-kind labor. Sustainable aquaculture \nproduction will be carried out by fish farmers organizations in freshwater, brackishwater, and \nmarine environments using various fish, shrimp, mollusc, and seaweed species, and will cover \nthe entire range of activities from broodstock development to fry/fingerling rearing and growout. \nProposed production-oriented activities under the Project are given in Appendix 6. Low-input \nfish-farming practices, which are an improvement over the traditional tambak (fish pond) culture, \nwill be employed to ensure broad-based acceptance, success, and sustainability.  \n \n27.  To promote the adoption of suitable, environment-friendly, community-based/managed \naquaculture practices by fish farmers, the Project will establish demonstration facilities and/or \nmodel enterprises that may be replicated at other sites within the project area. District fisheries \nservices will invite well performing privately owned fish firms to provide experts to prepare \nmodels of demonstration facilities and supervise fish farmers organizations in managing and \noperating these facilities. The form and procedural details of private sector participation in the \nProject will be developed in the first year of the Project.  \n \n28.  To  support  the  seed  requirements  of  the  fish  farmers,  the  Project  will  develop  or \nrehabilitate small community-based fish/shrimp hatcheries and nurseries. The communities will \nbe consulted in the identification of sites for hatcheries. Materials for land- or water-based \nhatcheries will be procured with project funds, but construction will be carried out with labor \ncontributed by the fish farmers organizations. The district governments will support operation of \nthese hatcheries over a period of three years, after which the fish farmers organizations will own \nand operate them. District government hatcheries will also be improved and upgraded, as \nneeded, and focus on broodstock to assure the availability of quality breeders for use in private \nhatcheries and fish farms. \n \n29.  Community-Based Management of Culture-Based Fisheries. Aquaculture involves \nraising certain aquatic species almost exclusively in controlled environments. By contrast, in \nculture-based  fisheries  aquatic  species  spend  only  limited  time  in  controlled  environments \nbefore they or their seed/fry are released into open freshwater, brackishwater, or marine water \nand allowed to propagate or grow on natural foods until they reach harvestable size. Culture-\nbased fisheries can enhance fishery resources, replenish natural stocks whose populations have \ndeclined  through  overexploitation  or  environmental  degradation,  or  simply  maximize  the \nproductivity  of  a  water  body.  The  Project  will  support  community-managed  culture-based \nfisheries  programs  in  sites  where  extensive  open-water  areas  are  available  for  stock \nenhancement of certain species. \n \n  2.  Aquaculture Support Services \n \n30.  This  component  will  upgrade  the  production  techniques  and  quality  of  aquaculture \nproducts  through  strengthened  extension  services  and  improved  post-harvest  handling, \n ", "8     \nprocessing, and marketing techniques in collaboration with the private sector and fish farmers \norganizations.  Activities  will  include:  (i)  provision  of  fisheries  extension  services  to  project \nbeneficiaries, including the establishment of site-specific demonstration and input assistance \nmodules; (ii) upgrading or improvement of facilities and techniques for post-harvest handling, \nprocessing, and marketing of aquaculture products; (iii) expansion of markets for aquaculture \ncommodities and promoting the consumption of identified species; (iv) improving environmental \nand  fish  health  management;  and  (v)  applied  research  on  improved  species  and  culture \ntechnologies.  The  Project  will  not  include  a  credit  component  in  support  of  aquaculture \nproduction but, instead, facilitate fish farmers organizations access to credit by improving their \ncreditworthiness. A listing of available schemes which can be tapped by the project beneficiaries \nis given in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n31.  Extension Services. Extension services provided to participating fish farmers and the \nprivate sector will include the establishment of site-specific demonstration facilities and the \nintroduction of new aquaculture and processing technologies. Poor fish farmers will be provided \nwith  production  inputs  assistance  to  support  their  aquaculture  production  and  processing \nactivities. Given that the decentralization process weakened extension services, community \nextension  workers  (CEWs)  will  be  recruited  by  the  district  governments  to  strengthen  the \ndistricts' fisheries extension services. The CEWs will also provide grassroots-level training to fish \nfarmers  on  the  establishment  and  management  of  sustainable  aquaculture  enterprises. \nTechnical  personnel  employed  by  the  private  sector  partners  of  participating  district \ngovernments will also be tapped to render extension services to organized fish farmers, as \nrequired.   \n \n32.  Processing  and  Post-Harvest  Handling.  The Project will support establishment of \nsmall-scale facilities for production of low cost fish feeds using locally available raw materials; \nfish and seaweed drying, grading and packaging; and processing of fish byproducts. All these \nfacilities will be established as demonstration units and managed by fish farmers organizations. \nThis will ensure that fish farmers maximize returns from their production activities and reduce \nlosses stemming from poor or deteriorating fish quality. Facilities and sites will be determined \nbased on specific criteria and guidelines developed jointly by DGA, district fisheries services and \ncommunities  during  project  implementation.  Training  will  be  provided  to  fish  farmers  on \noperations and maintenance of the facilities. \n \n33.  Fish  Marketing  Development.  Organized  fish  farmers,  as  well  as  private  sector \nindividuals or entities, will be provided institutional and technical assistance in the marketing of \ntheir products. Specific marketing needs will be identified and appropriate market development \nor marketing strategies will be formulated for various aquaculture commodities. Fish marketing \nand distribution networks will be established with the cooperation of medium- to large-scale \naquaculture businesses. Fish collection points will be established close to major production \nareas. A market information system will be designed and installed in district government offices \nand linked to DGA to enable fish farmers and private enterprises to gain access to real-time \ndata on market prices, supply and demand, and other market-related information for various \naquaculture products. To increase the consumption of freshwater fish, a multimedia marketing \ncampaign will be launched in the project provinces. Regular trade fairs will also be organized to \nfacilitate linkages between fish traders, exporters, and producers of high-value fish species. \n \n34.  Environmental  and  Fish  Health  Management.  To  minimize  the  risk  of  disease \noutbreaks and mitigate against possible adverse impacts of aquaculture activities, the Project \nwill adopt the following measures: (i) use of extensive monoculture or polyculture systems, or \nrotation of milkfish and shrimp cropping in the same ponds; (ii) use of disease-resistant shrimp ", "  9   \nspecies in shrimp monoculture, and limiting their use to low-density culture; (iii) introduction of \nenvironment-friendly  practices  and  aquaculture  systems,  such  as  silvo-fisheries 9 ;  (iv) \nestablishment of water quality laboratories and fish health laboratories close to major production \nareas in the participating districts; (v) monitoring of the quality of fish fingerlings or prawn/shrimp \npostlarvae used to stock the ponds, which will prevent the possible introduction of disease-\ncausing organisms into the culture environment; (vi) strict monitoring of water quality in ponds, \nsupply canals, and drain canals in order to detect early warning signs of impending fishkills or \nfish/shrimp disease occurrence; (vii) training of district fisheries personnel, CEWs, fish farmers, \nand  private  investors  on  proper  pond  and  culture  system  management  and  fish  disease \nprevention and control; and (viii) requiring medium- to large-scale private enterprises involved in \nintensive fish and shrimp culture systems to incorporate settling or sedimentation tanks in the \ndesign of their aquaculture systems in order to mitigate against possible adverse effects on \ndownstream water quality. \n \n35.  Applied Research. Continued applied research to support aquaculture development will \nbe conducted by the DGA\u2019s technical implementing units and aquaculture centers, MMAF\u2019s \nAgency  for  Marine  and  Fisheries  Research,  and  collaborating  academic  and  research \ninstitutions. Research activities to be supported by the Project will be designed by DGA during \nproject implementation and could include (i) adaptive research and field verification trials on \nimproved culture techniques for various species; (ii) addressing site specific technical problems \nand  issues;  and  (iii)  exploratory  research  on  other  species  with  commercial  potential.  The \noutcome of the research activities will be disseminated for future replication by fish farmers and \nthe  private  sector.  Research-extension  linkages  will  be  established  between  provincial  and \ndistrict fisheries services in order to facilitate the commercial application of research results by \nfish farmers. \n \n  3.  Institutional Strengthening and Project Management \n \n36.  This component aims to enhance the institutional capability of DGA, the district fisheries \nservices, fish farmers, and the private sector in aquaculture development.  \n \n37.  Institutional  Strengthening.  The  Project  will  include  the  following  activities:  (i) \ninstitutional  assessment  of  relevant  institutions  and  entities  to  determine  priority  areas  of \nstrengthening;  (ii)  development  and  launching  of  a  human  resource  development  training \nprogram  for DGA, the provincial and district fisheries services (particularly extension personnel), \nCEWs, and community organizations and associations (including those involving women and \ndisadvantaged groups);10 (iii) development and installation of an aquaculture information system \nin DGA, with links to the project districts; this will enable the timely collection and provision of \naccurate data on aquaculture production and provide analysis for planning, management, and \nregulation  purposes;  and  (iv)  support  DGA  in  drafting  the  necessary  legal  documents  and \nregulations, and in conducting policy dialogues with provincial and district governments on \nsustainable aquaculture development and environmental management.   \n \n38.  Project Management. In order to ensure timely and effective implementation of project \nactivities and efficient use of funds and other project resources, this component will support (i) \noperation of a project management office (PMO) in DGA and project implementation units (PIUs) \n                                                 \n9  Fishculture in coastal mangrove. \n10 As aquaculture is a largely private sector endeavor, the Project\u2019s capacity-building interventions will include the \nprivate sector in the participating districts. Private companies, especially those that will be involved as partners of \nthe district government in the operation of demonstration facilities and enterprises, will be invited to participate in \nthe various training programs.  \n ", "10    \nin the five project districts; (ii) engagement of international and national consultants to assist the \nPMO and PIUs in project management; (iii) procurement of vehicles and other equipment, \nsupplies,  and  materials  for  the  Project;  and  (iv)  establishment  of  accounting,  monitoring, \nreporting, and evaluation systems. \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Poverty Targeting \n39.  The target beneficiaries of the Project are poor fish farmers. Project locations were \nselected to represent a range of agro-ecological systems where poor farmers live, from inland \nfish  farms  to  brackish  and  marine  aquatic  areas  of  varying  population,  environmental \ncharacteristics and market access. High poverty incidence among the rural population is one of \nthe main criteria for selection of subproject sites. Project areas have few alternative sources of \nlivelihood outside of aquaculture, which underlines the importance of developing sustainable \neconomic  activities  for  poor  fish  farmers.  The  Project  is  aimed  at  enhancing  incomes  by \naddressing  infrastructure,  technological,  environmental,  and  market-access  constraints  for \naquaculture development. These constraints, which are often interrelated, have caused small \naquaculture enterprises to be abandoned in rural areas throughout Indonesia. This Project could \nthus serve as a model for addressing the needs of poor fish-farming communities throughout \nthe  archipelago.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  improve  food  security  of  poor  consumers  by \nstabilizing the supply of affordable fish products. \n \n2.  Community Participation \n40.  The Project calls for significant community financial contributions (6.2% of the total \nproject costs, and more than 15% of costs related to aquaculture development activities). Most \nof  the  aquaculture  and  culture-based  fisheries  activities  will  be  directly  implemented  by \ncommunities. Such a strong community contribution and commitment should ensure the quality \nand sustainability of project interventions. To further enhance community participation and the \nsustainability  of  project  interventions,  the  Project  provides  comprehensive  technical  and \nextension support for fish farmer beneficiaries, and includes innovative mechanisms to assist \norganized fish farmer groups with their production inputs and market requirements. \n \n3.  Public\u2013Private Sector Partnership \n41.  The Project aims to create an enabling environment for private sector investment by \nremoving technical and infrastructure impediments to aquaculture development in project areas. \nIt  also  promotes  public-private  sector  partnerships  in  the  implementation  of  aquaculture \ndevelopment  activities,  including  provision  of  experts  to  prepare  models  of  demonstration \nfacilities and supervision of fish farms developed by the Project. Private sector participation will \naugment and benefit the operations of small-scale fish farmers and facilitate small-scale fish \nfarmers\u2019 access to markets. \n \n4.  Capacity Building at Local Levels \n42.  The Project will be coordinated nationally but will be implemented under decentralized \nmanagement. Through its institutional strengthening activities, the Project will assist district \ngovernments in building their technical capacity to support the needs of the beneficiaries and \ntheir communities while also supporting the country\u2019s aquaculture industry as a whole. \n ", "  11   \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n46.  DGA of MMAF will be the Executing Agency of the Project and will be responsible for \noverall project management. A PMO will be set up within DGA. It will be staffed by a dedicated \nproject director and a project manager, and required technical, administrative, and financial \nstaff. The PMO will oversee the day-to-day project implementation including (i) coordination of \nspecific  project  activities;  (ii)  preparation  of  various  project  reports  to  be  submitted  to  the \nNational Steering Committee (NSC) and ADB; (iii) close monitoring of project implementation; \n(iv) central level procurement of specific goods and services; (v) selection and engagement of \nconsultants;  and  (vi)  design  and  undertaking  of  baseline,  midterm  and  project  completion \nsurveys. A PIU will be set up in each project district to implement district-level project activities, \nincluding procurement of materials, equipment and services, and to coordinate with district \ngovernment  agencies  involved  in  areas  such  as  forestry,  environment,  agriculture,  rural \ndevelopment, home affairs, and cooperatives. Each PIU will comprise a dedicated PIU head \nwith experience and expertise acceptable to ADB, and the required technical, administrative, \nand  financial  staff.  A  consultant  team  comprising  international  and  national  specialists  will \nprovide  technical  assistance  to  the  Project  at  the  national  and  district  levels.  The  project \norganization chart is shown in Appendix 8. \n \n47.  DGA, with the support of relevant MMAF directorates general and academic institutions, \nwill  also  be  responsible  for  the  following  activities:  (i)  establishment  and  operation  of  an \naquaculture management information system, (ii) development of aquaculture technical and \nenvironmental guidelines, (iii) launching human resources development training programs, (iv) \naquaculture research, and (v) technology and information dissemination. \n  \n48.  District  governments  will  be  responsible  for  cross-sector  coordination  and \nimplementation of the Project\u2019s field activities, including the provision of support toward (i) \ndesign and rehabilitation of sustainable aquaculture farming systems and post-harvest facilities; \n(ii)  launching  programs  in  hatchery  production,  culture-based  fisheries,  and  lake  and  river \nmanagement; (iii) aquaculture technology demonstration and extension; and (iv) small-scale \ninfrastructure development in support of local aquaculture. ", "  13   \n \n49.  The private sector and NGOs/CBOs will be involved in supporting the following project \nactivities: (i) community organization, (ii) aquaculture systems demonstrations, (iii) project inputs \nassistance  and  market  support  to  small-scale  fish  farmers,  and  (iv)  credit  and  financial \nassistance. Participating communities will be empowered to carry out sustainable aquaculture, \nresource-management, and livelihood activities at identified sites. \n \n50.  The NSC will provide guidance on the overall direction of the Project and inter-agency \ncoordination to ensure that project activities are in line with government policy on aquaculture \ndevelopment. The NSC will be chaired by the Director General of Aquaculture and comprise \nsenior  officials  of  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  MOF,  and  a \nsecretary. Participating district governments will be invited to attend NSC meetings on issues \nrequiring  their  participation.  The  NSC  will  be  assisted  by  a  national  technical  committee \ncomprising technical staff of the NSC member agencies and the Ministry of Home Affairs, and \nheaded by NSC secretary. At the district level, a regional advisory committee (RAC) will be \nestablished in each project district to oversee project coordination between the various agencies \nat  the  local  level  and  liaise  with  the  NSC  as  required.  The  RAC  will  be  composed  of \nrepresentatives of the participating district governments and other agencies and institutions \nconcerned at the regional level. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n51.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  6-year  period  (2007\u20132013).  The  Project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n52.  The PMO and PIUs11 will be responsible for the procurement of all goods, services and \nworks under their respective areas of supervision.12 Goods and services financed partly or \nwholly by ADB will be procured in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Contract \npackages  for  goods  exceeding  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB).  Each  contract  costing  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  will  be \nawarded through national competitive bidding (NCB). Minor equipment and materials costing \nless than $100,000 will be procured through shopping. Civil works contract packages exceeding \n$1,000,000 will be awarded on the basis of ICB. Contract packages between $100,000 and \n$500,000 will be awarded on the basis of NCB. Small scale civil works contracts with an \naverage value of $10,000\u2013$25,000 equivalent will follow procurement procedures for community \nparticipation in procurement as contained in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. A procurement \nplan is given in Appendix 10. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n53.  The Project will require consulting services for a total of 672 person-months, comprising \n56 international and 616 national person-months. The consultants will be recruited through a \nfirm and will be selected following the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The outline terms of reference \n(TOR) of consultants are in Appendix 11; the detailed TORs are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n                                                 \n11 Each PIU will be assisted by a site advisor, a national consultant with experience in, among others, procurement. \n12 Independent observers may be invited to sit in project procurement committees to strengthen governance at the \ncentral and regional levels. \n ", "14    \n \n54.  In addition, the Project will employ NGOs to assist local communities in carrying out \naquaculture  and  related  activities,  and  in  accessing  existing  local  microfinance  schemes. \nAquaculture  research,  special  studies  and  surveys,  training,  social  preparation,  community \nempowerment, and database development will be contracted to qualified local academic or \nresearch  institutions  and  consulting  firms.  NGOs/CBOs  and  academic  institutions  will  be \nselected following the least-cost selection and/or single source selection procedures of the \nGuidelines. \n \n5.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  To monitor and evaluate the operational performance of the agencies and institutions \ninvolved  and  the  benefits  obtained  from  the  Project,  DGA,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  will \nestablish a Project Performance Management System (PPMS) in the PMO within one year of \nloan effectiveness. The PPMS will (i) monitor (both physically and financially) key activities, \nincluding  consultant  recruitment,  equipment  and  materials  procurement,  training,  surveys, \nspecial studies, policy development, and the drafting of implementation guidelines; (ii) monitor \nand  rate  the  performance  of  various  stakeholders,  including  local  communities,  in  project \nactivities; (iii) monitor the Project\u2019s social, environmental, and economic impacts, and establish \nbenchmarks;  and  (iv)  introduce  mechanisms  for  adjusting  project  design  and  project \nimplementation arrangements, and for incorporating lessons learned from similar projects into \nproject planning. \n \n56.  Consultants will support the PMO in designing a baseline survey and midterm and \nproject completion surveys that will help evaluate the financial, economic, and social impacts of \nthe  Project.  At  the community  level,  participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  will  be \nintroduced as part of the Project\u2019s comprehensive participatory development approach.  Special \nstudies may be conducted to investigate issues related to project implementation and impact. \nFor  periodic  monitoring,  key  indicators  will  be  developed  and  incorporated  in  the  regular \nreporting system. PMO staff will make regular field visits to monitor progress. Project M&E \nreports will be submitted by the PMO to ADB on a quarterly basis. Upon project completion, \nproject impact will be evaluated in accordance with a schedule and TOR to be mutually agreed \nupon by the Government and ADB. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n57.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  Bank  Indonesia  in  the  name  of  the \nExecuting Agency. The advance to the imprest account will be limited to 10% of the loan \namount or 6 months projected expenditure, whichever is less. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure \nprocedure will be followed to liquidate funds advanced to the imprest account and will apply to \ncontracts not exceeding $100,000. The flow of funds is shown in Supplementary Appendix C. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n58.  PMO, PIUs, and other agencies involved in project implementation will prepare and \nmaintain separate accounts exclusively for the Project and will register in such accounts all \nreceipts and payments for the Project in accordance with sound accounting principles and \nprocedures. The project accounts will be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable \nto ADB. An audit opinion of the project accounts will reflect  (i) an assessment of the adequacy \nof  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures  and  other ", "  15   \nfinancial  transactions,  in  order  to  ensure  safe  custody  of  project-financed  assets;  (ii)  a \ndetermination as to whether the borrower and project implementing entities have maintained \nadequate documentation of all relevant transactions, including specific mention of SOE and \nspecial account transactions; (iii) a confirmation that expenditures submitted to ADB are eligible \nfor financing, and identification of any ineligible expenditures; and (iv) a confirmation that loan \ncovenants and ADB requirements for project management have been complied with. The audit \nopinion needs to be submitted to ADB within six months of the end of the financial year along \nwith audited financial statements including opinion on imprest accounts and SOE. \n \n59.  The Government and the EA were informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited \naccounts, which covers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements within the \ndue time. A formal warning will be issued for accounts more than six months overdue, and \ndisbursements will be suspended for accounts more than 12 months overdue. \n \n60.  Reporting systems will be set up at the national and local levels to enable DGA, through \nPMO, to effectively supervise the implementation of all Project activities and provide timely \nadvice and support to the PIUs. PMO will be responsible for (i) collecting and consolidating all \nproject progress reports, site reports, technical reports, and financial reports; and (ii) preparing \nand submitting to ADB quarterly progress reports, the midterm project evaluation report, and the \noverall project completion report. The PIUs will be responsible for (i) preparing project progress, \ntechnical,  and  financial  reports  covering  site-specific  activities;  and  (ii)  collecting  and \nconsolidating field data and feedback from local participating agencies and contractors that will, \nin turn, be relayed to PMO. Reports will be prepared in a format acceptable to ADB13 and will be \nposted on a project Web site that will be set up under the MMAF Web site. The PMO will be \nstaffed with experienced officials with adequate financial management skills and systems. To \nstrengthen accountability, the PMO will be responsible for reconciling the PIUs\u2019 financial reports \nand the Project's overall financial accounts, and for posting the consolidated financial report on \nthe project Web site for stakeholder examination. At the same time, to maximize transparency at \nthe  local  level,  each  PIU  will  provide  copies  of  its  financial  reports  to  the  fish  farmers\u2019 \nassociations  and  the  NGOs  responsible  for  the  project  social  preparation  and  community \nempowerment.  These  financial  reports  will  contain  information  on  the  allocated  budget, \ncommitments, and disbursements.  \n \n8.  Midterm Review  \n61.  At the beginning of the fourth year of implementation, a comprehensive midterm review \nof the Project will be carried out to identify any problems and constraints encountered and \nassess  the  need  for  mid-course  modification  of  the  project  scope  and  implementation \narrangements. Technical and budgetary changes to the project document, arising from PPMS \nfindings, will also be considered.  \n \n9.  Anticorruption Policy \n62.  The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and Policy relating to the \nCombating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternal best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering \n                                                 \n13 The Project will use the template for quarterly reports, which is now being developed by IRM for use by all ADB \nprojects in Indonesia. \n ", "16    \nactivities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such \nactivities. The investment documentation between ADB and the Government will further allow \nADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n63.  The project design and implementation arrangements provide for mitigating corruption \nrisks. The participatory management of the project with the implementation responsibility shared \nby DGA and districts governments and the involvement of NGOs and CBOs in field level \nactivities will improve transparency and accountability in the decision making process. The cost-\nsharing arrangement will motivate district governments and beneficiaries to strive for economy \nand efficiency in project implementation and avoid corrupt practices. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n64.  The  Project\u2019s  major  quantifiable  economic  benefit  will  be  increased  aquaculture \nproduction and productivity. By improving access infrastructure, promoting competitive fish and \nshrimp hatcheries and nurseries, providing post-harvest and processing facilities, and providing \nmarketing support, the Project will significantly reduce transaction costs and increase farmgate \nprices of aquaculture products. The introduction of new culture techniques or new aquaculture \ncommodities through pilot demonstrations, based on applied research results, will improve \naquaculture yields. Financial analysis for five representative activities (grouper cage culture, \nmud-crab fattening, seaweed production, carp ponds culture, and tiger shrimp cultivation) at the \nfarm level was undertaken to determine the financial viability of aquaculture in the post-project \nscenario. All of the representative aquaculture activities exhibit financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) values significantly above the prevailing financial cost of capital of 22%, and they were \nnot  sensitive  to  major  risks  (Appendix  12  and  details  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D).  To \ndetermine the economic viability of the Project, economic internal rate of return (EIRR) values \nwere  estimated  for  representative  aquaculture  activities.  The  anticipated  EIRR  values  for \nindividual schemes ranged from 15% to 21%. \n \n65.  The strengthening of extension services will enhance the sustainability of aquaculture \nenterprises by improving the provision of continuous technical support and training to fish \nfarmers.  The  establishment  of  research\u2013extension  linkages  between  provincial  and  district \nfisheries services will facilitate the commercial application of research results by fish farmers, \nwhich in turn will lead to improvements in aquaculture productivity in project sites. Aquaculture \ntraining and demonstrations for fish farmers will not only lead to establishment of small-scale \nenterprises, but will also provide technically educated labor for medium-scale enterprises. The \nimprovement in financial returns for aquaculture as a result of project activities should lead to \nmore  private  sector  participation.  In  addition,  the  Project  is  expected  to  result  in  (i) \nenvironmental benefits arising from improved aquaculture resources management at the district \nand  village  levels;  (ii)  improved  nutrition  and  health  of  rural  populations  stemming  from \nexpanded food supplies and increased consumption of animal protein; (iii) enhanced inter-\nagency and public\u2013private sector linkages through strengthened partnerships in aquaculture \ndevelopment;  and  (iv)  empowerment  of  small  fish  farmers  and  rural  communities  with \nknowledge  and  skills  in  community-based  aquaculture  and  culture-based  fisheries \nmanagement. \n ", "  17   \nB.  Social Measures and Impact on Poverty \n66.  The Project will reduce poverty by boosting incomes, employment, and food security. \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  conducted  during  project  preparation  showed  that  poverty \nincidence14 among aquaculture households in the project districts ranges from 26% to 48%. The \ntotal population at risk15 is estimated at 203,664, or 60% of the aquaculture population in the \nproject districts. The Project is expected to help 14,000 poor households to increase their \nincomes to levels above the poverty line. Not only will the Project engage about 18,000 person-\nyears of labor in aquaculture, but it will also create many jobs in the aquaculture industry\u2019s \nsupply chain (transportation of goods, processing of byproducts such as fish fry and terasi, fish \ntrading, etc.). A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is given in Appendix 13.  \n \n67.  The  Project  will  require  minimal  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  will  not \ninvolve significant involuntary resettlement as described in the ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement. The subproject selection criteria (Appendix 5) ensure that only subprojects with \nminimal land acquisition will be approved. Details of land acquisition will be known only after the \nsubprojects are identified at detailed design level. The Project has established a compensation \npolicy framework and procedural guidelines (Supplementary Appendix F) to be followed in the \npreparation of the needed resettlement plans. Buton district has large populations of indigenous \npeoples  and  it  is likely  that  some  of  them  will  be  affected  once  the  subprojects  are  fully \nidentified. To guide the preparation of needed indigenous peoples development plans, DGA has \nprepared an indigenous peoples development framework reflecting the requirements of ADB\u2019s \npolicy on indigenous peoples (Supplementary Appendix G).    \n \n68.  The project scope will meet women\u2019s needs and improve their socioeconomic status \ngetting  them  more  involved  in  aquaculture,  culture-based  fisheries,  and  related  activities, \nincluding fish processing, trading, and community-based monitoring. Several gender-responsive \nactivities dealing with women\u2019s reproductive, productive, and community management roles \nhave been incorporated into the project design. The Project will support poor women in gaining \naccess to resources, technical assistance, and capacity-building efforts for poverty reduction \nand food security. Women will be included in all project activities, including those dealing with \nproduction  inputs  assistance  and  training.  To  ensure  that  the  Project  addresses  gender \nconcerns women will be hired to conduct gender training to sensitize local government officials \nand  personnel  to  women\u2019s  needs.  Baseline  PPMS  surveys  and  the  midterm  and  project \ncompletion surveys will collect gender-disaggregated data. Gender indicators will be included in \nthe PPMS and will become an important element in the evaluation system for the PMO and \nNGOs. Specific targets for women participation in project activities are given in Appendix 13, \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Section D.  \n \nC.  Environment \n69.  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  conducted  during  project  preparation \nshowed that none of the interventions are projected to have significant or adverse impacts on \nthe environment. A few minor environmental impacts are likely as a result of factors related to \nsite selection, construction, and operation, but these are small and avoidable and could be \nminimized  through  careful  planning  and  the  adoption  of  proper  construction  practices. \nAppropriate environmental safeguards have been built into project design to mitigate against \nthese likely negative effects. A summary IEE is given in Appendix 14.  \n                                                 \n14 The poverty incidence rate for the districts was based on the Rp3.2 million poverty threshold. \n15  Defined as those under the poverty threshold plus those just above the poverty line. \n ", "18    \n \nD.  Risks and Countermeasures \n70.  The risks that could affect project implementation and constrain the attainment of project \nobjectives are: (i) institutional inadequacies of DGA and the district governments; (ii) lack of \ncooperation and coordination between DGA and the district governments, and between the \ndistrict  fisheries  service  and  other  local  government  agencies;  (iii)  lack  of  Government \ncounterpart funds, (iv) lack of interest of the private sector to participate in the Project; (v) \nreluctance  of  poor  fish  farmers  to  adopt  new  or  improved  technologies;  (vi)  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  resulting  from  more  intensive  culture  practices;  and  (vii)  misuse  of \nproject funds and facilities. \n \n71.  The risks arising from institutional inadequacies, lack of coordination between agencies, \nand lack of counterpart funds will be minimized by the (i) the establishment of NSC and RAC \nwith functions aimed at promoting effective coordination of project implementation; (ii) provision \nof competent project management staff by DGA and the participating district governments; (iii) \nvigorous  implementation  of  the  Project\u2019s  institutional  strengthening  component,  including  a \nmassive training program for all stakeholders; (iv) adoption of a \u201clearning approach\u201d to project \nimplementation, whereby relatively new technologies are demonstrated and pilot-tested prior to \nfull-scale implementation; (v) establishment of close working relationships among NGOs/CBOs, \nextension staff, participating rural communities, and the private sector; (vi) provision of project \nmanagement  specialist  services  to  assist  and  support  PMO,  PIUs,  and  local  extension \npersonnel; and (vii) design and implementation of an effective monitoring and reporting system, \nwith a view to obtaining prompt feedback and enabling timely remedies.  \n \n72.  It is not likely that the private sector will lack interest given that the Project will provide \nvarious incentives for their participation, such as upgrades to infrastructure (e.g. access roads, \npost-harvest processing facilities, and water-quality and fish-health laboratories). The private \nsector will also have ample opportunity to access Project support and to participate in training \nprograms to upgrade their skills in aquaculture and related fields. \n \n73.  The rapid social assessment surveys performed during project preparation found that \nfish farmers are highly interested in participating in the Project and willing to adopt new or \nimproved  fish-farming  technologies  to  improve  output  and  yields.  Moreover,  the  social \npreparation and community organizing work to be carried out by contracted NGOs will build \nupon this interest and prepare fish farmers for participation in the Project. Existing practice of \nmonitoring  of  development  projects  by  civil  society  organizations  will  also  help  preventing \ncorruption at the district level. Finally, the possibility of adverse environmental impacts resulting \nfrom project interventions will be mitigated by a number of project design features including \nenvironmental management training, laboratory facilities for monitoring water quality and fish \nhealth,  adoption  of  low-density  culture,  and  selection  of  species  that  are  either  naturally \navailable or successfully cultured and adapted elsewhere in the country. \n \n74.  On  the  whole,  therefore,  the  technical  soundness  of  the  proposed  production  and \nsupport  interventions  and  the  adoption  of  participatory  approaches  and  social  preparation \nactivities in project implementation will result in the benefits exceeding the costs. \n ", "  19   \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n75.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MMAF have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The  Government  ensures,  and  will  cause  each  of  the  participating  district \ngovernments to ensure, that counterpart funds for the project implementation will \nbe  provided  on  time.

The PIUs will comprise a dedicated \nPIU Head, with experience and expertise acceptable to ADB, and the required \ntechnical, administrative and financial staff. \n(iii)  Within one year of loan effective date MMAF will establish a project performance \nmanagement system (PPMS), which will encompass (a) monitoring of physical \nand financial progress as well as economy and efficiency of key activities such as \nrecruitment  of  consultants,  procurement  of  equipment  and  materials,  training \narrangements,  conduct  of  surveys  and  special  studies,  policy  development, \ndrafting of implementation guidelines, and the like; (b) monitoring of the level and \nadequacy of participation of various stakeholders, including local communities, in \nProject  activities;  (c)  monitoring  of  the  Project\u2019s  social,  environmental,  and \neconomic impacts, including the establishment of benchmark information and \ndata; and (d) setting a mechanism for making necessary adjustments in the \nproject  design  and  implementation  arrangement  and  incorporating  lessons \nlearned from similar projects  in Project planning.  \n(iv)  At the community level, participatory monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will be \nintroduced  as  part  of  the  Project\u2019s  comprehensive  participatory  development \napproach. The M&E will be prepared in the form and substance agreed between \nthe Government and ADB and will be submitted to ADB on a quarterly basis. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that only subprojects and beneficiaries meeting the \neligibility criteria for selection set out in Appendix 5 of this document receive \nfunding under the Project. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure and will cause each of the participating district \ngovernments to ensure that prior to the award of civil works contracts, it shall \nscreen for involuntary resettlement effects to ensure that there are no losses of \nland, income, housing, community facilities and resources that would require \ncompensation  to  be  paid  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement. In the event land acquisition and resettlement is required for any \nactivities funded under the Project, such land acquisition and resettlement shall \nbe carried out in accordance with the agreed Compensation Policy Framework \nand Procedural Guidelines prepared for the Project. \n(vii)  The  Government  will  ensure,  or  will  cause  each  of  the  participating  district \ngovernments  to  ensure,  that  the  gender  action  plan,  as  described  in  the \n ", "20    \nAppendix 13 to this document, is complied with, in order to ensure (a) equal \nopportunities for men and women in all project activities, including aquaculture \ndevelopment,  processing,  marketing,  resource  management  and  livelihood \nprograms; (b) equal opportunity for women to access financial assistance; and (c) \nachievement of specific targets set out therein.  \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that one PMO staff member is designated as the \ngender focal point, with responsibility for organizing gender training, coordinating \ngender-related activities, advising on how gender concerns can be incorporated \nin project activities, and monitoring the extent to which this is done.  \n(ix)  The site selection, design, construction and operation of the aquaculture facilities \nand social infrastructure will be implemented in accordance with the relevant \ngovernment  regulations  and  standards  as  well  as  the  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nPolicy  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.  Further,  all  aquaculture \nfacilities, social infrastructure, and microenterprise activities will be subjected to \nan environmental screening prior to their establishment. \n(x)  The Government will ensure that all necessary measures will be taken under the \nProject with regard to indigenous peoples in accordance with the Indigenous \nPeoples\u2019 Development Framework and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.  \n(xi)  Project accounts, including financial statements, SOEs, and imprest account, \ntogether with disbursement documents, will be audited annually by independent \nauditors acceptable to ADB and will be submitted to ADB not later than six \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year. \nB.

Aquaculture Resources and Production Performance \n1.  Indonesia  has  8.3  million  hectares  (ha)  of  coastal  waters  suitable  for  mariculture; \n2.15 million ha of rivers, lakes, ponds, and paddy fields suitable for freshwater aquaculture; and \nabout 1,224,000 ha of brackishwater ponds. However, the actual area devoted to aquaculture is \ncurrently estimated at only 810,000 ha, representing less than 7% of the total potential area. \nNevertheless, the existing aquaculture area is almost double that devoted to aquaculture in \n1980, when there were only 316,000 ha of fishponds, 89,000 ha of rice paddies that were used \nfor fish culture, and only 2 ha of fish cages. Aquaculture and inland water capture fisheries \ncontribute 26% to the country\u2019s total fish production. Total aquaculture production increased by \nabout 10% per year between 1994 and 2005, from 597,520 metric tons (t) to 2.1 million t. \nTechnological innovations, area expansion, and availability of suitable quality and quantity of fish \nseed drove this increase. \n \n2.  Freshwater  Aquaculture.    This  was  the  earliest  form  of  aquaculture  in  Indonesia, \nstarting in the middle of the 19th century with the stocking of common carp in backyard ponds in \nWest Java, and subsequently expanding to other parts of Java, Sumatera, and Sulawesi islands \nin the early 20th century. However, it was only in the late 1970s when a remarkable increase in \nproduction  from  freshwater  aquaculture  was  observed\u2014a  result  of  the  introduction  of  new \nfarming technologies, which contributed to the availability of hatchery-produced seed, and the \ndevelopment  of  compound  fish  feeds.  The  main  freshwater  producing  regions  are  Java, \nSumatera, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku-Papua, which altogether \nproduced some 629,635 t in 2005. Common carp is the most dominant species, with production \ncomprising about half of the total freshwater aquaculture output. The production of common carp \nin ponds, cages, and paddy fields doubled from 1988 to 2001, with the bulk (64%) coming from \nJava, where it is widely preferred by the local people. Other common culture species are tilapia \n(Oreochromis  niloticus),  gouramy  (Osphronemus  gouramy),  and  on  a  limited  scale  the \nfreshwater  prawn  (Macrobrachium  rosenbergii).  The  Asian  catfish  (Pangasius  spp.),  locally \nknown as Patin Bangkok, was recently introduced into the country, and its production has been \ngrowing rapidly, especially in Sumatera. \n \n3.  Brackishwater Aquaculture. Milkfish (Chanos chanos) remains the primary species for \nbrackishwater aquaculture at present, with production reaching about 644,000 t in 2005, almost \ndouble the 140,000 t produced in 1997. In terms of value, however, penaeid shrimp is the prime \ncommodity, contributing 80% to total fisheries exports. However, because outbreaks of white \nspot virus resulted in mass mortalities in ponds, tiger shrimp production stagnated at around \n90,000 t from 1997-2001. In the previous years, shrimp production had risen dramatically from a \nlow of 77,451 t in 1988 to a high of 167,117 t in 1997. Private farmers continue to grow penaeid \nshrimp, albeit on a much reduced scale compared with the 1980s and 1990s. The production of \ntiger shrimp dropped significantly in recent years. To compensate for the drop in jumbo tiger \nshrimp production in the wake of recent disease outbreaks, white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) \nand  rostris  shrimp  (Litopenaeus  stylirostris),  which  are  sturdier  than  tiger  shrimp,  were \nintroduced by the Government and are now successfully farmed in East Java, Lampung, and \nBali, where the average yield is 10 t/ha/crop. \n \n4.  Mariculture.  The main mariculture species in Indonesia are (i) high-value finfish such as \nseabass  (Lates  calcarifer),  groupers  (Epinephelus  spp.,  Cromileptes  altivelis,  Plectropomus \nspp.), and snappers (Lutjanus argentimaculatus, L. sebae); (ii) mollusks, including  oysters such \nas  the  gold-lipped  pearl  oyster  (Pinctada  maxima),  the  black-lipped  pearl  oyster  (Pinctada ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nmargaritifera), and the wing oyster (Pteria penguin); clams, turban snails (Trochus miloticus), \nabalone (Haliotis assinina), cockles, and mussels (Perna viridis); seaweeds (Eucheuma cottonii, \nE.  spinosum,  Gracilaria  sp.,  Gelidium  sp.),  and  other  species,  including  sea  cucumber \n(Holothuria  sp.),  also  known  as  beche-de-mer  or  trepang.  Research  and  experimentation \ninvolving other marine species believed to have good production potential have been ongoing at \nthe different aquaculture research centers. Other candidate species for mariculture include the \nswimming crab (Portunus pelagicus), mudcrab (Scylla paramamosain), bigeye trevally (Caranx \nsexfaciatus), golden trevally (Gnathonodon speciosus), Napoleon wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus), \nand big-fin squid (Seploteuthis lessoniana). Preliminary results of the growout of humpback \ngrouper  (Cromileptes  altivelis)  and  tiger  grouper  (erinephelus  fuscoguttatus)  in  cages  in \nLempuing Bay (South Sumatera) were recently made available and indicate very good financial \nreturns. \n \nB.  Markets for Indonesian Aquaculture Products \n5.  Most aquaculture products are consumed domestically, with a local demand high for \nmilkfish, common carp, and tilapia in Java, Sulawesi, Lampung, and inland areas of Sumatera. \nIn addition to the domestic market, aquaculture products are exported to various countries. In \n2001, shrimp produced through aquaculture comprised 76% of total shrimp exports, while crab \nproduced through aquaculture comprised 46% of total crab exports and seaweed produced \nthrough aquaculture comprised 88% of total seaweed exports. Other aquaculture commodities \nwith good export potential include grouper, tilapia, milkfish, channel catfish, and ornamental \nfish. \n \n6.  Supply and Demand Outlook. The demand for fish products is expected to increase \nover the period 2006\u20132014. The projected annual demand for fish was calculated based on \nprojections of total population and fish consumption per capita. Applying an annual growth rate \nof 1.2%, the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) projects the total population of Indonesia to \nincrease from 216.4 million people in 2004 to 243.4 million people in 2014. Per capita fish \nconsumption, based on simple regression analysis using per capita fish consumption time \nseries data for the period 1993\u20132005, is projected to increase from 22.67kg/capita to 31.14 \nkg/capita  between  2005  and  2014.  Given  these  scenarios,  total  annual  fish  demand  is \nexpected to increase from 5.5 million t in 2005 to 7.6 million t in 2014, as shown in Table A1.1 \nbelow. \n \n7.  Estimates of total annual fish supply for the period 2006\u20132014 were based on annual \nprojections of total fish production (i.e., marine capture fisheries, inland capture fisheries, and \naquaculture  fisheries)  and  the  difference  between  fish  exports  and  imports.  Annual  fish \nproduction  from  marine  capture  fisheries,  inland  capture  fisheries,  and  aquaculture  was \nprojected based on 1988\u20132005 time series data and the application of regression analysis. Fish \nproduction from marine fisheries is projected to increase by 7% over the 2005\u20132014 period, \nwhile production from inland fisheries is projected to increase by 2% and from aquaculture \nfisheries by 75% over the same period. Projections of annual fish exports and imports also relied \non estimates of annual growth rates derived from regression analysis (see footnotes in Table \nA1.1). The results of the projections of fish exports and imports indicate that the country will \nremain  a  net  exporter  of  fish  and  fish  products.  Total  fish  supply  available  for  domestic \nconsumption is expected to increase from 5.2 million t in 2005 to 6.4 million t in 2014, which is \nstill below the amount required to satisfy total demand. The estimated fish demand gap was \nabout 263,000 t in 2005, and is projected to increase to about 1,143,000 t in 2014. \n ", "  2\n8\n \nA\nTable A2: Fish Demand and Supply Projections, 2006 \u2013 2014  p\np\n  e\nn\nProjected Fish Production  Net  d\nProjected  Projected per  Projected  Projected  Projected  Projected  ix\nYear  Ppoep(ru0sl0oa0tni os)n a  CoCnaspu(iktmag p)F tiisohn b  DeFm(itsa)h n dc  M(atr)i dn e  In(lta) nd d  Aqua(tc)u dl ture  Total  ExF(ptis)o 4hr t s  ImF(ptis)o dhr t s  (EImxppooor rrttss )  SFu(ipts)ph l y   DeGm(at)ap n  d    2\n(t) \n2006  221,655  25.82  5,722,565  4,221,149  325,108  1,308,715  5,854,972  674,465  182,744  (491,721)  5,363,251  359,314 \n2007  224,196  26.48  5,937,360  4,259,843  325,834  1,392,841  5,978,517  683,329  185,279  (498,049)  5,480,468  456,893 \n2008  226,767  27.15  6,156,328  4,296,648  326,524  1,482,375  6,105,546  691,760  187,690  (504,069)  5,601,477  554,851 \n2009  229,367  27.81  6,379,537  4,331,740  327,181  1,577,664  6,236,586  699,798  189,990  (509,809)  5,726,777  652,759 \n2010  231,997  28.48  6,607,054  4,365,273  327,810  1,679,079  6,372,162  707,480  192,187  (515,293)  5,856,869  750,186 \n2011  234,788  29.14  6,842,785  4,397,378  328,412  1,787,013  6,512,802  714,834  194,290  (520,544)  5,992,259  850,527 \n2012  237,613  29.81  7,083,232  4,428,172  328,989  1,901,885  6,659,046  721,888  196,308  (525,580)  6,133,466  949,767 \n2013  240,473  30.48  7,328,475  4,457,758  329,544  2,024,141  6,811,443  728,665  198,246  (530,419)  6,281,024  1,047,452 \n2014  243,366  31.14  7,578,595  4,486,228  330,077  2,154,256  6,970,561  735,187  200,111  (535,075)  6,435,486  1,143,109 \n \na  Based on 1.2% average annual growth rate as projected by the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS). \nb  Based on time series data over the period 1993\u20142005, and regression analysis. \nc  Project population multiplied by the projected per capita fish consumption. \nd  Based on time series data over the period 1988\u20142005, and regression analysis. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.", "  Appendix 2  29 \nC.

Fish \ndisease laboratories have also been established by the Government at five sites, namely: (i) \nKarawang, West Java; (ii) Indramayu, West Java; (iii) Maribaya (Tegal), Central Java; (iv) \nBangil, East Java; and (v) Pangkep, South Sulawesi. Technical implementing units reporting to \nthe DGA have been set up in 12 sites to develop hatchery and fish culture techniques for \ntransfer to the private sector and provide fish farmers with technical support services in fish \nhealth and environmental management. \n \n9.   In 2002, there were about 12,500 small- and medium-scale processing facilities in 30 \nprovinces and about 600 industrial fish-processing plants for various fish and aquatic products. \nThe product is exported to Asian countries, the United States, Canada, and the European \nUnion. More than half (339) of the industrial processing plants have been implementing the \nHazard Analysis for Critical Control Point (HACCP) program for quality and safety assurance \nfor fisheries products and are eligible to export products to the EU. Ice plants and cold-storage \nfacilities are part of the functional facilities of the fishing ports, which usually have designated \nindustrial areas for handling and post-harvest activities, ice plants, and cold storage.  \n \n10.  In most district capitals, there are public markets with areas specifically designated for \nfish sales. In Jakarta City, there are over 200 public markets, large and small, which cater to the \nday-to-day  needs  of  the  general  public  for  seafood,  particularly  for  middle-  to  low-income \nconsumers. Muara Baru, Jakarta, has a wholesale fish market where marine fish is traded every \nnight. The wholesale fish market in Sukabumi is mainly for freshwater live fish, including fry and \nfingerlings. \n \n  2.  Research, Training, and Extension \n   \n11.  Aquaculture research currently focuses on the development of methods, techniques, and \nsystems for commodities with potential for commercial production. Product-processing research, \non the other hand, centers on adding value for fisheries and aquatic products through the \nadvanced  processing  techniques  and  quality  improvement.  Strategic  marine  and  fisheries \nresearch is the main responsibility of the Agency for Marine and Fisheries Research (AMFR), \nwhich has three research institutes under its Research Center for Aquaculture, one each for \nmariculture, freshwater aquaculture, and brackishwater aquaculture. \n \n12.  Education  and  Training.    MMAF  has  three  institutes  of  higher  learning  under  its \nadministration: a fisheries institute in Jakarta, an aquaculture academy in Sidoardjo and an \naquaculture  academy  in  Sorong.  Seven  fisheries  high  schools  train  middle-level  fisheries \npersonnel and field extension workers. These are located in Aceh, Kota Agung, Pariaman, \nTegal, Bone, Pontianak, and Ambon. In addition, there are five fisheries training centers\u2014in \nMedan, Tegal, Banyuwangi, Bitung, and Ambon. On average, each school produces at least 40 \nfisheries graduates per year with specialization in various fields. \n \n13.  Extension.    With  the  establishment  of  MMAF  and  the  passage  of  the  Regional \nAutonomy  Law,  both  in  1999,  fisheries  extension  services  were  devolved  to  district \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \ngovernments. Depending on the relative importance of fisheries to the local economy, extension \nservices have either been performed by a separate fisheries service (i.e., the Dinas Kelautan \ndan Perikanan [district fisheries service]) or have been embedded within the Dinas for livestock \nand fisheries.1 As a result of devolution of fisheries extension to the local governments, there is \nno longer a national government agency that is primarily responsible for (i) formulating fisheries \nextension  policy,  (ii)  developing  programs  and  technical  guidelines,  (iii)  providing  technical \nguidance for extension workers, and (iv) carrying out strategic extension activities with inter-\nministerial ramifications. \n \n14.  At the local level, governments generally lack the preparation, resources, and capacity to \ntake on active extension and coordination roles. The organizational structures differ from one \ndistrict to another, but these structures are usually weak and lack responsiveness to evolving \nfisher/fish farmer aspirations and needs. Extension workers suffer from low morale and lack of \nmotivation resulting from deficiencies in job design, appraisal, and incentive systems. Human \nresource  systems,  including  selection,  deployment,  and  promotion,  are  also  deficient.  The \nextension systems for aquaculture lack an integrated, cross-sector approach, and the level of \naquaculture technology entering the formal extension system is severely limited because of \nweak extension\u2013research linkages. In addition, budgetary, human resource, and institutional \nlimitations have severely hampered the transfer of technology to poor fishers and fish farmers.  \n \nD.  Sector Issues \n \n15.  Indonesia\u2019s aquaculture subsector is confronted with numerous problems, most notably: \n(i) high incidence of poverty among small fish farmers, (ii) environmental degradation, (iii) low \ngrowth and productivity caused by poor farm management and lack of good quality seeds, (iv) \nlack of credit facilities for poor fish farmers, (v) lack of post-production facilities and marketing \ninfrastructure, and (vi) lack of social preparation and inefficient extension services. The financial \ncrisis of 1997 further aggravated the accessibility of credit and effectively increased the prices of \nimported inputs like feeds and chemicals. \n \n16.  The  industry  suffers  from  low  productivity  as  a  result  of  technical,  economic,  and \nenvironmental factors. Small fish farmers usually practice extensive culture using low-yielding, \nlow-input, and low-level technology, and lack the technical know-how or skills to enable them to \nadopt new or improved production methods and techniques. Their problems are compounded, in \nsome areas, by the occurrence of fish or shrimp diseases, which are usually triggered by poor \nenvironmental quality, inferior seed quality, poor hatchery and culture management, and other \nfactors. Small-scale fish farmers also lack sufficient funds to shift to higher-density farming or \nhigher value commodities. Problems associated with aquaculture business ventures (e.g., low \nproduction performance, disease occurrence, and fluctuating prices) have contributed to the \nimage of aquaculture as a high-risk industry. Financial institutions have therefore been reluctant \nto extend credit to fish farmers\u2014especially small fish farmers. Formal financial institutions also \ngenerally require collateral and proof of ability to repay loans, which small fish farmers lack. This \nleaves small fish farmers reliant on their own labor and meager financial resources to run their \nsubsistence culture operations. If they do manage to secure loans, it is usually from informal \nlending sources which don't require collateral but demand usurious interest rates. \n \n                                                 \n1  For example, among the districts selected for inclusion in the proposed Project, only Buton has a separate Dinas \nKelautan dan Perikanan; in the others, fisheries functions are carried out by the Dinas for livestock/agriculture and \nfisheries \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \n17.  The combination of factors outlined above has resulted in low incomes and poor quality \nof life for small fish farmers. Their incomes fall way below the national average, and they have \nlimited or no access to basic social services such as health, education, water supply, sanitation, \ntransport, and communication. Literacy levels are very low, mortality and morbidity rates are \nhigh, and more than one-third of small farmers and fishers live below the poverty line.  \n \n18.  Aside from the above technical and socioeconomic issues, there are policy, legal, and \ninstitutional constraints hampering the further development of aquaculture. In the area of policy \nand legislation, the passage of Law 32/2004 on Regional Governance, which called for the \ndevolution of a number of fisheries management responsibilities from the central government to \nthe local governments, has various implications for the sector. Firstly, there is general ambiguity \nin the definition of roles of the central, provincial, and district governments, especially as those \nroles pertain to marine and coastal management. Secondly, the responsibility for aquaculture \ndevelopment  and  spatial  planning  for  aquaculture  activities  now  lies  with  the  regional \ngovernments, except when foreign investments are involved, in which case DGA review and \nrecommendation are required prior to approval by the regional government concerned. Thirdly, \nwhile the central government retains responsibility for formulating criteria for determining and \nchanging the land use of areas designated for aquaculture, the regional government makes the \nfinal decision on whether or not to consider such criteria in the preparation of their regional \nspatial plans. Fourthly, the local governments that are suddenly empowered to handle such \ntechnical responsibilities lack the capacity (in terms of knowledge, skills, and resources) to \nadequately perform their tasks. \n \n19.  Finally, and most importantly, with the devolution of fisheries extension to the local \ngovernments,  a  national  government  agency  no  longer  has  primary  responsibility  for  (i) \nformulating  fisheries  extension  policy,  (ii)  developing  extension  programs  and  technical \nguidelines, (iii) providing technical guidance to extension workers, and (iv) carrying out strategic \nextension  activities  with  inter-ministerial  ramifications.  To  make  matters  worse,  local \ngovernments generally lack the preparation, resources, and capacity to take on active extension \ndevelopment and coordination. The result is an extension organization that is structurally weak \nand non-responsive to evolving fish farmer needs. The extension systems for aquaculture in \nparticular  lack  an  integrated,  cross-sector  approach.  The  level  of  aquaculture  technology \nentering the formal extension system is severely limited by weak extension\u2013research linkages, \ninadequate technology adoption, and inadequate technology transfer to end-users. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nADB-FINANCED LOAN AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECTS IN THE SECTOR \nLoan/TA  Amount  Date \nTitle \nNumber  ($'000)  Approved \nA.

The five project districts were selected based on the following main criteria: (i) they have \ngood  potential  for  further  resource  development  and  are  in  need  of  improved  aquaculture \nsystems to raise productivity and protect the environment; (ii) they exhibit high poverty incidence \namong the agricultural population (based on data and information from the Central Bureau of \nStatistics, 2002); (iii) the district government is committed to improving aquaculture production \nand socioeconomic conditions for fish farmers; and (iv) the limited financial capacity of the \ndistrict government constrains further investment in aquaculture. \n \n2.  Within each district, subdistricts were selected based mainly on the aquatic resource \nbase and its potential for development, and on the socioeconomic conditions for local fish \nfarmers.  Within  an  identified  subdistrict,  it  is  the  district  government  and  the  local  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) that will, within a year of project launch, identify villages and fish \nfarmers eligible to participate in the Project. The general criteria for selection of subprojects are \nshown in the following box: \n \nA. Selection Criteria for Culture Species \n1.  Species must have been previously cultured in the country and not harm indigenous \nspecies in the area. \n2.  Its rate of growth must be sufficiently high. \n3.  It must be able to reproduce successfully under culture conditions. \n4.  It must accept and thrive on abundant and cheap artificial feeds. \n5.  It must be acceptable to the target consumers. \n6.  It should be able to support a high population density in ponds or cages. \n7.  It must have a high resistance to disease. \n8.  Seeds must be available and easy to obtain. \n \nB. Selection Criteria for Technology to be Adopted \n1.  The technology should be simple, low-cost, and low-level to facilitate transfer to, and \nadoption by, fish farmers and have greater chances of success. \n2.  More complex technologies which require higher capital and other inputs are better \nsuited to medium- and large-scale private entrepreneurs with the capability to engage \nthe services of technical specialists in running their operations. \n \nC. Criteria for the Siting of Brackishwater Aquaculture and Mariculture Subprojects \n1.  The subproject should not be located in environmentally critical areas, such as protected \nforests, marine sanctuaries, or nature reserves.  \n2.  The subproject should not involve the conversion of mangrove forests into fishponds. \n3.  The subproject should not involve the destruction of coastal habitats such as coral reefs \nand seagrass beds and associated flora and fauna. \n4.  Ample  attention  must  be  paid  to  site  selection,  culture  installation  design,  and  the \nmanagement of culture operations to preserve the integrity of the environment.  \n5.  Integrated aquaculture, such as maintaining of mangroves along fishpond dikes and in \nnearby areas, should be encouraged for environmental conservation. \n6.  The subproject will involve minimal land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \n \n3.  The selection of project beneficiaries will be based on criteria to be detailed during the \nfirst year of implementation. A preliminary list of selection criteria for small-scale fish farmers to \nbe eligible to participate in the Project includes the following: (i) must belong to \u201cpoor income \ngroups\u201d  as  defined  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  and  Annual \nDevelopment Plan; (ii) must belong to organized fish farmer groups; (iii) must have some prior \nexperience in fish farming; (iv) must be willing to undergo training in improved methods and \npractices of aquaculture; (v) must be willing to share their new skills with other fish farmers in \nthe community; and (vi) must be willing to be supervised and monitored by project personnel. \n ", "  Appendix 6  37 \nPROPOSED PRODUCTION-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES AT THE PROJECT SITES \n \nActivities  Species  Production System  Project Site \n  Common carp   Seed production (hatchery and nursery)  Sumedang \nProduction by fish  (Cyprinus carpio)  and growout in ponds, floating cages, and \nfarmers organizations  paddy fields \n  Nile tilapia   Seed production (hatchery and nursery)  Sumedang  \nTraining, extension,  (Oreochromis niloticus)  and growout in ponds, floating cages \ne  and production inputs \nur assistance \nult\nc\na\nu\nq\nA\ner  Asian catfish   Cage culture  Ogan \nat (Pangasius  Komering Ilir \nw\nh hypophthalmus) \ns Demonstration \ne Freshwater giant prawn  Seed production (hatchery and nursery)  Sumedang \nr\nF (Macrobrachium  and growout in ponds; Integrated rice-\nrosenbergii)  prawn farming \nResearch  Asian catfish   Seed production  Ogan \n(Pangasius  Komering Ilir \nhypophthalmus) \nProduction by fish  Milkfish  Monoculture in ponds or polyculture with  Karawang \nfarmers organizations  (Chanos chanos)  shrimp    \n  Shrimp  Seed production and growout in ponds, in  Karawang, \nTraining, extension,    polyculture with milkfish   Ogan \ne  and production inputs  Komering Ilir \nur assistance   Shrimp  Seed production and growout in ponds   Langkat, \nult   Ogan \nac Komering Ilir \nu\nq Soft shell mangrove crab  Crab floating cage   Karawang \nA  \nr \ne Mangrove crab   Crab fattening in traditional ponds (tambak)  Ogan \nwat (Scylla serrata)  Komering Ilir \nh Milkfish (C. chanos) and  Pond polyculture  Ogan \ns\nki shrimp   Komering Ilir \nc\na Research  Oyster (Crassostrea spp.)  Off-bottom culture  Karawang \nr\nB Freshwater giant prawn  Culture in tambak  Karawang \n(M. rosenbergii) \nGrouper  (Epinephelus  Culture in tambak  Karawang, \nfuscoguttatus)  Ogan \nKomering Ilir \nProduction by fish  Seaweed   Raft, longline culture  Buton \nfarmers organizations  (Eucheuma cottonii)   \n  Grouper  (Epinephelus  Seed production (hatchery and nursery)  Buton \nTraining, extension,  spp., Cromileptis altivelis)  and growout in cages \ne  and production inputs  Green  mussel  (Perna  Raft culture  Buton, \nur assistance   viridis)  Karawang \nult Grouper   Seed production (hatchery and nursery)  Buton, \nc\nri (Epinephelus spp.)  and growout in floating net cages  Karawang \na\nM Sea cucumber   Stock enhancement/culture-based fisheries  Buton  \n(Holothuria spp.)  \nResearch  Swimming crab  Pen culture  Buton \nAbalone (Haliotis asinina)  Pen and cage culture    Buton \nLobster (Panulirus spp)  Pen and cage culture  Buton \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government.\n ", "38  Appendix 7 \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A7.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category  \n($ million) \nItem  Total Cost  % of Total Base Cost \nA.

Financial  and  economic  analyses  are  undertaken  to  evaluate  the  viability  and \nsustainability  of  the  selected  aquaculture  activities  selected  for  the  Project.  The  economic \nanalysis provides the economic rationale of the Project and determines its economic viability. \nThe financial analysis examines the financial sustainability of the selected subproject schemes \nfrom the fish farmers\u2019 point of view. \n \nA.  Major Assumptions \n2.  The economic analysis is based on the assumptions outlined in the following sections: \n \n1.  Prices \n \n3.  Financial  benefits  and  costs  are  estimated  in  constant  2006  prices.  All  prices  are \nexpressed at the world market price level in the national currency. Financial farmgate prices are \nbased on findings of surveys undertaken during the feasibility study in 2004 and adjusted to the \ninflation rate. For this analysis, the prevailing interbank exchange rate of Rp9,000 per US dollar \nis used; opportunity cost of capital is assumed at 12%. \n \n4.  Labor costs have been shadow-priced at 0.65 of the wage rates, while nontradable \ninputs have been adjusted by the standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.90. The financial \nanalysis considers only hired labor, while the economic analysis includes estimations of both \nfamily and hired labor.  \n \n2.  Period of Economic Analysis \n \n5.  The economic life of the Project is assumed to be 20 years, from 2007 to 2026. The \nmajor project activities will be implemented over a 6-year period from 2007 to 2013.      \n \n3.  Project Economic Costs \n \n6.  The economic costs of the Project are estimated at $38.82 million.1 The economic price \nof land was calculated by adjusting the prevailing market prices by the SCF.   \n \n4.  Project Economic Benefits \n \n7.  The Project will promote the establishment and development of aquaculture enterprises \nby providing technical skills development to fish farmers, improving infrastructure and marketing \nsupport to the fish farmers, and strengthening extension services and policies and regulations \nfor aquaculture and related activities.  \n \n8.  Aquaculture products are usually purchased live by traders at the farm site. A portion of \nthese products is sold to retailers (either live or fresh) at local markets within the district. The rest \nis sold to other urban markets such as Jakarta, Palembang, Medan, Bandung, and Surabaya, or \ndirectly to exporters who ship the commodities to international markets. There are, however, \nsome prevailing site-specific constraints that cause inefficiencies in the marketing flow in the \n                                                 \n1  The economic costs of the Project were derived from subtracting the price contingencies and transfer payments \n(taxes and duties) from the financial total project costs.  \n \n ", "48  Appendix 12 \ndistricts. These include: (i) the poor condition of pathways and farm-to-market roads at farm \nsites, particularly in shrimp production areas such as OKI, Karawang, and Langkat; (ii) the large \nnumber of small fish farmers, which makes it difficult and costly for traders to assemble fish \nproducts; (iii) a lack of fish receiving and marketing stations where farmers and traders can meet \nand transact business; and (v) a lack of proper seaweed-drying facilities. These constraints have \ncontributed to high procurement costs\u2014specifically transportation costs\u2014among traders, which \nhave resulted in smaller margins relative to those received by farmers. In the \u2018without Project\u2019 \nscenario, it is assumed that these factors continue to constrain aquaculture sector growth; \nhence, production levels remain the same. In the \u2018with Project\u2019 scenario, fish production is \nexpected to grow at 6.4% annually.  \n \n9.  In  the  \u201dwith  Project\u201d  scenario,  the  main  quantifiable  benefit  will  be  in  the  form  of \nincremental aquaculture production. By improving access infrastructure and fish post-harvest \nand processing facilities, promoting competitive fish/shrimp hatcheries and nurseries to support \nseed  requirements,  and  providing  marketing  support,  the  Project  will  significantly  reduce \ntransaction costs and increase farmgate prices of aquaculture products. The introduction of new \nculture techniques or new aquaculture commodities through pilot demonstrations, based on \napplied research results, will improve aquaculture yields.  \n \n10.  Apart  from  aquaculture  production  benefits,  the  Project  will  generate  a  number  of \nbenefits that are not readily quantifiable. Community organizing and institutional strengthening of \ndistrict  governments  are  among  the  most  important  elements  of  project  design.  The \nstrengthening of extension services will enhance the sustainability of aquaculture by improving \nthe provision of continuous technical support and training to fish farmers. The establishment of \nresearch\u2013extension  linkages  between  provincial  and  district  fisheries  services,  which  will \nfacilitate the commercial application of research results by fish farmers, is expected to lead to \nadditional improvements in aquaculture productivity at project sites. The training of fish farmers \nand demonstrations of various aquaculture systems will not only lead to the establishment of \nsmall-scale enterprises by fish farmers, but will also provide technically educated labor for \nmedium-scale enterprises. The improvements in financial returns for aquaculture enterprises as \na result of project activities should lead to more private sector participation. \n \n11.  The  Project  will  also  result  in:  (i)  environmental  benefits  arising  from  improved \naquaculture resources management at the district and village levels; (ii) improved nutrition and \nhealth of rural populations from increases in food supply - especially in animal protein; (iii) \nenhanced inter-agency and public-private sector linkages through strengthened partnerships in \naquaculture development; and (iv) empowerment of small fish farmers and rural communities \nwith  knowledge  and  skills  in  community-based  aquaculture  and  culture-based  fisheries \nmanagement. \n  \nB.  Assessment of Financial Returns to Fish Farmers \n12.  Prior to being promoted in the project sites, the commercial viability of each type of \nactivity will be assessed through site selection criteria. To determine their financial viability, a \nfinancial analysis for five representative activities at the farm level will be undertaken (grouper \ncage culture, mudcrab fattening, seaweed production, carp ponds culture, and tiger-shrimp \ncultivation).  All  of  the  representative  aquaculture  activities  exhibit  financial  returns  that \nsignificantly exceed the prevailing financial cost of capital of 22% (Table A12.1). Detailed fish-\nfarm budgets are presented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n ", "  Appendix 12  49 \n13.  Sensitivity  Analysis.  Sensitivity  analysis  is  undertaken  to  determine  the  effect  of \nidentified risk factors that may have adverse impacts on the financial performance of these \nactivities. For purposes of the analysis, three major risks are considered: (i) increase in variable \ncosts  (feeds,  fish  seed,  fertilizers,  other  production  materials,  and  labor);  (ii)  decrease  in \nrevenues resulting from production shortfalls or a decline in farmgate output prices (various \nfactors could cause such a decline, such as an increase in marketing or transportation costs); \nand  (iii)  occurrence  of  disease  every  two  years  (which  would  decrease  output  10\u201350% \ndepending on the cultivated fish species). The analysis indicates that it would take serious \nadverse impacts for the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) to decline to the prevailing \nweighted financial cost of capital of 22% (Table A12.1). \n \nTable A12.1: Financial Returns on Aquaculture Enterprises \n \nItem  FIRR (%)  Switching Values (%)  FIRR (%) \nBase  Increase in  Decrease in total revenue  Impact of occurrence \nCase  Variable  (postharvest losses,  of disease every two \nCosts  decrease in price)  years \nGrouper cage culture (Buton)  47  13.5  10.6  42 \nMud crab fattening (Langkat)  66  41.2  25.4   \nCarp pond culture  39  80.9  23.3  29 \n(Sumedang) \nShrimp culture (Karawang)  50  74.9  29.3  37 \nSeaweed culture (Buton)  44  13.3  10.3  26 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Assessment of Economic Returns \n14.   To determine the economic viability of the Project, economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) values are estimated for representative aquaculture activities. All costs are in constant \nyear  2005  terms.  The  project  costs,  excluding  the  price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction, are appropriately apportioned to individual schemes. The prices of nontradable \ngoods were adjusted to the world price level by the SCF. Results of the economic analysis, \nsummarized in Table A12.2, show that EIRR values for individual schemes range from 15% to \n21%, which provide an indicative range for the Project\u2019s overall EIRR. \n \nTable A12.2: Anticipated Scheme Level Economic Worth \n \nScheme  Grouper Cage  Mud Crab  Carp Culture  Tiger Shrimp  Seaweed \n(Buton)  (Langkat)  (Sumedang)  (Karawang)  (Buton) \nEIRR (%)  16  21  15  19  20 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Distribution of Project Benefits \n \n15.  Project benefits will accrue to three distinct groups: (i) producers, (ii) associate service \nproviders, and (iii) consumers. The Project will have direct impacts on producers and indirect \nimpacts on associated service providers of inputs such as seed, chemicals, and other supplies, \nas well as on the transport industry. In addition, the Project will contribute to national food \nsecurity and provide a key source of protein to low income households. \n \n16.  The selection criteria for subproject sites and beneficiaries require beneficiaries to be \npoor (Appendix 5). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the average poverty and near \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \npoverty lines for 2004 were Rp5,218,800 and Rp6,652,560, respectively. The indirect benefits of \nthe project accrue to poor and non-poor households. The poor provide transportation and \nprocessing  services.  The  non-poor  are  sometimes  owners  of  these  services.    As  the \nassessment of the feasibility of this investment and the cost-benefit analysis only consider direct \nproject impacts, this assessment of benefits will focus only on the outcomes for direct project \nbeneficiaries.  \n \n17.  The Project will directly benefit more than 14,000 households (Table A12.3). The Project \nwill also generate additional employment opportunities as a result of increased demand for \ntransportation and fish-processing activities. Returns for households will depend primarily on the \ntype of activity they adopt, which in turn will be determined by the production potential of their \narea (Table A12.4). Table A12.5 compares pre-project and post-project income for the three \ngroups  of  producers.  The  majority  of  households,  which  are  involved  in  groups  2  and  3 \nproduction activities will be firmly non poor. Only group 1 households, which produce seaweed \nand engage in polyculture, will remain near poor and vulnerable to shock.  \n \nTable A12.3: Estimated Annual Production-Related Employment \nSeasonal Auxiliary Labor \nItems  Units  Total \nUnits  Input \nManaged   Households \nEstablished  Number Individual Total \nper  Managing \n  by Project  of  Person  Person \nHousehold Enterprises\nPersons  Years  Years\nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in Indonesia: \nAquaculture has been playing an increasingly important role in ensuring food availability, providing household food \nsecurity, and generating valuable foreign exchange and domestic revenues. Aside from contributing about one-fifth of \nthe country\u2019s estimated total fish production, the aquaculture subsector has been providing employment to some \n2.2 million  people,  representing  around  40%  of  the  total  number  of  people  employed  in  the  fisheries  sector. \nAquaculture also absorbs much of the growing labor force that enters the job market each year, cushioning the \neconomic hardships faced by people seeking gainful employment. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  Targeted Intervention \nThe country's aquaculture subsector suffers from low productivity as a result of technical, \neconomic, and environmental factors. Small-scale fish farmers usually practice extensive \nculture, which gives low yields. These problems are compounded by the high prices of \nimported  production  inputs  and  a  lack  of  post-production  facilities  and  market \ninfrastructure. In some areas, there have been outbreaks of fish and shrimp disease, \nusually triggered by poor environmental quality, inferior seed quality, and poor hatchery \nand culture management. Small-scale fish farmers also lack funds to shift to higher density \nfarming or higher-value commodities, and cannot access credit from local banks and \nfinancial institutions. The combination of these factors has resulted in low incomes and \npoor quality of life for small-scale fish farmers. \n \nBased on results of the socioeconomic survey of selected households, the average poverty \nincidence among fish-farmer households in the five project districts is estimated at 34%. \nThis figure is higher than the official Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) estimate of overall \npoverty incidence in the five districts, which is 20.2%. This shows that the aquaculture \nsector in project districts is disproportionately poor compared with other economic sectors. \nLow incomes have led to a certain amount of deprivation within fish-farming households, as \ndemonstrated by the following statistics: (i) 66% of households have poor access to and \nlow utilization of quality health care and clinical services; (ii) 61% of families lack sustained \naccess to a safe water; (iii) local kids get an average of only 5.5 years of schooling (the \nfigure is lower for young girls); (iv) 32% of children under 5 years have substandard \nnutritional  status;  and  (v)  more  than  50%  of  women  primarily  work  at  unpaid  jobs, \ndemonstrating a lack of income-generating opportunities in these communities.1 \n \nTo  address  the  poverty  issues  confronting  the  small-scale  fish  farmers  and  their \nhouseholds, the Project will introduce them to improved, sustainable, environment-friendly \naquaculture practices and techniques. The Project will provide small-scale fish farmers with \ntechnical and financial assistance to launch and sustain small but income-generating \naquaculture enterprises. Organizations of fish farmers\u2014including women fish farmers\u2014will \nbe strengthened. And fish farmers will improve their skills and knowledge of aquaculture \ntechnologies with the help of extension workers and the support of the local fisheries office. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe Project followed a participatory approach in its formulation. The project framework and overall design were \ndeveloped through a series of workshops, consultations, and discussions at the central, district, subdistrict, and village \nlevels. Household surveys, supplemented by focus group discussions, were conducted in sample villages where poor \naquaculture households made up the majority of respondents. The results of the workshops and consultations, as well \nas the local-level household surveys, were used as inputs in project design. Provisions were made to encourage \nparticipation in all the major project activities, especially in the refinement of the appropriate Project outputs for each \ndistrict. Most project activities at the local level will be implemented by local governments and the Dinas Kelautan dan \nPerikanan (district fisheries services) in collaboration with community-based organizations (CBOs) and assisted by \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), thus enhancing local ownership of the Project. \nDuring the Project\u2019s social preparation stage, an in-depth participatory rural appraisal will be conducted in each of the \ndistricts and subdistricts. The detailed work plan for each area will take into consideration the results of the rural \nappraisal. Village-level planning for project implementation will be spearheaded by the CBOs, and communities will be ", "  Appendix 13  53 \nrepresented in decision-making structures at the local level. CBOs and organized fish-farmer groups, as well as other \ncommunity members, will be key players in the implementation of specific interventions in aquaculture production and \nmicroenterprise development.  The stakeholder analysis and participation plan are in Supplementary Appendix E. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize positive impacts on women: \nThe Project will support poor women in gaining access to resources, technical assistance, and capacity-building \nefforts for poverty reduction and food security. Women will be included in all project activities, including production-\ninputs assistance and training programs. Likewise, women will be encouraged to participate in setting up, operating, \nand managing small-scale, culture-based fishery enterprises. The strengthening of women\u2019s groups will ensure \nequitable opportunities for women to be represented and assume leadership positions in decision-making bodies, \nespecially at the local level. To assure that gender concerns are addressed not only by the Project but also in the \nwider areas of education, nutrition, and child care, gender specialists will be hired to conduct gender training to \nsensitize local government officials and extension personnel of the Dinas Kelautan dan Perikanan to women\u2019s needs \nand sociocultural issues.  \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n \n1.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) of the proposed Sustainable Aquaculture \nDevelopment for Food Security and Poverty Reduction Project was carried out to (i) ascertain its \nimpacts on the environment and (ii) identify necessary measures to prevent or mitigate any \nadverse environmental impacts which could possibly arise from project implementation. Since \nthe identification of specific aquaculture production activities and the final selection of sites for \nthose activities will be made only during project implementation, a generic IEE was prepared. \nAn  environmental  screening  of  the  project  components  and  proposed  interventions  was \nconducted to determine whether they would require an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \nor whether an IEE would suffice. The IEE was carried out in accordance with the Environmental \nAssessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank (2003). The checklists used for \ndetermining  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  prototype  interventions  are  provided  in \nADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural and Natural Resources Development \nProjects (1991). \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The proposed Project will promote the adoption of sustainable, community-managed \naquaculture in five districts. It will address existing problems within the Indonesian aquaculture \nindustry and tap the vast potential of the country\u2019s aquaculture resources, thereby reducing \npoverty and ensuring food security among fish-farming communities in rural inland and coastal \nareas. The Project will focus on the development and demonstration of small-scale, low-cost, \nlow-input aquaculture production systems that are economically sound, environment friendly, \nand capable of being easily replicated by fish farmers organizations and small- to medium-scale \nprivate  entrepreneurs.  The  Project  will  promote  and  facilitate  partnerships  and  other \narrangements between small fish farmers and commercial private sector operators in order to \nensure ready markets for their produce and easy access to production inputs. It will likewise \nprovide massive technical and extension support for fish farmer beneficiaries in order to ensure \nsuccessful implementation, and include innovative mechanisms to assist organized fish farmer \ngroups with their production inputs requirement. Through its institutional strengthening activities, \nthe Project will assist DGA and the participating district governments in building their technical \ncapacity  to  support  the  needs  of  the  beneficiaries,  their  communities,  and  the  Indonesian \naquaculture industry as a whole. \n \n3.  The Project will be implemented in five districts in four provinces, namely: (i) Langkat in \nNorth  Sumatera  Province;  (ii)  Ogan  Komering  Ilir  (OKI)  in  South  Sumatera  Province;  (iii) \nKarawang  and  Sumedang  in  West  Java  Province;  and  (iv)  Buton  in  Southeast  Sulawesi \nProvince. The Project will be implemented by DGA and the participating district governments \nover a six-year period (2007-2012) at a total cost of about $45 million equivalent. It will comprise \nthree components, namely: (i) Aquaculture Production Enhancement, (ii) Aquaculture Support \nServices, and (iii) Institutional Strengthening and Project Management. The main interventions \nand principal parties involved in implementation of each of these components are summarized \nin Table A14.1. \n \n \n \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \nTable A14.1: Project Components, Interventions, and Implementation Responsibilities \nComponent  Main Interventions  Implementation Responsibilities \nAquaculture  \u2022  Rehabilitation/improvement of freshwater  \u2022 Communities with DFS support and NGO \nProduction  and brackishwater fishponds  assistance  \nEnhancement  \u2022  Construction/establishment of fish/shrimp  \u2022 Communities with support from DFS, PIUs, \nComponent  hatcheries   and CEWs \n\u2022  Upgrading/expansion of district  \u2022 District governments, DFS, PIUs with \ngovernment hatcheries  consultant assistance \n\u2022  Establishment of demonstration facilities  \u2022 District governments, DFS, PMO,  PIUs \nfor various aquaculture production systems  \u2022 NGOs, CBOs, DFS, CEWs \n\u2022  Training of fish farmers  \u2022 DFS, district governments, NGOs, \n\u2022  Improvement of environmental  communities, PMO, PIUs  \nmanagement and conservation  \u2022 District governments, PIUs, NGOs with \n\u2022  Establishment of stock enhancement sites  assistance from consultants \nand community-managed, culture-based \nfisheries \nAquaculture  \u2022  Improvement of fish/shrimp/seaweed post- \u2022 Communities with DFS support and NGO \nSupport Services  harvest and processing facilities  assistance \nComponent  \u2022  Market development and promotion  \u2022 PMO, PIUs, DFS with consultant assistance \n\u2022  Provision of production inputs assistance  \u2022 District governments, DFS, PIUs, with \n\u2022  Strengthening and provision of extension  assistance from NGOs and consultants \nservices  \u2022 PMO, PIUs, DFS, CEWs with consultant \n\u2022  Conduct of applied research  assistance \n\u2022  Provision of social infrastructure facilities  \u2022 Academic/research institutions with support \nand services  from DGA and AMFR \n\u2022 DFS, PIUs, communities with assistance \nfrom PMO, PIUs, and consultants \nInstitutional  \u2022  Capacity building of  DGA, district DFS,  \u2022 PMO and PIU consultants with assistance \nStrengthening and  and fish farmer organizations  from NGOs \nProject  \u2022  Training  \u2022 NGOs, PMO/PIU consultants \nManagement  \u2022  Facility upgrading of district government  \u2022 DFS with assistance from PMO, PIUs, and \nComponent  hatcheries, etc.  consultants \n  \u2022  Aquaculture policy formulation and  \u2022 DGA, district government with consultant \nregulation  assistance \n\u2022  Aquaculture management information  \u2022 DGA/PMO with consultant assistance \nsystem  \u2022 DGA, district governments \n\u2022  Establishment of PMO and PIUs   \u2022 DGA/PMO, district governments/PIUs  \n\u2022  Consulting services, NGO services, and  \u2022 PMO and PIUs with assistance from \nother service contractors  consultants \n\u2022  Routine project management, including \nprocurement, disbursement, and M&E, \nreporting. \nAMFR = Agency for Marine and Fisheries Research, CBO = community-based organization, CEW = community-\nbased extension worker, DFS = district fisheries service, DGA = Directorate General of Aquaculture, M&E = \nmonitoring and evaluation, NGO = nongovernment organization, PMO = project management office, PIU = project \nimplementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \nC.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n4.  The first step in predicting the environmental impacts of the proposed project activities \nwas to screen and categorize them according to the magnitude and scale of their potential \nadverse  impacts  on  the  environment.  Using  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003), the results of the environmental screening of project components are in Table A14.2. \n ", "    Appendix 14     57     \nTable A14.2: Environmental Categories of Project Components and Interventions \nComponent  Interventions  Category \n  Capacity building of DGA and the district marine and fisheries services at the five   \n  project sites  C \nInstitutional  Support to DGA and provincial/district governments in the five project sites in policy   \nStrengthening  dialogues and aquaculture policy formulation, licensing, and regulation  C \nand   Establishment of an aquaculture information system  C \nProject  Design and implementation of a massive training program for project stakeholders  C \nManagement   Establishment of a PMO and five PIUs in the participating district governments,   \nprovision of long-term consultants, and engagement of NGOs to assist in local-level   \nproject implementation  C \n  Establishment  of  demonstration  facilities  for  fish/shrimp/seaweed  post-harvest   \n  handling, processing, and marketing   B \n  Development of strategies to facilitate access to credit for fish farmers  C \nAquaculture   Expansion  of markets for traditional aquaculture commodities and promotion of   \nSupport  consumption of identified species  C \nServices  Upgrading  of  existing,  and  construction  of  new,  water  quality  and  fish  health  B \nlaboratories  \nProvision of basic social infrastructure (e.g., community water supply)  B \nConducting applied aquaculture research   C \n  Social preparation, community organizing, and capacity development of fish farmers   \n  and their organizations  C \nAquaculture   Rehabilitation  and/or  establishment  of  land-based  fish/shrimp/prawn  hatcheries,   \nProduction  nurseries, and growout facilities  B \nEnhancement  Establishment of mariculture facilities for fish, molluscs, and seaweeds  B \nEstablishment of demonstration facilities for fish/shrimp/seaweed seed production   \nand culture  B \nCommunity-based management of culture-based fisheries  B \nDGA = Directorate General of Aquaculture, NGO = nongovernment organization, PIU = project implementation unit, \nPMO = project management office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n5.  The prototype interventions classified as category B (i.e., they could produce small or \nmoderate  adverse  environmental  impacts)  were  then  tested  vis-\u00e0-vis  actions  affecting \nenvironmental resources and values, as listed in ADB\u2019s Checklist of Environmental Parameters \nfor Fisheries and Aquaculture Projects. Those activities which are classified under Category C \n(unlikely  to  have  adverse  environmental  impacts)  were  no  longer  subjected  to  checklist \nscreening. The ADB checklist showed that most project activities under Category B are not \nexpected to result in significant adverse impacts. However, there could be small or moderate \nimpacts resulting from site selection, construction, or operation. These potential impacts and the \ncorresponding mitigation measures are summarized in Table A14.3.  \n \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n6.  Institutional Arrangements. As the specific subprojects for implementation under the \nProject have yet to be identified and the subproject sites yet to be selected, a preliminary \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan (EMP) was prepared as part of the IEE. The \nEMP  includes  general  environmental  guidelines  and  criteria  for  subproject  selection,  and \nindicates the environmental management costs incorporated into the project budget. However, \nbecause environmental monitoring is an ongoing activity, and because the EMP needs to allow \nfor future modifications based on real time requirements, it will be prepared by the project \nmanagement office (PMO), with the assistance of an environment specialist, at the Project\u2019s \ninception stage. The EMP will be implemented by technical personnel from the PIUs and district \nfisheries services, as well as NGOs and CBOs, under the supervision of the district environment \nservice (Dinas Lingkungan Hidup) and with assistance from the environment specialist.  \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \n \nTable A14.3: Summary of Potential Impacts and Suggested Mitigation Measures \nPrototype Interventions  Potential Impacts  Suggested Mitigation Measures \nRehabilitation/renovation  During construction:   Proper construction planning;

Specific  subprojects  that  are  proposed  for  implementation  will  be  subjected  to \nenvironmental  screening,  and  an  IEE  (ANDAL)  will  be  conducted  for  those  subprojects \nclassified under Category B in line with government environmental assessment requirements \nand procedures. Environmental screening and IEE preparation will be the responsibility of the \nPMO and PIUs, with assistance from the environment specialist. The ANDAL reports will be \nsubmitted for approval to the respective district environment services in the five project districts. \n \n8.  Water quality monitoring forms will be designed by the environment specialist, and an \nenvironmental monitoring subsystem will be incorporated as a subsystem of the aquaculture \nmanagement information system (AMIS) to be designed and installed in DGA. The results of \nenvironmental monitoring done at the field level will be compiled at the PIUs and transmitted to \nDGA for storage and easy retrieval in the AMIS. As the PIUs will be linked to the central AMIS \ndatabase through a wide area network (WAN), data accessibility should not be a problem. \n \n9.  Environmental  Monitoring.  The  monitoring  program  will  determine  the  extent  of \nvariations in the levels of environmental indicators. Baseline conditions will be measured prior to \nthe  establishment  of  project  facilities  in  an  area.  The  regular  monitoring  program  will  be \nformulated  thereafter  with  the  baseline  conditions  serving  as  minimum  parameters  to  be \nmonitored to evaluate the effects of project activities. \n \n10.  Water quality monitoring will be conducted in (i) fishponds, supply and drainage canals, \nand  surrounding  areas;  (ii)  aquaculture  production  sites  in  freshwater,  brackishwater,  and \nmarine areas; and (iii) areas where water from fishponds, fish processing, and other village \nactivities is discharged. The following essential water quality parameters should be monitored, \nat least on a quarterly basis: (i) pH; (ii) dissolved oxygen; (iii) biochemical oxygen demand \n(BOD);  (iv)  nutrient  concentration  (nitrates,  nitrites,  ammonia,  phosphates);  (v)  suspended \nsolids; and (vi) organochlorine residues. In open waters, water samples should be collected \nregularly from sampling sites within the project area and examined  in the laboratory. The \nsampling frequency will vary with the type of operation. Analysis of water samples will be done \nwith water quality test kits provided by the Project to laboratories in the participating districts. \nPortable test kits will also be provided to local DKP technical personnel for routine monitoring of \nwater quality in the private sector hatcheries and growout farms. Water quality monitoring \nresults will be compared with both the official water quality standards established by the Menteri \nNegara Kepundudukan dan Lingkungan Hidup and the international water quality standards set \nby the World Health Organization. This is necessary to determine whether an indicator exceeds \nmaximum allowable levels. \n \nE.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n11.  In line with the participatory approach to project planning and preparation, numerous key \ninterviews, local-level consultations, focus group discussions, and national and local workshops \nwere organized and conducted at the five project sites between February and April 2004. These \nfocus  group  discussions  and  workshops  were  designed  to  determine  the  most  pressing \nconcerns of stakeholders and to obtain stakeholder input for consideration in project design. \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nEnvironmental issues and concerns figured prominently into the discussions and triggered the \nincorporation of environmental improvement measures in the project design. \n \nF.  Conclusions  \n \n12.  The initial examination of likely environmental impacts of the proposed Project showed \nthat  none  of  the  prototype  interventions  is  environmentally  critical  or  projected  to  create \nsignificant adverse or negative impacts on the environment. Only a few minor environmental \nimpacts are likely as a result of factors related to site selection, construction, and operation, but \nthese are small and avoidable or mitigable. Construction-related impacts are localized and \ntemporary in nature and could be minimized through careful planning and the adoption of proper \nconstruction practices. Some potential impacts related to the operation of mariculture and land-\nbased aquaculture facilities have been identified, but environmental safeguards have been built \ninto the project design to mitigate against these likely negative effects. \n \n13.  Overall,  the  Project  is  not  expected  to  result  in  significant  environmental  impacts. \nInstead,  the  Project  is  likely  to  bring  about  positive  benefits  in  the  form  of  (i)  increased \nproduction  of fish, shrimp, mollusks, and seaweeds through environment-friendly, sustainable \naquaculture; (ii) enhancement of natural stocks of fish and other valuable species, whose \npopulations have been overfished; (iii) improved quality of fish for human consumption; (iv) \nimproved health, hygiene, and environmental sanitation among local community residents at the \nfive project sites as a result of the provision of potable water and public toilets; and (v) greater \npublic  awareness  of  the  need  for  sustainable  aquaculture  and  environmental  protection. \nTherefore, the preparation of an environmental impact assessment is not required, and this IEE \ncould suffice for the purpose of this Project. \n \n14.  Nevertheless, environmental parameters should be included among the criteria used in \nthe selection of project sites. Environmental conditions at project sites should also be monitored \nat least quarterly to determine changes in the levels of essential environmental parameters. \nSharp changes could point to a need for remedial measures.
