The  persistence  of  these  has  worsened  the  poverty\nsituation  with  (i)  the  rise  in  the  number  of  poor  from  18  million  in\n1987/88 to 45 million in 1998/99 or 33 percent of the population, (ii)\nworsening \n(iii)  women  carrying  a\ndisproportionate share of the burden of poverty. Poverty reduction,\ntherefore,  is  central  to  the  Government\u2019s  economic  planning.  The\nmost obvious manifestation of poverty is low income resulting from\nlack of access to affordable financial services. Currently, less than\n5  percent  of  poor  households  have  access  to  affordable  financial\nservices  from  institutional  sources.  The  Government,  therefore,\nconsiders MF critical and integral to its poverty reduction efforts.\n\ninequality,  and \n\nThe  MF  sector  is  not  prominent  in  Pakistan.  The  potential  of\nincreasing  the  role  of  MF  in  poverty  reduction  by  enhancing  its\noutreach  is  constrained  by  (i)  lack  of  a  stated  policy,  legal,  and\nregulatory  framework  for  MF;  (ii)  few  microfinance  institutions\n(MFIs);  (iii)  absence  of  mechanisms  to  integrate  social  capital\nformation  with  MF  services;  and  (iv)  financial  and  organizational\nfinance\nproblems  of  commercial  banks  and  development \ninstitutions (DFIs).\n\nMarginalization of women, vulnerability of the poor, lack of skills for\neffective  utilization  of  financial  services,  and  inadequate  basic\ninfrastructure  facilities  inhibit  the  expansion  of  the  MF  sector.  The\nsupply of MF from informal sources is intermittent and reflects the\nweak bargaining power of the poor. The number of nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) that could specialize as MFIs are few.\n\nInvestments  to  enhance  the  supply  of  MF  services,  both  from\nprivate  and  public  sectors,  have  been  minimal  due  to  the\nperception of a limited market. Even households that have access\nto  MF  from  institutional  sources  are  not  assured  of  continuity  and\nquality  of  services  because  of  the  limited  resource  base  and\ninadequate  retail  capacity  of  MFIs.  To  address  the  issues  of\noutreach and sustainability in the context of increasing poverty, the\nGovernment  aims  to  develop  a  pro-poor  financial  system  that  will\nhave a significant poverty reduction impact.\n\n\fiii\n\nClassification\n\nPrimary Objective: Core poverty reduction\nSecondary Objective: Gender and development\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken\nand is summarized in an appendix.\n\nThe Sector Development Program\n\nObjectives and\nScope\n\nPolicy Framework\nand Actions\n\nCapacity Building\n\nThe Investment\nProject\n\nThe  key  objective  of  the  MSDP  is  to  reduce  poverty.  The  MSDP\nwill develop the MF sector to efficiently provide financial and social\nservices  to  the  poor.  MF  services,  provided  at  affordable  prices,\nwill  have  a  significant  poverty  reduction  impact  and  thereby  (i)\nincrease  incomes  of  poor  households;  (ii)  enhance  outreach,\nespecially to women; (iii) build social capital; and (iv) reduce risks\nfaced by the poor. The MSDP will initiate an integrated package of\npolicy  reforms,  institutional  development,  and  outreach  expansion\nto catalyze the growth of the MF sector.\n\nThe  agreed  policy  framework  and  actions  to  develop  the  sector\ninclude  (i)  adopting  an  enabling  policy  framework  for  MF  sector\ndevelopment;  (ii)  establishing  a  Microfinance  Bank  (MFB)  as  a\nprivate-public  enterprise  in  partnership  with  NGOs  to  catalyze\nsector  growth;  and  (iii)  putting  in  place  a  legislative,  supervisory,\nand regulatory framework to encourage more institutions to provide\nMF services.\n\nOther significant policy actions are (i) establishing mechanisms for\nenhancing  social  capital  through  community  mobilization  and\ncapacity  building \n(Microfinance  Social  Development  Fund,\n[MSDF]),  and  access  to  basic  community-based  infrastructure  for\npoor  households  (Community  Investment  Fund  [CIF]);  (ii)  piloting\nrisk  mitigation  mechanisms  for  the  poor  through  Risk  Mitigation\nFund  (RMF)  and  Deposit  Protection  Fund  (DPF);  and  (iii)\nrestructuring DFIs, i.e., closing the Federal Bank for Cooperatives\nand  initiating  reform  of  the  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of\nPakistan, both of which undermine MF sector growth.\n\nInstitutional strengthening support under the MSDP will (i) develop\nthe capacity of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the central bank,\nto take a proactive role in MF sector development; (ii) assist MFB\nin  establishing  operating  systems  and  procedures,  product  pricing\nand promotion, measures to improve participatory process in social\ntrain  members  of  community\nmobilization,  and \norganizations (COs); and (iv) assist new MFIs wishing to enter the\nMF market.\n\ntraining;  (iii) \n\nThe objective is to leverage policy framework actions and provide\nresources  for  a  significant  poverty  reduction  impact  by  increasing\nsubprojects  and\ninvestment \nemployment generation  among  the  poor.  Support  will  be  provided\nfor  (i)  outreach  expansion  (credit  line),  (ii)  social  capital  buildup,\n\nincome-generating \n\nsmall \n\nin \n\n\fiv\n\nand  (iii)  institutional  strengthening.  In  the  context  of  a  conducive\npolicy  framework,  these  will  catalyze  the  growth  of  the  MF  sector\nand attract investors and retailers.\n\nThe credit line will be supplemented by MFB equity, deposits, and\nborrowings  to  finance  the  investments  of  about  560,000  poor\nhouseholds  (about  4  million  people)  for  successive  cycles.  To\nsupport  this,  assistance  will  be  provided  to  MFB  for  product  and\nsystems  development,  capacity  building,  training,  and  equipment\nand  vehicles.  The \nthe\ntransformation of two NGOs into licensed MFIs.\n\nloan  will  also  support \n\ninvestment \n\nAbout  24,750  COs,  comprising  560,000  poor  households,  will  be\ndeveloped in a participatory manner through a network of NGOs as\nthe delivery point for financial services, and provided intensive and\nsustained support for capacity building. Nearly 40 percent of these\nwill  be  women  COs.  The  CO  activists  will  receive  training  on\ncommunity  mobilization  and  management;  capacity  enhancement\nof  the  poor;  and  leadership  skills.  In  addition,  about  4,500\nsubprojects for small-scale community-based infrastructure will be\nfinanced. MSDF and CIF will fund these investments.\n\nMembership in COs will facilitate access to MF and social services\nleading to greater social and economic empowerment of the poor.\nThese opportunities are especially significant for women who have\nhad  little  opportunity  to  interact  with  institutions  external  to  their\ncommunity.  The  involvement  of  COs  in  identifying,  planning,\nexecuting,  and  monitoring  physical  infrastructure  projects  will\nenhance  access  of  poor  communities  to  infrastructure  to  improve\ntheir  livelihoods  through  efficient  and  productive  use  of  local\nresources.  Through  their  participation  in  MF  service  delivery,\nNGOs will become more effective in working with communities; this\nwill  lead  to  opportunities  for  expansion  and  greater  impact  on\npoverty  reduction.  MFB  will  ensure  that  borrowers  are  aware  of\nenvironmental  issues,  and  that  these  are  satisfactorily  taken  into\naccount in the use of loan funds.\n\nBy addressing multiple dimensions of poverty, the MSDP will have\na significant and sustainable poverty reduction impact, during and\nbeyond  the  MSDP  duration.  The  development  of  a  conducive\npolicy  and  legal  framework  will  catalyze  private  investments  and\nprivate-public  synergies  for  augmenting  the  retail  capacity  for\noutreach.  The  promotion  of  a  lead  institution  such  as  MFB  will\ngenerate the momentum for the MF sector to grow and realize the\npotential  investments  and  institutional  diversity.  Partnerships  with\nNGOs for MF service delivery will spawn a countrywide movement\nto  enhance  MF  outreach  at  reduced  cost  to  the  poor.  At  full\nimplementation, MFB will provide access to nearly 9 percent of the\npoor  households  in  the  country,  with  prospects  for  services  to  be\nexpanded.

The loan will have a term of 24 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years. An interest of 1 percent per annum will be\ncharged  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\n\nThe loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $50\nmillion  will  be  released  on  loan  effectiveness  and  the  second\ntranche  of  $20  million  ewithin  24  months  from  the  first  tranche\nrelease, subject to compliance with conditions for its release.\n\nSBP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will  coordinate  with  the\nMinistry  of  Finance  on  policy  reforms.  A  project  management  unit\nwill  be  established  at  SBP  headquarters  in  Karachi.  SBP  has\ncreated a Microfinance Support Division comprising a Microfinance\nPolicy  Unit,  and  a  Consultative  Group  of  major  stakeholders  for\nwider consultation on MF-related issues.\n\nProcurement\n\nLoan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost,\nexcluding duties and taxes of imports. A negative list will apply.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\nCounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loan  will  be  placed  as  the\nGovernment\u2019s contribution to MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF.\n\nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $80  million  equivalent  from  its  Special\nFunds resources. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years. An interest of 1 percent per annum will be\ncharged  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\n\nThe  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation  is  preparing  a\nfeasibility study in consultation with ADB to strengthen the capacity\nof  SBP.  The  Department  for  International  Development  of  United\nKingdom  is  considering  providing  support  for  MFB  capacity\nbuilding.\n\nImplementation\nArrangements and\nExecuting Agency\n\nSBP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  A  project  implementation  unit\nwill be established in MFB to manage implementation and provide\nrequired reports concerning the delivery and use of inputs.\n\nProcurement and\nConsulting Services\n\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Expenditure procedures will be\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\n\n\fTime Frame\n\nThe  investment  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  with\ncompletion expected by 31 December 2006.\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\nvi\n\nConsultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will\nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants.  A  total  of  66  person-months  of  international  and  37\nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  inputs  will  be  required  for\nimplementation.\n\nThe  risks  for  the  policy  framework  actions  relate  to  slower  than\nexpected reforms and the possibility of political interference in the\nbusiness decisions of MFB and MFIs. Policy dialogue, stakeholder\ncoordination,  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms,  and\ncapacity  building  support  are  effective  safeguards.  Autonomy  and\ngood corporate governance of MFB is ensured by the provisions in\nthe  MFB \nstatute,  ownership  pattern,  and  professional\nmanagement.\n\nThe  major  risks  for  the  investment  Project  are  (i)  low  growth  in\nincome  of  the  poor,  (ii)  marginalization  of  women,  (iii)  dilution  of\npoverty  focus,  and  (iv)  inadequate  capacity  of  MFB  leading  to\nimplementation  delays.  In  addition  to  increased  economic  growth\nand pro-poor planning by the Government, the effective safeguards\nare  (i)  mainstreaming  of  gender  in  organization,  products,  and\nincluding\n(ii)  adoption  of  successful  practices \nservices; \npartnerships  with  NGOs  and  COs  for  effective  poverty  targeting;\nand (iii) significant investment in capacity building.\n\n\f~\n\n63000'E\n\n73000'~\n\nvii\n\n35000'N\n\n~ \n\nInitial  Project  Area\n\n35000'N\n\nPAKISTAN\n\nMICROFINANCE \n\nSECTOR\n\nDEVELOPMENT \n\nPROGRAM\n\n0\n\n50 \n\n100\n\n200\n\nKilometers\n\n@ \n\n@ \n\nNational  Capital\n\nProvincial  Capital\n\n.City/Town\n\n-c::::.. \n\nRiver\n\nDistrict  Boundary\n\nProvincial \n\nBoundary\n\nInternationai \n\nBoundary\n\nBoundaries \n\nare  not  necessarily \n\nauthoritative\n\n-;=-\n\n\"\n\n.\n\n(\n\n.'0-' \n/\n\n,~\n\n.cnitral\n\n'\\(:' \n\n-: \n\n-~' \n\n\"\n\nCir\",\"' \n.,\n\nr. \n.~.EST \n\nyN \n\n:  Casu. \n, \n\n/\n\n~\":\n\n[\n\nNORTH \n\n7RQc,t'-!!.'\u00a3H\n\n'.. \n\n\"  Saidu SharifrSatgram\"\n\n,! \n\\'Malakand~..-i  MaAsehrai\n\\  .' \n, \n\n\",. \nCh;'...'ddaYMartfar. \"  ~ \n'.'\n\nI\"r \n\n.\n\nI \n.,\n., \n\n,.\"\n\nPeshawar-\n\n!, \n\n; \n\n...\\j{a \n\n, \n\n) \n\nHan1'~.\\  Ko.at.,  Gujar \n\nI' \n\n:e\\.\"., ~.';;c \na. \n\n.\nYRiiwalplr1di \n\nk \nra., \n\n:(  ~ ./  ,,(~'c\"'. \n\n\" \n\nchakWaI \n\nMangJ.I Dam\n:.\n\nFederally  Adir1inisrered \n\nBan,{~j \n\n-:~  (C\n.ianwali \n--\\\n\n~kk \n\n.\". \n\n-..~~~~~\\\" \n\\ \n\" \n-.\n/ \n\\\n\nTribarfrea \n\n-I.~\n\n., \n\n..,,: \n\n, \n., \n\nI, \n.I\n.-, \n..Khan \n' \n\n...' \n\n~\n\nera \n\n.~k~.\nI\nsmal \n\n.\n\n1 I\n.-\n\n-',\n\n~-\n\n\\.,\n-\",0..0\n\nZhot \n\n\\,-.7':\n-! \n\n.;.- \nM.K  Bazar  1./ ~ \" \n\n.~:. \n\n~I~t:-.  :1\n..\n\nSialkot 1 ...\n\n.\nranwala \n\nNaiowal\n..\n, \n\n.\n\n(.1\n\n.-'\n\n.ura  /.'\n\n;I'@~ahOre\n)\n.\n..~L\n.;\n\nsur \n\n/.j-\n\nr\n\n...\n,'..\n\n\"\n\nChamman!\n\n.\n\n(Pishin\n\n.\n\n,c\n\n'. \n\n,\"' \n\nl- \ni \n,Quetta\n:' \n\n\"'-'@\n,-\"  :\"\n\n../.-c.;.-:,~\"i'~~%$;: \n\n.~arat\n\nLoratai ., \n\nDela GI1azI\n\n:..j(~hi~~B~k~an \n\n!..;,. \n\n~.~ \n\n~.~.-.~:.\n\nNushk\n\n.\n\nMastung \n' \n\nDadhar\n\n.\n\nSibi\n\n.\n\n, \n\n,;:~b1fj~ \n\n:\n\nI\\alat\n\n, \n\n\" \n'DMJ \nJhal~\"a2~i -,  I~'=-\"':;..;... \n\naJ\"\n\nCera Buqt:\n\n/\n\n.\n\ni~,\nc~\n,~:-\n\n\\-.:;~i1~\n\nKharan\n\nBALOCHISTAN\n\nKhuzaar\n\n'.--A\n\n, \n,;, \n\n'-.\nPanjgur\n\n25000'N\n\n~\n\n~ \n\n-\n\n,-\n\n.'\n\n~\n\n~\n\n,\n\n-,\n\n'.\n\n/\" \n\nb-\n\n) \n\n.\n\n..Sanghar \n\nKara\n\nPo\n\nARABIA!-.\n\nSEA\n\n,.-.I\n\n-0?\"\n\notki \n\n\"7\nI\n\n-.i\n,  /'\n,;.\n\n.,\n\nI\ni\n--'~-,---;\n\n(\n,\n,-,\n\nc' \n: \n, \n\n\\-.~.\n\nI\nUmarkot  ,\n\n.Mithi\n\n\",-..\n\n'\".  \"\n\n;r\n\n63000'E\n\n73oOO'eo\n\n2So00'N\n\n00.2784 HR\n\n\f1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on two proposed\nloans  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Program\n(MSDP).\n\nI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe number of poor people in Pakistan more than doubled during the 1990s. Nearly 33\n2.\npercent  of  the  population  is  classified  as  poor.1  The  incidence  of  poverty  will  continue  to\nincrease  if  economic  performance  does  not  improve,  directed  poverty  reduction  interventions\nare not enhanced, and delivery of pro-poor services not improved. Therefore, the Government\nhas  made  poverty  reduction  its  prime  objective  and  identified  microfinance  (MF)  as  a  critical\nelement of its poverty reduction strategy.\n\n3.\nThe  Government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  consider  financing\nan MF project to provide financial services to the poor and to establish microfinance institutions\n(MFIs)2  to  provide  access  to  affordable  MF  services  to  a  majority  of  the  poor.  In  December\n1997, ADB approved a technical assistance (TA)3 to help the Government prepare the project.\nThe  consultant  submitted  the  final  report  in  December  1999  and  a  series  of  consultations\nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB  followed  on  the  concept,  design,  and  components  of  the\nproposed  project.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Pakistan  in  June  2000  to  review  the  MF\nsector  to  develop  an  integrated  package4  of  policy  reforms,  institutional  development,  and\ncapacity  building  to  catalyze  the  growth  of  the  MF  sector  in  consultation  with  government\nagencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and funding agencies. A sector development\napproach  was  identified  as  the  most  effective  way  to  address  the  policy,  investment,  and\ncapacity  building  needs  in  a  systematic  manner  to  build  a  pro-poor  financial  system.  The\nAppraisal Mission5 visited Pakistan during 7-25 August 2000 to enhance the scope of the MSDP\nand firm up the implementation arrangements. The Government\u2019s development policy letter and\nthe  policy  matrix,  presented  in  Appendix  1,  summarize  the  understandings  reached  by  the\nMission. The program framework is shown in Appendix 2, and sector indicators in Appendix 3.\n\nThe Mission worked closely with stakeholders when designing the MSDP. Of particular\n4.\nsignificance  is  the  coordination  with  and  involvement  of  NGOs,  especially  the  microfinance\ngroup (MF Group),6 a network of NGOs active in MF, in the (i) design of the MSDP, (ii) direction\nof expected reforms, and (iii) partnership for outreach expansion. The institutional aspirations of\nNGOs,  their  concept  of  the  requirements  of  the  poor,  especially  poor  women,  and  the\nmethodology to deliver services are central to the design of the MSDP. ADB has consulted with\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank when formulating the MSDP. Discussions\non  possible  parallel  financing  were  undertaken  with  the  Swiss  Agency  for  Development\n\n                  \n\n1 The poverty line in Pakistan is derived on the basis of income that can provide daily intake of 2,250 calories per\n\nperson (2,450 calories per adult in rural areas and 2,150 in urban areas).\n\n2    Institutions  whose  major  business  is  the  provision  of  MF  services.  These  could  be  formal  institutions  or\n\nnongovernment organizations.\n\n3 TA 2937-PAK: Pakistan Rural Microfinance Project, for $600,000, approved on 12 December 1997.\n4 The reform package was developed from the analysis and recommendations of several sector studies, including\n(i) TA 5836: Consultations on Bank\u2019s Microfinance Strategy: In-Country Consultation, for $400,000, approved on 1\nMarch 1999; (ii) Asian Development Bank. 2000.

The persistence of these factors has\nworsened the poverty situation. Economic sanctions compounded long-standing socioeconomic\ndifficulties.  Erosion  of  investor  confidence  in  the  latter  part  of  1998,  the  virtual  cessation  of\nprivate  capital  flows,  and  the  suspension  of  new  official  development  assistance  affected\neconomic growth. The trade deficit grew sharply, foreign exchange reserves were less than two\nmonths of imports, and total foreign debt stood at $30 billion at the end of June 1999.\n\nThe  structural  reforms  undertaken  by  the  Government  have  resulted  in  real  gross\n6.\ndomestic product (GDP) growth of 4.5 percent during FY2000 as against 3.2 percent in FY1999.\nThe Government has indicated its willingness to speed up the pace of structural reforms to meet\nthe  major  challenges  of  (i)  reducing  poverty,  (ii)  improving  governance  and  administration,  (iii)\nimproving  the  fiscal  and  balance  of  payments  positions,  (iv)  restoring  investor  confidence,  (v)\nachieving  higher  growth  on  a  sustainable  basis,  and  (vi)  improving  social  indicators.  To  assist\nthe  Government\u2019s  reform  efforts  and  to  provide  balance  of  payments  support,  a  stand-by\narrangement amounting to $1.5 billion is expected to be approved by the International Monetary\nFund  in  November  2000.  Discussions  are  ongoing  for  a  comprehensive  multiyear  package\nunder the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility, which is expected to be concluded in the first half\nof 2001. The rescheduling of official debt under the Paris Club is expected in early 2001. The\nWorld Bank is processing a structural adjustment loan of $350 million for possible approval by\nmiddle  of  2001.  The  reform  agenda  includes  structural  changes  in  major  economic  sectors,\nfiscal reforms, provincial finance reforms, judicial reforms, and private sector development. ADB\nis supporting legal and judicial reforms, among others.\n\nB.\n\nSector Description and Recent Performance\n\n1.\n\nOverview\n\nThe  institutional  structure  of  the  financial  system  in  Pakistan  is  elaborate.  The  State\n7.\nBank  of  Pakistan  (SBP),  the  central  bank,  manages  and  executes  monetary,  credit,  interest\nrate,  and  foreign  exchange  policies,  and  is  the  sole  prudential  regulator  for  all  deposit-taking\ninstitutions.  SBP  oversees  21  domestic  scheduled  commercial  banks  (CBs)  of  which  4  are\nstate-owned, 21 foreign banks, 4 specialized banks, 11 development finance institutions (DFIs),\n16  investment  banks,  3  discount  and  guarantee  houses,  4  housing  finance  companies,  and  2\njoint  venture  companies.  State-owned  CBs  hold  almost  60  percent  of  the  total  assets  of  the\nfinancial  institutions  and  have  primarily  financed  working  capital.  The  DFIs  hold  about  11\npercent of the total assets and have provided term finance to industry, and both term and short-\nterm  finance  for  agriculture.  Other  financial  institutions  such  as  leasing  companies  and\ninvestment banks together account for barely 5 percent of the banking system\u2019s assets. Among\nthe  financial  institutions,  6  CBs  and  2  DFIs  have  a  limited  MF  portfolio.  The  MF  market  is\nessentially served by NGOs, and informal arrangements by agricultural traders, input suppliers,\nmoneylenders, and landlords, especially in rural areas.\n\n\f3\n\nInstitutional  MF7  is  a  recent  development  in  Pakistan  and,  therefore,  has  a  very  limited\n8.\noutreach.  However,  the  poverty  reduction  potential  of  MF  is  widely  recognized  at  the  policy-\nmaking  level  and  among  the  development  community.  In  the  economic  and  social  context  of\nPakistan,  MF  is  understood  to  comprise  financial  services,  particularly  savings  and  credit,  for\nthe  poor  with  a  significant  degree  of  social  intermediation.  This  involves  improving  the  social\ncondition  of  the  poor  who  have  been  largely  excluded  from  access  to  financial  and  social\nservices,  and  includes  community  mobilization,  skills  development,  risk  mitigation,  and  access\nto  basic  infrastructure.  Initial  savings  up  to  PRs2,000  ($35)  and  a  first  time  loan  of  about\nPRs16,540 ($295)8 are generally considered as MF.\n\n9.\nPolicies  and  guidelines  governing  the  financial  system  and  the  framework  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy influence the MF sector. The environment for MF has\nimproved with the recognition that MF is critical to poverty reduction and NGOs can be effective\ndevelopment partners to enhance the quality of service through participatory community-based\napproaches. NGOs can attain legal status, and are eligible to receive resources from aid-funded\nprojects, Government-funded projects, and from projects where the Government has borrowed\nfrom funding agencies.\n\n2.\n\nClients and Client Characteristics\n\nAs of June 1999, Pakistan\u2019s population was estimated at 134.5 million. Two thirds of the\n10.\npopulation live in rural areas. The number of poor is estimated at 45 million (33 percent of the\npopulation)  in  6.3  million  households.9  Of  the  poor,  33  million,  representing  4.7  million\nhouseholds  live  in  rural  areas.  All  poor  households  are  potential  clients  for  both  financial  and\nnonfinancial  social  services.  Government  considers  half  the  adult  poor  population  (nearly  10\nmillion) as potential MF clients. Among this client base, women bear a disproportionately high\nshare of the burden of poverty due to (i) low social status, (ii) lesser endowments of land and\nproductive  assets,  (iii)  limited  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  social  services,  and  (iv)\nrestricted  mobility.  Women  are  poorer,  less  healthy,  and  less  educated  than  men.  These\ndifferences are more pronounced in rural areas (Appendix 4). Even though economically active,\nthe contribution of women is inadequately documented, understood, and appreciated.\n\nIn  urban  areas,  the  poor  include  vendors,  small  traders,  and  laborers  in  the  service,\n11.\ntransport,  and  small  industry  sectors.  The  four  categories  of  primary  rural  occupations  are:\nlandowners,  sharecropper-tenants,  rural  artisans,  and  landless  laborers.  Sharecropper-tenants\nare  among  the  poorest.  Bonded  labor  is  common  among  this  group.  Artisans,  the  traditional\nservice  providers  to  the  rural  community  (e.g.,  blacksmiths,  carpenters,  weavers,  barbers,\ntailors) are mostly poor. Landless laborers are among the poorest of the poor.\n\n12.\nFifty-two percent of rural income is generated outside agriculture. Reliance on secondary\noccupations  is  increasing  as  agriculture  can  no  longer  meet  the  income  needs  of  the  growing\nrural  population  and  subsistence  agriculture  cannot  absorb  the  labor  surplus.  These\noccupations include (i) paid employment, (ii) investments in small businesses, (iii) diversification\ninto  related  occupations  where  possible  (i.e.,  blacksmiths  who  undertake  all  forms  of  metal\nwork), (iv) employment outside the  community, and (v) migration to urban areas (estimated at\n1.3 percent per annum). However, because of limited education and skills, sharecroppers and\n\n                  \n\n7 \n\nInstitutional MF is defined to include MF services provided by both formal (banks, cooperatives) and semi-formal\n(NGOs) institutions.\n\n8  A loan size equal to half of the per capita GDP is often considered as a proxy for microcredit. A lower loan size\n\nalso ensures a greater depth of outreach (to the poorest among the poor).\n\n9  Estimates based on average 7 members per household.\n\n\f4\n\nlandless  laborers  have  fewer  options  other  than  to  provide  domestic  services,  and  make  and\nsell handicrafts and toys.\n\n13.\nThe  typical  client  profile  of  a  poor  woman  who  seeks  MF  services  is  a  woman  in  her\nearly 30s, who never attended school. She lives with her husband and three children, his elderly\nmother, and his younger brother\u2019s family. One child is a daughter who is engaged to be married,\nand her other two children are boys; the older son will start middle school in the district center\nthis year, so funds are not available for the younger to stay in school any longer. She helps her\nhusband for several hours a day on the family\u2019s two small fields plus the land they lease from\nthe  landlord  during  most  of  the  year.  All  of  her  chickens  died  recently  when  a  disease  swept\nthrough  the  area.  She  shares  responsibility  for  cooking,  cleaning,  and  caring  for  others  in  the\nhome with her sister-in-law. She dreams of replacing her hens and buying a buffalo that would\nproduce milk for sale, so that she can help her daughter marry, try to send her son to school,\nand keep the family from having to borrow money from the landlord, which might lead to their\nlosing their remaining land.\n\n3.\n\nMicrofinance and the Poor\n\na. \n\nDemand\n\nThe  average  size  of  loan  taken  by  poor  households  from  NGOs  is  about  PRs16,540\n14.\n($295)  at  an  interest  rate  of  18-20  percent  per  annum.  Considering  these,  the  estimated\npotential demand for microcredit is about $2 billion10 based on the number of poor households\n(6.3 million) or about $3 billion based on half the adult poor population (10 million). Similarly, the\nestimates of deposit possibilities range from $225 million to $350 million per annum. Based on\npopulation distribution, two thirds of this demand is considered to emanate from the rural poor.\nIn MF projects implemented by NGOs in Pakistan, the depositors outnumber borrowers by 2-4\ntimes. The poor emphasize the safety and accessibility of savings facilities as many have lost\ntheir savings in the past due to failures of cooperatives and finance companies.\n\n15.\nMost  of  the  demand  for  MF  in  rural  areas  is  for  agriculture  production  (50  percent),\nlivestock (25 percent), and the balance for other household-based income-generating activities\n(IGAs). In urban areas, most of the demand is for small business and self-employed ventures.\nHouseholds are extended families and the pool of labor within a family unit creates the potential\nfor  a  diverse  range  of  income-earning  opportunities.  Demand  attributes  include  (i)  small  and\nfrequent loans; (ii) terms compatible with the nature of activity; (iii) preference of women, due to\nrestricted  mobility,  for  simple  and  speedy  delivery  mechanisms  placed  within  the  community;\nand (iv) significant and sustained social preparation to familiarize the poor with managing IGAs.\nInterest rate sensitivity is high in rural areas due to the general low level of economic activity.\nThe  apprehension  of  becoming  indebted,  particularly  among  women,  due  to  failed  enterprises\n(e.g., death of livestock, failure of business, crop failures) is widespread.\n\nb.\n\nSupply\n\nIf the supply of MF services was adequate, the MF sector would be the largest sector of\n16.\nthe financial system in terms of clientele base. Overall, the MF market is underdeveloped with\nan  institutional  outreach  of  about  200,000  (60,000  NGOs,  140,000  CBs  and  DFIs)11  for\n\n                  \n\nsubsequent loan cycles.\n\n10 From  this  base,  the  annual  incremental  credit  requirement  would  be  $200  million  representing  larger  loans  in\n\n11 CBs and DFIs, though included, provide loans 4-5 times the size of microcredit and not necessarily to the poor.\n\n\f5\n\nmicrocredit  loans.  This  is  about  3  percent  of  poor  households.  The  CBs  hold  about  417,000\nsavings  accounts  deposited  by  NGOs  on  behalf  of  their  members.  One  private  sector  leasing\ncompany has initiated a leasing service to provide assets for hire to poor households. Insurance\nto  mitigate  the  risks  for  the  poor  does  not  exist.  The  National  Rural  Support  Program  (NRSP)\nand  other  members  of  the  MF  Group  provide  demand-based  customized  training  on  MF.\nTraining skills for social intermediation, though developed, is grossly underfunded.\n\n4. \n\nFinancial Sector Reforms and Microfinance\n\n17.\nThe  Government  considers  an  efficient  financial  system  necessary  for  macroeconomic\nstability.  Therefore,  the  banking  system  is  being  strengthened12  by  (i)  fundamentally  changing\nnorms for governance; (ii) restructuring to conserve assets, downsizing staff and branches, and\nreducing bad debts; (iii) implementing debt recovery measures; (iv) strengthening the prudential\nand supervisory framework; (v) improving legal and judicial enforcement of banking courts; and\n(vi) privatizing all but one state-owned CB. SBP has been empowered in all matters concerning\nmonetary  and  banking  policies,  as  well  as  for  governance  and  management  of  the  financial\ninstitutions.  These  reforms  are  to  be  extended  to  the  DFIs.  The  Government  plans  to\nrestructure, recapitalize, downsize, and privatize the DFIs. Interest rates were deregulated and\nloans up to PRs100,000 ($1,785) are not required to be collateralized. In general, the reforms\nconstitute  a  positive  financial  environment.  Restoring  SBP\u2019s  authority  in  banking  supervision\nand greater transparency requirements have significantly strengthened good governance.\n\nComplementing these reforms, the ADB-funded Capital Market Development Program13\n18.\naims  to  accelerate  the  mobilization  of  long-term  resources  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  its\nallocation through a diversified and competitive capital market. The major developments include\n(i)  establishment  of  a  central  depository  system,  (ii)  automation  of  stock  exchanges,  and  (iii)\nestablishment  of  credit  rating  agencies.  New  laws  have  been  promulgated  to  prohibit  insider\ntrading,  regulate  stock  exchange  members,  and  offer  stock  options  to  employees.  The\nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  of  Pakistan  is  being  strengthened.  Reform  agenda\nincludes establishing a national clearing and settlement system, broadening the capital market\nbase by linking smaller cities, and developing internet-based trading.\n\nThe banking reforms have not been extended to cover the specific needs of MF, which\n19.\ninclude (i) a conducive policy to encourage emergence of MFIs as depository institutions;14 (ii)\ncorresponding creation of a supervisory and regulatory system for orderly sector development;\n(iii)  flexibility  to  adopt  practices  and  procedures  for  banking  with  the  poor,  such  as  mobile\nbanking and group collateral; (iv) free limit to accumulate a noncollateralized loan portfolio; and\n(v)  insulation  from  political  interference.  The  MF  sector  can  seamlessly  integrate  with  the\nbroader financial sector if these are addressed.\n\n5.\n\nSuppliers of Microfinance\n\n20.\nThe  suppliers  of  MF  services  are  (i)  informal  reciprocal  arrangements;  (ii)  semiformal\nsources  such  as  NGOs,  the  Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund  (PPAF),  and  Government-\nsponsored programs; and (iii) formal sources such as DFIs and CBs.\n\n                  \n\n12 Supported by the Banking Sector Adjustment Loan of World Bank.\n13 Loan 1576-PAK: Capital Market Development Program, for $250 million, approved on 6 November 1997.\n14 The  entry  threshold  of  PRs500  million  ($9  million)  is  high  for  MFIs  aspiring  to  become  licensed  depository\n\ninstitutions.\n\n\f6\n\na.\n\nInformal Sources\n\n21.\nInformal  sources  account  for  about  83  percent  of  the  credit  supply.  Three  principal\ninformal sources of credit are (i) commercially based credit linked with marketing intermediaries,\ncommission  agents,  village  traders,  and  shopkeepers;  (ii)  land-based  credit  arrangement\nextended  by  landlords  to  farmers  for  inputs  and  to  meet  consumption  needs;  and  (iii)  socially\nbased arrangements of friends and family (the most numerous). Money lending as a specialized\noccupation is not significant and gradually declining. Informal sources, both in rural and urban\nareas,  mainly  supply  short-term  credit  at  terms  that  reflect  the  weak  bargaining  power  of  the\npoor,  particularly  for  land-based  credit  arrangements.  Every  village  has  one  or  more  informal\ncommittees that collect regular savings and make loans to members. These operate like rotating\nsavings  and  credit  organizations.  Informal  credit  based  on  reciprocity  and  social  obligations\nmainly  fund  urgent  consumption  needs  without  any  interest  charges.  However,  these  are\nintermittent and tend to be less than PRs1,000 ($18).\n\nb.\n\nSemiformal Sources\n\n22.\nThe number of registered NGOs is estimated at 8,000 to 16,000, two thirds of which are\nin  urban  areas  in  inverse  relation  to  population  and  poverty  distribution.  Most  rural  NGOs  are\nsingle community or village-based groups registered as community-based organizations. Of the\n100 that seem to supply some MF, only half have outreach beyond the immediate community.\nThe  nine  members  of  the  MF  Group  are  considered  to  have  substantive  interest  in  MF.  The\nNGOs providing MF can be broadly classified into three categories:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMultisectoral  NGOs.  Engaged  in  a  variety  of  services:  education,  health,\ninfrastructure, and community development. These NGOs offer microcredit as a\nminor program component. MF is mostly funded by aid agencies.\n\nNGOs with MF as core activity. Kashf Foundation and the Orangi Pilot Project\nhave  MF  as  their  main  function;  their  combined  outreach  is  about  3,000  active\nborrowers.\n\nRural  support  programs  (RSPs).  RSPs  were  established  by  the  Government\nas independent nonprofit organizations. Of the nine RSPs,15 NRSP is the largest\n(Appendix 5) with nationwide coverage. Some RSPs have received endowments\nfrom  the  Government  and  funding  agencies.  RSPs  undertake  the  formation  of\ncommunity  organizations  (COs)  as  the  building  blocks  of  their  participatory\nholistic rural development model. The COs (self-help groups, village groups, and\nwomen groups) are the means to organize communities, create awareness, build\ncapacity, develop human resources, and instill credit discipline. Services include\n(a)  construction  of  productive  community  infrastructure,  (b)  microcredit,  (c)\nagriculture  extension,  and  (d)  training.  These  also  serve  as  incentives  for\ncommunities to organize. RSPs have formed 16,295 COs with a total of 446,820\nmembers in 55 districts, trained 107,024 social organizers, and undertaken 5,114\nphysical infrastructure schemes.\n\n23.\nGenerally, MF operations of NGOs are sensitive to the demand profile and social needs\nof the poor, and provide services in a participatory manner. The published combined outreach of\n\n15 The  major  regional  RSPs  are  the  Punjab  RSP,  Sarhad  Rural  Support  Corporation,  and  the  Balochistan  RSP,\n\n                  \n\nalthough the latter is almost dormant.\n\n\f7\n\nmembers of the MF Group is 61,400 borrowers with aggregate loans outstanding of PRs1 billion\n($18  million),  and  417,000  depositors  with  savings  of  PRs685  million  ($12  million).  Women\nborrowers  account  for  11  percent  of  the  total,  even  though  women\u2019s  groups  represent  25\npercent of COs. The RSPs account for nearly 95 percent of NGO outreach.\n\n24.\nNGOs  deliver  MF  services  through  group-based  methodology,  more  commonly  known\nas  the  Grameen  Bank  (Bangladesh)  model  with  adaptations  to  suit  the  local  context.  The\nprevalent  MF  delivery  model  includes  (i)  CO  formation;  (ii)  social  preparation  for  the  poor,\nincluding  numeracy  and  skills  training;  (iii)  regular  meeting  of  COs;  (iv)  savings  mobilization16\nand  loan  disbursement  after  the  approval  of  a  majority  of  members;  and  (v)  peer  pressure  to\nensure proper credit behavior. Loans of $45-$1,250 (PRs2,520-PRs70,000) are given for terms\nranging from 3 months to 2 years, and repayments are usually monthly or quarterly. Incentives\nfor repayments are common. Individual loans are also provided in some cases. Pricing of loans\nare  in  terms  of  markup17  over  the  principal  at  18-20  percent.  This  is  above  the  CB  markup\ncharges, but below the transaction cost and expenses incurred for social intermediation. Some\nNGOs  charge  up  to  48  percent.  Most  NGOs  are  unable  to  meet  their  costs,  and  use  grant\nsupport  to  bridge their income  gap.  Loan repayments are reportedly high (90 to 97 percent of\ndemand) in most cases.\n\n25.\nThe Government established PPAF in 1997, with an endowment of PRs500 million ($9\nmillion),  as  an  apex  institution  to  help  the  poor.  PPAF  plans  to  provide  MF  services  primarily\nthrough  NGOs  to  an  estimated  200,000  households  over  the  next  4  years.  Outreach  is  lower\nthan expected, as most NGOs need to be reoriented as  MF service providers.\n\nCredit  components  in  Government-sponsored  programs18  are  not  microcredit  either  by\n26.\nsize, mode of delivery, or terms of credit. The overall impact has been minimal as the services\nhave been presented, promoted, and delivered in a manner that suggests a politically motivated\ngrant  facility  and  has  been  so  understood  by  those  privileged  to  have  access.  The  budgetary\nsupport for such programs has either been curtailed or discontinued.\n\n \n\nc. \n\nFormal Sources\n\nThe  Federal  Bank  for  Cooperatives  (FBC)  is  an  apex  organization  for  six  provincial\n27.\ncooperative banks. Of the 66,000 primary societies, 30,000 are active, with a membership of 3.5\nmillion.  They  had  outstanding  loans  totaling  PRs5  billion  ($89  million)  at  the  end  of  1998  in\n58,000  borrower  accounts  averaging  PRs86,200  ($1,540)  per  account;  27,369  loan  accounts\nwere  for  PRs25,000  ($445)  or  less.  While  these  are  small  loans,  the  loan  terms  and  delivery\nmethodology exclude access by the poor, particularly poor women. Loans are secured against\nmortgages on agricultural land and the dominant land-owning class captures most of the loans.\n\nThe  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of  Pakistan  (ADBP)  provides  two  thirds  of  the\n28.\nagricultural credit available in the country through its 49 regional offices, 349 branch offices, and\nmobile credit offices. During 1998/99, ADBP disbursed PRs30 billion ($535 million) to 451,992\nborrowers or 9 percent of the total 5.1 million farmers. Lending is collateral based. ADBP does\nnot  cater  to  the  poor  except  under  special  programss.  Of  the  0.953  million  landless  farmers,\n\n                  \n16 Deposited in CB, as NGOs are not depository institutions.\n17    As required under Islamic banking.

These are patterned on NGOs and almost entirely restricted to urban\nareas.  CBs  have  generally  regarded  MF  as  a  social  obligation  to  be  cross-subsidized  by\ncommercial operations.\n\nC.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n30. With an outreach of less than 5 percent of poor households, affordable MF services are\nnot available to the majority of the poor; thus they are unable to participate in the local economy.\nThe outreach of the NGOs is expected to grow to 400,000 households (currently about 60,000)\nby the end of 2004.20 Therefore, in the absence of complementary or alternative arrangements,\nthe  MF  market  will  remain  grossly  underserved,  and  its  poverty  reduction  potential  largely\nunrealized in the medium to long term. For this potential to be realized, the following constraints\nand issues must be addressed.\n\n1.\n\nSocial\n\na.\n\nInadequate Access of the Poor to Services\n\n31.\nInadequate  access  to  productive  resources  and  social  services  has  resulted  in  low\nindicators of well-being and lack of employment opportunities. This situation is compounded in\nrural  areas  where  access  is  even  more  difficult  due  to  inadequate  or  complete  lack  of  basic\ninfrastructure. Low skill level and absence of support for human resource development for the\npoor  prevents  them  from  diversifying  their  household  income.  Government  interventions  have\nnot  yielded  the  desired  impact  due  to  inadequate  emphasis  on  community-based  participatory\napproaches.  Resource  availability  relative  to  the  requirements  for  the  social  sectors  is  low.\nMuch  of  the  investment  required  is  for  public  services  where  private  sector  investments  are\nunlikely. Without these services, MF will have less than the intended impact.\n\nb.\n\nObstacles for Microfinance Outreach to Women\n\n32.\nSocial intermediation costs to enhance women\u2019s access to MF are significantly higher in\nPakistan  as  constraints  on  mobility,  social  interaction,  and  skills  development  must  be\naddressed on a sustained basis. Although returns from social intermediation in terms of social\ncapital  and  demonstrative  effects  are  high,  investments  are  limited  due  to  high  cost.\nConsequently,  the  gender  orientation  of  organizations,  products,  and  delivery  mechanisms  is\ninsufficient  to  enhance  outreach  to  women.  Inadequate  social  preparation  adversely  affects\ngroup cohesion, the quality of loan portfolio, and ultimately the sustainability of MF operations.\n\nc.\n\nAbsence of Risk Mitigation Measures\n\n33.\nThe disadvantages of the poor households include lack of access to financial services,\nunfair  terms  of  participation  in  the  local  economy,  and  vulnerability  to  economic  and  physical\ndownturns.  Poor  households  forego  potentially  viable  technologies,  production  choices,  and\n\n                  \n\n19 ADBP has 153,413 loan accounts of PRs25,000 ($445) or less; many of these are doubtful debts.\n20  Including the projected outreach through PPAF assistance.\n\n\f9\n\nincome opportunities due to risk aversion. Mechanisms to mitigate such risks are not available.\nIn addition, the poor have no means to secure the safety of their savings, unless deposited with\nCBs, to which the poor have little access.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial\n\na.\n\nMicrofinance-Specific Policy Framework\n\nIn  the  early  stages  of  MF  sector  development,  a  conducive  policy  environment  is\n34.\nrequired to encourage innovations and to allow a diverse set of institutions to provide a range of\nservices,  particularly  savings,  in  a  supervised  and  regulated  environment.  The  required  policy\nattributes  include  (i)  promotion  of  institutions  that  can  target  the  poor  with  adequate  gender\nemphasis, (ii) acceptance of individuals as well as groups of individuals for MF transactions, (iii)\nmechanisms to ensure that social intermediation precedes and accompanies MF services, (iv)\nsignificant  investments  in  social  intermediation,  (v)  pro-poor  financial  innovations  such  as\nmeasures  to  mitigate  risks  faced  by  the  poor,  (vi)  realizing  public-private  sector  synergy,  (vii)\nautonomy  in  pricing  and  client  selection,  (viii)  measures  to  integrate  MF  with  the  financial\nsystem (para.19), and (ix) proactive role of SBP in developing the MF sector.\n\nb.\n\nInstitutional Limitations\n\n35.\nThe  financial  reforms  have  put  in  place  a  policy  framework  for  efficient  financial\nintermediation that enables institutions to concentrate on their core competencies. For the CBs\nand DFIs, this core competency is serving the upper and middle segments of the market. While\nthe banking system has responded positively to the reform initiatives, an efficient and financially\nsound  system,  barring  select  institutions,  has  yet  to  emerge.  The  high  level  of  nonperforming\nloans  attributed  to  slack  industrial  activity  is  widespread.  Some  institutions  have  capital\nadequacy  below  the  prescribed  8  percent  of  risk-weighted  assets.  Competitive  pressures  for\nproduct differentiation and cost reduction is increasing. Smaller institutions are not able to invest\nin new technology and a branch network to access low cost retail deposits to gain competitive\nadvantage. The banking system is becoming concentrated in a few large institutions.\n\nMF  is  unlikely  to  become  a  significant  part  of  CBs\u2019  portfolios.  Operating  procedures  of\n36.\nCBs  are  incompatible  with  the  requirements  of  banking  with  the  poor,  and  thus  their  services\nand  delivery  mechanisms  have  excluded  the  poor.  Women  have  been  virtually  excluded  from\ninstitutional  credit.  In  addition,  CBs  are  undergoing  reforms  that  include  closing  loss-making\nbranches,  downsizing,  recapitalizing,  and  implementing  measures  to  recover  and  write-off\nnonperforming  loans.  The  CB\u2019s  priorities  therefore  are  restructuring  and  reorganization.  Slow\ntransformation  of  DFIs  into  efficient  financial  intermediaries  due  to  their  overt  political\nconsiderations in business decisions and persistent poor governance, particularly of ADBP and\nFBC,  underlines  constraints  to  change  and  undermines  the  development  of  the  rural  financial\nsystem.  For  these  reasons,  MF  has  been  perceived  as  high  risk  and  unprofitable  in  Pakistan.\nConsequently, potential suppliers have avoided entry into MF.\n\nFBC  (para.  27)  channels  funds  to  provincial  cooperative  banks  at  an  interest  rate  of\n37.\nabout 2 percent per annum; they in turn onlend to societies and members at a markup to yield\n14-16  percent  per  annum.  This  increases  the  transaction  cost  of  the  system  and  serves  as  a\ndisincentive for deposit mobilization. FBC serves no justifiable financial intermediation role and\nreflects  an  arrangement  that  is  contrary  to  the  direction  of  ongoing  financial  sector  reforms.\nMany  societies  are  fictitious,  loans  bogus,  accounting  procedures  inadequate,  and  low\n\n\f10\n\nrepayment  rates  a  persistent  problem.  Women\u2019s  cooperatives  have  been  systematically\nexcluded from credit and training programs through FBC.\n\n38.\nThe persistent poor loan repayment record (60\u201370 percent) has eroded the fund base of\nADBP  (para.  28).  Annual  accounts  for  1999  still  record  a  profit,  largely  because  loan  losses\nwere underestimated and standard income recognition norms were disregarded.21 Deposits are\nonly  2  percent  of  total  liabilities.  The  organizational  structure  and  institutional  orientation  as  a\ncollateral-based  lending  institution  for  agriculture  is  not  consistent  with  the  participatory\ncommunity-based MF lending for farm and nonfarm activities.\n\n39.\nNGOs  have  small  credit  operations  with  no  MF  specialization.  NGOs  do  not  have  the\ntrained  staff,  financial  systems,  and,  until  recently,  have  not  seen  the  necessity  of  following\nsuccessful practices and procedures. Good governance is a growing concern. Even among the\nmembers  of  the  MF  Group,  7  have  yet  to  achieve  financial  viability.  Inadequate  investment  in\nsocial intermediation has also affected portfolio quality.\n\nc.\n\nIslamic Banking\n\n40.\nIslamic  banking  is  practiced  in  Pakistan  for  transactions  between  banks  and  clients,\nincluding MF services. Markup over the principal and service charge are applied, as interest is\nprohibited  under  Sharia  (Islamic  Law).  The  revenue  under  this  mode  has  been  higher  for\nlenders  compared  with  the  interest-based  system.  Recently,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan\nruled  that  markup  and  service  charges  are  applicable  only  when  actual  commodity  or  assets\nchange  hands  and  the  supplier  is  the  financier.  A  Commission  on  Transformation  of  the\nFinancial System has been set up to prepare operating guidelines. This may require systemic\nchanges affecting all financial institutions and will require adjustments to operating procedures.\nIn the meantime, MF services consistent with Islamic banking norms are already being provided\nand related training programs conducted.\n\n3.\n\nServices\n\n41.\nDelivery of financial services to the poor, particularly in rural areas is constrained by low\npopulation density in some provinces, inadequate communication services, small loans, and low\nhousehold  savings  that  increase  transaction  costs.  Seasonality  of  the  agriculture  business\ncycle,  the  main  occupation  for  poor  households,  and  the  high  probability  of  risks  add  to  the\nproblems  of  providing  MF  services  to  the  rural  poor.  In  addition,  while  security  of  savings  is  a\nprime  concern  for  rural  households,  secure  savings  facilities  are  not  accessible.  CBs  find  it\ncostly  to  cater  to  small  depositors.  Savings  through  NGO  intermediaries,  deposited  with  CBs,\nare generally compulsory and do not necessarily provide the maximum return to the depositor.\nNGOs cannot deploy such savings as microcredit.\n\nD.\n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n1.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n42.\nThe Government\u2019s goal of poverty reduction is to be realized through a comprehensive\napproach  that  takes  into  account  the  interactions  of  economic  social  and  governance\ndimensions. The approach is outlined in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP).\n\n21 PCR: PAK 19120: Second Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan Project (Loan Nos. 810 and 811),  March\n\n                  \n\n1997.\n\n\f11\n\nExpenditure  and  budgetary  allocations  for  poverty  reduction  measures  have  been  enhanced\n(para.  65).  The  poverty  alleviation  program  of  the  Government  has  five  elements:  (i)  small\ninfrastructure  projects,  (ii)  social  safety  nets,  (iii)  food  support  program,  (iv)  improving  social\nindicators, and (v) expanded access to MF and skills development services through grassroots\norganizations  such  as  NGOs  and  village  organizations.  Greater  private  sector  involvement  in\npoverty reduction is envisaged. The Social Action Program Phase-II (from January 1997 to June\n2002)  aims  to  improve  access  to  basic  social  services  like  primary  education,  primary  health\ncare,  population  welfare  services,  potable  water,  sanitation,  and  middle  schooling.  The\nGovernment has also responded to growing unemployment, with a series of schemes including\nthe  mass  Self-employment  Program.22  The  incidence  of  poverty  is  to  be  reduced  from  33\npercent of the population to a target level of 15.2 percent by end 2008.\n\n2.\n\nMicrofinance Sector Development\n\nTo enhance outreach of MF, the Government has adopted a comprehensive approach23\n43.\nto  address  issues  and  constraints  through  (i)  a  conducive  policy  framework,  (ii)  appropriate\nsupervisory  and  regulatory  infrastructure,  (iii)  institutions  capable  of  outreach  to  the  poor,  and\n(iv) investments in social intermediation and basic infrastructure. The Government also plans to\nrestructure  DFIs.  Emphasis  will  be  placed  on  good  governance,  sustainability,  public-private\npartnerships,  community-based  service  delivery  through  NGOs,  pro-poor  focus,  and  gender\nconcerns.  This  strategy  complements  the  efforts  of  the  PPAF  and  other  MF  suppliers,  and\nprovides the basis for a concerted effort to enhance outreach in a grossly underserved market.\n\n3.\n\nGender Development\n\n44.\nGender  focus  will  be  emphasized  in  the  strategies  and  underlying  activities  in  various\nGovernment  programs.  A  permanent  commission  on  the  status  of  women  has  been  formally\nannounced  to  protect  women's  rights.  The  IPRSP  also  recognizes  the  gender  dimension  of\npoverty and proposes reform of discriminatory laws and measures to coordinate policies. Within\nthe IPRSP framework, a review and modification of economic and social policies to incorporate\ngender  perspectives  is  planned.  Strengthening  of  gender  focal  points  in  federal  and  provincial\nwomen  development  departments  and  identification  of  targets  for  the  implementation  of  the\nNational Action Plan (Ministry of Women Development) have been envisaged.\n\nE.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nThe Poverty Alleviation Fund Project ($90 million) funded by the World Bank is the first\n45.\nmajor external assistance in the MF sector (para. 25). The project provides (i) onlending support\n($45 million) at 6-8 percent for microcredit to eligible organizations, (ii) grants on a cost-sharing\nbasis  for  community  infrastructure  projects  ($28  million),  (iii)  grant  ($10  million)  for  capacity\nbuilding of communities and partner organizations, and (iv) institutional development grant ($7\nmillion) for PPAF. At full implementation, outreach could extend to 200,000 poor households.\n\n46.\nBilateral  funding  agencies  and  international  NGOs  are  involved  in  microenterprise  and\nNGO  development.  Their  assistance  includes  (i)  capacity  building  for  NGOs;  (ii)  organizing\ncommunities;  (iii)  small  grants  as  seed  capital  for  MF;  (iv)  support  for  income  generation,\n\n                  \n\n22  The Small Business Finance Corporation and Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency, spearheading\nthe employment programs, granted loans of PRs12 billion ($214 million) to 157,162 unemployed persons by June\n1998, which, according to estimates, resulted in the creation of 397,129 jobs. Other financial institutions including\nCBs have also participated in the program.\n\n23  As part of the MSDP.\n\n\f12\n\nempowerment of women, and poverty reduction through NGOs; (v) business advisory services\nfor small enterprises; (vi) expansion of the MF portfolio of CBs; and (vii) support for MF under\nrural  development  projects.  Major  development  agencies  are \nfor\nDevelopment  Cooperation,  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,\nNetherlands Development Assistance, Canadian International Development Agency, and three\ninternational  NGOs:  NOVIB  (Netherlands),  Asia  Foundation  (United  States),  and  Trust  for\nVoluntary  Organizations  (United  States).  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is\nplanning to introduce the MicroStart Program to provide TA to MFIs.\n\nthe  Swiss  Agency \n\n47.\nExternal  assistance  to  the  sector  (Appendix  6)  has  (i)  introduced  successful  practices;\n(ii)  supported  social  intermediation;  (iii)  enabled  selected  NGOs  to  deliver  MF  services;  (iv)\nprovided  onlending  support;  (v)  heightened  gender  concerns;  (vi)  established  NGO  networks\n(MF Group); and (vii) introduced new products, e.g., leasing. All have had a positive impact on\nthe sector. However, to catalyze the development of the MF sector significant interventions and\ninvestments  are  required  for  (i)  enhanced  outreach,  (ii)  social  intermediation,  and  (iii)\nsustainability of benefits, within a conducive policy framework.\n\nF.\n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n48.\nThe  country  operational  framework  for  Pakistan,  1999-2000,  links  poverty  reduction  to\nsocial  services,  agriculture  and  rural  development,  MF,  development  of  social  infrastructure,\nreforms  in  finance  and  industry  sectors,  and  good  governance.  Specific  measures  such  as\nbetter  targeting,  improved  rural  financial  policies,  and  enhanced  access  to  financial  services\nhave been emphasized for greater poverty reduction impact.\n\nADB\u2019s  overarching  goal  is  poverty  reduction.24  The  poverty  reduction  strategy  outlines\n49.\npro-poor sustainable economic growth, social development, and good governance as its three\npillars. Agriculture and rural sectors are also emphasized, as the majority of the poor live in rural\nareas.  The  poverty  reduction  strategy  considers  MF  to  have  the  potential  to  increase  the\nphysical capital of the poor, while simultaneously building human and social capital. Emphasis is\nplaced on policy reforms, sustainable institutions, and effective monitoring. ADB\u2019s private sector\nstrategy25  emphasizes  enhanced  private  sector  contributions  to  poverty  reduction  by  creating\nenabling  conditions,  generating  business  opportunities,  and  catalyzing  private  investments\nthrough  public  and  private  sector  operations.  Operational  priorities  include  efficient  financial\nintermediation and public-private synergy.\n\nThe goal of ADB\u2019s MF strategy26 is to ensure permanent access to institutional financial\n50.\nservices  for  the  majority  of  the  poor  and  the  purpose  is  to  support  an  MF  system  that  can\nprovide  diverse  services  of  high  quality.  The  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  creating  a  policy\nenvironment  conducive  to  MF,  (ii)  developing  financial  infrastructure,  (iii)  building  viable\ninstitutions,  (iv)  supporting  pro-poor  innovations,  and  (v)  supporting  social  intermediation.\nEmphasis  is  placed  on  designing  projects  in  close  consultation  with  stakeholders,  including\npotential clients, to ensure  that  assistance is client-focused, demand-driven, and appropriately\npriced  and  delivered.  Support  to  viable  institutions  that  can  set  in  motion  such  a  process  has\nbeen emphasized, along with reform of DFIs that continue to undermine the MF sector.\n\n24  R179-99:  Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\n\n25 R78-00:  Promoting the Private Sector to Support Growth and Reduce Poverty: Private Sector Development\n\n                  \n\nBank, 19 October.\n\nStrategy, 9 March.\n\n26 R106-00: Finance For the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy, 16 May.\n\n\fG.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n13\n\n51.\nThe  MSDP  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  experience  with  a  sector  development  approach  for  MF.\nWhile  the  MSDP  primarily  builds  on  the  lessons  learned  in  Pakistan,  it  also  draws  on  the\nexperience of countries with mature MF sectors and adapts the same to Pakistan context.\n\n1.\n\nADB\u2019s Microfinance Experience\n\nCommunity-based  multisectoral  area  development  programs  supported  by  ADB27  in\n52.\nPakistan have made a positive contribution to poverty reduction. MF components under these\nprojects support outreach extension through credit lines and grants to support transaction costs\nfor  service  provider  NGOs,  which  act  as  subcontractors  to  mobilize  communities,  their  core\nstrength.  ADB  also  supported  linkages  between  CBs  and  NGOs,  with  the  CBs  providing\nfinancial  services  to  communities  mobilized  by  NGOs.  However,  outreach  could  have  been\nhigher  with  greater  commitment  of  CBs  to  banking  with  the  poor.  Lessons  learned  by  ADB  in\nimplementing  MF  projects  or  projects  with  MF  components  in  other  countries  indicate  that  (i)\ndemand for savings is high, even higher than for credit; (ii) access to services compatible with\nrequirements of the poor is important; (iii) a diverse range of institutions is required to enhance\noutreach;  (iv)  institutional  viability  is  important  to  provide  permanent  access;  (v)  institutional\nstrengthening  needs  are  significant;  and  (vi)  social  intermediation  support  for  the  poor  is\nimportant to enable them to benefit from access to MF services.\n\n2.\n\nSuccessful Practices\n\nSuccessful  practices  in  Pakistan  emphasize  that  MFIs  should  (i)  appropriately  price\n53.\nproducts and services; (ii) mobilize a substantial amount of deposit funds from within serviced\ncommunities,  and  along  with  borrowings,  transform  these  into  loans;  (iii)  adopt  innovative\nstructures and practices that encourage proximity to communities and enable handling of large\nnumbers  of  customers;  (iv)  implement  inexpensive  administrative  and  operating  procedures;\nand (v) provide incentives to staff to encourage good performance. Institutional autonomy, good\ngovernance,  and  professional  management  are  prerequisites.  Outreach  to  the  poor  is  greater\nwith  effective  targeting,  greater  commitment  to  attain  a  viable  scale  of  operation,  and\nappropriate pricing of services.\n\n3.\n\nProviding Access to Women\n\nSocial  intermediation  and  access  to  basic  infrastructure  should  precede  as  well  as\n54.\naccompany MF services, especially when aimed at women. MF projects targeting poor women\nin Pakistan suggest that (i) MFIs need to hire female staff; (ii) staff must mobilize savings and\nservice  loans  where  women  live  and/or  work;  and  (iii)  women  benefit  from  participation  in\nsolidarity groups and skills development. Substantial efforts are required to develop groups in a\nparticipatory  manner  so  that  they  can  become  conduits  for  delivering  social  services  and\nenhance the social and economic status of women. In the context of the overall status of CBs\nand DFIs (paras. 35-38), outreach to women cannot be achieved by downscaling operations of\nCBs and DFIs as they were not originally created for the poor.\n\n                  \n\n27 Loan 1467-PAK(SF): Bahawalpur Rural Development Project, for $38 million, approved on 26 September 1996;\nLoan  1531-PAK(SF):  Dera Ghazi Khan Rural Development Project,  for  $36  million,  approved  on  4  September\n1997;  and  Loan  1672-PAK(SF): Malakand Rural Development Project,  for  $41  million,  approved  on  18  March\n1999.\n\n\f14\n\n4.\n\nRole of Government in Microfinance Sector Development\n\n55.\nThe  Government\u2019s  interventions  to  strengthen  the  MF  sector  should  complement  the\nmarket and decrease over time, while private participation in the provision of financial services\nshould increase once the basic policy framework and key institutions are in place. International\nexperiences  show  that  to  develop  the  MF  sector,  priority  should  be  given  to  viability  of\noperations. Start-up initiatives require investment support as access to money markets will only\nmaterialize over the medium to long term. Targeting the poor requires complementary services\nsuch as infrastructure, skills development, and education, which can be offered by the NGOs or\nstate services in a participatory manner and coordinated with the delivery of MF services.\n\n5.\n\nLead Institutions for Sector Development\n\n56.\nExperience  of  countries  with  a  mature  MF  industry  indicates  that  a  lead  institution  is\nneeded  to  play  the  role  of  anchor  and  catalyst  to  generate  momentum  for  growth,  and\nencourage  investments  and  institutional  diversity.28  The  Grameen  Bank  in  Bangladesh  started\nunder  a  special  charter  of  the  government  that  provided  the  flexibility  to  meet  the  demand  for\nMF.  The  success  of  Grameen  Bank  led  to  worldwide  replication  as  a  means  to  reach  the\nexcluded.  The  increasing  number  of  replicators  led  to  growth  in  demand  for  basic  supporting\ninfrastructure  for  MF  training,  audit,  and  credit  rating.  The  Unit  Desa  system  in  Bank  Rakyat\nIndonesia was created with government seed capital to provide a full range of financial services.\nBecause Unit Desas attained economies of scale and introduced efficient modes of operations,\nthey encouraged other intermediaries to expand activities in rural areas.\n\n6.\n\nSupervision and Regulation for Microfinance\n\n57.\nThe opening of the MF sector under an omnibus legal and regulatory framework requires\nprudence and due diligence. This is best undertaken with corresponding capacity enhancement\nof  the  central  bank,  establishment  of  self-regulating  organizations  wherever  necessary,  and\nmaturity of the MF industry. The degree and appropriate form of regulation within the framework\ndepends  on  the  size,  ownership  structure,  and  nature  of  the  institutions.  Overstretching  the\nlimited  supervisory  capacity  of  the  central  bank  and  the  costs  involved  are  major  concerns.\nInitially,  institutions  with  sufficient  operational  flexibility  for  banking  with  the  poor  should  be\nallowed entry on a selective basis subject to fairly intensive supervision by the central bank to\nprotect  the  interests  of  the  poor.  A  broader  framework  is  then  developed  under  which  diverse\ninstitutions  can  operate.  This  graduated  approach  is  being  adopted29  for  flexibility  and  to\naccommodate innovations.\n\n                  \n\n28 Some of the other institutions supported under ADB-funded projects include: (i) Loan 1741-CAM (SF): Rural Credit\nand Savings Project: supported the establishment of Rural Development Bank (state-owned) to onlend to MFIs as\nwell as undertake limited retail lending operations; (ii) Loan 1650-NEP (SF): Rural Microfinance Project: supported\nthe establishment of Rural Microfinance Development Center (private-public partnership) as an apex for onlending\nand  technical  support  to  both  state-owned  and  private  sector  intermediaries;  (iii)  Loan  1435-PHI  (SF):  Rural\nMicroenterprise Finance Project:  supported  the  establishment  of  People\u2019s  Credit  and  Finance  Corporation  (state-\nowned)  as  an  apex  agency  for  onlending  and  technical  support  to  both  state-owned  and  private  sector\nintermediaries; and (iv) Loan 1457-VIE (SF): Rural Credit Project: supported Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural\nDevelopment (state-owned) and People\u2019s Credit Fund (established under a special charter of the central bank with\ninitial seed capital support).\n\n29  (i)TA  3078-BAN: Establishment of Framework for a Sustainable Microfinance,  for  $800,000,  approved  on  29\nSeptember  1998;  (ii)  The  Financial  Intermediaries  Act  of  1999  was  promulgated  in  Nepal  to  encourage  NGOs  to\nundertake MF after the establishment of five Grameen Bank Replicators under the Development Bank Act of 1995;\nand (iii) Framework for Sustainable MF is now being considered in Viet Nam, learning from the experience of the\nPeople\u2019s Credit Fund.\n\n\f15\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n58. While  many  factors  contribute  to  poverty,  its  most  obvious  manifestation  is  insufficient\nhousehold income. Poor households are permanently in deficit or in debt. Evidence from many\ncountries has shown that access to and efficient provision of savings and credit facilities, along\nwith social intermediation, enables the poor to stabilize their income and consumption, manage\nrisks  better,  gradually  build  assets,  develop  microenterprises,  enhance  income-earning\ncapacity, and thus enjoy a relatively better quality of life.\n\n59.\nCurrently  served  by  informal  arrangements  and  a  few  small  NGO  initiatives,  the  MF\nsector in Pakistan is unable to expand. MF services are provided on a very limited scale, and\nsavings at positive real interest rates for the poor are practically excluded. By borrowing at high\ninterest rates in informal markets the poor are trapped in low-risk, low-return investments, which\nin the long run, will widen income gaps. Due to lack of access to alternative affordable sources\nthe poor are unable to increase or diversify their household income. Together these have long-\nterm negative effects on consumption and asset buildup of the poor households.\n\n60.\nInstitutions to bridge demand and supply gap for MF services do not yet exist in Pakistan\nowing  to  policy  and  legal  gaps  and  the  lack  of  a  supportive  financial  infrastructure  (paras.  19\nand 34). CBs, in general, are neither structured nor geared to extend their MF exposure beyond\nexperimental forays. CBs\u2019 restructuring priorities are downsizing and recovery of doubtful debts,\nwhich constitute a significant part of their loan portfolio. Most DFIs have numerous financial and\norganizational  issues.  Politicization  has  eroded  autonomy  and  good  governance,  and  the\npersistent poor loan repayment record has eroded the DFIs\u2019 fund base. CBs and DFIs primarily\ncater  to  the  upper  and  middle  segments  of  the  financial  markets,  rural  elite,  and  farmers  with\nsizeable landholdings, rather than to the assetless poor.\n\n61.\nSocial  constraints  to  enhancing  outreach  include  (i)  social  barriers  affecting  women\u2019s\naccess to MF, (ii) vulnerability of the poor to economic and physical downturns, and (iii) weak\nsocial preparedness for effective utilization of financial services. These are further exacerbated\nby  institutions  of  governance  that  tend  to  exclude  the  poor,  especially  women,  from  the  entire\ndecision  making  process.  These  have  impeded  the  growth  of  the  MF  sector  resulting  in  a\nmajority of the poor without access to affordable MF. The small number of poor households with\naccess  to  institutional  MF  are  not  assured  of  permanent  access  because  of  the  limited  retail\ncapacity and inadequate resource base of MF service providers.\n\n62.\nTo  realize  the  poverty  reduction  potential  of  MF,  substantial  continuing  resources  are\nrequired  to  meet  the  magnitude  of  demand.  Efficient  institutional  and  market  mechanisms  are\nneeded  whereby  funds  can  be  sourced  in  the  domestic  market  and  supplemented  by  funding\nagencies.  Funds  need  to  be  allocated  efficiently  through  appropriately  designed  and  priced\nservices  to  the  poor  for  investment  in  agriculture  and  microenterprises  in  a  profitable  manner.\nTo accomplish this, an integrated package of policy, institutional development, capacity building,\nand outreach expansion is needed, along with strong commitment to pursue reforms. The sector\ndevelopment  program  modality  has  thus  been  chosen  for  facilitating  the  adoption  of  basic\nsectoral  reforms  to  ensure  that  an  adequate  policy  and  institutional  framework  is  in  place  to\noptimize investment lending. The MSDP includes a policy loan to support policy reforms and an\ninvestment loan to support sector investment to enhance outreach. By formalizing the linkages\nbetween policy and investment components the MSDP will yield considerable benefits in terms\nof fostering a long-term sector wide perspective for sustained poverty reduction efforts.\n\n\f16\n\nThe  Government  considers  MF  as  a  subsector  of  banking.  To  continue  initial  gains\n63.\nderived  from  banking  reforms,  the  Government,  with  ADB  support,  formulated  a  policy  and\ninvestment package for the MSDP. The policy package provides:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nimproved  financial  services  for  the  poor,  with  the  Government  providing  a\nsupporting  policy  and  institutional  framework  to  encourage  private  sector\nparticipation;\n\nsupport  for  social  intermediation  in  a  participatory  manner  to  enhance  social\ncapital30 for the poor to enable them to take advantage of economic opportunities\nthrough accessible and affordable MF services; and\n\n(iii) \n\npromotion  of  pro-poor  institutions  to  provide  immediate  accessibility  to  financial\nand social services.\n\n64. With a supporting policy framework, sustainable outreach to the poor can be realized by\ncombining  social  and  financial  intermediation.  Investments  in  social  intermediation  and  to\nextend outreach will help realize the poverty reduction potential of MF. Support for institutional\narrangements  that  combine  the  development  efforts  of  a  range  of  institutions\u2014financial  and\nnonfinancial\u2014will catalyze the development of a critical mass of MF services. This will attract a\nrange  of  retailers  and  also  a  range  of  organizations  providing  services  to  MFIs  such  as  rating\nagencies and auditors (para. 56).\n\n65.\nThe  Government  has  shown  commitment  for  poverty  reduction  (paras.  42-44).\nGovernment  expenditures  for  poverty  reduction  measures  was  PRs67  billion  ($1.2  billion)  in\nFY2000, and the allocation for FY2001 is PRs83 billion ($1.5 billion), representing a growth of\n25 percent. This is about 12.5 percent of the total budgeted expenditure for FY2001 compared\nto  10.5  percent  for  FY2000.  The  bulk  of  the  increase,  PRs21  billion  ($375  million),  is  for  the\nIntegrated  Rural  and  Urban  Development  Program  for  rural  and  low-income  urban  areas.\nIncluded in the annual allocations for FY2001 are about PRs34 billion for the Social Action Plan,\nPhase  II.  For  the  entire  duration  of  the  Social  Action  Plan,  Phase  II  (1997-2002)  the  outlay  is\nPRs499 billion ($9 billion), of which funding agencies\u2019 assistance is envisaged at PRs101 billion\n(20  percent).  The  restructuring  cost  of  DFIs;  instituting  mechanisms  for  social  intermediation\nand  risk  mitigation;  MFI  supervision;  and  capitalization  of  MFIs  involves  substantial  costs.  To\nprovide access to all the poor households with one average size ($295) microcredit loan would\nrequire  about  $2  billion  (para.  14)  with  an  annual  incremental  requirement  of  $200  million,\nrepresenting larger loans in successive loan cycles.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe  sector  objective  is  to  reduce  poverty.  The  purpose  of  the  MSDP  is  to  develop  the\n66.\nMF sector to efficiently provide a range of affordable financial and social services to the poor,\nespecially  women  who  disproportionately  bear  the  burden  of  poverty.  Services  provided  at\naffordable  prices  will  have  a  significant  poverty  reduction  impact  and  thereby  (i)  increase\nincomes  of  poor  households;  (ii)  enhance  outreach,  especially  to  women;  (iii)  build  social\ncapital; and (iv) reduce risks faced by the poor.\n                  \n\n30 In practice strengthening the social capital of the poor largely means increasing opportunities for their participation\nin  the  workings  of  the  society  where  social  cohesion  is  weak  and  poor  suffer  from  systemic  social  exclusion.\nIncreasing  economic  opportunities  and  creating  participatory  institutions/mechanisms  are  required  to  enhance\nsocial  capital.  The  promotion  of  community  based  groups  to  undertake  MF,  health,  and  natural  resource\nmanagement is an important step in this direction.\n\n\f17\n\nThe  MSDP  will  encourage  the  adoption  of  policy  actions  aimed  at  developing  the  MF\n67.\nsector.  These  include  (i)  developing  an  enabling  policy  framework  for  MF  development;  (ii)\nfacilitating the establishment of the Microfinance Bank (MFB); (iii) developing a framework that\nincorporates legislative, supervisory, and regulatory aspects to promote institutional diversity in\nthe  MF  sector;  (iv)  establishing  mechanisms  that  will  enhance  social  capital;  (v)  piloting  risk\nmitigation  mechanisms  for  the  poor  as  a  safety  net  measure;  and  (vi)  initiating  measures  to\nrestructure  DFIs.  To  leverage  policy  actions,  the  MSDP  will  direct  investment  to  facilitate\noutreach expansion, enhance social capital, and strengthen institutions.\n\n68.\nThe  MSDP  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  IPRSP  (paras.  42-44)  and  ADB\u2019s\nstrategies for poverty reduction, development of MF, and the private sector. The Government\u2019s\napproach for MF sector development is consistent with the fundamental banking reforms (para.\n17). ADB's support for the MSDP is justified as the MSDP provides:\n\na  catalytic  and  lead  role  for  the  development  of  the  MF  sector  by  emphasizing\nsupportive  policies  and  creating  opportunities  for  private  investors  to  enhance\nincome-generating opportunities for the poor;\n\na synergistic private-public mechanism to deliver affordable financial services to\na large number of poor households for a significant poverty reduction impact;\n\nproactive  policies  and  mechanisms  for  sustained  investments  to  reverse  the\nfeelings  of  social  and  psychological \nfoster  a  sense  of\nempowerment  among  poor  to  enhance  social  capital  and  mitigate  risks  through\nalliances with civil society and the private sector; and\n\ninferiority  and \n\n(iv) \n\ncomplementarity  with  the  efforts  of  other  stakeholders,  including  NGOs,  in\nextending the frontiers of institutional MF in a grossly underserved market.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n1.\n\nDevelop an Enabling Policy Framework for Microfinance Development\n\n69.\nGiven  the  significance  of  MF  to  the  socioeconomic  context  of  Pakistan,  the  policy\ncomponent of the MSDP will focus on developing an enabling policy framework. As part of the\nMSDP  the  Government  has  committed,  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  and  in  light  of\ninternational experience (paras. 51-57), to an MF policy that\n\nencourages  emergence  of  MFIs  to  increase  outreach  to  the  poor  and  the\nexcluded, especially poor women;\n\nrecognizes  the need to direct investments to build social capital and to mitigate\nrisks faced by the poor;\n\npromotes  linkages  between  MFIs  specializing  in  financial  intermediation  and\nNGOs  with  core  competency  in  social  intermediation  to  provide  financial  and\nnonfinancial services to individuals, as well as groups;\n\n(iv) \n\npromotes public-private partnerships and private sector initiatives, especially the\nenhanced role of NGOs; and\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n\f18\n\n(v) \n\nimproves the profile of MF among policymakers, with SBP taking a proactive role\nin  establishing  financial  infrastructure  to  support  MF  development  and  in\nintegrating MF with the broader financial system.\n\n2.\n\nFacilitate Establishment of Microfinance Bank\n\n70.\nMFB  was  designed  to  implement  the  MF  policy  in  response  to  the  rising  incidence  of\npoverty,  significant  demand  and  supply  gap,  negligible  institutional  outreach,  and  disarray  of\nDFIs.  MFB  is  expected  to  be  the  lead  institution  to  generate  the  momentum  for  the  sector  to\ngrow, and expected investments and institutional diversity to materialize (paras. 55-57). MFB is\npart of the policy matrix of the IPRSP.\n\nThe objective of MFB (Appendix 7) is to provide sustainable MF services to the poor in\n71.\norder  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  social  development  and  economic  justice  through\ncommunity  building  and  social  mobilization.  MFB  was  established  on  6  August  2000  as  a\nprivate-public31  institution  with  paid-up  capital  of  PRs1.7  billion  ($30  million)  subscribed  by  16\nCBs; 13 private sector CBs, including 2 foreign CBs (Citibank and Standard Chartered Bank),\nand  3  state-owned  CBs.  Investors  have  selected  the  eight-member  board  of  directors.  The\nchairperson  is  an  independent  director  from  the  NGO  sector  and  a  well  known  poverty\nspecialist,  and  the  president  is  a  banking  professional  with  MF  experience.  Three  directors,\nincluding two women, are independent directors from the NGO sector.  Two directors are from\nprivate banks, including one from a foreign bank, and another two from the state-owned CBs.\n\n72. While  observing  successful  MF  practices  (paras.  53-54),  MFB  will  provide  affordable\nservices, including savings, credit, leasing, money transfer, and risk mitigation. MFB combines\nthe development efforts of a range of service institutions in a synergistic and catalytic manner.\nNGOs  will  undertake  social  intermediation,  and  financial  services  will  be  provided  primarily  by\nMFB,  but  also  through  NGO  service  providers.  MFB  will  adopt  an  in-house  management\nstructure to reduce transaction costs. Forty percent of MFB staff and 40 percent of the clients\nwill be women. Service delivery methodology and products will have a strong gender bias. MFB\nwill work in partnership with NRSP, the largest NGO in the country by taking over, in phases, its\nMF portfolio comprising about 45,000 active borrowers in 1,900 COs and 50 staff. Outreach is\nprojected to be 560,000 borrowers32 in year six as a result of mobilizing new COs, and from the\npotential MF clients from the half a million poor already mobilized in COs by the NGO sector.\n\n73.\nAmong the financial institutions in Pakistan, MFB has the most elaborate rules for good\ncorporate governance. MFB statute ensures that Government servants or politicians cannot be\nappointed to its board of directors. The statute insulates MFB from political interference as the\nboard  and SBP  are entrusted to decide on all matters. MFB rules adopted by MFB's board of\ndirectors,  after  SBP  approval,  institutionalize  appointment  of  independent  directors  from  the\nNGO sector. MFB rules also include (i) more stringent provisions than the ordinary company law\nfor  dealing  with  transactions  in  which  a  director  has  an  interest;  (ii)  express  descriptions  of\nduties of directors, including independent directors, obligating each director to act in the interest\nof  all  shareholders;  (iii)  requirement  for  an  audit  committee  comprising  majority  independent\ndirectors  to  appoint  the  auditors,  submit  a  separate  annual  report  to  shareholders,  and  fix\nremuneration of all staff including management; and (iv) provisions for greater transparency by\n\n                  \n\n31 MFB will be a majority private-owned bank as two of the three state-owned CBs are listed for divestiture.\n32  For comparison, the Association for Social Advancement (Bangladesh) had one million borrowers within 7 years\nof microcredit operations. This was achieved in the presence of and in competition with established MFIs such as\nthe  Bangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee  and  the  Grameen  Bank.  The  People\u2019s  Credit  Fund  (Viet  Nam)\nhas been able to mobilize nearly 800,000 members within 8 years of establishment.\n\n\f19\n\nallowing  independent  directors  access  to  all  records,  and  provision  of  timely  information  to\nshareholders. In addition, SBP has put in place a specific supervisory and regulatory framework\nthat sets operational parameters that MFB must meet on an ongoing basis.\n\n3. \n\nDevelop a Framework for Institutional Diversity in the Microfinance Sector\n\n74.\nAs  part  of  the  MSDP,  the  institutional  design  and  financial  infrastructure  created  to\nsupport  MFB  will  be  used  as  a  basis  to  develop  a  framework\u2014legal,  supervisory,  and\nregulatory\u2014to mainstream the attributes of the basic MF policy. The framework scope includes\n(i)  definition  and  categorization  of  MF  service  providers  into  categories  of  MFIs  and  their\nlicensing  procedures;  (ii)  corresponding  supervision  and  regulation  standards  and  systems,\nincluding self-regulation; (iii) disclosure and reporting requirements; (iv) appropriate adjustment\nfor  entry  threshold  prescribed  under  the  banking  laws  to  enable  entry  of  MFIs  as  licensed\ndepository  institutions;  and  (v)  foreclosure  and  dispute  resolution  mechanisms.  As  a  matter  of\ndue diligence prior to opening up the sector to a diverse range of institutions the development of\nthe  enabling  framework  is  sequenced  (para.  57)  after  the  dedicated  systems  for  MFB  are\noperational and the supervisory capacity of SBP is enhanced. Once finalized and adopted, the\nframework  will  also  be  made  applicable  to  MFB,  as  necessary.  Small  licensed  MFIs  are\nexpected  to  emerge  after  the  framework  is  adopted.  These  MFIs  could  break-even  within  4-5\nyears  of  start-up  and  reach  20,000-30,000  clients  over  10  years.  MFB  is  expected  to  be  a\nstrategic investor in these small MFIs.\n\n75.\nSBP has established a Microfinance Support Division reporting to the executive director.\nThe  Microfinance  Support  Division  has  a  Microfinance  Policy  Unit  and  a  Consultative  Group.\nThe  Consultative  Group,  represented  by  stakeholders,  will  serve  as  an  advisory  body  in\ndesigning the framework and outlining the manner in which it will be adopted, possibly through\nan omnibus legislation or amendments of existing statutes.\n\n4.\n\nEstablish Mechanisms for Enhancing Social Capital\n\n76.\nAs part of the MSDP, the Microfinance Social Development Fund (MSDF) (Appendix 8)\nwas established in SBP for intensive and sustained support for promotion of COs and capacity\nbuilding for the poor, especially women, to effectively utilize MF services. The revenue earned\nfrom MSDF will meet defined social preparation costs associated with community mobilization,\nskills development, social awareness, basic numeracy skills, and selection and management of\nIGAs  for  about  560,000  poor  organized  in  about  24,750  COs.  MSDF  will  fund  women\u2019s\nempowerment  through  training  in  community  management,  capacity  enhancement  for  specific\nidentified  skills,  and  leadership  management.  The  duration  of  MSDF  is  for  25  years  and  the\nminimum  outlay  is  $40  million  equivalent  to  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  support  social\ndevelopment  needs  of  the  expected  clients.  The  Government  will  contribute  the  bulk  of  the\nfunds required. MFB has made an initial contribution and is mandated to set aside 10 percent of\nits net profit in terms of MFB Rules 2000 issued by SBP.\n\n77.\nTo  leverage  the  social  mobilization  through  MSDF,  the  Community  Investment  Fund\n(CIF) (Appendix 9) was established in SBP, with a term of 25 years, to increase the access of\nthe  poor  to  basic  infrastructure  and  thus  improve  their  livelihoods  through  efficient  and\nproductive  use  of  local  resources.  The  involvement  of  COs  in  identifying,  planning,  executing,\nand monitoring community-based infrastructure subprojects will empower them and serve as an\nincentive  to  mobilize  and  strengthen  COs.  This  will  help  expand  the  MF  market  and  maintain\npeer pressure as a substitute for physical collateral. The minimum outlay of CIF is $20 million\n\n\f20\n\nequivalent  and  the  Government  will  contribute  the  bulk  of  the  funds.  MFB  has  made  an  initial\ncontribution.\n\n78.\nMSDF  and  CIF  support  will  enhance  social  capital  by  creating  a  network  of  COs,\nstrengthening COs, increasing social and economic interaction among the excluded, influencing\nnorms of behaviors that govern interaction between genders, enhancing capacity and skills, and\nproviding opportunities for economic development. The fund mechanism provides a clear basis\nfor determining social costs associated with MF and has a built-in exit mechanism; as business\nvolume increases, MFB revenues will meet an increasing proportion of social costs. MSDF and\nCIF will be dedicated facilities for MFB for the first three years, licensed MFIs will be included\nthereafter, to ensure linkages and sequencing of investments to promote the MF sector. These\nfunds will be used only to provide services through NGOs, and nearly half the proceeds will be\ntargeted  at  poor  women.  The  scope  and  utilization  of  MSDF  and  CIF  will  be  reviewed\nperiodically in consultation with ADB.\n\n5.\n\nPilot Risk Mitigation Mechanisms for the Poor as a Safety Net Measure\n\n79.\nAs a safety net measure, the Risk Mitigation Fund (RMF) was established (Appendix 10)\nin  SBP  with  initial  MFB  contribution.  RMF\u2019s  objective  is  to  reduce  risks  associated  with  failed\nIGAs, both farm and non-farm, of MFB clients. RMF will assist MFB borrowers, not MFB per se,\nin case of loss of IGAs (acquired through MFB loan) due to unforeseen circumstances beyond\ntheir control. RMF is expected to mitigate risks faced by about 27,000 poor during the MSDP.\nAssistance from RMF will be provided using a community-based participatory process where 75\npercent  of  the  CO  members  will  approve  assistance  from  RMF  to  any  individual.  Experience\nwith  community-based  risk  mitigation  mechanism  gained  by  RMF  will  provide  the  basis  for\nassessing the feasibility of actuarial-based insurance services for the poor.\n\n80.\nAlthough small in absolute amount, the value of the savings of the poor relative to their\nincome  is  considerable  and  therefore  needs  to  be  protected.  MFB  will  be  a  deposit-taking\ninstitution, both from its (poor) borrowers and also from nonborrowers. Given substantial paid-up\ncapital  and  viable  operations,  no  immediate  deposit  guarantee  is  considered  necessary.\nHowever, as a matter of precaution, the Deposit Protection Fund (DPF) was established in SBP\nto partially secure the savings mobilized by MFB (Appendix 11).33 This will provide assurance to\nthe poor of the safety of their savings. At the end of year 6 the DPF balance is expected to be\nabout 50 percent of MFB deposits. SBP, in consultation with ADB, will explore the possibility of\nconverting DPF into an actuarial-based system.\n\n81.\nMFB will contribute a part of its net profit to RMF and DPF. In addition, the Government\nwill  contribute  the  difference  between  the  borrowing  rate  and  the  relending  rate  to  RMF  and\nDPF on a recurring basis. An initial contribution of $5 million is expected from the Government\nfor both RMF and DPF.\n\n6. \n\nInitiate Restructuring of Development Finance Institutions\n\nTo  address  deep-seated  DFI  problems,  the  Government  prepared  a  DFI  restructuring\n82.\nplan that includes downsizing, liquidation, merger, and privatization to ensure efficient allocation\nof resources. While DFI reform supports the objectives of the MSDP, the reform of ADBP and\nFBC,  which  currently  serve  the  agriculture  and  rural  sectors,  is  more  significant  because  their\n\n                  \n\n33 Deposits of state-owned banks are implicitly guaranteed. No such cover is available for private sector banks. MFB\n\nwill be a majority private sector-owned bank during the MSDP.\n\n\f21\n\npolitically influenced operations act as deterrents to the entry of MFIs into the rural sector. The\nGovernment, as part of the MSDP, has decided to (i) initiate an irreversible process of closing\nFBC,  (ii)  provide  severance  pay  to  FBC  staff,  (iii)  conduct  a  portfolio  audit  of  ADBP,  and  (iv)\nprepare  a  restructuring  plan  for  ADBP.  In  the  meantime,  the  resource  support  from  SBP  to\nADBP or the provincial cooperatives, if any, has been indexed to the average rate of return on\nthe  Government  treasury  bills  to  ensure  financial  discipline  through  deposit  mobilization,\ndiligent credit appraisal, and better delinquency management.\n\nThese measures will help extend the financial sector reforms to DFIs and set the stage\n83.\nfor reform interventions for ADBP and the cooperatives by ADB, other development agencies,\nand  the  Government.  The  rural  financial  markets  will  be  strengthened  by  the  reformed\ninstitutions leading to an increased inflow of resources from the banking system in rural areas\nas  compared  with  the  current  net  outflow  of  resources.  Agriculture  lending  in  Pakistan  could\nincrease from the current level of 6.1 percent of agricultural GDP to 14-20 percent, as in other\nAsian countries.\n\nD.\n\nCapacity Building\n\n84.\nInadequate managerial expertise to run MFB and MFIs and inexperience of SBP in the\nMF  sector  development  indicate  the  need  for  capacity  building  interventions.  These  will  be\naddressed by (i) providing TA to SBP to design and implement a policy framework including a\nsupervisory  system  appropriate  to  smaller  MFIs;  (ii)  funding  consulting  services  to  help  MFB\nestablish  operating  systems  and  procedures,  training  systems,  and  product  pricing  and\npromotion;  identifying  measures  to  improve  social  mobilization  and  enhancing  the  impact  of\nservices on poverty reduction; and building a sound customer base; (iii) training CO members\nand  leaders;  and  (iv)  providing  assistance  to  new  MFIs  wishing  to  enter  the  MF  market.\nAssistance  is  also  needed  for  equipment  and  vehicles  to  ensure  the  mobility  of  MFB\u2019s  female\nstaff to reach out to poor women in remote areas.\n\nE.\n\nThe Investment Project\n\n1.\n\nObjective and Scope\n\n85.\nThe  Project\u2019s  objective  is  to  leverage  policy  actions  for  a  significant  poverty  reduction\nimpact.  Improvements  in  the  socioeconomic  status  of  the  poor,  especially  women,  will  be\nachieved by increasing investment, incomes, and employment. For this, support will be provided\nto expand outreach, enhance social capital, and strengthen institutions.\n\n86.\nThe  Project  scope  includes  (i)  a  credit  line  of  $68  million  equivalent  to  support\ninvestments in farm and nonfarm IGAs; (ii) community organization and skills development, with\nspecial  emphasis  on  women,  and  the  provision  of  basic  community  infrastructure;  and  (iii)\ninstitutional  strengthening  of  the  implementing  and  executing  agencies.  This  will  result  in  (i)\nMFB  having  significant  and  sustainable  financial  service  outreach,  (ii)  strengthened  social\nservice  providers  with  significant  outreach  capabilities,  (iii)  demonstration  of  effective  and\nefficient financial and social service delivery systems, and (iv) framework to support institutional\ndiversity in the sector.\n\n87.\nMajor financial features of the Project, include (i) a lending interest rate that ensures that\nthe  bulk  of  the  subproject  income  is  left  with  poor  households  for  consumption,  asset  buildup\nand  savings;  (ii)  a  lending  interest  rate  to  borrowers  that  will  meet  the  cost  of  financial\nintermediation;  (iii)  a  relending  rate  to  MFB  pegged  to  encourage  savings  and  commercial\n\n\f22\n\nborrowing;  (iv)  segregation  of  social  intermediation  and  financial  intermediation  costs;  (v)\nemphasis  on  savings  to  encourage  the  poor  to  save  profitably  in  an  accessible  and  secure\ninstitution; and (vi) a range of services, including leasing, delivered to communities. MFB, as an\nautonomous  institution  with  a  significant  private  sector  stake,  will  ensure  high  standards  of\ncorporate  governance  and  efficiency.  With  equity  investment  from  CBs,  MFB  will  pursue  a\ncommercially  oriented  path,  which  is  needed  to  develop  linkages  with  the  financial  sector,\naccess funds, and provide a broad range of financial services.\n\nFeatures to ensure that women have access to financial services are that (i) at least 40\n88.\npercent of the COs will be women-COs and 40 percent of MFB staff will be women; (ii) mobile\nunits  with  women  staff  will  operate  on  a  regular  basis  to  disburse  loans,  attend  to  savings\nwithdrawals, and collect deposits and loan repayments; and (iii) MFB will work closely with local\nauthorities  to  expedite  the  processing  of  identity  cards  for  women.  With  NGOs  and  women\nrepresented on the MFB board, social and gender aspects will be adequately addressed.\n\n89.\nThe  assured  source  of  funding  from  MSDF  and  CIF  will  strengthen  civil  society\nnationwide  with  positive  externalities,  particularly  those  related  to  gender.  Exclusive  use  of\nMSDF and CIF through NGO service providers with a defined participatory process (Appendix 8\nand  Appendix  9)  will  ensure  that  social  capital  buildup  with  due  emphasis  on  gender  aspects\nprecedes as well as accompanies access to MF. The risk of poor households will be mitigated\nwith assistance from RMF (Appendix 10). DPF (Appendix 11) will provide a measure of security\nfor  the  savings  of  the  poor.  The  Government  bears  the  foreign  exchange  risk  and  directs  the\nentire  project  investment  to  provide  unimpeded  and  sustained  assistance  to  the  poor.  All\ncounterpart funds will be provided as grants to MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF as the contribution of\nthe Government. In addition, the Government and MFB will make recurring contributions to RMF\nand DPF, and MFB will set aside 10 percent of its profit for social intermediation.\n\n2.\n\nComponents\n\na.\n\nOutreach Expansion\n\n90.\nMFB  will  access  a  credit  line  of  $68  million  equivalent  to  finance  the  requirements  of\nindividual subborrowers for farm and nonfarm IGAs to support the investment requirements of\n560,000  borrowers  at  the  end  of  year  6.  Forty  percent  of  the  potential  clients  will  be  women.\nTypical  activities  financed  include  farm  crops,  goat  rearing,  milch  cattle,  poultry,  cottage\nenterprises, small trading, rural transport, and mobile telephones, with an investment range of\n$150  to  $500.  The  estimated  investment  requirement  of  $166  million  will  be  funded  by\nsubborrowers ($25 million), ADB credit line, and the balance by MFB. The clients will be served\nby 7 control offices, 34 branches, and mobile units operated by 1506 staff.\n\nFirst-cycle borrowers of MFB will be those living below the poverty line. These borrowers\n91.\nare  expected  to  cross  the  poverty  threshold  with  successive  cycles  of  microcredit  and  regular\nsavings.  During  project  implementation,  MFB  will  operate  in  30  districts  comprising  5  million\nhouseholds  of  which  2.8  million  are  poor,  of  which  1.74  million  are  very  poor.  Selection  of\nbranch locations will be done through poverty classification of households with the assistance of\nlocal NGOs to  identify and  reach the poorest. MFB will follow the successful practice of using\nCOs to deliver services (Appendix 8, Figure A8) but will also give individual loans to borrowers\nwith  good  loan  records.  MFB  will  emphasize  savings,  initially  compulsory,  and  voluntary\nthereafter. The first cycle loans will not exceed $350. MFB will institute a full range of savings\nproducts and is expected to have about 80,000 nonborrower depositors by year six, in addition\nto the savings of 560,000 borrowers.\n\n\f23\n\nb.\n\nSocial Capital\n\n92.\n24,750  COs,  comprising  560,000  households,  will  be  organized    (Appendix  8)  in  a\nparticipatory  manner  through  NGO  service  providers  and  will  be  the  delivery  points  for  social\nand financial services. Forty percent of the COs formed will be women COs. Capacity building\nof  members  (560,000)  at  the  community  level  will  include  training  on  topics  like  social\nawareness,  community  mobilization,  empowerment  of  women,  selection  and  management  of\nIGAs, skills development, and basic numeracy. One activist (leader, organizer) from each CO,\nor  a  total  of  24,750  activists  will  attend  a  4-day  community  management  skills  training.  To\nenhance the participation of women, 12,412 women activists will attend a 3-day activist capacity\nenhancement course.  Further, 10 percent of women activists or a total of 1,240 members will\nattend  a  10-day  leadership  management  skills  training  course.  In  addition,  annual  2-day\nworkshops  for  all  CO  activists  will  be  held.  In  all,  1,409  workshops  will  be  held  during  project\nimplementation. CO members will be trained in the villages. CO activist and women's leadership\ntraining will be conducted where NGO facilities are available.\n\n93.\nThe formation and strengthening of COs will be contracted to NGOs (principally NRSP in\nthe  first year),  and a detailed  participatory process will be followed. The process (Appendix 8,\nFigure A8) involves (i) selection of service areas, based on village surveys, that will provide the\neconomic  and  social  profile  of  the  village  and  enable  a  poverty  ranking  of  households  into\ndestitute, poor, near poor, and nonpoor; (ii) a description of MFB services and procedures at a\npublic meeting; (iii) identification of activists within the village who will assist in mobilizing future\nCO members; (iv) a group decision to form a CO, appoint the president, and a CO activist; and\nregister  the  CO  with  MFB;  (v)  training  of  the  CO  activist;  (vi)  holding  of  at  least  six  meetings,\nusually at two-week intervals, during which CO members deposit savings in a CO account; (vii)\npreparation, by each member who wishes to borrow, of an investment plan, and agreement to\nthe loan size by at least 80 percent of members; (viii) appraisal and eventual loan decision by\nthe field officer of MFB; (ix) signing of the loan agreement by each borrower, witnessed by the\nCO president; and (x) disbursement of loan proceeds to borrowers.\n\n94.\nGrant financing for small-scale, community-level infrastructure subprojects (Appendix 9)\nthat benefit the poor will be provided on cost-sharing basis in underserved areas. Subprojects\nare mainly civil works including (i) roads and bridges to provide better access, (ii) farm irrigation\ninvestments,  (iii)  infrastructure  for  the  provision  of  clean  drinking  water,  (iv)  drainage  and\nsewerage,  (v)  schools,  (vi)  electrification,  (vii)  small  information  technology  kiosks,  and  (viii)\npublic telephone offices. Approximately 4,500 subprojects will be financed with CO contributions\nmaking up 40 percent and the balance from the CIF interest revenue.\n\n95.\nThe  participatory  process  (Appendix  9,  Figure  A9)  to  be  followed  for  CIF-funded\nsubprojects will involve (i) poor households identify infrastructure deficiencies, (ii) remedies are\ndiscussed with the service provider NGO during CO meetings, (iii) the CO with the help of the\nNGO prepares the investment plan, (iv) agreement of 80 percent of CO members is obtained,\n(v) the proposal is submitted to MFB, (vi) the CO deposits its share of cost with MFB, (vii) MFB\ndisburses CIF funds in the CO account, (viii) the NGO and CO jointly monitor subproject work\nand its completion, and (ix) the CO provides operation and maintenance of subprojects.\n\nc.\n\nInstitutional Strengthening\n\n96.\nThe  focus  of  this  component  is  on  developing  MFB\u2019s  capacity  to  efficiently  provide\nservices and developing SBP\u2019s capacity to take a proactive role in sector development. Training\n\n\f24\n\nof MFB staff will be provided using the Institute of Banking and Finance facilities in Islamabad.\nTraining  materials  will  be  developed  with  consultant  assistance  using  materials  available  from\nNRSP  and  international  sources.  Support  will  be  extended  to  (i)  MFB  to  acquire  office\nequipment and vehicles to enhance outreach, especially to enable women staff to access poor\nwomen in remote areas; (ii) transformation of two NGOs into regulated MFIs; and (iii) portfolio\naudit of ADBP.\n\n3.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n97.\nThe investment Project is estimated to cost $217.2 million equivalent, comprising $50.0\nmillion (23 percent) in foreign exchange costs and $167.2 million equivalent (77 percent) in local\ncurrency costs (Appendix 12).\n\nItem\n\nA.

This represents 42 percent of the investment cost excluding CO formation,\ncapacity  building  of  communities,  and  basic  community  infrastructure,  which  are  funded  by\nMSDF and CIF interest revenue. The loan proceeds and the SDF and CIF proceeds will finance\nthe  entire  foreign  exchange  component  of  the  Project,  including  the  interest  charges  during\nimplementation and part of the local currency cost, equivalent to $36.2 million. The provision of\nlocal currency cost is considered warranted from the perspective of the overall MSDP to ensure\nthat  sufficient  and  timely  funding  is  available  for  outreach  expansion  and  institutional\nstrengthening,  thereby  minimizing  the  risk  of  implementation  delay.  Country  considerations\njustify  the  provision  of  local  currency  cost  financing.  Concerted  efforts  have  been  made  to\n\n\f25\n\nmaintain domestic investment levels to sustain growth, but the country faces persistent budget\npressures, arising from the declining growth rates and fiscal imbalances during 1990s.\n\n99.\nThe  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  is  preparing  a  feasibility  study  in\nconsultation  with  ADB  to  strengthen  SBP  capacity.  The  Department  for  International\nDevelopment  of  United  Kingdom  has  also  expressed  interest  in  providing  parallel  support  for\nMFB capacity building. Capacity building support to MFB is also expected from the MicroStart\nProgram being planned by the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nTable 2: Summary of Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent\n\n43.8\n6.2\n\nAsian Development Bank\nMSDF and CIFa\nMicrofinance Bank\nSubborrowers\nGovernment\nTotal\nNote: Figures may not add up to totals in Appendix 12 due to rounding.\nCIF=Community Investment Fund, MSDF=Microfinance Social Development Fund.\na Foreign exchange financed from proceeds of the policy loan.\n\n36.2\n21.9\n74.1\n30.3\n4.7\n167.2\n\n50.0\n\n80.0\n28.1\n74.1\n30.3\n4.7\n217.2\n\n37\n13\n34\n14\n2\n100\n\n100.\nThe use of low cost funds from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for outreach expansion\nis justified because MFB\u2019s access to money markets will materialize over the medium term and\ndeposit  mobilization  will  build  up  gradually.  Market  borrowings  will  bear  high  premiums  until\nMFB establishes a track record. The resulting high lending interest rate will affect consumption\nand asset buildup of the poor households. In addition, access to assured resources will enable\nMFB to implement its business plan for sustainability, strengthen its financial position, and attain\nviability  as  early  as  possible.  Support  for  MFB\u2019s  start-up  and  expansion  costs  provide  the\npossibility  of  effecting  a  significant  poverty  reduction  impact.  The  low-cost  funds  enable\ncontributions to RMF, DPF, and support for social intermediation.\n\nF.\n\nSocial and Environmental Measures\n\n1.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n101.  By addressing multiple dimensions of poverty, the MSDP will have a significant poverty\nreduction  impact.  The  support  for  CO  formation  and  strengthening  will  reinforce  social  capital,\nwhile  helping  members  learn  that  they  can  save  money,  borrow  and  invest  wisely,  and  gain\nsome  control  over  their  lives.  Initial  and  regular  deposits  will  solidify  commitment.  These\nopportunities are especially significant for women, who in the past have had little opportunity to\ninteract with institutions external to their community. Women's membership in COs will enable\naccess  to  savings,  credit,  and  social  services,  and  lead  to  greater  social  and  economic\nempowerment.  The  increased  household  income  will  enable  the  poor  to  provide  better  health\ncare for their families, send more children to school, provide for better nutrition, and accumulate\na  cash  buffer  for  small  emergencies.  Through  their  participation,  NGOs  will  become  more\neffective  in  working  with  communities  leading  to  more  opportunities  for  expansion  and  greater\npoverty reduction impact.\n\n\f26\n\n2.\n\nEnvironmental Measures\n\n102.\nThe MFB will ensure that field officers and their supervisors are aware of environmental\nissues  associated  with  subborrower  investments.  This  will  be  achieved  through  (i)  an\nenvironment  unit  established  at  MFB  head  office  to  mainstream  environment  aspects,  (ii)  a\nmanual  prepared  on  environment  assessment  of  microcredit,  (iii)  inclusion  of  environmental\nawareness and assessment in the training courses for MFB staff, and (iv) environmental review\nof representative samples of subborrower investments during project reviews. In the field, when\nsubborrowers  discuss  their  proposed  investments  with  CO  members,  the  field  officers  will\nparticipate in the discussions to ensure members are aware of environmental aspects, and that\nthese are fully and satisfactorily taken into account in the eventual use of loan funds.\n\nV.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOANS\n\nA. \n\nThe Policy Loan\n\n1.\n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n\n103. A loan of  $70 million equivalent will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the Borrower). The loan will have a term of 24 years, including\na grace period of 8 years. An interest of 1 percent per annum will be charged during the grace\nperiod, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\n104. Use of low cost funds from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources is justified in support of policy\nreforms that addresses politically sensitive long-standing issues and socially significant measures,\nto enhance outreach to the poor. The fundamental shift in the approach is reflected in terms of (i)\nsustainable banking; (ii) private sector entry in banking with the poor; (iii) instituting mechanisms\nfor  social  capital  buildup,  especially  for  enhancing  outreach  to  women  and  their  empowerment;\n(iv) introduction of community-based risk mitigation measures; (v) NGO involvement in MF sector\ndevelopment; (vi) autonomy of the sector, and (vii) reforms, including closure, of DFIs. Policies will\nlink social capital build up with access to MF through a broad coalition of public, private and social\norganizations. Private sector investment has been brought in MF while ensuring support for social\nsectors where continued and direct Government involvement is warranted. Socially, the policy has\nplaced  women  at  positions  to  influence  the  direction  of  the  sector  development  and  will  give\nopportunities  to  the  poor  to  increase  household  income.  For  the  first  time,  the  poor  will  have\naccess  to  safe,  liquid  and,  remunerative  savings  facilities.  The  policy  actions  are  within  the\nframework of the Government\u2019s IPRSP ensuring sustainability and commitment.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\n  SBP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will  coordinate  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  on\n105.\nthe  policy  reforms.  SBP  has  established  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  within  the\nMicrofinance  Support  Division  at  SBP  headquarters  in  Karachi  (Appendix  13).  The  PMU  will\nhave at least two full-time staff, and will oversee both the program and investment components.\nThe  Consultative  Group  consisting  of  a  broad  array  of  stakeholders  will  ensure  wider\nconsultation  on  MF  policy-related  matters.  The  PMU,  in  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of\nFinance, will submit semiannual progress reports to ADB on the progress and issues relating to\npolicy implementation.\n\n\f27\n\n3.\n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n106.\nThe  policy  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items\nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  listed  ineligible  items  (Appendix\n14).  The  Borrower  will  certify  that  (i)  if  the  loan  proceeds  will  finance  goods  already  imported,\nthe  value  of  eligible  imports  in  the  period  concerned  will  exceed  the  amount  of  the  requested\nwithdrawal; or (ii) if the loan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of eligible imports\nin the immediately preceding one-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount of the\nrequested  withdrawal  plus  all  other  amounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  during  the  succeeding\none-year period. An audit of the use of the loan proceeds will be undertaken only upon ADB\u2019s\nrequest, provided that ADB retains the right to (i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of\nthe certification issued by the Borrower for each withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the\nborrower will open a deposit account with SBP in which all withdrawals will be deposited. The\naccount  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms  satisfactory  to\nADB.\n\n4.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n107.\nThe Government will use the counterpart funds for activities related to poverty reduction\n(paras. 42-44), among which social sectors and MF are key components. As part of the MSDP it\nhas been agreed that the Government will contribute the entire counterpart funds as a grant to\nMSDF ($40 million), CIF ($20 million), RMF ($5 million), and DPF ($5 million). The Government\nand ADB will monitor the use of counterpart funds.\n\n108.\nThe precise and monitorable dedication of counterpart funds through explicit expenditure\ncommitments  (i)  supports  ADB\u2019s  strategic  development  objective  for  poverty  reduction;  and  (ii)\nsupplements  the  policy  reforms  with  measures  to  enhance  social  capital,  which  is  the  most\ndesirable  and  necessary  use  of  resources  in  view  of  Pakistan\u2019s  low  social  indicators.34  Social\nequity  is  thus  ensured  in  the  use  of  program  funds.  Use  of  counterpart  funds  outside  the\nGovernment  budget  structure  and  keeping  it  fully  funded  from  the  beginning  to  meet  long-term\nrequirements is meant to (i) jumpstart the MF sector development, (ii) provide unimpeded support\nto  stakeholders  in  enlarging  the  MF  market,  (iii)  provide  a  nationwide  basis  for  the  NGOs  to\nemerge  as  efficient  social  service  providers,  (iv)  enable  flexibility  to  adapt  to  changing  sector\nrequirements,  and  (v)  ensure  effective  targeting.  The  Government  has  also  committed  to  make\nrecurring  contributions  and  the  MFB  has  been  mandated  to  set  aside  part  of  its  profit  for  social\nintermediation, risk mitigation, and deposit protection. The allocation of counterpart funds is in the\ncontext where resource requirement for poverty reduction is immense, and the Government has\nenhanced related spending by 25 percent in the budget for FY2001.\n\n109. Over 6 year period the revenue for MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF including the recurring\ncontributions are  estimated to  aggregate $50 million,35  or  about  $90  for  each  of  the  estimated\n560,000 MFB clients. Over 10 years, the aggregate revenue and recurring contributions will be\nabout $100 million thus providing a sustained basis for the poor to pursue social empowerment\nbeyond the project duration.\n\n                  \n\n34 1999 Human Development Index of the United Nations Development Programme ranks Pakistan 138th out of 174.\n35 Excluding the $70 million initial contribution from counterpart funds.\n\n\f28\n\n5.\n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n110.\nThe  policy  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $50  million\nequivalent  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness.  For  the  MSDP  to  be  effective  the\nGovernment must initiate certain administrative and policy actions in advance of the first tranche\nrelease  to  demonstrate  its  commitment  to  the  policy  reform  agenda.  In  recognition  of  this,  the\nGovernment has (i) adopted an MF development policy; (ii) enacted an MFB ordinance as part\nof  the  MF  policy;  (iii)  facilitated  the  establishment  of  MFB  as  an  autonomous,  privately\nmanaged, and fully capitalized institution designed to work in partnership with NGOs and COs;\n(iv)  established \nthe  Microfinance  Support  Division  with  Microfinance  Policy  Unit  and\nConsultative  Group  on  MF;  (v)  created  MSDF,  CIF,  RMF,  and  DPF  with  specific  rules  and\ncontribution  mechanisms  as  agreed  with  ADB;  (vi)  decided  to  close  FBC  and  commenced\npayment  of  severance  pay;  and  (vii)  indexed  the  cost  of  resource  support  to  ADBP  and\ncooperatives with the Government treasury bills.\n\n111. As a matter of additional precaution, the Government, on its own initiative, has decided\nto amend the SBP Act 1956 to enable SBP to become the custodian of MSDF, CIF, RMF, and\nDPF.  This  will  further  strengthen  autonomy  and  insulation  from  extraneous  interference  in  the\nintended usage of these funds over the long-term. The amendment has been approved by the\ncabinet.\n\n112. ADB  will  undertake  an  interim  review  of  the  MSDP  prior  to  the  release  of  the  second\ntranche.  The  second  tranche,  comprising  the  balance  of  the  policy  loan  of  $20  million\nequivalent, is expected to be released within 24 months of the effective date provided that (i) the\nframework  (para.  74)  to  enhance  institutional  diversity  in  the  MF  sector  is  prepared  in  a\nparticipatory manner, and adopted after ADB review, and SBP institutes a system to implement\nthe  framework;  (ii)  the  MFB  ordinance  is  reviewed,  and  if  required,  amended  to  incorporate\nrelevant features of the framework in consultation with ADB; (iii) take irreversible steps for the\nclosure  of  FBC  and  finalize  and  implement  a  redundancy  plan,  acceptable  to  ADB,  that\nadequately  compensates  the  laid-off  employees  in  conformity  with  applicable  laws  and\nstandards; and (iv) the portfolio audit of ADBP is completed and options for ADBP\u2019s institutional\nstrengthening discussed and adopted in consultation with ADB.\n\n113. Reforms  that  are  supportive  for  the  MF  sector  but  cannot  be  addressed  in  the  present\nframework such as the reforms to address imperfections in land markets and land distribution;\ninefficiency in irrigation and marketing of agriculture produce; and special efforts for tribals and\nbonded  labor,  will  be  addressed  through  policy  dialogue  and  follow-up  interventions,  provided\nMSDP objectives are met and outcomes achieved.\n\nB.\n\nThe Investment Loan\n\n1.\n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n\n114. A loan of $80 million equivalent will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the Borrower). The loan will have a term of 32 years, including\na grace period of 8 years. An interest of 1 percent per annum will be charged during the grace\nperiod, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\n\f29\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\na.\n\nProject Management\n\n115. SBP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  through  the  PMU  based  in  Karachi  (para.  105).  A\nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  in  MFB  (the  Implementing  Agency)  in\nIslamabad.  The  PMU  will  ensure  submission  of  periodic  reports;  arrange  for  audits  of  MSDF,\nCIF, RMF, and DPF; and review MFB\u2019s disbursement requests. Sound accounting and internal\ncontrol systems will be adopted by the PMU in the discharge of its expected role. Drawing on\nthe management information system of MFB, the PIU will submit information and analysis to the\nPMU and coordinate the fielding and work of consultants.\n\nb.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n116.\nThe Project will be implemented over six years, from 2001-2006 (Appendix 15). Prior to\nloan  effectiveness,  MFB  will  start  recruiting  and  training  staff,  begin  designing  products  and\nservices,  install  basic  financial  reporting  system  and  operating  procedures,  and  reach  a\npartnership agreement with NRSP.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n117. Procurement of goods and services will be subject to the provisions of ADB's Guidelines\nfor  Procurement.  Vehicles  and  office  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  for  packages  exceeding  $500,000  equivalent,  and  through\ninternational  shopping  procedures  for  packages  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent.\nFor packages below $100,000 equivalent direct purchase may be used.\n\n118. Using  MSDF  and  CIF  interest  revenue,  MFB  will  contract  out  the  major  part  of  CO\nformation,  all  CO  training,  and  implementation  of  community  infrastructure  projects  to  NGOs\nthat demonstrate competitive capability for this. The selection criteria for NGOs will be agreed to\nby ADB and the work will be awarded through a transparent process. Planning for CO formation\nwill be based on joint discussions between MFB and NGOs at the field and head office levels,\nand  be  subject  to  quarterly  reviews.  The  NGO  service  providers  will  be  hired  based  on\npartnership agreements that include gender outreach targets.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n119. A  total  of  66  person-months  of  international  and  37  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting  (Appendix  16)  services  will  be  required.  All  consultants  to  be  financed  from  the\nproceeds of the ADB loan will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. Consultants will be recruited by SBP for policy-related issues, and by MFB for all\nother purposes.\n\n5.\n\nFlow of Funds\n\nThe foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Borrower. SBP, as the representative of\n\n120.\nthe Borrower, will pass on the proceeds in the following manner (Appendix 17):\n\n(i) \n\nA credit line of $68 million equivalent will be provided by SBP to MFB in Pakistan\nrupee  based  on  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Loan\nrepayments will have a term of 20 years including a grace period for principal of 8\n\n\f30\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nyears  followed  by  12  years  principal  repayment  in  equal  installments  at  six-\nmonthly intervals.\n\nMFB can seek quarterly reimbursement from the ADB credit line on the basis of\namounts  disbursed  to  its  borrowers.  Within  the  overall  limit,  the  credit  line  will\nfund  80  percent  of  the  disbursements  in  the  initial  years  to  facilitate  outreach\nexpansion. The reimbursement request will be processed by SBP and submitted\nto  ADB  along  with  the  latest  operational  data,  audited  financial  statement,  and\ninspection report of SBP. On receipt of a request from SBP, the amount will be\ncredited to the designated account of MFB by ADB.\n\nOnlending  support  will  be  contingent  upon  MFB  meeting  key  performance\nindicators (Appendix 7, Table A7.3). In the event that MFB fails to meet most of\nthe  performance \nindicators,  provisional  eligibility  could  be  granted  upon\nsubmission  of  an  institutional  development  plan,  with  a  specific  time  frame  for\nimproving  performance,  acceptable  to  ADB.  SBP  will  monitor  the  progress\nsemiannually.\n\nThe  relending  rate  to  MFB  will  be  the  average  weighted  cost  of  deposits  in  the\nbanking  industry,  currently  7  percent,  calculated  periodically  by  SBP.  The\naverage cost of the immediately preceding half-year will apply. The Government\nwill  credit  the  difference  between  the  ADB  loan  rate  and  the  relending  rate  to\nRMF and DPF.\n\nMFB  will  onlend  to  subborrowers  at  an  interest  rate  to  recover  its  financial\nintermediation  costs  and  to  ensure  that  sufficient  surplus  is  left  with  the  poor\nhouseholds. The lending rate to subborrowers in the initial years is estimated at\n18 percent per annum.36 MFB will need to keep its costs down, as the poor will\nhave  to  bear  these.  The  large  equity  base  and  support  for  institutional\ndevelopment,  including  for  infrastructure,  will  cushion  start-up  costs,  especially\nthose  associated  with  expansion  in  remote  areas.  The  MSDF  interest  revenue\nwill  fund  social  intermediation  costs.  Continuous  monitoring,  performance\nbenchmarks,  and  audits  will  ensure  that  MFB  remains  a  lean  and  efficient\ninstitution,  does  not  take  advantage  of  operating  as  the  sole  provider  of  MF  in\nsome districts, and becomes financially viable in 4-5 years.\n\n(vi) \n\nFunds  for  equipment,  infrastructure,  training,  and  consulting  service  for  MFB,\nMFIs, and SBP, will be a grant from the Borrower using the loan proceeds.\n\n(vii)  MFB  will  periodically  submit  claims  to  the  Funds  Secretariat  for  reimbursement\nfrom MSDF and CIF with necessary documentation evidencing engagement and\ncompletion of services invoiced by NGO service providers. The Fund Committee\nwill  process  the  claims  and  reimburse  MFB  within  seven  days.  Reasons  for\ndelay, if any will have to be communicated to MFB.\n\n(viii)  MFB will periodically submit claims for assistance from RMF to the Microfinance\nSupport  Division  at  SBP  with  necessary  documentation.  Support  from  DPF  to\nguarantee  the  depositors  of  MFB  will  be  available  only  in  the  event  of  MFB\n\n36  Subject to vary with scale of operation, efficiency, conditions in the money market, etc.\n\n                  \n\n\f31\n\nliquidation.  In  this  event,  the  Microfinance  Support  Division  will  determine  the\nextent of coverage based on the DPF balance.\n\n6.\n\nManagement of MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF\n\n121. Good  governance  practices  have  been  incorporated  into  the  rules  governing  the  funds\ncreated as part of the MSDP. Each fund is governed by specific rules, formulated in consultation\nwith  ADB,  to  ensure  that  specified  objectives  are  achieved.  The  investment  of  the  principal\namount  will be undertaken by SBP  only in approved government securities; this is to ward off\nany speculative investments. The MSDF and CIF interest revenue will be credited by SBP into\ndesignated income accounts to be expensed out to meet the objectives of the respective funds.\nThe Fund Committee will manage the income accounts, and the administrative aspects will be\nhandled by the Fund Secretariat. The Fund Committee consists of the MFB president, one MFB\ndirector  and  one  SBP  nominee.  Authorized  signatories  will  operate  the  income  accounts.  All\npayments will be based on invoices and credited to the account of the NGO service providers\nafter  documentary  evidence  of  having  satisfactorily  completed \nthe  assignment.  The\nMicrofinance Support Division of SBP will manage RMF and DPF, and be responsible for their\ninvestment, management, and operation. All the funds and their usage will be annually audited\nby independent auditors and the reports will be made public.\n\n122. NGO service providers will need to meet criteria specified by the Fund Committee and\nenter into partnership agreements with MFB. The agreements will also indicate key performance\nindicators  including  formulation  of  COs  that  meet  gender  outreach  targets.  Community\nparticipation will enhance good governance. CIF support has been linked to 80 percent of the\nCO members agreeing to support the community infrastructure subproject and contribute part of\nthe  cost.  For  assistance  from  RMF,  three  fourths  of  the  CO  members  will  have  to  certify  the\nneed for assistance to an individual member and this will be validated by the MFB field officer.\n\n7.\n\nImprest Account\n\n123. One imprest account will be established by SBP in the National Bank of Pakistan after\nloan  effectiveness  and  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan Disbursement Handbook to  facilitate\ndisbursement  for  small  items  of  equipment  and  training  related  to  institutional  strengthening\n(project management, establishment of the MF framework, and ADBP audit). Operations of the\nimprest  account  must  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal  applications  and  related\ndocumentation. \nthe  statement  of\nexpenditure procedure will not exceed $50,000 equivalent.\n\nIndividual  payments  reimbursed  or \n\nliquidated  under \n\nThe capacity of SBP and MFB to prevent potentially corrupt practices will be enhanced\n124.\nthrough  effective  project  management  and  monitoring  to  ensure  that  bidders,  suppliers,  and\ncontractors observe the highest standards of ethics in procurement and execution.\n\n8.\n\nAnticorruption\n\n9.\n\nProject Reviews\n\n125. ADB  and  the  Government  will  periodically  review  project  implementation.  The  reviews\nwill  include  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  consultation  with\nNGOs  and  MFB  clients,  achievement  of  MFB  business  plans,  progress  with  the  policy  reform\nagenda, and capacity building measures. ADB will also field regular review missions, including\nmidterm and project completion review missions.\n\n\f32\n\n10.\n\nReports\n\n126.\nThe  PMU  will  submit  reports  to  ADB  concerning  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  project\nadministration, and financial management. The reports will include (i) quarterly, semiannual, and\nannual project implementation reports; (ii) a midterm review report; and (iii) a project completion\nreport to be submitted not later than six months after project completion. The reports will cover\n(i) expenditures, (ii) activities financed by MSDF and CIF, (iii) assistance provided by RMF, (iv)\nhighlights  of  audit  reports,  (v)  MFB  operations  and  financial  performance,  and  (vi)  training\nactivities and their impact. These aspects will be discussed in greater detail in the annual reports.\n\n11.\n\nAccounts and Audit\n\nThe Government will maintain separate records and accounts for the imprest funds and\n127.\nproject expenditure in accordance with sound accounting principles and will have such accounts\nand  records  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  will  ensure  that\nthe submission of project reports, audited accounts, and financial statements are in compliance\nwith  ADB's  revised  guidelines  introduced  in  1998.  Audited  annual  accounts  of  MFB  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB within six months of the reporting period. SBP will also provide a copy of its\ninspection report of MFB. MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF will be audited annually by independent\nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  auditor  will  also  carry  out  inspection  of  physical  activities.  In\nparticular,  the  following  consequence  for  noncompliance  was  highlighted:  (i)  suspension  of\ndisbursements, new contract awards, and replenishment of the imprest account if compliance is\ndelayed  by  more  than  9  months;  and  (ii)  suspension  of  the  loan  if  compliance  is  delayed  by\nmore than 12 months.\n \n\n12.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring System\n\n128.\nFor internal control and use by ADB and the Government, an information system will be\nestablished by MFB to provide monthly, quarterly, and annual computer-generated reports. The\ninformation  system  will  comprise  (i)  financial  reports  covering  loan  portfolio  growth  and\nperformance,  liability  growth  and  management  especially  of  savings  deposits,  and  financial\nperformance  indicators  concerning  earnings  and  liability  structures;  (ii)  details  concerning  the\nnumber of poor by gender, type of services, and the size of transactions; (iii) information on the\nperformance of staff measured by financial volume, number of customers, and earnings ratios;\n(iv)  information  showing  planned  levels  of  activities  against  actual;  (v)  annual  financial\nstatements;  and  (vi)  poverty  reduction  impact  of  services.  MFB  business  plan  will  provide  the\nfinancial performance benchmarks. The MFB will set up a website containing all its financial and\noperational information.\n\n129.\n Services of social science specialists will be contracted to carry out sample surveys and\nparticipatory  research,  analyze  data,  and  provide  a  written  report  for  use  by  the  Government\nand  ADB  on  the  social  and  gender  dimensions  of  the  Project.  These  will  be  carried  out  12\nmonths after the start of providing social and financial services, with another review two years\nafter this date, and a final review when MFB is carrying out its project completion review. With\nregards  to  social  capital  the  review  will  include  an  evaluation  of  the  cohesion  within  COs,\nincrease  in  capability  of  COs,  levels  of  participation  of  individuals  within  COs,  networking  of\nCOs, impact on family life and gender relations, quality of services provided by NGOs in social\ncapital formation, and the overall impact of the use of MSDF, CIF, and RMF. Concerning MFB\nas  an  institution,  the  reviews  will  evaluate  management  autonomy,  institutional  role  and\nstrategy,  organizational  structure,  credit  policy  and  procedures,  appropriateness  of  service\ndelivery  systems,  performance  measurement,  management  information  system,  and  training\n\n\f33\n\npolicies  and  programs  as  these  relate  to  furthering  the  social  agenda  included  in  the  MFB\nstatute.\n\nVI.\n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nExpected Impacts\n\n1.\n\nPrograms and Policies\n\n130.\nThe  MSDP  will  signal  the  resolution  of  the  Government  to  develop  the  MF  sector.  A\nfundamental  shift  will  occur  on  how  MF  is  perceived,  designed,  and  delivered;  this  will  extend\nthe frontiers of MF, particularly\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nthe development of a policy framework will help establish an MF system that will\ncatalyze  investments  to  augment  the  retail  capacity  for  significant  poverty\nreduction impact;\n\nthe  development  of  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  and  capacity\nenhancement  of  SBP  will  ensure  financial  soundness,  good  governance,\ntransparency, and appropriate systems and procedures in the MF sector;\n\nthe  opening  of  the  MF  sector  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  will  lead  to  an\norderly  and  systemic  development  of  the  sector,  and  NGOs  will  have  the\nopportunity to graduate into regulated financial institutions and be able to provide\na range of services;\n\nintegration  with  the  financial  system  will  bridge  the  demand  and  supply  gap  as\nthe retail capacity grows, and local financial intermediation will be enhanced; and\n\nthe  process  of  reforming  ADBP  and  cooperatives  will  be  initiated;  this  will\ncomplement banking reforms.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n131.\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the sample income generating activities\nranged from a sector high of 33/34 percent (agricultural crops and manufacturing/processing) to\na  sector  low  of  23  percent  (services  and  trade).  The  weighted  average  EIRR  was  27  percent.\nThe  EIRR  of  community  infrastructure  subprojects  ranged  from  a  high  of  36  percent  for  pond\nirrigation to a low of 21 percent for dugwells (Appendix 18).\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n132.\nThe range in enterprise internal rate of return is 23\u201360 percent, with a weighted average\nof  34  percent  (Appendix  18)  reducing  to  25  percent  after  allowing  for  enterprise  failure.  The\nprofiles show moderately attractive investments available to the rural poor. On average, the new\ninvestments  result  in  70  days  of  labor  creating  the  equivalent  of  400,000  full-time  jobs.  In\naddition, 1,506 jobs are created in MFB and 270 jobs in NGOs providing social services to the\nnew COs.\n\n133. Microfinance Bank. Projections over 10 years show MFB can become a viable financial\ninstitution in terms of being able to service liabilities and retain earnings sufficiently to maintain\n\n\f34\n\nthe  equity  base  (Appendix  7,  Table  A7.1  and  Table  A7.2).  By  year  6,  MFB  will  have  560,000\nborrowers  and  savers,  and  about  80,000  nonborrower  savers.  In  year  6,  the  net  worth  will  be\nPRs1,869  million  ($33  million),  deposits  PRs1,740  million  ($31  million),37  and  net  outstanding\nloans PRs7,430 million ($133 million). MFB is expected to break even at year 4. The capital to\nassets ratio of MFB is never less than 16 percent and the return on equity is 10 percent at year\n6 (Appendix 18, Table A18.1). Projections also indicate the viability of small- and medium-sized\nMFIs.  Small  MFIs  could  break-even  within  5  years  of  start-up  and  reach  about  25,000-30,000\nborrowers in 10 years.\n\n4.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\n134. An  initial  environmental  examination  was  made  of  50  typical  microenterprise  activities\nwith  the  results  grouped  into  seven  categories  to  determine  their  impact  on  the  environment\n(Appendix  19).  The  microenterprises  examined  have  a  small  or  no  significant  effect  on  the\nenvironment.  Holding  livestock  close  to  dwellings  constitutes  a  slight  but  acceptable  irritant.\nAnimal  feeds  will  largely  be  cut  and  carried,  and  supplemented  by  concentrates.  Agricultural\ncrop  financing  will  encourage  higher  value  crops  such  as  vegetables  with  less  deleterious\nimpact  on  soils  than  depletive  cereal  cropping.  Training  of  MFB  field  officers  and  their  regular\ndiscussions on environmental issues with CO members will mitigate any negative impacts.\n\n5.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n135.\nThe  development  and  strengthening  of  pro-poor  institutions  through  private-public\npartnership, will ensure that poverty reduction impact (Appendix 20) is felt beyond the life of the\nMSDP. At full implementation, MFB will provide access to 560,000 clients, about 9 percent of all\npoor households, of whom 225,000 will be poor women; and have sound prospects to expand\nits services. MFIs expected to be established during project implementation could add another\n20,000 clients.\n\n136. By instituting MSDF for social intermediation, the MSDP will enhance social capital with\nsignificant  externalities  to  the  local  economy.  Appropriately  designed  and  priced  MF  services\nthat take into consideration the asset and consumption buildup of households are expected to\nenhance  household  income  above  the  poverty  threshold  after  4-5  microcredit  cycles.  CIF  will\nprovide access to infrastructure for improving livelihoods through efficient and productive use of\nlocal resources with the involvement of local stakeholders. Risks of the poor households will be\nmitigated through RMF and DPF.\n\n137. Delivery  of  MF  services  in  partnership  with  NGOs  based  on  their  core  competency  in\nsocial  services  will  spawn  a  countrywide  efficient  and  flexible  arrangement  for  enhancing\noutreach  at  low  cost.  This  will  reduce  transaction  costs  to  the  poor.  Training,  research,  and\ndissemination  will  enhance  the  capacity  of  MFIs  and  NGOs,  and  thus  benefit  the  poor.  The\nbuilding  of  a  broad  coalition  of  NGOs  and  other  aid  initiatives  will  promote  stakeholder\ncoordination  and  lead  to  a  broadened  range  of  institutional  arrangements  that  will  act  as\nintermediaries for implementing MF components of ADB-funded projects.\n\n                  \n\n37 The potential for savings is higher than assumed. In many areas, MFB will be the only depository institution able\nto provide convenient and ready access to the poor. The mobilization of deposits, furthermore, is consistent with\nthe need for greater financial depth in the economy. Deposit mobilization of MFB is projected to reach PRs2,250\n($40) per borrower and PRs6,000 ($107) per nonborrower at year 6.\n\n\f35\n\nB.\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n1.\n\nPolicy Loan\n\nThe  MSDP  design  is  based  on  lessons  learned  from  successful  practices,  and  has\n\n138.\nstrong ownership by the Government and stakeholders. The following are identified risks.\n\n139. Delay  in  policy  reforms.  Effective  policy  dialogue,  stakeholder  coordination,  and\ncapacity  building  support  are  safeguards.  The  Government  has  demonstrated  strong\ncommitment to the reforms, and has already taken several measures as agreed with ADB. The\nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  ensure  efficient  resource  allocation  through  the  banking  system\nand its experience with banking reforms will ensure that DFI restructuring starts in earnest.\n\n140.\nLack  of  autonomy.  Despite  measures  to  ensure  autonomy,  private-public  partnership,\nand professional management, MFB may come under political pressure to disburse credit faster\nthan  its  capacity  allows.  MFB  ordinance  clearly  establishes  (i)  autonomy  of  the  board  of\ndirectors, (ii) no government official or member of political party is eligible to become a director,\nand  (iii)  SBP  will  be  the  supervisory  and  regulatory  authority.  Operations  in  partnership  with\nNGOs  will  ensure  that  social  mobilization  dictates  the  pace  of  service  delivery.  Furthermore,\nrules issued under the MFB statute will strengthen good corporate governance.\n\n2.\n\nInvestment Loan\n\n141. No  growth  in  income  of  poor.  Income  of  the  poor  may  not  increase  due  to  slow\nmacroeconomic growth and constrained market opportunities. Improved economic performance\nand pro-poor growth are expected as a result of IPRSP implementation. The Government has\nalso  speeded  up  the  macroeconomic  reforms.  In  addition,  as  part  of  the  social  intermediation\nprocess, clients will be advised on prudent economic choices.\n\n142. Marginalization of poor and women. Access of women to MF may remain below the\ntargeted 40 percent due to the slow pace of formation of COs, capacity building, and expansion\nof MFB branch network. Procedures to mainstream women\u2019s participation are an essential part\nof  the  MSDP  design.  The  MSDP  aims  to  address  both  economic  and  social  integration  as\nfollows: (i) MSDF and CIF will ensure adequate investments are made in social intermediation\nto enhance the absorptive capacity of the poor; (ii) 40 percent of the field staff of MFB will be\nwomen;  (iii)  mobility  constraints  will  be  addressed  through  vehicles;  (iv)  resource  support  for\nexpansion  of  MFB  will  ensure  that  it  establishes  its  presence  in  remote  areas  as  early  as\npossible;  and  (v)  collection  and  analysis  of  gender  desegregated  data  will  enable  continuous\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  the  MSDP  on  women  and  ensure  adjustments  as\nrequired. In addition, effective targeting of poor communities, participatory processes, screening\nof subprojects, small loan size, and pricing at above the CB-based lending rates will make MFB\nloans less attractive to nonpoor.\n\n143. High delinquency. MFB is most vulnerable to increases in loan losses and reductions in\nloan  revenues.  The  following  constitute  an  effective  safeguard  against  delinquency:  (i)\nsignificant  investment  in  capacity  building  of  MFB,  (ii)  adoption  of  successful  practices,  (iii)\nadequate  loan  loss  provisions,  (iv)  risk  mitigation  measures  to  help  borrowers  stabilize  their\nincome  flows,  (v)  adequate  training  and  capacity  building  of  clients,  and  (vi)  peer  pressure  to\nensure  repayments.  In  addition  MFB  will  have  a  sufficient  capital  base  to  bear  financial  risks,\nassured  support  for  social  intermediation  to  help  the  poor  to  effectively  use  financial  services,\nexpertise of the private sector, and partnership arrangements with NGOs.\n\n\f36\n\n144.\nImplementation delays. Capacity constraints of MFB might delay implementation. This\nwill be addressed by providing project implementation support to MFB and closely monitoring its\nperformance. Advance action for procuring consulting services has been approved. Delays due\nto  adjustment  to  the  system-wide  changes  expected  consequent  to  the  findings  of  the\nCommission  on  Transformation  of  the  Financial  System  (para.  40)  are  mitigated  through\ntechnical support to facilitate changes in operating procedures.\n\nVII.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n145.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  as\ndescribed in the development policy letter continue in effect during and after the\nMSDP.\n\nSubject to prescribed regulations that will include appropriate provisions of audit,\ntransparency,  and  disclosure  of  information,  MFB  will  have  complete  autonomy\nfor  disposal  of  assets,  pricing  of  financial  service  products,  appointment  and\ntermination of staff, and payment of salary and performance incentives to staff.\n\nIf  required,  the  MFB  ordinance  will  be  amended,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  to\nreflect  specific  features  of  the  framework  for  institutional  diversity  in  the  MF\nsector  to  be  developed  as  part  of  the  MSDP  (para.  74)  or  in  the  event  MFB\nbecomes  wholly  owned  by  the  private  sector.  The  MFB  ordinance  will  not  be\namended, or abrogated, if in the opinion of ADB, this will materially and adversely\naffect MFB\u2019s performance.\n\nThe equity of the two state-owned CBs in MFB will not be acquired by any other\ngovernment institution after their privatization.\n\nMFB will promptly inform ADB of any change in its board of directors or its senior\nmanagement  team,  and  ensure  that  any  such  change  will  be  made  in\naccordance with the provisions set forth under specified regulations.\n\nIn case of natural calamities and unforeseen circumstances that affect the equity\nand  liquidity  of  MFB,  ADB  will  be  consulted  immediately  and  a  remedial  action\nplan prepared within three months thereafter.\n\n(vii) \n\nPursuant to amendment to the SBP Act 1956 the rules as agreed with ADB for\nthe management and operations for MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF will be adopted.\n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  strengthen  the  activities  of  SBP,  and  assist  the  private\nsector  in  identifying  and  promoting  small  MFIs,  and  will  ensure  resources  are\nprovided to SBP and MFB in a timely manner.\n\n\f37\n\nVIII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n\n146.\nADB, and recommend that the Board approve:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights of 54,114,000\nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Microfinance  Sector  Development\nProgram, with a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and\n1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are\nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement\npresented to the Board; and\n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights of 61,845,000\nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Microfinance  Sector  Development\nProject, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and\n1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are\nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement\npresented to the Board.\n\n          TADAO CHINO\n\n         President\n\n17 November 2000\n\n\f38\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nDevelopment Policy Letter and Policy Matrix\n\n             39 \n\nProgram Framework\n\nSector Indicators\n\n          Page\n                          (page, para.)\n\n     Cited on\n\n             47\n\n                         52\n\n             1, 3\n\n 1, 3\n\n 1, 3\n\nSocial Dimension of Poverty\n\n             54\n\n3, 10\n\nNational Rural Support Program\n\n             56                   6, 22\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n                         57\n\n          12, 47\n\nMicrofinance Bank\n\n             58                 18, 71\n\nMicrofinance Social Development Fund\n\n             65\n\n          19, 76\n\nCommunity Investment Fund     \n\n             69                 19, 77\n\nRisk Mitigation Fund\n\nDeposit Protection Fund\n\nCost Estimates\n\nProject Organization Chart\n\nIneligible Items\n\n             72                 20, 79\n\n             74\n\n          20,  80\n\n             76\n\n          24,  97\n\n             78                26,  105\n\n             79                27,  106\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n                         80                29,  116\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services             81\n\n          29, 119\n\nFlow of Funds \n\n             84                29,  120\n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis\n\n             85                33,  131\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\n             88\n\n          34, 134\n\nPoverty Impact Assessment\n\n             89                 34, 135\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis \u2013 Tables\n\nDetail Cost Tables\n\nDetail Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\n\nAssessment of Microfinance Sector in Pakistan\n\nProfile of Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund\n\nFinancial Analysis of Microfinance Bank \n\nFinancial Analysis of Microfinance Institution\n\n 1\n\n   2\n\n   3\n\n   4\n\n   5\n\n   6 \n\n   7\n\n   8\n\n   9\n\n 10\n\n 11\n\n 12\n\n 13\n\n 14\n\n 15\n\n 16\n\n 17\n\n 18\n\n 19\n\n 20\n\n  A\n\n  B\n\n  C\n\n  D\n\n  E\n\n  F\n\n  G\n\n\f..~... \n--\"  .:.~..1\\~ \n\n, \n\n,.\n\n39\n\nAppendix \n\n1,  page  1\n\nDEVELOPMENT  POLICY  LETTER\n\nISLAMABAD\n\nNov. \n\n4,  2000\n\nD.O.  No.  11777-AFS(F)/2000\n\nPAKISTAN\n\nPakistan:  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Program\n\nDear  Mr.  President,\n\nThe  structural \n\nreforms  undertaken  by  the  Government \n\n1. \nin  some\nencouraging  signs.  Real  gross  domestic  product  grew  by  4.5  percent  during  2000  as  against  3.2  percent\nthrough\nof  the  previous  year.

Services provided at affordable prices will have a significant poverty\nreduction impact and thereby (i) increase incomes of poor households; (ii) enhance outreach, especially to women; (iii) build social capital; and (iv) reduce the risks\nfaced by the poor.\n\nTo achieve this, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan will initiate policy actions for the development of the MF sector. These include (i) developing an\nenabling policy framework for MF development; (ii) facilitating the establishment of a Microfinance Bank (MFB); (iii) developing an enabling framework that incorporates\nlegislative, supervisory, and regulatory aspects to facilitate and encourage the emergence of microfinance institutions (MFIs); (iv) establishing mechanisms to enhance\nsocial capital; (v) piloting risk mitigation mechanisms for the poor as a safety net measure; and (vi) initiating measures to restructure development finance institutions\n(DFIs).\n\nA. Develop Enabling Policy Framework for Microfinance Development\n\nApprove and adopt a\nconducive policy\nframework for MF.\n\nThe Government has adopted a policy for the\npromotion of the MF sector that: (i) encourages\nemergence of MFIs to increase outreach to the poor\nand the excluded, especially poor women; (ii)\nrecognizes the need to direct investments to build\nsocial capital and to mitigate risks faced by the poor;\n(iii) promotes linkages between MFIs specializing in\nfinancial intermediation and NGOs with core\ncompetency in social intermediation to provide\nfinancial and nonfinancial services to individuals, as\nwell as groups; (iv) promotes public-private\npartnerships and private sector initiatives, especially\nthe enhanced role of NGOs; and (v) improves the\nprofile of MF among policymakers, with SBP taking\na proactive role in establishing financial\ninfrastructure to support MF development and in\nintegrating MF with the broader financial system.\n\nMajor reforms in the banking\nsector and capital markets with\nthe support of the World Bank\nand the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) have resulted in\nmarked improvement in the\npolicy environment. The\nongoing reforms will be\nbroadened in scope to\nincorporate issues concerning\nMF to (i) advocate the\nsignificance of MF, (ii) provide\nan environment flexible\nenough to accommodate a\nrange of institutions, (iii) define\nthe role of state and the central\nbank to promote MF sector\ndevelopment with private\nsector participation, and (iv)\ncoordinate delivery of social\nand financial services to\nextend outreach to the poor.\n\nThe Government will\nreview the policy\nperiodically in\nconsultation with ADB in\nthe context of the\nongoing financial sector\nreforms, and to ensure\nbetter linkages with\npoverty reduction and\ngender development\nprograms.\n\nThe Government and\nADB will discuss sector\nissues and means to\naddress them within the\nscope of the MSDP.\n\n4\n2\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n4\n\n \n\n\fObjectives\n\nRationale\n\nFirst Tranche/Actions Complied\nMay to October 2000 period\n\nB. Facilitate Establishment of Microfinance Bank\n\nFacilitate the\nestablishment of\nMFB to provide\naffordable and\nsustainable services\nto the poor.\n\nLess than 5 percent of the\npoor households have access\nto affordable MF services that\ncould enable them to increase\nand diversify household\nincome. In this early stage of\nthe MF sector in Pakistan,\nmore institutions are required\nto bridge the demand and\nsupply gap for MF. The\nrestructured commercial banks\nand DFIs will primarily target\nthe upper and middle segment\nof the market. Retail capacity\nfor delivery of MF therefore\nneeds to be augmented\nimmediately to provide access\nto affordable services for\npoverty reduction.\n\nThe Government has promulgated an ordinance for\nthe establishment of MFB incorporating the core\nattributes of the MF policy statement to facilitate\nbanking with the poor. The statute provides for (i)\nautonomy to develop, market, and service products\non a sustainable basis; (ii) exclusive focus on the\npoor; (iii) gender emphasis; (iv) operational flexibility\nto provide services through and/or in partnership\nwith NGOs; (v) broad-based equity participation\nreflecting private-public ownership; (vi) a\nprofessional board of directors with representation of\nwomen; (vii) delegation of rules and regulation-\nmaking power to board of directors; (viii) eligibility to\nraise resources from the financial market; and (ix)\nSBP as the regulatory and supervisory authority.\n\nTo operationalize MFB: (i) equity investments have\nbeen made by private and public entities, (ii)\ninvestors have nominated a professional private\nsector-led board of directors with three NGO\nrepresentatives, including two women, (iii) the board\nof directors have established rules based on the\nrecognized principles of good corporate governance\nand this has been approved by SBP, (iv) SBP has\nformulated a supervisory and regulatory framework\nfor MFB, and (v) MFB has commenced operations in\npartnership with NGOs.\n\nWithin 24 Months of\nRelease of First Tranche\n\nOther Program\nActions\n(2001\u20132006)\n\nThe MFB will achieve\nperformance targets set\nby its board of directors\nand detailed in its\nbusiness plan.\n\nThe MFB will provide MF\nservices to women clients\n(40 percent of clients as of\nDecember 2001 and\n2002) and recruit women\nstaff (40 percent of the\nstaff as of December 2001\nand 2002).\n\nThe outcome of the\nexternal review of the\nMFB and select NGOs\nat the end of first year,\nat midterm and at\nproject end will be\ndiscussed with ADB to\nassess the impact of\nMSDP and the need, if\nany, to make design\namendments.\n\nMFB board of directors\nwill consider capital\nmarket listing in\nconsultation with SBP\nand ADB.\n\nC. Develop a Framework for Institutional Diversity in the Microfinance Sector\n\nDevelop the MF\nsector to efficiently\nprovide a range of\naffordable financial\nand social services\nto the poor.\n\nThe existing MF retailers,\nincluding MFB, are projected\nto provide access to less than\n20 percent of the poor\nhouseholds in the next 6\nyears. Conditions therefore will\nhave to be created to\nencourage entry of more\ninstitutions in the sector. The\n\nSBP has created a Microfinance Support Division at\nits head office in Karachi, and established a\nMicrofinance Policy Unit with a Consultative Group\nwith key stakeholder representatives. The\nMicrofinance Policy Unit will initiate a study to\nenlarge the MF sector to enhance institutional\ndiversity, encourage financial intermediation at the\nlocal level, and promote linkages between banks\nand NGOs. The study will also assess the structural\n\nAdoption of legislation\nand/or amendments to\nexisting statutes, and\ncorresponding regulations\ncovering the following: (i)\ndefinition of MFI\ncategories and their\nlicensing and registration;\n(ii) regulatory and\n\nMFB will consider a\nwholesale window for\nNGOs with good track\nrecord and\nsubstantive interest in\nMF in consultation with\nthe Government, SBP,\nthe Microfinance\nGroup of Pakistan, and\n\n4\n3\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n5\n\n \n\n\fObjectives\n\nRationale\n\nFirst Tranche/Actions Complied\nMay to October 2000 period\n\nWithin 24 Months of\nRelease of First Tranche\n\nand operating requirements of MFIs, corresponding\nregulatory and supervisory framework, and the need\nfor a second-tier regulatory agency for MF.\nParticipatory process and wide stakeholder\nconsultation will be ensured.\n\n legal,\n\ndesign features and the\nfinancial infrastructure created\nto support MFB could be\nadopted to develop a\nframework(cid:190)\nsupervisory, and\nregulatory(cid:190)\nattributes of the MF policy to\npromote institutional diversity\nin the MF sector.

The relending rate will be\nbased on the average weighted cost of deposits in\nthe banking industry.\n\nMFB is required to contribute up to 5 percent of its\nnet profit to RMF and DPF. The Government is\ncommitted to contribute funds equivalent to $5\nmillion each in RMF and DPF.\n\nThe disadvantages of poor\nhouseholds include lack of\naccess to financial services,\nunfair terms of participation in\nthe local economy, and\nvulnerability to economic and\nphysical downturns. Poor\nhouseholds forego potentially\nviable technologies, production\nchoices, and income\nopportunities due to risk\naversion. Mechanisms to cope\nwith and mitigate such risks\nare not accessible to the poor.\n\nThough small in absolute term\nthe value of savings of the\npoor households relative to\ntheir income is high. Security\nfor small savings therefore,\nprovides much needed\nassurance to the poor. No\nsuch deposit protection facility\nis currently available.\n\nSBP, MFB, and ADB\nwill explore the\npossibility of MFB\njoining a deposit\ninsurance scheme,\nwhen available in\nPakistan.\n\n4\n5\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n7\n\n \n\n\fObjectives\n\nRationale\n\nFirst Tranche/Actions Complied\nMay to October 2000 period\n\nF.

The SBP will\ndetermine the delegation of FBC functions to\nappropriate agencies.\n\nThe Government has issued instructions to apply\nthe average treasury bill rate for resource support, if\nany, provided to ADBP and to the provincial\ncooperative banks by SBP.\n\nThe SBP and ADB will\nreview the performance\nof the cooperative\nsector consequent to\nFBC closure.\n\nThe  Government  will\napprise  ADB  of \nthe\nperformance of ADBP.\n\nMost of the DFIs have a legacy\nof decades of poor\nperformance, weak financial\nstatus, and adverse public\nimage. The ongoing reforms in\nthe financial sector have\ntherefore been extended to\ncover the DFIs as well. The\ntransformation of the DFIs is\nthe medium- to long-term goal\nof the Government. The reform\nof the Federal Bank for\nCooperatives (FBC) and the\nAgricultural Development Bank\nof Pakistan (ADBP) are,\nparticularly important as their\ninstitutional weaknesses and,\nespecially, weak credit\ndiscipline undermines the\nexpansion of the MF sector in\nthe rural areas where the\nmajority of the poor live.\n\nThe Government will\ninitiate an irreversible\nprocess for the closure of\nFBC. A compensation\nplan for laid-off employees\nin conformity with\nprevailing applicable laws\nand service conditions of\nFBC will be prepared and\ncompensation paid.\n\nThe SBP will complete a\nportfolio audit of ADBP to\nassess the magnitude of\nnonperforming loans in\nterms of internationally\naccepted standards.\n\nThe Government will\nprepare a plan of action\nfor restructuring ADBP to\naddress the core issues of\nautonomy, governance,\nand viability.\n(December 2001)\n\n4\n6\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n \n8\n\n\fDesign\nSummary\n\n1.

About 44 million or 33 percent of the population live in poverty. Three fourths of the poor\nlive  in  rural  area.  The  average  family  size  is  seven  people.  The  level  of  poverty  is  nearly  45\npercent1  when  it  is  recognized  as  a  multidimensional  phenomenon  including  affordability  of\neducation,  health  care,  clean  water;  plus  opportunities  for  good  jobs,  security,  political,  and\nsocial  freedom.  Households  headed  by  women,  those  with  many  dependents,  those  in  rural\nareas  with  no  livestock,  and  single  earner  households  in  urban  areas  are  among  the  poorest.\nPakistan  ranks  138th  among  174  countries  in  the  terms  of  the  human  development  index  of\nUnited Nations Development Programme.\n\nUrbanization was very rapid after the creation of Pakistan in 1947. Seasonal migration is\n2.\ncommon  and  migrants  retain  strong  ties  to  their  family  homes  in  the  countryside.  Industrial\ngrowth, led by a small group of large-scale private manufacturers with close ties to banks and\ngovernment who promoted mechanization, attracted many laborers to the growing cities. Capital\nhas accumulated in a few large urban centers. Urban society remains stratified with a small elite\nand masses, similar to that traditionally found in the countryside.\n\n3.\nIn  rural  areas,  people  live  in  villages  of  50  to  3,000  households.  They  are  landlords,\ntenant farmers, artisans, or landless laborers.  Landlords, classified by the size of their holdings,\nare  the  social  and  economic  elite.  Sharecroppers  contribute  only  labor  and  keep  25  to  33\npercent of the crops. Sharecropper-tenants share the cost of production, contribute labor, and\nreceive 50 percent of the output. Both are generally poor. Those who lease land (25 percent of\ntenants)  may  be  better-off,  provided  that  rent  is  not  excessive.  Artisans  provide  traditional\nservices  to  communities  and  are  frequently  poor.  Landless  laborers  are  the  poorest,  and  by\nvirtue  of  being  in  debt  to  landowners  may  be  obliged  to  labor  on  their  lands\u2014as  bonded\nlaborers\u2014to try to pay their ever-increasing debts.\n\n4.\nThe  family  system  is  the  basis  of  rural  life.  It  defines  individual  identity,  social  status,\npolitical role, and economic level often including occupational category. It is defined by men, so\nfamily  membership  is  inherited  through  men,  and  women  move  from  their  natal  family  to  their\n\u201creal\u201d  family  upon  marriage,  often  in  their  early  teens.  Women  live  as  much  as  possible  in\npurdah, and have limited social and economic interaction. Early in life, they internalize attitudes\nthat  contribute  to  perpetuation  of  this  system  and  generally  accept  this  as  culturally  and\nreligiously  appropriate.  For  many,  the  notion  that  they  might  exercise  public  choice  is  remote,\neven though they may attain considerable influence within the family, especially later in life.\n\n5.\nWomen\u2019s lives focus primarily on the domestic realm where they work long hours every\nday  to  care  for  the  men,  children,  elderly,  and  sick,  and  do  the  cooking,  cleaning,  washing,\nmending,  water  carrying,  and  so  on.  Rural  women  also  make  significant  contributions  to\nagricultural  work  (planting,  weeding,  watering,  harvesting,  and  preserving)  and/or  earn  small\namounts of money through livestock raising, selling eggs or milk, embroidery, and other crafts\nthat  can  be  worked  on  as  time  is  available.  These  are  rendered  more  difficult  in  absence  of\nbasic  infrastructure  such  as  drinking  water,  sanitation,  rural  roads,  and  irrigation.  Their\neconomic  contributions  are  misunderstood  and  underreported.  Women  in  urban  centers  have\nbetter  access  to  services  and  may  become  teachers  or  doctors,  but  opportunities  to  work\ndepend upon the opinions of their parents-in-law. Nuclear households are increasingly common\n\n1 Mahbub Ul Haq Centre for Human Development.1999. A Profile of Poverty in Pakistan. Islamabad.\n\n                  \n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 4, page 2   \n\nin cities as well-to-do women seek to establish their own homes where they can exercise some\nauthority earlier in life.\n\n6.\nWomen  are  poorer,  less  healthy,  and  less  educated  than  men.  The  60-year  life\nexpectancy  of  women  is  the  same  as  men,  making  Pakistan  one  of  the  very  few  countries\nwhere women do not outlive men. Only about half of the rural population have access to clean\nwater  and  only  20  percent  have  access  to  proper  sanitation  facilities.  Literacy  and  school\nenrollment  rates  for  girls  and  women,  especially  in  rural  areas,  are  significantly  lower  than  for\nmen and compare unfavorably with most of the world. In many rural areas less than 10 percent\nof  women  are  literate.  Women  suffer  chronic  malnutrition  and  anemia  because  of  frequent\nchildbearing.\n\nOver  80  percent  of  farmers  have  less  than  5.0  hectares  of  land,  thus,  demand  for\n7.\nseasonal  labor  is  minimal.  Deforestation  of  upland  areas  has  caused  soil  erosion,  which  has\ncontributed  to  clogged  reservoirs  and  irrigation  systems,  and  increased  risk  of  flooding,\nwaterlogging, and soil salinity. Work traditionally done by some artisans is increasingly replaced\nby  new  technologies  as  well.  Most  rural  families  have  added  secondary  occupations  or\nbranched out from traditional roles into related work. Rural-urban migration has been continuous\nfrom the 1960s onward and is now about 1.3 percent per year.\n\nThe  poor  seek  opportunities  in  animal  husbandry,  small-scale  manufacturing,  food\n8.\nprocessing, and labor and services for cash. Information about distant markets and new forms\nof activity is scarce, and the risk entailed in starting little known enterprises is simply too high for\nthose with few assets and many dependents. Difficulty in obtaining credit further restricts their\noptions.  Both  resources  and  facilities  to  acquire  skills  to  diversify  into  new  activities  are\ninadequate. No effective risk mitigation mechanism is accessible to the poor. Illiteracy adds to\ntheir disadvantages.\n\nThe  poor  need  cash  for  consumption  as  well  as  for  investment.  Events  like  illness,\n9.\nespecially of a working man, provision of dowry for marriage of a daughter, damage to homes or\nlands  from  monsoon  rains,  food  shortages,  and  funeral  expenses  present  special  challenges.\nSmall  loans  can  be  taken  for  short  periods  from  friends,  relatives,  and  neighbors,  but  several\nmay  be  required  to  meet  one  expense  and  social  obligations  may  be  weighty.  Loans  are\ncommonly  taken  from  agricultural  commission  agents  who  return  at  harvest  to  accept  in-kind\nrepayment.  Prices at harvest are the lowest, and agents may insist upon prices as much as 35\npercent lower to cover their costs, leaving farmers with little to live on during the next season.\nThe  poor  rarely  borrow  from  moneylenders  who  require  tangible  assets  like  land,  jewelry,\nlivestock, or homes.  Interest rates are at least 50 percent per annum plus use of the mortgaged\nasset. Loans from landlords may lead entire families into bonded labor for generations. Women\nwith no assets such as jewelry from their marriages and, typically, no identification card, have\nan extremely difficult time securing loans, especially from official sources.\n\n10.\nRecent  efforts  to  develop  microfinance  have  revealed  significant  demand  for  both\nsavings and credit services. The poor are concerned with quality as well as the cost of services.\nThey  want  small  loans  that  are  easy  to  obtain,  to  invest  in  feasible,  local  income-generating\nactivities. They want to save and repay in frequent small sums, preferably without incurring cost\nfor travel in the process. As women are rarely able to travel to banks located in towns, mobile\nservices,  sometimes  organized  by  the  nongovernment  organizations,  are  especially  important\nfor  them.  However,  such  nongovernment  organizations  are  very  few.  While  demand  for\nmicrofinance  is  high,  its  poverty  reduction  impact  is  constrained  due  to  lack  of  supporting\ninvestments in skills development, women empowerment, and basic infrastructure.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 5\n\nNATIONAL RURAL SUPPORT PROGRAM\n\n1. \nThe  National  Rural  Support  Program  (NRSP)  was  established  in  November  1991  as  a\nnongovernment organization (NGO) and registered under the Companies Ordinance of 1984 to\nundertake  development  activities  in  the  rural  areas  of  Pakistan.  NRSP\u2019s  operations  cover  28\ndistricts in all four provinces, and Azad Kashmir. NRSP is now the largest NGO in the country,\nwith 15 regional offices that coordinate the activities of field unit offices. NRSP aims to foster a\ncountrywide network of community organizations (COs) at the grassroots level. Through these\nCOs,  rural  communities  are  able  to  plan,  implement,  and  manage  their  development  plans\nindependently  for  the  purpose  of  ensuring  productive  employment,  poverty  reduction,  and\nimprovement in quality of life.\n\n2. \nCOs  comprise  community  members  from  25  to  30  households  who  meet  regularly  to\ndiscuss issues, construct plans, and arrive at decisions by consensus. As of June 1999, NRSP\nformed 5,224 male COs, 1,975 all-women COs, and 625 COs with mixed membership. Of the\ntotal membership of 192,903, about 50,000 were women. COs involved in credit and enterprise\ndevelopment  numbered  5,056.  As  of  end  1999,  NRSP  had  disbursed  PRs1.78  billion  ($32\nmillion)  to  106,720  accounts,  with  an  average  credit  size  of  PRs16,657  ($297).  There  are\n45,000 outstanding loan accounts. The repayment rate was 94 percent. Savings mobilized from\nmembers  amounted  to  PRs235  million  ($4.2  million).1  Along  with  credit  NRSP  offers  training\ncourses, such as for managerial, technical, vocational, refresher, social, and gender aspects to\nenhance skills of the CO members to enable them to use their human capital more efficiently. Of\nthe total 49,988 persons trained by June 1999, 12,235 were females.\n\nNRSP  also  assists  CO  members \n\nto  enhance  agricultural  productivity \n\n3.\nthrough\ndemonstrations  and  training.  It  encourages  and  assists  them  in  obtaining  better  varieties  of\nseeds,  fruits,  forest  plants,  and  livestock.  It  promotes  improved  methods  of  vaccination  of\nanimals,  sowing  of  seed,  and  plantation  management.  Most  of  these  activities  are  undertaken\nthrough  linkages  with  the  Government  line  departments.  A  total  of  646,594  households  have\nbenefited  from  natural  resource  management  activities.  NRSP  helps  COs  to  establish  and\nmanage physical infrastructure such as drinking water supply schemes, link roads, bridges, and\nlining of irrigation channels. The CO shares the cost by providing labor and other inputs in kind\nand operates and maintains the project after completion. A total of 1,961 schemes have been\ncompleted benefiting 41,691 households.\n\nNRSP has supported COs to establish and manage non-formal primary schools. NRSP\n4.\nbears part of the cost and provides teachers training. NRSP also trains CO members as health\nworkers, and fosters linkages between COs and service delivery agencies of the Government,\nNGOs,  and  the  private  sector  for  primary  health  care  and  reproductive  health.  Community\nschools established number 233, with 345 teachers and 8,541 students.\n\n5.\nNRSP  received  an  endowment  of  PRs500  million  ($9  million)  from  the  Government  to\ncover cost of operation. It reported a net surplus before tax of PRs36 million ($0.64 million) for\n1999.  NRSP  obtained  a  credit  line  from  a  commercial  bank  at  a  markup  of  14  percent  per\nannum  to  finance  its  credit  operations.  NRSP  charges  18  percent  markup  for  its  microcredit\noperations. While costs have not been desegregated, NRSP incurs a net loss on its microcredit\noperations.\n\n                  \n\n1  These however, cannot be recycled as loans and have to be deposited with a commercial bank. Like other NGOs,\n\nNRSP is not a deposit taking institution under the banking law.\n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR\n($ million)\n\nAgency\n\nAsian\nDevelopment\nBank\nWorld Bank\n\nUnited  Nations\nDevelopment\nProgramme\n\nSwiss  Agency\nfor\nDevelopment\nCooperation\n\nCanadian\nInternational\nDevelopment\nAgency\nDepartment for\nInternational\nDevelopment\n\nNetherlands\nDevelopment\nAssistance\n\nInternational\nNGOs\n\nProject\n\n  Bahawalpur Rural Development Project\n  Dera Ghazi Khan Rural Development Project\n  Malakand Rural Development Project\n  Pakistan Poverty Fund Project\n\n  Women in Urban Credit\n  National Rural Support Program\n  Area Development Program\n  Area Development Program, Balochistan\n  Northern Areas Development Project\n\n  Small Scale Enterprise Promotion Program\n  NGO Project\n  Leasing to Micro and Small Enterprises\n  Krakoram Handicraft Development Program\n  Community Services Project\n  Canada Fund\n\n  Faisalabad Area Upgrading Project\n  Aga Khan Rural Support Program\n  Alternative Income Generating Project\n\n  Participatory Rural Development Project\n  Living Standards for the Poor\n\n  Asia Foundation\n  NOVIB\n  Trust and Voluntary Organization\n\nProject\nOutlay\n$38.0\n$36.0\n$41.0\n$90.0\n\n$1.5\n$12.0\n$5.0\n$0.6\n$4.7\n\n$0.54\n$1.68\n$0.30\n$0.12\n$0.20\n\n$0.56\nper year\n\n$26.0\n$24.0\n$7.0\n\n$1.75\n$3.25\n\n$6.0\n$17.0\n$30.0\n\nNGO=nongovernment organization.\na Unless indicated, no specific allocation for microfinance available.\nb Expected to continue either with recurring aid support or by recycling funds.\n\nMicrofinancea\nComponent\n\n$3.1\n$6.1\n$45.0\n\n$1.5\n\nBrief Project Description\n\nCommunity organization and linkages with\ncommercial banks for microcredit.\n\nProject\nDuration\n1997-2004\n1997-2004\n1999-2006\n1999-2004 Capacity building, basic infrastructure, and\nmicrocredit through NGOs.\nCapacity building of selected organizations\nto  provide  microcredit  and  support  for\nthrough  advisory\nsustainable \nservices  and  technical  assistance.

MFB was established on 6\nAugust 2000 through a statute.\n\n2.\nMFB\u2019s  strategy  is  to  transfer  and  build  up  human,  social,  and  physical  capital  for  the\npoor  in  an  efficient  and  sustainable  manner.  MFB  will  provide  affordable  financial  services,\nincluding  savings,  credit,  leasing,  money  transfer,  and  risk  mitigation  to  poor  households  to\nincrease their consumption and augment their income-generating assets. Social intermediation1\nwill precede and accompany financial services to ensure that social and gender dimensions of\npoverty  are  adequately  addressed.  MFB  methodology  and  products  will  have  a  strong  gender\nbias.  Forty  percent  of  MFB  staff  and  clients  will  be  women.  MFB  will  combine  the  core\ncompetency of a range of institutions to provide cost-effective services to the poor.\n\nB.\n\nOwnership and Corporate Governance\n\nThe authorized share capital of MFB is PRs5 billion ($89 million). Its paid-up capital of\n3.\nPRs1.7 billion ($30 million) has been subscribed2 by 3 state-owned commercial banks (PRs900\nmillion),  11  private  commercial  banks  (PRs700  million),  and  2  foreign  banks  (PRs100  million).\nThe maximum single shareholding is 23 percent. MFB will be a majority privately held institution\nas the privatization of two state-owned commercial bank shareholders is in an advance stage.\n\n4.\nThe  eight-member  MFB  board  has  three  representatives  from  the  nongovernment\norganizations (NGO), including the chairperson, and two women directors. Four other directors\nrepresent banks. The chairperson is an internationally recognized poverty specialist. He is also\nthe chairperson of the National Rural Support Program (NRSP), the largest NGO in the country\n(Appendix 5). The president (the chief executive officer) is a professional banker with exposure\nin MF.\n\n5.\nPersons  drawing  remuneration  from  the  Government  and  members  of  political  parties\nare ineligible to become a director. MFB will be supervised and regulated by the State Bank of\nPakistan  (SBP),  the  central  bank,  under  a  specific  regulatory  framework.  In  addition,  separate\nrules have been framed to ensure good corporate governance. External auditors will audit MFB,\nand reports will be published.\n\nC.\n\nOrganization\n\n6.\nMFB  will  have  a  decentralized  structure  to  maximize  efficiency  and  coordination  with\nNGOs. MFB operates from its head office located in Islamabad. It has commenced operations in\nSindh (Jacobabad district) and Punjab (Dera Ghazhi Khan district) provinces. One branch each\nin  Balochistan  and  North-West  Frontier  provinces  will  be  operational  by  year  end.  Under  the\n\n                  \n\n1 Improving  the  conditions  for  the  excluded  to  access  finance,  for  example,  through  grassroots  training  in  group\n\nformation, and vocational and financial skills.\n\n2 Private  commercial  banks:  Allied  Bank,  Askari  Bank,  Bank  Al-Habib,  Bolan  Bank,  Metropolitan  Bank,  Muslim\nCommercial Bank, Platinum Commercial Bank, Prime Bank, Prudential Commercial Bank, Soneri Bank, and Union\nBank;  State-owned  commercial  banks:  Habib  Bank,  National  Bank  of  Pakistan,  and  United  Bank;  and  Foreign\nbanks: Citibank, and Standard Chartered Bank.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\npresident,  the  head  office  has  four  divisions  (Figure  A7).  Each  MFB  branch  will  operate  as  a\nprofit center with performance measured against a set of financial indicators. Remuneration to\nMFB  staff  and  fees  for  NGO  service  providers  will  be  performance-based  to  achieve  portfolio\nquality and community capacity.\n\n7.\nDuring its first year of operation, MFB will work in partnership with the NRSP. Later the\npartnership will be extended to include other NGOs. MFB will start operating by assuming3 the\nloan  portfolio  of  PRs450  million  ($8  million),  subject  to  valuation,  and  about  45,000  borrowers\nfrom  NRSP,  as  well  as  PRs243  million  ($4.3  million)  in  deposits  mobilized  from  1,900\ncommunity organizations (COs) developed by NRSP. MFB will hire 50 NRSP staff. At the end of\nyear six, MFB will have 7 control branches, 34 branches with mobile units, and 1,506 staff.\n\nD.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n8.\nCOs will be the point of delivery for both financial and social services. MFB will mobilize\nthe  poor into COs  through NGO service providers. The formation of COs and service delivery\nwill  follow  procedures  (Appendix  8,  Figure  A8)  similar  to  those  successfully  developed  by\nNGOs. Credit will be available to CO members who have received capacity building inputs. MFB\nwill also give loans to individuals on a selective basis. MFB and the NGOs will regularly review\nand coordinate their respective activities. Mobile units traveling on a regular schedule to villages\nfrom MFB regional and branch offices will service customers. Mobile units will facilitate women\u2019s\naccess to financial services. Jeeps/pickups and drivers will be provided for women field officers.\n\nE.\n\nServices and Products\n\n1.\n\nSocial\n\n9.\nAll  560,000  members  of  24,750  COs  mobilized  by  MFB  through  NGOs  will  receive\ntraining  on  social  awareness,  selection  of  economic  activities,  women  empowerment,  basic\nliteracy, and financial products and services. About 40 percent of COs will be women-only COs.\nCO  activists,  especially  women,  will  undergo  capacity  building  in  vocational  skills,  community\nmanagement,  and  leadership.  The  costs  will  be  funded  from  the  interest  revenue  of  the\nMicrofinance  Social  Development  Fund  (Appendix  8)  and  partly  by  MFB.  Community\ninfrastructure grants will be provided on a cost-sharing basis to 4,500 COs from the Community\nInvestment Fund (Appendix 9). NGOs will provide these services.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial\n\n10.\nSavings. MFB will develop a range of savings instruments that will be attractive to rural\ncommunities. Emphasis will be placed on ready and convenient access to savings by individuals\nthrough the use of windows in bank branches and mobile units. In many areas, MFB will be the\nonly  depository  institution  to  provide  access  to  savings  facilities  to  the  poor.  Savings  will  be\ncollected from CO members as part of their eligibility to become borrowers and later as a self-\nsupporting  service.  Depositors  will  be  paid  competitive  interest  rate  on  deposits.  Deposits\nmobilized by MFB will be partly protected by the Deposit Protection Fund (Appendix 11).\n\n11.\nMicrocredit.  In  particular,  small-sized  short-term  loans,  loans  for  livestock,  and  home\nindustries  will  be  promoted.  Loan  size  will  be  up  to  PRs20,000  (about  $350)  for  the  first  loan.\n\n                  \n\n3 Once the existing loans are repaid to NRSP by the clients, fresh loans will be from MFB funds. MFB, subject to its\n\nboard approval, can also purchase the existing portfolio at a mutually agreed discount/premium.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\nRepayments  will  be  in  equated  monthly  installments.  The  estimated  lending  rate  to\nsubborrowers is 18 percent per annum.4\n\n12.  Microleasing.  MFB  will  provide  microleasing  services  to  individuals  or  cluster  of\nborrowers  (e.g.,  livestock  leases)  who  show  entrepreneurship.  All  assets  financed  will  be\ninsured under general insurance by MFB and insurance premia built into monthly rentals.\n\nRisk Mitigation. The Risk Mitigation Fund (Appendix 10) will assist the MFB borrowers\n\n13.\nin case of loss of income-generating assets due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nF. \n\nProjected Performance\n\nSBP,  MFB,  and  NGOs  have  sequenced  financial  and  social  intermediation  functions\n14.\nwhile projecting the performance of MFB.5 Projections reflect the concern for affordability of poor\nhouseholds,  viability  of  MFB,  and  expansion  of  the  MF  market.  By  year  6,  MFB  will  have\n560,000 borrowers and savers and about 80,000 nonborrower savers. The net outstanding loan\nat PRs7,430 million ($133 million) at year 6 will be funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB)\ncredit  line  of  PRs3,808  million  ($68  million),  and  the  balance  from  equity  of  PRs1,869  million\n($33 million), deposits of PRs1,740 million ($31 million), and commercial and other borrowings\n(Table.  A7.1  and  Table  A7.2).  MFB  is  structured  to  outsource  social  intermediation  functions\nand will be able to attain a viable financial intermediation function in year 4 with a profit of PRs8\nmillion.  Early  profitability  is  diminished  by  the  increase  in  branching  structure,  and  small  loan\nsize of first-time subborrowers.\n\nG. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n15.\nMFB is most vulnerable to increases in loan losses and reductions in loan revenues. The\nrisk  of  delinquency  has  been  addressed  through  social  collateral,  continuous  monitoring,\nadoption  of  successful  practices,  loan  loss  provisions,  and  autonomy  of  operations.  As  a\npositive incentive for better performance MFB will be able to access support from Microfinance\nSocial  Development  Fund,  Community  Investment  Fund,  and  the  Project  credit  line  only  if  it\nmeets the agreed performance benchmarks (Table A7.3).\n\n                  \n\n4 This will vary with scale of operations, changes in cost of funds, efficiency, etc.\n5 Conservatism has been applied in projections. The assumptions include (i) cost of ADB credit line at 7 percent per\nannum (p.a.), commercial borrowings at 14 percent p.a., and deposit at 7 percent p.a.; (ii) lending interest rate of\n18  percent  p.a.;  (iii)  loan  loss  provision  of  4  percent  of  net  outstanding  loans,  and  write-off  after  two  years;  (iv)\nadditional  provision  as  percent  of  net  profit  for  Reserve  Fund    (20  percent),  Social  Sector  Fund  (10  percent),\nDeposit Protection Fund (5 percent), and Risk Mitigation Fund (5 percent); (v) statutory liquidity and cash reserve\nof 10 percent of deposits; (vi) income tax at 30 percent of net profit has been applied even though currently MFB is\ntax  exempt;  (vii)  part  of  the  fixed  assets  financed  from  project  funds;  (viii)  social  intermediation  cost  treated  and\nfunded  separately  for  the  first  6  years;  and  (ix)  inflation  factor  of  6  percent  on  administrative  expenses.  Deposit\nmobilization is projected based on the average deposit size of about PRs2,250 ($40) for borrowers and PRs6,000\n($107) for nonborrowers at year 6.\n\n\fFigure A7:  Organization Structure of

Without  such  investments,  the  poverty  reduction  potential  of  MF  diminishes.\nInadequate  social  preparation  adversely  affects  the  cohesion  of  groups  or  community\norganizations (COs), usually the point of MF service delivery. Thus, the quality of loan portfolio\nand,  ultimately,  program  sustainability  are  also  affected.  Without  incorporating  social  and\ngender dimensions in products and services, it is difficult to reach the poorer among the poor.\nHowever, doing so is costly, and its public good nature makes it difficult to attract investments\nfor  building  social  capital.  Attempts  to  include  social  intermediation  costs  in  the  interest  rate\ncharged to the poor, on the other hand, leaves very little, if any, for their consumption and asset\nbuild  up.  Therefore,  support  must  be  provided  to  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  at  least  until\noperations  reach  a  point  where  economies  of  scale  enable  absorption  of  such  costs.\nInvestments in social intermediation serve both the larger social goals and the expansion of the\nMF market.\n\nB.\n\nObjective\n\n2.\nThe  objective  of  the  Microfinance  Social  Development  Fund  (MSDF)  is  to  enhance\nsocial  capital1  through   a  collaborative  effort  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),\nMicrofinance Bank (MFB), and other MFIs licensed by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) by (i)\nmobilizing  the  poor  into  COs  through  a  participatory  process;  (ii)  enhancing  capacity  of  CO\nmembers  for  community  mobilization,  social  awareness,  and  selection  and  management  of\nincome-generating  activities;  (iii)  developing  skills  and  providing  basic  literacy  training  for\nleaders  of  COs in  community management skills; and (iv) providing training to women in  rural\ncommunities  to  enhance  their  leadership  quality  and  participation  in  social  and  financial\nservices. These interventions are meant to strengthen the COs, which serve as delivery points\nfor financial and social services, and promotes social and economic vitality.2\n\nC.\n\nFunding and Management\n\n3.\nAs part of the Microfinance Sector Development Program, MSDF was established in the\nSBP with an initial contribution from MFB; the Government will contribute $40 million equivalent\nover  the  next  three  years  by  dedicating  part  of  the  counterpart  funds  of  the  policy  loan.  In\naddition, MFB will earmark 10 percent of its profit after taxes3 to fund the social intermediation\ncosts.  MSDF  has  been  established  for  25  years  to  provide  a  long-term  source  of  funding  for\nsocial intermediation to expand the MF market.\n\n                  \n\n1  In practice strengthening the social capital of the poor largely means increasing opportunities for their participation\nin  the  workings  of  the  society  where  social  cohesion  is  weak  and  poor  suffer  from  systemic  social  exclusion.\nIncreasing  economic  opportunities  and  creating  participatory  institutions/mechanisms  are  required  to  enhance\nsocial  capital.  The  promotion  of  community  based  groups  to  undertake  MF,  health,  and  natural  resource\nmanagement (Appendix 9) is an important first step in this direction.\n\n2  Connections  among  government,  civil  society,  and  private  sector  organizations  at  national  and  local  levels,  and\nbetween  these  and  citizens  groups  are  highly  conducive  to  social  and  economic  vitality.  Where  reciprocity  is  the\nnorm,  even  very  poor  people  have  a  source  of  help  when  faced  with  difficulty.  A  balance  between  local  (or\nhorizontal/bonding)  relationships  within  communities  and  external  (or  vertical/bridging)  relationships  with  the\ngovernment or other organizations promotes a positive blend of stability.\n\n3  MFB is currently tax exempt.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\n4.\nMSDF  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  MSDF  Rules  2000.  The  initial  contribution\nwill be invested by SBP in approved securities and the revenue generated will be credited in an\nMSDF  income  account  to  meet  expected  expenses.  The  MSDF  income  account  will  be\nmanaged by a fund committee comprising the MFB president as the chairperson, one nominee\nof SBP, and one MFB director. The meetings of the fund committee will be minuted. The fund\nsecretariat  located  in  MFB  will  deal  with  administrative  matters.  Administrative  expenses  are\ncapped  at  0.5  percent  of  the  revenue  generated  by  MSDF.  MSDF  and  the  MSDF  income\naccount will be audited and the report will be made public.\n\n5.\nMSDF will be a dedicated facility for MFB for the first three years, later MFIs licensed by\nSBP will also be eligible for support. MSDF will only support services delivered through NGOs\nthat meet the qualifying criteria and enter into partnership agreement with MFB. The agreement\nwill detail the type, location, duration of services, and expected results including gender-related\ntargets. Reimbursement claims will be made by MFB to the fund secretariat with documentary\nevidence of having engaged an eligible NGO and satisfactory completion of the service. If the\neligible expense claim from MFB is less than the interest revenue of MSDF, the balance will be\nreinvested in MSDF, and when expenses exceed the interest revenue, the same will be borne\nby MFB. MFB\u2019s direct costs will not be reimbursed. The Fund Committee will periodically review\nthe price of services provided by NGOs.\n\nD.\n\nSupport for Social Intermediation\n\n6.\nThe  revenue  from  MSDF  will  mobilize  560,000  poor  in  24,750  communities  in  6  years\nthrough  the  NGOs.  All  the  poor  organized  in  COs  will  be  provided  capacity  building  support.\nOne  activist  from  each  CO,  a  total  of  24,750  activists,  will  attend  four  days  of  community\nmanagement  skills  training.  To  enhance  the  participation  of  women,  12,412  women  activist  of\nCOs will attend a 3-day activist capacity enhancement course. Ten percent of women activists,\na total of 1,240 members will attend a 10-day leadership management skills training course. In\naddition,  annual  two-day  workshops,  1,409  during  MSDP  duration,  will  be  held  for  all  CO\nactivists.\n\nE.\n\nFormation of Community Organizations\n\n7.\nThe  process  of  forming  COs  has  been  charted  in  Figure  A8.  Steps  1  to  9  of  CO\nformation can take as little as 15 days where people have some familiarity with the process, and\nsix weeks or more otherwise. On average, the whole process takes 4 to 5 months. MFB selects\nnew  locations  with  the  assistance  of  the  NGOs,  which  are  contracted  to  undertake  steps  1\nthrough 9 with the involvement of MFB staff. While the MFB staff will be present at the very start\nof  CO  formation,  the  staff  will  become  increasingly  involved  from  step  5  onward,  and  be  fully\ninvolved  from  step  11  onward.  MFB  and  service  provider  NGOs  will  meet  quarterly  to  review\nand coordinate their respective activities.\n\nF.\n\nMSDF Revenues\n\n8.\nMSDF will generate about $20.0 million (Table A8) during the 6-year project duration to\nmeet the entire cost of social intermediation (including contingencies) estimated at $20.0 million.\nIn  the  subsequent  years,  MSDF  revenues  will  be  insufficient  to  meet  the  expected  social\nintermediation  costs.  The  gap  will  then  be  met  by  MFB.  MSDF  is  expected  to  generate  $37\nmillion over 10 years, and approximately $100 million over its 25-year term.\n\n\fFigure A8: Formation of Community Organization and Delivery of Microfinance

rural areas is inadequate access to both\nproductive  and  social  services.  Government  interventions  have  had  suboptimal  impact  as  the\nservices were not delivered in a participatory manner. In addition, women were seldom involved\nin service delivery.\n\n2.\nThe objective of the Community Investment Fund (CIF) is to increase the access of poor\ncommunities to infrastructure for improving their livelihoods through efficient and productive use\nof local resources. The involvement of local stakeholders in identifying, planning, executing, and\nmonitoring  community \nthem,  particularly  women.\nParticipatory  processes  leading  to  subproject  investment,  maintenance,  and  use  will  enhance\nsocial  capital  through  the  formation  of  cohesive  community  organizations  (COs)  that  could\neffectively be used to deliver microfinance services and expand the microfinance market.\n\ninfrastructure  projects  will  empower \n\nC.\n\nFunding and Management\n\n3.\nCIF  is  established  for  25  years  in  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP)  to  provide  a  long-\nterm  source  of  funding  for  community  infrastructure  projects  in  conjunction  with  social\nintermediation activities supported by the Microfinance Social Development Fund (MSDF). The\nMicrofinance Bank (MFB) has made an initial contribution. The Government will contribute $20\nmillion  equivalent  over  the  next  three  years  by  dedicating  part  of  the  counterpart  funds  of  the\npolicy loan. CIF will be managed in accordance with CIF Rules 2000, and operated on principles\nsimilar to MSDF (Appendix 8). CIF will be a dedicated facility for MFB for the first three years,\nlater other microfinance institutions licensed by SBP will also be covered.\n\nD.\n\nCriteria for Financing Community Infrastructure Subprojects\n\nCIF  will  grant-finance,  on  a  cost-sharing  basis,  small-scale  community-level\n4.\ninfrastructure subprojects, mainly civil works, which will benefit the poor. Eligible COs are those\nthat  have  been  mobilized  for  or  by  MFB.  Eligible  subprojects  will  be  those  that  are  not\nimmediately  bankable,  are  beyond  the  financing  scope  of  the  poor,  or  do  not  fall  immediately\nunder  government  programs.  Grant  funding  for  a  CO  is  limited  to  PRs150,000  or  about\nPRs7,000  per  participating  household.  Subprojects  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  equitable\ndistribution  of  benefits  and  sustainability  as  determined  by  the  CO\u2019s  willingness  to  make\narrangements  for  operation  and  maintenance,  including  recovery  of  costs  if  any.  At  least  80\npercent of CO members must sign the subproject agreement, with no objections from remaining\nmembers,  to  implement  and  maintain  the  subproject.  The  CO  must  contribute  at  least  40\npercent of the total cost and full costs of subsequent operation and maintenance. Subprojects\nmust be capable of completion within 12 months. An indicative flow chart is in Figure A9.\n\nE.\n\nCIF Revenue Utilization\n\n5.\nCIF  will  generate  $9.3  million  (Table  A9)  during  the  project  duration  to  finance  about\n4,500  community  infrastructure  subprojects.  Subproject  investment  will  account  for  90  percent\nof the revenue generated. The service fee for facilitating NGOs will be 5 percent of the interest\nrevenue,  or  about  3.5  percent  of  the  total  subproject  cost.  The  aggregate  revenue  generated\nover 10 years, will be approximately $17 million, and $43 million over 25 years.\n\n\fFigure A9: Processing Steps for Community Infrastructure Subprojects\n\nStep

FUND\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nThe disadvantages of the poor households include lack of access to financial services,\n1.\nunfair  terms  of  participation  in  the  local  economy,  and  vulnerability  to  economic  and  physical\ndownturns. As a result, poor households forego potentially viable new technologies, production\nchoices, and income opportunities due to risk aversion. A risk mitigation facility that effectively\ntargets the poor is not available. Poor, do not have other sources of funds to restart their failed\nlivelihood projects to repay debts, thus indebtedness takes over.\n\nB.\n\nObjective and Funding\n\n2.\nAs  part  of  the  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Program,  the  Risk  Mitigation  Fund\n(RMF) was established by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) as a safety net to mitigate the risks\nassociated  with  vulnerability  of  the  poor  to  loss  of  income  generating  assets  acquired  through\nMicrofinance Bank  (MFB) loan.  MFB has made an initial contribution and the Government will\ncontribute  $5  million  equivalent  as  a  grant  from  the  counterpart  funds  of  the  policy  loan.\nRecurring contributions will be made to RMF out of the spread between the cost of project funds\nto  the  Government  and  the  relending  rate  charged  to  MFB  by  the  Government.  Half  of  this\nspread  will  be  contributed  to  RMF.  In  addition,  MFB  will  contribute  up  to  5  percent  of  its  net\nprofit after taxes.1 RMF will be a dedicated facility for MFB borrowers.\n\nC.\n\nManagement\n\n3.\nRMF will be managed by the Microfinance Support Division of SBP in accordance with\nthe RMF Rules, 2000. Contributions to RMF will be invested in instruments approved by SBP.\nIndependent auditors will audit RMF and the report will be made public. The impact of RMF on\nthe  risk  profile  of  the  poor  households  will  be  assessed.  MFB  and  SBP  will  determine\nconversion  of  RMF  into  an  actuarial-based  system  in  consultation  with  Asian  Development\nBank.\n\nD.\n\nRisk Mitigation\n\n4.\nAssistance  from  RMF  will  be  provided  to  the  borrowers  of  MFB  for  the  repurchase  of\nassets  to  generate  income  and  repay  their  debts.  Assistance  from  RMF  will  be  available  to\nmembers  of  community  organizations  after  three  fourths  of  the  members  of  the  community\norganization certify the need for such assistance for the individual, and the field officer of MFB\nverifies the same. Claims will be submitted periodically by MFB to Microfinance Support Division\nwith  evidence  that  due  diligence  has  been  carried  out.  SBP,  if  it  deems  fit,  can  verify  such\nclaims. RMF will not be used in any manner to liquidate loans written off or loan losses due to\nwillful nonpayment of borrowers, or due to negligence on the part of MFB staff. Assistance will\nonly be admissible up to the available RMF balance.\n\nDuring  the  6-year  project  duration  RMF  revenues  (Table  A10)  can  potentially  mitigate\n\n5.\nthe risk of 27,000 poor households keeping the principal fund intact.\n\nE.\n\nProjected Compensation\n\n1 MFB is currently tax exempt.\n\n                  \n\n\fItem\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n10 Years\n\nSubtotal\n6 Years a\n\nTotal\n\nTable A10:  Projected Utilization of Risk Mitigation Fund \n($'000)\n\nRisk Mitigation Fund (RMF) - Opening Balance\n\n18.3 \n\n5,000.0 \n\n5,000.0 \n\n5,000.0 \n\n5,000.0 \n\n5,000.0 \n\n5,000.0 \n\n5,000.0 \n\n5,000.0 \n\n5,000.0 \n\nRMF - Initial Contributionsb\n\n 17.9 \n\n5,000.0 \n\n5,017.9 \n\n5,017.9 \n\nRMF - Subsequent Contributions\nSpread Revenue Allocation c\nMicrofinance Bank (MFB) Contribution d\nSubtotal \n\nRMF Interest Revenue (10.0%) e\n\nAdministration Expenses\nRMF Administration (0.50%)f\n\n44.5 \n\n211.0 \n\n564.0 \n\n1,284.0 \n\n1,974.5 \n\n2,109.0 \n\n6,187.0 \n\n2,183.5 \n\n2,271.0 \n\n2,266.0 \n\n2,239.5  15,147.0 \n\n44.5 \n\n211.0 \n\n564.0 \n\n1,284.0 \n\n \n\n12.0 \n1,986.5 \n\n96.0 \n2,205.0 \n\n108.0 \n6,295.0 \n\n162.0 \n2,345.5 \n\n227.0 \n2,498.0 \n\n262.0 \n2,528.0 \n\n302.0 \n\n1,061.0 \n2,541.5  16,208.0 \n\n0.4 \n\n254.0 \n\n513.7 \n\n538.8 \n\n592.4 \n\n663.5 \n\n709.6 \n\n3,272.4 \n\n727.5 \n\n742.2 \n\n751.3 \n\n753.5 \n\n6,246.9 \n\n0.0 \n\n1.3 \n\n2.6 \n\n2.7 \n\n3.0 \n\n3.3 \n\n3.5 \n\n16.4 \n\n3.6 \n\n3.7 \n\n3.8 \n\n3.8 \n\n31.2 \n\nRMF Closing Balance (Before Compensation)\n\nIndicative Compensation Amount\n\nRMF Closing Balance (After Compensation)\n\n18.3 \n\n18.3 \n\n5,315.6 \n315.6 \n5,000.0 \n\n5,722.1 \n722.1 \n5,000.0 \n\n6,100.1 \n1,100.1 \n5,000.0 \n\n6,873.4 \n1,873.4 \n5,000.0 \n\n7,646.7 \n2,646.7 \n5,000.0 \n\n7,911.0  14,569.0 \n9,569.0 \n2,911.0 \n5,000.0 \n5,000.0 \n\n8,069.4 \n3,069.4 \n5,000.0 \n\n8,236.5 \n3,236.5 \n5,000.0 \n\n8,275.5 \n3,275.5 \n5,000.0 \n\n8,291.2 \n3,291.2  22,441.6 \n5,000.0 \n\nRMF Indicators\n\nClients Compensated (number) g\nClients Compensated as Percent of Total (%)\n\n1,443\n4.9%\n\n2,300\n3.8%\n\n3,417\n3.0%\n\n5,623\n3.0%\n\n7,670\n2.8%\n\n8,115\n2.2%\n\n26,675\n\n8,263\n1.8%\n\n8,447\n1.6%\n\n8,328\n1.3%\n\n8,197\n1.2%\n\n59,910 \n\na\n\nc\n\nd\n\nb\n\nProject implementation period.\nInitial Microfinance Bank contribution of PRs1.0 million ($17,900 equivalent), October 2000.\nSpread revenue represents the difference between the interest rate on Asian Development Bank loan and the relending interest rate to MFB (set at  the average \ncost of deposits in the banking industry, currently 7 percent per annum).

In the recent past, the poor have lost their savings with the\nfailure of cooperatives, and frauds in finance companies. While the deposits of the state-owned\ncommercial banks, to which the poor have very little access, are implicitly guaranteed, no such\ncover  is  yet  available  for  private  sector  commercial  banks.  Microfinance  Bank  (MFB)  will  be  a\nmajority  privately  held  bank  when  the  two  state-owned  banks  with  equity  participation  in  MFB\nare privatized. The MFB ordinance provides for the protection of MFB depositors as a matter of\nprudence  as  well  as  a  safety  net  measure  for  the  poor.  This  is  also  intended  to  enhance  the\ncredibility of MFB to mobilize deposits from the nonpoor.\n\nB.\n\nObjective and Funding\n\n2.\nAs part of the Microfinance Sector Development Program, the Deposit Protection Fund\n(DPF) was established by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to provide protection to the savings\nin  the  event  of  MFB  liquidation.  MFB  has  made  an  initial  contribution  and  the  Government  is\ncommitted to contribute $5 million equivalent as a grant from the counterpart funds of the policy\nloan.  The  Government  will  make  recurring  contributions  to  DPF  from  the  spread  between  the\ncost  of  project  funds  to  the  Government  and  the  relending  rate  charged  to  MFB.  Half  of  this\nspread will be contributed to DPF. In addition, MFB will contribute up to 5 percent of its net profit\nafter taxes.1 DPF will be a dedicated facility for MFB depositors.\n\nC.\n\nManagement\n\nDPF will be managed  by  the  Microfinance Support Division of SBP in accordance with\n3.\nthe  DPF  Rules,  2000.  Contributions  to  DPF  will  be  invested  in  instruments  approved  by  SBP.\nIndependent auditors will audit DPF, and the report will be made public. The impact of DPF on\nmobilizing savings of the poor as well as from the nonpoor will be assessed. MFB and SBP will\ndetermine  conversion  of  DPF  into  an  actuarial-based  system  in  consultation  with  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank,  or  MFB  could  join  a  deposit  insurance  scheme  as  and  when  it  becomes\navailable at favorable terms.\n\nD.\n\nDeposit Protection\n\n4.\nDPF  will  provide  protection  to  depositors  who  have  maintained  deposits  with  MFB  for\ntwo consecutive years. SBP will periodically assess the extent of coverage possible and ensure\nthat  DPF  is  not  used  in  any  manner  other  than  its  objective.  SBP,  in  the  unlikely  event  of\nliquidation of MFB, will process claims of depositors.\n\n5.\nAt the end of the 6-year project the estimated DPF balance (Table A11) is $16.0 million,\nor about 50 percent of MFB deposit. The DPF balance is expected to be $35 million by year 10.\n\nE.\n\nProjected Revenues\n\n1 MFB is currently tax exempt.\n\n                  \n\n\fItem\n\n      2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n10 Years\n\nSubtotal\n6 Years a\n\nTotal\n\nTable A11:  Projected Utilization of Deposit Protection Fund \n($'000)\n\nDeposit Protection Fund (DPF) - Opening Balance\n\n18.3 \n\n5,315.6 \n\n6,053.4 \n\n7,221.6 \n\n9,258.0  12,227.0 \n\n15,709.4  19,671.2  24,170.3  29,129.5 \n\nDPF - Initial Contributionsb\n\n 17.9 \n\n5,000.0 \n\n5,017.9 \n\n5,017.9 \n\n \n\n \n\nDPF - Subsequent Contributions\nSpread Revenue Allocation c\nMicrofinance Bank (MFB) Contribution d\nSubtotal\n\nDPF Interest Revenue (10.0%) e\n\nAdministration Expenses\nDPF Administration Charge (0.5%) f\n\n44.5 \n\n211.0 \n\n564.0 \n\n1,284.0 \n\n44.5 \n\n211.0 \n\n564.0 \n\n1,284.0 \n\n \n\n1,974.5 \n12.0 \n1,986.5 \n\n2,109.0 \n96.0 \n2,205.0 \n\n6,187.0 \n108.0 \n6,295.0 \n\n2,183.5 \n162.0 \n2,345.5 \n\n2,271.0 \n227.0 \n2,498.0 \n\n2,266.0 \n262.0 \n2,528.0 \n\n2,239.5  15,147.0 \n1,061.0 \n2,541.5  16,208.0 \n\n302.0 \n\n0.4 \n\n254.0 \n\n529.5 \n\n607.2 \n\n756.2 \n\n987.5 \n\n1,283.8 \n\n4,418.6 \n\n1,624.3 \n\n2,011.2 \n\n2,443.4 \n\n2,918.5  13,416.0 \n\nDPF Closing Balance\n\n18.3 \n\n5,315.6 \n\n6,053.4 \n\n7,221.6 \n\n9,258.0  12,227.0  15,709.4  15,709.4  19,671.2  24,170.3  29,129.5  34,574.9   \n\nDPF Indicators\n\nDPF as Percentage of MFB Deposits\n\n0.4%\n\n104.1%\n\n93.6%\n\n78.7%\n\n66.9%\n\n58.2%\n\n51.2%\n\n51.2%\n\n44.7%\n\n40.3%\n\n37.0%\n\n34.3%\n\n1.3 \n\n2.6 \n\n3.0 \n\n3.8 \n\n4.9 \n\n6.4 \n\n22.1 \n\n8.1 \n\n10.1 \n\n12.2 \n\n14.6 \n\n67.1 \n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\ne\n\nf\n\nProject implementation period.\nInitial MFB contribution of PRs1.0 million ($17,900 equivalent), October 2000.\nSpread revenue represents the difference between the interest rate on Asian Development Bank loan and the relending interest rate to MFB (set at  the average \ncost of deposits in the banking industry, currently 7 percent per annum).

These  rates  of\nreturns, while not high, are considered satisfactory. Interest on lending at 18 percent per annum\nconstitutes the major source of revenue. MFB profits will be reinvested for social intermediation,\nrisk mitigation, and deposit protection. While the cost of social intermediation will be funded from\nMicrofinance Social Development Fund (Appendix 8), MFB will meet an increasing proportion of\nsuch costs from its surpluses. The cost of community mobilization and capacity building amount\nto 4 percent of the net loan outstanding in year 6 and declines to 2.4 percent in year 10.\n\nTable A18.1: Microfinance Bank Key Indicators\n\nKey Indicators\n\n2001\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2010\n\n1.

Depending  on  loan  portfolio  at  startup,  and  expected  asset  growth,  a  prospective\nMFI  will  need  initial  capital  of  PRs15-PRs25  million  and  access  to  additional  capital  in  the\nfollowing  years.  Viability  is  likely  in  5  years  (Supplementary  Appendix  H)  under  assumptions\nsimilar to MFB. Four NGOs with substantive interest in MF having a client base of 1,000-4,000\nare considered as prospective applicants to operate as licensed MFIs.\n\n\f86\n\nAppendix 18, page 2\n\n3.\n\nSubborrower Investments\n\n4.\nTo  determine  investment  profitability  and  the  effect  of  the  Project  on  employment,  50\nprofiles  were  reviewed,  and  a  sample  selected  representing  20  activities.  Loan  disbursements\nfor  this  weighted  sample  averaged  PRs7,000  ($125)  within  a  range  of  PRs1,500  ($27)  to\nPRs50,000 ($892). The range in enterprise financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was 23 to 60\npercent, with a weighted average of 33.6 percent reducing to 25.5 percent after allowing for a 20\npercent  enterprise  failure  rate.  The  average  annual  operating  surplus  was  estimated  at\nPRs29,515 ($527). The average increase in labor days generated from new investments was 70\ndays  representing  a  return  per  labor  day  of  PRs437  (PRs350  after  allowing  for  enterprise\nfailure)  significantly  above  the  current  average  rural  wage  rate  of  PRs80.  After  allowing  for\nenterprise  failure,  the  daily  labor  surplus  of  PRs350  represents  an  increase  in  the  average\nhousehold  income  of  PRs24,500  ($438).  The  profiles  show  that  some  moderately  attractive\ninvestments  are  available  to  the  rural  poor  that  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  employment\ngeneration and household incomes (Table A18.2).\n\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the sample income generating activities\n5.\nranged from a sector high of 33/34 percent (agricultural crops and manufacturing/processing) to\na sector low of 23 percent (services and trade). The weighted average EIRR was 27 and (Table\nA18.3).\n\n4.\n\nCommunity Infrastructure Projects\n\n6.\nProjects  are  mainly  small  civil  works,  including  (i)  roads  and  bridges  (feeder  tracks)\nproviding better access for communities to services; (ii) farm irrigation investments from ponds,\ndugwells,  and  diversion  canals;  (iii)  clean  domestic  water  supply  and  sewerage;  and  (iv)\nelectrification  (including  phone  and  internet  access  booths).  Community  organizations  will\ncontribute 40 percent of the initial capital cost and be responsible for any ongoing operation and\nmaintenance costs. Seven typical subprojects were analyzed (Table A18.4).\n\n7.\nBenefits from feeder tracks include reduced vehicle operating cost, savings from existing\nand  generated  trips,  and  a  reduction  in  the  cost  of  existing  and  generated  goods  transported.\nThe  calculated  FIRR  was  21.5  percent  and  the  EIRR  was  estimated  at  22.5  percent.  Three\ntypes  of  small-scale  community-managed  irrigation  schemes  were  considered,  namely\nindividual  dugwell,  gravity  diversion,  and  pond  irrigation.  Incremental  revenue  to  the  schemes\nwould result from an increase in the cropping intensity combined with the introduction of higher\nvalue crops. The resulting FIRR ranged from 27.2 percent for pond, 20.4 percent for diversion,\nand  8.6 percent  for  dugwell  schemes,  and  the  EIRR  ranged  from  36.2 percent  for  pond,\n26.8 percent for diversion, and 21.1 percent for dugwell schemes.\n\nTwo  types  of  small-scale  community-managed  domestic  water  supply  schemes  were\n8.\nconsidered,  namely  gravity  and  hand-pump.  Incremental  benefits  to  the  schemes  would  result\nfrom  savings  in  family  health  expenditure  and  reduction  in  the  time  spent  fetching  water.  The\nresulting FIRR ranged from 34.5 percent for gravity to 26.1 percent for hand-pump schemes and\nthe  EIRR  ranged  from  32.4 percent  and  26.6 percent,  respectively.  Benefits  from  the\nelectrification scheme include reduced energy delivery costs, household expenditure savings on\nalternative  energy  sources,  and  increased  demand  for  electricity.  The  FIRR  was  20.6  percent\nand EIRR 20.9 percent.\n\n\fPerformance Measures\nReturn per\nLabor Day\n(PRs/Pday)\n\nReturn

will  operate  in  30\ndistricts  containing  5  million  households  of  which  2.80  million  (56  percent)  are  poor  and  1.74\nmillion  (34  percent)  are  very  poor.  With  continuing  services  to  560,000  households,  MFB  will\nreach about 9 percent of poor households in the country. MFB is projected to disburse about 1.6\nmillion  loans  over  6  years  or  about  270,000  borrowers  per  year.  A  household  in  the  lowest\nincome decile will require continuous access to loan assistance for 4 to 5 years to raise monthly\nper capita income to cross the poverty threshold.1 A household in the income decile just below\nthe poverty line could be above the line within two years of project-stimulated investment. Direct\nbenefits are summarized in Table A20.\n\nFinancially, the Project supports loans to women. The cost of making loans to women,\n2. \nrelated to the need for vehicles, drivers, and higher employee turnover, is 1.4 percentage points\nhigher  than  for  loans  to  men,  assuming  loan  sizes  are  equal.  An  increase  of  10  percent  in\naverage loan size reduces  the administrative cost of lending by 0.4 percentage points. To the\nextent that loan sizes to women will be smaller, women will receive transfer advantage as loan\ncharges will not be differentiated by gender.\n\n3. \nIn  the  formation  and  financing  of  Microfinance  Social  Development  Fund  (Appendix  8)\nfor  $40  million,  the  Project  will  enable  formation  of  24,750  community  organizations  (COs)  of\nwhich 40 percent will be for women. Through the COs, the Project will (i) provide a cost-effective\ndelivery  point  for  the  provision  of  small-scale  financial  services;  (ii)  encourage  peer  review  of\nloan proposals, and enjoin responsibility for the repayment of loans to the benefit of the group;\n(iii)  support  the  development  of  social  skills  among  women,  including  basic  literacy  and\ncommunications within their society; (iv) inform women of their basic rights to own and manage\nassets, and facilitate the placement of these resources in their hands. These will foster a sense\nof  empowerment  through  a  participatory  process  and  constitute  an  important  step  towards\nstrengthening social capital.\n\n4. \nThe  establishment  and  support  from  Community  Investment  Fund  (Appendix  9)  will\nincrease  the  access  of  poor  communities  to  basic  infrastructure,  to  improve  their  livelihoods.\nThe involvement of COs in identifying, planning, executing, and monitoring of community-based\ninfrastructure will empower them and serve as an incentive to mobilize and strengthen COs to\nenhance  social  capital.  About  4,500  COs  will  be  able  to  get  assistance  from  Community\nInvestment  Fund,  which  is  designed  to  leverage  social  mobilization  and  capacity  building\nsupport from Microfinance Social Development Fund.\n\n5. \nThe establishment of Risk Mitigation Fund (Appendix 10) will reduce indebtedness of the\npoor  due  to  failed  enterprises  and  enable  poor  households  to  take  advantage  of  potentially\nviable  new  technologies,  production  choices,  and  income  opportunities.  Risk  Mitigation  Fund\nhas  the  potential  to  assist  about  27,000  poor  households  during  the  project  period  and  is\nparticularly  significant  for  remote  areas  with  adverse  agroclimatic  patterns,  tribal  communities,\nand  bonded  labor,  where  chances  of  failures  and  losses  are  the  highest.  Deposit  Protection\nFund  (Appendix  11)  secures  the  savings  of  the  poor  from  any  systemic  or  institutional  failure.\nThis added protection will inculcate saving habits among the poor and promote savings in MFB\nwhich could be used for extending microcredit.\n\n                  \n\n1 The  monthly  per  capita  income  of  the  households  in  the  lowest  income  decile  is  about  PRs200  (about  $4).  The\naverage annual household income of nonpoor in rural areas is about PRs52,000 ($928), and in urban areas about\nPRs85,000 ($1,517).\n\n\f90\n\nAppendix 20, page 2\n\nTable A20: Impact on Poverty\n\nChannel\n\nDirect Impact of Project\n\nMacro\n\nNonpoor\n\nAccess to Poor Microfinance Services.\n\nMicrofinance institutions\nwill stimulate improved\nsupply of financial\nservices, particularly\nsavings, which could be\naccessible to rural\nnonpoor.\n\nCommercial intervention\nin the provision of\ninsurance cover in rural\nareas would provide\nbenefits.\n\nNot applicable.\n\nLegislative, regulatory, and\nsupervisory environment\ncreated for the microfinance\nsector will encourage entry of\na diverse range of service\nproviders.
