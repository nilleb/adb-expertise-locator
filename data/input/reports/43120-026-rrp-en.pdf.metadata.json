The additional financing will scale up activities in the three main outputs: (i) surveillance \nand inspection for plant health, animal health, and food safety; (ii) enhanced education levels and \nuniversity training of SPS specialists; and (iii) regional cooperation and harmonization for SPS \nmeasures and practices. The project will be implemented by the Lao PDR Ministry of Agriculture \nand Forestry (MAF). The current project\u2019s approach and structure remain valid. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe current project was developed based on the commitment of the Lao PDR to implement \n3. \nthe  GMS  regional  cooperation  strategy  of  connectivity  and  competitiveness. 5  While  recent \ninvestments in physical infrastructure have improved connectivity and created new opportunities \nfor  trade,  governments  in  the  region  recognize  that  weak  national  legal,  institutional,  and \noperational capacity for delivering SPS services has hindered the establishment of a harmonized \nand robust GMS framework for SPS, which has impeded growth in exports of food products and \nincomes  of  farm  households.  Governments  in  the  GMS  need  to  invest  in  national  SPS \nmanagement  systems  from  farm  to  table,  and  coordinate  SPS  service  delivery  better  across \njurisdictions. 6  The  current  project  has  been  successful  in  improving  legal,  institutional,  and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans, Grant, and \nTechnical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  and  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic:  Trade  Facilitation: \nImproved Sanitary and Phytosanitary Handling in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila. SPS measures and issues \nare  defined  in  the  1994  World  Trade  Organization  Subsidiary  Agreement  on  the  Application  of  Sanitary  and \nPhytosanitary Measures. \n\n3  The GMS includes Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n4  The Government of Cambodia has deferred its request for additional financing as it continues to implement activities \n\nunder the current project and TA 8732-REG. \n\n5  Greater Mekong Subregion. 1992. GMS Economic Cooperation Program. GMS. \n6  ADB.  2012.  Technical  Assistance  for  Implementing  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Core  Agriculture  Support \nProgram (Phase 2). Manila. (TA 8163-REG). This TA is facilitating the development of the GMS Strategy and Action \nPlan on Promoting Safe and Environment Friendly Agro-Based Value Chains in the Greater Mekong Subregion for \n2018\u20132022. Based on an agro-based value chain approach, the strategy has two pillars: policies and investments, \nand certification of food safety and quality. The resulting GMS strategy and action plan document is envisaged for \nendorsement by the GMS agriculture ministers during the third quarter of 2017.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\noperational  capacities  for  SPS  service  delivery  in  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR;  including \nmanagement  and  cooperation  on  essential  SPS  issues  to  be  resolved  in  the  region. \nAchievements under the project include market access agreements with bilateral trading partners \nfor key AFF exports, upgrades to laboratory equipment crucial for testing and analysis of plant \nand  animal  health  and  food  safety,  and  updated  curricula  and  teaching  methodology  for  SPS \neducation in the Faculty of Agriculture at the National University of Laos. Under the current project, \nthe  governments  of  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR  have  successfully  pilot  tested  a  food  safety \nscheme involving the assessment and grading of food establishments. Technical assistance (TA) \non Enhancing Capacity for SPS Arrangements to Facilitate Trade in the GMS is also supporting \nprogress  by  providing  for  cooperation  between  customs  and  SPS  agencies,  regional  capacity \nbuilding, and the development of a monitoring and evaluation framework (footnote 4). National \ntrade data show clear benefits such as the increased export volume of AFF goods resulting from \nimproved SPS management systems under ADB\u2019s support. For example, under the framework of \nmarket access agreements with bilateral partners, rice exports from the Lao PDR to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China have increased 400% from 2015 to 2017.7 Other AFF products experienced \nrobust export growth from 2012 to 2015, such as corn (67%) and cassava (328%).  \n\n4. \nDespite this progress, additional financing is required to support reforms in the Lao PDR \nto  enhance  SPS  institutions  and  operational  capacity  in  line  with  the  country\u2019s  GMS \ncommitments.8 The  current  project  focuses  on  improved  surveillance  and  monitoring  of  plant \nhealth,  animal  health,  and  food  safety  in  three  provinces9,  while  additional  provinces  such  as \nSavannakhet and Oudomxay require support under the project. Additional financing will facilitate \nthe  rollout  of  a  national  food  safety  management  system,  including  a  ratings  scheme  of  food \nestablishments, to improve food safety for the population and visitors to the Lao PDR. Enhancing \nfood safety in the Lao PDR will boost its reputation as a tourism destination, which is imperative \nas tourism accounts for 6.4% of gross domestic product. The first batch of food science students \nfrom  the  project  will  graduate  in  2018,  and  additional  investments  are  needed  to  ensure  a \nsufficient number of qualified food scientists in the long term.  \n\n5. \nEligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing.  The  proposed  project  meets  the  eligibility \ncriteria of being: (i) technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) accorded \nhigh priority by the government; and (iii) consistent with the project\u2019s developmental objectives. \nAs  the  current  country  partnership  strategy  for  2017\u20132021  is  being  drafted,  the  additional \nfinancing is included in the country operations business plan for the Lao PDR, 2017\u20132019.10 The \nreview  missions  for  the  project  confirmed  its  technical  and  economic  viability,  and  economic \nsoundness. Based on the targets of the Lao PDR National Strategy for Agricultural Development, \n2011\u20132022, 11  the  project  is  aligned  with  government  priorities.  The  proposal  for  additional \nfinancing  will  allow  a  scale-up  of  project  activities  in  outputs  1  to  3,  expanding  coverage  to \nadditional  provinces,  supporting  the  nationwide  rollout  of  the  ratings  scheme  of  food \nestablishments,  and  enhancing  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  coordination  on  SPS  matters  in  the  GMS.  The \ncurrent  project  is  also  aligned  with  the  GMS  10-year  Strategic  Framework,  2012\u2013202212 and \nfacilitates cross-border trade and investment, including continued progress of the Lao PDR\u2019s SPS \nmanagement  and  monitoring  under  the  current  project.  The  project  will  contribute  to  pillar  4 \n(cooperation in regional public goods) of ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy.13  \n                                                \n7  Other bilateral market access agreement partners include Thailand and Viet Nam. \n8  Based  on  current  project  implementation  progress,  additional  financing  will  be  provided  to  the  Lao  PDR  while \n\nadditional support will be provided to Cambodia at a later stage.  \n\n9  Vientiane capital, Luang Prabang and Pakse \n10 ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nOnly two of the top five exports from the Lao PDR are AFF products, while over 70% of \n6. \nits  labor  force  is  engaged  in  agriculture.  Exports  of  other  AFF  products  could  be  expanded \nsignificantly by raising productivity in agriculture and reducing SPS-related barriers to exports of \nthese products through market access agreements with trading partners for key crops. From 2010 \nto 2014, exports of AFF products increased by over 90%.14 Nevertheless, poor SPS management \ncapacities continue to limit market access for many AFF products from the Lao PDR, both in the \nGMS and globally. The Government of the Lao PDR has limited institutional and human resources \nto protect crops, livestock, and consumers against health hazards caused by plant pests, animal \ndiseases, and food-borne diseases. While the current project has facilitated better SPS systems, \nthe  Lao PDR  needs  more  sustained  and  scaled  up  assistance  to  ensure  longer-term  SPS \ncapabilities.  Effective  national  SPS  management  systems  are  building  blocks  for  regional \nharmonization and for establishing trust among GMS countries in each other\u2019s SPS measures. \n \n7. \nDespite the significant improvement resulting from the current project, Lao PDR continues \nto faces challenges in: (i) undertaking surveys on crop pests and diseases required by market \naccess agreements; (ii) undertaking risk management through inspections and interceptions of \nimported  products;  (iii)  monitoring  trade  and  use  of  agricultural  pesticides  required  by  market \naccess agreements; (iv) updating and understanding new risks of forest pest spread associated \nwith trade in wood and forest products; and (v) maintaining and expanding the regional trade in \ncrop  products.  Lao  PDR  also  needs  to:  (i)  continue  containment  of  transboundary  animal \ndiseases;  (ii)  improve  surveillance  of  veterinary  drugs  and  feed;  and  (iii)  improve  animal  food \nproduct safety. Food safety practices are poor and awareness of the importance of food safety is \nlow, resulting in very high levels of food-borne illness; inadequate attention to food safety in food \nestablishments;  and  inadequate  monitoring  of  food,  food  establishments,  and  food  poisoning \noutbreaks. Food safety supervision has added importance, given the increasing tourist volumes \nin the Lao PDR. \n \n8. \nCompliance with global SPS requirements requires national specialists to undertake tasks \nrelated  to  surveillance,  risk  analysis,  testing,  pest  identification,  production  standards,  and \nconformity assessment. Given the large proportion of the local labor force in the agriculture sector, \nit is important to invest in the education of future SPS specialists who will help ensure the quality \nand safety of AFF goods. Trading partners and private companies often require the application of \ngood agricultural practices, good manufacturing practices, and quality assurance management \n(such  as  hazard  analysis  critical  control  point  systems).  The  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations  has  established  regional  cooperation  on  food  safety  and  harmonized  standards \nrecognition for agricultural products. GMS countries are considering the establishment of a trade \nfacilitation working group, with two subgroups for customs and SPS, to meet as required.15 As the \nLao  PDR  increasingly  participates  in  regional  and global trade,  it  will  need  to  ensure that  AFF \ngoods exports meet the stringent standards of importing countries. However, specialists who can \nperform these surveillance and analytical tasks are lacking. The current project introduced SPS \ntraining at the National University of Laos, and the first batch of locally trained SPS specialists will \njoin the workforce in 2018. Continued support in this area would help strengthen the capacities of \nSPS agencies in the Lao PDR by supplementing their staff with locally trained experts. \n \nLessons.  The project builds on past and ongoing technical assistance related to SPS \n9. \nsupported by development partners and ADB. Enforcement of SPS standards and management \nsystems remains a challenge in the Lao PDR. Experience shows that due to limited government \nabsorptive  capacity,  donors  must  adopt  a  phased  approach  to  formulate  well-targeted  and \n                                                \n14 Government of the Lao PDR, Lao PDR Trade Portal. http://laotradeportal.gov.la/index.php. \n15 The proposal to reactivate the trade facilitation working group will be submitted for consideration and endorsement \n\nby the GMS ministers in September 2017. \n\n\f4 \n\nsequenced  projects  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  bilateral  and  regional  commitments  on \ncooperation and harmonization. An integrated approach to the three main areas of concern (i.e. \nfood safety, animal health and plant health) is beneficial so as to develop a common framework \nfor SPS standards. Development partners such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations and the United States Agency for International Development support other aspects \nof  SPS  capacity  building  in  the  GMS,  including  legislative  and  regulatory  reform,  which \ncomplement the project and contribute to addressing SPS issues comprehensively. \n \nThe current project has delivered pest lists for 11 crops, which were crucial for meeting \n10. \nbilateral market access agreements requirements, as well as food safety training to improve risk \nmanagement and hazard response, including for food manufacturing establishments. The current \nproject  is  rated  on  track  by  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  rating  system.  As  of  31  August  2017, \noverall physical implementation progress of the project was estimated at 93% against the elapsed \nimplementation period of 91%. Cumulative contract awards amount to $13.4 million or 97% of net \nproject  amount  while  cumulative  disbursements  amount  to  $12  million  or  87%  of  net  project \namount. Identified risks such as weak institutional capacity were mitigated through staff training \nand capacity building in the project management unit as well as component implementation units \n(CIUs). Since project effectiveness, ADB has conducted seven review missions and confirmed \nthat:  (i)  implementation  progress  has  been  satisfactory  and  no  substantial  changes  to  project \ndesign  and  approach  are  envisioned;  (ii)  MAF  and  CIUs  have  the  capacity,  experience,  and \nexpertise needed to implement ADB-financed projects; and (iii) the current project interventions \nhave produced tangible benefits  to  the  Lao  PDR.  Cambodia  has  opted to defer  any  additional \nfinancing  until  2019,  in  line  with  its  implementation  schedule  for  completing  activities  and  the \nproject pipeline. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  impact  remains  unchanged  for  the  additional  financing  project:  Lao  PDR  AFF \nproducts that are safer, more efficiently produced, and traded in greater quantities. The outcome \nwill  be  an  enhanced  SPS  management  system  in  the  Lao  PDR,  which  will  contribute  to \nintraregional  trade,  export  competitiveness,  and  health  protection.  With  additional  financing, \ncurrent project progress will be scaled up to include coverage of more provinces16 in the Lao PDR \nand a greater number of staff receiving capacity building.  \n \nC. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Strengthened Surveillance and Inspection Programs \n\n \n12. \nPlant health. Assistance will continue to focus on: (i) surveillance to maintain the pest lists \nfor 15 products developed under the current project and additional pest lists for another five crops \nfor use in market access arrangements with countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), Thailand, and Viet Nam (the current project enabled market access agreements for rice \nexports to the PRC, and additional financing will support additional crops such as Job\u2019s tears, and \ncassava market access agreements); (ii) strengthening related pest identification, diagnostic, and \nanalytical  services  through  investments  in  laboratory  facilities,  equipment,  and  training; \n(iii) improving the capacity to approve pesticides formulation analysis, monitoring, and its residual \ntesting; \nforecast  and  outbreaks;  \n(v)  doubling  the  capacity  to  provide  post-entry  quarantine  for  new  plant  species  following  the \nconstruction of the first post-entry quarantine facility under the current project; and (vi) improving \n\nthe  capacity \n\nimproving \n\nto  pest \n\nrespond \n\n(iv) \n\nto \n\n                                                \n16 Including Bolikhamxay,Champasak, Khammuane, Xiengkhouang, and Savannakhet. \n\n\f5 \n\ninternational reporting of pest situations and strengthening the supply chains associated with crop \nproducts.  \n \n13. \nAnimal health. The focus will continue to be on: (i) strengthening transboundary animal \ndiseases surveillance and response programs by extending the transboundary animal diseases \nsurveillance  work  being  undertaken  in  two  provinces  under  the  current  project  to  two  further \nprovinces;  (ii)  improving  disease  management  capacities  for  priority  transboundary  animal \ndiseases (foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine fever); (iii) improving the management of \nrisks  associated  with  the  movement  of  live  animals,  with  additional  financing  supporting  the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  a  national  strategy  to  control  illegal  animal  trade; 17 and \n(iv) improving  the  monitoring  of  veterinary  drugs,  animal  feeds,  and  animal  products  safety \nmonitoring. \n \n14. \nFood safety. The focus will continue to be on: (i) maintaining and expanding the size of \nthe  current  food  safety  surveillance  program  to  assess  more  hazards  and  ensure  its  effective \nimplementation  nationwide  after  the  pilot  work  done  under  the  current  project;  (ii)  providing \ntraining to 700 more food establishments on food safety hazards management, in addition to the \n800 food premises trained under the current project, and grading a further 360 food premises in \naddition to the 360 premises graded under the current project; (iii) providing specific training in \ngood manufacturing practices and good hygiene practices for target food processing companies \nand certification for a subset of these (targeting those keen on exporting); and (iv) improving food-\nborne illness response capacity, which will include selectively strengthening laboratory capacities \nwith upgraded microbial testing abilities to identify key microbiological risks such as salmonella. \nThe project will raise awareness and improve the implementation of food safety standards in the \nfood processing and tourist industries by promoting good hygiene practices, good manufacturing \npractices, and enterprise grading. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Improved Regional Cooperation and Harmonization \n\n \n15. \nThe current project supports the participation of the Lao PDR in various bilateral working \ngroups and consultations on import handling, as well as national measures, in line with regional \nSPS  requirements  including  those  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations.  The  project \nsupports the Lao PDR\u2019s effective participation in regional fora such as the Southeast Asia and \nChina  Foot-and-Mouth  Disease  project;  the  International  Food  Safety  Authorities  Network;  the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  Rapid  Alert  System  for  Food  and  Feed;  and  twinning \narrangements between the Lao PDR and other countries in the region on SPS issues. Through \nimprovements  in  the  national  SPS  framework,  such  as  capacity  building  for  surveillance, \ninspection, monitoring, and data collection, the project facilitates the Lao PDR\u2019s participation and \ncontribution  to  regional SPS  information  exchange  and cooperation  on mutual recognition  and \nharmonization  of  standards  and  regulations.  The  project  will  also  continue  to  support  SPS \ncooperation through bilateral working groups in plant health, animal health, and food safety.18  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput  3:  Enhanced  Education  Levels  and  University  Training  of  Sanitary \nand Phytosanitary Specialists \n\n \n16. \nThe project will focus on upgrading academic education for SPS specialists at the Faculty \nof  Agriculture  at  the  National  University  of  Laos. This  will  cover:  (i)  curricula  updates following \ncurricula development provided in the current project, including harmonization in line with regional \n                                                \n17 Implementation will focus on provinces with international border posts and high levels of transit activity. \n18 This  will  include  the  establishment  of  new  bilateral  groups  (e.g.,  on  plant  health  between  the  Lao  PDR  and  \n\nViet Nam) where necessary. \n\n\f6 \n\nstandards  where  relevant;  (ii)  teaching  quality  improvement;  (iii)  training  opportunities  such  as \nMAF and Ministry of Health internships for students; and (iv) further upgrading of faculty laboratory \nand teaching facilities.  \n \nD. \n \n17. \nfinancing, the Lao PDR project is estimated to cost $24.78 million. \n \n\nThe  original  Lao  PDR  project  was  estimated  to  cost  $14.46  million. 19 With  additional  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan20 ($ million) \n\nItem \n\n  \n\n  \n\nA.

The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that the Lao PDR had a high risk of debt distress \nand was therefore eligible to receive 100% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants.  \n\n\f7 \n\nThe Government of the Lao PDR has requested a grant not exceeding $10 million from \n18. \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  project.  ADB\u2019s \ntotal contribution will be $24 million, amounting to 96.9% of the total project cost. ADB will finance \nrecurrent costs to ensure smooth project implementation and longer-term capacity development. \nIn the original financing, the Government of the Lao PDR financed the equivalent of $0.46 million. \nFor the additional financing, the Government of the Lao PDR will finance the equivalent of $0.32 \nmillion to cover the costs of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions.  \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n19. \nBased on its positive project implementation track record, MAF\u2019s Department of Planning \nwill continue be the project executing agency, or project management unit (PMU). The PMU will \ncontinue to assume its role under the expanded project. The CIUs will also continue to oversee \ntheir  respective  outputs.  The  CIUs  will  be  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  the  Department  of \nLivestock and Fisheries, the Food and Drugs Department, and the Faculty of Agriculture at the \nNational University of Laos. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual.21  \n \n20. \nAll procurement financed by the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as amended from time to time).  Consultant  recruitment  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Project  implementation,  procurement,  and  financial  management  will  be \naligned  with  the  government\u2019s  standard  operating  procedures.  A  project  advance  account \nestablished  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  a  sub-account  administered  by  the  PMU,  will  be \nconsolidated and audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2020 (Grant closing date: 30 June 2021) \nManagement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nJanuary 2018\u2013December 2020 \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv) Implementation unit \n\n \nProcurement   \n\nConsulting services  \n\n \n\n \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nProject steering committee chaired by MAF; members consist of CIU leads \nMAF \nDepartment of Agriculture; Department of Livestock and Fisheries; Food and \nDrugs Department; and Faculty of Agriculture (National University of Laos)   \nPMU (8 staff), each component implementation unit (2\u20133 staff) \nLao PDR \n \nMultiple contracts ($2.964 million) \nNational competitive \nbidding \nShopping  \nDirect purchase \nIndividual consultantsa \n\nMultiple contracts ($0.098 million) \nMultiple contracts ($0.089 million) \n31 contracts; 98 person-months (international); \n186.0 person-months (national) ($2.274 million)  \n2 contracts; 7.5 person-months (international); \n7.5 person-months (national) ($0.155 million) \n5 contracts; 29.0 person-months (international); \n84.0 person-months (national) ($0.757 million) \n\nLeast-cost selection \nmethod \nSingle source selection \n\nAdvance contracting of PMU project management and financial consultants \nin Q3\u2013Q4 2017 for the following positions: international project management \nand procurement advisor; national financial management specialist; national \nprocurement specialist; project administrative assistant; secretary. \n\n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f8 \n\nAspects \nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the Government of Lao PDR and ADB. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, MAF = Ministry of Agriculture and \nForestry, PMU = project management unit, Q = quarter. \na The recruitment of 31 individual consultants instead of a firm is supported in view of the experience of the PMU. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nA key feature of the project technical design is to focus on the components dealing with \n21. \nplant health, animal health, food safety, and academic education for SPS capacity development \nin the Lao PDR. Despite the institutional breadth in each component, technical interventions are \nsimilar  in  focusing  on  strengthening  surveillance  and  inspection  systems,  upgrading  human \nresources, and involving the provision of a range of technical expertise, training, workshops, and \nhardware to achieve this purpose. The additional financing project design will continue to focus \non individual components (i.e., plant health, animal health, food safety, and education) to ensure \ncontinued progress in these aspects.  \n \n22. \nThe major technical design parameters are (i) a recognition that plant, animal, and food \nsafety  surveillance  systems  start  from  a  low  information  and  human  capacity  base,  and  that \nenhancing SPS capacity should take a pragmatic and practical approach; (ii) promoting simple \nand cost-effective approaches where possible (e.g., the use of rapid test kits and construction of \nshared  laboratory  facilities);  and  (iii)  an  emphasis  on  strengthening  university  teaching  as \nopposed  to  research.  The  project  has  been  designed  to  complement  ongoing  and  planned \ninterventions by various development partners and ADB. Subregional cooperation is promoted \nthrough participation in regional SPS fora, bilateral working groups, information exchange, mutual \nrecognition of standards, training attachments, academic exchanges, and twinning arrangements.  \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe economic rationale for the project is that SPS services address market inadequacies \npertaining  to  public  goods  (including  regional  public  goods),  asymmetric  information,  negative \nexternalities,  and  coordination failures  in protecting  plant  and  animal  health and  ensuring food \nsafety. The project is expected to engender significant economic benefits, including an increase \nin the income of producers and exporters of AFF products as a result of lower SPS-related trade \nbarriers,  an  increase  in  farmers\u2019  incomes  owing  to  higher  crop  yields,  a  decrease  in  farmers\u2019 \nlosses from animal diseases, a reduction of the country\u2019s economic losses resulting from food-\nborne diseases, and an increase in domestic income generated by tourism. With an economic \ninternal rate of return of 11.5% and a considerable positive impact on government revenue, the \nproject is economically justifiable and financially sustainable.22  \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  overall  fiduciary  risk  in  the \nLao PDR is moderate. This assessment is based on concerns regarding: (i) transparency in the \nuse of public finances with limited public access to government budget and financial information;  \n(ii)  low  awareness  of  modern  internal  controls  in  the  public  sector;  and  (iii)  weak  government \n                                                \n22 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nGovernance  \n\n\f9 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\noversight and the slow pace of reform. The assessment recommended that detailed consolidated \nannual  project  financial  statements  be  audited  in  accordance  with  international  standards  on \nauditing by an auditor acceptable to ADB, such as the State Audit Organisation of the Lao PDR. \nThe PMU will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly project progress reports, which will include:  \n(i)  a  narrative  description  of  physical  and financial  progress  made  during  the  reporting  period;  \n(ii)  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule;  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered;  and  \n(iv) activities to be undertaken in the next reporting period.   \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n25. \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manuals (footnote 19).  \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe project will increase trade in the Lao PDR\u2019s AFF products as their safety improves \nand  they  gain  acceptance  in  foreign  markets.  Improved  SPS  handling  of  AFF  products  will \nenhance agricultural productivity, making AFF trade more predictable and lowering transaction \ncosts. This should lower consumer prices in markets, contributing to improved living standards \nand increased competitiveness of the Lao PDR. An improved surveillance and outbreak response \nto livestock diseases will benefit rural households, as animal mortality will be reduced. Improved \nnational food surveillance reduces exposure to illness and time off work for all, including the poor. \nRegarding tourism, grading will stabilize and formalize food establishments, indirectly sustaining \nthe  employment  of  workers  in  food  preparation  and  serving.  The  grading  visits  and  audits  of \nnational food safety surveillance systems will also generate formal employment.  \n \n27. \nThe  current  project  is  categorized  as  having  some  gender  benefits,  and  the  additional \nfinancing  will  align  with  this.  Gender  analysis  was  conducted  during  project  preparation,  and \ntargets on women\u2019s participation in training were included in the project design and monitoring \nframework  and  loan  covenants.  Sex-disaggregated  data  collection  was  integrated  into  the \nproject\u2019s  monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  Gender  targets  have  been  met  under  the  current \nproject. As of 31 August 2017, 370 (56%) out of 660 participants of training in food safety handling \nand good manufacturing practice were females (target 30%), 40% of participants in SPS training \nwere females (target 30%), and more than 50% of PMU and CIU staff are women (target 30%). \nAs women dominate agricultural employment in the Lao PDR23 and their participation in tourist-\nrelated  employment  is  high,  they  will  particularly  benefit  from  additional  project  investments. \nSelected gender targets, such as women\u2019s participation in training and the ratio of female staff in \nthe PMU, have been identified and reflected in the design and monitoring framework.24  \n \nE. \n \nThe  resettlement,  environmental  assessment  and  review,  and  indigenous  peoples \n28. \nplanning  frameworks  agreed  by  the  government  and  ADB  were  updated  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). Compliance with safeguard policy and gender requirements \nof the current project is satisfactory. During project implementation, no negative environmental, \nresettlement, or indigenous peoples impacts were encountered as a result of project activities. \nGiven  the  small  scale  and  location  of  the  proposed  civil  works,  minimal  impacts  during \nconstruction are anticipated, and these can be dealt with by adhering to national environmental, \nhealth, and safety regulations. The additional financing project is classified category C for impacts \non the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n                                                \n23 Women account for over 50% of workers engaged in agriculture in the Lao PDR. \n24 The target identification draws from the results and data collected under the current project. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  management  plan.25 The  overall  risk  of  the  project  is  moderate,  with \nmitigating measures.  The project will strengthen staff capacity in financial management to allow \nefficient  accounting  and  reporting  of  financial  performance.  It  will  establish  or  use  existing \nministerial  websites to:  (i)  disclose  project  progress,  bid notifications,  and their results;  and (ii) \nprovide a grievance mechanism for corrupt practices.  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisk \nPublic financial management.  \nLack of sustainability of project \nachievements after completion \nowing to insufficient government \nbudget allocation to operations \ncost and systems maintenance.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe government has made assurances that it will allocate annual \nbudgetary resources to cover recurrent costs related to the \noperation and maintenance of the surveillance, inspection, and \nmonitoring systems for plant health, animal health, and food \nsafety.
