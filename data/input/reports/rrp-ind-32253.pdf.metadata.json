Its key components are: (i) rehabilitation and widening of \nthe Golden Quadrilateral, approximately 6,000 kilometers (km) of \nhighway network, slated to be completed by the end of 2003 \n(phase 1); and (ii) rehabilitation and widening of the North-South \n(N-S; 4,000 km) and East-West (E-W; 3,300 km) corridors, which \nare to be completed by the end of 2007 (phase 2).  \n \n  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided two loans in 2000 \nand  2001  to  develop  the  Golden  Quadrilateral.  The  proposed \nProject is the first in the series of loans to be extended to the E-W \nand N-S corridors, mainly to remove the capacity constraints in \nthe E-W Corridor in the State of Gujarat by expanding 504 km of \ntwo-lane national highways into four lanes. Of these, 468 km will \nbe developed under a straightforward public finance arrangement, \nand the remaining 36 km under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) \nscheme. \n \nRationale  ADB takes a programmatic approach to achieve its medium- to \nlong-term goals in a progressive and evolutionary manner. The \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  (RRP)  on  the \nWestern Transport Corridor Project states these goals as follows: \n(i) transform the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) into a \nmanagerially and financially autonomous body, (ii) enhance its \nfund  mobilization  and  financial  management  capability,  (iii) \nstrengthen institutional capacity for project implementation and \nhighway  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  (iv)  institute \ntransparent corporate governance, and (v) promote public-private \npartnerships.  \n \nThe Project intends to pursue these goals through policy dialogue \nand assistance programs that will (i) secure more funds for phase \n2 of NHDP, (ii) establish \u201can arm\u2019s-length relationship\u201d between \nNHAI  and  its  oversight  agency,  (iii)  institute  a  clearly  defined \norganizational structure with increased accountability for O&M, \nand  (iv)  facilitate  private  sector  participation  through  BOT \nschemes.  \n \n ", "iv   \nObjectives and Scope  ADB\u2019s multi-year lending program to NHDP aims to establish an \nenabling environment for efficient highway development and O&M \nwith  maximum  private  sector  participation.  The  Project  was \ndesigned to (i) facilitate the transformation of NHAI into a lean and \nefficient  organization  with  strong  managerial  and  financial \nautonomy; (ii) reduce the capacity constraint of the E-W Corridor \nby rehabilitating and widening the two-lane highways to four-lane \nstandard; (iii) promote public-private partnership by helping NHAI \ndesign  and  implement  a  BOT  component;  and  (iv)  strengthen \nNHAI\u2019s  capacity  to  deal  with  emerging  social  issues  such  as \ngrievance  handling,  stakeholder  participation,  communicable \ndiseases, and road safety. \n   \nCost Estimates  Total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $576  million  equivalent, \nincluding  allowances  for  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction.  Foreign  exchange  costs  are  estimated  at  $377 \nmillion, representing 65% of the total cost, while the local currency \ncosts are estimated at $199 million equivalent, representing 35%. \n   \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $320 million from its \nordinary capital resources to help finance the Project, while the \nGovernment  cover  the  foreign  currency  cost  of  $28  million  to \ncover the front-end fee and interest during construction, and $183 \nmillion equivalent in local currency cost. \n \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total  Percentage \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n                 \nAsian Development Bank    320    0    320    56% \nGovernment    28    183    211    37% \nPrivate Sector    29    16    45    8% \n   Total    377    199    576    100% \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $320 million from the ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nand Project Agreements. The Government will cover the cost of \n$211 million equivalent in foreign and local currency cost. The \nGovernment will promptly make the proceeds of the loan available \nto NHAI. The Government\u2019s current policy of assistance to NHAI \nfor the Golden Quadrilateral in this regard is a loan-grant ratio of \n20:80, and for this Project, that forms part of the E-W Corridor, \nPublic Investment Board clearance has already been given in a \nloan-grant ratio of 20:80 on which a cabinet decision is expected \nsoon. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk of the \nloan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2006 \n   ", "    v \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2006 \nCompletion Date   \n \nExecuting Agency  NHAI \n \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented by two project implementation \nArrangements  units to be established by NHAI along the project highways. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of civil works will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  following  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required for construction supervision. \nThey will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection  \nmethod  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  use  of \nConsultants,  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nselecting and engaging domestic consultants. \n \nProject Benefits and  The  main  quantifiable  project  benefit  is  savings  in  vehicle \nBeneficiaries  operating costs, which will reduce transport costs. The Project\u2019s \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  22%.  Direct \nbeneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  road  users  and  transport \noperators. Since the transport industry is competitive and likely to \npass on the benefits of transport cost savings to end users, the \npublic will also benefit. \n \nImproved road networks will increase the economic opportunities \nof the rural poor by (i) enabling villagers to shift from subsistence \nfarming to market oriented agricultural surplus production; and (ii) \nencouraging poor agricultural workers to move out of their villages \nto work in better-paid occupations in manufacturing or trading. \nImproved  roads  will  also  provide  social  benefits  such  as  (i) \nimproved access to health, education, and social services; and \n(iii) increased access to learning opportunities, thus reducing the \nsense  of  isolation  from  cultural  and  commercial  centers.  The \nProject will also have a short-term impact on poverty reduction. \nConstruction  works  and  tree  planting,  together  with  ensuing \nmaintenance works, will allow the rural poor to earn cash. They \nare generally not engaged in wage-earning jobs and are thus \nlargely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment, so \nthese opportunities have a direct impact on earnings. \n ", "vi   \nRisks and Assumptions  A potential risk is delayed implementation due to proplonged land \nacquisition.  However,  the  need  for  land  acquisition  is  limited \nexcept for the two bypasses, grade separations, and realignments \nalong  the  existing  routes.  Additional  land  required  for  service \nroads and drainage lines is mostly available within the existing \nright of way. The land acquisition procedures recently introduced \nby the National Highway Act (1997) will minimize the potential risk \nof implementation delay. The new procedure will enable NHAI to \nproceed with land acquisition more expeditiously and predictably.  \n \nResettlement could also delay project implementation. Mobilizing \nthe implementing nongovernment organizations (NGOs) within 2 \nmonths of ADB Board approval of the Project has also minimized \nthis  risk.  NGO  staff  will  process  and  resolve  all  resettlement-\nrelated matters, including payment of compensation. Coordination \nmechanisms will be established at the state and district levels to \nresolve land acquisition or resettlement-related issues \n   ", "     \n ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the East-West Corridor Project.   \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  India\u2019s 58,000-kilometer (km) national highway (NH) system, 2% of India\u2019s total road \nnetwork in length, carries over 40% of the country\u2019s road traffic. Yet the system's highway \ncapacity, riding quality, and road safety are all poor.  \n \n3.  Highway Capacity.  Of all NHs, 38% still have one lane; 59%, two lanes; and 3%, four \nor more lanes. Nearly half of these roads are seriously congested, with volume capacity ratio of \nmore  than  1.3.  With  rapid  economic  expansion  in  the  last  10  years  at  the  rate  of  6-7% \ninadequate highway capacity has seriously threatened the continued expansion of the national \neconomy. The Government has thus launched the National Highways Development Program \n(NHDP), an ambitious program to upgrade 13,000 km of NHs to increase the percentage of \nfour- and six-lane highways from 3% to 22% by 2007.  \n \n4.  Riding Quality.  Poor road conditions reduce the average vehicle speed and thus raise \nvehicle operating costs. On project highways, for example, the average vehicle speed is 38 km \nper hour, enabling vehicles to travel only 300 km per day as opposed to 500-600 km per day in \nadvanced economies. The international roughness index is currently 4\u20137 meter (m) per km on \nNHs and is to be improved to 2.5\u20133.0 m per km by 2007 on NHDP roads.  \n \n5.  Road Safety. Poor driving conditions, coupled with the undivided carriageway design of \nNHs, caused traffic accidents to rise at an average of 5% per year in 1971-1998. Among Asian \ncountries, India ranks fourth for road traffic accidents. The number of fatalities per 10,000 \nvehicles in India is 20, which is lower than in Bangladesh (45), People's Republic of China (25), \nand Sri Lanka (24), but significantly higher than in Viet Nam (11), Thailand (10), and Malaysia \n(9).1  As a leading economy in Asia, India should reduce this figure to 10 in 10-15 years.  \n    \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n6.  The highway sector has long suffered from lack of funding, weak project implementation \ncapability, and lack of clear separation between policy and implementation functions of the \nGovernment, resulting in a huge backlog of highway development and maintenance programs, \nwhich has led the Government to start reforms (Appendix 3 for the sector profile). \n \n7.  The most important was the establishment of the National Highways Authority of India \n(NHAI) as an operating arm of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) by the \nNational Highways Authority of India Act of 1988, to develop, maintain, and manage NHs vested \nin or entrusted to, by the Government. The act allows NHAI to engage the private sector in \nhighway development and operation and maintenance (O&M) and to mobilize funds from capital \nmarkets.  NHAI does so as a government authority, not as a corporation, as NHs are a mixture \nof the public and private goods and because NH development needs public sector funds. \n \n                                                           \n1 Road Safety Guidelines of ADB.  ", "2 \n8.  Since NHAI started operating in 1995, its size and scale of operations have grown \nsignificantly. Starting with a dozen staff and capital of Rs7 billion, NHAI now has over 500 staff \nand  handles  more  than  Rs40\u2013100  billion  per  year.  NHAI's  mandate  is  to  rehabilitate  and \nupgrade three key national corridors: the 5,800 km Golden Quadrilateral; the 3,300 km East-\nWest  (E-W)  Corridor;  and  the  4,000  km  North-South  (N-S)  Corridor  (Map,  Supplementary \nAppendix Y). Total program cost is estimated at $13 billion, unprecedented in government \ninvestment in transport.  \n \n1.   Policy Dialogue \n \n9.  Implementation of such an enormous program requires an enabling policy environment.  \nThe Government has taken steps to create it by \n \n(i)  simplifying the century-old land acquisition procedure by amending the National \nHighways Act in 1997; \n \n(ii)  issuing a policy guideline2 in 1997 to facilitate private sector participation in \nhighway development, and implementing several key policy actions, including (a) \ngovernment commitment to acquiring land, removing utilities, and cutting trees \nalong the right of way before land is concessioned to the private sector; and (b) \nauthorization of NHAI to extend grants to private sector investors up to 40% of \ncapital cost; \n \n(iii)  adopting a policy in 1997 that, once a national highway is upgraded to four lanes, \ntolls can be collected on it; \n \n(iv)  revamping the central road fund by introducing an additional excise duty levied \non petrol and diesel (\u201ccess\u201d) in 1998 and 1999 (Supplemental Appendix U); and \n \n(v)  delegating broad decision-making authority to NHAI in 2000 so it could decide on \nindividual  investments  and  procurement  without  going  through  the  lengthy \nprocess of obtaining approval from the Public Investment Board (PIB). \n \n10.  While these policy actions have significantly changed NH sector management, the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  adopted  a  programmatic  approach  to  solving  remaining \nproblems. ADB has set medium- to long-term goals for intervention in the NH subsector and \npursues them in a progressive and evolutionary manner through multiyear lending operations \nrather  than  project  by  project.  The  goals  include  (i)  strengthening  institutional  capacity  to \nimplement  projects  and  manage  contracts,  (ii)  strengthening  financing  and  financial \nmanagement capability, (iii) enhancing highway operations and management, (iv) advancing \npublic-private  partnerships,  and  (v)  transforming  NHAI  into  a  financially  and  managerially \nautonomous body. \n \n11.  Noticeable progress has been made in all reform fronts with ADB assistance.  To \nimprove project implementation capacity, ADB has provided two technical assistance (TAs): \none3 to enhance NHAI\u2019s capacity for social development, and the other4 to strengthen NHAI\u2019s \ncapacity  for  contract  management,  with  resultant  strengthening  of  NHAI\u2019s  project \n                                                           \n2 MORTH. 1997.

Initiatives have been undertaken in the other areas listed in the above \npara. \n \n12.  Financing. To develop NHDP, NHAI has relied on a diverse array of financing sources. \nApproximately 50% of NHAI investment funding has been directly or indirectly mobilized through \nannual  contributions  from  cess.  Grants  and  loans  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies \naccount  for  an  estimated  25%  of  total  investment  funding.  The  remaining  25%  of  NHAI\u2019s \ninvestment is financed through debt and a mix of other mechanisms, including build-operate-\ntransfer (BOT) concessions, build-lease-transfer (BLT) annuities, and special-purpose vehicle \n(SPV) scheme.  \n \n13.  Having started phase 1 of NHDP (highway construction), NHAI has begun phase 2 \n(development of the N-S and E-W corridors). An estimated additional Rs350 billion is required to \ndevelop 7,300 km more. Based on its projected level of borrowing and the level of funds already \ncommitted for investment in 1,000-2,000 km of phase 2, NHAI could support an estimated \nadditional Rs50 billion\u2013100 billion debt starting in 2005/06. Completion of the remaining 5,300-\n6,300 km of phase 2 could require financing the remaining Rs250 billion\u2013300 billion, which, in \nturn, would need a substantial increase in revenue from either cess or tolls, or their combination.  \n  \n14.  ADB should initiate policy dialogue with the Government on the future financing strategy \nfor  phase  2,  especially  the  possibility  of  increasing  the  cess  and  collecting  tolls  more \naggressively.  The  prerequisite  for  policy  dialogue  is  cash-flow  analysis  to  enable  the \nGovernment to evaluate a variety of financing scenarios and the resultant financial performance \nof NHAI. A cash-flow model was developed and preliminary analysis carried out under the \nongoing project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the National Highway Corridor\u2013\nPublic-Private Partnership Project (Supplementary Appendix Z).  The analysis results are under \nreview by NHAI. During project appraisal, the parties agreed that the NHAI analysis results \nwould  be  discussed  with  ADB  and  also  with  relevant  government  agencies  to  develop  a \nmedium-term financing strategy for phase 2.  \n \n15.  Managerial Autonomy. With the initiation of NHDP program, NHAI has been able to \nachieve  a  significant  level  of  managerial  autonomy.  With  expanded  board  membership  to \ninclude key ministerial officials from the Department of Expenditure, Planning Commission, and \nMORTH,  the  NHAI  board  has  been  able  to  exercise  broader  authorities  with  respect  to \nprocurement and disbursement decisions.  However, NHAI is subjected to several constraints \nincluding the lack of official sanction being accorded to NHAI to retain tolls as its own revenue. \nA further review would be necessary, from a long-term perspective, on the need of establishing \nan \u201carm\u2019s length relationship\u201d between NHAI and line ministries. \n \n16.  Difficulties in retaining essential staff within NHAI should also be urgently addressed. \nAlmost all professional staff of NHAI are deputed from MORTH or from the state public works \ndepartments (PWDs) for 2 years, with a possible 3-year extension. Deputation may meet short-\nterm construction and other needs, but continuity of staff assignment is critically important to \nfundamentally and consistently change the institution. Deputation has also weakened the results \nof capacity-building efforts made by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies. The current staffing \npractices should be assessed, and an effective staffing policy, developed so that NHAI can be \nmore efficient and effective.  During project appraisal, the parties agreed that the two issues \n ", "4 \nwould be addressed by the ongoing Institutional Strengthening Study financed by the World \nBank and jointly reviewed with ADB.5   \n \n17.  Operation and Maintenance. For the past few years, NHAI has been in accelerated \nconstruction mode with less attention being paid to O&M. As more highways are constructed \nand placed in service, O&M is becoming an increasingly important agenda for NHAI. Newly \ncreated assets need to be appropriately sustained, and their ROW kept clear, i.e. free from \nencroachment. To explore possible operational approaches to best address O&M issues, NHAI \nhas initiated pilot programs for corridor management units (CMUs).6 While CMU approach \nneeds to be further pursued, NHAI should also start to look at the revenue earning aspect of toll \nroad  operation.  During  the  appraisal,  it  was  agreed  to  initiate  a  study  to  examine  the \norganizational options that would best support effective management and delivery of NHAI\u2019s \nO&M functions, including the possibility of establishing a separate line of business for O&M \nactivities. The study will be undertaken again as a part of the above Institutional Strengthening \nStudy (see Supplementary Appendix D for more detailed discussions on the O&M issue). \n \n18.  Private  Sector  Participation.  Since  1999,  NHAI  has  actively  explored  options  to \nincrease private sector participation in highway development. While it has been successful in \ninvolving the private sector in small investments in short highway sections and bypasses, NHAI \nhas  had  difficulty  attracting  larger  private  investment  in  longer  sections.  This  trend  may, \nhowever, be changing at least for the high-density traffic corridors such as Golden Quadrilateral. \nThe Delhi-Gurgaon section, a 28 km stretch of six and/or eight lanes, and the Jaipur-Kishangarh \nsection, a 98 km stretch, were recently successfully tendered as BOT schemes for $117 million \nand $137 million, respectively. This trend is attributable to (i) increased interest in highway \ndevelopment of India\u2019s financial institutions, which have devised innovative financial instruments \nsupported  by  sophisticated  risk  allocation  mechanisms;  and  (ii)  development  of  alternative \nprivate sector investment schemes including BLT annuities and SPVs. NHAI\u2019s future challenge \nis how to secure private sector participation in the less trafficked routes such as the E-W and N-\nS corridors. ADB will continue to assist this process through public sector operation and private \nsector operation arms (e.g., an NHAI annuity-based project being considered under ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations). \n \n2.   Lessons Learned \n \n19.  Since 1988, ADB has given India five loans for NH projects: Road Improvement ($198 \nmillion, 1988); Second Road ($250 million, 1990); National Highways ($245 million, 1993); \nSurat-Manor  Tollway  Project  ($180  million,  2000);  and  Western  Transport  Corridor  ($240 \nmillion, 2001). Implementation of the first three were significantly delayed by operational and \ninstitutional shortcomings, many of which have been overcome in the last two. Measures taken \nin these projects include (i) allowing advance procurement of civil works and recruitment of \nsupervision consultants, ensuring award of contracts before loan effectiveness; (ii) establishing \nproject implementation units (PIUs) before loan effectiveness and appointment of key staff to \nprepare  the  Project  for  execution;  (iii)  removing  utilities  and  other  encumbrances  before \nconstruction  starts;  (iv)  increasing  the  size  of  contract  packages  to  attract  experienced \ninternational contractors; and (v) raising the level of authority of the independent engineer under \nthe contract to ensure efficient and quick decision making during execution. \n                                                           \n5  The study was financed by the World Bank. Based on the discussion between ADB, the World Bank, and NHAI, the \nstudy's scope was expanded to include the institutional reform elements ADB regards as important. The study is \nunder way, and will be jointly reviewed by ADB and the World Bank. \n6  Financed by two World Bank Projects: Third National Highway Project (2000) and Grand Trunk Line Project (2001). \n ", "     5 \nIII.  PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n20.  The overall objective of ADB\u2019s multiyear lending program to NHDP is to establish an \nenabling environment for efficient highway development and O&M with maximum private sector \nparticipation. This year\u2019s project focuses on the western half of the E-W Corridor to achieve the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  Facilitate  the  transformation  of  NHAI  into  a  lean  and  efficient  highway \nmanagement organization with stronger managerial and financial autonomy. \n \n(ii)  Reduce  the  capacity  constraint  on  the  E-W  Corridor  by  rehabilitating  and \nwidening highways to four lanes. \n \n(iii)  Promote public-private partnership by helping NHAI design and implement a \nBOT component. \n \n(iv)   Strengthen  NHAI\u2019s  capacity  to  deal  with  emerging  social  issues  such  as \ngrievance handling, stakeholder participation, communicable diseases, and road \nsafety.  \n \nB.    Components and Outputs \n \n21.  To achieve the objectives, the Project has the following components: \n \n(i)  Investment.  Two-lane  highways  totaling  468.3  km  will  be  rehabilitated  and \nwidened  to  dual  two-lane  carriageways  with  various  road  safety  features \n(Supplementary Appendix E). These sections, once constructed, will be operated \nand  maintained  by  private  sector  contractors  under  O&M  agreement  to  be \nconcluded with NHAI. Sections to be financed under this component are: (i) \nPorbandar \u2013 Bhiladi (50.5km); (ii) Bhiladi \u2013 Jetpur (64.5km); (iii)  Bamanbore \u2013 \nGaramore  (71.4km);  (iv)  Garamore  \u2013  Gogadhar  (106.2km);  (v)  Gogadha  \u2013 \nRadhanpur (106.2km); and (iv) Radhanpur \u2013 Deesa (85.4 km). \n \n(ii)  Private Sector Participation. This component will support NHAI prepare BOT \npackage for identified sections between Jetpur\u2013Bamanbore. Given the level of \nanticipated  volume  of  traffic  which  is  significantly  lower  than  Golden \nQuadrilateral,  the  E-W  and  N-S  corridors  require  an  innovative  approach  in \ndesigning BOT packages if they are to attract an adequate level of interest from \nthe private sector.7 Development of \u201cgreen field\u201d components (Jetpur-Gondal \nsection - 26 km highway and 10 km Rajkot Bypass section) alone would not \nprovide a rate of return attractive to the private sector, but their combination with \n\u201cbrown field\u201d component(s) including four-laned section of the Gondal\u2013Rajkot \nwould present a sufficiently attractive package which would yield a reasonably \nhigh  rate  of  return  (see  Appendix  4  for  detailed  analysis).  Support  for  the \npreparation of these packages has been, and would continue to be, provided \nunder the PPTA (which is partially funded by the Project). An agreement has also \n                                                           \n7  While the development of one fifth of E-W and N-S corridors have already been undertaken, none has been \ndeveloped by the private sector to date. \n ", "6 \nbeen reached with NHAI for their engagement of a financial advisor with its own \nfund (see Supplementary Appendix F for terms of reference (TOR)). \n \n(iii)  Capacity Building. This component will strengthen NHAI\u2019s capacity to deal with \nemerging social issues: (i) grievance handling, (ii) stakeholder participation, (iii) \nHIV/AIDS,8  (iv)  resettlement,  and  (v)  road  safety.  NHAI  recently  established \nwithin it the Environment and Social Development Unit (ESDU) to coordinate \nactivities (i) to (iv). The general manager of the Corridor Management Unit will \ncoordinate  activity  (v).  TA  will  be  provided  to  implement  these  activities.9 \nSupplementary Appendix G provides outline TOR for this TA and implementation \narrangements. The following modules will deal with the social issues: \n \n(a)  Grievance  handling.  Training  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  NHAI\u2019s \ncapacity to deal with and quickly respond to grievances filed by people \nand/or nongovernment organizations (NGOs) affected by the Project. This \nmodule was based on the lessons learned from recent inspection cases, \nwhich indicate that many of the possible cases could have been avoided \nif  the  complaints  had  been  properly  handled  early  on  by  executing \nagencies.    \n \n(b)  Stakeholder  participation  module.  NHAI  tries  to  strengthen \ncommunication with key stakeholders through the recently established \nAdvisory  Council.  NHAI  has  also  decided  to  strengthen  the  general \nconsultation process with a broader range of stakeholders to increase \ntheir understanding of the Project and obtain feedback early on in project \npreparation. NHAI management and staff will be familiarized with the \nconcept of stakeholder participation and best practices in participation.  \n \n(c)  HIV/AIDS.  NHAI  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention \ncampaigns with the help of an NGO. Activities will include field campaigns \nat  truck  parking  spaces  and  other  appropriate  locations  to  increase \nawareness of truck drivers, construction workers, sex workers, and local \ncommunities  about  the  risks  and  danger  of  HIV/AIDS.  HIV/AIDS \nawareness brochures will also be distributed at tollbooths. \n \n(d)  Resettlement. Resettlement officers and NGO staff will be trained to \nwork for PIUs.  \n \n(e)  Road safety. Advisory service will be provided to develop a mechanism \nfor a regular highway patrol system and emergency medical services \n(phase 1). The mechanism will be tested on a pilot program basis in the \nproposed BOT component. Under the mechanism, service contracts will \nbe concluded with the state police and State Medical Department, and \nrelevant clauses, drafted and incorporated in the BOT contract. Building \non the pilot program, advisory service will be provided to explore the \npossibility of applying a similar mechanism to NHDP highway systems on \n                                                           \n8 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n9 The mission will seek management\u2019s approval to modify the scope of the advisory TA for the corporate finance \nenhancement study on reallocating the cost of phase-2 activities (which will be canceled due to the incorporation of \nphase-2 activities in the World Bank-financed study for institutional strengthening).  \n ", "     7 \na network-wide basis. In addition, advisory service would be provided to \ndevelop  a  highway  police  system  covering  the  entire  NHAI  network \n(phase 2).   \n \nC.   Special Feature \n \n22.  The programmatic approach adopts a mechanism that starts project processing when an \nagreed-on milestone (a trigger point) is achieved.10 During the 2002 pre-country programming \nmission, the project trigger point was set as substantial progress of private sector participation in \nhighway development. The Fact-Finding Mission of May 2002 reviewed the project trigger point \nand found that substantial progress had been made in private sector participation. In the last 3 \nyears, NHAI introduced six BOT projects, eight annuity-based concession projects, and one \nSPV,  which,  combined,  accounted  for  14%  of  the  length  of  the  Golden  Quadrilateral  \n(Supplementary Appendix H, para. 18). The Mission then began to process the Project.  \n \nD.   Cost Estimates \n \n23.  The total project cost is estimated at $575.8 million equivalent, including allowances for \ncontingencies and interest during construction. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $376.9 \nmillion, representing 65.4% of the total cost, while the local currency costs are estimated at \n$198.9 million equivalent, representing 34.6% (Table 1 and Appendix 5).  \n \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local   \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Total \nA.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor the Western Transport Corridor.  Manila. para. 31. \n ", "8 \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n24.  The Government has requested a loan of $320 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n25.  The Government will cover the foreign currency cost of $27.8 million to cover the front-\nend-fee and the interest during construction. The Government will also cover the local currency \ncost equivalent to $182.9 million. The proceeds of the loan will be made available by the \nGovernment to NHAI promptly as required for the purposes of the Project. The Government\u2019s \ncurrent policy of assistance to NHAI for Golden Quadrilateral in this regard is a loan-grant ratio \nof 20:80, and for this Project, that forms part of the E-W Corridor, PIB clearance has already \nbeen given in a loan-grant ratio of 20:80 on which a cabinet decision is expected soon. The \nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan. Civil works between Jetpur and \nGondal section and Rajkot Bypass section of the Project will be carried out under BOT scheme. \nThe cost for the works, $45.1 million equivalent, will be covered by a private concessionaire. \nThe detailed financing plan is provided in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percentage\n         \nAsian Development Bank    320.0    0.0    320.0    56% \nGovernment    27.8    182.9    210.7    37% \nPrivate Sector    29.1    16.0    45.1    8% \n         \n  Total    376.9    198.9    575.8    100% \n \n \nF.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Project Management  \n \n26.  NHAI will be the Executing Agency for the Project (Supplementary Appendix I for NHAI\u2019s \norganization). The Project will be implemented by two specially created PIUs, which will be \nlocated in Rajkot for the sections between Porbandar and Samakhiyali, and in Palanpur for the \nsections between Samakhiyali and Deesa.  PIUs should be adequately staffed, which should be \ncompleted within two months of loan effectiveness, and in any case, prior to the award of civil \nworks contracts under the Project, whichever is earlier. Two general manager level staff will be \nassigned as project directors, one for each PIU, who would be assisted by three/four deputy \ngeneral  managers  or  managers,  each  responsible  for  one  contract  package  or  a  BOT \ncomponent. An additional deputy general manager or manager would be assigned for each of \nthe PIU for overseeing resettlement activities and also handling grievances to be filed by the \npublic  including  project  affected  persons  and  NGOs.  An  accountant/financial  management \n ", "     9 \nspecialist will be assigned for each PIU. The activities of the PIUs will be overseen by the \nChairperson of NHAI who will be assisted by a chief general manager in-charge of the E-W \nCorridor  development.  Sufficient  administrative  authority  will  be  delegated  to  the  PIUs  for \neffective  and  timely  implementation  of  the  Project.  Supplementary  Appendix  J  gives  the \norganization structure of PIUs. \n \n  2.  Implementation Schedule and Period  \n \n27.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  48  months,  inclusive  of  procurement  and \npreconstruction, and is expected to be completed by 30 June 2006. The schedule will allow for \nland acquisition and resettlement and clearance of all utilities, trees, and any other obstructions \nfrom the land to be used for construction. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.   \n \n  3.  Procurement  \n \n28.  Civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement \nfollowing  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Civil  works  will  be  divided  into  six \npackages. The contract packages ($47 million\u201388 million) are large enough to attract capable \ncontractors  with  international  experience.  A  list  of  contract  packages  and  the  mode  of \nprocurement are in Appendix 7. To expedite procurement, in July 2002 ADB approved advance \naction for prequalification. The Government has been advised that this approval does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n  4.  Consulting Services  \n \n29.  Given the length of project highways, NHAI decided to engage two consulting firms as \nproject engineers to ensure adequate construction supervision of civil works. With the expanded \npower of the engineer, as adopted in the Western Transport Corridor Project, NHAI will continue \nto ensure objective and transparent processing of contract variations. NHAI will also engage \nanother consulting firm of similar function for the BOT component. NHAI will engage these three \nconsulting  firms  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  for  full  technical  proposals  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. Summary TOR \nfor these services are in Supplementary Appendix K. Consultant inputs will consist of 3,414 \nperson-months (447 for international and 2,967 for domestic) with an estimated cost of $18.4 \nmillion.  \n \n  5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n30.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001) and Interim Guidelines for Disbursement, Operations; LIBOR-Based \nLoan Products (July 2002), as amended from time to time, using direct payment. To facilitate \nproject  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  funds,  an  imprest  account  may  be \nestablished by the Government with the Reserve Bank of India. The imprest account will be \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nThe  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  is  not  to  exceed  estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. Any individual \npayment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement-of-expenditures  method  for \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures for consulting services will not exceed the equivalent of \n$300,000. \n ", "10 \n  6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n31.  NHAI will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify works, goods, and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds; financing resources received; expenditures incurred \nfor the Project; and local funds. The project accounts will be established and maintained in \naccordance with sound accounting principles.  \n \n32.  NHAI\u2019s  accounting  system  has  been  established  in  accordance  with  government \nrequirements, and its financial statements are prepared in a format prescribed by the Controller \nand Auditor General of India who audits NHAI's financial statements annually (Supplementary \nAppendix L). As a public sector authority, NHAI\u2019s accounting system generally adheres to basic \ncommercial  accounting  practices  commonly  employed  in  India  and  is  in  accordance  with \ngenerally  accepted  accounting  practices  (GAAP)  of  India.  Accrual  accounting  is  used, \ntransactions are recorded on a historical cost basis, and a balance sheet and a profit-and-loss \nstatement are annually prepared (see Supplementary Appendix M for financial statements of \nNHAI). \n \n33.  NHAI operates as an agent of the Government with primary responsibility for developing \nNHs. Road infrastructure is vested or entrusted from the Government to NHAI but not recorded \nsince no value is attached to the infrastructure. On the balance sheet, nonrecurrent expenditures \nfor road improvement are shown as work in progress until completion. An accounting policy to \nconvert these works in progress into fixed assets in the books has yet to be determined. \n \n34.  NHAI\u2019s primary source of reported revenue is the management fee received from the \nGovernment in return for completing the entrusted works. Toll revenues are not treated as NHAI \nincome but as accounts payable to the Government. Interest received on unused advances is \nnot treated as NHAI income but recognized as a capital surplus or an increase to capital. As of \nFY2001, the main differences between NHAI accounting practices and statement presentation, \nand GAAP of India are detailed in the notes to the financial statements.  \n \n35.  An independent auditor satisfactory to ADB will annually audit NHAI project accounts and \nfinancial statements. The audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year to which the accounts relate, and the audited financial \nstatements, not later than 9 months. The annual audit of the project account should cover the \nimprest account and statement-of-expenditure procedure. During the Appraisal Mission, NHAI \nwas made aware of ADB\u2019s policy on delayed submission and the importance of satisfactory and \nacceptable quality of the audited reports. NHAI has appointed M/s Price Waterhouse Coopers, \nIndia, as its internal auditors effective for FY2002. As part of the assignment, the company is \nrequired to advise on accounting policies and practices and internal control procedures, conduct \na 100% post-audit of all transactions, and certify NHAI\u2019s statements of expenditures to be \nsubmitted to funding agencies.  \n \n36.  NHAI will provide quarterly reports to ADB on project execution. Three months after \nproject completion, NHAI will provide ADB with a project completion report. \n \n  7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n37.  With help from the supervision consultants, NHAI will monitor and evaluate project \nperformance in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System Handbook. \nPrimary monitoring indicators to be used by NHAI and reported to ADB will be (i) percentage of \nroads  without  discernable  congestion,  to  measure  capacity  expansion;  (ii)  international \n ", "     11 \nroughness index, to measure the riding quality of the project roads; (iii) travel time, to measure \nincreased  efficiency  for  passenger  transport;  (iv)  freight  for  trucking  service,  to  measure \nreduction in transport costs; (v) traffic fatalities, to measure increased road safety; and (vi) \nlength of highway sections to be developed by the private sector, to measure the extent of \nprivate sector participation. \n \n38.  Initial and target values for each indicator, together with the methodologies for compiling \ndata, are in Supplementary Appendix N. Similar set of performance monitoring indicators will be \nused for all NHAI projects to be financed by ADB under the programmatic approach. \n \n8.  Project Supervision and Review \n  \n39.  Soon after the loan approval of the Project, a project inception mission will be fielded to \nstart project implementation. The Government and NHAI will periodically review the Project to \nassess and evaluate its scope, implementation arrangements (with participation of local NGOs \nand community), benefit monitoring, progress, and achievement in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProject Performance Management Systems Handbook. NHAI and ADB will undertake a midterm \nproject  review  in  May  2004  to  (i)  evaluate  the  project  scope,  design,  and  implementation \narrangements; (ii) identify changes needed since project appraisal; (iii) assess implementation \nperformance against project performance indicators; (iv) review resettlement operations; (v) \nreview and establish compliance with the legal covenants; (vi) identify problems and constraints; \nand (vii) if necessary, recommend changes in project design or implementation. If the midterm \nreview concludes that project implementation should be changed, NHAI and ADB will agree on \nappropriate  measures,  including  changes  in  implementation  arrangements,  to  ensure  that \nproject objectives are met. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nC.  Social Aspects  \n \n40.  An  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation. \nParticipatory processes were applied, including consultation with local communities and persons \naffected by the Project about the proposed highway improvements. The communities were \nsupportive of the Project owing to its significant economic benefits and road safety features \nincorporated  in  highway  design.  Scheduled  tribes  live  in  the  project  areas.  A  preliminary \nassessment report on indigenous people indicated that the Project will not specifically impact on \nscheduled tribes. As scheduled tribes living in the project areas are already integrated into \nmainstream communities, a separate indigenous peoples development plan was not required. \nAs a vulnerable group, however, STs will receive special assistance under the resettlement plan \nDuring the Fact-Finding Mission, a summary poverty reduction and social strategy was prepared \n(Appendix 8). \n \n  1.  Resettlement  \n \n41.  The existing right of way of the project highways is generally 45 m except for NH14 and \nNH15,  which  have  60  m  rights  of  way.  The  proposed  four-lane  highways  comprise  7  m \nsegregated carriageway divided by medians of varying widths and, on the average, 2 X 1.5 m \npaved shoulder. Highway improvement will be carried out within the existing right of way except \nfor minor realignments and two bypasses. Therefore, new land acquisition will be minimal and \nconfined largely to construction of bypasses in Ranavav and Upleta. An estimated 364 ha of \nland will be acquired, half of which are privately owned (mainly agricultural), and the remainder, \n ", "12 \ngovernment-owned uncultivated wasteland. Land acquisition will likely affect 308 households, of \nwhich only about 25 may require relocation; the rest will lose only agricultural plots. Land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts were minimized by (i) keeping the improvement works \nwithin the right of way, (ii) adopting asymmetrical widening, (iii) elevating carriageways over \ngraveyard  and/or  cultural  sites,  and  (iv)  constructing  bypasses  to  avoid  congested  urban \nsettlements.  \n \n42.  The census/socioeconomic surveys carried out in May 2002 generated a full inventory of \nlosses by affected persons for relocation assistance and other relocation purposes (Appendix \n9). In all, 2,526 households/businesses (13,064 persons) will be affected, but the impact will be \nlargely limited to the roadside squatters/informal settlers and small business enterprises (SBE). \nOf  all  affected  units  (informal  settlers,  SBEs,  and  agricultural  families),  68%  are \nbusiness/commercial enterprises. Owners of SBEs are \u201cillegal\u201d occupants of right-of-way land. \nAn estimated 1,000 informal households/SBEs will require relocation. Most informal settlers are \nsmall business owners and vendors and, therefore, considered vulnerable.  \n \n43.  Affected  persons  will  suffer  loss  of  (i)  agricultural  land,  crops,  and  trees;  (ii) \nbusiness/residential  structures;  (iii)  business/employment;  (iv)  income,  temporarily;  and  (v) \naccess to right of way to income-generating and livelihood sources.  Compensation for land and \nother assets will be paid at replacement/market value. The entitlement matrix recognizes all \ntypes of affected persons irrespective of ownership status. The matrix identifies the affected \npersons and losses, and defines compensation and entitlements. The resettlement plan aims to \nrestore  and  improve  the  economic  conditions  of  affected  persons,  particularly  vulnerable \ngroups,  through  a  variety  of  programs,  including  training  for  alternative  income.  The \nresettlement plan is guided by the ADB policy on involuntary resettlement as well as NHAI \npolicies and practices related to resettlement in ongoing ADB-funded projects. \n \n44.  Two resettlement sites have been identified in Rajkot and Thara in consultation with \naffected persons and local administration. In Rajkot, about 400 informal residential units will be \nresettled and provided basic amenities. In Thara, affected units are largely SBEs\u2014over 600 \nshops. They will be rehabilitated in the adjacent new market centers to be built by the Project.  \nEncroachers\u2014private owners who have extended their property on the right of way\u2014will be \nnotified  to  remove  their  structures  before  civil  works  commence  and  allowed  to  salvage \nmaterials from the demolished structures. However, vulnerable families in this category will be \nhelped on a case-by-case basis to improve their incomes, and compensated at replacement \ncost for their lost assets. Female-headed households will receive additional assistance for \nrelocation and/or income restoration. Ongoing poverty-reduction programs to rehabilitate child \nworkers will target the families of child laborers in SBEs.  \n \n45.  NHAI made copies of the draft resettlement plan available to affected persons and other \nstakeholders (e.g., block development officer and district commissioner\u2019s office) in the project \narea on 2 July 2002 in English and on 9 July 2002 in Gujarati. NHAI conducted two workshops \nin the project area to inform affected persons, and discuss and review their comments, which \nwere later incorporated in the revised resettlement plan. To avoid an influx of informal dwellers \nand fraudulent claims during implementation, NHAI will issue photo identification cards to all \nidentified owners of residential structures and shops (including employees) by March 2003. To \nfacilitate timely and effective implementation of the resettlement plan, NHAI has agreed to hire \nNGOs within 2 months after ADB Board approval of the Project. The estimated resettlement \ncost for the Project, including NGO services, will be Rs434 million.     \n \n ", "     13 \n46.  Various  stakeholders  consulted  during  the  project  preparation  include  (i)  heads  of \nhouseholds and/or businesses to be affected, (ii) affected persons in small groups, (iii) village \npanchayat (elected council at village level) members and sarpanch (village head), (iv) local \nvoluntary organizations and NGOs, (v) government agencies and departments; and (vi) women \nand  other  vulnerable  groups.  NHAI  will  depute  resettlement  officers  to  PIUs  to  supervise \nresettlement plan implementation work by NGOs, which will be selected by ESDU.  \n \n2.  Communicable Disease \n \n47.  HIV/AIDS are major development challenges. According to the National AIDS Control \nOrganization (NACO), India had close to 4 million people with HIV/AIDS in 2001, or less than \n1% of the adult population. However, HIV could infect at least 5% of the adult population (over \n37 million) by 2005 if no effective preventive measures are taken. The Government has shown \nincreasing commitment to HIV/AIDS control, and established a consortium-like collaboration \nwith  external  aid  agencies  to  provide  technical  and  financial  assistance  to  NACO  to  help \nimplement national HIV/AIDS policies.  \n \n48.  Gujarat's HIV/AIDS  incidence is sixth after that of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnakata, \nAndhra Pradesh, and Manipur. However, awareness of HIV/AIDS risks is low in Gujarat: only \n22.7% of rural women in Gujarat (against 72.5% among rural women nationally) are aware of \nHIV/AIDS risks.11 Clearly, awareness must be raised in the state.  \n \n49.  Truck drivers and construction laborers spread sexually transmitted diseases. HIV/AIDS \nis thus a possible negative impact of highway construction. Under the Project, an information \nand education campaign on the risks of HIV/AIDS will be conducted by a qualified NGO and \ntarget  construction  workers  at  campsites,  truck  drivers  at  truck  stops  (dhabas),  and  local \ncommunities along project highways, particularly rural women. The NGO will form local AIDS \nawareness groups and work closely with the relevant state agencies (particularly Gujarat State \nAIDS Control Society) and other existing networks dedicated to the prevention of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n3.  Road Safety \n \n50.  While an improved network would contribute to economic growth, more roads have also \nbrought in their wake more accidents: 5% annual increase for the last two decades, with 90,000 \nfatalities in 2001, 40% of which on NHs. About 50\u201360% of road traffic accidents involve heavy \ncommercial vehicles such as trucks and buses (Supplementary Appendix O).  \n \n51.  The Project has several road safety features, including provisions for overpass and \nunderpass at necessary locations, with particular attention to rural areas so that farm families \ncan  safely  move  their  herds.  Right-of-way  management,  alternative  markets  for  roadside \nvendors, and provision for bus and truck stops will address safety issues. Road improvement \nplans will include traffic management features such as signs, markings, streetlights, guard rails, \ncrosswalks, intersection layout and control, and provisions for different types of road users.  \n \n52.  At various stages of project design and implementation, road safety audits will identify \npotential road safety hazards and design defects, which can be redressed by improving design \nand  other  engineering  measures.  Road  safety  audit  will  be  combined  with  other  ongoing \n                                                           \n11 Awareness rates were highest in Kerala (96.4%), Goa (92.4%), and Andhra Pradesh (90.6%). See HIV/AIDS \nIndian Scenario\u2014Executive Summary, NACO, 2001.  \n ", "14 \nprojects (SMT and WTC).  Necessary costs will be financed out of loan proceeds of the SMT \nProject (see Supplementary Appendix P for outline TOR for road safety audit). \n \n4.  Poverty Impact \n \n53.   Poverty in Gujarat is significantly less severe than in the rest of India,12 with 14.1% of \nthe population below the poverty line. In 1993\u20132000, Gujarat achieved higher-than-average \neconomic growth of 7.2% per year, reducing poverty slightly faster than the national average.13 \nThe Project is expected to stimulate the state\u2019s economic growth, which will, in turn, reduce \npoverty (Supplementary Appendix Q). \n  \n54.  Improved  road  networks  will  increase  long-term  economic  opportunities  of  rural \ncommunities  by  (i)  enabling  villagers  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to  market-oriented \nagricultural surplus production; and (ii) helping local people, particularly the youth, move out of \ntheir communities to work at better-paid jobs in manufacturing or trading. The Project will \nprovide social benefits such as improved access to health, education, and social services. The \nProject  will  have  a  short-term  poverty  reduction  impact  as  the  rural  poor  are  hired  for \nconstruction, tree planting, and ensuing maintenance works. These opportunities will directly \nincrease earnings for the poor largely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment. \n \n55.  ADB\u2019s road projects are intended to assist the Government\u2019s overall efforts to improve \nthe entire road network consisting of national, state, and rural roads. The Government\u2019s road \ndevelopment policy is comprehensive with an aim to establish total connectivity with highest \npriority being accorded to the rural road segment. Thus ADB intends to provide lending not only \nto the national highway segment, but also to state roads from this year on, and also to rural \nroads from the next year on.  \n \n56.   The  proposed  506  km  highway  improvement  will  pass  through  approximately  170 \nvillages and 12 urban areas. Community assessment surveys on poverty impact carried out in \nJune 2002 revealed that project area residents generally perceive a positive linkage between \npoverty reduction and highway improvement. The survey also revealed that 20% of workers, \nmany of whom are agricultural laborers, were employed an average distance of 9 km from their \nvillages. Improved mobility would provide these workers with better-paying jobs outside the \nvillages, including in towns. Respondents also indicated that the Project would improve public \ntransport services and possibly make them cheaper and faster, which would directly benefit \nagricultural  laborers  working  outside  their  villages.  Nearly  half  the  respondents  felt  that \nincreased mobility would facilitate their access to educational and medical facilities.  \n  \nB.  Environmental Assessment \n \n57.  The  Project  is  classified  under  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) report was prepared by NHAI consultants and submitted to ADB in June \n2002. The IEE findings indicate that the Project will not have significant adverse environmental \nimpacts as it will upgrade existing highways and be executed primarily within existing rights of \nway. Cultural/heritage areas, protected areas, wetlands, and other environmentally sensitive \nareas will not be disturbed. A summary IEE was prepared (Appendix 10). The Project will \n                                                           \n12 26.1% being defined as below the poverty line. \n13 During these 6 years, poverty has gone down by 10.2% in Gujarat, while the national average has gone down by \n9.9%. During the same period, state gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.2%, faster than the national average \nof 6.4%.  \n ", "     15 \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects (1993) and \nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank (1998). \n \n58.  The environmental management and monitoring plan is sufficiently detailed to help NHAI \nand contractors mitigate the Project's potential environmental impacts. The plan summarized \nthe mitigation proposals and allocated responsibilities, including implementation, testing, and \nmonitoring during construction and operation.  \n    \nC.  Economic Assessment \n \n59.  Project economic evaluation is based on the comparison of scenarios with and without \nthe Project. Economic costs and benefits are compared in constant value. The economic costs \nwere computed using the financial costs. Project benefits were computed based on reduced \nvehicle operating costs due to improved road quality and capacity. Vehicle cost savings were \ncomputed using Highway Design and Maintenance Model \u2013 IV (HDM-IV) modified for India. The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated for the Project as a whole, as well as for \neach of the 11 roadway sections. The project EIRR is 22.0%, and section EIRRs were 14.8\u2013\n30.4%.  \n  \n60.  A sensitivity analysis of the EIRR has been undertaken for changes in the underlying \ncost-and-benefit parameters. Under the worst-case scenario of a simultaneous 15.0% increase \nin project costs and a 15.0% reduction in project benefits, the overall EIRR is estimated at \n18.8%. A possible 1-year delay in project implementation would bring down the EIRR to 20.9%  \n(Supplementary Appendix R). \n \nD.  Financial Analysis \n \n61.  A financial analysis of the Project was also undertaken to assess the projected toll \nrevenues generated from the traffic on project highways against the construction cost to widen \nthe road, and the annual costs for road operations and for routine and periodic maintenance \nover 30 years.  \n \n62.  Revenue projections are based on traffic forecasts, which use as a baseline the average \nof  recent  traffic  counts  and  an  extrapolation  of  past  counts.  Separate  growth  rates  were \ncomputed for each type of vehicle. Growth rates vary for passenger vehicles from 6% to 10%, \nand for medium-weight to heavy trucks, from 6% to 10%, with the proportion of traffic that \nshould and does pay tolls assumed at 75%. Total construction costs are expected to be incurred \nover 33 months, with construction completed and traffic tolls initiated by mid-2006.   \n \n63.  Based  on  the  above  assumptions,  the  project  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is \ncalculated at 8.2 %, above NHAI\u2019s 4.2% weighted average cost of capital in real terms.  \n \nE.  Potential Risks \n \n64.   A potential risk to the Project is the possible delay in implementation due to prolonged \nland acquisition. However, the need for land acquisition is limited except for the two bypasses, \ngrade separations, and realignments along the existing routes tolling 37 km or 7% of the total \nproject highways. Land required for service roads and drainage lines is mostly available within \nthe right of way. Land acquisition procedures introduced in 1997 by the amended National \nHighways Act will minimize the risk of implementation delay. The new procedures will enable \nNHAI to proceed with land acquisition expeditiously and predictably (Supplementary Appendix \n ", "16 \nS). NHAI assured the Mission that land necessary for commencement of construction activities \nwill be acquired by June 2003.  \n \n65.  Resettlement can also potentially delay implementation. To facilitate timely and effective \nimplementation and monitoring of the resettlement plan, NHAI will hire NGOs and depute \nresettlement officers in the PIUs. Mobilizing the implementing NGOs within 2 months of ADB \nBoard approval of the Project will minimize the risk of delayed compensation. The NGO staff will \ndedicate  their  time  to  processing  and  resolving  all  resettlement  problems.  Coordination \nmechanisms  will  be  established  at  the  district  level  to  resolve  any  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement issues that may arise.  \n \nV.    ASSURANCES \n \n66.  The Government and NHAI have given the following specific assurances, in addition to \nthe standard assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA.  General \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that sufficient budgetary allocations, counterpart \nfunds (including additional funds as required in case of revisions to resettlement \nplans) and staff are made available in a timely manner for the efficient and timely \nimplementation of the Project. \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure timely administrative clearances as required by \nNHAI for the speedy implementation of the Project. \n \nB.

NHAI \nwill also ensure that the Project is designed and constructed according to the \nEnvironmental  Management  and  Monitoring  Plan  agreed  upon  with  ADB  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure \nProjects. \n \n(ii)  NHAI will continue with the training program for environmental management for \nits staff and also the staff of the contractors under the Project.  \n \n(iii)  The Government and NHAI will implement the resettlement plan agreed upon \nwith ADB in consultation with State and district authorities concerned and with \npersons  affected  by  the  Project,  under  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  in \naccordance with the Governments applicable laws, ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary \nResettlement and ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, 1998, as amended from \ntime  to  time.  NHAI  will  ensure  that  any  person  who  may  be  affected  as  a \nconsequence of the Project is consulted and fairly compensated on replacement \nvalues such that his or her living standards are not adversely affected by the \nProject.  \n \n(iv)  To ensure timely monitoring of the resettlement plan implementation, NHAI will \nappoint an independent monitoring expert within three months of effective date in \naccordance with resettlement plan. \n \n ", "18 \n(v)  NHAI will ensure training to NGOs and resettlement officers to be conducted on \nmatters relating to resettlement by a local resettlement specialist and the EDSU \nofficials. \n \n(vi)  If the detailed design requires updating of the resettlement plan, NHAI will update \nthe resettlement plan and provide it to ADB for approval, prior to awarding civil \nworks contracts. \n \n(vii)  NHAI  will  carry  out  settlement  of  issues  relating  to  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  compensation  payments  for  the  Project  that  shall  include:  (i) \npayments  of  full  compensation/replacement  value  for  land/structure \n(residential/commercial) to legal titleholders prior to commencement of the civil \nworks;  (ii)  payments  of  full  replacement  value  of  structure \n(residential/commercial) to affected informal settlers/roadside squatters before \nthe commencement of civil works; (iii) payments of compensation for acquired \nland  to  titled  owners  prior  to  the  commencement  of  civil  works;  and  (iv)  \npayments  of  all  other  additional  benefits  and  provision  of  assistance  in \naccordance  with  resettlement  plan  provisions,  including  income  restoration \ngrants/skill training during the implementation of the Project.  \n \n(viii)  Public awareness and acceptance of the Project through participation of NGOs \nand communities shall be ensured by NHAI. To avoid influx of informal dwellers \nand fraudulent claims during implementation, NHAI will issue photo ID cards to \nall identified owners of residential structures and shops (including employees) to \nbe completed by March 2003. To facilitate timely and effective implementation \nand  monitoring  of  resettlement  plan,  NHAI  will  hire  NGOs  and  depute \nresettlement monitoring officers in the PIUs.  \n \n(ix)  NHAI will set up the grievance handling units at its headquarters (in the ESDU) \nand in each of the PIUs functioning to address environmental, resettlement and \nother social issues in a timely manner. Grievance redress committees will be \nformed in accordance with the resettlement plan in each district for resolution of \ndisputes concerning resettlement.  \n \n(x)  NHAI will ensure that civil works contracts incorporate provisions to the effect \nthat contractors (i) shall carry out HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs \nfor labor, and (ii) shall not use children as labor. The civil works contracts shall \nalso provide for termination of the contract by NHAI in case of breach of any of \nthe stated provisions by the contractors. \n \n(xi)  NHAI will recruit qualified NGOs to carry out education campaign on the risks of \nHIV/AIDS targeted at construction workers, truck drivers and women. The NGOs \nshall work closely with the relevant State agencies (particularly the State AIDS \nControl  Society)  and  other  existing  networks  dedicated  to  the  prevention  of \nHIV/AIDS. \n \nG.   BOT Project  \n \n(i)  The Government and NHAI will ensure that the project sponsor for the BOT \nsection of the Project is selected in a transparent manner through competitive \nbidding procedures under intimation to ADB. \n ", "     19 \n(ii)  NHAI will ensure that the bidding process and award of contract to the successful \nbidder are carried out in a timely manner so that the related BOT section is \ncompleted, for operationalization along with the rest of the Project Highway.  \n \n(iii)  NHAI will ensure that the bidding process for the BOT section of the Project \nHighway is reported to ADB in a timely manner so that the Government and the \nADB can take necessary actions in a prompt manner in case that the BOT \nproject fails to be materialized.   \n \n(iv)  The financial advisor for BOT packaging shall be engaged in a timely manner by \nnot later than 28 February 2003.  \n \n67.

Faced with chronic capacity shortage of national highways, the Government launched a \nmassive program to rehabilitate and upgrade key arteries of National Highway Development \nProgram  (NHDP).  Its  key  components  are  (i)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  Golden \nQuadrilateral, approximately 6,000 kilometers (km) of highway network, slated to be completed \nby the end of 2003; and (ii) the rehabilitation and upgrading of the North-South (N-S; 4,000 km) \nand East-West (E-W; 3,300 km) corridors, which are to be completed by the end of 2007. NHDP \nis expected to cost $13 billion for 10 years (1998-2007). \n \n2.  During the 1998 Country Programming Mission, the Government requested the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  a  series  of  loans  for  the  Golden  Quadrilateral.  ADB \nextended two loans, for the Surat-Manor Tollway Project (2000) and the Western Transport \nCorridor  Project  (2001).  During  the  2000  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government \nrequested extension of assistance to develop the E-W and N-S corridors. The proposed loan is \nADB's third to NHDP and the first to the E-W and N-S corridors.   \n \n3.  Project preparatory technical assistance for the above project was approved in October \n2001, and the consultant team was fielded to India in May 2002 to help National Highways \nAuthority of India (NHAI) consultants conduct the feasibility study, focusing on ensuring the \nNHAI  consultants'  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  In  May-June  2002,  the  ADB  Fact-\nFinding Mission reviewed the technical, institutional, economical, financial, environmental, and \nsocial viability of the Project.  The Appraisal Mission was sent to India in August-September \n2002 to finalize project evaluation. \n \n4.  In assisting NHDP, ADB has adopted a programmatic approach to achieve its medium- \nto long-term goals in a progressive and evolutionary manner. The medium- to long-term goals \nset out in the Report and Recommendation of the President on the Western Transport Corridor \nProject are (i) transform NHAI into a managerially and financially autonomous body, (ii) enhance \nfinancial management and planning capability, (iii) strengthen institutional capacity for project \nimplementation and highway operations and management (O&M), (iv) institute a transparent \ncorporate governance, and (v) advance public-private partnerships.  \n \n5.  A key element of this approach is a specific milestone that would trigger the next project \n(a  trigger  point).1  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  reviewed  recent  private  sector  participation  in \ndevelopment and O&M, a trigger point agreed on during the 2002 pre-country programming \nmission. The Mission found that substantial progress had been made in quantity and quality. \nNHAI  introduced  six  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  projects,  eight  annuity-based  concession \nprojects, and one special-purpose vehicle during the last 3 years, which accounted for 14% of \nthe Golden Quatrilateral's length. Two are large-scale BOT projects: Delhi-Gurgaon (28 km, six \nand or eight lanes, $117 million); and Jaipur-Kishangarh (98 km, four lanes, $137 million). This \ndevelopment is major progress, since NHAI has experienced difficulties in attracting the private \nsector to invest in large-scale BOT projects. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

India has an extensive and diverse transport system of about 3.4 million kilometers (km) \nof road; 63,028 km of rail; 12 major and 139,182 minor and or intermediate ports; 4 major \ninternational airports; 86 domestic airports; and about 14,500 km of navigable inland waterway. \nThe ratio of road to rail transport has been continuously shifting as demand for transport \nservices changes. Road transport now accounts for over 60% of freight movement and 80% of \npassenger traffic, with rail transport accounting for much of the remainder. A profile of transport \nin India is in Supplementary Appendix V. \n \nA.  Government Sector Strategy \n \n2.  Faced with chronic capacity shortage on major arterial links, the Government decided to \nundertake  the  radical  National  Highways  Development  Program  (NHDP)  to  upgrade  key \nnational highway (NH) corridors, especially the Golden Quadrilateral, approximately 6,000 km of \nhighway  network  connecting  four  major  metropolitan  areas  (Delhi,  Mumbai,  Chennai,  and \nKolkata) and slated to be completed by the end of 2003. NHDP will also upgrade the North-\nSouth (4,000 km) and East-West (3,300 km) corridors, to be completed by the end of 2007.1 All \nthese corridors are to be upgraded to a minimum four-lane standard. NHDP also includes \nupgrading  access  to  major  ports  under  the  Port  Connectivity  Project.  Once  NHDP  is \nimplemented,  the  focus  will  shift  to  construction  of  a  national  expressway  network  and \nrehabilitation of parts of the NH network not included in NHDP. \n \n3.  Construction costs for NHDP are estimated at $13 billion. To finance the program, NHAI \nintends to raise $4.4 billion through a levy on petrol and diesel, $2.7 billion through financial \nmarkets, $1.4 billion through private sector participation in the Project, and the remaining $4.4 \nbillion through external assistance. The Government\u2019s strategies include revamping the road \nfund for development, issuing domestic bonds to tap India\u2019s capital markets, engaging the \nprivate sector to develop the road network, and using international and bilateral assistance. \n \nB.  Sector Profile \n \n  1.   Transport Planning and Coordination \n \n4.  Transport planning, coordination, and policy setting at the central government level are \nhandled by several line ministries, with overall coordination by the Planning Commission. The \nMinistry of Surface Transport, was reorganized in November 2000 into the Ministry of Road \nTransport and Highways (MORTH) and Ministry of Shipping (MOS). MORTH\u2019s duties are to \ndevelop and maintain NHs, and formulate road transport policies. MORTH coordinates state \nroads and issues guidelines on highway planning, design, and construction. MOS is responsible \nfor major ports, inland water transport, and shipping. All railway planning and operations are \nunder the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry of Rural Development is responsible for policy \ndevelopment, monitoring, and coordination of rural roads being funded by the Central Road \nFund (CRF). Airports and civil aviation are the responsibility of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. \n \n5.  The responsibility for developing and maintaining the NH system rests with the central \nGovernment, while state and district roads are the responsibility of the state governments. To \nseparate its planning and operational functions, the Government established NHAI in 1988 to \ndevelop and maintain NHs. NHAI\u2019s responsibilities include the Golden Quadrilateral, North-\n                                                 \n1 The original target of 2009 was recently revised to 2007. ", "        Appendix 3           23  \n        \nSouth and East-West corridors, and several links to major ports and industrial centers. NHAI \ncovers one fourth of the NH network length, and MORTH is responsible for the rest. \n \n  2.  Road Network and Traffic \n \n6.  The road network is divided into (i) NHs, (ii) state highways and major district roads, and \n(iii) other district roads and rural roads (Supplementary Appendix T). The national and state \nhighways facilitate mobility, while the district and rural roads provide much-needed means to \nmeet social needs and to transport agricultural produce to markets. The road network grew by \n7.5 times, from 400,000 km in 1951 to 3.4 million km in 2001 (including 230,000 km of urban \nroads). Road density is now 1 km per square km, which is higher than in other developing \ncountries, but the length, quality, and capacity of the road network are grossly inadequate to \nmeet present and future demand for freight transport and passenger traffic. \n \n7.  The NH network of 58,122 km carries about 40% of total road traffic. However, 39% of \nthis network is still single lane, 58% two lane, and only 3% four lane. \n \n8.  From 1990 to 2000, annual passenger road transport grew at 7.8%, and freight transport \nby 7.6%, which was higher than the growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) (6%). By \n2001, passenger traffic was expected to reach about 3,000 billion passenger-km, and freight \ntraffic, 800 billion ton-km. \n \n3.  Vehicle Fleet and Road Transport Industries \n \n9.  India  had  300,000  vehicles  in  1950/51,  and  around  50  million  in  1999/00.  Buses \naccounted  for  1%;  trucks,  5%;  cars  and  jeeps,  13%;  and  motorcycles  and  scooters  (two-\nwheelers), 71%. The rest were mostly auto-rickshaws (three-wheelers) and agricultural tractors. \nThe  number  of  automobiles  has  been  growing  at  approximately  9%  a  year,  and  heavy \ncommercial vehicles, at 7.5% over the last 9 years. \n \n10.  India\u2019s automobile manufacturing industry has been regulated since independence. In \n1947, the Government declared that only indigenous firms operating according to an approved \nplan could manufacture motor vehicles. A vehicle manufacturing industry was established using \ndomestic capital and little foreign technology. Deregulation started with two-wheelers in the mid-\n1980s, then passenger cars and commercial vehicles in the 1990s to encourage production of \nmore fuel-efficient, safer, and better-quality vehicles at reasonable prices. In 1999/2000, 4.8 \nmillion motor vehicles were manufactured in India, 156% over the 1992/93 level, due to the \nunprecedented increase in manufacturing of two- and three-wheeler vehicles from 1.5 million to \n3.9 million. \n \n  4.  Road Transport Services \n \n11.  The  private  sector  almost  wholly  operates  road  freight.  The  national  freight  fleet \nincreased from 963,000 in 1985/86 to 2.6 million in 1999/2000. Light commercial vehicles \nincreased much faster than the heavy commercial vehicles. In this multilevel industry, shippers \nusually contact transport companies that can assume the legal liabilities associated with cargo \nhaulage. Since these transport companies have limited fleets, most use trucks provided by \ncargo brokers. After receiving orders from shippers, transport companies contact cargo brokers \nbased in the regions from where the cargo originates. These brokers (usually individuals) will \nthen contact truck owners (again, often individuals) or truck drivers, who often wait for cargo at \ntruck parking lots or along highways. Truck parking lots are usually found in city outskirts, and ", "24  Appendix 3     \nmost are informal and often surrounded by small buildings housing cargo brokers. The trucking \nindustry performs poorly because of (i) the high proportion of overage vehicles; (ii) lack of \nbackhaul cargo; and (iii) lack of loading and unloading facilities, preventing transshipment from \nlarger to smaller trucks, which is often needed in the peripheries of major cities that have truck \nbans. \n \n12.  The upgraded NH system is designed for an operating speed of 100 km per hour. \nHowever, trucks usually run at 40\u201350 km, particularly when carrying heavy-duty cargo such as \ncontainers. Unless trucking services are modernized, the full benefits of the upgraded highway \nnetwork will not be realized. A policy is needed to modernize trucking services, particularly for \nintermodal operation. In 2002, MORTH asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider \nhelping develop a trucking policy.  \n \n13.  The public and private sectors provide passenger services through road transport. Over \nthe years, the share of the public sector in the total bus fleet has declined. In 1980/81, the public \nsector held 45% of the total number of buses, but only 21% in 1999/2000. \n \n  5.  Revenues/Expenditures and Road Fund \n \n14.  The central Government provides funds from yearly budgetary allocations to develop \nand maintain NHs, while state governments fund state highways and district and rural roads. \nTransport investments have accounted for about 13% of total public sector spending under the \nGovernment\u2019s 5-year plans.  \n \nTable A3: Five-Year Plan Expenditure in the Transport Sector \n(Rs billion)  \n  VI Plan  VII Plan  VIII Plan  IX Plan \nSubsector  (1980-85)  (1985-90)  (1992-97)  (1997-2002) \nRailways  65.85  165.49  321.39  464.05 \nRoads  38.87  63.35  161.33  475.10 \nRoad Transport  12.76  21.51  36.34  59.33 \nPorts  7.25  15.13  24.91  53.31 \nShipping  4.68  7.20  47.26  29.67 \nInland Water Transport  0.63  1.88  1.54  2.80 \nCivil Aviation  9.57  19.48  75.04  69.58 \nOther Transport  -  0.72  2.44  18.51 \nTotal Transport  139.61  294.76  670.25  1,172.35 \nTotal Public Transport  1,092.91  2,187.29  5,332.52  n.a. \nTotal Transport as age to Pubic Sector   12.8    12.6  n.a. \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of India. n.a.: not available. \n \n15.  Road expenditure increased by 11 times from Rs39 billion in the Sixth Five-Year Plan to \nRs475 billion in the Ninth Five-Year Plan. The transport budget allocation increased by about 7 \ntimes in the same period. The road sector\u2019s share of total transport investment also increased \nfrom about 28% in the Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-85) to about 40% in the Ninth Five Year Plan \n(1997-2002), reflecting government commitment to improve highway infrastructure to meet the \ndemands of the growing economy and help reduce poverty. \n \n16.  A  very  limited  central  road  fund  has  existed  for  years.  The  central  Government \nrevamped it through excise duties (cess) of Re1 per liter of petrol (1998) and diesel (1999, \nthrough the Central Road Fund Ordinance). These cess are expected to raise Rs60 billion ($1.2 \nbillion) per annum. To institutionalize the revamped CRF, Parliament passed the Central Road \nFund Act in November 2000. According to its allocation formula, and assuming Rs10 billion is ", "        Appendix 3           25  \n        \nraised from petrol and Rs50 billion from diesel, approximately Rs25 billion will be allocated for \nrural roads, Rs20 billion for NHs, Rs11 billion for state highways and major district roads, and \nRs45 billion for railway crossings and other purposes. Unlike a typical road fund, which is \nprimarily  used  for  maintenance,  CRF  will  be  used  mainly  to  develop  the  road  network \n(Supplementary Appendix U).  \n \n  6.   Maintenance \n \n17.  NH network maintenance has been neglected due to inadequate fund allocation. The \nNinth Five Year Plan allocated more than twice the amount in the previous 5-year plan for NH \nmaintenance, but in FY 2000, the maintenance shortfall, which was 48.3% in 1993/94, remained \nat practically the same level (50%) in FY 2002. However, MORTH partly solved this problem \nthrough riding-quality improvements for the maintenance programs. \n \n18.  NHAI, which is required to maintain NHs entrusted to it, currently does so through the \nPublic Works Departments (PWDs) or contracts it out to a private contractor (occasionally NHAI \ndoes it by itself). The maintenance cost has been covered by budgetary support from the \nCentral Government. Faced with rapid expansion in the road network entrusted to it, NHAI has \ndecided to explore the possibility of introducing an asset management concept to maintain and \nmanage its road network more systematically. It commissioned a study under World Bank \nfunding on the corridor management units (CMUs). A key element of the CMU concept is to \noperate and maintain the road network through contracting out to private contractors. A CMU is \nalso responsible for ensuring the integrity of the right of way by maintaining fences and markers, \ncontrolling overloading of trucks, taking necessary accident prevention measures, removing \nobstacles on roads, controlling emission, and keeping noises within acceptable limits. With the \nrecent completion of the study, two pilot CMUs will be established under the Third National \nHighway Project of the World Bank (see Supplementary Appendix W for the CMU concept). \n \n19.  The current O&M policy of NHAI is to contract them out as much as possible to the \nprivate sector. Under the Surat-Manor and Western Transport projects, advisory services will be \nprovided for the development of performance based O&M agreements to be carried out by the \nprivate sector. \n \n7.  Environmental Issues \n \n20.  Since 1991, the Government has gradually intensified its control over gas emission from \nvehicles. First-stage control was introduced for petrol-powered vehicles in 1991 and for diesel-\npowered vehicles in 1992. The Bharat stage-1 emission standards, which are akin to Euro-1 \nstandards, have become effective throughout the country since 2000. The Government plans to \nintroduce tougher standards, corresponding to Euro-2 requirements for passenger cars and \ncommercial vehicles. Bharat stage-2 standards, which are close to Euro-2 standards, have been \nin force in the National Capital Region and are intended to be enforced shortly throughout the \ncountry. Leaded fuel has been gradually phased out from metropolitan cities since 1998 with the \nintroduction of unleaded fuel. Now petrol fuel is fully unleaded all over the country. Benzene in \npetrol has also been reduced to 3% all over the country and to 1% in Delhi. Since December \n1998, commercial vehicles over 15 years old have been banned from Delhi\u2019s center. \n \n21.  ADB has been working with the Government to solve road sector-related environmental \nproblems  by  preventing  environmental  degradation  during  construction  and  operation  of ", "26  Appendix 3     \nhighways, for example, and controlling urban traffic pollution. An ADB technical assistance2 on \nenvironmental management prepared highway project guidelines. They are now used on all \nhighway improvement and reconstruction projects in India. ADB\u2019s Second Road Project3 studied \nmeasures to control traffic pollution in urban areas. The Central Pollution Control Board then \nupdated its mass emission regulations and enforced them more stringently.  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1993.

", "    Appendix 4 27\n   \nDESIGN STRUCTURE OF A BUILD-OPERATE-TRANSFER COMPONENT  \n \n1.  This  appendix  discusses  the  possible  investment  package  of  the  proposed  build-\noperate-transfer  (BOT)  component.  The  areas  of  concern  are  preparation,  packaging,  and \npromotion of the BOT project; and the structure of the concession agreement. Two potential \nBOT projects have been identified and are presented below. Problems in project preparation, \npackaging, and promotion, and how the project will address them, are discussed. The analysis \nwhich was prepared by PPTA consultant1 will be further modified or verified at a later stage \nwhen more detailed traffic counts are gathered and tolling strategies are developed. \n  \nA.  Identification of Sections to be developed under BOT  \n \n2.  The portion of the project road to be undertaken as a BOT project was selected after \nindividual road sections were examined, and various combinations of these sections tested. The \nevaluation was made using a generally accepted accounting practices model, which developed \na financing structure to meet project cash-flow requirements and provide an optimum score \nbased on debt service coverage ratio and internal rate of return. For all of the links considered, \nthe model assumed a 60:40 debt-to-equity ratio, with 13% interest on the loans. The best loan \nstructure was found to be 13 years with a 5-year grace period.  \n \n3.  Two road sections were found to be feasible for BOT financing. One includes two \nsections connecting Mobri and Samakhali; both will be widened to four lanes. The second road \nsection includes three road sections and a bypass connecting Jetpur and Bamanbore; two are \nalready four-lane roads but not yet tolled. The section from Jetpur to Gondal will be widened to \nfour lanes, and a bypass constructed around Rajkot. The various sections are described in \nTable A4.1. Their locations are in Figure 1. \n \nTable A4.1 Description of Various Sections \n \nSection  Location  Length  Existing Condition Capital Expenditure \n(Rs10 million) \nA  Jetput-Gondal  26.3    2-lane  109.3 \nB  Gondal-Rajkot  32.0    4-lane   \nC  Rajkot Bypass  10.0    None  101.1 \nD  Rajkot-Bamanbore  31.0    4-lane   \nE  Morbi-Maliya  25.4    2-lane  85.9 \nF  Maliya-Samakhali  40.0    2-lane  173.9 \n \n4.  The resulting values for the debt service coverage ratio and internal rates of return for \nvarious combinations of these sections are shown in Table A4.2. The widening of the Mobri-\nSamakhali link provides a good return. The northern section provides a higher return than the \nsouthern section, but the combination would be a larger project more attractive to contractors \nand allowing for economies of scale in management. This link is expected to serve a growing \nnumber of multi-axle vehicles, and the revenues are likely to be enhanced with a toll structure \nbased on truck size. Diversion from this road, which has few access roads, is also not likely. \n \n                                                 \n1 Individual consultant engaged under the PPTA arrangement, John Arnold. \n   \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable A4.2: Internal Rates of Return \n \nProject Indicator  A  C  A+C  A-B-C  A-B-C-D E  F  E-F \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio                     \n Minimum  0.62  0.01  0.38  0.39  -0.14  0.31  1.19  0.88 \n Average   2.34  0.64  1.59  2.59  2.88  2.22  2.92  2.71 \nInternal Rates Of Return                 \n Project (post-tax, all equity)  17.6%  5.3%  13.1%  18.8%  20.9%  17.8%  20.3%  19.3% \n Equity (post-tax with debt)  18.7%  <0  11.8%  20.4%  23.9%  18.8%  23.4%  21.7% \nWeighted Scores  15  3  9  16  16  15  17  16 \nNote: Assume debt-to-equity of 60:40, debt with tenor of 13 years starting after disbursement, and a 5-year grace \nperiod. \n \n   \n ", "    Appendix 4 29\n   \n5.  The only section that is clearly not viable as a stand-alone is the Rajkot Bypass, where \nthe return on equity is negative. The section from Jetput to Gondal has a reasonable return but \nnot when combined with the bypass. The two sections are separated by 32 kilometers (km), and \nadding  the  intervening  section  to  the  BOT  project  will  improve  returns,  operation  and \nmanagement, and tolling. The extension of the northern section to Bamanbore is an additional \nsweetener to financial performance, and adds more flexibility to tolling, and economies to \nadministration  and  use  of  equipment.  This  project  has  the  advantage  that  the  revenues \ngenerated from the existing four-lane sections can be used to offset some of the construction \ncosts\u2014a factor that has not been included in the calculations. Traffic levels on the existing four-\nlane roads are based on older traffic counts, which are well below earlier tariff counts and traffic \nlevels on adjoining sections. Traffic levels are likely higher than reported, which would contribute \nto the funds available during construction as well as overall. Finally, the estimated costs for the \nbypass were based on certain design requirements. This cost could be substantially reduced \nand returns improved.  \n \n6.  The concept of sweetening marginal BOT projects with toll revenues from existing road \nsections rather than grants should be of increasing importance as the network develops. Of the \ntwo possible packages (A-B-C and A-B-C-D), package A-B-C-D was recommended.  \n \n7.  This BOT project is expected to be offered to the market without a grant component and \npossibly a negative grant. During project preparation, a survey will determine market appetite for \nthe project. A financial advisor to be engaged by NHAI will interact with potential investors and \nlenders during preparation of the concession agreement. If, despite these efforts, interest in the \nproject is still insufficient, then the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) may either \nintroduce a grant component, removing the traffic risk by converting BOT to an annuity structure \n(requiring little change in contract documents), or using a traditional construction contract to be \nsupported by cess2 funds.  \n \nB.  BOT Project Design Issues   \n \n1.  Preparation \n \n8.  The extent of project preparation is important to increase investor confidence. Three \nareas of preparation require review: traffic projections, project design, and permits.  \n \n9.  The major source of risk for BOT projects is traffic. Bidders undertake their own traffic \nsurveys, which, however, adds to the cost and time to prepare the bid. The scope of the survey \nwill also be limited by time to verifying the results of earlier surveys.3 NHAI must provide a \ncomprehensive set of traffic counts along the route so that bidders can verify these results \nrather than develop new numbers. The location and format of these counts should be carefully \ndesigned. In some cases, the results should be supported with driver interviews. Given the \nawareness among investors of the weakness of past traffic counts, NHAI must set a high \nstandard for its own. The BOT project solves this problem by resurveying the traffic based on a \nreview of traffic flows and closely supervising the enumerators. \n \n10.  The current level of design performed by NHAI consultants varies. For some projects, a \ndetailed project design including a substantial percentage of the final drawings is prepared while \n                                                 \n2 Excise duty levied on fuel. \n3 It is not possible to obtain information on seasonal variations or to obtain sufficient coverage to predict traffic along \nthe entire routes. \n   \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nothers have a preliminary design. While the contracts accommodate this variation, NHAI is \nultimately  responsible  for  these  roads  and  they  should  be  consistent  with  the  rest  of  the \nnetwork. The NHAI consultants should be required to prepare a detailed design report. This not \nonly provides comfort to the contractors and their lenders but also reduces the possibility of \nsignificant variations which could affect the cost of the project.  It also ensures that the bidders \nwill be bidding against consistent expectations of what their obligations are.  The planning for \nthe current BOT project is well along towards the development of the detailed design and no \nproblem is expected. \n \n11.  Where BOT projects involve short stretches, natural choke points or isolated links, there \nis little problem of designing the tollbooths. However, for road stretches in which there are many \naccess  roads  and  considerable  movement  of  traffic  on  and  off  the  tolled  road,  then  the \nplacement of tollbooths become a strategic consideration. In an open-toll situation, the tolling is \ndone  through  a  combination  of  barrier  and  tollbooths.  The  location  and  number  of  these \ndetermine both the cost of collection and the portion of the traffic that actually pays for the use \nof the road.  NHAI has yet to develop a comprehensive tolling strategy for the network and the \nprivate  sector  has  limited  experience.  The  design  of  tolling  requires  traffic  information  on \nalternative sites, an economic comparison of the costs and revenues for collection, and the \neffect of the amount charged at each collection point on diversion of traffic. The design of the \nconcession should include identification of tolling sites. While the concessionaire can modify the \nplan, this basic plan would provide a common starting point for bid preparation.  Presumably this \nplan would be based on more detailed traffic data than the bidder could collect during the bid \nprocess. This information is also necessary for determine the financial viability of a BOT project. \nMore detailed analysis will be carried out later to determine what percentage of traffic will pays \ntolls.   \n \n12.  The primary source of risk to the contractors at the design stage is securing the right of \nway and necessary permits to develop the roadway. This is a universal problem. So far, India \nhas, however, been free of high-profile controversy where a major road is delayed or cancelled \nbecause  of  these  types  of  problems,  but  past  successes  are  not  solutions.  The  contract \nprovides some comfort to the proponent in this regard, but the private sector continues to regard \nthis as a significant risk. The NHAI should gradually increase the amount of preparation prior to \nawarding the bid. The current BOT project has a limited number of permitting issues since the \nright of way has been secured or to be secured by NHAI. \n \nb.   Packaging  \n \n13.  The  BOT  project  should  offer  (i)  a  road  investment  possible  additional  investment \nopportunities to capture the benefits from the higher than expected traffic growth, (ii) a high \nprobability of achieving an acceptable rate of return for the private sector, and (iii) a level of \ninvestment  acceptable  to  contractors  and  lenders.  The  BOT  project  should  generate  a \nsignificant level of competition for the contracts to develop roads at reasonable cost and of \nacceptable quality. The two most important considerations in meeting these objectives are the \nsize of the package and the cash flow to be generated from tolls. \n \n14.  Project  size  is  critical  as  it  determines  the  extent  of  competition.  Whereas  smaller \ncontracts only attract small contractors, larger projects attract a mix of large contractors and \nconsortium  of  smaller  contractors.  Thus,  large  contracts  offer  potentially  more  effective \ncompetitive bidding where permitted by the prequalification process. Limits on project size are \ndetermined primarily by cost rather than road length or nature of construction. In recent years, \nthe contracting industry has demonstrated an ability to construct good roads in a variety of \n   \n ", "    Appendix 4 31\n   \nsituations.  Like  most  construction  industries,  however,  the  contracting  industry  has  limited \naccess to capital. The largest Indian contractor has a turnover of less than Rs2,000 billion. \nBelow that, the average for larger firms is probably no more than Rs300 billion, suggesting that \nthe amount of equity that could be committed to a 2-year construction effort would not exceed \nRs600 billion and, given current leverage, maximum project size would be Rs1.5 billion. NHAI \nhas been offering projects up to Rs6 billion. Smaller contractors take on these larger projects by \nforming  consortia,  or  involving  foreign  contractors,  which  is  an  increasingly  important \nmechanism.  As  NHAI\u2019s  experience  and  reputation  with  larger  projects  increases,  foreign \ncontractors will become more interested in them and competition will thus increase. \n \n15.  Physically  large  projects  offer  potential  economies  of  scale  in  construction  and \nmaintenance, derived from spreading administrative and planning costs over a greater length of \nroad and providing a sufficient volume of work over time to achieve a high level of equipment \nuse. These advantages extend to road maintenance where the level of activity per km is low \nand large roads allow use of efficient equipment and permanent labor. These advantages \ndepend not only on road length but also continuity. Noncontiguous sections create operation \nand maintenance problems.  \n \n16.  Significant economies of scale may also be associated with revenue collection. The \nlarger the project, the greater the options for toll plaza location. Since these roads have an \nopen-toll system, toll plaza placement has a major impact on toll-paying traffic. The more toll \nplazas, the higher the proportion of toll-paying traffic, but also the higher the operating costs and \nthe lower the average travel speed. The appropriate distance between toll plazas cannot be \ndetermined by formula but only by careful analysis of present and planned roads that link with \nthe project road, and a study of traffic-flow patterns. The longer the stretch of road, the greater \nthe flexibility in selecting locations and the fewer toll plazas required per km. To the extent that \nthe contractor can encourage traffic in one section through the pricing or quality of the adjoining \nsection, a larger project will allow an increase in traffic volume. \n \n17.  Lenders are generally neutral about project size. For larger projects, they can form \nconsortia  or  employ  other  mechanisms  to  share  the  risk.  Lenders\u2019  major  concern  is  the \nexpected level and robustness of potential project returns. Loans to construction contractors are \nseen  as  high  risk.  The  experience  with  nonrecourse  lending  to  private  builders  of  public \ninfrastructure is limited, having only started in 1999. Investor involvement in these projects has \nbeen limited since the markets for investments are limited. Interest is growing among the large \ninvestment companies and industrial companies that perceive the potential for significant gains \nin road projects with a strong upside on traffic growth. The infrastructure funds that appeared in \nthe 1990s have lowered investors\u2019 expectations of potential returns but have also become a less \npotent force in the market as their focus was on short-term involvement (less than 10 years). \nPotential investors interested in long-term, secure investments such as pension funds, provident \nfunds, and insurance companies have remained on the sidelines. These potential investors are \nseen as sources of debt rather than investment, which may make sense given the limited \ncontract periods. \n \n18.  A  key  consideration  in  project  deign  is  cash  flow.  Projects  that  require  a  long \nconstruction period or have low initial traffic levels will have an extended period of negative cash \nflow, which is difficult for the private sector, especially with its higher cost of capital. Grants have \nbeen used to offset the negative cash flow. The amount of grant is determined through bidding. \nAn upfront payment is inherently more costly because of the high discount rates applied by the \nbidders to determine grant size, and riskier for NHAI. The grants have been relatively large\u2014\n30% of estimated project cost. Assuming that these estimates are high by 20\u201330%, the grant \n   \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \nprovides 40% of project cost, reducing the equity and lending requirements of the proponents. \nThe grant also provides a cash input to the proponent during construction. A substantial upfront \npayment effectively transfers most of the financing risk to NHAI.  \n \n19.  A more logical approach would be to spread the grant over time, thus taking advantage \nof the discount rate differential and tying the grant to contractor performance.4 This approach \nwould also require the contractor to commit its own equity to the project. The amount of grant \nwould still be determined through competitive bidding, but the payments would be according to \na prearranged schedule.  \n \n20.  An alternative method to reduce the cost and risk to the contractor during construction is \nto combine greenfield and brownfield toll road sections, thus providing the contractor with cash-\ngenerating activity during the initial years of the project and reassuring lenders since a stream of \nrevenue will be available to cover the initial debt service. The proposed BOT projects have \ncombined contiguous sections of roads to ensure adequate size of investment\u2014Rs2-2.5 billion. \nThe amount of construction\u201436-65 km\u2014is moderate. Project size was limited by the lack of \ncontiguous sections offering an adequate return. One of the two proposed projects includes a \nmix of greenfield and brownfield projects. \n \n      c.  Promotion  \n \n21.  Project success requires strong competition among bidders, which can be encouraged \nby promoting the project through road shows among foreign contractors and lenders, especially \nfor large projects requiring substantial equity. Promotion is less necessary for small projects \ninvolving local contractors and lenders.  \n \n22.  Promotion  may  be  useful  to  attract  new  contractors  where  the  prequalification \nrequirements or the terms of the contract have been changed, and to build confidence among \npotential  investors  and  contractors.  Local  lenders  and  investors  are  uncertain  about  the \npotential  for  successful  road  concessions.  Promotion  can  be  used  to  inform  the  financial \ncommunity  of  successful  undertakings  and  to  dispel  concerns  about  unsuccessful  ones. \nPromotion can be especially useful when complemented by improved project design, as is the \ncase with the proposed BOT project, which introduces innovations in combining greenfield and \nbrownfield components and complementary changes in project design. \n \n23.  For this project, promotion targets local contractors as well as the financial community, \nnot through a road show but rather through workshops presenting the project format and a \ndiscussion of concerns of this community about past and present BOT projects. \n \nd.  Selection Criteria \n \n24.  Concessionaires  who  claims  the  lowest  amount  of  grant  from  NHAI  (including  the \nnegative grant) will be selected. \n   \n                                                 \n4  Assuming that the paid-in capital would be phased during construction, the NHAI grant might still be used to \nprovide project equity.  \n   \n ", "Appendix 5          33\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\n($ million)\nForeign  Local \nItem Exchange Currency Total\nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in  Sector identified as a national priority in country \ncountry poverty analysis?   No  poverty partnership agreement?  No \nContribution of the highway/road sector to reduce poverty in India: \n \nThe highway and road sector development significantly but indirectly reduces poverty by stimulating \neconomic growth, in turn raising incomes and improving the quality of life.   \n \nThe Project will pass through agricultural areas, increasing economic opportunities by (i) enabling \nvillagers to shift from subsistence farming to market-oriented agricultural surplus production; and (ii) \nhelping local people, particularly rural youth, move out of the village to work at better-paid jobs in \nmanufacturing or trading. The Project will also provide social benefits such as (i) improved access to \nhealth, education, and social services; and (ii) increased access to learning opportunities, including \ninformation technologies, thus reducing the project areas\u2019 isolation from cultural and commercial \ncenters.  Road improvement will also have short-term impact on poverty reduction as the rural poor are \nhired for construction, tree planting, and ensuing maintenance works. These opportunities will directly \nincrease earnings of the poor who are largely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment.  \n \nThe Project will help the Government improve national, state, and rural roads. Its road development \npolicy is comprehensive and aims to connect the entire country, with the highest priority accorded to \nrural roads. Asian Development Bank will extend assistance not only to develop national highways but \nalso state roads beginning this year and rural roads next year.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis       \nProposed Classification: Thematic \nEconomic growth and private sector development  \nAnalysis:  \nPoverty in Gujarat is significantly less severe than in the rest of India,1 with 14.1% of the population \nbelow the poverty line. In 1993\u20132000, Gujarat achieved higher-than-average economic growth of 7.2% \nper year, reducing poverty slightly faster than the national average.2 The Project is expected to \nstimulate the state\u2019s economic growth, which will, in turn, reduce poverty (Supplementary Appendix Q).  \nThe proposed 506-kilometer (km) highway improvement will pass through approximately 170 villages \nand 12 urban areas. Community assessment surveys on poverty impact carried out in June 2002 \nrevealed that project area residents generally perceive a positive linkage between poverty reduction \nand highway improvement.  The survey also revealed that 20% of workers, many of whom are \nagricultural laborers, were employed an average distance of 9 km from their villages. Improved mobility \nwould provide these workers with better-paying jobs outside the villages, including in towns. \nRespondents also indicated that the Project would improve public transport services and possibly make \nthem cheaper and faster, which would directly benefit agricultural laborers working outside their \nvillages. Nearly half the respondents felt that increased mobility would facilitate their access to \neducational and medical facilities.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nParticipation strategy:  NHAI continues to strengthen communication with stakeholders and has \nrecently established the Advisory Council, representing various groups, including consumers and road \nusers. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 26.1% is defined as below the poverty line. \n2 During these 6 years, poverty has gone down by 10.2% in Gujarat, while the national average has gone down by \n9.9%. During the same period, state gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.2%, faster than the national average \nof 6.4%.  \n   \n ", "    Appendix 8 37\n   \nDuring project preparation, NHAI consulted a broad range of stakeholders, including (i) heads of \nhouseholds and or businesses to be affected, (ii) affected persons in small groups, (iii) village \npanchayat and sarpanch, (iv) local voluntary organizations and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \n(v) government agencies and departments; and (vi) women and other vulnerable groups.   \n \nAs a part of the poverty assessment, community assessment was conducted with various local \ncommunities, including scheduled castes and tribes. \n \nThe Project includes a capacity-building component to familiarize NHAI management and staff with the \nconcept of stakeholder participation and best practices in participation, inside and outside India. This \ncomponent will help NHAI better understand highway development activities and feedback from them. \n \n \nD.

Description of the Project  \n \n1.  The East-West Corridor Project in Gujarat, western India, will improve and upgrade \n504.6 kilometers (km) of national highway ([NH] 8A, 8B, 14, and 15) from Porbander to Dessa. \nThe corridor is the principal one in the state. The Project consists of five NH sections (Table \nA9.1) and will widen the entire stretch to four lanes; and improve junctions, underpasses, and \ntwo bypasses.1 The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is the project Executing Agency.  \n \nTable A9.1: Project Roads \n       \nLength  \nRoad   Roads \n(km) \nSection 1  Porbander-Jetpur Road (NH8B)    115.0 \nSection 2  Jetpur-Gondal Road and Rajkot Bypass (NH8B)    36.3 \nSection 3  Bamanmore-Samakhiali Road (NH8A)    125.4 \nSection 4  Samakhiali-Radhanpur Road (NH15)    142.5 \nSection 5  Radhanpur-Deesa (NH14)    85.4 \nTotal      504.6 \n   \n2.  The existing right of way of NHs are generally 45 meters (m), except for NH14 and NH15 \n(sections 4 and 5), which have a 60 m right of way. The four-lane facility comprises a 7 m \nsegregated carriageway divided by medians of varying width and on an average 2.0 X 1.5 m \npaved shoulder. The four-lane carriageway is designed for vehicles traveling at an average of \n100 km/hour. Improvement works can be carried out within the existing right of way except for \nminor adjustments and alignment straightening. Since NHAI already owns the existing right of \nway for entire road sections, new acquisition will be minimal and confined largely to construction \nof the bypasses in Ranavav and Upleta.  \n \nB.  Project Impacts  \n \n1.  Land Acquisition \n \n3.  The Project will permanently acquire nearly 364 hectares. The bulk of land acquisition \n(Table  A9.2)  will  be  in  sections  1  (NH8B),  2  (NH8A),  and  3  (NH8A)  for  major  bypasses, \nresettlement site, and realignment. Efforts have been made to minimize land acquisition and \nsignificantly  reduce  resettlement  impacts  by  (i)  keeping  the  improvement  works  within  the \nexisting right of way, (ii) adopting symmetrical widening, (iii) raising carriageway over congested \nsegments, and (iv) building bypasses to avoid congested urban settlements. Provisions for 10 \nrailways  over  bridge  and/or  under  bridge  and  138  underpasses  were  made  following \nconsultations  with  affected  communities  and  local  government  officials,  to  facilitate \nuninterrupted movement of people, livestock, and tractor and or trucks used for cultivation.    \n \n                                                 \n1 Although these five sections are different from those for packaging purposes, both sections cover the same \nstretches. \n   ", "    Appendix 9   39   \nTable A9.2: Land Acquisition for the Project  \n \nJunction  Development of  Total \nSection  Bypasses  Realignments \nImprovements  Resettlement Sites  (ha) \nNH8B\u2013Section 1    55.0  111    51.0    217 \nNH 8B\u2013Section 2    10.1  \uf8e7    4.9  15 \nNH8A\u2013Section 3    24.0  \uf8e7    42.0  \uf8e7  66 \nNH15\u2013Section 4    20.0  \uf8e7    28.0  \uf8e7  48 \nNH14\u2013Section 5    15.0  \uf8e7    3.0  \uf8e7  18 \nTotal    124.1  111    124.0  4.9  364 \nHa = hectares, NH = national highway \n \n2.  Types of Losses \n \n4.  The census/socioeconomic surveys carried out in May 2002 generated a full inventory of \nassets and losses of affected persons for relocation assistance. A sizeable number of 1,738 \nsmall business enterprises (SBEs), 480 informal settlers, and 308 agricultural families will be \naffected; a total of 13,064 people will be affected by the Project (Table A9.3).  \n \nTable A9.3: Project Affected Families \n  \nPopulation \nSections  Affected Families  Affected Persons \n(% of total) \nSection I    423    1,589    12.17 \nSection II    401    2,141    16.38 \nSection III    411    2,368    18.13 \nSection IV    176    910    6.97 \nSection V    1,115    6,056    46.35 \nTotal    2,526    13,064    100.00 \n    Source: Census Survey. \n \n5.  Close to 60% of all affected SBEs are in section 5 (Radhanpur to Deesa).  Roadside \ninformal settlers (business and residential) form the largest group (68%) and are concentrated in \nsections 5, 2, and 3. Most informal settlers are small business owners and vendors. About 69% \nof  all  affected  units  (2,526  informal  settlers,  SBEs,  and  agricultural  families)  are \nbusiness/commercial enterprises. An estimated 480 informal settlers (19%) will be relocated. \nLand acquisition for the bypasses will likely affect an estimated 300 households, of which only \nabout 25 may require relocation; the rest will lose only agricultural plots.  However, because of \nstrip acquisition, impacts are not expected to be significant.   \n  \n6.  According to the census data, over two thirds of these small business owners are poor, \nlargely depend only on their businesses, and are mainly illegal occupants on the right of way \nand thus vulnerable economically and socially. Roadside residents will lose access to right of \nway and structures whereas business owners will lose their livelihoods. Losses include (i) \nstructures (business and/or residential), (ii) business, (iii) employment, (iv) income (temporarily), \nand (v) access to right of way to income-generating activities and livelihood sources.  About \n71% of the affected structures are roadside commercial units. Close to 16% of the structures \nare  residential.  The  over  100  community  structures  will  also  be  affected  by  project  road \nwidening.  Types of structures are (i) temporary (kuccha, 28%); (ii) semipermanent (semi-pucca, \n52%); and (iii) permanent (pucca, 20%).  \n \n   ", "40  Appendix 9   \n3.  Project Impact on Indigenous and Vulnerable groups \n \n7.  The project census identified 334 indigenous and or scheduled tribes in five sections, \nwho are largely small business owners on the right-of-way alignments. The census identified the \nscheduled tribes without differentiating them. However, Anthropological Survey of India and \nother secondary sources state that the most important scheduled tribes in the project area are \nthe  Koli,  Bhil,  Paradhi,  and  Vaghri.  Socioeconomic  and  occupational/income  data  clearly \nsuggests that the project-affected scheduled tribe households and SBEs are similar to the \noverall affected population and largely assimilated into the local mainstream communities.   \n \n8.  The vulnerable group consists of scheduled castes (371 members), scheduled tribes \n(305), female-headed households (16), those below the poverty line (729), and other backward \ncastes  (882).  A  trained  and  experienced  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  will  work \nexclusively with these vulnerable groups, especially scheduled tribes, to restore their income \nthrough training and skill development and other sustainable programs to be designed after \nneeds  assessment  during  project  implementation.  The  NGO  will  help  vulnerable  affected \npersons benefit from ongoing poverty reduction programs targeted at scheduled tribes and the \nvery poor.  \n \nC.  Resettlement Principles and Compensation  \n \n9.  The land acquisition is governed by the National Highways Act of 1956 as amended in \n1997, which has considerably simplified acquisition procedures. The resettlement plan is guided \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement as well as NHAI \npolicies and practices related to resettlement in ongoing ADB-funded projects. The primary \nobjective of the plan is to address all kind of losses and impacts of the project on different target \ngroups, businesses, and structures. Based on the inventory of losses, an entitlement matrix has \nbeen developed that identifies the affected persons and their losses, defines compensation and \nentitlements,  and  allocates  accountability  for  various  resettlement  tasks.  Affected  persons\u2019 \nlosses  will  be  dealt  with  as  follows:  (i)  titled  owners  will  be  paid  at  market  rates;  (ii) \nsharecroppers/tenants  will  be  compensated  for  loss  of  access  and/or  crops;  (iii)  loss  of \nstructures (by type) will be compensated at current construction/replacement costs; (iv) material \ncan be salvaged at no cost; and (v) income losses will be compensated, with vulnerable groups \nreceiving additional assistance. For nontitled persons (informal settlers/SBEs), the cut-off date \nfor eligibility is the date of the census in that road section. Publication of notification under \nsection 3A(i) of the NHAI Act will apply to landowners.  \n \n10.  Another major objective of the resettlement plan is to restore and improve the economic \ncondition  of  the  affected  persons,  particularly  the  vulnerable  groups.  Measures  such  as \nfacilitating transition allowance for lost livelihood, business/economic rehabilitation support, and \nalternative livelihood training have been adopted. Further details will be prepared during project \nimplementation. Economic rehabilitation will be partly supported by jobs in project construction. \nAs many children working in roadside business will be affected, the project NGO will help \nmainstream them in education and tap various government schemes to help the children\u2019s \nhouseholds earn income. The resettlement plan implementing agencies will liaison with the \nblock development officer, zilla parishad (district council), and gram panchayat to rehabilitate \nchild workers.  \n \n \n \n   ", "    Appendix 9   41   \nD.  Stakeholder Participation, Disclosure of the Resettlement Plan, and Grievances \n \n11.  At  various  stages  of  project  planning,  affected  persons  have  been  informed  and \nconsulted about the likely project impacts. Various stakeholders consulted include (i) heads of \nhouseholds/business units to be affected; (ii) affected persons in small groups; (iii) village \npanchayat, sarpanch, and their members; (iv) local voluntary organizations and NGOs; (v) \ngovernment agencies and departments; and (vi) women and other vulnerable groups. The \nconsultation will continue throughout project implementation.   \n \n12.  The draft resettlement plan was translated into Gujarati and disclosed to the affected \npersons  and  other  stakeholders  for  review  and  comments  on  the  policy  in  general  and \nadequacy of the mitigation measures in particular. Comments were collected 1 month after \ndisclosure. NHAI organized public consultation meetings and workshops to share the public\u2019s \nviews on the resettlement plan.  Key findings of disclosure and consultation indicate full support \nfor the Project. Some of the concerns raised have already been addressed by adjusting the road \ndesign and improving compensation and resettlement policy measures and entitlements. The \ngrievance  redress  centers  (GRCs)  will  comprise  the  project  director  (NHAI);  district \ncommissioner  or  his  or  her  representative;  representatives  of  affected  persons  (male  and \nfemale); local government/panchayat representative; resettlement officer for the project section \n(NHAI); local. Land acquisition officer; and a representative of the NGO implementing the \nresettlement plan.  GRC claims will be reviewed and resolved within three weeks from the date \nof submission to the local committee.    \n \nE.  Relocation Site Development and Rehabilitation Assistance \n \n13.  Two relocation and resettlement sites have been identified in Rajkot (section 2) and \nThara (section 5) in consultation with the affected persons and local administration. In Rajkot, \nabout 400 informal residential units will be resettled; the affected persons are generally poor \nmigrant laborers and depend largely on the local industries/service sectors for their livelihood. \nThe site is approximately 2-km from the existing settlements. In Thara, affected units are over \n600 shops. The proposed site is next to the existing location, which will minimize disruption of \nbusinesses during project construction.   \n \n14.  Several relocation options and strategies have been developed. The site for residential \ndwellers will be developed with basic civic amenities (e.g., internal roads, sanitary facilities, \nwater and power supply, and community facilities). The households affected by land acquisition \nhave expressed their desire for self-relocation. In addition to compensation for lost assets, \nrelocated  families  will  receive  house  reconstruction  grants  and  shifting  allowances  for \nresettlement.  \n \nF.  Road Safety, HIV/AIDS,2  and Health Risks  \n \n15.  The economic cost of road accidents in Gujarat is estimated at Rs500 million. The \nproject road sections have hardly any signs for pedestrians, schools, hospitals, bus and truck \nstops, and rural markets. The improved road will likely cause highway accidents due to heavy \ntraffic; faster vehicles; and combination of multimodes of traffic, including slow-moving and \nhuman-powered vehicles. However, the project design has integrated some safety measures \nsuch as provisions for intersections, underpasses, rail over bridges, paved shoulders, and \nservice roads for local traffic, especially in rural areas so that farmers can safely move their \n                                                 \n2 Human immonudeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n   ", "42  Appendix 9   \nherds. The project design also integrates right-of-way management, alternative markets for \nroadside vendors, and provisions for bus and truck stops to reduce accidents. The Project will \nconduct safety awareness and traffic education campaigns through the NGO, which will work \nwith state government agencies and involve private sector institutions such as automobile \ncompanies, automobile associations, truckers associations, and community groups.  \n \n16.  Focus group discussions with truck, chakra (improvised auto-rickshaw), and taxi drivers; \nroadside dhaba (wayside restaurant) owners; and tea-stall owners reveal that HIV is a serious \nproblem  among  highway  sex  workers  and  their  clients.  Gujarat  has  the  sixth-largest  HIV-\ninfected population in India. HIV infection is 5% or more among high-risk groups such as the \npoor; marginalized groups, including sex workers; migrant laborers; and truck drivers. These \ngroups, particularly truckers, spread HIV/AIDs around the country. Road improvements will \nlikely worsen the already alarming situation. \n \n17.  The  resettlement  plan  addresses  HIV/AIDs  and  health  issues.  During  project \nimplementation, qualified NGOs will conduct information and education campaign on HIV/AID \nand other sexually transmitted diseases. The campaign will target project construction workers \nat campsites, truckers at truck stops and dhaba, and everyone along the alignment. The NGOs \nwill work closely with state agencies and community networks dedicated to prevention work. \n \nG.  Implementation Framework and Budget \n \n18.  The Environmental and Social Development Unit of NHAI will implement and supervise \nthe resettlement plan. NHAI will engage qualified and experienced NGOs separately to (i) \nimplement the resettlement plan, (ii) run road safety and HIV/AIDs awareness and education \nprograms, and (iii) work with scheduled tribes and affected persons and communities. NGOs will \nplay an important role in conducting the information campaign on resettlement plan policies and \nentitlements, disbursing compensation packages as described in the matrix, ensuring redressal \nof affected persons\u2019 legitimate grievances, and attending to the needs of vulnerable groups.  \n \n19.  A resettlement unit will be established within the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for \nproject-level resettlement plan implementation. The resettlement unit will be headed by the \nproject director (PIU), and supported by five NHAI resettlement and rehabilitation officers, one \nfor  each  section.  They  will  coordinate  and  supervise  NGO  work  in  the  field  and  help  all \ncommittees  at  the  district  level  resolve  issues  related  to  resettlement.  Under  technical \nassistance, NHAI will conduct resettlement management training for its staff and partner agency \npersonnel implementing the resettlement plan. The training will also focus on issues related to \nthe  corridor  and  right-of-way  management  and  develop  guidelines  for  right-of-way  land \nmanagement and development plans. \n  \n20.  The resettlement plan, including land acquisition, will be implemented over 36 months. \nCompensation for acquired assets will be paid before construction begins. The resettlement site \nwill  be  built  before  people  are  relocated.  Social  development  and  income  restoration  will \ncontinue throughout the project period. The total resettlement budget is Rs34,290,000. The \nestimates  include  all  costs  related  to  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  including \ncompensation/resettlement assistance, relocation, shifting costs, NGO services, and monitoring \nand evaluation.  \n \n   ", "    Appendix 9   43   \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n21.  The resettlement plan will have internal and external monitoring, methods of which are \nspecified in the resettlement plan.  Internal monitoring will be done by the resettlement unit. It \nwill  monitor  compliance  with  the  resettlement  plan\u2019s  principles  and  matrix,  compensation \npayment, compensation record, completion of compensation three months before construction, \njob creation, raising of safety and HIV/AIDs awareness, and GRCs, including satisfaction of the \naggrieved parties.    \n \n22.  External monitoring will be carried out by a suitably qualified external expert/agency to \nbe hired by NHAI (with ADB\u2019s concurrence) to monitor and evaluate the resettlement plan \nactivities. The external monitor will be selected within three months of loan approval. Monitoring \nwill be carried out every six months in the first two years, and then annually through 2005. The \nmonitoring findings will be shared as reports to NHAI and ADB.  \n   ", "44  Appendix 10   \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  The  East-West  (E-W)  Corridor  Project  is  under  category  B  in  accordance  with  the \nenvironmental assessment requirements of the Asian Development Bank. A consulting firm \nengaged by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) prepared an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE), on which this summary IEE is based. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The Project will have an investment component to rehabilitate and widen five highway \nsections totaling 504 kilometers (km). The project roads cover the Porbandar-Deesa stretch, \nwhich connects the highways and forms a part of the E-W Corridor. The investment component \nis in the following sections: 1 \n \n(i)  Porbandar-Jetpur, National Highway (NH) 8B (km 2\u2013117), 115 km total; \n(ii)  Jetpur-Gondal,  NH8B;  and  Rajkot  Bypass  (km  117.0\u2013143.3,  and  km  175.0\u2013\n185.0), 36.3 km total; \n(iii)  Bamanbore-Samakhiyali, NH8A (km 182.5\u2013308.0), 125.4 km total; \n(iv)  Samakhiyali-Radhanpur, NH15 (km 281.3\u2013138.8), 142.5 km total; and  \n(v)  Radhanpur-Deesa, NH14, 85.4 km total. \n \n3.  The  project  road  has  a  generally  two-lane  carriageway  configuration  with  flexible \npavement. Some semiurban roads have four-lane dual carriageways. The existing shoulders \nare either granular or earthen, but are paved in urban and semiurban areas.  \n \n4.   Road rehabilitation and improvement will (i) expand two-lane roads (26.5 meters [m] \nwide, including shoulders) to four lane; (ii) construct a 94.2 km service road in built-up areas, \nwith a carriageway width of 5.5\u20137.0 m and separators of 1.5\u20132.0 m; (iii) improve 205 bridges \nand 542 culverts, and reconstruct the Surajbari bridge; (iv) construct seven railway over bridges; \nand  (v)  establish  road  accessories,  segregate  slow-  and  fast-moving  traffic,  and  build \nemergency parking and toll plazas.  \n \nC.   Description of the Environment \n \n5.  The project sections are under Gujarat provincial administration. The environmental \nconditions of the project areas are summarized below: \n \n(i)  Porbandar-Jetpur.  In  Porbandar  and  Rajkot  districts,  the  area  is  flat.  Road \nalignment passes mainly through agricultural land. Soil is alluvial and contains \nlime. About 142 big and small rivers, including streams, are in the area, and \nabout 10 tanks exist along the road alignment. The groundwater table is about 5\u2013\n15 m deep. Rainfall is very low. No conservation area exists in and around the \nproject road area. About 40,000 trees on both sides of the road, and about \n18,000 other trees will likely be cut to widen the road.  \n  \n                                                 \n1  Although the way of dividing Project highway is different from that in the main text, these fivesections cover the \nentire stretches of the Project highway. \n ", "    Appendix 10          45 \n(ii)  Jetpur-Gondal. This section passes mainly through Rajkot. The area is flat. \nGroundwater is about 5\u201315 m deep, and about 19 big and small rivers, including \ncanals, cross the road alignment. The area is congested, but about 80% of the \nroad alignment passes through an agricultural area. No conservation or sensitive \narea exist within 10 km of either side of the road. About 8,000 trees on both sides \nof the road, and about 5,500 other trees will likely be cut to widen the road.  \n \n(iii)  Bamanbore-Samakhiyali.  In  Surendranagar  and  Kachch  districts,  this  road \nsection passes through some rolling terrain, but 80% passes through flat area, \nmostly farms. The climate is dry, and rainfall is only about 30\u201360 centimeters per \nyear. The road crosses 26 rivers, streams, and canals. Within 10 km of either \nside of the road are 16 patches of forest but none categorized as a conservation \narea. About 9,000 trees on both sides of the road, and about 5,000 other trees \nwill likely be cut to widen the road.  \n \n(iv)  Samakhiyali-Radhanpur.  In  Kachch  and  Patan  districts,  it  mostly  passes \nthrough a flat, mainly agricultural area. Groundwater is about 5\u201315 m deep. This \nsection crosses 23 rivers, streams, and canals; 9 ponds exist along the road \nalignment. From km 199 to 205, the two-lane road passes close to the Ghudkar \nwildlife  sanctuaries.  However,  the  existence  of  endangered  species  is  not \nreported. The area is highly populated, however, with 23 patches of forest within \n10 km of either side of the road. About 24,000 trees grow along the roadside. \nAbout 14,000 will likely be cut for road widening. \n \n(v)  Radhanpur-Deesa. In Patan and Banaskantha districts, the road passes through \na mostly flat, mainly agricultural area. Only one river crosses the road alignment, \nbut 108 small tanks exist along the alignment. No conservation or other sensitive \nareas exist within 10 km of either side of the road. However, of the 55,000 trees \non both sides of the alignment, 50% will likely be cut for road widening.  \n  \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n6.  Potential impacts were screened but no significant environmental impact was identified. \nThe Project is to upgrade the existing roads, none of which are in environmentally sensitive \nareas. \n  \n7.  The environmental impacts associated with construction include (i) disruption of traffic in \nthe  construction  area,  (ii)  increased  air  pollution  due  to  dust  and  other  volatile  chemical \nsubstances from the asphalt plant, (iii) noise and vibration, (iv) disruption of the water system \ndue to cutting and filling and other earth works, (v) potential erosion and landslides due to \nelevation of some part of the road, and (vi) impacts due to disposal of construction wastes.  \nThese impacts will be limited to the construction period and are thus manageable. Mitigation \nmeasures include (i) rerouting the traffic with clear signs, (ii) maintaining the optimum moisture \ncontent during handling of soil, spraying water to minimize dust, and maintaining a safe distance \nbetween the asphalt plant and public facilities, including schools, (iii) strictly controlling the \nconstruction works that create noise and vibration by prohibiting night works in residential areas, \n(iv) pumping stagnant water away, and providing an adequate drainage system, (v) prohibiting \nthe  asphalt  plant  from  being  built  near  forests  and  residential  areas,  (vi)  stabilizing  road \nembankment side slopes, (vii) confining stage construction in flood areas to the dry season, and \n(viii) avoiding road widening at pond sites. These measures will be required in contractors\u2019 \n \n ", "46  Appendix 10   \ncontracts. Borrow pits in fertile agriculture lands and in areas prone to erosion and landslides \nwill be restricted. Former borrow pit areas will be restored and rehabilitated. \n \n8.   The  environmental  impacts  associated  with  project  operation  are  (i)  increased  air \npollution and noise, and (ii) increased accidents. To address these problems, physical barriers \nwill be established and good road signs installed.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n9.  The environmental management and monitoring plans (EMMP) were prepared as part of \nthe  IEE  study  for  all  road  sections  in  this  investment  component.  On  this  basis,  it  was \nrecommended that the Environmental and Social Development Unit be responsible for ensuring \nthat  the  bidding  documents  and  contract  clearly  define  environmental  responsibilities  and \npenalties  for  noncompliance.  Contractors  will  implement  mitigation  measures  during  the \nconstruction. The project engineer for each road section will check that the contractors do so. \nThe state\u2019s Department of Forestry will plant trees. NHAI will implement the EMMP to mitigate \nthe Project\u2019s environmental impacts.  \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n10.  The IEE study shows that the Project will significantly reduce vehicle operating costs, \nincrease jobs during construction, and reduce traffic congestion. However, the Project will also \nhave negative environmental impacts. The IEE thus recommends taking measures to minimize \nthem. It identifies the project area as not environmentally sensitive and a full environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) study is thus not required. NHAI assures that no civil works will be \ncarried out before clearance from the Department of Forestry on tree cutting. Monitoring will be \ncontinuous. Total cost for implementing the EMMP, including mitigation measures and tree \ncompensation, is approximately $2.1 million  \n  \nG.  Conclusion \n \n11.  Overall, the IEE found that the Project will not cause significant environmental problems. \nPotential  adverse  impacts  are  temporary  and,  thus,  manageable.  They  will  not  affect  any \nenvironmentally sensitive area, and a full EIA study is, therefore, not required. The EMMP is \nsufficiently detailed and provides enforceable actions to be undertaken by NHAI to mitigate the \nimpacts and maintain environmental quality during project operation. \n ", "  Appendix 11            47\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SECTOR\nA.

Background \n \n1.  The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was created under an act of Parliament \nin 1988, and became fully operational in 1995 with the appointment of the chair. In 1995, NHAI\u2019s \nmandate was limited to implementing Asian Development Bank (ADB)-assisted works for a total \nof 333 kilometers (km) of highway. From 1995 to 1998, the Ministry of Surface Transport \nentrusted other projects to NHAI. In 1998, its mandate was significantly enlarged when the \nagency  was  entrusted  with  the  National  Highways  Development  Project  (NHDP).  It  is  an \nambitious  road  building  program  with  two  major  components:  (i)  the  5,952  km  Golden \nQuadrilateral, which connects Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Calcutta; and (ii) the 7,300 km \nNorth-South  and  East-West  corridors  connecting  Srinagar-Kanya  Kumari  and  Silchar-\nPorbandar. Responsible now for NHDP and upgrading 1,000 km of road linkages to India\u2019s \nmajor ports, NHAI has authority over a 14,000 km network of national highways. \n \nB.   Legal Status and Autonomy \n \n2.  As  defined  in  the  National  Highway  Authority  of  India  Act  of  1988,  which  legally \nconstituted  NHAI,  its  mandate  and  function  is  the  \u201cdevelopment,  maintenance,  and \nmanagement of national highways\u201d (and any other highways vested in or entrusted to it by the \nGovernment). The act defines NHAI as a \u201cbody corporate\u201d with the power to \u201cacquire, hold, and \ndispose of property, to contract and to sue and be sued.\u201d \n \n3.  In  the  discharge  of  its  functions,  NHAI  will  act,  \u201cso  far  as  may  be,  on  business \nprinciples.\u201d With the consent of the central Government, NHAI may (i) \u201cborrow money from any \nsource by the issue of bonds, debentures or such instruments as it may deem fit for discharging \nany of its functions\u201d; (ii) \u201cform one or more companies (under the Companies Act 1956) to \nfurther the efficient discharge of its functions\u201d; (iii) engage or entrust any of its functions to any \ncorporation or body corporate owned or controlled by the Government; and (iv) collect fees on \nbehalf of the central Government (and state government) for services or benefits rendered \nunder section 7 of the National Highways Act of 1956 on terms and conditions as may be \nspecified by such governments.  \n \n4.  The act enables the Government, with notification in the Official Gazette, to supersede \nNHAI for such period not exceeding 1 year. The act also requires that NHAI comply with central \nGovernment orders (i) on such directions on questions of policy; (ii) on contract form or contract \nvalues that exceed such value or amount as prescribed by the central Government; and (iii) on \ninstruction to entrust the development, maintenance, or management of any national highway or \na part thereof, to such person as may be specified by the central Government.  \n \nC.   Corporate Structure and Staffing Level \n \n5.  NHAI\u2019s  management  board  consists  of  \u201ca  Chairman,  not  more  than  five  full-time \nmembers  and  not  more  than  four  part-time  members,\u201d  to  be  appointed  by  the  central \nGovernment with their term of office, remuneration level, and other conditions of service therein \nprescribed. NHAI is to \u201cappoint such number of officers and other employees as it may consider \nnecessary on such terms and conditions as may be laid down by [its] regulations.\u201d \n \n6.  NHAI\u2019s management board is composed of four full-time members: for administration, \nfinance, technical matters, and private investment; and four part-time members: secretaries of \n ", "    Appendix 12  49\nthe  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways  (MORTH),  Ministry  of  Planning,  Ministry  of \nExpenditure, and Director General for Roads Department of MORTH. NHAI\u2019s operations are \norganized on two tiers: the head office and the project implementation unit. The head office has \n10 departments and or divisions: administration, finance and accounts, information technology \nand  planning,  vigilance,  technical,  corridor  management,  East-West  Corridor,  North-South \nCorridor, World Bank projects, and private investment. Forty-six PIUs have been established \nacross the country, each reporting to its regional technical department: five support ADB project \nactivities (Chitradurga, Durgapur, Gurgaon, Valsad, and Vijayawada); six support World Bank \nproject activities (Agra, Allahabad, Kanpur, Koderma, Trichy, and Varanasi); and four support \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) project activities (Bhubaneswar, Ghaziabad, \nGuntar, and Naini). \n \n7.  As of the beginning of FY2003, NHAI had 530 full-time employees: 126 (24%) regular, \n270 (51%) on deputation from various government departments; and 134 (25%) hired on a \ncontract basis. The head office has a staff of 235: 96 professional and 139 support. PIUs have a \ntotal of 295 staff: 182 professional and 113 support. At the head office, the administration and \nfinance departments employ 49 staff each, with the technical departments employing the rest. \nThe number of PIU staff depends on the unit's workload, with an average of six staff per PIU. \n \n8.  NHAI has issued to the end of FY2002 87 contracts valued at Rs170.8 billion to build \nhighways: 78 are for construction (Rs144.6 billion), 4 for build-operate-transfer (Rs15.2 billion), \nand 5 for special-purpose vehicles (Rs11.0 billion).  \n \n9.  At the end of FY2002, NHAI will manage and maintain the 1,881 km of highway it has \ncompleted. NHAI has issued four maintenance contracts of Rs53 million to maintain 486 km of \nnational highways.  \n \nD.   Past ADB Assistance to the National Highways Authority of India  \n \n10.  ADB provided a $180-million loan for the Surat-Manor Tollway (SMT) Project in 2000, \nand a $240-million loan for the Western Transport Corridor (WTC) Project in 2001.

The SMT and WTC projects both have three study and or capacity-building components \nand  one  technical  assistance  (TA):  (i)  development  of  a  concession  agreement  for  road \noperation and maintenance (to start soon); (ii) toll system study (now selecting consultants); (iii) \nenvironmental  management  training  (not  started  yet,  but  agreement  secured  during  the \nappraisal meeting for early training); and (iv) study to enhance corporate financing capability \n(two of four components have already been undertaken as a part of the other exercises). A \ncomputer model has been developed for financial planning and subsequent development of an \ninvestment strategy under the ongoing project preparatory technical assistance arrangement for \nthe National Highway Corridor \u2014Public-Private Partnership\u2014 Project. Phase-2 activities have \ncommenced as a part of the World Bank-financed Institutional Strengthening Study, with its \nterms of reference modified to incorporate ADB\u2019s. Because of these changes, the team intends \nto seek management approval to modify the scope of the study separately from this Project. \nEfforts will be made to ensure the early initiation and completion of the studies and capacity-\nbuilding exercises. \n \n   "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20021106145652Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20030117094811+08'00'"}}
