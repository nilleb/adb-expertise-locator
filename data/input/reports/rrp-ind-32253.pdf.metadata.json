Its key components are: (i) rehabilitation and widening of \nthe Golden Quadrilateral, approximately 6,000 kilometers (km) of \nhighway  network,  slated  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2003 \n(phase 1); and (ii) rehabilitation and widening of the North-South \n(N-S; 4,000 km) and East-West (E-W; 3,300 km) corridors, which \nare to be completed by the end of 2007 (phase 2).  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided two loans in 2000 \nand  2001  to  develop  the  Golden  Quadrilateral.  The  proposed \nProject is the first in the series of loans to be extended to the E-W \nand  N-S  corridors,  mainly  to  remove  the  capacity  constraints  in \nthe E-W Corridor in the State of Gujarat by expanding 504 km of \ntwo-lane national highways into four lanes. Of these, 468 km will \nbe developed under a straightforward public finance arrangement, \nand  the  remaining  36  km  under  a  build-operate-transfer  (BOT) \nscheme. \n \nADB  takes  a  programmatic  approach  to  achieve  its  medium-  to \nlong-term  goals  in  a  progressive  and  evolutionary  manner.  The \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  (RRP)  on  the \nWestern Transport Corridor Project states these goals as follows: \n(i) transform the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) into a \nmanagerially  and  financially  autonomous  body,  (ii)  enhance  its \nfund  mobilization  and \nfinancial  management  capability,  (iii) \nstrengthen  institutional  capacity  for  project  implementation  and \ninstitute \nhighway  operation  and  maintenance \ntransparent corporate governance, and (v) promote public-private \npartnerships.  \n \nThe Project intends to pursue these goals through policy dialogue \nand assistance programs that will (i) secure more funds for phase \n2  of  NHDP,  (ii)  establish  \u201can  arm\u2019s-length  relationship\u201d  between \nNHAI  and  its  oversight  agency,  (iii)  institute  a  clearly  defined \norganizational  structure  with  increased  accountability  for  O&M, \nand  (iv) \nthrough  BOT \nschemes.  \n \n\nfacilitate  private  sector  participation \n\n(O&M), \n\n(iv) \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nADB\u2019s  multi-year  lending  program  to  NHDP  aims  to  establish  an \nenabling environment for efficient highway development and O&M \nwith  maximum  private  sector  participation.  The  Project  was \ndesigned to (i) facilitate the transformation of NHAI into a lean and \nfinancial \nefficient  organization  with  strong  managerial  and \nautonomy; (ii) reduce the capacity constraint of the E-W Corridor \nby rehabilitating and widening the two-lane highways to four-lane \nstandard; (iii) promote public-private partnership by helping NHAI \ndesign  and  implement  a  BOT  component;  and  (iv)  strengthen \nNHAI\u2019s  capacity  to  deal  with  emerging  social  issues  such  as \ngrievance  handling,  stakeholder  participation,  communicable \ndiseases, and road safety. \n \nTotal  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $576  million  equivalent, \nincluding  allowances \ninterest  during \nconstruction.  Foreign  exchange  costs  are  estimated  at  $377 \nmillion, representing 65% of the total cost, while the local currency \ncosts are estimated at $199 million equivalent, representing 35%. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $320  million  from  its \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project,  while  the \nGovernment  cover  the  foreign  currency  cost  of  $28  million  to \ncover the front-end fee and interest during construction, and $183 \nmillion equivalent in local currency cost. \n \n\nfor  contingencies  and \n\n \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nPrivate Sector \nTotal \n \n\n \n \n\n($ million) \n\nPercentage \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n320 \n28 \n29 \n377 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n0 \n183 \n16 \n199 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n \n  320 \n  211 \n  45 \n  576 \n\n \n \n56% \n \n37% \n \n \n8% \n  100% \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $320  million  from  the  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nand  Project  Agreements.  The  Government  will  cover  the  cost  of \n$211  million  equivalent  in  foreign  and  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment will promptly make the proceeds of the loan available \nto NHAI. The Government\u2019s current policy of assistance to NHAI \nfor the Golden Quadrilateral in this regard is a loan-grant ratio of \n20:80,  and  for  this  Project,  that  forms  part  of  the  E-W  Corridor, \nPublic  Investment  Board  clearance  has  already  been  given  in  a \nloan-grant ratio of 20:80 on which a cabinet decision is expected \nsoon. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk of the \nloan. \n \nUntil 31 December 2006 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\nlending \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nfollowing \n\nfor  Procurement \n\n \n30 June 2006 \n \n \nNHAI \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  by  two  project  implementation \nunits to be established by NHAI along the project highways. \n \nProcurement of civil works will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines \ninternational \ncompetitive bidding procedures. \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  construction  supervision. \nThey will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection  \nmethod  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  use  of \nConsultants,  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nselecting and engaging domestic consultants. \n \nThe  main  quantifiable  project  benefit  is  savings  in  vehicle \noperating  costs,  which  will  reduce  transport  costs.  The  Project\u2019s \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  22%.  Direct \nbeneficiaries  of \ntransport \noperators. Since the transport industry is competitive and likely to \npass  on  the  benefits  of  transport  cost  savings  to  end  users,  the \npublic will also benefit. \n \nImproved road networks will increase the economic opportunities \nof the rural poor by (i) enabling villagers to shift from subsistence \nfarming to market oriented agricultural surplus production; and (ii) \nencouraging poor agricultural workers to move out of their villages \nto  work  in  better-paid  occupations  in  manufacturing  or  trading. \nImproved  roads  will  also  provide  social  benefits  such  as  (i) \nimproved  access  to  health,  education,  and  social  services;  and \n(iii) increased access to learning opportunities, thus reducing the \nsense  of  isolation  from  cultural  and  commercial  centers.  The \nProject  will  also  have  a  short-term  impact  on  poverty  reduction. \nConstruction  works  and  tree  planting,  together  with  ensuing \nmaintenance  works,  will  allow  the  rural  poor  to  earn  cash.  They \nare  generally  not  engaged  in  wage-earning  jobs  and  are  thus \nlargely  dependent  on  occasional  and  uncertain  employment,  so \nthese opportunities have a direct impact on earnings. \n\nthe  Project  are  road  users  and \n\n \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nA potential risk is delayed implementation due to proplonged land \nacquisition.  However,  the  need  for  land  acquisition  is  limited \nexcept for the two bypasses, grade separations, and realignments \nalong  the  existing  routes.  Additional  land  required  for  service \nroads  and  drainage  lines  is  mostly  available  within  the  existing \nright of way. The land acquisition procedures recently introduced \nby the National Highway Act (1997) will minimize the potential risk \nof implementation delay. The new procedure will enable NHAI to \nproceed with land acquisition more expeditiously and predictably.  \n \nResettlement could also delay project implementation. Mobilizing \nthe  implementing  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  within  2 \nmonths of ADB Board approval of the Project has also minimized \nthis  risk.  NGO  staff  will  process  and  resolve  all  resettlement-\nrelated matters, including payment of compensation. Coordination \nmechanisms will be established at the state and district levels to \nresolve land acquisition or resettlement-related issues \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nto India for the East-West Corridor Project.   \n\n \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nIndia\u2019s  58,000-kilometer  (km)  national  highway  (NH)  system,  2%  of  India\u2019s  total  road \nnetwork  in  length,  carries  over  40%  of  the  country\u2019s  road  traffic.  Yet  the  system's  highway \ncapacity, riding quality, and road safety are all poor.  \n \n3. \nHighway Capacity.  Of all NHs, 38% still have one lane; 59%, two lanes; and 3%, four \nor more lanes. Nearly half of these roads are seriously congested, with volume capacity ratio of \nmore  than  1.3.  With  rapid  economic  expansion  in  the  last  10  years  at  the  rate  of  6-7% \ninadequate highway capacity has seriously threatened the continued expansion of the national \neconomy.  The  Government  has  thus  launched  the  National  Highways  Development  Program \n(NHDP),  an  ambitious  program  to  upgrade  13,000  km  of  NHs  to  increase  the  percentage  of \nfour- and six-lane highways from 3% to 22% by 2007.  \n \n4. \nRiding Quality.  Poor road conditions reduce the average vehicle speed and thus raise \nvehicle operating costs. On project highways, for example, the average vehicle speed is 38 km \nper hour, enabling vehicles to travel only 300 km per day as opposed to 500-600 km per day in \nadvanced economies. The international roughness index is currently 4\u20137 meter (m) per km on \nNHs and is to be improved to 2.5\u20133.0 m per km by 2007 on NHDP roads.  \n \n5. \nRoad Safety. Poor driving conditions, coupled with the undivided carriageway design of \nNHs, caused traffic accidents to rise at an average of 5% per year in 1971-1998. Among Asian \ncountries,  India  ranks  fourth  for  road  traffic  accidents.  The  number  of  fatalities  per  10,000 \nvehicles in India is 20, which is lower than in Bangladesh (45), People's Republic of China (25), \nand Sri Lanka (24), but significantly higher than in Viet Nam (11), Thailand (10), and Malaysia \n(9).1  As a leading economy in Asia, India should reduce this figure to 10 in 10-15 years.  \n\n    \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nB. \n \nThe highway sector has long suffered from lack of funding, weak project implementation \n6. \ncapability,  and  lack  of  clear  separation  between  policy  and  implementation  functions  of  the \nGovernment, resulting in a huge backlog of highway development and maintenance programs, \nwhich has led the Government to start reforms (Appendix 3 for the sector profile). \n \n7. \nThe  most  important  was  the  establishment  of  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India \n(NHAI) as an operating arm of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) by the \nNational Highways Authority of India Act of 1988, to develop, maintain, and manage NHs vested \nin  or  entrusted  to,  by  the  Government.  The  act  allows  NHAI  to  engage  the  private  sector  in \nhighway development and operation and maintenance (O&M) and to mobilize funds from capital \nmarkets.  NHAI does so as a government authority, not as a corporation, as NHs are a mixture \nof the public and private goods and because NH development needs public sector funds. \n \n\n                                                           \n1 Road Safety Guidelines of ADB.  \n\n\f2 \n\nSince  NHAI  started  operating  in  1995,  its  size  and  scale  of  operations  have  grown \n8. \nsignificantly. Starting with a dozen staff and capital of Rs7 billion, NHAI now has over 500 staff \nand  handles  more  than  Rs40\u2013100  billion  per  year.  NHAI's  mandate  is  to  rehabilitate  and \nupgrade  three  key  national  corridors:  the  5,800  km  Golden  Quadrilateral;  the  3,300  km  East-\nWest  (E-W)  Corridor;  and  the  4,000  km  North-South  (N-S)  Corridor  (Map,  Supplementary \nAppendix  Y).  Total  program  cost  is  estimated  at  $13  billion,  unprecedented  in  government \ninvestment in transport.  \n \n\n1.  \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n9. \nThe Government has taken steps to create it by \n \n\nImplementation of such an enormous program requires an enabling policy environment.  \n\nsimplifying the century-old land acquisition procedure by amending the National \nHighways Act in 1997; \n\nissuing  a  policy  guideline2  in  1997  to  facilitate  private  sector  participation  in \nhighway development, and implementing several key policy actions, including (a) \ngovernment  commitment  to  acquiring  land,  removing  utilities,  and  cutting  trees \nalong the right of way before land is concessioned to the private sector; and (b) \nauthorization  of  NHAI  to  extend  grants  to  private  sector  investors  up  to  40%  of \ncapital cost; \n\nadopting a policy in 1997 that, once a national highway is upgraded to four lanes, \ntolls can be collected on it; \n\nrevamping  the  central  road  fund  by  introducing  an  additional  excise  duty  levied \non petrol and diesel (\u201ccess\u201d) in 1998 and 1999 (Supplemental Appendix U); and \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\ndelegating broad decision-making authority to NHAI in 2000 so it could decide on \nindividual  investments  and  procurement  without  going  through  the  lengthy \nprocess of obtaining approval from the Public Investment Board (PIB). \n\n \n10.  While these policy actions have significantly changed NH sector management, the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  adopted  a  programmatic  approach  to  solving  remaining \nproblems.  ADB  has  set  medium-  to  long-term  goals  for  intervention  in  the  NH  subsector  and \npursues  them  in  a  progressive  and  evolutionary  manner  through  multiyear  lending  operations \nrather  than  project  by  project.  The  goals  include  (i)  strengthening  institutional  capacity  to \nimplement  projects  and  manage  contracts,  (ii)  strengthening \nfinancial \nmanagement  capability,  (iii)  enhancing  highway  operations  and  management,  (iv)  advancing \npublic-private  partnerships,  and  (v)  transforming  NHAI  into  a  financially  and  managerially \nautonomous body. \n \n11. \nNoticeable  progress  has  been  made  in  all  reform  fronts  with  ADB  assistance.    To \nimprove  project  implementation  capacity,  ADB  has  provided  two  technical  assistance  (TAs): \none3  to  enhance  NHAI\u2019s  capacity  for  social  development,  and  the  other4  to  strengthen  NHAI\u2019s \ncapacity \nresultant  strengthening  of  NHAI\u2019s  project \n                                                           \n2 MORTH. 1997.

Initiatives have been undertaken in the other areas listed in the above \npara. \n \n12. \nFinancing. To develop NHDP, NHAI has relied on a diverse array of financing sources. \nApproximately 50% of NHAI investment funding has been directly or indirectly mobilized through \nannual  contributions  from  cess.  Grants  and  loans  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies \naccount  for  an  estimated  25%  of  total  investment  funding.  The  remaining  25%  of  NHAI\u2019s \ninvestment  is  financed  through  debt  and  a  mix  of  other  mechanisms,  including  build-operate-\ntransfer  (BOT)  concessions,  build-lease-transfer  (BLT)  annuities,  and  special-purpose  vehicle \n(SPV) scheme.  \n \n13. \nHaving  started  phase  1  of  NHDP  (highway  construction),  NHAI  has  begun  phase  2 \n(development of the N-S and E-W corridors). An estimated additional Rs350 billion is required to \ndevelop 7,300 km more. Based on its projected level of borrowing and the level of funds already \ncommitted  for  investment  in  1,000-2,000  km  of  phase  2,  NHAI  could  support  an  estimated \nadditional Rs50 billion\u2013100 billion debt starting in 2005/06. Completion of the remaining 5,300-\n6,300 km of phase 2 could require financing the remaining Rs250 billion\u2013300 billion, which, in \nturn, would need a substantial increase in revenue from either cess or tolls, or their combination.  \n  \n14. \nADB should initiate policy dialogue with the Government on the future financing strategy \nfor  phase  2,  especially  the  possibility  of  increasing  the  cess  and  collecting  tolls  more \naggressively.  The  prerequisite  for  policy  dialogue  is  cash-flow  analysis  to  enable  the \nGovernment to evaluate a variety of financing scenarios and the resultant financial performance \nof  NHAI.  A  cash-flow  model  was  developed  and  preliminary  analysis  carried  out  under  the \nongoing  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  for  the  National  Highway  Corridor\u2013\nPublic-Private Partnership Project (Supplementary Appendix Z).  The analysis results are under \nreview  by  NHAI.  During  project  appraisal,  the  parties  agreed  that  the  NHAI  analysis  results \nwould  be  discussed  with  ADB  and  also  with  relevant  government  agencies  to  develop  a \nmedium-term financing strategy for phase 2.  \n \n15.  Managerial  Autonomy.  With  the  initiation  of  NHDP  program,  NHAI  has  been  able  to \nachieve  a  significant  level  of  managerial  autonomy.  With  expanded  board  membership  to \ninclude key ministerial officials from the Department of Expenditure, Planning Commission, and \nMORTH,  the  NHAI  board  has  been  able  to  exercise  broader  authorities  with  respect  to \nprocurement  and  disbursement  decisions.    However,  NHAI  is  subjected  to  several  constraints \nincluding the lack of official sanction being accorded to NHAI to retain tolls as its own revenue. \nA further review would be necessary, from a long-term perspective, on the need of establishing \nan \u201carm\u2019s length relationship\u201d between NHAI and line ministries. \n \n16. \nDifficulties  in  retaining  essential  staff  within  NHAI  should  also  be  urgently  addressed. \nAlmost all professional staff of NHAI are deputed from MORTH or from the state public works \ndepartments (PWDs) for 2 years, with a possible 3-year extension. Deputation may meet short-\nterm  construction  and  other  needs,  but  continuity  of  staff  assignment  is  critically  important  to \nfundamentally and consistently change the institution. Deputation has also weakened the results \nof capacity-building efforts made by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies. The current staffing \npractices should be assessed, and an effective staffing policy, developed so that NHAI can be \nmore  efficient  and  effective.    During  project  appraisal,  the  parties  agreed  that  the  two  issues \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nwould  be  addressed  by  the  ongoing  Institutional  Strengthening  Study  financed  by  the  World \nBank and jointly reviewed with ADB.5   \n \n17. \nOperation  and  Maintenance.  For  the  past  few  years,  NHAI  has  been  in  accelerated \nconstruction  mode  with  less  attention  being  paid  to  O&M.  As  more  highways  are  constructed \nand  placed  in  service,  O&M  is  becoming  an  increasingly  important  agenda  for  NHAI.  Newly \ncreated  assets  need  to  be  appropriately  sustained,  and  their  ROW  kept  clear,  i.e.  free  from \nencroachment. To explore possible operational approaches to best address O&M issues, NHAI \nhas  initiated  pilot  programs  for  corridor  management  units  (CMUs).6  While  CMU  approach \nneeds to be further pursued, NHAI should also start to look at the revenue earning aspect of toll \nroad  operation.  During  the  appraisal,  it  was  agreed  to  initiate  a  study  to  examine  the \norganizational  options  that  would  best  support  effective  management  and  delivery  of  NHAI\u2019s \nO&M  functions,  including  the  possibility  of  establishing  a  separate  line  of  business  for  O&M \nactivities. The study will be undertaken again as a part of the above Institutional Strengthening \nStudy (see Supplementary Appendix D for more detailed discussions on the O&M issue). \n \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  Since  1999,  NHAI  has  actively  explored  options  to \n18. \nincrease  private  sector  participation  in  highway  development.  While  it  has  been  successful  in \ninvolving the private sector in small investments in short highway sections and bypasses, NHAI \nhas  had  difficulty  attracting  larger  private  investment  in  longer  sections.  This  trend  may, \nhowever, be changing at least for the high-density traffic corridors such as Golden Quadrilateral. \nThe Delhi-Gurgaon section, a 28 km stretch of six and/or eight lanes, and the Jaipur-Kishangarh \nsection, a 98 km stretch, were recently successfully tendered as BOT schemes for $117 million \nand  $137  million,  respectively.  This  trend  is  attributable  to  (i)  increased  interest  in  highway \ndevelopment of India\u2019s financial institutions, which have devised innovative financial instruments \nsupported  by  sophisticated  risk  allocation  mechanisms;  and  (ii)  development  of  alternative \nprivate sector investment schemes including BLT annuities and SPVs. NHAI\u2019s future challenge \nis how to secure private sector participation in the less trafficked routes such as the E-W and N-\nS corridors. ADB will continue to assist this process through public sector operation and private \nsector  operation  arms  (e.g.,  an  NHAI  annuity-based  project  being  considered  under  ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations). \n \n\n2.  \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n19. \nSince  1988,  ADB  has  given  India  five  loans  for  NH  projects:  Road  Improvement  ($198 \nmillion,  1988);  Second  Road  ($250  million,  1990);  National  Highways  ($245  million,  1993); \nSurat-Manor  Tollway  Project  ($180  million,  2000);  and  Western  Transport  Corridor  ($240 \nmillion,  2001).  Implementation  of  the  first  three  were  significantly  delayed  by  operational  and \ninstitutional shortcomings, many of which have been overcome in the last two. Measures taken \nin  these  projects  include  (i)  allowing  advance  procurement  of  civil  works  and  recruitment  of \nsupervision consultants, ensuring award of contracts before loan effectiveness; (ii) establishing \nproject  implementation  units  (PIUs)  before  loan  effectiveness  and  appointment  of  key  staff  to \nprepare  the  Project  for  execution;  (iii)  removing  utilities  and  other  encumbrances  before \nconstruction  starts;  (iv)  increasing  the  size  of  contract  packages  to  attract  experienced \ninternational contractors; and (v) raising the level of authority of the independent engineer under \nthe contract to ensure efficient and quick decision making during execution. \n\n                                                           \n5  The study was financed by the World Bank. Based on the discussion between ADB, the World Bank, and NHAI, the \nstudy's scope was expanded to include the institutional reform elements ADB regards as important. The study is \nunder way, and will be jointly reviewed by ADB and the World Bank. \n\n6  Financed by two World Bank Projects: Third National Highway Project (2000) and Grand Trunk Line Project (2001). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\nIII. \n\nPROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n \nThe  overall  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  multiyear  lending  program  to  NHDP  is  to  establish  an \n20. \nenabling environment for efficient highway development and O&M with maximum private sector \nparticipation. This year\u2019s project focuses on the western half of the E-W Corridor to achieve the \nfollowing:  \n \n\nFacilitate  the  transformation  of  NHAI  into  a  lean  and  efficient  highway \nmanagement organization with stronger managerial and financial autonomy. \n\nReduce  the  capacity  constraint  on  the  E-W  Corridor  by  rehabilitating  and \nwidening highways to four lanes. \n\nPromote  public-private  partnership  by  helping  NHAI  design  and  implement  a \nBOT component. \n\n \n(iv)   Strengthen  NHAI\u2019s  capacity  to  deal  with  emerging  social  issues  such  as \ngrievance handling, stakeholder participation, communicable diseases, and road \nsafety.  \n\n \n\nB.    Components and Outputs \n \n21. \n \n\nTo achieve the objectives, the Project has the following components: \n\nInvestment.  Two-lane  highways  totaling  468.3  km  will  be  rehabilitated  and \nwidened  to  dual  two-lane  carriageways  with  various  road  safety  features \n(Supplementary Appendix E). These sections, once constructed, will be operated \nand  maintained  by  private  sector  contractors  under  O&M  agreement  to  be \nconcluded  with  NHAI.  Sections  to  be  financed  under  this  component  are:  (i) \nPorbandar  \u2013  Bhiladi  (50.5km);  (ii)  Bhiladi  \u2013  Jetpur  (64.5km);  (iii)    Bamanbore  \u2013 \nGaramore  (71.4km);  (iv)  Garamore  \u2013  Gogadhar  (106.2km);  (v)  Gogadha  \u2013 \nRadhanpur (106.2km); and (iv) Radhanpur \u2013 Deesa (85.4 km). \n\nlower \n\ntraffic  which \n\nis  significantly \n\nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  This  component  will  support  NHAI  prepare  BOT \npackage  for  identified  sections  between  Jetpur\u2013Bamanbore.  Given  the  level  of \nanticipated  volume  of \nthan  Golden \nQuadrilateral,  the  E-W  and  N-S  corridors  require  an  innovative  approach  in \ndesigning BOT packages if they are to attract an adequate level of interest from \nthe  private  sector.7  Development  of  \u201cgreen  field\u201d  components  (Jetpur-Gondal \nsection  -  26  km  highway  and  10  km  Rajkot  Bypass  section)  alone  would  not \nprovide a rate of return attractive to the private sector, but their combination with \n\u201cbrown  field\u201d  component(s)  including  four-laned  section  of  the  Gondal\u2013Rajkot \nwould  present  a  sufficiently  attractive  package  which  would  yield  a  reasonably \nhigh  rate  of  return  (see  Appendix  4  for  detailed  analysis).  Support  for  the \npreparation  of  these  packages  has  been,  and  would  continue  to  be,  provided \nunder the PPTA (which is partially funded by the Project). An agreement has also \n\n                                                           \n7    While  the  development  of  one  fifth  of  E-W  and  N-S  corridors  have  already  been  undertaken,  none  has  been \n\ndeveloped by the private sector to date. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n(iii) \n\nbeen reached with NHAI for their engagement of a financial advisor with its own \nfund (see Supplementary Appendix F for terms of reference (TOR)). \n\nCapacity Building. This component will strengthen NHAI\u2019s capacity to deal with \nemerging  social  issues:  (i)  grievance  handling,  (ii)  stakeholder  participation,  (iii) \nHIV/AIDS,8  (iv)  resettlement,  and  (v)  road  safety.  NHAI  recently  established \nwithin  it  the  Environment  and  Social  Development  Unit  (ESDU)  to  coordinate \nactivities  (i)  to  (iv).  The  general  manager  of  the  Corridor  Management  Unit  will \ncoordinate  activity  (v).  TA  will  be  provided  to  implement  these  activities.9 \nSupplementary Appendix G provides outline TOR for this TA and implementation \narrangements. The following modules will deal with the social issues: \n\n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\n \n(d) \n\n \n(e) \n\nGrievance  handling.  Training  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  NHAI\u2019s \ncapacity  to  deal  with  and  quickly  respond  to  grievances  filed  by  people \nand/or nongovernment organizations (NGOs) affected by the Project. This \nmodule was based on the lessons learned from recent inspection cases, \nwhich indicate that many of the possible cases could have been avoided \nif  the  complaints  had  been  properly  handled  early  on  by  executing \nagencies.    \n\nto  strengthen \nStakeholder  participation  module.  NHAI \ncommunication  with  key  stakeholders  through  the  recently  established \nAdvisory  Council.  NHAI  has  also  decided  to  strengthen  the  general \nconsultation  process  with  a  broader  range  of  stakeholders  to  increase \ntheir understanding of the Project and obtain feedback early on in project \npreparation.  NHAI  management  and  staff  will  be  familiarized  with  the \nconcept of stakeholder participation and best practices in participation.  \n\ntries \n\nHIV/AIDS.  NHAI  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention \ncampaigns with the help of an NGO. Activities will include field campaigns \nat  truck  parking  spaces  and  other  appropriate  locations  to  increase \nawareness of truck drivers, construction workers, sex workers, and local \nthe  risks  and  danger  of  HIV/AIDS.  HIV/AIDS \ncommunities  about \nawareness brochures will also be distributed at tollbooths. \n\nResettlement.  Resettlement  officers  and  NGO  staff  will  be  trained  to \nwork for PIUs.  \n\nRoad safety. Advisory service will be provided to develop a mechanism \nfor  a  regular  highway  patrol  system  and  emergency  medical  services \n(phase 1). The mechanism will be tested on a pilot program basis in the \nproposed  BOT  component.  Under  the  mechanism,  service  contracts  will \nbe  concluded  with  the  state  police  and  State  Medical  Department,  and \nrelevant  clauses,  drafted  and  incorporated  in  the  BOT  contract.  Building \non  the  pilot  program,  advisory  service  will  be  provided  to  explore  the \npossibility of applying a similar mechanism to NHDP highway systems on \n\n                                                           \n8 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n9  The  mission  will  seek  management\u2019s  approval  to  modify  the  scope  of  the  advisory  TA  for  the  corporate  finance \nenhancement study on reallocating the cost of phase-2 activities (which will be canceled due to the incorporation of \nphase-2 activities in the World Bank-financed study for institutional strengthening).  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\na network-wide basis. In addition, advisory service would be provided to \ndevelop  a  highway  police  system  covering  the  entire  NHAI  network \n(phase 2).   \n\n Special Feature \n\n \nC. \n \n22. \nThe programmatic approach adopts a mechanism that starts project processing when an \nagreed-on  milestone  (a  trigger  point)  is  achieved.10  During  the  2002  pre-country  programming \nmission, the project trigger point was set as substantial progress of private sector participation in \nhighway development. The Fact-Finding Mission of May 2002 reviewed the project trigger point \nand found that substantial progress had been made in private sector participation. In the last 3 \nyears,  NHAI  introduced  six  BOT  projects,  eight  annuity-based  concession  projects,  and  one \nSPV,  which,  combined,  accounted  for  14%  of  the  length  of  the  Golden  Quadrilateral  \n(Supplementary Appendix H, para. 18). The Mission then began to process the Project.  \n \nD.  \n \n23. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $575.8 million equivalent, including allowances for \ncontingencies and interest during construction. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $376.9 \nmillion,  representing  65.4%  of  the  total  cost,  while  the  local  currency  costs  are  estimated  at \n$198.9 million equivalent, representing 34.6% (Table 1 and Appendix 5).  \n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n1.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \n\nfor the Western Transport Corridor.  Manila. para. 31. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nE. \n \n24. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $320  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0%,  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice \nfrom ADB. \n \nThe Government will cover the foreign currency cost of $27.8 million to cover the front-\n25. \nend-fee and the interest during construction. The Government will also cover the local currency \ncost  equivalent  to  $182.9  million.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  made  available  by  the \nGovernment  to  NHAI  promptly  as  required  for  the  purposes  of  the  Project.  The  Government\u2019s \ncurrent policy of assistance to NHAI for Golden Quadrilateral in this regard is a loan-grant ratio \nof  20:80,  and  for  this  Project,  that  forms  part  of  the  E-W  Corridor,  PIB  clearance  has  already \nbeen  given  in  a  loan-grant  ratio  of  20:80  on  which  a  cabinet  decision  is  expected  soon.  The \nGovernment  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  of  the  loan.  Civil  works  between  Jetpur  and \nGondal section and Rajkot Bypass section of the Project will be carried out under BOT scheme. \nThe  cost  for  the  works,  $45.1  million  equivalent,  will  be  covered  by  a  private  concessionaire. \nThe detailed financing plan is provided in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \nSource \n \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nPrivate Sector \n \n \n\nTotal \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n320.0 \n27.8 \n29.1 \n\n376.9 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n \n0.0 \n  182.9 \n16.0 \n \n \n  198.9 \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n  320.0 \n  210.7 \n45.1 \n \n \n  575.8 \n\n \nPercentage\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n56% \n37% \n8% \n\n100% \n\n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\n Implementation Arrangements \n\n \nF. \n \n \n \nNHAI will be the Executing Agency for the Project (Supplementary Appendix I for NHAI\u2019s \n26. \norganization).  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  two  specially  created  PIUs,  which  will  be \nlocated in Rajkot for the sections between Porbandar and Samakhiyali, and in Palanpur for the \nsections between Samakhiyali and Deesa.  PIUs should be adequately staffed, which should be \ncompleted within two months of loan effectiveness, and in any case, prior to the award of civil \nworks contracts under the Project, whichever is earlier. Two general manager level staff will be \nassigned  as  project  directors,  one  for  each  PIU,  who  would  be  assisted  by  three/four  deputy \ngeneral  managers  or  managers,  each  responsible  for  one  contract  package  or  a  BOT \ncomponent. An additional deputy general manager or manager would be assigned for each of \nthe  PIU  for  overseeing  resettlement  activities  and  also  handling  grievances  to  be  filed  by  the \npublic  including  project  affected  persons  and  NGOs.

The  activities  of  the  PIUs  will  be  overseen  by  the \nChairperson  of  NHAI  who  will  be  assisted  by  a  chief  general  manager  in-charge  of  the  E-W \nCorridor  development.  Sufficient  administrative  authority  will  be  delegated  to  the  PIUs  for \neffective  and  timely  implementation  of  the  Project.  Supplementary  Appendix  J  gives  the \norganization structure of PIUs. \n \n \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  48  months,  inclusive  of  procurement  and \n27. \npreconstruction, and is expected to be completed by 30 June 2006. The schedule will allow for \nland acquisition and resettlement and clearance of all utilities, trees, and any other obstructions \nfrom the land to be used for construction. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.   \n \n \n \n28. \nCivil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement \nfollowing  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Civil  works  will  be  divided  into  six \npackages.  The  contract  packages  ($47  million\u201388  million)  are  large  enough  to  attract  capable \ncontractors  with  international  experience.  A  list  of  contract  packages  and  the  mode  of \nprocurement are in Appendix 7. To expedite procurement, in July 2002 ADB approved advance \naction  for  prequalification.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  this  approval  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n \n \n29. \nGiven the length of project highways, NHAI decided to engage two consulting firms as \nproject engineers to ensure adequate construction supervision of civil works. With the expanded \npower of the engineer, as adopted in the Western Transport Corridor Project, NHAI will continue \nto  ensure  objective  and  transparent  processing  of  contract  variations.  NHAI  will  also  engage \nanother consulting firm of similar function for the BOT component. NHAI will engage these three \nconsulting  firms  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  for  full  technical  proposals  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. Summary TOR \nfor  these  services  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K.  Consultant  inputs  will  consist  of  3,414 \nperson-months  (447  for  international  and  2,967  for  domestic)  with  an  estimated  cost  of  $18.4 \nmillion.  \n \n \n \n30. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001) and Interim Guidelines for Disbursement, Operations; LIBOR-Based \nLoan  Products  (July  2002),  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  using  direct  payment.  To  facilitate \nproject  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  funds,  an  imprest  account  may  be \nestablished  by  the  Government  with  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India.  The  imprest  account  will  be \nmanaged,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nThe  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  is  not  to  exceed  estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. Any individual \npayment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement-of-expenditures  method  for \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures for consulting services will not exceed the equivalent of \n$300,000. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n5. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n \n31. \nNHAI will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify works, goods, and \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds;  financing  resources  received;  expenditures  incurred \nfor  the  Project;  and  local  funds.  The  project  accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles.  \n \n32. \nNHAI\u2019s  accounting  system  has  been  established  in  accordance  with  government \nrequirements, and its financial statements are prepared in a format prescribed by the Controller \nand  Auditor  General  of  India  who  audits  NHAI's  financial  statements  annually  (Supplementary \nAppendix L). As a public sector authority, NHAI\u2019s accounting system generally adheres to basic \ncommercial  accounting  practices  commonly  employed  in  India  and  is  in  accordance  with \ngenerally  accepted  accounting  practices  (GAAP)  of  India.  Accrual  accounting  is  used, \ntransactions  are  recorded  on  a  historical  cost  basis,  and  a  balance  sheet  and  a  profit-and-loss \nstatement  are  annually  prepared  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  M  for  financial  statements  of \nNHAI). \n \n33. \nNHAI operates as an agent of the Government with primary responsibility for developing \nNHs. Road infrastructure is vested or entrusted from the Government to NHAI but not recorded \nsince no value is attached to the infrastructure. On the balance sheet, nonrecurrent expenditures \nfor  road  improvement  are  shown  as  work  in  progress  until  completion.  An  accounting  policy  to \nconvert these works in progress into fixed assets in the books has yet to be determined. \n \n34. \nNHAI\u2019s  primary  source  of  reported  revenue  is  the  management  fee  received  from  the \nGovernment in return for completing the entrusted works. Toll revenues are not treated as NHAI \nincome  but  as  accounts  payable  to  the  Government.  Interest  received  on  unused  advances  is \nnot treated as NHAI income but recognized as a capital surplus or an increase to capital. As of \nFY2001,  the  main  differences  between  NHAI  accounting  practices  and  statement  presentation, \nand GAAP of India are detailed in the notes to the financial statements.  \n \n35. \nAn independent auditor satisfactory to ADB will annually audit NHAI project accounts and \nfinancial  statements.  The  audited  project  accounts  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  6 \nmonths  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  to  which  the  accounts  relate,  and  the  audited  financial \nstatements,  not  later  than  9  months.  The  annual  audit  of  the  project  account  should  cover  the \nimprest  account  and  statement-of-expenditure  procedure.  During  the  Appraisal  Mission,  NHAI \nwas made aware of ADB\u2019s policy on delayed submission and the importance of satisfactory and \nacceptable  quality  of  the  audited  reports.  NHAI  has  appointed  M/s  Price  Waterhouse  Coopers, \nIndia,  as  its  internal  auditors  effective  for  FY2002.  As  part  of  the  assignment,  the  company  is \nrequired to advise on accounting policies and practices and internal control procedures, conduct \na  100%  post-audit  of  all  transactions,  and  certify  NHAI\u2019s  statements  of  expenditures  to  be \nsubmitted to funding agencies.  \n \n36. \nproject completion, NHAI will provide ADB with a project completion report. \n \n \n \n37.  With  help  from  the  supervision  consultants,  NHAI  will  monitor  and  evaluate  project \nperformance  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management  System  Handbook. \nPrimary monitoring indicators to be used by NHAI and reported to ADB will be (i) percentage of \nroads  without  discernable  congestion,  to  measure  capacity  expansion;  (ii)  international \n\nNHAI  will  provide  quarterly  reports  to  ADB  on  project  execution.  Three  months  after \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n7. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nroughness index, to measure the riding quality of the project roads; (iii) travel time, to measure \nincreased  efficiency  for  passenger  transport;  (iv)  freight  for  trucking  service,  to  measure \nreduction  in  transport  costs;  (v)  traffic  fatalities,  to  measure  increased  road  safety;  and  (vi) \nlength  of  highway  sections  to  be  developed  by  the  private  sector,  to  measure  the  extent  of \nprivate sector participation. \n \n38. \nInitial and target values for each indicator, together with the methodologies for compiling \ndata, are in Supplementary Appendix N. Similar set of performance monitoring indicators will be \nused for all NHAI projects to be financed by ADB under the programmatic approach. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Supervision and Review \n\n  \nSoon after the loan approval of the Project, a project inception mission will be fielded to \n39. \nstart  project  implementation.  The  Government  and  NHAI  will  periodically  review  the  Project  to \nassess and evaluate its scope, implementation arrangements (with participation of local NGOs \nand  community),  benefit  monitoring,  progress,  and  achievement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProject Performance Management Systems Handbook. NHAI and ADB will undertake a midterm \nproject  review  in  May  2004  to  (i)  evaluate  the  project  scope,  design,  and  implementation \narrangements;  (ii)  identify  changes  needed  since  project  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  implementation \nperformance  against  project  performance  indicators;  (iv)  review  resettlement  operations;  (v) \nreview and establish compliance with the legal covenants; (vi) identify problems and constraints; \nand (vii) if necessary, recommend changes in project design or implementation. If the midterm \nreview concludes that project implementation should be changed, NHAI and ADB will agree on \nappropriate  measures,  including  changes  in  implementation  arrangements,  to  ensure  that \nproject objectives are met. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nSocial Aspects  \n\n \nC. \n \n40. \nAn  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation. \nParticipatory processes were applied, including consultation with local communities and persons \naffected  by  the  Project  about  the  proposed  highway  improvements.  The  communities  were \nsupportive  of  the  Project  owing  to  its  significant  economic  benefits  and  road  safety  features \nincorporated  in  highway  design.  Scheduled  tribes  live  in  the  project  areas.  A  preliminary \nassessment report on indigenous people indicated that the Project will not specifically impact on \nscheduled  tribes.  As  scheduled  tribes  living  in  the  project  areas  are  already  integrated  into \nmainstream  communities,  a  separate  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  was  not  required. \nAs a vulnerable group, however, STs will receive special assistance under the resettlement plan \nDuring the Fact-Finding Mission, a summary poverty reduction and social strategy was prepared \n(Appendix 8). \n \n \n \nThe existing right of way of the project highways is generally 45 m except for NH14 and \n41. \nNH15,  which  have  60  m  rights  of  way.  The  proposed  four-lane  highways  comprise  7  m \nsegregated carriageway divided by medians of varying widths and, on the average, 2 X 1.5 m \npaved shoulder. Highway improvement will be carried out within the existing right of way except \nfor minor realignments and two bypasses. Therefore, new land acquisition will be minimal and \nconfined  largely  to  construction  of  bypasses  in  Ranavav  and  Upleta.  An  estimated  364  ha  of \nland will be acquired, half of which are privately owned (mainly agricultural), and the remainder, \n\nResettlement  \n\n1. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n(informal  settlers,  SBEs,  and  agricultural \n\ngovernment-owned uncultivated wasteland. Land acquisition will likely affect 308 households, of \nwhich  only  about  25  may  require  relocation;  the  rest  will  lose  only  agricultural  plots.  Land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  were  minimized  by  (i)  keeping  the  improvement  works \nwithin  the  right  of  way,  (ii)  adopting  asymmetrical  widening,  (iii)  elevating  carriageways  over \ngraveyard  and/or  cultural  sites,  and  (iv)  constructing  bypasses  to  avoid  congested  urban \nsettlements.  \n \n42. \nThe census/socioeconomic surveys carried out in May 2002 generated a full inventory of \nlosses  by  affected  persons  for  relocation  assistance  and  other  relocation  purposes  (Appendix \n9). In all, 2,526 households/businesses (13,064 persons) will be affected, but the impact will be \nlargely limited to the roadside squatters/informal settlers and small business enterprises (SBE). \nOf  all  affected  units \nfamilies),  68%  are \nbusiness/commercial enterprises. Owners of SBEs are \u201cillegal\u201d occupants of right-of-way land. \nAn estimated 1,000 informal households/SBEs will require relocation. Most informal settlers are \nsmall business owners and vendors and, therefore, considered vulnerable.  \n \nAffected  persons  will  suffer  loss  of  (i)  agricultural  land,  crops,  and  trees;  (ii) \n43. \nbusiness/residential  structures;  (iii)  business/employment;  (iv)  income,  temporarily;  and  (v) \naccess to right of way to income-generating and livelihood sources.  Compensation for land and \nother  assets  will  be  paid  at  replacement/market  value.  The  entitlement  matrix  recognizes  all \ntypes  of  affected  persons  irrespective  of  ownership  status.  The  matrix  identifies  the  affected \npersons and losses, and defines compensation and entitlements. The resettlement plan aims to \nrestore  and  improve  the  economic  conditions  of  affected  persons,  particularly  vulnerable \ngroups,  through  a  variety  of  programs,  including  training  for  alternative  income.  The \nresettlement  plan  is  guided  by  the  ADB  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  as  well  as  NHAI \npolicies and practices related to resettlement in ongoing ADB-funded projects. \n \n44. \nTwo  resettlement  sites  have  been  identified  in  Rajkot  and  Thara  in  consultation  with \naffected persons and local administration. In Rajkot, about 400 informal residential units will be \nresettled  and  provided  basic  amenities.  In  Thara,  affected  units  are  largely  SBEs\u2014over  600 \nshops. They will be rehabilitated in the adjacent new market centers to be built by the Project.  \nEncroachers\u2014private  owners  who  have  extended  their  property  on  the  right  of  way\u2014will  be \nnotified  to  remove  their  structures  before  civil  works  commence  and  allowed  to  salvage \nmaterials from the demolished structures. However, vulnerable families in this category will be \nhelped  on  a  case-by-case  basis  to  improve  their  incomes,  and  compensated  at  replacement \ncost  for  their  lost  assets.  Female-headed  households  will  receive  additional  assistance  for \nrelocation  and/or  income  restoration.  Ongoing  poverty-reduction  programs  to  rehabilitate  child \nworkers will target the families of child laborers in SBEs.  \n \n45. \nNHAI made copies of the draft resettlement plan available to affected persons and other \nstakeholders  (e.g.,  block  development  officer  and  district  commissioner\u2019s  office)  in  the  project \narea on 2 July 2002 in English and on 9 July 2002 in Gujarati. NHAI conducted two workshops \nin  the  project  area  to  inform  affected  persons,  and  discuss  and  review  their  comments,  which \nwere later incorporated in the revised resettlement plan. To avoid an influx of informal dwellers \nand  fraudulent  claims  during  implementation,  NHAI  will  issue  photo  identification  cards  to  all \nidentified owners of residential structures and shops (including employees) by March 2003. To \nfacilitate timely and effective implementation of the resettlement plan, NHAI has agreed to hire \nNGOs  within  2  months  after  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  Project.  The  estimated  resettlement \ncost for the Project, including NGO services, will be Rs434 million.     \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\nVarious  stakeholders  consulted  during  the  project  preparation  include  (i)  heads  of \n46. \nhouseholds  and/or  businesses  to  be  affected,  (ii)  affected  persons  in  small  groups,  (iii)  village \npanchayat  (elected  council  at  village  level)  members  and  sarpanch  (village  head),  (iv)  local \nvoluntary organizations and NGOs, (v) government agencies and departments; and (vi) women \nand  other  vulnerable  groups.  NHAI  will  depute  resettlement  officers  to  PIUs  to  supervise \nresettlement plan implementation work by NGOs, which will be selected by ESDU.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCommunicable Disease \n\n \n47. \nHIV/AIDS  are  major  development  challenges.  According  to  the  National  AIDS  Control \nOrganization  (NACO),  India  had  close  to  4  million  people  with  HIV/AIDS  in  2001,  or  less  than \n1% of the adult population. However, HIV could infect at least 5% of the adult population (over \n37 million) by 2005 if no effective preventive measures are taken. The Government has shown \nincreasing  commitment  to  HIV/AIDS  control,  and  established  a  consortium-like  collaboration \nwith  external  aid  agencies  to  provide  technical  and  financial  assistance  to  NACO  to  help \nimplement national HIV/AIDS policies.  \n \n48. \nGujarat's HIV/AIDS  incidence is sixth after that of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnakata, \nAndhra  Pradesh,  and  Manipur.  However,  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  risks  is  low  in  Gujarat:  only \n22.7%  of  rural  women  in  Gujarat  (against  72.5%  among  rural  women  nationally)  are  aware  of \nHIV/AIDS risks.11 Clearly, awareness must be raised in the state.  \n \n49. \nTruck drivers and construction laborers spread sexually transmitted diseases. HIV/AIDS \nis  thus  a  possible  negative  impact  of  highway  construction.  Under  the  Project,  an  information \nand  education  campaign  on  the  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  will  be  conducted  by  a  qualified  NGO  and \ntarget  construction  workers  at  campsites,  truck  drivers  at  truck  stops  (dhabas),  and  local \ncommunities  along  project  highways,  particularly  rural  women.  The  NGO  will  form  local  AIDS \nawareness groups and work closely with the relevant state agencies (particularly Gujarat State \nAIDS Control Society) and other existing networks dedicated to the prevention of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n50.  While an improved network would contribute to economic growth, more roads have also \nbrought in their wake more accidents: 5% annual increase for the last two decades, with 90,000 \nfatalities in 2001, 40% of which on NHs. About 50\u201360% of road traffic accidents involve heavy \ncommercial vehicles such as trucks and buses (Supplementary Appendix O).  \n \n51. \nThe  Project  has  several  road  safety  features,  including  provisions  for  overpass  and \nunderpass  at  necessary  locations,  with  particular  attention  to  rural  areas  so  that  farm  families \ncan  safely  move  their  herds.  Right-of-way  management,  alternative  markets  for  roadside \nvendors,  and  provision  for  bus  and  truck  stops  will  address  safety  issues.  Road  improvement \nplans will include traffic management features such as signs, markings, streetlights, guard rails, \ncrosswalks, intersection layout and control, and provisions for different types of road users.  \n \nAt  various  stages  of  project  design  and  implementation,  road  safety  audits  will  identify \n52. \npotential road safety hazards and design defects, which can be redressed by improving design \nand  other  engineering  measures.  Road  safety  audit  will  be  combined  with  other  ongoing \n\n                                                           \n11  Awareness  rates  were  highest  in  Kerala  (96.4%),  Goa  (92.4%),  and  Andhra  Pradesh  (90.6%).  See  HIV/AIDS \n\nIndian Scenario\u2014Executive Summary, NACO, 2001.  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nprojects  (SMT  and  WTC).    Necessary  costs  will  be  financed  out  of  loan  proceeds  of  the  SMT \nProject (see Supplementary Appendix P for outline TOR for road safety audit). \n \n\n4. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n \n Poverty in Gujarat is significantly less severe than in the rest of India,12 with 14.1% of \n53. \nthe  population  below  the  poverty  line.  In  1993\u20132000,  Gujarat  achieved  higher-than-average \neconomic growth of 7.2% per year, reducing poverty slightly faster than the national average.13 \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  stimulate  the  state\u2019s  economic  growth,  which  will,  in  turn,  reduce \npoverty (Supplementary Appendix Q). \n  \n54. \nImproved  road  networks  will  increase  long-term  economic  opportunities  of  rural \ncommunities  by  (i)  enabling  villagers  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to  market-oriented \nagricultural surplus production; and (ii) helping local people, particularly the youth, move out of \ntheir  communities  to  work  at  better-paid  jobs  in  manufacturing  or  trading.  The  Project  will \nprovide social benefits such as improved access to health, education, and social services. The \nProject  will  have  a  short-term  poverty  reduction  impact  as  the  rural  poor  are  hired  for \nconstruction,  tree  planting,  and  ensuing  maintenance  works.  These  opportunities  will  directly \nincrease earnings for the poor largely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment. \n \nADB\u2019s  road  projects  are  intended  to  assist  the  Government\u2019s  overall  efforts  to  improve \n55. \nthe  entire  road  network  consisting  of  national,  state,  and  rural  roads.  The  Government\u2019s  road \ndevelopment  policy  is  comprehensive  with  an  aim  to  establish  total  connectivity  with  highest \npriority being accorded to the rural road segment. Thus ADB intends to provide lending not only \nto  the  national  highway  segment,  but  also  to  state  roads  from  this  year  on,  and  also  to  rural \nroads from the next year on.  \n \n56. \n The  proposed  506  km  highway  improvement  will  pass  through  approximately  170 \nvillages and 12 urban areas. Community assessment surveys on poverty impact carried out in \nJune  2002  revealed  that  project  area  residents  generally  perceive  a  positive  linkage  between \npoverty  reduction  and  highway  improvement.  The  survey  also  revealed  that  20%  of  workers, \nmany of whom are agricultural laborers, were employed an average distance of 9 km from their \nvillages.  Improved  mobility  would  provide  these  workers  with  better-paying  jobs  outside  the \nvillages,  including  in  towns.  Respondents  also  indicated  that  the  Project  would  improve  public \ntransport  services  and  possibly  make  them  cheaper  and  faster,  which  would  directly  benefit \nagricultural  laborers  working  outside  their  villages.  Nearly  half  the  respondents  felt  that \nincreased mobility would facilitate their access to educational and medical facilities.  \n  \nB. \n \nThe  Project  is  classified  under  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \n57. \nexamination  (IEE)  report  was  prepared  by  NHAI  consultants  and  submitted  to  ADB  in  June \n2002. The IEE findings indicate that the Project will not have significant adverse environmental \nimpacts as it will upgrade existing highways and be executed primarily within existing rights of \nway.  Cultural/heritage  areas,  protected  areas,  wetlands,  and  other  environmentally  sensitive \nareas  will  not  be  disturbed.  A  summary  IEE  was  prepared  (Appendix  10).  The  Project  will \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n                                                           \n12 26.1% being defined as below the poverty line. \n13 During these 6 years, poverty has gone down by 10.2% in Gujarat, while the national average has gone down by \n9.9%. During the same period, state gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.2%, faster than the national average \nof 6.4%.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\nEconomic Assessment \n\ncomply  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects  (1993)  and \nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank (1998). \n \n58. \nThe environmental management and monitoring plan is sufficiently detailed to help NHAI \nand  contractors  mitigate  the  Project's  potential  environmental  impacts.  The  plan  summarized \nthe  mitigation  proposals  and  allocated  responsibilities,  including  implementation,  testing,  and \nmonitoring during construction and operation.  \n    \nC. \n \n59. \nProject economic evaluation is based on the comparison of scenarios with and without \nthe Project. Economic costs and benefits are compared in constant value. The economic costs \nwere  computed  using  the  financial  costs.  Project  benefits  were  computed  based  on  reduced \nvehicle  operating  costs  due  to  improved  road  quality  and  capacity.  Vehicle  cost  savings  were \ncomputed using Highway Design and Maintenance Model \u2013 IV (HDM-IV) modified for India. The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated for the Project as a whole, as well as for \neach  of  the  11  roadway  sections.  The  project  EIRR  is  22.0%,  and  section  EIRRs  were  14.8\u2013\n30.4%.  \n  \n60. \nA  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  EIRR  has  been  undertaken  for  changes  in  the  underlying \ncost-and-benefit parameters. Under the worst-case scenario of a simultaneous 15.0% increase \nin  project  costs  and  a  15.0%  reduction  in  project  benefits,  the  overall  EIRR  is  estimated  at \n18.8%. A possible 1-year delay in project implementation would bring down the EIRR to 20.9%  \n(Supplementary Appendix R). \n \nD. \n \n61. \nA  financial  analysis  of  the  Project  was  also  undertaken  to  assess  the  projected  toll \nrevenues generated from the traffic on project highways against the construction cost to widen \nthe  road,  and  the  annual  costs  for  road  operations  and  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance \nover 30 years.  \n \nRevenue projections are based on traffic forecasts, which use as a baseline the average \n62. \nof  recent  traffic  counts  and  an  extrapolation  of  past  counts.  Separate  growth  rates  were \ncomputed for each type of vehicle. Growth rates vary for passenger vehicles from 6% to 10%, \nand  for  medium-weight  to  heavy  trucks,  from  6%  to  10%,  with  the  proportion  of  traffic  that \nshould and does pay tolls assumed at 75%. Total construction costs are expected to be incurred \nover 33 months, with construction completed and traffic tolls initiated by mid-2006.   \n \n63. \ncalculated at 8.2 %, above NHAI\u2019s 4.2% weighted average cost of capital in real terms.  \n \nE. \n \n A potential risk to the Project is the possible delay in implementation due to prolonged \n64. \nland acquisition. However, the need for land acquisition is limited except for the two bypasses, \ngrade separations, and realignments along the existing routes tolling 37 km or 7% of the total \nproject highways. Land required for service roads and drainage lines is mostly available within \nthe  right  of  way.  Land  acquisition  procedures  introduced  in  1997  by  the  amended  National \nHighways  Act  will  minimize  the  risk  of  implementation  delay.  The  new  procedures  will  enable \nNHAI to proceed with land acquisition expeditiously and predictably (Supplementary Appendix \n\nBased  on  the  above  assumptions,  the  project  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nPotential Risks \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nS). NHAI assured the Mission that land necessary for commencement of construction activities \nwill be acquired by June 2003.  \n \n65. \nResettlement can also potentially delay implementation. To facilitate timely and effective \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan,  NHAI  will  hire  NGOs  and  depute \nresettlement  officers  in  the  PIUs.  Mobilizing  the  implementing  NGOs  within  2  months  of  ADB \nBoard approval of the Project will minimize the risk of delayed compensation. The NGO staff will \ndedicate  their  time  to  processing  and  resolving  all  resettlement  problems.  Coordination \nmechanisms  will  be  established  at  the  district  level  to  resolve  any  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement issues that may arise.  \n\n \nV.    ASSURANCES \n\nThe Government and NHAI have given the following specific assurances, in addition to \n\n \n66. \nthe standard assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA. \n \n\nGeneral \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  budgetary  allocations,  counterpart \nfunds (including additional funds as required in case of revisions to resettlement \nplans) and staff are made available in a timely manner for the efficient and timely \nimplementation of the Project. \n\nB.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  timely  administrative  clearances  as  required  by \nNHAI for the speedy implementation of the Project. \n \n\n \nThe  Borrower  will  ensure  that  NHAI  is  continued  to  be  delegated  with  sufficient \nadministrative  and  financial  authority  for  the  expeditious  implementation  of \nprocurement and disbursement under the Project. \n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  the  Project  Implementation  Units  (PIUs)  are  adequately \nstaffed  by  experienced  personnel  at  both  managerial  and  professional  levels \nduring the entire period of the Project implementation. The PIUs will be headed \nby a Project Director. The activities of PIU will be overseen by the Chairperson of \nthe NHAI who would be assisted by a chief general manager.  \n\nC.

Its  key  components  are  (i)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  Golden \nQuadrilateral, approximately 6,000 kilometers (km) of highway network, slated to be completed \nby the end of 2003; and (ii) the rehabilitation and upgrading of the North-South (N-S; 4,000 km) \nand East-West (E-W; 3,300 km) corridors, which are to be completed by the end of 2007. NHDP \nis expected to cost $13 billion for 10 years (1998-2007). \n \n2. \nDuring  the  1998  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  a  series  of  loans  for  the  Golden  Quadrilateral.  ADB \nextended  two  loans,  for  the  Surat-Manor  Tollway  Project  (2000)  and  the  Western  Transport \nCorridor  Project  (2001).  During  the  2000  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government \nrequested extension of assistance to develop the E-W and N-S corridors. The proposed loan is \nADB's third to NHDP and the first to the E-W and N-S corridors.   \n \n3. \nProject preparatory technical assistance for the above project was approved in October \n2001,  and  the  consultant  team  was  fielded  to  India  in  May  2002  to  help  National  Highways \nAuthority  of  India  (NHAI)  consultants  conduct  the  feasibility  study,  focusing  on  ensuring  the \nNHAI  consultants'  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  In  May-June  2002,  the  ADB  Fact-\nFinding  Mission  reviewed  the  technical,  institutional,  economical,  financial,  environmental,  and \nsocial  viability  of  the  Project.    The  Appraisal  Mission  was  sent  to  India  in  August-September \n2002 to finalize project evaluation. \n \n4. \nIn assisting NHDP, ADB has adopted a programmatic approach to achieve its medium- \nto long-term goals in a progressive and evolutionary manner. The medium- to long-term goals \nset out in the Report and Recommendation of the President on the Western Transport Corridor \nProject are (i) transform NHAI into a managerially and financially autonomous body, (ii) enhance \nfinancial  management  and  planning  capability,  (iii)  strengthen  institutional  capacity  for  project \nimplementation  and  highway  operations  and  management  (O&M),  (iv)  institute  a  transparent \ncorporate governance, and (v) advance public-private partnerships.  \n \n5. \nA key element of this approach is a specific milestone that would trigger the next project \n(a  trigger  point).1  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  reviewed  recent  private  sector  participation  in \ndevelopment  and  O&M,  a  trigger  point  agreed  on  during  the  2002  pre-country  programming \nmission.  The  Mission  found  that  substantial  progress  had  been  made  in  quantity  and  quality. \nNHAI  introduced  six  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  projects,  eight  annuity-based  concession \nprojects, and one special-purpose vehicle during the last 3 years, which accounted for 14% of \nthe Golden Quatrilateral's length. Two are large-scale BOT projects: Delhi-Gurgaon (28 km, six \nand or eight lanes, $117 million); and Jaipur-Kishangarh (98 km, four lanes, $137 million). This \ndevelopment is major progress, since NHAI has experienced difficulties in attracting the private \nsector to invest in large-scale BOT projects. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \n\nfor the Western Transport Corridor Project. Manila,  para. 31.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS, GOVERNMENT STRATEGY, AND SECTOR PROFILE \n\nGovernment Sector Strategy \n\n \n1. \nIndia has an extensive and diverse transport system of about 3.4 million kilometers (km) \nof  road;  63,028  km  of  rail;  12  major  and  139,182  minor  and  or  intermediate  ports;  4  major \ninternational airports; 86 domestic airports; and about 14,500 km of navigable inland waterway. \nThe  ratio  of  road  to  rail  transport  has  been  continuously  shifting  as  demand  for  transport \nservices changes. Road transport now accounts for over 60% of freight movement and 80% of \npassenger traffic, with rail transport accounting for much of the remainder. A profile of transport \nin India is in Supplementary Appendix V. \n \nA. \n \nFaced with chronic capacity shortage on major arterial links, the Government decided to \n2. \nundertake  the  radical  National  Highways  Development  Program  (NHDP)  to  upgrade  key \nnational highway (NH) corridors, especially the Golden Quadrilateral, approximately 6,000 km of \nhighway  network  connecting  four  major  metropolitan  areas  (Delhi,  Mumbai,  Chennai,  and \nKolkata)  and  slated  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2003.  NHDP  will  also  upgrade  the  North-\nSouth (4,000 km) and East-West (3,300 km) corridors, to be completed by the end of 2007.1 All \nthese  corridors  are  to  be  upgraded  to  a  minimum  four-lane  standard.  NHDP  also  includes \nupgrading  access  to  major  ports  under  the  Port  Connectivity  Project.  Once  NHDP  is \nimplemented,  the  focus  will  shift  to  construction  of  a  national  expressway  network  and \nrehabilitation of parts of the NH network not included in NHDP. \n \n3. \nConstruction costs for NHDP are estimated at $13 billion. To finance the program, NHAI \nintends  to  raise  $4.4  billion  through  a  levy  on  petrol  and  diesel,  $2.7  billion  through  financial \nmarkets, $1.4 billion through private sector participation in the Project, and the remaining $4.4 \nbillion  through  external  assistance.  The  Government\u2019s  strategies  include  revamping  the  road \nfund  for  development,  issuing  domestic  bonds  to  tap  India\u2019s  capital  markets,  engaging  the \nprivate sector to develop the road network, and using international and bilateral assistance. \n \nB. \n \n \n \n4. \nTransport planning, coordination, and policy setting at the central government level are \nhandled  by  several  line  ministries,  with  overall  coordination  by  the  Planning  Commission.  The \nMinistry  of  Surface  Transport,  was  reorganized  in  November  2000  into  the  Ministry  of  Road \nTransport  and  Highways  (MORTH)  and  Ministry  of  Shipping  (MOS).  MORTH\u2019s  duties  are  to \ndevelop  and  maintain  NHs,  and  formulate  road  transport  policies.  MORTH  coordinates  state \nroads and issues guidelines on highway planning, design, and construction. MOS is responsible \nfor  major  ports,  inland  water  transport,  and  shipping.  All  railway  planning  and  operations  are \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Railways.  The  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  is  responsible  for  policy \ndevelopment,  monitoring,  and  coordination  of  rural  roads  being  funded  by  the  Central  Road \nFund (CRF). Airports and civil aviation are the responsibility of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. \n \n5. \nThe  responsibility  for  developing  and  maintaining  the  NH  system  rests  with  the  central \nGovernment,  while  state  and  district  roads  are  the  responsibility  of  the  state  governments.  To \nseparate  its  planning  and  operational  functions,  the  Government  established  NHAI  in  1988  to \ndevelop  and  maintain  NHs.  NHAI\u2019s  responsibilities  include  the  Golden  Quadrilateral,  North-\n\nTransport Planning and Coordination \n\nSector Profile \n\n1.  \n\n                                                 \n1 The original target of 2009 was recently revised to 2007. \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\n2. \n\n         23 \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nRoad Network and Traffic \n\nVehicle Fleet and Road Transport Industries \n\nThe NH network of 58,122 km carries about 40% of total road traffic. However, 39% of \n\n \n \nSouth  and  East-West  corridors,  and  several  links  to  major  ports  and  industrial  centers.  NHAI \ncovers one fourth of the NH network length, and MORTH is responsible for the rest. \n \n \n \n6. \nThe road network is divided into (i) NHs, (ii) state highways and major district roads, and \n(iii)  other  district  roads  and  rural  roads  (Supplementary  Appendix  T).  The  national  and  state \nhighways  facilitate  mobility,  while  the  district  and  rural  roads  provide  much-needed  means  to \nmeet social needs and to transport agricultural produce to markets. The road network grew by \n7.5  times,  from  400,000  km  in  1951  to  3.4  million  km  in  2001  (including  230,000  km  of  urban \nroads).  Road  density  is  now  1  km  per  square  km,  which  is  higher  than  in  other  developing \ncountries,  but  the  length,  quality,  and  capacity  of  the  road  network  are  grossly  inadequate  to \nmeet present and future demand for freight transport and passenger traffic. \n \n7. \nthis network is still single lane, 58% two lane, and only 3% four lane. \n \n8. \nFrom 1990 to 2000, annual passenger road transport grew at 7.8%, and freight transport \nby 7.6%, which was higher than the growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) (6%). By \n2001,  passenger  traffic  was  expected  to  reach  about  3,000  billion  passenger-km,  and  freight \ntraffic, 800 billion ton-km. \n \n3. \n \nIndia  had  300,000  vehicles  in  1950/51,  and  around  50  million  in  1999/00.  Buses \n9. \naccounted  for  1%;  trucks,  5%;  cars  and  jeeps,  13%;  and  motorcycles  and  scooters  (two-\nwheelers), 71%. The rest were mostly auto-rickshaws (three-wheelers) and agricultural tractors. \nThe  number  of  automobiles  has  been  growing  at  approximately  9%  a  year,  and  heavy \ncommercial vehicles, at 7.5% over the last 9 years. \n \n10. \nIndia\u2019s  automobile  manufacturing  industry  has  been  regulated  since  independence.  In \n1947, the Government declared that only indigenous firms operating according to an approved \nplan could manufacture motor vehicles. A vehicle manufacturing industry was established using \ndomestic capital and little foreign technology. Deregulation started with two-wheelers in the mid-\n1980s, then passenger cars and commercial vehicles in the 1990s to encourage production of \nmore  fuel-efficient,  safer,  and  better-quality  vehicles  at  reasonable  prices.  In  1999/2000,  4.8 \nmillion  motor  vehicles  were  manufactured  in  India,  156%  over  the  1992/93  level,  due  to  the \nunprecedented increase in manufacturing of two- and three-wheeler vehicles from 1.5 million to \n3.9 million. \n \n \n \n11. \nThe  private  sector  almost  wholly  operates  road  freight.  The  national  freight  fleet \nincreased  from  963,000  in  1985/86  to  2.6  million  in  1999/2000.  Light  commercial  vehicles \nincreased much faster than the heavy commercial vehicles. In this multilevel industry, shippers \nusually contact transport companies that can assume the legal liabilities associated with cargo \nhaulage.  Since  these  transport  companies  have  limited  fleets,  most  use  trucks  provided  by \ncargo brokers. After receiving orders from shippers, transport companies contact cargo brokers \nbased  in  the  regions  from  where  the  cargo  originates.  These  brokers  (usually  individuals)  will \nthen contact truck owners (again, often individuals) or truck drivers, who often wait for cargo at \ntruck parking lots or along highways. Truck parking lots are usually found in city outskirts, and \n\nRoad Transport Services \n\n4. \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nmost are informal and often surrounded by small buildings housing cargo brokers. The trucking \nindustry  performs  poorly  because  of  (i)  the  high  proportion  of  overage  vehicles;  (ii)  lack  of \nbackhaul cargo; and (iii) lack of loading and unloading facilities, preventing transshipment from \nlarger to smaller trucks, which is often needed in the peripheries of major cities that have truck \nbans. \n \n12. \nThe  upgraded  NH  system  is  designed  for  an  operating  speed  of  100  km  per  hour. \nHowever, trucks usually run at 40\u201350 km, particularly when carrying heavy-duty cargo such as \ncontainers. Unless trucking services are modernized, the full benefits of the upgraded highway \nnetwork will not be realized. A policy is needed to modernize trucking services, particularly for \nintermodal operation. In 2002, MORTH asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider \nhelping develop a trucking policy.  \n \n13. \nThe public and private sectors provide passenger services through road transport. Over \nthe years, the share of the public sector in the total bus fleet has declined. In 1980/81, the public \nsector held 45% of the total number of buses, but only 21% in 1999/2000. \n \n \n \n14. \nThe  central  Government  provides  funds  from  yearly  budgetary  allocations  to  develop \nand  maintain  NHs,  while  state  governments  fund  state  highways  and  district  and  rural  roads. \nTransport investments have accounted for about 13% of total public sector spending under the \nGovernment\u2019s 5-year plans.  \n \n\nRevenues/Expenditures and Road Fund \n\n5. \n\nTable A3: Five-Year Plan Expenditure in the Transport Sector \n\n \nSubsector \nRailways \nRoads \nRoad Transport \nPorts \nShipping \nInland Water Transport \nCivil Aviation \nOther Transport \nTotal Transport \nTotal Public Transport \nTotal Transport as age to Pubic Sector  \n\nVI Plan \n(1980-85) \n65.85 \n38.87 \n12.76 \n7.25 \n4.68 \n0.63 \n9.57 \n- \n139.61 \n1,092.91 \n12.8 \n\nVII Plan \n(1985-90) \n165.49 \n63.35 \n21.51 \n15.13 \n7.20 \n1.88 \n19.48 \n0.72 \n294.76 \n2,187.29 \n\n \n\nVIII Plan \n(1992-97) \n321.39 \n161.33 \n36.34 \n24.91 \n47.26 \n1.54 \n75.04 \n2.44 \n670.25 \n5,332.52 \n12.6 \n\n(Rs billion)  \n\nIX Plan \n(1997-2002) \n464.05 \n475.10 \n59.33 \n53.31 \n29.67 \n2.80 \n69.58 \n18.51 \n1,172.35 \nn.a. \nn.a. \n\nSource: Planning Commission, Government of India. n.a.: not available. \n\n \n15. \nRoad expenditure increased by 11 times from Rs39 billion in the Sixth Five-Year Plan to \nRs475 billion in the Ninth Five-Year Plan. The transport budget allocation increased by about 7 \ntimes in the same period. The road sector\u2019s share of total transport investment also increased \nfrom about 28% in the Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-85) to about 40% in the Ninth Five Year Plan \n(1997-2002), reflecting government commitment to improve highway infrastructure to meet the \ndemands of the growing economy and help reduce poverty. \n \n16. \nA  very  limited  central  road  fund  has  existed  for  years.  The  central  Government \nrevamped  it  through  excise  duties  (cess)  of  Re1  per  liter  of  petrol  (1998)  and  diesel  (1999, \nthrough the Central Road Fund Ordinance). These cess are expected to raise Rs60 billion ($1.2 \nbillion) per annum. To institutionalize the revamped CRF, Parliament passed the Central Road \nFund Act in November 2000. According to its allocation formula, and assuming Rs10 billion is \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\n6.  \n\n         25 \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n \nraised from petrol and Rs50 billion from diesel, approximately Rs25 billion will be allocated for \nrural roads, Rs20 billion for NHs, Rs11 billion for state highways and major district roads, and \nRs45  billion  for  railway  crossings  and  other  purposes.  Unlike  a  typical  road  fund,  which  is \nprimarily  used  for  maintenance,  CRF  will  be  used  mainly  to  develop  the  road  network \n(Supplementary Appendix U).  \n \n \n \nNH  network  maintenance  has  been  neglected  due  to  inadequate  fund  allocation.  The \n17. \nNinth Five Year Plan allocated more than twice the amount in the previous 5-year plan for NH \nmaintenance, but in FY 2000, the maintenance shortfall, which was 48.3% in 1993/94, remained \nat  practically  the  same  level  (50%)  in  FY  2002.  However,  MORTH  partly  solved  this  problem \nthrough riding-quality improvements for the maintenance programs. \n \n18. \nNHAI,  which  is  required  to  maintain  NHs  entrusted  to  it,  currently  does  so  through  the \nPublic Works Departments (PWDs) or contracts it out to a private contractor (occasionally NHAI \ndoes  it  by  itself).  The  maintenance  cost  has  been  covered  by  budgetary  support  from  the \nCentral Government. Faced with rapid expansion in the road network entrusted to it, NHAI has \ndecided to explore the possibility of introducing an asset management concept to maintain and \nmanage  its  road  network  more  systematically.  It  commissioned  a  study  under  World  Bank \nfunding  on  the  corridor  management  units  (CMUs).  A  key  element  of  the  CMU  concept  is  to \noperate and maintain the road network through contracting out to private contractors. A CMU is \nalso responsible for ensuring the integrity of the right of way by maintaining fences and markers, \ncontrolling  overloading  of  trucks,  taking  necessary  accident  prevention  measures,  removing \nobstacles on roads, controlling emission, and keeping noises within acceptable limits. With the \nrecent  completion  of  the  study,  two  pilot  CMUs  will  be  established  under  the  Third  National \nHighway Project of the World Bank (see Supplementary Appendix W for the CMU concept). \n \nThe  current  O&M  policy  of  NHAI  is  to  contract  them  out  as  much  as  possible  to  the \n19. \nprivate sector. Under the Surat-Manor and Western Transport projects, advisory services will be \nprovided for the development of performance based O&M agreements to be carried out by the \nprivate sector. \n \n\n7. \n\nEnvironmental Issues \n\n \n20. \nSince 1991, the Government has gradually intensified its control over gas emission from \nvehicles. First-stage control was introduced for petrol-powered vehicles in 1991 and for diesel-\npowered  vehicles  in  1992.  The  Bharat  stage-1  emission  standards,  which  are  akin  to  Euro-1 \nstandards, have become effective throughout the country since 2000. The Government plans to \nintroduce  tougher  standards,  corresponding  to  Euro-2  requirements  for  passenger  cars  and \ncommercial vehicles. Bharat stage-2 standards, which are close to Euro-2 standards, have been \nin force in the National Capital Region and are intended to be enforced shortly throughout the \ncountry. Leaded fuel has been gradually phased out from metropolitan cities since 1998 with the \nintroduction of unleaded fuel. Now petrol fuel is fully unleaded all over the country. Benzene in \npetrol  has  also  been  reduced  to  3%  all  over  the  country  and  to  1%  in  Delhi.  Since  December \n1998, commercial vehicles over 15 years old have been banned from Delhi\u2019s center. \n \n21. \nADB has been working with the Government to solve road sector-related environmental \nproblems  by  preventing  environmental  degradation  during  construction  and  operation  of \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nhighways, for example, and controlling urban traffic pollution. An ADB technical assistance2 on \nenvironmental  management  prepared  highway  project  guidelines.  They  are  now  used  on  all \nhighway improvement and reconstruction projects in India. ADB\u2019s Second Road Project3 studied \nmeasures  to  control  traffic  pollution  in  urban  areas.  The  Central  Pollution  Control  Board  then \nupdated its mass emission regulations and enforced them more stringently.  \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1993.

The  areas  of  concern  are  preparation,  packaging,  and \npromotion  of  the  BOT  project;  and  the  structure  of  the  concession  agreement.  Two  potential \nBOT  projects  have  been  identified  and  are  presented  below.  Problems  in  project  preparation, \npackaging, and promotion, and how the project will address them, are discussed. The analysis \nwhich  was  prepared  by  PPTA  consultant1  will  be  further  modified  or  verified  at  a  later  stage \nwhen more detailed traffic counts are gathered and tolling strategies are developed. \n  \nA. \n \nThe  portion  of  the  project  road  to  be  undertaken  as  a  BOT  project  was  selected  after \n2. \nindividual road sections were examined, and various combinations of these sections tested. The \nevaluation was made using a generally accepted accounting practices model, which developed \na  financing  structure  to  meet  project  cash-flow  requirements  and  provide  an  optimum  score \nbased on debt service coverage ratio and internal rate of return. For all of the links considered, \nthe model assumed a 60:40 debt-to-equity ratio, with 13% interest on the loans. The best loan \nstructure was found to be 13 years with a 5-year grace period.  \n \nTwo  road  sections  were  found  to  be  feasible  for  BOT  financing.  One  includes  two \n3. \nsections connecting Mobri and Samakhali; both will be widened to four lanes. The second road \nsection includes three road sections and a bypass connecting Jetpur and Bamanbore; two are \nalready four-lane roads but not yet tolled. The section from Jetpur to Gondal will be widened to \nfour  lanes,  and  a  bypass  constructed  around  Rajkot.  The  various  sections  are  described  in \nTable A4.1. Their locations are in Figure 1. \n \n\nTable A4.1 Description of Various Sections \n\nSection  Location \n\nLength  Existing Condition Capital Expenditure \n\nA \nB \nC \nD \nE \nF \n\nJetput-Gondal \nGondal-Rajkot \nRajkot Bypass \nRajkot-Bamanbore \nMorbi-Maliya \nMaliya-Samakhali \n\n26.3 \n32.0 \n10.0 \n31.0 \n25.4 \n40.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2-lane \n4-lane \nNone \n4-lane \n2-lane \n2-lane \n\n(Rs10 million) \n109.3 \n \n101.1 \n \n85.9 \n173.9 \n\n \n4. \nThe  resulting  values  for  the  debt  service  coverage  ratio  and  internal  rates  of  return  for \nvarious  combinations  of  these  sections  are  shown  in  Table  A4.2.  The  widening  of  the  Mobri-\nSamakhali link provides a good return. The northern section provides a higher return than the \nsouthern  section,  but  the  combination  would  be  a  larger  project  more  attractive  to  contractors \nand  allowing  for  economies  of  scale  in  management.  This  link  is  expected  to  serve  a  growing \nnumber of multi-axle vehicles, and the revenues are likely to be enhanced with a toll structure \nbased on truck size. Diversion from this road, which has few access roads, is also not likely. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Individual consultant engaged under the PPTA arrangement, John Arnold. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nTable A4.2: Internal Rates of Return \n\nProject Indicator \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio \n Minimum \n Average  \nInternal Rates Of Return \n Project (post-tax, all equity) \n Equity (post-tax with debt) \nWeighted Scores \n\nA \n \n0.62 \n2.34 \n \n17.6% \n18.7% \n15 \n\nC \n\nA+C \n\n  \n\n  \n\nA-B-C  A-B-C-D\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\nE \n\nF \n\nE-F \n\n \n\n \n\n0.01 \n0.64 \n \n5.3% \n<0 \n3 \n\n0.38 \n1.59 \n \n13.1% \n11.8% \n9 \n\n0.39 \n2.59 \n \n18.8% \n20.4% \n16 \n\n-0.14 \n2.88 \n \n20.9% \n23.9% \n16 \n\n0.31 \n2.22 \n \n17.8% \n18.8% \n15 \n\n1.19 \n2.92 \n \n20.3% \n23.4% \n17 \n\n0.88 \n2.71 \n \n19.3% \n21.7% \n16 \n\nNote: Assume debt-to-equity of 60:40, debt with tenor of 13 years starting after disbursement, and a 5-year grace \nperiod. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 4\n\n29\n\nThe only section that is clearly not viable as a stand-alone is the Rajkot Bypass, where \n5. \nthe return on equity is negative. The section from Jetput to Gondal has a reasonable return but \nnot when combined with the bypass. The two sections are separated by 32 kilometers (km), and \nadding  the  intervening  section  to  the  BOT  project  will  improve  returns,  operation  and \nmanagement, and tolling. The extension of the northern section to Bamanbore is an additional \nsweetener  to  financial  performance,  and  adds  more  flexibility  to  tolling,  and  economies  to \nadministration  and  use  of  equipment.  This  project  has  the  advantage  that  the  revenues \ngenerated  from  the  existing  four-lane  sections  can  be  used  to  offset  some  of  the  construction \ncosts\u2014a factor that has not been included in the calculations. Traffic levels on the existing four-\nlane roads are based on older traffic counts, which are well below earlier tariff counts and traffic \nlevels on adjoining sections. Traffic levels are likely higher than reported, which would contribute \nto the funds available during construction as well as overall. Finally, the estimated costs for the \nbypass  were  based  on  certain  design  requirements.  This  cost  could  be  substantially  reduced \nand returns improved.  \n \n6. \nThe concept of sweetening marginal BOT projects with toll revenues from existing road \nsections rather than grants should be of increasing importance as the network develops. Of the \ntwo possible packages (A-B-C and A-B-C-D), package A-B-C-D was recommended.  \n \n7. \nThis BOT project is expected to be offered to the market without a grant component and \npossibly a negative grant. During project preparation, a survey will determine market appetite for \nthe project. A financial advisor to be engaged by NHAI will interact with potential investors and \nlenders during preparation of the concession agreement. If, despite these efforts, interest in the \nproject  is  still  insufficient,  then  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  may  either \nintroduce a grant component, removing the traffic risk by converting BOT to an annuity structure \n(requiring little change in contract documents), or using a traditional construction contract to be \nsupported by cess2 funds.  \n \nB. \n \n\nBOT Project Design Issues   \n\n1. \n\nPreparation \n\nThe  extent  of  project  preparation  is  important  to  increase  investor  confidence.  Three \n\n \n8. \nareas of preparation require review: traffic projections, project design, and permits.  \n \n9. \nThe  major  source  of  risk  for  BOT  projects  is  traffic.  Bidders  undertake  their  own  traffic \nsurveys, which, however, adds to the cost and time to prepare the bid. The scope of the survey \nwill  also  be  limited  by  time  to  verifying  the  results  of  earlier  surveys.3  NHAI  must  provide  a \ncomprehensive  set  of  traffic  counts  along  the  route  so  that  bidders  can  verify  these  results \nrather than develop new numbers. The location and format of these counts should be carefully \ndesigned.  In  some  cases,  the  results  should  be  supported  with  driver  interviews.  Given  the \nawareness  among  investors  of  the  weakness  of  past  traffic  counts,  NHAI  must  set  a  high \nstandard for its own. The BOT project solves this problem by resurveying the traffic based on a \nreview of traffic flows and closely supervising the enumerators. \n \n10. \nThe current level of design performed by NHAI consultants varies. For some projects, a \ndetailed project design including a substantial percentage of the final drawings is prepared while \n\n                                                 \n2 Excise duty levied on fuel. \n3 It is not possible to obtain information on seasonal variations or to obtain sufficient coverage to predict traffic along \n\nthe entire routes. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nothers  have  a  preliminary  design.  While  the  contracts  accommodate  this  variation,  NHAI  is \nultimately  responsible  for  these  roads  and  they  should  be  consistent  with  the  rest  of  the \nnetwork. The NHAI consultants should be required to prepare a detailed design report. This not \nonly  provides  comfort  to  the  contractors  and  their  lenders  but  also  reduces  the  possibility  of \nsignificant variations which could affect the cost of the project.  It also ensures that the bidders \nwill  be  bidding  against  consistent  expectations  of  what  their  obligations  are.    The  planning  for \nthe  current  BOT  project  is  well  along  towards  the  development  of  the  detailed  design  and  no \nproblem is expected. \n \n11.  Where BOT projects involve short stretches, natural choke points or isolated links, there \nis little problem of designing the tollbooths. However, for road stretches in which there are many \naccess  roads  and  considerable  movement  of  traffic  on  and  off  the  tolled  road,  then  the \nplacement of tollbooths become a strategic consideration. In an open-toll situation, the tolling is \ndone  through  a  combination  of  barrier  and  tollbooths.  The  location  and  number  of  these \ndetermine both the cost of collection and the portion of the traffic that actually pays for the use \nof the road.  NHAI has yet to develop a comprehensive tolling strategy for the network and the \nprivate  sector  has  limited  experience.  The  design  of  tolling  requires  traffic  information  on \nalternative  sites,  an  economic  comparison  of  the  costs  and  revenues  for  collection,  and  the \neffect of the amount charged at each collection point on diversion of traffic. The design of the \nconcession should include identification of tolling sites. While the concessionaire can modify the \nplan, this basic plan would provide a common starting point for bid preparation.  Presumably this \nplan  would  be  based  on  more  detailed  traffic  data  than  the  bidder  could  collect  during  the  bid \nprocess. This information is also necessary for determine the financial viability of a BOT project. \nMore detailed analysis will be carried out later to determine what percentage of traffic will pays \ntolls.   \n \n12. \nThe primary source of risk to the contractors at the design stage is securing the right of \nway and necessary permits to develop the roadway. This is a universal problem. So far, India \nhas, however, been free of high-profile controversy where a major road is delayed or cancelled \nbecause  of  these  types  of  problems,  but  past  successes  are  not  solutions.  The  contract \nprovides some comfort to the proponent in this regard, but the private sector continues to regard \nthis as a significant risk. The NHAI should gradually increase the amount of preparation prior to \nawarding the bid. The current BOT project has a limited number of permitting issues since the \nright of way has been secured or to be secured by NHAI. \n \n\nb. \n\n Packaging  \n\n \n13. \nThe  BOT  project  should  offer  (i)  a  road  investment  possible  additional  investment \nopportunities  to  capture  the  benefits  from  the  higher  than  expected  traffic  growth,  (ii)  a  high \nprobability  of  achieving  an  acceptable  rate  of  return  for  the  private  sector,  and  (iii)  a  level  of \ninvestment  acceptable  to  contractors  and  lenders.  The  BOT  project  should  generate  a \nsignificant  level  of  competition  for  the  contracts  to  develop  roads  at  reasonable  cost  and  of \nacceptable quality. The two most important considerations in meeting these objectives are the \nsize of the package and the cash flow to be generated from tolls. \n \n14. \nProject  size  is  critical  as  it  determines  the  extent  of  competition.  Whereas  smaller \ncontracts  only  attract  small  contractors,  larger  projects  attract  a  mix  of  large  contractors  and \nconsortium  of  smaller  contractors.  Thus,  large  contracts  offer  potentially  more  effective \ncompetitive bidding where permitted by the prequalification process. Limits on project size are \ndetermined primarily by cost rather than road length or nature of construction. In recent years, \nthe  contracting  industry  has  demonstrated  an  ability  to  construct  good  roads  in  a  variety  of \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 4\n\n31\n\nsituations.  Like  most  construction  industries,  however,  the  contracting  industry  has  limited \naccess  to  capital.  The  largest  Indian  contractor  has  a  turnover  of  less  than  Rs2,000  billion. \nBelow that, the average for larger firms is probably no more than Rs300 billion, suggesting that \nthe amount of equity that could be committed to a 2-year construction effort would not exceed \nRs600 billion and, given current leverage, maximum project size would be Rs1.5 billion. NHAI \nhas been offering projects up to Rs6 billion. Smaller contractors take on these larger projects by \nforming  consortia,  or  involving  foreign  contractors,  which  is  an  increasingly  important \nmechanism.  As  NHAI\u2019s  experience  and  reputation  with  larger  projects  increases,  foreign \ncontractors will become more interested in them and competition will thus increase. \n \n15. \nPhysically  large  projects  offer  potential  economies  of  scale  in  construction  and \nmaintenance, derived from spreading administrative and planning costs over a greater length of \nroad and providing a sufficient volume of work over time to achieve a high level of equipment \nuse.  These  advantages  extend  to  road  maintenance  where  the  level  of  activity  per  km  is  low \nand  large  roads  allow  use  of  efficient  equipment  and  permanent  labor.  These  advantages \ndepend  not  only  on  road  length  but  also  continuity.  Noncontiguous  sections  create  operation \nand maintenance problems.  \n \n16. \nSignificant  economies  of  scale  may  also  be  associated  with  revenue  collection.  The \nlarger  the  project,  the  greater  the  options  for  toll  plaza  location.  Since  these  roads  have  an \nopen-toll  system,  toll  plaza  placement  has  a  major  impact  on  toll-paying  traffic.  The  more  toll \nplazas, the higher the proportion of toll-paying traffic, but also the higher the operating costs and \nthe  lower  the  average  travel  speed.  The  appropriate  distance  between  toll  plazas  cannot  be \ndetermined by formula but only by careful analysis of present and planned roads that link with \nthe project road, and a study of traffic-flow patterns. The longer the stretch of road, the greater \nthe flexibility in selecting locations and the fewer toll plazas required per km. To the extent that \nthe contractor can encourage traffic in one section through the pricing or quality of the adjoining \nsection, a larger project will allow an increase in traffic volume. \n \n17. \nLenders  are  generally  neutral  about  project  size.  For  larger  projects,  they  can  form \nconsortia  or  employ  other  mechanisms  to  share  the  risk.  Lenders\u2019  major  concern  is  the \nexpected level and robustness of potential project returns. Loans to construction contractors are \nseen  as  high  risk.  The  experience  with  nonrecourse  lending  to  private  builders  of  public \ninfrastructure is limited, having only started in 1999. Investor involvement in these projects has \nbeen limited since the markets for investments are limited. Interest is growing among the large \ninvestment companies and industrial companies that perceive the potential for significant gains \nin road projects with a strong upside on traffic growth. The infrastructure funds that appeared in \nthe 1990s have lowered investors\u2019 expectations of potential returns but have also become a less \npotent  force  in  the  market  as  their  focus  was  on  short-term  involvement  (less  than  10  years). \nPotential investors interested in long-term, secure investments such as pension funds, provident \nfunds, and insurance companies have remained on the sidelines. These potential investors are \nseen  as  sources  of  debt  rather  than  investment,  which  may  make  sense  given  the  limited \ncontract periods. \n \nA  key  consideration  in  project  deign  is  cash  flow.  Projects  that  require  a  long \n18. \nconstruction period or have low initial traffic levels will have an extended period of negative cash \nflow, which is difficult for the private sector, especially with its higher cost of capital. Grants have \nbeen used to offset the negative cash flow. The amount of grant is determined through bidding. \nAn upfront payment is inherently more costly because of the high discount rates applied by the \nbidders  to  determine  grant  size,  and  riskier  for  NHAI.  The  grants  have  been  relatively  large\u2014\n30%  of  estimated  project  cost.  Assuming  that  these  estimates  are  high  by  20\u201330%,  the  grant \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nprovides 40% of project cost, reducing the equity and lending requirements of the proponents. \nThe grant also provides a cash input to the proponent during construction. A substantial upfront \npayment effectively transfers most of the financing risk to NHAI.  \n \nA more logical approach would be to spread the grant over time, thus taking advantage \n19. \nof  the  discount  rate  differential  and  tying  the  grant  to  contractor  performance.4  This  approach \nwould also require the contractor to commit its own equity to the project. The amount of grant \nwould still be determined through competitive bidding, but the payments would be according to \na prearranged schedule.  \n \n20. \nAn alternative method to reduce the cost and risk to the contractor during construction is \nto combine greenfield and brownfield toll road sections, thus providing the contractor with cash-\ngenerating activity during the initial years of the project and reassuring lenders since a stream of \nrevenue  will  be  available  to  cover  the  initial  debt  service.  The  proposed  BOT  projects  have \ncombined contiguous sections of roads to ensure adequate size of investment\u2014Rs2-2.5 billion. \nThe  amount  of  construction\u201436-65  km\u2014is  moderate.  Project  size  was  limited  by  the  lack  of \ncontiguous  sections  offering  an  adequate  return.  One  of  the  two  proposed  projects  includes  a \nmix of greenfield and brownfield projects. \n \n \n \n21. \nProject  success  requires  strong  competition  among  bidders,  which  can  be  encouraged \nby promoting the project through road shows among foreign contractors and lenders, especially \nfor  large  projects  requiring  substantial  equity.  Promotion  is  less  necessary  for  small  projects \ninvolving local contractors and lenders.  \n \n22. \nPromotion  may  be  useful  to  attract  new  contractors  where  the  prequalification \nrequirements or the terms of the contract have been changed, and to build confidence among \npotential  investors  and  contractors.  Local  lenders  and  investors  are  uncertain  about  the \npotential  for  successful  road  concessions.  Promotion  can  be  used  to  inform  the  financial \ncommunity  of  successful  undertakings  and  to  dispel  concerns  about  unsuccessful  ones. \nPromotion can be especially useful when complemented by improved project design, as is the \ncase with the proposed BOT project, which introduces innovations in combining greenfield and \nbrownfield components and complementary changes in project design. \n \n23. \nFor this project, promotion targets local contractors as well as the financial community, \nnot  through  a  road  show  but  rather  through  workshops  presenting  the  project  format  and  a \ndiscussion of concerns of this community about past and present BOT projects. \n \n\nPromotion  \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\nd. \n\nSelection Criteria \n\n \n24. \nnegative grant) will be selected. \n \n\n \n\nConcessionaires  who  claims  the  lowest  amount  of  grant  from  NHAI  (including  the \n\n                                                 \n4    Assuming  that  the  paid-in  capital  would  be  phased  during  construction,  the  NHAI  grant  might  still  be  used  to \n\nprovide project equity.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 5          33\n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\n($ million)\n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nTotal\n\nItem\nA.

No \n\n \nA. \nSector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty analysis?   No \nContribution of the highway/road sector to reduce poverty in India: \n \nThe highway and road sector development significantly but indirectly reduces poverty by stimulating \neconomic growth, in turn raising incomes and improving the quality of life.   \n \nThe Project will pass through agricultural areas, increasing economic opportunities by (i) enabling \nvillagers to shift from subsistence farming to market-oriented agricultural surplus production; and (ii) \nhelping local people, particularly rural youth, move out of the village to work at better-paid jobs in \nmanufacturing or trading. The Project will also provide social benefits such as (i) improved access to \nhealth, education, and social services; and (ii) increased access to learning opportunities, including \ninformation technologies, thus reducing the project areas\u2019 isolation from cultural and commercial \ncenters.  Road improvement will also have short-term impact on poverty reduction as the rural poor are \nhired for construction, tree planting, and ensuing maintenance works. These opportunities will directly \nincrease earnings of the poor who are largely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment.  \n \nThe Project will help the Government improve national, state, and rural roads. Its road development \npolicy is comprehensive and aims to connect the entire country, with the highest priority accorded to \nrural roads. Asian Development Bank will extend assistance not only to develop national highways but \nalso state roads beginning this year and rural roads next year.  \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProposed Classification: Thematic \nEconomic growth and private sector development  \n\nAnalysis:  \nPoverty in Gujarat is significantly less severe than in the rest of India,1 with 14.1% of the population \nbelow the poverty line. In 1993\u20132000, Gujarat achieved higher-than-average economic growth of 7.2% \nper year, reducing poverty slightly faster than the national average.2 The Project is expected to \nstimulate the state\u2019s economic growth, which will, in turn, reduce poverty (Supplementary Appendix Q).  \nThe proposed 506-kilometer (km) highway improvement will pass through approximately 170 villages \nand 12 urban areas. Community assessment surveys on poverty impact carried out in June 2002 \nrevealed that project area residents generally perceive a positive linkage between poverty reduction \nand highway improvement.  The survey also revealed that 20% of workers, many of whom are \nagricultural laborers, were employed an average distance of 9 km from their villages. Improved mobility \nwould provide these workers with better-paying jobs outside the villages, including in towns. \nRespondents also indicated that the Project would improve public transport services and possibly make \nthem cheaper and faster, which would directly benefit agricultural laborers working outside their \nvillages. Nearly half the respondents felt that increased mobility would facilitate their access to \neducational and medical facilities.  \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \nParticipation strategy:  NHAI continues to strengthen communication with stakeholders and has \nrecently established the Advisory Council, representing various groups, including consumers and road \nusers. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1 26.1% is defined as below the poverty line. \n2 During these 6 years, poverty has gone down by 10.2% in Gujarat, while the national average has gone down by \n9.9%. During the same period, state gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.2%, faster than the national average \nof 6.4%.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \n\nAppendix 8\n\n37\n\nDuring project preparation, NHAI consulted a broad range of stakeholders, including (i) heads of \nhouseholds and or businesses to be affected, (ii) affected persons in small groups, (iii) village \npanchayat and sarpanch, (iv) local voluntary organizations and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \n(v) government agencies and departments; and (vi) women and other vulnerable groups.   \n \nAs a part of the poverty assessment, community assessment was conducted with various local \ncommunities, including scheduled castes and tribes. \n \nThe Project includes a capacity-building component to familiarize NHAI management and staff with the \nconcept of stakeholder participation and best practices in participation, inside and outside India. This \ncomponent will help NHAI better understand highway development activities and feedback from them. \n \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nOutput Prepared \n\n \nD.  \nSubject \n\nPotential Issues   \n\nSignificant,  \nNot Significant, \nUncertain, None \nSignificant \n\nResettlement \n\nGender \n\nNot significant \n\nLabor \n\nNot significant \n\nDraft resettlement plan \noutlining measures, \nincluding resettlement \nand income restoration \nNot applicable \n\nAddressed in the \nresettlement plan \n\nIndigenous \nPeople \n\nNot significant  \n\nNot applicable \n\nAll affected persons, identified \nthrough census surveys \nComplete inventory of assets \nprepared \nAdditional assistance to female-\nheaded household, to be provided \nas a part of the resettlement plan \nA survey conducted by the labor \ncommissioner of Gujarat found that \nchild labor is rampant generally in \nIndia but not in Gujarat.

Scheduled tribes \nwill be affected by the Project but \nnot differently from the other social \ngroups.

The  Project  consists  of  five  NH  sections  (Table \nA9.1) and will widen the entire stretch to four lanes; and improve junctions, underpasses, and \ntwo bypasses.1 The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is the project Executing Agency.  \n \n\n       \n\nRoad  \n\nSection 1 \nSection 2 \nSection 3 \nSection 4 \nSection 5 \nTotal \n\nTable A9.1: Project Roads \n\nRoads \n\nPorbander-Jetpur Road (NH8B) \nJetpur-Gondal Road and Rajkot Bypass (NH8B) \nBamanmore-Samakhiali Road (NH8A) \nSamakhiali-Radhanpur Road (NH15) \nRadhanpur-Deesa (NH14) \n \n\nLength  \n(km) \n115.0 \n36.3 \n125.4 \n142.5 \n85.4 \n504.6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n   \n2. \nThe existing right of way of NHs are generally 45 meters (m), except for NH14 and NH15 \n(sections  4  and  5),  which  have  a  60  m  right  of  way.  The  four-lane  facility  comprises  a  7  m \nsegregated  carriageway  divided  by  medians  of  varying  width  and  on  an  average  2.0  X  1.5  m \npaved  shoulder.  The  four-lane  carriageway  is  designed  for  vehicles  traveling  at  an  average  of \n100 km/hour. Improvement works can be carried out within the existing right of way except for \nminor  adjustments  and  alignment  straightening.  Since  NHAI  already  owns  the  existing  right  of \nway for entire road sections, new acquisition will be minimal and confined largely to construction \nof the bypasses in Ranavav and Upleta.  \n\n \nProject Impacts  \n\nB. \n \n\nLand Acquisition \n\n1. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  permanently  acquire  nearly  364  hectares.  The  bulk  of  land  acquisition \n(Table  A9.2)  will  be  in  sections  1  (NH8B),  2  (NH8A),  and  3  (NH8A)  for  major  bypasses, \nresettlement  site,  and  realignment.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nsignificantly  reduce  resettlement  impacts  by  (i)  keeping  the  improvement  works  within  the \nexisting right of way, (ii) adopting symmetrical widening, (iii) raising carriageway over congested \nsegments, and (iv) building bypasses to avoid congested urban settlements. Provisions for 10 \nrailways  over  bridge  and/or  under  bridge  and  138  underpasses  were  made  following \nconsultations  with  affected  communities  and \nfacilitate \nuninterrupted movement of people, livestock, and tractor and or trucks used for cultivation.    \n\nlocal  government  officials, \n\nto \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1 Although these five sections are different from those for packaging purposes, both sections cover the same \n\nstretches. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nTable A9.2: Land Acquisition for the Project  \n\nSection \n\nNH8B\u2013Section 1 \nNH 8B\u2013Section 2 \nNH8A\u2013Section 3 \nNH15\u2013Section 4 \nNH14\u2013Section 5 \n\nTotal \n\nJunction \nImprovements \n55.0 \n10.1 \n24.0 \n20.0 \n15.0 \n124.1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHa = hectares, NH = national highway \n \n\n2. \n\nTypes of Losses \n\nBypasses \n\nRealignments \n\n111 \n\uf8e7 \n\uf8e7 \n\uf8e7 \n\uf8e7 \n111 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n51.0 \n \n42.0 \n28.0 \n3.0 \n124.0 \n\nDevelopment of \nResettlement Sites \n \n4.9 \n\uf8e7 \n\uf8e7 \n\uf8e7 \n4.9 \n\nTotal \n(ha) \n217 \n15 \n66 \n48 \n18 \n364 \n\n \nThe census/socioeconomic surveys carried out in May 2002 generated a full inventory of \n4. \nassets  and  losses  of  affected  persons  for  relocation  assistance.  A  sizeable  number  of  1,738 \nsmall  business  enterprises  (SBEs),  480  informal  settlers,  and  308  agricultural  families  will  be \naffected; a total of 13,064 people will be affected by the Project (Table A9.3).  \n\n \n\nTable A9.3: Project Affected Families \n  \n\nSections \n\nAffected Families \n\nAffected Persons \n\nSection I \n\nSection II \n\nSection III \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Census Survey. \n\nSection IV \n\nSection V \n\nTotal \n\n   \n\n423 \n401 \n411 \n176 \n1,115 \n2,526 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1,589 \n2,141 \n2,368 \n910 \n6,056 \n13,064 \n\nPopulation \n(% of total) \n12.17 \n16.38 \n\n18.13 \n\n6.97 \n\n46.35 \n\n100.00 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(2,526 \n\ninformal  settlers,  SBEs,  and  agricultural \n\n \n5. \nClose  to  60%  of  all  affected  SBEs  are  in  section  5  (Radhanpur  to  Deesa).    Roadside \ninformal settlers (business and residential) form the largest group (68%) and are concentrated in \nsections 5, 2, and 3. Most informal settlers are small business owners and vendors. About 69% \nof  all  affected  units \nfamilies)  are \nbusiness/commercial  enterprises.  An  estimated  480  informal  settlers  (19%)  will  be  relocated. \nLand acquisition for the bypasses will likely affect an estimated 300 households, of which only \nabout 25 may require relocation; the rest will lose only agricultural plots.  However, because of \nstrip acquisition, impacts are not expected to be significant.   \n  \n6. \nAccording to the census data, over two thirds of these small business owners are poor, \nlargely  depend  only  on  their  businesses,  and  are  mainly  illegal  occupants  on  the  right  of  way \nand  thus  vulnerable  economically  and  socially.  Roadside  residents  will  lose  access  to  right  of \nway  and  structures  whereas  business  owners  will  lose  their  livelihoods.  Losses  include  (i) \nstructures (business and/or residential), (ii) business, (iii) employment, (iv) income (temporarily), \nand  (v)  access  to  right  of  way  to  income-generating  activities  and  livelihood  sources.    About \n71%  of  the  affected  structures  are  roadside  commercial  units.  Close  to  16%  of  the  structures \nare  residential.  The  over  100  community  structures  will  also  be  affected  by  project  road \nwidening.  Types of structures are (i) temporary (kuccha, 28%); (ii) semipermanent (semi-pucca, \n52%); and (iii) permanent (pucca, 20%).  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProject Impact on Indigenous and Vulnerable groups \n\n \n7. \nThe  project  census  identified  334  indigenous  and  or  scheduled  tribes  in  five  sections, \nwho are largely small business owners on the right-of-way alignments. The census identified the \nscheduled  tribes  without  differentiating  them.  However,  Anthropological  Survey  of  India  and \nother secondary sources state that the most important scheduled tribes in the project area are \nthe  Koli,  Bhil,  Paradhi,  and  Vaghri.  Socioeconomic  and  occupational/income  data  clearly \nsuggests  that  the  project-affected  scheduled  tribe  households  and  SBEs  are  similar  to  the \noverall affected population and largely assimilated into the local mainstream communities.   \n \n8. \nThe  vulnerable  group  consists  of  scheduled  castes  (371  members),  scheduled  tribes \n(305), female-headed households (16), those below the poverty line (729), and other backward \ncastes  (882).  A  trained  and  experienced  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  will  work \nexclusively  with  these  vulnerable  groups,  especially  scheduled  tribes,  to  restore  their  income \nthrough  training  and  skill  development  and  other  sustainable  programs  to  be  designed  after \nneeds  assessment  during  project  implementation.  The  NGO  will  help  vulnerable  affected \npersons benefit from ongoing poverty reduction programs targeted at scheduled tribes and the \nvery poor.  \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe land acquisition is governed by the National Highways Act of 1956 as amended in \n1997, which has considerably simplified acquisition procedures. The resettlement plan is guided \nby  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  as  well  as  NHAI \npolicies  and  practices  related  to  resettlement  in  ongoing  ADB-funded  projects.  The  primary \nobjective of the plan is to address all kind of losses and impacts of the project on different target \ngroups, businesses, and structures. Based on the inventory of losses, an entitlement matrix has \nbeen developed that identifies the affected persons and their losses, defines compensation and \nentitlements,  and  allocates  accountability  for  various  resettlement  tasks.  Affected  persons\u2019 \nlosses  will  be  dealt  with  as  follows:  (i)  titled  owners  will  be  paid  at  market  rates;  (ii) \nsharecroppers/tenants  will  be  compensated  for  loss  of  access  and/or  crops;  (iii)  loss  of \nstructures (by type) will be compensated at current construction/replacement costs; (iv) material \ncan be salvaged at no cost; and (v) income losses will be compensated, with vulnerable groups \nreceiving  additional  assistance.  For  nontitled  persons  (informal  settlers/SBEs),  the  cut-off  date \nfor  eligibility  is  the  date  of  the  census  in  that  road  section.  Publication  of  notification  under \nsection 3A(i) of the NHAI Act will apply to landowners.  \n\nResettlement Principles and Compensation  \n\n \n10. \nAnother major objective of the resettlement plan is to restore and improve the economic \ncondition  of  the  affected  persons,  particularly  the  vulnerable  groups.  Measures  such  as \nfacilitating transition allowance for lost livelihood, business/economic rehabilitation support, and \nalternative livelihood training have been adopted. Further details will be prepared during project \nimplementation. Economic rehabilitation will be partly supported by jobs in project construction. \nAs  many  children  working  in  roadside  business  will  be  affected,  the  project  NGO  will  help \nmainstream  them  in  education  and  tap  various  government  schemes  to  help  the  children\u2019s \nhouseholds  earn  income.  The  resettlement  plan  implementing  agencies  will  liaison  with  the \nblock  development  officer,  zilla  parishad  (district  council),  and  gram  panchayat  to  rehabilitate \nchild workers.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nRelocation Site Development and Rehabilitation Assistance \n\nStakeholder Participation, Disclosure of the Resettlement Plan, and Grievances \n\nD. \n \n11. \nAt  various  stages  of  project  planning,  affected  persons  have  been  informed  and \nconsulted about the likely project impacts. Various stakeholders consulted include (i) heads of \nhouseholds/business  units  to  be  affected;  (ii)  affected  persons  in  small  groups;  (iii)  village \npanchayat,  sarpanch,  and  their  members;  (iv)  local  voluntary  organizations  and  NGOs;  (v) \ngovernment  agencies  and  departments;  and  (vi)  women  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  The \nconsultation will continue throughout project implementation.   \n \n12. \nThe  draft  resettlement  plan  was  translated  into  Gujarati  and  disclosed  to  the  affected \npersons  and  other  stakeholders  for  review  and  comments  on  the  policy  in  general  and \nadequacy  of  the  mitigation  measures  in  particular.  Comments  were  collected  1  month  after \ndisclosure.  NHAI  organized  public  consultation  meetings  and  workshops  to  share  the  public\u2019s \nviews on the resettlement plan.  Key findings of disclosure and consultation indicate full support \nfor the Project. Some of the concerns raised have already been addressed by adjusting the road \ndesign  and  improving  compensation  and  resettlement  policy  measures  and  entitlements.  The \nthe  project  director  (NHAI);  district \ngrievance  redress  centers  (GRCs)  will  comprise \ncommissioner  or  his  or  her  representative;  representatives  of  affected  persons  (male  and \nfemale); local government/panchayat representative; resettlement officer for the project section \n(NHAI);  local.  Land  acquisition  officer;  and  a  representative  of  the  NGO  implementing  the \nresettlement plan.  GRC claims will be reviewed and resolved within three weeks from the date \nof submission to the local committee.    \n \nE. \n \n13. \nTwo  relocation  and  resettlement  sites  have  been  identified  in  Rajkot  (section  2)  and \nThara  (section  5)  in  consultation  with  the  affected  persons  and  local  administration.  In  Rajkot, \nabout  400  informal  residential  units  will  be  resettled;  the  affected  persons  are  generally  poor \nmigrant  laborers  and  depend  largely  on  the  local  industries/service  sectors  for  their  livelihood. \nThe site is approximately 2-km from the existing settlements. In Thara, affected units are over \n600 shops. The proposed site is next to the existing location, which will minimize disruption of \nbusinesses during project construction.   \n \n14. \nSeveral relocation options and strategies have been developed. The site for residential \ndwellers  will  be  developed  with  basic  civic  amenities  (e.g.,  internal  roads,  sanitary  facilities, \nwater and power supply, and community facilities). The households affected by land acquisition \nhave  expressed  their  desire  for  self-relocation.  In  addition  to  compensation  for  lost  assets, \nrelocated  families  will  receive  house  reconstruction  grants  and  shifting  allowances  for \nresettlement.  \n \nF. \n \n15. \nThe  economic  cost  of  road  accidents  in  Gujarat  is  estimated  at  Rs500  million.  The \nproject  road  sections  have  hardly  any  signs  for  pedestrians,  schools,  hospitals,  bus  and  truck \nstops, and rural markets. The improved road will likely cause highway accidents due to heavy \ntraffic;  faster  vehicles;  and  combination  of  multimodes  of  traffic,  including  slow-moving  and \nhuman-powered  vehicles.  However,  the  project  design  has  integrated  some  safety  measures \nsuch  as  provisions  for  intersections,  underpasses,  rail  over  bridges,  paved  shoulders,  and \nservice  roads  for  local  traffic,  especially  in  rural  areas  so  that  farmers  can  safely  move  their \n\nRoad Safety, HIV/AIDS,2  and Health Risks  \n\n                                                 \n2 Human immonudeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nImplementation Framework and Budget \n\nThe  resettlement  plan  addresses  HIV/AIDs  and  health \n\nherds.  The  project  design  also  integrates  right-of-way  management,  alternative  markets  for \nroadside vendors, and provisions for bus and truck stops to reduce accidents. The Project will \nconduct  safety  awareness  and  traffic  education  campaigns  through  the  NGO,  which  will  work \nwith  state  government  agencies  and  involve  private  sector  institutions  such  as  automobile \ncompanies, automobile associations, truckers associations, and community groups.  \n \n16. \nFocus group discussions with truck, chakra (improvised auto-rickshaw), and taxi drivers; \nroadside dhaba (wayside restaurant) owners; and tea-stall owners reveal that HIV is a serious \nproblem  among  highway  sex  workers  and  their  clients.  Gujarat  has  the  sixth-largest  HIV-\ninfected  population  in  India.  HIV  infection  is  5%  or  more  among  high-risk  groups  such  as  the \npoor;  marginalized  groups,  including  sex  workers;  migrant  laborers;  and  truck  drivers.  These \ngroups,  particularly  truckers,  spread  HIV/AIDs  around  the  country.  Road  improvements  will \nlikely worsen the already alarming situation. \n \n17. \nissues.  During  project \nimplementation,  qualified  NGOs  will  conduct  information  and  education  campaign  on  HIV/AID \nand other sexually transmitted diseases. The campaign will target project construction workers \nat campsites, truckers at truck stops and dhaba, and everyone along the alignment. The NGOs \nwill work closely with state agencies and community networks dedicated to prevention work. \n \nG. \n \n18. \nThe Environmental and Social Development Unit of NHAI will implement and supervise \nthe  resettlement  plan.  NHAI  will  engage  qualified  and  experienced  NGOs  separately  to  (i) \nimplement  the  resettlement  plan,  (ii)  run  road  safety  and  HIV/AIDs  awareness  and  education \nprograms, and (iii) work with scheduled tribes and affected persons and communities. NGOs will \nplay an important role in conducting the information campaign on resettlement plan policies and \nentitlements, disbursing compensation packages as described in the matrix, ensuring redressal \nof affected persons\u2019 legitimate grievances, and attending to the needs of vulnerable groups.  \n \n19. \nA  resettlement  unit  will  be  established  within  the  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  for \nproject-level  resettlement  plan  implementation.  The  resettlement  unit  will  be  headed  by  the \nproject director (PIU), and supported by five NHAI resettlement and rehabilitation officers, one \nfor  each  section.  They  will  coordinate  and  supervise  NGO  work  in  the  field  and  help  all \ncommittees  at  the  district  level  resolve  issues  related  to  resettlement.  Under  technical \nassistance, NHAI will conduct resettlement management training for its staff and partner agency \npersonnel implementing the resettlement plan. The training will also focus on issues related to \nthe  corridor  and  right-of-way  management  and  develop  guidelines  for  right-of-way  land \nmanagement and development plans. \n  \nThe  resettlement  plan,  including  land  acquisition,  will  be  implemented  over  36  months. \n20. \nCompensation for acquired assets will be paid before construction begins. The resettlement site \nwill  be  built  before  people  are  relocated.  Social  development  and  income  restoration  will \ncontinue  throughout  the  project  period.  The  total  resettlement  budget  is  Rs34,290,000.  The \nincluding \nestimates \ncompensation/resettlement assistance, relocation, shifting costs, NGO services, and monitoring \nand evaluation.  \n \n\nland  acquisition  and \n\ninclude  all  costs \n\nresettlement, \n\nrelated \n\nto \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nH. \n \n21. \nThe resettlement plan will have internal and external monitoring, methods of which are \nspecified in the resettlement plan.  Internal monitoring will be done by the resettlement unit. It \nwill  monitor  compliance  with  the  resettlement  plan\u2019s  principles  and  matrix,  compensation \npayment, compensation record, completion of compensation three months before construction, \njob creation, raising of safety and HIV/AIDs awareness, and GRCs, including satisfaction of the \naggrieved parties.    \n \n22. \nExternal  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  a  suitably  qualified  external  expert/agency  to \nbe  hired  by  NHAI  (with  ADB\u2019s  concurrence)  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  resettlement  plan \nactivities. The external monitor will be selected within three months of loan approval. Monitoring \nwill be carried out every six months in the first two years, and then annually through 2005. The \nmonitoring findings will be shared as reports to NHAI and ADB.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\n Introduction \n\nA. \n \nThe  East-West  (E-W)  Corridor  Project  is  under  category  B  in  accordance  with  the \n1. \nenvironmental  assessment  requirements  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  A  consulting  firm \nengaged by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) prepared an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE), on which this summary IEE is based. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  have  an  investment  component  to  rehabilitate  and  widen  five  highway \nsections  totaling  504  kilometers  (km).  The  project  roads  cover  the  Porbandar-Deesa  stretch, \nwhich connects the highways and forms a part of the E-W Corridor. The investment component \nis in the following sections: 1 \n \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nPorbandar-Jetpur, National Highway (NH) 8B (km 2\u2013117), 115 km total; \nJetpur-Gondal,  NH8B;  and  Rajkot  Bypass  (km  117.0\u2013143.3,  and  km  175.0\u2013\n185.0), 36.3 km total; \nBamanbore-Samakhiyali, NH8A (km 182.5\u2013308.0), 125.4 km total; \nSamakhiyali-Radhanpur, NH15 (km 281.3\u2013138.8), 142.5 km total; and  \nRadhanpur-Deesa, NH14, 85.4 km total. \n\n \n3. \nThe  project  road  has  a  generally  two-lane  carriageway  configuration  with  flexible \npavement.  Some  semiurban  roads  have  four-lane  dual  carriageways.  The  existing  shoulders \nare either granular or earthen, but are paved in urban and semiurban areas.  \n \n4. \n Road  rehabilitation  and  improvement  will  (i)  expand  two-lane  roads  (26.5  meters  [m] \nwide,  including  shoulders)  to  four  lane;  (ii)  construct  a  94.2  km  service  road  in  built-up  areas, \nwith  a  carriageway  width  of  5.5\u20137.0  m  and  separators  of  1.5\u20132.0  m;  (iii)  improve  205  bridges \nand 542 culverts, and reconstruct the Surajbari bridge; (iv) construct seven railway over bridges; \nand  (v)  establish  road  accessories,  segregate  slow-  and  fast-moving  traffic,  and  build \nemergency parking and toll plazas.  \n\n Description of the Environment \n\nC. \n \n5. \nconditions of the project areas are summarized below: \n \n\nThe  project  sections  are  under  Gujarat  provincial  administration.  The  environmental \n\nPorbandar-Jetpur.  In  Porbandar  and  Rajkot  districts,  the  area  is  flat.  Road \nalignment  passes  mainly  through  agricultural  land.  Soil  is  alluvial  and  contains \nlime.  About  142  big  and  small  rivers,  including  streams,  are  in  the  area,  and \nabout 10 tanks exist along the road alignment. The groundwater table is about 5\u2013\n15  m  deep.  Rainfall  is  very  low.  No  conservation  area  exists  in  and  around  the \nproject  road  area.  About  40,000  trees  on  both  sides  of  the  road,  and  about \n18,000 other trees will likely be cut to widen the road.  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n  \n\n                                                 \n1  Although the way of dividing Project highway is different from that in the main text, these fivesections cover the \n\nentire stretches of the Project highway. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10  \n\n       45 \n\nJetpur-Gondal.  This  section  passes  mainly  through  Rajkot.  The  area  is  flat. \nGroundwater is about 5\u201315 m deep, and about 19 big and small rivers, including \ncanals,  cross  the  road  alignment.  The  area  is  congested,  but  about  80%  of  the \nroad alignment passes through an agricultural area. No conservation or sensitive \narea exist within 10 km of either side of the road. About 8,000 trees on both sides \nof the road, and about 5,500 other trees will likely be cut to widen the road.  \n\nBamanbore-Samakhiyali.  In  Surendranagar  and  Kachch  districts,  this  road \nsection  passes  through  some  rolling  terrain,  but  80%  passes  through  flat  area, \nmostly farms. The climate is dry, and rainfall is only about 30\u201360 centimeters per \nyear.  The  road  crosses  26  rivers,  streams,  and  canals.  Within  10  km  of  either \nside of the road are 16 patches of forest but none categorized as a conservation \narea.  About  9,000  trees  on  both  sides  of  the  road,  and  about  5,000  other  trees \nwill likely be cut to widen the road.  \n\nSamakhiyali-Radhanpur.  In  Kachch  and  Patan  districts,  it  mostly  passes \nthrough a flat, mainly agricultural area. Groundwater is about 5\u201315 m deep. This \nsection  crosses  23  rivers,  streams,  and  canals;  9  ponds  exist  along  the  road \nalignment. From km 199 to 205, the two-lane road passes close to the Ghudkar \nwildlife  sanctuaries.  However,  the  existence  of  endangered  species  is  not \nreported. The area is highly populated, however, with 23 patches of forest within \n10  km  of  either  side  of  the  road.  About  24,000  trees  grow  along  the  roadside. \nAbout 14,000 will likely be cut for road widening. \n\nRadhanpur-Deesa. In Patan and Banaskantha districts, the road passes through \na mostly flat, mainly agricultural area. Only one river crosses the road alignment, \nbut 108 small tanks exist along the alignment. No conservation or other sensitive \nareas exist within 10 km of either side of the road. However, of the 55,000 trees \non both sides of the alignment, 50% will likely be cut for road widening.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n  \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nD. \n \nPotential impacts were screened but no significant environmental impact was identified. \n6. \nThe  Project  is  to  upgrade  the  existing  roads,  none  of  which  are  in  environmentally  sensitive \nareas. \n  \nThe environmental impacts associated with construction include (i) disruption of traffic in \n7. \nthe  construction  area,  (ii)  increased  air  pollution  due  to  dust  and  other  volatile  chemical \nsubstances  from  the  asphalt  plant,  (iii)  noise  and  vibration,  (iv)  disruption  of  the  water  system \ndue  to  cutting  and  filling  and  other  earth  works,  (v)  potential  erosion  and  landslides  due  to \nelevation  of  some  part  of  the  road,  and  (vi)  impacts  due  to  disposal  of  construction  wastes.  \nThese  impacts  will  be  limited  to  the  construction  period  and  are  thus  manageable.  Mitigation \nmeasures include (i) rerouting the traffic with clear signs, (ii) maintaining the optimum moisture \ncontent during handling of soil, spraying water to minimize dust, and maintaining a safe distance \nbetween  the  asphalt  plant  and  public  facilities,  including  schools,  (iii)  strictly  controlling  the \nconstruction works that create noise and vibration by prohibiting night works in residential areas, \n(iv) pumping stagnant water away, and providing an adequate drainage system, (v) prohibiting \nthe  asphalt  plant  from  being  built  near  forests  and  residential  areas,  (vi)  stabilizing  road \nembankment side slopes, (vii) confining stage construction in flood areas to the dry season, and \n(viii)  avoiding  road  widening  at  pond  sites.  These  measures  will  be  required  in  contractors\u2019 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\ncontracts.  Borrow  pits  in  fertile  agriculture  lands  and  in  areas  prone  to  erosion  and  landslides \nwill be restricted. Former borrow pit areas will be restored and rehabilitated. \n \n8. \n The  environmental  impacts  associated  with  project  operation  are  (i)  increased  air \npollution and noise, and (ii) increased accidents. To address these problems, physical barriers \nwill be established and good road signs installed.  \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nE. \n \n9. \nThe environmental management and monitoring plans (EMMP) were prepared as part of \nthe  IEE  study  for  all  road  sections  in  this  investment  component.  On  this  basis,  it  was \nrecommended that the Environmental and Social Development Unit be responsible for ensuring \nthat  the  bidding  documents  and  contract  clearly  define  environmental  responsibilities  and \npenalties  for  noncompliance.  Contractors  will  implement  mitigation  measures  during  the \nconstruction.  The  project  engineer  for  each  road  section  will  check  that  the  contractors  do  so. \nThe state\u2019s Department of Forestry will plant trees. NHAI will implement the EMMP to mitigate \nthe Project\u2019s environmental impacts.  \n \nF. \n \nThe  IEE  study  shows  that  the  Project  will  significantly  reduce  vehicle  operating  costs, \n10. \nincrease jobs during construction, and reduce traffic congestion. However, the Project will also \nhave negative environmental impacts. The IEE thus recommends taking measures to minimize \nthem.  It  identifies  the  project  area  as  not  environmentally  sensitive  and  a  full  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  study  is  thus  not  required.  NHAI  assures  that  no  civil  works  will  be \ncarried out before clearance from the Department of Forestry on tree cutting. Monitoring will be \ncontinuous.  Total  cost  for  implementing  the  EMMP,  including  mitigation  measures  and  tree \ncompensation, is approximately $2.1 million  \n  \nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n11. \nOverall, the IEE found that the Project will not cause significant environmental problems. \nPotential  adverse  impacts  are  temporary  and,  thus,  manageable.  They  will  not  affect  any \nenvironmentally  sensitive  area,  and  a  full  EIA  study  is,  therefore,  not  required.  The  EMMP  is \nsufficiently detailed and provides enforceable actions to be undertaken by NHAI to mitigate the \nimpacts and maintain environmental quality during project operation. \n\n \n\n\fA.

In 1995, NHAI\u2019s \nmandate was limited to implementing Asian Development Bank (ADB)-assisted works for a total \nof  333  kilometers  (km)  of  highway.  From  1995  to  1998,  the  Ministry  of  Surface  Transport \nentrusted  other  projects  to  NHAI.  In  1998,  its  mandate  was  significantly  enlarged  when  the \nagency  was  entrusted  with  the  National  Highways  Development  Project  (NHDP).  It  is  an \nambitious  road  building  program  with  two  major  components:  (i)  the  5,952  km  Golden \nQuadrilateral,  which  connects  Delhi,  Mumbai,  Chennai,  and  Calcutta;  and  (ii)  the  7,300  km \nNorth-South  and  East-West  corridors  connecting  Srinagar-Kanya  Kumari  and  Silchar-\nPorbandar.  Responsible  now  for  NHDP  and  upgrading  1,000  km  of  road  linkages  to  India\u2019s \nmajor ports, NHAI has authority over a 14,000 km network of national highways. \n \nB.  \n \nAs  defined  in  the  National  Highway  Authority  of  India  Act  of  1988,  which  legally \n2. \nconstituted  NHAI, \nthe  \u201cdevelopment,  maintenance,  and \nis \nmanagement of national highways\u201d (and any other highways vested in or entrusted to it by the \nGovernment). The act defines NHAI as a \u201cbody corporate\u201d with the power to \u201cacquire, hold, and \ndispose of property, to contract and to sue and be sued.\u201d \n \nIn  the  discharge  of  its  functions,  NHAI  will  act,  \u201cso  far  as  may  be,  on  business \n3. \nprinciples.\u201d With the consent of the central Government, NHAI may (i) \u201cborrow money from any \nsource by the issue of bonds, debentures or such instruments as it may deem fit for discharging \nany  of  its  functions\u201d;  (ii)  \u201cform  one  or  more  companies  (under  the  Companies  Act  1956)  to \nfurther the efficient discharge of its functions\u201d; (iii) engage or entrust any of its functions to any \ncorporation or body corporate owned or controlled by the Government; and (iv) collect fees on \nbehalf  of  the  central  Government  (and  state  government)  for  services  or  benefits  rendered \nunder  section  7  of  the  National  Highways  Act  of  1956  on  terms  and  conditions  as  may  be \nspecified by such governments.  \n \n4. \nThe act enables the Government, with notification in the Official Gazette, to supersede \nNHAI for such period not exceeding 1 year. The act also requires that NHAI comply with central \nGovernment orders (i) on such directions on questions of policy; (ii) on contract form or contract \nvalues that exceed such value or amount as prescribed by the central Government; and (iii) on \ninstruction to entrust the development, maintenance, or management of any national highway or \na part thereof, to such person as may be specified by the central Government.  \n \nC.  \n \n5. \nNHAI\u2019s  management  board  consists  of  \u201ca  Chairman,  not  more  than  five  full-time \nmembers  and  not  more  than  four  part-time  members,\u201d  to  be  appointed  by  the  central \nGovernment with their term of office, remuneration level, and other conditions of service therein \nprescribed. NHAI is to \u201cappoint such number of officers and other employees as it may consider \nnecessary on such terms and conditions as may be laid down by [its] regulations.\u201d \n \n6. \nNHAI\u2019s  management  board  is  composed  of  four  full-time  members:  for  administration, \nfinance,  technical  matters,  and  private  investment;  and  four  part-time  members:  secretaries  of \n\nCorporate Structure and Staffing Level \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n49\n\nthe  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways  (MORTH),  Ministry  of  Planning,  Ministry  of \nExpenditure,  and  Director  General  for  Roads  Department  of  MORTH.  NHAI\u2019s  operations  are \norganized on two tiers: the head office and the project implementation unit. The head office has \n10 departments and or divisions: administration, finance and accounts, information technology \nand  planning,  vigilance,  technical,  corridor  management,  East-West  Corridor,  North-South \nCorridor,  World  Bank  projects,  and  private  investment.  Forty-six  PIUs  have  been  established \nacross the country, each reporting to its regional technical department: five support ADB project \nactivities  (Chitradurga,  Durgapur,  Gurgaon,  Valsad,  and  Vijayawada);  six  support  World  Bank \nproject  activities  (Agra,  Allahabad,  Kanpur,  Koderma,  Trichy,  and  Varanasi);  and  four  support \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  project  activities  (Bhubaneswar,  Ghaziabad, \nGuntar, and Naini). \n \nAs of the beginning of FY2003, NHAI had 530 full-time employees: 126 (24%) regular, \n7. \n270  (51%)  on  deputation  from  various  government  departments;  and  134  (25%)  hired  on  a \ncontract basis. The head office has a staff of 235: 96 professional and 139 support. PIUs have a \ntotal of 295 staff: 182 professional and 113 support. At the head office, the administration and \nfinance departments employ 49 staff each, with the technical departments employing the rest. \nThe number of PIU staff depends on the unit's workload, with an average of six staff per PIU. \n \n8. \nNHAI  has  issued  to  the  end  of  FY2002  87  contracts  valued  at  Rs170.8  billion  to  build \nhighways: 78 are for construction (Rs144.6 billion), 4 for build-operate-transfer (Rs15.2 billion), \nand 5 for special-purpose vehicles (Rs11.0 billion).  \n\nPast ADB Assistance to the National Highways Authority of India  \n\n9. \nAt the end of FY2002, NHAI will manage and maintain the 1,881 km of highway it has \ncompleted. NHAI has issued four maintenance contracts of Rs53 million to maintain 486 km of \nnational highways.  \n \nD.  \n \n10. \nADB  provided  a  $180-million  loan  for  the  Surat-Manor  Tollway  (SMT)  Project  in  2000, \nand a $240-million loan for the Western Transport Corridor (WTC) Project in 2001. Both loans \nhelped NHAI upgrade the Golden Quadrilateral. The SMT Project covered 180 km from Surat to \nManor; and the WTC Project, 259 km from Tumkur to Haveri. Civil works contracts have already \nbeen awarded for both projects, with expected time of completion in 2004 for the SMT Project \nand 2005 for the WTC Project.  \n \nThe SMT and WTC projects both have three study and or capacity-building components \n11. \nand  one  technical  assistance  (TA):  (i)  development  of  a  concession  agreement  for  road \noperation and maintenance (to start soon); (ii) toll system study (now selecting consultants); (iii) \nenvironmental  management  training  (not  started  yet,  but  agreement  secured  during  the \nappraisal  meeting  for  early  training);  and  (iv)  study  to  enhance  corporate  financing  capability \n(two  of  four  components  have  already  been  undertaken  as  a  part  of  the  other  exercises).  A \ncomputer model has been developed for financial planning and subsequent development of an \ninvestment strategy under the ongoing project preparatory technical assistance arrangement for \nthe  National  Highway  Corridor  \u2014Public-Private  Partnership\u2014  Project.  Phase-2  activities  have \ncommenced  as  a  part  of  the  World  Bank-financed  Institutional  Strengthening  Study,  with  its \nterms of reference modified to incorporate ADB\u2019s. Because of these changes, the team intends \nto  seek  management  approval  to  modify  the  scope  of  the  study  separately  from  this  Project. \nEfforts  will  be  made  to  ensure  the  early  initiation  and  completion  of  the  studies  and  capacity-\nbuilding exercises. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2002) \n \nrupee/s (Re/Rs) \n\u2013 \n$0.0207 \n= \n=  R48.39 \n", "Currency Unit \nRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "In  this  report,  an  exchange  rate  prevailing  during  fact-finding  \uf8e7$1.00  = \n", "Rs49.00\uf8e7 was used for calculation purposes.  \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \nADB \n \nBLT \n \nBOT \n \nCMU \n \nCRF \n \nEIA \nEIRR \n \nEMMP  \nESDU   \n \nE-W \nFIRR \n \nGAAP   \n \nGRC \n \nIEE \n \nIPDP \nIPSA \n \n \nIRI \nLIBOR  \nMORTH \nNACO   \n \nNGO \nNH \n \nNHAI    \nNHDP   \n \nN-S \n \nO&M \n \nPIB \n \nPIU \n \nPPP \n \nSBE \n \nSMT \n \nSPV \n \nTOR \n \nWTC \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nbuild-lease-transfer \nbuild-operate-transfer \ncorridor management unit \ncentral road fund \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management and monitoring plans \nEnvironment and Social Development Unit \nEast-West Corridor \nfinancial internal rates of return \ngenerally accepted accounting practices \ngrievance redressal committee \ninitial environmental examination \nindigenous people development plan \ninitial poverty and social analysis \ninternational roughness index \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMinistry of Road Transport and Highways \nNational Aids Control Organization \nnon-government organization \nnational highway \nNational Highways Authority of India \nNational Highways Development Program \nNorth-South Corridor \noperation and maintenance \nPublic Investment Board \nproject implementation unit \npublic private partnership \nsmall business enterprise \nSurat-Manor Tollway Project \nspecial purpose vehicle \nterms of reference \nWestern Transport Corridor Project \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n"]}
