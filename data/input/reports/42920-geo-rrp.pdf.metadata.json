Bank  Republic  has  identified  the  development  of  the \nSME sector in Georgia as a key objective in its business strategy, \nin  addition  to  its  being  central  to  the  recovery  of  the  economy  in \nthe aftermath of the armed conflict with the Russian Federation in \nAugust  2008  and  the  global  economic  downturn.  The  proposed \nloan  will  be  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  for  commercial \nrisks by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Bank Republic\u2019s majority owner. \n \nBank  Republic  is  among  the  oldest  privately  owned  banks  in \nGeorgia, and was founded as a joint-stock company in 1991. It is \nthe  third-largest  bank  in  Georgia,  with  total  assets  of  GEL756 \nmillion ($451 million) as of 30 June 2009. The bank has a network \nof  26  branches  and  19  service  centers  which  provide  a  range  of \nretail, corporate, and financial services products. Bank Republic is \n60%  owned  by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  (among  the  leading  European \nfinancial services companies), which acquired its shares in 2006. \nIn  the  same  year,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment acquired a 10% shareholding in the bank.  \n \nADB\u2019s  proposed  loan  will  support  the  growth  of  the  emerging \nbanking sector in Georgia and increase SME access to financing. \nThis  will  be  achieved  through  relatively  long-term  funding  (a  4-\nyear  loan)  for  SME  lending  by  Bank  Republic,  to  enable  it  to \nexpand its loan portfolio. \n \n(i) \n\nImpact.  The  transaction  will  (a)  provide  systemic  support \nto  the  Georgian  banking  sector  at  a  critical  point  in  its \ndevelopment and help to renew confidence in the country's \nbanking  system,  (b)  allow  Bank  Republic  to  increase \nfinancial intermediation in line with its strategic plans, and \n(c) contribute to private sector development in Georgia by \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nhelping  to  mobilize  liquidity  and  channel  it  towards  the \nmost  productive  investments  through  the  extension  of \ncredit. \n \nOutcome.  With  the  help  of  debt  funding  from  ADB,  Bank \nRepublic  will  renew \nlending  activities,  which  will \ncontribute  to  increasing  confidence  in  the  banking  sector, \nand  provide  increased,  sustainable  access  to  finance  to \nSMEs in Georgia.  \n \nOutputs.  Bank  Republic  will  use  the  proceeds  of  the \nsenior loan from ADB to expand its SME loan portfolio.  \n\nits \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nADB  will  provide  a  dollar-denominated  senior  loan  of  up  to  $20 \nmillion to Bank Republic for up to 4 years, with a grace period of 1 \nyear, an availability period of 1 year, and semiannual repayments. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  sourced  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  and  will  carry  an  interest  rate  based  on  the  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  plus  a  margin  determined  by  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment  committee.  The  committee  will  also  determine  the  up-\nfront and commitment fees. The proposed loan will be unsecured \nbut  it  will  be  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  (subject  to \ncertain  political  risk  exclusions)  by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,  Bank \nRepublic\u2019s majority shareholder. \n \nComprehensive  due  diligence  conducted  by  ADB  to  gauge  the \nviability of the proposed investment determined the risks overall to \nbe  acceptable  for  a  transaction  of  this  kind.  The  main  risks \nidentified were (i) political instability, both regionally and internally; \n(ii) political violence; (iii) declining macroeconomic conditions; (iv) \nweak banking and financial sector; (v) deteriorating asset quality; \n(vi) low capitalization; and (vii) increasing competition. \n \nThe identified risks are mitigated by the following considerations: \n(i)  the  risk  of  payment  default  is  unconditionally  and  irrevocably \nguaranteed  by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,  subject  to  certain  political  risk \nexclusions; (ii) the range of political risk exposure retained by ADB \nunder  this  transaction  is  to  some  degree  mitigated  by  ADB's \nrelationship  with  the  Government  of  Georgia;  and  (iii)  Bank \nRepublic has strong shareholder support. \n \nJustification for the loan is based on the following considerations: \n \n(i) \n\nSystemic  support  for  Georgian  banking  sector.  The \nthe \nloan  will  provide  systemic  support \nproposed \nGeorgian  banking  sector  at  a  critical  point \nits \ndevelopment and help to renew confidence in the country\u2019s \nbanking  system.  Lending  activity  among  the  banks  in \nGeorgia  has  all  but  stopped  as  a  consequence  of  the \nconflict  and  global  crisis.  As  banks  are  a  key  source  of \nsmall  and  micro  loans  for  the  private  sector,  in  particular \n\nto \nin \n\n \nProposed ADB \nAssistance \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating \nMeasures \n\n \nJustification / ADB Value \nAdded \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nfor individual entrepreneurs and SMEs, they are crucial to \nthe recovery of the Georgian economy. \n\nIncrease  access  to  SME  financing.

This  will  in  turn  help  to \nexpand the SME sector itself, which is a main force behind \neconomic growth in Georgia and contributes significantly to \nemployment creation.   \n\nsupport \n\nfrom  other \n\nCatalyze foreign funds into Georgia. In conjunction with \nfinancial \nmarket \ninstitutions,  ADB's  proposed  loan  will  provide  a  signal  of \nconfidence in the underlying fundamentals of the Georgian \neconomy and the banking sector during the current period \nof  uncertainty  and  help  to  catalyze  a  return  of  foreign \ninvestment into the country.   \n\ninternational \n\nSupport of foreign investment.

The commercial risks associated with the proposed loan \nwill  be  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,  the  majority  shareholder  of \nBank  Republic.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1  and  the  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nEconomic and Sector Background \n\nA. \n \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Overview \n\n2. \nThe  Georgian  economy  experienced  unprecedented  growth  during  2003\u20132007  as  a \nresult of macroeconomic stabilization, structural reform, and economic liberalization measures.1 \nDramatic  improvements  in  the  business  environment  and  massive  inflows  of  foreign  direct \ninvestment  fueled  Georgia's  economic  growth,  particularly  in  nontradable  sectors  such  as \nfinancial services and construction. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of \n9.7%  during  this  period,  peaking  in 2007  with  growth  of  12.4%  (Table  1).  Georgia\u2019s  economic \nperformance  during  this  time  also  benefited  from  stronger  public  finances  as  a  result  of  tax \nreforms, anticorruption efforts, and the reduction of the shadow economy.  \n \n3. \nThe underpinnings of economic growth and stability in Georgia, however, were shaken \nas a result of the twin crises which occurred in 2008. In August 2008, tensions with the Russian \nFederation reached a climax when armed conflict broke out between the two countries over the \nregions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Although brief, the economic disruption caused by this \nconflict, when combined with the onset of the global financial downturn in the autumn of 2008, \nadversely  impacted  the  Georgian  economy.  Before  the  conflict  and  exogenous  economic \nshocks,  GDP  growth  was  forecast  to  be  8%\u20139%  for  both  2008  and  2009.  In  the  aftermath, \noverall  growth  was  dampened  by  the  damage  to  infrastructure  and  the  disruption  in  several \nsectors of the economy including construction and transportation. Increased security concerns \neroded  confidence  and  resulted  in  temporary  deposit  withdrawals  from  banks,  depreciation \npressures,  and  a  slowdown  in  bank  lending.  The  global  economic  downturn  led  to  a  further \nslowdown in foreign direct investment and a drying up of private international borrowing, which \ncontinued through the first half of 2009. The situation was further aggravated by the decline in \nremittances, a slowdown in Georgia's export markets, and the curtailing of lending by Georgian \nbanks. As a result, GDP growth dropped to 2.1% in 2008 and is forecast to contract by 4.0% in \n2009  before  returning  to  growth,  albeit  sluggish  at  2.0%,  in  2010.  Medium-term  growth  is \nexpected  to  rise  gradually  to  5.0%,  although  projections  are  predicated  on  the  size  of  the \neconomic contraction in 2009, the timing and pace of economic recovery, and the resumption of \nprivate capital flows (Appendix 4 has more detailed economic analysis).  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Georgia was named the number 1 reformer among 181 economies by the World Bank in its 2007 Doing Business \nsurvey  and  according  to  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  the  country  was  the \nthird-lowest  in  corruption  in  2007.  Continued  efforts  have  further  boosted  Georgia\u2019s  ranking  in  the  2008  Doing \nBusiness survey, rising to 18th from 37th in 2006. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Georgia Economic Indicators, 2003\u20132008  \n\n4.8 \n\n2005 \n\n2004 \n\n2003 \n\n9.8 \n5.1 \n5.9 \n\n8.6 \n4.0 \n11.1 \n\n11.6 \n6.4 \n9.6 \n\nItem \nGDP at market prices (GEL billion) \nGDP ($ billion) \nReal GDP growth (%) \nConsumer price inflation, average \n(%) \nPopulation (million) \nExports of goods, FOB ($ million) \nImports of goods, FOB ($ million) \nCurrent account balance ($ million) \nForeign exchange reserves, \nexcluding gold ($ million) \n483 \nForeign direct investment ($ million) \n2,088 \nTotal external debt ($ million) \n16.6a \nDebt-service ratio, paid (%) \nExchange rate, average (GEL:$) \n1.92 \n( ) = negative, FOB = free on board, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Economist Intelligence Unit, Fitch Ratings, Georgia Department of Statistics. \n\n4.6 \n830.5 \n(1,468.7) \n(383.6) \n\n4.5 \n1,092.1 \n(2,007.6) \n(420.7) \n\n4.5 \n1,472.4 \n(2,686.6) \n(762.7) \n\n542 \n2,657 \n\n331 \n2,035 \n\n14.8 \n1.81 \n\n478.6 \n\n196.2 \n\n386.7 \n\n14.5 \n\n2.15 \n\n8.3 \n\n5.7 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nBanking Sector \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n13.8 \n7.7 \n9.4 \n\n9.2 \n\n4.4 \n1,666.6 \n(3,685.9) \n(1,235.4) \n\n930.8 \n\n1,076 \n3,503 \n14.4 \n\n1.78 \n\n16.5 \n9.8 \n12.4 \n\n9.2 \n\n2008 \n19.1 \n12.8 \n2.1 \n\n10.0 \n\n4.4 \n2,104.3 \n(4,976.5) \n(2,043.9) \n\n4.3 \n2,427.9 \n(6,261.2) \n(3,169.9) \n\n1,361.2 \n\n1,480.2 \n\n2,015 \n4,243 \n16.0 \n1.67 \n\n1,564 \n7,711 \n \n1.49 \n\nGeneral.

The \nbanking sector is fully privatized and all leading banks have foreign capital participation. Foreign \nbanks such as HSBC, Halyk, Privat, and JSC Kor Bank have also established a local presence \nin the market.

The potential for market growth is emphasized by the comparatively low ratios of \ngross loans to GDP (29.1%) and deposits to GDP (14.7%), recorded as of year-end 2008. \n\n6. \nCrisis period. The conflict with the Russian Federation in August 2008 caused a short \ndisruption  in  banking  activity.  However,  the  short  duration  of  military  hostilities  and  National \nBank of Georgia (NBG) action were sufficient to maintain the stability of the sector, despite a run \non deposits. Pressure was contained and confidence in the system was supported, largely as a \nresult of NBG measures, which included (i) initially pegging the lari to the dollar, (ii) setting limits \non  deposit  withdrawals  (declaring  a  bank  holiday),  and  (iii)  activating  an  uncollateralized  lari \nbank  lending  facility.  Although  the  run  on  deposits  lasted  only  10  days,  deposits  continued  to \ndecline, albeit at a slower pace, throughout the fourth quarter of 2008 and into the first quarter of \n2009, as the disruption of many business operations necessitated a number of both corporate \nentities and individuals to tap their savings. \n \n7. \nAside  from  NBG  action,  international  financial  aid  was  also  instrumental  in  maintaining \nfinancial stability in Georgia, particularly following the European Union\u2013World Bank Conference \nin  Brussels  in  October  2008  when  more  than  $4.5  billion  was  pledged  to  aid  infrastructure \nreconstruction  and  social  assistance.  The  NBG's  measures  were  subsequently  suspended  as \nthe  situation  normalized.  After  removing  the  peg  to  the  dollar,  the  NBG  allowed  the  lari  to \ndevalue  by  around  10%  in  November  2008,  and  has  since  defended  the  new  exchange  rate. \nPressure on the exchange rate has eased off and has been fairly comfortably managed with the \nsupport of a $726 million International Monetary Fund (IMF) facility. \n \n8. \nSector  performance.  Key  performance  indicators  in  the  Georgian  banking  sector \nimproved significantly during 2005\u20132007, in line with overall economic growth in Georgia (Table \n2).  Credit  grew  on  average  by  68.4%  during  this  time,  while  nonbank  deposits  increased  on \naverage  by  49.3%.  Net  income  also  strengthened.  Such  improvement  continued  through  the \nfirst half of 2008, but abated following the difficulties in the second half of the year. The rate of \ngrowth  in  2008  was  substantially  lower  for  both  aggregate  loans  (which  rose  by  30.6%)  and \ndeposits (which rose by 11.0%), and the sector recorded an aggregate net loss. During the first \nhalf of 2009, the sector actually contracted as aggregated total assets declined (falling by 12.8% \nfrom year-end 2008) and lending activity slowed significantly (decreasing by 10.4%). \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Georgia Banking Sector Aggregate Figures \n(GEL million) \n\nItem \nTotal assets \n\nTotal loans \n\nNonperforming loans \n\nNonbank deposits \n\nEquity capital \n\nNet profit \n\n \n\nRatios (%) \n\nCapital adequacy ratio  \nNonperforming \nloans/total loans \nSpecific provisions/total \nloans \nLiquidity ratiob \nReturn on assets  \n\nReturn of equity  \n\n2005 \n2,548 \n\n1,730 \n\n65 \n\n1,310 \n\n479 \n\n 62 \n\n \n\n \n\n17.5 \n\n3.8 \n\n2.1 \n\n34.9 \n\n3.0 \n\n15.1 \n\n2006 \n\n4,228 \n\n2,681 \n\n68 \n\n2,097 \n\n898 \n\n93 \n\n \n\n \n\n20.6 \n\n2.5 \n\n1.3 \n\n34.2 \n\n2.7 \n\n15.7 \n\n2007 \n7,208 \n\n4,589 \n\n121 \n\n3,215 \n\n1,471 \n\n109 \n\n \n\n \n\n16.0 \n\n2.6 \n\n1.3 \n\n28.2 \n\n1.9 \n\n9.7 \n\n2008 \n8,866 \n\n5,993 \n\n766 \n\n3,568 \n\n1,517 \n\n(216) \n\n \n\n \n\n13.9 \n\n12.8 \n\n6.0 \n\n28.3 \n\n(2.6) \n\n(12.6) \n\n31 Mar \n2009a \n8,241 \n\n5,661 \n\n859 \n\n3,104 \n\n1,496 \n\n(29) \n\n \n\n \n\n15.2 \n\n15.2 \n\n7.5 \n\n30.8 \n\n(1.4) \n\n(7.6) \n\n30 Jun \n2009a \n7,729 \n\n5,367 \n\n1,008 \n\n3,316 \n\n1,534 \n\n    (64) \n\n \n\n \n\n17.6 \n\n18.8 \n\n  9.4 \n\n31.4 \n\n  (1.6) \n\n  (8.4) \n\n( ) = negative. \na Quarterly data. \nb Liquidity ratio = liquid assets < 1 month / total assets. \nSources: National Bank of Georgia and Georgian Financial Supervisory Agency. \n \n9. \nNotwithstanding  the  difficulties  brought  about  by  the  twin  crises,  the  Georgian  banking \nsector  has  shown  a  degree  of  resilience,  helped  by  external  financial  support  which  has \nunderpinned  bank  capitalization  and  liquidity.  However,  asset  quality  across  the  sector  has \ndeteriorated  quite  significantly  and  there  is  continued  uncertainty  about  the  deposit  base.  The \naggregate  ratio  of  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  to  total  loans  has  increased  by  4.9  times  from \n2.6% as of year-end 2007 to 12.8% in 2008, and further increased to 18.8% as of 30 June 2009. \nSo  far,  domestic  currency  loans  have  been  disproportionately  affected,  but  stress  testing \nindicates the vulnerability of the loan portfolio to further exchange rate depreciation. Despite a \nslight increase in deposits registered in the fourth quarter of 2008, following a sharp fall in the \nthird quarter, the volume of bank deposits fell again in the first quarter of 2009, according to the \nNBG,  registering  a  year-on-year  contraction  of  6%  and  a  quarter-on-quarter  fall  of  14%.  Early \nindications,  however,  suggest  that  deposits  may  have  stabilized  during  the  second  quarter  of \n2009,  despite  the  ongoing  economic  contraction.  Banking  sector  deposits  increased  modestly \nduring this period by 6.8% quarter-on-quarter, yet continued strengthening is unclear.  \n \nFaced with these circumstances, and with little prospect for additional recapitalization in \n10. \nthe short term, banks have continued to build up precautionary balances. Although the banks\u2019 \ncautious  attitude  to  lending  has  had  prudential  benefits,  giving  way  to  increased  liquidity  and \nimproved loan\u2013deposit ratios, it has also placed additional strains on the economy. \n\n11. \nSupervision.  In  March  2008,  the  government  adopted  the  Global  Competitiveness  of \nthe Financial Services Sector Act that triggered broad changes in 26 other laws and aimed to \nenhance the stability and global competitiveness of the Georgian financial sector. Most notably, \nunder  this  act,  the  Financial  Services  Agency  was  established  as  an  autonomous  agency \ntasked  with  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  control  of  the  banking  sector.  Although  newly \ncreated, it is intended that the Financial Services Agency will be merged back into the NBG to \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\nconsolidate supervision of the entire financial sector under one entity (draft legislation is being \nconsidered  by  the  parliament).  The  strengthening  of  regulatory  and  supervisory  control  under \nthe  NBG  was  undertaken  as  a  means  to  address  certain  vulnerabilities  in  the  banking  sector \nbrought about by the twin crises to potential exchange rate shocks, declining real estates prices, \nand  the  possibility  of  a  longer  and  deeper  recession.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nthrough  its  Central  and  West  Asia  Department,  is  providing  key  technical  assistance  to  the \nFinancial Services Agency and NBG, as well as programmatic backup support to assist in the \nefforts of banking sector restructuring. \n\n3. \n\nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector: Binding Constraints on Small \nand Medium-Sized Enterprise Development \n\n \nIn most developing countries, SMEs are the main source of employment and economic \n12. \ngrowth, acting as an important engine of growth and a key contributor to poverty reduction by \ncreating employment, increasing individual incomes, and generating tax revenues. The situation \nin  Georgia,  however,  is  notably  different.  Although  SMEs  are  the  most  common  type  of \nenterprise,3 \nlarge  privatized  enterprises  dominate  output  and  employment.  The \nunderdevelopment of the SME sector is apparent in statistics from Georgia\u2019s statistical bureau, \nwhich  reveal  that,  as  of  the  first  half  of  2009,  small  enterprises  (broadly  defined  as  having  an \naverage of up to 20 employees and turnover which does not exceed GEL500,000 per annum) \nemployed only 13% of workers and medium-sized enterprises (defined as having an average of \nup to 100 employees and turnover which does not exceed GEL1,500,000 per annum) employed \nonly 14% of workers, while large enterprises (defined as having an average of more than 100 \nemployees and turnover which exceeds GEL1,500,000 per annum) employed over 72% (Table \n3).4 This disparity is echoed in the respective contributions of large versus small and medium-\nsized businesses to the economy; in the first half of 2009, large businesses contributed almost \n90% of output, while SMEs made up approximately 10% (Table 4).5 \n \n\nTable 3: Number of Employed Persons in Enterprises, by Size of Enterprise \n(%) \n\nYear \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \nQ1 2009 \nQ2 2009 \n\nLarge \n64.3 \n66.8 \n65.3 \n61.4 \n63.9 \n68.1 \n70.1 \n73.1 \n72.1 \n\nMedium \n18.8 \n16.7 \n17.7 \n19.4 \n17.7 \n17.8 \n14.4 \n14.1 \n14.0 \n\nSmall \n16.9 \n16.5 \n17.0 \n19.2 \n18.4 \n14.1 \n15.5 \n12.8 \n13.9 \n\nNote:  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are currently not defined \nunder  Georgian  law.

In \n2006, the IFC implemented the Georgia Business Enabling Environment Project, which aimed \nto improve the business enabling environment in Georgia by reducing administrative barriers to \nrunning and operating small businesses. The project focused on streamlining the process and \nintroducing  elements  of  regulatory  impact  assessment.  In  the  same  year,  the  IFC  also \nimplemented  the  Georgia  Corporate  Governance  Project,  which  worked  to  improve  the \ncorporate governance practices of Georgian joint-stock companies and banks, thereby helping \nthem to operate more effectively and allowing them easier access to capital. These programs, \ncoupled with the EBRD's efforts to stimulate economic growth through support for microfinance \nand SME development through its Early Transition Countries Initiative and other Government of \nGeorgia  initiatives,  have  substantially  reduced  the  administrative  burden  for  enterprises  and \nlimited  the  amount  of  time  spent  dealing  with  government  bureaucracy.7  Despite  this,  SME \ndevelopment has been hampered by financing difficulties.  \n \n14. \nIn  most  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs),  SMEs  have  difficulty  gaining \naccess to financial services and securing financing. Although bank loans are the dominant form \nof external financing, few SMEs in the region have access to bank lending (and mostly only for \nworking  capital).  Lack  of  access  to  bank  lending  is  considered  in  most  DMCs  as  the  main \nfinancing difficulty and a stumbling block to the sustained growth of SMEs. As seen in Figure 2, \nthe situation in Georgia is no different.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6  Georgian \nDaily. \nItemid=73. \n\nAvailable: \n\nhttp://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4122& \n\n7  This is evidenced by Georgia's top regional ranking among Eastern European and Central Asian countries in terms \nof the ease in doing business in the World Bank's Doing Business 2009 report and the country's number 6 global \nranking in the World Economic Forum's 2008\u201309 Global Competitiveness Report in terms of the ease in complying \nwith administrative requirements. \n\n\f7\n\nFigure 2: Constraints to Firm Investment \n\n \n(% of firms identifying problem as their greatest obstacle) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Enterprise Surveys Website (2008). \n\n15. \nGrowth  in  the  SME  sector  has  been  severely  curtailed  by  these  financing  constraints, \nwhich have been further exacerbated by the events in the latter part of 2008. As Table 5 shows, \nonly  17%  of  bank  lending  in  2007  went  to  SMEs,  and  by  September  2008  this  figure  had \nincreased  only  slightly,  to  21%.8  The  problem  derives  in  part  from  constraints  on  the  SMEs \nthemselves,  such  as  their  lack  of  collateral,  proper  bookkeeping,  and  financial  reporting. \nAnother problem is the high demand for bank credit, which far outstrips the supply from banks, \nmany  of  which  have  traditionally  shown  a  risk-averse  bias  to  SME  lending.  The  World  Bank \nnotes that access to banks is a problem for SMEs and larger companies alike; of the 12 regions \nin Georgia, half have fewer than one bank branch for every 100,000 citizens.9 Georgian banks \nhave  started  to  look  increasingly  at  the  SME  sector  as  a  promising  business  opportunity\u2014\nparticularly  in  the  aftermath  of  the  conflict  and  global  crisis\u2014given  the  relative  resilience  of \nSMEs  (based  on  borrower  performance);  this  is  a  strategic  move  that  is  well  aligned  with  the \neconomic needs of the country, as well as with the main drivers of economic growth (agriculture, \nmachinery, etc.), which are often led by SMEs. \n\n                                                 \n8  Data provided via email by Nika Chlaidze of the Financial Services Authority. \n9  World Bank.

Based on those meetings, PSCM selected four banks from among the top seven \nfor  consideration  based  on  their  financial  condition,  business  focus,  and  expressed  need  for \nfunding\u2014Bank of Georgia, People\u2019s Bank of Georgia, TBC, and Bank Republic.  \n \n17. \nIn  the  aftermath  of  the  Russian  conflict  and  the  global  economic  downturn,  lending \nactivity  in  the  Georgian  banking  sector  has  been  severely  curtailed  as  funding  sources  have \ndwindled. In view of the need for lending activities to resume in order to assist in the recovery of \nthe  real  economy,  PSCM  has  considered  possible  interventions.  Two  such  interventions  are \nbeing investigated\u2014a new facility to Bank Republic and another loan to Bank of Georgia, given \ntheir presence in the market, extensive distribution networks, and established track record with \ncommercial and SME lending.  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency  with  ADB's  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020) \n\n18. \nDevelopment  of  the  financial  sector  is  essential  to  ensuring  sustainable  private-sector-\nled  economic  growth.  Moreover,  without  access  to  formal  financial  services  and  sustainable \nsocial insurance (including pensions), the poor will be excluded from the growth process and its \nbenefits. Under Strategy 202010, ADB seeks to strengthen its support to the financial sector at \nthe  regional  and  national  levels  by  helping  to  develop  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and \nproducts  and  services.  To  promote  inclusive  growth,  it  will  seek  to  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for microfinance, rural finance institutions, and SMEs, and  will explore the use of \ntechnologies  to  expand  the  reach  of  the  formal  financial  system  to  rural  areas.  Through  such \ninitiatives,  ADB  will  continue  to  assist  in  channeling  the  region's  savings  into  the  most \nproductive investments\u2014in particular, development of the capital markets\u2014as well as continue \nto  build  the  capacity  of  financial  institutions  by  introducing  international  best  practices.  The \nproposed loan will provide systemic support for the Georgian banking sector by contributing to \nthe  renewal  of  lending  activities,  notably  to  SMEs,  which  is  an  essential  component  of  the \ncountry's economic recovery and is directly in line with Strategy 2020.  \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB.  2008.

The  proposed  intervention  is  in  keeping \nwith  this  strategy,  as  the  loan  to  Bank  Republic  will  support  private  sector  development  by \nincreasing access to financing for SMEs. The proposed intervention also ties in to the recently \napproved Georgia Growth Recovery Support Program,12 which outlines current difficulties in the \nGeorgian  banking  sector  and  their  impact  on  the  broader  economy.  Again,  the  proposed  loan \nseeks  to  provide  systemic  support  to  the  Georgian  banking  sector  during  this  challenging \nperiod, not only by providing financing but also by building confidence in the broader financial \nsector.  \n \n \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy \n\n3. \n\nSupporting  financial  sector  development  is  a  key  focus  of  development  assistance  for \n20. \nADB,  in  line  with  the  tenets  detailed  in  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy13  and \nEnhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy,14 which note improved economic growth, stimulated by \nprivate sector investment, as a key contributing factor in reducing poverty. ADB\u2019s private sector \ndevelopment  strategy  refers  specifically  to  ADB's  role  in  strengthening  the  financial  sector  in \nDMCs.  The  strategy  notes  the  critical  importance  of  well-functioning  financial  systems  for  the \ndevelopment of the private sector, which in turn underpins sustainable economic growth. Many \nDMCs need to strengthen their financial institutions and create diversified financial markets that \ncan  finance  private-sector-led  growth.  ADB  has  supported  financial  sector  reform  programs \nthrough public sector operations and/or direct investments in financial intermediaries in several \nDMCs  through  its  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD).  The  proposed  ADB  loan  is \nconsistent with the overall sector strategy in that it will assist in the development of the Georgian \nbanking  sector  and  increase  access  to  financing  for  SMEs,  thereby  making  private  sector \ndevelopment  more  sustainable  and  ADB\u2019s  mission  of  poverty  reduction  more  achievable.  The \nproposed  loan  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy,  which  states  that  ADB \nseeks  to  promote  \u201csound  and  efficient  banking  systems  and  capital  markets,\u201d  since  these  are \nseen as \u201cindispensable for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing savings, and ensuring availability \nof long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor growth.\u201d \n \nD. \n \n \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\nImpact \n\n1. \n\n \nThe development impacts of the proposed transaction will include the following: \n\nSupport  for  Georgian  banking  sector.  The  proposed  intervention  will  provide \nsystemic  support  to  the  Georgian  banking  sector  at  a  critical  point  in  its \ndevelopment  and  help  to  renew  confidence  in  the  country\u2019s  banking  system. \nLending  activity  among  the  banks  in  Georgia  has  all  but  stopped  as  a \nconsequence of the conflict and global crisis.

SMEs  play  a  significant \nrole  in  all  of  ADB\u2019s  DMC  economies,  as  they  are  key  drivers  of  employment, \neconomic growth, and development. SME development is therefore an important \nengine  of  growth  and  a  key  contributor  to  poverty  reduction  through  the \nemployment, increase in individual incomes, and tax revenues it generates. The \nproposed assistance will allow Bank Republic to increase financial intermediation \nto SMEs, in line with its strategic plans and ADB's mission. \n\nPrivate  sector  development.  As  banks  are  a  key  source  of  small  and  micro \nloans  for  the  private  sector,  in  particular  to  individual  entrepreneurs  and  SMEs, \nthey  are  crucial  to  the  recovery  of  the  Georgian  economy.  The  proposed \nintervention will contribute to private sector development in Georgia by helping to \nmobilize liquidity and channel it towards the most productive investments through \nthe extension of credit. \n\n2. \n\nOutcome and Output \n\n \n\na. \n\nOutcome \n\n \n \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s debt funding will result in Bank Republic being able to renew its lending activities, \nwhich  will  contribute  to  increasing  confidence  in  the  banking  sector,  and  provide  increased, \nsustainable  access  to  finance  to  SMEs  in  Georgia  in  line  with  Bank  Republic's  strategic \nbusiness  objectives.  Indicators  of  this  include  the  following:  (i)  business  performance  of  the \nproject itself (commercial viability with example measures such as profitability, return on equity, \nnet  interest  margin,  and  asset  growth),  and  (ii)  economic  sustainability  (provision  of  financial \nservices to viable private enterprises and allocation of resources with example measures such \nas increasing lending to SMEs, asset quality, and disbursements in rural areas). \n \n \n \n23. \nto expand its SME loan portfolio. \n \n\nADB will provide a senior loan to Bank Republic, which will effectively use the proceeds \n\nOutput \n\nb. \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nFINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\n24. \nBank  Republic  is  a  closed  joint-stock  company,  which  was  established  in  1991  and \nincorporated in Georgia in 1992. The bank's primary business consists of commercial activities, \noriginating loans and guarantees, attracting customer deposits, and trading activities, which are \nprovided  by  the  bank  through  its  distribution  network  of  26  branches  and  19  service  centers \nthroughout  the  country.  As  of  30  June  2009,  Bank  Republic  was  the  third-largest  bank  in \nGeorgia  in  terms  of  assets,  with  GEL756.0  million  in  total  assets  and  a  loan  portfolio  of \nGEL557.6 million. Bank Republic\u2019s primary focus until 2005 was corporate banking, particularly \nserving  Georgia\u2019s  larger  corporations.  However,  since  its  acquisition  by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  in \n2006,  the  bank  has  sought  to  position  itself  better  in  the  market  and  make  the  transition  to \nuniversal banking, offering retail banking services and expanding its corporate banking activities \nto include SMEs. Bank Republic seeks to build on its presence in the Georgian banking sector \nand  gain  market  share  in  retail  and  SME  banking  by  leveraging  its  association  with  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \nG\u00e9n\u00e9rale and adopting international best practices in its operations.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\nOwnership \n\nA. \n \n25. \nIn  October  2006,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  acquired  a  60%  stake  in  Bank  Republic.

ADB is contemplating extending a senior loan of up to $20 million to Bank \nRepublic, with a tenor of up to 4 years, for the purpose of onlending to SMEs in Georgia. The \nloan  will  have  a  grace  period  of  1  year  and  an  availability  period  of  1  year  and  will  be  repaid \nsemiannually.  The  proposed  loan,  without  government  guarantee,  will  be  sourced  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources and will carry an interest rate based on the London interbank offered \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nrate plus a margin determined by ADB\u2019s investment committee. The committee will also determine \nthe up-front and commitment fees. The proposed loan will be unsecured. \n \n30. \nThe  loan  will  be  documented  in  a  loan  agreement,  which  will  contain  terms  and \nconditions  standard  for  private  sector  loans  without  government  guarantees,  as  well  as \ncovenants relating to ADB policies.15 The proposed loan will be subject to conditions precedent \nto  the  disbursement,  including  all  necessary  government,  creditor,  and  shareholder  approvals \nand  consents,  and  all  contractual  and  financial  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  loan \nagreement  will  include  appropriate  (i)  representations  and  warranties;  (ii)  covenants,  including \naffirmative, negative, financial, and information covenants; and (iii) events of default. \n \n31. \nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale guarantee. The commercial risks associated with the proposed loan \nwill  be  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,  the  majority  shareholder  of \nBank Republic. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is currently rated Aa2 by Moody\u2019s, A+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s, \nand A+ by Fitch Ratings. \n \nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\n \nJustification for the proposed ADB loan is based on the following considerations: \n\n32. \n \n\n(i) \n\nSystemic  support  for  Georgian  banking  sector.  The  proposed  loan  will \nprovide systemic support to the Georgian banking sector at a critical point in its \ndevelopment  and  help  to  renew  confidence  in  the  country\u2019s  banking  system. \nLending  activity  among  the  banks  in  Georgia  has  all  but  stopped  as  a \nconsequence  of  the  conflict  and  global  crisis,  as  well  as  their  interest  in \nmaintaining  additional  liquidity.  As  banks  are  a  key  source  of  small  and  micro \nloans for the private sector, in particular for individual entrepreneurs and SMEs, \nthey are crucial to the recovery of the Georgian economy.  \n\nIncrease  access  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  financing.  The \nproposed  transaction  will  foster  Bank  Republic\u2019s  SME  financing  operations  by \nproviding  debt  funding  needed  for  renewal  of  lending  to  this  particular  sector. \nThis  will  in  turn  help  to  expand  the  SME  sector  itself,  which  is  a  main  force \nbehind economic growth in Georgia and contributes significantly to employment \ncreation.   \n\nCatalyze  foreign  funds  into  Georgia.  In  conjunction  with  market  support  from \nother international financial institutions, ADB's proposed loan will provide a signal \nof confidence in the underlying fundamentals of the Georgian economy and the \nbanking  sector  during  the  current  period  of  uncertainty  and  help  to  catalyze  a \nreturn of foreign investment into the country.  \n\nSupport  of  foreign  investment.  ADB's  proposed  loan  and  its  coverage  of  the \npolitical  risks  in  the  transaction  will  also  provide  support  to  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's \nlong-term  objective  of  expanding  its  role  in  the  development  of  the  Georgian \nbanking  sector  and  in  expanding  SME  lending  in  particular.  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \nperceives  ADB's  relationship  with  the  Government  of  Georgia  as  providing  it \nsome  measure  of  comfort  for  the  political  risks  associated  with  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n15 These covenants include compliance with ADB (i) environmental and social safeguard policies; and (ii) combating \n\nmoney laundering and financing of terrorism, and anticorruption policies. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nG\u00e9n\u00e9rale's  participation,  as  a  private  sector  entity,  in  the  country's  economic \ndevelopment.   \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n \nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\nA. \n \n33. \nThe proposed loan is classified as category FI under ADB's Environment Policy (2002) \nand  as  category  C  under  both  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998).  Bank  Republic  has  already  adopted  an  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system in accordance with EBRD guidelines. ADB will review such environmental \nand  social  management  system  to  ensure  that  it  is  compliant  with  ADB's  Environment  Policy \n(2002)  and  the  guidelines  in  Appendix  5.  If  Bank  Republic  is  not  in  compliance,  it  will  be \nrequired to make the necessary changes.  \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nB. \n \n34.  Monitoring.  The  proposed  terms  of  the  loan  agreement  will  require  Bank  Republic  to \nprovide the following information: (i) unaudited quarterly financial statements; (ii) audited annual \nfinancial statements; (iii) quarterly compliance certificates for agreed-upon financial covenants; \nand (iv) quarterly reports on the sub-borrowers. \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nBank Republic was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \n35. \nand  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism \n(2003).  Consistent  with its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB will require Bank Republic to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain \nfrom  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  documentation  between  ADB  and  Bank  Republic  will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\n36. \nThe  proposed  transaction,  once  approved  and  signed,  will  increase  ADB's  projected \nnonsovereign exposure for 2009 to $4.39 billion based on the 30 September 2009 outstanding \namount  and  the  projected  disbursements  until  31  December  2009.  Exposure  to  Georgia  will \nincrease  to  $36.67  million  or  0.84%  of  total  projected  nonsovereign  operations  portfolio,  while \nthe  exposure  to  the  capital  market  subsector  will  increase  to  $57.74  million  or  1.32%  of  total \nprojected  nonsovereign  operations  portfolio.  The  proposed  financing  is  within  ADB\u2019s  country, \nindustry, single, and group exposure limits for nonsovereign transactions. ADB will ensure that \nnonsovereign exposure will be kept within the nonsovereign exposure limit. \n \nE. \n\nAssurances \n\nNo-objection \n\n37. \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (the  Charter)16,  the  government  will  be  asked  to  confirm  that  it  has  no \n\nthe  Agreement  Establishing \n\n \nletter.

Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\n1. Key Issues  \n\n \nGeorgia's  Economic  Development  and  Poverty  Reduction  Program  (2003\u20132015)a  set  forth  the  country's  first  long-term \ndevelopment  strategy.  Although  the  program  provided  a  framework  for  poverty  reduction,  it  lacked  clear  prioritization  and \nimplementation was hampered by limited government resources. Following the presidential election in 2008, the government \nissued  a  5-year  program  of  key  priorities  for  2008\u20132012\u2014United  Georgia  Without  Poverty\u2014which  identified  a  number  of \npolitical,  economic,  and  social  objectives  including  (i)  social  programs  (spending  one-third  of  the  state  budget  on  social \nprograms  during  2008\u20132012),  (ii)  generating  employment  (creating  200,000  new  jobs  during  2008\u20132012),  and  (iii)  reducing \npoverty (halving the number of social program beneficiaries during 2008\u20132012, increasing the minimum monthly pension to \n$100  during  2008\u20132012,  and  providing  access  to  state-funded  health  insurance  for  1.2  million  people,  including  socially \nvulnerable, teachers, military and law enforcement personnel, and employees of state agencies). The government has set a \ngoal of reducing the poverty rate to 15% by 2015. \n \nGeorgia  has  implemented  far-reaching  and  strategic  reforms  during  2003\u20132008  with  impressive  results.  The  key  outcomes \n(prior to the onset of the conflict  with the Russian Federation and the global economic crisis)  were as follows: (i) increased \nforeign  direct  investment  from  8.4%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2005  to  16%  in  2007;  (ii)  higher  tax  revenue \ncollection  from  14.1%  of  GDP  in  2003  to  25.8%  in  2007;  (iii)  increased  social  spending  by  more  than  5%;  (iv)  increased \nelectricity  generation  and  transmission  from  a  net  deficit  to  a  net  exporter;  and  (v)  establishment  of  a  social  assistance \nprogram covering 148,000 households with over 600,000 beneficiaries. As a result of such efforts, the official poverty rate in \nGeorgia declined from 24.1% in 2005 to 23.3% in 2006 and to 21.3% in 2007; however, World Bank figures indicate a poverty \nrate  of  23.6%  in  2007.  Despite  the  progress  in  reducing  poverty  during  this  period,  it  is  expected  that  the  poverty  rate  will \nincrease in the interim period as a result of the two crises, which have resulted in the internal displacement of 130,000 people. \nIn addition, over 150,000 people have been adversely affected by difficulties related to the lack of irrigation water following the \nRussian conflict.  \n \n\n2.  Design Features \n\n \nPro-poor. Through its support for financial sector and SME development, the project will support the goal of reducing poverty \nindirectly  by  contributing  to  economic  growth  and  directly  by  helping  to  improve  access  to  finance,  which  will  create \nemployment opportunities, provide more investment in human capital, and smooth consumption. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey  Issues.  ADB's  interim  operational  report  on  Georgia  (2008\u20132009)b  indicates  that  \"relatively  high  rates  of  urban \nunemployment and of rural underemployment contribute to the persistence of poverty. Net job creation rates have been found \nto  be  highest  in  small  private  firms,  as  the  large  privatized  enterprises  are  downsizing  and  shedding  labor.  However, \nprivatized  large  enterprises  still  dominate  output  and  employment.  Greater  focus  is  needed  on  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for the development of small firms to boost net new job creation. This calls for addressing the constraints that \nsuch enterprises face, such as the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises face bigger hurdles in accessing finance than \nlarger firms. In addition to strengthening the institutional environment, the access of such enterprises to capital also can be \nimproved by (i) diversifying financial services offered, (ii) broadening the types of collateral that can be accepted by banks, (iii) \nreducing  costs  associated  with  evaluation  of  credit  information,  and  (iv)  establishing  effective  systems  for  enforcing \nrepayment.\" \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nB.

Real \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  data  indicates  that  the  Georgian  economy  contracted  by  5.9% \n(year-on-year)  during  the  first  quarter  of  2009  and  by  a  further  10.7%  (year-on-year)  in  the \nsecond  quarter  due  to  the  ongoing  decline  in  exports  and  remittances,  and  the  contraction  in \nbank lending by 10.0% since the end of 2008. While the contraction affected most sectors of the \neconomy, retail trade, manufacturing, and construction contributed most to the decline, leading \nto significantly reduced employment and incomes. 1 \n \n\n2. \n\nInflation \n\n \n2. \nAgainst  the  background  of  a  broad  decline  in  economic  activity  and  falling  global \ncommodity prices, inflationary pressures have dissipated. Inflation was 5.5% (year-on-year) for \n2008, as compared with 10.9% in 2007 (year-on-year), and 12-month inflation was only 2.3% as \nof 30 June 2009 (Table A4.1).  \n \n\nTableA4.1: Georgia Economic Indicators  \n\n4.8 \n\n5.7 \n\n2004 \n9.8 \n5.1 \n5.9 \n\n2003 \n8.6 \n4.0 \n11.1 \n\n2005 \n11.6 \n6.4 \n9.6 \n\nItem \nGDP at market prices (GEL billion) \nGDP ($ billion) \nReal GDP growth (%) \nConsumer price inflation, average \n(%) \nPopulation (million) \nExports of goods, FOB ($ million) \nImports of goods, FOB ($ million) \nCurrent account balance ($ million) \nForeign exchange reserves, \nexcluding gold ($ million) \nForeign direct investment ($ million) \nTotal external debt ($ million) \nDebt-service ratio, paid (%) \nExchange rate, average (GEL:$) \n( ) = negative, FOB = free on board, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Economist Intelligence Unit, Fitch Ratings, Georgia Department of Statistics. \n\n4.6 \n830.5 \n(1,468.7) \n(383.6) \n\n4.5 \n1,472.4 \n(2,686.6) \n(762.7) \n\n4.5 \n1,092.1 \n(2,007.6) \n(420.7) \n\n16.6a \n1.92 \n\n542 \n2,657 \n\n483 \n2,088 \n\n331 \n2,035 \n\n196.2 \n\n386.7 \n\n478.6 \n\n14.5 \n\n1.81 \n\n2.15 \n\n14.8 \n\n8.3 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nForeign Exchange \n\n2006 \n13.8 \n7.7 \n9.4 \n\n9.2 \n\n2007 \n16.5 \n9.8 \n12.4 \n\n9.2 \n\n2008 \n19.1 \n12.8 \n2.1 \n\n10.0 \n\n4.4 \n1,666.6 \n(3,685.9) \n(1,235.4) \n\n4.4 \n2,104.3 \n(4,976.5) \n(2,043.9) \n\n4.3 \n2,427.9 \n(6,261.2) \n(3,169.9) \n\n930.8 \n\n1,361.2 \n\n1,480.2 \n\n1,076 \n3,503 \n\n14.4 \n\n1.78 \n\n2,015 \n4,243 \n\n16.0 \n\n1.67 \n\n1,564 \n7,711 \n \n1.49 \n\n \n3. \nThe  foreign  exchange  market  has  stabilized  since  mid-February  2009,  reflecting  an \neasing  of  balance  of  payment  pressures.  The  external  current  account  deficit  has  narrowed \nfaster  than  expected,  led  by  declining  imports.  Capital  inflows  have  also  fallen  short  of  earlier \nprojections.  Foreign  direct  investment,  the  main  driver  of  economic  activity  in  Georgia  for  the \npast  several  years,  fell  by  approximately  70.0%  in  the  first  half  of  2009  relative  to  the  same \n                                                 \n1  Excerpts taken from International Monetary Fund. 2009.

The \nstabilization of the foreign exchange market, which coincided with the return to auctions instead \nof  fixing  sessions,  allowed  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia  (NBG)  to  acquire  foreign  exchange \nfrom the market in March\u2013April 2009 and to limit its foreign exchange sales in May\u2013June 2009 \nto $34 million as compared with $130 million in January\u2013February 2009. \n \n\nMonetary Policy \n\n4. \n \nMonetary  conditions  remain  very  tight,  notwithstanding  policy  loosening,  with  monetary \n4. \nand  credit  aggregates  contracting  through  the  first  half  of  2009  and  real  deposit  interest  rates \nrising to 8.5%. Deposit rates have increased since the outset of the crisis as banks compete for \na  shrinking  deposit  base.  Unlike  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  conflict,  the  contraction  of \nmonetary aggregates appears to reflect mostly a drawdown of financial savings by households \nand  enterprises  rather  than  a  loss  of  confidence.  Despite  stabilization  in  deposits  and  deposit \ndollarization since mid-May, banks have continued to curtail credit to preserve adequate liquidity \nbuffers in the face of ongoing uncertainty and heightened credit risk. With increased credit risk, \nintermediation  margins  widened  steadily  through  February  2009,  but  have  since  come  down. \nNBG's refinancing rate has been lowered repeatedly, but with limited eligible collateral available \nfor  accessing  this  window,  this  has  only  led  to  a  widening  gap  between  market  rates  and  the \npolicy rate. \n \n\n5. \n\nFiscal Policy \n\n6. \n\nFinancial Sector \n\n \n5. \nDue to cuts in defense spending, public expenditures were 11.0% lower during the first \nhalf  of  2009  as  compared  with  the  same  period  in  2008.  Despite  the  strict  control  of  public \nexpenditures, spending reductions in the first half of 2009 were outpaced by the decline in tax \nrevenues  by  a  substantial  margin.  Tax  revenues  declined  by  17.0%  in  the  first  6  months  of \n2009, in part due to the reduction of personal income tax rates from 25.0% to 20.0%, as well as \nthe reductions of taxes on interest and dividend income paid to nonresidents. \n \n \n \n6. \nThe  financial  sector  has  been  resilient  thus  far,  helped  by  external  financial  support; \nhowever,  it  remains  susceptible  to  further  deterioration  in  asset  quality,  as  well  as  continued \nuncertainty about the deposit base. The share of nonperforming loans in total loans has risen by \n15  percentage  points  since  June  2008.  So  far,  domestic  currency  loans  have  been \ndisproportionately  affected,  but  stress  testing  indicates  the  vulnerability  of  the  loan  portfolio  to \nfurther exchange rate depreciation. Faced with deposit outflows and little prospect for additional \nrecapitalization  in  the  short  term,  banks  have  continued  to  build  up  precautionary  balances. \nAlthough the banks\u2019 cautious attitude to lending has prudential benefits, given very high loan\u2013\ndeposit ratios, it is placing additional strains on the economy. \n \nB. \n \n \n \n7. \nBased on a moderate recovery of activity, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects \nreal  GDP  growth  in  Georgia  to  rebound  to  2.0%  in  2010.  Over  the  medium  term,  real  GDP \ngrowth is projected to rise gradually to 5.0%, capitalizing on a recovery of world growth, given \nthe country's geographical location as a natural transit point of world trade in goods and energy, \n\nMacroeconomic Outlook and Risks \n \n1. \n\nGross Domestic Product Growth and Inflation \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n2. \n\nForeign Exchange \n\nInflation is expected to edge up as growth resumes, although still remain below the pre-\n\nvery favorable business environment, flexible economic institutions, and demonstrated capacity \nfor timely policy action.  \n \n8. \nThese  projections  are,  however,  predicated  on  the  size  of  the  economic  contraction  in \n2009,  the  timing  and  pace  of  economic  recovery,  and  the  resumption  of  private  capital  flows. \nFurther  declines  in  private  capital  inflows,  exports,  and  remittances,  as  well  as  delays  or \nshortfalls in official assistance, or prolonged domestic and regional political tensions could result \nin a deeper contraction in 2009 than currently forecast. \n \n9. \ncrises level at 5.0% in the medium term. \n \n \n \n10.  While  foreign  exchange  pressures  have  eased  recently,  they  could  reemerge  in  the \nevent of financing shortfalls, and the combined effect of output contraction and lari depreciation \nwould have repercussions on the banking sector, which is exposed to highly dollarized balance \nsheets  of  unhedged  borrowers.  For  now,  however,  the  Government  of  Georgia  expects  the \nforeign  exchange  market  to  remain  relatively  stable  through  the  remainder  of  2009,  aided  by \nsmoother exchange rate adjustment associated with the auction system. \n \n \n \n11.  With  limited  scope  for  reviving  credit  growth  through  interest  rate  cuts  and  liquidity \ninjections, Georgia's short-term monetary strategy is to ease credit conditions through selective \ninstruments  such  as  foreign  exchange  swaps,  in  an  effort  to  encourage  domestic  currency \nlending.  Meanwhile,  liquidity  injections  from  external  budgetary  support  will  be  allowed  to \nincrease reserve money sufficiently to meet banks\u2019 demand for higher precautionary balances. \n \n \n \n12. \nGeorgia's  fiscal  deficit  is  projected  to  increase  from  the  original  projection  of  5.6%  of \nGDP to 9.4% in 2009, due mainly to the downward revision in GDP growth. Fiscal deficits in the \nsecond  half  of  2009  and  in  2010  will  be  financed  by  a  mix  of  T-bill  issuance,  privatization \nreceipts, and external budget support. Part of the balance of payments support provided by the \nIMF in 2009 ($100 million) will be channeled to the budget. In 2010, all of the IMF financing is \nprovisionally channeled to the budget pending confirmation of the amount of budget support that \nis  in  the  pipeline  from  other  international  financial  institutions.  Beyond  2010,  the  adjustment \nstrategy  will  continue  to  rely  on  containing  expenditure  and  broadening  the  tax  base  while \nfurther reducing income tax rates once conditions permit. \n \n\nMonetary Policy \n\nFiscal Policy \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4\n\n23\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nGUARANTOR: SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 G\u00c9N\u00c9RALE \n \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nA. \n \nOverview. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group,1 one of the leading universal banks in Europe, \n1. \nhas the seventh-largest market capitalization in the euro zone and a broad global presence, with \n163,000 employees in 82 countries, serving 30 million individual customers worldwide. \n \nBusiness operations. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is focused on four key business areas: (i) retail \n2. \nbanking; (ii) financial services (consumer credit, equipment finance, vehicle finance, information \ntechnology  leasing,  insurance);  (iii)  global  investment  management  and  services  (asset \nmanagement,  private  banking,  securities  services,  online  banking);  and  (iv)  corporate  and \ninvestment  banking,  in  which  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  ranks  among  the  leading  banks  worldwide  in \neuro capital markets, derivatives, and structured finance.  \n \n3. \nBusiness strategy. The group has three strategic priorities: (i) maintaining a balanced \nbusiness mix, (ii) achieving long-term growth, and (iii) increasing operating efficiency. To carry \nout  these  priorities,  the  group\u2019s  strategy  for  2008\u20132010  includes  increasing  development  in \nhigh-potential businesses and markets (international expansion of retail banking and consumer \ncredit,  and  private  banking),  to  be  funded  through  high  capital  generation  from  its  French \nnetworks  and  its  corporate  and  investment  banking  business.  The  group\u2019s  international \nexpansion in the long term will focus on retail banking in the Russian Federation, Central and \nEastern  Europe,  and  the  Mediterranean  Basin,  and  on  consumer  banking  activity  in  the  BRIC \n(Brazil,  Russian  Federation,  India,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China)  countries  and  other  emerging \nmarkets.  The  strategy  also  includes  enhancing  revenue  synergies  between  businesses,  and \nreinforcing security and operational efficiency to ensure robust, profitable, and balanced growth.  \n \n8. \nBusiness  performance.  The  year  2007  was  a  difficult  one  for  financial  markets \nworldwide; the subprime crisis and follow-on liquidity crisis had far-reaching effects. The group \nwas  not  immune  to  these  problems;  in  the  second  half  of  2007,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s  corporate \nand  investment  banking  was  affected  by  fallout  from  the  United  States  financial  crisis,  and  its \nasset management group was affected by the liquidity crisis. Moreover, the group suffered from \nfraud committed by a rogue trader in its capital market activities, resulting in an exceptional loss \nof \u20ac4.9 billion. These difficulties affected both revenue, which was down 2.8% from 2006,2 and \nnet  income,  which  was  down  81.9%  from  2006.  Despite  these  challenges,  the  group  had  a \nprofitable year in 2007, earning net income of \u20ac947 million. This strong performance was driven \nby its diverse range of activities, the positive performance of its retail banking networks, and the \nstrong  growth  of  its  financial  services,  private  banking,  and  securities  services  activities.  The \nafter-tax return on equity was 3.6% (17.1% excluding the effects of the fraud).  \n \nDespite  the  deepening  of  the  global  economic  crisis  in  2008,  the  group  reported  net \n9. \nincome  of  \u20ac2,773  million  as  of  year-end  2008.  Earnings  were  supported  by  the  group's \nperformance  in  the  retail  banking  business,  both  in  France  and  internationally,  as  well  as  its \nfinancial services, custody, futures brokerage, and online banking business lines. As of 30 June \n2009, the group's net income rebounded to positive levels following negative earnings in the first \nquarter of 2009, related to credit costs and securities write-downs.

After  the  discovery  of  the  rogue  trading  in  2007,  immediate \n10. \nmeasures  were  taken  and  structural  plans  put  in  place  to  tighten  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s  risk \nmanagement  and  internal  control  policies  and  procedures.  These  included  enhancing \noperational  controls  such  as  (i)  stricter  controls  over  operations  and  reporting  of  nominal \npositions, (ii) improved transaction confirmation procedures, (iii) strengthened management alert \nprocesses,  and  (iv)  stricter  compliance  with  mandatory  holiday  procedures.  Information \ntechnology  security  was  also  tightened,  as  were  controls  over  access  to  information  systems, \nand  limits  applicable  to  stress  tests  and  arbitrage  volume  were  temporarily  decreased.  Plans \nwere also put in place to tighten controls across the organization by (i) reengineering the control \nfunction\u2019s  organization  and  procedures;  and  (ii) creating  a  department  responsible  for  the \nsecurity of operations, independent from front and back channels, and including a special team \nresponsible for uncovering fraudulent behavior.  \n \n11. \nand A+ by Fitch Ratings. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale will give a guarantee in favor of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nrespect  of  any  default  in  payment  other  than  a  default  due  to  certain  excepted  country  risk \nevents; ADB will therefore be exposed to the excepted risks.  \n \n \n\nCredit ratings.
