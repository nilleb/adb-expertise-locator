Furthermore,  a  demographic  imbalance  in  water  access  and \nquality is evident: about 55% of rural residents lack household tap connections, relying instead \non wells and other communal means for supply.1 In those communities, water is often supplied \nbelow  national  quality  standards,  a  consequence  of  inadequate  treatment  or  secondary \ncontamination from pipelines with high leakage during distribution. \n \n3. \nAgainst  this  backdrop,  CWA,  a  private  sector  pioneer  in  urban  water  distribution,  is \nexpanding  its  strategy  to  target  underserved  rural  and  semi-urban  communities.  CWA  is  well \nestablished  in  its  core  business  of  supplying  water  to  cities.  Since  2011,  with  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  assistance,  the  firm  has  implemented  the  Municipal  Water \nDistribution Infrastructure Development Project, which supports the rehabilitation and expansion \nof  water  distribution  networks  in  second-  and  third-tier  cities. 2 To  date,  the  assistance  has \nfunded  11  subprojects  with  aggregate  supply  capacity  of  1.2  million  cubic  meters  (mcm)  per \nday. Building on the success of this earlier ADB intervention, CWA requested ADB to consider a \nfollow-on  project  to finance investments that  would reach  communities  surrounding  its  existing \nservice  areas.  CWA  also  requested  ADB\u2019s  support  for  expansion  into  second-  and  third-tier \ncities  to  establish  new  operations  and  hubs  from  which  to  penetrate  surrounding  rural  areas \nover time. \n \nDespite good progress in expanding water access to its urban residents, the PRC faces \n4. \na rural water gap. The challenge is particularly acute for the PRC\u2019s 650 million rural residents\u2014\nof whom more than half lack basic household connections and who bear disproportionately the \nimpact  on  health  and  livelihood  from  scarce,  expensive,  or  substandard  water  (footnote  1). \nEfforts to establish last-mile connections confront high investment costs, especially in areas with \nlower  population  density.  Even  in  rural  or  semi-urban  communities  which  do  have  tap \nconnections, water is often supplied below national quality standards, caused by pollution at the \nwater  source,  inadequate  treatment,  or  contamination  from  pipelines.  Finally,  waste  and \n\n                                                \n1  United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization. 2012.

Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\ninefficiency are higher in rural and semi-urban areas than in any other part of the water chain, \nwith nonrevenue water rates typically above the PRC\u2019s national average of 20%\u201330%.3  \n \n5. \nClosing  the  rural  water  gap  is  an  increasing  priority  for  the  government.  In  2012,  it \nannounced  a  program  of  rural  water  investments  of  CNY170  billion  during  the  12th  Five-Year \nPlan  (2011\u20132015)\u2014or  CNY100  billion  more  than  was  allocated  in  2006\u20132010.4 The  program \nwould  prioritize  the  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  piped  water  systems  in  rural  and  semi-\nurban areas, including the extension of urban water supply networks. The program is part of the \ngovernment\u2019s  urban\u2013rural  integration  initiative  aimed  to  rectify  development  imbalances \nbetween city and countryside through provision of basic infrastructure services. \n \n6. \nWater  distribution  in  the  PRC  has  traditionally  been  the  responsibility  of  municipal \ngovernment. Utilities owned by municipalities typically suffer from chronic financial distress due \nto weak management, poor budgetary discipline, artificially low water tariffs, and the widespread \nproblem  of  nonrevenue  water.  Meanwhile,  utility  financial  losses  are  a  burden  on  many  local \ngovernment  budgets,  and  contribute  to  patterns  of  underinvestment  in  tap  networks.  In \nresponse, the central government has since 1998 progressively encouraged commercialization \nof  water  distribution  and  increased  private  sector  participation  as  a  means  to  increase \ninvestment and efficiency.5  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n7. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  would  finance  CWA\u2019s  plan  to  invest  in  (i)  expanding  existing  water \nutility  networks  into  adjacent  semi-urban  and  rural  communities;  and  (ii)  establishing,  through \nconstruction or acquisition, new water treatment and distribution  hubs in second- and third-tier \ncities  that  have  the  potential  for  urban\u2013rural  integration.  ADB  will  extend  financing  on  a \nsubproject-by-subproject basis, subject to a set of defined environmental, social, development, \nand financial criteria. \n \n8. \nThe  project  is  designed  to  be  cost-effective  in  financing  smaller-scale  water  supply \nprojects. The portfolio approach will enable ADB to support multiple water supply projects of a \nscale  usually  too  small  and  expensive  for  ADB  or  international  banks  to  finance  on  a  stand-\nalone basis.  \n \n9. \nThe project differs from ADB\u2019s earlier assistance to CWA by more strongly emphasizing \ninclusiveness. By leveraging the company\u2019s existing water supply projects (as bases from which \nto expand), the project can target rural and semi-urban communities, typically of lower incomes, \n\n                                                \n3  \u201cNonrevenue water\u201d refers to water that is economically lost due to leaking pipelines, inadequate control equipment \n\nor meters (either faulty or never installed), or lack of payment collection. \n\n4  The investment program is an interministerial effort of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), \nthe  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  the  National  Health  and  Family  Planning  Commission,  and  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironmental Protection (MEP). Supporting policy guidance is also given by the Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013\nRural  Development  (MOHURD)  and  NDRC.  2012.

Since its founding in \n2003, the company has pioneered a successful model of acquiring municipal utilities (either in \npartnership with local governments  or  through full  privatization),  overhauling  infrastructure  and \nmanagement  systems,  and  efficiently  distributing  water  to  households  and  industries.  With  a \nstrategic  focus  on  smaller  cities  and  towns  in  interior  provinces,  CWA  operates  nearly \n30 concessions with total treatment and distribution capacity of about 4.5 mcm of water per day. \nAbout  85%  of  CWA\u2019s  revenues  come  from  water  supply,  with  the  remainder  from  sewage \ntreatment,  water-related  construction  services,  and  other  ancillary  businesses.  CWA  is \nincorporated  in  Bermuda  and  listed  on  the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange.9 For  the  year  to  30 \nMarch  2013, the  company  reported  consolidated  revenues  of  HK$2.25  billion;  earnings  before \ninterest,  tax,  depreciation,  and  amortization  of  HK$703  million;  and  total  assets  of  HK$11.6 \nbillion. Its performance under  2 years of ADB assistance has been in line with expectations at \nthe  time  of  Board  approval,  with  stable  growth,  strong  management,  and  financial  ratios  well \nwithin the covenants of the ADB loan agreement.10 \n \n12. \nSSD is an investment holding company wholly owned by CWA for investments in water-\nrelated businesses. Among SSD\u2019s operating subsidiaries are five water distribution companies \nand several ancillary businesses.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n                                                \n6   CWA\u2019s  rural  and  semi-urban  investments  would  target  areas  under  the  administrative  jurisdiction  of  adjacent \n\nmunicipalities, and thus would be subject to the PRC\u2019s standard regulations for municipal water supply. \n\n7   Under  the  project,  costs  of  connecting  new  household  taps  will  be  borne  by  a  combination  of  user  fees,  cross-\nsubsidization (across user groups and between urban center and rural periphery), and local government assistance \nthrough grants and subsidized lifeline tariffs. \n\n8   Integration of smaller stand-alone networks into larger utility systems typically increases economies of scale. Due \ndiligence  confirmed  that,  in  most  locations,  newly  integrated  rural  customers  will  see  decreases  in  water  tariffs. \nFurther, for consumers without pre-existing tap connections, tap supply is significantly cheaper than bottled water.  \n9  Bermuda is on the list of jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard. \nThe Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes has determined, following its \nphase 1 peer review of Bermuda, that the country has in place all the elements assessed to date in relation to the \ninternationally agreed tax standard. (September 2013. OECD Progress Report to the G20 Leaders: Global Forum \nUpdate on Effectiveness and On-going Monitoring. Paris).  Following ADB\u2019s review of CWA, ADB does not believe \nthat CWA has been established or is being used, for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or the financing \nof terrorism. \n\n10 FY2013 consolidated  revenues projected in the  report and recommendation of the President were  HK$2.7 billion \n(versus  actual  revenues  of  HK$2.3  billion);  projected  net  income  was  HK$0.95  billion  (vs.  HK$0.9  billion);  and \nprojected  assets  were  HK$11.5  billion  (vs.  HK$11.6  billion).  The  company  is  significantly  less  indebted  (HK$2.5 \nbillion) than was forecast (HK$4.1 billion). \n\n\f4 \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n13. \nImpact. The anticipated project impacts will be (i) expanded access to safe and reliable \nwater  supply  for  rural  and  urban  households  and  other  customers  in  the  PRC;  (ii)  improved \nwater  efficiency;  and  (iii)  increased  private  sector  participation  in  rural  and  urban  network \ninvestment and operation.  \n \n14. \nOutcome. The outcome will be improved water services in rural, semi-urban, and small-\ntown areas of the PRC provided through private sector participation, as measured by improved \nor new water connections for rural and urban residents, demand for local goods and services, \nand  contribution  to  PRC  government  revenue,  improvements  in  water  efficiency,  and \nachievement  of  national  water  quality  standards.  About  0.7  million  households  will  be  given \nreliable  and  convenient  access  to  safe  drinking  water  through  the  ADB-financed  subprojects. \nThe beneficiaries include the poor, who disproportionately bear the health and livelihood costs \nassociated with substandard or insufficient water supply. \n \nOutput. The output will be the rehabilitation and operation of water treatment plants and \n15. \ndistribution  at  designed  performance  levels  of  up  to  2  mcm  per  day  of  water  supply  capacity. \nThe  facilities  will  comply  with  national  standards  for  safe  drinking  water  quality  and  with  ADB \nsafeguards, and technical and financial eligibility criteria.11 \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n16. \nConsistency  with  Strategy  2020.  The  project  is  consistent  with  Strategy  2020,  which \nemphasizes  support  for  achieving  poverty  reduction  through  inclusive  and  environmentally \nsustainable growth, including private sector development as a driver of change.12 The strategy \nlists infrastructure and the environment as two of the five core areas in which ADB will employ \nits  financial  and  institutional  resources to  maximize  results,  efficiency,  and  impact.  In  terms  of \ninfrastructure, the project is in line with Strategy 2020\u2019s emphasis on public\u2013private partnerships \nand  private  sector  engagement;  and  consistent  with  plans  to  improve  human  health  through \ninterventions  in  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management.  With  regard  to  the \nenvironment, ADB will assist developing member countries and their municipalities in managing \na range of problems resulting from rapid urbanization. \n \n17. \nConsistency with country strategy. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC is \nbased on three development pillars: (i) inclusive growth and balanced development, (ii) resource \nefficiency  and  environmental  sustainability,  and  (iii)  regional  cooperation  and  public  goods.13 \nThe project reinforces each pillar and will be an integral part of ADB\u2019s overall support for rural\u2013\nurban  development  in  the  PRC.  It  strongly  complements  current  ADB  initiatives  in  the  water \nsector.14 It  is  also  consistent  with  the  strategy\u2019s  support  for  private  sector  development  as  a \ndriver of change.  \n                                                \n11 The  quality  of  treatment  plant  output  is  tested  by  CWA,  and  enforced  through  regular  inspections  by  MEP, \nMOHURD, and the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC). The water quality in households is \ntested by MOHURD and NHFPC on a spot basis. \n\n12 ADB.  2008.

The  project  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s Water Policy,  which emphasizes integrated water management, water conservation, and \nsystem efficiencies.15 The Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 also lists improved efficiency and \nprivate  sector  participation  as  priority  areas. 16  The  project  is  an  example  of  the  type  of \nintervention envisaged by the plan, which promotes water as a core investment area and raises \nADB\u2019s  water  investment  target  to  $2.0  billion\u2013$2.5  billion  annually,  or  a  total  of  $20  billion\u2013\n$25 billion by 2020. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n19. \nCWA\u2019s  business  plan  for  FY2014\u2013FY2017  indicates  a  total  investment  requirement  of \n$400  million  equivalent  and  includes  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  other  local \nprocurement, and working capital.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.17 \n\n20. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nAspects \nConcession framework  Concessions  granted  by  municipal  governments  will  include  surrounding  semi-urban  and \nrural  areas.a  Concession  rights  are  awarded  through  public  tendering  or  bilateral \nnegotiation  with  underlying  competitive  selection.  For  all  subprojects,  a  feasibility  study, \nenvironmental  assessment,  resettlement  plan,  and  project  design  will  be  prepared  by \nCWA, reviewed by ADB, and approved by municipal governments. Each subproject will be \nimplemented in accordance with granted approvals, and during construction and operation \nwill be subject to government inspections on various aspects, including environment, health \nand  safety,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities,  labor,  and \nsanitation.  \nTariffs  are  governed  by  PRC  cost-plus  regulations  and  administered  by  municipal pricing \nauthorities with public consultation.b \nCWA  will  centrally  control  all  subproject  development  and  financing  arrangements. \nProcurement  (e.g.,  third-party  construction  contracts  through  competitive  selection)  of  all \ncivil  works  and  equipment  will  be  handled  by  CWA  according  to  PRC  local  bidding \nprocedures.  \nTo  be  eligible  for  ADB  funding,  subprojects  must  meet  defined  criteria  for  location, \nrisk  mitigation,  water  efficiency \ninvestment  purpose,  environmental  and  social \nimprovement, and forecast financial return.  \n2014\u20132017 \n\nSubproject selection \n\nTariff framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nOperation arrangements \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nCWA will manage project implementation, operation, and maintenance as part of its 25\u201330- \nyear subproject concession obligations.  \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nthe  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Harbin  Water \nSupply Project.

This  contractual  arrangement  is  in  line  with  the  PRC\u2019s  urban\u2013rural \nintegration policies, which require the municipality to be also in charge of surrounding villages and communities. \nb  End-use tariffs are set by each municipal government on a cost-plus basis to target a benchmark return on equity \nof 8%\u201312% in accordance with national regulations (Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development; National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission. 1998. Administrative Measures on Tariffs for Town Water Supply. Beijing. \n23  September  1998,  amended  29  November  2004).  If  operating  costs  from  electricity,  labor,  upgrades, \nmaintenance, or other inputs rise, a utility operator is entitled to apply for a corresponding tariff increase to meet the \nbenchmark return. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nThe  project  is  financially  viable  as  CWA\u2019s  expected  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is \n21. \nhigher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  and  economically  viable  as  the  economic \nreturn on invested capital is higher than the social discount rate of 12%. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n22. \nADB\u2019s proposed assistance consists of (i) a US dollar-yuan A-loan of up to $100 million \nequivalent,  and  (ii)  a  US  dollar-yuan  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $100  million  equivalent \nfunded  by  participating  banks  with  ADB  acting  as  lender  of  record.  The  proposed  A-loan  will \nhave  a  maturity  of  up  to  10  years  from  the  date  of  the  first  disbursement,  including  a  4-year \ngrace period on principal repayment. The complementary loan will have a maturity equal to or \nshorter than that of the A-loan. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nin \n\ninvestment \n\nCatalyzing  private \n\n23. \nless-developed  areas.  Water  distribution \ninfrastructure  requires  significant  upfront  capital,  with  a  particular  need  for  loans  under  tenors \nappropriate for long-lived assets. In the water distribution business\u2014especially in smaller urban \nor  rural  areas\u2014such  financing  is  difficult  to  obtain  from  commercial  banks  because  of  risk \nconcerns  and  bank  inexperience in the sector. The  project  will  help  a proven  player  surmount \nthese  obstacles,  while  expanding  private  investment  in  less-developed  areas  where  broader \nparticipation is urgently required. \n \n24. \nDeveloping viable commercial models of water provision. The project builds on the \nsuccess of ADB\u2019s earlier assistance to CWA, which focused on urban centers, by supporting the \ncompany  in  the  relatively  untested  area  of  rural  utility  service  provision.  Through  a  portfolio \nfinancing approach, ADB will support the development of multiple water supply subprojects that \nare typically too small and expensive for ADB or international banks to finance on a stand-alone \nbasis. Finally, ADB\u2019s experience with the project can contribute meaningfully to the dialogue on \nrural\u2013urban integration and water sector development in the PRC and the  rest of Asia and the \nPacific. \n\n\f7 \n\n \nRisks \n\nC. \n\n25. \nTariff  risk.  Any  failure  to  secure  adequate  tariff  increases  would  impact  the  financial \nviability  of the  subprojects\u2019  operation.  Mitigation  measures  include  (i)  PRC  policies,  developed \nunder long-standing ADB technical assistance, to mandate that urban water tariffs provide cost \nrecovery  and  adequate  returns;  (ii)  strong  government  policy  pressure  to  raise  tariffs  to \nrationalize  water  use  and  prevent  waste;  (iii)  the  relatively  low  starting  point  of  current  urban \nwater  tariffs,  which  gives  significant  room  to  raise  tariffs  within  affordability  thresholds;  and \n(iv) CWA  consideration  of  local  government  tariff  plans  in  its  selection  and  negotiation  of \nsubproject investments. \n \nRisk  of  nonpayment.  Possible nonpayment  by end  users\u2014residential, commercial,  or \n26. \nindustrial\u2014would directly affect cash flow. This risk is mitigated by (i) the installation of meters \n(one per customer) in line with national policy and CWA\u2019s business strategy; (ii) the legal right of \nPRC  water  utilities  to  deny  service  for  nonpaying  customers;  and  (iii)  the  reliance  of  city \ngovernments  on  ancillary  fees  collected  from  water  customers  by  the  subproject  companies, \nthereby aligning local authorities with CWA in pursuing prompt collections. Due to these factors, \nCWA reports tariff collection rates of over 98%.  \n \nDemand  risk.  Revenue  risk  may  arise  from  unexpectedly  low  demand  for  water \n27. \nservices,  affecting  either  CWA\u2019s  distribution  operations  or  related  investments  in  treatment \nplants.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  (i)  the  large  latent  demand  for  water  among  rural  and  urban \nresidential,  commercial,  and  industrial  customers;  and  (ii)  CWA\u2019s  practice  of  selecting  its \nsubprojects in part based on demand potential. \n \n28.  Water  supply  risk.  Water  supply  risk  may  arise  from  contamination,  depletion,  or \ndrought. This risk is mitigated by (i) CWA\u2019s practice of selecting subprojects with proven water \navailability  and  quality,  with  a  focus  on  water-rich  central  and  southern  provinces;  (ii)  water \nsupply  agreements  with  provincial  or  municipal  governments,  which  will  give  the  subproject \ncompanies  the  legal  right  to  predetermined  volumes  of  water  at  specified  quality  and  enables \nthe  subproject  company  (subject  to  certain  conditions  being  fulfilled)    to  terminate  the \nagreements  in  case  of  significant  deterioration  in  water  quality;  and  (iii) standardized  sales \nagreements with industrial and commercial end users, which will include provisions freeing the \nsubproject  companies from  liability or  obligation when upstream  water  supply  is  suspended  by \ncircumstances beyond their control. \n \n29. \nExpansion.  The project will support CWA\u2019s plans to operate up to 6.5 mcm per day of \nadditional  water  supply  capacity,  a  significant  expansion  on  its  current  operational  capacity  of \n4.5  mcm  per  day.  Such  expansion  requires  strong  management  skills  to  overcome  execution \nrisk  and  the  expected  increase  in  CWA\u2019s  gearing.  Mitigating  measures  include  CWA\u2019s  overall \ntechnical  competence,  its  use  of  standardized  management  systems  across  its  subproject \ncompanies,  its  use  of  shared  technical  resources  at  several  operational  hubs,  and  the \nbrownfield  (i.e.,  already  operating)  nature  of  the  subprojects.  Further,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  is \nconditional on the subprojects meeting eligibility criteria and financial covenants, helping ensure \nsubproject viability. \n \n30. \nlocal  utility \ncompanies. With its successful track record, CWA has established a methodology to effectively \nvalue  the  pipeline  networks,  related  infrastructure,  and  land  owned  by  the  local  utility \ncompanies.  To  verify  its  assessments,  CWA  uses  independent  valuations  from  third-party \n\nAcquisition  valuation.  Subproject  acquisitions \n\ninvolve  valuation  of \n\n\f8 \n\nauditors.  Further,  PRC  policies  mandate that  water  tariffs  provide  cost recovery  and adequate \nreturns taking into account the value of utility assets. \n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions  \n\n31. \nSafeguards. The project is being processed as corporate finance, with ADB funds to be \nallocated for implementing specific subprojects. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) requirements for corporate finance projects, safeguard requirements 1\u20133 will apply, and \nan  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  will  be  maintained.18 The  project  is \nclassified  as  category  B  for  impacts  on  the  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement  and \ncategory  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The  environmental  impacts  are  not  significant  and  are \nmostly  construction-related;  they  can  be  mitigated  through  the  adoption  of  good  engineering \npractices. Resettlement impacts are not expected to be significant as (i) rehabilitation of water \ntreatment  plants  and  distribution  networks  will  be  within  the  existing  facilities  or  within  the \navailable road reserves; (ii) for new facilities, the municipal governments normally complete land \nacquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation (if needed) prior to handing over the sites  to CWA; \nand  (iii)  expansion  of  distribution  networks  in  unserved  areas  will  be  within  the  available  road \nreserves. Impacts on indigenous peoples are not anticipated as the plants are typically located \nin areas where the population is primarily Han. The potential environmental and social impacts \nof  the  project  have  been  defined  in  the  ESMS  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize, \nmitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  of  every  subproject  financed  under  the \nproject  will  be  incorporated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  resettlement  plan  for \neach subproject.  \n \n32. \nA corporate audit was conducted on CWA\u2019s ESMS and its past and current performance \nagainst  the  objectives,  principles,  and  requirements  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The \naudit  confirmed  that  (i)  CWA\u2019s  ESMS  has  been  developed  to  comply  with  the  objectives, \nprinciples, and requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement; (ii) no substantive revisions are \nrequired  to  the  existing  ESMS  to  mitigate  impacts  resulting  from  the  proposed  project;  and, \n(iii) there are no existing or legacy issues relating to the audited facilities. The audit highlighted \nthe  need  for  a  more  stringent  application  of  the  ESMS  provisions  in  the  audited  facilities, \nespecially  in  documentation  and  reporting  of  the  implementation  of  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  measures.  In  line  with  the  findings  of  the  audit  and  the  corrective  action  plan, \nCWA  commits  to  revise  and  update  its  corporate  ESMS  prior  to  the  first  ADB  disbursement. \nSubprojects  where  land  was  acquired  prior  to  handing  over  the  concession  to  CWA  and \nsubprojects with operational facilities will be subject to audit following the updated ESMS.19  \n \n33. \nOther social dimensions. The project is classified as having some gender elements. In \naddition  to  the  direct  benefit  of  improving  households\u2019  access  to  potable  water,  especially \nwomen's, CWA will work toward incorporating the following measures: (i) carry out meaningful \nconsultations  that  are  gender  inclusive  and  responsive,  (ii)  involve  women  in  awareness \n                                                \n18 CWA, as part of the ongoing Municipal Water Distribution Infrastructure Development Project, established in 2011 \n\nits ESMS to screen, assess, and mitigate environmental and social impacts (footnote 2). \n\n19 Findings  of  the  Corporate  Safeguards  Audit  and  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\ngeneration  activities,  training  programs  on  water  conservation,  and  water  user  awareness \ncampaigns, and (iii) prioritize hiring of women for jobs created. CWA will employ local residents \nduring construction and operation of the facilities. CWA and its contractors will comply with the \nnational labor laws and take measures to comply with the international core labor standards in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.20 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nCWA and SSD were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \n34. \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\n\n35. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 21  the \n36. \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China\u2019s  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to \nCWA and SSD will be obtained.
