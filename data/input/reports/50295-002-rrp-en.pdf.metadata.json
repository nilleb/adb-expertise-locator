The proposed additional financing is consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach \n2016\u20132020,  which  serves  as  the  overall  ADB  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  Marshall \nIslands. 3  It  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  priority  of  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity, particularly in small island developing countries.4  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDevelopment  challenges.  The  rationale  of  the  current  project  remains  valid.  The \nMarshall  Islands  faces  significant  challenges  stemming  from  its  geographical  remoteness  and \ndispersion.  Exposure  to  external  shocks  and  heavy  reliance  on  development  assistance \ncompound fragility.5 Economic provisions under the Compact of Free Association with the United \nStates are scheduled to expire in 2023, and long-term fiscal sustainability amid substantially lower \ngrant  assistance  inflows  will  be  a  major  challenge.  Weak  PFM  and  inefficient  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) are critical constraints to strengthening the fiscal position. \n \n4. \nA  2012  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  (latest  available) \nhighlighted  significant  weaknesses  in  the  PFM  framework.6 Weaknesses  in  internal  controls, \ncashflow  planning,  and  commitment  controls  lead  to  pressure  on  spending  beyond  budgetary \nallocations. The  tax  revenue  as  a  share  of gross  domestic  product (GDP)  (16.8%  in  FY2013\u2013\nFY2017) is below the median of other Pacific small islands (17.4%), indicating room for improving \ntax policy and administration. The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessment shows \nthat the Marshall Islands remains at a high risk of debt distress, with the ratio of public sector debt \nto GDP projected to exceed 50% by 2023 and build up sharply thereafter.7 The performance of \nthe  SOE  sector  is  weak in  comparison  with  other  Pacific  economies.  In  2014, the  SOE  sector \nowned 17%\u201320% of the total capital stock in the economy but contributed only 5.3% to GDP.8 \n\n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2017.

The MOF experiences high turnover and loss of senior staff, and junior staff are often \nunderqualified  or  lack  experience  to  perform  their  functions  adequately.  Expertise  in  SOE \nmonitoring  and  reforms  needs  to  be  built  further  within  the  MOF.  While  several  development \npartners (including the World Bank, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre, and the \nGraduate School USA) are assisting PFM reforms, the MOF requires long-term support on the \nground to coordinate this assistance.9  \n \nCurrent project. An Asian Development Fund grant of $2 million for the current project \n6. \nwas approved on 15 October 2017 and became effective on 19 October 2017. The project closing \ndate  is  31  December  2020.  The  current  project  provides  technical  support  through  a  reform \ncoordination  unit  (RCU)  comprising  long-term  consultants  based  in  Majuro  to  build  the  MOF\u2019s \ncapacity to implement PFM and SOE reforms. It is considered to be performing well.10 \n \n7. \nThe RCU envisaged under the current project is established and fully staffed. It acts as \nthe implementing agency reporting to the MOF, under the oversight of the PFM Reform Steering \nCommittee  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary.  The  RCU  comprises  four  international  consultants: \n(i) an advisor, (ii) two financial management specialists (accounting), and (iii) an SOE monitoring \nand  community  service  obligation  (CSO)  expert.  The  CSO  expert  has  combined  the \nresponsibilities  originally  outlined  for  two  international  consultants  because  of  difficulty  finding \nsuitable qualified candidates willing to be based in Majuro for extended periods. Additionally, the \nRCU  includes  two  national  consultants:  (i)  a  budget  specialist  and  (ii)  a  human  resources \nspecialist. The RCU is now a recognized and fully functional unit based in Majuro and reporting \nto the MOF, providing advice and technical assistance to the government. \n \n8. \nThe  RCU  provides  timely  biannual  reports  on  project  activities  and  performance,  as \nexpected  under  the  implementation  arrangements.  Implementation  results  against  output \nindicators in the design and monitoring framework (DMF) of the current project suggest that it is \non track to meet its expected outcomes. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  RCU  has  updated  the  PFM  Reform  Roadmap  2014\u20132016, 11  and  has \ncontributed  to  various  aspects  of  10  (of  30)  broader  reform  components  in  the \nupdated Roadmap (against a target of six in the DMF): (a) a strengthened PFM \nlegal  and  policy  framework,  (b)  improved  cash  management,  (c)  improved  local \ngovernment  financial  management,  (d)  enhanced  PFM  reform  communications \nand training, (e) better management of Government of the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands embassy imprest accounts, (f) an improved budgeting framework, (g) the \nintroduction of a performance-based management framework, (h) regular annual \nreporting by line ministries, (i) better payroll management, and (j) improved SOE \noversight (footnote 10). \nThe RCU has prepared a training plan, and conducted 12 trainings and workshops \nin 2018 against a DMF target of at least three a year. Of the 281 attendees, 126 (or \n45%)  were  female,  which  exceeds  the  DMF  target  of  35%.  Training  has  been \nprovided for grant monitoring procedures, new planning and budgeting templates \nlinking planning and budgeting, SOE monitoring, calculating and costing of CSOs, \nthe role of SOE boards, SOE business planning and statements of corporate intent, \nand human resources planning for the MOF, among others. \nAs of May 2019, the share of MOF male staff with an accounting, computing, or \nbusiness administration degree and/or diploma has reached 43.1% (22 out of 51) \n\n                                                \n9  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2014. Public Financial Management Reform Roadmap 2014\u20132016. Majuro. \n\n\f3 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nagainst a fiscal year (FY) 2017 baseline of 38.2%, while the share for female staff \nhas reached 58.8% (or 20 out of 34) against an FY2017 baseline of 45.1%. \nIn  line  with  the  DMF  targets,  two  women  have  been  appointed  to  management \npositions: the assistant secretary of tax and revenues and the assistant secretary \nof the Division of International Development Assistance. \nAn SOE monitoring unit was established in May 2018, with two staff in place. The \nstaff are working with the  RCU to gain expertise.  In March 2019, the position of \nassistant  secretary  was  created  to  oversee  the  monitoring  unit  (among  others), \nand the position was filled in June 2019. \nA  CSO  process  and  framework  has  been  approved,  and  work  to  identify  and \nassess  the  legitimacy  and  cost  for  four  SOEs  is  ongoing  for  completion  by \nDecember 2019. \n\n \n9. \nCumulative contract awards totaled $1.715 million (85.8% of ADB financing) as of 30 June \n2019 and cumulative disbursements totaled $0.843 million (42.1% of ADB financing). The current \nproject is classified category C for environment, indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement \nbecause it includes only advisory inputs. Each safeguard covenant item is being complied with. \nThe risks identified in the report and recommendation of the President of the current project have \nbeen managed well. Major risks do not threaten successful project implementation. The risk of \nrecruitment  delays  was  managed  because  the  MOF  delegated  the  recruitment  process  for \ninternational  consultants  to  ADB,  while  making  the  final  hiring  decisions  and  engaging  the \nconsultants.  Advance  contracting  was  used  to  speed  up  the  process.  As  a  result,  the  RCU \ninternational  consultants  were  mobilized  within  3  months  of  project  approval.  The  MOF \nsubsequently  recruited  two  national  consultants,  with  assistance  from  the  RCU  international \nconsultants. The project is rated on track. The FY2018 audited annual financial statements have \nbeen received with an unqualified opinion from the independent auditor, and publicly disclosed. \n \n10. \nProposed  additional  financing.  The  additional  financing  will  build  on  the  work \nundertaken  through  the  current  project  and  allow  further  PFM  and  SOE  reforms  to  be \nimplemented.  Given  its  successful  performance,  the  government  has  requested  additional \nfinancing  to  scale  up  and  consolidate  activities  under  the  current  project,  while  maintaining  its \noverall  scope  of  improving  the  MOF\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  implement  the  PFM  Reform \nRoadmap and SOE reforms.12 All activities and outputs proposed under the project will contribute \nto  the  effective  implementation  of  PFM  and  SOE  reforms  (paras.  16\u201318),  as  outlined  in  the \nupdated PFM Reform Roadmap (para. 8).  \n \nAdditional  financing  for  the  project  complies  with  ADB  eligibility  criteria.  The  project \n11. \nremains  technically  feasible  and  economically  viable  (paras.  26\u201328).  Proposed  activities  and \noutputs are aligned with the project\u2019s development objectives of strengthening overall PFM. The \ngovernment accords the planned reforms high priority. \n \n12. \nAdditional  financing  is  considered  a  suitable  modality  since  the  proposed  activities  are \nstrongly  linked  to  the  design  of  the  current  project,  and  contribute  to  the  same  outputs  and \noutcomes  regarding  improved  PFM.  Implementation  arrangements  remain  unchanged,  with \nadditional individual consutants expected to be recruited as part of the RCU, under the oversight \nof the MOF. \n\n                                                \n12 The proposed additional financing is in the Memorandum of Understanding between ADB and the government for \nthe  2019  country  programming  mission,  and  is  signed  by  ADB  and  the  government.  ADB\u2019s  vice-president \n(operations 2) approved the back-to-office report of the country programming mission on 27 May 2019. The additional \nfinancing will be included in the country operations business plan for the 11 small Pacific island countries, expected \nto be circulated to the ADB Board of Directors in August 2019. \n\n\f4 \n\nThe  additional  financing  incorporates  lessons  learned  from  the  current  project.  ADB \n13. \nengagement  has  demonstrated  the  importance  of  providing  on-the-ground  support  for \ndevelopment  partner  coordination  and  capacity  enhancement.  The  additional  financing  is \ndesigned to provide further locally based support through qualified consultants, and also allows \nflexibility in reform implementation. Delegating the consultant recruitment process to ADB allowed \ninternational consultants to be mobilized quickly (para. 9). Similar processes will be followed for \nconsultant recruitment under the additional financing. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe  additional  financing  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  more  effective \ngovernance achieved.13 The project will have the following outcome: PFM improved.14 The impact \nand outcome of the additional financing project, as well as those of the overall project, remain the \nsame as for the current project.15 The outcome indicators are also unchanged. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe outputs of the additional financing will remain the same as the current project: (i) the \nMOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement the PFM Reform Roadmap strengthened and (ii) the \nMOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement SOE reforms strengthened. Additional activities will be \nundertaken under the two outputs to scale up project benefits, as outlined below (paras. 16\u201318). \n \n16. \nOutput 1: The MOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement the PFM Reform Roadmap \nstrengthened. To achieve the first output, the RCU will focus on three reform components in the \nrevised Roadmap (footnote 11) under the additional financing. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nImproved tax administration. The current tax system has several loopholes, as \nevident from tax arrears that have accumulated over time but cannot be accurately \nestimated. A tax reform commission was formed in 2008 and prepared a report on \nreform  requirements  in  2010.16 The  RCU  will  review  and  update  the  report  for \nphased  implementation.  In  addition  to  assisting  with  a  focus  on  tax  arrears,  the \nRCU will  work with the MOF to explore the introduction of value-added taxes to \nbring in new tax revenue. This is expected to lead to tax reform legislation, which \ncan help improve tax revenue collection. \nStrengthened  accounting  systems.  In  2018,  the  Marshall  Islands  secured \nfinancing from the World Bank for a new financial management information system \n(FMIS),  which  has  the  potential  to  significantly  improve  major  government \nprocesses  such  as  budgeting,  procurement,  performance  monitoring,  and \nreporting.17 A critical component of the new FMIS will be a well-designed chart of \naccounts (COA). Although the current FMIS (4Gov) had some elements of a COA, \nallowing for the generation of automated reports such as basic financial statements \nand program-level reports, these were not pursued fully during the initial setup or \nas  part  of  the  maintenance  process  over  the  years.  The  RCU  will  ensure  the \nintegrity  of  financial  data  as  the  Marshall  Islands  moves  from  4Gov  to  the  new \nFMIS,  including  by  mapping  the  old  COA  codes  to  the  new  COA  codes  and  by \nconducting investigations to support the changeover. \n\n                                                \n13 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2014.

Marshall  Islands:  Project  to  Strengthen  Budget  Execution  and \n\nTax and Revenue System. Majuro. \n\nFinancial Reporting Systems. Washington, DC. \n\n\f5 \n\n(iii) \n\nStrengthened public financial management legal and policy framework. The \nMOF  requires  technical  expertise  to  support  the  planning  and  management  of \nreform  measures,  with  a  focus  on  fiscal  planning.  With  assistance  from  the \nGraduate School USA, the Marshall Islands is preparing a long-term fiscal strategy \nfor  sustainable  economic  development.  In  coordination  with  this  strategy,  the \nMarshall Islands needs assistance to draft legislation for a fiscal responsibility act. \nThe  current  legislation  is  outdated  and  does  not consider  the  present  economic \nconditions. Under the supervision of the MOF, the RCU will prepare an updated \nfiscal responsibility bill to improve fiscal transparency. The proposed legislation will \ninclude  a  focus  on  the  fiscal  management  of  disaster  risk,  as  well  as  the \nassignment  of  fiscal  responsibility  for  contingent  liabilities  borne  by  the \ngovernment.18 \n\n \n17. \nHuman resources capacity is another cross-cutting enabler of Roadmap implementation. \nThe  RCU  has  moved  forward  with  PFM-related  organizational  reforms,  and  has  undertaken  a \nreview  of  MOF  positions  and  related  job  descriptions.  The  MOF  needs  to  build  capacity  to \ncomplete  timely  and  results-oriented  performance  reviews,  linking  personnel  performance  to \norganizational  performance.  It  also  seeks  to  move  toward  a  performance-based  management \nframework, which is one of the Roadmap reform areas. The RCU will improve the performance \nmanagement process, including through the introduction of standardized performance criteria and \nperformance  evaluation  tools  for  MOF  employees,  and  capacity  building  of  the  MOF  human \nresources staff to conduct performance reviews. \n \n18. \nOutput 2: The MOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement SOE reforms strengthened. \nUnder  the  second  output,  the  RCU  will  help  empower  women to  serve  on  SOE  boards. While \nwomen are well represented in government, with the first female president of the Marshall Islands \nin office since 2016 and several female heads of ministries, only 12 out of 57 SOE board directors \nare women. The government seeks to introduce a more balanced gender representation at board \nlevel (subject to qualifications), and women\u2019s representatives have asked for boardroom training \nso that they are better placed to compete, as the implementation of the SOE Act, 2015, calls for \nskills-based selection of directors.19 The RCU will provide additional training, using customized \ntools to focus on SOE governance skills for women. This will be undertaken in coordination with \ngender champions in the Office of the Chief Secretary and  the Ministry of Culture and Internal \nAffairs (Gender Development Division). \n \n19. \nPerformance indicators. Although the outputs remain unchanged under the additional \nfinancing,  performance  indicators  have  been  added  to  reflect  the  new  reforms  (footnote  14). \nThese  new  performance  indicators  relate  to  tax  reform  legislation  and  fiscal  responsibility \nlegislation  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  PFM  Reform  Steering  Committee,  and  to  female \nrepresentation on SOE boards. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $0.55 million (Table 1).20 The major expenditure item is \n20. \nconsulting services.

The MOF will \ncontinue to be the executing agency, and the RCU will be the implementing agency. The PFM \nReform  Steering  Committee  will  provide  strategic  oversight  and  guidance.  The  consultant \nrecruitment process will be delegated to ADB, but consultants will be engaged by and report to \nthe MOF. \n \n23. \nThe additional financing is expected to mobilize five new short-term intermittent individual \ninternational consultants for Roadmap implementation, who will be part of the RCU during their \nwork. The new consultants will include (i) a tax expert (technical) to prepare a tax administration \nreform plan (120 days); (ii) a tax expert (legal) to work on the tax administration reform plan and \nprepare  the  requisite  legislation  (75  days);  (iii)  an  accountant  to  work  on  the  integrity  of  the \nfinancial  data  for  the  change  in  the  FMIS  (90  days);  (iv)  a  fiscal  expert  to  draft  the  fiscal \nresponsibility legislation (60 days); and (v) a human resources expert to work on the performance \nevaluation system in the MOF (40 days). In the selection of consultants, preference will be given \n\n\f7 \n\nto qualified women. In addition, 70 days will be added to the contract of the RCU advisor to enable \nthe advisor to contribute across the full work stream, and coordinate activities.   \n \n24. \nExisting  RCU  staff  will  undertake  the  SOE  reform  implementation  activities  under  the \nadditional financing. The contract of the SOE reform expert has already  been extended, using \nfunds under the current project, to continue the work stream. Supported by the RCU advisor and \nthe RCU human resources specialist, in consultation with gender champions in the government \n(para. 18), the SOE reform expert will develop special training sessions targeting women for SOE \nboards. \n \n25. \nthe PAM (footnote 21).22 \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated grant closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Implementing agency \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nConsulting services \nAdvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements  \n\nArrangements \n\nOctober 2019\u2013December 2020 \n31 December 2020 \n30 June 2021 \n\nPublic Financial Management Reform Steering Committee \nChief secretary (chair) \nSecretary for Finance, auditor general, attorney general, chair of the Public \nService Commission (members) \nMinistry of Finance \nReform coordination unit \nReform coordination unit, five long-term staff (i) advisor, (ii) public finance \nspecialist, (iii) two financial management specialists, and (iv) human resources \nspecialist. \nIndividual consultant selection \nAdvance contracting for consultants \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank \n\n385 person-days \n\n$476,600 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE  \n\n26. \nThe  economic  analysis  for  the  overall  project  was  revised  to  incorporate  the  additional \nproject costs, using the same methodology as under the current project.23 Direct benefits under \nthe current project will come from the effective use of fiscal space created through a reduction in \nSOE  subsidies\u2014as  CSOs  will  be  identified  and  their  costs  determined, and financing for  SOE \ninefficiencies  reduced.  The  benefit\u2013cost  ratio  of  the  current  project  was  estimated  at  2.2:1.0. \nBenefits from the additional financing will  come from the effective use of fiscal space resulting \nfrom  improved  tax  administration,  which  will  reduce  leakages.  Under  conservative  reform \nscenarios, the Marshall Islands\u2019 tax\u2013GDP ratio is assumed to rise gradually to generate additional \nrevenues  equivalent  to  0.1%  of  GDP  by  the  end  of  FY2024.  The  benefits  of  the  additional \nfinancing  are  estimated  to  total  $1.5  million,  of  which  $1.0  million  is  from  the  effective  use  of \nincreased fiscal space from higher tax revenues and $0.5 million is from multiplier effects. Against \na cost of $550,000, a benefit\u2013cost ratio of 2.8:1.0 is estimated for the additional financing project. \n\n                                                \n22 The implementation arrangements refer to the additional financing.  \n23 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f8 \n\nTherefore, the overall project (including the additional financing) is expected to generate \n27. \nsubstantial economic benefits, with a benefit\u2013cost ratio of 2.3:1.0. The resulting increased fiscal \nspace  can  be  channeled  to  more  productive  uses  (e.g.,  additional  resources  for  essential \ngovernment services such as health and education, which should contribute to steady gains in \nlabor productivity). More public resources can also be channeled to ensuring sufficient funding of \nannual  operation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  assets,  to  preserve  and  prolong  their \nproductivity-enhancing  benefits.  This  analysis  excludes  other  efficiency  gains  in  government \nexpenditure through PFM improvements that are more difficult to quantify. \n \n28. \nThus, the project is considered economically beneficial, particularly given potentially large \nsecond-round effects on broader economic growth and social welfare from improvements in the \nquality  and  efficiency  of  public  expenditure.  Integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh  the  costs.  Ensuring  that  reforms  are  sustainable  may  require  further  development \npartner assistance after project closure, given the low capacity in the MOF. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nFinancial management. A project financial management assessment was prepared for \nthe MOF before the approval of the current project, which indicated that the overall pre-mitigation \nfinancial  management risk  is  substantial. With the  RCU  already  established, qualified  staff  are \nworking closely with the MOF to implement PFM reforms and provide institutional support to the \nMOF, helping to address some of the risks. This is indicated in the updated financial management \nassessment in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nUnder the additional financing, ADB will continue to pay international consultants using \n30. \ndirect payment procedures established under the current project. The RCU will prepare invoices \nand withdrawal applications for MOF review before ADB endorsement. An advance account will \nbe set up for the additional financing project, to be administered by the MOF with RCU assistance. \nThe  advance  account  ceiling  will  not  exceed  $100,000  and  it  will  be  used  for  small  payments \n(e.g., training materials, workshops, project operational expenses, and remuneration of national \nconsultants). \n \nThe MOF will cause detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited by an \n31. \nindependent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  international  standards  on \nauditing and the government\u2019s audit regulations. The MOF will submit the audited project financial \nstatements, together with the auditor\u2019s opinion, to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal \nyear.  The  audited  project  financial  statements  for  FY2018  have  been  submitted  with  an \nunqualified opinion (and a minor delay of 3 days as one of the key signatories was not in Majuro \njust before the submission). \n \nProcurement. A procurement capacity assessment of the MOF, undertaken before the \n32. \ncurrent project was approved, found substantial overall pre-mitigation procurement risk. Issues \nthat  could  affect  project  procurement  include  (i)  weak  external  aid  coordination,  (ii)  the  MOF\u2019s \ninadequate  experience  with  the  international  procurement  of  consultants,  (iii)  the  absence  of \nreliable data on procurement contracts, (iv) insufficient capacity of staff to carry out procurement, \nand (v) inadequate documentation and monitoring on procurement. \n \n33.  With  the  RCU  established,  qualified  staff  are  working  closely  with  the  MOF  to  provide \ninstitutional support, helping to mitigate risks. The government will continue to delegate consultant \nrecruitment to ADB for the additional financing project, as this has worked very successfully for \nthe current project (para. 9). Only individual consultants will be procured under the project, and \n\n\f9 \n\ncontracts  are  not  complex  or  high  value.  All  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time).24 \n \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n34. \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). ADB will conduct integrity due \ndiligence for consultants. Anticorruption issues will continue to be built into the training sessions \nprovided by the RCU, as appropriate. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  overall  project  (including  additional  financing)  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction \n35. \nthrough (i) better PFM systems, which will align budget allocations with sectoral priorities, reduce \nfiscal deficits, and improve government capacity to deal with external shocks (including natural \ndisasters); (ii) increased efficiency of SOEs, which will reduce the fiscal burden of transfers and \nfree up resources for priority development expenditures; and (iii) more transparent identification \nand funding of CSOs, which will help the government minimize the costs of inefficiencies, adjust \nsubsidies, and contract out CSOs. Additional financing will enable the government to meet the \npoverty-related objectives in the National Strategic Plan, and improve the quality of education and \nhealth care, which currently absorb half the budget. Greater resilience to shocks will benefit the \npoor.25 \n \n36. \nThe  current  project  is  classified  some  gender  elements,  as  it  promotes  women\u2019s \nempowerment  through  targets  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  project  training  activities  and  MOF \nmanagement positions. Good progress has been made against DMF targets (para. 8). The MOF \nremains committed to raising the proportion of women in management, subject to qualifications. \nOf  the  six  RCU  consultants  presently  in  position,  four  are  women,  including  both  national \nconsultants. \n \n37. \nThe additional financing project is also classified some gender elements. In recruiting new \nRCU  consultants,  the  project  will  encourage  the  selection  of  qualified  women.  The  additional \nfinancing project includes activities and targets to raise the share of women on SOE boards above \nthe  current  baseline  of  21.5%  (para.  18).  Biannual  progress  reports  prepared  by  the  RCU \npresently include sex-disaggregated data and reporting on gender actions, and this practice will \ncontinue. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n38. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  additional  financing \nproject is category C for environment, indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement because \nthe  project  incorporates  only  advisory  inputs. 26 No  civil  works  are  planned,  and  there  is  no \npotential for  involuntary  land  acquisition  resulting  in  physical  and  economic  displacement. The \ndominant population of the Marshall Islands is indigenous to the islands, and project activities are \ndesigned for the entire economy, with no differentiation in benefits accruing to any group. In the \nabsence of any civil works, there will be no environmental impacts. \n                                                \n24 The ADB norm is to apply the same procurement policy for the current project and any additional financing. \n25 The National Strategic Plan themes include empowering people and communities to reduce the incidence of \u201caccess \nrelated\u201d  poverty  through  social,  economic  environment,  governance,  and  infrastructure  improvements;  and  the \nprovision of necessary services to outer island residents to enable all Marshall Islands citizens to enjoy a high quality \nof life. \n\n26 ADB.

Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nExternal shocks divert \npolitical and administrative \nattention and capacity away \nfrom reforms. \nUnavailability of qualified \nconsultants on time for the \nRCU undermines reform \nefforts. \nLack of or delays in \ndevelopment partner TA \ndelivery impede reforms. \n\nThe project supports the government in building fiscal resilience. However, \nexternal shocks (economic and/or climatic) can disrupt reforms. ADB will respond \nin a timely manner and in coordination with development partners to government \nrequests for assistance, if unforeseen events occur. \nThe government has delegated consultant selection to ADB, and suitable \ncandidates with appropriate experience will be encouraged to apply for RCU \npositions. RCU remuneration under the project will be set to attract good quality \nconsultants. Advance contracting will be undertaken. \nTimely TA from development partners is critical to support the government in \nreform identification, design, and implementation. Regular TA coordination \nmeetings will be organized through the RCU to mobilize and deploy resources. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, RCU = reform coordination unit, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n40. \nThe government and the MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and draft grant agreement. \n \n41. \nwhich are set forth in the draft grant agreement. \n \n\nThe government and the MOF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n42. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$500,000  to the  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the additional financing of the Public Financial Management Project, on \nterms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth  in the draft grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n27 August 2019 \n\n                                                \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n\nCurrent project \nMore effective governance achieveda \n\nOverall project  \nUnchanged \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \n \nCurrent project \n\nPFM improved \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nOverall project \n\nUnchanged \n\nOutputs \n \nCurrent project \n\n \n1.
