THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the additional financing of the Public Financial \nManagement Project.1 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting the Government of the Marshall Islands \nthrough  a  project  grant  to  strengthen  public  financial  management  (PFM).2 The  additional \nfinancing will scale up and extend the benefits of the current project by further helping the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) to prioritize and implement reforms to strengthen PFM in line with the scope of \nthe current project. The proposed additional financing is consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach \n2016\u20132020, which serves as the overall ADB country partnership strategy for the Marshall \nIslands.3 It  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  priority  of  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity, particularly in small island developing countries.4  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development  challenges.  The  rationale  of  the  current  project  remains  valid.  The \nMarshall Islands faces significant challenges stemming from its geographical remoteness and \ndispersion.  Exposure  to  external  shocks  and  heavy  reliance  on  development  assistance \ncompound fragility.5 Economic provisions under the Compact of Free Association with the United \nStates are scheduled to expire in 2023, and long-term fiscal sustainability amid substantially lower \ngrant assistance inflows will be a major challenge. Weak PFM and inefficient state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) are critical constraints to strengthening the fiscal position. \n \n4.  A 2012 public expenditure and financial accountability assessment (latest available) \nhighlighted significant weaknesses in the PFM framework.6 Weaknesses in internal controls, \ncashflow planning, and commitment controls lead to pressure on spending beyond budgetary \nallocations. The tax revenue as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) (16.8% in FY2013\u2013\nFY2017) is below the median of other Pacific small islands (17.4%), indicating room for improving \ntax policy and administration. The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessment shows \nthat the Marshall Islands remains at a high risk of debt distress, with the ratio of public sector debt \nto GDP projected to exceed 50% by 2023 and build up sharply thereafter.7 The performance of \nthe SOE sector is weak in comparison with other Pacific economies. In 2014, the SOE sector \nowned 17%\u201320% of the total capital stock in the economy but contributed only 5.3% to GDP.8 \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017.

The Marshall Islands lacks the institutional capacity to implement PFM and SOE reforms \neffectively. The MOF experiences high turnover and loss of senior staff, and junior staff are often \nunderqualified  or  lack  experience  to  perform  their  functions  adequately.  Expertise  in  SOE \nmonitoring and reforms needs to be built further within the MOF. While several development \npartners (including the World Bank, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre, and the \nGraduate School USA) are assisting PFM reforms, the MOF requires long-term support on the \nground to coordinate this assistance.9  \n \n6.  Current project. An Asian Development Fund grant of $2 million for the current project \nwas approved on 15 October 2017 and became effective on 19 October 2017. The project closing \ndate is 31 December 2020. The current project provides technical support through a reform \ncoordination unit (RCU) comprising long-term consultants based in Majuro to build the MOF\u2019s \ncapacity to implement PFM and SOE reforms. It is considered to be performing well.10 \n \n7.  The RCU envisaged under the current project is established and fully staffed. It acts as \nthe implementing agency reporting to the MOF, under the oversight of the PFM Reform Steering \nCommittee chaired by the chief secretary. The RCU comprises four international consultants: \n(i) an advisor, (ii) two financial management specialists (accounting), and (iii) an SOE monitoring \nand  community  service  obligation  (CSO)  expert.  The  CSO  expert  has  combined  the \nresponsibilities originally outlined for two international consultants because of difficulty finding \nsuitable qualified candidates willing to be based in Majuro for extended periods. Additionally, the \nRCU includes two national consultants: (i) a budget specialist and (ii) a human resources \nspecialist. The RCU is now a recognized and fully functional unit based in Majuro and reporting \nto the MOF, providing advice and technical assistance to the government. \n \n8.  The RCU provides timely biannual reports on project activities and performance, as \nexpected  under  the  implementation  arrangements.  Implementation  results  against  output \nindicators in the design and monitoring framework (DMF) of the current project suggest that it is \non track to meet its expected outcomes. \n(i)  The  RCU  has  updated  the  PFM  Reform  Roadmap  2014\u20132016,11 and  has \ncontributed to various aspects of 10 (of 30) broader reform components in the \nupdated Roadmap (against a target of six in the DMF): (a) a strengthened PFM \nlegal and policy framework, (b) improved cash management, (c) improved local \ngovernment financial management, (d) enhanced PFM reform communications \nand training, (e) better management of Government of the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands embassy imprest accounts, (f) an improved budgeting framework, (g) the \nintroduction of a performance-based management framework, (h) regular annual \nreporting by line ministries, (i) better payroll management, and (j) improved SOE \noversight (footnote 10). \n(ii)  The RCU has prepared a training plan, and conducted 12 trainings and workshops \nin 2018 against a DMF target of at least three a year. Of the 281 attendees, 126 (or \n45%) were female, which exceeds the DMF target of 35%. Training has been \nprovided for grant monitoring procedures, new planning and budgeting templates \nlinking planning and budgeting, SOE monitoring, calculating and costing of CSOs, \nthe role of SOE boards, SOE business planning and statements of corporate intent, \nand human resources planning for the MOF, among others. \n(iii)  As of May 2019, the share of MOF male staff with an accounting, computing, or \nbusiness administration degree and/or diploma has reached 43.1% (22 out of 51) \n                                                \n9  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2014.

", "3 \nagainst a fiscal year (FY) 2017 baseline of 38.2%, while the share for female staff \nhas reached 58.8% (or 20 out of 34) against an FY2017 baseline of 45.1%. \n(iv)  In line with the DMF targets, two women have been appointed to management \npositions: the assistant secretary of tax and revenues and the assistant secretary \nof the Division of International Development Assistance. \n(v)  An SOE monitoring unit was established in May 2018, with two staff in place. The \nstaff are working with the RCU to gain expertise. In March 2019, the position of \nassistant secretary was created to oversee the monitoring unit (among others), \nand the position was filled in June 2019. \n(vi)  A CSO process and framework has been approved, and work to identify and \nassess  the  legitimacy  and  cost  for  four  SOEs  is  ongoing  for  completion  by \nDecember 2019. \n \n9.  Cumulative contract awards totaled $1.715 million (85.8% of ADB financing) as of 30 June \n2019 and cumulative disbursements totaled $0.843 million (42.1% of ADB financing). The current \nproject is classified category C for environment, indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement \nbecause it includes only advisory inputs. Each safeguard covenant item is being complied with. \nThe risks identified in the report and recommendation of the President of the current project have \nbeen managed well. Major risks do not threaten successful project implementation. The risk of \nrecruitment delays was managed because the MOF delegated the recruitment process for \ninternational consultants to ADB, while making the final hiring decisions and engaging the \nconsultants. Advance contracting was used to speed up the process. As a result, the RCU \ninternational  consultants  were  mobilized  within  3  months  of  project  approval.  The  MOF \nsubsequently recruited two national consultants, with assistance from the RCU international \nconsultants. The project is rated on track. The FY2018 audited annual financial statements have \nbeen received with an unqualified opinion from the independent auditor, and publicly disclosed. \n \n10.  Proposed  additional  financing.  The  additional  financing  will  build  on  the  work \nundertaken  through  the  current  project  and  allow  further  PFM  and  SOE  reforms  to  be \nimplemented.  Given  its  successful  performance,  the  government  has  requested  additional \nfinancing to scale up and consolidate activities under the current project, while maintaining its \noverall scope of improving  the MOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement the PFM Reform \nRoadmap and SOE reforms.12 All activities and outputs proposed under the project will contribute \nto the effective implementation of PFM and SOE reforms (paras. 16\u201318), as outlined in the \nupdated PFM Reform Roadmap (para. 8).  \n \n11.  Additional financing for the project complies with ADB eligibility criteria. The project \nremains technically feasible and economically viable (paras. 26\u201328). Proposed activities and \noutputs are aligned with the project\u2019s development objectives of strengthening overall PFM. The \ngovernment accords the planned reforms high priority. \n \n12.  Additional financing is considered a suitable modality since the proposed activities are \nstrongly linked to the design of the current project, and contribute to the same outputs and \noutcomes  regarding  improved  PFM.  Implementation  arrangements  remain  unchanged,  with \nadditional individual consutants expected to be recruited as part of the RCU, under the oversight \nof the MOF. \n                                                \n12 The proposed additional financing is in the Memorandum of Understanding between ADB and the government for \nthe 2019 country programming mission, and is signed by ADB and the government. ADB\u2019s vice-president \n(operations 2) approved the back-to-office report of the country programming mission on 27 May 2019. The additional \nfinancing will be included in the country operations business plan for the 11 small Pacific island countries, expected \nto be circulated to the ADB Board of Directors in August 2019. ", "4 \n13.  The additional financing incorporates lessons learned from the current project. ADB \nengagement  has  demonstrated  the  importance  of  providing  on-the-ground  support  for \ndevelopment  partner  coordination  and  capacity  enhancement.  The  additional  financing  is \ndesigned to provide further locally based support through qualified consultants, and also allows \nflexibility in reform implementation. Delegating the consultant recruitment process to ADB allowed \ninternational consultants to be mobilized quickly (para. 9). Similar processes will be followed for \nconsultant recruitment under the additional financing. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  additional financing  project  is  aligned  with  the following  impact: more  effective \ngovernance achieved.13 The project will have the following outcome: PFM improved.14 The impact \nand outcome of the additional financing project, as well as those of the overall project, remain the \nsame as for the current project.15 The outcome indicators are also unchanged. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The outputs of the additional financing will remain the same as the current project: (i) the \nMOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement the PFM Reform Roadmap strengthened and (ii) the \nMOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement SOE reforms strengthened. Additional activities will be \nundertaken under the two outputs to scale up project benefits, as outlined below (paras. 16\u201318). \n \n16.  Output 1: The MOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement the PFM Reform Roadmap \nstrengthened. To achieve the first output, the RCU will focus on three reform components in the \nrevised Roadmap (footnote 11) under the additional financing. \n(i)  Improved tax administration. The current tax system has several loopholes, as \nevident from tax arrears that have accumulated over time but cannot be accurately \nestimated. A tax reform commission was formed in 2008 and prepared a report on \nreform requirements in 2010.16 The RCU will review and update the report for \nphased implementation. In addition to assisting with a focus on tax arrears, the \nRCU will work with the MOF to explore the introduction of value-added taxes to \nbring in new tax revenue. This is expected to lead to tax reform legislation, which \ncan help improve tax revenue collection. \n(ii)  Strengthened  accounting  systems.  In  2018,  the  Marshall  Islands  secured \nfinancing from the World Bank for a new financial management information system \n(FMIS),  which  has  the  potential  to  significantly  improve  major  government \nprocesses  such  as  budgeting,  procurement,  performance  monitoring,  and \nreporting.17 A critical component of the new FMIS will be a well-designed chart of \naccounts (COA). Although the current FMIS (4Gov) had some elements of a COA, \nallowing for the generation of automated reports such as basic financial statements \nand program-level reports, these were not pursued fully during the initial setup or \nas part of the maintenance process over the years. The RCU will ensure the \nintegrity of financial data as the Marshall Islands moves from 4Gov to the new \nFMIS, including by mapping the old COA codes to the new COA codes and by \nconducting investigations to support the changeover. \n                                                \n13 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2014. National Strategic Plan, 2015\u20132017. Majuro. The plan is being updated. \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 This reflects that the additional financing does not lead to a change in scope for the overall project. \n16 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2010.

Marshall Islands: Project to Strengthen Budget Execution and \nFinancial Reporting Systems. Washington, DC. ", "5 \n(iii)  Strengthened public financial management legal and policy framework. The \nMOF requires technical expertise to support the planning and management of \nreform  measures,  with  a  focus  on  fiscal  planning. With  assistance  from  the \nGraduate School USA, the Marshall Islands is preparing a long-term fiscal strategy \nfor sustainable economic development. In coordination with this strategy, the \nMarshall Islands needs assistance to draft legislation for a fiscal responsibility act. \nThe current legislation is outdated and does not consider the present economic \nconditions. Under the supervision of the MOF, the RCU will prepare an updated \nfiscal responsibility bill to improve fiscal transparency. The proposed legislation will \ninclude  a  focus  on  the  fiscal  management  of  disaster  risk,  as  well  as  the \nassignment  of  fiscal  responsibility  for  contingent  liabilities  borne  by  the \ngovernment.18 \n \n17.  Human resources capacity is another cross-cutting enabler of Roadmap implementation. \nThe RCU has moved forward with PFM-related organizational reforms, and has undertaken a \nreview of MOF positions and related job descriptions. The MOF needs to build capacity to \ncomplete timely and results-oriented performance reviews, linking personnel performance to \norganizational performance. It also seeks to move toward a performance-based management \nframework, which is one of the Roadmap reform areas. The RCU will improve the performance \nmanagement process, including through the introduction of standardized performance criteria and \nperformance evaluation tools for MOF employees, and capacity building of the MOF human \nresources staff to conduct performance reviews. \n \n18.  Output 2: The MOF\u2019s institutional capacity to implement SOE reforms strengthened. \nUnder the second output, the RCU will help empower women to serve on SOE boards. While \nwomen are well represented in government, with the first female president of the Marshall Islands \nin office since 2016 and several female heads of ministries, only 12 out of 57 SOE board directors \nare women. The government seeks to introduce a more balanced gender representation at board \nlevel (subject to qualifications), and women\u2019s representatives have asked for boardroom training \nso that they are better placed to compete, as the implementation of the SOE Act, 2015, calls for \nskills-based selection of directors.19 The RCU will provide additional training, using customized \ntools to focus on SOE governance skills for women. This will be undertaken in coordination with \ngender champions in the Office of the Chief Secretary and the Ministry of Culture and Internal \nAffairs (Gender Development Division). \n \n19.  Performance indicators. Although the outputs remain unchanged under the additional \nfinancing, performance indicators have been added to reflect the new reforms (footnote 14). \nThese  new  performance  indicators  relate  to  tax  reform  legislation  and  fiscal  responsibility \nlegislation expected to be approved by the PFM Reform Steering Committee, and to female \nrepresentation on SOE boards. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $0.55 million (Table 1).20 The major expenditure item is \nconsulting services. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included \nin the updated project administration manual (PAM).21 \n                                                \n18 This activity will have synergies with the disaster resilience program presently under preparation for presentation to \nthe ADB Board of Directors in 2019. \n19 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2015.

Implementation Arrangements \n22.  Project implementation arrangements established for the current project will be used to \nimplement the additional financing, and the PAM has been updated (footnote 21). The MOF will \ncontinue to be the executing agency, and the RCU will be the implementing agency. The PFM \nReform  Steering  Committee  will  provide  strategic  oversight  and  guidance.  The  consultant \nrecruitment process will be delegated to ADB, but consultants will be engaged by and report to \nthe MOF. \n \n23.  The additional financing is expected to mobilize five new short-term intermittent individual \ninternational consultants for Roadmap implementation, who will be part of the RCU during their \nwork. The new consultants will include (i) a tax expert (technical) to prepare a tax administration \nreform plan (120 days); (ii) a tax expert (legal) to work on the tax administration reform plan and \nprepare the requisite legislation (75 days); (iii) an accountant to work on the integrity of the \nfinancial data for the change in the FMIS (90 days); (iv) a fiscal expert to draft the fiscal \nresponsibility legislation (60 days); and (v) a human resources expert to work on the performance \nevaluation system in the MOF (40 days). In the selection of consultants, preference will be given ", "7 \nto qualified women. In addition, 70 days will be added to the contract of the RCU advisor to enable \nthe advisor to contribute across the full work stream, and coordinate activities.   \n \n24.  Existing RCU staff will undertake the SOE reform implementation activities under the \nadditional financing. The contract of the SOE reform expert has already been extended, using \nfunds under the current project, to continue the work stream. Supported by the RCU advisor and \nthe RCU human resources specialist, in consultation with gender champions in the government \n(para. 18), the SOE reform expert will develop special training sessions targeting women for SOE \nboards. \n \n25.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 21).22 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements  \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2019\u2013December 2020 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2020 \nEstimated grant closing date  30 June 2021 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Public Financial Management Reform Steering Committee \nChief secretary (chair) \nSecretary for Finance, auditor general, attorney general, chair of the Public \nService Commission (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(iii)  Implementing agency  Reform coordination unit \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Reform coordination unit, five long-term staff (i) advisor, (ii) public finance \nspecialist, (iii) two financial management specialists, and (iv) human resources \nspecialist. \nConsulting services  Individual consultant selection  385 person-days  $476,600 \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting for consultants \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The economic analysis for the overall project was revised to incorporate the additional \nproject costs, using the same methodology as under the current project.23 Direct benefits under \nthe current project will come from the effective use of fiscal space created through a reduction in \nSOE subsidies\u2014as CSOs will be identified and their costs determined, and financing for SOE \ninefficiencies reduced. The benefit\u2013cost ratio of the current project was estimated at 2.2:1.0. \nBenefits from the additional financing will come from the effective use of fiscal space resulting \nfrom  improved  tax  administration,  which  will  reduce  leakages.  Under  conservative  reform \nscenarios, the Marshall Islands\u2019 tax\u2013GDP ratio is assumed to rise gradually to generate additional \nrevenues equivalent to 0.1% of GDP by the end of FY2024. The benefits of the additional \nfinancing are estimated to total $1.5 million, of which $1.0 million is from the effective use of \nincreased fiscal space from higher tax revenues and $0.5 million is from multiplier effects. Against \na cost of $550,000, a benefit\u2013cost ratio of 2.8:1.0 is estimated for the additional financing project. \n                                                \n22 The implementation arrangements refer to the additional financing.  \n23 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "8 \n27.  Therefore, the overall project (including the additional financing) is expected to generate \nsubstantial economic benefits, with a benefit\u2013cost ratio of 2.3:1.0. The resulting increased fiscal \nspace  can  be  channeled  to more  productive  uses  (e.g.,  additional  resources for essential \ngovernment services such as health and education, which should contribute to steady gains in \nlabor productivity). More public resources can also be channeled to ensuring sufficient funding of \nannual  operation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  assets,  to  preserve  and  prolong  their \nproductivity-enhancing benefits. This analysis excludes other efficiency gains in government \nexpenditure through PFM improvements that are more difficult to quantify. \n \n28.  Thus, the project is considered economically beneficial, particularly given potentially large \nsecond-round effects on broader economic growth and social welfare from improvements in the \nquality and efficiency of public expenditure. Integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. Ensuring that reforms are sustainable may require further development \npartner assistance after project closure, given the low capacity in the MOF. \n \nB.  Governance \n29.  Financial management. A project financial management assessment was prepared for \nthe MOF before the approval of the current project, which indicated that the overall pre-mitigation \nfinancial management risk is substantial. With the RCU already established, qualified staff are \nworking closely with the MOF to implement PFM reforms and provide institutional support to the \nMOF, helping to address some of the risks. This is indicated in the updated financial management \nassessment in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \n30.  Under the additional financing, ADB will continue to pay international consultants using \ndirect payment procedures established under the current project. The RCU will prepare invoices \nand withdrawal applications for MOF review before ADB endorsement. An advance account will \nbe set up for the additional financing project, to be administered by the MOF with RCU assistance. \nThe advance account ceiling will not exceed $100,000 and it will be used for small payments \n(e.g., training materials, workshops, project operational expenses, and remuneration of national \nconsultants). \n \n31.  The MOF will cause detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited by an \nindependent auditor acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with international standards on \nauditing and the government\u2019s audit regulations. The MOF will submit the audited project financial \nstatements, together with the auditor\u2019s opinion, to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal \nyear.  The  audited  project  financial  statements  for  FY2018  have  been  submitted  with  an \nunqualified opinion (and a minor delay of 3 days as one of the key signatories was not in Majuro \njust before the submission). \n \n32.  Procurement. A procurement capacity assessment of the MOF, undertaken before the \ncurrent project was approved, found substantial overall pre-mitigation procurement risk. Issues \nthat could affect project procurement include (i) weak external aid coordination, (ii) the MOF\u2019s \ninadequate experience with the international procurement of consultants, (iii) the absence of \nreliable data on procurement contracts, (iv) insufficient capacity of staff to carry out procurement, \nand (v) inadequate documentation and monitoring on procurement. \n \n33.  With the RCU established, qualified staff are working closely with the MOF to provide \ninstitutional support, helping to mitigate risks. The government will continue to delegate consultant \nrecruitment to ADB for the additional financing project, as this has worked very successfully for \nthe current project (para. 9). Only individual consultants will be procured under the project, and ", "9 \ncontracts  are  not  complex  or  high  value.  All  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time).24 \n \n34.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and the MOF. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). ADB will conduct integrity due \ndiligence for consultants. Anticorruption issues will continue to be built into the training sessions \nprovided by the RCU, as appropriate. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n35.  The overall project (including additional financing) will contribute to poverty reduction \nthrough (i) better PFM systems, which will align budget allocations with sectoral priorities, reduce \nfiscal deficits, and improve government capacity to deal with external shocks (including natural \ndisasters); (ii) increased efficiency of SOEs, which will reduce the fiscal burden of transfers and \nfree up resources for priority development expenditures; and (iii) more transparent identification \nand funding of CSOs, which will help the government minimize the costs of inefficiencies, adjust \nsubsidies, and contract out CSOs. Additional financing will enable the government to meet the \npoverty-related objectives in the National Strategic Plan, and improve the quality of education and \nhealth care, which currently absorb half the budget. Greater resilience to shocks will benefit the \npoor.25 \n \n36.  The  current  project  is  classified  some  gender  elements,  as  it  promotes  women\u2019s \nempowerment through targets for women\u2019s participation in project training activities and MOF \nmanagement positions. Good progress has been made against DMF targets (para. 8). The MOF \nremains committed to raising the proportion of women in management, subject to qualifications. \nOf the six RCU consultants presently in position, four are women, including both national \nconsultants. \n \n37.  The additional financing project is also classified some gender elements. In recruiting new \nRCU consultants, the project will encourage the selection of qualified women. The additional \nfinancing project includes activities and targets to raise the share of women on SOE boards above \nthe current baseline of 21.5% (para. 18). Biannual progress reports prepared by the RCU \npresently include sex-disaggregated data and reporting on gender actions, and this practice will \ncontinue. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n38.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the additional financing \nproject is category C for environment, indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement because \nthe project incorporates only advisory inputs.26 No civil works are planned, and there is no \npotential for involuntary land acquisition resulting in physical and economic displacement. The \ndominant population of the Marshall Islands is indigenous to the islands, and project activities are \ndesigned for the entire economy, with no differentiation in benefits accruing to any group. In the \nabsence of any civil works, there will be no environmental impacts. \n                                                \n24 The ADB norm is to apply the same procurement policy for the current project and any additional financing. \n25 The National Strategic Plan themes include empowering people and communities to reduce the incidence of \u201caccess \nrelated\u201d poverty through social, economic environment, governance, and infrastructure improvements; and the \nprovision of necessary services to outer island residents to enable all Marshall Islands citizens to enjoy a high quality \nof life. \n26 ADB.

ASSURANCES \n40.  The government and the MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and draft grant agreement. \n \n41.  The government and the MOF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the draft grant agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$500,000 to the Republic of the Marshall Islands from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the additional financing of the Public Financial Management Project, on \nterms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n27 August 2019 \n                                                \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
