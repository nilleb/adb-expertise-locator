THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed project \nreadiness loan to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Transport Sector Preparatory Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project readiness financing (PRF) project will finance the preparation of the \nfeasibility  study  and  the  detailed  engineering  design,  including  bidding  documents  and \nprocurement support for three ensuing projects along the northern region road corridor and within \nthe core road network of the Highlands region, to achieve high-level readiness and to ensure \ntimely and cost-effective achievement of the outcomes of such projects. \n \nII.  PROJECT READINESS FINANCING \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic context. PNG\u2019s long-term transport development goals are encapsulated in the \ncountry\u2019s  National  Strategic  Plan  (Vision  2050)  as  an  economic  development  framework.1 \nVision 2050 identified the development of human capital and wealth creation as the country\u2019s top \npriorities, with the expansion of transport services underscoring all these goals. The PNG \nDevelopment Strategic Plan, 2010\u20132030 aims to increase the country\u2019s share of national roads \nin good condition from 33% in 2010 to 100% by 2030, in addition to tripling the network length to \n25,000 kilometers (km).2 This strategy recognizes the northern region road corridor as one of the \nmost critical economic corridors in PNG. Improving the corridor is also in line with the National \nTransport  Strategy,  2014\u20132030,  which  is  the  government\u2019s  road  map  for  transport  sector \ndevelopment.3 The Medium Term Development Plan III, 2018\u20132022 serves as the national policy \nframework to deliver the key development outcomes, with a rolling 5-year investment plan.4 The \nnorthern region corridor program is identified as a priority investment also in both the Medium-\nTerm Development Plan III and the National Road Network Strategy, 2018\u20132037.5 \n \n4.  Improvement needs. The northern region road corridor starts at the Indonesian\u2013PNG \nborder at Wutung near Vanimo (capital of West Sepik Province) and extends southeast along the \nnorthern coast to Wewak (capital of East Sepik Province) and Madang (capital of Madang \nProvince), then farther south via Lae (capital of Morobe Province) and finally to Kerema (capital \nof Gulf Province) on the south coast of New Guinea island. The total length of the northern region \ncorridor is 1,457 km. It connects the ports of Vanimo, Wewak, Madang, and Lae to the Highlands \nhighway and southern region corridor. The existing northern region road is largely in very poor \ncondition. Significant parts are unpaved earth roads and many of them are single lanes that need \nto be widened to two lanes. The route includes three missing links: (i) Vanimo\u2013Aitape (106 km), \n(ii) Bogia\u2013Angoram (101 km), and (iii) Wau\u2013Malalaua (133 km). It will be very challenging to \ncomplete the route, given the total length, the swampy terrain in the Sepik region, and the \nmountainous terrain in Morobe and Gulf provinces. Vanimo and Wewak ports are potential hubs \n \n1  Government of PNG, National Strategic Plan Taskforce. 2011. Papua New Guinea Vision 2050.

Vanimo and Wewak have no customs \nfacilities. Servicing international maritime trade from Vanimo and Wewak to Indonesia and beyond \nwill play a key role in the economic growth of the northern coast area. \n \n5.  Value added by ADB assistance. The Government of PNG has requested the support \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to (i) improve the northern region corridor and (ii) continue \nthe improvement of the core road network of the Highlands region. ADB is supporting the \ngovernment  through  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  financial  analysis,  risk  and \nprocurement assessments, financial management assessment, sector assessment, climate risk \nvulnerability assessment, gender assessment and gender action plan, and poverty and social \nassessment for these projects.6 As both the government and ADB are paying increasing attention \nto  the  readiness  of  projects  to  be  approved,  and  recognizing  lessons  from  the  ongoing \nmultitranche  financing  facilities  (MFFs),  additional  support  is  required.  In  this  regard,  the \ngovernment requested ADB to provide a PRF for the feasibility study, detailed design, and related \nactivities  in  parallel  with  the  TA  to  (i) achieve  high-level  readiness,  (ii)  ensure  smooth \ncommencement of procurement and other implementation activities, and (iii) ensure timely and \ncost-effective achievement of the project outcomes. Packaging the feasibility study, detailed \ndesign, and safeguard studies to be prepared by the same consultancy assignment will ensure \nthe design incorporates all safeguard mitigation measures. The objective is to design MFFs for \ntwo ensuing programs and one stand-alone project. The PRF will also expand and complement \nongoing MFFs and represent significant value added for the government\u2019s investment in the road \ntransport subsector by providing further capacity support to supplement ongoing investment \nprograms and integrate findings and lessons from previous experience into the project designs. \nInvestment in infrastructure can also aid the post coronavirus disease (COVID-19) economic \nrecovery. \n \n6.  Consistency with the ADB Strategy. The PRF is aligned with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, \n2016\u20132020 by supporting the target to reduce costs through improving domestic and regional \nconnectivity via transport infrastructure, managing risks, and enabling value creation.7 The PRF \nis also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, by (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities, (ii) promoting rural development and food security, and (iii) strengthening governance \nand institutional capacity, as it will support physical designs of transport network to improve \naccess.8 Entry points for gender mainstreaming in the ensuing projects will be explored through \nPRF and TA activities. The PRF is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for PNG, 2016\u2013\n2020, which supports more efficient, safer movement of people and goods\u2014one of the core areas \nof government sector objectives in the country partnership strategy.9 The MFFs, PRF, and TA to \nsupport the design of investment programs are included in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan, 2020\u20132022 for PNG.10 It is expected that the ensuing stand-alone project (Lae\u2013Malalaua) \nwill be included in the country operations business plan 2021\u20132023. \n \n \n6  ADB.

Three MFFs were \napproved, two for national road development and one for aviation development, between 2008\u2013\n2019.11 The government and ADB agreed to improve project readiness in future projects, given \nthat the Sustainable Highlands Highway investment program has encountered implementation \ndelays. The completion report of project 1 of the Highlands Region Road investment program also \nrecommended  that  consulting  services  be  in  place  well  before  construction  starts,  and \nemphasized that future projects need to address weak procurement procedures.12 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Feasibility study, including option analysis, environmental and social \nsafeguard  studies,  detailed  engineering  design,  bidding  documents,  and  advance \nprocurement actions for ensuing projects completed. The PRF will support the preparation \nactivities  of  the  proposed  ensuing  projects  by  preparing  the  feasibility  studies,  including \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards;  the  detailed  engineering  designs;  and  the  bidding \ndocuments, including procurement support for three ensuing projects. \n \n9.  Output  2:  Capacity  of  executing  agencies  and  implementing  unit  for  project \nmanagement improved. The PRF will finance financial audits and project pre-implementation \ncapacity-building activities for executing agencies linked to the ensuing projects by establishing a \nproject implementation unit (PIU) within the Department of Works and Implementation (DOW). \n \nC.  Ensuing Projects \n \n10.  Northern region road corridor (Momase international highway) from Wutung to \nAngoram. This section will be the first phase of the proposed MFF program to improve the \nexisting road from Wutung to Angoram, including (i) the construction of the missing link from \nVanimo to Aitape, with a total length of 440 km; and (ii) upgrading of Vanimo and Wewak ports.13 \nThe indicative financing amount of the program is $630 million, and the expected year of approval \nof the program and tranche 1 is 2021.14 \n \n11.  Northern  region  road  corridor  from  Lae  to  Malalaua  via  Bulolo  (Trans-Island \nhighway). This project will improve the Trans-Island highway from Lae to Malalaua, with a total \nlength of 308 km, including rehabilitating the existing road from Lae to Meniyama and constructing \nthe missing link of 190 km from Meniyama to Malalaua. The PRF will prepare the feasibility study \nand the detailed design for the project road. The indicative financing amount is $200 million and \nthe expected year of approval is 2022. \n \n12.  Highlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program, Phase 2. The PRF will \nprepare a new MFF, which will be a continuation of the existing Highlands Region investment \nprogram. The second phase of the Highlands Region investment program will improve about \n500 km of roads of the Highlands core road network. The PRF will prepare the detailed designs \n \n11 ADB.

The PIU will establish tentatively three project design offices (PDOs) within the DOW \nprovincial office premises in West Sepik, Morobe, and Western Highlands provinces. The PIU \nand PDOs will be supported and coordinated by the existing project management unit (PMU), \nwhich is based in Port Moresby. The PIU will enable the timely start-up and preparation of the \nensuing  projects  and,  through  support  from  consultants,  provide  on-the-job  training  and \nknowledge transfer to the executing agencies. \n \n18.  Consulting services. The government delegated the consultants\u2019 selection from the \nexecuting agencies to ADB. The executing agencies and ADB will jointly prepare the terms of \nreference, budget estimates, and short-listing criteria; and recommend the choice of selection \nmethod. The DOW will negotiate the contract with the first-ranked firm; and the DOW, the \nDepartment  of  Transport  (DOT),  and  consultants  will  sign  the  contracts.  ADB  may  assist \nnegotiations, if required. The recruitment of all consultants will follow the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time), Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time), and associated staff instructions. ADB has advised the borrower that \napproval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the PRF. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n19.  The PRF will support the preparation of the feasibility studies, including option analysis, \nenvironmental assessment, and resettlement plan; detailed design; and bidding documents, \nincluding support for bidding of the works for the ensuing projects. The designs to be prepared \n ", "6 \nwill include necessary road safety features and will be subject to road safety audits. The roads to \nbe improved will follow the existing alignment to the extent possible to minimize land acquisition \nand because the road corridor available is typically limited by mountainous terrain and/or the sea. \nThe designs to be prepared will integrate any measures needed to (i) promote resilience to climate \nchange and disasters triggered by natural hazards, (ii) encourage benefits for women, and \n(iii) contribute to gender equality. The tentative gender category for the ensuing projects is \neffective gender mainstreaming or some gender elements.18 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n20.  Financial management. ADB has conducted a financial management assessment (FMA) \nfollowing its financial management guidelines. The assessment considered the DOW and DOT \nas the executing agencies and the PIU to manage project implementation. The FMA identified \nseveral financial management risks in staffing, reporting and monitoring, information systems, \naudits, and funds flow. The project procurement-related reviews (PPRRs) prepared by ADB\u2019s \nOffice  of  Anticorruption  and  Integrity  highlighted  continuing  weaknesses  in  financial \nmanagement.19 Several mitigating measures have been implemented since the previous FMA in \n2017, but further measures are proposed for the satisfactory implementation of the project and \nconsidering that the PRF will finance only consulting services. The most relevant mitigating \nmeasures are (i) the recruitment of qualified accounting staff for the new PIU supported by \ntargeted training on ADB financial management, (ii) inclusion of the PRF in the audit plan of the \nInternal  Audit  Division, and  (iii)  expediting  the implementation  of  the  international  financial \nmanagement system to include all regional and provincial offices under a unified system. The \nestablishment of a separate account is a requirement before the disbursement of the initial \nadvance by ADB. The detailed risk management plan is in the PAM (footnote17). The financial \nrisk is substantial.  \n \n21.  Procurement. ADB conducted a procurement capacity assessment of the DOW and the \nPMU under the DOW, as part of the preparation of the sustainable Highlands investment program \nin 2017. The assessment identified substantial risks in staffing and effectiveness; and moderate \nrisks  in  information  management,  the  procurement  practices  of  consulting  services,  and \naccountability measures. The procurement risk identified in the areas of PMU staffing and \nprocurement practices still exists, but some progress has been achieved since 2017. Additional \nstaff, including international specialists for the ADB PMU, was recruited in 2018. They and other \nDOW staff have prepared procurement documents, which resulted in the award of several large \nworks and consulting contracts. Consequently, the procurement of goods and works and the \nrecruitment of consultant services by the DOW have become more efficient and are conducted in \nadherence  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy,  regulations  and  guidelines,  with  quality  and \ntransparency acceptable to ADB. In 2019, ADB provided formal procurement training to the \nexecuting agencies and implementing agencies including the DOW. The training reviewed and \ndiscussed procurement issues based on findings reflected in two PPRRs prepared in June 2017 \n(footnote 19). Therefore, the risks involved in procuring consulting services are considered lower \n \n18 Gender due diligence (including gender analysis) and financial due diligence (including financial analysis) are \nactivities included in the scope of work of the consultants preparing due diligence for the ensuing projects to be \nfinanced through separate TA. \n19 ADB. 2017.

Overall. The overall inherent and project risk is substantial. Key risk mitigation measures \nare listed above and discussed in more detail in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n23.  Since the proposed activities consist of consulting services only, activities have not been \ncategorized per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The anticipated safeguard categories \nfor  all  ensuing  projects  are  category  B  for  the  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples, based on existing transport projects in PNG \nwith a similar scope of work. The final categorization will be confirmed early during the studies, \nbased on the documentation of baselines. The updated safeguard documents, and, if required, \nclearance under the country system and environmental permits issued by the Conservation and \nEnvironmental Protect Authority and any conditions included in the permits, will form part of the \nbidding documents.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n24.  The government has assured ADB that PRF implementation shall conform to all applicable \nADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender, \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan \ndocuments. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n25.  I am satisfied that the proposed project readiness loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $31,000,000 to Papua New Guinea for the Transport Sector Preparatory Project, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of \n2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n16 July 2020\n ", "8  Appendix \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=53325-001-3  \n \n \n1.
