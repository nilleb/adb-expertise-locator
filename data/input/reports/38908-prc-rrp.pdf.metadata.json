They account for almost half of the gross domestic product \n(GDP), two-thirds of industrial value added, 60% of exports, and 40% of fiscal revenues.3 SMEs \nalso  provide  75%  of  urban  and  rural  employment.  Private  SMEs  have  grown  more  quickly  than \nthe larger state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The industrial output of SMEs has been increasing at \nan average annual rate of 30%, compared to 20% for the industry as a whole.4 Consequently, the \ndevelopment of SMEs is an important engine of growth and a key contributor to poverty reduction \nby creating employment, increasing individual incomes, and generating tax revenues in the PRC. \n \n4. \nSMEs  rely  heavily  on  access  to  external  capital  to  finance  their  operations.  However, \nmore  than  80%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  SMEs  have  difficulty  accessing  financial  services  and  securing \nfinancing.5  Although  bank  loans  in  the  PRC  account  for  70%  of  total  external  financing,  as  the \ncorporate bond market is underdeveloped, only 30% of PRC SMEs have access to bank lending \n(mostly  for  working  capital).  Lack  of  access  to  bank  lending  is  considered  the  main  financing \ndifficulty and a stumbling block for sustaining SME growth. \n \n5. \nreasons:  \n \n\nThe  limitation  of  banking  services  available  to  SMEs  is  mainly  due  to  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nState-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs)  are  not  geared  to  service  SMEs, \nparticularly  private  ones.  PRC  banks  have  a  strong  state-sector  bias,  and  the \nperception  prevails  that  SMEs  are  not  creditworthy  borrowers.  This  is  especially \ntrue  of  the  four  big  SOCBs  that  dominate  bank  finance  in  the  PRC  with  60%  of \ntotal  PRC  bank  lending,  which  have  the  reputation  of  being  unwilling  to  lend  to \nSMEs, as their traditional customers are large SOEs and shareholding companies.  \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004.

The  high  frequency  and  short-term  nature  of  SME \nloans,  unfamiliar  markets,  ownership  structures  that  are  often  complicated,  and \nlack of sufficient and reliable operational and financial data for loan appraisal have \nresulted  in  high  business  development  and  administration  costs  for  banks.6 \nBecause  of  the  long  process  of  recognition,  registration,  and  evaluation  for  the \nSME  borrower\u2019s  collateral,  banks  have  difficulty  meeting  SMEs\u2019  frequent  and \nseasonal demand for debt.  \n\nTo reduce nonperforming loans, many commercial banks have adopted a policy of \npermanently  assigning  the  responsibility  of  loan  performance  to  the  loan  officers. \nThis  has  resulted  in  acute  risk  aversion  at  the  sub  branch  and  loan  officer  level, \ncurtailing loans to SMEs. \n\nThe PRC does not have a diversified financial sector capable of serving SMEs, as \nfinancial institutions specialized to provide loans for SMEs are lacking.  \n\nCredit allocation is distorted by a continued policy of lending through government-\nowned banks and restrictions on competition from foreign financial institutions. \n\nGuarantees offered by the SMEs are often insufficient to support their borrowings. \nReal  estate  and  equipment  are  the  major  forms  of  collateral  taken  by  the  banks. \nHowever,  most  SMEs,  especially  privately  owned  ones,  cannot  provide  such \ncollateral. In addition, the value of collateral available for loans is reduced following \nthe discount at which banks value it. Based on a survey conducted by the People\u2019s \nBank  of  China  (PBOC),  the  discount  rates  are  50\u201370%  for  real  estate  and \nequipment.  \n\n \n(vii)  Most importantly, while PBOC allows bank lending rates for SMEs to deviate within \na  band  from  the  lending  base  rate,7  the  maximum  rate  remains  insufficient  to \ncompensate  banks  for  the  higher  risk  that  SME  borrowers  represent  unless \nguaranteed by a third party of better credit standing.8 \n\nRole and Development of Credit Guarantee Companies \n\nTo ease constraints arising from the guarantee requirement for SME borrowing, business \n6. \norganizations,  local  governments,  and  individuals  have  been  encouraged  by  the  PRC \nGovernment to establish CGCs and so facilitate bank lending to SMEs. State-owned CGCs were \nfirst introduced in the early to mid-1990s, while private sector CGCs started receiving licenses by \n1999. By end of 2006, the number of CGCs in the PRC is expected to exceed 3,000.  \n\n                                                 \n6  According to the State Information  Center, over half of all SMEs lack  proper financial  management, and  over 60% \nhave a credit rating of BBB or worse. Over 80% of bank loans go to AAA or AA-rated enterprises. Over half of the \nSMEs have only a single product line, and 70% do not have a stable customer base. SMEs borrow five times more \nfrequently  than  large  enterprises.  However,  the  average  size  of  an  SME  loan  is  only  about  5%  of  that  of  a  large \nenterprise, and the administration cost is about five times higher. \n\n7   Currently 1.7 times the base rate of 5.3%. \n8  ADB. 2003. Private Sector Assessment in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila; International Finance Corporation. \n2000.  The  PRC  Emerging  Private  Sector.  Washington,  DC.;  ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for the Development of SME Credit Guarantee Companies. Manila. \n\n\f  3\n\n \n7. \nAn  estimated  60%  of  all  bank  loans  in  the  PRC  are  supported  by  a  guarantee  of  some \nkind.  However,  of  these  guarantees,  approximately  90%  are  intra-group  and  parent  company \nguarantees wherein an affiliated company guarantees the liabilities of other group companies, 5% \nare  government  guarantees,  and  only  about  5%  are  provided  by  specialized  CGCs,  of  which \nprivate sector CGCs account for only about 1% of guarantees outstanding.9\n \n8. \nOf  the  approximately  8  million  SMEs  nationwide,  CGCs  currently  serve  only  48,000,  or \n0.6%.  This  mismatch  of  market  demand  and  supply  is  a  result  of  several  factors:  (i)  most \ngovernment-funded CGCs lack an optimal corporate structure or commercially oriented decision-\nmaking functions; (ii) the capital base of most CGCs is too small to meet the growing demand for \ncredit to SMEs; (iii) with limited capacity to assess the risks associated with expanded guarantee \nproducts,  many  CGCs  do  not  maximize  the  utilization  of  their  capital  bases,  and  those  that  are \nsmaller  or  lack  track  records  have  limited  credibility  with  banks  and  so  need  to  pledge  as \ncollateral their own cash deposited with the lending bank for acceptance. As a result, most CGCs, \nespecially those established for policy reasons, are small and inactive.  \n \n9. \nPRC  CGCs  do  not  have  directly  comparable  counterparts  in  more  developed  markets, \nsuch as Europe. In more developed markets, working capital in SMEs, as in larger companies, is \nmainly obtained from the revenues generated by the enterprise (or by supplier credit, which often \nprovides the SME with sufficient time to generate enough revenues to pay all its bills). If revenues \ndo not optimally match the need for working capital, commercial banks provide credit lines to the \nSME.  The  flexible  current  account  facility  is  the  main  banking  product  that  is  offered  to  SMEs. \nThis loan may be guaranteed personally by the entrepreneur, particularly in the case of a recent \ncustomer  relationship  between  the  bank  as  lender  and  the  SME,  but  guarantees  from \nnongovernmental  third  parties  are  not  commonly  used.  Banks  in developed  markets  have  deep \nand  stable  relationships  with  SMEs,  a  particular  business  focus  on  SMEs,  and  the  ability  to \nthoroughly evaluate and price SME credit risk. As these elements are still developing in the PRC \nbanking  sector,  CGCs  address  a  particular  weakness  and  are  very  much  justified  as  a \nsustainable business model until the PRC banking sector has made significant progress. \n \n10. \nA few CGCs including COG have succeeded in filling this gap by creating thriving niches \nin specialized sectors where commercial banks lack experience or incentives for assessing SME \ncredit risk. These CGCs have garnered credibility with banks and, as a result, enjoy less stringent \nrequirements for cash deposits as security for loans. Such companies are widely seen as leading \nthe development of the sector and assuming a greater role as financial intermediaries in the PRC \n(see Appendix 1 for a sector analysis of the credit guarantee market in the PRC). \n \nC. \n\nSector Policies and Regulations \n\nThe sector is not formally regulated but under the oversight of the National Development \n11. \nand  Reform  Commission  (NDRC),  which  has  issued  Guidelines  on  Developing  the  SME  Credit \nGuaranty System10 to facilitate the establishment of an SME credit guarantee system across the \ncountry. The guidelines also cover (i) prudential capital adequacy ratios (governing the maximum \nvalue of guarantees outstanding compared to registered capital); (ii) the maximum guarantee fee \nchargeable  (as  a  maximum  percent  of  the  loan  interest  rate,  which  is  itself  regulated);  and  (iii) \nsuch  other  issues  as  risk  management  policies  and  limitation  on  geographic  expansion.  In \n\n                                                 \n9   Discussion with PBOC and COG staff. \n10 NDRC. 1999. Guidelines on Developing the SME Credit Guaranty System. Beijing. \n\n \n\n\faddition,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  has  issued  Interim  Administrative  Measures  on  the  Risk \nManagement  of  SME  Financing  Guarantee  Institutions,  a  Notice  on  Strengthening  Financial \nAdministration,11  and  Policy  Support  for  SME  Credit  Guarantee  Institutions  by  Local  Finance \nBureaus12  to  clarify  the  government\u2019s  risk  management  of,  and  policy  support  for,  SME  credit \nguarantee  institutions.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  is  also  working  on  draft  accounting  methods  for \nguarantee institutions to enhance correct information disclosure. \n \nFurthermore,  administrative  measures13  proposed  in  early  2004  contain  more  detailed \n12. \nguidelines.  The  proposed  measures  include  the  requirement  for  a  minimum  capitalization  of \nCNY500 million for national CGCs, CNY200 million for province-wide CGCs, and CNY50 million \nfor municipal CGCs. Moreover, to establish prudential operations, the measures propose that the \nguarantee-to-capital multiplier not exceed 10 times, and the maximum amount of a guarantee for \nany  customer  not  exceed  10%  of  the  CGC's  net  asset  value.  The  proposed  measures  also \nstipulate that 50% of guarantee fees be set aside as reserves for outstanding liabilities and that \nannual provisioning be required for 1% of outstanding guarantee liability, up to an aggregate level \nof 10%.14\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n\nThe Investee Company  \n\n \nA. \n \n13. \nCOG,  an  off-shore  holding  company  with  several  subsidiaries  in  the  PRC,  is  a  leading \nprovider of guarantee products and services in the country. The company is primarily engaged in \nproviding  financial  guarantees,  entrusted  lending,  and  related  advisory  services  to  SMEs  and \nindividual customers. It is one of the few CGCs with operations in multiple high-growth regions in \nthe PRC including the Pearl and Yangtze deltas and Capital Economic Zone. Unlike many state-\nowned CGCs, COG provides guarantees only to private sector SMEs and individuals.   \n \nB. \n\nPrevious ADB Investment and Engagement \n\nIn  April  2005,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  invested  $10  million  in  COG.15  In \n14. \nOctober  2005,  Citigroup  Venture  Capital  International  (CVCI)  and,  in  March  2006,  the  Carlyle \nGroup  (Carlyle)  each  invested  $25  million  as  follow-on  investments  directly  sourced  and \ncatalyzed  by  ADB.  The  capital  infusion  was  used  to  finance  the  expansion  of  the  company\u2019s \nguarantee business through the increase in paid-in registered capital of COG\u2019s PRC subsidiaries.   \n \nADB has played an active role in the development of COG in the past 18 months through \n15. \nits  board  representation,  especially  with  respect  to  (i)  revamping  its  credit  approval  process, (ii) \nenhancing  its  information  technology  systems,  and  (iii)  key  hires  of  senior  management \npersonnel. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n11 Ministry of Finance. 2001.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Equity \n\nInvestment in Shenzhen Orienwise Guarantee and Investment Co., Ltd. Manila. \n\n 4 \n\n  \n\n\f  5\n\nC. \n\nCorporate Structure and IPO Plans \n\nCOG  undertook  a  series  of  restructuring \n\n16. \nin  2004  and  2005.  The \nreorganization effectively created a holding company domiciled in the Cayman Islands,16 which is \nin line with standard Hong Kong market practice for listings by PRC companies.17  \n \nD. \n\nBusiness Description   \n\ntransactions \n\nAlthough COG has a market share of only about 2.4% in terms of registered capital, it is \n17. \none of the largest private guarantee companies in the PRC. Its key businesses include corporate, \nindividual, and performance guarantees; entrusted lending; and advisory services. The company \ndoes almost all of its corporate business with SMEs.   \n \n18. \nThe underserved financing needs of SMEs and the PRC's underdeveloped credit culture \nhave together acted as the key drivers behind COG\u2019s quick growth and the high profitability of its \nguarantee and entrusted loan businesses.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nProposed Equity Investment \n\n19. \nThe  proposed  ADB  investment  will  be  in  the  equity  capital  of  COG  for  a  stake  of  up  to \n2.0%.  The  transaction  will  bring  ADB\u2019s  total  equity  stake  in  COG  to  5.98%,  from  its  current \nownership  stake  of  4.81%.  ADB  will  not  acquire  a  stake  in  COG  larger  than  9.9%  to  avoid \nbecoming a \u201csubstantial shareholder\u201d or \"connected party\u201d18 under Hong Kong Stock Exchange \nlisting rules. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n16  The  Cayman  Islands\u2019  legal  system  is  based  on  British  law,  and  therefore  the  legal  concepts  are  familiar  and \nacceptable  to  international  investors.  The  Cayman  Islands  comply  with  the  standards  set  by  the  Organization  for \nEconomic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  Financial  Action  Task  Force  (FATF).  In  addition,  the  Cayman \nIslands  have  responded  to  the  \"harmful  tax  practice\"  initiative  of  the  OECD  by  giving  an  advance  commitment  to \nOECD, which kept the Cayman Islands off the OECD official list of tax havens published in June 2000. OECD has \nconfirmed that the Cayman Islands system of no direct taxes is not in itself considered harmful.  \n\n17 Most PRC companies seeking a listing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange incorporate their listed companies in the \nCayman  Islands.  ADB\u2019s  external  counsel  and  COG\u2019s  external  counsel  have  confirmed  that,  in  the  present \ncircumstances, a direct listing of COG as a PRC entity is not feasible, as listing would require, inter alia, transforming \nCOG  from  a  Sino-foreign  joint  venture  into  a  \"company  limited  by  shares.\"  This  involves  a  highly  bureaucratic \nprocess,  which  is  why  PRC  companies  tend  to  use  an  offshore  jurisdiction  accepted  by  the  Hong  Kong  Stock \nExchange. Among the possible choices (Hong Kong, Cayman Islands, or Bermuda), the Cayman Islands is generally \nregarded  as  desirable  because  (i)  the  legal  requirements  regarding  capital  reduction  and  the  distribution  of  capital \nare less complicated than are those in Hong Kong, (ii) Hong Kong stamp duty is not chargeable for share transfers \nthat  take  place  prior  to  the  IPO,  and  (iii)  the  Cayman  Islands  are  FATF  compliant  and  not  on  OECD\u2019s  tax  haven \nblacklist.  \n\n18 ADB plans to introduce best management practices and credit-risk procedures to COG, and PSOD and COG may \nalso cooperate in further business development and will enter into a memorandum of understanding in this regard. \nHowever, if ADB owns more than 9.9% of COG at its initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hong \nKong listing rules will (i) require shareholders\u2019 approval for each transaction between ADB and COG in the future and \n(ii) impose certain liabilities on ADB resulting from having a director on the board of Orienwise and ADB\u2019s mention in \nthe prospectus. To avoid these liabilities, ADB decided to stay below the threshold of a connected party. \n\n \n\n\fV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nJustification for the ADB Investment \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Objective  \n\n20. \nADB\u2019s objective in the proposed investment is to reorganize COG\u2019s shareholdings.   The \nproposed  investment  and  the  acquisition  of  certain  minority  shareholdings  is  essential  to \nreorganizing  COG\u2019s  shareholdings,  in  order  to  bring  the  Company\u2019s  planned  IPO  closer  to \nrealization.  The  follow-on  investment  is  a  clear  signal  of  ADB\u2019s  continuing  support  to  COG \nespecially at a time when market perception is critical.  ADB\u2019s vote of confidence in the company \nwill send a positive signal to the investment community regarding COG\u2019s credibility, which could \nattract  strategic  and  business  partners  needed  as  the  business  model  expands  beyond  the \ncurrent  guarantee  products.    A  successful  investment  into,  and  exit  from,  COG  will  also \ndemonstrate to other potential investors the attractiveness of investing in other strong CGCs, thus \npromoting private sector investment transactions in the CGC market.   \n\n \n2. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\n21. \nGiven the current constraints in the PRC's financial market (i.e., a weak credit culture at \nstate-owned  banks,  limited  business  scope,  and  rigid  interest  rates),  CGCs  that  assess  credit \nsoundly,  such  as  COG,  are  needed  to  fill  the  gap  between  viable  and  growing  SMEs  and  their \naccess  to  financing.  Commercially  viable  SMEs  that  benefit  from  additional  guarantees  made \npossible  by  the  increased  capital  base  of  COG  will  be  supported  in  their  expected  growth  and \nsustainable  operations.  As  a  result,  employment  at  such  SMEs  can  be  sustained  or  increased, \nthus  promoting  job  creation,  economic  growth,  higher  tax  payments  to  the  government,  and \npoverty reduction \n \n22. \nSME  Financing.    SMEs  play  a  significant  role  in  all  of  ADB\u2019s  DMC  economies  and  are \nkey  drivers  of  employment,  economic  growth,  and  development.  They  often  have  a  significant \nimpact  on  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  in  most  cases  grow  faster  than  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs). The development of SMEs is therefore an important engine of growth and a \nkey contributor to poverty reduction by creating employment, increasing individual incomes, and \ngenerating tax revenues. \n \n23. \nSMEs  rely  heavily  on  access  to  external  capital  to  finance  their  operations.  However,  in \nmost of ADB\u2019s DMCs, SMEs have difficulty accessing financial services and securing financing. \nAlthough bank loans are dominating any external financing (due to the underdeveloped corporate \nbond markets), only a small number of SMEs in the region have access to bank lending (mostly \nonly for working capital). Lack of access to bank lending is considered in most DMCs as the main \nfinancing difficulty and a stumbling block for sustaining growth of SMEs. \n \n24. \nThe  limitation  of  banking  services  available  to  SMEs  is  mainly  due  to  the  following \nreasons:  (i)  State-owned  banks  (like  in  the  PRC)  are  not  geared  to  service  SMEs,  particularly \nprivate ones; (ii) Other banking institutions have limited coverage and financial products. The high \nfrequency and short-term nature of SME loans, unfamiliar markets, ownership structures that are \noften  complicated,  and  lack  of  sufficient  and  reliable  operational  and  financial  data  for  loan \nappraisal  have  resulted  in  high  business  development  and  administration  costs  for  banks. \nBecause of the long process of recognition, registration, and evaluation for the SME borrower\u2019s \ncollateral, banks have difficulties meeting the SMEs\u2019 frequent and seasonal demand for debt; (iii) \nTo reduce nonperforming loans, many commercial banks have adopted a policy of permanently \n\n 6 \n\n  \n\n\f  7\n\nassigning  the  responsibility  of  loan  performance  to  the  loan  officers.  This  has  resulted  in  acute \nrisk aversion at the subbranch and loan officer level, thus curtailing the amount of loans to SMEs; \n(iv)  In  most  of  the  DMCs  a  diversified  financial  sector  capable  of  serving  SMEs  is  lacking,  i.e. \nfocused  financial  institutions  that  are  specialized  to  provide  loans  for  SMEs  are  missing  or  only \nmarginal  market  participants;  (v)  Credit  allocation  is  in  many  markets  distorted  by  continued \npolicy  lending  through  government-owned  banks,  and  restrictions  on  competition  from  foreign \nfinancial  institutions;  (vii)  Finally,  in  many  instances  regulated  (domestic)  bank  lending  rates  do \nnot allow domestic banks to price risks for appropriately and therefore shy away form this asset \nwhich  is  often  perceived  is  highly  risky.  This  is  however  in  most  cases  contrary  to  reality,  if \nappropriate protection is sought and thorough due diligence is undertaken.  Appendices 14 and \n15  discuss  the  development  impact  of  SME  finance  and  the  SME  financing  gap  in  Asia, \nrespectively.  \n \n25. \nFinancial  Sector  Development.  The  credit-assessment  skills  found  in  COG  will  help  to \ndevelop  the  PRC's  credit  culture,  whether  COG  sustains  its  operations  as  an  SME  credit \nguarantor  or  its  credit  competency  is  eventually  acquired  and  absorbed  into  a  bank's  credit \ndepartment or extended into other, similar lines of business.  A strong credit culture is crucial to \nstrengthening the PRC\u2019s financial sector. \n \n26. \nPrivate Sector Development.  The support for the growth of a leading private provider of \nguarantee  services  will  contribute  to  the  shift  away  from  government  dominance  of  the  sector \ntoward  a  more  market-oriented,  private  sector-led  industry,  which  will  promote  sound  risk-\nmanagement practices and the efficient allocation of resources. \n \n\n2. \n\nValue Added by Asian Development Bank  \n\n27. \nADB\u2019s  proposed  investment  will  add  value  by  (i)  demonstrating  the  possibility  of \nreplicating  such  a  model  for  financial  intermediaries  serving  SMEs  in  the  PRC  and  other \ndeveloping  member  countries;  (ii)  catalyzing  additional  investments  from  outside  sources  (HYB \nand IPO investors) into COG as confidence rises as a result of ADB\u2019s investment and continuing \ncommitment;  and  (iii)  promoting  best  commercial  practices  and  good  corporate  governance,  \nADB\u2019s  direct  involvement  with  COG  and  the  firsthand  experience  thus  gathered  has  led  to \nenhanced policy support to the Government. \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Policies \n\nCOG has been classified as FI under ADB\u2019s environmental policy, and has (i) adopted an \n28. \nappropriate  environmental  management  system  comprising  a  policy  and  procedures;  and  (ii)  is \ncurrently undergoing training in environmental impact assessment and auditing.  \n \nThe  investment  is  classified  as  category  C  with  respect  to  indigenous  people  and \n29. \ninvoluntary resettlement safeguards. COG is not expected to cause any involuntary resettlement \nor affect indigenous people, as the guarantees are extended to SMEs mainly in urban areas.   \n \nC. \n\nDevelopment Impact Measurement \n\nADB  will  measure \n\nthe  expected  development \n\n30. \ninvestment.  These \nperformance  measures  follow  the  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  Evaluation  Cooperation \nGroup\u2019s Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations. Development impact \nis  measured  in  three  distinct  categories:  (i)  business  performance  of  the  investment  itself,  (ii) \neconomic sustainability, and (iii) private sector development. Appendix 3 shows the development \nimpact framework. \n\nimpact  of \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n \nD. \n\nRecords, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n31. \nCOG  will  continue  to  (i)  maintain  accounting,  management  information,  and  financial \ncontrol  systems  acceptable  to  ADB;  (ii)  maintain  independent  auditors  from  auditing  firms \nlicensed  to  operate  in  the  PRC  (the  foreign  shareholder  of  which  will  be  an  internationally \nreputable accounting firm) and acceptable to ADB, and will authorize auditors to submit financial \nstatements to ADB at least annually and to be available to discuss these financial statements with \nADB; (iii) maintain, in addition to PRC accounting standards, international accounting standards \nor any other accounting standards acceptable to ADB; and (iv) provide ADB representatives with \naccess to all sites where the activities of COG are conducted as well as to its books, accounts, \nand  records,  as  well  as  permit  ADB,  if  and  when  it  deems  necessary,  to  engage  auditors  at  its \nown expense to audit the accounts and accounting systems of COG. \n \nE. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy;  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n\n32. \nCOG was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and Policy relating to the Combating of \nMoney  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism.    Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  COG  to  institute,  maintain  and \ncomply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for \nthe purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism.  \nIt  should  be  noted  that  COG  already  has  in  place  a  framework  for  training  employees  in  the \nprevention of money laundering. \n \n\nVI. \n\nLEGAL ASSURANCES \n\n \n33. \nA framework agreement confirming ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto ADB\u2019s equity investments and lending operations in the private sector is in effect between the \nPRC Government and ADB. ADB will seek the Government\u2019s \u201cno objection\u201d concurrence with the \nproposed  additional  investment  in  COG  and  will  complete  its  investment  only  after  the \nGovernment\u2019s acknowledgement has been obtained. \n \n34. \nADB  will  enter  into  a  share  purchase  agreement  and  ancillary  documents,  following \napproval  of  the  proposed  investment  by  the  Board.    These  agreements  will  be  on  terms  and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n35. \nI am satisfied that the proposed investment would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve the investment of up to \n$3,000,000  equivalent  for  an  equity  stake  in  Credit  Orienwise  Group  Limited  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n16 January 2007 \n\n  \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n9\n\n \nA. \n\nThe Credit Guarantee Market in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\nINDUSTRY OVERVIEW \n\nAs  one  of  the  fastest  growing  major  economies  in  the  world,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \n1. \nChina  (PRC)  presents  significant  potential  for  the  credit  guarantee  industry.  According  to  the \nNational Bureau of Statistics, the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) reached CNY18.2 trillion \nin 2005 and CNY9.1 trillion in the first half year of 2006. Total outstanding bank loans reached \nCNY22.8  trillion  at  the  end  of  June  2006.  However,  in  most  cases,  fast-growing  SMEs  have \ndifficulty  borrowing  from  banks  because  of  their  relatively  weak  credit  history.  Individuals  also \nfind it difficult to secure loans for business or personal consumption.   \n \nTo address the needs of these potential borrowers, credit guarantee companies (CGCs) \n2. \nhave  emerged,  and  the  number  of  CGCs  has  been  significantly  increasing  in  recent  years.  In \naddition, as economic activities in the PRC continue to expand in scale and volume, demand for \nperformance guarantees as a hedge against counterparty risk is expected to grow. \n \nB. \n\nRapid Growth of the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Sector Creates Demand \nfor the Corporate Guarantee Business \n\nSince  the  PRC\u2019s  economic  reform  and  development  began  in  1978,  the  small  and \n3. \nmedium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  sector  has  grown  substantially.  According  to  statistics  of  the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC),  from  2001  to  2004,  the  number  of \nregistered SMEs increased from 16,968 to 27,326, representing a compound annual growth rate \n(CAGR) of 17%, the revenues of these SMEs grew from CNY6,325 billion to CNY12,769 billion, \nrepresenting  a  CAGR  of  26%,  and  the  net  income  increased  from  CNY264  billion  to  CNY643 \nbillion,  representing  a  CAGR  of  35%.  SMEs  play  a  significant  role in  the  PRC\u2019s  economy  and \nare key drivers of employment and economic growth. As of end 2005, SMEs were contributing \n75.0%  of  employment  opportunities,  74.7%  of  industrial  output,  62.3%  of  exports,  58.9%  of \nsales, 55.6% of GDP, and 46.2% of fiscal revenues in the PRC. \n \n4. \n\nTable A1.1 sets forth the general criteria of SMEs in the PRC. \n\n \nTable A1.1: General Criteria of SMEs in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(CNY Millions) \n \n\nIndustry \n\nTotal Assets \n\nSales \n\nIndustry \nConstruction \nWholesale and retail \nTransportation and delivery \nHospitality/food and beverage \n\nNumber of \nEmployees \n\n<2,000 \n<3,000 \n<500 \n<3,000 \n<800 \n\n<4,000 \n<4,000 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n<300 \n<300 \n<150 \n<300 \n<150 \n\n\u2014 = not available, SMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource:  Interim  Provisions  on  the  Standards  of  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises,  issued  by  the \nState Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the National Bureau of Statistics of \nChina on 19 February 2003. \n\n \nSMEs rely heavily on access to external capital to finance their operations. Despite their \n5. \nsignificance to the PRC\u2019s economy, more than 80% of SMEs have difficulty securing financing, \nand only 10% of all SME loan demand is met by banks. According to NDRC, the rejection rate \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nof  SMEs\u2019  loan  applications  by  banks  is  over  56%,  of  which  23.8%  are  for  lack  of  guarantees, \nand  another  32.3%  are  for  lack  of  fixed  assets  that  can  serve  as  collateral.  One  third  of  the \nfunds for SMEs came from unofficial lending networks with financing costs ranging as high as \n25% to 30%. \n \n6. \nSME\u2019s  limited  access  to  bank  financing  can  be  attributed  to  their  (i)  small  size  and \nprivate ownership, (ii) lack of track records or audited financials, (iii) variable credit profiles, (iv) \nfailure  to  provide  fixed  assets  as  collateral,  and  (v)  lack  of  guarantors.  Traditional  financial \ninstitutions  such  as  banks  are  reluctant  to  lend  to  SMEs  as  the  former  lack  in-house  risk-\nassessment capabilities and have insufficient industry knowledge, high risk aversion due to low \ntolerance for nonperforming loans, and internal requirements to obtain fixed assets as collateral. \n \nCommercial CGCs emerged to bridge the gap between state-owned commercial banks\u2019 \n7. \nlending  requirements  and  SME  borrowers\u2019  qualifications  by  providing  credit  guarantees. \nCompared with banks, CGCs have flexibility to accept various types of collateral in addition to \nfixed assets, such as unlisted securities, and to offer more flexible repayment options. \n \nC. \n\nDemand for Individual Guarantees \n\n8. \nThe  real  estate  market  and  the  fast-growing  consumer  sector\u2014including  household \nappliances and consumer electronics, automobiles, and home decorations\u2014have been driving \nthe individual guarantee business. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, at the end of \n2005,  the  outstanding  balance  of  residential  mortgages  in  the  PRC  was  $228  billion,  having \nshown  a  CAGR  from  2001  to  2005  of  35.3%.  Consumer  retail  sales  grew  from  $520  billion  in \n2001 to $832 billion in 2005, representing a CAGR of 11.8%. \n \n9. \nThe  structure  of  transactions  in  the  secondary  residential  property  market  in  the  PRC \ncreates business opportunities for CGCs. Demand arises because the PRC\u2019s mortgage lending \nrules  require  that  a  seller  must  discharge  an  existing  mortgage  before  the  seller\u2019s  bank  can \nrelease the home ownership certificate, without which a buyer\u2019s bank will not fund the buyer\u2019s \nmortgage loan. As a result, simultaneous closings at which a seller\u2019s repayment of his mortgage \nis funded by proceeds of a buyer\u2019s mortgage loan are not possible. By providing a guarantee to \nthe  buyer  or  the  seller\u2019s  bank  so  that  the  seller  will  have  sufficient  funds  to  discharge  the \nexisting mortgage, the CGCs facilitate these secondary residential property transactions. \n \nD. \n\nDemand for Performance Guarantees \n\n10. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  building,  infrastructure  construction,  and  domestic  trade  sectors  have  been \ndriving  the  growth  of  the  performance  guarantee  business.  The  total  value  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nconstruction market increased from $186 billion in 2001 to $335 billion in 2004, representing a \nCAGR of 21.8%. Fixed asset investments increased from $449 billion in 2001 to $1,098 billion in \n2005, representing a CAGR of 24.2%. Domestic trade commodities sales increased from $875 \nbillion in 2001 to $1,378 billion in 2005, representing a CAGR of 16.4%. \n \nDuring the past 2 years, the Ministry of Commerce has actively promoted the guarantee \n11. \nsystem for construction projects to promote the development of the PRC\u2019s construction industry. \nIn  October  2005,  the  six  cities  of  Changzhou,  Chengdu,  Hangzhou,  Qingdao,  Shenzhen,  and \nXiamen  were  chosen  by  the  ministry  as  pilot  cities  for  the  implementation  of  construction \nguarantees.  The  construction-related  guarantees,  including  contract  tendering  and  bidding \nguarantees,  payment  guarantees,  construction  performance  guarantees,  and  construction \n\n  \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11\n\nquality  guarantees,  meet  the  objectives  of  the  government  and  the  needs  of  the  construction \nindustry. \n \n12. \nUnlike transactions in international trade, for which PRC banks can issue letters of credit \nto ensure payment by the counterparty, no such service is available to parties engaged in the \ndomestic  trade.  The  emergence  of  trade-related  payment  guarantees  fills  such  needs  for \ndomestic companies, facilitating the growth of domestic trade. \n \nE. \n\nCGCs in the PRC \n\nAt the end of 2004, there were 2,188 CGCs registered with the NDRC. Figure A1 shows \n\n13. \nthe rapid growth in the number of registered CGCs in the PRC in the past 5 years. \n \n\nFigure A1: Registered CGCs in PRC\n\n2,188\n\n1,932\n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500 \n\n0 \n\n848\n\n582\n\n203 \n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\nCGC = credit guarantee company, PRC = the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: National Development and Reform Commission, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise  \nDepartment. \n\n \n14. \nAccording to NDRC, despite the large number of CGCs, the average registered capital \nper CGC was merely CNY30 million ($3.7 million).

As of 2004, there were 196 government-financed CGCs, \naccounting  for  9%  of  the  total.  Government-financed  CGCs  are  generally  independent  legal \nentities and not profit-oriented. These CGCs often focus their business on a certain industry to \npromote  certain  government  policy  directives.  As  a  result,  they  are  limited  in  their  ability  to \nsupport a wide range of SMEs in other industries. \n \n17. \nIndustry and Trade Organization-financed CGCs. As of 2004, there were 113 industry \nand  trade  organization-financed  CGCs,  accounting  for  5%  of  the  total.  These  CGCs  are \nestablished  by  local  and  regional  associations  of  SMEs  operating  in  a  particular  industry  to \nprovide  guarantees  for  members  and  so  help  them  obtain  financing.  They  are  small  and \nfinanced by member companies or local industrial or business associations. Since these CGCs \nare usually self-financed and take on their own risks, they pool the risk through re-guarantees. \n \n18. \nCommercial  CGCs.  As  of  2004,  there  were  1,879  commercial  CGCs  in  the  PRC, \naccounting  for  86%  of  the  total.  These  are  generally  established  as  corporate  entities  by \nenterprises  and  individuals.  They  are  generally  independent  legal  entities  operated  for  profit. \nThey  respond  promptly  to  market  needs,  customize  their  product  offerings  to  a  wide  range  of \n\n  \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n13\n\nindustries, and price the risk commercially. They also depend on sophisticated risk assessment \nskills, as risk control is an essential element to their business operations. \n \n19. \nAt  end  2004,  the  total  registered  capital  of  CGCs  was  CNY65.72  billion,  of  which  the \ngovernment\u2019s  contribution  was  CNY19.28  billion  (29.3%)  and  the  private  contribution  was \nCNY46.44 billion (71.7%). The funding background of the CGCs is set forth in Table A1.3. \n \n\nTable A1.3: Funding Background of the CGCs \nNumber \n    460 \n    477 \n1,251 \n2,188 \n\nCGCs \nWholly financed by government  \nPartly financed by government \nPrivately financed  \nTotal \n \nCGC = credit guarantee company. \nSource:  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Small  and  Medium-\nSized Enterprise Department. \n\n \nG. \n\nCompetition \n\n20. \nThe  CGCs  in  the  PRC  compete  with  each  other  in  many  ways.  One  of  the  most \nimportant  is  registered  capital.  The  relevant  PRC  regulations  limit  the  aggregate  exposure  of \nguarantees  provided  by  a  CGC  for  a  single  customer  to  a  certain  percentage  of  its  paid-in \ncapital.  Banks\u2019  internal  guidelines  provide  for  limitations  on  the  amount  of  exposure  to  any \nsingle  CGC,  which  is  usually  based  on  a  certain  percentage  of  the  CGC\u2019s  registered  capital. \nDraft  regulations  by  local  and  national  governmental  authorities  impose  various  capital \nthresholds for CGCs.
