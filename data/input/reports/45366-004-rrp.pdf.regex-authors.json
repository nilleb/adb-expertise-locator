THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Solid Waste Management Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project aims to provide an improved solid waste management (SWM) system in \nTashkent, the capital city, to upgrade urban infrastructure and services. The project will develop \na  sanitary  landfill  that  meets  international  standards,  rehabilitate  transfer  stations,  and \nmodernize the waste collection and transfer fleet. It will build capacity in waste management \nand help formulate a national strategy on solid waste management.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  robust  economy,  rising  population,  and  accelerating  urbanization  are \ncreating new development challenges. One is to replace aging infrastructure and dramatically \nimprove municipal services, including SWM. Increasingly, urban expansion is exerting pressure \non the living environment. Worsening pollution is causing environmental and health challenges \nfor the nation\u2019s towns and cities and affecting their growth prospects. \n \n4.  Uzbekistan generates over 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) daily or over 4 \nmillion tons annually. This generation rate is expected to accelerate to over 7 million tons \nannually by 2030, for a cumulative MSW amount over this period of about 100 million tons.3 \nExisting MSW collection services depend on aging and inefficient vehicles that collect MSW and \ntransfer it directly to un-engineered and unsanitary dumpsites, where it is dumped and left \nexposed.4 In some cases, MSW is not collected by municipal systems at all, but instead is either \nburned or illegally dumped on vacant lots and waterways. Although rudimentary SWM systems \nexist in the major urban areas of Tashkent, they are poorly equipped to meet current and future \ndemand. Elsewhere in Tashkent, MSW services are sporadic or nonexistent. Outside Tashkent, \nMSW recycling efficiency is extremely low, as formal environmental awareness and recycling \nprograms are largely absent. In rural areas, MSW collection efficiency is estimated at less than \n50%.  Nationwide,  illegal  dumping  causes  considerable  environmental damage to  land,  air, \nsurface waters, and groundwater resources, as well as on the health and well-being of nearby \npopulations.  \n \n5.  National  SWM  challenges  are  fully  recognized  by  the  government,  which  recently \nmobilized significant resources to improve SWM services throughout the country.5 SWM improvement is \nconsistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy (CPS), 2012\u2013\n2016 for Uzbekistan, which prioritizes replacing aging infrastructure and improving the quality, \ncoverage, and climate resilience of SWM and other municipal services.6 SWM investments proposed in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Preparing the Solid Waste Management Improvement Project. Manila. \n3  To put this in perspective, 100 million tons of MSW would cover Tashkent\u2019s 335 square kilometers to a depth of 60 \ncentimeters. \n4  The State Committee for Nature Protection counts 178 registered dumpsites throughout Uzbekistan and believes \nthere are several hundred additional unregistered dumpsites. \n5  Major investments nationwide in SWM equipment are provided through Presidential Decree 10.4. Recently, 138 \nwaste collection vehicles were acquired for Tashkent\u2019s SWM system. \n6  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Uzbekistan, 2012\u20132016. Manila. \n ", "2 \nthe country operations business plan (COBP), 2012\u20132014 for Uzbekistan align fully with the \nimmediate objective of developing basic urban infrastructure to support economic growth.7 \n \n6.  While recognizing SWM needs nationwide, the government has as its immediate priority \nrehabilitating Tashkent\u2019s SWM system. SWM demands in Tashkent are growing rapidly, as the \ncity\u2019s population of 2.3 million currently generates over 0.5 million tons annually, an amount \nexpected to increase to over 0.7 million tons annually by 2030, and with cumulative generation \nfrom 2013 to 2030 reaching more than 10 million tons. The current system has served the city \nsince 2006 and needs immediate and complete rehabilitation to avert potentially serious service \ndisruptions. Most of the city\u2019s 700 MSW collection points require restoration, its MSW collection \nand transfer vehicle fleets urgently require replacement, and its transfer stations require major \noverhauls. Tashkent\u2019s current practices to control dumping need to be replaced with modern \nsanitary  landfilling  that meets  internationally  recognized  standards.  Significant  opportunities \nexist to introduce and expand waste minimization and recycling initiatives citywide, dramatically \nimprove system operational efficiency, and strengthen the capacity of institutions involved in \nSWM service provision. \n \n7.  The Tashkent SWM system is operated and maintained by Maxsustrans, a chartered \nstate  unitary  enterprise  wholly  owned  by  the  Municipality  of  Tashkent  (Municipality)  and \nestablished pursuant to a 1988 decision and decree of the Municipality. With a staff of 1,969 \npersonnel, 685 of them female, the company operates the entire municipal SWM system for the \ncity\u2019s 11 districts and the adjacent city of Chirchik. This includes about 700 waste collection \npoints, 329 waste collection vehicles, three transfer stations, a waste transfer fleet, and the \nAkhangaran disposal facility located to the southeast of the city. While Maxsustrans has been \noperating  the  SWM  system  since  inception,  its  institutional  capacity  is  weak  (a  detailed \ndiscussion in para. 23). The project will strengthen Maxsustrans\u2019 capacity in technical and \nadministrative areas through a capacity development program. \n \n8.  The  project  fully  supports  the  government\u2019s  priority  of  improving  Tashkent\u2019s  SWM \nsystem  through  an  investment  package  to  accelerate  waste  minimization  and  recycling \ninitiatives, upgrade and rehabilitate the city\u2019s MSW collection and transfer systems, and develop \na new sanitary landfill facility (SLF) to serve the city at least until 2060. Concurrently, it will help \nthe government to develop a national SWM strategy and investment program to guide national \nSWM sector improvements over the medium term. The project supports the government\u2019s \nrecent proposals to progressively increase private sector involvement in SWM,8 reduce carbon \nemissions, and improve air quality. \n \n9.  This project is ADB\u2019s first investment in the SWM area of Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, \nlessons from previous ADB-assisted projects in Uzbekistan showed that turnover of project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  staff  was  high  due  to  poor  compensation  and  delays  in  salary \npayments, particularly by local governments. Therefore, the proposed ADB loan will finance \nsuch PIU expenditures and recurrent costs under the project.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be an improved urban environment and quality of life for the residents of \nTashkent. The outcome will be improved SWM services and management in Tashkent. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n8  The government plans to prioritize assistance to the informal recycling subsector in Tashkent and is currently \nassessing innovative options to outsource waste collection to the private sector. \n ", "3 \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output  1:  Rehabilitated  and  expanded  solid  waste  management  system  in \nTashkent. By project completion, it is expected that (i) transfer stations will be rehabilitated and \nan existing transfer station possibly closed,9 (ii) 3 million tons of disposal capacity  will be \nestablished in a landfill that meets international environmental standards, and (iii) 1,950 tons per \nday of disposal operational capacity will be established. \n \n12.  Output 2: Strengthened operational capacity. The project will develop the capacity of \nMaxsustrans and support sector improvements in three key areas: (i) waste minimization and \nrecycling program development; (ii) the formulation of a parallel media and public awareness \nprogram about waste minimization and recycling; and (iii) operational and management support \nfor SWM operations including a logistics study.  \n \n13.  Output 3: National solid waste management strategy. The project will assist the \ngovernment in developing, under the coordination of the State Committee for Nature Protection \n(SCNP), a national SWM strategy, including a sector investment program for 2014\u20132030.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $76.0 million equivalent (Table 1).

The government has requested a loan of $69.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,10 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n                                                \n9 The government will decide whether to close an existing transfer station after a logistics study is completed. \n10 The interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points. This is based on the loan terms and the government\u2019s \nchoice of repayment option and dates. \n ", "4 \n(with the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.  \n \n16.  The government will relend the loan of $69.0 million to Maxsustrans under a subsidiary \nloan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. Except as ADB may otherwise \nagree, the terms of relending under the subsidiary loan agreement will be substantially in \naccordance with the loan from ADB to Uzbekistan. A condition to ADB loan effectiveness is that \nthe subsidiary loan agreement is first executed and legally binding upon both parties.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Municipality is the executing agency (EA) for outputs 1 and 2, and SCNP for output \n3. Both EAs will be responsible for monitoring and evaluating project activities and outputs, \nincluding monitoring compliance with safeguard requirements and preparation of review reports. \nMaxsustrans  will  be  the  implementing  agency  (IA)  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation and will report to the Municipality and SCNP. The EAs will report quarterly to the \ngovernment\u2019s  Interministerial  council  for  cooperation  with  development  partners  on \nimplementing investment projects. All procurement under ADB financing will be undertaken by \nthe PIU in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  All  consultants  to  be  financed  by  ADB  loan  will  be  engaged  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual.11 \n                                                \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2014\u2013December 2018 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2018 (loan closing on 30 June 2019) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  An interministerial council for cooperation with international financial \ninstitutions and development partner organizations and countries on \nimplementing large and strategically important investment projects \n(ii)  Executing agencies   Tashkent Hokimiyat (Municipality) for outputs 1 and 2 and the State \nCommittee for Nature Protection for output 3 \n(iii) Key implementing  Maxsustrans \nagency  \n(iv) Implementation unit  PIU within Maxsustrans \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  5 contracts  $50,319,000 \nNational competitive bidding  13 contracts  $6,445,000 \nShopping  To be   \ndetermined \nConsulting services  (i)  Consultants for the executing  Individual  $865,000 \nagencies  consultants \n(ii)  Consultants for the PIU  Firm  $2,606,000 \n(iii) Design and supervision of landfill  Firm  $2,351,000 \n(iv) Design and supervision of community  Firm  $294,000 \ncollection points \n(v) Capacity development program:  Firm  $1,450,000 \nnational strategy, waste minimization \nand recycling, media and public \nawareness, transport logistics study, \noperation and maintenance support \n  (vi) Two contracts for audit consultants  Firm  $40,000 \nRetroactive financing  Advance contracting has been requested by the government for goods \nand/or advance contracting  and consulting services.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n18.  The project includes developing a SLF in accordance with international standards to \nimprove SWM in Tashkent. The SLF will have the potential to progressively expand to serve \nTashkent province over the long term. The proposed SLF is a stand-alone facility with a service \nlife  span  to  2060.  It  is  designed  to  be  self-sustainable  with  its  initial  development  phase \nproviding 5\u20137 years of service, which will provide ample time for the government to decide on \nSWM in Tashkent over the longer term while being assured of an operational system in the \ninterim. The 30-hectare site was selected after an extensive survey. \n  \n19.  The project includes the necessary upgrading and refurbishment of the entire MSW \ncollection and transport system in Tashkent. Collection points will be equipped with suitable \nwaste bins and the capacity to collect and segregate recyclable materials. Outdated collection \n ", "6 \nvehicles will be replaced with more efficient collection vehicles, significantly reducing operation \nand maintenance costs. A full logistical assessment of truck movement will ensure that an \neffective transport logistics system is in place. Transfer stations will be equipped with improved \ninfrastructure  and  electro-mechanical  components for  compaction  and control,  and  existing \ntransfer vehicles will be replaced.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The economic viability of the project was assessed from the national perspective on the \nbenefits of maintaining an improved SWM system for Tashkent. This includes constructing a \nnew SLF at Akhangaran, built and operated according to accepted international standards, and \nsupport for waste segregation and recycling over an economic life of 25 years. The project is \neconomically viable, as the economic internal rate of return of 17.4% in the base case exceeds \nthe assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. Sensitivity analysis shows the \neconomic internal rate of return more sensitive to increased capital costs than to increased \noperation and maintenance costs or reduced benefits from recycling.  \n \n21.  Financial analysis, conducted from the perspective of Maxsustrans, the organization \nresponsible for SWM in Tashkent, shows that the project is financially viable, with a financial \ninternal rate of return of 6.8%. This compares favorably with the estimated weighted average \ncost of capital of 1.2%. The financial analysis assumes that the capital expenditure is necessary \nto ensure that Maxsustrans can continue to operate as a going concern, with benefits valuated as \nthe  revenue  generated  using  current  tariffs.  Improved  efficiency  is  assumed  from  the \nrehabilitation  and  rationalization  of  the  SWM  system  supported  through  the  PIU  and \ncapacity development funded by the project. Sensitivity analysis shows that the profitability of \nMaxsustrans is relatively robust against increased capital investment costs and operation \nand maintenance costs but sensitive to reduced revenue. The company\u2019s ability to increase \ntariffs with the consent of the central government and the Municipality should enable it to \nmaintain sufficient profitability in the future to meet its operating expenditure and provide for \ncapital asset renewal.  \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  The government\u2019s public administration reform program is evolving through a number of \nphases: (i) reducing state influence in the economy; (ii) reducing command elements in the \nadministrative  system;  (iii)  restructuring  government  agencies;  (iv)  transitioning  to  market \nmechanisms with the gradual phasing out of the planned system of public service provision; and \n(v) making government activities more transparent. Nevertheless, governance remains an issue. \n \n23.  In the legislative, regulatory, and policy framework, new or evolving laws and decrees \ntend to overlap and become complicated. The lack of integration undermines enforcement and \nframework effectiveness, and thus its coordination.12 Institutional weaknesses weaken communication \nbetween key financial and line ministries, and skills training is needed to improve organizational \nability  to  provide  efficient  public  services.  The  government\u2019s  financial  management  reform \nprogram 2007\u20132018 has yet to be fully implemented and financial management remains largely \ncentralized. Responsibility for preparing and implementing capital investment and recurrent \nbudgets is divided. As the public procurement system is regulated by several laws, directives, \nand measures, it lacks clarity, transparency, and coordination. A major obstacle to transparent \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2011.

A  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  Tashkent  municipal \nadministration and Maxsustrans currently satisfy ADB\u2019s financial management requirements.13 \nThe city administration and Maxsustrans have satisfactory financial management capability to (i) record \nrequired financial transactions and balances; (ii) provide regular and reliable financial statements and \nmonitoring  reports;  (iii)  safeguard  financial  assets;  and  (iv)  submit  the  required  financial \ndocuments to auditors with arrangements acceptable to ADB. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Ministry of Finance, SCNP, the Municipality and Maxsustrans. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  By upgrading Tashkent\u2019s SWM system, the project will respond to the immediate SWM \nneeds of the 2.32 million residents of the city. This will address existing unsanitary conditions \nbrought about by SWM inadequacies in Tashkent and thereby improve health, hygiene, and \nsanitation conditions for all city residents, including the poor and socially excluded. Women, who \nare mainly responsible for household waste management, will benefit from cleaner collection \npoints and more regularized waste pickup services. Support for increased household recycling \nin the form of collection point bins, media campaigns, and the development of a waste reduction \nand recycling strategy will improve the incomes of collection point operators and extend the \nuseful life of the new SLF. The project will provide training through women\u2019s committees and \nneighborhood representatives in waste recycling practices and promotion. The involvement of \nnational and municipal women\u2019s committees in the development of recycling strategies and \nmedia  campaigns  will  enable  these  organizations  to  deliver  these  messages  to  their \ncommunities. Local labor regulations prohibit exploitive labor practices, including the use of child \nlabor. There are no labor issues in the SWM sector. The project loan documents include \ncovenants on adherence to core labor standards. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  Environmental safeguards. The project is category B for environment in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) 2009. An initial environmental examination (IEE) \nwas prepared in accordance with the SPS and government guidelines. The IEE includes the \nenvironmental audit compliance report for existing facilities, and an environmental management \nplan  (EMP)  including  corrective  actions for  existing facilities. The  IEE  shows  the  potential \nenvironmental impacts of the project include (i) dust emissions from construction of the SLF, \ntransfer stations and garages; (ii) the potential generation of odors; (iii) the potential attraction of \nvermin; (iv) noise from increased vehicular traffic, construction, and mechanical equipment such \nas pumps and compressors; and (v) associated occupational health and safety hazards. Such \nimpacts are manageable, and the EMP has properly addressed them. The corrective measures \nrequired for existing facilities recommended by the environmental audit compliance report have \nbeen incorporated into the EMP. Public consultation on the IEE findings was conducted on 11 \n                                                \n13 The financial management assessment followed ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management \nof  Projects  Financed  by  ADB  (2002).  The  instrument  used  for  assessment  was  ADB\u2019s  standard  financial \nmanagement assessment questionnaire. \n ", "8 \nApril 2013. The IEE was disclosed on the ADB website on 7 August 2013. Under Uzbekistan \nlegislation,14 the project is category 1, requiring that a statement of the ecological expertise be \nobtained from SCNP.15 Maxsustrans has agreed to ensure that the EMP and all corrective \nmeasures for existing facilities are strictly implemented, and during project implementation the \nPIU will have an environmental specialist responsible for overseeing EMP implementation. \nMaxsustrans will designate a unit within its organization to handle all environmental concerns of \nSWM, including the implementation of the EMP, implementation of any corrective measures for \nexisting facilities, and closure of existing facilities as necessary. \n \n28.  The project component on strengthening operational capacity will not have any physical \nfootprint, so no environmental impact is expected. This component will nevertheless include \ncapacity development for Maxsustrans, including environmental management for the project. \nThe preparation of a national SWM strategy will take into account the environmental aspect of \nSWM. \n \n29.  Social safeguards. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement in accordance \nwith the SPS, as the construction of the SLF requires acquisition of 49.9 hectares of land, \nincluding 19.9 hectares of agricultural land, and affects one farmer with nine agricultural workers. \nA land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) was prepared in accordance with the SPS and \nrelevant  government  legislation  and  requirements.  Consultations  with  affected  farmers  and \nworkers and Yangi Hayot Users Association (the local community organization owning the \nirrigation  canal)  were  conducted  during  LARP  preparation.16 During  the  consultation  with \naffected people on 11 December 2012, a summary of the draft LARP was discussed. The LARP \nwas disclosed on the ADB website on 7 August 2013.  Maxsustrans will work closely with local \nmunicipality and land cadaster agency to implement the LARP. As the closure of the existing \ndumpsite will affect 80\u2013100 unauthorized waste pickers, Maxsustrans will implement a livelihood \nimprovement program, the cost of which is included in LARP implementation costs.  \n \n30.  LARP  implementation  is  estimated to  cost  $870,000,  which  will  be  covered  by  the \ngovernment. The Municipality and Maxsustrans will be responsible for implementing the LARP. \nNotice  to  proceed  shall  not  be  given  to  any  contractors  until  the  LARP  has  been  fully \nimplemented.  \n \n31.   The project area has no group of people who maintain a separate cultural or social \nidentity from mainstream Uzbekistan society that would classify them as ethnic group, ethnic \nminority, or indigenous peoples as described in the SPS. Therefore, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSPS, the project is category C with regard to indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Major project risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 The project does not have any \nunusual technical risks. The project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \ncosts and risks. \n                                                \n14 National legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Ecological Expertise enacted in 2000. \n15 Prior to construction and prior to operation, the statement of ecological expertise will be obtained from SCNP. \nThese statements basically contain requirements and recommendations for construction, operation, and monitoring \necological aspects of the projects.      \n16 At least four consultations with affected people and relevant parties were carried out from November 2012 to \nDecember 2012. \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate PIU  The Municipality establishes the PIU and recruits a project management \nprocurement capacity   consultant, who will assist the PIU in managing project implementation.  \nThe PIU includes positions for international and national procurement \nspecialists.
