The \nsummary EIA was circulated to the Board on 24 May 2002 and \nmade available on the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on \n7 June 2002. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will help (i) reduce water pollution; (ii) protect water \nresources; (iii) promote sustainable economic development; and \n(iv) improve the environment, living conditions, and public health \nstandards in four cities of Hebei Province. The Project has five \ncomponents  to  provide  improved  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment in Baoding, Chengde, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou. The \nProject  will  also  involve  capacity  building  and  training  for  the \nHebei provincial government and municipal sewerage companies \n(MSCs). \n   \nRationale  The Hai River Basin is the fifth largest river basin in the PRC and \nintersects four provinces and two provincial cities. Hebei Province \nlies entirely within the basin, which has 120 million people, 65 \nmillion of whom live in Hebei. It contributes about one third of the \nwastewater flow and pollution load. As a result of rapid economic \ngrowth and urbanization, water pollution and water scarcity have \nbecome major problems. The Project will significantly help control \nwater pollution in Hebei and the Hai River Basin.  The Project is \nthe major urban infrastructure initiative under Hebei\u2019s 10th Five-\nYear  Plan  (2001-2005).  The  proposed  wastewater  treatment \nplants and associated sewage collection and disposal systems in \nHebei  cities  were  identified  as  high-priority  immediate-\nimprovement  projects  in  the  ADB-assisted  Hai  River  Basin \nPollution Prevention and Control Plan.  \n \nObjectives and Scope  The project objectives are to enhance the urban environment and \npublic  health  through  better  wastewater  management,  and  to \nimprove the quality of surface- and groundwater resources in and \ndownstream of the project cities. Related objectives include (i) \ncreating  MSCs  and  making  them  efficient  and  commercially \nmanaged;  (ii)  supporting  integrated  approaches  to  basin-wide \npollution prevention and control; and (iii) improving cost recovery \nfrom  users  through  an  improved  tariff  structure,  with  gradual \nincreases to achieve full cost recovery. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total  project cost is $165.34 million equivalent, including a \nforeign exchange cost of $82.36 (49.8%) and a local currency cost \nof $82.98 million (50.2%) equivalent.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 \npercent, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The loan proceeds will be re-lent by the central Government to the \nTerms  provincial government on the same terms and conditions as the \nADB  loan.  The  provincial  government  will  on-lend  the  loan \nproceeds  to  municipal  governments  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as the ADB loan. The municipal governments will on-\nlend the loan proceeds to the MSCs serving the project cities on \nthe same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The MSCs will \nassume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for \nthe  ADB  loan  and  reimburse  the  municipal  governments  and \nprovincial  government  for  any  intermediation  and  transaction \ncosts. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Hebei  Finance  Bureau,  under  the  overall  direction  and \nArrangements  guidance of the HPG leading group headed by the provincial \ndeputy governor, will coordinate project implementation through \nthe Hebei Project Management Office (HPMO), various design \ninstitutes,  and  MSCs,  which  will  be responsible for day-to-day \nproject management. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Hebei provincial government \n   ", "    iii  \nProcurement  ADB-financed  equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major \ncontracts for equipment and materials will be tendered through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  or  international  shopping, \ndepending on the contract amount. In accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement, foreign contractors may participate in \nthe bidding for local competitive bidding contracts. \n   \nConsulting Services  About 90 person-months of international and 160 person-months \nof domestic consulting will be required. Consultants should have \nexpertise  in  international  competitive  bidding  and  international \nshopping  procedures,  including  international  specifications,  bid \nevaluation,  contracts,  quality  control,  and  project  performance \nmanagement systems. The consultants will provide guidance and \ntraining for capacity building to ensure that (i) the MSC in each of \nthe four project cities is able to function effectively as a project \nimplementation  unit;  (ii)  appropriate  institutional,  managerial, \nfinancial, and operational arrangements are in place to enhance \noperational effectiveness, management efficiency, and financial \nsustainability; (iii) MSCs become effective operating companies \nafter project implementation; and (iv) social, resettlement, and \nenvironmental impacts are monitored. A consulting firm will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  Detailed  design  engineering  and  construction \nsupervision will be carried out by qualified local design institutes \nrecruited by the project cities; these services will not be financed \nby ADB. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit 2.4 million urban residents in 2010 in the \nBeneficiaries  four cities whose living conditions and public health standards will \nbe  improved  through  the  collection  and  treatment  of  about \n540,000 cubic meters per day of untreated sewage. The savings \nto industry, through avoidance of individual on-site wastewater \ntreatment required for discharge to surface water, will support \nsustainable economic growth, promote clean technologies and \nwater conservation, and ameliorate the poverty impacts of plant \nclosures  imposed  on  environmental  grounds.  The  Project  will \ncontribute  to  downstream  benefits  of  improved  water  quality \nthrough the collection and treatment of wastewater generated in \neach project city. Downstream beneficiaries will include coastal \nareas of Bohai Bay and the 20 million people in Beijing and Tianjin \nCity,  which  are  surrounded  by  Hebei  Province.  These  water \nquality improvements will contribute to the integrated river basin-\nwide  management  program  and  cross-jurisdictional  pollution \nprevention and control.   \n ", "iv   \n  The Project\u2019s environmental impact is positive, and the benefits \ngreatly  outweigh  the  negative  impacts.  The  Project  has  been \ndesigned  to  mitigate  all  construction-related  environmental \nimpacts. Adequate provision has been made to fully compensate \nthe estimated 4,983 people adversely affected by the Project, \nprimarily due to temporary and permanent loss of land. Physical \nrelocation of 230 households is expected. Extensive consultation \nwith  affected  people  has  been  undertaken  as  outlined  in  the \nresettlement  plans,  which  were  made  public  after  approval  of \ndomestic  feasibility  studies.  A  composite  resettlement  plan \ncovering four resettlement plans was posted on the ADB website \non 7 May 2002. \n \nThe Project will help reduce poverty by (i) reducing the incidence \nof waterborne diseases, costs of medical care, and sick days \ntaken,  thus  leaving  households  with  more  income;  and  (ii) \nimproving the quality of life of the urban poor by collecting sewage \nin  poor  neighborhoods  and  improving  water  quality  in  urban \ndrainage channels.  \n \nWastewater tariffs in each project city will be increased to ensure \nfull cost recovery by 2008, the first year of operation of the new \nwastewater facilities.   \n \n  ", "    v ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Hebei Province Wastewater Management \nProject. \n \n2.  The Project is in Hebei Province, northern PRC, which has an area of 188,000 square \nkilometers and a population of 65 million. The province lies in the heavily polluted Hai River \nBasin (HRB) which drains into Bohai Bay through nine tributaries. The Project is one of a \nnumber of planned wastewater management projects under the Hai River Basin Pollution \nPrevention and Control Plan (HRPPCP), funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 This \nbasin-wide program comprises more than 400 potential projects, of which the high-priority ones \nare targeted for completion in 2010. The four project cities are priority areas under the plan, and \nthe  project  components  have  been  prioritized  for  immediate  implementation  under  the \nHRPPCP. \n \n3.  During the 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \nfor assistance for the Project. In 2000, ADB provided technical assistance (TA) to help the \nHebei provincial government formulate the Project.2 Following completion of the TA study in \nAugust 2001, the Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in November 2001, and the follow-up \nFact-Finding Mission in March 2002 to discuss the Project with the central and provincial \ngovernments. The Government approved a feasibility study prepared by the Hebei provincial \ngovernment on 7 November 2002. Loan negotiations with authorized representatives of the \ncentral Government were conducted in Manila from 18 to 22 November 2002. The Project was \nformulated based on the findings of the ADB missions, information provided by the Government, \nbeneficiary consultations, discussions with other funding agencies, and recommendations of the \nfeasibility study and TA consultants. The project framework outlines the goal, purpose, outputs, \nand inputs or activities (Appendix 1).  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.  Since the 1980s, water has rapidly become scarcer for industrial use and domestic \nconsumption, especially in northern PRC, creating severe economic losses. Many rivers in this \nregion are dry for 5\u20138 months a year, which has serious  implications for water resource \nmanagement in the basin. In the HRB, the demand for water (50 billion cubic meters [m3] per \nyear) exceeded supply (33.9 billion m3) by 16.1 billion m3 in 2000.  \n \n5.  Increasing  reliance  on  groundwater  to  compensate  for  surface  water  scarcity  has \ncompromised future sustainable use of the resource. Water supplies are so dependent on \nground water resources that limiting extraction will dramatically increase water shortages. In the \nHRB, estimates of sustainable groundwater supply are in the order of 17.3 billion m3 while 1998 \nwithdrawals were 26.1 billion m3, indicating that overextraction is as high as 8.8 billion m3 every \nyear. As a result, deep and shallow groundwater tables have dropped 90 and 50 meters, \nrespectively, on the Hai plains. Other side effects of unsustainable exploitation include salinity \nintrusion and ground subsidence.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Hai River Basin Wastewater Management \nand Pollution Control. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Hebei Province Wastewater Management \nProject. Manila.  ", "2  \n6.  Surface and groundwater pollution now represent a huge problem not only for the \nenvironment but also for public health, especially since water is so scarce in northern PRC. \nOver 65% of river length in the HRB is classified as highly polluted and has no beneficial use. \nMajor  groups  of  polluters  include  industrial  and  municipal  wastewater  and  other  nonpoint \nsources. \n \n7.  During the 1990s, industrial wastewater flows and loads declined significantly while \nmunicipal flows and loads increased. In 1999, municipal wastewater flows (20.3 billion m3) and \nchemical oxygen demand loads (7.0 million tons) exceeded total industrial flows (19.7 billion m3) \nand loads (6.9 million tons) for the first time. These trends are likely to continue. Industries \ngradually decreased their wastewater flows and loads through wastewater pretreatment, internal \nreuse of process water, and use of cleaner technology. However, the performance of municipal \nwastewater management is generally poor: wastewater treatment rates are far lower than \nindustrial rates, treatment capacities are frequently underutilized, and treatment efficiency is \noften low.  \n \n8.  As in industrialized countries, pollution from urban municipal wastewater in the PRC is \nmanaged  through  updated  municipal  sewerage  systems,  including  collection  sewers  and \ntreatment plants designed to receive industrial wastewater, resulting in large savings because of \neconomy of scale of treatment to remove degradable organics.3 The treated municipal effluent is \nreused for irrigation and industries. The municipal systems also provide on-site excreta disposal \nunits for homes and buildings not connected to municipal sewers. A new challenge is to \nestablish or extend a permit system whereby municipal governments can control wastewater \ndischarges from industries, including monitoring and enforcement of their performance.  \n \n9.  To cope with increasing  demand for updated municipal sewerage systems, in 1991\u2013\n1999 construction of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) increased dramatically from 87 to \n398, and total capacity from 4.7 million to 15.8 million m3 per day. Despite the tremendous \nincrease in municipal wastewater treatment capacity over the last decade, most cities continue \nto be underserved by sewers and wastewater treatment plants. In 2000, only 7.5 billion m3 (34% \nof the total discharges) of municipal wastewater were estimated to have received secondary \ntreatment. This is a significant improvement on the 4% rate achieved in 1991, but backlog is still \nenormous. Municipal water demand projections show that municipal wastewater treatment \ncapacity will have to be nearly quadrupled over the next 20 years just to maintain its level of \nservice.  \n \n10.  During the 1990s, most water pollution was caused by industries. While great progress \nhas been made in reducing pollution, municipal wastewater management has lagged behind \nlargely because financial and institutional constraints hinder city governments from keeping up \nwith rapid urban growth. An important regulatory measure for industrial pollution control during \nthe Ninth Five-Year Plan (9th FYP) (1996-2000) was to request urban industries to treat their \nwastewater  to  national  wastewater  discharge  standards  by  31  December  2000.  The  key \noperational policy for urban wastewater management included the requirement that by 2010, \nwastewater treatment rate in all cities should not be lower than 60%, and not lower than 70% for \nmajor cities4 with secondary treatment facilities. \n \n \n                                                 \n3 The participating industries remove toxic and other objectionable substances by using in-plant treatment before \ndischarging wastewater into the municipal system (National Standards, GB8978). \n4 These include cities directly under the central Government, and provincial capital cities and key tourist cities.  ", "    3 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n11.  The acute water shortage in northern PRC will soon become unmanageable unless \nmuch more significant, comprehensive, and decisive measures are taken. Recognizing that the \nlack of water seriously limits economic and social development, the Government gives high \npriority to water resource management. While augmenting supply will partly solve the water \nshortage,5 preconditions for success are proper management of groundwater, water pollution \nprevention and control, and wastewater reuse.  \n \n12.  Water pollution will continue to be a critical problem over the next decade. Rivers, lakes, \nand groundwater are expected to deteriorate in many areas, particularly in the water-short north. \nThe challenge will be to maintain the momentum of industrial pollution control and broaden the \nattack to cover growing problems of municipal wastewater discharges and nonpoint sources. \nThe issues are complex and the institutions influencing the pace and nature of development \nnumerous. Any strategy to solve municipal water pollution must create a firm and sustainable \nfinancial basis to operate municipal wastewater services. A key element is adequate pricing of \nwastewater services.  \n \n13.  The Government\u2019s ongoing economic and enterprise reform programs require that all \nwastewater and water supply projects be financially sustainable and capable of cost recovery. \nHebei is a priority area for tariff reform.  ADB has supported the water tariff reform process \nthrough several TA projects.6 A study on wastewater tariff is helping the Government develop \nnational wastewater tariff guidelines.  \n \n14.  The  Government  has  significantly  increased  funding  to  build  basic  sewerage \ninfrastructure  to  meet  the  challenge  of  increased  urbanization.  Total  investment  in  water \npollution control has increased by 48% in nominal terms, from CNY182 billion during the 9th \nFYP to CNY270 billion during the 10th FYP (2001-2005). Capital investment to meet demand \nfor  wastewater  services  will  be  enormous,  and  private  sector  participation  will  likely  be \nnecessary to help bridge the financing gap. However, private sector participation will not be \nfeasible unless service charges are raised to financially viable levels. \n \n15.  Nonpoint water pollution due to fertilizer runoff, pesticide runoff, and discharges from \nintensive animal production is worsening. Nonpoint sources of nutrients are significant sources \nof eutrophication, which is occurring in many lakes throughout the PRC and also in shallow \nnear-shore marine areas that experience limited tidal flushing. Bohai Bay is susceptible to \neutrophication as indicated by the frequent occurrence of red tides. The 2002 country strategy \nand program includes assistance from ADB to address nonpoint water pollution control at a \npolicy level.7  \n \n16.  To clean up the most polluted river basins, the Government uses an integrated basin-\nwide wastewater management approach, which has many advantages, including effective and \nsustainable water resource development and management.  The Government designated the \n                                                 \n5  The Government has announced its intention to proceed with the south-north water program to transfer water from \nthe Yangtze River to the Hai and Huhai river basins to solve the water shortage.  \n6  ADB. 1997.

The wastewater sector \nanalysis focusing on the HRB is in Appendix 2. \n \n17.  The Project will significantly help control water pollution in the HRB and Hebei by \nimproving wastewater collection and treatment. The Project is the major urban infrastructure \ninitiative under the Hebei 10th FYP.9 Secondary treatment is to be achieved by 2005 in the 11 \nprefecture cities of Hebei, including the four project cities\u2014Baoding, Chengde, Tangshan, and \nZhangjiakou.10 The five proposed WWTPs and associated sewage collection and conveyance \nsystems were identified as high-priority immediate-improvement projects in the ADB-assisted \nHRPPCP.  \n \n18.  To help the Government develop and implement its strategies, external assistance has \nbeen provided mainly from ADB (Appendix 3), the World Bank, and Japan Bank for International \nCooperation  (JBIC).  ADB  has  provided  11  loans,  totaling  more  than  $1  billion,  for  urban \nenvironment improvement, urban wastewater, and water supply. ADB has provided five loans \nfor  wastewater  management  and  water  supply  in  Dalian  City  (Liaoning  Province),  Anhui \nProvince, Zhejiang Province, Fuzhou City (Fujian Province), and Tianjin City. ADB has also \nprovided  a  loan  to  help  reduce  pollution  and  restore  the  water  quality  of  Suzhou  Creek \n(Shanghai  City).  Five  of  ADB\u2019s  urban  environmental  projects  have  financed  wastewater \nmanagement components (e.g., Beijing, Chengde, Hefei, Qingdao, and Tangshan).  \n \n19.  Cost recovery has been promoted through policy dialogue on tariff increases and the \nintroduction of commercial management principles. These measures have helped demonstrate \nthat such projects can be financially viable under the lending terms of ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources. As a result, ADB\u2019s future PRC program includes more wastewater projects.  \n \n20.  Since 1988, ADB has financed 48 TA studies for $32.6 million to solve problems in water \nresources and pollution control, urban wastewater management, and water supply. ADB\u2019s \nassistance has resulted in rational pricing of water, major increases in water tariffs, introduction \nof  wastewater  tariffs,  implementation  of  commercial  principles,  improved  environmental \nmanagement, formulation of effluent standards and development of regulatory aspects, and \nintroduction of private sector participation. These improvements are fundamental to make the \nwater and wastewater sectors financially and operationally sustainable.  \n \n21.  ADB has led in promoting private sector participation in the PRC\u2019s water supply sector. \nFollowing the TA to help the Government prepare the first pilot build-operate-transfer water \nsupply project, ADB provided a $26.5-million loan and a $21.5-million complementary loan to \nfinance the Chengdu Water Supply Project. ADB also recently approved a $150-million loan to \nhelp finance a water infrastructure facility, which will fund relatively small water projects that \nADB has difficulty assisting directly. \n \n22.  The World Bank has participated in 20 urban environmental and water supply projects, \nincluding  a  parallel  wastewater  management  project  in  three  prefecture  cities  in  Hebei: \nShijiazhuang, Handan, and a portion of Tangshan.11 Japan, through JBIC, is the largest bilateral \nsource of aid to the PRC and is mainly involved in physical infrastructure, water resource \n                                                 \n8   The others are the Huai and the Liao river basins. \n9  This is an action plan for the Hebei Province part of the national 10th FYP. \n10 The other seven cities are Shijiazhuang, Qinhuangdao, Handan, Xingtai, Cangzhou, Langfang, and Hengshui. \n11 The ADB and World Bank projects cover different service areas in Tangshan, and are complementary and mutually \nreinforcing.

Bilateral aid agencies from Australia, \nCanada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States also \nfund wastewater and water resource projects, although on a smaller scale than multilateral aid \nagencies. \n \n23.  Experience  in  wastewater  and  water  resource  management  in  the  PRC,  although \nlimited, indicates that projects are well implemented and that water and wastewater tariffs are \nincreased as required. Analysis indicates that consumers are willing to pay substantially higher \nprices  for  reliable  supply  of  good-quality  water  and,  to  a  certain  extent,  for  wastewater \ntreatment. Issues related to tariff levels, cost recovery, and commercial orientation of the water \nutilities were carefully addressed during project processing. Lessons learned from the previous \nprojects were reflected in the project design, including thorough review of technical designs and \ntechnologies, rigorous financial and economic analysis, social assessment, and institutional-\nstrengthening measures to improve corporate governance. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s three strategic objectives for the PRC are to (i) improve economic efficiency, (ii) \npromote growth to reduce poverty in poor interior provinces, and (iii)  enhance environmental \nprotection and natural resource management. Wastewater treatment can contribute to all these. \nProper management of wastewater is essential to raise the living standards and productivity of \nurban populations, protect water resources, and sustain economic growth. In the wastewater \nsector, ADB focuses on (i) improving wastewater services through investment in physical \ninfrastructure, (ii) promoting improved corporate governance and commercial management to \nenhance the potential for future private sector involvement, (iii) improving cost recovery by \nstrengthening tariff systems and structures for wastewater to ensure sustainability and attract \nprivate  participation,  and  (iv)  ensuring  water  resource  conservation  and  environmental \nprotection through legislative and regulatory provisions.  \n \n25.  In support of the strategy, the agenda for policy dialogue in the wastewater sector has \ncovered key areas of basin-wide pollution prevention and control, industrial and municipal \nwastewater management, enterprise reform and corporate governance, cost recovery and tariff \nreform, and private sector participation. These are highlighted as special features of the Project \n(paras. 33\u201338) and detailed in Appendix 4. The Project will improve the quality of rivers, lakes, \nand  groundwater  in  and  downstream  from  the  project  cities  by  collecting  and  treating \nwastewater generated. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives  \n26.  The objectives of the Project are to improve the urban environment and public health \nthrough  improved  wastewater  management,  and  to  improve  the  quality  of  surface-  and \ngroundwater in and downstream from the project cities. Related objectives include (i) creating \nmunicipal sewerage companies (MSCs) and making them efficient and commercially managed; \n(ii) supporting comprehensive approaches to river basin-wide pollution prevention and control; \nand (iii) improving cost recovery from users through improved tariffs, with gradual increases to \nachieve full cost recovery.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n27.  The Project has five components, consisting of improved wastewater collection and \ntreatment systems in the four project cities. Project outputs include (i) WWTPs that would treat ", "6  \nabout 540,000 m3/day of raw or partly treated industrial and domestic wastewater by 2010; (ii) \nmore than 300 kilometers (km) of sewers and interceptors that would improve the urban \nenvironment for 2.4 million urban residents, by 2010, and provide sufficient capacity for an \nenlarged service area, by 2020; (iii) strengthen institutional capacity of the MSC to provide \nimproved wastewater services to customers by 2007; and (iv) adherence to the HRPPCP, which \nrequires execution of projects under the Immediate Implementation Program by 2005.  \n \n1.  Part A: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Baoding \n \n28.  Part A will serve the urban districts of Baoding, the largest project city with 718,000 \npeople in 2000, expected to increase to 870,000 in 2010. Facilities include 97 km of sewers, two \nsubmersible-pump lift stations, and a WWTP expansion of 160,000 m3/day. The city has two \nWWTPs, each with a capacity of 80,000 m3/day; the downstream plant, Yingdingzhuang, is to \nbe expanded under the Project. The existing collection system was developed piecemeal and \nhas many deficiencies related to inadequate ground cover, adverse slope, and inappropriate \nrouting of sewers. Major portions of the collection system are to be rebuilt under the Project. \nIndustrial wastewater is about half the total flow. Wastewater treatment will improve water \nquality in the downstream Baiyangdian lakes, which collectively form the largest lake in the \nnorthern China plain and have great potential for tourism and improved fisheries. \n \n  2.  Part B: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Chengde \n \n29.  Part B will serve the city proper of Chengde, whose population is expected to grow from \n250,000 in 2000 to 325,000 in 2010. Facilities include 32 km of sewers and a WWTP with a \ncapacity of 80,000 m3/day. Chengde relies on tourism related to the former imperial summer \npalace and adjacent temples, and has developed a workable separate sewer system to protect \nwater quality in ponds created behind inflatable dams on the Wulie River, which runs through \nthe city center. The downstream portion of the Wulie is heavily polluted by raw sewage from two \nmajor outfalls of the city, while pollution of the downstream Luan River affects the Panda \nreservoirs, which are raw water sources for Tianjin\u2019s potable water supply. The industrial \nwastewater component is only 20% of the total. The status of Chengde as an environmentally \nresponsible prefecture-level municipality and as a tourism center will be at risk until it acquires \nwastewater treatment facilities. \n \n3.  Part C: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Tangshan New District \n \n30.  Part C will serve a portion of Tangshan, about 15 km from the city center, consisting of \nthe New District and the urbanized portion of Fengrun County; the population is expected to \nincrease from 180,000 in 2000 to 225,000 in 2010. The New District is on the coastal plain near \nthe Hebei border with Tianjin. The facilities include 10 km of sewers and a WWTP with a \ncapacity of 80,000 m3/day. The new facilities are adjacent to the 32,000 m3/day New District \nplant, which is heavily overloaded and will be rehabilitated under the Project. The service area \ncontains a modern, economically competitive industrial park, and industries generate 70% of \ntotal wastewater. In the absence of an expanded municipal treatment plant, the industries are \nfaced with very high costs for advanced on-site wastewater treatment to meet surface water \ndischarge  standards.  The  Huanxiang  River  flows  through  the  city  and  provides  water  for \ndownstream municipalities, and agriculture. The river is heavily polluted by discharges of raw \nsewage and partly treated wastewater, aggravated by an upstream reservoir that prevents \ndilution from stream flow. Residents and farmers downstream in Tangshan and Tianjin have \nformally complained, and requested improved treatment. \n \n ", "    7 \n4.  Part D1: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Zhangjiakou  \n \n31.  Part D1 will serve Zhangjiakou City proper, whose population of 500,000 in 2000 is \nexpected to increase to 632,000 in 2010. The facilities include 40 km of sewers, 5 km of open \nchannel, and a WWTP with a capacity of 100,000 m3/day. The city has no municipal wastewater \ntreatment, and raw sewage discharges from 400 outlets, heavily polluting the Qingshui River \nthat runs through the middle of the city. Farmers divert raw sewage from the river for use in \nirrigation. Half of the wastewater is from industry and, in combination with wastewater from \nXuanhua, the large pollution loads have polluted and prevented beneficial use of Beijing\u2019s \nGuanting Reservoir as a standby drinking water source, which lies downstream on the Yang \nRiver.  \n \n5.  Part D2: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Xuanhua \n \n32.  Part  D2  will  serve  Xuanhua,  an  industrial  urban  district  of  Zhangjiakou,  30  km \ndownstream on flat terrain adjacent to the Yang River. The population of 235,000 in 2000 is \nexpected to grow to 300,000 in 2010. The facilities include 31 km of sewers and a WWTP with a \ncapacity of 120,000 m3/day. The area has no municipal wastewater treatment. About 80% of the \nwastewater is from industry, including a major steel mill, large brewery, fertilizer plant, and \npaper mill. Heavy-metal pollution over many years from poorly treated or pretreated industrial \ndischarges has prevented beneficial use of the downstream Guanting Reservoir, which is \nintended to become Beijing\u2019s standby water supply source. The municipal treatment plant is \nurgently  needed  as  a  cost-effective  alternative  to  advanced  on-site  industrial  wastewater \ntreatment  at  many  small  plants.  (For  example,  the  steel  mill  has  19  pretreatment  plants \nscattered over half the urban area.) \n \nC.  Special Features \n33.  The Project supports and strengthens several ADB policy initiatives: (i) integrated basin-\nwide  pollution  prevention  and  control,  (ii)  improved  wastewater  management  to  create  a \nsustainable  urban  environment,  (iii)  enterprise  reform  and  corporate  governance,  (iv)  cost \nrecovery and tariff reform, and (v) private sector participation. A policy framework addressing \nissues and actions required is given in Appendix 4.  \n \n34.  The  HRPPCP  provides  a  policy  and  strategic  framework  for  pollution  control  and \nprevention in the HRB. The Project will help the Hebei provincial government implement its \nwater quality improvement strategies under the HRPPCP. Interagency cooperation and cross-\njurisdictional programs are vital elements of a basin-wide approach to pollution prevention and \ncontrol. Beijing and Zhangjiakou have discussed protecting Guanting Reservoir and restoring its \nwater quality as a standby drinking water source for the capital. Tianjin and the HPG have also \nheld a number of meetings on pollution control for the Yuqiao Reservoir, which is the sole \ndrinking water source for Tianjin. \n \n35.  A successful wastewater management policy will help prevent and control pollution and \ncarry out cost-effective wastewater management and operations. Each project city has urban \nregulations, including on sewer connection approval and supervision. All project cities plan to \nintroduce or extend the use of wastewater discharge permits. These permit systems have the \npotential to enhance the regulatory framework to manage industrial wastewater discharge. The \nProject will help MSCs lead in controlling discharge into public sewers.  \n ", "8  \n36.  Transforming MSCs into financially and managerially autonomous enterprises requires a \nsustainable institutional framework for project implementation and future operation. The Project \nwill address four aspects of confidence-building enterprise reform and corporate governance: (i) \nstructuring MSCs along commercial lines with substantial managerial and financial autonomy, \n(ii) preparing business plans and introducing management information systems, (iii) improving \nthe effectiveness of MSC boards of directors, and (iv) strengthening audit arrangements.  \n \n37.  The  MSCs  were  established  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  economic  and \nenterprise reform programs, and will be strengthened under the relevant laws. Wastewater \ntariffs will be increased to ensure that full cost recovery is achieved by 2008, the first year of \noperation of the new wastewater facilities. The project cities increased wastewater tariffs during \n2000-2002 in anticipation of the Project.  \n \n38.  Private  sector  participation  in  the  wastewater  sector  will  provide  a  new  source  of \nfinancing and thus reduce reliance on government resources. The Project will help create the \nenvironment  necessary  for  private  sector  participation  by  pursuing  tariff  reform,  full  cost \nrecovery, and corporatization, which are the necessary prerequisites for such private sector \ninvolvement. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n39.  The project cost is estimated at $165.34 million equivalent, comprising $82.36 million in \nforeign exchange costs and $82.98 million equivalent in local currency costs. A summary of cost \nestimates is given in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are included in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total Cost \nItem  Exchange  Currency \nA.    Infrastructure       \n1.

", "    9 \nE.  Financing Plan \n40.  The Government has requested a loan of $82.36 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of \n1.0% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for borrowing \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n41.  The ADB loan will cover about 49.8% of total project costs. Loan proceeds will finance \nthe  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the  Project,  including  a  front-end  fee,  interest  and \ncommitment fee on the loan during construction. Local costs will be financed by (i) central and \nmunicipal governments, and MSCs; and (ii) loans from the Bank of China and the Industrial and \nCommercial Bank of China.12 The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2 and \ndetailed in Appendix 6.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost  Percentage \nA.

The Borrower will be the PRC. It will re-lend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the Hebei \nprovincial government on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The Hebei \nprovincial government will on-lend the loan proceeds to the municipal governments through on-\nlending  agreements  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  municipal \ngovernments will on-lend the loan proceeds to the MSCs on the same terms and conditions as \nthe ADB loan. The MSCs will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for \nADB\u2019s loan and reimburse the municipal governments and Hebei provincial government for any \nintermediation and transaction costs. The flow of funds and on-lending arrangements are \nillustrated in Appendix 7. \n                                                 \n12 The main terms of the loan from the Bank of China include an interest rate of 6.21% per annum with maturity of 8 \nyears, including a 3-year grace period on principal repayment, while terms of the loan from the Industrial and \nCommercial Bank of China include an interest rate of 5% per annum with maturity of 10 years, including a 2-year \ngrace period on principal repayment.  ", "10  \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n43.   The  Hebei  provincial  government  will  be  the  project  Executing  Agency.  The  Hebei \nprovincial government has established a leading group and a project management office. The \nleading group, headed by a vice governor of Hebei, will oversee project implementation. The Hebei \nProject Management Office (HPMO), directed by the leading group, was established in February \n2002 to coordinate the efforts of the local project implementing agencies. Each participating \nmunicipality has also established a leading group and a project management office to coordinate \nproject preparation and implementation activities among agencies.  \n \n44.  The HPMO is an experienced project office in the provincial Finance Bureau. The HPMO \ndirector is also a vice director of the Finance Bureau, giving the HPMO adequate status within \nthe Hebei provincial government structure to be effective. The HPMO is a multidisciplined unit \nstaffed with financial and technical specialists. Most permanent HPMO staff are experienced \nand qualified. The staffing of the HPMO varies according to need; the small core team can be \nsupplemented by specialist staff drawn from other provincial government departments, which \nnominate a senior official as a parttime HPMO deputy director. The organization chart of the \nHPMO is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n45.  The MSCs will be the project implementing agencies in the project cities. Each MSC has \nset up a project implementation unit, headed by a general manager, to coordinate with the \nHPMO, implement project activities on time, and be responsible for day-to-day implementation \nactivities.  An  organization  chart  of  the  project  implementation  units  in  the  MSCs  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. Experienced domestic and international consultants will support \nthem.  Some  HPMO  and  MSC  staff  will  train  in  project  management  and  relevant  ADB \nprocedures, directly under the consultants and through broader training-related activities funded \nby the loan proceeds. The HPMO will submit detailed training programs and budgets for ADB \napproval before proceeding with training activities and will report on training effectiveness. \n \n  2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n46.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  from  2003  to  2007  (Appendix  8).  The  project \nimplementation structure is already in place, and preparatory works are underway. ADB\u2019s \nsuccessful experience in similar projects in the PRC, and the Hebei provincial government\u2019s in-\ndepth knowledge and experience in wastewater pollution control and wastewater collection and \ntreatment projects indicate that this schedule is achievable. \n \n  3.  Procurement  \n \n47.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. The HPMO and MSCs have been briefed on the guidelines\u2019 anticorruption \nprovisions.  Major  equipment  contracts  will  be  undertaken  through  ADB\u2019s  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures,  and  equipment  packages  valued  under  $500,000  will  be \nprocured following ADB\u2019s procedures for international shopping. Civil works estimated to cost \nbelow  $5  million  per  package  will  be  carried  out  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB) \nprocedures acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Government Procurement \nLaw and Tendering and Bidding Law, and procurement regulations.  \n ", "    11 \n48.  Local contractors have the expertise and capacity to undertake LCB packages. Since \nthey will involve mainly labor costs, international contractors are not likely to be interested in the \nwork,  and  LCB  is  considered  acceptable.  ADB,  however,  allows  foreign  contractors  to \nparticipate in bidding for LCB contracts. Indicative procurement packages are provided in \nAppendix 9. The mode of procurement will be decided by the Hebei provincial government in \nconsultation  with  ADB.  The  internationally  tendered  equipment  packages  will  include  the \ntechnical support necessary to ensure proper installation, testing, commissioning, and training \nof operational staff as part of the related contracts. This approach assures quality control in \nequipment installation and operator training, utilizing the manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 technical \nexperts who are most knowledgeable about the equipment.  \n \n49.  Advance action was approved on 30 April 2002 to expedite project implementation.13 \nAdvance action, which may take place before loan effectiveness, includes (i) prequalification of \ncontractors, tendering, and bid evaluation for civil works contract packages; (ii) preparation of \ntender documents to procure materials, plant, and equipment; and (iii) recruitment of domestic \nand international consultants for construction supervision, project implementation, and training. \nThe HPMO has been advised that issuance of invitations to bid or to prequalify under advance \nprocurement action will be subject to ADB approval. All advance procurement actions will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement, and advance recruitment of \nconsultants will be carried out in conformity with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe Government, HPMO, and MSCs were advised that approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n \n50.  The MSCs retain the services of competent and experienced design institutes to prepare \nthe detailed engineering design and specifications, and to supervise construction. MSCs also \nretain  the  services  of  tendering  agencies  to  help  prepare  contract  documents  and  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures for prequalification of contractors; tendering and bid evaluation; \nand contract awards to procure equipment, materials, and civil works contract packages. These \nconsulting services will not be financed under the loan. \n \n51.  Provision has been made for 90 person-months of international and 160 person-months \nof domestic consulting services to support the HPMO and MSCs in project implementation and \ncapacity building to be funded under the loan. These consultants will help the HPMO and MSCs \nin ADB procedures and reporting, design review, procurement, quality control, construction \nsupervision,  start-up  testing,  commissioning,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and \nimplementation of the project performance management system (PPMS). The consultants will \nalso provide MSCs with advice, guidance, and capacity-building training. A consulting firm will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of \nreference for the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n  5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n52.  To facilitate disbursements for numerous small expenditures, an imprest account will be \nestablished by the HPMO after loan effectiveness in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001). Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported by an \nappropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will \ndemonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or services were (i) produced in and \n                                                 \n13 This action was reported in the July 2002 issue of ADB Business Opportunities. ", "12  \nprocured from ADB member countries, and (ii) eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to \nbe deposited into the imprest account will not exceed estimated expenditures for the next 6 \nmonths,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement-of-expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures;  any  individual  contract  to  be \nreimbursed or liquidated under the procedure will not exceed $200,000.  \n \n  6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n53.  The HPMO and MSCs will maintain separate accounts for the Project. The MSCs will \nmaintain records of all project expenditures to be forwarded regularly to the HPMO, and the \nHPMO will prepare consolidated project accounts following international accounting standards. \nThe consolidated project accounts will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable \nto ADB. Certified copies of such audited accounts in English will be submitted to ADB not later \nthan 6 months after the end of the financial year to which the accounts relate. As the ADB loan \nwill be on-lent to the MSCs, their audited financial statements will also be submitted to ADB \nannually, no later than 6 months after the end of the relevant financial year, for the entire \nimplementation period plus 3 years after project completion. The central Government, Hebei \nprovincial government, and MSCs are informed about ADB's policy on submission of audited \nfinancial statements and possible penalties for delays. The submitted audited project accounts \nand financial statements must be of acceptable quality.  \n \n54.  Independent review and scrutiny of project implementation will be undertaken for (i) \nenvironmental monitoring and adherence to environmental impact assessment (EIA) provisions, \n(ii) compliance with the resettlement plan, and (iii) audit of project accounts and compliance with \nloan covenants. The HPMO will submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of \nthe loan proceeds, project implementation, and MSC performance. The reports will include (i) \nquarterly progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; and (iii) a project \ncompletion report, not later than 3 months after completion of the project facilities. Progress \nreports will emphasize progress made in policy dialogue, including (i) wastewater tariff changes, \n(ii) environmental and water quality monitoring, (iii) resettlement, and (iv) capacity building and \nfinancial management of MSCs.  \n \n  7.  Project Performance Management System \n \n55.  The PPMS indicators agreed on during project preparation include service levels, treated \nwastewater quality and other measures of operational performance, percentage of wastewater \ncollected  and  treated,  water  quality  of  the  receiving  waters  and  monitoring  network,  user \nsatisfaction with the urban environment, and relevant economic data to monitor project impacts. \nThe  relevance  and  practicability  of  data  collection  for  the  proposed  measures  has  been \nconfirmed with each MSC. At the beginning of the Project, the HPMO and MSCs, with the \nassistance of consultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures to systematically \ngenerate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  five  project  components  and  the  agreed-on \nsocioeconomic and environmental indicators to be used to measure project impacts. The HPMO \nand MSCs will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable goals, firm up monitoring and \nreporting arrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after \nloan effectiveness. \n \n56.  Under the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime intervals by each MSC, which will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the data \nthrough the MSC management information system. The PPMS will permit flexibility to adopt \nremedial action regarding project design, schedules, activities, and development impacts. The ", "    13 \nHPMO, with the assistance of the consultants, will monitor and assess activities, and report to \nADB quarterly on the Project\u2019s physical implementation and financial aspects to ensure that \nimpacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements.  \n \n  8.  Project Reviews  \n \n57.  Regular ADB review missions are envisaged, and a midterm review will be undertaken \nby ADB and the Government, 2 years after project implementation begins. The midterm review \nwill include a detailed evaluation of the scope, implementation arrangements, resettlement, \nachievement of scheduled targets, and progress in policy reform and capacity building. MSCs\u2019 \nwastewater tariffs will also be reviewed in detail. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be \nanalyzed. \n \nG.  Project Implementing Agencies  \n1.  Legal Status and Corporate Structure  \n \n58.  Three MSC have been established under the Project and one for Chengde will be \nestablished before loan signing. Tangshan has had a suitably constituted MSC since 1997. It is \nregistered as a state-owned enterprise and operates under a board of directors in accordance \nwith the Company Law. The MSC has a business license and company charter, which defines \nthe scope of business and overall management arrangements. Zhangjiakou has recently set up \nan MSC modeled after the Tangshan MSC. The Zhangjiakou MSC is responsible for the \nZhangjiakou and Xuanhua components, with separate subsidiaries responsible for subsequent \noperations and maintenance. Zhangjiakou has no previous WWTP. Baoding has also recently \nset  up  an  MSC,  which  is  registered  as  an  institutional  entity  with  financial  autonomy  in \naccordance with the Provisional Regulation on Registration of Institutional Entities. In Baoding, \nwhich has two older WWTPs, responsibilities for wastewater management and the construction \nof  related  infrastructure  were  fragmented  across  a  number  of  agencies.  They  have  been \nrationalized, and a single MSC has been created. Chengde has no previous WWTP and will \nestablish an MSC modeled after the Tangshan MSC. The typical MSC corporate structure is \ngiven  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  Institutional  strengthening  is  essential  for  the  new \ncompanies and institutional entity to promote the Project\u2019s long-term sustainability, as well as to \nimprove  efficiency  and  service  delivery.  Appendix  10  describes  the  required  institutional \nstrengthening.    \n \n  2.  Financial Projections \n \n59.  Since most MSCs are new, they do not have an established financial and operational \ntrack record. A 15-year financial projection, based on the volume of wastewater to be treated \nand proposed tariffs for each year, shows that the MSCs\u2019 financial position will remain sound \n(Appendix 11). Wastewater tariffs will be the main source of operating revenue. The provincial \ngovernment has committed to raise tariffs to ensure the MSCs\u2019 financial sustainability. The \nMSCs\u2019 average wastewater tariff rates will need to increase by a factor of 4\u20135 in 2003\u20132008. \nThese  rates  will  ensure  full  cost  recovery,  including  operation  and  maintenance,  interest \ncharges, and the greater of depreciation or debt repayment, together with a reasonable profit \nmargin.  \n \n60.  To  ensure  MSCs\u2019  sound  financial  position,  the  provincial  government,  municipal \ngovernments, and MSCs have agreed to minimum levels of financial performance, which will be \nincluded as loan covenants and include capital structure (debt to equity), debt service coverage, ", "14  \nand liquidity. Periodic tariff reviews will be required to overcome the risk of poor financial \nperformance or unexpected changes in the MSCs\u2019 tariff income.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Impacts  \n61.  The Project will significantly help control water pollution in Hebei Province and the HRB. \nMunicipal wastewater treatment is a key element in controlling point-source water pollution, \nwhich is the first step to meeting stream water quality standards for beneficial water uses. The \nservice areas of the project cities contain the major industrial wastewater dischargers. The \nProject will be flexible in imposing pretreatment requirements. The industries in the project cities \nonly pretreat discharge to municipal sewers rather than apply the more severe requirements for \ndischarge  to  rivers  and  lakes.  The  savings  to  industry,  through  avoidance  of  advanced \nwastewater treatment requirements, will support sustainable economic growth, promote clean \ntechnologies, and water conservation. To ensure control of industrial wastewater, each project \ncity will prepare and submit industrial pollution control plans14 to ADB through the HPMO.  \n \n62.  Wastewater interception, treatment, and disposal provide the best long-term prospect for \ncontrolling water pollution and improving water quality in the rivers and lakes in and downstream \nof the project cities. The WWTPs, which will use the same treatment processes successfully \nused  in  other  treatment  plants,  will  be  cost-effective  and  reliable.15  These  WWTPs  have \nsufficient land to accommodate plant expansion until 2020. Sewer capacities to be installed will \naccommodate growth in wastewater flows until 2020, preventing the risk of sewage overflow in \nthe urban service areas. The previous domestic investments in existing overloaded WWTPs and \npartial collection of wastewater will become a fruitful rather than wasted expenditure. The \nProject will also improve land values along urban drainage ditches.  \n   \nB.  Institutional Benefits  \n63.  Each participating city will be provided with consultant advisory services to develop an \nMSC that will (i) be properly constituted, and managerially and financially autonomous; (ii) be \nresponsible  for  project  implementation,  working  and  liaising  closely  with  the  various \ndepartments and agencies of local government; (iii) assume management responsibility for \nfuture operations and maintenance of project facilities, including responsibility for debt servicing; \nand (iv) assume ownership of all municipal wastewater assets, including all permanent works \nconstructed under the Project.  \n \n64.  The Project will also help each MSC establish a sound and solid financial management \nsystem at the beginning of project implementation. The financial management system will be in \nline with ADB's Guidelines for Governance and Financial Management of an ADB Investment \nProject. Each MSC will keep accounts in accordance with commercial accounting principles and \nbe subject to independent external audit by a qualified firm of commercial auditors. Accounting \nwill be in accordance with relevant PRC accounting standards, which are largely in accordance \nwith international norms (para. 53).  \n \n                                                 \n14  These plans will also provide industries with technical advice, covering adequate treatment, education, and \nproposed improvements.  \n15 Treatment efficiency of the plants exceeds 90%. Influent quality ranges from 150 to 270 milligrams per liter (mg/l) \nfor biochemical oxygen demand, and from 200 to 300 mg/l for suspended solids, while effluent standards to be met \nare less than 30 mg/l for biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids.  ", "    15 \nC.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Social Benefits \n \n65.  The Project will benefit 2.4 million people in the project cities by 2010 through improved \nenvironmental conditions and water quality of rivers and lakes. The service area encompasses \nthe entire urbanized area of each project city. All the downstream benefits of improved water \nquality through point-source pollution control will thus be achieved upon project completion. \nDownstream beneficiaries will also include coastal areas of Bohai Bay, and the 20 million \npeople in Beijing and Tianjin City, which are surrounded by Hebei Province. The Project will \nenhance the image of Hebei as a progressive, environmentally aware region attractive to \ninternational investors.  \n \n  2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n66.  Resettlement  impacts  have  been  identified  and  four  resettlement  plans  have  been \nprepared, addressing issues related to entitlements of affected persons. These resettlement \nplans were reviewed and refined by the TA consultants and ADB staff in accordance with the \nADB  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  Resettlement  under  the  Project  includes  physical \nrelocation of 230 households or 736 persons; 25 shops or enterprises affecting 1,195 persons; \npermanent land acquisition of nearly 60 hectares (ha), affecting 664 persons; and temporary \nland acquisition of 171 hectares, affecting 3,124 persons. A total of 4,983 people will be \naffected. The main cost item for resettlement is land acquisition and resettlement, which is \nestimated at $22.3 million equivalent.  \n \n67.  The resettlement requirements of the Project are relatively small, and considering the \ngood experiences in other urban projects and the strong commitment of the local authorities to \nthe safeguard policies, significant problems are unlikely to be encountered. The MSCs will fund \nthe resettlement costs according to the standards set out in the resettlement plans. Entitlements \nwill be provided to the affected persons before demolition and ground leveling, and before any \nloss of land. Following the domestic procedures, resettlement information has been released to \nthe affected persons through village offices, and the full resettlement plans have been made \navailable at the village offices for affected persons. The summary resettlement plan (Appendix \n12) was included in the summary EIA and circulated to ADB\u2019s Board on 15 May 2002. The \ncomposite resettlement plan covering four resettlement plans was made available on the ADB \nwebsite on 7 May 2002.16 \n \n68.  The resettlement plan will be reviewed, revised, and appropriately modified after the \ndetailed engineering designs for each component have been finalized. Any revised resettlement \nplans will be submitted to ADB for review before implementation. The HPMO, assisted by the \nMSCs, will be responsible for monitoring resettlement and submitting reports to ADB. A regular \nreporting system was established to ensure that key resettlement activities are implemented on \nschedule. The HPMO will engage a domestic institute to independently monitor and evaluate \nresettlement. One or two evaluation surveys will be conducted upon completion of resettlement, \nand the findings reported to the HPMO and ADB.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/PRC/Hebei_wastewater ", "16  \n  3.  Poverty Reduction \n \n69.  A crude estimate of the extent of poverty in the project areas can be made based on the \nminimum living standard scheme established in the ADB-assisted urban poverty study:17 eight \npercent of beneficiaries are poor, and at least 200,000 beneficiaries live below the poverty line \nin the project cities. The Project will indirectly reduce poverty. The summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 13.  \n  \n70.  The Project will prevent closure of industries that cannot afford to meet severe treatment \nrequirements for discharge. The Project will also create skilled and unskilled construction jobs \nduring implementation. The Project will hire about 5,000 workers, mainly to build sewers and the \ncivil works. Men and women will have equal job opportunities; women working on construction \nare not uncommon in the PRC. \n \n71.  The Project will improve the health and well-being of beneficiaries as water pollution \npromotes waterborne diseases, to which the poor are susceptible because of their poor diet and \ninability to pay for adequate preventative and curative measures. Project benefits will extend to \nthe residents downstream of the WWTPs and outside the project cities as contamination of \ndrinking water resources is reduced and water for irrigation improved.  \n \nD.  Financial Analysis  \n72.  The financial internal rate of return is estimated at 5\u20137% for the project components, or \nbetter than the 4% weighted average cost of capital in real terms. Tariff increases are required \nto ensure the financial sustainability of the MSCs. The financial evaluation is in Appendix 14.  \n \n73.  The sensitivity analyses tested the base case against a cost increase of 10%, revenue \nreduction of 10%, currency devaluation of 30%, and a delay in receiving revenue of 1 year. The \ntests revealed that the components are more sensitive to changes in revenue than cost. The \nsensitivity analysis also examined the risk that certain major industries might not pay for their \nportion of WWTP capacity and associated capacity of trunk sewers, due either to unprofitable \noperations or factory closures. The iron and steel mill in Xuanhua is the most serious risk. If the \nmill defaults on or fails to pay wastewater tariffs, the Zhangjiakou municipal government will \nhave to take over the mill\u2019s portion of annual loan repayment. The municipality has the financial \nresources to do so and has provided assurances that it will if needed. Financial records of large \nindustries in the project cities and interviews with representatives of industries establish that \nthey can expect to be profitable and that the risk of closure is small.  \n \n74.  An affordability analysis has been undertaken, based on proposed tariffs and household \nincome data from a social survey. Tariffs under the Project are assumed affordable if the \ncombined average water and wastewater charges are less than 5% of household income. In all \nthe project cities, the estimated tariffs are affordable by the average household and the poorest \n10% of households. The affordability analysis is in  Appendix 14. The proposed tariffs are \ncomfortably within the affordability limit in all the project cities. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance for the People\u2019s Republic of China for Urban Poverty Study. Manila. This TA was \ncompleted in December 2001. In the study repot, the minimum living standard for Hebei Province is established at \nCNY2,509 or $478 per capita per year.  ", "    17 \nE.  Economic Analysis \n75.  The economic analysis of the Project is not based on standard benefit-cost analysis, \nsince it would not reveal the real economic justification for the Project. The project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) feasibility study for the Project did attempt a benefit-cost analysis, \nbut with economic internal rates of return of 12\u201324%. The main motivation for the Project comes \nfrom a thorough sector analysis of the HRPPCP, which identified and prioritized future sector \ndevelopments. Since the Project aims to help meet the sector development goals, an analysis of \nthe project components as independent subprojects will not establish  the real and intended \neconomic basis for the Project. The economic analysis of the Project therefore focused on the \nsector development plan, the role of the Project in it, and on the goals\u2014targets for surface-\nwater quality\u2014to determine whether they are reasonable and will command public support. In \nthis case, a least-cost analysis is appropriate: that is, the Project will help the provincial \ngovernment attain sound and clearly established social goals at least cost. Taking the goals as \ngiven, the economic analysis showed that the Project is designed to meet them at least \neconomic cost.  \n  \n76.  Ample  evidence  exists  that  the  public  supports  water  quality  targets,  but  scientific \nuncertainties limit the assurance that targets will be met. Still, the economic analysis shows that \nthe project will minimize the cost of wastewater management, not only at the treatment plants \nbut  also  across  the  cities  they  serve.  The  Project  will  achieve  least-cost  wastewater \nmanagement beyond the plant site by including all significant point sources in each plant\u2019s \nservice  territory,  and  by  charging  a  wastewater  treatment  tariff  that  will  provide  financial \nincentives to equalize the marginal costs of wastewater management. Appendix 15 discusses \nthe economic analysis.18 \n \nF.  Environmental Benefits \n77.  In accordance with the Environmental Protection Law and Guidelines for Environmental \nProtection Management of Construction Projects, EIA outlines and reports have been prepared \nfor each project component. The summary EIA for the whole Project and the EIAs for Baoding, \nChengde,  and  Zhangjiakou  have  been  reviewed  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration, while the EIA for Tangshan has been reviewed and approved by the Hebei \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau. The summary EIA for the Project was circulated to ADB\u2019s \nBoard on 24 May 2002, and posted on the ADB website on 7 June 2002.19  \n \n78.  The Project will substantially improve the urban environment and surface-water quality in \nrivers, impoundments, and Bohai Bay. With the planned mitigation measures in place, the \nProject will have insignificant adverse environmental impacts, improve the living environment, \nand contribute appreciably to the Hai River Basin\u2019s water pollution control program. The Project \nwill safeguard  the quality of water supply sources of Beijing and Tianjin, help raise living \nstandards, and improve public health conditions. The Project is important to the provincial water \npollution  control  plan.  Appendix  16  summarizes  the  environmental  impacts,  mitigation \nmeasures, and monitoring plans. \n  \n \n \n                                                 \n18 A detailed economic analysis of the Project is presented in the ADB 2002 EDR Technical Note #4: Economic \nIssues in the Design and Analysis of a Wastewater Treatment Project, which analyzes the Project as a case study. \n19 http://www.adb.org/Documents/Environment/PRC/hebei_wastewater ", "18  \nG.  Project Risks \n79.  Potential institutional, financial, and policy risks related to the Project include the failure \nof (i) project cities to implement institutional reforms; (ii) project cities and MSCs to generate \npublic support for higher wastewater tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; (iii) project cities to \nmeet the cash and/or equity transfer required to construct the Project; and (iv) municipal \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  to  prepare  and  enforce  industrial pollution control plans, \naffecting the ability of MSCs to meet treatment standards. Other risks include unforeseen \nconstruction difficulties and inadequate project management.  \n \n80.  These risks have been mitigated by (i) project cities\u2019 assurances on the MSCs\u2019 financial \nand  managerial  autonomy  and  institutional  strengthening,  (ii)  regular  tariff  reviews  and \nadjustments  by  the  government  following  national  guidelines,  (iii)  provision  of  counterpart \nfunding, and (iv) experience of the HPMO in preparing city-wide pollution control plans. ADB \nreview missions will monitor compliance with the financial and operational covenants to ensure \nMSC financial sustainability. The Project does not have any unusual technical risks based on \nthorough  investigations,  which  minimize  the  risk  of  unforeseen  construction  conditions. \nExperienced domestic and international consultants will give implementation advice and support \nto mitigate specific construction and other implementation risks. The project leading group in the \nHPG, headed by a provincial vice governor, and the HPMO, which has experience in oversight \nof a large internationally funded project, will mitigate project management risk. \n \nH.  Overall Assessment \n81.  The integrated benefits and impacts of the Project will outweigh the costs, and it is \nrobust enough to be beneficial despite potential risks. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n82.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, HPG, and MSCs have given \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  The Government, through the HPG and municipal governments, will ensure that \n(a) all local and foreign currency counterpart financing for the Project, including \nequity contributions and cash advances, is provided on time; and (b) additional \ncounterpart funding is provided for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns. \n \n(ii)  The HPG will cause each municipal government to (a) review and revise local \nregulations on management of the local wastewater systems by 2003, and (b) \nforward  the  review  and  revision  summaries  to  ADB  within  3  months  of \ncompletion. \n \n(iii)  The HPG will cause each municipal government to (a) prepare an industrial \npollution  control  plan  covering  relevant  monitoring  and  enforcement \narrangements, and (b) submit a summary of the plan to ADB by June 2004. \n \n(iv)  The HPG will cause each municipal government to ensure that (a) the MSC will \nhave financial and managerial autonomy and be entitled to receive all monies \ncollected from levying of the approved wastewater tariff, (b) the MSC board of ", "    19 \ndirectors  or  its  governing  body  operates  effectively  and  fully  discharges  its \nsupervisory and management responsibilities, and (c) each MSC will appoint \nexternal  auditors  qualified  to  undertake  company  audits  in  the  PRC  and \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \n(v)  Each MSC will, from commencing commercial operation of the project facilities, \nmaintain a minimum debt service ratio of 1.2:1; maximum debt-equity ratio of \n70:30; and minimum current ratio of 2:1 or quick ratio of 1:1. \n \n(vi)  The HPG will ensure that (a) each municipal government participating in the \nProject  reviews  wastewater  tariffs  annually;  (b)  tariffs  are  determined  in \naccordance  with  project  financing  needs  and  the  need  to  maintain  MSCs\u2019 \nfinancial autonomy, subject to compliance with laws and regulations; and (c) \nsummaries  of  these  reviews  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB  within  3  months  of \ncompletion. \n \n(vii)  The HPG and each MSC will ensure that (a) the resettlement plan, including land \nacquisition, is carried out promptly and efficiently, in line with the Government\u2019s \nLand Administration Law and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement; (b) all \naffected people are consulted on the entitlements at least 4 months before \nground  clearing;  (c)  sufficient  budget  is  available  and  affected  persons  are \ncompensated on time; (d) those affected are at least as well-off as they were \nbefore resettlement; (e) resettlement is monitored and evaluated by a domestic \ninstitute, and results reported to ADB; and (f) a baseline survey is carried out as \nrequired in the resettlement plan. \n \n(viii)  The HPG and each MSC will keep ADB informed of the progress of resettlement \nactivities through regular reporting as specified in the resettlement plan. \n \n(ix)  The  HPG  will  cause  each  municipal  government  to  review  the  impact  of \nincreased water and wastewater tariffs on the poor and introduce appropriate \nmeasures to protect the basic living standards of the urban poor. \n \n(x)  The HPG and each MSC will ensure that (a) the Project is constructed and \noperated in accordance with environmental procedures and guidelines of the \nGovernment and ADB; (b) any adverse environmental impacts arising from the \nProject  are  minimized  by  implementing  the  mitigation  measures  and \nenvironmental  monitoring  program  presented  in  the  EIA;  and  (c)  the \nimplementation of the environmental monitoring  program, including mitigation \nmeasures, and copies of permits, licenses, and clearances, is regularly reported \nto ADB as specified in the EIA, including violations of safety and environmental \nstandards and their correction. \n \nB.  Condition for Disbursement \n83.  Execution and delivery of each on-lending agreement between the concerned project \nmunicipal government and MSC, and issuance of a legal opinion on such on-lending agreement \nby counsel acceptable to ADB will be a condition for disbursement of the loan proceeds to the \ncorresponding project component. \n \n ", "20  \nVI.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports integrated water resource management: \ncoordinate basin-level activities to manage surface-water quality, evaluate implementation of the \nplans, and assess progress in managing water quality. \n \n2.  In addition to the Hai River Basin (HRB), the sectoral analysis also focuses on Hebei \nProvince. The HRB is the sectoral analysis' focus, but Hebei Province plays a major role in the \npolitical and administrative control in the basin, and has the largest impact on the basin. Of the \nfour provinces that intersect the HRB, Hebei is the only one that lies entirely within the basin, \nand all the HRB's main river systems flow through Hebei. It covers approximately 60% of the \nbasin and contains about 55% of the basin's population.   \n \nB.  Performance Indicators \n \n3.  HRB water quality is managed through legally established targets for water quality, \nwhich has five classes plus a residual class for water bodies with quality below the lowest class. \nTable A2.1 shows that water quality has been improving since 1995 in Hebei and the HRB.1 In \ngeneral, the overall water quality improvement in the river basin can be attributed to completed \nprojects under the Hai River Pollution Control and Prevention Plan (HRPPCP), and to the \nclosure  of  polluting  enterprises.  Both  have  helped  reduce  discharge  of  chemical  oxygen \ndemand in the HRB.  \n \nTable A2.1: Control Sections Meeting Surface-Water Quality Standards: \nHebei Province and Hai River Basin \n \n    Classes below Target \nItem  Year  Better  Zero (on  1  2   3  4 \nthan  target) \nTarget \nHebei Province  1995  0  8  27  13  6  0 \n  1998  19  6  22  6  1  0 \nHai River Basin   1995  0  13  56  22  19  2 \n  1998  27  12  52  12  8  1 \nSource: ADB. 1999.

A major factor in determining sector performance is investment in wastewater treatment, \nrelative to wastewater generation.  Table A2.2 shows that if all wastewater treatment plants \noperate at full capacity, only 23% of Hebei's municipal wastewater, at most, will be treated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Water quality has been monitored in 54 control sections in Hebei Province and 112 control sections in HPG since \n1995. \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nTable A2.2: Treatment Capacity and Wastewater Generated: Hebei Province \nYear  Wastewater  Treatment  Ratio of Treatment Capacity to \nGenerated  Capacity  Wastewater Generated \n  '000 m3/year  '000 m3/year   \n1995  1,760,000  134,685  0.08 \n1996  1,730,000  193,085  0.11 \n1997  1,694,000  247,835  0.15 \n1998  1,690,000  247,835  0.14 \n1999  1,693,000  247,835  0.15 \n2000  1,697,000  382,885  0.23 \n  Source: Hebei provincial government.  \n \nC.  Institutional Framework:  Laws, Policies, and Government Agencies \n \n5.  The institutional framework for managing surface-water quality in the HRB includes (i) \nlegal standards and targets for surface-water quality; and (ii) the policies, regulations, and plans \nto meet the targets. The 1996 Water Pollution and Prevention Law authorized setting national \nstandards for surface-water quality and using these standards to set targets for individual \nwatercourses. The law empowers the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) to \ndefine technical standards at a national level. \n \n6.  The standards of surface water quality are set according to the intended use of the \nwater. Classes I, II, and III apply to surface water for drinking. Classes IV and V are for surface \nwater for irrigation or industry. Each class is defined by 30 criteria, prescribing numeric ranges \nfor the physical, chemical, and biological properties of water (such as temperature, pH, and \ncoliform counts). Once SEPA defined the water quality classes, the desired or targeted ambient \nwater quality was determined for each river reach. SEPA set the desired or targeted ambient \nwater quality for some strategic river reaches but, more generally, the environmental protection \ndepartment at either the municipal or provincial level set the targeted water quality class. \n \n7.  The plan attain water quality standards in Hebei derives largely from the HRPCPP. After \nSEPA approved the plan in 1999, all the provinces and provincial cities in the HRB obtained \nSEPA endorsement of a pollution-control plan for that part of the HRB within their jurisdiction. \nThe Hebei provincial government issued its HRPCPP in July 2000.  Each municipality has \nprepared subordinate local plans. \n \n8.  The HRPCPP does not, by itself, provide a feasible plan to meet the basin\u2019s water \nquality targets since it merely identified potential projects without prioritizing them. To help refine \nthe HRPCPP, ADB funded the development of a refined strategic plan, which was completed in \nDecember 1999. The results of the study included the Immediate Implementation Plan (IIP) and \nthe Strategic Basin Management Plan (SBMP). The IIP was developed by assessing and \nprioritizing the HRPPCP projects, resulting in 86 priority projects. The four project cities and \ncomponents were included in the IIP. The SBMP addressed the need for a long-term optimum \nstrategy  that  includes  monitoring  and  management  information  systems,  strengthening  of \nregulations and river basin planning and management, identification and implementation of that \nstrategy, and monitoring and review of that strategy.  \n \n \n \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nD.  Evaluation of Current Framework, and Needed Reforms \n \n9.  The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s approach to managing water quality, based on targets \nfor ambient water quality, is an approach used widely and effectively around the world. Like \nother  comprehensive  approaches  to  managing  water  quality,  ambient  standards  require \nadvanced scientific, engineering, and administrative expertise. The HRB management system \nstill lacks this as it is still in the early stages of development, although proceeding at a pace at or \nabove that in other countries. \n \n10.  Meeting the water quality targets requires a system to manage and control all significant \nemissions. Such a system involves at least three elements: emission permits, monitoring of \nemissions and ambient water quality, and enforcement of permit violations. Each of these \nelements is a part of the HRPCPP, or is being developed.  \nE.  Need for the Project \n11.  Hebei's surface-water quality has suffered due to large quantities of untreated urban \nwastewater discharged into receiving waters, and insufficient wastewater treatment facilities. \nHebei has committed to control water pollution in support of the HRPCPP.  \n \n12.  The Project will add about 197 million cubic meters per year of treatment capacity, or \nabout 50% of the total treatment capacity in Hebei. In combination with other projects and the \nexisting wastewater treatment plants, at least 75% of municipal wastewater will be treated by \n2010, which will significantly improve surface-water quality. The Project will also help strengthen \nthe institutional capacity for basin-wide wastewater management through policy reform and \ninstitutional capacity building. \n \nF.  Policy Dialogue \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s agenda for policy dialogue in the wastewater sector covers (i) basin-wide pollution \nprevention and control, (ii) industrial and municipal wastewater management, (iii) enterprise \nreform and corporate governance, (iv) cost recovery and tariff reform, and (v) private sector \nparticipation. To promote public support for the Project, the provincial government has prepared \na  brief  policy  statement  addressing  investments,  service  coverage,  tariffs,  institutional \nresponsibilities, and industrial pollution control and monitoring (Supplementary Appendix A).    \n \n  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  27 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE (ADB) \n \nNo.  Name  Date of  Loan  Status  Perfor-\nApproval  Amount  mance \n ($ million)  Ratea \nA.

Only Tangshan and Baoding have operational wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), \nand only the Tangshan MSC has experience as an established and independent company. The \nnew MSCs need to gain expertise in the following: project management, efficient operating \nprocedures, preventive maintenance; financial management, social impact and environmental \nmonitoring, customer and public relations, business planning and management information \nsystem development, human resources development, and corporate governance. MSC capacity \nA\nbuilding will be achieved through consultant inputs, hands-on training in project facilities, training  p\np\nin the PRC, and international training financed from the ADB loan.   e\nn\n  dix\n 9\n \n3\n7\n   ", "38  Appendix 10 \n7.

Overview \n \n1.   The financial projections have been prepared in accordance with  Guidelines for the \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the ADB and \nFramework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  financial  performance  of  operational  municipal \nsewerage companies (MSCs) has been evaluated and projections made with and without the \nProject.  Where MSCs need to be formed, an opening balance statement has been created and \nprojections made from it with and without the Project. A sensitivity analysis has also been \nundertaken  using  five  key  variables:  increase  in  capital  costs,  increase  in  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs, decrease in revenue, currency devaluation, and benefits delayed by \n1 year. The results show that these variables will not jeopardize the viability of the Project. \nFurther details of the financial projections are in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nB.  Basis of Estimation \n \n2.   For the financial analysis, constant (2003) prices were used.  The financial projections \nwere calculated for 15 years (2003\u20132017) using current prices. \n \nC.  Operating Costs \n \n3.   Direct O&M costs include repairs and maintenance, personnel, energy costs, chemicals, \nadministration, and other expenses. Total direct O&M costs have been estimated in the project \npreparation  technical  assistance  feasibility  studies  and  compared  to  the  actual  operating \nexperience of the existing Tangshan wastewater treatment plant and other similar plants in the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC). On this basis, the major items and their proportion of direct \nO&M costs are repairs and maintenance (37%), wages (16%), energy (16%), chemicals (2\u2013\n10%), and administration (16%).  These proportions are considered reasonable.    \n \n4.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and is based on 5% of the \nhistorical cost of fixed assets (for new assets) and 2% for existing assets to be transferred from \nthe municipal government departments. \n \nD.  Revenues \n \n5.  Revenue from wastewater tariffs has been calculated by multiplying the volume of \nwastewater treated by the proposed tariffs for each year. The tariffs will be increased in three \nsteps (2004, 2006, and 2008) to ensure that full cost recovery is achieved by 2008, the first year \nof operations. The proposed wastewater tariff in constant prices ranges from CNY0.97 per cubic \nmeter (m3) in Tangshan to CNY1.24 per m3 in Zhangjiakou in 2008.  Details of tariffs are shown \nin Appendix 14. \n \nE.   Financial Projections and Assumptions of Municipal Sewerage Companies  \n \n1.  Projected Financial Performance and Position  \n \n6.  Projected financial performance and position of each MSC are shown in Table A11.1.  \nThe analysis shows that each MSC has sufficient funds to operate the assets to be provided by \nthe Project and to meet any debt service requirements. \n ", "  Appendix 11  41  \nTable A11.1: Municipal Sewerage Company Financial Projections 2008:  \nSummary Results \n  Debt Service  Current  Debt-Equity  Return on Net \n  Coverage  Ratio     Ratio  Assets  \nTown  Ratio  (%) \nBaoding  2.1  3.6  0.5  8.6 \nChengde  1.4  2.0  0.7  3.0 \nTangshan  1.4  3.1  0.5  4.3 \nZhangjiakou and/or Xuanhua  3.4  4.9  0.4  7.0 \n       Source: Feasibility study and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n2.  Financial Assumptions \n \n7.   Annual revenue until 2008 is based on the proposed tariff increases and estimates of \nwastewater treatment volume less commission paid to the collecting agency, including the \nexisting water supply company.1 Tariffs are assumed to stay constant in real terms beyond \n2008.  Nonoperating  revenue  is  assumed  to  be  zero  for  Chengdu  and  Zhangjiakou  while \nBaoding receives funds from fertilizer sales, and Tangshan receives funds to maintain storm-\nwater drainage. Expenditures for the existing assets are expected to stay the same in real \nterms. All the wastewater treatment plants are assumed to be operating at full capacity from \n2010.  \n \n8.  Existing wastewater assets are assumed to be transferred to the MSCs in 2008. Income \ncollection efficiency is assumed to be 90% consistent with other well-managed MSCs in the \nPRC. The arrears collection rate is assumed to be 50%. Accounts payable represent 10% of \noperating expenses.  \n \n9.  Long-term debt includes the ADB loan (London interbank offered rate [LIBOR]-based \nloan) and domestic loans. The MSCs will be subject to a profit tax of 30%. Value-added tax is \n6% of revenue, the urban maintenance fee is 7% of value-added tax, and the education fee is \n3.5% of value-added tax. Long-term investments are assumed to be zero, since no other \ninvestment plans for the next 5\u201310 years are sufficiently advanced to be assessed. \n \n10.  For Baoding, counterpart funding will come from a combination of municipal government \nequity contribution and domestic loans. Chengde will obtain counterpart funding from municipal \ngovernment equity contribution, user charges, and domestic loans. In Tangshan, equity funds \nfrom the municipal government will be supplemented by user fees from the existing operations \nto provide all necessary counterpart funds. For Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, the MSC is expected \nto  obtain  state  bonds  from  the  central  Government  to  cover  some  counterpart  funding \nrequirements, with the remainder coming from a municipal government equity contribution and \nuser charges. \n \nF.  Subsidies  \n \n11.  An equity contribution will be provided by the central Government in the form of state \nbonds to Zhangjiakou and  Xuanhua during construction. For all other cities, the municipal \ngovernments are expected to provide direct equity funds during construction.  Therefore, no \ndirect subsidies are being provided to the MSCs.  \nA\np\n                                                  p\ne\n1 For efficiency of the collection, wastewater tariffs are normally surcharged to water supply tariffs.  nd\nix\n 1\n0\n \n4\n1\n   ", "42  Appendix 12 \n4\n2\n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n  A\np\nA.  Introduction  p\ne\n  nd\nix\n1.  This summary resettlement plan draws upon the composite plan, covering four detailed   1\n1\nplans. The wastewater components in each of the four project cities involve land acquisition and   \nresettlement effects, and detailed resettlement plans have been prepared in Chinese for each \ncity.  Resettlement  planning  takes  into  account  all  persons  affected.  The  selection  of  the \ntreatment plant sites and main wastewater pipeline routes was based on sitting and alignment \noptions that minimized acquisition of cultivated land, temporary land use, and demolition of \nhouses. The plans are based on preliminary design work and may be modified slightly after the \ndetailed engineering for each component has been finalized. \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n2.  The Project will affect approximately 5,000 people: \n \n(i)  physical relocation of 230 residential households (736 people); \n(ii)  25 shops, institutes, or enterprises affected (1,195 people); \n(iii)  permanent land acquisition of 60 hectares (ha)\u2014on average a 10% loss for \naffected villages, and a complete loss of land for 664 people; and \n(iv)  temporary land acquisition of 171 ha\u2014on average a 5% loss for affected villages, \nand a partial loss of land for 3,124 people. \n \n3.  Zhangjiakou will have the greatest permanent effects because the construction of the \nsewer network is also part of a road-widening project. Luojiafang village in Zhangjiakou will lose \n25% of its land. In Baoding, 2,413 persons will lose one crop on account of temporary land \nborrow. As relatively small parcels of land are being acquired in other villages, most households' \nlivelihoods will not suffer greatly. \n \nC.  Policy Framework \n \n4.  The resettlement plans are based on policies and regulations relating to land acquisition \nand resettlement in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and on the ADB\u2019s policy and \nguidelines on resettlement. The plans adopt the following principles: \n \n(i)  Select a scheme that is feasible from an economic, engineering, environmental, \nand social point of view, and minimizes the need for resettlement and impact on \npeople. \n(ii)  Consider local economic development plans, existing community situations, and \naffected persons\u2019 resettlement problems and concerns.  \n(iii)  Ensure that the livelihood and standard of living of affected persons are not \naffected by the Project. \n(iv)  Ensure that the resettlement plan conforms to the requirements of ADB\u2019s policy \nguidance and of PRC laws, regulations, and policies on land acquisition and \nresettlement. \n(v)  Ensure that compensation fees are paid by the municipal sewerage company \n(MSC) to the village committees and used to resettle affected people.   \n \n5.  Entitlements and compensation rates are shown in Table A12.1. Payments will be made \nto the affected persons before house demolition and ground leveling, and before any loss of \n ", "  Appendix 12  43  \nland. Temporary land will be utilized for a maximum of 6 months and then returned to the \naffected persons. Costs for restoration of land to its original condition have been incorporated \ninto compensation costs. \n \n6.  Villages affected by land acquisition will invest their land compensation and resettlement \nsubsidy  in  livestock  and  dairy  programs,  vegetable  farming,  and  small  enterprises. \nRehabilitation will include allocation of cultivable land to affected households. \n \nD.  Consultation, Disclosure, Grievance, and Participation \n \n7.  During the formulation of the resettlement plans, consultations were held with the city \ndistricts, county governments, mass organizations, and representatives of affected villages. \nAffected people will be able to access the resettlement plans at MSC headquarters; village \noffices have already issued a resettlement information booklet covering resettlement policies, \nentitlements,  and  grievance  procedures.  Resettlement  and  compensation  will  be  further \nexplained to affected people. The final resettlement plan will be made available at village offices \nand encompass comments from the public. Grievances may be expressed verbally to the local \nvillage committee or more formally by letter to higher authorities at the county or municipal land \nmanagement bureau. \n \nE.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n \n8.  The main cost item for resettlement will be land compensation. The total cost of land \nacquisition and resettlement is estimated to be CNY184.3 million or $22.3 million. The MSCs \nwill fund the resettlement costs according to resettlement plan standards. \n \nF.  Implementation Schedule \n \n9.  The resettlement plan will be supervised by the four project implementing agencies. \nLand  acquisition,  house  demolition,  and  resettlement  progress  dovetail  with  the  project \nconstruction schedule and will be completed a month before project construction. \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation   \n \n10.  During implementation, internal monitoring will be undertaken every 6 months by the \nMSCs and other organizations involved in implementation. After resettlement, the MSCs will \nmonitor  the  impacts  annually  for  1\u20132  years.  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be \nundertaken twice a year during implementation, and annual evaluation will be conducted for 1\u20132 \nyears after resettlement. The monitoring and evaluation reports will be submitted to ADB \nthrough the Hebei Project Management Office, which will appoint the monitor in consultation \nwith the MSCs once the domestic feasibility studies have been approved. \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 1\n1\n \n4\n3\n   ", " \n4\n4\nTable A12.1: Entitlements Matrix    \n(including compensation rates) \nProject Loss  Compensation  Basis for Calculation of Compensationa  Other Measures  Ap\np\nPermanent loss of  Cash payment to the  Allocation of replacement land; cash compensation in CNY/ha:  Reassignment of collective land to  e\nn\ncultivated land  village collective  Baoding\u2014-CNY1,2 million (grain); Chengde\u2014-CNY1.5 million;  spread loss among all villagers  d\nTangshan\u2014-CNY4.7 million; Zhangjiakou\u2014-CNY 793,000.

Introduction \n1.  The methodology adopted for the poverty reduction and social strategy (Table A13.1) \nincluded (i) review of statistical data; (ii) design and implementation of socioeconomic, ability-to-\npay, and willingness-to-pay surveys; (iii) inventory of losses for resettlement planning; (iv) site \nvisits; (v) discussions with provincial and project city authorities, industries, and communities; \n(vi)  assessment  of  social  impacts  based  on  qualitative  and  quantitative  research;  (vii) \npreparation of resettlement plans; and (viii) preparation of a monitoring and evaluation program \nfor social dimensions and resettlement. This poverty and social analysis was undertaken with \ninput by the National Center for Resettlement Research of Hohai University, and the Hebei and \ncity project management offices.  \n \nTable A13.1: Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \na.

A poverty assessment has been prepared for the Project.  \nb.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Other \nAnalysis: Findings of the poverty assessment can be summarized as follows: \n \n\u2022  The Project will benefit 2.4 million people in the project cities by 2010 through improved public health and better \nenvironmental conditions in urban waterways. \n\u2022  Project implementation will stabilize or reduce industrial unemployment by industries ability to comply with \nenvironmental regulations.  \n\u2022  Residents downstream from the wastewater treatment plants and outside the project cities will benefit through \nreduced contamination of potable water, and better water for industry, irrigation, and fisheries.  \n\u2022  Construction jobs will be available for skilled and unskilled labor. \n\u2022  The combined wastewater and water supply charge is proposed to be no greater than 4% of the income of the \npoorest 10% of households in each city.  \nc.  Resettlement \nFour project cities undergo land acquisition and resettlement, and detailed resettlement plans have been prepared in \nChinese for each city. Resettlement planning takes into account all persons affected. Selection of the treatment plant \nsites and main wastewater pipeline routes was based on options that minimized resettlement.

Socioeconomic Baseline of the Project Beneficiary Area \n \n2.  Hebei  Province  is  around  190,000  square  kilometers,  including  approximately  500 \nkilometers of coastline, and has 66.1 million people, of which 12 million live in urban areas. The \nprovince has Han, Hui, Manchu, Mongolian, and Korean ethnic minorities.  \n \n3.  The total population and population growth rates are shown in Table A13.2.  \n \nTable A13.2: Population and Growth Rates \n  Total  Urban  Annual Birth  Annual  Natural \nPrefecture  Population  Population  Rate  Death Rate  Growth Rate \n('000)  ('000)  (per 1,000)  (per 1,000)  (per 1,000) \nHebei Province  66,140  12,550  12.99  6.26  6.73 \nBaoding   10,500  1,560  9.16  4.62  4.54 \nChengde  3,530  660  10.67  5.82  4.85 \nTangshan   6,940  1,890  9.22  6.01  3.21 \nZhangjiakou, including  4,440  1,040  9.47  6.13  3.34 \nXuanhua \nNote:  Provincial figures are derived from sample surveys and are different from city figures based on registration \nof individuals.  \nSource: Hebei Economic Yearbook 2000, China Statistics Press. \n \n4.  The natural growth rate for the project cities appears low when compared with that of the \nprovince. This variation may be attributed to discrepancies between the two sources of data, \nand the net effect of the unregistered floating population, rural migration to the cities, and \nnonregistration of second-born children in the cities. The natural growth rate in all areas is likely \ncloser to 6.7 per 1,000 people (being the total figure for the province derived from the sample \nsurvey method). \n \n5.  About half the population in the province and the project cities is employed, with a larger \nportion engaged in primary industry (forestry, fishing, and agriculture) in Baoding and Chengde \nthan  in  the  other  cities.  Tangshan  has  more  people  employed  in  secondary  industry \n(manufacturing) than do the other project cities, perhaps because Tangshan is more industrially \ndeveloped. The agricultural sector is the main employer, and most people depend on land as \ntheir income base coupled with employment in secondary industry activities.

A  household  whose  income  is  below  the \nminimum living standard is eligible to receive assistance from the local government.  The \nestablished minimum living standards for the project cities are in Table A13.5.  \n \nTable A13.5:  Minimum Living Standard for Urban Citizens in Project Cities \n \nCity  Minimum Living Standard  \n(CNY/person/month) \nBaoding  156 \nChengde  150 \nTangshan  195 \nZhangjiakou, including Xuanhua   150 \n   Source: Final report of the urban poverty study in 1999. \n \n8.  The minimum living standards established through the local government for citizens \nwithin  the  project  cities  range  from  CNY1,800  to  CNY2,340  per  year.  ABD  has  recently \ncompleted a study on urban poverty in the  People\u2019s Republic of China  (PRC).1 The study \nestablished Hebei's urban poverty line at CNY2,509 per capita per year, which is higher than \nthat established by the local government.   \n \n9.  A socioeconomic survey, including of willingness and ability to pay, was conducted for \n600 households during the feasibility study. The survey showed that people in all project cities \nare willing to pay an average maximum of CNY5.5 per month for wastewater collection and \ntreatment. The survey also showed that at least 8% of households have incomes of less than \nCNY6,000 per year. As at least 3.4 people make up the average lower-income household, \nCNY6,000 per year per household (CNY1,765 per capita) would put the household below the \npoverty line. Household surveys show, however, that Baoding had no households with incomes \nless than CNY6,000; Tangshan had only 3% in this category, and Chengde, 5%. The Boading \nand Tangshan MLSS levels are slightly higher than in other cities. The availability of this \nscheme may account for the difference in the reporting of lower household incomes through the \nsurvey. \n \n10.  The poverty line established through the MLSS varies among cities from CNY1,800 to \nCNY2,340 per capita, which is lower than the CNY2,509 established by the PRC Urban Poverty \nStudy. The MLSS established by the study has been adopted for project poverty assessment. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1999.

If at least 8% of \nbeneficiaries are poor, the Project will benefit at least 200,000 poor people.     \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Impact Assessment \n \n11.  The  assessment  considered  (i)  portions  of  the  project  areas  where  the  poor  are \nconcentrated, (ii) proportion of the project beneficiaries who are poor, (iii) project benefits \ntargeted toward the poor, and (iv) project impact on the quality of life and well-being of the poor.  \n \n12.  The poor are interspersed within the broader group of project beneficiaries. To target the \npoor would be seen as excluding the wider community. Wastewater services provided by the \nProject will be available to everyone.  \n \n13.  The  Project  will  indirectly  help  reduce  urban  poverty  by  preventing  the  closure  of \nindustries that cannot afford to meet treatment requirements for discharge into rivers. The \nProject will also indirectly improve the health and well-being of beneficiaries through improved \nlocal  environmental  conditions,  particularly  water  quality,  which  will  improve  urban  living \nconditions and environmental health.  \n \n14.  Project benefits\u2014reduced contamination of potable water supplies and better water for \nirrigation\u2014will extend to the residents downstream of the wastewater treatment plants and \noutside the project cities. The gradual improvement in water quality and irrigation farmland and \nin investment opportunities will enhance the environment and make the area attractive to \ntourists.  \n \n15.  The  Project  will  create  construction  jobs  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during \nimplementation, and hire about 5,000 workers over the 5-year construction period. They will be \nengaged mainly in building sewers and civil works for the wastewater treatment plants.  \n \nD.  Maximized Benefits for the Poor and Women \n \n16.  The  project  cities  are  required  to  implement  cost  recovery  measures,  including \nincreasing wastewater tariffs. The combined wastewater and water supply charge is proposed \nto be no greater than 4% of the income of the poorest 10% of households in each city. Each \nproject city government will review the impact of increased water and wastewater tariffs on the \npoor and introduce poverty reduction policies to protect the basic living standards of the urban \npoor. Women will have an equal opportunity to work on construction. A health education \nprogram will target women and children. \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  49 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction  \n \n1.  Financial analysis has been prepared in accordance with Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the ADB and Framework for \nthe Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Details of the financial analysis are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nB.  Financial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n2.  The total project cost is estimated at $165.4 million, which includes base costs, financing \ncharges, and 10% physical contingencies on all items except land acquisition. Inflation over the \nconstruction period is estimated at 2.5% in the first year and then 4% thereafter for local costs \nand 2.4% for foreign costs. The largest individual cost component is for infrastructure works \n(construction of wastewater treatment plants and associated pipe networks), which represent \naround 79% of total costs.  \n \n3.  Direct  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  include  repairs  and  maintenance, \npersonnel, energy, chemicals, administration, and other expenses. Total direct O&M costs have \nbeen estimated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) feasibility studies and \ncompared to the actual operating experience of the existing Tangshan wastewater treatment \nplant and other similar plants in the People's Republic of China (PRC). On this basis, the major \nitems and their proportion of direct O&M costs are repairs and maintenance (37%), wages \n(16%), energy (16%), chemicals (2\u201310%), and administration (16%).  These proportions are \nconsidered reasonable. \n \n4.   The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project was calculated over a 25-year \nperiod on net cash flows. The base-case FIRR of the five project components is 5.0\u20137.3%,  \nwhich is equal to or above the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in real terms.  The \nWACC used is at the minimum rate test level of 4% for all components, as the calculated \nWACCs were below this level. The FIRRs and associated sensitivity tests are in Table A14.1. \nAll components are financially sustainable with positive FIRRs for all sensitivity tests.  The \ncomponents are more sensitive to changes in revenues than changes in costs.  \n \n5.   It is important to note that even with the devaluation of the yuan by 30% against the \ndollar, components still show a positive FIRR. Risk mitigation measures include the PPTA \nfeasibility studies that identified tradable and nontradable components to ensure that foreign \nexchange requirements have not been overestimated.   \n \nC.  Tariff Structure and Affordability \n \n6.  Wastewater tariffs to be set by the project cities must comply with PRC guidelines. For \nBaoding,  Chengde,  and  Zhangjiakou,  which  do  not  have  municipal  sewerage  companies \n(MSCs), the objective is to introduce wastewater tariffs during construction. These will likely \ndifferentiate between domestic and industrial consumers. Proposed tariff increases have been \nendorsed by the Hebei Provincial Price Bureau and agreed to by each project city. Full cost \nrecovery tariffs for these cities  will be introduced by 2008, following commissioning of the \ncompleted facilities.  The cities have committed to undertake an annual review of tariffs and to \nincrease them in 2004, 2006, and 2008. \n ", "50  Appendix 14 \n \nTable A14.1: Summary of the Financial Evaluation and Sensitivity Analyses  \n  FIRR(%)  Base  Capital  O&M  Revenue   Currency  Revenue  Switching \n  and SI  Case  Cost  Cost    Devaluati Delay by  Value  \nTown  +10%  +10%  \u201310%  on   1 Year  (%) \n \u201330% \nBaoding  FIRR  5.6  4.6  3.7  2.5  1.3  3.6  5.1 \n  SI    1.7  3.4  5.6  2.5     \nChengde  FIRR  5.7  4.7  4.7  3.6  2.9  4.2  8.1 \n  SI    1.6  1.7  3.6  1.6     \nTangshan  FIRR  7.3  6.6  5.7  4.8  4.0  5.1  13.3 \n  SI    0.9  2.2  3.4  1.5     \nZhangjiakou  FIRR  5.1  4.2  2.8  1.6  0.3  3.0  3.1 \n  SI    1.8  4.5  6.9  3.2     \nXuanhua  FIRR  5.0  4.1  2.8  1.7  0.4  3.0  2.9 \n  SI    1.8  4.3  6.7  3.0     \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity indicator.  \nSource: Feasibility study and staff estimates. \n \n7.    In Tangshan, the wastewater tariff has to be set at a full cost recovery level to comply \nwith World Bank loan covenants.  The final tariff structure to be adopted by the project cities will \nuse  national  guidelines  being  developed  under  the  ADB  technical  assistance,1  including \nconsideration of a two-part tariff. Current and proposed tariffs are shown in Table A14.2. \n \nTable A14.2: Existing and Proposed Tariffs  \n(CNY/m3)  \n  Baoding  Chengde  Tangshan  Zhangjiakou/Xuanhua  \nCurrent Tariff   0.25a       \n   Domestic    1.36  0.60   \n   Industrial      0.85   \n2007 Tariffs in constant prices \n     Average   1.13  1.12  0.97  1.24 \n     Domesticc   0.98  0.69  0.82  0.78 \n     Industrialc  1.38b  1.55  1.03  1.57 \n2007 Tariffs in current prices \n    Average  1.41  1.39  1.22  1.55 \n    Domesticc   1.23  0.86  1.03  0.97 \n    Industrialc  1.72b  1.93  1.30  1.84 \nCNY = yuan, m3 = cubic meters. \na Wastewater charge, where connected to the municipal water supply and based on 100% of water supplied. \nb Industry with own water supply connection. \nc \nIf a common existing differential tariff structure were used. \nSource: Feasibility study and staff estimates. \n \n \n8.

The water tariff for domestic consumers in Chengde must increase by 31% in real terms \nbefore the combined water and wastewater charges exceed 5% of monthly household income \nfor the poorest 5% of households.  For Baoding, the domestic water tariff would have to be \nincreased by 128%; for Tangshan, 263%; and for Zhangjiakou, 42%, before the affordability \nthreshold for combined water and wastewater charges is breached. \n  \n10.  An analysis of the financial situation of municipal budgets indicates that funds are \nsufficient to meet counterpart contributions, and that should MSCs default on loan repayment, \nthey will be able to absorb the debt-servicing requirements without undue financial stress. \n \nD.  Cost Recovery \n \n11.  In the PRC, the policy on cost recovery and tariff setting is clear. Circular 11922 requires \na simple volume-based tariff and full cost recovery from user charges. New national guidelines \nfor wastewater tariffs are being developed with ADB assistance and will extend existing policies \nby providing a more comprehensive analysis of the situation in the PRC.  These new national \nguidelines will be considered by the cities when introducing new tariffs.  \n \n12.   After commissioning of the assets to be constructed under the Project, the MSCs will \nadopt full cost recovery tariffs based on full O&M costs, interest on loans, the greater of \ndepreciation or principle repayments, and a reasonable profit margin. \n \n                                                 \n2  Jointly  developed  by  the  State  Development  Planning  Commission,  Ministry  of  Construction,  and  State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, September 1999. \n ", "52  Appendix 15 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The economic analysis of the Project is not based on standard benefit-cost analysis, \nsince it imposes an unduly restrictive perspective on the Project. Benefit-cost analysis must \nconsider all social benefits and costs, covering the entire project scope so that all other factors \nare exogenous to the analysis. In the case of wastewater treatment, benefit-cost analysis is \nappropriate where a regulatory or management regime is not in place, and where the project \nintends to address simple and specific water pollution problems: for example, raw wastewater \naffecting a single large water user downstream. The Project, in contrast, is a small part of the \ngreater  plan  to  manage  water  quality  in  the  basin,  so  an  analysis  focusing  only  on  the \nwastewater treatment plants would not reveal the full economic justification or motivation for the \nProject. \n \n2.  The primary aim of the Project is to help Hebei Province meet the legally established \nwater quality targets for the Hai River Basin. The economic analysis therefore focused first on \nthe goals, to evaluate whether they are reasonable and command public support. Taking the \ngoals as given, the economic analysis considered how the goals can be met at the least \neconomic cost. \n \nB.  Evaluation of the Water Quality Targets \n \n3.  The wastewater sector analysis in Appendix 2 discusses the water quality targets and \nlegal framework. The water quality targets could, in principle, be determined by benefit-cost \nanalysis;  if  so,  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  could  rest  on  the  benefit-cost analysis \nconducted in support of the targets. However, they were not set using benefit-cost analysis but \ndetermined through a consultative process within government, with some consultation with \nexternal stakeholders. The justification for the targets would be stronger if there were more \nevidence of public participation in water quality target setting. However, it is a technical process \nin which the general public has little interest, and the targets as well as the method of setting \nthem are broadly consistent with best international practice. \n \n4.  Despite the limited public participation in target setting, broad public support is evident \nfor improving environmental quality in general and water quality in particular. The survey \nconducted for the Project indicated general public support for improved water quality. In the \nproject cities, 61% of survey respondents rated \u201ca clean environment and unpolluted rivers\u201d as \n\u201cmost important,\u201d and installing a sewerage system was the number-one priority for urban \nimprovement1. The analysis of other recent ADB-funded projects in the PRC found similar \nsupport for water quality management and environmental improvement. \n \nC.  Evaluation of the Plan for Meeting the Water Quality Targets \n \n5.  The plan to meet the goals is embodied mainly in the Hai River Pollution Prevention and \nControl  Plan  (HRPCPP).  Development  of  a  water  quality  management  regime  has  many \ncomponents, and a prioritization process considered all the important economic factors to \nestablish the highest priorities, which appear reasonable from an economic perspective.2 \n \n                                                 \n1  Main Report, Hebei Province Wastewater Management Project, August 2001.  \n2  Main Report, Hai River Basin Wastewater Management Project, December 1999.  \n ", "  Appendix 15  53 \n6.  Table A15.1 shows that the components of the Project are among the highest priorities \nfor implementing the HRPCPP.3 Only the plant for Tangshan New District received a relatively \nlow score. The Tangshan treatment plant was included in the Project because of significant \nchanges in Tangshan since the completion of the prioritization process. \n \nTable A15.1: Prioritizing Score for Wastewater Treatment Projects in Hebei Province \nPlanning Zone  Municipality or Prefecture  Treatment Plant  Score \nDaqing River  Baoding  Baoding City  40 \n  Baoding  Mancheng County  36 \nLuan River  Chengde  Chengde City  44 \n  Chengde  Shuanluan  44 \n  Tangshan  New District  36 \nYongding River  Zhangjiakou  Zhangjiakou City  42 \n  Zhangjiakou  Xuanhua  42 \n  Zhangjiakou  Zhangjiakou Pharm.  39 \nNote: Only the highest and lowest priorities in each planning zone are shown.

The treatment plants in the Project are therefore an integral component in the plan to \nmeet the Hai River Basin\u2019s water quality targets. Economic analysis of the project components \nshows that they are designed to achieve least-cost management of wastewater. Three aspects \nin the design are crucial: (i) all significant point sources in the surrounding areas are controlled, \n(ii) all wastewater generators will face the same effluent charge, and (iii) the charge will \napproximate  the  marginal  cost  of  processing  wastewater  at  the  central  treatment  plant. \nAccording to standard economic theory, these are sufficient to provide economic incentives for \nleast-cost management of wastewater across all point sources.4 \n \n8.  Although not expressed in monetary terms, clear and important  project benefits will \naccrue to project cities and beyond. Urban residents who will pay the wastewater tariff will \nbenefit from improved environmental quality. The wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) will \nbenefit downstream surface-water users, although they are difficult to identify and the benefits \nhard to express in monetary terms.   \n \n9.  The main uncertainty in the economic analysis is predicting the impact of the WWTPs on \nambient water quality. The uncertainty is due to the lack of scientific information on the link \nbetween wastewater treatment and water quality, which cannot be modeled adequately under \nexisting conditions. Developing the needed information requires a comprehensive plan that \ntakes into account regulation of stream flows and the impact of nonpoint sources and is part of \nthe evolving plan to manage water quality. The authorities appear committed to carrying out the \nrequired long-term programs.  \n                                                 \n3  The table is an abbreviated version of the full list of priorities; for complete list of priorities, see tables 4.01-4.10 of \nthe volume III, Hai River Basin Wastewater Management and Control, December 1999.  \n4  Hanley, N., J. Shogren, and B. White (1997), Environmental Economics in Theory and Practice, Oxford University \nPress. \n ", "54  Appendix 16 \nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  Potential Impacts \n1.  The Project's environmental impact is substantially positive, and the benefits greatly \noutweigh the negative impact. The Project will have substantial positive impact on the urban \nenvironment and surface-water quality in the associated rivers, impoundments, and Bohai Bay. \nWith the planned mitigation measures in place, adverse impact on the physical and natural \nenvironment will be insignificant. The Project will improve the living environment of project area \nresidents and contribute appreciably to the Hai River Basin's water pollution control program. \nThe Project will (i) safeguard the quality of water supply sources of Beijing and Tianjin, (ii) help \nto create conditions to raise living standards, and (iii) improve public health conditions.  \n \n2.  The  potentially  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  short  term:  noise,  vibration,  air \npollution, runoff, safety hazards, disposal of debris, and localized traffic congestion during \nconstruction. \nB.  Mitigation Measures \n3.  Appropriate mitigation measures have been incorporated into the selection of locations \nfor wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and sewers, and into the comparison of system \nalternatives.  Each  of  the  five  subprojects  has  adopted  measures  to  minimize  hazards  or \nnuisance, including provision of buffer zones (200\u2013300 meters) and fences, noise and aerosol \nabatement, and contingency plans for accidental wastewater overflows or spills. Processes that \ncan accommodate shock loads from ni dustry have been selected. The local environmental \nprotection bureau (EPB) in each project city is preparing a plan to control hazardous materials in \nindustrial wastewater. \n \n4.  The  Hebei  provincial  government  and  municipal  sewerage  companies  (MSCs)  will \nensure that the detailed designs of WWTPs adequately address potential effluent and sludge \nreuse issues. Before startup of the WWTPs, measures will be completed to assure collection of \nwastewater  from  major  industrial  dischargers  and  local  tertiary  sewer  networks,  and \narrangements will be in place for sludge disposal in accordance with national regulations. Each \nmunicipal government will prepare an industrial pollution control plan in a format acceptable to \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  including  relevant  monitoring  and  enforcement \narrangements. These plans are to be submitted to ADB by 31 December 2003. \n \n5.  Environmental  protection  measures  for  construction  are  required  as  part  of  the \nengineering  contracts.  Good  practices  such  as  dust  reduction,  provision  of  storm  runoff \ndetention ponds, controlled disposal of spoil material, and washing of truck tires before leaving \nthe construction site are some environmental protection measures to be adopted in the contract \nspecifications. Other stipulations will control construction activities that may produce short-term \nnoise,  vibration,  air  pollution,  muddy  runoff,  safety  hazards,  sewage  from  construction \npersonnel, solid wastes and debris, spoils, traffic congestion, and silt runoff. \n \n6.  The HPG, project cities, and MSCs will ensure that the project facilities are constructed, \noperated, maintained, and monitored in conformance with all applicable laws and regulations, \nincluding national and local regulations and standards for environmental protection, health, \nlabor, and occupational safety. These include carrying out the environmental mitigation and \nmonitoring measures detailed in the approved environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and \nsummary EIA for the Project. \n \n7.  Plans for public involvement during construction and operation have been developed, \nincluding for public participation in monitoring impacts and mitigation measures; evaluation of \n ", "  Appendix 16  55 \nenvironmental,  economic,  and  social  impacts;  and  surveys  of  public  opinion  after  project \ncompletion.  The plans include several types of public involvement: site visits, workshops, \ninvestigation of specific issues, and interviews. The plans will be incorporated into the project \nconstruction and operation management plan. \nC.  Environmental Monitoring  \n8.  Local environmental monitoring stations will be responsible for external environmental \nmonitoring  during  construction  and  operation.  The  MSC  will  be  responsible  for  internal \nenvironmental monitoring during operation. Local and provincial EPBs will be responsible for \nsupervising the monitoring. The MSCs will be responsible for daily routine monitoring. The \nenvironmental monitoring results during construction and operation will be submitted to the local \nEPB, Hebei Province Management Office (HPMO), and other responsible agencies. Local EPBs \nand the MSCs will be responsible for supervising implementation of the monitoring program \nand, if necessary, will decide on further mitigation actions during construction and operation. \nEach MSC is responsible for preparing and submitting annual environmental reports. \n \n9.  Each  MSC  will  engage  an  adequate  number  of  full-time personnel and sufficient \nresources to monitor the environmental monitoring program, under guidance of the relevant city \nEPB and Environmental Monitoring Center. Monitoring reports will be provided to the HPMO, \nwhich will coordinate the preparation of an annual environmental report in a format acceptable \nto ADB. These annual reports will be submitted to ADB, by 31 March each year, until project \nfacilities start commercial operation. \nD.  Water Quality Monitoring Network \n10.  The locations and water quality parameters to be measured at water quality monitoring \nstations will be selected as part of the project performance monitoring system, to quantify the \nProject's environmental benefits. For each urban wastewater service area, one monitoring \nstation will be located on an urban waterway upstream from the WWTP to assure that much of \nthe urban wastewater has been collected and intercepted by the project sewers. A second \nmonitoring station will be downstream from the WWTP to quantify the improvements in water \nquality affecting downstream communities and water users within the Hai River Basin and Bohai \nBay.  Where suitable, the monitored locations will be selected to coincide with the existing 54 \nmonitoring control sections in Hebei, which are operated by national, provincial, municipal, and \ncounty EPBs.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R329-02_Cover - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021129133549Z", "Title": "R329-02_Cover", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030205152328+08'00'"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2002) \n \nCurrency Unit  \u2013  yuan (CNY) \n \n        CNY1.00  =                    $0.1208      \n             $1.00  =                    CNY8.2771 \n \nThe exchange rate of the renminbi yuan is determined under a floating exchange rate \nsystem.
