The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  permanent \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  Impacts  during  construction  and \nthe  environmental \noperation  will  be  managed \nmanagement \nenvironmental \nplan.  The \nexamination is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i) rehabilitate  594  kilometers  (km)  of  existing \nrailway  track  and  associated  structures,  passing  loops,  and  spur \nlines;  (ii) reconstruct  48 km  of  destroyed  railway  line  to  Thailand; \n(iii) construct direct railway access to the container terminal in the \nthe  railway  subsector; \nport  of  Sihanoukville;  (iv) restructure \n(v) assist  employees  made \nthe \nrestructuring; and (vi) provide consulting services and training for \nproject  monitoring,  engineering  design,  and  supervision  of  civil \nworks. \n \nThe  railway  is  owned  and  operated  by  Royal  Railways  of \nCambodia  (RRC),  a  state-owned  enterprise  that  falls  under  the \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT).  The  railway \nconsists of two lines: the Southern Line (254 km), which links the \ncapital,  Phnom  Penh,  with \nin \nSihanoukville, and the Northern Line (388 km), which links Phnom \nPenh  with  Battambang  in  northwestern  Cambodia  and  Poipet  on \nthe border with Thailand. At the border, the railway connects with \nthe railway in Thailand and from there continues to Malaysia and \nSingapore. The two railway lines run roughly parallel to two of the \ncountry\u2019s primary roads: National Roads 3 and 4 to Sihanoukville \nand National Road 5 to Poipet.  \n \nCambodia\u2019s  road  transport  system  is  inefficient  because  of \ninsufficient  modal  and  route  competition.  Improving  the  sector\u2019s \nefficiency  requires  increasing  the  diversity  of  transport  so  that \nshippers  and  passengers  have  realistic  alternatives  to  existing \nroutes and modes of transport. Rail would be a highly competitive \noption, because its cost structure differs substantially from that of \ntransport by road and sea. The differences in cost structure would \nmake  it  difficult  to  establish  and  maintain  cross-modal  collusion \nbetween  road  and  rail  transport  operators.  Geographically,  rail \nwould  also  be  an  efficient  competitor  because  the  railway  runs \nparallel to the country\u2019s busiest highways, national roads 3, 4 and \n\nthe  country\u2019s  main  seaport \n\n\fiii \n\n \n\n5,  and  serves  two  international  connection  points  at  the  port  of \nSihanoukville  and  at  Poipet  on  the  border  with  Thailand.  The \nrailway  is  also  connected  to  the  Mekong  River  via  the  port  in \nPhnom  Penh.  These  links  would  enable  multimodal  integration \nthat  could  form  the  basis  for  efficient  distribution  of  bulk \ncommodities  to  northeastern  and  northwestern  Cambodia.  The \nscope  for  railway  traffic  is  substantial,  as  reflected  in  the \nrestructuring  study\u2019s  traffic  forecast,  which  predicts  that  demand \nfor  railway  freight  traffic  will  grow  by  about  7%  per  year, \nsignificantly  more  than  the  expected  economic  growth  of  some \n5.5% per year. \n \nThe railway is in poor physical condition because of war damage \nand decades of neglect. The last 48 km of track toward the border \nwith  Thailand  were  destroyed  during  the  war.  Railway  traffic  is \ndeclining  because  of  the  poor  condition  of  track  and  equipment, \nwhich  renders  the  railway  increasingly  unreliable  and  slow, \nwhereas \nimproved \nthe  competing  road  network  has  been \nsubstantially over the past decade. The RRC\u2019s staff are underpaid \nand  professional  skills  and  staffing  levels  are  deteriorating.  As  a \nresult, the railway is operating at a deficit. Neither the RRC nor the \nGovernment  of  Cambodia  (the  Government)  have  the  resources \nrequired  to  turn  the  railway  around.  Without  the  Project,  the \nrailway could cease to operate within a decade. \n \nAccess  to  efficient  railway  services  would  substantially  improve \nthe efficiency of Cambodia\u2019s transport system by enabling efficient \nand safe railway transport for heavy, bulky, and hazardous cargo, \nsuch as cement, containers, and fuel, which are currently carried \nby more expensive and less safe road haulage. The main benefits \nwould be (i) reduced cost of transport for heavy and bulky freight, \n(ii) reduced  road  maintenance  because  of  the  reduced  heavy \ntruck traffic, (iii) reduced road hazards because of the decrease in \nheavy traffic and the diversion of hazardous materials away from \ncrowded  roads  that  pass  through  numerous  densely  populated \ntowns  and  villages,  and (iv)  efficient  access  to import  and  export \nmarkets via the Thai border in Poipet. \n \nAchieving  these  benefits  requires  rehabilitating  the  railway\u2019s \ninfrastructure,  reconstructing  the  destroyed  track  leading  to \nThailand,  and  restructuring  the  railway  by  establishing  a  new \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) railway operator to take over the \noperation and maintenance of the railway on a commercial basis. \nRestructuring  of  the  railway  and  the  provision  of  transaction \nadvisory  services  to  establish  the  new  PPP  railway  operator  is \nongoing  with  advisory  technical  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Selection of a PPP railway operator is \na condition for loan effectiveness. \n \nThe  Government  gives  high  priority \nrehabilitating  and \nrestructuring  the  railway  as  a  way  to  (i) improve  Cambodia\u2019s \n\nto \n\n\f \n\niii\n\ninternational  connectivity  and  competitiveness,  and  (ii) reduce \nlosses in the public sector. \n \nCambodia\u2019s railway is a strategic element of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  transport  sector  strategy\u2019s  southern  corridor,  which \nconnects  Cambodia,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  Project  would \npave the way for the proposed construction of a new railway line \nbetween  Phnom  Penh  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  in  Viet  Nam.  If \nconstructed,  this  new  line,  together  with  the  project  line,  would \ncomplete  the  Singapore\u2013Kunming  railway  link,  which  is  a  long-\nterm  development  priority  for  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations. \n \nThe  Project  would  support  Cambodia\u2019s  economic  development \nand  strengthen  subregional  integration  by  enabling  cost-effective \nand  efficient  railway  transport  within  Cambodia  and  between \nCambodia and Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. \n \nThe  Project  involves  rehabilitating  or  reconstructing  the  railway \nand  reestablishing  the  railway  connection  with  Thailand.  The \nrailway is also being restructured and the rehabilitated railway will \nbe operated by a new, commercial railway operator. \n \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $73.0  million  equivalent,  including \ntaxes and duties of $7.4 million equivalent.  \n \n\n ($ million) \n\n%\n57\n\n18\n4\n21\n100\n\nTotal \n42.0 \n \n13.0 \n2.8 \n15.2 \n73.0 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOPEC Fund for \nInternational Developmenta \nGovernment of Malaysia (grant in kind)\nGovernment of Cambodia \n          Total \naAdministered by ADB. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $42  million  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.

Once \nrehabilitation  starts  the  RRC  will  be  divested  of  operations  and \nmaintenance  responsibilities  for  the  railway.  In  the  absence  of  a \nspecialized  agency  to  implement  the  Project,  the  MPWT  will  be \nthe  implementing  agency  through  a  project  implementation  team \nthat  has  been  set  up  within  the  MPWT  to  implement  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  for  rehabilitation.  The  team  is \nheaded by a project director and staffed with technical staff drawn \nfrom  the  RRC  and  the  MPWT.  The  team  will  be  expanded  with \nadditional \nto  undertake  project \nprocurement and implementation. ADB will provide the necessary \ntraining to the team\u2019s technical staff in relation to procurement and \nimplementation.  The  National  Committee  for  the  Singapore\u2013\nKunming Railway Project, which is a high-level committee whose \naim  is  to  facilitate  realization  of  the  Singapore\u2013Kunming  railway \nlink  and  is  chaired  by  the  deputy  prime  minister,  will  act  as  the \nsteering committee for the Project. \n \nGoods and services financed by the ADB and OFID loans will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines using \ninternational competitive bidding. The Government has requested \nthe use of advance action and retroactive financing to permit the \nexecution of preliminary works. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  consulting  services  for  construction \nsupervision,  quality  assurance,  environmental  supervision  and \nmonitoring,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement  plan, \nsocioeconomic  impact  assessment,  and  project  performance \nmonitoring.  The  international  and  national  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  through  a  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consulting  Services.  The  Government  has  requested \nthe use of advance action and retroactive financing to permit early \nrecruitment of the supervision consultant. \n \nThe traffic forecast is based on projected economic growth using \na  scenario  in  which  Cambodia  maintains  its  recent  pace  of \neconomic reform and modernization. The main sources of project \nbenefits  are  savings  from  the  diversion  of  heavy  freight  and \ncontainer  traffic  from  road  transport  to  more  economical  rail \ntransport,  which  include  reduced  costs  of  road  maintenance  and \nlowered costs of road accidents. In turn, these savings will reduce \nthe  costs  of  providing  imported  inputs  such  as  cement  and  fuel \nand  will  support  the  creation  of  new  jobs  and  other  income-\ngenerating  opportunities  in  export  industries,  which  will  become \nmore competitive as a result of reduced transport costs.  \n \n \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv\n\nThe  Project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at \n24.9%  and  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at \n10.2%,  higher  than  the  4.1%  real  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital. \n \nThe  Project  is  not  expected  to  be  subject  to  any  significant \ntechnical,  environmental,  or  social  risks.  The  MPWT  has  proven \nexperience  and  has  performed  satisfactorily  in  implementing \ninternationally financed projects. The Project has been formulated \nto  reduce  potential  economic,  financial,  and  social  risks.  The \nfinancial and economic risks are associated with operation of the \nrailway, which will depend on the future level of traffic, the costs of \nconstruction,  and  the  efficiency  of  future  railway  operations.  The \neconomic risks are minimized by the establishment of a new PPP \nrailway operator that will realize the Project\u2019s benefits by providing \nrailway  services  on  a  commercial  basis.  To  mitigate  the  financial \nrisks,  the  Government  will  establish  a  professionally  managed \ncommercial  property  developer  entity  to  mobilize  revenue  by \ndeveloping  railway  land  that  is  no  longer  needed  for  railway \noperations.  The  net  revenues  from  property  development  will \npreferentially  be  used  to  finance  the  railway\u2019s  public  service \nobligations, such as maintaining passenger traffic and developing \nthe  railway.  The  social  risks  include  resettlement,  the  possible \nspread of HIV/AIDS infection during construction, the possibility of \nhuman  trafficking  after  project  completion,  and  the  retrenchment \nof  redundant  railway  staff  in  connection  with  restructuring. \nAppropriate  mitigation  measures  are  in  place  in  the  resettlement \nplan and the social safety protection program. \n\n \n\n\fvii \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Rehabilitation  of \nthe  Railway  in  Cambodia  Project,  and  (ii)  the  proposed  administration  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment (OFID) for the Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nCambodia\u2019s  transport  sector  comprises  road,  railway,  and  inland  water  transport; \n2. \ninternational sea traffic through the ports in Sihanoukville and Phnom Penh; and domestic and \ninternational  air  traffic  centered  on  Cambodia\u2019s  two  international  airports  in  Phnom  Penh  and \nSiem  Reap.  Much  of  the  country\u2019s  transport  infrastructure  was  destroyed  or  substantially \ndegraded during the war. Reestablishing the transport infrastructure has been a primary goal of \nthe  Government  for  the  past  15  years  and  has  focused  on  (i) reconstructing  the  primary  road \nnetwork,  which  has  now  been  substantially  completed;  (ii) modernizing  and  upgrading  the \ninternational airports in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, which has been largely undertaken by the \nprivate  sector;  and  (iii) rehabilitating  and  modernizing  the  ports  in  Phnom  Penh  and \nSihanoukville.  Railway  and  inland  water  transport  have  received  somewhat  less  attention. \nInland  water  transport  is  developing  slowly,  driven  by  the  private  sector,  but  operations  are \nhampered by the lack of navigational aids and shore facilities. The railway has been declining \nbecause of insufficient maintenance and investment. Transport operations are run by the private \nsector  except  for  the  railway,  which  is  owned  and  operated  by  Royal  Railways  of  Cambodia \n(RRC),  a  state-owned  enterprise  that  falls  under  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport \n(MPWT). Transport is relatively expensive because of (i) fuel taxes, which are a major source of \nGovernment  revenues;  (ii) poor  infrastructure,  which  increases  vehicle  operating  costs  and \nconstrains  access;  and  (iii) inefficiencies  and  market  failure.  The  sector  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n\n3. \nCambodia's  transport  system  remains  inefficient  despite  improved  roads,  ports,  and \nairports,  because  the  choice  of  routes  and  modes  of  transport  is  limited,  which  constrains  the \nscope  for  optimizing  logistics  and  enables  the  formation  of  cartels  by  transport  providers  and \ntransport  infrastructure  owners  to  exploit  natural  monopolies.  The  enabling  environment  for \nthese  market  failures  is  the  existence  of  physical  and  regulatory  barriers  that  reduce  the \ndiversity of routes and modes, often to a single realistic choice. This locks transport buyers into \npossibly inefficient or overpriced services1 because of the lack of an alternative. As a result, the \nstaple  commodities  on  which  the  poor  rely  are  typically  significantly  more  expensive  in \nCambodia  than  in  neighboring  countries  and  Cambodia\u2019s  nascent  export  industries,  primarily \ngarments  and  tourism,  which  are  the  prime  generators  of  new  jobs  and  foreign  currency,  are \nthreatened because their international competitiveness is being undermined by high transaction \ncosts. This constitutes a major constraint to economic growth and diminishes the scope for the \neconomy to diversify into new sectors such as agro and assembly industry. \n                                                 \n1   As an example of constrained choice, consider the movement of a 20-foot container from Bangkok to Phnom Penh. \nCurrently,  ship  transport  through  the  port  of  Sihanoukville  is  the  only  realistic  route.  This  costs  $983  and  the \njourney time is 11 days because no direct container route exists between Bangkok and Sihanoukville. The cost of \nsimilar transport by rail\u2014were this possible\u2014would be about $320 and the journey time would be about 13 hours \n(Canarail Consultants, Inc.. 2006. Restructuring the Railway in Cambodia: Traffic Forecast and Financial Analysis \nReport. Montreal, Canada. [p. 28]. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nBreaking down the barriers that hinder competition and efficiency requires increasing the \n4. \ndiversity of transport so that shippers have effective and realistic alternatives to existing routes \nand  modes.  Railway  could  be  a  highly  competitive  operator,  because  its  cost  structure  differs \nsubstantially  from  that  of  road  and  sea  transport.  The  differences  in  cost  structure  makes  it \ndifficult  to  establish  and  maintain  cross-modal  collusion  between  road  and  railway  transport \noperators. Geographically, Cambodia offers excellent scope for rail competition because (i) the \nrailway runs parallel to the country\u2019s busiest highways, national roads 3, 4 and 5; (ii) it has two \ninternational  connection  points,  at  the  port  of  Sihanoukville  and  at  Poipet  on  the  border  with \nThailand;  and  (iii)  the  railway  is  connected  to  the  port  in  Phnom  Penh,  which  would  enable \nmultimodal  integration  of  rail  and  inland  water  transport  to  allow  for  the  efficient  distribution  of \nbulk commodities to northeastern and northwestern Cambodia. The scope for railway traffic is \nreflected  in  the  restructuring  study,2 which  projects  that  demand  for  railway  freight  traffic  will \ngrow by about 6.5% per year, which is well above expected economic growth of 5.0\u20135.5% per \nyear. \n\n5. \nCambodia\u2019s  railway  is  a  strategic  element  of  the  GMS  transport  sector  strategy\u2019s \nsouthern corridor,3 which links Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Construction of a proposed \nrailway line to Viet Nam is one of the Government\u2019s strategic goals, and the Project would help \npave the way for the proposed railway line between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet \nNam.  If  constructed,  this  new  line,  together  with  the  Project  line,  would  complete  the  railway \ncomponent of the GMS southern corridor, and at the same time would complete the Singapore\u2013\nKunming railway link (SKRL), a long-term development priority for the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations. \n\nEfficient railway transport would improve subregional traffic and significantly reduce the \n6. \ncost of transport by offering cheaper alternatives and by providing competition to existing modes \nand  routes.  Railway  transport  would  also  reduce  road  maintenance  requirements  and  the \nincidence and severity of traffic accidents by diverting heavy and hazardous road haulage to the \nrailway,  which  is  inherently  safer.  Finally,  efficient  rail  operations  would  directly  improve  the \nGovernment\u2019s  finances  by  reducing  the  railway\u2019s  deficits.  The  Government  recognizes  these \nbenefits  and  gives  high  priority  to  rehabilitating  and  restructuring  the  railway  as  a  means  of \n(i) improving Cambodia\u2019s international connectivity and competitiveness, and (ii) reducing losses \nin the public sector. However, neither the RRC nor the Government has the resources required \nto implement such rehabilitation and restructuring. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nThe  railway  was  severely  damaged  during  the  war,  when  temporary  repairs  kept  it \nrunning.  Since  then,  little  has  been  expended  on  investment  and  maintenance.  ADB  has \nsupported  emergency  repairs  on  two  occasions:  repair  of  critically  damaged  railway  sections \nand bridges and of 35 wagons under the Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project4 and repair \nof flood-damaged bridges and railway embankments under the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation \nProject.5 The World Bank has also supported the acquisition of wagons and the Government of \n                                                 \n2   Canarail Consultants, Inc., 2006.

The  combined  impact  of  war  damage  and  more  than  three \ndecades of little or no maintenance and minimal investment have led to severe deterioration of \nthe railway. Maximum train speed is now 15 kilometers (km) per hour, compared with a design \nspeed  of  70 km  per  hour  on  the  Southern  Line  and  90 km  per  hour  on  the  Northern  Line. \nCurrent traffic is about 6 or 7 trains per day, compared with 37 trains in around 1969-1970. Even \nwith  this  modest  level  of  traffic,  there  is  an  average  of  one  derailment  per  week.  Technical \nreview of the railway\u2019s infrastructure indicates that many bridges are in danger of collapse and \nindicates  that  collapse  of  bridges  will  make  railway  operations  impossible  within  the  current \ndecade. \n\n8. \nIn  the  1990s,  railway  traffic  grew  rapidly,  partly  in  response  to  improving  security  and \neconomic  growth,  and  partly  because  of  a  lack  of  viable  alternatives  to  railway  transport. \nRailway freight traffic peaked in 2002 at about 560,000 tons, but then fell to about 270,000 tons \nin  2005.  Passenger  traffic  peaked  in  1992,  when  the  railway  transported  about  1.4 million \npassengers.  Today,  passenger  traffic  on  the  Southern  Line  has  ceased  and  on  the  Northern \nLine  is  minimal,  serving  about  40,000  passengers  annually  by  means  of  a  single  weekly \ndeparture in each direction between Phnom Penh and Battambang. The decline in traffic is due \nto  the  combined  impact  of  progressing  physical  deterioration  of  the  railway,  which  renders  it \nincreasingly unreliable and slow, and to increasing competition from road transporters operating \non  an  expanding  network  of  good  highways.  The  loss  of  freight  traffic  results  in  mounting \noperational losses for the railway that are absorbed by the Government. The passenger service \non the Northern Line is used primarily by passengers to and from isolated communities along a \nsection of the Northern Line that does not have reliable road access, and is therefore dependent \non the railway for transport. The Project foresees that minimal passenger services will continue \nas a public service obligation. \n\nThe issues and opportunities facing the railway were first identified in Loan 1824-CAM,6 \n9. \nwhich  concluded  (i) that  access  to  efficient  railway  transport  would  be  economically  beneficial \nfor  Cambodia,  and  (ii) that  the  railway  could  become  commercially  viable  if  rehabilitated.  The \nreport recommended that the Government should quickly decide either to restore or to close the \nrailway  to  minimize  its  losses.  Closure  of  the  railway  is,  however,  not  an  appealing  option. \nPotential future benefits derived from railway operations would be irretrievably lost unless a new \nrailway  were  constructed  in  the  future,  which  would  be  extremely  costly  compared  with \nrehabilitating the existing railway, and would probably not be viable. Two small-scale technical \nassistance (TA) studies were launched (i) to assess the likely future demand for railway traffic \n(the  transport  study7),  and  (ii)  to  examine  the  possibilities  for  establishing  commercially  viable \nrailway  operations  (the  business  opportunity  study8).  The  transport  study  confirmed  sufficient \nfuture  demand  for  railway  transport  to  make  rehabilitation  of  the  railway  economically  and \nfinancially viable. The business opportunity study showed that future losses to the Government \ncould be eliminated if the railway were operated commercially. It also indicated that operation of \nthe railway and investment in rolling stock and terminals could be viable for the private sector if \nthe railway\u2019s infrastructure were rehabilitated using concessionary funds, as this could  not be \nfinanced by the private sector under commercial conditions, nor by the Government, nor by the \nrailway,  because  of  the  lack  of  resources.  Thus  the  study  recommended  that  private  sector \ninvestment  and  management  resources  be  mobilized  by  spinning  off  railway  operations  into  a \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002.

The \nGovernment subsequently asked ADB to provide TA for preparing a project for rehabilitation of \nthe railway9 and for advisory TA to restructure the railway.10 \n\nA major portion of external assistance to the Cambodian transport sector has come from \n10. \nADB,  the  governments  of  France  and  Japan,  and  the  World  Bank.  ADB's  assistance  to  the \nsector  began  in  1993  with  the  Special  Rehabilitation  Assistance  Project  (footnote  4),  which \nincluded  rehabilitation  of  national  highways,  sections  of  the  railway  track,  and  the  port  of \nSihanoukville.  In  2000,  ADB  provided  a  loan  for  the  Emergency  Flood  Rehabilitation  Project \n(footnote 5), which rehabilitated sections of the national highway network that were damaged by \nthe  2000  floods,  along  with  critical  sections  of  track  and  embankments.  France  has  provided \ngrant financing for new bridges, rehabilitation of railway tracks, and spare parts for locomotives. \nJapan's assistance has been for bridge reconstruction and road rehabilitation. The World Bank \nhas  provided  loans  for  rehabilitating  roads  and  widening  bridges  and  culverts.  It  has  also \nprovided  TA  for  transport  sector  policy  and  strategy,  institutional  strengthening,  and  road \nmaintenance.  The  People's  Republic  of  China  has  provided  assistance  for  procuring  10 \nlocomotives.  Other  bilateral  sources  of  assistance  to  the  transport  sector  include  the \ngovernments  of  Australia,  Sweden,  and  Thailand.  Appendix  3  lists  ADB-financed  TA  and \nassistance by other development partners. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n11. \nThe proposed Project will restore the railway\u2019s infrastructure by rehabilitating its existing \ntrack and reestablishing Cambodia\u2019s rail connection with Thailand. This will be initiated in 2007 \nfor completion in 2009. The railway\u2019s operations will be improved through restructuring, which is \nongoing  and  will  be  completed  in  2007  with  the  award  to  a  private  railway  operator  of  a \nconcession  to  operate  the  railway  commercially  for  a  period  of  33  years  under  a  PPP \narrangement.  Restructuring  is  being  implemented  through  an  advisory  TA  that  advises  the \nGovernment on the future structure of the railway subsector and is advising on the selection of \nthe  PPP  railway  operator.  The  PPP  railway  operator  will  be  selected  after  competitive \ninternational  bidding  for  the  concession.  The  rehabilitation  investment  and  the  associated \nrestructuring  will  together  set  the  stage  for  efficient  rail  services,  which  in  turn  will  realize  the \nProject's  objectives,  namely:  improving  the  transport  sector's  efficiency  by  increasing  the \ndiversity of transport modes and routes and resurrecting the railway on a sustainable basis. \n\n12. \nThe  governments  of  Malaysia  and  Thailand  have  discussed  with  the  Government  of \nCambodia  support  and  cooperation  to  reconstruct  the  destroyed  link  between  Sisophon  and \nPoipet  and  to  reconnect  the  railways  in  Cambodia  and  Thailand.  Malaysia  has  confirmed  the \nprovision  of  reclaimed  rails  for  reconstruction  of  the  destroyed  link  on  a  grant  basis.  Thailand \nhas  expressed  its  intent  to  undertake  the  necessary  works  in  Thailand  to  reconnect  the  two \nrailways,  and  negotiations  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand  on  renewing  the  railway  cross-\nborder  agreement  between  the  two  countries  and  reestablishing  the  physical  link between  the \ntwo railways are ongoing. \n\nThe railway consists of two lines: (i) the Northern Line, which was built in the 1930s and \n13. \nconnects Phnom Penh to Poipet on the border with Thailand, where it links with the railway in \nThailand;  and  (ii) the  Southern  Line,  which  was  build  in  the  late  1960s  and  connects  Phnom \n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2005.

The  Northern  Line  is  388  km  long,  of \nwhich the last 48 km to the border with Thailand were destroyed during the war. The Southern \nLine branches off the Northern Line about 9 km from the station in Phnom Penh. The Southern \nLine is about 254 km long from where it branches off. The total distance by rail between Phnom \nPenh and Sihanoukville is 263 km. The railway is meter gauge, as are the railway networks in \nneighboring countries. \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe outcome of the proposed Project would be a rehabilitated and restructured railway \nthat  would  (i) increase  the  efficiency  of  the  overall  transport  sector  by  increasing  the \ncompetitiveness  of  the  railway,  (ii) secure  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  railway  subsector \nthrough  improved  productivity  and  efficiency  and  adoption  of  a  market  based  tariff,  and \n(iii) reduce  road  damage  and  road  traffic  risks  associated  with  the  movement  of  heavy  and \ndangerous  goods.  The  Project  would  also  (i) facilitate  economic  growth  in  Cambodia  by \nproviding  cost-effective  and  efficient  railway  transport,  (ii) facilitate  subregional  trade  and \neconomic  growth  in  Thailand,  (iii) pave  the  way  for  proposed  future  construction  of  a  new \nrailway  line  between  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam,  (iv) reduce  wear  and  tear  from  heavy  cargo \nhaulage  on  Cambodia\u2019s  road  network,  (v) improve  road  safety  by  diverting  heavy  and \nhazardous  cargo  from  the  roads  to  inherently  safer  railway  transport,  and  (vi) reduce  public \nsector  losses.  The  Project  assumes  that  the  railway  subsector  has  been  successfully \nrestructured and that a commercial PPP railway operator is in place. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe  output  of  the  proposed  Project  would  be  about  650  km  of  rehabilitated  or \nreconstructed railway line with associated stations and terminals; train traveling at speeds of 50 \nkm per hour; and a maximum axle load of 15 tons on the Northern Line, which is consistent with \nthe axle load standard in Thailand, and 20 tons on the Southern Line, which is consistent with \nthe original design axle load for that line and would be required to operate bulk cement trains \nand other heavy loads to and from Sihanoukville. The railway would connect with the railway in \nThailand and with water transport in Sihanoukville and Phnom Penh. \n\n16. \n\nThe Project will undertake the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nRehabilitate  the  Southern  Line.  This  will  involve  (a) rehabilitation  of  the \nSouthern  Line  from  Phnom  Penh  to  Sihanoukville  (approximately  254  km), \nincluding  making  major  repairs  to  embankments,  replacing  worn  out  and \nunserviceable sleepers, fittings and ballasting; (b) rehabilitating or reconstructing \nstructures inclusing bridges, culverts, buildings and drains; (c) constructing a new \npassing  loop;  (d)  tamping  track  to  restore  an  operational  speed  of  50  km  per \nhour; (e) rehabilitating the rail link to the port in Sihanoukville and extending it to \nthe  container  port  (a  schematic  outline  is  in  Appendix  4);  and  (f) undertaking \nancillary works at level crossings. \nRehabilitate  the  Northern  Line. This will involve (a) rehabilitating the Northern \nLine  from  Phnom  Penh  to  Sisophon  (approximately  340  km),  including  making \nmajor  repairs  to  embankments,  ballasting,  and  installation  of  missing  fittings; \n(b)   rehabilitating  or  reconstructing  structures \nincluding  bridges,  culverts, \nbuildings and drains; (c) tamping track to restore an operational speed of 50 km \nper hour; (d) rehabilitating an existing rail link to the port at Phnom Penh on the \nMekong River and (e) undertaking ancillary works at level crossings. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\nReconstruct  the  destroyed  rail  link.  This  will  include  (a) reconstructing  the \ndestroyed rail link from Sisophon to Poipet (48 km) and reestablishing the railway \nconnection  across  the  border,  including  making  major  repairs  to  embankments, \npreparing  track  bed  and  ballasting,  rehabilitating  or  reconstructing  structures \nincluding bridges, culverts, buildings and drains, and laying track; (b) constructing \nancillary facilities at level crossings; and (c) building passing loops and a station \nat Poipet with facilities for border crossing (a schematic outline is in Appendix 4). \n(iv)  Mitigate  the  adverse  impact  of  restructuring.  Restructuring  will  affect  the \ncurrent  approximately  1,100  railway  employees.  The  impact  will  be  mitigated \nthrough  (a) providing  compensation  for  future  income  losses  for  redundant \nrailway employees, (b) providing compensation for lost pension rights for railway \nemployees  whether  made  redundant  or  rehired  by  the  future  PPP  railway \noperator, and (c) counseling and retraining railway employees. \n\n \n\nLessons.  The  MPWT's  capacity  to  handle  ADB-financed  projects  has  improved \n17. \nconsiderably  in  recent  years.  Overall,  project  implementation  is  generally  satisfactory,  but \ncertain aspects need improvement. Earlier loans, both closed and ongoing loans, encountered \ndelays  in  relation  to  procurement,  resettlement  and  compensation,  and  counterpart  fund \npayments.  The  key  lessons  from  these  loans  were  that  there  was  a  need  to  ensure  that  (i) \nprocurement approval is delegated to the project management unit; (ii) processes for approving \nbid  documents  and  awarding  contracts  that  are  applicable  to  ADB-financed  contracts  under  a \nloan are clarified at the outset; (iii) satisfactory resettlement plans and frameworks are in place \nbefore  loans  are  approved;  (iv)  specific  environmental  requirements,  including  documentation \nand  reporting  requirements,  are  included  in  loan  covenant  and  bidding  documents;  and  (v) \nagreement  on  the  release  of  counterpart  funds  is  reached  with  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance (MEF). The MPWT's capacity in relation to social and environmental safeguards will be \nfurther strengthened under the Project, and discussions with MEF have been held to streamline \nthe  disbursement  of  counterpart  funds.  The  MPWT's  dependence  on  consultants  was  high \nunder  earlier  loans,  especially  with  respect  to  procurement,  social  and  environmental  studies, \nand project performance monitoring. Enhancing the MPWT\u2019s capacity will be built into this loan \nby involving MPWT staff in all stages of project implementation. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nRegional Cooperation \n\n18. \nCambodia\u2019s  railway  is  a  strategic  element  of  the  GMS  transport  sector  strategy\u2019s \nsouthern  corridor  (footnote  3),  which  connects  Cambodia,  Thailand,  and  southern  Viet  Nam. \nThe corridor encompasses three road links and one railway link. The road links are the southern \nlink  from  Bangkok  in  Thailand,  along  the  coast  via  Kampot  in  Cambodia,  to  Nam  Can  in  Viet \nNam;  and  the  central  and  northern  links  are  from  Bangkok  to  Sisophon  in  Cambodia,  where \nthey split, with the northern link continuing via Siem Reap, Stung Treng, and Ratanakiri to Quy \nNhon in Viet Nam and the central route continuing via Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City and the \nport  of  Vung  Tau  in  Viet  Nam.  The  railway  link  generally  follows  the  central  road  route  from \nBangkok  to  Phnom  Penh,  where  it  ends.  The  governments  of  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam  are \nconsidering developing a new railway line from Phnom Penh via Kampong Cham in Cambodia \nand  Loc  Nech  in  Viet  Nam  to  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  The  section  in  Viet  Nam  is  included  in  the \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\ffor  railway \n\ninfrastructure  development, 11  with \nVietnamese  Government\u2019s  master  plan \nconstruction planned during 2011\u20132020 to support the development of mining resources around \nLoc  Ninh.  In  Cambodia,  the  Interministerial  SKRL  Committee,  chaired  by  the  deputy  prime \nminister, has been established to develop and coordinate the proposed new railway section in \nCambodia and is currently preparing a technical feasibility study. Implementation of the Project \nand  subsequent  construction  of  the  proposed  railway  line  between  Phnom  Penh  and  Ho  Chi \nMinh City in Viet Nam would complete the railway component of the GMS southern corridor and \nat  the  same  time  would  complete  the  SKRL,  which  is  a  long-term  development  priority  for  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. \n\n2. \n\nRestructuring the Railway \n\ninfrastructure  and  services.  Successful  examples  are \n\nThe  Government  has  previously  invited  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of \n19. \ntransport \ntoll-financed  road \nmaintenance concession for National Road 4 and the concession for developing and operating \nthe  country's  two  international  airports  in  Phnom  Penh  and  Siem  Reap.  The  ongoing \nrestructuring TA emphasizes transparency at all stages of the process of granting concessions \nby  establishing  an  adequate  regulatory  and  contractual  framework  for  the  concession, \nemploying  transparent  and  competitive  bidding  procedures  to  appoint  the  concessionaire, \nimplementing proper staff retention and replacement mechanisms, and providing adequate and \ntimely information on the process to the public. The restructuring process is intended to serve as \na model of best practice for future concessions in the country. \n\nthe \n\n20. \nThe  key  activities  of  the  ongoing  restructuring  TA  (footnote  10)  are  to  (i) plan  and \nprepare  restructuring  of  the  railway  subsector;  (ii) provide  advisory  services  to  assist  the \nGovernment with the formation of a PPP railway operator using internationally recognized best \npractices  for  international  competitive  bidding  among  interested  private  sector  consortia; \n(iii) advise  the  Government  on  the  choice  of  a  depository  authority  for  the  Government's \nholdings of railway land and infrastructure; (iv) advise the Government on the best approach for \nestablishing regulatory oversight of the railway subsector in terms of the regulatory regime, the \nscope  of  regulation,  and  the  structure  of  the  regulator;  (v) provide  TA  in  relation  to  the \nestablishment  of \nthe \nGovernment  on  how  best  to  handle  staff  retrenchment  in  a  transparent  and  fair  manner;  and \n(vii) document the process in sufficient detail to allow for future replication. The restructuring TA \nwas initiated in January 2006 for completion in July 2007. \n\nthe  depository  authority;  (vi) advise \n\ntransport  regulator  and \n\nthe \n\nThe Government approved the strategy and plan for restructuring developed under the \n21. \nrestructuring  TA  on  30  June  2006.  In  summary,  it  outlines  the  following  main  principles  for \nrestructuring and future operation of the railway: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Government will (a) rehabilitate the railway\u2019s infrastructure with support from \nADB and others, and (b) restructure the railway subsector. \nA new railway operating company will be established that is owned and operated \nby a private concessionaire. The railway operator will be granted exclusive rights \nto provide railway services under a concession agreement that will be protected \nby law. The Government will award the concession after international competitive \nbidding.  The  railway  operator  will  operate  commercially  and  will  be  free  to  set \nprices  and  service  levels.  If  the  Government  decides  that  non-commercial \npassenger  services  are  required  for  social  reasons  on  part  or  all  of  the  railway \ninfrastructure,  the  concession  agreement  shall  provide  how  this  public  service \n\n                                                 \n11 Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2002.

The  railway  operator  will  pay  a \nconcession fee to the Government for use of the railway\u2019s infrastructure. \nThe  Government  will  (a) prepare  and  present  a  railway  reform  law  for  approval \nby  Parliament;  (b) encourage  fair  modal  competition  by  enforcing  existing \nrestrictions on  road  vehicle  load limits;  (c) negotiate  a  new  cross-border  railway \ntransport  agreement  with  Thailand;  (d) create  and  maintain  a  dedicated  railway \nreform  Internet  web  site  to  promote  and  create  public  awareness  about  the \nrailway reform law, the railway operator concession, and the process of granting \nconcessions;  (e) establish  a  concession  management  unit  within  the  MPWT  to \nmanage  the  railway  operator  concession;  and  (f) undertake  to  monitor  the  PPP \nrailway  operator\u2019s  compliance  with  health,  safety,  labor,  and  environmental \nrequirements. \nThe Government will establish a property development entity and make available \nto it the right to rent and develop designated parcels of the RRC\u2019s land assets to \nensure  that  funds  are  available  to  meet  the  Government\u2019s  expenses  towards \nfinancing of the railway and its future expansion. Such land shall not be required \nfor  railway  operations  and  will  not  be  alienated  from  state  ownership.  The \nproperty  development  entity  shall  be  structured  in  accordance  with  principles  of \ngood  governance,  transparency,  and  accountability,  and  will  preferentially \ndedicate  its  net  revenues  to  provide  funding  for  public  service  obligations,  such \nas noncommercial passenger traffic, and for future capital works for the railway. \n\nThe principles of the strategy and plan for restructuring are summarized in a policy letter \n\n22. \nfrom the Government to ADB\u2019s President, dated 17 July 2006 (Appendix 5). \n\n23. \nThe  shortlisting  of  potential  bidders  to  undertake  the  railway  operator  concession  was \napproved  in  November  2006,  and  bids,  bid  evaluations,  and  concession  contract  negotiations \nare scheduled to be completed by late March 2007. Award of the concession is a condition for \nloan effectiveness. \n\n3. \n\nStaff Redundancy \n\n24. \nstaff in varying ways, namely: \n\nAs of February 2006, the RRC had 1,102 permanent staff. Restructuring will affect these \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe property holding entity that will manage railway land and infrastructure after \nthe  privatization  of  railway  operations  is  expected  to  require  about  30  RRC \nemployees  for  its  operations.  Their  service-related  benefits  are  expected  to \ncontinue without interruption.  \nThe new PPP railway operator is expected to hire about 630 RRC staff as new \nemployees. These employees will continue to enjoy employment income, but will \nlose  their  accumulated  service  benefits,  principally  those  associated  with \nemployment termination notices, indemnification payments, retirement pensions, \nand annual leave. \nOf  the  remaining  staff,  about  27  are  expected  to  retire  before  the  restructuring \nbecomes  effective,  leaving  about  375  redundant  staff  who  will  have  to  be \ntransferred  to  other  Government  employment,  find  new  employment  in  the \nprivate sector, or take early retirement. \n\nA  mitigation  plan  for  railway  staff  affected  by  the  restructuring  of  the  railway  subsector \n25. \nhas been prepared and was approved by the Government on 30 June 2006 (footnote 10). The \nmitigation  plan  provides  for  compensation,  counseling  and  retraining  of  redundant  staff,  and \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fcompensation  for  loss  of  pension  rights.  The  plan  will  be  implemented  under  the  proposed \nProject. \n\nD.  Project Investment Plan \n\n26. \nThe  Project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $73.0  million  (Table  1).

Interest  financing  charges  during  implementation  will  be  capitalized.  OFID  will \nprovide a loan of $13 million to jointly finance the civil works component with ADB.  The OFID \nloan will be administered by ADB.12 The Government of Malaysia will provide a grant in kind of \nreclaimed  rail  valued  at  about  $2.8  million  equivalent  (4%)  and  the  Government  will  finance \n$15.2 million equivalent (21%), comprising all costs of Project administration, taxes, clearance \nof  unexploded  ordnance,  compensation  of  railway  staff  in  connection  with  restructuring,  and \nresettlement  and  land  acquisition,  but  not  the  cost  of  associated  consultants,  which  will  be \nfinanced by ADB. The ADB loan will have a 32-year maturity, including, an 8-year grace period. \nInterest will be at 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year over the remaining \nterm  of  the  loan.  The  OFID  loan  will  be  repayable  over  20-years,  including  a  5-year  grace \nperiod,  with  a  fixed  interest  rate  of  1%  per  year  and  a  1%  fixed  service  charge  per  year.  The \nBorrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia.  \n\n                                                 \n12 OFID acknowledged the Government\u2019s request for cofinancing of $13 million in April 2006. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOPEC Fund for International Development \n\n(administered by the Asian Development Bank) \n\nTable 2: Project Financing Plan \nTotal \n($ million) \n42.0 \n\n \n\n \n\nPercentage of Total \nProject Costs \n\n13.0 \n2.8 \n15.2 \n73.0 \n\n57 \n\n18 \n4 \n21 \n100 \n\nGovernment of Malaysia (grant in kind) \nGovernment of Cambodia \n \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n28. \nThe  MPWT  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  Special  implementation \narrangements have been developed for the Project that take into account the fact that physical \nimplementation  of  the  rehabilitation  works  will  take  place  while  the  RRC,  which  has  the \nknowledge and experience for undertaking the envisaged rehabilitation works, is being divested \nof the functions of railway operation and maintenance in favor of a new PPP railway operator.13 \nA  project  implementation  team  that  was  set  up  within  the  MPWT  to  implement  the  project \npreparatory TA will be expanded with additional qualified technical, financial, and support staff \nfor  project  management  and  implementation.  The  team  will  be  responsible  for  Project \nimplementation,  including  handling  procurement,  withdrawing  loan  proceeds,  and  reporting  to \nADB. \n\n29. \nThe  National  Committee  for  the  Singapore\u2013Kunming  Railway  Project,  which  is  a  high-\nlevel committee to facilitate realization of the SKRL in Cambodia and is chaired by the deputy \nprime  minister,  will  act  as  the  steering  committee  for  the  Project.  Representatives  of  relevant \nlocal  governments  and  the  PPP  railway  operator  will  be  invited  to  committee  meetings  as \nnecessary. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation \n\n30. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years  for  completion  in  December  2009. \nExceptional floods in 2006 damaged parts of the Southern and Northern lines to the extent that \ntransportation  of  materials  and  equipment  for  the  Project\u2019s  civil  works  could  be  affected  and \nProject implementation could be delayed. To ensure timely project implementation, the Project\u2019s \ncivil  works  contract  will  require  the  contractor  to  complete  urgent  repairs  required  to  keep  the \nrailway  operational  within  the  first  3  months  of  contract  mobilization.  The  Government  has \nrequested,  and  ADB  has  approved,  the  use  of  retroactive  financing  up  to  $1.5  million  and \nadvance  procurement  to  enable  accelerated  recruitment  and  mobilization  of  the  supervision \nconsultant  prior  to  the  declaration  of  loan  effectiveness  in  March  or  April  2007  and  early \nselection and mobilization of civil works contractors. The Government has agreed to ensure that \nthe concession agreement with the PPP railway operator allows for temporary adjustment of the \ntrain  timetable  and  train  speed  limitations  as  required  to  ensure  that  civil  works  under  the \n\n                                                 \n13  For  the  same  reason,  during  the  selection  of  the  railway  operator,  bidders  will  be  advised  of  the  procedure  for \nimplementing  track  rehabilitation  and  rebuilding  bridges,  including  phasing,  requirements  for  track  possessions  \nand temporary slowdowns to facilitate the civil works. The procedures for implementation of the works have been \nincorporated into the preparatory documents for bidding of the concession. \n\n\fProject can be completed in accordance with the implementation schedule. The implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 7. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n31. \nThe  Procurement  financed  from  the  ADB  and  OFID  loans  will  be  done  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Civil works contracts will be procured through international \ncompetitive  bidding.  Contracts  for  supply  and  works  with  an  estimated  value  of  less  than  $1 \nmillion  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding  using  the Government\u2019s  standard \noperating procedures and procurement manual, which are acceptable to ADB. Supply and small \nworks contracts will use shopping for contracts with an estimated value of less than $100,000. \nThe procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n32. \nThe  Project  will  require  104  person-months  of  international  and  176  person-months  of \nnational  consultant  inputs.  The  MPWT  will  engage  an  international  consulting  firm  for \nconstruction  supervision,  quality  assurance,  environmental  supervision  and  monitoring, \nresettlement  supervision  and  monitoring,  socioeconomic  impact  assessment,  and  project \nperformance monitoring. All recruitment will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consulting  Services  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  and  simplified \ntechnical  proposals.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  supervision  consulting  services  are  in \nAppendix 9. \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nThe  Government  has  agreed  that  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy14 \n33. \nwill  be  included  in  the  Loan  Agreement  and  in  all  bidding  and  contract  documents  for  the \nProject.  The  Government  has  also  agreed  that  this  policy  will  apply  to  the  selection  of  the \nrailway operator and the implementation of the concession agreement. All contracts financed by \nADB  and  OFID  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  MPWT  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  Government  has \nagreed  to  establish  a  web  site  for  procurement  under  the  Project  to  enhance  transparency  by \npresenting  detailed  information  on  the  procurement  process,  bidders,  and  contract  awards  in \nEnglish and Khmer. This information will also be published on public notice boards at commune \ncenters and other public buildings in the project area. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nAll disbursements under the ADB and OFID loans will be carried out in accordance with \n\n34. \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001). \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n35. \nThe  MPWT  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project,  including  assets,  and  will \nhave such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in \naccordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The MPWT will, within 6 months of the \nend  of  each  fiscal  year,  submit  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Manila. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fstatements and the auditor's reports, in English, to ADB. The audit of the financial statements \nwill include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with \nrespect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  (ii)  an  assessment  of \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants  and  ADB\u2019s  project  management  requirements,  and  (iii)  an \nopinion on the use of the statement of expenditures procedure. \n\n36. \nThe  MPWT  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation by submitting quarterly progress reports, the form and content of which will be \nagreed  with  ADB.  The  MPWT  will  monitor  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation  schedule  and  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant  deviations  from  the \nschedule.  The  quarterly  report  will  include  basic  data  on  utilization  of  funds,  achievement  of \nimmediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation progress, land \nacquisition, resettlement progress, and major issues and problems. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion, the MPWT will submit a project completion report to ADB that will provide a detailed \nevaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs,  contractors\u2019  and  consultants\u2019  performance,  social  and \neconomic impact, economic rate of return, and other details as may be requested by ADB. \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n37. \nThe  MPWT  has  agreed  to  a  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  Project  performance  in \nrelation to its impacts, outcomes, outputs, and conditions. Sample indicators, to be reviewed at \nthe  start  of  project  implementation,  are  in  Appendix  10.  At  the  beginning  of  project \nimplementation,  the  MPWT  will  establish  baseline  and  target  values  for  the  indicators.  The \nindicators  will  be  measured  at  project  inception,  project  completion,  and  3  years  after  Project \ncompletion and compared with the baseline. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by \ngender.  Support  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  help  establish  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem will be provided as part of supervision consulting services. The main sources of data will \ninclude  (i) secondary  data  from  the  Borrower\u2019s  sources,  (ii) traffic  counts,  (iii) railway  statistics, \n(iv) shipper  and  passenger  surveys,  (v) traffic  accident  database,  (vi) producer  and  price \nsurveys,  and  (vii) trade  and  customs  statistics.  The  MPWT  shall  submit  a  report  to  ADB \nsummarizing  the  key  findings  of  monitoring  at  inception,  project  completion,  and  3  years  after \nproject completion. \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n38. \nIn addition to regular annual reviews by ADB staff, the Government and ADB will jointly \nundertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  in  about  mid-2008  to  assess  (i)  the  status  of \nimplementation, (ii) the design and construction standards, (iii) the performance of consultants \nand contractors, (iv) the impacts of the Project, (v) the progress of sector reform, (vi) the status \nof compliance with the covenants stipulated in the Loan Agreement, and (vii) the need for any \nchanges in the project scope or schedule to achieve the project\u2019s impact and objectives. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nThe Project\u2019s benefits and impacts were assessed along with potential risks associated \n39. \nwith  the  assumptions  made  in  the  project  design.  The  combined  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs, given the likelihood of the risks occurring. \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f40. \nSuccessful  restructuring  of  the  railway  subsector  would  transform  the  railway  into  a \ncommercially-oriented  transport  operator,  which  is  required  to  realize  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  in \nfull. Successful restructuring is a condition for loan effectiveness and has been agreed with the \nGovernment.  International  railway  operators  have  expressed  interest  in  bidding  for the  railway \noperator concession. This significantly decreases the risk that private sector participation will not \nproceed as intended. \n\nA. \n\nPolicy \n\nB. \n\nSocial \n\n41. \nThe  social  and  gender  strategy  set  out  in  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy  (Appendix  11)  includes  strategies  for  participatory  resettlement  activities,  social \nprotection  measures  for  affected  railway  employees,  Project-related  gender  issues  and \nHIV/AIDS  prevention.  The  socioeconomic  survey  indicates  that  the  Project  is  not  expected  to \nhave any specific impact on ethnic minority groups that differs from the impact on the majority \nKhmers.  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  is  not  triggered.  The  gender  strategy \nincludes capacity building for the MPWT, other relevant agencies, and leaders of those affected. \nIncreased  capacity  on  the  part  of  the  MPWT  and  those  affected  will  enable  effective \nimplementation  of  resettlement  and \nthe \nconstruction phase will include an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness program and will \ninvolve  women  leaders  and  youth  from  affected  households  in  squatter  settlements,  district \nwomen officials, and women health workers.  \n\nlivelihood  activities.  Capacity  building  during \n\nThe Project is formulated to minimize potential risks relating to involuntary resettlement; \n42. \nhowever, compensation, resettlement, and income restoration measures might not be delivered \nas  agreed,  thereby  impoverishing  those  affected  and  delaying  the  start  of  civil  works.  The \nreestablishment of railway traffic does not affect the transportation of goods across the border \nwith Thailand by pushcart and motorcycle, and therefore does not adversely impact the income \nof pushcart pullers and motorcycle drivers in Poipet. At the same time, increased transportation \nof  goods  in  the  border  area  would  improve  commerce  and  the  general  economy  in  the  area, \nwhich would generate new income-earning opportunities in the services sector and in informal \nsector  economic  activities.  Restructuring  of  the  railway  could  impoverish  laid-off  railway \nemployees, and the Project includes a mitigation program to address this. The MPWT will help \nprepare  and  implement  the  mitigation  program  with  assistance  from  international  and  national \nconsultants recruited under the Project. \n\nC. \n\nResettlement \n\n43. \nThe  Project  will  permanently  clear  a  7-meter  wide  corridor  of  impact  centered  on  the \nmiddle of the railway track. The corridor of impact is narrower than the railway\u2019s right-of-way to \nminimize immediate resettlement impacts. Estimates indicate that about 2,630 households15 will \nbe  affected  by  the  Project,  of  which  about  965  households  (about  4,150  people)  will  be \ndisplaced  and  about  1,660  households  (about  7,140  people)  will  experience  minor  impacts \ncaused by the loss of secondary structures (wells, fences, etc.) and trees. Four large structures \n(three  privately  owned  buildings  and  one  publicly  owned  building)  will  be  fully  or  partially \naffected. Displaced households and businesses face the risk of losing access to their sources of \n                                                 \n15 The number of households is equivalent to the number of project-affected people as defined in ADB\u2019s resettlement \npolicy,  where it is the number of affected household heads. The term household is used here to distinguish from \nthe  total  number  of  persons  affected,  which  is  the  total  number  of  people  living  and  working  in  the  affected \nhouseholds.  \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nincome if they are moved too far away from their current residence, thus resettlement sites have \nbeen identified close to current places of occupancy. Resettlement is most significant in Poipet, \non  the  border  with  Thailand,  where  large  numbers  of  people  have  settled  on  the  railway\u2019s \ncurrently unused land. About 635 households (about 2,730 people) will be displaced in Poipet, \nequivalent to 66% of total displacement. The area required for reconstructing the Poipet station \nhas been reduced from 6 hectares to 3 hectares to minimize displacement. \n\n44. \nIn  addition  to  clearing  structures  within  the  right-of-way,  bamboo  rail  transport \noperators16 are  currently  transporting  people  and  goods  along  the  railway  and  will  lose  their \nlivelihoods once  the  railway  has  been  rehabilitated.  Some  villages  along  the  railway  lack  road \naccess, thus the bamboo railway service is villagers\u2019 only means of access. In such places, the \nProject will compensate for the loss of bamboo railway services by establishing road access for \nlight  (motorcycle)  traffic  using  the  railway\u2019s  right-of-way.  A  census  of  bamboo  rail  transport \noperators  identified  a  total  of  189  operators,  12  of  whom  were  women.  For  more  than  half  of \nthese operators (102 men and 3 women), providing bamboo rail transport services is their main \nsource  of  income.  The  Project  will  provide  the  bamboo  rail  transport  operators  with  funds  to \nenable them to switch from rail to road transport providers. \n\n45. \nThe summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 12. The resettlement plan ensures that all \nthose  affected,  irrespective  of  their  tenure  status,  will  be  able  to  restore  or  improve  their \nsocioeconomic  conditions.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been  disclosed  to  affected  persons  by \nmeans  of  a  public  information  booklet  and  they  will  be  further  consulted  on  resettlement  site \noptions.  Following  detailed  project  design,  the  MWPT  will  update  and  implement  the \nresettlement  plan  with  guidance  from  the  Interministerial  Resettlement  Committee  under  MEF \nand assistance from international and national consultants recruited under the Project. \n\n46. \nThe Government has agreed that in the event that all or parts of the right-of-way outside \nthe corridor of impact would need to be cleared in the future, the resulting resettlement would be \nperformed according to the same standards as under the Project. \n\nD. \n\nFinancial \n\nThe financial analysis indicates that the Project will have a financial internal rate of return \n47. \nof about 10.2%, well above the real weighted average cost of capital of 4.1%. The Government \nwill establish a property development entity to  monetize the railway\u2019s landholdings that are no \nlonger needed for railway operations. The net revenues of the property development entity will \nthe  Government\u2019s  public  service  obligation  expenditures  associated  with \nunderwrite \nnoncommercial  passenger  traffic;  and  future  capital  expenditures  for  development  of  the \nrailway, notably, the possible future construction of a railway line to Viet Nam. The concession \nagreement  will  require  the  railway  operator  to  submit  annual  audited  accounts  and  operating \nstatistics that include performance indicators for monitoring by the Government and ADB for 5 \nyears following Project completion. The financial analysis is in Appendix 13. \n\n                                                 \n16  Bamboo railway services  are  provided  by means  of small,  motorized trolleys constructed and operated by small-\nscale private operators. The Project includes full mitigation for the operators as part of the resettlement plan and \nwill also establish access for light traffic along sections of the Northern Line,  where bamboo railway services are \ncurrently the only means of motorized access to some isolated communities without road access. Where needed, \nthe contractor\u2019s construction roads will be left in place after construction has been completed. \n\n\fE. \n\nEconomic \n\n48. \nThe  main  sources  of  benefits  are  associated  with  savings  from  the  diversion  of  heavy \nfreight  and  container  traffic  from  road  transport  to  more  economical  rail  transport  that  include \nreduced  costs  in  relation  to  road  maintenance  and  accidents.  The  traffic  forecast  is  based  on \nprojected  future  economic  growth  in  Cambodia  and  assumes  that  the  railway  will  capture  a \nsignificant  share  of  the  traffic  generated  by  three  new  cement  plants  that  are  currently  being \nplanned and constructed and of future container traffic to and from Sihanoukville. Projections of \ncontainer traffic on the Southern Line assume that the railway has direct access to the container \nport\u2019s  stacking  area  for  loading  and  offloading  containers.  Under  these  assumptions,  and \nassuming in the base case that economic growth is in line with Cambodia\u2019s recent performance, \nthe economic analysis indicates that the Project will have an economic internal rate of return of \nabout 24.9%. The economic analysis is in Appendix 14. \n\nF. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nThe railway alignment is outside environmentally sensitive areas such as national parks \n49. \nand  other  protected  areas  and  their  buffer  zones  and  the  proposed  Project  falls  into \nenvironmental category B. The MPWT will submit the initial environmental examination report to \nthe  Ministry  of  Environment  for  its  review  and  approval.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts \ncan be mitigated by proper engineering and environmental management measures, which have \nbeen  included  in  the  Project\u2019s  environment  management  plan  and  will  be  implemented  by  the \nMPWT  with  support  from  international  and  national  consultants.  The  Supplementary  Appendix \npresents the summary initial environmental examination. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the MPWT have given the \n\n50. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n1. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n2. \n\n(iv) \n\nDraft Railway Reform Law \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  to  present  a  draft  railway  reform  law  or \nequivalent  legislation  to  the  National  Assembly.  The  draft  law  will  follow  the \nprinciples outlined in the Government\u2019s Policy Letter issued to ADB and dated 17 \nJuly  2006.  The  Government  will  use  its  best  efforts  to  facilitate  passage  of  the \ndraft law before the end March 2007, by which time a concession agreement is \nanticipated  to  have  been  negotiated  for  private  sector  operation  of  the \nrestructured railway. \nThe Government will ensure that prior to enactment of the railway reform law (or \nequivalent legislation), it will not take any actions that would be inconsistent with \nthe principles described in the Policy Letter. \nThe  Government  will  establish  a  commercially  operated  railway  property \ndevelopment  entity.  This  entity\u2019s  net  revenues  will  ipreferentially  be  used  to \nsubsidize  public  service  obligation  railway  traffic,  such  as  noncommercial \npassenger  traffic,  and  for  development  of  the  railway  system,  such  as  the \npossible future construction of a new line to Viet Nam. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contracts  under  the  Project \nthe \nincorporate  provisions \n\nthat  contractors \n\n(a) comply  with \n\nto  ensure \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002), \nthe environmental management plan for the Project, and the initial environmental \nexamination;  (b) comply  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  Cambodia, \nincluding ratified international treaty obligations; (c) do not employ child labor and \nprovide safe working conditions for male and female workers; (d) do not provide \nmale and female workers with different wages or benefits for work of equal value; \n(e) implement  the  provisions  set  forth  in  the  gender  action  plan,  to  be  prepared \nfor  the  Project  to  operationalize  its  gender  strategy,  to  the  extent  that  it  is \napplicable  to  contractors;  and  (f) carry  out  training  programs  and  awareness \ncampaigns on HIV/AIDS and human trafficking at campsites and in communities \nalong  the  railway  lines.  The  MPWT  will  monitor  compliance  through  an \nindependent monitor. \n\nResettlement \n\n3. \n\n(v) \n\nThe Government will ensure that the MPWT updates the resettlement plan after \ndetailed  project  design  based  on  a  detailed  measurement  survey  of  losses \nfollowing  the  recruitment  and  mobilization  of  an  independent  monitoring  agency \nand of the resettlement supervision consultants. The update will be prepared in \nfull consultation with affected persons and will be disclosed to them. The updated \nresettlement  plan  for  any  section  of  the  railway  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for \nreview  and  approval  before  commencement  of  any  land  acquisition  and \nrelocation  activities  for  that  section.  The  MPWT  will  implement  the  approved, \nupdated  resettlement  plan \nlaws, \nregulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB's  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \nlaws, \n(1995). \nregulations, and procedures and ADB's policy, ADB's policy will prevail. \n\nthe  case  of  discrepancies  between \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthe  Government\u2019s \n\nthe  Government\u2019s \n\nIn \n\ninvoluntary  resettlement \n\nimpacts  cannot  be  avoided,  civil  works \ncontractors  will  not  be  issued  a  notice  of  possession  of  the  pertinent  section  of \nrailway  until  (a) the  satisfactory  completion  of  compensation  payments  and \nrelocation  to  new  sites  for  that  particular  section,  (b) the  agreed  rehabilitation \nassistance \nfrom  all \nencumbrances. \nThe Government will ensure that if people in the remaining right-of-way beyond \nthe corridor of impact are resettled in the future, the resettlement will be carried \nout in accordance with the standards established for this Project. \n\nthe  particular  section \n\nin  place,  and  (c) \n\nfree \n\nis \n\nis \n\n(vi)  Where \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that only land owned by the RRC as of the date of \nthe  property \nloan  effectiveness  will  be  considered \ndevelopment  entity.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  people  residing  on \nsuch  land  who  would  need  to  be  resettled  to  enable  development  are  resettled \nusing the standards of this Project.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  the  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for \nresettlement  to  meet  any  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  the  resettlement \nbudget estimates to satisfy resettlement requirements and objectives. \n\nfor  development  by \n\n(ix) \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n4. \n\n(x) \n\nThe  Government  will  comply  with,  and  will  cause  the  MPWT  to  comply  with, \nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  (footnote  14).

For each contract, the web site shall include \na list of participating bidders, the name of the winning bidder, the basic details of \nthe bidding procedures adopted, the amount of the contract awarded, and the list \nof goods and/or services procured. In addition to the web-based disclosure, the \npublic  shall  be  provided  with  detailed  information  about  procurement  on  public \nnotice boards (for example, at commune council facilities) in the Project area. \n\nto  disclose \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  (a) that  the  process  for  selecting  the  railway \noperator  and  execution  of  the  concession  agreement  are  subject  to  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy  (footnote  14),  specifically \nto \ninvestigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  selection  process  or  to  the \nimplementation  of  the  concession  agreement;  and  (b) that  the  concession \nagreement  includes  provisions  that no  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or coercive \npractices will be tolerated in connection with the agreement and that all parties to \nthe agreement will fully cooperate with any investigation into any alleged corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  and  shall  extend  all  necessary \nassistance,  including  providing  access  to  all  relevant  accounts    and  records  as \nmay be necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n\nincluding  ADB\u2019s  right \n\n5. \n\nGender Strategy  \n\n(xiv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  women,  in  particular,  those  who  belong  to \nwomen-headed  households  and  ethnic  minority  groups,  participate  to  an  extent \nsatisfactory to ADB in (a) public consultation meetings on resettlement planning; \n(b)  detailed  measurement  of  losses;  (c)  capacity-building  programs  relating  to \nresettlement;  and  (d)  relocation,  compensation,  and  livelihood  improvement \nactivities to be undertaken under the Project. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a) any  land  rights  granted  to  affected  people \nwill  be  issued  in  the  names  of  both  husband  and  wife;  (b) women  railway  staff \naffected  by  restructuring  are  included  in  counseling  and  retraining  programs  for \nsecuring  employment  opportunities;  and  (c) gender  sensitization  training  is \nundertaken,  particularly  in  the  context  of  resettlement,  for  pertinent  MPWT  staff \nand district resettlement committees, district officials, and commune leaders. \n\n(xv) \n\n6. \n\nProject Monitoring \n\n(xvi)  At the beginning of Project implementation, the MPWT will establish baseline and \ntarget  values  for  the  indicators  before  the  start  of  works.  The  indicators  shall \ninclude,  at  a  minimum,  information  on  railway  passenger  and  freight  traffic; \neffective  average  train  speed;  container  traffic;  traffic  accidents;  railway,  road, \nand sea transport costs; heavy traffic on the railway versus roads; and producer \nprices  as  a  share  of  the  value  of  exports.  The  indicators  shall  be  measured  at \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nproject  inception,  project  completion,  and  3  years  after  project  completion  and \ncompared  with  baseline  values.  Support  to  help  establish  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation  system  shall  be  provided  as  part  of  supervision  consulting  services. \nThe  main  sources  of  data  shall  include  (a) secondary  data  from  the  Borrower\u2019s \nsources,  (b) traffic  counts,  (c) railway  statistics,  (d) shipper  and  passenger \nsurveys,  (e) traffic  accident  database,  (f) producer  and  price  surveys,  and \n(g) trade  and  customs  statistics.

The  two  international  airports  (Phnom  Penh  and  Siem  Reap),  the  two \nmain ports (Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville), and the primary highway network will soon be fully \nrehabilitated and have adequate capacity. The railway is run down and needs to be rehabilitated \nand restructured to become an efficient alternative. Restructuring is ongoing and rehabilitation is \nexpected to start in 2007. \n\nNevertheless,  much  remains  to  be  done:  (i) most  provincial  and  rural  roads  are \n2. \nseasonally impassable to motorized traffic and await rehabilitation; (ii) inland water transport has \nprogressed slowly driven by the private sector, but such infrastructure as river ports needs to be \nupgraded  and  modernized  to  effectively  support  multimodal  transport;  (iii) domestic  airports \nrequire  repair  and  an  assured  financial  basis  to  provide  safe  operations;  (iv) traffic  regulation \nand enforcement is weak or nonexistent and lack a sound legal basis, although a draft road law \nhas been prepared with support from the World Bank; (v) infrastructure development is mostly \ndonor financed, but shortages of funds and a lack of efficient and transparent mechanisms for \nmaintenance  planning,  disbursement,  and  execution  hinder  its  subsequent  operation  and \nmaintenance;  and  (vii) transport  services  are  inefficient,  partly  because  of  poor  infrastructure \nand partly because of market failure and rent seeking. Solving these problems is a prerequisite \nfor continued economic and social development. \n\n3. \nThe  constraints  to  implementing  infrastructure  development  activities  are  (i) a  shortage \nof qualified and experienced professional staff that is only slowly abating, and (ii) a shortage of \nGovernment  funding  for  infrastructure  operation  and  maintenance.  There  is  scope  for  further \ninvolving  the  private  sector  as  a  source  of  financing  and  management  capacity  in  certain \ninfrastructure areas, notably, the railway and the sea and river ports and new terminal facilities \nsuch as container depots. In other areas, such as road infrastructure, private sector involvement \nis  not  currently  feasible  because  traffic  levels  are  generally  too  low  to  support  toll-financed \ninvestment  and  maintenance.  Widespread  private  sector  involvement  in  road  infrastructure \nprovision and maintenance will probably not be viable for at least a decade.1  \n\nThe  execution  of  safeguard  policies,  especially  resettlement,  compensation,  and \n4. \nrehabilitation of those adversely impacted, has improved significantly in recent years, but there \nis  still  room  for  further  improvement,  especially  the  establishment  of  a  firm  legal  basis  for \nresettlement,  compensation,  and  rehabilitation  and  of  consistent  implementation.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is providing technical assistance in this regard.2 \n\nInfrastructure  projects  have  had  little  induced  development  impact  in  terms  of  the \n\n5. \nemergence of national contractors, consulting engineers, and other service providers. \n\n                                                 \n1   The  complex  and  interlinked  issues  of  road  maintenance  funding,  planning,  disbursement,  and  execution  are \ndiscussed  extensively  in:  ADB.  2002.

Manila (TA 4490 CAM). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nB. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n6. \nThe primary tools of the Government's strategy since 1994 have been (i) to focus road \ninvestments on rehabilitating national highways and selected provincial, rural, and urban roads; \n(ii) to  undertake  comprehensive  privatization  of  transport  provision;  (iii)  to  selectively  relax \nrestrictive regulations, such as most restrictions on importing motor vehicles and all restrictions \non  access  by  foreign  airlines;  and  (iv) to  franchise  the  operation,  maintenance,  and \ndevelopment of National Road 4, the two international airports in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, \nand air traffic control to the private sector. The Government's strategy has proven successful in \nrestoring a core transport system that connects the country\u2019s main centers and has significantly \ncontributed to integrating the national economy with the regional and global economies. \n\nThe  Government  has  initiated  a  process  of  decentralization  and  reforms  whereby,  for \n7. \nexample,  the  delivery  of  transport  infrastructure  services,  which  was  previously  centrally \nmanaged  by  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT),  is  now  delegated  to  the \nprovincial  level.  The  MPWT  itself  is  in  the  process  of  shifting  its  focus  away  from  direct \nmanagement  of  transport  infrastructure  toward  planning  and  oversight  of  the  sector.  The \nprocess  is  moving  forward  with  significant  support  from  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, but is encumbered by shortages of the skills and resources \nrequired to undertake these new roles both in the provinces and centrally. The reform process is \nnecessary, but given the lack of capacity, is fraught with difficulty in the short term. An example \nis road maintenance, for which disbursement is now directly to the provinces, which, however, \nlack the ability to produce credible road maintenance plans and adequately justified budgets. As \na result, road maintenance is generally poor even though uncommitted funds are available. \n\n8. \nThe  MPWT  is  currently  preparing  a  revised  strategy  for  future  development  of  the \ntransport sector based on the Cambodia Transport Sector Strategy Study (footnote 3), financed \nby  ADB  and  completed  in  December  2002.  In  terms  of  transport  sector  development  and \noperation, the draft strategy is likely to emphasize the following objectives and goals: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nto \n\nimprove  Cambodia's \n\ninternational  competitiveness  and \n\nSupport  sustained  economic  growth  and  promote  external  trade  and \nforeign  direct  investment.  Transport  is  an  integral  part  of  the  production  of \nnearly  all  goods  and  services.  Good  transport  infrastructure  and  cost-effective \ntransport  is  a  precondition  for  Cambodia's  export  drive  and  for  successful \ndevelopment of its tourism potential, and is also a major factor in containing the \ncost  of  living  and  improving  rural  livelihoods.  Increased  diversity  in  transport \nsupply  and  improved  transport  logistics  using  multimodal  transport chains  are \nits \nneeded \nattractiveness to direct foreign investors. \nSupport  poverty  reduction  and  integration  of  the  country. By enabling new \nproductive  activities  in  areas  not  previously  open  to  economic  exchange, \ntransport  creates  the  foundations  for  more  inclusive  and  pro-poor  economic \ngrowth. Transport achieves this by providing cost-effective and reliable access to \neconomic  opportunities  and  social  services,  thereby  enabling  the  poor  to \nparticipate more fully in society. Accessible and dependable transport networks, \nespecially provincial roads, are needed to link the provinces and to integrate rural \nareas into the mainstream economy. \nStreamline  and  focus  sector  institutions  and  expand  private  sector \ninvolvement \ninfrastructure  provision.  The  Government  emphasizes \nstrengthening  sector  institutions,  especially  the  creation  of  clear  mandates  for \ntheir  activities,  as  the  basis  for  institutional  reform  and  strengthening.  The \nGovernment  recognizes  that  given  the  human  resources  constraint,  reform \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n23 \n\nrequires  flexibility  in  implementation  with  the  focus  on  efficiency,  transparency, \nand\u2014whenever  efficient\u2014reliance  on  the  private  sector.  In  the  past,  the \nGovernment has shown a readiness to involve foreign and domestic investors in \nthe  financing,  development,  and  management  of  transport  infrastructure.  The \nGovernment intends to pursue this avenue further, and also strongly supports the \ndevelopment of national contractors to undertake infrastructure construction and \nmaintenance services. \nSecure  the  sustainability  of  transport.  Fuel  taxation  is  a  major  source  of \nrevenue for the Government, and charging for the use of infrastructure has been \nintroduced in most subsectors, but with a few exceptions, the scope for charging \nfull user costs is limited by low traffic loads. As the scope for direct Government \nfunding  is  equally  limited,  meeting  the  funding  requirements  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  in  the  short  to  medium  term  will  require \nsupplementary funding from the private sector and development partners. \nImprove  safety  and  enforcement.

The following team composition is envisaged: \n\nrailway engineer and team leader;  \nrailway track engineer;  \ncivil construction engineer with expertise in bridges, structures, and soils; \nresettlement and restructuring impact mitigation specialist; \nenvironment specialist; and \nperformance monitoring specialist. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n41 \n\nA. \n\nMonitoring Framework \n\nBENEFIT MONITORING \n \n\n1. \nRehabilitation and restructuring of the railway would immediately benefit transport users \nby  providing  improved  railway  transport  services,  new  transport  services  such  as  multimodal \ntransport,  and  new  transport  routes.  In  the  medium  term,  the  increased  modal  diversity  would \n(i) provide  competition  to  existing  road  and  sea  transport  that  would  help  increase  their \nefficiency and reduce fares; (ii) reduce wear and tear on the highways, especially national roads \n3,  4,  and  5,  which  run  roughly  parallel  to  the  railway;  and  (iii) reduce  the  incidence  of  road \naccidents.  In  the  long  term,  reduced  costs  of  transport  would  improve  overall  economic \nefficiency  and  reduce  the  cost  of  living,  which  would  promote  increased  economic  activity, \nleading  to  additional  income  and  jobs.  The  monitoring  framework  and  monitoring  indicators  to \nmeasure these benefits are in Table A10.1. \n\nTable A10.1: Monitoring Framework: Indicators and Mechanisms \n \n\nTiming of Benefits or \nOutcomes \nImmediate \n\nImproved railway transport \n\nNew railway transport services \nNew railway transport routes \n \nShort Term (1\u20133 years) \n\n \n\nReduced transport costs \n\nReduced road maintenance \nrequirements \n\nImproved road safety \n\n \nLong Term (more than 3 years) \n\n \n\nImproved economic efficiency \n\nReduced cost of living \n\nMonitoring Indicators \n\nMonitoring Mechanism \n\n \nRailway passenger and freight \ntraffic \nEffective average train speed \nRailway container traffic \nRailway traffic to Thailand \n\nRailway statistics \n\nRoad transport charges on NRs \n3, 4, and 5 \nPort charges in Sihanoukville \nSea transport charges between \nBangkok and Cambodia \nShare of heavy traffic on NRs 3, \n4, and 5 \nShare of traffic casualties \nattributed to NRs 3, 4, and 5 \n\nShipper surveys \nPassenger surveys \nPublished port tariff for \nSihanoukville \n\nMPWT traffic counts \n\nMPWT accident database \n\nProducer prices as a share of the \nvalue of exports  \nProducer or import prices \n(including Cambodian taxes) as a \nshare of domestic market prices \n\nProducer surveys \nPrice surveys \nTrade and customs statistics \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMPWT = Ministry of Public Works and Transport, NR = national road. \n\n2. \nMonitoring of long-term benefits will focus on products moved by the railway, which are \nexpected  to  include  fuel,  cement,  and  containerized  cargoes  (especially  textiles  and  apparel). \nMonitoring will be implemented by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT). To the \nextent  available,  baseline  values  for  the  indicators  are  in  Table  A10.2,  and  will  be  further \nupdated  by  the  MPWT,  where  necessary.  The  MPWT  will  measure  the  indicators  for  project \nevaluation  at  project  inception,  completion,  and  annually  for  5  years  after  completion.  The \nMPWT  will  hire  an  independent,  qualified  institute  for  surveys,  analysis,  and  reporting.  The \npreliminary estimate for the cost of monitoring is $70,000.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nThe  total  population  of  Cambodia  is  approximately  13  million,  of  whom  about  one  third  live  in  poverty. \nMuch  of  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  was  destroyed  during  decades  of  civil  war  and  conflict,  and  its \nsocioeconomic  indicators  are  relatively  low.  Poverty  is  overwhelmingly  rural:  40\u201345%  of  people  in  rural \nareas  are  poor,  compared  with  10\u201315%  in  Phnom  Penh.  The  incidence  of  poverty  has  declined  only \nmodestly in recent years for a number of reasons, including a shortage of sources of growth and exclusion \nof the poor from the mainstream economy. \n \nImproving  Cambodia\u2019s  basic  infrastructure  is  critical  for  the  country\u2019s  economic  development,  and \nCambodia has started a process of infrastructure rehabilitation with support from its development partners. \nThe  Government-owned  railway  is  in  poor  physical  condition  because  of  war  damage  and  decades  of \ninsufficient  maintenance  and  investment  and  rail  traffic  is  declining  because  of  the  poor  condition  of  the \ntracks. As a result, the railway is generating operational deficits. The purpose of the Project is to restore \nefficient rail traffic by rehabilitating the existing railway line, reestablishing Cambodia\u2019s rail connection with \nThailand by replacing a section to the border that was destroyed, and restructuring the railway subsector. \nRehabilitation of the railway will foster efficient rail freight service. It is expected that the proposed Project \nwill facilitate economic growth by providing a cost-effective and efficient means of transporting goods, as \nan  efficient  transport  system  would  increase  trade  and  employment  opportunities.  The  Project  will  also \nfacilitate subregional trade and economic growth in Cambodia and Thailand.  \n \nB. \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nFollowing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (1999), projects classified \nas  general  interventions  no  longer  require  project-level  poverty  assessments.  The  resettlement  plan \nincludes compensation, resettlement, and livelihood restoration for households affected by land acquisition \nand displacement to restore and improve their incomes and living standards. Poverty in the vicinity of the \nproject could give rise to human trafficking, and an established network for human trafficking is known to \nexist in Poipet and on the Thai side of the border. Migrants into Poipet come primarily from Battambang, \nBanteay, Kampong Tom, Kandal, Meanchey, Prey Veng, and Siem Reap, and those who cannot find jobs \nbecome  easy  prey  for  the  human  traffickers.  Thus  the  Project  will  include  an  awareness  program  on \nhuman  trafficking  and  safe  migration. The  social  assessment  indicates  that  the  community  in  the  Poipet \narea has identified drug use as a problem. An HIV/AIDS awareness campaign will address the potential \nrisk of infection during the construction phase for both workers and communities. \n \nC. \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \n\n \nDuring  preparation  of  the  proposed  Project,  meetings  were  held  with  various  stakeholders,  government \nofficials,  and  member  of  affected  communities.  Rapid  social  appraisal  was  conducted  with  affected \ncommunities  to  discuss  Project-related  resettlement  issues.  In-depth  stakeholder  analysis  will  be \nconducted  with  members  of  affected  households,  business  owners,  and  government  officials  during \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  stakeholders\u2019  workshop  will  cover  issues  related  to \nresettlement site selection, compensation, relocation, land acquisition, etc. \n \n\n Yes\n No\n\n \n\n\f44 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n Yes\n No \n\nGender Development \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \n \n \nThe  resettlement  plan  will  include  a  number  of  steps  to  ensure  involvement  by  affected  households, \nbusiness owners, and government officials in resettlement committees at the district and commune levels. \nThe  consultation  process  for  resettlement  site  selection  and  land  acquisition  will  include  a  participatory \nstrategy for active participation by affected households and business owners. Capacity-building programs \nfor affected households will raise their awareness of resettlement issues and compensation so that those \naffected can negotiate fair compensation for losses of property, assets, businesses, etc. \n \n \nD. \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  gender  analysis  includes  households  affected  by  land  acquisition,  displacement,  loss  of \nbusiness,  and  railway  subsector  restructuring.  The  acquisition  of  land  in  Poipet  on  the  Cambodia\u2013Thai \nborder to reconstruct destroyed track will require the displacement of a large number of squatters living on \nrailway  land.  In  addition,  land  acquisition  will  be  required  for  the  Southern  and  Northern  lines.  Squatter \nhouseholds  living  on  railway  land,  including  women,  are  engaged  in  various  informal  sector  economic \nactivities. The men are mainly engaged in push cart pulling to transport goods and in providing motorbike \ntransportation for people traveling across the border. Men also work as a wage laborers. The women are \nengaged  in  petty  trading,  running  small restaurants  and  other small  enterprises  (such  as  beauty  salons, \ngrocery  shops,  and  tailoring  establishments),  and  piece  rate  work  for  garment  factories  and  provide  a \nsignificant portion of their households\u2019 income. As a result, in 90% of squatter households, women control \nthe  households\u2019  incomes  and  expenditures.  Half  of  squatter  households  belong  to  poor  and  vulnerable \ngroups, and their relocation will have a significant impact on their livelihood activities. Poor female-headed \nhouseholds  account  for  22.3%  of  affected  households.  In  addition,  the  restructuring  of  the  railway  will \naffect the job security of the railway\u2019s employees. As part of the restructuring, women railways employees \nmight lose their jobs. \n \nCommunities  in  the  project  sites  could  face  an  increased  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  because  of  the  influx  of \nconstruction  workers.  The  trafficking  of  girls  across  the  border  is  a  recognized  issue  in  Poipet.  An \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness program for the affected communities will be developed and \nimplemented  during  project  implementation.  Construction  contracts  will  include  community-based \nprevention programs for their workers.  \n \nIn the squatter settlements and in the affected communes and villages, separate consultation workshops \non resettlement planning related to resettlement sites, compensation, and improvement of livelihoods will \nbe  conducted  for  men  and  women  from  affected  households.  These  workshops  will  emphasize \nparticipation  by  women  from  female-headed  households  and  ethnic  minority  groups  (Vietnamese  and \nChinese  ethnic  groups  each  account  for  0.4%  of  those  affected)  to  identify  specific  issues  related  to \nwomen\u2019s income-earning activities that will be affected by relocation and land acquisition. \n \nBoth  men  and  women  from  affected  households  will  participate  in  discussions  of  the  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  of  losses,  the  district  resettlement  working  groups  will  include  district  women \nofficials,  and  the  commune-level  resettlement  committees  will  include  women  representatives  from \naffected households. \n \nDuring  the  inception  phase  of  the  Project,  a  capacity-building  program  on  resettlement  activities  will  be \ndesigned for women and men from affected households. Emphasis will be given to including trainees from \nfemale-headed  households  and  ethnic  minority  households.  The  training  will  include  commune-  and \ndistrict-level women officials and district and commune resettlement committee members. The objective of \nthe  training  is  to  provide  detailed  information  about  resettlement  activities,  such  as  proposed  sites, \nentitlements, livelihood strategies for income restoration or improvement, grievance procedures, etc. \n \nThe  relocation  of  squatters  in  the  resettlement  sites  will  take  into  account  women\u2019s  work  in  the  informal \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n45 \n\nsector.  The  compensation  plan  and  livelihood  restoration  or  improvement  strategies  will  ensure  that \nwomen can maintain their current income-earning activities and access to markets.  \n \nIn relation to relocation, compensation, and livelihood improvement activities, special consideration will be \ngiven to poor female-headed households and ethnic minority households.  \n \nThe resettlement plan will include joint registration of land rights in the names of both husbands and wives \nfor replacement land. \n \nWomen  railway  staff  affected  by  the  railway  restructuring  will  be  included  in  counseling  and  retraining \nprograms, vocational training, and so on as necessary for securing employment opportunities. \n \nSpecific  attention  will  be  paid  to  complaints  and  grievances  by  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor \nhouseholds.  \n \nThe HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness program will include women leaders and youth from the \naffected  households  from squatter  settlements,  district  women  officials,  and  women  health workers.  The \nprogram  will  be  coordinated  with  established  nongovernment  organization  programs  in  the  Poipet  and \nNorthern and Southern line areas of the Project. \n \nIn  line  with  the  Labor  Code  (1997),  all  employment  for  the  Project  will  conform  to    Government \ncommitments to gender equity, including the provision of equal pay and benefits for work of equal value. In \naddition, no child labor or trafficked labor will be used. \n \nMonitoring indicators disaggregated by gender and ethnic group will be developed to monitor resettlement \nactivities. \n \nGender  sensitization  training  will  be  provided  for  relevant  staff  from  the  executing  agency,  district \nresettlement working groups, and district women officials and commune leaders. \n \nA social development and gender specialist (national consultant) will be recruited for 8 months to prepare \na gender action plan to operationalize the gender strategy. The gender specialist will coordinate with the \nresettlement specialist to prepare the action plan. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n Yes \n No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nA full resettlement plan has been prepared \nA summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 12. \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the construction campsites, labor standards will be \nmaintained and basic facilities will be provided. \nEmployment will be provided for poor households affected \nby the Project. No trafficked labor or child labor will be \nused. Restructuring of the railway subsector will affect the \njob security of railway employees and a social protection \nprogram will address their deployment retraining. \nThe majority of affected households are Khmer. A small \nnumber of households are ethnic minority (0.4% \nVietnamese and 0.4% Chinese) The ethnic Vietnamese \nand Chinese live with the Khmer in mixed communities \nand are integrated in terms of employment, housing, \nschooling, etc. The social assessment indicates that the \nProject is not expected to have any specific impact on \nethnic minorities that differs from the impact on Khmers. \nTherefore, the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) is not triggered and an \nindigenous peoples development plan is not called for. \nHowever, specific activities for ethnic minorities are \nincluded in the resettlement plan and the gender strategy.  \nThe displacement of squatters could increase \nimpoverishment if resettlement activities are delayed \nand/or not implemented effectively. Vested interested \ngroups in the squatter settlement could affect effective \nimplementation of the compensation plan. Ongoing \nmonitoring of resettlement activities for the squatters will \nbe emphasized during implementation. The capacity \nbuilding program and resettlement awareness-raising \nworkshop would minimize some of the risks. \n\n46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n \nE. \n\nItem \n \nResettlement \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n47 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nA. \n \nTo  minimize  the  impacts  of  resettlement,  the  corridor  of  impact 1 established  for  the \n1. \nrehabilitation  of  the  entire  railway  line  is  3.5  meters  on  either  side  of  the  track  centerline.2 In \naddition,  the  area  required  for  the  station  in  Poipet  has  been  reduced  from  6  hectares  to  3 \nhectares. \n \n2. \nAbout  2,629  people  will  be  affected  by  the  railway  rehabilitation  as  follows:  (i)  965 \nhouseholds whose structures will be affected, of which 822 households will be severely affected \nand  143  households  will  be  marginally  affected  and  all  of  whom  may  be  physically  displaced \nbecause  of  impacts  on  their  houses  and/or  shops;  (ii)  1,660  households  who  will  experience \nminor impacts from the loss of secondary structures (wells, fences, etc.) and trees, and whose \nmain  place  of  residence  or  business  will  not  be  affected;  (iii)  3  privately-owned  permanent \nbusinesses  structures  and  one  public  owned  building  will  be  disrupted  because  of  impacts  on \nstructures and may require relocation. \n\n3. \nIn addition, bamboo rail transport operators will lose their source of livelihood once the \nrailway  lines  have  been  rehabilitated.  Currently  189  operators  are  operating  along  the  entire \nline.  \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework, Principles, and Entitlements \n\n4. \nThe legal and policy framework for compensation and resettlement under the Project is \ndefined  by  the  relevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  of  Cambodia  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) policies on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), Indigenous Peoples \n(1998),  Gender  and  Development  (2006),  Accountability  Mechanism  (2003),  and  Public \nCommunications  (2005).  In  the  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Government\u2019s  laws, \nregulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB's  policies  and  requirements,  ADB's  policies  and \nrequirements will prevail. \n\n5. \nAs none of the affected persons identified within the railway corridor of impact and living \ninside  railway  stations  have  legal  documents  to  indicate  rights  to  occupancy,  the  Government \nviews  them  as  illegal  settlers  or  squatters,  and  they  cannot be  compensated  for  the  land  they \nare  currently  occupying.  However,  their  lack  of  legal  status  does  not  bar  them  from  receiving \nproject  entitlements,  and  the  Project  will  ensure  that  all  affected  persons,  irrespective  of  their \ntenure status, will be assisted to restore or improve their preproject socioeconomic conditions. \n\n1. \n\nIncome Restoration and Resettlement Strategy \n\nThe relocation of people away from the railway would affect their incomes if they have to \n6. \nmove away from their current sources of livelihood, thus relocation will be minimized. Affected \npersons  that  have  to  relocate  will  participate  in  identifying  and  selecting  options  with \nGovernment  assistance  (i)  to  reorganize  themselves  within  the  remaining  right-of-way  so  that \nthey  can  continue  their  businesses  or  employment  for  at  least  the  next  5  years;  (ii)  to  move \noutside  the  right-of-way  to  either  group  or  individual  relocation  sites  close  to  (5  kilometers  or \nless)  their  current  locations  so  that  their  incomes  will  not  be  affected;  or  (iii)  to  receive  cash \n\n                                                 \n1   This is the area within the right-of-way that will be permanently cleared for the Project. \n2   Government Order No. 6, dated 27 September 1999, sets the right-of-way for railway lines to 20 meters each side \nof the centerline of the track in densely populated areas, 30 meters each side of the centerline outside cities, and \n100 meters each side of the centerline for mountainous areas where there are rock falls or tall forests. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nassistance for the loss of land use and make their own arrangements for relocation. Community \nmeetings  held  in  June  2006  indicate  that  a  number  of  affected  persons  are  open  to  being \nrelocated off-site for an opportunity to own land of their own. Possible suitable replacement sites \n(privately-owned  open  land)  were  identified  during  the  planning  process.  These  sites  will  be \nfurther explored and finalized during project planning in consultation with the affected persons. \nBamboo rail transport operators will have to give up their operations upon the commencement \nof  railway  civil  works,  but  will  be  helped  to  develop  other  means  of  transport  for  making \ncomparable incomes. Thus income levels will generally be maintained or restored. \n\n2. \n\nParticipation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n\n7. \nConsultations, public meetings, and village discussions with affected persons and local \nofficials were carried out during the resettlement planning process. These activities will continue \nduring  updating  of  the  Resettlement  Plan  and  implementation  and  will  follow  the  Project\u2019s \nparticipatory  approach.  A  public  information  booklet  has  been  finalized  and  translated  into \nKhmer  and  will  be  distributed  to  affected  persons  and  posted  in  commune  offices  before  the \nADB Staff Review Committee meeting. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) will \nbe responsible for disclosing the draft and final resettlement plans to the affected persons. ADB \nwill  include  the  draft  and  final  resettlement  plans  on  its  resettlement  web  site.  A  grievance \nmechanism  has  been  designed  to  ensure  that  affected  persons\u2019  concerns  and  grievances  are \naddressed and resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. Affected persons will be made fully \naware of their rights verbally and in writing during consultation. ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism \n(2003)  Policy  field  guide  has  been  translated  into  Khmer  and  will  be  distributed  to  affected \npersons together with the public information booklet. \n\n3. \n\nEthnic Minorities and Gender Strategy \n\n8. \nThe Project does not expect to have specific impacts on ethnic minority groups and does \nnot require the preparation of an ethnic minority development plan. However, the resettlement \nplan  and  the  gender  strategy  do  include  specific  actions  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  and \nenhance the ability of the few ethnic minorities (Chinese and Vietnamese) and other vulnerable \ngroups  to  benefit  from  the  project  interventions.  A  gender  strategy  is  included  in  the \nresettlement  plan  to  enhance  opportunities  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  all  aspects  of  the \nProject, from planning to implementation; participate in the decision-making process; and take \nadvantage  of  new  employment  and  income-generating  opportunities.  The  project  supervision \nconsultants  and  the  independent  monitoring  organization  will  ensure  that  they  or  members  of \ntheir teams have experience in preparing and implementing gender and development programs \nin Cambodia, the necessary gender perspective and experience to deal with vulnerable groups, \nand female staff. \n\nC. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Implementation Schedule \n\n9. \nThe  MPWT,  under  the  guidance  of  the  Interministerial  Resettlement  Committee  of  the \nMinistry of  Economy and Finance, will be responsible for updating, implementing, and internal \nmonitoring  of  resettlement  activities  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  requirements. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  for  the  purposes  of  both  supervision  and  capacity  building  to \nensure  the  effective  updating  and  implementation  of  resettlement  activities.  The  project \nsupervision  consultants  will  consist  of  one  international  resettlement  specialist,  one  national \nresettlement specialist, and one national gender specialist. \n\n10. \nThe  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  on  a  section-by-section  basis  following  detailed \ndesign.  It  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  persons  prior  to  submission  to  ADB  for  review  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n49 \n\napproval.  In  instances where  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  called  for,  the  civil  works \ncontractors will be issued a notice of possession of sites only after the project implementation \nteam, together with the Project\u2019s resettlement consultants, has confirmed that the area will not \ncause  any  resettlement  impacts  and  that  the  land  is  free  of  any  encumbrances,  disputes,  or \ncontroversies.  Where  resettlement  impacts  cannot  be  avoided,  civil  works  contractors  will  be \nissued  a  notice  of  possession  only  after  (i)  the  compensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new \nsites  have  been  satisfactorily  completed  in  that  particular  section  of  railway,  (ii)  the  agreed \nrehabilitation assistance is in place, and (iii) the particular section is free from all encumbrances. \nLand acquisition, compensation, and relocation of affected persons cannot commence until ADB \nhas  approved  the  updated  resettlement  plan.  To  ensure  that  temporary  impacts  during \nconstruction will be minimized if they cannot be avoided, the civil works contracts will have the \nfollowing  requirements:  (i)  the  contractor  will  pay  rent  for  any  land  required  for  construction \nworking  space,  (ii)  the  contractor  will  employ  unused  land  for  working  space  to  the  extent \npossible  to  avoid  disruptions  to  households  and  business  establishments  and  the  use  of \nresidential  land  will  not  require  any  impacts  on  houses  and  structures  and  will  not  disrupt \nhouseholds\u2019  access,  and  (iii)  the  land  that  has  been  used  temporarily  will  be  restored  to  its \npreproject condition or improved. \n\n1. \n\nMonitoring \n\nThe MPWT will be responsible for internal monitoring of resettlement activities. Progress \n11. \nreports will be submitted to ADB on a quarterly basis. An independent monitoring agency will be \nidentified,  recruited,  and  mobilized  before  the  commencement  of  any  resettlement  activities, \nincluding  the  detailed  measurement  survey  of  losses.  The  agency  will  be  required  to  submit \nperiodic reports on the progress of implementation and make any necessary recommendations \nregarding issues identified. \n\n2. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n12. \nOn-site relocation is estimated to cost $2.8 million and off-site relocation is estimated to \ncost $3.8 million. This includes compensation and allowances to affected persons, development \nof  resettlement  sites,  income  restoration  programs,  operational  and  administration  expenses, \ninternal and external monitoring, and contingencies. The costs are estimates and may change \nupon  completion  of  the  detailed  measurement  survey  to  determine  actual  impacts.  The \nGovernment will ensure timely provision of counterpart funds for resettlement and will meet any \nunforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  the  resettlement  plan  budget  estimates  to  satisfy \nresettlement objectives. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\n1. \nThe financial statements for the Project were prepared in current terms for a period of 30 \nyears.  Rehabilitation  of  the  railways  will  be  completed  in  December  2009.  The  foreign  and \ndomestic  inflation  rates  are  assumed  to  be  2%  and  4%,  respectively,  during  the  projection \nperiod. \n \n2. \nRailway traffic was forecast within the context of a medium economic growth scenario of \n3.5% per year from 2006 to 2020 and 5.0% per year from 2020. The forecasting methodology \nincluded a review of historical patterns of container and freight traffic (particularly of cement and \npetroleum  products),  with  distinctions  made  between  the  Northern  and  Southern  lines,  and  a \nreview of competition from improving road conditions (such as completion of the rehabilitation of \nNational Road 5). \n \n3. \nSome of the enabling conditions for increased rail traffic are assumed as follows: (i) the \nrehabilitation  of  both  the  Northern  and  Southern  lines  and  the  reconstruction  of  the  Poipet \ndestroyed  link  are  completed  in  2009;  (ii)  a  commercial  public\u2013private  partnership  railway \noperator will be in position to offer reliable and efficient services; (iii) the new cement factory in \nKampot province will start operations in 2009 at the latest, initiating local cement production to \nbe  distributed  in  the  domestic  market,  and  thereby  modifying  the  transportation  pattern  of \ncement in Cambodia;  and (iv) the cross-border agreement between Thailand and Cambodia is \nsigned and in effect when the railway in Cambodia is reconnected to that in Thailand. \n \n4. \nThe  underlying  assumptions  considered  in  relation  to  the  development  of  new  freight \nrates  are  (i)  when  trucking  and  railway  services  are  in  competition,  total  transport  costs  using \nrailway services should be 20% cheaper (i.e., rail tariff rates are 80% of the alternative cost of \nusing roads); and (ii) freight rates along the Northern Line should be close to the rates charged \nby the State Railway of Thailand.

Restructuring  the  Railway  in  Cambodia:  Traffic  Forecast  and  Financial \nAnalysis Report. Montreal, Canada. \n \nTwenty-one  percent  of  the  Project\u2019s  costs  will  be  funded  by  the  Government  of \n5. \nCambodia, 4% by a grant for rails (in kind) from the Government of Malaysia, and the balance of \n75% through concessionary foreign-denominated loans from the Asian Development Bank and \nthe OPEC Fund for International Development. The Asian Development Bank loan will have a \n32-year maturity, including, an 8-year grace period. Interest will be at 1.0% per year during the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  per  year  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  loan.  The  OPEC  Fund  for \nInternational  Development  loan  will be  repayable  over  a  20-year  maturity  tenor,  including  a  5-\nyear grace period, a fixed interest rate of 1.0%, and a 1.0% fixed service charge. \n \n6. \nAll financial analysis calculations are in real terms, based on mid-2006 prices, and cover \nthe period 2007\u20132036. Capital costs include all incremental capital expenditures related to the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nrehabilitation  of  the  railway,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction. \nThe analysis and financial projections were carried out on an incremental consolidated basis. \n \n7. \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  the  Project,  after  taxes  in \nreal  terms,  was  calculated  using  the  respective  weighted  cost  of  funds.  The  cost  of  debt  has \nbeen  adjusted  to  reflect  the  impact  of  the  corporate  profit  tax  of  20%.  The  nominal  cost  of \nfunding  is  converted  to  the  real  cost  by  applying  domestic  and  international  average  inflation \nrates for local currency and foreign currency funding, respectively. \n \n8. \nThe  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  is  financially  viable.  The  real  after-tax  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  10.2  %.  The  FIRR  compares  favorably  to  the  real  after-tax \nWACC of 4.1%. The estimated net present value of the net cash flows using the WACC as the \nhurdle rate is $65.7 million. Sensitivity analysis shows that the Project remains robust when run-\non scenarios, such as a 1-year delay in commencing operations, a 10% increase in investment \ncosts,  and  a  10%  increase  in  operating  costs,  are  applied.  The  FIRR  calculation  was  most \nsensitive  to  a  10%  increase  in  operating  costs,  which  resulted  in  an  estimated  FIRR  of  6.5%. \nEven  if  the  foregoing  sensitivity  scenarios  are  all  combined,  the  FIRR  remains  at  5.4%, \nremaining above the WACC of 4.1%. The FIRR and net present value calculations (base case) \nare shown in Table A13.2 and a summary of sensitivity scenario impacts is in Table A13.3. \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nTable A13.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return \n($ \u2019000) \n \nOperating \nPayments \n3,274 \n3,583 \n6,053 \n11,572 \n14,260 \n17,149 \n20,170 \n23,041 \n26,001 \n27,755 \n30,295 \n33,203 \n34,971 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n37,586 \n\nInvestment \n10,392 \n34,640 \n24,248 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nReceipts \n4,080 \n4,523 \n7,331 \n15,947 \n19,670 \n22,639 \n26,334 \n29,641 \n33,145 \n35,630 \n38,341 \n41,098 \n43,911 \n46,638 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n48,821 \n\nYear \n  1 \n  2 \n  3 \n  4 \n  5 \n  6 \n  7 \n  8 \n  9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \nFinancial Internal \nRate of Return \n( ) = negative value. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNet Cash Flow \n(9,586) \n(33,700) \n(22,970) \n4,375 \n5,410 \n5,490 \n6,164 \n6,600 \n7,144 \n7,875 \n8,046 \n7,895 \n8,940 \n9,052 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n11,235 \n\n10.2% \n\n \nTable A13.3: Sensitivity Analysis of the Financial Internal Rate of Return and Net Present \nValue \n \n\nScenario \nBase Case \n10% Increase in Capital Costs \n1-Year Delay \n10% Increase in Operating Costs \nCombination of Above Scenarios \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of \nReturn \n(%) \n10.2 \n9.3 \n9.7 \n6.5 \n5.4 \n\nNet Present Value \n($\u2019000) \n65,653 \n59,311 \n58,642 \n22,446 \n12,014 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n53 \n\n1. \nThe  economic  analysis  establishes  the  net  benefits  flowing  from  the  Project  by \ncomparing cost and benefits with and without rehabilitation of the existing railway network and \nrestoration  of  the  railway  connection  with  Thailand.  The  analysis  is  based  on  the  demand \nforecast  and  economic  analysis  developed  by  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(footnote  9)  and  assumes  that  the  railway  is  restructured.  The  Project  has  three  main \ncomponents:  rehabilitation  of  the  Southern  Line  between  Phnom  Penh  and  Sihanoukville, \nrehabilitation of the currently operating section of the Northern Line between Phnom Penh and \nSisophon, and reconstruction of the currently nonoperating destroyed link of the Northern Line \nbetween  Sisophon  and  Poipet  on  the  border  with  Thailand.  The  two  sections  of  the  Northern \nLine are treated as one in the economic analysis, as neither would be viable without the other. \n\nShadow prices have been applied at border prices1 for all tradable items, such as rolling \n2. \nstock,  track,  construction  materials,  and  maintenance  equipment,  and  at  resource  cost  for \nnontradable  items,  such  as  labor.  All  prices  are  fixed  at  their  2006  levels.  The  without  project \ncase  against  which  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  and  costs  are  measured  is  defined  as  the  no \ninvestment  case  and  involves  the  gradual  rundown  of  the  railway\u2019s  infrastructure  and  the \nimposition  of  increasingly  more  severe  speed  restrictions.  This  would  lead  to  an  accelerated \ndiversion of traffic to road transport and to the eventual inoperability of the railway. Specifically, \nit  is  forecast  that  freight  services  on  the  Northern  Line  would  cease  by  2015  and  on  the \nSouthern  Line  by  2020.  The  remaining  passenger  service  is  expected  to  decline  much  more \nrapidly,  given  that  railway  passenger  volumes  have  been  falling  at  an  average  rate  of  nearly \n27%  per  year  since  1998.  Accordingly,  it  is  assumed  that  without  the  Project,  passenger \nservices would cease by the end of 2010. \n\nB. \n\nTraffic Demand Forecast \n\n3. \nThe  forecasts  for  future  railway  traffic  are  in  Table  A14.1,  which  provides  independent \nforecasts  for  principal  freight  types  and  for  passengers  distributed  by  railway  line.  Two \nalternative growth scenarios are considered: the without project case, for which negative growth \nis expected, reflecting progressive deterioration of the railway, and the with project case, which \nassumes  moderate  (3.5\u20145.0%)  economic  growth.  The  with  project  scenario  assumes  that \nfuture economic growth in Cambodia will be at a level comparable to that experienced in recent \nyears.  The  with  project  traffic  forecasts  take  into  account  (i) container  traffic  diverting  to  the \nrailway from road and sea transport; and (ii) changes in the transport patterns for cement when \nthree new cement plants in Kampot province (one planned and two under construction) become \noperational, which is expected to occur in 2008 or 2009. \n\n                                                 \n1  Consisting  of  cargo  value,  insurance  during  transport,  and  cost  of  freight  transport  to  the  Cambodian  border, \n\nreferred to as the cargo, insurance, and freight price. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \nRailway \nLine and \nCase \nSouthern \nLine without \nProject \n\nSouthern \nLine with \nProject \n\nNorthern \nLine without \nProject \n\nNorthern \nLine with \nProject \n\nTable A14.1  Traffic Forecast , Selected Years \n(million ton-km or passenger-km)  \n\nType of \nTraffic \n\nCement \nPetroleum \nContainers \nTotal freight \nPassengers \nCementa \nPetroleum \nContainers \nTotal freight \nPassengers \nCement \nPetroleum \nContainers \nTotal freight \nPassengers \nCement \nPetroleum \nContainers \nTotal freight \nPassengers \n\nCur-\nrent \n2006 \n10.8 \n18.5 \n0.0 \n29.3 \n0.0 \n10.8 \n18.5 \n0 \n29.3 \n0 \n88.3 \n2.8 \n0.0 \n91.2 \n3.5 \n88.3 \n2.8 \n0.0 \n91.2 \n3.5 \n\nConstruction Period \n\nBenefit Period \n\n2007 \n9.2 \n19.2 \n0.0 \n28.5 \n0.0 \n41.6 \n19.2 \n0 \n60.8 \n0 \n83.4 \n2.9 \n0.0 \n86.4 \n2.3 \n75.84 \n2.9 \n0.0 \n78.7 \n2.3 \n\n2008 \n6.7 \n20.0 \n0.0 \n26.7 \n0.0 \n165.4 \n25.3 \n0 \n190.7 \n0 \n74.4 \n3.1 \n0.0 \n77.4 \n1.4 \n9.96 \n3.1 \n0.0 \n13.1 \n1.4 \n\n2009 \n4.9 \n20.8 \n0.0 \n25.7 \n0.0 \n316.4 \n39.6 \n0 \n355.9 \n0 \n63.7 \n3.2 \n0.0 \n66.9 \n0.8 \n2.14 \n3.2 \n0.0 \n5.3 \n0.8 \n\n2010 \n1.5 \n19.7 \n0.0 \n21.2 \n0.0 \n393.4 \n50.4 \n52.9 \n496.7 \n6.2 \n51.1 \n3.3 \n0.0 \n54.4 \n0.5 \n1.97 \n8.4 \n72.2 \n82.6 \n12.1 \n\n2015 \n1.5 \n23.9 \n0.0 \n25.4 \n0.0 \n541.5 \n63.2 \n133.2 \n737.9 \n21.3 \n0.0 \n3.5 \n0.0 \n3.5 \n0.0 \n2.28 \n11.6 \n115.5 \n129.4 \n55.4 \n\n2020 \n2030 \n0.9 \n0.0 \n32.7 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n33.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n699.1 \n874.2 \n98.2 \n119.5 \n244.5 \n155.7 \n953.0  1238.2 \n97.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n51.18 \n19.4 \n301.0 \n371.6 \n236.0 \n\n37.3 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n14.82 \n15.9 \n184.8 \n215.5 \n92.2 \n\na  Also includes coal, gypsum, and other imported inputs for cement production that are transported by rail. \nSource:  JARTS,  Nippon  Koei  Co.

Wages are considered \nto be market determined, and so do not require shadow price adjustment. Similarly, the costs of \nresettlement and compensation are assumed to represent fair market value and are not shadow \nprice adjusted. Based on the split between materials and labor costs in the detailed construction \ncost  estimate,  weighted  shadow  pricing  factors  have  been  estimated  for  each  project \ncomponent  as  follows:  the  Southern  Line,  0.77;  the  Northern  Line  not  including  the  destroyed \nlink, 0.85; and the destroyed link, 0.79.

The estimated economic prices \nof acquiring and maintaining rolling stock are shown in Table A17.3. Investments requirements \nfor locomotives and rolling stock are estimated explicitly by forecasting fleet requirements from \nforecast  traffic  volumes.  Independent  forecasts  were  prepared  for  the  Southern  and  Northern \nlines  based  on  the  assumed  annual  traffic  capability  per  wagon,  which  reflects  the  payload  of \nthe  equipment  and  its  average  cycle  times  on  the  respective  railway  lines.  Improved \nmanagement  practices  are  assumed  to  improve  future  equipment  utilization  rates  compared \nwith  the  current  situation.  Existing  operable  rolling  stock  has  been  deducted  from  gross  fleet \nrequirements  to  arrive  at  net  investment  requirements.  The  acquisition  of  locomotives  and \nwagons  is  phased  in  line  with  traffic  growth.  Asset  lives  are  assumed  to  be  25  years  for \nlocomotives and 20 years for wagons.  \n\n \nTable A14.3:  Acquisition and Annual Maintenance Costs  \nfor Locomotives and Rolling Stock  \n(economic cost in $/unit) \n \nCargo, Insurance, and Freight \nBorder Price \n1,000,000 \n 350,000 \n 40,000 \n 40,000 \n 60,000 \n\nItem \nLocomotive \nPassenger Coach \nContainer Flat Wagon \nCement Hopper \nPetroleum Tanker Wagon \nSource:  JARTS,  Nippon  Koei  Co.

Phnom Penh. \n\n8. \nOther benefits arising from the diversion of heavy traffic from road to rail that have been \nevaluated  are  (i)  reduced  fuel  consumption,  because  railway  traffic  is  more  fuel-efficient  than \nroad  traffic,  resulting  in  savings  in  carbon  dioxide  emissions  (the  value  of  reduced  emissions \nhas been estimated from the prevailing price of carbon certificates in the world market and the \nbenefits from Project-related emissions savings account for about 3% of total project benefits); \n(ii) reduced  costs  of  future  road  maintenance,  which  account  for  about  4%  of  total  project \nbenefits;  and  (iii) reduced  incidence  of  road  accidents, 2 which  accounts  for  about  3%  of  total \nproject benefits. Offsetting increases in railway accident costs resulting from increased railway \ntraffic are considered negligible and were not estimated. \n\n9. \nSavings  in  travel  times  and  inventory  costs  are  ignored  for  the  following  reasons: \n(i) current railway users would experience a significant improvement in speed, but their share of \ntotal  transport  is  marginal,  and  the  corresponding  savings  are  therefore  negligible;  (ii) new \nrailway  users  switching  from  road  transport  would  not  experience  an  improvement  in  speed, \nbecause  the  rehabilitated  railway  will  offer  travel  speeds  that  are  generally  slower,  or  at  best \nequal to, road speeds; and (iii) existing road users who continue to use road transport following \nrehabilitation  of  the  railway  will  not  experience  a  major  improvement  in  speed,  because  road \ntraffic generally is light in Cambodia, thus a reduction in road traffic resulting from a diversion of \ntraffic to the railway will have little or no impact on average road travel speeds. \n\nE. \n\nResults \n\n10. \nSummary  results  of  the  economic  analysis  are  in  Table  A14.6.  Two  cases  are \nconsidered: with and without future passenger services. The estimated economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  is  25.8%  without  passenger  services  and  slightly  lower,  24.9%, \nwith passenger services. These results reflect that passenger services are economically viable \non  the  Northern  Line  only.  The  EIRR  for  the  Southern  Line  is  higher  than  total  project  returns \nwhile the EIRR for the Northern Line is lower but still well above the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \ncutoff rate of 12%. The detailed economic cash flow calculations are in Table A14.7. \n\n                                                 \n2   Based  on  a  road  safety  database  developed  by  Handicap  International  in  cooperation  with  the  Ministry  of  Public \n\nWorks and Transport. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTable A14.6: Project EIRRs with and without Passenger Traffic  \n(%) \n \n\n \nCase \nProject with Passenger Traffic \nProject without Passenger Traffic \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource:  JARTS,  Nippon  Koei  Co.

Phnom Penh. \n \n\n12. \nThe  Project  has  been  subjected  to  risk  analysis  involving  all  the  variables  tested  in  the \nsensitivity analysis. The risk analysis shows about 96% probability that the project will achieve an \nEIRR of 12% or more. \n\n13.  Measures  to  avoid  or  limit  loss  of  potential  economic  benefits  are  integral  to  the  project \ndesign  and  the  implementation  schedule:  (i) restructuring  of  the  railway  and  introduction  of  a \ncommercial, private sector railway operator to ensure efficiency in operation and minimize the risk \nof  not  realizing  economic  benefits  that  are  commercially  viable;  (ii) introduction  of  explicit \nGovernment  subsidies  for  public  service  obligation  passenger  traffic  to  enable  realization  of \neconomically  viable  but  commercially  unviable  passenger  traffic;  (iii) scheduling  of  project \nimplementation to ensure that sections with high economic and financial potential are rehabilitated \nfirst  and  (iv) assurances  by  the  Government  that  negotiations  with  Thailand  concerning \nreestablishing the railway border crossing and reconnecting to the railway in Thailand have started \nand are expected to be concluded prior to loan effectiveness. \n\nG. \n\nDistribution of Project Benefits \n\n14. \nOne third of Cambodians fall below the poverty line and 90% of the poor live in rural areas. \nThe flow of project benefits to the poor includes (i) direct benefits from reduced personal transport \ncosts,  (ii)  indirect  benefits  from  lower  costs  of  transport  for  staple  commodities,  and  (iii)  induced \neconomic  activity  that  could  create  additional  income  generation  and  employment  opportunities. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n61 \n\nThe bulk of benefits to the poor would be reductions in the costs of transporting people and staple \ncommodities,  which  has  a  direct  impact  on  the  cost  of  living,  and  increased  trade  that  would \ncontribute to faster economic growth, which is a strong catalyst for overall poverty reduction. \n\nH. \n\nSubsidy Requirements for Passenger Services \n\n15. \nThe economic analysis shows that passenger railway services are economically viable but, \nas discussed later, maintaining passenger services in the future will require a significant subsidy \nfrom the Government. \n\n16. \nBetween 1998 and 2005, the number of passengers carried by rail declined at an average \nrate  of  about  27%  per  year.  The  decline  was  fastest  on  the  Southern  Line,  where  passenger \nservices effectively ceased in late 2003, and shortly thereafter, the frequency of passenger trains \non the Northern Line was reduced to one train in each direction per week. By 2005, the number of \npassengers  carried  had  declined  to  48,000.  The  bulk  of  remaining  passenger  trips  are  on  the \nsection  between  Phnom  Penh  and  Pursat,  where  the  railway  serves  small  communities  that  are \nremote  from  the  primary  road  system.  The  fall  in  passenger  trips  coincides  with  (i) progressive \nimprovement  of  national  roads  3,  4,  and  5,  which  run  roughly  parallel  to  the  railway;  (ii) rapid \ndevelopment  of  frequent,  reliable,  and  increasingly  comfortable  public  transport  services  that \nrange  from  relatively  expensive  air-conditioned  buses  to  relatively  cheap  minibuses;  and \n(iii) progressively  reduced  travel  speeds  and  service  levels  on  the  railway.  The  railway\u2019s  loss  of \npassengers  has  occurred  even  though  railway  fares  are  considerably  cheaper  than  competing \nminibus services, which suggests that travel time and frequency of service may be more important \nthan price in influencing passengers\u2019 modal choice. \n\n17. \nThe subsidy requirements for maintaining railway passenger traffic in the future have been \nanalyzed  under  the  following  key  assumptions:  (i) future  passenger  services  will  provide  a \nminimum of one train departure per day in each direction on both lines; (ii) departure frequency will \nincrease  when  future  passenger  demand  justifies  it;  and  (iii) railway  passenger  fares  will  be \ncompetitive  with  road  transport.  The  results  are  shown  in  Table  A14.9  and  indicate  that  ticket \nrevenues  from  competitively  priced  passenger  traffic  could  cover  about  50%  of  operating  and \ncapital  costs  attributable  to  passenger  traffic,  resulting  in  an  annual  revenue  shortfall  of  $0.6 \nmillion in the first year of operation, increasing to $3.1 million in 2030. Projected deficits accelerate \nafter 2020, when increasing passenger demand leads to increased train frequencies, first on the \nNorthern Line and later on the Southern Line. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTable A14.9: Projected Revenues and Expenses from  \nTable A14.9: Railway Passenger Operations \n(Market Prices, Selected Years) \n \n\nLine \nSouthern \n\nNorthern \n\nTotal \n\nItem \n\nPassengers (\u2019000) \nPassenger-km (millions) \nRevenues ($ million) \nExpenditures ($ million) \nDeficit ($ million) \nPassengers (\u2019000) \nPassenger-km (millions) \nRevenues ($ million) \nExpenditures ($ million) \nDeficit ($ million) \nPassengers (\u2019000) \nPassenger-km (millions) \nRevenues ($ million) \nExpenditures ($ million) \nDeficit ($ million) \n\n2010 \n47.0 \n6.2 \n0.1 \n0.3 \n0.2 \n92.0 \n12.1 \n0.1 \n0.5 \n0.4 \n140.0 \n18.3 \n0.2 \n0.8 \n0.6 \n\n2015 \n120.0 \n21.3 \n0.2 \n0.4 \n0.2 \n296.0 \n55.4 \n0.6 \n1.3 \n0.7 \n416.0 \n76.7 \n0.8 \n1.8 \n1.0 \n\n2020 \n205.0 \n37.3 \n0.4 \n0.7 \n0.3 \n456.0 \n92.2 \n0.9 \n1.7 \n0.8 \n661.0 \n129.5 \n1.3 \n2.4 \n1.1 \n\n2025 \n356.0 \n67.5 \n0.7 \n1.1 \n0.4 \n769.0 \n164.1 \n1.6 \n3.2 \n1.6 \n1,125.0 \n231.6 \n2.3 \n4.3 \n2.0 \n\n2030 \n507.0 \n97.6 \n1.0 \n1.8 \n0.8 \n1,081.0 \n236.0 \n2.2 \n4.5 \n2.3 \n1,588.0 \n333.7 \n3.2 \n6.3 \n3.1 \n\nSource:  JARTS,  Nippon  Koei  Co.
