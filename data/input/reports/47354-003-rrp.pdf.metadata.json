India  is \nurbanizing rapidly, and the urban poor, estimated to number around 77.5 million, are one of the \ncountry\u2019s  fastest-growing  and  most  vulnerable  population  segments.  They  face  harsh  living \nconditions and have limited access to basic health care, resulting in  a disproportionate burden \nof  ill  health.3 For  example,  the  majority  of  urban  poor  women  delivered  their  babies  at  home. \nAlmost 60% of urban poor children below 1 year of age missed total immunization compared to \nthe  urban  average  of  42.4%.  The  under-five  mortality  rate  among  urban  poor  was  72.7  per \n1,000  live  births  compared  to  the  urban  average  of  51.9.  Many  are  also  migrant  workers  with \ninformal status, which limits their access to basic public services and welfare programs.   \n \n4. \nThe  delivery  of  health  services  in  urban  areas  is  sub-optimal  and  fragmented.  Past \ninterventions have tended to be in the form of vertical programs focusing on particular diseases, \nrather  than  investments  made  to  strengthen  broader  urban  health  systems.  Urban  primary \nhealth  facilities  are  limited  in  number  with  weak  referral  linkages,  underutilized,  vary  in  norms \nand  quality,  and  have  limited  scope  of  services,  such  as  in  community  outreach  and  health \npromotion. Most of the curative primary care occurs at secondary and tertiary levels, leading to \ninefficiencies and overcrowding of these centers. Financial protection and prevention of further \nimpoverishment of the poor is a key concern, given that a major part of total health expenditures \nis paid out-of-pocket to private providers.  \n \nPrivate  health  providers dominate  in urban  areas.  However,  the  large  number  of  urban \n5. \npoor cannot afford these services, and the private health sector\u2019s contribution to primary health \ncare has been limited. Regulatory mechanisms and management capacity need to be improved \nto  strengthen  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  engagement  in  the  health  sector. \nMoreover, health in the urban context is affected by multiple physical and social environmental \nfactors and access to health services. For example, diarrhea\u2014a leading cause of death among \nchildren  in  India\u2014is  correlated  with  poor  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  practices.  More \nattention  is  therefore  required  to  promote  integrated  urban  planning  and  convergence  across \nkey sectors that affect urban health. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided a program preparatory TA.

The next survey, NFHS-4, 2014\u20132015 is due in 2016.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProgram Rationale \n\nAs  a  policy  response,  in  May  2013,  the  Government  of  India  launched  the  NUHM  to \n6. \nstrengthen health  service  delivery  in urban areas. The  NUHM  builds on  extensive stakeholder \nconsultations  and  the  successful  experience  of  the  National  Rural  Health  Mission  (NRHM), \nwhich  started  in  2005.  The  NUHM  and  the  NRHM  are  sub-missions  of  the  National  Health \nMission (NHM) under the Government\u2019s Twelfth Five\u2013Year Plan.4 As a core strategy, the NUHM \nwill enhance the public health system infrastructure by establishing a network of urban primary \nhealth centers (UPHCs) covering all cities with a population above 50,000. The UPHCs, linked \nwith community outreach and referral services, will expand the access of the urban population \nto health services and strengthen primary health care in urban areas. Given that urban health is \na  new  priority  for  the  Government  of  India,  the  NUHM  requires  strong  support  at  all  levels  to \ngain  critical  momentum  and  to  effectively  tackle  evolving  challenges  unique  to  the  urban \ncontext. In October 2014, the Government of India also introduced the Swachh Bharat Mission \n(Clean  India  Initiative)  to  provide  universal  access  to  sanitation  facilities  in  urban  areas. \nEnsuring coherence and convergence of the NUHM and Swachh Bharat Mission will be crucial \nto attain  the  desired  health  outcomes.  Building  on  the  health  sector  gains,  the  Government  of \nIndia  plans  to  progressively  move towards  universal  health  coverage (UHC)  under the Twelfth \nFive\u2013Year  Plan.  Success  of  the  NUHM  will  be  critical  to  the  UHC  agenda  in  urban  areas,  as \nUPHCs are expected to facilitate referrals and insurance coverage for the urban poor.   \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe program is in line with the priorities of the India country partnership strategy, 2013\u2013\n2017,  which  seeks  to  reinforce  India\u2019s  efforts  towards  inclusive  growth.5 The  program  is  also \naligned with the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which includes an increased focus on health \nsector operations and moving towards UHC.6 The results-based lending modality is appropriate \nfor  the  program  because  the  NUHM  has  (i)  strong  government  interest  and  ownership;  (ii)  a \nwell-defined implementation framework; and (iii) reasonable systems in fiduciary management, \nsafeguards,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E).  The  results-based  approach  will  help \nimprove the NUHM\u2019s systems and institutional capacity further and reduce the transaction costs \nassociated  with  monitoring  and  coordinating  the  large  and  diverse  range  of  activities  and \nstakeholders.  \n \nThe program will build on Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s extensive experience in the \n8. \nurban sector and in providing public\u2013private partnership (PPP) advisory services in India.7 It has \nthe  following  key  features  and  will  add  value  by:  (i)  strengthening  management,  M&E,  and \nimplementation  processes  through  significant  capacity  building;  (ii)  facilitating  convergence \nbetween health and urban sector interventions, emphasizing integrated city-level planning with \nactive involvement of urban local bodies (ULBs); (iii) developing partnerships and mechanisms \nto  engage  the  private  health  sector,  including  not-for-profit  entities;  (iv)  enhancing  community \nparticipation  to  improve  governance  and  delivery  of  health  services;  and (v)  fostering  learning \nand knowledge sharing, good practices, and innovations in urban health. \n \n\n                                                \n4  Government  of  India,  Planning  Commission.  2013.

The  program  will  reinforce  the  NUHM\u2019s  efforts  by \nprioritizing  results  and  sequencing  outputs  and  targets  critical  to  achievement  of  the  NUHM\u2019s \noutcome. More specifically, the program results emphasize quality assurance, reaching the poor \nand  the  vulnerable,  enhancing  private  sector  participation  and  intersectoral  convergence, \nknowledge and innovation,  and  improved  management capacity  and business  processes.

The outcome will be increased \naccess to an equitable and quality urban health system, as evidenced by increased institutional \ndeliveries (disbursement-linked indicator [DLI] 1) and complete childhood immunization (DLI 2). \nIncreased  institutional  deliveries,  with  their  quality  assured,  will  help  reduce  deaths  among \nmothers  and  newborns.  Improved  immunization  coverage  will  also  help  avert  infant  and  child \nmortality.  These  indicators  were  chosen  as  they  reflect  high  levels  of  inequity  between  urban \npoor and non-poor. The outcome will be achieved through the following outputs, which focus on \nstrengthening key building blocks of the urban health system:  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutput  1:  Urban  primary  health  care  delivery  system  strengthened.  The  NUHM \n11. \naims to establish a system of urban primary health facilities covering cities and large towns. This \noutput will sharpen the focus of the NUHM\u2019s investments on the urban poor through support for \nmapping  of  slums  and  vulnerable  population  and  city-level  health  planning  with  active \ninvolvement of ULBs (DLI 3, Program Action Plan [PAP] 1.4 and 1.5). This will allow the NUHM \nto have greater synergy with other urban services for improving health outcomes, especially for \nthe urban poor. This output will also ensure that minimum requirements\u2014such as clinical staff, \nmedicine, equipment, and service package\u2014are met at the UPHCs (DLI 3). The NUHM aims to \nstrengthen  community  outreach services  to  extend  community  health  awareness  and  demand \nfor  services  through  urban  accredited  social  health  activists  and  community  collectives \ncomprising local women (Mahila Arogya Samitis). This output will ensure timely recruitment and \nadequate  training  of  urban  accredited  social  health  activists,  and  close  monitoring  of  their \nfunctioning  (DLI  4).  It  will  also  study  and  undertake  capacity  building  of  community-based \ninstitutions such as Mahila Arogya Samitis (PAP 1.2).  \n \n12. \nOutput  2:  Quality  of  urban  health  services  improved.  The  NUHM  will  introduce  a \nquality assurance mechanism for urban primary health facilities in a phased manner. This output \nwill ensure that (i) state-level organizational arrangements for quality assurance and capacity to \nmanage  the  quality  assurance  system  are  established,  (ii)  quality  measurements  including \nclient-satisfaction  are  developed,  and  (iii)  the  NUHM  monitors  the  progress  and  evaluates \neffectiveness  of  the  quality  assurance  mechanism  to  guide  states  in  making  further  quality \nimprovements  (DLI  5  and  PAP  1.7).  The  output  will  also  review  existing  private  provider \nregulations,  accreditation  practices,  and  incentives  for  improving  quality,  accountability,  and \nreliability  of  services  to  promote  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  engagement  in \nhealth (PAP 1.3 and 1.6).  \n\n \n13. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  innovation  and  knowledge \nsharing strengthened. The NUHM needs significant capacity building in program management \nand technical aspects of urban health to operationalize the NUHM\u2019s implementation framework \neffectively.  This  output will  enhance  staff  capacity  to  implement  the  NUHM  (DLI  6).  It  will  help \nthe  NUHM  develop  and  implement  a  capacity  development  framework  to  plan,  monitor,  and \nprovide incentives for capacity development in urban health (DLI 6).8 States with weak capacity \nwill  receive  priority  for  capacity  development  support.  Existing  M&E  mechanisms  and  staff \ncapacity  will  be  enhanced  to  better  support  NUHM  operations,  monitor  progress,  and  provide \nfeedback to policy and planning. More specifically, the output will (i) improve the existing health \nmanagement  information  system  (MIS)  to  produce  urban  disaggregated  data  (DLI  6);  (ii) \nstrengthen existing  MIS to  monitor the  NUHM\u2019s  progress;  and (iii)  improve  data  on key  health \noutcome indicators (PAP 1.1 and PAP 5). This output will also assist the Ministry of Health and \nFamily  Welfare  (MOHFW)  to  develop  and  implement  a  framework  for  innovations  and \npartnerships  (DLI  7). The framework  will  systematically  capture  local  innovations and lessons, \nadapt  international  best  practices,  promote  cross  learning  for  replication  and  expansion,  and \nprovide incentives for more innovative approaches and partnerships.   \n \n\n                                                \n8  The  capacity  development  framework  will  include  (i)  a  comprehensive  human  resource  development  plan  for \nmanagerial  and  technical  personnel;  (ii)  strengthening  of  existing  national  and  state  entities  to  support  urban \nhealth;  (iii)  provision  of  technical  and  management  support  to  MOHFW  and  states\u2014especially  lagging  ones, \nthrough a pool of experts and demand-based consulting inputs through an indefinite service delivery contract; and \n(iv) enhancing knowledge, training, and institutional capacity in urban health through organization of international \nand  national  forums,  twinning  arrangements  between  schools  of  public  health  in  India  and  abroad,  and  a  new \ndedicated institute for urban health research and training. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fConvergence and public\u2013private partnership. The program will promote convergence \n14. \nand PPPs across the three outputs. Convergence will be strengthened at three levels: (i) policy \nand planning at the state level, where state health societies include representatives from health \nand  urban  departments;  (ii)  integrated  planning  for  urban  health  at  the  city  level,  with  active \ninvolvement  of  ULBs,  including  in  planning  and mapping  of  slums  and vulnerable populations; \nand (iii) community processes and participation for better urban services (e.g., water, sanitation, \nand  health  services)  and  improved  health  and  hygiene  practices.  The  program  will  also \nstrengthen  the  enabling  environment  and  capacity  for  private  sector  engagement  by  (i) \nconducting a detailed assessment of the experience, challenges, and opportunities for PPPs in \nIndia\u2019s health sector; and (ii) developing policy guidelines and a menu of models and options for \nPPPs in urban health, including with the nonprofit sector.  \n \n15. \n \n\nADB financing will be disbursed as per the allocation table summarized in Table 2.  \n\nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators  \n\nIndicator \nOutcome: Increased access to equitable and quality urban health system   \n\nDLI 1.

Verification  of  outcome  DLIs  will  rely  on  the  Health  Management  Information \nSystem, validated by independent consultants for data quality and triangulated with population-\nbased survey data to verify overall trends. Output DLIs will be verified through (i) joint reviews \nby  MOHFW  and  ADB  after  reports  from  the  states  are  received  to  gain  better  insights  from \nimplementation  of  program  activities  at  the  state  level,  and  (ii)  the  use  of  existing  reporting \nmechanisms,  such  as  NUHM  quarterly  progress  reports,  and  comparing  the  information  with \nexpenditure reports. Independent evaluation of effectiveness and progress in quality assurance \nand implementation of the capacity development framework will be used for DLI verification, as \nwell  as target  setting for  subsequent  years.

Total  NUHM  financing  needs  for  FY2014\u20132016  are  estimated  at \n$1,954.9  million,  of  which  the  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  to  finance  the  program.  The  loan  terms  and  conditions  are  in  para. \n32.  Subject  to  a  review  of  implementation  progress,  the  government  may  request  additional \nfinancing of $200 million in 2017 to support the NUHM\u2019s transition and continuation into the next \nfive-year plan. The financing plan for the program is summarized in Table 4.  \n \n\nTable 4: Program Financing Plan  \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\n \n\nGovernment of India  \nAsian Development Bank  \n  Ordinary capital resources (loan) \nTotal \n\n1,654.9 \n\n300.0 \n1,954.9 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n84.7 \n\n15.3 \n100.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nDisbursement  arrangements.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  over  3  years,  subject  to the \n19. \nachievement  and  verification  of  the  DLIs.  An  initial  disbursement  of  up  to  $40 million  will  take \nplace  after  loan effectiveness and upon  verification  of  achievement  of  prior  results (completed \nwithin 12 months prior to loan effectiveness). These prior results include: (i) state-level NUHM \nprogram implementation plans approved in FY2014; (ii) urban-specific guidelines for community \nhealth  workers  and  quality  assurance;  and  (iii)  increased  staffing  in  program  management  for \nstates,  districts,  and  cities.  All  prior  results  have  been  met  as  of  March  2015.  Subsequent \ndisbursements  will  be  made  annually  after  the  corresponding  DLIs  are  met.  ADB  will  field \nperiodic  review  missions,  whose  tasks  will  include  validating  DLI  achievements  prior  to  the \nsubmission  of  withdrawal  applications.  Once  DLI  achievements  are  validated,  MOHFW  will \nsubmit withdrawal applications, together with the DLI achievement report to ADB. Any amount \nnot disbursed for unmet DLIs will be disbursed once the DLIs are achieved. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the government\u2019s consolidated fund.  \n \nF. \n \nThe program will strengthen capacity of NUHM institutions at various levels. The NUHM \n20. \nhas adopted NRHM\u2019s implementation arrangements, which have been tested and refined over \ntime,  but  urban-specific  challenges  require  dedicated  capacity-strengthening  efforts,  including: \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\n \n\n\fTechnical Assistance \n\n(i)  strengthening  existing  technical  agencies  at  the  national  and  state  levels,  (ii)  technical \nsupport  to  states  through  a  pool  of  experts  located  at  the  central  level,  (iii)  establishing \ndedicated institutes for urban health research and training, and (iv) creating knowledge-sharing \nplatforms.  The  PAP  complements  the  DLIs  and  includes  actions  in  specific  technical  areas, \nfiduciary  management,  M&E,  safeguards,  and  gender  and  social  equity.  The  PAP  focuses \ncapacity  building  on  key  areas  of  identified  gaps  pertaining  to  strengthening  systems  and \ninstitutions  at  the  national  level,  which  in  turn  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  states  to \nimplement the NUHM.   \n \nG. \n \n21. \nThe attached capacity development TA will help strengthen NUHM implementation. The \nTA is estimated to cost $2.2 million, of which $2 million will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.  The  government  will  support  the  TA  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  and  meeting  space,  and  coordination  support.  The  TA  will  support  (i) \nstate-level  institutional  capacity  assessments;  (ii)  monitoring,  verification,  and  reporting  of \nprogram  results;  and  (iii)  developing  and  learning  from  innovations  in  urban  health.  The  TA \nactivities will focus on states with weaker capacity and where ADB\u2019s urban sector presence can \nbe leveraged to enhance synergy and convergence. The TA will be implemented over a period \nof 36 months from July 2015.  \n \nH. \n \n22. \nProgram implementation will follow the NUHM Implementation Framework. MOHFW will \nbe  the  executing  agency.  The  NHM  Steering  Group  under  the  Union  Health  Minister,  the \nEmpowered  Program  Committee  under  the  Secretary  of  MOHFW,  and  the  National  Program \nCoordination  Committee  under \nthe  Mission  Director  will  guide  and  oversee  NUHM \nimplementation,  including  the  program.  The  Urban  Health  Division  of  MOHFW  will  be  the \nimplementing agency, coordinating program activities, and supporting state-level activities. The \nstates  will  implement  NUHM  activities  based  on  the  annually  approved  state  program \nimplementation plans. The states will prepare periodic reports on progress in meeting DLIs and \nPAP  as  part  of  their  regular  reporting  on  overall  NUHM  implementation.  MOHFW  will \nconsolidate state-level reports and submit periodic progress reports on achievement of DLIs and \nPAP  and  other  NUHM  key  performance  indicators,  and  prepare  DLI  achievement  reports  for \ndisbursement. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  program\u2019s  soundness  was  assessed  according  to  its  relevance,  justification,  and \n23. \nadequacy. 9  The  program  is  highly  relevant  to  India\u2019s  sustainable  and  inclusive  urban \ndevelopment. It will improve the health and well-being of the urban population, focusing on the \npoor  and  the  vulnerable,  and  provide  them  with  equitable  access  to  quality  health  services. \nProgram  interventions  are  well  justified,  focusing  on  key  results  that  are  prioritized  and \nsequenced  to  improve  NUHM  implementation  performance  in  accordance  with  its  core \nstrategies. The program addresses current inefficiencies in the delivery of urban health care by \nstrengthening overall health systems and focusing resources on comprehensive primary health \n\n                                                \n9   Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fcare.  While  the  program  reinforces  public  provisioning  of  essential  health  services,  it  also \nfacilitates  partnerships with  the  private  health  sector  to  improve  health services  coverage  and \nthe  continuum  of  care.  The  program  promotes  cross-sectoral  convergence  to  address  key \ndeterminants  of  urban  health  both  within  and  beyond  the  health  sector.  The  program  has  a \nstrong  gender  focus.  Sustainability  of  results  will  be  ensured  through  the  program\u2019s  focus  on \nstrengthening institutions and significant capacity building.  \n \n24. \nThe  economic  analysis  weighed  the  program\u2019s  benefits  relative  to  its  costs.  The \neconomic benefits are from (i) reduced mortality rates, (ii) increased health facility utilization, (iii) \nincreased productivity and out-of-pocket health care cost savings, and (iv) productivity gains in \nterms of decreased disability-adjusted life years.10 The economic analysis yielded an economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  13%.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  sensitive  to  changes  in \npopulation coverage. Thus, reaching more beneficiaries would ensure the program\u2019s economic \nviability.  \n \n25. \nThe program is categorized as gender equity. It has a strong gender and pro-poor focus. \nHealth interventions directly target the poor while also allocating greater resources to the needs \nof women and girls, especially their reproductive health. Health service providers will be trained \nto  be  responsive  to  specific  needs  and  concerns  of  women  and  girls  and  to  improve  their \ninteractions  with  poor  and  marginalized  communities.  Through  community  outreach  and \ncounselling  services,  women  and  girls  will  be  empowered  to  realize  their  health  rights  and \naddress  issues  of  gender-based  violence.  The  program  will  also  help  improve  the  working \nconditions and career trajectories of female health workers.  \n\n \nProgram System Assessments \n\nB. \n \n26.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  The  M&E  system  assessment  found  that  the \nNUHM\u2019s monitoring framework, comprising oversight and steering committees, MIS, and annual \ncommon review missions, is robust for tracking the program\u2019s outputs and outcome.11 Common \nreview  missions  consist  of  officials  from  MOHFW,  state  health  departments,  and  technical \nexperts; development partners can be invited to participate. The areas for further strengthening \ninclude: (i) enhancing existing systems to track information specific to the NUHM\u2019s progress and \nmain program beneficiaries (the urban poor and vulnerable groups), (ii) building the capacity of \ndata  entry  operators  and  MIS  officers  at  all  levels,  (iii)  harmonizing  the  operability  of  multiple \nsystems, and (iv) providing adequate resources to improve coverage and accuracy of reporting \nand  availability  of  quality  and  timely  data.  MOHFW  will  be  responsible  for  performance \nmonitoring  against  a  set  of  key  performance  indicators  that  are  defined  within  the  NUHM\u2019s \nimplementation and results frameworks, including DLIs and PAP targets. MOHFW will also draw \non interagency information systems to obtain urban health-related indicators in preparing annual \nperformance reports.  \n \n27. \nFiduciary  systems.  Rigorous  financial  management,  procurement,  and  anticorruption \nsystems assessments confirm that the program systems are adequate for results-based lending \nwith some risk mitigation measures.12 The overall financial management risk is moderate. Areas \nfor  improvement  include:  (i)  timely  release  of  funds  from  state  treasuries  to  state  health \n\n                                                \n10  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  Common review missions will cover results, technical, and fiduciary aspects of the program. Program Monitoring \n\nand Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fsocieties,  and  (ii)  timely  financial  reporting  and  auditing.  The  PAP  includes  the  following  risk \nmitigation  measures:  (i)  enhancing  fiduciary  performance  monitoring,  (ii)  supporting  staff \ncapacity  development,  (iii)  ADB  participation  in  annual  common  review  missions  of  MOHFW\u2019s \nfinancial  management  group,  and  (iv)  provision  of  program  financial  statements  following  a \nStatement of Audit Needs. \n \n28. \nThe  program  will  entail  procurement  of  civil  works,  drugs,  and  consumables;  furniture \nand  equipment  at  health  facilities;  and  consulting  services,  all  of  which  will  be  sourced \ndomestically. Overall procurement risk is substantial mainly due to (i) lack of adequately trained \nstaff  in  some  states,  and  (ii)  inadequate  quality  assurance  mechanisms  and  supply \nmanagement,  especially  for  drugs  in  some  states.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  ensuring \nadequate number of qualified procurement staff (DLI 6) and implementing pre- and post-delivery \nquality checks of drugs and annual post-procurement reviews in at least three states (PAP). The \nprogram  will  strengthen  the  implementation  of  the  NHM  Governance  and  Accountability \nFramework,  grievance  redressal  mechanism,  and  community  processes  in  service  delivery \nmonitoring.  The  Guidelines  to  Prevent  or  Mitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited \nActivities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs  were  explained  to,  and  discussed  with,  the \ngovernment and MOHFW.13  \n \n29. \nSafeguard  systems.  This  program  is  categorized  as  B  for  environment,  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. Potential environmental impacts include \nthose  from  construction  and  refurbishing  of  urban  primary  health  facilities  and  generation  of \nbiomedical  waste  and  infection  risks  during  operation.  The  program  safeguard  system \nassessment examined environmental safeguard management and compliance aspects of NHM \nrelative to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The assessment found that a wide range \nof  policies,  laws,  and  regulations  related  to  environmental  issues  are  in  place.  The  existing \nguidelines related to environmental management will be strengthened to guide central and state \ninstitutions and health facilities in urban areas. Environment and social safeguard elements will \nbe incorporated in the quality assurance tools to ensure proper monitoring and compliance. For \npotential  impacts  of  involuntary  resettlement  associated  with  the  program\u2019s  civil  works,  a \nscreening  procedure  has  been  developed  to  ensure  that  the  program  excludes  any  activities \nthat  may  trigger  category  A  or  B.  The  PAP  includes  raising  awareness,  training  of  staff  on \nsafeguards, and enforcement of specific environmental regulations.  \n\n \nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\nC. \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5.14 Overall program risk \nis assessed as substantial, but appropriate risk mitigation measures have been incorporated in \nthe  DLIs  and  PAP  to  ensure  further  strengthening  of  systems  and  achievement  of  program \noutcome. The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.    \n\n                                                \n13  ADB. 2013. Piloting Results-Based Lending for Programs.
