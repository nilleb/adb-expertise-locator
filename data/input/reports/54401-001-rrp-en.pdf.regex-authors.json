I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to CNY230,000,000 to China Cube Water Limited (CCW) for the Asia Cube Wastewater \nTreatment Upgrade Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The proposed project will support private sector participation in expanding wastewater \ntreatment (WWT) capacity and upgrading treatment and discharge standards at operating WWT \nplants alongside the capacity development of the East Asia Department (EARD) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the Yellow and Huai River basins in the PRC.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. The PRC is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, \nwith per capita water availability of about 2,000 cubic meters (m3), only one-quarter of the global \naverage.2 Water scarcity in the PRC is further exacerbated by water pollution. Insufficient access \nto clean water has been described as one of the PRC\u2019s most pressing bottlenecks to economic \ngrowth to 2030, and ADB has estimated an annual investment need of $60 billion per year for \nwater supply and sanitation in the PRC.3 \n \n4.  Because of uneven distribution of water resources, water scarcity is particularly severe in \nthe Yellow and Huai River basins (footnote 1). Water security remains a key constraint for the \nbasins as they are prone to natural hazards and adverse impacts from climate change, such as \nsevere droughts and flooding. For instance, more than three-quarters of the Yellow River basin \narea is defined as ecologically fragile, with its total water resources shrinking by 13.4% since 1990 \n(footnote 2). \n \n5.  In recognition of the critical nature of water security, provincial governments along the river \nbasins are increasingly introducing stricter local WWT discharge standards that are higher than \nthe national requirements.4 ADB, through EARD, is supporting the government  in capacity \ndevelopment and in designing the Yellow River ecological corridor framework which focuses on \nprotecting the fragile ecological environment of the Yellow River basin, balancing the use and \npreservation of water resources, and promoting high-quality green development. Through a One \nADB approach, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department identified a private sector solution \nto complement EARD\u2019s initiatives for water sustainability in key river basins in the PRC. \n \n6.  Project design. The project will support the expansion of WWT capacity and upgrade of \ntreatment and discharge standards at operating WWT plants mainly in third- and fourth-tier cities, \nwith a focus on the Yellow and Huai River basins.5 The project is designed to support private \nsector participation in protecting the water environment in the PRC. Further, the project will bundle \n \n1   ADB. 2020.

As of 2018, 62% of urban WWT plants met class 1A \nwhile 33% were still following class 1B. \n5  Third- and fourth-tier cities are generally cities that are smaller than and ranked below provincial capital cities. \n ", "2 \nprojects typically too small and expensive for international banks to finance on a stand-alone \nbasis. As such, the project is designed to be a least-cost solution to financing smaller-scale WWT \nupgrade and expansion projects in the PRC. \n \n7.  Under the project, ADB will disburse funds to selected subprojects subject to defined \nenvironmental, social, development, and financial criteria. Eligible capital expenditure items will \ninclude constructing, upgrading, expanding, and refinancing the subprojects. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \n8.  Each subproject involves a public\u2013private partnership arrangement with a municipal \ngovernment based on template contracts set forth in national concession guidelines. In each case, \nthe  specific  expansion  and/or  upgrade  infrastructure  will  depend  on  development  and \nenvironmental needs as determined by municipal governments. The facilities will be required to \ncomply with ADB\u2019s safeguards, gender mainstreaming, and other policy requirements. \n \n9.  The sponsor. Asia Cube Water Limited (ACW), the sponsor, is a 100% privately owned \nWWT company with nine operating projects serving more than 2 million residential and industrial \nconsumers in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces in the PRC. All ACW \noperations are consolidated under its wholly owned onshore subsidiary, China Cube Water \nLimited (CCW), the borrower. ACW holds its ownership in CCW through a holding company \nregistered in Hong Kong, China\u2014China Water Cube Limited (CWC), the guarantor. \n \n10.  The borrower. CCW began operating as a WWT utility in 2011 and had a total operating \ncapacity of 207,500 m3 per day as of December 2020. Seventy percent of CCW\u2019s capacity is in \nHenan and Shaanxi provinces, along the Huai and Yellow River basins. Further, CCW has \nadditional capacity of 105,000 m3 per day under development and construction, located near or \nadjacent to its Huai and Yellow River basin projects. CCW distinguishes itself from other WWT \noperators in the PRC by its technological expertise and operational excellence. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \n11.  Shareholders. ACW is wholly owned by I Squared Capital Advisors LLC (ISQ), an \ninternational infrastructure private equity firm. In Asia, ISQ has deployed more than $2.6 billion in \ninvestments, owning, and managing projects in renewable energy, environmental protection, \ntelecommunications, data centers, and highways. Since its acquisition in 2014, ISQ has brought \nin a highly qualified and experienced management team to CCW and introduced initiatives to \nincrease efficiency, such as implementing a rigorous investment approval process, streamlining \noperational processes, and optimizing variable costs such as electricity and chemical costs. \n \n12.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n13.  Pandemic  impacts.  CCW  has  a  large  operational  footprint  in  Henan  and  Shaanxi \nprovinces\u2014neighboring provinces to Hubei, the epicenter of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \noutbreak. CCW acted on municipal government requests to ensure uninterrupted WWT to \nresidential and industrial consumers so that essential activities were supported as the economy \nattempted to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Though CCW experienced a delay in tariff \nrepayment from local governments in the first 6 months of the outbreak, the overall impact has \nbeen limited as the tariff payments have now resumed per the regular payments cycle. Therefore, \nCOVID-19 has not had a material long-term impact on CCW\u2019s project costs or capacity. ADB\u2019s \nsupport  for  private  sector  participation  in  building  and  maintaining  critical  infrastructure  is \nexpected to help local governments ensure resilience in their pandemic recovery efforts. Further, \n ", "3 \nthe subprojects will provide local jobs and a more inclusive work environment for male and female \nemployees. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n14.  Impacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  access  to  wastewater \nmanagement for residential and industrial users enhanced, and the urban environment improved \nin the PRC.6 \n \n15.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: provision of WWT services mainly \nin third- and fourth-tier cities, with a focus on the Yellow and Huai River basins increased and/or \nimproved to meet higher local discharge standards.7 \n \n16.  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) capacity of WWT plants expanded \nand/or effluent discharge upgraded, (ii) budget of local city governments in the PRC supported, \n(iii) local employment generated, and (iv) gender equality in the workplace strengthened. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n17.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The project is aligned with Strategy 2030\u2019s operational \npriority 4 (making cities more livable) by reducing pollution through expansion of WWT capacity \nand by supporting water quality improvements through higher discharge standards of treated \nwastewater. The project is also consistent with Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priority 2 (accelerating \nprogress in gender equality) with measures designed to promote gender-sensitive solutions and \ngender-responsive  infrastructure  assets.  Further, the  project  contributes  to  Strategy  2030\u2019s \noperational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities) by providing \nemployment during the project\u2019s construction and operation phases, and operational priority 3 \n(tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability) by providing additional capacity to treat wastewater. The project supports the \nstrategic priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2021\u20132025 to address \nenvironmental degradation through mainstreaming private sector solutions for environmental \ninfrastructure.8 \n \n18.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  The  project  will  benefit  from  ADB\u2019s  broad \nexperience in mobilizing investment from the private sector to support sustainable development \nin the water infrastructure value chain in the PRC. Key lessons from previous operations include \n(i) water utilities with private investment typically outperform those owned by municipalities;9 \n(ii) effective  policy  dialogue  on  cost  recovery  benefits  urban  water  planning  and  ensures \ninvestment sustainability; 10 (iii) there is a need to adopt an integrated approach, treating water \nsystems together with the catchment area as a complete ecosystem;11 (iv) there is a need for \ninnovative technology (smart systems based on information and communication technology) to \n \n6  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2015.

Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  For  each  subproject,  CCW  (or  the  relevant  subproject  subsidiary \ncompany) will enter into a concession agreement with the local city \ngovernment, typically based on a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer or transfer\u2013\noperate\u2013transfer  model,  for  wastewater  treatment  services.  Each \nsubproject will be implemented in accordance with the granted approvals, \nand during construction and operation will be subject to government \ninspections for various aspects, including environment, land acquisition, \ninvoluntary resettlement, ethnic minorities, labor, safety, quality, and \nsanitation. CCW, as the  borrower, and each subsidiary operating a \nsubproject will be required to comply with relevant ADB policies. \nManagement  CCW will establish project companies for each subproject. CCW will \ncentralize  subproject  development,  procurement,  and  financing \narrangements across its operations. \nImplementation period  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nConstruction arrangements  CCW will centrally coordinate construction of all subprojects with an in-\nhouse monitoring and management team to oversee construction quality. \nEach  subproject  company  will  enter  into  separate  engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contracts with subcontractors. Goods and \nservices will be procured from ADB member countries in a competitive \nand transparent manner. \nOperations arrangements \nRevenue structure  The municipal government will pay wastewater tariffs to CCW (or the \nrelevant  subproject  subsidiary  company)  based  on  the  volume  of \nwastewater treated. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nCost structure  Major operational expenditures include electricity, materials and labor \ncosts, and administrative and maintenance expenses \nOperation and  Operation and maintenance will generally be handled by each subproject \nmaintenance  company\u2019s staff, either transferred from CCW or recruited externally. \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators and \ncompliance with ADB safeguards, will be reported by CCW and monitored \nby ADB throughout the project life. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CCW = China Cube Water Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n12 ADB. 2019.

[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \nG.  Unique Features \n \n22.  The project is ADB\u2019s first to support upgrades in the treatment of municipal and industrial \nwastewater to increase the quality of treated wastewater beyond the highest national wastewater \nstandards. The project was originated and structured through a strong One ADB approach \nundertaken  by  ADB\u2019s  EARD  and  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  in  the  PRC  and \ncomplements the Yellow River ecological corridor framework currently being designed by EARD. \nThe project includes tracking pollutants  such as heavy metals, oil hydrocarbons,  inorganic \nnitrogen, phosphate, and organic matter that are listed as pollutants to be controlled under ADB\u2019s \nAction Plan for Healthy Oceans.14 Finally, supporting a private sector sponsor with expertise in \ndeploying technology and operational efficiency in urban water projects will provide an opportunity \nto extract lessons learned to further encourage private sector participation in addressing one of \nthe PRC\u2019s most critical development needs. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s assistance to CCW is a senior loan of up to CNY230 million from its ordinary capital \nresources. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s assistance provides the following additionality: \n(i)  Financial additionality. Compared to its peers which are mostly state-owned \nentities, CCW has extremely limited access to long-term financing from local \ncommercial banks. In particular, financing for upgrading existing WWT plants to \nmeet higher water quality standards is difficult to obtain because of the lack of \nadditional collateral. Without ADB\u2019s support, CCW would need to fund the required \ncapital expenditure either entirely through equity or pledge other debt-free projects \nas collateral. By aggregating a series of upgrade and expansion subprojects which \nare too small to be financed on a stand-alone basis with an operating portfolio, \nADB will structure a single optimum financing solution for CCW, reduce transaction \ncosts, and bring a cofinancier to the project. \n(ii)  Nonfinancial additionality. ADB will work with CCW to establish a corporate \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) as a condition precedent \nto the first disbursement. ADB\u2019s engagement will promote gender inclusiveness in \nCCW\u2019s operations and support the implementation of CCW\u2019s gender-sensitive \npractices in its human resources policies and in the workplace. Through a One \nADB approach, the key lessons from this project on WWT through a river basin \napproach will be shared with other developing member countries. \n \n \n14 ADB. 2019.

[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n26.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment category B, involuntary resettlement category B, and \nindigenous peoples category C.15 \n \n27.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \n(E&S) impacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. Corrective actions were identified to ensure \nthat CCW\u2019s E&S measures and institutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s \nE&S impacts will be adequate. \n \n28.  External consultants conducted an audit of CCW\u2019s existing corporate ESMS and E&S \ncompliance audits of nine subprojects that will be supported by the ADB loan. At the time of the \nE&S audit, nine subprojects were in operation and only one subproject had ongoing construction \nactivities. The audits did not find any potential significant adverse, irreversible, diverse, or \nunprecedented E&S impacts that may be caused by the upgrade, expansion, and operation of \nCCW subprojects. Auxiliary facilities such as pipelines and sludge treatment stations are built, \noperated, and maintained by local governments and will not be financed by the ADB loan. The \nsubprojects are not located in or adjacent to any legally protected areas; critical habitats; or areas \nof cultural, historical, or religious significance. In each case, the local government determines the \nlocation of the subprojects based on the local land use planning. Treated wastewater from each \nsubproject is discharged to water bodies designated by the government and is strictly monitored \nagainst the applicable effluent discharge standards by the local Ecology and Environmental \nBureau through a real-time wastewater online monitoring system. Based on the screening using \nthe AWARE for Projects tool, the climate risk rating for each subproject ranges from medium to \nhigh because of floods, storms, and snow loading. Since site selections were based on local land \nuse planning and national and local standards for flood control, the potential climate risk may be \nlow  to  medium.  The  corrective  action  includes  developing  and  adopting  a  supplementary \nemergency response plan in case of floods. \n \n29.  CCW has environment, health, and safety (EHS) policies and procedures for its subproject \noperation and maintenance, including equipment maintenance, influent and effluent quality, \nchemical use, occupational health and safety, accident and incident management, and COVID-\n19 prevention and control. The EHS procedures are cascaded to the subprojects and are adjusted \nto comply with requirements in the concession agreements and/or with the applicable regulations. \n \n30.  The audits recommended corrective actions to ensure that  relevant procedures are \nadequate  and  compliant  with  applicable  national  and  local  laws  and  regulations,  good \ninternational industry practices, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements. \nSpecifically,  CCW  will  (i)  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  (ii)  ensure  that \nsubprojects that use ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by \nnational  laws  and  regulations,  (iii)  establish  and  maintain  an  appropriate  corporate  ESMS \n \n15 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "7 \nsatisfactory to ADB before disbursement, (iv) develop and implement formal subproject ESMSs, \n(v) establish coordinated corporate and subproject EHS management mechanisms, (vi) develop \nand  implement  an  EHS  training  program,  and  (vii)  implement  corrective  actions  for  each \nsubproject-specific issue identified during the audits. A time-bound corrective action plan will be \ndiscussed and agreed with CCW. \n \n31.  CCW\u2019s human resource management policies and procedures applicable to direct full-\ntime and short-term employees at corporate and subproject levels were assessed in the audits \nas being compliant with national laws and regulations and include measures to comply with \ninternationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n(2001). Policy enhancement opportunities have been identified regarding specific coverage of \nsubcontractor labor contracting and maximizing local recruitment, which are included in the \ncorrective action plan. The ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with \nnational labor laws and measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy.  The  ESMS  will  also  contain \nrequirements, as applicable, for grievance redress management and information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people following ADB requirements. CCW will report regularly to ADB \non (i) its E&S performance and that of its subprojects, including compliance with applicable laws; \nand (ii) the measures taken.16 \n \n32.  Some gender elements. The project is classified as having some gender elements. The \ngender analysis conducted during due diligence concluded that CCW operates in accordance \nwith national regulations governing gender equality in the workplace. The nature of work at WWT \nplants makes it difficult to have balanced participation in technical and operational jobs in line with \nthe national average, yet CCW maintains consistent female representation in its management \nteams. Since January 2021, the PRC has had its first national legislation in place obliging \ncompanies to adopt measures to prevent and respond to sexual harassment in the workplace.17 \nCCW is committed to having responsive business practices and, notably, initiated an anti-sexual-\nharassment policy. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development, CCW has incorporated \nmeasures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities, \nfostering  a  gender-inclusive  environment. 18  These  measures  relate  to  the  effective \nimplementation of its new anti-sexual-harassment policy through active communication with \nemployees at headquarters and at the plants, using digital and other channels to disseminate key \nmessages on this topic, and its integration into the human resource onboarding program. CCW \nwill also further enhance its facilities to be more gender responsive by setting up designated \nnursing rooms at all plants. CCW will submit periodic reports on its implementation of the \nproposed gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n33.  CCW was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; and Environmental and Social Management System: Audit \nFindings and Details of Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 D.
