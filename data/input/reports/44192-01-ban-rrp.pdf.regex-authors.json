I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Bangladesh\u2013India Electrical Grid Interconnection \nProject. The design and monitoring framework for the project is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Bangladesh and India will establish a cross-border interconnection between the western \nelectrical grid of Bangladesh and the eastern electrical grid of India to facilitate the exchange of \nelectricity between the two countries. In accordance with technical, operational, and economic \nconsiderations, the proposed interconnection will include about 125 kilometers (km) of 400 \nkilovolts (kV) double-circuit transmission line between the electrical substations at Baharampur \nin India and Bheramara in Bangladesh, a 400 kV switching station at Baharampur, a 500-\nmegawatt (MW) back-to-back high voltage direct current (HVDC) substation (400/230 kV) at \nBheramara, and associated infrastructure on both sides. The interconnection will facilitate an \ninitial power flow of 500 MW into Bangladesh from the Indian grid starting in 2012, with a \nprovision to expand the power flow to 1,000 MW. This will help to address the significant power \nshortages in Bangladesh. The project only covers the part of the interconnection facilities to be \nestablished in Bangladesh. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Bangladesh economy has grown by about 6% a year on average since 2005 and \nthis level of growth is expected to continue. Despite its notable macroeconomic progress, \nBangladesh's electrification ratio is still very low, with only 47% of the population having access \nto electricity in 2009.1 Rapid economic growth is causing electricity demand to increase sharply \nas the country continues to industrialize and raise the living standards of its large population. In \n2009, the dependable power-generating capacity was only 3,800 MW, while the peak demand \nwas about 5,500 MW, implying a peak deficit of nearly 1,700 MW.2 This has been resulting in \nfrequent power cuts and voltage fluctuations. A World Bank study states that Bangladesh loses \nnearly $1 billion of economic output a year due to power outages and an unreliable energy \nsupply3. Bangladesh needs to diversify its energy sources as there are concerns over the long-\nterm availability of domestic natural gas, which fuels about 85% of the national power sector \ngeneration capacity.4 \n \n4.  To overcome the power supply crisis, several initiatives have been taken to add new \ngenerating capacity. The government has renewed attempts to mobilize private capital to build \npower plants, whose investment requirements exceed the resources available in the public \nsector. In spite of past success in mobilizing private capital to establish large power stations, \ninternational financial markets remain volatile and there is strong worldwide demand for power \nplant equipment that hampers significant capacity addition in Bangladesh. As a short-term \nmeasure, the government has allowed rental power plants of 50\u2013100 MW to be installed.  Other \ninitiatives by the government include the refurbishment of old gas turbines and the conversion of \nopen-cycle gas turbine generators to combined-cycle power plants, which is expected to result \n                                                 \n1  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources.

The government is also working on initiatives to \nsource power from South Asia region.  \n \n5.  In  1997,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  facilitated  initial  dialogue  between \nBangladesh and India to identify possible exchanges of electricity. However, the dialogue did \nnot lead to definite results. In January 2010, a joint communiqu\u00e9 was signed heralding important \nbreakthroughs in cooperation between the two countries. This initiative between the two prime \nministers will enhance regional cooperation in South Asia, prioritizing grid connectivity and \nexchange of power. Against the backdrop of a growing power crisis in Bangladesh, connecting \nthe two grids will demonstrate the substantial economic benefits that come from enhanced \nregional cooperation and help to address the energy gap in the region.5  \n \n6.  The project is in line with the recommendation of a recent sector assessment program \nevaluation 6 that  ADB  should  facilitate  power  transmission  connectivity  between  India  and \nBangladesh, eventually enabling Bangladesh to harness regional energy resources, including \neventual  access  to  hydropower  from  Bhutan  and  Nepal.  The  project  will  support  regional \ncooperation  in  South  Asia  and  the  regional  cooperation  and  integration  objectives  under \nStrategy 2020.7 ADB has been supporting dialogue on South Asia regional energy cooperation \nthrough the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) regional energy trade \nstudy, which was concluded in early 20108. \n \n7.  In India, the Central Electricity Authority reported a countrywide installed capacity of \n156,780 MW as of January 2010. To meet growing domestic demand, India has plans to \nincrease its capacity by 64,000 MW over the 11th Five Year Plan period (2007\u20132012) and \n100,000  MW  in  the  12th  Five  Year  Plan  period  (2012\u20132017).  On  11  January  2010,  the \ngovernments  of  Bangladesh  and  India  entered  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to \ncooperate  in  the  power  sector  for  a  period  of  at  least  5  years.  In  further  discussions  to \nimplement this memorandum of understanding, the Government of India has expressed its \nintent to make a minimum of 250 MW available for sale to the Bangladesh Power Development \nBoard (BPDB)9 by 2012.10 An additional 250 MW could be sourced from the Indian electricity \nmarket, subject to applicable approvals. The proposed project will help BPDB to lower the  \nexisting  deficit,  improve  the  power  supply,  and  reduce  the  dependence  on  inefficient  and \nexpensive captive and rental generation facilities. A more reliable power supply will benefit \nmanufacturing and service industries in the western part of Bangladesh, including poor and \nvulnerable consumers who are often the hardest hit by inadequate and poor quality power \nsupply.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  project  impact  will  be  enhanced  regional  cooperation  in  the  power  sector, \ncontributing to economic development growth in Bangladesh. The project outcome will be the \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2010. Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program: South Asia 2006\u20132008. Manila. \n6  ADB. 2009.

It is \nthe bulk purchaser from the private generating companies in Bangladesh. \n10 Of the installed capacity of the central generating stations (about 40,000 MW), 15% is not permanently allocated to \nlong-term beneficiaries and allocation occurs at the discretion of the Ministry of Power, Government of India. BPDB \nwill pay the generation tariff for the identified station and applicable transmission charge and trading margin, \ndetermined by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, India. ", "  3\nsuccessful development and operation of a power transmission link between Bangladesh and \nIndia. The project is expected to alleviate the growing power crisis in Bangladesh by making \navailable up to 500 MW of additional power by 2012. This will partially meet the needs of \nexisting and new consumers and support the achievement of the goal of electricity for all by \n2020 in the National Energy Policy.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The physical outputs from the project will be a 40 km, 400 kV double circuit transmission \nline in Bangladesh, a 500 MW back-to-back HVDC substation (400 kV/230 kV) at Bheramara, \nand a 230 kV double circuit loop-in loop-out interconnection at Bheramara to link with the \ntransmission network in Bangladesh. In addition to these physical outputs, the project will train \nstaff of the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB), the executing agency for the project, \nto manage grid operations efficiently following the installation of the HVDC system. It will also \ntrain staff of the BPDB, Power Division, and Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission on \naspects of cross-border electricity trading.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n10.  The project is estimated to cost $158.6 million. The tentative project investment plan is \nsummarized in Table 1. The tentative financing plan for the proposed project is summarized in \nTable 2. It is proposed that the project be funded by ADB and the Government of Bangladesh. \nInfrastructure on the Indian side (a switching station and loop-in loop-out interconnection at \nBaharampur as well as 85 km of the 400 kV double circuit transmission line) will be funded, \ndeveloped, and operated by India.11  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n \nAmounta \nItem    ($ million) \nA.

The PGCB is the executing agency and implementing agency for the project. It will be \nresponsible for supervising implementation and monitoring of operational performance of the \ninterconnection  in  Bangladesh.  To  ensure  effective  project  implementation,  the  PGCB  has \nestablished a project management unit, headed by a project director.  A steering committee \nheaded by the power secretary of Bangladesh will be constituted to review the progress and \nachievements  of  the  project.  A  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  power  secretaries  of \nBangladesh and India, is in place to review the overall progress of the cooperation agreements. \nA working group, chaired by the joint power secretaries of both countries, will monitor and \ncoordinate the activities of the cooperation agreement and a technical team will manage the \ntechnical aspects of the interconnection. \n \n13.  Goods and works to be financed under the project will be procured in accordance with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Advance procurement \naction has been approved. The borrower and the PGCB have been advised that approval of \nadvance procurement does not commit ADB to finance the project. The transmission lines and \nthe substation will be procured following international competitive bidding procedures. Success \nof the project also depends on the timely implementation of the interconnection facilities in India \nand  the  negotiation  of  firm  power  purchase  agreements.  Bids  for  two  packages  for  the \ninterconnection facilities in India have been received and are under evaluation. \n \n14.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n15.  A stand-alone small-scale capacity development technical assistance (TA) financed from \nthe Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV) has been approved. The TA will finance the \ncost of engaging three international consultants for 5 person-months to advise the BPDB on \ncross-border power purchase contracts and capacity building of the staff of the BPDB to procure \npower  from  India,  two  safeguard  specialists  for  4  person-months  for  the  review  and \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  and \nworking group consultations including those to finalize the operational management procedures. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n16.  To  facilitate  exchange  of  electricity  and  to  establish  an  efficient  electrical  grid \ninterconnection between Bangladesh and India, two possible options were available. These \nwere (i) connecting the northeastern region of India with the eastern region of Bangladesh, or  \n(ii)  connecting  the  eastern  region  of  India  with  the  western  region  of  Bangladesh.  A  joint \ntechnical team comprising representatives from the power utilities of both countries concluded \nthat the second option was more robust and would better facilitate the export of power to \n ", "6   \nBangladesh from various generating stations in India as well as the export of power from \nBangladesh to load centers in India, when feasible. The mode of interconnection at 400 kV \ncould either be synchronous or asynchronous. If a synchronous interconnection is adopted, both \ngrids would operate at the same frequency and careful regulation and management of the \nsystem  between  the  two  countries  would  be  needed.  However,  an  asynchronous \ninterconnection would facilitate complete control of the exchange of power between the two \ncountries in either direction, as well as independent operation of the two grids. This would \nobviate the need for additional upstream investment to protect assets from faults and surges in \nthe other system. Accordingly, based on technical, operational, and economic considerations, \nan asynchronous interconnection with an HVDC back-to-back station terminal and a 400-kV \ndouble circuit transmission interconnection line between the two countries has been adopted.    \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  Financial analysis of the proposed project has been carried out in accordance with \nADB's Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.12 All financial costs and benefits have \nbeen expressed at constant 2010 prices. Financial viability was assessed by comparing the \nincremental costs and benefits of the project. The incremental benefits were calculated based \non the PGCB's revenue stream. Costs used to determine the financial internal rate of return \ninclude capital investments, operation and maintenance costs, and taxes incurred to install and \noperate the project. The financial internal rate of return of the project is 6.0%, which compares \nfavorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 2.9%, indicating that the project \nwill be financially viable. \n \n18.  Given that Bangladesh is currently facing a power deficit, cost savings due to prevented \npower outages are a direct tangible economic benefit of the project. The economic analysis \nconducted for the project considered only power generation cost savings using power imported \nfrom India over alternative sources. Least-cost analysis demonstrated the attractiveness of \npower imports. The project\u2019s economic feasibility was assessed both for the region and for \nBangladesh. The project provided an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 31% for the \nregion whereas it provided an EIRR of 27% for Bangladesh. These estimates were based on \nconservative assumptions of resource cost savings. A much higher EIRR would be achieved if \nprevented outage costs were used for economic analysis. The project provides an acceptable \nEIRR even if only 250 MW is delivered at the currently proposed rates. The project returns are \nstable against the relevant risk factors and the analysis clearly demonstrates the economic \nfeasibility of the project.   \n \nC.  Governance \n1.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n19.  The government aims to create a corruption-free environment and in support of that \nobjective it established the Anticorruption Commission in 2004. ADB has provided TA to help \nthe government build capacity and provide support for an integrated anticorruption strategy.13 \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n13 ADB. 2003.

In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the project will be subject to prior ADB approval and will include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \nexecuting agencies and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the project. The government will ensure that the PGCB and other power sector \nentities have operational autonomy and that no organizational changes are carried out that \nwould affect their ability to perform their obligations under the project. \n20.

The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.14 \n \n                                                 \n14 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Bangladesh is the seventh most populous country in the world. In 2006, its population \nwas recorded as 156 million, with 116.2 million living in rural areas.15 The mainstay of the \neconomy is agriculture, which employs almost 60% of the labor force. The main agricultural \nproducts are rice and sugarcane. The other major sector is manufacturing which has been \nslowly growing and contributed 17% of the gross domestic product in 2007.16 \n \n23.  Despite recent economic growth, Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in \nthe world with nearly half of its population living below the $1.25 poverty line. Natural factors \nsuch as floods, cyclones, and other natural calamities contribute to this, but so do institutional \nand governance factors. Lack of adequate and reliable energy sources, especially electricity, \nhave played a vital role in perpetuating poverty. The consumption of commercial energy in \nBangladesh is one of the lowest in the world at about 200 kilograms of oil equivalent per \ncapita.17 Only 47% of the population, most of whom live in the cities (refer footnote 1), has any \naccess to electricity. Even with access to electricity, power cuts and irregular supply cause \nproblems. All these factors have severely impacted the steady growth of industries, added to \nenvironmental  pollution,  affected  the  delivery  of  essential  services,  including  health  and \neducation, and contributed to high poverty levels. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n24.  The project will generate employment for local people during construction. Availability of \nreliable power supply will enhance the production capacity of existing industries and facilitate \nthe initiation of new ones as well as create employment in agriculture, garments, and other \nbusinesses that depend on regular power supply. It is expected that this project will indirectly \ngenerate significant employment.  \n \n25.  The risk of the project helping to spread HIV is minimal, but if potential threats are \nidentified during project implementation, information dissemination campaigns will be carried out \nin the project areas.   \n \n26.  From the environment standpoint, the project is classified as category B, as it is unlikely \nthat  it  will  lead  to  any  adverse  irreversible  impacts.  The  PGCB  has  prepared  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), which analyzed data collected through reviews of reports, \nsatellite photographs, discussions with stakeholders, and field visits to the project area. The IEE \nwas prepared following the requirements of ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2010), the \ngovernment's environmental impact assessment guidelines, and related national policies and \nlegislation. It was well prepared and provides an environmental management plan (EMP) to \naddress  any  impacts.  Potential  impacts  will  mostly  be  temporary.  The  Department  of \nEnvironment  has  granted  environmental  clearance  for  the  project.  Adequate  budgetary \nprovisions for implementation of the EMP have been made. The EMP will form part of the \nbidding documents and the PGCB will supervise both the construction contracts and EMP \nimplementation. Regular implementation progress reports will be submitted to ADB. In the event \nof any change of alignment or the identification of any unanticipated environmental impact \nduring the course of project implementation, the PGCB will revise the EMP.  \n                                                 \n15 International Fund for Agricultural Development. 2008. \nhttp://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/web/guest/country/statistics/tags/bangladesh \n16 ADB. 2009.

The total land required \nis  45.84  hectares  of  which  only  0.22  hectares  will  be  acquired  from  private  owners.  The \nremaining land belongs to Bangladesh Railways and the government. The project will require \nphysical displacement of 12 dwelling units and one shop. In addition, 1,634 households will lose \ntheir crops and trees. People who are displaced will be given compensation for their affected \nassets, including crop compensation for the land at the tower locations, in accordance with the \nprovisions in the resettlement plan. The project authorities will make arrangements for training \nthe displaced people, including tailor-made programs for skills development. Care has been \ntaken to disseminate all relevant information regarding the project and the views and opinions of \nthe displaced persons were taken into consideration in developing the entitlement matrix. If, \nduring implementation, additional aspects develop, suitable adjustments will be made in the \nentitlement matrix in consultation with the affected displaced persons. With regard to indigenous \npeople, the project is categorized as category C.  \n \n28.  The associated transmission component that will be installed in India by the Power Grid \nCorporation of India (PGCIL) is also subject to due diligence and must be implemented in a \nmanner consistent with the requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement. The PGCIL has \ndeveloped its own environment and social safeguard policy which requires it to conduct due \ndiligence  and  ensure  implementation  of  all  necessary  mitigation  measures.  This  policy \ndocument is acceptable to ADB. The PGCB will be requested to provide ADB with PGCIL\u2019s \nsafeguard plans and monitoring reports for review.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  A major risk relates to the fact that a legally binding power purchase agreement has not \nyet  been  signed  or  negotiated.  Should  the  relevant  implementing  entities  in  India  and \nBangladesh fail to reach a legally binding agreement on the intended delivery of at least 250 \nMW  at  the  current  proposed  rates,  the  economic  value  of  the  facilities  constructed  in \nBangladesh and the project benefits might be severely affected. The same applies if the power \nsector cooperation agreement between the two countries is not extended beyond the initial \nperiod of 5 years. To mitigate this risk, it has been agreed that the relevant power sector entities \nin  India  and  Bangladesh  must  enter  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  the  key \nparameters of the proposed power purchase arrangements prior to any withdrawal of ADB loan \nproceeds and that a legally binding power purchase agreement must have been signed within 6 \nmonths thereafter, on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB.  Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 5.  \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelay,  failure  to  complete  Bulk power transmission agreement was signed between PGCIL and \ninterconnection facilities in India  BPDB for implementation and operation of interconnection facilities in \nIndia  \nDelay, failure to enter into binding  The Government of Bangladesh is aware of this risk and expressed \npower  purchase  agreements  or  comfort with the documented political commitments made on the key \nnon extension of the cooperation  parameters of the power sector cooperation by the two governments. \nagreement after January 2015  Entering  into  a  MOU,  followed  by  legally  enforceable  long-term \ncontracts between BPDB and Indian power utilities, will further mitigate \nthis risk. \nLimited  HVDC  technology  This is mitigated by the decision to hire PGCIL as consultants to assist \nimplementation  capacity  in  in  project  design,  bidding  support,  and  implementation  support  in \nBangladesh  Bangladesh.

ASSURANCES \n30.  The government and the PGCB have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n31.  The government and the PGCB have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. Effectiveness of the \nloan and project agreements is conditional upon submission of a subsidiary loan agreement, \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  under  which  the  loan  proceeds  are  relent  to  PGCB.  Furthermore, \nwithdrawals  from  the  loan  account  are  conditional  upon  a  memorandum  of  understanding \nbetween the relevant power sector entities in Bangladesh and India on the key parameters of \nthe proposed power purchase arrangements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR65,986,000  to  the  People's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  \nBangladesh\u2013India Electrical Grid Interconnection Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources  \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nDate:  10 August 2010                       President \n ", "    Appendix 1 11\n   \n   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Baselines   Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nEnhanced regional  Improvement in gross  Country economic outlook  Successful development of \ncooperation in the  domestic product per  and government statistics  the eastern electrical grid of \npower sector,  capita in Bangladesh to    India prepares the \ncontributing to  more than 4% by 2015    foundation for regional \neconomic growth  (2008 baseline: $574    electricity interconnections \nper capita at current    and optimal power sourcing. \nprices)      \nPower consumption in  ADB Energy Outlook for  Political and operational \nBangladesh to improve  Asia and the Pacifica   agreements arrived at \nby 2012    between South Asian \n(2008 baseline:159    countries on regional \nkWh per capita in  BPDB and annual energy  electricity trading \nBangladesh compared  sector reports for Bhutan,   \nwith approximately 300  India, Maldives, Nepal,   \nkWh per capita in South  and Sri Lanka   \nAsia)      \n   \nAccess to power  BPDB annual reports  Additional investments in \nsources in the South  transmission capacity to \nAsia region   facilitate such power flows \n(2009 baseline: no   \nexchange with any \nother country) \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nSuccessful  500 MW of power  BPDB annual reports  Availability of 250-500 MW \ndevelopment and  (1,152\u20133,456 GWh)  power generation capacity to \noperation of a  available over the  Bangladesh on long-term \ntransmission link  interconnection to  basis from India  \nbetween Bangladesh  Bangladesh   \nand India  commencing 2012  Power interconnection \n(2009 baseline: no  infrastructure and capacity \ntransfer of power)  building successfully \n  completed by 2012  \n \nRisks \nCost of delivered power is \nnot competitive compared to \noptions in Bangladesh. \n \nDelay in entering into power \npurchase agreements \n \nInadequate power \ngeneration capacity in the \neastern region of India \n \n ", "12      Appendix 1     \n \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  baselines   Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nOutputs       \nPhysical Investment      Assumptions \n1.
