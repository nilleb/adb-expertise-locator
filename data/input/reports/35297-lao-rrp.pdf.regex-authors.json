The principal constraints faced by the predominantly Lao \nTheung and Lao Sung ethnic groups in the project area relate, \namong  other  issues,  to  (i)  falling  productivity  from  upland \nagriculture,  (ii)  lack  of  adequate  land  and  forest  for  food \nproduction and gathering, and (iii) lack of access to appropriate \ntechnologies and marketing opportunities for improved livestock \nproduction  and  trade.  Given  the  dependency  of  upland \ncommunities on swidden agriculture, and its falling productivity \nand land availability constraints, there is an urgent need to shift to \nhigher  value  production  per  hectare  and  per  unit  of  labor. \nImproved livestock production provides such an option. Livestock \nproduction  provides  within  a  context  of  small  farms  in  upland \nareas, an opportunity to capture higher value added per hectare \nthan crop-based agriculture. The growing connectivity of Lao PDR \nalso places it in an advantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis regional trade \nto  supply  the  growing  demand  for  livestock  from  neighboring \ncountries.  It  holds  out  promise  of  improved  nutrition  and  food \nsecurity  for  groups  that  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  food \nshortages and lack of protein in their diets. The role of livestock \nrearing in resource-poor upland households is highly significant, \nas it contributes to food security and more than one third of cash \nincome derived from agriculture. Livestock productivity has been \nseverely  constrained  by  the  lack  of  appropriate  production \ntechnologies,  household  labor  availability  and  inefficiencies, \nfinancial and extension services, and access to markets. Against \nthis  background,  the  Project  proposes  to:  (i)  enhance  village \nlivestock systems by (a) improving on farm livestock productivity,; \n(b)  market  linkages  and  enterprise  development  to  support \nlivestock  rearing;  and  (c)  an  enhanced  participatory  extension \nnetwork;  (ii)  support  capacity  building  for  community  driven \ndevelopment (CDD); and (iii) support for project management and \nimplementation. \n \n ", "ii \nRationale  The majority of the population in the project area, predominantly \n  Lao  Theung  and  Lao  Sung  ethnic  groups,  is  poor  and  lacks \n  access to productive resources essential for subsistence. At least \n  60% of the population is poor, with much higher levels of poverty \n  and food shortages in particular areas. Education levels among \n  the Lao Theung and Lao Sung ethnic groups are low, especially \n  among women. Literacy rates in the project area vary from 33% to \n  75%  but  are  considerably  lower  among  women  and  upland \n  communities.  Most  households  experience  food  shortages  for \n  several  months  each  year.  Lao  Theung  and  Lao  Sung  ethnic \n  groups are increasingly facing the loss of traditional livelihoods, \n  which has created \u201cnew poverty\u201d and food shortages. Livestock \n  rearing is an integral part of the upland farming system and its \n  development will impact favorably on the poor and on women. \n  Although livestock improvement was the topmost priority identified \n  by them during the Participatory Poverty Assessment of Lao PDR, \n  (PPA), these communities have had little support until now.Their \n  access to extension support for livestock rearing has been limited \n  on account of lack of technical and financial resources at field \n  level, as well as lack of culturally responsive extension methods \n  and widespread illiteracy among ethnic groups. Upland livelihoods \n  can  be  improved  from  present  levels  by  increasing  livestock \n  productivity,  better  nutrition,  disease  control,  improved \n  management, biosecurity measures (to reduce risk of disease), \n  and  better  marketing.  These  steps  are  expected  to  lead  to \nincreased  returns  to  labor  and  improved  food  security  and \n \nnutrition of vulnerable groups, as well as in building up productive \n \nassets for the poor in upland areas.  \n \n \n  The Project is highly relevant in a context where traditional upland \n  livelihoods, based on swidden agriculture and forest resources, \n  are facing a growing crisis. Livestock is the one productive asset \n  that  households  possess  that  clearly  belongs  to  them.  By \n  improving livestock management practices, and addressing the \n  factors  affecting  low  productivity\u2014including  poor  extension \n  services, lack of adequate livestock assets, lack of organization, \n  and lack of access to markets\u2014the Project can ensure significant \n  gains in upland livelihoods with relatively small investments. It can \n  also reduce demands on household labor, improve its efficiency, \n  and  lead  to  greater  food  security  and  cash  incomes  for  poor \n  upland communities. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project area consists of approximately 1,500 villages in 18 \n  priority poor districts of five northern provinces of Lao PDR. Of \n  these only about 650 have various degrees of physical access. \n  The Project directly targets approximately 408 villages, which are \n  relatively easier for extension staff to access throughout the year. \n  The total population of these 408 villages is 146,880 persons in \n  24,480 households. Of these the Project is likely to impact directly \n  upon  17,000  households.  Among  the  17,000  households, \n  assuming  a  30%  adoption  rate  of  appropriate  technologies \n  provided by the project, by rearers of pigs and larger livestock, the \n ", "  iii\n  Project is likely to result in increased incomes of up to $1400 per \n  annum  for  approximately  7,000  households.  By  including \n  smallholder poultry rearers, the number of beneficiary households \n  will increase by approximately 10,000, bringing the total number of \n  beneficiary households to 17,000. Of these approximately 50% \n  are expected to be poor.  \n   \nIn addition, it is expected that communities living in the remaining \n \n250 villages which are relatively accessible for parts of the year, \n \nare likely to benefit through peer group exchanges of information, \n \nand increasing interactions with trained extension staff. \n \n \n \nWith  and  without  Project  comparisons  show  that  the  Project \n \nenables the poor households to come out of poverty permanently \n \nby adopting the new production and management technologies. \n \n \n  Lao Theung and Lao Sung ethnic groups will benefit significantly \n  from the Project (80% of all beneficiaries)\u2014including Khmu (38%), \n  Hmong  (18%),  Akha  (10%),  and  smaller  ethnic  groups (14%). \n  Tai Kadai or Lowland Lao comprise the remainder (20%). At least \n  50% of all beneficiaries will be women, given the Project\u2019s focus \n  on (i) improving management of small livestock, and (ii) providing \n  equitable opportunities and support for ethnic women in particular \n  to participate in project activities.  \n   \n  The outcome of the Project will be (i) greater sustainability of \n  upland livelihoods; (ii) reduced poverty; (iii) improved commercial \n  prospects in the area for livestock production aimed at export and \n  domestic markets; (iv) improved nutrition and food security among \n  the  poor;  and  (v)  increased  self-reliance  of  the  upland \n  communities, particularly women. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The total investment cost of the Project is estimated at $18.4 \n  million including contingencies, taxes, and duties. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n   \n     Item  Total Percent \n \n  ADB Loan  9.3    50.5 \n \n  ADF Grant  0.7    4.0 \n \n  Government  1.1    5.8 \n \n    Beneficiaries  0.8    4.4 \n    SDC  3.5    19.0 \n    IFAD  3.0    16.3 \n      Total  18.4    100.0 \n \n  Percent   100.0   \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, IFAD = \n  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  SDC  =  Swiss  Agency  for \n  Development and Cooperation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n ", "iv \nLoan Amount and Terms  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of various \n  currencies  equivalent  to  $9.3  million  from  its  Special  Funds \n  resources. The loan will have a maturity term of 32 years including \n  a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% during the grace \n  period and 1.5% during the principal amortization, and other terms \n  and conditions set forth in the loan agreement and the project \n  agreement. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 December 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2012 \nCompletion Date   \n \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry(MAF) \n   \nImplementation  A national project steering committee (PSC) will be established \nArrangements  with representation from relevant departments of MAF, including \n  the  Department  of  Livestock  and  Fisheries  (DLF)National \n  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Extension  Service  (NAFES),  National \n  Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI), ministries of \n  finance and foreign affairs, and governors\u2019 representatives from \n  the  five  participating  provinces.  It  will  be  chaired  by  the  vice \n  minister of MAF. The PSC will be responsible for reviewing project \n  implementation and guiding the Executing Agency (EA) on issues \n  relating to policy and interdepartmental cooperation. \n   \nA regional office, headed by the national project director, will be \n \nestablished  in  the  Provincial  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Office \n \n(PAFO)  precincts  in the  province of Luang Prabang to supervise \n \n  project  activities.  Financial  management  will  require  close \ncoordination with the Department of Livestock and Fisheries (DLF) \nin Vientiane. Due to the location of the RO at Luang Prabang, \nfinancial  management  will  be  performed  by  existing  staff  from \nwithin the Administration Division of DLF, to be appointed to a \nNational Coordination Office (NCO) in Vientiane to address ADB \nloan  withdrawal  and  replenishment.  Provincial  Implementation \nUnits (PIUs) and associated provincial coordination committees \n(PCCs)  chaired  by  the  provincial  vice  governor  with  members \nfrom  relevant  departments,  will  be  established,  in  order  to \ncoordinate implementation in each province. The PCCs will be \ncommon for all livestock projects at provincial level. The PIUs will \nbe established within the existing livestock section of each PAFO. \nThe District Agriculture and Forestry Extension Office (DAFEO) in \neach participating district will implement the Project at grassroots \nlevel through extension workers (EWs). \n \nThe EWs will form the frontline for the transfer of appropriate \ntechnologies using participatory methods, to village communities \norganized for the purpose into groups. Project activities will be \nincorporated  into  DAFEO  work  plans  and  collated  into  annual \nPAFO work plans that will be approved by the PCCs, DLF, and \nsubsequently MAF and the PSC. Project management structures \nare  designed  to  work  within  existing  institutional  structures  of \n ", "  v\nnational  and  provincial  administrations  to  ensure  sustainability \nafter project completion. \n \nProject  activities  will  start  gradually  in  several  villages  in  six \ndistricts\u2014one in each province plus two in Houaphanh in the first \nyear, expanding by six in the second year and a further six in the \nthird year. By the end of the Project, activities will cover about \n408 villages in 18 districts as targeted by the sixth year of project \nimplementation.  \n \n  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for \n  Smallholder  Livestock  Systems  Project,  which  began  in \n  November 2005, will be responsible for training DAFEO staff in all \nfirst  year  districts  of  the  Project.  The  government  extension \nservice will be responsible for facilitating the introduction of new \ntechnologies.  The  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and \nCooperation  (SDC)  will  provide  grant  funding  through  joint \ncofinancing  for  capacity  building  of  extension  workers,  subject \nmatter  specialists  and  consultancy  contracts  for  organization, \nmobilization, and training of village communities. Capacity building \nat  several  levels  will  be  implemented  by  consultants  engaged \nunder the Project, supervised by the regional office.  \n   \n  Coordination with other externally aided livestock projects being \nimplemented  in  the  same  districts  and  provinces  will  be  an \nimportant aspect of project implementation. This will be ensured \nthrough the provincial and national committees which will also \nreview implementation of other  livestock projects. \n \nProcurement  Vehicles, equipment, contract services to be financed from the \nproceeds of the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Civil  works  comprise  small \ncontracts not exceeding $100,000, typically for building renovation \nand construction (district offices and the regional office) in the \nmore remote district centers and for small-scale civil works carried \nout  in  remote  village  locations.  As  such,  civil  works  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures among private local contractors acceptable to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will fund a total of 64 person-months of international \nconsultants and 402 person-months of national consultants  in \nboth short and long-term assignments to be recruited through a \nfirm and /or individual contracts. Consulting services are funded \nentirely  through  grant  financing.  ADB  in  consultation  with  the \nGovernment of Lao PDR, SDC and the International Fund for \nAgricultural Development (IFAD) will directly recruit consultants \nfunded under the Asian Development Fund IX (ADF IX) grant. \nThese  include  project  management,  expertise  related  to \nsmallholder poultry production, livestock marketing and trade, and \nmonitoring and evaluation related inputs. The SDC grant funded \nconsultant services for livestock improvement inputs, community \nmobilization, and gender and development, will be recruited by the \n ", "vi \nGovernment, in consultation with ADB, SDC and IFAD. The level \nof consulting services identified under the Project is considered \ncritical, in view of the crucial gaps in capacity. That is the rationale \nfor SDC support, which is aimed entirely at providing critically \nrequired  inputs  to  improve  livestock  sector  performance  at  all \nlevels. Close monitoring of consultant service delivery and outputs \nwill be undertaken by the EA and ADB review missions. \n \nIn addition to the above, consultancy services will be provided \nunder the SDC grant, through contracts negotiated by the RO with \nprovincial  and  district  units  of  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  (LWU),  to \nfacilitate CDD.  \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project has an estimated economic internal rate of return of \nBeneficiaries  17%. The results obtained are robust to adoption rates declines \nfor  appropriate  technologies,  declines  in  farm  gate  prices, \ndecreases in the number of villages impacted, and  project cost \nincreases. The majority of the beneficiaries will be the poor and \nwomen,  drawn  mainly  from  Lao  Theung  and  Lao  Sung \ncommunities.  The  bulk  of  project  benefits  will  come  from \nincremental production. Women in these communities will benefit \nfrom improved returns to labor, access to knowledge, financing \nservices,  and  improved  marketing  channels.  Nonquantifiable \nbenefits include (i) sustainable livelihood systems; (ii) improved \nnutrition  of  vulnerable  groups,  including  children  and  young \nmothers,  the  sick,  and  the  elderly;  (iii)  inclusive  social \ndevelopment;  (iv)  improved  gender  equity;  (v)  impacts  on \nparticipating  institutions  in  terms  of  effective  coordination, \nimproved  communication,  guidance  and  technical  support;  and \n(vi)  reinforcement  of  the  role  of  DLF  as  the  lead  agency \nresponsible  for  planning  and  reviewing  progress  of  livestock \nsector objectives. \n \nEnvironmental impacts will be positive, with improved livestock \nproduction  providing  a  real  alternative  to  environmentally \ndamaging shifting cultivation, where fallow periods have reduced \ndramatically. Greater confinement of livestock will reduce damage \nto  forest  areas  and  the  possibility  of  soil  erosion  through \noverstocking  of  pastures,  as  well  as  provide  opportunities  for \nbetter management and use of manure, with potential benefits for \ncrop production. Negative concerns are small and localized for \nwhich there are mitigating measures (under the Project) to prevent \nany  negative  environmental  impact.  Through  improved  market \nlinks  and  enterprise  development,  domestic  and  international \ntrade in livestock will be facilitated. This will contribute to greater \ntransparency regarding trends in market demand and pricing of \nlivestock, resulting in fair returns to smallholders. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Limited access to financial services is a risk that may limit the full \nrealization  of  benefits  to  the  poor  from  improved  productivity. \n ", "  vii\nAccess to investment funds is essential for production and risk \nmanagement.  Improvements  in  land  use  planning,  particularly \nownership  rights  for  ethnic  minority  communities,  along  with \nimproved  access  to  financial  services  under  the  Project,  will \nensure sustainable gains to the beneficiaries. Highly pathogenic \navian influenza (HPAI) is not expected to be a risk in hilly and \nthinly populated areas of the Project.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the \nproposed Northern Region Sustainable Livelihoods through Livestock Development Project,1 \n(iii) the proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant provided by \nthe Government of Switzerland to Lao PDR for the proposed Northern Region Sustainable \nLivelihoods through Livestock Development Project, and (iv) the proposed administration by \nADB  of  a  loan  provided  by  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  to \nLao PDR for the proposed Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Poverty, Agriculture and Livestock \n2.   Lack  of  access  to  adequate  productive  resources,  culturally  appropriate  livelihoods \nsupport, and weak links with markets lead to the absence of sustainable livelihoods2 for the \npredominantly ethnic populations in northern Lao PDR. Sustainable livelihoods imply access to \ncapital, resources, and capabilities, which together provide individuals and households with food \nsecurity and resources to meet their present and future needs, increase well-being, and reduce \nvulnerability to sudden shocks that may lead to poverty and deprivation. By improving livestock \nproductivity,the proposed Project aims to address some of the key constraints faced by poor \nupland communities, women, and other disadvantaged groups, in improving the sustainability of \ntheir livelihoods in 18 of the priority poor districts located in five northern provinces. \n \n3.   Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in Asia, with 31%3 of all households assessed \nas \u201cpoor\u201d. Steady economic growth of approximately 5% per annum has been maintained since \n2000, reducing overall poverty. However, the level of rural poverty is high (on average about \n52.5%) in the northern region, and is significantly higher than urban poverty. Rural poverty is \ncharacterized by a lack of sustainable livelihoods (vulnerability to food shortages, reduced ability \nto meet family subsistence requirements, low levels of asset formation, and low education and \nhealth levels), and is mainly found in upland areas of the northern provinces, among the largely \nethnic population.4 The upland ethnic communities have gradually faced reduced access to \nproductive resources, including land and forest, contributing to a growing lack of sustainable \nlivelihoods. Among upland ethnic groups, poverty\u2014seen as \u201cnew poverty\u201d\u2014is measured5 in \nterms  of  declining  rice  sufficiency  (upland  rice  production  has  declined  by  about  30,000 \nhectares  [ha]  per  year  over  the  past  3  years),  and  incomes  that  are  insufficient  to  meet \n                                                 \n1  The Project was prepared under ADB. 2004.

Directed at reducing poverty in the upland areas of the northern region \nof Lao PDR, the Centro Internationale Agricultura Tropicale (CIAT) and International Livestock Research Institute, \nwhich have extensive experience and involvement in livestock development in Lao PDR, undertook the study.  \n2  The sustainable livelihoods framework developed by IDS, Sussex, and adopted by the Department for International \nDevelopment (DFID) of the United Kingdom, puts people at the center of development and views them as \noperating in a context of vulnerability. It provides a very useful and relevant analytical framework to (i) understand \nthe multidimensional nature of poverty, as defined by people themselves; and (ii) analyze their access to the \nvarious types of capital (financial, physical, social, human, natural) and their ability to combine and utilize these \nassets as individuals, households, in ways that may enable them to ensure their access to adequate subsistence \nand  well-being\u2014including  improvements  therein  in  future,  without  undermining  the  natural  resource  base. \nConversely, the absence of any of these can lead to poverty, vulnerability to loss of subsistence, and well-being. \nFor further details, refer to, among others, Chambers, R., and G.

Upland  communities \nmeasure relative wealth through their livestock holdings6 although livestock holdings are small. \nAbout 93% of villagers raise poultry, 74% of villagers raise pigs, 8% raise goats, 31% raise \ncattle, and 41% raise buffalo. The average number of animals per animal-raising household is 1 \ncow and buffalo, 3\u20134 pigs, and 3\u20135 hens plus their young. The causes of poverty are seen by \nthe people as: (i) shortages of land for swidden cultivation; (ii) falling productivity of upland \ncultivation, caused by increasing population pressures and policies aimed at reducing shifting \ncultivation; (iii) lack of livestock assets; (iv) prevalence of animal diseases; (v) lack of technical \nproduction and management knowledge; (vi) lack of communications, both physical and for \ntechnology and information transfer; (vii) lack of market access; and (viii) lack of capital for \ninvestment,  among  others.  Given  the  extent  of  poverty  and  regular  incidences  of  food \nshortages,  and  the  diminishing  prospects  under  swidden  cultivation  systems,  the  livestock \nsubsector can play a critical role in improving the sustainability of upland livelihoods.7 It can \nprovide a source of food security and nutrition for vulnerable groups, as well as a source of \nincome  in  rural  poor  households.  It  can  help  to  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  improved \nlivelihoods; increase food security; and improve the nutritional status of vulnerable groups, \nespecially children, young mothers, the elderly, and the sick. It can strengthen the overall \neconomic and social position of women in the family and the community.  \n \n4.   In the northern provinces, livestock production has remained relatively static over the \npast 10 years. Livestock are an integral part of the assets of most rural inhabitants, with about \n90% of all farm households raising one or more livestock species. About 95% of all livestock \ntraded are produced by smallholders from holdings of just over 1 ha (excluding communal \ngrazing areas). Livestock rearing and cropping activities are integrated, with livestock providing \ninputs  into  crop  production  such  as  draught  power  for  soil  preparation,  manure  for  soil \nfertilization, and in the transportation of goods. In turn, cattle, buffalo, pigs, goats, and chickens \ngraze on recently harvested cropped areas or are fed by-products from rice milling for part of \ntheir diet. \n \n5.   Livestock production systems vary between lowland and upland areas, where animals \nare  raised  for  different  purposes.  In  the  uplands,  livestock  form  a  vital  part  of  the  rural \nhousehold\u2019s physical and social capital. They are reared both for draught power and as a \nsource of manure, and are a vital form of savings.8 In upland areas, livestock are also a source \nof food security, given the ever-present risk of food shortages. Smaller livestock such as poultry9 \nand pigs provide food security to poor households. Livestock production strategies are oriented \ntoward dealing with limitations imposed by low availability of capital, technical knowledge and \nknow-how, and limited household labor. In this scenario, animals graze and forage with minimal \nsupervision and are exposed to predators, disease, theft, and road accidents. However, in spite \nof all limitations imposed by the current situation, livestock production plays a key role in \nhousehold income earning; the sale of cattle, buffalo, pigs, and poultry accounts for about 50% \nof annual household cash incomes in upland areas and about 30% nationally.10 \n                                                 \n6  Agriculture remains the leading sector of the economy, accounting for 51% of gross domestic product (GDP), while \nlivestock plays a significant role within the sector with 36% of agricultural GDP. The contribution of livestock to \nagricultural GDP has increased steadily over the past 10 years in response to increasing prices and export and \ndomestic demand. \n7  In the participatory poverty assessment (PPA), ethnic groups listed improvement of livestock productivity as one of \ntheir top priorities for poverty reduction. \n8 There are hardly any formal financial services available. \n9 \u201cSale of a hen can help us procure rice for several days\u2019 consumption by an individual. If there is an outbreak of \ndisease, all our assets can be wiped out very quickly. We need to reduce risks of disease in order to safeguard our \nanimal assets.\u201d Field research conversation of the Fact-Finding Mission with Khmu women\u2019s group, recorded in \nXieng Khouang Province, 2006. \n10 ADB. 2002. Review of the Livestock Sector of Lao PDR. Manila. \n ", "3 \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Role of Upland Livestock Production Systems \n6.   Under upland farming systems, livestock achieve low growth rates, are susceptible to \ninfectious  and  parasitic  diseases,  and  have  low  fertility  rates  that  result  in  low  off-take, \ngenerating low household returns. Mortality rates of livestock are very high in the northern \nprovinces,11 severely affecting productivity. Given the extent of these communities\u2019 dependence \non livestock rearing and the poor performance of the livestock subsector to date, opportunities \nfor improving productivity and thereby the sustainability of upland livelihoods are apparent in \nterms of improving feeding and management technologies and improved links with financial \nservices and markets. \n \n7.   In the uplands, there is widespread familiarity and considerable local knowledge in \nrearing livestock, which is part of the rich cultural tradition of the ethnic communities in northern \nLao PDR. However, lack of knowledge of animal nutrition, disease prevention, and improved \nlivestock  management,  among  others,  pose  a  risk  to  improving  the  performance  of  the \nsubsector and its role in further enhancing rural livelihoods. Upland ethnic communities often \nlack access to adequate financial resources which are required to improve their access to \nlivelihood  assets,  help  them  adopt  improved  management,  and  enable  them  to  invest  in \nadequate nutrition and health for livestock. There is a need to develop flexible and culturally \nappropriate financial services that can meet these requirements in a sustainable manner. There \nis also a need to support the adoption of improved livestock management practices that are \neffective  while  not  adding  to  the  already  overtaxed  household  labor.  Improved  extension \nservices need to be developed with culturally appropriate and gender-responsive participatory \nmethods to deliver know-how and appropriate management practices. The situation is made \nmore complex by the frequent lack of a working knowledge of the Lao language among upland \nethnic communities. Literacy levels in the Lao language among ethnic groups are low, with even \nlower  percentages  of  literacy  among  women.12 There  is  a  need  to  support  upland  ethnic \ncommunities, particularly women, with Lao language and numeracy training; translation support \nfor  extension;  and  opportunities  to  participate  in  training,  credit,  and  enterprise  promotion \nprograms.  \n \n8.   The advantageous situation of Lao PDR regarding regional integration in the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS), with increased trade and transport linkages being promoted, can \nprovide opportunities for poor rural communities to improve their incomes through increased \nmarket-oriented production and higher prices. Smallholder poultry production has the potential \nto provide food security and improved nutritional levels for poor households and vulnerable \ngroups. While smallholder poultry markets tend to be local ones, there is a growing domestic \ndemand in urban centers for smallholder poultry products, which needs to be passed on to \nsmallholder poultry producers in the northern region. There is also a growing potential demand \nfor pigs, goat, and cattle from urban areas within Lao PDR as well as in the GMS region. \n  \n9.   With their present limited access to financial, physical, social, human, and natural and \ninformation capital,13 the risks associated with increased livestock production to meet increasing \n                                                 \n11 These average approximately 67% for pigs, 16% for goats, 40% for cattle, 20% for buffalo, and 67% for chicken \n(footnote 10). \n12 Gender inequality is rife among ethnic groups, with almost 80% of women remaining illiterate. Girls assume \nhousehold responsibilities at an early age, which precludes their education and reduces their chances to improve \ntheir livelihoods by learning improved technologies or accessing financial resources and markets. \n13 A sixth kind of capital\u2014information capital\u2014has been added to the original list in view of the crucial gaps that can \nbe created by its absence for rural households in terms of their ability to take advantage of improved technologies \nand  opportunities.  See  Odero,  K.  2004.  Extending  the  Sustainable  Livelihoods  Framework.  University  of \nZimbabwe. \n ", "4   \ndemand have been too high for the majority of smallholders. Without a significant change in the \norientation of smallholder production systems\u2014that leads to greater labor efficiency with better \nextension and improved management techniques, better access to capital, reduced risk of \ndisease and mortality, and improved market links\u2014the future scenario will mean a continuation \nof this constrained and inefficient extensive production system, which neither guarantees food \nsecurity nor adequate incomes from livestock rearing. Conversely, by increasing productivity \nfrom current levels, the development of livestock has the potential to bring about sustainability of \nupland livelihoods and reduce poverty significantly. It also offers one of the few alternative \nincome-generating options for shifting cultivators to substitute their diminishing returns from \nlabor-intensive upland cropping activities. It provides a viable option for increasing food security \namong food insecure households and improving the nutritional levels of vulnerable groups. \n \n10.   Reducing poverty in these uplands, through developing sustainable rural livelihoods, \nrequires improving the productivity of the livestock subsector. The upland ethnic communities \nare characterized by high levels of poverty, estimated at an average of 68%, with much higher \nlevels in Houaphanh (92%) and parts of Xieng Khouang (62%). These communities are facing a \nlivelihood  crisis.  Given  the  overall  constraints  in  developing  other  livelihoods  activities, \nenhancing livestock production provides upland ethnic communities with a viable opportunity to \nimprove  livelihoods  while  conserving  their  natural  resource  base.  Improving  livestock \nproductivity  has  the  potential  to  address  the  four  elements  of  poverty  in  the  uplands: \n(i) increasing  food  security  and  improving  the  nutrition  of  vulnerable  groups,  (ii)  reducing \nvulnerability  of  the  poor  to  sudden  shocks,  (iii)  increasing  smallholders\u2019  assets,  and \n(iv) contributing to the empowerment of women and the poor. \n \n2.  The Government\u2019s Strategy for the Livestock Subsector \n11.   The Government recognizes the importance of the livestock sector for poverty reduction \nand achieving commodity diversification in regional trading patterns. One of the key objectives \nof the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) is to improve food security. \nThe NGPES14 seeks a multisector approach to poverty reduction and recognizes the pivotal role \nof agriculture in this area. Public investment through development projects has been targeted at \n47 districts identified for priority investment among 72 poor districts identified in the NGPES. \nThe  Government  has  identified  relevant  initiatives  for  livestock  development  as  part  of  its \nobjective  of  improving  the  food  security  and  nutrition  of  vulnerable  groups,  promoting \ndiversification  of  livelihoods,  and  redressing  the  specific  hardships  of  upland  farming \ncommunities. These initiatives include strengthening the disease monitoring capabilities of the \nDepartment  of  Livestock  and  Fisheries  (DLF),  supported  by  an  increased  distribution  of \nvaccines, associated with farmer training in their application, and the strengthening of livestock \nextension services, coupled with improved information networks for disease control and market \ninformation. The NGPES also emphasizes participatory planning for the livestock subsector, \nimproved technical assistance (TA) for private sector breeding, production of livestock and \nlivestock products, and improved market linkages for rural producers\u2014in order to reap the \nbenefits of increasing trade. It notes the need for improved availability of financial and physical \nresources in upland areas to enable producers to acquire livestock assets and make critical \ninvestments in improved feeding, animal health, and livestock management, for better incomes.  \n \n12.   Another strategic government document relevant to livestock development15 states that \nthe development goal for the livestock subsector in the medium term is \u201cto improve returns to \nproducers  and  export  earnings  through  the  environmentally  and  economically  sustainable \nimprovement of livestock productivity\u201d (footnote 15). The Vision for Livestock Development in \nLao PDR to the Year 2020 suggests that regional demand for livestock products provides an \n                                                 \n14  Lao PDR. 2004.

The key constraints to \nlivestock development are identified17 as low productivity caused by limited technical support \nand feed supplies, low capital formation, and links to markets, and a situation where producers \nare trapped in a system of low inputs and low outputs.18 Incremental productivity is anticipated \nto come from key investments in Government\u2019s prioritized program and action plan, together \nwith improved capacities of technical extension staff and better access to credit.19 \n \n3.  Lessons Learned and External Assistance to the Sector \n13.  Lessons Learned from Donor-assisted Projects in Lao PDR. External assistance20 to \nthe  sector  consists  mainly  of  grant  projects,  providing  capacity  building  and  improved \ntechnologies for forage production, disease control and monitoring, extension and training, \nmonitoring and evaluation, legislation, and private sector participation. The experience of donor-\nassisted projects indicates that project design should incorporate only proven technologies that \nare compatible with the socioeconomic conditions of beneficiaries. A highly relevant lesson for \nLao PDR, with its limited budgetary resources, is that only those activities that can be sustained \nover the long term through an appropriate institutional framework21 should be supported. It is \nclear that project design should not only strengthen the capacity of the government extension \nnetwork but also develop associated private sector activities that are expected to be self-\nsustaining where the opportunity arises. In the area of agricultural extension, experience points \nto  the  importance  of  adopting  a  participatory,  pro-poor,  culturally  compatible,  and  gender-\nresponsive approach to change. The approach also needs to be holistic in its assessment of the \nsustainability of livelihood activities at the household level. The experiences of the Lao PDR \nExtension for Agriculture Project (LEAP) assisted by the Swiss Agency for Development and \nCooperation (SDC), the Livestock Farmer Support Project assisted by the European Union \n(EU), and the Forages and Livestock Systems Project assisted by the Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID),  demonstrate  the  gaps  in  the  knowledge  and  current \npractices of extension staff with regard to participatory approaches, extension techniques, and  \ntechnical skills. \n \n14.   While LEAP developed the \u201cLao Extension Approach\u201d, which has been successfully \napplied in lowland cropping systems, the LEAP includes among other aspects, the building \nblocks for further development in order to respond to  the needs of  more complex upland \nfarming systems. Project interventions must respond to poor smallholders\u2019 needs and demands \nif new technologies are to be widely adopted. There is also a demonstrated need for culturally \ncompatible rural financial services to support poor smallholders\u2019 access to financial resources. \nWithout access to capital for investment in breeding/rearing stock, critical production needs \n(such  as  feed  supplements),  and  animal  health  requirements  (such  as  vaccines),  poor \nhouseholds will not be able to achieve sustainable livelihoods through livestock development. \n                                                 \n16 DLF. 1998. op cit.Protein consumption levels are estimated to increase from 22 kilograms (kg) per capita per \nannum in rural areas (33 kg in urban areas) to 50\u201370 kg per head per annum by 2020. \n17 DLF. 1998.

Changes were proposed to these under the Lao European Union project that provided \nassistance in drafting a revised veterinary law in 2002. The draft veterinary law has been approved by the Council \nof Ministers and is awaiting consideration by the National Assembly. \n20 Appendix 5 contains a detailed review of externally aided projects that are not included in the memorandum of \nunderstanding (MOU). \n21 The approach to the institutional framework to be adopted for improved livestock subsector performance, as well \nas under this proposed Project, is based on the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005), wherein it is agreed \nthat \u201cdonor(s) will base their overall support on receiving countries\u2019 national development strategies, institutions \nand procedures\u201d. \n ", "6   \nRural poor households require access to flexible financial services, physical and enhanced \nsocial  capital,  which  facilitate  participatory  decision  making  by  borrowing  households,  to \nimprove their livelihoods in a sustainable manner.  \n \n15.  Lessons from the ongoing Oudomxay Community Initiatives Support Project22 show the \nimportance of (i) flexibility of design; (ii) building the technical and financial capacity of village \nhouseholds,  formed  into  groups  for  self-management;  and  (iii)  the  timely  combination  of \ntechnical training, extension, and microfinance to support poverty reduction in a sustainable \nmanner. The project also demonstrates the impacts of (i) support to smaller livestock production \non the poor, and the (ii) significance of reliance on the village revolving funds groups in terms of \npromoting  sustainable  and  transparent  financial  systems.  The  role  of  management  and \nmonitoring support from government line departments and project staff is critical to ensure the \nsuccess of the interventions. Project benefit monitoring and evaluation PBME is critical to \nmonitor project outcomes regularly against representative indicators, including assets structures \nand nutrition levels, in order to take corrective actions within the project.  \n \n16.    ADB highlighted the significance of the livestock subsector for the livelihoods of ethnic \ngroups in Lao PDR through the PPA i.e. (footnote 5).  In 2005, ADB conducted the Sector \nAssistance Program Evaluation (SAPE) for the Agriculture and Natural Resources Sector in Lao \nPDR,23 which pointed to the diffused nature of ADB assistance in the agriculture and natural \nresources sector in Lao PDR. The SAPE made the following recommendations, among others: \n(i) the need for greater selectivity of sectors for ADB participation, in terms of composition and \nspread, (ii) the need to reflect government priorities, (iii) the division of roles and responsibilities \namong development partners, (iv) the need for strategic partnerships with other development \npartners, (v) the past performance of ADB supported projects and comparative advantages of \nADB and the skills mix requirements. The Government has taken these recommendations \npositively  and  the  Project  is  designed  to  address  concerns  identified  by  the  SAPE.  The \nGovernment also recognizes the key role played by ADB in providing direction to the livestock \nsubsector through its policy and strategic papers.24 The Project has been included as a firm \nproject in ADB\u2019s pipeline for Lao PDR since 2004. \n \n17.   ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II (2006\u20132008) points to the need for greater selectivity of \nsectors  for  ADB  participation  and  forging  partnerships  with  other  development  partners  to \nincrease knowledge-based project design and implementation\u2014in order to improve the chances \nof  greater  success  and  sustainability  of  project  outcomes.  It  also  points  to  the  need  for \npartnership  with  other  knowledge  institutions  in  order  to  increase  the  relevance  of  project \ninterventions, greater sustainability, and mutual learning. The Project is partnering with SDC \nand IFAD, which have extensive experience in designing and implementing sustainable pro-\npoor livelihoods projects in Lao PDR and the region\u2014concentrating on livestock components \naimed at reducing poverty, and improving the food security and nutrition of the poor. The Project \nis strengthened by the ongoing ADB ( 2004) Technical Assistance for (the) Capacity Building for \nSmallholder Livestock Systems,Manila (TA 4406-LAO) approved on 4 November 2004) which is \nbeing implemented by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), an institute of the \nConsultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), at its Asia headquarters in \nVientiane.25 CIAT  is  implementing  the  TA  with  DLF,  training  selected  staff  from  the  five \nProvincial Agriculture and Forestry Offices (PAFOs) and six District Agriculture and Fisheries \n                                                 \n22 Supported by IFAD, Government of Belgium, Government of the Lao PDR, and World Food Program. \n23 Operations Evaluation Department, ADB. 2005.

Lessons  Learned  from  Projects  Assisted  by  ADB  and  IFAD  elsewhere  in  the \nregion. Lessons learned from ADB projects in the livestock subsector in the Asia-Pacific region \nillustrate the need to adopt participatory, poverty-focused, gender-sensitive project design and \nstrategies. Recent ADB-assisted projects that have been highly successful in the livestock \nsubsector include the Bangladesh Participatory Livestock Development Project and the third \nNepal Livestock Project. These projects demonstrate positive impacts on poverty reduction and \nwomen. They have had clear objectives and strategies centered on the needs and capabilities \nof the poor and women, and build on their strengths and capacities. Lessons from earlier \nprojects point to the need to (i)  avoid top-heavy, unsustainable implementation structures; \n(ii) advocate rational and sustainable approaches to management structures, staffing levels, \nstaff deployment, and staff management; and (iii) ensure better project design, which should \nreflect the Government\u2019s priorities and a realistic assessment of the capacity to adopt and \nimplement suggested strategies.  \n \n19.  These projects have demonstrated a clear need for strong and sustained government \ncommitment toward institutional change and development as well as ADB\u2019s continued support \nfor project administration and supervision on a regular basis. The lessons illustrate the need for \nclose cooperation with development partners. In instances of cofinancing, they emphasize the \nneed for harmonized project management, supervision, and appropriate and timely fielding of \nconsultants and TA inputs. Most importantly, they demonstrate the clear role for participatory \napproaches;  the  importance  of  promoting  farmer/producer  organizations;  gender \nresponsiveness; partnership with the private sector, NGOs, and mass organizations; and a \nsystems approach. Lastly, they emphasize the need for incorporation of strong PBME from the \noutset to help the process of learning and adaptation, and provide a solid basis for assessing \nthe impacts of projects, according to objectives and indicators adopted in the project. These \nlessons  have  been  discussed  with  the  Government  and  reflected  in  the  design  and \nimplementation arrangements adopted under the proposed Project. \n \n4.  Comparative Advantages of the Northern Region \n20.  Livestock enterprises are important livelihood activities in upland rural areas, and have \nthe potential to improve the sustainability of household incomes and reduce poverty. Given the \nlow population densities, small farms, mountainous terrain, and poor infrastructure, smallholder \nsystems are more suited to livestock development. There are opportunities to increase animal \nproductivity in the uplands significantly by building upon established technologies in livestock \nnutrition,  improved  rearing  and  management  practices,  increasing  market  orientation,  and \npromoting access to services and markets. A good starting point is the inclusion of smaller \nlivestock\u2014including  poultry,  pigs,  and  goat  rearing\u2014which  can  include  poor  households \neffectively.  Participatory  strategies and  flexible  financial  services  can  enable  resource-poor \nhouseholds to move to larger livestock eventually. This can be done through the dissemination \nof technical know-how and extension support, village-based revolving funds for microcredit, and \nmarketing support strategies. Such gains in livestock productivity and incomes can be achieved \nby  building  the  capacity  extension  workers  through  training  in  improved  technologies,  and \n                                                 \n26 ADB 2004.

Domestic consumption of meat and livestock products (including poultry products) is \nincreasing, particularly in urban areas. Export markets for buffalo, cattle, goats, and black pigs \nare  growing  in  neighboring  countries.  Opportunities  for  trade  in  livestock  are  expected  to \nincrease with the development of regional road networks throughout the GMS, several of which \ncut across northern Lao PDR, and regional trade and transport agreements. To address these \nemerging market opportunities, upland livestock systems must become more productive and \nefficient. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n22.  The impact of the Project will contribute to improved sustainability of livelihoods for \nupland smallholders in northern Lao PDR. The immediate outcome is to improve livestock \nproductivity and profitability under integrated upland farming systems through (i) enhanced \nproductivity of village livestock systems, (ii) capacity building for community driven development \n(CDD),  and  (iii)  support  for  implementation  management.  The  Project  will  contribute  to \nsustainable livelihoods through improved cash incomes, food security, and nutrition for some of \nthe poorest segments of the population. It will achieve this by providing access to appropriate  \ntechnology,  management and marketing systems, rationalizing household labor requirements, \nand improving returns to labor. It will contribute to gender equity by providing upland ethnic \nwomen with opportunities and support to participate in the selection and implementation of \ncommunity and household investments in livelihoods improvements. It will provide literacy in the \nLao language, and numeracy training. It will support organization of village communities into \nsmall groups, training in credit management, and technical training in livestock rearing. Women \nwill  participate  equitably  in  all  training,  group  formation,  and  activities  aimed  at  improved \nextension,  production,  and  marketing.  Environmental  benefits  are  expected  from  the \nstabilization of shifting cultivation, improved hygiene, introduction of cut-and-carry systems, and \nenvironmental  health\u2014through  waste  management,  disease  control,  and  controlled  animal \nmovements. \n \nB.     Project Outputs \n23.  To achieve the outcomes of sustained livelihood through livestock development, three \noutputs are proposed: (i) enhanced productivity of village livestock systems; (ii) capacity building \nfor  community  driven  development  (CDD),  and  (iii)  implementation  management.  The  first \noutput  is  further  disaggregated  into  the  essential  elements  required  to  achieve  improved \nincomes  from  livestock  production,  including:  (i)  on-farm  livestock  productivity,  (ii)  market \nlinkages  and  enterprise  development  to  support  livestock  rearing,  and  (iii)  an  enhanced \nparticipatory extension network. Designed in this manner, the constraints identified above can \nbe addressed within the framework of a livelihood approach, which addresses the need for \nimproving production skills among poor smallholders, helps develop closer market linkages so \nthat farm gate price signals reflect the growing demand for livestock products, provides new \nincentives for the adoption of improved production technologies, develops extension workers\u2019 \nskills to facilitate change among poor livestock producers, and resources extension activities. \nThe second output is directed at enhancing capacity of upland communities for CDD through \nparticipatory mobilization and organization of community-based groups for production, revolving \nfunds, and infrastructure development. The third output addresses implementation management \nof a multifaceted project, involving the cooperation of a number of government agencies, village-\nbased producer/revolving fund groups,  and private organizations and individuals. \n \n ", "9 \na.   Enhanced Village Livestock Systems \n24.  Activities proposed here will be funded by the ADB loan, ADF IX grant, SDC grant, and \nIFAD loan. The activities identified here seek to change the current perspective of low input-low \noutput systems, making smallholders more market-oriented. Such a change requires persistent \nguidance given the long tradition prevalent among upland ethnic communities, of risk-reducing \nupland  farming  systems,  and  requires  a  problem-solving  approach  to  introduce  proven \ntechnologies to modernize production systems. \n \n25.  Productivity Initiatives. The Project will through the first part of its outputs: (i) improve \ngrowth of larger livestock through the introduction of forages from contracted nurseries (initially \n2 ha per district) supported by the Project; supply seed and planting material; provide training in \nforage establishment, management, and feeding to livestock; and develop other animal feed \nsources; (ii) improve livestock survival through better management of livestock movements, \nimproved  disease  monitoring,  and  support  for  emergency  vaccinations  (together  with  the \nongoing regional technical assistance project for the Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases \nin the GMS i.e. (footnote 27), and the EU-funded Livestock Farmer Support Project);27 (iii) \nimprove livestock productivity through smallholder training and demonstrations using equipment \nsupplied by the Project; (iv) improve the access of poor livestock rearers, particularly women, to \nimproved smallholder poultry and piggery production and management techniques, and improve \nbiosecurity measures to control livestock disease\u2014by building on the lessons of past and \nongoing projects; and (v) improve small and large livestock management practices through \nfarmer training, demonstrations of livestock management (exclusion techniques, fencing, and \nbreeder management) using equipment and materials provided by the Project. Small livestock \nproduction will  be  used  as  a  strategy  to  include  resource-poor  households  in the  Project. \nTraining will be provided to women in particular in improving feeding and management of \nsmallholder poultry and piggery by providing supplementary feeding, improved housing, and use \nof exclusion techniques for smallholder poultry stocks. These measures will be essential for \nlivestock productivity gains and will act as insurance against disease, as biosecurity measures \ncan help to reduce the risk of infection considerably. Productivity increases in smaller livestock \ncan also help to significantly improve the incomes and nutrition of vulnerable groups among \nupland communities.28 Women poultry workers will be trained and deployed at village level. The \nProject will support village revolving funds,29 to be channeled through village-based socially \nhomogenous revolving fund groups. This will primarily support the access of the poor and \nwomen to improved livelihood assets. Potential borrowers organized in groups will undergo \ntraining in improved livestock rearing and management, credit, and savings programs. They will \ndecide on the purposes for their borrowings in their groups. They will prepare business plans, \nwhich will be vetted by the groups and community facilitators30 prior to being funded. They will \nundertake a savings programs for at least 9 months before becoming eligible to borrow from \nproject funds. The Project will support continued monitoring and technical backstopping of these \nrevolving funds through consulting services contracts with district teams at local level. Detailed \nguidelines for the village revolving funds are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n                                                 \n27 Houaphanh is not included in the EU project. \n28 ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n29 These funds will be drawn from the imprest account by the service organizations into district bank accounts to be \nmaintained by them. Based on approved business plans from the village groups, funds will be released for \ndisbursement to the groups. All groups will be provided with safe deposit boxes for savings and loan repayments to \nbe stored prior to deposit in district bank accounts. The service providers will submit accounts to MOF for funds \ndrawn by them. The Committee on Investment and Planning has developed guidelines for such funds, which form \nthe basis of these guidelines. Guidelines for these funds are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n30 To be appointed by the organizations to be contracted to promote village household based groups. \n ", "10  \n26.  Market Linkages and Enterprise Development. The second part of Project outputs will \n(i) improve market efficiency and enterprise development by promoting input supply businesses \n(feed, inputs, veterinary products, breeders etc.). (ii) It will support the establishment of private \nlivestock trading farms at critical markets and border crossing points to assist farmers with \nexport-oriented development, supply local breeders, and develop contract supply mechanisms \nwith smallholders. (iii) The Project will also support smallholder group31 marketing activities to \nimprove farm gate returns for livestock; (iv) provide increased bargaining power to producers \nand improved efficiencies in marketing; and (v) contract appropriately qualified institutions32 to \nprovide  group  marketing  support,  among  others,  and  promote  small  enterprises  in  rural \ncommunities. (vi)The Project will promote farmer and trader contacts through workshops at \nmarket  centers;  (vii)support  market  studies  and  surveys,  farmer  study  tours;  and,  (vii)  in \ncooperation with the EU Livestock Support Project, support upgrading of selected existing \nmarket centers used by large numbers of villages\u2014in order to promote livestock quarantine, \nhealth checks, and certification for export, among other initiatives. Microenterprises, which are \nlargely likely to be women\u2019s enterprises (including local feed production and sale, egg sales, \nchick sellers), will be supported through the village revolving funds for improved income earning. \nThe Project will fund small village infrastructure to improve links with markets, reduce household \nlabor  requirements,  and  improve  returns  to  labor.  These  may  include  among  others  the \nrehabilitation or establishment of essential transport, water supply, and other small-scale village \ninfrastructure (e.g., gravity-fed water supplies); and improve market access (pathways and \nbridges). Women will be fully involved in decision making regarding funding of investments in \nvillage infrastructure improvements. Detailed guidelines on village infrastructure funds are in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n27.  Participatory Extension Network. The Project will support the Government\u2019s extension \nservice through capacity building, and by providing the resources needed to introduce changes \nto  the  livestock  farming  systems.  It  will  address  gaps  in    technical  skills;  and  develop \nparticipatory,  gender-responsive,  and  culturally  sensitive  pro-poor  extension  techniques  for \nexisting  and  newly  appointed  extension  workers  in  DAFEOs  of  participating  districts  and \nextension  staff  in  the  village  clusters.  Village  women  poultry  workers  will  be  trained  and \ndeployed to provide the first level of support to poultry rearers, who are mainly women and the \npoor. The Project will adopt a problem solving approach to extension and training, where \nlivestock  producer  groups  will  be  asked  to  identify  constraints  and  opportunities,  and \nexamine/try  a  set  of  interventions  to  address  them.  This  approach  will  provide  extension \nworkers  with  skills  to  interact  with  smallholders,  deal  with  any  species,  and  respond \nprogressively as there is increased demand from smallholders for extension services. It will \ndevelop the technical skills of subject matter specialists in PAFOs that provide support to field \nextension workers. Training will also be provided in the management of extension activities \nthrough a training and peer review process at provincial and district level. \n \n    b.  Capacity Building for Community Driven Development  \n   \n28.  This output,33 to be funded by the SDC grant, will fully support the previous output by \nbuilding  community  capacity  to  identify,  manage,  and  implement  village  investments  for \nimproved livelihoods. The regional office will enter into contracts with Lao Women Union (LWU) \nunits at the provincial and district levels, which will have the necessary skills and experience to \n                                                 \n31 These groups will be based on the same principles of social homogeneity and will be supported through \nmobilization and training to be included under Project, see paragraph 28. \n32 Refer to paragraph 28.  \n33 In the context of the Project, CDD implies the development of socially inclusive community groups with the capacity \nto select activities, technologies, and infrastructure based on their priorities; and take decisions to invest village \nfunds, which will be made available under the Project. The pattern of CDD is based on the NGPES, which calls for \nCDD as a way to allocate resources to priority needs and projects.  \n ", "11 \nprovide support for community-based group formation in developing participatory procedures \nand managing village revolving funds. These LWU units will be contracted to provide training \nand  organizational  capacity  building  to  participating  village  communities  for  CDD.  The \ncontracted provincial and district LWU units will be responsible for community mobilization and \nthe formation of community-based groups such as producer groups for livestock management \ntraining and extension, group-based microenterprises, marketing groups, and revolving fund \ngroups,  among  others.  These  community-based  groups  will  be  based  on  self-selection  by \nmembers, according to principles of social homogeneity and gender equity. Both women and \nmen are expected to participate fully in the groups, and be trained in decision making and \nmanagement  of  project  resources  (i.e.,  numeracy,  accounting,  simple  bookkeeping)  to  be \ninvested at village level (i.e.,village revolving funds and infrastructure funds.) To set up the \nvillage revolving funds, the village based revolving funds groups will enter into contracts with the \nservice organizations. The LWU units will submit regular progress and financial reports to the \nregional office, provincial coordination committee (PCC), and project steering committee (PSC), \non the outcomes and sustainability of the village revolving fund program. Detailed terms of \nreference for LWU are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \nc.  Implementation Management \n29.  The  third  output  will  ensure  efficient  project  implementation  and  management  by \nproviding resources to support the management structure at national and provincial levels, \nwhich will be established within existing government institutions.34 It will also provide technical \nsupport  services  in  project  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (ADF  grant-funded), \nextension training, community development and gender awareness, livestock production, animal \nhealth,  and  livestock  trade  development  (donor-funded).  A  summary  design  matrix  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nC.     ADF IX Grant Component  \n30.  Lao PDR is the poorest country in the GMS but the incidence of poverty in the project \narea  of  52.5%  is  significantly  above  the  national  poverty  incidence  of  31%.  The  Project \ndeserves grant funding as much as possible. Given the limited availability of ADB grant for this \nProject,  it  is  proposed  to  use  any  available  grant  to  finance  extension  and  participatory \napproaches. There is sufficient justification for providing $0.7 million in grant funding under \nADF IX, as Lao PDR qualifies for the ADF grant program35. The ADF IX grant will be used to \nfinance consulting services required for capacity building in project management, smallholder \npoultry improvements, monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes, and marketing and trade \ndevelopment. \n \nD.    Special Features \n \n1.  Participatory Approaches to Sustainable Livelihoods, Social Inclusion, and \n  Gender and Development \n31.  The  Project  is  expected  to  stimulate  participatory  development  and  inclusive  social \ndevelopment. Project measures to address this include: (i) mobilizing and organizing ethnic \n                                                 \n34  The Appraisal Mission for the proposed loan has had discussions with the Government of the Lao PDR and \nEmbassy of Japan in Lao PDR with a view to preparing a proposal for possible financing by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR) for sustained capacity building of provincial and district staff and mass organizations in \nproject management, pro-poor livestock development approaches, and credit and savings management, among \nother areas. It is also proposed to include the services of a cultural anthropologist as adviser to the regional office \nto advise on culturally appropriate project approaches to the diverse ethnic groups in the project areas. ADB will \nprepare the draft proposal for review by the Government and ADB. \n35 As per Staff Instructions, memo of DG SPD 16 November 2004, approved by President, up to 50% of total program \nassistance to Lao PDR can be provided as grant. \n ", "12  \ngroup smallholders into village-based production and village revolving funds groups for CDD, by \nproviding training and extension, access to revolving credit, mobilizing savings, microenterprise \npromotion,  and  market  orientation;  (ii)  facilitating  improved  access  to  resources  for  better \nmanagement  and  marketing  of  livestock  products;  (iii)  developing  audiovisual  extension \nmaterials in ethnic group languages for radio broadcasts in project areas; and (iv) building the \ncapacity of extension workers to develop social, gender, and cultural skills to enable them to \nwork with diverse cultural communities. An ethnic groups development plan (EGDP), which lays \nout  the  objectives  and  strategies  for  their  equitable  participation  in  project  outcomes  and \nimpacts,  has  been  prepared. 36  The  Project  will  develop  appropriate  technologies  and \nmethodologies for training and extension. It will build on the significant ongoing work supported \nby other donors, in particular the LEAP, adding additional features as required for upland \ncommunities; and facilitate their spread through village-based training for women and men \nlivestock rearers. It will support the recruitment and training of selected upland ethnic staff; \nprovide Lao language training programs, as well as training in numerical skills in upland ethnic \ncommunities, aimed at women, to reduce their gender-based disadvantages and improve their \ncapacity to absorb new technology. It will work with LWU and other suitable organizations to \ndevelop  gender  sensitivity  and  participatory  approaches  at  all  levels,  starting  from  village \ncommunities. It will organize upland ethnic women, among others, into village revolving fund \ngroups  and  producer  groups\u2014for  improved  access  to  training  and  extension,  market \ninformation, and better returns from livestock production.37 Attention will be paid to women\u2019s \nparticipation in training, extension, and revolving funds.  \n \n32.   Gender action plan. This addresses particular gender-based disadvantages faced by \nethnic women in poor upland communities in improving their livelihoods. It tries to address these \nby including the following: (i) progressively increasing participation of women in all village-based \ntraining programs for livestock production improvements, especially programs aimed at small \nlivestock production and management; (ii) village-based Lao language training and numeracy \ntraining  programs  to  overcome  their  initial  disadvantage;  (iii)  women\u2019s  participation  in  the \nmanagement and operation of village-based revolving funds; and (iv) women\u2019s access to village \ninfrastructure funds for drudgery reduction and improved returns to their labor. Gender and \ndevelopment  training  will  be  provided  to  staff  of  the  Implementing  Agency  and  all  project \nentities. Further details are provided in Appendix 12. \n \nE.   Project Investment Plan \n33.  The  total  Project  cost  is  estimated  at  $18.4  million,  comprising  $11.8  million  for \ninvestments in the Enhancement of Village Livestock Systems; about $3.4 million for Capacity \nBuilding for CDD Component, about $0.5 million for Implementation Management, about $0.8 \nmillion unallocated budget38 and $0.4 million for financial charges during implementation, as \ngiven in Table 1. The detailed cost estimates by Expenditure Category and Detailed Cost \nEstimates by Financiers are given in Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n36 See Appendix 12.  \n37 It is likely that a proposal may be prepared for submission to the JFPR, for support to poor ethnic group women to \nimprove their access to livestock resources, and other productive resources, and strengthen their social and \neconomic status. \n38 The detailed allocation of $0.8 million will be discussed during the Inception Mission. \n ", "13 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amountsa \nA.

The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of  $9.3  million  from  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF), and an additional ADF IX grant of $ 0.7 million. The loan will have a \n32 year term, including a grace period of eight years, an interest rate of 1% during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% during principal amortization and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements. The ADB loan will finance about 50% of total project \ncosts. The ADF IX grant will provide the equivalent of $0.7 million. SDC will finance a grant of \n$3.5 million and IFAD will finance about $ 3 million loan.  \n \n35.  The Government will fund $1.1 million representing about 5.8% of the total cost. The \nbeneficiaries are estimated to contribute about $0.8 million to project costs mainly in kind (in the \nform of labor, locally available materials), and in contribution to savings associated with the \nvillage revolving funds.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.    Project Management \n36.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the \nProject. DLF will be the overall Implementing Agency (IA) to coordinate the activities of the \n ", "14  \nNational Agricultural and Forestry Extension Service (NAFES) and National Agriculture and \nForestry  Research  Institute  (NAFRI)  at  the  national  level,  and  the  provincial  and  district \ninstitutions involved in implementation. A regional office, to be responsible to DLF, will be \nestablished within the premises of the PAFO in Luang Prabang Province to provide overall day-\nto-day management and coordination of the Project. It will be headed by the national project \ndirector, assisted by an assistant director and support staff, and will form the regional arm of \nDLF\u2019s existing Project Management Division. The national project director will be responsible for \noverall project implementation and management. The national project director will coordinate \nwith the provinces and ensure the finalization of project work plans based on DAFEO and PAFO \nwork plans, budgets, and contracts. S/he will be responsible for finalization and submission of \nall progress reports and financial reports to DLF. Five provincial implementation units (PIUs), to \nbe established within the existing Livestock Section of each PAFO, will be set up to coordinate \nimplementation in each province. The PIUs (comprising existing Livestock Section personnel \nwhere resources are available to perform necessary functions, and possibly supplemental staff \nwhere resources are insufficient), will comprise one provincial coordinator (PAFO director on a \npart-time  basis),  one  full-time  officer  responsible  for  provincial  implementation,  and  the \nnecessary administrative support staff from the PAFO Administration Section. Project activities \nwill be incorporated into annual DAFEO work plans and collated into annual PAFO work plans, \nwhich will be approved by provincial authorities, the PCC, DLF, and subsequently MAF. Due to \nthe geographic location of the regional office, financial management will be effected through \nexisting staff from within the Administrative Division of DLF, who will be appointed to a National \nCoordination Office (NCO) in Vientiane. The NCO will undertake coordination regarding fund \nflows and financial reporting to the Ministry of Finance in order to facilitate ADB, IFAD loan \nwithdrawal and replenishments. In keeping with the push to harmonization of donor support with \nreceiving  countries  national  development  priorities,  institutions  and  procedures39,  Project \nmanagement structures are designed to work within existing institutional structures of national \nand provincial administrations to ensure sustainability after project completion. \n \n37.  The regional office, headed by the national project director, will work under the overall \ndirection of the national PSC, which will comprise representatives from NAFES, NAFRI, the \nministries  of  finance  and  foreign  affairs,  and  governors\u2019  representatives  from  participating \nprovinces. The PSC will meet on a semiannual basis or as required to approve and review \nannual project work plans and implementation progress; and advise on any outstanding issues. \nIt will receive consolidated progress reports and financial reports from the national project \ndirector. The Government will invite the participation of donors (ADB,SDC and IFAD) in the PSC \nas it deems fit. At the provincial level, PCCs convened by the provincial vice governors, drawing \nmembership from relevant provincial departments, mass organizations,will meet quarterly and \napprove annual PIU work plans and budgets (incorporated in the PAFO work plans), review \nimplementation, and guide provincial activities.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n38.  The implementation period will be 6 years from 2006 to 2012. The first year will be \ndedicated  to  setting  up  the  necessary  management  systems\u2014including  procurement, \naccounting, disbursement, and performance monitoring and evaluation\u2014and lay the foundation \nfor project implementation. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. Project activities will \ncommence in one target district per province. The Project will be implemented in phases, at first \nin districts with close proximity to where forage technologies were fostered under the Forages \nand Livestock Systems Project (para. 13) and where trained extension workers have been \nprepared under the Capacity Building for Smallholder Livestock Systems TA.40 There will also \n                                                 \n39 Refer to Rome Declaration on Harmonization.

Procurement \n39.  Goods and services financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Vehicles, equipment, materials, and services \nwill be procured by national competitive bidding (NCB) as the cost is valued from the equivalent \nof $100,000\u2013$500,000. Civil works comprise small contracts not exceeding $100,000, typically \nfor building renovation and construction of district and provincial office buildings as well as \nsmall-scale  infrastructure.  As  such,  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  NCB \nprocedures among private local contractors acceptable to ADB. Where there are few local \nsuppliers, equipment, materials, or services valued at less than the equivalent of $100,000 may \nbe procured by shopping, as will be the case for negotiated community facilitation contracts with \nappropriate individuals or organizations. Supply of veterinary medicines and vaccines must be \naccompanied by quality guarantee certificates. Supply of planting material and breeding stock \nfor smallholders will be procured by shopping with due consideration for quality assurance. The \nproject procurement plan is in Appendix 7 and final details will be determined during project \nimplementation as appropriate. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n40.  The Project will fund a total of 64 person-months41 of international consultants and \n40242 person-months of national consultants in both short and long-term assignments to be \nrecruited  through  a  firm.  The  level  of  consulting  services  identified  under  the  Project  is \nconsidered essential in view of the limited human resource capacities and technical expertise \navailable in the Government at central, provincial, and district levels. Consultant services are \nrequired to reorient extension workers to adopt a more participatory approach in understanding \nsmallholder problems and needs. This is necessary for extension workers to become more \nrelevant change agents in the diverse upland farming systems, where cultural and gender \nbarriers often pose a barrier to the adoption of improved livestock management practices. The \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Advance action for procurement of consulting services is proposed to minimize any \ndelay in commencement of project activities. A simplified technical proposal and quality and \ncost-based selection (QCBS) will be adopted. \n \n41.  In addition to the above, national consultant services will be provided to facilitate CDD \nthrough village based initiatives to train communities in group formation,  the operation and \nadministration  of  revolving  funds,  and  to  promote  increased  market  awareness  and  small \nenterprise development. While DAFEO staff have the potential to develop into effective change \nagents in areas of livestock production, they frequently lack the pro-poor and gender-responsive \nlivelihood development orientation required for community capacity building and revolving funds \nand  small  enterprise  development.  LWU  will  be  directly  selected,  based  on  its  unique \nexperience and outreach into remote villages in the project area. LWU will be the most effective \noption for the kind of work to be done, and will be contracted by the regional office using single \nsource selection (SSS) to provide consultant services under negotiated contracts.  \n                                                 \n41  In the fields of project management and rural development (15 person-months), rural poultry (3 person-months) \nextension training (20 person-months), community mobilization (6 person-months), monitoring and evaluation \n(6 person\u2013months), non-specified livestock as required (8 person-months), and marketing and trade development \n(6 person-months). In addition, it is proposed to include, under a draft proposal for submission to the JFPR, the \nservices of a cultural anthropologist to advise the Project on culturally appropriate approaches to the diverse ethnic \ngroups in the project area.  \n42 Consultant inputs are proposed in extension training (44 person-months), rural poultry production (50 person-\nmonths), and community development and gender (33 person-months), plus five provincially based extension \ntraining consultants in each province for 55 person-months. \n ", "16  \n5.  Anticorruption Measures \n42.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nrepresentatives of the Government of Lao PDR, and the EA. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the loan regulations/grant regulations and the bidding documents for the \nProject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \nExecuting Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project.The subsidiary records of fixed assets and stocks will be kept up to \ndate and reconciled with control accounts. Periodic physical inventories of fixed assets and \nstocks will be conducted. Except for vehicles, other assets will not be sufficiently covered by \ninsurance policies. The Project will establish controls and procedures for flow of funds, financial \ninformation, accountability, and audits to ensure that information among the different offices \nflows in an accurate and timely manner. It will also ensure that periodic reconciliations will be \nperformed among the different offices. The Project will also advise employees, beneficiaries, \nand other recipients to whom to report if they suspect fraud, waste, or misuse of project \nresources or property.  \n \n6.   Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n \n43.  The Ministry of Finance will establish two imprest accounts with the Bank of the Lao \nPDR on behalf of the Project after loan effectiveness\u2014one for the ADF IX loan and the other for \nthe IFAD loan. Both the imprest accounts will be subjected to the annual audit. The finance and \naccounting function of the Project will be staffed adequately. However, most staff will not be \nsufficiently qualified and experienced so the Project will provide training and written guidelines, \nespecially in following ADB procedures; and prepare written position descriptions that clearly \ndefine  duties,  responsibilities,  lines  of  supervision,  and  limits  of  authority  for  all  officers, \nmanagers,  and  staff.  The  following  responsibilities  will  be  performed  by  different  units  or \npersons: (i) authorization to execute a transaction; (ii) recording of the transaction; and (iii) \ncustody of assets involved in the transaction. The bank reconciliation will be prepared by \nsomeone other than those who approve payments. MAF has developed an accounting system \nthat allows for the proper recording of project financial transactions, including the allocation of \nexpenditures in accordance with the respective components, disbursement categories, and \nsources of funds. The Project will follow the system to support the harmonization for projects \nfunded by  various international funding agencies, and update the existing project financial \nmanual to be applicable for the Project and acceptable to ADB. Monthly and quarterly financial \nreports will be submitted by the EA to ADB. The accounts will be audited annually by an \nindependent auditor acceptable to ADB and audit reports will be forwarded to the Government \nand ADB not later than 6 months after the close of each financial reporting period to coincide \nwith the Lao PDR fiscal year (30 September).Monthly and quarterly financial reports will be \nsubmitted to ADB.  A project completion report will be submitted to the ADB within 3 months \nafter completion of the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n44.   To expedite disbursement, the Ministry of Finance will establish two imprest accounts \nwith the Bank of the Lao PDR as stated above in paragraph 43, on behalf of the Project after \nloan effectiveness\u2014one for the ADF IX loan and the other for the IFAD loan. The imprest \naccounts  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. The advance to be deposited to \neach of the imprest accounts will be based on an estimated 6 months of project expenditure or a \n ", "17 \nmaximum of 10% of the ADB/IFAD loan, whichever is lower. The Director of the Treasury \nDepartment of the Ministry of Finance will be the designated signatory to sign disbursement \norders based upon official requests from DLF. Ministry of Finance will provide operational costs \nto the regional office and the PIUs on a monthly basis based on approved workplans and \nbudgets. Assuming that conditions for use of the statement of expenditure procedures are met \n43, ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures may be used to reimburse expenditures and \nliquidate  the  imprest  accounts  for  all  individual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$100,000. The imprest accounts will be replenished and liquidated on a monthly basis to ensure \nliquidity of funds or when the accounts are drawn down by 20% of the initial deposit. The \nimprest accounts and statements of expenditure will be audited annually by auditors acceptable \nto ADB. The coordination staff of the National Coordination Office set up at the DLF, the \nregional  office,  and  five  PIUs  will  need  further  training in  financial management  and  ADB \nprocedures.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  operate  the  imprest  accounts  for  project-related \nexpenses in accordance with an annual work plan to be prepared by the regional office and/or \nDLF and approved by the PSC, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nThe ADF IX grant and the SDC grant will be disbursed by ADB in agreement with development \npartners and the EA44. Further details on the financial management of the Project are in \nAppendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n  8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n45.   Project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  undertaken  for  each  project \ncomponent to ensure that project facilities are managed efficiently and benefits are realized. \nSupport for designing PBME including local consultant support, will be provided to design and \nestablish computer-based BME procedures. A baseline survey, including both qualitative and \nquantitative research, will be undertaken upon the acceptance of each village entering the \nProject for which IFAD\u2019s Result and Impact Management System (RIMS) will be used. The \nRIMS contains two mandatory indicators to measure project impact: (i) a household asset index \n(as a proxy for poverty), and (ii) malnutrition among children less than 5 years. Other project \nimpact indicators may include female/male literacy, and access to safe water and adequate \nsanitation. There will be repeat surveys at midterm evaluation and project completion, using the \nsame methodology. \n \n9.  Project Review \n46.   The Government and ADB, along with the cofinancing partners IFAD and SDC, will \nundertake periodic project reviews (at least twice a year) of the Project to ensure smooth \nimplementation. IFAD will provide a pro-poor livestock consultant for these reviews. CGIAR \ninstitutions including the International Livestock Research Institute and CIAT based in Lao PDR \nwill be consulted from time to time (footnote 43). A comprehensive midterm review will be \ncarried out to critically review project performance. The midterm review will address the actual \nphysical and financial progress of the Project, social and gender impacts, progress in the \nimplementation of the EGDP, implementation procedures, procurement performance, as well as \ncompliance with loan covenants, among others. In particular, it will include an assessment of the \nProject\u2019s likelihood of fulfilling its expected outcomes by project completion. \n \n                                                 \n43 ADB. 2001.

PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n47.   Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Livelihoods. The Project will impact positively on \nthe  incomes  of  at  least  17,000  ethnic  households  in  408  villages  by  improving  livestock \nproduction and marketing.It will also have positive impacts on household incomes of at least \nanother  1,500  households  in  additional  250  villages.  Income  increases  are  expected  to \napproximately $1,400 per beneficiary household per annum. At least 50% of all beneficiaries are \nlikely to be poor households that currently suffer from food shortages and lack of cash incomes \nfor meeting basic requirements. The Project will improve social and human capital and, by \nsupporting  CDD,  will  help  to  create  greater  opportunities  for  participation  in  livelihood \nimprovement by sections that have been marginalized until now, particularly upland ethnic \ngroups and women. The Project will develop human capital in terms of production knowledge, \nmanagement practices, extension approaches, among others, at the level of institutions such as \nDAFEO and PAFOs. \n \n48.   The proportional benefit within the ethnic groups will vary according to their interest and \ncapacity  to  assimilate  project  technologies.  Ethnic  groups  will  benefit  from  appropriate \ntechnology transfer, group formation and provision of financial services and village infrastructure \ndevelopment. Women in particular are expected to benefit from training and improved access to \nresources and markets.It will promote socially inclusive development, and address gender gaps \namong these communities for access to resources and opportunities. It will facilitate private \nsector development in livestock production and trade.  Highly pathogenic avian influenza is not \nexpected to be a risk in the hilly and thinly populated areas of the Project.  \n \nB.  Environment Impacts \n \n49.   The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination  shows  that  the  overall  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  are  expected  to \ngenerate  substantial  environmental  benefits.  Potential  positive  impacts  include  potential \nstabilization  of  shifting  cultivation  because  of  improved  livestock  productivity  and  resulting \nstability  of  income;  and  improved  hygiene  and  environmental  health  through  waste \nmanagement, disease control, and controlled animal movements. Since the Project aims to \nimprove animal productivity from improved inputs and efficient use of land and resources, only a \nsmall increase of livestock numbers is anticipated. Appropriate manure and waste management \nwill reduce the risks of water pollution. Soil and water quality testing will be conducted to monitor \nquality and develop any necessary measures to minimize negative impacts. \n \nC.   Economic and Financial  \n50.  The  Project  addresses  technological,  information,  human  capital,  and  infrastructure \ndeficiencies that prevent the realization of the full potential of livestock farming in the northern \nprovinces of Lao PDR. The project interventions are consistent with the development priorities \nof MAF. The representative livestock models, developed to analyze the financial and economic \nfeasibility, show that pig and cattle fattening and goat and poultry breeding are financially \nprofitable  for  the  adopting  households.  Proposed  technological  packages  for  each  type  of \nlivestock either reduce or maintain the current labor allocation for livestock activities while \nsignificantly  improving  labor  productivity  and  returns  for  labor.  With  and  without-project \ncomparisons  show  that  the  Project  enables  poor  households  to  come  out  of  poverty \npermanently by adopting new production and management technologies. About 50% of the \nbeneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  poor  and  most  of  them  belong  to  upland  ethnic  groups. \nSuccessful  implementation  of  the  village  revolving  funds\u2014targeting  the  poor,  women,  and \nethnic  groups  who  do  not  have  initial  capital  to  undertake  livestock  rearing  activities\u2014will \nincrease the percentage of poor benefiting from the Project significantly. \n ", "19 \n \n51.  The economic analysis of the Project estimates the net present value at KN27.5 billion at \na discount rate of 12% over a 25-year period. This indicates that the project benefits far exceed \nits  cost.  Further,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  to  be  17.2%,  which  is \nsignificantly higher than the cost of capital. Sensitivity analysis shows that these results are \nrobust to changes in the key variables of delayed benefits, increased costs, and reduced \nadoption rates of proposed technologies. The project performance is sensitive to price changes \nof livestock products. However, in the face of increasing demand for livestock and livestock \nproducts  in  Lao  PDR  and  neighboring  countries,  price  declines  below  current  levels  are \nextremely unlikely, particularly for large ruminants. Overall, the economic analysis shows that \nthe proposed Project is a sound investment for Lao PDR that will generate significantly higher \nbenefits than the incurred costs. A summary economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \nV.  SPECIFIC ASSURANCES \nA.   Special Assurances \n \n52.   In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  also  given  specific \nassurances that have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n(i)  Only suitably qualified organizations and /or individuals will be engaged through \nconsultancy  contracts,  to  provide  capacity  building  and  support  to  upland \ncommunities for CDD. \n(ii)  The Project will promote women's participation in village based training programs \nto incorporate approximately half of all trainees. \n(iii)  The Project will encourage women's representation and participation in revolving \nfund groups up to at least 50% of all beneficiaries. \n(iv)  All implementing agencies will fully comply with the EGDP in keeping with ADB\u2019s \npolicy on indigenous peoples.45 \n(v)  All implementing agencies will ensure that land to be acquired for any small-scale \ncivil works in villages and district centers is clear of occupation and not under any \nuse as defined by ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.  \n(vi)  In addition, all implementing agencies will fully comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard  \npolicies related to involuntary resettlement46 and the environment47. \n(vii)  The Project will comply with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy48, particularly in respect \nof the sections of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  that  relate  to  fraud  and  corruption.  The  Project  will \naccordingly develop adequate safeguards to protect assets from fraud, wastage, \nand abuse.   \n \n53.

In 2003, the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) requested \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  finance  a  project \npreparatory TA for the formulation of a livestock development project directed at reducing \npoverty in some of the poorest districts of the northern region of Lao PDR.  \n \n2.  ADB  approved  the  TA  on  18  December  2003,  simultaneously  preselecting  the \nInternational  Center  for  Tropical  Agriculture  (CIAT)  in  association  with  the  International \nLivestock Research Institute to undertake the study.  \n \n3.  The design team was mobilized on 27 September 2004 and submitted an inception \nreport on 31 October 2004, an interim report on 31 March 2005, and a draft final report on 3 \nJune 2005. Following each of these progress reports, tripartite meetings were conducted with \nthe Government, ADB, and the consultants to provide guidance for subsequent design activities.  \n \n4.  After submission of the draft final report, additional inputs were provided from ADB-\nappointed consultants, particularly on social, gender, and environmental aspects. Continued \nconsultations by the team were conducted with relevant government agencies\u2014Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF),  Department  of  Livestock  and  Fisheries  (DLF),  National \nAgriculture  and  Forestry  Research  Institute  (NAFRI),  National  Agriculture  and  Forestry \nExtension Service (NAFES), as well as provincial and district administrations.  \n \n5.  A  series  of  provincial  visits  were  undertaken  to  discuss  final  design  issues  with \nparticipating provincial agriculture and forestry office (PAFO) staff and representatives from the \ntarget district agriculture and forestry extension offices (DAFEO). Detailed description of project \nobjectives, activities, and implementation arrangements were discussed.  \n \n6.  Following  these  discussions,  a  final  report  was  submitted  by  the  consultant  to  the \nGovernment and ADB in July 2005. This was circulated to ADB senior management, after which \nthe fielding of the loan fact-finding mission was authorized.  \n \n7.  The  Management  review  meeting  was  held  on  14  March  2006.

Nationally, agriculture remains the most important sector in the economy, contributing \n48.6% of gross domestic product (GDP)1 and 19% of the value of total commodity exports \n(mainly  timber,  wooden  products,  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  coffee).  It  employs  86%  of  the \nworkforce in a population of 5.68 million, of whom 80\u201385% reside in rural areas. An estimated \n627,000 households are located in rural areas (72% of the 2002/03 population);2 of these, an \nestimated  80%  practice  small-scale,  subsistence  agriculture  in  diverse  agroecological \nenvironments comprising both irrigated and rain-fed farming systems, the latter by far the more \nsignificant. Within the farming systems, the dominant activity is subsistence rice production. In \nthe south, tree crops and vegetables are grown extensively in the upland plateaus to generate \ncash. In all areas, livestock provide draught power, dietary protein, a store for family wealth (a \nreserve or safety net in the event of family disaster), and cash income to pay for household \nexpenses. Livestock are also important for ceremonial and social occasions. \n \n2.  Within agriculture, cropping is the main activity\u2014contributing 57% of agricultural GDP \ncompared to 36% for livestock and fisheries and 7% for forestry. Cropping is dominated by rice \nwith 2.5 million tons produced in 2004, 2.3 million tons (78%) from lowland areas and the \nremaining 0.2 million tons from rain-fed upland areas. Some 14% of total rice production comes \nfrom irrigated paddy land. The area of rice harvested in 2004 was 770,300 hectares (ha), of \nwhich  10%  comprised  irrigated  paddy  land  and  14%  nonirrigated  upland.3 Upland  rice \nproduction has declined steadily in response to government policy to reduce shifting cultivation, \ndeclining by about 30,000 ha per year over the past 3 years. Other field and industrial crops \ngrown include coffee, maize, peanuts, cassava, sugar cane, and tobacco, which each have \nplanted  areas  in  excess  of  5,000  ha.  In  addition,  large  areas  are  planted  to  fruit  trees \n(particularly  bananas)  and  other  vegetable  crops.  Lao  PDR  is  now  self-sufficient  in  rice \nproduction for its population, which is increasing by about 2.8% per annum. \n \n1.  Livestock Subsector \n \n3.  The contribution of livestock to agricultural GDP has increased steadily over the past \n10 years in response to increasing prices and export and domestic demand. Cattle, buffalo, and \npig numbers have remained relatively static during that period (Table A4.1). Pig numbers have \ndeclined in the north, mainly in Bokeo and Oudomxay, while numbers in commercial enterprises \nhave  remained  static  at  0.2  million.  Numbers  of  household  poultry  have  increased  from \n15.3 million in 2002 to 18.5 million in 2004 whereas commercial poultry numbers declined from \n1 million to 3 million over the same period, possibly in response to the threat of avian influenza. \nCommercial production units are found on the periphery of urban Vientiane and Luang Prabang \nand other provincial capitals. These intensive units depend almost entirely on imported parent \nand growing stock, feed, and veterinary supplies. \n \n4.  Livestock production systems vary widely throughout the country and between lowland \nand upland areas where animals are kept for different purposes, since livestock rearing and \ncropping  activities  are  integrated  and  complementary  activities.  Livestock  provide  organic \nmanure (sometimes composted) and draught power (mainly buffalo) for soil preparation while \ncattle and buffalo are used to transport goods collected from forest areas and produce grown in \nsmallholder plots, to villages and markets. \n                                                 \n1  National Statistics Centre. 2003.

In return, cattle, buffalo, pigs, and goats graze on recently harvested crop areas, or are \nfed  by-products  from  rice  milling,  especially  bran  and  broken  grain,  as  part  of  their  diet. \nProduction systems are typically low input and low output, with animals confined at certain times \nof the year\u2014during the wet season to protect the crops or when they may need closer attention, \ntypically during perinatal periods or when animals are sick. Otherwise, uncontrolled grazing and \nforaging with minimal supervision (the most common practice) exposes animals to attacks by \npredators, disease, theft, and even death from road accidents. Over 95% of all livestock are \nproduced by smallholders from an average farm size of just over 1 ha. The sale of cattle, \nbuffalo, pigs, and poultry accounts for about 50% of the annual household cash incomes in \nupland areas.4 Therefore, livestock enterprises are important livelihood activities in rural areas \nand have the potential to improve household incomes and reduce poverty. \n \n6.  Marketing patterns vary between species, with the smaller animals (poultry, pigs, and \ngoats) being slaughtered and consumed closer to the area in which they are produced. Large \nruminants are walked or transported greater distances by vehicle to urban centers within the \ncountry and across borders to People\u2019s Republic of China, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Like the rest \nof  Southeast  Asia,  per  capita  consumption  of  both  red  and  white  meat5 is  increasing  as \ndisposable incomes increase and urban populations grow. Export demand, particularly for live \ncattle and buffaloes, is increasing steadily and is currently estimated at 100,000 head per \nannum in Thailand (20% of their live cattle and buffalo imports) and Viet Nam across borders \nwith few controls. There is also a significant unrecorded and uncontrolled trade in animal hides \nand skins with Thailand. Increased awareness of the dangers associated with live animal and \nanimal product trade has focused greater attention on quarantine procedures in Lao PDR, which \n                                                 \n4  ADB.2002.

In 2002/03, monthly household consumption was estimated at \nKN1.1 million. Food represented 55% and meat consumption, both home-produced and purchased, was 22.3%, \nwhich represented an increase from 16.1% in 1997/98 (Data extracted from LECS III Survey, Chapter 3)  \n ", "30      Appendix 4 \nwill most likely result in additional sanitary and phytosanitory regulations being imposed by \nimporting countries. Lao PDR must respond to these if it is to supply this rapidly growing market \nin the longer term. Livestock marketing is chaotic, with price signals failing to be passed on to \nproducers. Many traders (some of them opportunist) in rural areas play an important role in \nlinking producers to domestic and international markets. These links are often corrupted by local \nadministrations in their attempt to apply illegal controls to preserve the area\u2019s breeding herd \nwhich, at least in the case of large ruminants, they perceive to be threatened by live trade. \n \na.  Production Systems \n \n7.  Livestock production is predominantly a smallholder activity in mixed farming systems \nwhere crop production and livestock rearing are integrated in complex ways, each making \ndemands on the limited land, labor, and capital of smallholders as they pursue subsistence \nlivelihood activities. The role of livestock in these farming systems is critical for generating cash \nincomes  and  providing  food  security,  particularly  in  the  resource  poor  upland  households. \nConstraints in the upland production systems are expressed through low growth rates, greater \nsusceptibility to infectious and parasitic diseases (often with high mortalities), low fertility rates, \nlow off-take rates, depressed farm gate prices. These are the outcomes of generally less than \noptimal  use  of  resources  allocated  to  livestock  enterprises,  generating  low  returns  from \nsmallholder inputs. About 74% of villagers raise pigs, 8% raise goats, 31% raise cattle, 41% \nraise buffalo, and 90% raise poultry. Livestock management varies from extensive systems \nwhere animals are allowed to scavenge around houses in the village and surrounding forest \nareas, to partial and even complete confinement in the case of pigs to prevent damage to crops \nor for disease control. Some smallholders keep their pigs outside the village area where the \nthreat of disease is lower. Even under partial free range conditions, pig production is very labor\u2013\nintensive, with supplementary feed being collected from forest areas, prepared (usually boiled), \nand fed on a daily basis. Cattle are less labor demanding and animals are often released to the \nforests  for  free  grazing  so  they  remain  away  from  cropped  areas,  only  being  confined  at \nparturition or when animals are sick. Buffaloes are grazed closer to the village for draught \npower. Goats and chickens roam the village area at will. \n \nb.  Sector Performance \n \n8.  The most easily collected and reliable indicator of overall productivity of a flock or herd is \nthe mortality rate. Less obvious are the nonfatal effects on production from disease and poor \nnutrition on surviving females, which are less capable of conceiving and carrying a calf while \nsurviving males are also less fertile. Mortality rates have been estimated at 10\u201320% for young \nbuffalo, 5\u201310% for young cattle, 20\u201325% for pigs, and 25\u201335% for poultry, resulting from \nirregular epidemic disease outbreaks which are common. \n \n9.  Sustained low growth rates, high incidence of disease, and low fertility rates indicate that \nthe sector\u2019s performance has been disappointing, and highlight opportunities for improvement. \nMarket signals of increased demand for livestock products are not being translated into benefits \nfor producers; or, if they are, the risk associated with increasing production to meet this demand \nis  too  high  for  the  majority  of  smallholders  to  respond.  Market  linkages  have  not  been \nsufficiently  developed  to  encourage  smallholders  to  produce  at  levels  that  exceed  their \nimmediate subsistence requirements. In addition, incremental production is difficult to achieve \nwhen the feeding strategies used are essentially laissez-faire (with the exception of pigs) and \nlabor  resources  available  in  smallholder  households  limit  smallholder  ability  to  consider \nincreased production. Without a significant change in the orientation of smallholder production \nsystems, the future scenario will be a continuation of this constrained and inefficient extensive \nlivestock subsector. \n \n ", "                                                                                                         Appendix 4       31 \n10.  Performance  at  the  international  level  appears  more  successful  although  less  well-\ndocumented because of the unofficial nature of the trade. It is clear that traders are active in \nsourcing large animals in the north for trade with Thailand and Viet Nam, to the extent that \nprovincial administrations have decided to restrict the movement of breeder stock because they \nare concerned at the loss of breeding capacity in large ruminant herds. \n \nc.  Constraints to Production \n11.  The  major  constraints  to  increasing  livestock  production  include:  (i)  limited  labor \nresources available in households to collect sufficient supplementary feeding; (ii) incidence and \nfrequency of diseases; (iii) low fertility of breeding animals of all species; (iv) limited smallholder \nknowledge of livestock production and management techniques; and (v) limited access to input \nsupplies, animal health and production services, and markets. \n \n12.  In upland areas, smallholders do not always identify feed as a major constraint in \nimproving livestock productivity despite the time taken to herd animals to and from distant \ngrazing areas and to collect and prepare feed for confined animals, particularly in the dry \nseason.  Poor  nutrition  results  in  poor  animal  production  and  contributes  to  lower  animal \nresistance to disease. The high incidence of livestock disease has been attributed to: (i) poor \nnutrition  and  sanitation,  (ii)  uncontrolled  movement  of  animals,  (iii)  movement  of  diseased \nanimals, (iv) lack of correct disease diagnoses, (v) poor access to information on how to control \nand treat diseases, (vi) restricted coverage of and ineffective vaccines, (vii) weak veterinary \nsupport services, and (viii) inappropriate management practices. While there is a great deal of \nexperience and local knowledge in rearing livestock, management skills are lacking and their \nknowledge  of  the  cause  of  disease  and  the  measures  to  protect  against  disease  are \nnonexistent. Technical information is difficult or impossible to access in the right medium or \nlanguage. It needs to be delivered by extension workers and/or commercial interests who are \ntrained in learning techniques and information sharing. Existing extension services are under-\nresourced and has limited skills since personnel has limited technical knowledge of livestock \nproduction and animal health. \n \n13.  Two aspects of market access constrain livestock development: (i) lack of physical \naccess imposed by the rugged terrain, and (ii) institutional barriers that interfere with the price \nmechanism under free market conditions. While cattle, buffalo, and even pigs can be walked \nlong  distances  to  collection  points  on  national  routes  where  lower  transport  rates  apply, \nsmallholders become price receivers after investing time and effort to relocate their animals, and \nare reluctant to make the return journey with unsold animals (usually in poorer condition). Local \nregulations  require  complex  procedures  for  approval  to  move  animals  from,  or  through, \nprovinces that have promoted the establishment of trading cartels, enabling collusive behavior \nwhen dealing with ill-informed producers.  \n \n14.  The Government\u2019s disease monitoring activities are constrained by limited budgets, and \nsmallholders have limited capacity to pay for diagnostic services as they do not see value in \nthese services. Difficult terrain leads to poor quality vaccines (no cold chain) being administered \nby poorly trained village veterinary workers, leading to a lack of confidence in preventative \ntreatments for livestock. The landlocked nature of the country makes it difficult to enforce \nquarantine regulations as borders are extremely porous, adding to threat of the spread of \ndisease. The Government is committed to retain domestic production of vaccines, but it is not \ncompetitive because of the comparatively low capacity so it is a high cost producer. It is also \nconstrained by limited funds for its operation, which make quality control difficult in spite of \nattempts to conform to standards of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

The Project is designed to improve smallholder livelihoods in upland areas through \nlivestock development. To examine the possible financial and economic impacts of the Project, \na  selection  of  indicative  household  livestock  enterprises  are  examined  comparing  \u201cwithout \nproject\u201d and \u201cwith project\u201d situations to estimate incremental production and income from project \ninitiatives. The \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201c Project increments are extrapolated, based on (i) anticipated \nadoption rates of the technologies, and (ii) the number and size of villages that are expected to \nbe impacted. \n \n2.  In the northern Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), smallholders use a wide \nvariety of approaches to raising their livestock. A general characteristic of the present practice is \nthat animal feed is inadequate in quality, if not in quantity. Animals are often allowed to range \nfree to find their own food or, if confined for a period, feed must be found in the forest and \ncarried back to an animal enclosure. As a result, diet is generally unbalanced and animal health \nand growth rates are poor. The Project will introduce a package of technologies to improve \nlivestock productivity, including cultivation of forage to improve animal nutrition, better disease \ncontrol,  better  animal  management  practices  such  as  selection  of  breeding  stock,  better \nhousing, and weaning and culling practices. It can be expected that households which choose \nto adopt project technologies will do so in a variety of ways. Therefore, the indicative livestock \nmodels included in this financial and economic analysis are abstractions from the wide variety of \nexisting livestock management practices and the various ways in which households may adopt \nnew technologies. Four models have been developed for pigs, goats, cattle (representing large \nruminants), and chickens (representing poultry in general). \n \nA.  Methodology \n3.  To  develop  the  various  livestock  enterprise  models,  certain  assumptions  are  made \nregarding future practice (both \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d the Project) and about the valuation of inputs \nand outputs. In order to assess the Project\u2019s contributions to the economy of Lao PDR, financial \nvalues  have  been  converted  into  economic  equivalents.  Basic  assumptions  for  such \nconversions include: (i) the use of a domestic price numeraire; (ii) for tradable commodities \n(food grains and fertilizers), economic values are based on border parity prices; (iii) for non-\ntraded goods and services, a standard conversion factor of 0.9 is used; (iv) for rural labor, a \nshadow wage rate factor of 0.8 is used, reflecting the low productivity of rural labor in the area; \nand (v) transfer payments, such as taxes and subsidies, are excluded in the calculation of \neconomic  values.  It  was  assumed  that  the  production  increases  are  not  large  enough  to \nsuppress prices. \n \nB.  Indicative Household Livestock Models \n \n  1.  Pig Fattening \n4.  Pigs are raised in 77% of rural households in northern Lao PDR.1 While the breeding of \nfree range pigs is common, pig fattening is a growing practice. Building on this situation, a \nmodel of \u201cwith\u201d versus \u201cwithout\u201d Project pig fattening has been developed. One reason for this \nselection is that it can be accessible to the poorest smallholders who have limited means to \npurchase animals. Such poor households can provide the labor and feed inputs for pig owners \n                                                 \n1  From  the  comprehensive  village  data  collected  by  the  District  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Extension  Offices \n(DAFEOs), 2003. \n ", "42  Appendix 9 \nand  share  in  the  profits.  For  households  that  prefer  to  breed  (rather  than  fatten)  pigs, \nimprovements similar to those for pig fattening can also be expected from forage technologies. \n \n5.  The difference between the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d Project scenarios is due to the increased \nlabor efficiency that enables additional pigs to be reared as well as the shorter period to achieve \nmarketable weights (from 6-12 months). Under the \u201cwithout\u201d Project scenario, the financial gross \nmargin (revenue less cash inputs) is KN0.4 million per year, a return per labor day of KN3,729 . \nIf labor inputs are valued at their market price, net revenue is actually negative. With the Project, \nthe annual gross margin (includes two cycles of fattened pigs) increases to KN4.2 million and \nthe return per labor day to KN59,802. Net revenue becomes positive at KN3.5 million per year. \nIncremental household financial net revenue is KN4.2 million) when comparing the \u201cwith\u201d and \n\u201cwithout\u201d  Project situations.  In  economic  terms,  incremental  net  revenue  of  this  household \nenterprise  is  KN3.7  million.  Project-wide,  assuming  that  at  full  implementation  13%  of  the \nhouseholds in project villages adopt the improved technology, financial incremental net revenue \nper year from pigs is expected to be $1.15 million. In economic terms, this annual increment \nwould be $1.01 million. \n \n  2.  Cattle Fattening \n6.  About 32% of households in the target districts raise cattle and 43% raise buffalo.2 \nTypically, the animals are allowed to graze freely requiring minimal herding (labor) input. Growth \nis slow and animals are kept well beyond the time when they could best be sold. Cattle, even \nmore than other livestock, are kept more as a store of wealth than as a source of income. Some \nhouseholds, however, are now buying young cattle to hold until they are ready for sale. A model \nof cattle fattening has been selected here for reasons similar to those used in the case of pigs. \nAs with pigs, those households that prefer to breed cattle rather than fatten them should be able \nto experience similar benefit levels because of the adoption of forage technologies and other \nlivestock management technologies. \n \n7.  The difference between the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d Project scenarios is due to the level of \nlabor  required  to  confine,  feed,  and  water  animals  compared  to  the  current  laissez-faire \nsituation. Given the shortages of household labor, substitution is needed from an alternate \nactivity\u2014assumed to be upland maize cropping\u2014to make labor resources available for fattening \nof cattle. The production of forages also has associated labor requirements for cutting and \nfeeding but, with the higher nutritional value, it is possible (i) to increase the number of head \nfattened from three to five, and (ii) for market condition to be achieved in 12 rather than \n24 months. A household cattle fattening operation without the Project is likely to have a financial \ngross margin of KN3.6 million per year and a return per labor day of KN19,946. Net revenue \n(including labor costs) would be KN2.7 million. With the Project, gross margin would increase to \nKN11.1 million and return per labor day would rise to KN53,728. Net revenue would become \nKN9.1  million  per  year.  Incremental  household  financial  net  revenue,  when  including  one \nhectare (ha) of maize as an additional \u201cwithout\u201d Project activity, is KN6.2 million ($605). In \neconomic  terms,  incremental  net  revenue  for  this  household  cattle  enterprise  would  be \nKN5.5 million ($532). By including an allowance for the maize that would no longer be grown, \ncattle fattening results in annual incremental net revenue of KN8.8 million ($852). For the entire \nProject,  assuming  that  8.4%  of  the  households  adopt  the  improved  technologies  at  full \nimplementation, financial incremental net revenue per year from cattle fattening is expected to \n                                                 \n2  This information is derived from the comprehensive village data collected by DAFEOs in 2005. Many households \nraise both cattle and buffalo. \n ", "  Appendix 9  43 \nbe  KN13.4  billion  ($1.30  million).  In  economic  terms,  this  annual  increment  would  be \nKN11.8 million ($1.14 million). \n \n  3.  Goat Breeding \n8.  At present, 8% of households in the target districts raise goats. Goat rearing is becoming \nmore popular and there are opportunities to increase goat productivity through the introduction \nof  forage  and  other  technologies.  \u201cWith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  Project  scenarios  are  based  on  a \nbreeding model in which the number of goats increases under the influence of assumed growth \nrates, mortality rates, and kidding intervals that are achievable given the proposed interventions. \nThe model compares a 4 doe \u2018without Project\u2019 breeding model with an 18 doe \u2018with Project\u2019 \nmodel. This increase is due to application of the new technological packages together with more \nlabor efficiencies for goat rearing enterprises. \n \n9.  The financial gross margin enterprise in the \u201cwithout\u201d Project scenario is KN0.7 million a \nyear (from the second year). The return to labor is KN9,931 per day, which is about the level of \nthe rural wage rate. Including the cost of labor (at the rural wage rate), the net revenue for the \nenterprise  is  about  zero.  \u201cWith\u201d  the  Project,  on  the  other  hand,  gross  margin  per  year  is \nKN4.0 million, the return per labor day is KN40,829, and enterprise net revenue improves to \nKN3.6 million per year. Annual incremental household financial net revenue is KN3.6 million \n($352).  In  economic  terms,  incremental  net  revenue  for  this  smallholder  enterprise  is \nKN3.2 million ($311). As is the case for large ruminants, the models assume that another \nenterprise (maize) will be reduced given the limitations on family labor. When comparing the net \neffect of goat breeding results in financial terms, it is expected to contribute to an annual \nfinancial  incremental  net  revenue  of  KN3.5  million  ($337)\u2014and  economic  incremental  net \nrevenue of KN3.1 million ($303) per year. For the entire project area, assuming that at full \nimplementation 3.6% of the households adopt the improved goat breeding enterprises, financial \nincremental revenue per year from goats will be KN2.7 billion ($0.27 million). In economic terms, \nthis annual increment would be KN2.5 billion ($0.24 million). \n \n  4.  Chicken Breeding \n10.  Almost all (93%) rural households raise chickens or other poultry, depending on market \naccess. For the most part, these birds range freely around the village scavenging on whatever \nthey can find. Their numbers are, in part, limited by this scavenging feed resource base, while \noccasional outbreaks of Newcastle Disease and Fowl Cholera temporarily destroy village flocks. \nThe feed utilized is of low quality but has little cost\u2014a very real advantage for poor households. \nGiven the risks involved in raising poultry, significant investment in improving poultry production \nis  probably  beyond  the  means  of  most  smallholders.  As  a  result,  the  Project  is  likely  to \nencourage the adoption of more modest chicken housing and management techniques, while \nthe scavenging feed resource base remains the source of feed. \n \n11.  The \u201cwithout\u201d Project scenario, with production in 3 out of every 4 years, would generate \nan average household financial gross margin of KN0.5 million per year. Financial net revenue \n(after accounting for the small amount of household labor involved) would be KN0.4 million. \n\u201cWith\u201d the Project, gross margin would increase to KN1.1 million and net financial revenue to \nKN1.0  million.  Incremental  net  revenue,  then,  would  be  KN0.54  million  ($52)  per  year  in \nfinancial terms and KN0.46 million ($44) in economic terms. Project-wide, assuming that at full \nimplementation 50% of households adopt the \u201cwith\u201d Project poultry management improvements, \nan increment in financial net revenue can be expected to be KN6.0 billion ($0.59 million). \nEconomic incremental net revenue would be KN5.0 billion ($0.5 million). \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \n12.  The four representative models described above show that adoption of the proposed \ntechnological package is financially profitable. Therefore, there is adequate profit incentive for \nhouseholds to adopt the proposed technological packages. \n  \nC.  Economic Analysis \n  1.  Adoption of Project Interventions \n13.  It has been assumed that smallholders previously raising a particular type of animal are \nmore likely to adopt new technologies than households not previously raising that species. In \naddition, a limit of 25% has been placed (in this analysis) on the total of the project village \nhouseholds adopting any of the larger animal (pig, goat, or cattle) interventions. The resultant \nfull population adoption of the improved pig technology is 13%, 3.6% for goats, and 8.4% for \ncattle. The adoption rate for the modestly improved poultry technology has been assumed to be \n25%  by  itself\u2014very  possibly  involving  many  or  all  of  the  adopters  of  the  larger  animal \nmanagement improvements. \n \n  2.  Project Benefits \n \n14.  The project-wide incremental economic benefits of the household adopters of the pig, \ngoat,  cattle,  and  chicken  improved  technologies  (Table  A9.1)  can  be  aggregated  and \nextrapolated through the years of expected project life to create a benefit cash flow These \nincremental benefits increase over the first several years as extension worker capacities are \ndeveloped and new villages are introduced to the Project, and the adoption of new technologies \nextends within existing villages. \n \nTable A9.1: Financial and Economic Benefit Estimates \n \nLivestock Holding Statistics                   Poultry          Pigs         Goats          Cattle \n \nProportion of HHs with animalsa  93% 77% 9%  32%\nAverage number of animals per HH with animalsa 15.5 3.7 3.9  3.4\nFinancial Incremental Returns per Household for Indicative Animal Enterprises (Kip)\nHouseholds previously raising a type of animal\nIncremental Net Revenue per year     538,610   4,221,759     3 ,621,331   6 ,229,450\nIncremental Gross Margin per year     573,610   3,839,396     3 ,261,331   6 ,203,345\nIncremental Return per Labor Day     51,305    56,073      3 0,898    3 0,208\nHouseholds not previously raising a type of animalc\nIncremental Net Revenue per year    3,387,659     3 ,467,331   8 ,770,650\nIncremental Gross Margin per year    2,897,796     2 ,627,331   8 ,444,545\nIncremental Return per Labor Day     48,561      2 9,587    3 1,244\nEconomic Incremental Returns per Household for Indicative Animal Enterprises (Kip)\nHouseholds previously raising a type of animal\nIncremental Net Revenue per year     456,799   3,717,887     3 ,206,007   5 ,479,221\nIncremental Gross Margin per year     484,799   3,411,996     2 ,918,007   5 ,458,337\nIncremental Return per Labor Day     42,243    49,691      2 7,632    2 6,588\nHouseholds not previously raising a type of animalc\nIncremental Net Revenue per year    2,889,509     3 ,124,507   7 ,702,095\nIncremental Gross Margin per year    2,497,619     2 ,212,507   7 ,441,211\nIncremental Return per Labor Day     42,345      2 5,328  27,116\n \nSources: Government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "  Appendix 9  45 \n    3.  Project Costs \n15.  In financial terms, project costs total $15.4 million (KN158.5 billion), which includes \ntaxes, price contingencies, and other factors which do not reflect economic values in 2005 \ncurrency  terms.  After  adjusting  for  these  factors,  this  total  cost  becomes  $12.4  million \n(KN127.7 billion), spread over the 6 years of implementation. After the implementation period, \nthere will also be operation and maintenance costs for some project-related infrastructure.3 All \ncosts over the years of project life form a cost cash flow. \n \n  4.  Economic Project Returns \n \n16.  The Project\u2019s net economic revenue cash flow can be calculated from the benefit and \ncost cash flows. Given the increments calculated in the various indicative animal enterprise \nmodels  and  the  assumed  adoption  rates  of  the  improved  technologies,  the  economic  net \npresent value is KN27.5 billion ($2.8 million), assuming a discount rate of 12%. The economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 17.2% (Table A9.2), indicating that the Project has the potential \nto be a sound investment for the Government. \n \nTable A9.2: Economic Revenue Cash Flows \nLao PDR Kip (\u201910,000s) \n              Project      Economic \n   Project Benefits     Costs     Cash Flow \n    Large               \n    Ruminants    Poultry           \n   Pigs  (Cattle)  Goats  (Chickens)  Total             \n  Incremental  Incremental  Incremental  Incremental  Incremental  Sens       \n  Economic  Economic  Economic  Economic  Economic  Switch       \n   Net Revenue  Net Revenue  Net Revenue  Net Revenue  Net Revenue  Plus           \nYear                 exchange          \n1        10,211          (2,362)            (506)         (6,165)             1,179   1.03  2,515,166    (2,513,987) \n2        50,117           6,459          (9,089)       (14,838)            32,649   1.03  1,686,986    (1,654,338) \n3       139,875         52,680        (15,248)       (13,665)          163,642   1.03  1,761,516    (1,597,875) \n4       299,912        161,027        (17,845)        10,407           453,501   1.03  1,751,484    (1,297,983) \n5       522,218        380,782        (13,743)        99,028           988,285   1.03  2,073,499    (1,085,214) \n6       690,796        653,513         63,195        247,643        1,655,148   1.03  2,725,543    (1,070,395) \n7       932,101        962,152        128,234        396,580        2,419,067   1.03  71,055    2,348,012 \n8    1,015,118     1,118,503        173,794        480,773        2,788,187   1.03  71,055    2,717,133 \n9    1,041,321     1,175,171        195,902        506,032        2,918,426   1.03  71,055    2,847,371 \n10    1,041,321     1,175,171        209,076        506,032        2,931,600   1.03  71,055      2,860,546 \n11    1,041,321     1,175,171        232,217        506,032        2,954,741   1.03  71,055    2,883,687 \n12    1,041,321     1,175,171        245,673        506,032        2,968,197   1.03  71,055    2,897,143 \n13    1,041,321     1,175,171        240,818        506,032        2,963,342   1.03  71,055    2,892,287 \n14    1,041,321     1,175,171        233,393        506,032        2,955,917   1.03  71,055    2,884,863 \n15    1,041,321     1,175,171        224,227        506,032        2,946,751   1.03  71,055    2,875,696 \n16    1,041,321     1,175,171        232,217        506,032        2,954,741   1.03  71,055    2,883,687 \n17    1,041,321     1,175,171        245,673        506,032        2,968,197   1.03  71,055    2,897,143 \n18    1,041,321     1,175,171        240,818        506,032        2,963,342   1.03  71,055    2,892,287 \n19    1,041,321     1,175,171        233,393        506,032        2,955,917   1.03  71,055    2,884,863 \n20    1,041,321     1,175,171        224,227        506,032        2,946,751   1.03  71,055    2,875,696 \n21    1,041,321     1,175,171        232,217        506,032        2,954,741   1.03  71,055    2,883,687 \n22    1,041,321     1,175,171        245,673        506,032        2,968,197   1.03  71,055    2,897,143 \n23    1,041,321     1,175,171        240,818        506,032        2,963,342   1.03  71,055    2,892,287 \n24    1,041,321     1,175,171        233,393        506,032        2,955,917   1.03  71,055    2,884,863 \n25    1,041,321     1,175,171        224,227        506,032        2,946,751   1.03  71,055    2,875,696 \n                             \nEIRR                          17.2% \nNPV                 12,535,214      8,780,012     3,755,203  \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net projected value. \nSources: Government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n3  Infrastructure operation and maintenance has already been included in total costs during the 6 years of project \nimplementation. \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \n  5.  Sensitivity of Project Returns to Various Risks \n17.  While the EIRR for this Project seems to be adequately above the cut-off level of 12%, \nthere are various risks associated with the validity of the information and assumptions used. \nSensitivity  tests  have  been  run  based  on:  (i)  adoption  rate  decreased  from  25%  to  20%, \n(ii) livestock process falling by 20%, (iii) village coverage reduced by 20%, (iv) numbers of large \nruminants involved decreased by 20%, (v) time to achieve marketable weights increased by \n20%, and (vi) increase in project costs of 20%, among others. The tests indicate that the Project \nis robust, with the EIRR declining to 12.2% in the worst scenario (Table 9.3). \n \nTable A9.3 Sensitivity Analysis \nExtent of  Switching  Sensitivity \nChanges in  EIRR  Value \nProject Outputs  (% unless  (% unless \n  (% unless  otherwise  otherwise \nItem        otherwise stated)  stated)  stated) \nBase case      17.2     \nAdoption rates decrease  20  12.7  24.0  1.31 \nAnimal prices decrease  20  11.6  18.0  1.62 \nVillage coverage decrease  20  12.7  24.0  1.31 \nLarger animals decrease  20  13.3  31.0  1.14 \nIncrease in fattening time with Project  20  12.2  21.0  1.44 \nDecrease in years of Project  5 yrs  14.9  10 yrs   \nIncremental benefit decrease  20  12.7  24.0  1.31 \nProject cost increase  20  13.2  31.0  1.14 \nPostpone start in districts  1 yr  15.3       \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18.  Overall, the economic returns would appear to be fairly robust. None of the risk factors \ncause large effects upon the economic returns. Decrease of the livestock product prices may \nlead to reduce the EIRR below 12%. However, a substantial price drop caused by increase of \nlivestock product supply because of project intervention is highly unlikely. \n \nD.  Poverty Analysis \n \n19.  The poor can be expected to be at some disadvantage (compared to the nonpoor) in \nadopting improved livestock technologies. First, a smaller proportion of poor households are \nprior owners of any given type of livestock than is the case for nonpoor households. Secondly, \neven for prior livestock owners, the poor are likely to adopt at a somewhat lower rate than \nnonpoor households because they have more limited resources. In the project target districts, \non  average  68%  of  the  households  are  poor  and  many  of  them  have  some  livestock. \nEstimations indicate that 61% of chicken improvement adopters can be expected to be poor. \nSimilarly, poor households are likely to represent 59% of pig adopters, 53% of goat adopters, \nand 38% of cattle adopters. When these percentages are applied to the total incremental project \nbenefits built from the various indicative livestock models, the poor can be expected to receive \n50% of overall incremental benefits. One of the main reasons for the smaller proportion of the \npoor to adopt the new technologies is lack of capital. The village revolving fund of the Project is \naimed at removing this constraint. Once it is successfully removed, the adoption rate of the poor \nwould increase and a there is a potential for a larger proportion of the poor to benefit from the \nProject.\n ", "                                                                                                         Appendix 10     47 \nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  Funds Flow Arrangements \n1.  The Executing Agency (EA) of the Project will be the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry \n(MAF) and the Implementing Agency will be the Department of Livestock and Forestry (DLF). \nThe following institutions will be established under DLF: a National Coordination Office (NCO) in \nVientiane using existing DLF staff, a Regional Office in Luang Prabang, and five provincial \nimplementation units (PIUs). For financial management of the Project, NCO will assist the \nMinistry of Finance to manage two imprest accounts\u2014one for the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) loan and one for the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) loan. The \nimprest accounts will have advance amounting to an estimated 6 months of project expenditure \nto be disbursed from ADB and IFAD loans or a maximum of 10% of the ADB and IFAD loans, \nwhichever is less. These accounts will be replenished on a monthly basis to assure liquidity of \nfunds or when the accounts are drawn down by 20% of the initial deposits. This account will be \naudited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. NCO staff needs further training \nto properly manage these accounts. \n \n2.  The Project will be financed by: (i) an ADB loan of $9.3 million mainly for civil works, \nvehicles,  revolving  funds,  and  equipment;  (ii)  an  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  grant  of \n$0.7 million for three international consultants; (iii) the Government\u2019s fund of $1.1 million for \ntaxes and government staff; (iv) in kind and cash contribution of beneficiaries for civil works and \nsavings;  (v)  a  $3  million  loan  from  IFAD  for  the  revolving  fund,  marketing,  and  poultry \ndevelopment;  and (vi) a $3.5 million grant from the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation \n(SDC) for national and international consulting services. Regular monitoring and internal audit \nfunctions will be built up to monitor transactions along the line from central government to \nprovincial, district, and village levels. Such control procedures will be documented in the project \nfinance and administration manual.  \n \nB.  Financial and Accounting \n \n3.  The project finance and accounting function will be staffed adequately but most staff will \nnot be adequately qualified and experienced. Therefore, the Project will provide training and \nwritten  guidelines,  especially  in  ADB  procedures.  The  Project  will  also  prepare  terms  of \nreference  that  clearly  define  the  duties,  responsibilities,  lines  of  supervision,  and  limits  of \nauthority for all the officers, managers, and staff. The following responsibilities will be performed \nby different units or persons: (i) authorization to execute a transaction; (ii) recording of the \ntransaction; and (iii) custody of assets involved in the transaction. The bank reconciliation will be \nprepared  by  someone  other  than  those  who  approve  payments.  MAF  has  developed  an \naccounting system that allows for the proper recording of project financial transactions. This \nincludes  the  allocation  of  expenditures  in  accordance  with  the  respective  components, \ndisbursement categories, and sources of funds. The Project will follow the system to support the \nharmonization of project funding by various international funding agencies. The existing project \nfinancial manual will be updated to be applicable for the Project and acceptable to ADB. \n \n4.  Controls  will  be  in  place  concerning  the  preparation  and  approval  of  transactions, \nensuring  that  all  transactions  are  correctly  made  and  adequately  explained.  The  chart  of \naccounts  will  be  adequate  to  properly  account  for  and  report  on  project  activities  and \ndisbursement categories. The cost allocations to the various funding sources will be made \naccurately and in accordance with established agreements. The general ledger and subsidiary \nledgers  will  be  reconciled  and  in  balance.  The  existing  accounting  software  will  also  be \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \nupgraded to help the Project produce quarterly financial monitoring reports and annual financial \nstatements in the format agreed by ADB. All accounting and supporting documents will be \nretained on a permanent basis in a defined system that allows authorized users easy access. \n \n5.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy,1 the  Project  will  develop  adequate \nsafeguards to protect assets from fraud, waste, and abuse\u2014particularly regarding the sections \nof ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The subsidiary \nrecords of fixed assets and stocks will be kept up to date and reconciled with control accounts. \nPeriodic physical inventories of fixed assets and stocks will be conducted. Except for vehicles, \nother assets will not be sufficiently covered by insurance policies. The Project will establish \ncontrols and procedures for managing fund flow, financial information, accountability, and audits \nto ensure information among the different offices will flow in an accurate and timely manner. It \nwill  ensure that  periodic  reconciliations  will  be  performed  among  the  different offices.  The \nProject will also advise employees, beneficiaries, and other recipients to whom to report if they \nsuspect fraud, waste, or misuse of project resources or property.  \n \nC.  Internal and External Audit and Reporting \n6.  Delayed audit and lack of consistent external audit standards and procedures are a \ncritical problem in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Therefore, external auditor \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  be  appointed  for  the  Project.  The  scope  of  audit  and  reports \nrequirements will have to be identified and discussed with ADB before the effectiveness. The \nauditors will be selected from international auditing companies through competitive bidding \nprocedures. The project audit will be conducted in accordance with the International Standards \non Auditing. The Project is subject to any kind of audit from an independent governmental entity \n(e.g., NAO, the supreme audit institution) in addition to the external audit. The Project will \nprepare acceptable terms of reference for an annual project audit. \n \n7.  Financial statements will be prepared on a quarterly and annual basis, and the reporting \nsystem  will  have  the  capacity  to  link  the  financial  information  with  the  Project's  physical \nprogress. The separate systems will be used to gather and compile physical data. Controls will \nbe in place to reduce the risk that the physical data may not synchronize with the financial data. \nThe Project will also establish financial management reporting responsibilities that specify what \nreports are to be prepared, what they are to contain, and how they are to be used. Financial \nmanagement reports will be used by  management for comparing actual expenditures with \nbudgeted  and  programmed  allocations.  The  financial  management  system  will  be  partly \ncomputerized. The system will produce the necessary project financial reports, and the staff will \nbe adequately trained to maintain the system. \n \nD.  Conclusion and Recommendation \n8.  Based on the assessment, and past experience of ADB working with MAF, the current \nfinancial  management  arrangements  are  adequate  for  the  Project.  However,  significant \nweaknesses in the accounting and financial management system need to be addressed to \nensure  that  the  Project  will  be  effectively  implemented  and  has  sustainable  development \nimpacts. Detailed analysis of the financial management of the Project is in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy.

No \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR): \n \nThe Government\u2019s goals are to reduce poverty by 50% by 2005, to eradicate it by 2010, and to enable the Lao PDR to \nprogress from being a least developing country to a developing country by 2020. The Lao CSP 2002-051 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement signed by the Government and ADB in \n2001 state that efforts will be directed to reducing poverty by broadening community participation and opportunities \nduring the next 5 years. The operational priorities to achieve these goals are: (i) rural development and market \nlinkages, (ii) human resource development, (iii) sustainable environmental management, and (iv) regional integration. \n \nThe overall  aim of the Northern Region  Sustainable Livelihoods Development through  Livestock Project is to \ncontribute to government initiatives in poverty reduction through smallholder livestock development in the northern \nregion of Lao PDR. This recognizes the Government\u2019s priority to address widespread poverty in the northern region; \nthe importance of livestock as a source of food protein and cash incomes for upland villagers; and that livestock \nraising is a profitable, smallholder production alternative to upland cropping that will allow shifting cultivators to \nmaintain household income levels as they stabilize their production systems. \n \nThree immediate outcomes contribute to this aim: (i) enhanced village livestock systems, (ii) community development \nand capacity building, and (iii) enhanced project implementation and management. The first is further divided into \nthree subcomponents that reflect the identified problem areas for livestock performance: (i) improved livestock \nproductivity, (ii) improved market orientation and livestock enterprise development, and (iii) improved participatory \nextension network.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                            Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nOf an estimated population of 5.1 million in Lao PDR, 38.6% live below the poverty line. This is defined as where a \nperson cannot access the equivalent of 2,100 calories from foodstuffs (ranges from calorie intake of 1,200 calories per \nday for infants to 2,767 calories for adult males and 1,747 calories for females over the age of 60) or the equivalent of \nKN142,500 per month or less than $0.50 per day. The poverty line is 30% higher in Vientiane than the rural areas of \nLao PDR.  \n \nPoorest provinces. The project area comprises 18 priority poor districts in the five northern provinces of Bokeo, \nHouaphanh, Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, and Xieng Khouang. This area was identified from among those districts \nwhere the number of poor households exceeded 50%, as classified in the National Growth and Poverty Eradication \nStrategy (NGPES). \n \nPoorest districts and incidence of poverty. Based on the NGPES classification, the incidence of poverty for the \nselected districts in the project area ranges from 55% in Nonghet to 92% in Houamouang. Among the 18 target \ndistricts, 10 districts participated in the socioeconomic survey undertaken during the preparation of the project, which \nincluded the district with the highest incidence of poverty as well as the lowest. The three main indicators of poverty \nwere identified as: (i) rice security (shortage of rice), (ii) access to land, and (iii) insufficient large livestock.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   ", "50  Appendix 11 \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe strategy is to deploy contracted provincial and district units of the Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU) to provide \nmobilization, organization, and training support to participating communities. These LWU units will be contracted by the \nregional office to work at the village and district level in close collaboration with District Agriculture and Fisheries \nExtension Office (DAFEO) staff. They will organize gender representative groups, including the poor, to undertake \ndecision making and implementation of activities related to improving livelihoods, village infrastructure, savings, and \ncredit. Once trained, the groups will progressively handle responsibility for the use of project resources to be invested \nat village level, with backstopping from the service providers. Extension and training will also be provided through these \ngroups using a problem-solving approach. DAFEO staff  will be trained in participatory and gender responsive \napproaches. All benefit monitoring and evaluation will address the participatory aspects of the Project. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nThe Project will support the full participation of ethnic women in all project outputs and impacts, including their \norganization  into  groups,  training  in  livelihoods  investments,  revolving  funds,  appropriate  technology  transfer, \nmicroenterprise development, and group marketing. Women will be provided literacy training and translation services \nfor extension and training programs. The Project will promote women\u2019s participation in all village-based training \nprograms to constitute approximately half of all trainees. They will be encouraged to participate in village revolving \nfunds groups and village infrastructure committees, as well as community and household decision making on priority \ninvestments. Based on baseline data to be collected and analyzed prior to project start-up in villages, women will be \nprogressively encouraged to constitute at least half of all members of village revolving funds groups. \n \nThe Project will provide gender sensitization training at all levels of the project implementation structure, including the \nvillage. All monitoring and evaluation will be gender-responsive and collect and analyze data on gender differentials in \naccess to project outputs and benefits. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

The  gender  action  plan  aims  to  facilitate  the  equitable  participation  of  women, \nparticularly poor upland ethnic women, in all project outcomes and impacts. Women among the \ntarget upland communities enjoy varying degrees of social recognition and rights to participate \nin decision making. The larger upland ethnic groups in the project area, comprising the Khmu \nand  Hmong,  are  characterized  by  patriarchal  economic  and  social  structures  within  which \nwomen have heavy workloads and less status and decision making. However, all upland ethnic \ngroups demonstrate growing poverty and insecurity of livelihoods, which affect women badly. \n  \n2.  The  Project  will  aim  to  improve  women\u2019s  knowledge  and  their  access  to  financial, \nphysical, and social capital for improved livelihoods. Women will be targeted for literacy and \nnumeracy  training  to  eliminate  their  initial  disadvantages.  The  Project  will  facilitate  their \nmobilization and organization to improve their participation in community decision making, the \nparticipatory  adoption  and  popularization  of  new  technical  practices,  and  marketing \narrangements.  Women  will  be  supported  through  training  for  representation  in  village \nrevolving/infrastructure funds management, and as beneficiaries of these funds. The Project \nsets progressive targets for the gender action to be implemented and monitored. \n \n(i)  The Project will facilitate women\u2019s participation in village based training At least \n50% of all trainees in village-based training programs are expected to be women. \nHowever, for training programs aimed at smaller livestock, women are expected \nto comprise about 70\u201380% of all trainees. \n(ii)  Women will be equitably represented in village revolving fund/infrastructure fund \nmanagement structures. \n(iii)  Based on baseline data, women will form at least 30\u201350% of all beneficiaries \nunder the village revolving funds. \n(iv)  At least 50% of all extension workers will be women. \n(v)  Gender training will be provided to staff of the Provincial Agriculture and Forestry \nOffice (PAFO) and District Agriculture and Fisheries Extension Office (DAFEO). \n(vi)  All BME will be gender-responsive and measure project impacts on women in \nterms  of  returns  to  labor,  improved  productivity  of  livestock,  participation  in \nenterprise promotion, take of credit, membership of community based groups, \nextent of participation in training, etc. \n ", "52     Appendix 13 \nETHNIC GROUPS DEVELOPMENT PLAN  \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The objective of the Project is to improve the sustainability of upland livelihoods through \nparticipatory  livestock  development.  Lack  of  access  to  adequate  productive  resources  and \nopportunities leads to the absence of sustainable livelihoods1 for the predominantly upland \nethnic populations in the northern Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). This ethnic \ngroups development plan (EGDP) aims to provide further information and analysis of these \nconstraints, and ways in which the Project will target ethnic groups to ensure equitable access \nto project outputs and impacts. The EGDP is based on extensive consultations with ethnic \ngroups in the project area. These consultations took the following forms: \n \n(i)  Socioeconomic  surveys  conducted  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance in January/June 2005 in 40 villages in the 18 districts. \n(ii)  Participatory research and consultations in selected villages carried out in June\u2013\nJuly 2005.   \n(iii)  Workshops conducted during the project preparatory technical assistance. \n(iv)  Participatory workshop conducted in Luang Prabang on 15 February 2006. \n(v)  During pre-appraisal, it was also indicated that a greater stress on smallholder \npoultry is a priority for poor households.  \n(vi)  After  pre-appraisal,  a  local  consultant  engaged  all  18  districts  through \nconsultative workshops on social and environmental related to the Project. The \nreport was submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in May 2006. \n(vii)  The Project and the EGDP are based on the outcomes of these discussions. \n \nB.  Background  \n \n3.  One of the main characteristics of the Lao PDR is its cultural diversity. For the purposes \nof the 1995 census, the Government recognized 47 main ethnic groups or categories and 149 \nsubgroups, and the last revision of this list by the Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC) \ncontained 49 categories and over 160 subgroups. Thus, the official terminology for describing \nthe diverse population of the Lao PDR is \u201cethnic groups\u201d.  \n \n4.  In  Lao  PDR,  all  people  are  considered  equal,  irrespective  of  ethnic  background.2 \nAlthough almost 50 major ethnic groups are recognized by the national census, ethnic groups \nare conventionally divided into three major groups based on prototypical location: (i) Lowland \nLao (Lao Loum) who tend to settle in valleys and flatlands, (ii) Upland Lao (Lao Sung) who \nprefer higher altitudes, and (iii) Midland Lao (Lao Theung) who tend to inhabit mid-level slopes. \nHowever, there are many exceptions to these stereotypic village locations so such universalities \n                                                 \n1  The sustainable livelihoods framework developed by Institute for Development Studies (IDS), Sussex, and adopted \nby the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, puts people at the center of \ndevelopment and views them as operating in a context of vulnerability. It provides a very useful and relevant \nanalytical framework to (i) understand the multidimensional nature of poverty, as defined by people themselves; \nand (ii) analyze their access to the various types of capital (financial, physical, social, human, natural) and their \nability to combine and utilize these assets as individuals/ households, in ways that may enable them to ensure their \naccess to adequate subsistence and well-being\u2014including improvements therein in future, without undermining the \nnatural resource base. Conversely, the absence of any of these can lead to poverty, vulnerability to loss of \nsubsistence, and reduced well-being. For further details, refer to, among others, Chambers, R., and G. Conway. \n1992. Sustainable Rural Livelihoods: Practical Concepts for the 21st Century. (IDS) Discussion Paper 296. IDS. \nSussex. \n2  Government of Lao PDR. 1992.

Over two thirds of the national population is Lao Loum, which comprise 8 \nethnic groups within the Lao-Tai language family. The upland or highland Lao make up about \n10% of the population and comprise 7 groups within the Chine-Tibet language family and 2 \ngroups within the Hmong-Lu Mien language family. Midland Lao account for 25% of the total \npopulation and comprise 32 groups within the Mon-Khmer language family (footnote 3). \n        \nTable A14.1: Ethnicity of the Population \n \n     \nEthno-Linguistic  Topographical  Language  No. of Ethnic  Proportion of \nFamily  Groups  Population (%) \nTai Kadai  Lao Loum  Lao Phoutai  8  66.2 \nAustroasiatic  Lao Theung  Mon Khmer  32  23.0 \nHmong-lu Mien  Lao Sung  Hmong Yao  2  7.4 \nChine-Tibetan  Lao Sung  Tibeto Burman  7  2.5 \nChine-Tibetan  Lao Sung  Hor Han  1  0.2 \nSources: Chamberlain, J. and P.

Although there are various ethnic groups within the lowland Lao, only the upland and \nmidland Laos are considered \u201cethnic groups\u201d. Lao PDR policy emphasizes the multiethnic nature \nof the nation and, in many ways, works to reduce discrimination against midland and upland \nminorities. The use of the \u201cthree-ethnic group\u201d emphasizes the commonality of Lao nationality \n\u201cLao  First\u201d4 and  is  widely  used  in  the  country  to  refer  to  specific  ethnicity.  While  there  is \nparticipation in the political process, with a number of non-Lao ethnic people holding positions in \ngovernment, there is no equal representation at all political levels when compared to their total \nnumbers in the provincial populations. In Lao PDR, poverty, culture, and ethnicity are closely \nlinked.5 Often,  due  to  remote  location,  ethnic  people  have  comparatively  less  access  to \ngovernment services such as health, education, agricultural extension, and infrastructure. As a \nresult, development impacts can be marginalizing on isolated and pre-market ethnic economies. \nFurther, the higher incidence of poverty, particularly among minority groups, makes them more \nvulnerable socially and economically.6 \nD.  Government of Lao PDR Policies towards Ethnic Groups \n \n6.  Review of Government Policy on Ethnic Groups. Since 1975, the Government has \nshown  great  interest  in  rural  people  and  ethnic  groups.  The  Central  Committee  for  Ethnic \nMinorities was created in 1975 to develop a policy regarding ethnicity in Lao PDR.  \n7.  The  main  policy  of  the  Central  Committee  for  Ethnic  Minorities  was  to  continue \nstrengthening solidarity and conciliation among all ethnic groups and to create a unified force to \nprotect the sovereignty of the nation and the development of the country. Its priority activity was to \n                                                 \n3  Chamberlain, J. and P. Phomsombath. 2002.

Various  decrees  and  laws  throughout  the  1980s  and  1990s  aimed  to  strengthen \nprotection of the rights of all ethnic groups in the country. Increasing emphasis was made on the \nimportance of diversity, which is increasingly seen as a source of strength rather than a threat. \n \n10.  Ethnic Minority Affairs in 1981. By recognizing the lack of policy and attention to some \nethnic groups, the Political Bureau issued a resolution in 1981 concerning the affairs of all \nethnic groups, although it was aimed specifically the Hmong and became known as the \u201cHmong \nPolicy\u201d.  The  policy  was  primarily  focused  on  shifting  cultivation  in  rural  development  and \nrequired that the livelihoods of the people, both materially and mentally, be improved. In the \ncase of Hmong, the policy required conditions to be in place to allow a solid basis for production \nand, over the next five-year period, various resettlements of highland groups were undertaken \nin  an  attempt  to  improve  their  food  security.  The  policy  also  required  consultation  and  a \nremedial approach to solving problems of land shortage, land disputes between Hmong and \nother ethnic groups, and problems created by resettlement during the war and through rural \ndevelopment (including those who wished to return to their original territory or move to new \nones). The policy showed that the Government was aware of deficiencies in meeting the basic \nneeds  of  the  rural  ethnic  people,  especially  the  Hmong,  and  proposed  solutions  which \nemphasized  participation  and  consensus  of  traditional/local  leaders  as  well  as  the  people \nthemselves. \n \n11.   The Third Party Congress (April 1982), while focusing on economic development and \nnational defense, followed an agenda in relation to the development of ethnic minorities that \nincluded stabilization of shifting cultivation and relocation and resettlement of upland villages to \nlowland areas where there was potential for paddy rice cultivation. \n \n12.    Most of the resettlement projects failed to meet expectations because of insufficient \npreparation of both resettling and host communities, and inadequate resources and experience \nto support the policy. In some cases, they resulted in resettled villages moving back to their \nprevious land within a few years. \n \n13.  The Fifth Party Congress (March 1991) reiterated the commitment to the maintenance of \nethnic identities and the economic development of all groups. The Congress subsequently \nconfirmed the adoption of a \u201cnew economic mechanism\u201d and reaffirmed that transition from \nsubsistence to a market economy must be accompanied by the progressive abandoning of \nslash and burn practices. \n \n14.  The Fifth Party Congress had two main achievements in relation to ethnic groups: (i) the \nadoption  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Lao  PDR,  which  recognized  citizens  of  all  ethnicity \n(Section 2.1.2)7; and (ii) the recognition that implementation of the 1981 Ethnic Policy had been \nineffectual, resulting in the 1992 Resolution on Ethnic Affairs in the New Era (footnote 7, \nSection 2.1.3). \n \n15.  The  Constitution.  The  Constitution  of  the  Lao  PDR  was  passed  in  1991  as  a \nconsolidation of the rights and responsibilities of the State and the people. Throughout the \nConstitution, the term \u201ccitizens of all ethnicity\u201d is used. The Constitution states that all citizens \nhave rights in education, health, land use and ownership, domicile of choice, and economic \n                                                 \n7 Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic. 1991.

These articles form the foundation of a policy signed by the President of Lao PDR in \n19928 The Constitution was revised in 2003 and the relevant provisions are the new Articles 8 \nand 35. \n17.  The 1992 Resolution9. The Party Central Committee issued a resolution on Ethnic \nAffairs in the New Era in 1992. The first section of the resolution constitutes an evaluation of the \nimplementation of the 1981 ethnic affairs policy. While acknowledging some progress, this \nsection is essentially a strong critique of the lack of progress in most areas of implementation. It \nhighlighted the lack of adequate attention to ethnic groups\u2019 livelihood, education, training, and \nmotivation,  as  well  as  the  lack  of  coordination  among  concerned  government  agencies  in \naddressing their problems. \n18.  This resolution was to be implemented through both political and economic development \nactivities, which included halting shifting cultivation and the permanent settlement of the people \nwho practiced it. This was to be followed by programs to improve their livelihoods. \nE.  ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n19.  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples10 focuses  on  the  circumstances  of  indigenous \npeoples (\u201cethnic minorities\u201d) and on identifying and satisfying their needs and developmental \naspirations.  It  emphasizes  the  participation  of  ethnic  minorities  in  development,  and  the \nmitigation of its negative effects and impacts. \n20.  The policy stipulates that ADB-funded projects in which ethnic minorities are affected \nshould be: \n(i)  consistent with the needs and aspirations of affected ethnic minority peoples; \n(ii)  compatible in substance and structure with affected ethnic minorities\u2019 culture \nand social and economic institutions; \n(iii)  conceived, planned, and implemented with the informed participation of affected \ncommunities; \n(iv)  equitable in terms of development efforts and impact; and \n(v)  not imposing the negative effects of development on ethnic minorities without \nappropriate and acceptable compensation. \n \n21.  The  term  \u201cindigenous  people\u201d  is  generic  and  includes  cultural  minorities,  ethnic \nminorities,  indigenous  cultural  communities,  tribal  peoples,  scheduled  tribes,  natives,  and \naboriginals. The definition 11, is encompassing and describes indigenous people as having the \nfollowing characteristics: \n \n                                                 \n8  Government of Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic. 1992.

(i) descent from population groups present in a given area before modern states or \nterritories were created, and (ii) maintenance of cultural and social identities separate \nfrom mainstream or dominant societies or cultures. Additional characteristics include \n(i) self-identification and identification of others as being part of a distinct indigenous \ncultural group, and the display of desire to preserve that cultural identity; (ii) a linguistic \nidentity  different  from  that  of  mainstream  or  dominant  society;  (iii)  social,  cultural, \neconomic, and political traditions and institutions distinct from mainstream or dominant \nculture;  (iv)  an  economic  system  oriented  more  toward  a  traditional  system  of \nproduction than the mainstream system; or (v) a unique tie and attachment to traditional \nhabitat and ancestral territory and natural resources. \n \n22.  The approach adopted by ADB in project and program development is to seek the \ngreatest possible reduction in poverty among indigenous peoples and, in cases where adverse \ncultural effects are unavoidable, to minimize these effects through identification of appropriate \nmitigation measures. Furthermore, where indigenous people are to be affected by a project, it \nis important to incorporate mechanisms into project planning that will ensure the equal or \nenhanced enjoyment of project benefits by indigenous people. \n \n23.  This approach recognizes that even programs that are aimed at improving quality of life \n(i.e., poverty reduction projects) do not necessarily equally reach all sectors of the community, \nand invariably, indigenous people\u2014for a variety of reasons\u2014often bear a disproportionate \nburden of adverse social and economic effects of development. Therefore, project planning \nmust include strategies to overcome such structural constraints and appropriate communication \navenues are identified, particularly when conventional approaches to information dissemination \nmay not be adequate. Any such strategy would also need to provide specific mechanisms for \nindigenous women\u2019s concerns to be identified and addressed through the project process. To \nthis end, OM F-3/BP notes that \u201c...development interventions that will affect indigenous peoples \nshould  ensure  that  they  have  opportunities  to  participate  in  and  benefit  equally  from  the \ninterventions\u201d. \n \n24.  To ensure that people of ethnic minority groups are included in appropriate ways in the \ndevelopment  process,  OM  F-3/BP  requires  the  preparation  of  an  indigenous  peoples\u2019 \ndevelopment plan. In the context of the Project, the process of facilitating the participation of \nethnic minorities in the Project, and ensuring that they benefit equitably, is termed an ethnic \nminority  development  plan  (EGDP).  The  EGDP  lays  out  basic  principles  for  ensuring  the \nequitable participation of ethnic minority households/communities in development of sustainable \nlivelihoods, with particular attention to the needs of ethnic minority women. \n \nF.  Development Activities under the Project Components \n \n1.  Enhanced Village Livestock Systems \n \n25.  Activities proposed under this component seek to change the current perspective of low \ninput-low output systems in improving the productivity of ethnic groups and rendering them \nmore market-oriented. \n  \n26.  Productivity  Initiatives.  The  Project  will:  (i)  improve  livestock  growth  via  the \nintroduction of forages\u2014through nursery development, supply of planting materials, training, \nand improved animal feeding; (ii) improve livestock survival through better management of \nlivestock movements, improved disease monitoring, and support for emergency vaccinations; \n(iii) improve livestock fertility through smallholder training and improved management of smaller \nlivestock; and (iv) improve management practices through farmer training, training of women \n ", "                                                                                                                          Appendix 13       57 \n(especially for smaller livestock production), and demonstrations of livestock management. It will \nsupport a village revolving fund to be administered by local village-based groups to be trained \nunder the Project. All these outputs are expected to be delivered through participatory and \nculturally appropriate approaches to ensure that ethnic groups, particularly Lao Theung and Lao \nSung ethnic groups, are able to participate fully in project activities.  \n \n27.  Market Linkages and Enterprise Development. The second component will improve \nmarket efficiency and enterprise development. The Project will also provide smallholder training \nand  support  for  group  marketing  activities.  The  Project  will  fund  village  infrastructure  to \nrehabilitate  or  establish  essential  transport  and  other  small-scale  village  infrastructure  to \nimprove  market  access  (pathways  and  bridges)  and  village  life  (e.g.,  gravity  fed  water \nsupplies).  \n \n28.  Participatory Extension Network. The Project will support the government extension \nservice through capacity building for technical know-how and participatory methodologies for \nextension using a problem solving approach.  \n \n  2.   Capacity Building for Community Driven Development  \n \n29. The Project will fund capacity building activities in upland communities through service \ncontracts with Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU) in order to promote group formation for participatory \ntechnology  transfer;  and  provide  for  literacy  and  numeracy  training,  particularly  for \ndisadvantaged groups\u2014to ensure they share the benefits of the Project.  \n30.   Monitoring and Evaluation. All project monitoring and evaluation will address the \nparticipation  and  benefits  to  non-Lao  ethnic  groups  under  all  project  components.  The \nInternational  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  Result  and  Impact  Management \nSystem (RIMS) will be used to monitor outcomes of the Project. This will include changes to \nasset structures of households and information on malnutrition and changes therein. A baseline \nsurvey will be conducted prior to implementation of project activities. Full-scale evaluations will \nbe  carried  out  on  ethnicity  and  gender  issues  in  improving  livelihoods  through  livestock \nproduction at midterm (year four) and at the end of the Project.  \nG.
