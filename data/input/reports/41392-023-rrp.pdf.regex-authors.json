I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based  loan,  and  a  proposed  project  loan,  both  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for \nsubprogram  2  of  the  Decentralized  Public  Service  and  Financial  Management  Sector \nDevelopment Program.  \n \n2.  The program seeks to improve public service delivery in Cambodia by supporting the \ndevelopment of efficient and accountable subnational administrations.1 The second subprogram \nof  this  programmatic  approach  comprises  policy-based  lending  and  project  lending.  The \nprogram  will  (i)  support  the  development  of  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for \ndecentralization, and (i) provide funding to establish the Sub-National Investment Fund (SNIF) \nto  provide  eligible  subnational  administrations  with  financial  resources  for  local  investment \nprojects.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.   Development problem. Despite an impressive record of economic growth, development \nin Cambodia is uneven, with large regional inequalities. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by \nan average of over 6% between 2007 and 2015 while the poverty rate declined to 13.5% in \n2014 from 47.8% in 2007.2 However, national poverty averages mask large regional disparities. \nIn 2009\u20132010 the poverty rate in Phnom Penh (4.3%) was less than one-sixth that of rural areas \n(27.5%),3 while average poverty rates in the poorest seven provinces in the country were all well \nover 30%. About 91% of the poor live in rural areas, and the proportion is increasing. Moreover, \nmore women join the labor market in rural areas, but they are mostly unpaid family workers. As \na result, the multidimensional poverty index is five times higher in rural than in urban areas.4 \nFurther, sanitation can be accessed by just 37% of the population, and clean water sources by \n44%, while access in urban areas is over 70%. These regional disparities limit inclusive growth \nand  employment  generating  opportunities  for  the  country  as  a  whole,  and  restrain  the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to meet its development goals and reduce poverty.  \n \n4.   Binding constraints. The Government of Cambodia is aware of these large regional \ninequalities. Reforms aim to improve the management capacity of local administrations, and to \ninvolve citizens in the decision-making processes, enabling more efficient public service delivery \nwhich fits local needs and reduces these regional inequalities. However, the government faces \na number of critical binding constraints, including inefficient service delivery, weak local revenue \nbases and fiscal management systems, and a lack of effective feedback mechanisms. These \nconstraints are elaborated in paras 5\u20137. \n \n5.  Inefficient service delivery systems across levels of administration. Spending by \nsubnational administrations in Cambodia represented only 7% of total government spending in \n2014,  with  districts,  municipalities,  and  communes  (the  focus  of  decentralization  efforts) \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Programmatic \nApproach, Policy-Based and Project Loan for Subprogram 1, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of \nCambodia: Decentralized Public Service and Financial Management Sector Development Program.

Cambodia\u2019s three tiers of subnational governments display a \nmixture of fiscal deconcentration and decentralization and as a result, the assignment of district \nand municipality-level functional expenditure responsibilities is not clear. This lessens public \nsector efficiency, and there is a limited capacity within subnational administrations to deliver \nbasic  services  and  realize  economies  of  scale.  More  needs  to  be  done  to  develop  an \noverarching framework for decentralization, provide for a clear division of responsibility, and \nidentify efficient service delivery mechanisms.  \n \n6.  Weak local revenue bases and financial management systems. Currently, only 3.6% \nof national revenues are distributed to districts, municipalities, and communes through fiscal \ntransfers.  Further,  subnational  administrations  in  Cambodia  which  serve  rural  areas  are \nestimated to generate only 60% of own-resource revenue. Recent progress under subprogram \n1 is encouraging as an additional 2% of the national budget will be transferred to subnational \nadministrations over 2017\u20132018 to support the decentralization of rural water supplies and solid \nwaste  collection.  In  addition,  the  government  established  the  District  and  Municipal  Fund. \nNevertheless, the lack of tax and non-tax revenue assignments reduces the accountability of the \nsubnational administrations. There is a continuing lack of funds for local investment projects and \nperformance-based  funding  mechanisms  have  not  been  deployed.  Deeper  reforms  will  be \nrequired, beginning with the provision of additional fiscal transfers, tax, and non-tax revenue \nassignments to subnational administrations. \n \n7.  Fledging local governance systems and social accountability mechanisms. Clear \nstatutes  for  subnational  administrations  are  needed  to  clarify  the  rules  and  procedures \napplicable to local councils and their executives. In turn, these rules and procedures will enable \ntheir constituents to fulfill their responsibilities to monitor them. Currently, citizens do not have \naccess to  local  plans  and  budgets,  nor  do they  have  the  systems to  monitor  subnational \nadministrations.  Moreover,  both  subnational  administrations  and  their  constituents  lack  the \ntechnical capacity to utilize such a framework.   \n \n8.  Government reform agenda and past ADB interventions. The government\u2019s reform \nframework  is  contained  in  the  national  program,5  which  is  implemented  through  3-year \nimplementation plans (IP3s). Key legal aspects of the reform effort include: the 2008 Organic \nLaw on Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts, and Khans; and the 2011 Sub-national \nFinance Law. The country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia includes a focus on \npublic  sector  management  and  identifies  decentralization  and  deconcentration  as  core \ncomponents. 6  \n \n9.  Achievements under Subprogram 1. Under subprogram 1, a $1.5 million TA loan \nsupported a number of initiatives, including the assignment of non-tax revenues to subnational \nadministrations, the establishment of the SNIF, and the design and implementation of public \nfinancial management (PFM) systems for monitoring subnational administrations. Subprogram 1 \nalso supported the pilot decentralization of rural water supply operations. Although much has \nbeen  achieved,  efforts  to  transfer  fiscal  revenue  to  subnational  administrations  were  not \nsuccessful. In response, subprogram 2 supported the establishment of the SNIF to promote \nfiscal transfer and provide capacity building to subnational administrations.     \n \n                                                \n5  Government of Cambodia. 2009.

Lessons from ADB support for reform design and implementation. A number of \nlessons have emerged from prior ADB engagements. First, both the Ministry of Interior and the \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF) should be engaged as lead implementing agencies to \nfacilitate inter-agency dialogue. In addition, targeted technical assistance needs to be provided \nto  priority  ministries,  other  than  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  to  support \ndecentralization of service delivery. In addition, decentralization reforms must be coordinated \nwith national public financial management reforms to ensure consistency between the national \ngovernment and subnational administrations. Finally, capacity building is necessary to manage \nthe large number of stakeholders involved in policy formulation and need for consensus.      \n \n11.  Sector  development  program  approach  and  budget  support.  Implementation of \nsubprogram 1 demonstrated the benefits of combining a policy-based loan with a project loan, \nand subprogram 2 proposes to expand this approach.7 This allows for adequate coordination \nand sequencing of reforms and the execution of strategic initiatives, such as the SNIF. Of the \ntotal  $35  million  equivalent  in  planned  financial  support,  the  policy-based  loan  component  \n($15 million equivalent) facilitates the articulation of a medium-term framework of policy reforms, \nwhich is at an early stage in Cambodia, and provides the government the flexibility to sequence \nthe reforms. The project loan investment ($20 million equivalent) will support a pilot subnational \ngovernment investment grant scheme to fund 184 projects.  \n \n12.  Development partners\u2019 coordination. ADB is the lead development partner in this \nsector, and co-chairs the development partners\u2019 working group on decentralization reforms. \nEuropean and Japanese development partners are active in the areas of decentralization reform \nand subnational developments.      \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The  impact  will  be  improved  access to  and  coverage  of  basic  services  across the \ncountry. The  outcome will  be  an  efficient  system  of  intergovernmental  fiscal relations that \nassists with service delivery by subnational administrations. The proposed subprogram includes \na policy-based loan and a project loan. The policy-based loan includes 22 reform actions  \n(14 triggers and 8 milestones),8 which the Government completed from 2012 to 2016.9 The \nproject loan will provide assistance to the establishment and operations of the SNIF.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n1.  Policy-Based Loan Outputs  \n \n14.  The  policy-based  loan  is  structured  around  seven  major  outputs  drawn  from  the \ngovernment\u2019s IP3 for the national program (footnote 6) described in paras 15\u201321. \n \n15.  A  gender-sensitive  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  decentralization \ndeveloped and regularly updated. The government has continued to provide a high-level \nframework  to  guide  decentralization.  A  midterm  review  of  the  first  IP3  (2011\u20132014)  was \n                                                \n7   In the concept paper, subprogram 2 was initially proposed as a policy-based loan, but changed due to the \nsuccessful implementation of subprogram 1. \n8   The completion of policy triggers is a requirement for the loan. The policy mile stones, represent additional \nreforms implemented by the government. \n9   The policy matrix originally contained 39 reform actions, comprised of 17 triggers and 22 milestones. After \nconfirming the completion of all 39 measures during fact-finding, the policy matrix was restructured to simplify the \npresentation. \n ", "4 \nconducted, including a gender audit, and the annual implementation reports were distributed to \nand  widely  discussed  among  stakeholders.  The  government  subsequently  reviewed  and \nupdated its implementation strategy for decentralization. Utilizing these lessons and feedback, a \nsecond  IP3  (2015\u20132017)  was  approved  that  incorporates  gender  issues  in  the  objectives, \nimplementation approach, and monitoring and evaluation framework.  \n \n16.  Institutions  for  efficient  coordination  of  subnational  democratic  development \npolicies established. The government strengthened the institutions that are leading the reform \nagenda. A full staff complement, 20% of who are women, has been provided to the National \nCommittee for Sub-National Democratic Development (NCDD-S), and it has received a stable \nnational  budgetary  allocation  since  2012.  Further,  the  government  has  strengthened  the \ncapacity of subnational administrations \u2014close to 30% of advisors and staff in subnational \nadministrations are women\u2014 to manage their personnel by approving permanent regulations for \nhuman resource management, giving them the ability to appoint, move and terminate civil \nservants working at subnational level.  \n \n17.  Clear service delivery responsibilities of subnational administrations defined. The \ngovernment has assigned districts and municipalities new responsibilities for service delivery. \nFunctions  eligible  to  be  devolved  to  subnational  administrations  were  identified  through  a \ngovernment subdecree, which was approved in 2014, and pilot projects to decentralize the \noperation of health facilities and the operation and maintenance of district rural water supplies \nhas  begun.  Additional  proposals  for  the  reassignment  of  functions  \u2014including  for  rural \ndevelopment, education, environment, and social affairs\u2014 have been completed, and the first \nfull service decentralization (solid waste collection) is underway. Construction of 34 district \noffices in poor rural areas to assist with efficient service delivery is underway and will be \ncompleted in 2016.  \n \n18.  Efficient tax and non-tax revenue to subnational administrations assigned. The \ngovernment has made important progress in mobilizing revenue at the subnational level. A \nprakas  (proclamation)  was  issued  in  December  2013  by  the  Non-Tax  and  State  Property \nDepartment of the MEF, which defined administrative fees and charges for all subnational \nadministrations. In addition, an MEF subdecree was drafted to provide for the assignment of tax \nrevenue for districts and municipalities. The Government has submitted the draft subdecree to \nthe General Secretariat of the PFM reform committee for approval.  \n \n19.   Fiscal  transfers  that  ensure  comparable  levels  of  service  delivery  across \nsubnational administrations implemented. The government has provided an increased level \nof fiscal transfers to support decentralization. Since 2013, MEF has used a formula-based \napproach to allocate transfers to the provincial level, and has completed a review of financing \nmodalities for provinces leading to the definition of multiannual budget programs. In addition, the \ngovernment has gradually increased the budget allocation to the District and Municipal Fund \nfrom 0.8% of national revenues in 2015 to 0.9% in 2016, and 1% in 2017. The Prime Minister \nestablished the SNIF through the approval of a subdecree, and a budgetary allocation has been \nautomatically appropriated in the 2016 budget. The SNIF, which provides a conditional grant \nearmarked for local infrastructure and investment projects, will be allocated to eligible districts \nusing a formula-based approach. Finally, the government has designed a system of conditional \ngrants  to  support  the  delegated  delivery  of  water  by  subnational  administrations,  with \nimplementation of the first pilot project scheduled for 2015.  \n \n20.  Capacity  in  support  of  efficient  decentralized  public  financial  management \ndeveloped. The government continues to develop a regulatory framework for the decentralized ", "5 \nfinancial management system. A standardized Sub-National Budget Classification and Chart of \nAccounts have been completed. Regulations have been issued to govern the procurement, \nbudget  formulation  and  implementation,  payment  and  accounting  systems  of  districts  and \nmunicipalities. The capacity of the National Audit Authority to audit subnational administrations \nhas been strengthened.  Specific financial, compliance, and performance audit procedures \napplicable to subnational administrations have been developed. All auditors have been trained \nto use the new procedures and the number of provinces, municipalities, and communes audited \nin 2014 has increased significantly over 2013. Subnational administrations have been trained to \nuse financial management systems, and efforts are underway to improve the capacity of the \nGeneral  Department  Sub-national  Administration  to  undertake  financial  management  and \nmonitoring.10 These efforts include: (i) the review and prioritization of an inventory of PFM \nregulations governing subnational administration finance; (ii) provision of a PFM manual for \nsubnational  administrations;  (iii)  design  and  implementation  of  a  financial  database  for \nsubnational administrations; and (iv) defining the scope of capacity development activities of the \nGeneral Department Sub-National Administration Finance.  \n \n21.   Accountability  mechanisms  for  subnational  administrations  to  their \nconstituencies designed and implemented. The government has implemented policies to \nincrease the social and political accountability of local administrations to their constituents. \nCoaching and mentoring systems have been implemented, and technical manuals to guide \nsubnational council meetings and public forums have been completed. Training and capacity \ndevelopment has been delivered to all districts covering 3,324 councilors, including 425 women. \nThe  district  and  municipal  mentors  responsible  for  the  delivery  of  training  activities, \napproximately 25% of which are women, were hired as part of the NCDD-S advisory and \nsupport staff for subnational administrations. The district charter template has been approved by \nthe NCDD chair and implementation has begun in 10 districts. Finally, a social accountability \nframework for subnational administrations has been approved by the NCDD-S and will increase \ntransparency and accountability between subnational administrations and their constituents.  \n \n2.   Project Loan Output \n \n22.   Sub-National  Investment  Fund  established  and  operations  started. The project \nloan will finance the SNIF which will be used to fund local investment projects.  These projects \nwill  include  civil  works,  goods for  subnational  administrations,  equipment,  and consultancy \nservices for the SNIF Secretariat to be delivered between 2017 and 2021. Consultancy services \nwill include: (i) capacity development for the SNIF Secretariat and subnational administrations; \n(ii) annual performance assessments of subnational administrations; (iii) annual evaluation and \naudit of investments; (iv) external audit of SNIF finances; and (v) technical backstopping support \nfor the SNIF Secretariat. To participate in the program, subnational administrations will be \nsubject to an annual performance assessment against a number of criteria including financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  capacity.  Eligible  subnational  administrations  will  submit \ninvestment project proposals from a positive list of subsectors maintained by the SNIF Board. \nThe SNIF Secretariat will evaluate the proposals and submit those which pass the pre-screen to \nthe Board for evaluation and approval. The selection criteria against which investment projects \nare evaluated have been included in the project administration manual (PAM)11 and the project \nloan agreement.  \n \n                                                \n10  This training was conducted by the Departments of Procurement, Treasury, and Sub-national Administration \nFinance. \n11    Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "6 \nD.

The  loan  size  is  based  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s financing needs, the strength of the policy reform package, and its development \nimpact. The benefits arise from improved state allocative efficiency decentralization of service \ndelivery), higher revenue collection, and strengthened local governance. Cambodia\u2019s gross \nfinancing needs remain high. With a projected budget deficit of 4.6% of GDP for 2016, the \ngovernment will need to borrow KR3,313 billion (approximately $820 million). \n \n 24.  Policy-based loan financing plan.

The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nTable 3:  Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2013\u2013December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  June 2016 for policy-based loan; December 2021 for project loan \nLoan closing dates  Policy-based loan (June 2017); Project loan (June 2022) \nManagement \n(ii)   Executing agency  National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development Secretariat  \n(for policy-based loan); SNIF secretariat (for project loan) \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  MEF, MOI, MCS, for policy-based loan; MEF through SNIF secretariat for \nproject loan \n(iv)  Implementation unit  MEF\u2013SNIF Secretariat, 2 MEF, 7 contractual staff plus part-time technical \ninput. \nProcurement  NCB and Shopping  190 contracts  $17.2 million                  \n(civil works)   \nShopping (vehicle,  4 contracts  $0.11 million \nequipment, furniture) \nConsulting services  LCS  4 contracts  $0.50 million \nICS  5 contracts  $0.46 million \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nThe proceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB's Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related \nRequirements for Program Loans, 1998. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultants selection, LCS = least-cost selection, MCS = Ministry \nof Civil Service, MEF = Ministry of Economy and Finance, MOI = Ministry of Interior, NCB = national competitive \nbidding, SNIF = Sub-National Investment Fund.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  The program impact assessment estimates that the reform program adds approximately  \n$170 million to GDP (equivalent to 1.2% in 2012). The benefits arise from improved state \nallocative efficiency (decentralization of service delivery) and improved revenue collection. The \n                                                \n13 Inclusion of taxes and duties on ADB-financed project expenditures is consistent with the country partnership \nstrategy (footnote 6, above). Financing of taxes and duties does not represent an excessive share of the project \ncost and is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n \n ", "8 \ncosts of the reform program, including the fiscal costs of implementing reforms and related \nadministrative  costs  total  $65  million.  Thus,  the  program  will  provide  a  net  benefit  to  the \neconomy of $105 million.14 The sample projects under the SNIF are expected to generate \neconomic internal rates of return of around 13%, equivalent to earlier small-scale infrastructure \ninitiatives supported by ADB and other development partners.15 Selected projects under the \nSNIF that focus on infrastructure and investment initiatives are expected to offer substantial \nhigher  rates  of  economic  return.  To  ensure  its financial  sustainability,  the government  will \ncommit an annual budget allocation to the SNIF based on the national budget adopted in the \nprevious year, and defined as a percentage of recurrent revenue. The applied percentages are \n0.02% for 2016, 0.04% for 2017,  and increasing to 0.07% in 2020. The expected budget \nallocation will cover recurrent costs and provide an increasing contribution to the SNIF. On this \nbasis, implementation of the project is deemed financially sustainable.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  Efforts to reform public financial management have produced demonstrated results. A \nnew budget classification system and chart of accounts have been implemented, and financial \nmanagement  information  systems  at  the  MEF  and  provincial  treasuries  have  been \nstrengthened.16 To improve transparency and accountability, reforms have been initiated to \nfocus on: program budgeting; linking budgets to sector policies, outputs, and outcomes; and, \nestablishing ministries as budget entities \u2013granting further discretion over their resources and \nthus facilitating decentralization. While improvements in Cambodia\u2019s procurement system are \nnoted,  domestically  financed  procurement  through  noncompetitive  and  informal  procedures \nremains common. Implementing regulations for the Public Procurement Law are being finalized \nand  the  government  has  undertaken  procurement  capacity  development  for  subnational \nadministrations. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the NCDD-S and the MEF. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  Subnational  democratic  development  through  decentralization  is  expected  to  assist \npoverty reduction in Cambodia.  As more public services are delegated to local communities, \nconstituents will benefit from a more efficient matching of local preferences and expenditure \ndecisions. These arrangements will create more business opportunities for local suppliers to \nexpand their businesses, providing positive impacts on the local economy and reducing poverty. \nStakeholders  will  also  benefit  from  the  increased  social  accountability  which  arises  from \nparticipatory planning and budgeting by subnational administrations.  \n \n30.  Gender and subnational democratic development. Subprogram 2 is categorized as \neffective  gender  mainstreaming  under  current  ADB  gender  mainstreaming  guidelines.  The \nprogram mainstreams gender in strategic plans and supports the development of regulations \nthat apply quotas and targets for female employment in civil service. The decentralization of \npriority services such as health and rural water supply is accompanied by the adoption of \ntargets for training local female counselors and local civil service, as well as the recruitment of \nfemale coaches and provincial advisers. Finally, the gender action plan aims to ensure that:  \n                                                \n14 See revised Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 External Advisory Panel. 2015.

Phnom Penh. \n ", "9 \n(i) gender is adequately addressed and mainstreamed into the SNIF operational plan; (ii) gender \nequity and women\u2019s empowerment issues will be incorporated in the SNIF investment projects; \n(iii) participation in local planning by women from affected communities is ensured; (iv) female \nofficials from subnational administrations are appointed to the project facilitator team; and,  \n(v) sex-disaggregated data is recorded through SNIF operations.17 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n31.  Safeguards due diligence and a review of the policy matrix indicate that policy actions \nwill have manageable impacts on the environment, and no impacts on involuntary resettlement, \nand  indigenous  peoples. Nevertheless,  the  project  has  adopted  clear  screening  criteria  to \nproactively identify and prevent risks arising from involuntary resettlement and negative impacts \non indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Further, \nthe project design ensures that there will be adequate capacity in the SNIF Secretariat to screen \nthe  projects.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment  and  C  for  social \nsafeguards. There will be no land acquisition associated with implementation of projects under \nthe SNIF, as local investment project works are restricted to existing government land that will \nhave clear titles and be free of encumbrances. These lands will not be occupied or productively \nused by legal or non-titled occupants. A monitoring and grievance redress mechanism will \nmediate any unexpected impacts. \n \n32.  The SNIF Secretariat will review proposed local investment projects to ensure they \nobserve  safeguard  categorization.  Review  and  field  visits  will  confirm  that  environmental \nimplications are limited. An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been \nattached to the PAM and establishes rules, procedures, and institutional arrangements to be \nundertaken to identify, monitor, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts due to small civil \nworks activities \u2013the expected value of each project will not exceed $100,000. The EARF \nestablishes procedures for all local investment projects financed by the SNIF in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  government\u2019s  legislation  on  environmental \nmanagement.  These  procedures  will  guide  project  selection,  screening  and  categorization, \nenvironmental assessment, and preparation and implementation of environmental management \nplans (EMPs) of selected projects. The guidelines under the EARF include a construction site \nchecklist, environmental design criteria, and standardized environmental management plans. \nThe guidelines will be implemented by the district administrations and supported by the SNIF \nSecretariat. Relevant documents will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The SNIF Secretariat will \nbuild the capacity of participating districts to assist with the identification and submission of the \nfirst  batch  of  projects.  The  SNIF  Secretariat  safeguards  specialist  will  support  capacity \ndevelopment for districts, and will provide backstopping to districts as they prepare their plans. \nAt the district level, the district engineer will be the focus of the capacity building efforts on \nenvironmental assessment. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n33.   Major risks include resistance to the devolution of functions by the national government. \nFunctional assignments may translated into unfunded mandates through a lack of progress in \nestablishing subnational own sources of revenue, delays in developing the ability of subnational \nadministrations to assume newly assigned functions, and procurement and corruption risks.18  \n                                                \n17 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \nThe program will address these risks through the establishment and implementation of the SNIF, \nwhich will provide subnational administrations with investment funds for local priorities. The use \nof TA resources will ensure districts and municipalities have access to tax revenues, and will \nensure provincial resource centers provide demand-driven, hands-on mentoring to districts and \ncommunes. Proper fiduciary arrangements including procurement, a review committee, and \ninvestment audit are in place. Overall, unmitigated risk is considered medium to high but given \nthe mitigation measures, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to overweight the \ncosts. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n34.  The government and the NCDD-S have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and NCDD-S have agreed with ADB on \ncertain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  project  loan  agreement. The \ngovernment  has  agreed  that  the  policy-based  loan  will  not  be  declared  effective  until  the \ngovernment, through NCDD-S, has fulfilled all conditions for subprogram 2 policy-based loan as \nset out in the policy matrix in Appendix 4.  \n \n35.   No withdrawals will be made from the project loan account until all SNIF contractual staff \npositions to be funded by the government and listed in Annex 1 of the PAM have been filled by \nqualified professionals through competitive selection process in accordance with the terms of \nreference and qualification requirements provided in the said Annex 1 to the PAM. \n  \nV.
