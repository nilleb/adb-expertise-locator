I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $35,000,000 in Multiples Private Equity Fund III Limited in India. \n \n2.  Multiples Private Equity Fund III Limited (the feeder fund) is a Mauritian public limited \ncompany, which will invest in Multiples Private Equity Fund III (the fund), a targeted $750 million \nIndian investment trust.1 The fund proposes to invest in growth stage opportunities in middle-\nmarket companies (with enterprise values ranging from $150 million to $500 million) in India.2 It \nmay also selectively consider control-oriented and early-stage investment opportunities. Target \nsectors are consumer, finance, health care and pharmaceuticals, and technology.  \n \n3.  Rationale for proposed ADB assistance. India is currently the world\u2019s seventh-largest \neconomy and its economy grew at an average of 7% annually since 2008. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) forecasts growth of 7.3% in 2018 and 7.6% in 2019.3 The rapid economic growth is \nexpanding India\u2019s middle class and increasing disposable incomes, which is in turn driving \ndiscretionary consumption-led opportunities across several sectors, including finance, health \ncare, and consumer services.4 Growth in these sectors is being driven by (i) a substantial increase \nin discretionary spending; (ii) the rise of tier 2 cities and rural towns, which will be India\u2019s next \ngrowth engines; and (iii) favorable demographics, with approximately 60% of the population in the \nworking age bracket. Companies in these sectors require capital for expansion to enable them to \nmeet the needs of India\u2019s growing middle class. \n \n4.  India has undergone a series of macro reforms since the general elections of 2014. Newly \nenacted policies are expected to enhance the transparency and efficiency of India\u2019s economy, \nfostering an improved business environment for private companies, and a favorable investment \nclimate for institutional investors.5 Given this context, ADB\u2019s investment in Multiples Private Equity \nFund III Limited will help (i) provide adequate capital to private sector companies and catalyze \ntheir  development  while  tapping  into  India\u2019s  growing  middle  class,  (ii)  support  the  Indian \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to increase the transparency and efficiency of the economy by improving \ncorporate governance of portfolio companies, and (iii) contribute to private sector job creation and \nincreased tax revenues for the Government of India. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n5.  Description. Multiples Alternate Asset Management Private Limited (Multiples) is an \nIndia-focused, independent, and well-respected private equity fund manager. Founder and chief \nexecutive officer (CEO) Renuka Ramnath, a seasoned private equity investment professional, \nestablished Multiples in 2009. Prior to forming Multiples, Ramnath was managing director and \n \n1  The fund size may increase to $1.15 billion if the board of the feeder fund exercises an option to do so, and if co-\ninvestments are included within the feeder fund.  \n2  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n3  ADB. 2018. Asian Development Outlook 2018 Update: Maintaining Stability Amid Heightened Uncertainty. Manila. \n4  Bain & Company. 2017. India Private Equity Report 2017 indicates the services sector experienced particularly strong \ngrowth, and its contribution to gross domestic product increased to 54%. Financial services, insurance, real estate \nand professional services grew at around 10%, leading overall growth in the sector. \n5  New policies include initiatives, policies, and legal changes such as Make In India initiative (September 2014), \namendments in Foreign Exchange Management Act (December 2015), Startup India initiative (January 2016), \nDemonetization (November 2016), and Goods and Services Tax Act (July 2017). \n ", "2    \n \nCEO of ICICI Venture, one of India\u2019s earliest alternative asset managers, where she managed \nmore than $2 billion in private equity, mezzanine, and real estate assets.6 [This information has \nbeen removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, \npara. 17.2.(v)].7 Multiples has a 14-member investment team based in Mumbai, India.  \n \n6.  Multiples is currently raising its third private equity fund, Multiples Private Equity Fund III, \nwhich is established as an investment trust registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of \nIndia as a category 2 alternative investment fund (AIF) vehicle, with a target capitalization of $750 \nmillion (footnote 1). Multiples Equity Fund Trustee Private Limited, incorporated in India, is the \ntrustee of the fund. The trustee has appointed Multiples Alternate Asset  Management Limited \n(Multiples), a company incorporated in India, to act as the fund manager under an investment \nmanagement agreement.8  \n \n7.  Investment  identification. In  the  process  of market  mapping  India\u2019s  private  equity \nlandscape, ADB met with over 35 Indian fund managers that provide growth equity capital to \nsmall- to middle-market companies. ADB shortlisted five of these fund managers\u2014including \nMultiples\u2014as potential partners, based on their alignment with ADB\u2019s private equity investment \nguidelines, including performance track record, access to deal flow, and operational expertise. \n \n8.  ADB first met the Multiples team in February 2015 and since then has actively tracked the \nplatform through regular interactions with Ramnath and her team. These meetings, as well as \ndiscussions with existing limited partners, confirmed that Ramnath has developed Multiples into \na high-quality institutional platform, as reflected by its proprietary investment frameworks to \nensure consistency in process, a collaborative culture that emphasizes a cohesive approach to \ndeal evaluation, and governance and reporting standards in line with global best practices. ADB \nwas also attracted to Multiples\u2019 investment approach of identifying and partnering with best-in-\nclass  companies  across  sectors through  both minority  and  control,  and  occasionally  listed \ninvestments. These targeted companies are established businesses, although Multiples also \nselectively  invests  in  early-stage  opportunities  where  valuations  and  growth  prospects  are \nattractive. In all cases, however, Multiples positions itself as a long-term partner to entrepreneurs \nthat  helps  investee  companies  become  industry-leading  businesses  and  create  value  for \nshareholders. The proposed investment would allow ADB to contribute to India\u2019s continued \neconomic growth through an established private equity platform that invests in sectors closely \naligned with ADB\u2019s developmental mandate, including financial services and health care. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n9.  The fund aims to make 11\u221214 investments of $20 million to $80 million each. The fund \nmay also consider transactions above $100 million, for which co-investment capital will be \nrequired. The fund\u2019s targeted sectors are consumer, finance, health care and pharmaceuticals, \nand technology. The fund will primarily invest in minority growth opportunities but has the flexibility \nto opportunistically pursue control-oriented and/or early-stage investments, as well as private \ninvestments in public companies. \n  \n10.  Multiples frequently identifies companies undergoing generational ownership changes, \n \n6  ICICI Venture is an alternative asset management affiliate of ICICI Bank, the largest private sector financial services \ngroup in India. \n7  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n8  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)].

In these situations, Multiples acts as a \nchange enabler by helping these businesses, including emerging business models, achieve their \ngrowth  potential. 9  Companies  with  emerging  business  models  also  offer  high  growth \nopportunities, given the limited competition. Multiples positions itself as a patient investor in these \ncompanies and guides their promoters in developing systems and processes to enable them to \nincrease profitability while maintaining high standards of corporate governance. Lastly, given the \ncurrent stress in the Indian banking system and tightening of asset regulations by India\u2019s central \nbank, Multiples has the experience and expertise to facilitate a company turnaround, although \nsuch investments will be made selectively. \n \nC.

The fund will have a 10-year term from final closing, which may be extended \nby two 1-year extensions, and further extended subject to AIF regulations in India and approval \nby two-thirds of investors by value of investment. The anticipated exit strategies for the fund\u2019s \ninvestments include public offerings, trade sales of portfolio companies to local and foreign \nstrategic buyers, and secondary sales to other private equity funds.  \n \n23.

ADB \nwill review this information and follow-up with the fund manager if more information or clarification \nare needed.
