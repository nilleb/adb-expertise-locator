I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Turkmenistan for the North\u2013South Railway Project.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Strategic context. The Government of Turkmenistan signed a multilateral agreement \nwith its neighboring countries in October 2007 to construct a north\u2013south railway line to promote \nregional trade, cooperation, and integration. This will be the region\u2019s main route for transporting \nbulk goods, such as oil and oil products, minerals, agricultural products, and textiles. The \nplanned  934.5-kilometer  (km)  railway  line2 (single  track  with  diesel  traction)  will  connect \nTurkmenistan with its neighboring countries to the north and south. Under Islamic Development \nBank  (IDB)  assistance,  338.5  km  of  railway  track  south  from  Bereket  is  being  laid.  The \ngovernment is financing the laying of 466.0 km of track for the northern section of the line (from \nBereket to the Kazakhstan border). Both sections are scheduled to be completed in 2011. The \nGovernment  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  for  the  design, \nprocurement, and installation of the power supply, as well as signaling and telecommunication \nsystems, for 311 km of the completed northern railway section between Bereket and Buzkhun. \nProcurement and installation of the power supply and signaling and telecommunication systems \nfor the southern part is included in the IDB-assisted project; for the remaining northern section, it \nis planned through Government financing. \n \n3.  The north\u2013south railway line will improve Turkmenistan's accessibility to Kazakhstan, the \nPersian Gulf countries, the Russian Federation, and South Asia. It will also increase regional \ntrade. The project will contribute to sustainable economic growth in Turkmenistan and the \ndevelopment of an integrated and efficient railway system in the region. The project will reduce \ntransport costs, cut travel times, and improve accessibility to rural areas of the country. This will \ngenerate benefits beyond savings in railway transport costs and time. Experience in Africa and \nEurope indicates that transit traffic is usually a lucrative business for railways, governments, and \nthe  service  sector  (including  logistics).  Commercial  mineral  resources  in  areas  along  the \nalignment could be developed because of the heavy-haul capacity of the railway. The new line \nwill  also  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  Awaza  National  Tourism  Zone  Project3 in \nTurkmenistan by simplifying the transport of construction materials and logistics support.  \n \n4.  Railway  sector.  Turkmenistan\u2019s  railway  system  uses  the  1,520  millimeter  gauge \ncommon to the former Soviet railways. When Turkmenistan gained independence in 1991, the \nrailway had 2,268 km of operational lines; in 2010 the system has 3,110 km. The principal \nroutes  include  multiple  connections  with  neighboring  countries,  including  Afghanistan, \nAzerbaijan, Iran, and Uzbekistan. Rehabilitation of a railway line to northern Afghanistan is \nplanned to begin in 2011. \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The planned north\u2013south railway line has two parts: (i) the Uzen\u2013Bereket line (596.0 km) in the north (466 km \nthrough Turkmenistan from Bereket to the Kazakhstan border and 130 km through Kazakhstan from its border to \nUzen) to be financed by the governments of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan for the sections located in their \nterritories; and (ii) the Bereket\u2013Atrek\u2013Gorgan line (338.5 km) in the south from Bereket (256.5 km through \nTurkmenistan and 82.0 km through Iran) to be financed by the Islamic Development Bank.  \n3  As per Turkmenistan presidential decree signed in October 2008, the Awaza National Tourism Zone Project is to \nbe implemented by the Awaza National Project Committee.  \n ", "2   \n5.  The north\u2013south railway line will reduce by about 680 km the distance for transportation \nof goods from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf ports, according to government data. The line is \nexpected to become an important link in the transcontinental transport corridor. According to \ninitial projections, about 3\u20134 million tons are expected to be transported on the line by 2015, and \nincreasing to more than 13 million tons in 2020. \n \n6.  The railway plays a major role in transportation in Turkmenistan. In 2008, 25.4 million \ntons of freight was moved by rail, with an average length of haul of 454 km. While road transport \nmoved  more  tonnage  (560.5  million  tons),  the  average  length  of  haul  was  only  17 km. \nPassenger transport shows similar results: 6.2 million rail passengers moved an average of 270 \nkm, while 1,065 million road passengers moved an average of 20 km.4 Because major cities are \nfar apart, the long-haul capability of railways in intercity transport is an important contributor to \nTurkmenistan\u2019s economy.  \n \n7.  The Ministry of Railway Transport (MRT) owns, operates, and regulates the railway \nnetwork. Although private freight forwarding companies exist, there are no plans to increase the \nrole of the private sector in railway operations.   \n \n8.  Railway sustainability. The network is being expanded along with recent and planned \nadditions to the locomotive, coach, and freight wagon fleets. The fleets are well maintained and \noperate according to schedules. Reviews of budgets and expenditures indicate that the railway \nsystem  is  solvent  and  should  remain  so  given  the  rising  freight  volumes  and  revenues. \nIncreasing transit traffic is a government priority, and the country is well placed to achieve this \nobjective.  The  MRT  has  adequate  railway  maintenance  equipment.  However,  track \nmaintenance and safety equipment will need to be procured for any new track development. \nThe MRT also requires skills for modern scheduling of routine and periodic maintenance to \nimprove locomotive utilization. Furthermore, the MRT needs training in implementing externally \nfunded projects as the country plans to expand its transportation network through international \nassistance. \n \n9.  Relevance  and  strategic  alignment.  The  proposed  loan  will  be  ADB's  first  to \nTurkmenistan. A country partnership strategy is planned. The project is in line with the Transport \nand Trade Facilitation Strategy of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nprogram5 as it provides a key north\u2013south link between two east\u2013west CAREC corridors. The \nproject is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative because the project railway \nwill (i) be accessible, (ii) be safer than travel by road, (iii) produce less emissions per ton hauled \nthan by road, and (iv) be more affordable than road transport. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the project will be increased trade between Turkmenistan and other \ncountries in the region. The outcome will be better connectivity with neighboring countries and \nan efficient, safe, and reliable railway transport network in Turkmenistan. By utilizing rail instead \nof road to haul freight and passengers, air pollution will be reduced. \n \n                                                 \n4  National Statistics Department. 2009.

The outputs will be as follows6: \n(i)  Power, signaling, and telecommunication systems will be procured and installed \nfor 311 km of the completed railway line between Bereket and Buzkhun. This \nsection  does  not  involve  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  are  not  anticipated.  The  power  supply \ncomponent covers design, supply, installation, and commissioning of two 10.0-\nkilovolt  overhead  power  lines,  a  distribution  system,  substations,  and  a \nsupervisory control and data acquisition  system. Training on the supervisory \ncontrol and data acquisition system will also be provided under this component, \nincluding environmental mitigation as required. The signaling component covers \ndesign, installation, and commissioning of signaling equipment including training \nand environmental mitigation as required. The telecommunication component \ncovers  the  supply,  installation,  and  commissioning  of  mobile  train  radio \ncommunication and a long distance telecommunication network, and training. \n(ii)  Equipment  procured  for  track  maintenance  and  safety  will  include  ballast \ncleaning and sand removal machines, hot box detectors, and train derailment \nsensors. These important train safety technologies, which have not been used in \nTurkmenistan, will lead to more capacity and more efficient train operations. \n(iii)  The institutional capacity of the MRT will be improved and project management \nsupport will be provided. The following outputs are envisaged:  \n(a)  Locomotive  utilization  improvement  and  asset  management.  This \nsubcomponent will focus on modern scheduling of routine and periodic \nmaintenance to improve locomotive availability and reliability throughout \nthe MRT network. An asset management system will be developed and \nstaff will be trained to update and maintain the inventory of all MRT \nassets and asset utilization data annually. \n(b)  Environmental monitoring and management. This subcomponent will \ninclude  implementing  the  environmental  monitoring  and  management \nplan  for  the  project  following  ADB  guidelines,  but  will  also  focus  on \nestablishing an environmental unit within the MRT. Staff will be trained \nand the MRT\u2019s environmental policy and standard operating procedures \nwill  be  prepared  in  conformity  with  government  regulations  and \ninternational practice. \n(c)  Procurement,  project  administration,  and  financial  management. \nConsulting  services  for  this  subcomponent  will  help  to  complete  the \nproject in a timely manner, but will also support the MRT in developing \ngreater  capacity  in  managing  loans  and  in  international  competitive \nbidding. This will focus on improving the MRT\u2019s staff capacity in project \nmanagement,  sound  financial  control,  design  confirmation, \nimplementation  supervision  for  day-to-day  oversight  of  contractors\u2019 \nprogress, quality assurance, testing and commissioning of equipment, \nsafeguards review, and timely reporting of progress to the government \nand ADB. These will become important assets as the country expands its \ntransportation  network  through  international  assistance.  This \nsubcomponent will also look into new railway financing modalities and the \nuse of public\u2013private initiatives. \n                                                 \n6  The effectively achieve the outcome, the Government will consider ADB\u2019s financing for track rehabilitation and \nexpansion as subsequent interventions. \n ", "4   \nD.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $125  million  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will cover the costs of equipment, institutional \ncapacity improvement, environment mitigation, and part of the contingencies. The government \nwill cover local taxes and duties, recurrent costs, and part of the contingencies. The financing \nplan is in Table 2. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  125.0    75.0 \nGovernment  41.7    25.0 \n    Total  166.7    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.          \n3.  Loan Terms \n14.  Because of its internal administrative processes, the government has indicated a strong \npreference for a loan with the interest rate being fixed at loan signing. This would require certain \nchanges to ADB's LIBOR-based loan product. To allow the government greater flexibility in \nchoosing the loan product that best fits its needs, it is proposed to offer the government two \noptions. Both options will provide loans with a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nand a commitment charge of 0.15% per year.7 \n15.  The first option will be ADB\u2019s standard OCR loan with an annual interest rate and other \n                                                 \n7  ADB\u2019s Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations Applicable to LIBOR-Based Loans Made from ADB's Ordinary \nCapital Resources, dated 1 July 2001, will apply to either loan, subject to modifications that may be included under \neach respective loan agreement. \n ", "  5\nterms and conditions determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The \nsecond option will be a loan with an interest rate fixed at loan signing. The fixed-interest loan \nterms  will  follow  cost  pass-through  pricing,  which  is  the  principle  of  ADB's  asset\u2013liability \nmanagement policy.8 Pricing of the fixed-interest loan will include the standard contractual \nlending spread applicable to ADB's sovereign OCR loans, but the cost base rate will be based \non ADB's cost of funding and/or hedging the fixed-rate loan, as well as other risk components \nrelated  to  fixed-interest  loans.  This  will  entail  certain  waivers  from  ADB\u2019s  lending  policy,9 \nincluding (i) the interest rate being fixed at loan signing; (ii) rebate and surcharge on funding \ncost margin not being applied; and (iii) a cancellation fee being charged to pass on any costs \nincurred as a result of rate-fixing. Before loan signing, the government will provide ADB with (a) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow on these terms and conditions, and (b) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The MRT will be the executing agency. Its Construction and Civil Structures Department, \nwhich has the mandate for all construction and procurement works of the MRT, will be the \nimplementation agency. The MRT\u2019s Power Supply and Communication Department, which is \nmainly  responsible  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  power  supply,  signaling  and \ntelecommunication,  will  support  the  implementing  agency  and  coordinate  all  the  MRT \ndepartments. An international firm will be engaged as project management consultants. The \nproject management consultants will manage contracts with the Construction and Civil Structures \nDepartment and the Power Supply and Communication Department, as well as provide hands-on \ntraining in project management and oversight, financial management, operation and maintenance, \nasset management, and reporting. As this will be ADB\u2019s first project in Turkmenistan, the MRT\u2019s \nrelated departments will improve their capacity to implement externally funded projects. Thus, the \nproject will not include a conventional project management unit. Contracts will include premiums \nas  incentive  and  penalties  to  encourage  timely  completion  within  the  contract  period.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual.10 \n17.  The procurement of goods will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). International competitive bidding (ICB) will be \nused for goods contracts estimated to cost $1 million and above. National competitive bidding is \nnot applicable. Three contract packages are proposed: package 1 (design, supply, and installation \nof power supply, signaling, and telecom) using the one stage\u2013two envelope modality; package 2 \n(supply of track machinery and supply and installation of safety equipment); and package 3 \n(consulting services).  \n18.  Consultants will be recruited according to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). A total of 176 person-months of consulting services (64 \ninternational, 112 national) grouped into one package will be funded under the project to support \nthe MRT in (i) design review and implementation supervision; (ii) train operations management, \n(iii) environmental monitoring, (iv) procurement management, and (v) project implementation \nand institutional capacity improvement. Consultants will be engaged using quality- and cost-\nbased selection, with the standard ratio of 80:20.  \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  Due diligence for the project included an assessment of the project investment plan, \noperational  cost  structure,  and  maintenance  requirements.  The  design  features  and \nconstruction standards of the completed 311 km of railway and its complementarities with the \nexisting system were also reviewed.  \n21.  The existing railway system has adequate capacity in terms of locomotive power, wagon \navailability for the expected commodities, line capacity, and a well-trained and experienced \nworkforce. The selection of the main alignment of the railway was based on the shortest \ndistance from the junction to the existing railway, and the efficiency of service for villages within \nthe project area was emphasized. Impacts on land acquisition, involuntary resettlement, and \narable agricultural lands were avoided. The MRT selected a track alignment that minimizes the \neffects of the barchans, which make construction and track maintenance difficult. The sand \nremoval machines included in the project will ensure efficient removal of sand.  \n22.  The  detailed  design  of  the  newly  laid  railway  line  and  its  safety  aspects  during \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance were reviewed. The railway line was built following \ninternational standards with state-of-the art components for track construction. Sub-grade and \nalignment were well designed and properly constructed. Materials, such as sleepers and rail, \nare  state-of-the-art  for  a  rail  line  that  will  carry  about  3  million\u201315  million  tons  annually. \nAccording to the Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer,11 this type of rail has an economic \nlife corresponding to at least 800 million gross tons. Therefore, it will not need to be replaced for \nat least 50 years. The concrete sleepers will have a similar life. The signaling system and safety \nenhancement  devices  included  in  the  project  will  promote  safe  train  operations  after \ncommissioning. The proposed electronic interlocking at stations and automatic signaling will \nprovide  positive  train  separation.  The  mobile  train  radio  system  and  long  distance \n                                                 \n11 Paris-based International railway union that sets and publishes railway material and design standards. \n ", "  7\ntelecommunications  network  will  facilitate  efficient  railway  operations.  Other  state-of-the-art \ntechnologies to be applied under the project include (i) electronic interlocking, cab signaling, \nlight-emitting diode-lit color light automatic signals directly controlled by audio frequency; and (ii) \na long distance network based on optical fiber cables with synchronous transport modules 1 and \n16 equipment. Since electric power is only available at the existing Bereket station, the power \nsupply network included in the project will provide reliable power for efficient train operations. \nSafety enhancement devices, including defective bearing detectors and dragging and derailed \nequipment detectors, are also included in the project to enhance operational safety. Collectively, \nthe  items  included  in  project  will  support  safer  and  more  efficient  train  operations,  and \nsignificantly enhance the long-term capacity of the railway. \n23.  The  MRT's  staffing  capacity  for  railway  operation,  including  experience  in  sand \noperations  and  operating  rolling  stock  and  locomotives  to  handle  the  forecast  tonnage,  is \nadequate. The locomotive fleet has sufficient capacity to handle the incremental volume that is \nexpected  on  the  new  line,  but  improvements  in  locomotive  productivity  are  required.  The \ninstitutional capacity improvement under the project will enhance the MRT\u2019s management and \nimplementation  capacity.  Traffic  forecasts  include  newly  generated,  road-diverted,  and  rail-\ndiverted freight and passenger traffic. Based on these forecasts, train operations within the \nestablished tonnage parameters are predicted. These volumes fit well within the design capacity \nof the new line, increasing to 22 trains per day by 2020. \n \nB.  Economic \n24.  The economic evaluation covered all the project components, including track machinery \nand fixtures, signaling, power supply, telecommunications, design review and implementation \nsupervision, and capacity improvement.  In addition, the associated completed works on the 311 \nkm of the north\u2013south railway, including track, stations and rolling stock, have been factored into \nthe economic evaluation. Annual operating costs have also been included in the analysis. \n25.  Economic benefits include (i) user cost savings for freight and passenger traffic; (ii) time \nsavings  for  diverted  passenger  and  freight  traffic  from  buses,  trucks,  and  other  rail  lines; \n(iii) benefits attributable to generated traffic; (iv) more tourism; (v) shipper savings because of \nincreased  railway  competition;  (vi)  avoided  road  accidents;  (vii)  less  pollution;  (viii) energy \nsavings; and (ix) higher national productivity. \n26.  The economic internal rate of return for the project is 16.65%. Benefits from freight \ntraffic, including benefits attributable to generated traffic, are the major economic benefits, with \npassenger benefits  contributing  minimally,  and  other  benefits  making  up  the  balance.  The \nsensitivity analysis tested 10 scenarios to assess the robustness of the results of the economic \nanalysis. The total cost would have to be more than 28.0% higher than estimated for the \neconomic internal rate of return to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. A 1-year delay in completion \nwould reduce the net present value by 52%. Combinations of adverse effects on benefits and \ncosts were also tested. The results showed that the project would maintain its economic viability \nunder plausible scenarios of variability in key parameters. \nC.  Financial \n27.  Financial sustainability for the project was assessed. The government has very low \nlevels of debt, and its revenues and surpluses are increasing as more of the country\u2019s gas fields \nare developed. The country has the world\u2019s fourth-largest gas fields, which will be brought into \n ", "8   \nproduction in the near future.12 The railway is sufficiently solvent to increase the length of its \nnetwork, purchase additional new rolling stock, and upgrade its technologies. Importantly, the \nrailway is strongly committed to maintenance, and maintenance schedules are fully followed. \nCosts have been reduced and train schedules are met with only a few service interruptions.  \n28.  The project railway will be largely for freight and will attract considerable transit traffic.  \nFreight tariffs are adequate to meet all project costs. Passenger tariffs are low and cross- \nsubsidized  by  freight  revenues,  which  is  common  in  many  countries.  The  project  will  be \nsustainable and provide considerable benefits to the country and to the areas along the railway.  \n \nD.  Governance \n29.  A governance assessment was undertaken as part of the due diligence process. This \nfocused on the legal framework, regulation, strength of enforcement regimes, capacity of the \nMRT, human resources, and risk of corruption. \n30.  On 25 September 2008, Turkmenistan adopted a new Constitution, which gives the \nParliament full legislative authority. The Parliament has the power to (i) pass laws; (ii) amend \nthe Constitution; (iii) approve the state budget; (iv) set dates for the elections of the President, \nmembers of the legislature, and local governing bodies; and (v) ratify or reject international \ntreaties.  Parliament  also  renders  binding  interpretations  of  laws  and  determines  the \nconstitutionality of legal acts issued by the executive branch of government.  \n31.  The  Law  of  Turkmenistan  on  Railway  Transport  (enacted  on  15  September  1998) \ndesignates the MRT to undertake all investments in infrastructure, rolling stock, and other fixed \nassets; and to operate freight and passenger trains on its tracks. MRT investments and tariffs \nare subject to the approval of the cabinet of ministers. The MRT does not receive a special \nsubsidy from the government and is expected to cover its operating costs through freight and \npassenger revenues. A special budgetary appropriation is made to finance large infrastructure \ninvestments that aim to improve network capacity and the efficiency of operations.  \n32.  The  country  has  established  adequate  budgetary  controls  and  oversight  to  ensure \nefficiency and accountability. The legal frameworks for managing public finances have been \ntightened. In line with this, the MRT has an accounting system that allows for the proper \nrecording of financial transactions, including the allocation of expenditures to the respective \ncomponents of development projects. The accounting system is available and interconnected \nwith  the  State  Bank  for  Foreign  Economic  Affairs.  Controls  are  in  place  concerning  the \npreparation and approval of transactions, ensuring that all transactions are correctly made. The \nMRT has an internal audit department with qualified and experienced staff. The MRT financial \nstatements are audited regularly by an independent auditor, the Supreme Chamber of Control.13 \n33.  A major issue is the public procurement process and price verification for all foreign-\nfunded contracts and contract variations. All major contracts under the proposed project will be \nsubjected to ICB and direct payment procedures. This increases oversight and helps mitigate \ncorruption. The verification contributes to good governance, but sometimes creates project \nimplementation delays. ADB and the government have agreed on actions to reduce these \ndelays by sharing databases and other information on cost estimates and sources. The MRT \n                                                 \n12 R. Paxton. 2010. Turkmen Gas Fields Need Deals, Oil Majors Keen. Reuters. 18 November. \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE6AH0OS20101118. \n13 On 14 July 2007, media reported that the Supreme Chamber of Control of Turkmenistan was established for \n\u201cenforcing control of execution of legal acts of Turkmenistan on the issues of financial-economic activity, safety, \nlegality  and  efficient  use  and  allocation  of  state  property  and  financial  resources.\u201d \nwww.turkmenistan.ru/en/node/5906.  \n ", "  9\nwill  need  to  improve  further  its  systems  and  transparency  by  including  on  its  webpage \ninformation on its performance, the status of each contract under the project, the list of business \nopportunities, and a summary of the bidding process and its guidelines. This would be a major \npublic disclosure breakthrough. Institutional capacity improvements included in the project will \nmainly focus on MRT staff training in procurement, project administration, and sound financial \nmanagement. Project management support through international and national consultants, and \ngreater  institutional  capacity,  will  result  in  project  oversight,  ensuring  good  quality  in \nimplementation, timely project completion, and compliance with ADB guidelines and policies.  \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MRT. The project will have a strong internal and external auditing \npresence. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nproject administration manual (footnote 10). \n \nE.  Poverty and Social \n35.  The project is not a targeted intervention. It does not address poverty reduction through \nstandard direct actions at the level of households, or involve specific services that address the \ngeographical determinants of poverty. The project will not exacerbate gender inequities.   \n36.  About 3,200 people live in nine villages 3\u201310 km from the railway line. They are involved \nmainly  in  sheep  herding.  The  project  impact  area  is  arid  with  only  limited  water  sources. \nSummers and winters have extreme temperatures.   \n37.  In addition to the train crews, the railway will employ about 175\u2013200 people at 12 \nstations on the line north of Bereket. About 100 of these positions will be filled by people from \nthe local areas. Small shops and restaurants will also be set up at the new passenger and \nfreight stations at nine locations.  \n38.  While economic activity is currently limited in the project impact area, it contains mineral \nresources that could not be exploited before because of the lack of low-cost transport. The \nrailway will enable the exploitation of these deposits, including coal, gold, kaolin, and platinum. \nTherefore, the project will generate additional jobs and improve mobility and access to health \nand other services for people living in the project impact area.   \nF.  Safeguards \n39.  The project will not have any major environmental impacts. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  and  is  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. The investments will not result in regional or international environmental impacts. \nInstallation of signaling and telecommunication under the project, and the completed 311 km of \nrailway  track  under  government  financing,  does  not  involve  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement,  or  affect  ethnic  minority  groups.  The  project\u2019s  rights-of-way  were  established \nduring the Soviet era, and the land use of the area has not changed since then. The project is \nclassified as category C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous people. A social \nsafeguard diligence report was prepared during project preparation.14 \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  Table 4 summarizes the major risks and mitigating measures, focusing mainly on the \n                                                 \n14 Due Diligence Report on Land Acquisition and Resettlement (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "10  \ncapacity of the MRT. ADB does not have operational experience in Turkmenistan, and the MRT \nhas not administered projects funded by multilateral financing institutions. To mitigate this risk, \nthe  MRT  received  training  under  ADB-financed  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  in \npreparing ICB contract documents of goods in advance. To further support timely bid evaluation \nand  contract  awards  for  goods  and  consultant  selection,  an  international  and  a  national \nprocurement specialist will assist and train the MRT during the initial implementation period until \nall contracts are awarded. During implementation, project management consultants will continue \nto improve the MRT\u2019s capacity.     \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProcurement  International and national individual procurement specialists deputed under the project preparatory \ndelays  technical assistance will continue to help and train the executing agency in the bidding and \nconsultant selection process until all the contracts are awarded and consultants selected. \nProject implementation support and capacity improvement, provided under the project through \nproject management consultants, will help ensure timely procurement and implementation, in \naddition to transparency.  \nProject  Project implementation support and capacity improvement provided as a project component \nimplementation  through project management consultants \ndelays \nMandatory completion of all ongoing civil works by December 2011 on sections of the north\u2013south \nrailway line funded by the government and Islamic Development Bank as per the Turkmenistan \npresidential decree for the north\u2013south railway line, and according to the multilateral agreement \nwith its neighboring countries, including Kazakhstan for the railway section in Kazakhstan. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MRT = Ministry of Railway Transport. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n41.  The government and the MRT have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government and the MRT have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$125,000,000 to Turkmenistan for the North\u2013South Railway Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and \n \n(i)  with interest and such other terms and conditions to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending facility, or  \n \n(ii)  with fixed interest and such other terms and conditions, including certain waivers \nfrom ADB\u2019s lending policy, as described in paragraph 15 of this report. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n17 February 2011 \n ", "Appendix 1  11\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks \nImpact  By 2015    Assumptions \nIncreased trade  Turkmenistan's total  National Statistics  Government sustains \nbetween  external trade increased to  Committee of  policies conducive to \nTurkmenistan and  $17.9 billion (2008  Turkmenistan   economic growth and \nother countries in the  baseline: $11.9 billion)    remains committed to \nregion   regional cooperation \nand integration \n \nOutcome  By 2015    Assumptions \nAn efficient, safe, and  Total national transit  Statistical Review of  Timely institutional \nreliable railway  tonnage increased to  Turkmenistan (annual  strengthening of \ntransport network  6 million tons (2008  publication by National  railway agency to run \ndeveloped and  baseline: 3 million tons)  Statistics Committee of  sustainable railway \noperated in    Turkmenistan)   operation \nTurkmenistan with  About 1.6 million tons of     \nbetter connectivity  minerals transported on the  Traffic surveys by railway  Trade between \nwith neighboring  project railway in 2015  agency (upon project  Kazakhstan, the \ncountries    completion)  Russian Federation, \nPerformance tracking    and the Persian Gulf \nsystem developed  for  MRT annual sector  continues to grow \nperiodic inspection,  performance reports   \nsupervision, and testing    Risks \n  North\u2013south corridor \nBy 2020   may not be completed \nCO  emissions reduced  to  in time due to any \n2\n26,800 tons (2008  unforeseen reason by \nbaseline: estimated at  all parties including \n37,000 tons)  the ongoing work by \nKazakhstan, and on \nIDB- and government-\nfunded sections \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n        \n1.
