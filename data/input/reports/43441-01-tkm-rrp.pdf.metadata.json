The  Government  of  Turkmenistan  signed  a  multilateral  agreement \nwith its neighboring countries in October 2007 to construct a north\u2013south railway line to promote \nregional trade, cooperation, and integration. This will be the region\u2019s main route for transporting \nbulk  goods,  such  as  oil  and  oil  products,  minerals,  agricultural  products,  and  textiles.  The \nplanned  934.5-kilometer  (km)  railway  line 2  (single  track  with  diesel  traction)  will  connect \nTurkmenistan with its neighboring countries to the north and south. Under Islamic Development \nBank  (IDB)  assistance,  338.5  km  of  railway  track  south  from  Bereket  is  being  laid.  The \ngovernment is financing the laying of 466.0 km of track for the northern section of the line (from \nBereket to the Kazakhstan border). Both sections are scheduled to be completed in 2011. The \nGovernment  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  for  the  design, \nprocurement, and installation of the power supply, as well as signaling and telecommunication \nsystems, for 311 km of the completed northern railway section between Bereket and Buzkhun. \nProcurement and installation of the power supply and signaling and telecommunication systems \nfor the southern part is included in the IDB-assisted project; for the remaining northern section, it \nis planned through Government financing. \n \n3. \nThe north\u2013south railway line will improve Turkmenistan's accessibility to Kazakhstan, the \nPersian  Gulf  countries,  the  Russian  Federation,  and  South  Asia.  It  will  also  increase  regional \ntrade.  The  project  will  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  growth  in  Turkmenistan  and  the \ndevelopment of an integrated and efficient railway system in the region. The project will reduce \ntransport costs, cut travel times, and improve accessibility to rural areas of the country. This will \ngenerate benefits beyond savings in railway transport costs and time. Experience in Africa and \nEurope indicates that transit traffic is usually a lucrative business for railways, governments, and \nthe  service  sector  (including  logistics).  Commercial  mineral  resources  in  areas  along  the \nalignment could be developed because of the heavy-haul capacity of the railway. The new line \nwill  also  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  Awaza  National  Tourism  Zone  Project 3  in \nTurkmenistan by simplifying the transport of construction materials and logistics support.  \n \n4. \nRailway  sector.  Turkmenistan\u2019s  railway  system  uses  the  1,520  millimeter  gauge \ncommon to the former Soviet railways. When Turkmenistan gained independence in 1991, the \nrailway  had  2,268  km  of  operational  lines;  in  2010  the  system  has  3,110  km.  The  principal \nincluding  Afghanistan, \nroutes \nAzerbaijan,  Iran,  and  Uzbekistan.  Rehabilitation  of  a  railway  line  to  northern  Afghanistan  is \nplanned to begin in 2011. \n\ninclude  multiple  connections  with  neighboring  countries, \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  planned  north\u2013south  railway  line  has  two  parts:  (i)  the  Uzen\u2013Bereket  line  (596.0  km)  in  the  north  (466  km \nthrough Turkmenistan from Bereket to the Kazakhstan border and 130 km through Kazakhstan from its border to \nUzen)  to  be  financed  by  the  governments  of  Turkmenistan  and  Kazakhstan  for  the  sections  located  in  their \nterritories;  and  (ii)  the  Bereket\u2013Atrek\u2013Gorgan  line  (338.5  km)  in  the  south  from  Bereket  (256.5  km  through \nTurkmenistan and 82.0 km through Iran) to be financed by the Islamic Development Bank.  \n\n3  As per Turkmenistan presidential decree signed in October 2008, the Awaza National Tourism Zone Project is to \n\nbe implemented by the Awaza National Project Committee.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe north\u2013south railway line will reduce by about 680 km the distance for transportation \n5. \nof goods from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf ports, according to government data. The line is \nexpected  to  become  an  important  link  in  the  transcontinental  transport  corridor.  According  to \ninitial projections, about 3\u20134 million tons are expected to be transported on the line by 2015, and \nincreasing to more than 13 million tons in 2020. \n \n6. \nThe  railway  plays  a  major  role  in  transportation  in  Turkmenistan.  In  2008,  25.4  million \ntons of freight was moved by rail, with an average length of haul of 454 km. While road transport \nmoved  more  tonnage  (560.5  million  tons),  the  average  length  of  haul  was  only  17 km. \nPassenger transport shows similar results: 6.2 million rail passengers moved an average of 270 \nkm, while 1,065 million road passengers moved an average of 20 km.4 Because major cities are \nfar apart, the long-haul capability of railways in intercity transport is an important contributor to \nTurkmenistan\u2019s economy.  \n \n7. \nThe  Ministry  of  Railway  Transport  (MRT)  owns,  operates,  and  regulates  the  railway \nnetwork. Although private freight forwarding companies exist, there are no plans to increase the \nrole of the private sector in railway operations.   \n \n8. \nRailway  sustainability. The network is being expanded along with recent and planned \nadditions to the locomotive, coach, and freight wagon fleets. The fleets are well maintained and \noperate according to schedules. Reviews of budgets and expenditures indicate that the railway \nsystem  is  solvent  and  should  remain  so  given  the  rising  freight  volumes  and  revenues. \nIncreasing transit traffic is a government priority, and the country is well placed to achieve this \nobjective.  The  MRT  has  adequate \ntrack \nmaintenance  and  safety  equipment  will  need  to  be  procured  for  any  new  track  development. \nThe  MRT  also  requires  skills  for  modern  scheduling  of  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  to \nimprove locomotive utilization. Furthermore, the MRT needs training in implementing externally \nfunded projects as the country plans to expand its transportation network through international \nassistance. \n \n9. \nRelevance  and  strategic  alignment.  The  proposed  loan  will  be  ADB's  first  to \nTurkmenistan. A country partnership strategy is planned. The project is in line with the Transport \nand  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC) \nprogram5 as  it  provides  a  key  north\u2013south  link  between  two  east\u2013west  CAREC  corridors.  The \nproject  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  because  the  project  railway \nwill (i) be accessible, (ii) be safer than travel by road, (iii) produce less emissions per ton hauled \nthan by road, and (iv) be more affordable than road transport. \n \nB. \n\nrailway  maintenance  equipment.  However, \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  trade  between  Turkmenistan  and  other \n10. \ncountries in the region. The outcome will be better connectivity with neighboring countries and \nan efficient, safe, and reliable railway transport network in Turkmenistan. By utilizing rail instead \nof road to haul freight and passengers, air pollution will be reduced. \n \n\n                                                 \n4  National Statistics Department. 2009.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \n\nThe outputs will be as follows6: \n(i) \n\nPower, signaling, and telecommunication systems will be procured and installed \nfor  311 km  of  the  completed  railway  line  between  Bereket  and  Buzkhun.  This \nsection  does  not  involve  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  are  not  anticipated.  The  power  supply \ncomponent  covers  design,  supply,  installation,  and  commissioning  of  two  10.0-\nkilovolt  overhead  power  lines,  a  distribution  system,  substations,  and  a \nsupervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  system.  Training  on  the  supervisory \ncontrol and data acquisition system will also be provided under this component, \nincluding environmental mitigation as required. The signaling component covers \ndesign, installation, and commissioning of signaling equipment including training \nand  environmental  mitigation  as  required.  The  telecommunication  component \ncovers  the  supply,  installation,  and  commissioning  of  mobile  train  radio \ncommunication and a long distance telecommunication network, and training. \nEquipment  procured  for  track  maintenance  and  safety  will  include  ballast \ncleaning  and  sand  removal  machines,  hot  box  detectors,  and  train  derailment \nsensors. These important train safety technologies, which have not been used in \nTurkmenistan, will lead to more capacity and more efficient train operations. \nThe  institutional  capacity  of  the  MRT  will  be  improved  and  project  management \nsupport will be provided. The following outputs are envisaged:  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nLocomotive  utilization  improvement  and  asset  management.  This \nsubcomponent  will  focus  on  modern  scheduling  of  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance  to  improve  locomotive  availability  and  reliability  throughout \nthe  MRT  network. An  asset  management  system  will  be  developed  and \nstaff  will  be  trained  to  update  and  maintain  the  inventory  of  all  MRT \nassets and asset utilization data annually. \nEnvironmental  monitoring  and  management.  This  subcomponent  will \ninclude  implementing  the  environmental  monitoring  and  management \nplan  for  the  project  following  ADB  guidelines,  but  will  also  focus  on \nestablishing  an  environmental  unit  within  the  MRT.  Staff  will  be  trained \nand  the  MRT\u2019s  environmental  policy  and  standard  operating  procedures \nwill  be  prepared \nin  conformity  with  government  regulations  and \ninternational practice. \nProcurement,  project  administration,  and  financial  management. \nConsulting  services  for  this  subcomponent  will  help  to  complete  the \nproject  in  a  timely  manner,  but  will  also  support  the  MRT  in  developing \ngreater  capacity  in  managing  loans  and  in  international  competitive \nbidding.  This  will  focus  on  improving  the  MRT\u2019s  staff  capacity  in  project \nmanagement, \nconfirmation, \nimplementation  supervision  for  day-to-day  oversight  of  contractors\u2019 \nprogress,  quality  assurance,  testing  and  commissioning  of  equipment, \nsafeguards  review,  and  timely  reporting  of  progress  to  the  government \nand ADB. These will become important assets as the country expands its \ntransportation \nassistance.  This \nsubcomponent will also look into new railway financing modalities and the \nuse of public\u2013private initiatives. \n\ninternational \n\nfinancial \n\nnetwork \n\nthrough \n\ncontrol, \n\ndesign \n\nsound \n\n                                                 \n6  The  effectively  achieve  the  outcome,  the  Government  will  consider  ADB\u2019s  financing  for  track  rehabilitation  and \n\nexpansion as subsequent interventions. \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Plan \n\n12. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $166.7 million equivalent (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\n \n\nAmount \n\nTaxes and duties \nSubtotal (A) \n\n1.

The  loan  will  cover  the  costs  of  equipment,  institutional \ncapacity improvement,  environment mitigation, and  part of the contingencies. The government \nwill  cover local  taxes  and  duties,  recurrent  costs,  and  part of  the contingencies.

This would require certain \nchanges  to  ADB's  LIBOR-based  loan  product.  To  allow  the  government  greater  flexibility  in \nchoosing  the  loan  product  that  best  fits  its  needs,  it  is  proposed  to  offer  the  government  two \noptions. Both options will provide loans with a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nand a commitment charge of 0.15% per year.7 \n\n15. \n\nThe first option will be ADB\u2019s standard OCR loan with an annual interest rate and other \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB\u2019s  Ordinary  Operations  Loan  Regulations  Applicable  to  LIBOR-Based  Loans  Made  from  ADB's  Ordinary \nCapital Resources, dated 1 July 2001, will apply to either loan, subject to modifications that may be included under \neach respective loan agreement. \n\n \n\n\fterms  and  conditions  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The \nsecond  option  will  be  a  loan  with  an  interest  rate  fixed  at  loan  signing.  The  fixed-interest  loan \nterms  will  follow  cost  pass-through  pricing,  which  is  the  principle  of  ADB's  asset\u2013liability \nmanagement  policy. 8  Pricing  of  the  fixed-interest  loan  will  include  the  standard  contractual \nlending spread applicable to ADB's sovereign OCR loans, but the cost base rate will be based \non ADB's cost of funding and/or hedging the fixed-rate loan, as well as other risk components \nrelated  to  fixed-interest  loans.  This  will  entail  certain  waivers  from  ADB\u2019s  lending  policy, 9 \nincluding  (i)  the  interest  rate  being  fixed  at  loan  signing;  (ii)  rebate  and  surcharge  on  funding \ncost margin not being applied; and (iii) a cancellation fee being charged to pass on any costs \nincurred as a result of rate-fixing. Before loan signing, the government will provide ADB with (a) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow on these terms and conditions, and (b) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nthe \n\nresponsible \n\nimplementing  agency  and  coordinate  all \n\nThe MRT will be the executing agency. Its Construction and Civil Structures Department, \n16. \nwhich  has  the  mandate  for  all  construction  and  procurement  works  of  the  MRT,  will  be  the \nimplementation  agency.  The  MRT\u2019s  Power  Supply  and  Communication  Department,  which  is \nfor  operation  and  maintenance  of  power  supply,  signaling  and \nmainly \nthe  MRT \ntelecommunication,  will  support \ndepartments.  An  international  firm  will  be  engaged  as  project  management  consultants.  The \nproject management consultants will manage contracts with the Construction and Civil Structures \nDepartment and the Power Supply and Communication Department, as well as provide hands-on \ntraining in project management and oversight, financial management, operation and maintenance, \nasset management, and reporting. As this will be ADB\u2019s first project in Turkmenistan, the MRT\u2019s \nrelated departments will improve their capacity to implement externally funded projects. Thus, the \nproject will not include a conventional project management unit. Contracts will include premiums \nas  incentive  and  penalties  to  encourage  timely  completion  within  the  contract  period.  The \nimplementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration manual.10 \n\nThe  procurement  of  goods  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \n17. \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). International competitive bidding (ICB) will be \nused for goods contracts estimated to cost $1 million and above. National competitive bidding is \nnot applicable. Three contract packages are proposed: package 1 (design, supply, and installation \nof power supply, signaling, and telecom) using the one stage\u2013two envelope modality; package 2 \n(supply  of  track  machinery  and  supply  and  installation  of  safety  equipment);  and  package  3 \n(consulting services).  \n\n18. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). A total of 176 person-months of consulting services (64 \ninternational, 112 national) grouped into one package will be funded under the project to support \nthe MRT in (i) design review and implementation supervision; (ii) train operations management, \n(iii)  environmental  monitoring,  (iv)  procurement  management,  and  (v) project  implementation \nand  institutional  capacity  improvement.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  using  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection, with the standard ratio of 80:20.  \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006.

The  design \nfeatures  and \nconstruction  standards  of  the  completed  311  km  of  railway  and  its  complementarities  with  the \nexisting system were also reviewed.  \n\n21. \nThe existing railway system has adequate capacity in terms of locomotive power, wagon \navailability  for  the  expected  commodities,  line  capacity,  and  a  well-trained  and  experienced \nworkforce.  The  selection  of  the  main  alignment  of  the  railway  was  based  on  the  shortest \ndistance from the junction to the existing railway, and the efficiency of service for villages within \nthe  project  area  was  emphasized.  Impacts  on  land  acquisition,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \narable agricultural lands were avoided. The MRT selected a track alignment that minimizes the \neffects  of  the  barchans,  which  make  construction  and  track  maintenance  difficult.  The  sand \nremoval machines included in the project will ensure efficient removal of sand.  \n\n22. \nThe  detailed  design  of  the  newly  laid  railway  line  and  its  safety  aspects  during \nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance  were  reviewed.  The  railway  line  was  built  following \ninternational  standards  with  state-of-the  art  components  for  track  construction.  Sub-grade  and \nalignment  were  well  designed  and  properly  constructed.  Materials,  such  as  sleepers  and  rail, \nare  state-of-the-art  for  a  rail  line  that  will  carry  about  3  million\u201315  million  tons  annually. \nAccording to the Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer,11 this type of rail has an economic \nlife corresponding to at least 800 million gross tons. Therefore, it will not need to be replaced for \nat least 50 years. The concrete sleepers will have a similar life. The signaling system and safety \nenhancement  devices  included  in  the  project  will  promote  safe  train  operations  after \ncommissioning.  The  proposed  electronic  interlocking  at  stations  and  automatic  signaling  will \nlong  distance \nprovide  positive \n\ntrain  separation.  The  mobile \n\ntrain  radio  system  and \n\n                                                 \n11 Paris-based International railway union that sets and publishes railway material and design standards. \n\n\ftelecommunications  network  will  facilitate  efficient  railway  operations.  Other  state-of-the-art \ntechnologies  to  be  applied  under  the  project  include  (i)  electronic  interlocking,  cab  signaling, \nlight-emitting diode-lit color light automatic signals directly controlled by audio frequency; and (ii) \na long distance network based on optical fiber cables with synchronous transport modules 1 and \n16 equipment. Since electric power is only available at the existing Bereket station, the power \nsupply  network  included  in  the  project  will  provide  reliable  power  for  efficient  train  operations. \nSafety  enhancement  devices,  including  defective  bearing  detectors  and  dragging and  derailed \nequipment detectors, are also included in the project to enhance operational safety. Collectively, \nthe  items  included  in  project  will  support  safer  and  more  efficient  train  operations,  and \nsignificantly enhance the long-term capacity of the railway. \n\n23. \nThe  MRT's  staffing  capacity  for  railway  operation,  including  experience  in  sand \noperations  and  operating  rolling  stock  and  locomotives  to  handle  the  forecast  tonnage,  is \nadequate. The locomotive fleet has sufficient capacity to handle the incremental volume that is \nexpected  on  the  new  line,  but  improvements  in  locomotive  productivity  are  required.  The \ninstitutional capacity improvement  under the  project will enhance the MRT\u2019s management and \nimplementation  capacity.  Traffic  forecasts  include  newly  generated,  road-diverted,  and  rail-\ndiverted  freight  and  passenger  traffic.  Based  on  these  forecasts,  train  operations  within  the \nestablished tonnage parameters are predicted. These volumes fit well within the design capacity \nof the new line, increasing to 22 trains per day by 2020. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic \n\n24. \nThe economic evaluation covered all the project components, including track machinery \nand  fixtures,  signaling,  power  supply,  telecommunications,  design  review  and  implementation \nsupervision, and capacity improvement.  In addition, the associated completed works on the 311 \nkm of the north\u2013south railway, including track, stations and rolling stock, have been factored into \nthe economic evaluation. Annual operating costs have also been included in the analysis. \n\nEconomic benefits include (i) user cost savings for freight and passenger traffic; (ii) time \n25. \nsavings  for  diverted  passenger  and  freight  traffic  from  buses,  trucks,  and  other  rail  lines; \n(iii) benefits  attributable  to  generated  traffic;  (iv)  more  tourism;  (v)  shipper  savings  because  of \nincreased  railway  competition;  (vi)  avoided  road  accidents;  (vii)  less  pollution;  (viii) energy \nsavings; and (ix) higher national productivity. \n\n26. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  project  is  16.65%.  Benefits  from  freight \ntraffic, including benefits attributable to generated traffic, are the major economic benefits, with \npassenger  benefits  contributing  minimally,  and  other  benefits  making  up  the  balance.  The \nsensitivity analysis tested 10 scenarios to assess the robustness of the results of the economic \nanalysis.  The  total  cost  would  have  to  be  more  than  28.0%  higher  than  estimated  for  the \neconomic internal rate of return to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. A 1-year delay in completion \nwould  reduce  the  net  present  value  by  52%.  Combinations  of  adverse effects on  benefits and \ncosts were also tested. The results showed that the project would maintain its economic viability \nunder plausible scenarios of variability in key parameters. \n\nC. \n\nFinancial \n\n27. \nFinancial  sustainability  for  the  project  was  assessed.  The  government  has  very  low \nlevels of debt, and its revenues and surpluses are increasing as more of the country\u2019s gas fields \nare developed. The country has the world\u2019s fourth-largest gas fields, which will be brought into \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\fproduction  in  the  near  future.12 The  railway  is  sufficiently  solvent  to  increase  the  length  of  its \nnetwork,  purchase  additional  new  rolling  stock,  and  upgrade  its  technologies.  Importantly,  the \nrailway  is  strongly  committed  to  maintenance,  and  maintenance  schedules  are  fully  followed. \nCosts have been reduced and train schedules are met with only a few service interruptions.  \n\n28. \nThe  project  railway  will  be  largely  for  freight  and  will  attract  considerable  transit  traffic.  \nFreight  tariffs  are  adequate  to  meet  all  project  costs.  Passenger  tariffs  are  low  and  cross- \nsubsidized  by  freight  revenues,  which  is  common  in  many  countries.  The  project  will  be \nsustainable and provide considerable benefits to the country and to the areas along the railway.  \n \nD. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nA  governance  assessment  was  undertaken  as  part  of  the  due  diligence  process.  This \nfocused  on  the  legal  framework,  regulation,  strength  of  enforcement  regimes,  capacity  of  the \nMRT, human resources, and risk of corruption. \n\n30. \nOn  25  September  2008,  Turkmenistan  adopted  a  new  Constitution,  which  gives  the \nParliament  full  legislative  authority.  The  Parliament  has  the  power  to  (i)  pass  laws;  (ii)  amend \nthe Constitution; (iii) approve the state budget; (iv) set dates for the elections of the President, \nmembers  of  the  legislature,  and  local  governing  bodies;  and  (v)  ratify  or  reject  international \ntreaties.  Parliament  also  renders  binding \nthe \nconstitutionality of legal acts issued by the executive branch of government.  \n\nlaws  and  determines \n\ninterpretations  of \n\n31. \nThe  Law  of  Turkmenistan  on  Railway  Transport  (enacted  on  15  September  1998) \ndesignates the MRT to undertake all investments in infrastructure, rolling stock, and other fixed \nassets; and to operate freight and passenger trains on its tracks. MRT investments and tariffs \nare  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  cabinet  of  ministers.  The  MRT  does  not  receive  a  special \nsubsidy  from  the  government  and  is  expected  to  cover  its  operating  costs  through  freight  and \npassenger revenues. A special budgetary appropriation is made to finance large infrastructure \ninvestments that aim to improve network capacity and the efficiency of operations.  \n\n32. \nThe  country  has  established  adequate  budgetary  controls  and  oversight  to  ensure \nefficiency  and  accountability.  The  legal  frameworks  for  managing  public  finances  have  been \ntightened.  In  line  with  this,  the  MRT  has  an  accounting  system  that  allows  for  the  proper \nrecording  of  financial  transactions,  including  the  allocation  of  expenditures  to  the  respective \ncomponents  of  development  projects.  The  accounting  system  is  available  and  interconnected \nwith  the  State  Bank  for  Foreign  Economic  Affairs.  Controls  are  in  place  concerning  the \npreparation and approval of transactions, ensuring that all transactions are correctly made. The \nMRT has an internal audit department with qualified and experienced staff. The MRT financial \nstatements are audited regularly by an independent auditor, the Supreme Chamber of Control.13 \n\n33. \nA  major  issue  is  the  public  procurement  process  and  price  verification  for  all  foreign-\nfunded contracts and contract variations. All major contracts under the proposed project will be \nsubjected  to  ICB  and  direct  payment  procedures.  This  increases  oversight  and  helps  mitigate \ncorruption.  The  verification  contributes  to  good  governance,  but  sometimes  creates  project \nimplementation  delays.  ADB  and  the  government  have  agreed  on  actions  to  reduce  these \ndelays  by  sharing  databases  and  other  information  on  cost  estimates  and  sources.  The  MRT \n\n                                                 \n12 R. Paxton. 2010. Turkmen Gas Fields Need Deals, Oil Majors Keen. Reuters. 18 November. \n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE6AH0OS20101118. \n\n13 On  14  July  2007,  media  reported  that  the  Supreme  Chamber  of  Control  of  Turkmenistan  was  established  for \n\u201cenforcing  control  of  execution  of  legal  acts  of  Turkmenistan  on  the  issues  of  financial-economic  activity,  safety, \nlegality \nresources.\u201d \nwww.turkmenistan.ru/en/node/5906.  \n\nallocation \n\nfinancial \n\nproperty \n\nefficient \n\nstate \n\nand \n\nand \n\nand \n\nuse \n\nof \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fwill  need  to  improve  further  its  systems  and  transparency  by  including  on  its  webpage \ninformation on its performance, the status of each contract under the project, the list of business \nopportunities, and a summary of the bidding process and its guidelines. This would be a major \npublic  disclosure  breakthrough.  Institutional  capacity  improvements  included  in  the  project  will \nmainly  focus  on  MRT  staff  training in  procurement,  project administration,  and  sound  financial \nmanagement. Project management support through international and national consultants, and \ngreater  institutional  capacity,  will  result  in  project  oversight,  ensuring  good  quality  in \nimplementation, timely project completion, and compliance with ADB guidelines and policies.  \n\n34. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MRT. The project will have a strong internal and external auditing \npresence. The specific policy requirements and  supplementary measures are described in the \nproject administration manual (footnote 10). \n \nE. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n35. \nThe project is not a targeted intervention. It does not address poverty reduction through \nstandard direct actions at the level of households, or involve specific services that address the \ngeographical determinants of poverty. The project will not exacerbate gender inequities.   \n\n36. \nAbout 3,200 people live in nine villages 3\u201310 km from the railway line. They are involved \nmainly  in  sheep  herding.  The  project  impact  area  is  arid  with  only  limited  water  sources. \nSummers and winters have extreme temperatures.   \n\n37. \nIn  addition  to  the  train  crews,  the  railway  will  employ  about  175\u2013200  people  at  12 \nstations on the line north of Bereket. About 100 of these positions will be filled by people from \nthe  local  areas.  Small  shops  and  restaurants  will  also  be  set  up  at  the  new  passenger  and \nfreight stations at nine locations.  \n\n38.  While economic activity is currently limited in the project impact area, it contains mineral \nresources  that  could  not  be  exploited  before  because  of  the  lack  of  low-cost  transport.  The \nrailway will enable the exploitation of these deposits, including coal, gold, kaolin, and platinum. \nTherefore,  the  project  will  generate  additional  jobs  and  improve  mobility  and  access  to  health \nand other services for people living in the project impact area.   \n\nF. \n\nSafeguards \n\n39. \nThe project will not have any major environmental impacts. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  and  is  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite.  The  investments  will  not  result  in  regional  or  international  environmental  impacts. \nInstallation of signaling and telecommunication under the project, and the completed 311 km of \nrailway  track  under  government  financing,  does  not  involve  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement,  or  affect  ethnic  minority  groups.  The  project\u2019s  rights-of-way  were  established \nduring the Soviet era, and the land use of the area has not changed since then. The project is \nclassified  as  category  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  people.  A  social \nsafeguard diligence report was prepared during project preparation.14 \n\nG. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n40. \n\nTable  4  summarizes  the  major  risks  and  mitigating  measures,  focusing  mainly  on  the \n\n                                                 \n14 Due  Diligence  Report  on  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\ncapacity of the MRT. ADB does not have operational experience in Turkmenistan, and the MRT \nhas not administered projects funded by multilateral financing institutions. To mitigate this risk, \nthe  MRT  received  training  under  ADB-financed  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  in \npreparing ICB contract documents of goods in advance. To further support timely bid evaluation \nand  contract  awards  for  goods  and  consultant  selection,  an  international  and  a  national \nprocurement specialist will assist and train the MRT during the initial implementation period until \nall contracts are awarded. During implementation, project management consultants will continue \nto improve the MRT\u2019s capacity.     \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nProcurement \ndelays \n\nProject \nimplementation \ndelays \n\nMitigating Measures \nInternational and national individual procurement specialists deputed under the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance will continue to help and train the executing agency in the bidding and \nconsultant selection process until all the contracts are awarded and consultants selected. \nProject implementation support and capacity improvement, provided under the project through \nproject management consultants, will help ensure timely procurement and implementation, in \naddition to transparency.  \n\nProject implementation support and capacity improvement provided as a project component \nthrough project management consultants \n\nMandatory completion of all ongoing civil works by December 2011 on sections of the north\u2013south \nrailway  line  funded  by  the  government  and  Islamic  Development  Bank  as  per  the  Turkmenistan \npresidential  decree  for  the  north\u2013south  railway  line,  and  according  to  the  multilateral  agreement \nwith its neighboring countries, including Kazakhstan for the railway section in Kazakhstan. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, MRT = Ministry of Railway Transport. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n41. \nThe  government  and  the  MRT  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government and the MRT have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n42. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$125,000,000 to Turkmenistan for the North\u2013South Railway Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and \n \n\nwith interest and such other terms and conditions to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending facility, or  \n\nwith fixed interest and such other terms and conditions, including certain waivers \nfrom ADB\u2019s lending policy, as described in paragraph 15 of this report. \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n17 February 2011 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \nBy 2015 \nTurkmenistan's total \nexternal trade increased to \n$17.9 billion (2008 \nbaseline: $11.9 billion) \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms  \n \nNational Statistics \nCommittee of \nTurkmenistan  \n \n\n \nStatistical Review of \nTurkmenistan (annual \npublication by National \nStatistics Committee of \nTurkmenistan)  \n \nTraffic surveys by railway \nagency (upon project \ncompletion) \n \nMRT annual sector \nperformance reports \n \n\n \n \nMRT annual sector \nperformance reports \n \nConsultants\u2019 progress \nreports \n \nMRT approved annual \nbudget document  \n \nMRT training program \ndocumentation \n \n \n\nBy 2015 \nTotal national transit \ntonnage increased to \n6 million tons (2008 \nbaseline: 3 million tons) \n \nAbout 1.6 million tons of \nminerals transported on the \nproject railway in 2015 \n \nPerformance tracking \nsystem developed  for \nperiodic inspection, \nsupervision, and testing \n \nBy 2020  \nCO2 emissions reduced  to \n26,800 tons (2008 \nbaseline: estimated at \n37,000 tons) \n\n \n  \nBy June 2012  \nTwo 10.0 kilovolt overhead \npower lines, distribution \nsystem, substations, and \nSCADA system designed, \ninstalled, and \ncommissioned along 311 \nkm of the rail line   \n \nBy September 2012  \nSignaling equipment \nprocured and installed \n \nBy August 2012  \nMobile train radio \ncommunication and long \ndistance \ntelecommunication network  \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11\n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \nAssumptions \nGovernment sustains \npolicies conducive to \neconomic growth and \nremains committed to \nregional cooperation \nand integration \n \nAssumptions \nTimely institutional \nstrengthening of \nrailway agency to run \nsustainable railway \noperation \n \nTrade between \nKazakhstan, the \nRussian Federation, \nand the Persian Gulf \ncontinues to grow \n \nRisks \nNorth\u2013south corridor \nmay not be completed \nin time due to any \nunforeseen reason by \nall parties including \nthe ongoing work by \nKazakhstan, and on \nIDB- and government-\nfunded sections \n \nAssumptions \n \nTimely provision of \ncounterpart resources \nand support for the \ninvestment project \n \nProvision of \nprocurement \narrangements at the \ninitial project stage \nfacilitates  timely \nprocurement of goods \nand services and \ndevelops the MRT\u2019s \nprocurement capacity \n \nContractors procured \nthrough ICB perform \nin accordance with the \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nIncreased trade \nbetween \nTurkmenistan and \nother countries in the \nregion  \n\nOutcome \nAn efficient, safe, and \nreliable railway \ntransport network \ndeveloped and \noperated in \nTurkmenistan with \nbetter connectivity \nwith neighboring \ncountries \n\nOutputs \n \n1.
