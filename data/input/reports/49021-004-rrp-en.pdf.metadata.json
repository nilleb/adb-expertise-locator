It aims to revitalize the economy and improve urban \nlivability through (i) a financial intermediation component (FIC), linked to a business development \nservices (BDS) subcomponent, to strengthen the capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs)  and  enable  private  sector  development;  and  (ii)  investment  project  components  that \nenhance regional public goods by cleaning up the environment from coal-mining impacts, reduce \npollution, and improve urban infrastructure and public services for people in the coal-dependent \ncities of Hegang, Jixi, Qitaihe, and Shuangyashan (project cities) in eastern Heilongjiang Province \nin  northeastern  PRC. 1 The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) provided  technical  assistance  to \nprepare the project.2 The government requested additional financing to help fund outputs 3, 4, \nand 5 (paras. 14\u201316), to cover the gap left when originally planned cofinancing did not materialize. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nThe project cities were important bases for coal mining and electricity production in the \nPRC, particularly between 1949 and 2013.3 Their fundamental reliance on coal mining and related \nindustries made their economies vulnerable, especially when coal prices dropped steeply in 2013. \nChanging  global  and  domestic  energy  and  climate  change  policies  also  contributed  to  rapid \neconomic  decline,  wage  reductions,  unemployment,  urban  poverty,  and  population  loss  in  the \nproject cities.4 In 2014, the project cities had an average per capita gross domestic product of \nCNY26,600, 33% lower than the average rate in Heilongjiang Province, which in turn was about \n16% below the national average.  \n \n\n \n\nThe project cities suffer from environmental degradation (pollution of soil, water, and air) \ncaused by more than 60 years of coal mining. This, along with inadequate urban infrastructure \nand  services\u2014e.g.,  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  drainage,  and  district  heating \nsystems\u2014makes  for  poor  livability.  Project  cities  lack  adequate  road  maintenance,  public \ntransport, bus lanes, bus stops, and sidewalks; and urgently need road rehabilitation. Some rivers, \nespecially in Hegang and Jixi, flood during heavy storms, have narrow channels, and are polluted \nby sediments and untreated discharge of domestic and industrial wastewater.  \n \n\n \n\nValue added by ADB assistance. ADB helped identify and comprehensively tackle key \neconomic  development  challenges  through  non-coal  diversification,  sustainable  and  inclusive \nprivate  sector  development,  and  job  creation.  It  enabled  a  holistic  investment  project  that  will \ngenerate cross-sector synergies. It prepared a diversification road map and an SME development \nand  financing  program  to  leverage  ADB  funds  and  strengthen  the  local  finance  sector.  It \ncontributes  to  regional  public  goods  by  preparing  initial  mining  remediation  strategies  and \n\n                                                \n1  ADB has engaged in policy dialogue and provided project support for urban environmental improvement and water \n\npollution prevention for more than 20 years in Heilongjiang Province. \n\n2  ADB.  2015.

ADB assessed the climate risk and \nproposed adaptation measures that are included in the overall project.  \n \n\n \n\nStrategic fit. The project builds on more than 20 years of partnership between ADB and \nHeilongjiang Province, including several strategic priority projects such as reducing pollution and \nflood  risk  in  the  Songhua  River  Basin  with  both  public  and  private  sector  support.5 It  supports \ngovernment  strategies  to  revitalize  the  PRC\u2019s  challenged  northeastern  region.  Through  its \nstrategic  and  holistic  approach,  the  project  will  support  the  (i)  13th  five-year  plans  of  the \ngovernments of the PRC, Heilongjiang Province, and project cities to transform the economy and \nimprove  financing  of  new  industries  and  SMEs;6 (ii)  Transformation  Development  Planning  of \nCoal Cities in Heilongjiang Province, 2014\u20132020 by assisting SMEs in non-coal pillar industries \nsuch as green food processing, graphite high-tech materials and products, machinery, tourism, \ntrade,  and  logistics;  and  (iii)  the  National  New-Type  Urbanization  Plan,  2014\u20132020  by \nstrengthening small and medium-sized cities.7 The project aligns with ADB policies, notably the \n(i) Strategy 2030 and its operational priority of livable cities by (a) providing integrated solutions \nto four cities to show their transformation from coal-based to diverse, green, and livable cities;   \n(b)  enhancing  resilience  to  climate  change  shocks  and  stresses,  e.g.,  reducing  flood  risk  and \nincreasing  water  safety;  (c)  strengthening  institutions  by  building  institutional  knowledge  and \ncapacity;  and  (d)  sharing  best  practices  and  innovation  experiences  both  for  replication  in  the \nPRC and for cooperation among developing member countries;8 (ii) country partnership strategy, \n2016\u20132020  for  the  PRC  by  supporting  socially  inclusive,  environmentally  sustainable,  and \neconomically  competitive  urban  development; 9  and  (iii)  various  operational  plans  and \nenvironment operational directions.10 \n \n\n4 September 2018. It is performing well and meets all criteria to be eligible for additional financing \nbecause (i) it is rated on track under the project performance system; (ii) each safeguard covenant \nis being complied with; (iii) the delivery of expected outputs is rated successful given that the initial \nactions\u2014such  as  advanced  contracting  and  retroactive  financing, 11 disbursement  of  an  initial \nadvance  of  $20  million  to  the  advance  account,  subsequent  liquidation  and  replenishment  of \n$9.63 million, and the preparation of the detailed engineering design and bidding documents\u2014\nare progressing as planned; and (iv) the management of risks is rated successful since all the \nrisks in the Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan were managed successfully. By June \n2019, with 27.30% of the project time elapsed, physical progress stood at about 19.00%, and loan \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

Eight \ncontracts totaling $22.88 million have been awarded. \n  \n\n \n\nThe government requested ADB to provide additional financing to cover the financing gap \nthat emerged when originally planned cofinancing by the European Investment Bank (EIB) did \nnot materialize despite EIB\u2019s earlier indication of interest. The proposed additional financing was \nincluded as a 2019 firm project for $150 million (\u20ac133.929 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources in the country operations business plan for the PRC, 2019\u20132021 to help finance \noutputs 3, 4, and 5. The project remains consistent with the country partnership strategy (footnote \n9), and additional financing is essential to fully deliver the outputs and outcome. \n \nB. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) economy revitalized and diversified, \nand  non-coal  industries  in  the  cities  of  Hegang,  Jixi,  Qitaihe,  and  Shuangyashan  developed \n(footnote  6);  and  (ii)  living  environment,  safety,  and  public  health  in  the  cities  of  Hegang,  Jixi, \nQitaihe, and Shuangyashan improved (footnote 7). The project will have the following outcome: \nnon-coal  economic  activities  and  urban  livability  in  project  cities  increased. 12 The  impact  and \noutcome of the overall project will remain unchanged from the current project. \n \n\n \n\nThe comprehensive revitalization approach of the overall project is expected to help stop \nthe  out-migration  of  young  and  qualified  workers,  draw  new  individuals  and  companies  to  the \nnewly  attractive  project  cities,  and  retain  existing  residents.  The  project  will  directly  benefit         \n2.73  million  urban  residents  through  (i) stronger  SME  competitiveness  and  job  creation  in \nimproved non-coal industrial parks; (ii) a positive environment and public image through mining \nremediation; (iii) better water supply, sewers, district heating, flood protection, roads, road safety, \nand  public  transport;  (iv)  greater  environmental  and  traffic  safety  awareness  through  public \neducation  programs;  and  (v)  closer  cooperation  between  project  cities  in  tourism  promotion, \nlogistics and trade, supply chain integration, and SME support using smart city applications. \n \nC. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\nThe overall project outputs will remain unchanged from the current project. Details are in \nthe design and monitoring framework, in the project administration manuals (PAMs), and in the \nprocurement plan.13 \n \n\n \n\n Output  1:  Capacity  for  business  development  services  and  integrated  project \nplanning  and  management  developed.  The  project  will  support  project  management  and \ncapacity development to ensure successful diversification and project sustainability in the areas \nof (i) project planning, procurement, and financial management; (ii) BDS for SMEs and local SME \nbureaus;  (iii) human  resources  and  skills  development;  (iv) smart  city  cluster  cooperation;             \n(v)  planning  and  implementation  of  mining  remediation;  (vi) flood  risk  management,  climate \nresilience,  and  sponge  city  planning;  (vii) design,  construction,  and  operation  of  water, \nwastewater, and drainage systems; and (viii) sustainable urban public transport and road safety. \n \n\n \n\nOutput  2:  Sustainable  investment  in  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and \naccess  to  finance  in  project  cities  improved.  The  project  will  establish  an  SME  financing \n                                                \n12  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 Project  Administration  Manual:  Investment  Project  Components  (Section  A)  [PAM  (Section  A)],  and  Project \nAdministration Manual: Financial Intermediation Component and Business Development Services Subcomponent \n(Section B) [PAM (Section B)] (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fplatform, using the FIC, to mobilize domestic financing. The platform will offer (i) cofinancing loans \nfor SMEs by financial intermediaries in which the ADB loan component is subordinated, (ii) a first-\nloss cash collateral facility to mobilize commercial guarantees and ease access to commercial \nfinancing for investments and longer-term working capital, and (iii) entrusted loans for high-priority \nprojects for local governments. The FIC will be linked to the BDS subcomponent (output 1). \n \n\n \n\nOutput 3: Key infrastructure and facilities for small and medium-sized enterprises \nin  non-coal  industrial  parks  in  project  cities  constructed.  The  additional  financing  will \naugment  the  current  loan  to  help  build  and  make  operational  key  infrastructure  and  facilities, \nincluding  (i)  roads  with  advanced  safety  features  and  associated  utility  pipes;  (ii) industrial \nwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs); and (iii) facilities for SMEs, start-ups, and for training. \n \n\n \n\nOutput 4: Remediation and environmental cleanup from mining impacts in project \ncities improved. The additional financing will augment the current loan to help develop mining \nremediation  strategies,  prepare  investment  plans,  and  implement  pilot  projects  as  models  for \nreplication. In Hegang, remediation of an open-pit mine will involve grading, clay lining, topsoil \ncover, vegetation, environmental management, and monitoring. In Jixi, a former mining area and \nwaste-rock  dumpsite,  and  initiate  construction  and  operation  of  a  subsidence-monitoring \ncenter. In Qitaihe  and  Shuangyashan,  waste-rock  dumpsites  and  subsidence  areas  will  be \nremediated and reused as open spaces. \n \n\n \n\nOutput 5: Integrated urban infrastructure and services in project cities improved. \nThe  additional  financing  will  augment  the  current  loan  to  help  enhance  urban  livability  and \nattractiveness  through  improved,  spatially  integrated  infrastructure  and  services:  (i)  Hegang\u2014\nriver rehabilitation, drainage system, sustainable urban and public transport, urban greening, and \ndistrict heating; (ii) Jixi\u2014integrated improvements to the core area of Hengshan District and West \nJixi,  including  river  rehabilitation,  urban  roads,  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  and \ndrainage  system;  (iii)  Qitaihe\u2014water  supply,  wastewater,  and  public  transport  systems \nimprovements;  and  (iv)  Shuangyashan\u2014sustainable  urban  transport  through  key  road  links, \nwater supply, sewer, and drainage systems. \n \nD. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \n\nThe overall project is estimated to cost $1,011.0 million equivalent (Table 1). The amount \nwas reduced from $1,021.0 million after an update of foreign exchange rates and because the \ninterest cost will be lower if the total loan amount is lower. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure \ncategory and by financier are included in the PAM (Section A). The major expenditure items for \nthe  overall  project  are  civil  works,  procurement  and  installation  of  equipment,  FIC  costs,  and \nconsulting services.

The  Heilongjiang  Provincial \nGovernment (HPG) is the executing agency and continues to supervise, coordinate, and manage \nthe  project. The  Heilongjiang  Finance  Department  opened  an  advance  account for  the  current \nproject,  and  will  establish  and  maintain  a  second  account  in  the  form  of  a  subledger  for  the \nadditional financing. The government requested an initial advance of $20 million for the current \nproject in 2018 and will continue to manage the advance account\u2014and now also the subledger\u2014\nand to support financial management. The municipal governments of Hegang, Jixi, Qitaihe, and \nShuangyashan are the implementing agencies, and each established and operates (i) a project \nleading group headed by the mayor or vice mayor, (ii) a local project management office (PMO) \nunder the municipal development and reform commission, and (iii) project implementation units \n(PIUs) in the participating agencies to implement the subcomponents.  \n \n\n \n\nThe updated implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in \n\ndetail in the PAM (Section A).14 \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nMarch 2018 (current project) / March 2020 (additional financing)\u2013February 2023 \n28 February 2023 \n31 August 2023 \n \n\n                                                \n14 PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAspects \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation units \nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \n\n5 contracts \n47 contracts \n845 person-months \n148 person-months \n16 person-months \n\nHeilongjiang PLG  \nHPG, under HDRC\u2019s leadership and with HAD, HFD, and HIITC participation \nHMG, JMG, QMG, and SMG, each with a local PLG and PMO \nProject cities\u2019 concerned departments \nInternational competitive bidding \nNational competitive bidding \nQCBS (2 contracts) \nCQS (5 contracts) \nICS (6 contracts) \nA goods contract for Hegang\u2019s intelligent transport system ($1.41 million) and a \ncivil works contract for Shuangyashan\u2019s Xinxing Avenue link ($21.40 million) were \nimplemented  as  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  the  current \nproject.

Design options were compared, and the best possible technologies \nwith  the  least  environmental,  social,  and  cost  impacts  were  selected.  The  proposed  capacity \ndevelopment aims at the successful implementation and sustainable operation of the project.  \n \nB. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\nfor  all \n\ninvestment \n\nEconomic  analysis.  The  original  economic  analysis \n\nloan \nsubcomponents, prepared following ADB guidelines, was updated.15 The economic viability of the \noverall project was reconfirmed under various sensitivity scenarios. Benefits considered include \n(i) improved water supply, wastewater management, and sanitation; (ii) improved flood protection \nand  avoided  damage;  (iii)  increased  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time;  and \n(iv) improved  public  health  with  less  productivity  losses  and  reduced  medical  costs.  Additional \nbenefits include more SME employment, reduced carbon emission through mining remediation, \nincreased  carbon  sequestration  from  afforestation,  and  less  exposure  to  pathogens.  The \neconomic internal rate of return was recalculated at 15.4% (above the 9.0% economic opportunity \ncost of capital); it drops to 14.3% if the capital cost increases by 10.0%, to 15.3% if the operating \ncost increases by 10.0%, to 14.0% under a 10.0% benefit decrease, to 12.8% when combining \nthese assumptions, and to 15.2% if benefits are achieved with a 1-year delay. \n                                                \n15 ADB.  2017.  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  Manila;  ADB.  1998.  Guidelines  for  the  Economic \n\nAnalysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n Financial analysis. The original financial analysis carried out for all revenue-generating \nsubcomponents  was  updated  to  reflect  the  change  of  financier  and  loan  terms,  a  lower  loan \namount  and  lower  total  interest  and  financing  charges,  and  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuation. \nMost  assumptions  and  costs  are  unchanged,  and  the  project  remains  financially  feasible.  The \nfinancial  internal  rate  of return  was recalculated  in  real  terms  at  2.96% for the  Hegang  Luobei \nWWTP,  3.43%  for  Hegang\u2019s  district  heating,  2.67%  for  the  Jixi  WWTP,  7.44%  for  Jixi\u2019s  water \nsupply, and 3.45% for Qitaihe\u2019s water supply. These rates exceed the weighted average costs of \ncapital of 0.86% for the Hegang WWTP, 2.01% for Hegang\u2019s district heating, 1.50% for the Jixi \nWWTP, 1.17% for Jixi\u2019s  water supply, and 2.16% for Qitaihe\u2019s water supply. The rates remain \nrobust  under  various  sensitivity  scenarios.  Fiscal  analysis  concluded  that  the  project  cities  are \nlikely  to  require  support  from  the  provincial  government  to  meet  shortfalls  in  counterpart \ncontributions, as well as for debt servicing and operation and maintenance of project facilities. \n \nC. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\nThe financial management risk for the overall project is still moderate because the PMOs \nand PIUs have limited experience with ADB-financed projects. This risk will be mitigated through \nproject  implementation  support  as  described  in  the  risk  management  plan  and  summarized  in \nTable 4. ADB and consultants provided training on safeguard implementation, procurement, and \ndisbursement. A financial management action plan is provided in the PAM (Section A). \n \n\n \n\n The procurement risk for the overall project remains moderate. Given its experience with \nADB projects, HPG will supervise the less experienced PIUs. The procurement arrangement is \ndeemed adequate, since a tendering agency and consultants under output 1 will provide support \nduring  implementation.  Procurement  under  the  additional  financing  will  also  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  as  per  the  current  loan \narrangement. \n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith HPG and the governments of Hegang, Jixi, Qitaihe, and Shuangyashan. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (Section A, footnote 14). \n \nD. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\nThe overall project will contribute to poverty reduction by supporting SME development \nand job creation, and by improving infrastructure and services, public health, sanitation, and living \nconditions. The project will create 1,853 skilled and 5,430 unskilled jobs during construction, and \n398 skilled and 138 unskilled jobs during operation. The PMOs will prioritize vulnerable groups, \nsuch as women and the poor, for employment and training. A social and gender action plan was \nprepared to ensure that positive benefits of the project accrue to beneficiaries. \n \n\n \n\n Gender  benefits.  The  overall  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming. \nWomen are affected by unemployment and poor urban services, and consider improvements in \nroad safety and public transport as important benefits to their well-being and quality of life. The \nsocial  and  gender  action  plan  will  improve  women\u2019s  employment  opportunities;  provide \nconsultation and participation opportunities; and proactively help prevent and respond to sexual \nharassment,  exploitation,  and  abuse  during  project  construction  and  operation.  It  will  raise \nawareness on environmental protection, road safety, and flood risk management through public \neducation. The FIC will provide loans to SMEs and start-up companies owned and/or managed \nby women. Social development and gender specialists will support project implementation. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n\n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009),  the  safeguard \ncategories  for  the  additional  financing  are  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples, since it requires no change in scope, while the safeguard categories for the \noverall project are as shown in paras. 30\u201333.16 Meaningful consultations on safeguards and on \nthe grievance redress mechanism have taken place and will continue. \n\n \n\nEnvironment (overall project: category A). An environmental impact assessment and \nenvironmental management plan\u2014prepared in compliance with the SPS, and disclosed on the \nADB  website  on  22  May  2017\u2014remain  valid  for  the  overall  project.17 Overall,  the  project  will \ngenerate  positive  impacts  on the  environment. Impacts  during  construction  include  earthworks \nand  movement,  treatment  of  soil,  polluted  river  sediment,  and  contaminated  soil  from  coal \nprocessing. Temporary impacts are on soil, surface water, air, and community safety, but will not \ncause loss of valuable ecology or physical cultural resources. Impacts during operation include \nan  increase  in  traffic  on  project  roads.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  includes \nmeasures  to  avoid  and/or  mitigate  impacts  during  construction  and  operation,  and  deal  with \npotential subsidence and leachate release at mining remediation sites. Site-specific EMPs were \nprepared based on the original EMP, and included in tender documents and contracts for ongoing \nand  planned  works.  Implementation  and  monitoring  are  in  compliance  with  the  SPS,  no \ngrievances  and  no  health  or  safety  incidents  were  identified  or  reported,  and  an  internal \nmonitoring report was disclosed on the ADB website. Safeguard training was provided to PMOs \nand their safeguard officers. \n \n\n \n\nInvoluntary resettlement (overall project: category A). Four resettlement plans were \nprepared in line with government laws and regulations on involuntary resettlement and the SPS. \nAbout 318 households (1,075 persons) will be permanently affected by impacts on collective farm \nland  (908.37  mu). 18 Impacts  on  households  and  annual  per  capita  income  are  found  to  be \nmarginal with loss at no more than 10%. About 296 households (700 persons) will be affected by \nhouse  demolition  and  relocation.  About  6  organizations  (1,530  workers)  and  10  stores \n(32 persons)  will  be  affected  by  impacts  on  structures.  HPG  engaged  a  start-up  consultant  to \nsupport  the  updating  and  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan,  and  is  engaging  an  external \nmonitoring  agency.  The  resettlement  plan  for  Shuangyashan  was  updated  specifically  for  the \nXinxing Avenue\u2013Railway Bridge component in January 2018, while the preparation of updated \nresettlement plans reflecting the detailed designs for the three other project cities is ongoing. Each \nPMO  has  designated  resettlement  staff  and  a  functional  grievance  redress  mechanism.  The \nproject implementation consultants initiated capacity building support to PMO staff on involuntary \nresettlement. An internal monitoring report was disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n\n \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (overall  project:  category  C).  Ethnic  minorities  account  for  less \nthan  4%  of  the  population  in  project  cities.  Due  diligence  confirmed  that  ethnic  minorities  will \nbenefit equally from the project, and no negative impact on indigenous peoples will arise from the \noverall project. \n \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories \n17 The  environmental  impact assessment incorporates  results  from  ADB and domestic  reports, including consultant \nreports, domestic feasibility studies, domestic environmental impact assessments, and climate risk and vulnerability \nassessments. The domestic safeguard documents were prepared in compliance with the PRC Law on Environmental \nImpact  Assessment  (2016),  the  Technical  Guidelines  for  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (HJ  2.1  -2016),  and \nother PRC regulations and guidelines. \n\n18 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement for land area (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \n\nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.19 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nHPG has relatively weak lead and \ncoordination role. \nPMO and PIU staff lack experience in \nimplementing ADB-financed projects, \nespecially regarding financial \nmanagement and procurement. \nPMOs  and  PIUs  suffer \nturnover of trained staff. \nPMOs and financial intermediaries \nlack experience in SME financing, \nESMS implementation, due diligence, \ninvestment appraisal, and ADB \nrequirements. \n\nfrequent \n\nMitigating Measures \nHDRC and HFD have committed to coordinate the project, along with four \nPMOs and with support from project implementation consultants. \nHPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  committed  to  fulfill  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements for procurement and financial management.
