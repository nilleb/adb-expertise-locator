The  area  has  been\ndevoid of significant externally financed development interventions\nfor  the  last  two  decades  due  to  a  20-year  insurgency,  which\nresulted in a general deterioration in the quality of life of the CHT\npopulation.  Basic socioeconomic indicators for the CHT reveal a\nregion  suffering  from  both  low  income  and  poverty,  especially\namong  the  rural  population.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to\ncontribute to a reduction in the incidence of absolute poverty in the\nCHT  and \nto\nunderpin  the  1997  peace  accord  in  which  local  communities  will\nbe empowered to decide on their own development priorities and\nactively participate in the subsequent investments. The Project will\nincrease employment and income generating opportunities for the\npopulation,  and  result  in  a  general  improvement  in  the  quality  of\nlife of the target population.\n\nto  provide  a  confidence-building  environment \n\nlandless.  The  Project  will  be  among \n\nRural poverty and lack of resources epitomize economic life in the\nCHT.  A  large  percentage  of  the  rural  community  consists  of\npeople  who  do  not  have  secure  rights  to  land  use,  clearly  a\ndisincentive to their investing in improved farming techniques and\nresource  management.  Additionally,  the  CHT\u2019s  infrastructure  is\npoor,  markets  are  underdeveloped,  and  the  institutional  support\nsystem  is  not  structured  to  address  the  needs  of  the  rural  poor\nand \nfirst  major\ndevelopment  initiatives  in  the  CHT  for  over  two  decades.  It  will\ncontribute to efforts to reduce the incidence of poverty among the\nrural population in the CHT through developing the basic physical\ninfrastructure  and  income-generating  opportunities  that  will  (i)\nsubstantially raise the standard of living of the landless and small\nmarginal  farmers,  and  (ii)  encourage  women  to  become  widely\ncommunity  decision-making  and  enterprise\nin \ninvolved \ndevelopment \nthe  rural  areas.  These  developments  will\nrecognize  the  unique  and  fragile  physical  environment  and  will\nincorporate  sound  sustainable  management  practices.  This\napproach  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  rural  development\nstrategy.  It  also  directly  supports  the  emerging  collaboration\nthe  Government  and  nongovernment  organizations\nbetween \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n\fObjectives\nand Scope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan \n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\niii\n\n(NGOs) in the provision of services, including microfinance, to the\nrural poor.\n\nincome-generating  opportunities \n\nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  reduce  the  incidence  of\nabsolute  poverty  in  the  CHT.  A  supporting  objective  will  be  to\nprovide  a  confidence-building environment to underpin the peace\naccord.  These  objectives  will  be  achieved  through  (i)  increasing\nthrough\nemployment  and \nimproved  rural  infrastructure;  (ii)  providing  access  to  training  and\nimproved  on-  and  off-farm  productive  technology;  (iii)  increasing\nthe  availability  of  microfinance  services  to  expand  productive\nactivities; and (iv) strengthening the capacity of local government\ninstitutions,  NGOs,  and  beneficiaries  to  plan  and  implement  local\ndevelopment  activities, \ninstitutional\ncapability  for  further  development  initiatives.  The  Project  scope\nincludes  (i)  upgrading  basic  rural  infrastructure  of  feeder  roads,\nrural  roads,  and  trails  (including  bridges  and  culverts);  (ii)  a\nthat  will  establish  a\ncommunity  development  component \ncommunity \nto  provide\nmatching  funds  for  small-scale  activities  at  the  village  level;  (iii)\nprovision  of  microfinance  to  enable  the  poor  to  improve  their\nincome \nof\nmicroenterprises; and (iv) project management support.\n\nthus  providing  a  sound \n\nin  each  subdistrict \n\ndevelopment \n\ninvestment \n\ngeneration \n\ncapacity \n\nthrough \n\nfund \n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $60.3 million, inclusive\nof  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties.

In\nresponse to a request from the Government of Bangladesh, ADB provided technical assistance\n(TA) to prepare a rural development project to contribute to reducing poverty in the Chittagong\nHill Tracts (CHT).1  Work under the TA began in September 1999.  A final report was submitted\nin April 2000.  ADB is streamlining its business processes, and this year is conducting a trial run\nby  processing  two  agriculture  loans  in  Bangladesh,  including  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Rural\nDevelopment Project. In keeping with the new business processes, no fact-finding mission was\nprogrammed for the proposed Project. A loan appraisal mission was conducted during 2-14 July\n2000.2  Extensive  consultation  between  the  consultants,  stakeholders  in  Bangladesh,  and  ADB\nhave taken place during the preparation of the Project to ensure that key issues will be properly\naddressed.  Identification  of  project  components  was  based  on  (i)  a  benchmark  and\nsocioeconomic survey carried out under the TA; (ii) a series of participatory rural appraisals; and\n(iii)  discussions  with  target  communities,  local  government  bodies,  and  other  stakeholders,\nincluding nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Subsequent ADB project processing missions\nvisited the proposed project area and undertook extensive consultations with local institutions,\nstakeholders, and beneficiaries. The project framework is presented in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nThe Chittagong Hill Tracts\n\nThe  CHT  is  a  unique  geographical  and  cultural  section  of  Bangladesh.3  It  covers\n3.\napproximately 13,300 square kilometers (km2), about 8 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s total area, and\nsupports  under  1  percent  of  the  national  population.  The  CHT  consists  of  three  districts\u2014\nBandarban,  Khagrachari,  and  Rangamati\u2014and  unlike  most  of  Bangladesh,  is  dominated  by\nsteep  hills  and  narrow  valleys,  many  of  which  are  remote  and  difficult  to  access.  The  region\u2019s\npopulation is made up of tribal peoples from 13 distinct groupings, and Bengalis\u2014most of who\nhave recently settled from the adjoining plains' districts. The population of the CHT is estimated\nto  be  about  1.2  million,  resulting  in  a  population  density  ranging  from  60  people  per  km2  in\nBandarban  District  to  147  per  km2  in  Khagrachari  District.  The  ratio  of  tribal  to  nontribal\npopulation  is  51:49,  with  the  Chakma,  Marma,  and  Tripura  accounting  for  approximately  88\n\n                                                \n1  TA 3213-BAN: Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural Development Project, for $500,000, approved on 30 June 1999.\n2 The mission consisted of Donneth Walton, Rural Development Specialist-Mission Leader; Dimyati Nangju, Lead\n\nAgronomist; Clare Wee, Senior Counsel; and John Graham, Staff Consultant-Economist.\n\n3  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world,  with  a  per  capita  income  of  approximately  $373\n(Tk19,023). The country is a predominantly low-lying, flat, alluvial flood plain with some hilly area in the northeast\npart of the country and in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The population was about 129 million in 1999, and although\npopulation growth has declined in recent years it is still high at 1.7 percent per annum. With about 885 persons\nper square kilometer, Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.\n\n\f2\n\npercent of the tribal population. Two major events in the last 40 years\u2014the construction of Lake\nKaptai and the insurgency war\u2014have had a profound impact on the lives of the CHT peoples.\n\n4.\nIn 1960 a hydroelectric dam was constructed at Kaptai village within Rangamati District,\ninundating about 20,000 hectares (ha) or 40 percent of the prime cultivable lands in the CHT. At\nthe time, the population of the CHT was estimated to be about 385,000 of which about 100,000\npeople, mainly from the Chakma, were displaced by the reservoir. Some attempts were made\nby  the  then  East  Pakistan  government  to  monetarily  compensate  the  affected  people,  but  the\ndestruction of such a large area of the best agricultural land and the forced resettlement of the\ndisplaced  people  was  to  have  a  far  reaching  impact  on  the  social  and  physical  environment.\nAlthough  some  of  the  displaced  farmers  migrated  to  India,  where  they  became  stateless\nrefugees, many were forced to take up shifting cultivation on the hill slopes, where soils are of\nlow  fertility.  No  accurate  economic  data  is  available  that  quantifies  the  loss  of  the  productive\nagricultural  area  but  it  was  significant  and  it  changed  the  CHT  from  being  self-sufficient  in\ncereals to a food deficit area, a situation that remains. The hydroelectric project is not likely to\nhave been built today, given the present Government\u2019s concern with social and environmental\nissues;  and  it  has  created  land  occupancy  and  ownership  problems  that  were  aggravated  by\nsubsequent settlement policies and law changes.\n\n5.\nThe  land  resources  of  the  CHT  and  their  capability  are  vastly  different  from  those  in\nother  areas  of  Bangladesh.  Because  the  CHT\u2019s  limitations  were  not  recognized,  the\nGovernment  sponsored  in-migration  of  people  from  some  of  the  heavily  populated  plains\ndistricts  during  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s.  About  250,000  in-migrants  (Bengalis  from\nneighboring  plains  districts)4  were  encouraged  to  settle  during  this  period  and  they  were\nprimarily located on land that was already occupied or claimed by the indigenous residents. As\npart of the settlement policy the migrants were provided with food rations, cattle, and land title\ndeeds.  The  pressures  of  these  land  policies  and  their  associated  ethnic  confrontations  further\naggravated an insurgency that spanned almost 20 years and finally ended with the signing of a\npeace  accord  in  December  1997.  The  economic  impact  of  the  insurgency  has  not  been\nquantified,  but  anecdotal  evidence  consistently  emphasizes  that  all  CHT  residents  were\neconomically  adversely  affected,  with  the  standard  of  living  of  the  population  steadily\ndeteriorating during the insurgency period.\n\n6.\nThe lives of the people in the CHT have been little changed for the past two decades.\nThe  insurgency  resulted  in  a  general  deterioration  of  the  rural  infrastructure  and  the  surveyed\ncommunities  indicated  that  no  new  rural  facilities,  except  some  military  access  roads,  were\ndeveloped. From the subdistrict level down, the communities estimate that less than 5 percent\nof their roads are paved and only a few are of durable construction. Roads and trails are in poor\ncondition  or  nonexistent;  many  trails  and  paths  in  the  remote  areas  are  unsuitable  for  carts.\nPeople  in  the  remote  areas  of  the  CHT  often  take  1-2  days  walking  to  and  returning  from  a\nmarket.\n\n2.\n\nRural Livelihood and Poverty in Bangladesh and the CHT\n\nBangladesh  is  primarily  a  rural  society  with  80  percent  of  the  population  living  in  rural\n7.\nareas.  Agriculture  dominates  the  rural  economy.  It  contributes  about  23  percent  of  gross\ndomestic  product  (GDP)5  and  provides  about  60  percent  of  all  employment.  Crop  production\n\n                                                \n4  Roy, Raja Debasish. 1997. The Population Transfer Program of the 1980s and the Land Rights of the Indigenous\n\nPeoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.\n5  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 1998.\n\n\f3\n\naccounts for about 52 percent of agricultural output, with livestock and fisheries accounting for\nabout 20 percent each and forestry about 8 percent. Land in the plains districts is planted mainly\nwith  rice  complemented  by  other  food  grains  (wheat  and  millet),  pulses,  oilseeds,  vegetables,\npotatoes,  sugarcane,  spices,  and  fruit.  Jute  is  a  principal  cash  crop.  About  70  percent  of  the\ntotal area is cultivable and land is predominantly fertile. Cropping intensity is about 170 percent\nand no unsettled land is left to exploit. Agricultural production since 1996 has grown at almost 4\npercent per annum, reflecting the continuing adoption of improved varieties, better fertilizer use,\nand  the  further  development  of  minor  irrigation  practices.  Forests  and  fisheries  are  all\nintensively exploited. Other rural economic activities include agro-processing, small and cottage\nindustries, construction, and service enterprises.\n\n8.\nPoverty  is  widespread  in  the  country,  especially  in  the  rural  areas  (Appendix  2).\nAlthough  in  recent  years  poverty  throughout  Bangladesh  has  declined  in  both  rural  and  urban\nareas,  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  still  higher  in  rural  areas  than  in  urban  areas.  About  45\npercent  of  the  rural  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line6  and  about  half  of  the  poor  are\nconsidered  to  be  the  hard-core  poor.  Rural  poverty  is  characterized  by  extreme  landlessness,\nover  dependence  on  subsistence  agriculture,  underemployment  due  to  underdevelopment  of\nthe rural nonfarm sector, low savings, and poor access to credit and savings facilities. Women\nand  ethnic  minorities,  in  particular,  are  among  the  most  disadvantaged  groups  in  the  country,\nand are especially so in the rural areas. Reducing their poverty remains a massive challenge for\nthe country.\n\n9.\nA  review  of  basic  socioeconomic  indicators  for  the  CHT  reveals  a  region  that  suffers\nfrom both income and human poverty, especially among the rural population. On average, per\ncapita income is about 40 percent lower than the national average. The rural population has a\nliteracy rate lower than the national average and less access to education.  This is a result of\nthe limited income of the parents, poor access to schools, nonavailability of teachers, and the\nextensive involvement of children in household and income generating activities. Water supplies\nare of variable quality, is generally scarce, and people lack knowledge about what is safe water.\nContaminated  water  is  a  major  threat  to  health.  Distances  from  water  supplies  are  commonly\nover 0.5 kilometer (km). Sanitation systems are poor and over 80 percent of the households use\nopen  latrines  or  open  spaces.  The  availability  of  health  services  is  variable.  Generally,\ngovernment  hospitals  and  clinics  are  close  to  subdistrict  headquarters,  but  65  percent  of  the\nhouseholds  are  further  than  5  km  from  these  facilities.  Traditional  doctors  and  traditional\ntreatment  of  diseases  are  common  in  the  remote  areas.  Communication  and  transport  are\ngenerally reported as being difficult. Almost 90 percent of households have very difficult or no\naccess  to  vehicle  transport.  Family  income  and  expenditure  was  similar  in  all  ethnic  groups.\nApproximately  80  percent  of  surveyed  households  earn  less  than  Tk25,000  (about  $500)  per\nannum (an income equivalent to the Government\u2019s food poverty line). The main occupation of\nthe CHT\u2019s rural population is agriculture (including horticulture and livestock) on flat and mildly\nsloping land, and shifting cultivation on hilly land.  Additional sources of rural livelihood include\nagricultural labor, service, trade, and general business. Over 60 percent of the rural households\nare involved in agriculture and agricultural labor, and only a small number of households have a\nsecondary  income.  About  40  percent  of  all  families  do  not  own  their  homestead  land  and  of\nthose who do own land, only 35 percent owned cultivatable cereal land.\n\n                                                \n6  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2000.

The  study  indicated  that  the  population  experiences  moderate  to\nsevere  food  shortages  on  a  seasonal  basis,  with  nearly  65  percent  of  households  having\nsufficient quantities of food from their own production for less than six months per year. Among\nthe  three  CHT  districts,  Bandarban  appears  to  be  the  most  severely  food  insecure,  with  75\npercent of households having food security for six months or less; the corresponding numbers\nfor  the  other  two  districts  are  61  percent  of  households  in  Rangamati  and  59  percent\nhouseholds  in  Khagrachari.  Food  shortages  are  often  seasonal  and  reflect  a  dependence  on\nagricultural cycles.\n\n11.\nThe reasons for this extreme poverty are several. The CHT\u2019s lands are visually attractive\nbut  they  are  not  economically  productive.  While  about  70  percent  of  the  nation\u2019s  soils  are\ncultivatable and have few production limitations, only 6 percent of CHT land is cultivatable and\nits  generally  poor  soils  and  steep  contours  severely  limit  production  enterprise  options.  The\ncreation  of  Lake  Kaptai  in  1960  took  about  20,000  ha  of  the  area\u2019s  best  agricultural  land  and\npermanently  left  the  CHT  as  a  cereal  deficit  area  (para.  4).  In-migration  of  people  (para.  5)\nexacerbated  the  pressures  on  the  remaining  agricultural  land.  The  insurgency  internally\ndisplaced many families who are still in the process of reestablishing themselves. Much of the\nhilly land that could offer income generation opportunities in social forestry, either is under the\nexclusive  control  of  the  Forest  Department  or  is  subject  to  forestry  regulations  that  act  as  a\ndisincentive to private forestry investments. This situation has forced poor CHT households to\nadopt a range of coping strategies to address food insecurity, including borrowing from relatives\nor moneylenders at high rates of interest, reducing the number of meals or the amount of food\nconsumed,  consuming  wild  foods  during  certain  times  of  the  year,  substituting  less  nutritious\nfoods  for  consumption,  selling  livestock  and  other  assets  that  are  difficult  for  them  to  replace,\nand seeking alternative employment often on a low daily wage.\n\n3. \n\nLand Use in CHT\n\nA  land-use  capability  survey  in  19668  designated  four  classes  of  land  in  the  CHT\n12.\naccording to productive capability, and assigned land areas to each of the classes.9 The survey\nresults  indicated  that  the  predominance  of  severely  sloping  land  places  limits  on  development\noptions  available  to  land  users.  Only  about  21  percent  of  the  land  can  sustain  agricultural\nproduction.  The vast majority of the land area\u201479 percent has slopes of over 40 degrees\u2014is,\nby  international  standards,  unsuitable  for  sustained  agricultural  production.    Unlike  the  rest  of\nthe  country,  the  CHT  will  be  unable  to  achieve  cereal  self-sufficiency  and  will  likely  remain  a\nfood  deficit  area.  The  traditional  farming  systems  have  long  responded  to  these  land-use\nlimitations by evolving a mix of cropping alternatives, which include food, cash, and tree crops.\n\n13.\nDespite the resource limitations on expanding basic agriculture, there are considerable\nopportunities  for  developing  horticulture  and  rearing  livestock.  Farmers  in  the  CHT  have\ntraditionally grown a range of tree crops and have integrated these into their shifting cultivation\n\n                                                \n7 CARE Bangladesh.  2000.

Lake Kaptai and\nthe few main towns covered the remaining balance of land, approximately about 6 percent.\n\n\f5\n\npractice.  Traditional  shifting  cultivation  as  practiced  up  to  the  1960s  was  in  mainly  forested\nlands  where  a  long  resting  phase  was  possible,  allowing  trees  to  grow  before  lands  were\nreused.  The  original  cycle  began  with  clearing  enough  land  for  a  year\u2019s  food  in  small  and\nnoncontiguous areas near water and on low slopes. At the beginning of the monsoon, a mix of\nseeds  was  planted  in  holes  cut  into  the  soil  surface.  Principal  crops  included  hill  rice,  maize,\nmillet, sorghum, vegetables, melons, gourds, pumpkin, hill cotton, spices, and tobacco. Planting\nbegan in April on the first rains and harvest lasted from July to December to close a cycle. This\nwas essentially a sustainable system supported by trapping, gathering, and hunting in the upper\nslope  forests  where  the  forest  trees  had  a  spiritual  value  for  the  communities.  This  system\nprovided  food  and  a  surplus  for  barter.  As  population  and  land  pressures  mounted,  the  same\nareas  of  land  have  been  intensively  used  for  up  to  three  years  and  the  fallow  periods  have\nshortened  considerably.  Although  the  same  annual  subsistence  crops  remain  in  the  system,\nlonger-term cash crops such as turmeric, ginger, papaya, banana, and pioneer forest trees have\nbeen introduced in the plantings.\n\n14.\nSince  only  small  areas  are  available  for  cultivation,  the  more  productive  flat  and  lower\nsloping  lands  have  been  used  for  intensive  cereal,  fruit  tree,  and  vegetable  production,  with  a\nsteady development of existing crops and the introduction of new ones. These farming systems\nare very varied but usually include some flat land or in the beds of seasonal streams for cereal\nproduction. Farmers suggested that there is further scope for expanding fruit tree and vegetable\nproduction, if basic road communication can be improved. Better use of the available improved\ntechnology will follow if  the extension outreach systems can be broadened through the use of\nlocal  NGOs.  Similarly,  livestock  production  could  be  expanded.  Despite  the  lack  of  cereals,\nhomestead-based poultry and small animal enterprises could be developed. Many of the small\nlivestock enterprise options could be run by women, activities that have had a major influence in\nthe empowerment of women in other areas of the country. Such activities have been initiated by\nNGOs,  which  have  provided  an  integrated  technical  training,  feed  supply,  credit,  and  market\nassistance package and it is important that the CHT take advantage of these production options\nwith a similar NGO involvement(cid:1)\n\n15.\nBy far the largest natural resource in the CHT is forest, and about 325,000 ha (about 25\npercent  of  the  total  CHT  area)  is  exclusively  controlled  by  the  Forest  Department.  These\n\u201creserve  forests\u201d  have  been  managed  according  to  a  succession  of  forest  management  plans\nthat have set targets for timber extraction and reforestation. Their principal objectives have been\nto  (i)  replace  abnormal  and  less  productive  forest  with  more  commercially  valuable  and\nproductive  species,  (ii)  manage  the  forests  on  the  basis  of  sustained  yield,  (iii)  keep  sufficient\nforest cover in the watersheds to prevent denuding of the hills and the consequent erosion, and\n(iv)  derive  the  highest  possible  financial  return  and  ensure  the  maximum  use  of  produce  from\nthese  forests.  However,  the  welfare  of  the  people  living  in  and  around  the  forest  areas  was\noverridden  by  the  commercial  aims  and  these  in  turn  have  led  to  unsustainable  forestry\npractices.  Forest  diversity  and  habitat  have  been  sacrificed  and  unsustainable  monocultural\npractices have resulted in serious pest and erosion problems. Most of the forest products have\nnot been sold through competitive commercial markets but rather have been supplied to state-\nowned  industries  where  the  feedstock  is  provided  at  uneconomic  prices.10  The  situation  in\nunclassified  forestland,  which  is  theoretically  the  remainder  of  the  land  area  not  under  Forest\nDepartment  control,  is  unclear.  However,  considerable  quantities  of  timber  and  bamboo  are\nproduced  from  this  area  and  it  potentially  offers  the  opportunity  for  individual  landowners  to\ndevelop small forest-based social forestry projects.\n\n                                                \n10\n\n USAID. 1990.

Washington D.C.\n\n\f6\n\n4. \n\nGovernance Structure of the CHT\n\n16.\nThe  governance  structure  of  the  CHT  districts  is  unique  in  Bangladesh.  A  special\nministry, the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs (MCHTA) has authority over the principal\nadministrative councils (regional and hill district councils ) and development agencies. Under the\npeace  accord  of  1997,  the  CHT  Regional  Council  (CHTRC)  was  created  to  (i)  coordinate  all\ndevelopment  activities  under  the  direction  of  the  hill  district  councils  (HDCs),  including  overall\nsupervision and coordination of matters under the jurisdiction of the HDCs; (ii) coordinate and\nsupervise the local councils, including municipalities; (iii) coordinate and supervise the general\nadministration, law and order and matters related to the development of the three CHT districts;\nand (iv) provide direction in disaster management and relief programs, including coordination of\nNGO  activities.  The  CHTRC  was  formally  established  through  an  act  of  1998.  However,  the\nCHTRC  has  yet  to  be  fully  staffed  and  lacks  the  requisite  finances  to  successfully  meet  its\nmandate.\n\n17.\nThe  HDCs  were  provided  with  special  authorities  under  the  act  of  1998.  Among  other\npowers,  the  act  provided  the  HDCs  with  administrative  authority  over  the  staff  of  many  of  the\nline  ministries  in  their  area.  Among  these  transferred  departments  are  agricultural  extension,\nhealth,  family  planning,  primary  education,  cottage  industries,  cooperatives,  social  welfare,\nfisheries,  livestock,  and  the  tribal  cultural  institute.  This  arrangement  is  not  viewed  as\nsatisfactory  by  the  line  ministries  or  their  staff.  Although  nominally  in  control  of  these\ndepartments, the HDCs do not control the local development budgets of these departments and\nhave little or no influence on the design of programs or their execution. The HDCs\u2019 revenue and\ndevelopment allocations from the Government are meager and they are expected to meet the\ngreater proportion of their revenue budget from local taxes and income from market leases.\n\n18.\nThe only level of elected rural local government is the union council, of which there are\n111  in  the  CHT.  A  union  is  a  group  of  about  25-35  villages.  The  responsibilities  of  the  union\ncouncil  have  been  progressively  increased  to  include  revenue  collection  and  maintenance  of\nrural roads and small infrastructure projects. To improve coordination among union councils, the\nUpazila (subdistrict) Development Coordination Committee (UDCC) was created, with the union\ncouncil  chairpersons  as  voting  members  and  the  subdistrict  level  officials  of  the  central\ngovernment  ministries  as  nonvoting  members.  While  the  union  councils  are  democratically\nelected bodies, they have weaknesses, such as few permanent staff and very limited financial\nresources.  The  union  councils  have  access  to  additional  sources  of  revenue  for  infrastructure\nactivities  through  the  annual  Government  Block  Grant  for  Union  and  Subdistrict  Development,\nchanneled through the HDCs. Lastly, the CHT has an important traditional governing structure\nadministered  through  three  circle  chiefs.  The  outreach  authority  of  the  chiefs  is  through\nheadmen and further down through karbaris, who are village-level traditional land administrators\nand land revenue officers that were recognized by the civil government. They still perform these\nfunctions, but their role in land allocation has been considerably lessened in the last 20 years.\nThese  traditional  leaders  still  resolve  social  problems  and  provide  a  valuable  and  trusted\nnonpolitical form of guidance for local communities.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n19.\nThe Government\u2019s strategy for development of the rural sector is enunciated in a series\nof  five-year  plans.  The  current  Fifth  Five-Year  Plan  (the  Plan),  for  fiscal  year  (FY)  1998-2002,\nidentified the following objectives for development of the rural sector: (i) poverty alleviation and\nimprovement in the quality of life for the rural poor through increasing their income generating\nand  employment  opportunities;  (ii)  empowerment  of  the  rural  poor  through  increasing  their\n\n\f7\n\naccess  to  productive  resources;  (iii)  attainment  of  food  security;  (iv)  development  of  rural\ninfrastructure,  including  market  outlets,  for  improved  marketing  of  rural  products  within  and\noutside  the  locality;  (v)  development  of  neglected  areas  including  the  CHT;  (vi)  closing  of  the\ngender  gap  by  giving  priority  to  women\u2019s  education,  training,  and  employment,  and  providing\nspecial  support  for  education  of  girls;  and  (vii)  putting  in  place  of  effective  local  government\ninstitutions  with  the  responsibility  for  design,  formulation,  and  implementation  of  local-level\ndevelopment programs and projects, with the active participation of the rural population.\n\nThe strategy to achieve these objectives include (i) the provision of skills training for self-\n20.\nemployment  in  the  nonfarm  sector;  (ii)  formal  and  informal  group  formation  and  group\ndevelopment  for  cooperative  activities;  (iii)  resource  mobilization  through  individual/group\nsavings; (iv) creation of an enabling environment for sustainable microfinance; (v) general rural\ninfrastructure  development  including  roads  (and  related  bridges  and  culverts),  small  irrigation\nand  flood  control  related  infrastructure,  and  continued  support  for  the  rural  maintenance\nprogram  aimed  at  the  poorest  of  the  poor;  (vi)  land  reform;  and  (vii)  strengthening  of  local\ngovernment institutions. The budget allocation in the current five-year plan for rural development\nis approximately Tk87 billion, more than five times the Tk16 billion provided in the previous five-\nyear plan. The majority of the budget (Tk56 billion) is allocated for infrastructure development. A\nmajor  focus  of  the  plan  is  local-level  participatory  planning  and  integration  of  the  local-level\ndevelopment  programs/projects  with \nlevel.  Capacity  building  of\nimplementing  agencies  is  also  emphasized,  and  local  government  is  to  be  closely  involved  in\npoverty alleviation and rural development. The plan also envisages a partnership between the\npublic sector and NGOs, with the latter complementing development efforts of the former, and\nsupports  the  development  of  microfinance  through  government  and  nongovernment  credit\nagencies to increase income generating opportunities in the rural sector.\n\nthe  national \n\nthose  at \n\n21.\nThe plan identified three regions in the country, including the CHT, for special attention\nwith  development  interventions  aimed  at,  among  other  things,  improving  the  region\u2019s\ninfrastructure  and  telecommunication  facilities,  facilitating  horticultural  development,  increasing\nthe provision of safe drinking water, preventing further soil erosion, and expanding agricultural\nextension  services.  Ongoing  efforts  at  reducing  poverty  in  the  CHT  are  limited  to  a  group  of\npublic  expenditure  programs  associated  with  the  development  of  rural  infrastructure.  These\nprograms  (including  Food-for-Work,  Vulnerable  Group  Development,  and  Rural  Maintenance)\nserve  both  transfer  payment  and  human  capital  accumulation  objectives.  Food-for-Work\nprovides  wheat  in  exchange  for  work  on  rural  infrastructure  projects,  Vulnerable  Group\nDevelopment  provides \nto  disadvantaged  women,  and  Rural\nMaintenance employs destitute women in labor intensive rural road maintenance.\n\nfood  grains  and \n\ntraining \n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nExternal  agencies  continue  to  provide  substantial  support  to  the  Government\u2019s  rural\n22.\ndevelopment  efforts  through  a  wide  range  of  projects  supporting  agricultural  development  and\nincome  and  employment  generation  (Appendix  3).  Since  1984,  nearly  $2.2  billion  in  external\nassistance has been provided for such projects with ADB and the World Bank being the major\nfunding sources. Since 1990, the Government and external agencies have financed a series of\ninvestment  projects  that  directly  target  the  rural  poor,  and  16  projects  in  this  category  are\nongoing,  valued  at  about  $400  million  in  this  category.  Many  of  these  projects  involve\ngovernment and NGOs, and are part of a growing trend in public-private sector partnerships.\n\n23.\nSimilarly, investments in physical infrastructure have been substantial and the combined\nvalue  of  the  ongoing  externally  financed  rural  infrastructure  development  projects  since  the\n\n\f8\n\nstrategy\u2019s inception in 1984 is about $900 million. Most of the rural infrastructure development\nprojects  financed  by  external  agencies  are  geographically  based,  and  there  is  coordination,\nthrough  the  Government,  of  the  various  investments  with  the  aim  of  achieving  nationwide\ncoverage.  In  more  recent  projects,  the  Government  and  the  external  agencies  have  given\ngreater  emphasis  to  key  sector,  policy,  and  institutional  issues  alongside  the  investments  in\nphysical rural infrastructure. ADB has financed advisory TA for institutional capacity building in\nthe  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)11  through  its  Management  Capability\nStrengthening Project (MANCAPS), which has an action plan and detailed recommendations to\nstrengthen LGED\u2019s management structure and capacity to reflect its existing and future range of\nresponsibilities.12  The  recommendations  are  being  implemented  with  coordinated  external\nfinancing support.\n\nOnly limited externally-assisted programs have been undertaken in the CHT during the\n24.\nlast 20 years because of the insurgency. Among the first was the ADB-financed Chittagong Hill\nTracts Development Project,13 a traditional integrated rural development project, which began in\n1979 and consisted of seven major components.14  The Project covered one of the three CHT\ndistricts  (Khagrachi),  and  was  completed  in  1992.  The  two-phase  Integrated  Community\nDevelopment Program supported by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) was initiated\nin 1980 and tested in two pilot projects over five years. Phase 1 of the main project was begun\nin 1985 and completed in 1995. This phase covered about 18,000 families in the three districts\nwith  the  main  activities  being  preschool  education,  youth  training,  water  supply  installation,\ndistribution of seedlings and seeds, and microcredit.  A five-year second phase of the program,\nwhich began in 1996, aims at expanding education through the formal and nonformal systems,\npreventing waterborne diseases caused by fecal matter, and reducing malnutrition and mortality\nin mothers and children. The project has been notably successful in improving education at the\npreschool level and in improving the general health situation. However, its credit management\nperformance  has  been  disappointing  with  recovery  rates  averaging  between  10-15  percent,\nattributed to poor loan supervision procedures. World Food Programme (WFP) activities in the\nCHT have been principally supported by the Australian and Canadian governments. In addition\nto  the  Vulnerable  Group  Development  and  Food-for-Work  schemes,  WFP  in  1998  began  the\nExpanded  Food  Assistance  Program  to  cope  with  the  return  of  displaced  persons  to  the  CHT\nfollowing the peace accord.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nlearned \n\nfrom  several  ADB-financed  rural  development  projects  highlights \n\nA  1997  ADB  study  of  completed,  postevaluated  projects  in  Bangladesh,15  as  well  as\n25.\nthe\nlessons \nimportance  of  (i)  institutional  strengthening  to  ensure  institutional  capacity  of  the  executing\nagencies and regional/district entities and beneficiary groups; (ii) the need to ensure beneficiary\nparticipation  as  early  as  possible,  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  project,  and  in\noperations  and  maintenance  (O&M)  after  project  completion  as  well;  (iii)  effective  sector\n                                                \n11  TA 1809-BAN: Strengthening LGED's Management Capability, for $740,000, approved on 21 December 1992.\n1122 1995.

Situating the project management team in the project area affords it the opportunity to\nbetter understand beneficiary constraints and aspirations, and to adjust project components and\nimplementation arrangements as required.\n\n26.\nLessons  learned  from  the  completion  of  the  ADB-financed  Rural  Women  Employment\nCreation  Project16  indicate  that  where  NGOs  are  used  to  provide  services  in  a  project  a  clear\nexit  strategy  should  be  defined  so  that  the  development  of  beneficiary  organizations  and  the\ncapacity to replace NGO involvement is not stifled.  The results of the project also highlight the\nimportance  of  training  for  developing  microenterprises  and  for  expanding  small  and  medium\nbusinesses.  Training schedules and duration should be carefully designed and adjusted to the\nabsorptive capacity of microentrepreneurs.  Long-term training programs involving multiple short\nbut  frequent  training  events,  and  refresher  training  is  more  effective  than  a  single  long-term\nprogram.\n\nADB\u2019s Rural Infrastructure Development Project,17 completed in 1997, found that people\n27.\nwithin  the  influence  area  of  the  improved  infrastructure  obtained  easier  access  to  agricultural\ninputs  at  reduced  prices,  increased  their  use  of  high  yielding  varieties,  enhanced  their\nagricultural  production  and  had  easier  access  to  health  and  education  facilities.  Small-scale\nindustries  and  trading  activities  also  increased.    Among  lessons  learned  from  this  and  other\nsimilar projects relevant to the proposed intervention are that (i) greater attention must be given\nto  maintaining  the  improved  infrastructure  to  sustain  the  flow  of  benefits;  (ii)  the  role  and\ncapacity of local government institutions in rural infrastructure planning, implementation, O&M,\nand financing should be strengthened; (iii) more participatory approaches should be adopted in\nrural infrastructure development projects to derive larger benefits; (iv) procurement of essential\nequipment, recruitment of consultants, and appointment of project staff should be advanced so\nthat project implementation will commence as soon as the loan becomes effective; and (v) high\ntechnical  standards  for  infrastructure  works  should  be  assured  by  technical  and  management\ntraining of prequalified local contractors, strict supervision of works by LGED staff supported by\nconsultants,  adequate  laboratory  facilities  for  quality  control  testing,  and  sufficient  LGED  staff\ncapacity at the field level.  A lesson from an earlier ADB-financed CHT Project (footnote 13) was\nthat  the  project  design  should  take  into  account  local  patterns  of  social  organization,  religious\nbeliefs,  and  resource  use  of  the  indigenous  population  living  in  the  project  area  and  that  the\ninvolvement of tribal leaders from village to district level is important for project implementation.\n\nLessons learned from an ADB evaluation study18 indicated that a participatory planning\n28.\napproach  involving  stakeholders  and  facilitation  by  NGOs  would  improve  the  outcome  of\nagriculture  and  natural  resource  projects  in  Bangladesh.  Thus,  there  is  a  need  for  ADB  to\nsupport a more participatory approach for project preparatory TAs in the agriculture and natural\nresource sector.  A 1999 joint ADB and World Bank country portfolio review mission identified a\nnumber  of  implementation  issues  that  could  have  relevance  to  the  Project.  These  include:  (i)\nfrequent transfers of project directors and other key staff, (ii) cumbersome procedures and lack\n\n                                                \n16  Loan 1067-BAN: Rural Women Employment Creation Project, for $8.0 million, approved on 13 December 1990.\n17  Loan 908-BAN: Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for $99.8 million, approved on 13 October 1988.\n18    Operations  Evaluation  Office.  1998.

A  key  feature  of  this  strategy  is  an  emphasis  on  promoting  rural\ndevelopment,  including  rural  roads,  small  irrigation  projects,  crop/agro  business  credit,  and\nmicrofinance, which should have a direct impact on the poor and improve income distribution.\n\n30.\nThe poverty reduction objective of ADB's operational strategy for Bangladesh was also\nemphasized in a recently signed partnership agreement on poverty reduction between ADB and\nthe Government.  The partnership agreement sets long-term and medium-term goals based on\nthe  Government's  vision  and  plans  for  poverty  reduction\u2014both  the  income  and  nonincome\naspects.  It also guides ADB's medium-term operations to support the Government's medium-\nterm priorities through pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. To make the\ngrowth more pro-poor, the strategy would be to adopt an area approach to target assistance to\nareas  of  high  poverty  concentration.  The  strategy  identified  measures  to  enable  agricultural\ngrowth  through  rural  infrastructure,  community  development,  microfinance,  and  NGO/private\nsector  participation  in  rural  areas,  among  other  things.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s\ncountry operational strategy and the partnership agreement in that it aims at reducing poverty in\none  of  the  poorest  areas  of  the  country  through  improving  rural  infrastructure,  community\ndevelopment, microfinance, and NGO participation in rural areas.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n1. \n\nLand Tenure Security\n\n31.\nLand  tenure  issues  have  been  at  the  root  of  the  civil  unrest  that  has  affected  the  CHT\nover the last two decades and the peace accord proposed two specific measures to address the\nproblems:  (i)  a  land  commission  was  to  be  established  to  review  and  rule  on  all  the  disputed\ntitles, and (ii) a new and comprehensive land ownership survey was to be undertaken. Little or\nno  progress  has  been  made  in  either  of  these  areas.  During  the  benchmark  survey  and  the\nparticipatory  rural  appraisals,  all  ethnic  groups  expressed  concern  over  the  land  ownership\nissue.  There  was  a  general  comment  that  individual  enterprise  development  and  the\nsubsequent  improvement  in  incomes  would  not  gain  momentum  while  land  issues  remained\nunresolved. Much of the disputed land is flat or of low contour and is able to support a full range\nof agricultural enterprises. The tribal community also sees the activities of the land commission\nand the land ownership survey as an important process in recognizing ownership in traditional\ntribal  land  areas  and  providing  individuals  with  a  secure  title  for  enterprise  development.  Little\n\n                                                \n1199   ADB Country Operational Strategy for Bangladesh, August 1999.\n\n\f11\n\nprogress  has  been  made  toward  establishing  a  fully-functioning  land  commission.  A  retired\njudge has been appointed by the Government to chair the commission. However, until a case\npending in the Supreme Court over rightful appointment to the commission of one of the tribal\nex-officio  members  is  resolved,  the  commission  will  not  be  fully  formed  and  cannot  begin  its\nactivities. The activities of the land commission are integrally linked to the undertaking of a fair\nand comprehensive land survey in the CHT in light of concern that the survey would be used to\nstrengthen  the  case  for  settlers  against  the  indigenous  population,  many  of  whom  have\ntraditionally never held paper evidence of title to land.\n\nADB, through this Project and the CHT Region Development Plan20 TA currently under\n32.\nimplementation,  will  continue  to  encourage  the  Government  to  seek  ways  for  the  land\ncommission  to  be  formed  and  become  functional  in  a  way  that  would  be  satisfactory  to  the\nCHT\u2019s population. The Project will also assist through providing legal literacy training to promote\nawareness among stakeholders (beneficiaries, traditional leaders, and local elected government\nofficials) of their legal rights and providing training and information to empower them to exercise\nthose rights. The goal of such training is to provide local communities with basic awareness of\nthe law and concept of rights.  The Project will use the strategies for the delivery of legal literacy\ndeveloped under ADB's TA 5856.21\n\n2. \n\nSustainability of Investments in Rural Infrastructure\n\n33.\nA  critical  policy  issue  in  rural  infrastructure  development  in  Bangladesh  is  the  need  to\nensure  sustainability  of  the  benefits  derived  from  the  investments.  In  this  regard,  continuing\nassistance  is  required  to  encourage  the  Government  and  LGED  to  improve  the  system  and\narrangements for maintenance. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government has focused on this\nissue through implementation of the following(cid:2)\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAction for Maintenance of Rural Infrastructure under the first Rural Infrastructure\nDevelopment Project (RIDP). \u2014 LGED prepared a plan for budgetary allocations\nrequired  to  maintain  rural  infrastructure  improved  under  the  first  RIDP  and  has\nbeen  providing  sufficient  funds  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  of  feeder\nroads in accordance with the plan.\n\nInstitutional and Financial Action Plan for Maintenance of Rural Infrastructure. \u2014\nThis  plan  is  being  implemented  under  the  Second  RIDP22  to  increase  the\ncapacity  of  local  governments  for  adequate  maintenance  of  rural  infrastructure.\nUnder  the  plan,  LGED  established  a  rural  infrastructure  maintenance  cell  in\nDecember 1992 and completed a comprehensive inventory of feeder roads and\nrural roads in May 1993.\n\nAction Plan for Directions in Management Development of LGED. \u2014  This plan,\nwhich  aims  at  strengthening  the  management  capacity  of  LGED  in  rural\ndevelopment  activities \ninfrastructure,  was\nprepared  under  the  MANCAPS  TA  (footnotes  11  and  12)  and  was  adopted  in\nMarch 1995 by a national workshop involving many external agencies. A number\nof  the  recommendations  are  being  implemented  through  ongoing  projects.  The\n\nincluding  maintenance  of  rural \n\n                                                \n20  TA 3328-BAN: CHT Region Development Plan, for $1.0 million, approved on 8 December 1999.\n21  TA 5856-REG: Legal Literacy for Supporting Governance, for $500,000, approved on 24 August 1999.\n22  Loan 1215-BAN: Second Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for $83.4 million, approved on 21 December\n\n1992.\n\n\f12\n\nProject will carry out the remaining recommendations, including those related to\nresource mobilization at the local level.\n\n34.\nIn FY1993 the Government, for the first time, allocated a specific budgetary line item to\nLGED for the maintenance of rural infrastructure for the whole country. The amount was Tk250\nmillion.  This  allocation  has  gradually  been  increased  and  totaled  Tk1  billion  in  FY1999.\nHowever, the Government funds need to be supplemented by resource mobilization at the local\ngovernment  level  and  the  financial  performance  of  the  union  councils  requires  substantial\nimprovement.  Many  of  the  roads  to  be  upgraded  under  the  Project  will  require  a  high  level  of\nmaintenance  and  in  future  will  impose  a  significant  increase  in  the  annual  road  maintenance\ncosts  for  the  area.  The  existing  work  programs  alone  are  unlikely  to  be  able  to  accommodate\nthis incremental cost beyond the life of the Project. ADB received Government assurance that\nthe  requisite  financial  allocations  will  be  made  to  LGED  through  the  Rural  Infrastructure\nMaintenance  Program  and  to  the  lower  tiers  of  the  local  government  structure  to  ensure\nadequate maintenance of the improved infrastructure. Upgraded rural infrastructure also will be\nmaintained  through  local  labor  contracting  societies.  In  addition,  local  community  groups  and\nunion  councils  also  will  be  responsible  for  subsequent  maintenance  of  structures  upgraded\nunder  the  Project.  The  beneficiaries  will  be  instrumental  in  the  selection,  design,  and\nimplementation  of  village  infrastructure  activities,  and  therefore  will  be  responsible  for\nmaintaining most of the village infrastructure provided under the Project.\n\n3. \n\nAccess to Forest Land for Social Forestry Activities\n\n35.\nMost  forestland  is  unclassified  but  offers  the  potential  for  social  forestry  activities\n(para. 15).  Difficulties  are  being  faced  in  these  lands  as  permits  to  cut  and  transport  forest\nproducts are required and issued by the Forest Department.23 The procedure to gain a permit is\nvery difficult to follow. Additionally, several Forest Department checkpoints on the major roads\nleading out of the CHT, which are ostensibly placed to intercept the illegal timber trade, act as a\ndisincentive to the development of agro-forestry. There are many options for participatory forest\nprojects involving joint ventures between the Forest Department and local communities, but the\nForest Department has been unwilling to accept this activity as part of an overall development\nstrategy. Forestry development opportunities that could be developed under the proposed loan\nwould be limited by the above constraints.  Satisfactory resolution of these issues will require a\nclear forestry policy, including clarification of land classification, and a review of the system of\npermit  allocation  with  the  aim  of  developing  appropriate  regulation  for  allocation  of  permits  to\nindividuals  and  communities  for  forest  exploitation.  Under  the  Forestry  Sector  Project,24  the\nGovernment is making an effort to increase access of local communities to forestland for social\nforestry activities.  Parliament passed on 10 April 2000 the Forest Act Amendment 2000, which\nproposes  a  set  of  draft  rules  aimed  at  establishing  regulatory  framework  conducive  for\nimplementing social forestry activities in the country. The Government is currently undertaking\nstakeholder  consultations  to  secure  input  on  the  draft  rules.  The  Project  will  liaise  with  the\nForestry Sector Project to continue the dialogue with the Government on this issue.\n\n                                                \n23  The Forest Transit Rules of 1973 and the Forest Act of 1927 govern the issuance of permits.\n24  Loan 1486-BAN: Forestry Sector Project, for $50 million, approved on 21 November 1996.\n\n\f13\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nFor  the  20  years  prior  to  the  1997  peace  accord,  the  CHT  had  been  under  a  state  of\n36.\ninsurgency, the rural infrastructure had substantially deteriorated, and the lives and livelihoods\nof the rural population had been severely disrupted. Despite the cessation of hostilities, little has\nchanged  for  the  region\u2019s  rural  population.  Rural  poverty  and  lack  of  resources  epitomize\neconomic life in the CHT. A large percentage of the farming community consists of people who\ndo not have secure rights to land use, but who work as tenant farmers, clearly a disincentive to\ntheir investing in improved farming techniques and resource management. These people suffer\nfrom  seasonal  food  insecurity.  Additionally,  the  weak  institutional  support  system  is  unable  to\naddress the needs of the rural poor, landless, and tribal population, and is still in the process of\nconsiderable change and reorganization.\n\n37.\nThe  Project  will  be  the  first  major  development  initiative  in  the  CHT  since  the  peace\naccord.  The Project has been designed to upgrade the socioeconomic infrastructure in the CHT\nand to increase employment and income generating opportunities for the rural population. The\ndesign  of  the  Project  has  taken  into  consideration  (i)  the  impact  of  completed  and  ongoing\nprojects  in  Bangladesh,  and  the  recommendations  in  the  impact  evaluation  study  including\nlessons learned (paras. 25-28); (ii) promotion of development that is sustainable in terms of the\nnatural  environment  and  the  capabilities  of  the  target  groups;  (iii)  the  overall  capacity  of  the\nexecuting and implementing agencies, and the need for clear lines of authority, delegation, and\ncoordination  between  concerned  government  agencies;  (iv)  the  adequate  provision  for  future\nO&M  of  upgraded  facilities;  (v)  the  fragile  political  environment  in  the  CHT,  and  the  complex\ninterrelationships between line agencies, the regional council and HDCs; (vi) the importance of\nconfidence  building  among  beneficiaries,  particularly  among  the  tribal  population  (including\nreturnees from India), poor landless groups, and women; and (vii) appropriate structures for the\noverall management of the Project and expected contributions from beneficiaries.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe  primary  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  absolute  poverty\n38.\namong the rural population of the CHT through developing the basic physical infrastructure and\nexpanding  income  and  employment-generating  opportunities  that  will  substantially  raise  the\nstandard  of  living  of  the  landless  and  small  marginal  farmers.  These  developments  will\nrecognize  the  unique  and  fragile  physical  environment  and  will  incorporate  sound  sustainable\nmanagement  practices.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the  thrust  of  the  Government\u2019s  rural\ndevelopment  strategy.  It  also  directly  supports  the  emerging  collaboration  between  the\nGovernment  and  the  NGOs  in  the  provision  of  services,  including  microfinance,  to  the  rural\npoor.  A  supporting  objective  will  be  to  provide  a  confidence-building  environment  to  underpin\nthe peace accord in which all the ethnic groups in the local communities will be empowered to\ndecide  on  their  own  development  priorities  and  take  on  ownership  of  the  subsequent\ninvestments.  These  objectives  will  be  achieved  through  initiatives  in  the  following  areas:  (i)\ntechnology, to improve infrastructure and on- and off-farm productivity, and to facilitate village-\nlevel  productive  activities;  (ii)  organization,  to  improve  local  and  institutional  capacity  to  build,\nimplement,  operate  and  support  project  activities,  and  to  address  structural  and  institutional\nconstraints; and (iii) sustainability, to (a) improve the levels of participation and inclusion of the\nintended beneficiaries, including women and the tribal population; (b) enhance food and income\nsecurity; and (c) build supportive economic mechanisms, and social and political institutions.\n\n\f14\n\nThe project scope includes (i) upgrading of feeder roads, rural roads, trails, bridges, and\n39.\nculverts;  (ii)  a  community  development  component  that  will  establish  a  community  investment\nfund to provide funds for small-scale activities at the village level; (iii) improved and increased\nproductivity  through  better  access  to  microfinance,  training,  and  other  support  services  to\nenable  the  poor  to  improve  their  income  generating  capacity;  and  (iv)  project  management\nsupport.  The  project  area  includes  the  three  CHT  districts:  Bandarban,  Khagrachari,  and\nRangamati.\n\nThe target beneficiaries will be (i) poor shifting cultivators who are unable to meet their\n40.\nbasic consumption needs and whose main source of income is manual labor; (ii) poor landless\nfarmers  who  have  less  than  0.2  ha  of  cereal  production  land,  including  homesteads,  and\ndepend on manual labor as their main source of income; and (iii) the absolutely poor marginal\nfarmers with less than 0.45 ha of cereal production land. Data in the CHT on household caloric\nintake is generally inadequate. Target beneficiaries have a family income of less than Tk20,000\nper annum and are below the food poverty line in the Government\u2019s poverty index. The primary\nproject  beneficiaries  will  be  about  52,000  rural  families,  which  is  about  40  percent  of  the  total\nrural  farm  families  in  the  CHT.  Given  the  opportunity,  farmers  and  householders  in  the  above\ncategories  respond  successfully  to  well  focused  agricultural,  horticultural,  and  livestock  and\nother  credit  schemes  and  technical  services,  and  are  able  to  cope  with  the  new  enterprise\nresponsibilities. A range of secondary target beneficiaries may include farmer groups, producer\nassociations,  and  small  local  entrepreneurs.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  institutional\nstrengthening  for  planning  and  implementing  agencies,  which  could  involve  public  sector\nentities,  union  councils,  NGOs,  and  village/community  management  groups.  The  physical\ntargets for the infrastructure and credit components are indicative given the demand-driven and\nconsultative  process  approach  to  implementation  of  the  Project.  Flexibility  is  required  in  the\nscheduling  and  achievement  of  the  implementation  targets.  In  practice,  achievements  will\ndepend on the demand from the communities.\n\n1. \n\nUpgrading and Rehabilitation of Rural Infrastructure\n\n41.\nThe  inadequate  road  and  trail  network  is  a  major  deficiency  in  the  CHT,  and\nimprovements are needed to connect the scattered rural communities with the existing growth\ncenters.  The  rural  infrastructure  component  of  the  Project  targets  improvements  for  feeder\nroads  and  rural  roads  and  construction  of  bridges  and  culverts.  These  improvements  will\nincrease the access of remote communities to health and education facilities, lower the costs of\ntransport, and result in higher prices for agricultural outputs and lower costs of inputs.  Indicative\nrural infrastructure targets proposed under the Project include improvement of (i) up to 75 km of\nfeeder roads type B and up to 350 km of rural roads; (ii) construction of about 6,069 meters of\nbridges  and  culverts  needed  for  these  roads  and  to  fill  gaps  in  some  existing  roads;  and  (iii)\nprovision  of  vehicles,  large  machinery,  equipment  and  consulting  services  to  successfully\nimplement the component. With the exception of the municipal areas, road distribution funding\nhas been allocated on the basis of population. Construction priorities will be established through\na consultative process with the involved communities. Standard LGED designs, specifications,\nand implementation procedures will be used for the roads. Much of the work will be carried out\nusing labor intensive procedures through local labor contracting societies.\n\n42.\nLGED  has  identified  potential  rural  roads  for  improvement  under  the  Project.    The\nprioritization  and  final  selection  of  rural  roads  will  be  done  through  further  study  of  district\n\n\f15\n\nindicative development potential maps25 and district rural road inventory maps26 to be developed\nby  LGED\u2019s  Geographic  Information  System  (GIS)  Unit,  and  further  discussions  with  target\ncommunities  and  union  councils.    Site  selection  for  small  road  structures  (bridges,  crossings\nand culverts) will be carried out during project implementation through local participation and will\nreflect  local  priorities.  The  following  criteria  will  be  applied  in  reviewing  proposals  for  such\nstructures: (i) investment will be limited to spanning of gaps or replacement of badly damaged\nstructures;  and  (ii)  investment  should  increase  the  connectivity  of  the  rural  road  network  by\nmaking lengths of road that connect rural areas into a higher level of network, or to an important\nplace, continuously passable by wheeled vehicles. These participatory procedures are familiar\nto  LGED  and  have  been  used  successfully  in  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  Third  Rural\nInfrastructure Development Project.27\n\n2.\n\nCommunity Development\n\n43.\nCommunity-specific  efforts  are  needed  to  fill  gaps  in  the  social  and  economic\ninfrastructure.  Unlike  their  counterparts  in  the  plains  districts,  communities  in  the  CHT  are\nusually  small  and  scattered.  They  are  characterized  by  the  absence  or  poor  state  of  basic\namenities  such  as  infrastructure  for  drinking  water,  drainage,  sanitation,  markets,  and\ncommunity  buildings.  The  Project  will  respond \nfor  priority  small-scale\nsocioeconomic  infrastructure  to  be  identified  and  prioritized  by  the  communities.  A  community\ninvestment fund (CIF) will be established and managed by the project management unit (PMU)\nat the regional level to provide block grants of approximately $70,000 to each union council area\nfor  community  development  activities.  The  CIF  will  finance  demand-driven,  community-based\ninvestments  in  small-scale  civil  works  or  other  socioeconomic  infrastructure,  on  a  direct\npayment  basis  between  the  PMU  and  the  contractors.  Each  investment  could  be  for  an\nindividual village or for a group of villages.\n\nthe  needs \n\nto \n\n44.\nExamples of investments eligible for financing include (i) economic infrastructure such as\nmini-irrigation  works,  solar  paneling,  and  small  markets;  and  (ii)  social  infrastructure  such  as\nvillage  health  posts,  community  water/sanitation  schemes,  literacy  centers,  and  community\ncenters.  Items  that  will  not  be  eligible  for  financing  under  this  component  include  purchase  or\nleasing  of  land,  rehabilitation  or  construction  on  private  land,  completion  of  unfinished\nconstruction projects, and facilities that do not directly or indirectly increase the productivity of\nthe poor.\n\n45.\nA  significant  indicator  of  \u201cdemand\u201d  under  this  component  will  be  the  extent  to  which\ncommunities  are  willing  to  contribute  to  investments  and  to  the  O&M  of  the  completed  project\nfacilities.  A community\u2019s contributions to an activity will be an important criterion for its eligibility\nfor  funding.  Contributions  could  include  cash,  labor,  or  beneficiary  participation  in  planning,\nimplementation,  and  O&M.  The  communities  are  to  base  their  level  of  contribution  on  what  is\naffordable, with some flexibility to accommodate especially difficult circumstances. Investments\nmade from  the CIFs  will attract differing percentage contributions, but in general will be 10-25\npercent  of  a  subproject  cost.  To  facilitate  this  process,  project  staff,  especially  the  community\ndevelopment organizers, will work with LGED and other service providers to produce a \u201cmenu\u201d\n\n                                                \n25    An  indicative  map  indicates  large  settlements,  areas  of  extensive  agricultural/livestock  production,  forest  areas,\nimportant  water  bodies  (rivers,  lakes,  ponds,  etc.),  existing  socioeconomic  infrastructure  (markets  for\nagricultural/livestock  products,  bazaars,  administrative  centers,  health  centers,  schools,  etc.),  and  any  other\nrelevant existing and potential areas where economic and/or development activities are in progress or planned.\n26  A rural road inventory map indicates the existing network of rural roads and the link to higher-class road networks.\n27    Loan  1581-BAN:  Third Rural Infrastructure Development Project,  for  $70.0  million,  approved  on  20  November\n\n1997.\n\n\f16\n\nof  small-scale  socioeconomic  infrastructure  investments.    LGED  already  has  photographs  and\ncost estimates of a range of such sample investments.  Development and use of the menu will\ngive  communities  ideas  about  what  could  be  done  and  cost.  The  communities  and  union\ncouncils will be required, as far as possible, to contribute labor to the subproject and maintain it\nwhen completed.\n\n3.\n\nMicroenterprise Development\n\nThe  generation  of  additional  income  through  the  expansion  and/or  development  of\n46.\nmicroenterprises  at  the  farm  and  household  level  can  significantly  reduce  poverty  among  the\nProject\u2019s  target  beneficiaries.  Despite  its  resource  constraints,  the  CHT  has  opportunities  for\ninvestments  that  can  be  practically  implemented.  Capital  to  access  better  agriculture  inputs  is\nneeded  to  enable  farmers  to  improve  their  farming  systems.  Capital  is  also  needed  for\ndiversification  into  other  income  generating  activities  to  supplement  the  income  from  crops.\nSpecifically, this includes investment in fertilizer and improved seeds for staples and horticulture\ncrops  (fruit  trees  and  vegetables).  Capital  also  will  be  required  to  develop  small  private\nnurseries  to  provide  seedlings  required  by  farmers.  Households  will  need  credit  to  purchase\nsmall  animals  such  as  chickens,  ducks,  and  goats,  where  appropriate,  and  to  invest  in  other\nactivities such as fishponds and small-scale agro-processing. Households also will require credit\nto diversify and/or supplement their income sources through off-farm activities such as weaving,\ntailoring, small machinery maintenance facilities, bicycle/tricycle repair, and petty trading.\n\n47.\nFormal  credit  providers  have  a  long  history  of  involvement  in  the  CHT.  Their  services,\nhowever, have not been targeted at the poor, predominantly rural population. Some NGOs have\nbeen providing very limited microfinance services to the CHT population since implementation\nof  the  1997  peace  accord,  with  limited  success.  Strong  consideration  will  be  given  to  using\nNGOs  to  establish  savings  and  credit  groups  at  the  village  level  and  to  provide  short-  and\nmedium-term credit for a range of on-farm and off-farm enterprises, and supporting services for\nthe  target  population.  The  microenterprise  development  component  will  be  targeted  at\nhouseholds  with  annual  incomes  of  less  than  Tk20,000,  and  will  primarily  focus  on  supplying\nservices to women, who are expected to make up at least 70 percent of project borrowers. To\nsupport  the  credit  provision  through  the  NGOs,  the  Project  will  fund  a  concurrent  program  to\ntrain  potential  borrowers  in  credit  use  awareness  and  skill  development.  Prior  to  obtaining\nfinancing under the Project, prospective borrowers must have taken part in the training program.\n\n4.\n\nProject Management Support\n\n48.\nA PMU will be established in Rangamati (para. 54) and one district project management\nunit (DPMU) each in Bandarban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati districts (para. 57). The PMU will\nbe  responsible  for  the  overall  management  of  the  Project,  coordination  of  the  work  of  the\nimplementing agencies, and carrying out of the Project\u2019s capacity building and training program.\nA team of international and domestically recruited consultants and locally contracted NGOs will\nsupport  the  PMU  in  these  tasks.  To  facilitate  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Project,\nvehicles,  office  equipment,  and  furniture  will  be  provided  to  the  PMU  and  DPMUs.  Training  of\nthe project staff, CHTRC, HDCs, local NGOs, and project beneficiaries will also be provided as\npart  of  the  capacity  building  activities  under  this  project  component.  A  small  project  liaison\noffice,  to  be  headed  by  an  assistant  project  director,  will  be  established  in  Dhaka  to  facilitate\ncommunication  between  the  PMU  and  relevant  Dhaka-based  ministries  and  agencies  and\nfollow-up procurement and budget-related activities for the Project.\n\n\fC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n17\n\n49.\nTotal  project  cost,  inclusive  of  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties,  is  estimated  at  $60.3\nmillion  equivalent,  comprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  about  $11.0  million  equivalent  (18\npercent)  and  local  currency  cost  of  about  $49.3  million  equivalent  (82  percent).  No  recurrent\ncosts, other than the annual operating costs for project management support, will be financed\nunder the Project. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are\nin Appendix 4.\n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nA. Base Cost\n\n1.

The loan will finance $8.3 million\nequivalent  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $21.7  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.\nLoan  proceeds  will  finance  civil  works  associated  with  the  rural  infrastructure  and  community\ndevelopment  components  of  the  Project,  procurement  of  vehicles  and  equipment  and  their\noperating  costs,  consulting  services,  beneficiary  and  NGO  training,  institutional  strengthening\nand  capacity  building,  and  project  management  costs.  The  Danish  International  Development\nAgency  (Danida)  has  agreed  in  principle  to  provide  parallel  grant  financing  of  the  costs  of\nupgrading  the  rural  infrastructure  in  Khagrachari  District,  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  $15\nmillion.  The  Government  will  contribute  approximately  15  percent  of  total  project  costs,\namounting  to  nearly  $9.1  million  in  local  currency  cost,  while  beneficiaries  are  expected  to\ncontribute  in  cash  or  kind  nearly  4  percent  of  project  costs  in  the  amount  of  $2.6  million.  The\n\n\f18\n\nremainder of about $3.6 million will be met by the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF)28 to\nfinance  the  credit  line  under  the  microenterprise  development  component  of  the  Project.  The\nproposed  ADB  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years  with  an\ninterest  charge  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter to be paid semiannually. The Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh.\nA  summary  of  the  proposed  Project  financing  plan  is  provided  in  Table 2  and  details  are\nprovided in Appendix 4.\n\nSource\n\nADB\nDanida\nPKSF\nBeneficiaries\nGovernment\n\nTotal\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\n  Local\nCurrency\n\n         8.3\n         2.7\n         0.0\n         0.0\n         0.0\n       11.0\n\n21.7\n12.3\n  3.6\n  2.6\n  9.1\n49.3\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n30.0\n15.0\n3.6\n2.6\n9.1\n60.3\n\nPercent\n\n50.0\n25.0\n6.0\n4.0\n15.0\n100.0\n\n51.\nThe  provision  of  financing  for  local  currency  cost  is  considered  justified  under  ADB\u2019s\nlocal currency financing policy. The Project includes upgrading of rural infrastructure, community\ndevelopment,  and  microenterprise  development,  which  have  high  proportions  of  local  cost\nitems.  This  is  especially  so  for  the  upgrading  of  rural  infrastructure  which  includes  significant\namounts  of  labor-intensive  construction  work.  In  addition,  because  a  low  level  of  per  capita\nincome  and  general  fiscal  difficulties  constrains  domestic  savings,  assistance  is  required  to\nmeet  the  local  currency  cost  of  some  development  projects.  Since  the  early  1990s,  the\nGovernment has been carrying out a comprehensive program of structural reforms to liberalize\nthe foreign trade and exchange rate regimes, restructure the industrial sector, strengthen fiscal\nand  monetary  management,  and  encourage  private  sector \ninvestment.  A  degree  of\nmacroeconomic  stability  has  been  achieved  and  maintained  by  conservative  economic\nmanagement.  Nonetheless,  the  pace  of  reforms  is  slow,  and  macroeconomic  stability  remains\nfragile.  The  floods  in  1998,  the  most  severe  in  over  a  century,  significantly  damaged\ninfrastructure  and  agriculture  lands,  and  negatively  affected  short-term  economic  growth  by\nwidening fiscal and current account deficits and increasing the rate of inflation. Last, ADB has\nsigned a partnership agreement with the Government for poverty reduction. Since this Project is\nclassified  as a poverty intervention,  ADB should support all Government efforts in this area of\nactivity  in  a  manner  that  is  fiscally  prudent.  With  these  considerations  and  the  overall  lack  of\ndomestic  budgetary  resources  in  the  sector,  ADB  assistance  for  local  currency  expenditures\nrelated to the Project is considered justified.\n\nE.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n52.\nThe  MCHTA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  overall\ncoordination  and  management  of  the  Project  at  the  national  level,  including  coordination  with\n\n                                                \n28    PKSF  is  an  apex  financial  institution  that  provides  collateral-free  funds  at  a  nominal  charge  to  organizations\n(primarily NGOs) for their microfinance program. PKSF\u2019s funding sources include the Government, bilateral and\nmultilateral agencies, and income from its own activities.\n\n\f19\n\nexternal  funding  and  Government  agencies;  (ii)  ensuring  timely  budgetary  allocations  to  the\nPMU  for  the  purposes  of  the  Project;  and  (iii)  ensuring  the  necessary  national-level  approvals\nare timely obtained for carrying out the Project.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Organization\n\nThe  CHTRC  will  be  the  lead  Implementing  Agency,  and  therefore  will  coordinate  and\n53.\nsupervise  overall  project  implementation,  including  overall  supervision  of  activities  carried  out\nunder  the  Project  by  the  HDCs,  LGED,  participating  NGOs,  and  PMU.  The  Project\u2019s\nimplementing  structure  will  be  based  in  the  CHT  to  help  ensure  the  Project  will  be  socially\nresponsive  to  the  ethnic  diversity  of  the  project  area.  This  proposal  is  consistent  with  the\nCHTRC\u2019s mandate, which was established under the peace accord and subsequently defined in\nthe  Regional  Council  Act  of  1998.  The  act  provides  for  the  CHTRC\u2019s  leadership  role  in\ncoordinating  community  development  activities  and  supervising  their  implementation.  The\nCHTRC  has  a  clear  mandate  to  provide  direction  for  the  work  of  all  other  local  development\nagencies including those in the nongovernment sector.\n\na.\n\nThe Project Management Unit\n\n54.\nTo  assist  the  CHTRC  in  implementation  and  management,  a  PMU  will  be  established\ndirectly  under  the  CHTRC  in  Rangamati  to  undertake  the  overall  implementation  and\nmanagement of project activities. The main responsibilities of the PMU will be to (i) select the\nrelevant consultants and NGOs to participate in implementation of the project components; (ii)\nsupervise,  monitor,  and  manage  consultants  and  NGOs;  (iii)  implement,  monitor,  and  review\nskill  development  and  training  activities;  (iv)  procure  equipment  and  vehicles  for  the  PMU,\nDPMUs, and the liaison office in Dhaka; (v) manage the relevant financial allocations; and (vi)\ncarry out the Project\u2019s reporting responsibilities. The PMU also will identify local policy issues to\nbe  resolved  by  the  regional  coordinating  committee,  and  identify  any  national  policy  and/or\nimplementation  issues  for  resolution  by  the  national  project  steering  committee  (NPSC)\n(paras. 65  and  66).  While  specifically  formed  to  manage  the  proposed  Project,  the  PMU  has\nbeen structured to provide a project management entity for future development initiatives.\n\n55.\nA  project  director  will  be  recruited  under  a  competitive  selection  process  to  direct  the\nPMU.  The  director  will  have  a  proven  track  record  in  successful  project  management  and\nadministration, and will be fully knowledgeable and sensitive to the ethnic diversity in the project\narea. A senior administration officer and a senior accountant will support the project director in\nthe  day-to-day  management  of  the  Project.  A  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer  will  be\nresponsible  for  recording  and  assessing  the  Project\u2019s  performance  and  its  impact.  Directly\nassisting  the  project  director  and  other  staff  will  be  a  team  of  international  and  national\nconsultants.  The  international  and  national  consultants  will  operate  under  the  direction  of  the\nproject director. The PMU\u2019s professional staff will be contracted for the duration of the Project,\nsubject  to  their  satisfactory  performance,  and  will  be  recruited  from  either  the  public  or,\npreferably, private sectors.\n\n56.\nThrough its consulting support, the PMU will be responsible for planning the training of\ntrainers  and  beneficiary  training  subcomponents.  For  the  training  of  trainers,  suitable  local\nconsulting  firms  or  NGOs  will  be  contracted  to  train  the  staff  of  local  NGOs,  participating\ngovernment  agencies,  traditional  leaders,  and  local  community  groups.  Under  the  PMU\u2019s\ndirection,  these  organizations,  agencies,  and  groups  will  train  beneficiaries  in  the  field.  A\n\n\f20\n\ndomestic  consultant  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  and  systems  will  be  recruited  to  provide\nproject  and  financial  management  support  to  the  PMU  during  the  first  two  years  of  project\nimplementation.    Additional  systems  training  and  support  will  be  provided  by  staff  of  ADB\u2019s\nBangladesh Resident Mission.\n\n57.\nThe project director will select staff for the three DPMUs and the project liaison office in\nDhaka. Each DPMU will be managed by a deputy project director, who will report to the project\ndirector  on  overall  project-related  activities  for  their  district,  and  will  also  report  to  the  district\ncouncil  chairperson  on  activities  under  the  community  development  component  of  the  Project.\nThe  deputy  directors  will  have  a  comprehensive  knowledge  of  the  district  and  its  ethnic\nstructure, and will have good communication skills and a proven ability to work with government\nand  nongovernment  agencies.  The  assistant  project  director  who  will  head  the  PMU  liaison\noffice (para. 48) will (i) have the proven ability to work effectively with government agencies; and\n(ii)  will  be  based  primarily  in  Dhaka,  but  may  be  required  to  travel  to  Rangamati  for  extended\nperiods of time to assist the PMU as necessary.\n\nDuring project implementation, an interactive process will be followed with beneficiaries.\n58.\nParticular  attention  will  be  given  to  ensure  that  tribal  and  women  beneficiaries  are  included  in\nthe process. For such a process to be meaningful, the quantitative component of the proposed\nactivities  should  be  regarded  as  indicative.  Annual  work  plans  will  be  developed  based  on\ndiscussion between the implementing agencies, project staff, and the communities, to establish\nlocal priorities and capture changes in community needs. These discussions are likely to lead to\ncomponent  targets  and  activities  being  changed,  and  may  result  in  a  need  to  reallocate\nresources  within  or  between  components.  Project  component  performance  and  achievements\nalso will be reviewed with beneficiaries in workshops at the end of each year.\n\nb.\n\nRural Infrastructure\n\nThe  Implementing  Agency  for  the  rural  infrastructure  component  will  be  LGED,  which\n59.\nhas  established  a  reputation  for  the  efficient  implementation  of  road  and  other  infrastructure\nprojects at the local community level. LGED has in place three fully equipped district offices, a\ncomprehensive  permanent  staffing  structure  in  every  CHT  subdistrict,  and  is  cognizant  of  the\nparticular  local  conditions  in  the  project  area.    However,  to  implement  a  project  component  of\nthis  size,  LGED  will  establish  a  specific  project  management  cell  headed  by  its  own  project\ndirector,  designed  to  facilitate  for  project  purposes,  the  use  of  LGED  machinery  and  quality\ncontrol resources and to provide supporting engineering services.  LGED\u2019s project management\ncell will work in close cooperation with the PMU and DPMUs.\n\n60.\nDanida  will  finance  the  rural  infrastructure  component  in  Khagrachari  District  using  the\nsame implementation arrangements as in the other districts.  The PMU will work closely with the\nDanida  implementation  team  to  ensure  that  the  agreed  targets  of  the  rural  infrastructure\ncomponent  are  achieved.    ADB  and  Danida  will  share  knowledge,  information,  and  lessons\nlearned during implementation, and conduct joint reviews.\n\nThe indicative rural infrastructure targets reflect discussions between LGED subdistrict-\n61.\nlevel  staff  and  affected  communities.  However,  to  establish  a  priority  ranking  of  proposed\nactivities and to accommodate any changes of community needs, LGED will conduct meetings\nin all proposed work areas prior to finalizing each year\u2019s work plan. The meetings will involve all\naffected groups and a full record of attendees and minutes of the meetings will be kept by LGED\nand copies sent to the relevant DPMUs. PMU staff may attend and participate in the meetings.\nAdditionally,  if  requested  by  the  CHTRC,  LGED  will  permit  a  representative  of  the  CHTRC  to\n\n\f21\n\nattend and participate in the meetings. LGED will advise the PMU on the results of the meetings\nand  their  impact  on  the  LGED  work  plan.  Follow-up  workshops  will  be  conducted  with  the\nparticipating communities at the end of each year, where the following year\u2019s work plan will be\ndiscussed  and  finalized.  The  PMU  and  consultants  will,  if  requested,  provide  assistance  to\nLGED in this interactive process.\n\nc.\n\nCommunity Development\n\nThe  three  HDCs  will  be  the  Implementing  Agencies  for  the  community  development\n62.\ncomponent.  Each  HDC  will  be  strengthened  with  a  project  office,  and  the  HDCs  will  use  their\nadministrative  links  at  the  subdistrict  level  through  the  subdistrict  executive  officer  to  assist  in\nthe  establishment  of  community  development  committees  (CDCs).  A  CDC  will  be  formed  for\neach union council of the CHT. The CDC membership will be made up from the union councils,\nthe traditional and other leaders of local tribal groups, local elite including school teachers and\ndoctors, and local organizations and households. Community development staff from the PMU\nand DPMUs, with the subdistrict executive officer and local NGOs contracted under the Project,\nwill  help  form  CDCs  and  ensure  that  they  represent  a  full  cross  section  of  the  local  ethnic\npopulation.\n\n63.\nLocal NGOs trained and engaged by the PMU under the Project will act as community\nfacilitators  to  provide  information  to  communities  about  the  Project  and  organize  community\ngroups among target beneficiaries.  With the community facilitators\u2019 assistance, the groups will\nprepare  subprojects  to  meet  identified  community  development  priorities.  The  CDCs  will  be\nresponsible  for  the  selection  of  subprojects,  their  implementation,  and  arrangements  for  the\nsubsequent maintenance and management of the investments. The subprojects will be financed\nfrom  the  CIF.  The  PMU  will  manage  the  CIF  and  DPMUs  will  be  responsible  for  validating\npayments for district subprojects. The payments will be executed by the PMU. Group formation,\nproposal formulation, community decision-making and management, representation of the local\nethnic  population  and  women,  and  community  contributions  will  be  key  aspects  for  monitoring\nand evaluation of the component\u2019s implementation.\n\nd.\n\nMicroenterprise Development\n\n64.\nThe  thrust  of  the  microenterprise  development  component  of  the  Project  will  be  on  (i)\nbuilding the capacity of a select number of local NGOs to enable them to provide efficient and\ncost-effective  microfinance  services,  and  (ii)  generating  income  and  savings  opportunities\namong  poor  project  beneficiaries.  The  main  target  population  for  these  services  will  be  poor\nrural  women  who  are  not  being  served  by  other  sources  of  rural  finance  for  asset  creation\nthrough  the  provision  of  credit  for  funding  small  on-  and  off-farm  enterprises  and  to  facilitate\nsavings generation among the target population. Lending will be provided under two models: the\ngroup-based approach and through savings and credit organizations (SCOs). The group-based\napproach  is  effective  in  areas  near  to  roads  and  highways  and  has  been  successfully\nimplemented  in  the  CHT.  SCOs  are  an  alternate  approach  under  which  SCO  members  are\ntrained to become responsible for the affairs of their organizations. This approach is popular in\nhilly  and  remote  areas  where  the  population  is  dispersed  and/or  accessibility  is  limited.  PKSF\nhas agreed in principle to provide a line of credit from its small NGO window to local NGOs that\nmeet  PKSF\u2019s  criteria  to  become  a  partner  organization.29  Based  on  an  analysis  of  demand  in\n\n                                                \n29  Borrowing from PKSF\u2019s Small NGO Window will be at a rate of 4.5-5.0 percent, with a repayment period of about\n\nthree years.\n\n\f22\n\nthe CHT, approximately 60,000 new members will be reached over the project period. Savings\ngeneration and other asset creation also will be important under the component.\n\n2. \n\nProject Coordination\n\n65.\nA NPSC will be established in Dhaka by the Government to be chaired by the Minister,\nor his/her designee, of MCHTA, with members from the CHTRC and ministries of finance; local\ngovernment;  rural  development  and  cooperatives;  LGED;  agriculture,  fisheries  and  livestock;\nwomen and children\u2019s affairs; environment and forests; and the planning commission, and will\ninclude  a  representative  of  the  CHT  circle  chiefs,  Danida,  and  the  project  director.  The  NPSC\nwill  provide  assistance  to  the  project  in  resolving  any  national  policy  and  implementing\nconstraints.  It  will  meet  semiannually  or  as  needed  and  minutes  of  each  meeting  will  be\nforwarded to ADB within two weeks of each meeting.\n\n66.\nA regional coordinating committee (RCC) will be established in Rangamati and chaired\nby the CHTRC chairman or his or her representative.  The RCC\u2019s membership will include the\nthree HDC chairmen, the project director, the three circle chiefs, LGED representatives, as well\nas  representatives  of  NGO  and  other  institutions  participating  in  the  Project,  and  Danida.  The\nRCC  will  review  annual  work  plans,  oversee  overall  progress  of  the  Project,  resolve  any\ndisputes between districts on project activities, play a role in communicating information about\nproject  activities  and  processes  to  stakeholders,  and  refer  any  major  interagency  problems  to\nthe NPSC. The RCC will meet bimonthly during the first year of the Project and on a quarterly\nbasis  thereafter.    RCC  minutes  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB  within  two  weeks  of  each  meeting.\nThe project organization chart is in Appendix 5.\n\n3.\n\nProject Implementation Schedule\n\n67.\nThe  project  implementation  period  will  be  seven  years,  commencing  in  April  2001  and\nending in March 2008 (Appendix 6).  The first year activities will include (i) establishment of the\nProject\u2019s  imprest  account,  (ii)  a  series  of  rapid  appraisals  to  verify  previously  identified  needs,\n(iii)  development  of  the  annual  work  plan  for  the  first  year  of  project  implementation,  (iv)\ncontracting of NGOs to be involved in service delivery, (v) preparation and possible launching of\na  project  public  information  program,  (vi)  procurement  action  for  civil  works  contracts,  (vii)\nprocurement of requisite equipment and vehicles, (viii) recruitment of consultants and remaining\nproject  staff,  and  (ix)  establishment  of  a  project  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)\nsystem.\n\n4.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n68.\nThe  LGED  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  O&M  of  upgraded  roads,  bridges,  and\nculverts  financed  under  the  Project  and  has  given  assurances  that  sufficient  funds  would  be\nallocated to its Rural Infrastructure Maintenance Fund to cover maintenance costs.  The LGED\nhas assured ADB that, if available, additional resources will also be provided through the Rural\nMaintenance Program (supported by the World Food Programme), and disadvantaged/destitute\nwomen  will  be  employed  for  O&M  activities.  O&M  costs  of  small  markets  financed  under  the\ncommunity  development  component  of  the  Project  will  be  met  by  union  councils  using  a  fixed\nproportion of the proceeds of market stall leases specifically set aside for this purpose. O&M of\nproject  facilities  to  be  constructed  under  the  community  development  component  will  be  the\nresponsibility of the community, with financial support from local government.\n\n\f23\n\n5.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n69.\nThe  Project  outputs  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  in  terms  of  quality  and  quantity.\nBME will generate data on the immediate effects and the broader impacts of project investments\non  socioeconomic  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  the  empowerment  of  women.\nBenchmark data has been collected as part of project formulation, and the need for additional\nbenchmark  data  will  be  decided  on  at  the  first  six-month  review  of  project  progress.  BME  will\ncomprise the following main elements:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  direct  effects  of  rural  infrastructure  improvement  will  be  monitored  to\nestimate  the  actual  economic  benefits  from  reductions  in  transport  charges,\nincreases  in  traffic  flows,  changes  in  transport  modes,  changes  in  turnover  of\nbusinesses  served  by  upgraded  infrastructure,  and  changes  in  market  lease\nvalues.  The  impact  of  road  construction  on  induced  agricultural  production  and\nother  economic  activities  will  be  assessed.  As  part  of  the  establishment  of  a\nplanned maintenance process, regular traffic counts (twice a year) will be carried\nout  by  LGED  on  all  improved  roads,  while  union  councils  will  provide  annual\nreturns on changes in market use and lease values.\n\nThe effects of the Project on poverty will be monitored through collection of time-\nseries  data  on  employment  created  and  the  characteristics  of  the  persons\nemployed, use of markets by poor women for trading, and increases in numbers\nof microenterprises in the vicinity of project investments. In addition, participatory\nrapid appraisals will be carried out at sample locations to assess the perceptions\nof different categories of poor people within the vicinity of project investments on\nwhether and how they have benefited.\n\n(iii) \n\nThe  effects  of  project  measures  to  increase  beneficiary  participation  and  to\nincrease institutional capability of local government bodies will be monitored. The\nproject  framework  defines  the  key  indicators  that  will  be  used  to  monitor  the\nperformance of the Project in achieving its objectives.\n\n6.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\nGoods and services will be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement\n70.\nunder  Asian  Development  Bank  Loans.  The  civil  works  related  to  the  rural  infrastructure\ncomponent of the Project to be financed by ADB, including civil works for the improvement and\nupgrading  of  feeder  roads  type  B  and  rural  roads,  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  local\ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB.  Given the small and scattered nature of the\ncivil works, they are unlikely to attract international contractors.  In addition, the local capacity to\nundertake such works is adequate. Contractors for inclusion in a roster for the civil works will be\nprequalified by LGED at the start of the Project and updated regularly. Vehicles, machinery, and\noffice  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  international  shopping  procedures\nbecause  the  amounts  involved  will  not  exceed  $500,000  for  each  package.  Equipment\npackages estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent, and for which there are several local\nsuppliers  with  satisfactory  service  facilities,  may  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures.  Where  the  number  of  suppliers  is  limited,  procurement  may  be  made  by  direct\nfor  procurement  will  be  determined  during  project\npurchase.  Details  of  packages \nimplementation.  An  indicative  list  of  equipment  and  vehicles  to  be  procured  is  set  out  in\nAppendix  7.    Civil  works  to  be  financed  under  the  community  development  component  will  be\n\n\f24\n\ncarried out by local contractors identified and recruited by community development committees,\nwith  assistance  of  local  NGOs  and  project  staff.    These  civil  works  are  very  small,  and\ncommunity  participation  will  increase  the  use  of  local  abilities  and  materials,  and  contribute  to\nthe sustainability of the Project.\n\n7.\n\nConsulting Services and Training\n\n71.\nA  total  of  112  person-months  of  international  and  232  person-months  of  domestic\nconsultants  from  suitably  qualified  consulting  firms  will  be  required  for  project  implementation\n(Appendix 8).  International expertise will be required in rural development, engineering quality\ncontrol,  and  institutional  development.  Domestic  expertise  will  be  required  in  community\ndevelopment, specialty training, gender and development, communications development, legal\ncontracts  preparation,  BME  systems  development,  legal  literacy,  and  project  management\nsupport.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants.  The  Project  also  will  contract  out  services  to  local  NGOs  to  help  implement  the\ncommunity development and microfinance project components.\n\n72.\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  support  capacity  building  and  skill  development  of  local\ngovernment  and  NGOs,  CDCs  and  the  target  beneficiaries,  particularly  the  local  ethnic\npopulation  and  women.    The  Project  will  fund  an  extensive  program  of  skill  development  and\ntraining  throughout  the  project  period.    The  training  program  will  have  two  parts:  training  of\ntrainers and training of beneficiaries. Domestic consulting firms and/or NGOs will be expected to\nprovide  this  first  tier  of  training,  and  the  PMU  together  with  the  project\u2019s  training  specialist  will\nidentify suitable agencies to participate in this activity. Local NGOs are likely to be the principal\nagencies  to  receive  this  type  of  training,  along  with  CDCs,  union  council  members,  and\ntraditional leaders. Training courses will be primarily undertaken in technical subjects most likely\nto help generate income for the target population.  Indicative technical courses include sloping\nagricultural  lands  technology  (SALT),  horticulture  development,  social  forestry,  fishpond\nproduction,  livestock  development,  sericulture,  agro-processing,  and  home  craft  production.  A\nrange of supporting management courses will include, at a minimum project implementation and\nmanagement, business development and management, produce marketing and promotion, and\nenvironmental  management.  Training  will  be  identified  and  provided  to  beneficiaries  in  the\ncommunity  and  village  areas  by  agencies  such  as  the  Bangladesh  Agricultural  Research\nInstitute  (BARI)  and  the  Department  of  Agriculture  Extension.  Courses  will  be  designed  to  (i)\nenable  beneficiaries  to  undertake  successful  income  generating  activities,  and  (ii)  fit  in  with\nlivelihood commitments.  Graduates of the training of trainers\u2019 activity will undertake beneficiary\ntraining.\n\n73.\nUnder the Project's training activities, NGOs and a select number of community leaders\nwill  be  trained  to  provide  participatory  training  programs  for  local  communities  to  be  educated\nabout  the  law,  government  services,  and  legal  processes.    The  goal  of  such  training  is  to\nprovide local communities with basic awareness of law and concept of rights.  The Project will\nuse the strategies for the delivery of legal literacy developed under ADB's TA 5856: Technical\nAssistance for Legal Literacy for Supporting Governance (footnote 21). An ADB project will be\nselected to pilot-test the strategies developed under TA 5856. If the Project is selected to pilot-\ntest  the  strategies  under  TA  5856,  the  Project  will  benefit  from  the  additional  inputs  of\nconsultants under TA 5856. In such case, the training in legal literacy under this Project will be\ncarried out in coordination with the activities under TA 5856.\n\n\f25\n\n8. \n\nAdvance Action\n\n74.\nADB  has  approved  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants  and  the\nprocurement  of  equipment  and  vehicles  to  facilitate  the  timely  implementation  of  the  Project.\nThe Government has been informed that the approval of advance action does not commit ADB\nto approve or finance the Project, and does not include retroactive financing.  The Government\nhas requested, and ADB agreed, that ADB will assist the Government to carry out the advance\naction for the recruitment of consultants.\n\n9.\n\nReporting, Accounts, and Audits\n\n75.\nProgress monitoring will focus on the use of inputs; the participatory process, including\nthe  participation  of  the  local  ethnic  population  and  women;  the  progress  of  activities;  and  the\nachievement of outputs. The Project will be monitored through regular reporting and review. The\nPMU  and  DPMUs,  in  consultation  with  the  Implementing  Agencies,  will  produce  annual  work\nplans  setting  out  the  activities  scheduled  for  the  forthcoming  year,  their  timing,  the  inputs\nrequired and the outputs expected to be achieved. The Implementing Agencies will provide the\nPMU with brief quarterly progress reports during each year of project implementation, detailing\nthe physical and financial progress of activities against the targets set in the work plans. In turn\nthe PMU, through the CHTRC, will furnish to the Government and ADB consolidated quarterly\nprogress reports and a comprehensive year end annual report including the progress of BME.\n\n76.\nDuring  the  first  two  years  of  the  Project,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual  monitoring\nreviews.  Initial reviews will (i) determine whether all the proposed implementation arrangements\nare  in  place,  (ii)  assess  the  progress  of  physical  works,  (iii)  critically  review  the  arrangements\nfor,  and  results  of,  the  beneficiary  participation  process,  and  (iv)  review  the  outcome  of  the\ncapacity  building  and  training  programs.  Comprehensive  project  reviews  will  be  jointly\nundertaken by ADB, Danida, and the Government at the end of years 2 and 4 to evaluate the\nactual physical and financial progress of the Project, implementation procedures, procurement\nperformance, BME activities, PMU effectiveness, and performance of consultants.  Prior to the\ncomprehensive  reviews,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a  comprehensive  report  identifying  issues  in\npreparation for the reviews. On the basis of the results of these comprehensive reviews, ADB,\nDanida,  and  the  Government  may  consider  changes  in  project  design  and  implementation\narrangements.    Within  three  months  of  project  completion,  the  PMU  through  the  CHTRC  will\nprepare a project completion report in the standard ADB format, for submission to ADB.\n\nThe  PMU  will  maintain  separate  ledgers,  records,  and  accounts  of  expenditures  and\n77.\nloan  disbursements  under  the  Project.    The  PMU  will  install  an  accounting  system  consistent\nwith  generally  acceptable  accounting  principles  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  project  director  will\nprepare an annual financial report on the Project\u2019s accounts and submit these to the MCHTA.\nThe  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  an  independent  external  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.\nThe imprest account and statement of expenditures (SOEs) procedure will be audited as part of\nthe  regular  audit  of  the  Project\u2019s  account  and  financial  statements  and  audit  opinion  on  the\nimprest  account  and  SOEs  will  be  set  out  separately.  The  audited  project  accounts  will  be\nforwarded to ADB not later than six months after the close of each fiscal year.\n\n10.\n\nImprest Account and Statement of Expenditures Procedures\n\nTo  ensure  effective  project  implementation  and  timely  disbursement  of  the  loan,  the\n78.\nGovernment  will  establish  an  imprest  account  in  dollars  in  the  name  of  the  Project  at  the\nBangladesh Bank or at a commercial bank acceptable to Bangladesh Bank and ADB. A second-\n\n\f26\n\ngeneration imprest account (SGIA) also will be established at a commercial bank in the CHT to\nreceive funds from the imprest account to meet project expenditures incurred by the PMU and\nDPMUs. The project director will manage the imprest account (Appendix 9). The initial amount\nto be deposited into the imprest account will not exceed the equivalent of $500,000 based on an\nestimate of expenditure in the first six months of project implementation. ADB\u2019s SOE procedure\nwill  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the\nImprest  Account.  The  SOE  procedure  will  be  applicable  to  contracts  not  exceeding  the\nequivalent  of  $100,000  and  individual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $50,000  to\nconform to ADB\u2019s simplified procedure on procurement and disbursement. The imprest account\nwill be established and maintained in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook dated\nJune 1996 and detailed arrangements between ADB and the Government.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Measures\n\nThe  Project  has  been  classified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Category  B,  and  an  initial\n79.\nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Environmental\nAssessment Requirements and Environmental Review Procedures. The selection criteria under\neach  project  component  were  established,  specifying  exclusion  of  any  sites  of  ecological,\narchaeological, or historic importance. Although the Project will cover a wide geographical area\nand involve interventions in several sectors, there will be no major impacts, owing largely to the\nsmall scale of the investments, and the low technology and the low intensity of the construction\nworks.  The  IEE  finds  that  the  Project  will  not  create  any  significant  changes  in  the  social,\nphysical, or biological environment.\n\n80.\nThe potential impacts of two of the three major components of the Project are primarily\nconstruction related. The type of road construction will be either rehabilitation or improvement of\nexisting alignments and will fall within the existing road reserves. Little if any land acquisition is\nexpected. Mitigation measures to be taken to address any potentially minor adverse impacts in\nroad construction and rehabilitation have been detailed in the monitoring plan of the IEE. Small-\nscale  construction  under  the  community  development  component  will  have  no  significant\nadverse  impacts  and  the  communities,  through  the  CDCs,  will  select  sites.  The  small-scale\nimproved water management structures and water supplies will be selected in a similar fashion\nand  will  serve  to  make  the  best  use  of  the  natural  run-off  into  the  lake  and  the  scarce  inland\ngroundwater resources. Microenterprises developed by the Project through credit provision will\nalso have no significant adverse impacts. Several enterprises (e.g., social forestry, sloping lands\nagriculture  development,  and  horticultural  development)  should,  however,  enhance  watershed\nmanagement and reduce natural soil erosion.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Measures\n\n81.\nAn initial social assessment carried out for ADB during project identification showed that\nthe rural population in the CHT was likely to be among the poorest in Bangladesh. To confirm\nthis finding and establish data and key indicators on ethnic composition, land-use patterns and\nownership, health, education, employment, gender issues, and social structures, a benchmark\nand socioeconomic survey was carried out during project preparation. The survey covered 619\nhouseholds  in  12  villages  or  communities  in  all  three  CHT  districts.  The  surveyed  households\nrepresented all ethnic groups and were proportional to the ethnic composition of the total CHT\npopulation.  The  data  collected  was  similar  to  that  from  other  area  surveys  carried  out  since\n1997  and  the  results  indicate  the  conditions  prevailing  throughout  the  rural  areas  in  the  CHT.\n\n\f27\n\nFollowing the survey, 12 participatory rural appraisals were carried out in similar communities in\nthe  three  CHT  districts.  The  appraisals  involved  399  people  from  a  wide  cross-section  of\noccupations within the communities.\n\nAbout  70  percent  of  the  surveyed  families  had  incomes  below  the  government\u2019s  food\n82.\npoverty  level,  placing  them  in  the  poorest  of  the  poor  category.  Similar  levels  of  poverty  were\nfound across all ethnic groups. Agriculture was the main occupation, but many families had no\naccess  to  good  quality  flat  land  and  were  obliged  to  farm  on  the  less  fertile  hilly  land  using\nshifting cultivation techniques. Crop yields were low and off-farm labor earnings supplemented\nagricultural income. Low child education levels and a high incidence of malaria and waterborne\ndiseases  were  common.  The  overall  situation  is  one  of  extreme  poverty  where  many  families\nwho  were  displaced  by  the  insurgency  have  yet  to  rebuild  their  livelihoods.  The  rehabilitation\nand reconstruction of infrastructure in rural areas has been slow and in most communities little\nhas changed since signing of the peace accord.\n\n83.\nThe Project has been designed to have a measurable impact on reducing poverty in the\nrural  areas  through  providing  improved  rural  infrastructure,  community  facilities,  and  new\nincome generating opportunities. The Project is expected to reach about 52,000 families (about\n40  percent  of  rural  families)  and  will  use  a  participatory  process  where  beneficiaries  will  form\npart  of  all  planning  and  implementing  activities.  This  process  and  the  potential  project\ncomponents  were  discussed  at  three  project  formulation  workshops  with  prospective  project\nbeneficiaries and likely Implementing Agencies. The workshops produced an agreed consensus\non the project approach.\n\n3. \n\nGender Analysis\n\n84.\nThe gender analysis in the benchmark and socioeconomic survey showed that women\nare disadvantaged in terms of financial opportunities and participation in community leadership.\nFor  households  headed  by  women  (about  20  percent  of  surveyed  households),  the  problems\nare more severe and their low social status excludes them from most community activities. The\nsurvey found that women generally are fully responsible for the household work program and its\nfinancial management. They also participate in agricultural tasks and are usually responsible for\nhomestead  enterprises,  which  may  include  livestock  rearing  and  intensive  fruit  and  vegetable\ncultivation.  However,  until  the  recent  introduction  of  NGO  credit  programs,  women  have  had\ngreat difficulty in obtaining loans to develop their own microenterprises. This problem appears to\nbe inherent in the traditional banking services and is the principal reason for the emergence and\nsuccess of NGOs among women.\n\n85.\nFrom  discussions  held  during  the  survey  and  in  the  follow-up  participatory  rapid  rural\nappraisals, women considered that the development priorities should be the provision of more\nreliable and cleaner water supplies, and better road and trail access to schools, health centers,\nand  markets.  The  majority  of  women  indicated  that  they  would  take  advantage  of  income\ngenerating programs, especially those that provided support for enterprises that were managed\nfrom  the  homestead.  They  identified  enterprises  such  as  poultry,  goat,  and  other  livestock\nrearing  and  sericulture  as  suiting  their  existing  activities.  Given  the  opportunity,  women  stated\nthat  they  would  participate  in  community  decision-making  through  membership  in  local\norganizations and committees.\n\nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  respond  to  these  needs  by  improving  rural\n86.\ncommunication, which will provide for better access to education and health facilities, and small-\nscale  community  infrastructure  projects,  which  improve  village  water  supplies  and  other\n\n\f28\n\ncommunity facilities. Women will also be brought into the community decision-making process\nthrough  membership  in  CDCs.  In  addition,  they  will  be  encouraged  to  expand  their  income-\ngenerating  activities,  many  of  which  can  be  carried  out  in  the  home,  through  membership  in\ngroup-based savings and credit schemes.\n\n4. \n\nIndigenous Peoples Development Plan\n\n87.\nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples does  not  state  that  all  ethnic  minorities  are  to  be\ntreated  as  indigenous  people,  but  it  does  relate  the  concept  of  indigenous  peoples  to  ethnic\nminorities, among others. An indigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) is necessary for this\nProject,  because  (i)  slightly  over  one-half  of  the  population  of  the  project  area  is  made  up  of\nethnic  minority  groups;  and  (ii)  while  there  is  significant  diversity  among  the  groups,  there  are\ntraditional  patterns  of  resource  use  and  social  organization  that  are  distinct  from  the\nmainstream.  The  IPDP  provides  a  framework  for  the  full  participation  of  all  ethnic  minority\ngroups in the detailed planning and implementation of the Project and these mechanisms have\nbeen developed through extensive consultations with the communities and their representatives\nin the Project area.  The main aims of the IPDP are to (i) improve the living conditions of all the\nethnic  minority  groups  by  improving  the  rural  communication  network,  which  will  give  better\naccess to education, health, and trading centers and decrease the costs of transportation and\nconsumables; (ii) create job opportunities in construction and road development works for those\ngroups; (iii) offer skill development and credit to develop income generating microenterprises in\nthe  remote  areas;  and  (iv)  facilitate  empowerment  of  the  ethnic  minority  communities  through\nstrengthening their participation in local development activities.\n\nThe objectives of the IPDP have been incorporated into the Project\u2019s detailed planning\n88.\nand  implementation  framework  and  these  will  be  addressed  through  (i)  comprehensive\nconsultations with the involved individual communities and villages, which will be a precursor to\nthe  development  of  each  annual  plan  for  the  rural  infrastructure  component;  (ii)  the  CDCs\nformed under the Project to identify, implement, and manage small-scale infrastructure projects\nhaving  all  local  ethnic  minority  groups  represented  in  their  membership;  (iii)  where  possible,\nlocal NGOs representing specific ethnic minority groups carrying out the skill development and\ntraining activities in their tribal groups; (iv) local indigenous NGOs being employed to work with\nthe NGO credit providers; and (v) where roads are upgraded in a particular area, ethnic minority\ngroups  in  that  area  being  given  priority  for  job  opportunities  associated  with  the  construction.\nThe  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  BME  of  the  IPDP.  The  data  gathered  during  the  benchmark\nand  socioeconomic  survey  on  each  of  the  ethnic  minority  groups  will  be  used  as  base  line\nindicators to monitor the Project\u2019s impact on each group.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis\n\n1. \n\nIntroduction\n\nReviews  of  projects  in  Bangladesh  in  which  there  have  been  a  significant  road\n89.\nimprovement  component  have  identified  three  main  direct  benefits:  (i)  a  reduction  in  goods\ntransport costs of up to 40 percent as a result of reduced vehicle operating costs, (ii) a similar\nreduction in public transport fares, and (iii) a reduction in travel time. Savings in transport costs\nhave  in  turn  lead  to  lower  farm  inputs  and  an  improvement  in  product  prices,  which  have\ntogether  resulted  in  an  increase  in  agricultural  production.  In  some  areas,  a  change  to  more\nintensive  forms  of  land  use  has  occurred.    In  the  nonfarm  sectors,  economic  activity  has  also\n\n\f29\n\nincreased  as  a  direct  result  of  road  improvement.  These  activities  have  included  a  range  of\nservice enterprises (vehicle repair, for example), the supply of transport equipment reflecting a\nchange from nonmotorized to motorized modes of transport and small enterprise development\nsupported by a growth in NGO-managed microfinance institutions.\n\n90. While similar outcomes from investment in road improvement could be expected in the\nCHT, there are some important differences from the plains areas where most of the recent road\nbuilding  activity  in  Bangladesh  has  occurred.  First,  the  CHT  has  many  steep-sided  valleys\nthrough  which  roads  must  pass.    As  a  result,  the  area  of  good  quality  agricultural  land,  which\ncan be influenced per unit of road, is quite small. In the Third Rural Infrastructure Development\nProject  (footnote  27),  for  example,  areas  of  influence  per  km  of  road  ranging  from  900  ha  to\nover 1,400 ha are quoted while comparable figures for the CHT as assessed during field work\nare  typically  30-50  ha/km.  Second,  there  are  serious  constraints  to  expanded  agricultural\nproduction (para. 12). Furthermore, uncertain land tenure arrangements together with restrictive\nlegislative  provisions  covering  forestry  are  likely  to  constrain  the  development  of  tree  crops,\nwhich could add significantly to the effective command area of new roads (Appendix 10).\n\n2.\n\nBeneficiaries\n\n91.\nAt full development, the Project will directly benefit about 52,000 households comprising\nabout  338,000  people.  Incremental  household  incomes  have  been  estimated  at  Tk300  for\ntransport  cost  savings  only,  Tk6,400  for  transport  cost  savings  together  with  intensified  crop\nproduction,  Tk3,200  for  egg  production,  Tk8,600  for  poultry  production,  and  Tk4,200  for  pig\nfattening.  The  intensified  crop  production  and  livestock  increments  are  very  significant  when\ncompared  with  typical  current  household  incomes  of  between  Tk20,000  and  Tk30,000  per\nannum  and  should  provide  a  strong  incentive  for  beneficiary  participation.  As  the  livestock\nenterprises can be scaled to suit a range of labor and credit situations, and require limited land\nresources, landless households will have the opportunity to participate in these enterprises.\n\n3. \n\nQuantifiable Benefits\n\n92.\nThe  principle  quantifiable  outputs  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  increased  agricultural\nproduction  (mainly  rice,  vegetables,  and  spices)  resulting  from  more  intensive  input  use  and\nimproved  access  to  supporting  services  such  as  credit  and  technical  services;  (ii)  household\nsavings on agricultural transport costs resulting from improved roads and market facilities; and\n(iii)  increased  livestock  production  (eggs,  chickens,  and  pigs)  arising  from  improved  access  to\nmarkets, credit, and technical services. Annual incremental crop and livestock production at full\ndevelopment is estimated at 4,560 tons (t) of unhulled rice, 2,340 t of potatoes, 68 t of ginger,\n6.16 million eggs, 1.80 million chickens, and 14,250 fattened pigs. At full development, the net\nfinancial  value  of  incremental  crop  and  livestock  production  is  estimated  at  Tk234.64  million\n($4.60  million).  For  beneficiaries  who  do  not  intensify  output,  transport  cost  savings  from\nagricultural activities are estimated at Tk5.14 million ($100,000).\n\n4. \n\nNonquantifiable Benefits\n\n93.\nThe Project will generate a wide range of nonquantifiable benefits. These will include (i)\na saving in travel time, particularly for those currently using nonmotorized means of transport on\nearth  surfaced  tracks;  (ii)  improved  delivery  of  development  services  such  as  health  and\neducation;  (iii)  a  reduction  in  consumer  goods  prices  (apart  from  agricultural  inputs)  resulting\nfrom  reductions  in  transport  costs;  (iv)  reduced  spoilage  in  markets  and  easier  access  to\nmarkets;  and  (v)  an  improvement  in  the  general  business  environment  engendered  by  more\n\n\f30\n\nreliable  and  cheaper  transport  services  and  improved  access  to  microfinance  services.\nFurthermore,  the  small-scale  subprojects  to  be  implemented  by  communities  are  expected  to\nproduce  a  wide  range  of  benefits.  These  will  include  improved  access  to  safe  water  supplies,\ncommunity  meeting  places  perhaps  lit  with  small-scale  solar  electricity  systems,  upgraded\naccess  tracks  within  villages,  jetties,  and  school  rooms.  Community  mobilization  activities  by\ncontracted  NGOs  will  have  long-term  benefits  in  improved  community  decision  making\nprocesses and empowerment, and improved implementation and management capacity. At the\ninstitutional level, staff of the CHTRC and HDCs, as well as members of the union councils, will\nhave  the  opportunity  to  work  closely  with  project  management  staff.  This  will  provide  an\nopportunity for them to upgrade their skills in project design and implementation, which will be\nrelevant to their work in the CHT as a whole. Finally, NGO capacity-building under the Project\nwill assist locally-based NGOs to improve their ability to deliver services to the wider community.\n\n5. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n94.\nThe economic evaluation draws together the investment costs of the Project (excluding\nthose for which benefits have not been estimated) during a seven-year implementation period,\nplus the recurrent costs needed to ensure sustainable benefits. These costs are then compared\nwith  the  estimated  direct  benefits,  over  a  30-year  period.  As  the  analysis  is  expressed  in\neconomic  prices  at  domestic  price  levels,  tradable  components  have  been  adjusted  by  a\nshadow exchange rate factor of 1.10 to convert them to the domestic price level. The main final\nincremental  outputs  of  the  Project  as  evaluated  are  crops  (primarily  rice  and  vegetables)  and\nlivestock  products  (eggs,  chickens,  and  fattened  pigs).  In  addition,  transport  cost  savings  for\nbeneficiaries who do not intensify production or adopt new livestock enterprises are included in\nthe  economic  flows.  Given  the  interdependence  of  the  rural  infrastructure  and  agricultural\nproduction  activities,  separate  evaluations  of  the  various  components  of  the  Project  have  not\nbeen attempted.\n\nAs benefits from the community development component have not been assessed, the\n95.\ncost of this component has been excluded from the economic evaluation. Project management\ncosts, estimated at 30 percent of the total, have also been excluded. These costs are assessed\nas being directly related to the implementation of the community development component and\nmore  general  capacity  building.  All  rural  infrastructure  investment  costs  have  been  included.\nEighty  percent  of  the  value  of  the  proposed  credit  line  has  been  excluded,  as  the  costs  that\nwould be financed by term loans from this proportion of the credit line are included in the various\nlivestock enterprise models that form part of the Project economic flows.\n\n96.\nFor the base case, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is estimated\nat 11.9 percent. While this rate is below the assumed opportunity cost of capital (12 percent), it\nis  judged  to  be  acceptable  when  the  nonquantifiable  benefits  are  taken  into  consideration.\nSensitivity tests show that if road construction costs rise by 10 percent, the EIRR falls to 10.7\npercent. If the area of land on which more intensive production technology is used and falls from\n30 percent of the total in the area of influence, as assumed in the base case, to 20 percent, the\nEIRR falls to 10.6 percent. The EIRR is also sensitive to changes in assumptions about the area\nof land influenced by each km of road. If this falls by 10 percent, the EIRR falls to 11.5 percent.\nIn  the  unlikely  event  that  both  the  prices  of  eggs  and  chickens  fall  by  10  percent,  the  EIRR\nwould fall to 10.6 percent.\n\n\f31\n\n6. \n\nSubsidy and Recurrent Budget Implications of the Project\n\n97.\nApart from grants to be made under the community development component, there will\nbe no direct subsidies paid by the Project. Beneficiaries will, however, continue to draw on the\nfree advisory services currently provided by government agencies in the area. The interest rates\nfor  loans  to  be  made  under  the  microenterprise  development  component  are  expected  to  at\nleast cover the incremental lending costs of NGOs, including provisioning. O&M costs of small\nmarkets  that  may  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  met  by  union  councils  using  a  fixed\nproportion  of  the  proceeds  of  market  stall  leases  specifically  set  aside  for  this  purpose.  O&M\ncosts  of  facilities  to  be  constructed  under  the  community  development  component  will  be  the\nresponsibility  of  the  communities  and  community  organizations  established  under  the  Project.\nRecurrent government budget costs extending beyond the seven-year project investment period\nare limited to road maintenance.\n\n7. \n\nProject Risks\n\n98.\nDue  to  the  limited  development  activity  in  the  CHT  during  the  insurgency,  the  capacity\nfor  project  design  and  implementation  is  limited  (Appendix  11).  New  institutions  were  created\nout  of  the  peace  accord,  and  empowered  to  take  a  lead  role  in  development  activities  in  the\nCHT. A local indigenous NGO movement has developed approximately seven NGOs that, with\ncapacity  building  support,  could  participate  in  project  activities.  To  minimize  the  risk  that\ninstitutional  weakness  could  seriously  affect  project  implementation,  the  following  specific\ninterventions  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design:  (i)  recruitment  of  a  domestic\nconsultant  knowledgeable  in  ADB  systems  and  procedures  to  provide  project  management\nsupport to the MCHTA and the PMU; (ii) project management and local implementation staff will\nbe  supported  by  domestic  and  international  consultants  with  expertise  in  community\ndevelopment,  training,  gender  issues,  engineering  quality  control,  institutional  development,\ncommunications, legal services, and BME; (iii) institutional strengthening for local NGOs to build\nup  their  capacity;  (iv)  national  NGOs  that  can  provide  a  mix  of  services  to  facilitate  effective\nimplementation of the Project; (v) only a limited amount of infrastructure is proposed for the first\nyear; and (vi) training of trainers will start in the first year.\n\n99.\nAlthough land ownership issues were key elements in the recent insurgency in the CHT,\ndecisive  action  is  not  being  taken  to  address  these  concerns.  Inaction  on  a  proposed  land\nsurvey is delaying the preparation of a new voting list of land owners, which is required before\nelections  for  HDCs  (and  indirectly  the  composition  of  the  CHTRC)  can  take  place.  The\nimplications  of  a  delayed  survey  and  voting  list  will  be  a  continued  suspicion  of  Government\nintentions toward tribal development and a significant risk that the more radical tribal elements\nmay return to armed conflict to achieve what they consider are their social and economic rights.\nAssurances have been sought that the Government remains committed to the land ownership\nand disputes resolution provisions of the peace accord.\n\n100. Participatory  processes  are  an  important  element  in  the  selection  and  prioritization  of\nmany  project  activities.  These  procedures  may  be  new  to  government  institutions  in  the  CHT\nand a more prescriptive approach could easily eventuate. To provide an appropriate overview to\nthis process, ADB and the Government must carry out reviews every six months for at least the\nfirst  two  years  of  the  Project,  with  more  in-depth  reviews  at  the  end  of  the  second  and  fourth\nyears of the Project. These reviews, and compliance with all ADB procedures and policies are\nkey to ensuring that the Project is successful.  Given that the CHT has only recently emerged\nfrom a 20 year insurgency (paras. 3-6), that the CHTRC and HDCs are new organizations, and\n\n\f32\n\nthat  participatory  processes  are  critical  to  progress  in  the  CHT  generally  and  to  the  Project  in\nparticular,  compliance  with  ADB  procedures  and  policies  must  be  accompanied  by  efforts  to\nensure  transparency  and  accessibility  to  information  by  all  of  the  project  beneficiaries.  This\nProject  will  incorporate  lessons  offered  from  the  Samut  Prakarn  Wastewater  Management\nProject,30 and will include the establishment of a project web site as a tool by which to manage\nthe  demand  for  information  on  the  Project.  The  web  site  will  contain  relevant  documentation,\nsuch  as  this  report,  and  will  be  regularly  updated.  In  addition,  an  interdepartmental  task  force\n(headed  by  ADB\u2019s  Agriculture  and  Social  Sectors  Department  [West],  and  including  Programs\nDepartment  [West],  Office  of  the  General  Counsel,  and  Office  of  External  Relations)  will  be\nformed  to  ensure  that  implementation  and  comprehensive  ADB  monitoring  and  review  of  the\nProject are carried out in accordance with the project design and ADB procedures and policies.\nThe  task  force  also  will  be  responsible  for  addressing  any  queries  from  the  public  and  from\nNGOs.\n\n101. Many of the roads to be constructed under the Project will pass through difficult terrain or\nwill  be  subject  to  local  flooding  and  will  have  a  high  maintenance  requirement.  Overall,  a\nsignificant  increase  in  the  annual  road  maintenance  budget  for  the  CHT  will  be  required  for\nthese and other project-financed roads to be maintained satisfactorily. Part of the maintenance\nwork  will  be  carried  out  by  labor  contracting  societies,  which  will  need  to  be  formed  for  this\nspecific purpose. The Government has assured ADB that appropriate allocations will be made\nfor  road  maintenance.  The  Project  will  help  communities  form  and  operate  labor  contracting\nsocieties.  Annual  work  planning  under  the  infrastructure  component  will  take  into  account\nGovernment (national and local) resources available for O&M.\n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n102.\nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  address  some  of  the  critical  development  needs\nidentified by communities during participatory meetings and the needs assessment survey. Most\nsurveyed families had incomes below the Government\u2019s food poverty line, placing them in the\ncategory of the poorest of the poor. Project interventions to help raise incomes include credit for\nmicroenterprise development, training in a range of enterprise types, and provision of technical\nservices.  Investments  in  rural  infrastructure  are  expected  to  lead  to  lower  transport  costs,\nimproved  access  to  markets  and  government  services,  and  growth  of  small  businesses  within\nthe  CHT.  Women  will  benefit  from  a  number  of  targeted  interventions.  Poultry  raising  will\nprovide  an  opportunity  for  income  generation,  both  for  those  with  access  to  land  and  for  the\nlandless. Women are priority borrowers in most NGO credit programs.\n\nC. \n\nProject Impact on Poverty\n\n103. Poverty  reduction  remains  the  overriding  priority  in  Bangladesh.    In  rural  areas,  where\nthe large majority of the poor live, poverty reduction requires (i) continued and increased growth\nin the on-farm and nonfarm sectors, (ii) generation of self-employment microenterprises for the\npoor,  (iii)  more  effective  delivery  of  education  and  health  services,  and  (iv)  better  protection\nagainst natural disasters. The target population under the Project are (i) poor shifting cultivators\nunable  to meet their basic consumption needs and dependent on the sale of manual labor as\nthe main source of income; (ii) poor landless farmers with less than 0.2 ha of cereal production\nland,  including  homesteads,  and  dependent  on  providing  manual  labor  as  the  main  source  of\nincome; and (iii) the absolutely poor marginal farmers with less than 0.4 ha of cereal production\nland. Successful implementation of the Project will benefit the target population who will acquire\n                                                \n30  Loan 1410-THA: Samut Prakarn Wastewater Management, for $150 million, approved on 7 December 1995.\n\n\f33\n\nnew  or  improved  skills;  increased  earning  opportunities  and  incomes;  better  community\norganization; and greater access to productive assets, infrastructure, and economic and social\nservices.  They also will benefit more broadly from improvements in the abilities of district and\nlocal administrations to deliver services in response to demand.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard\n\n104.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nWithin  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  a  suitably  qualified  project  director,\nacceptable  to  ADB,  will  have  been  recruited  using  an  open  and  competitive\nrecruitment process, to replace the interim project director.\n\n(ii)  Within six months of loan effectiveness, the DPMUs in Bandarban, Khagrachari,\nand  Rangamati,  will  have  been  established  and  equipped  with  necessary  office\nfurniture  and  equipment,  including  telephones,  and  staffed  with  key  personnel,\nincluding the deputy project directors, as agreed with ADB.\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that the CHTRC and the HDCs receive their annual\nbudget  allocations  on  time,  including  all  allocations  for  staffing  and  the\nimplementation of this Project, and that such budget allocations are sufficient to\nenable the CHTRC and HDCs to remain fully staffed with appropriate personnel\n(officer  and  class  III  level  staff  in  the  Governments  civil  service  classification\nsystem),  so  as  to  properly  discharge  their  responsibilities  as  executing  agency\nand implementing agencies under this Project.\n\nPrior to the carrying out of any civil works under the Project, the (a) CHTRC will\nconfirm  that  it  concurs  with  the  site  of  the  concerned  civil  works;  and  (b)  the\nGovernment  will  confirm  that  the  site  for  the  concerned  civil  works  is  on\nundisputed land.\n\nThe Government will ensure that the CHTRC, HDCs, PMU, DPMUs, LGED, and\nother  participating  agencies  or  organizations  take  the  necessary  steps  to  have\nthe local tribal population and women living in the project area participate fully in\nplanning  and  implementing  project  activities.  The  CHTRC  will  ensure  that  tribal\nwomen  are  appropriately  represented  in  Project  social  mobilization  and  training\nprograms, and that preference is given to all women (tribal and nontribal) in the\nprovision of microfinance.\n\nThe CHTRC, HDCs, and PMU will ensure that the local NGOs primarily focus on\nsupplying  services  to  the  tribal  population  and  women,  and  that  at  least  70\npercent  of  their  subborrowers  under  the  microfinance  component  of  the  Project\nare women.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  facilities  upgraded  under  the  rural\ninfrastructure component of the Project will be properly operated and maintained\nas  follows:  (a)  the  LGED  will  carry  out  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  of\nimproved  feeder  roads  type  B  and  rural  roads  using  the  Government's  annual\n\n\f34\n\nmaintenance fund; (b) the LGED will submit annually to the Government budgets\nto  cover  the  cost  of  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  of  structures  improved\nunder the Project; (c) the Government will include in its annual budget adequate\nprovision  for  the  LGED  to  carry  out  such  maintenance;  and  (d)  the  LGED  will\nprovide  additional  resources  for  O&M  from  its  Rural  Maintenance  Program\n(supported by the World Food Programme) to the Project.\n\n(viii)  The LGED will ensure that adverse environmental impacts resulting from the civil\nworks  financed  under  the  rural  infrastructure  component  of  the  Project  will  be\nmitigated,  and  appropriate  ADB  and  Government  environmental  safeguards  are\nadopted in relation to noise, dust, air pollution, safety standards, soil erosion, and\nsanitation  measures,  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  governing  environmental\nlaws and regulations.\n\nB.\n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n105.

However, the\ndrop  in  poverty  was  larger  in  urban  than  rural  areas.  For  the  decade  from  1985  through  1995,\nrural  poverty  remained  much  higher  than  urban  poverty  as  measured  with  both  the  lower  and\nupper poverty lines. The data from the household expenditure survey (HES) indicates there are\nseveral key social indicators which are correlated with poverty.\n\n2. \nEducation.  Families  in  which  the  head  of  household  did  not  have  any  education  had  a\nhigher probability of being poor. Nationally, the headcount index for very poor households was 48\npercent  if  headed  by  a  person  without  schooling,  and  7  percent  if  the  head  had  completed\nsecondary  schooling  and  above.  Using  the  upper  poverty  line,  67  percent  of  households  with\nheads  with  no  schooling  were  poor  across  the  country  compared  to  16  percent  of  households\nwith heads who had completed the secondary certificate and above. Poverty falls as the level of\neducation  of  the  household  head  rises,  and  it  falls  faster  in  urban  areas  than  rural  areas,\nsuggesting higher returns to education in urban areas.\n\nOccupation  of  the  Head  of  Household.  In  the  rural  sector,  owner-farmers  had  the\n3.\nlowest probability of being poor (20 percent within the lower poverty lines), followed by workers in\nnonagricultural activities (38 percent); tenant farmers (42 percent); workers in fisheries, forestry,\nand  livestock  (45  percent);  agricultural  workers  with  family  land  (51  percent);  and  agricultural\nworkers without family land (75 percent). In the nonagricultural sector, most high-level employees\n(executives, officials, professionals, and teachers) and most small businessmen and petty traders\nescape poverty. Factory workers and artisans rank below them, followed by salespeople, service\nworkers,  and  transport  and  communication  workers.  Servants  and  day  laborers  had  relatively\nhigh poverty rates. Households where the head was not working do not fare so badly, probably\nbecause they had other sources of income or support that allowed the head not to work. Heads\nwho had a second occupation tended to be in the poorer households, suggesting that the second\noccupation  is  pursued  out  of  necessity.  An  exception  was  households  whose  heads  have  a\nsecond occupation as an owner-farmer.\n\n4.\nRural Farm versus Nonfarm Workers. There has been debate in Bangladesh over the\nliving standards of the rural farm versus the nonfarm workers.3 The traditional view has held that\nthe bulk of nonfarm activities are residual, low productivity occupations which the landless poor\nare  pushed  into.  Therefore,  the  growth  of  the  rural  nonfarm  sector  is  interpreted  as  a  sign  of\nweakness rather than strength in rural development. If that were the case, rural nonfarm workers\nwould be employed in residual activities, receiving extremely low wages, and their poverty rates\nwould be higher than rural agricultural landless households. But the 1995-1996 HES showed that\nrural  households  whose  heads  are  landless  agricultural  workers  are  the  poorest.  This  finding\nsupports  the  alternate  view  of  the  development  of  the  nonfarm  sector,  which  maintains  that\ngrowth  of  the  nonfarm  sector  pulls  people  out  of  poverty  in  rural  areas.  Promoting  the  rural\n                                                \n1  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 1998. Household Expenditure Survey (1995-1996).\n2  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics uses a cost of basic needs (CBN) indicator which, expressed in taka per person\nper  month,  sets  three  poverty  levels  (food,  lower,  and  upper).  The  very  poor  are  categorized  as  falling  below  the\nfood and lower poverty levels and the poor are categorized as falling below the upper poverty level.\n\n3 World Bank. 1996.  Bangladesh \u2013 Rural Infrastructure Strategy.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nnonfarm  sector,  including  fisheries,  livestock,  and  forestry  is  already  a  strong  ingredient  of  the\nmicrofinance  programs  of  the  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  therefore  such  promotion\nrepresents an attractive policy option for reducing poverty in rural areas.\n\n5.\nGender  Disparities.  Rural  households  headed  by  women  had  a  higher  probability  of\nbeing  among  the  very  poor  than  households  headed  by  men  (45  percent  compared  to  39\npercent).  The  headcount  ratios  for  poor  households  were  virtually  identical  for  households\nheaded by females and males. Because households headed by females had smaller families and\nper  capita  consumption  data  was  used  as  a  welfare  indicator,  shown  poverty  among  smaller\nfamilies was underestimated compared to larger families, and in households headed by women.\nAnd,  if  the  distribution  of  consumption  within  households  favors  men,  poverty  among  women  is\nlikely to be higher still.\n\n6.\nWhile  poverty  is  best  measured  by  comparing  per  capita  consumption  to  a  poverty  line,\nother dimensions of well-being are not captured by such measures. Women in Bangladesh lack\naccess to health and education, and have a lower life expectancy than men at birth. Moreover, in\n1993 the ratio of female-to-male child mortality was 1.33, and the ratio of female-to-male children\nwho  received  no  treatment  for  episodes  of  fever  or  acute  respiratory  infection  was  1.19.\nBangladesh\u2019s gender performance in education is better: the ratio of female-to-male enrolment for\nchildren aged 11 to 14 was 0.93 in 1993, well above the South Asian median of 0.70. Yet girls still\nlag behind boys, especially in secondary and higher education. Girls are less likely than boys to\nattend  post-primary  school,  and  they  are  less  likely  to  complete  school  when  they  do  attend.\nMoreover,  women  represent  a  small  minority  of  teachers:  19  percent  in  primary  education  and\nonly 10 percent in secondary education.4\n\n7.\nAttitudes Toward Women. Attitudes toward women are an important social determinant\nof equity, access to public services, and women\u2019s well-being. The rural community module of the\n1995-1996  HES  provides  important  information  on  village  attitudes,  of  both  men  and  women,\ntoward women\u2019s participation in income-generating activities, education, and family planning. Men\nand  women  have  different  attitudes  toward  women  taking  up  income-generating  activities:  in\nalmost 75 percent of villages most women strongly favored doing so, but that view was held by a\nmajority of men in less than half the villages. Support for female education is universally higher\nthan support for income-generating activities and is more even between men and women. Strong\nor very strong support for female education was the majority view of women in 90 percent of the\nvillages and the majority view of men in 84 percent of the villages. There are many villages (over\n20  percent)  in  which  men  oppose  or  strongly  oppose  women  engaging  in  income-generating\nactivities,  but  almost  none  where  they  oppose  women\u2019s  education.  Most  men  support  family\nplanning for women in 56 percent of the villages; most women do so in 65 percent of the villages.\n\nB.\n\nPolicies for Increasing Pro-Poor Economic Growth\n\n8.\nBangladesh\u2019s economic growth has exceeded its population growth, especially since the\nearly 1990s. The gross domestic product (GDP) growth has averaged around 4 percent over the\npast 12 years, and was 4.4 percent in the period 1991-1997, whereas the population growth was\nabout 2 percent. This should have resulted in increased consumption and reduced poverty. Yet\npoverty declined slowly, with no net gains between 1983 and 1992. Rural poverty in particular has\nremained very high and the actual number of poor has increased over time.\n\n                                                \n4 World Bank. 1996. Bangladesh \u2013 Education Review.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nA  recent  analysis5  showed  that  a  rising  inequality  had  accompanied  the  growth  in  GDP\n9.\nand the actual pattern of growth in per capita consumption without the changes in equality would\nhave  been  about  10  percentage  points  lower  in  FY1995/96  than  was  observed.  The  analysis\nhighlighted  the  need  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  likely  implications  of  various  growth\npatterns  and  the  microeconomic  determinants  of  inequality  so  that  public  policies  may  help  to\nreduce  inequality  over  time.  It  posed  the  following  questions:  How  would  different  sectoral\npatterns  of  growth  affect  poverty?  How  does  the  saving  to  finance  investment  affect  poverty?\nThe analysis examined three simple scenarios \u2014 one with steadily accelerating growth, one with\nhigher growth coming from services, and one with higher growth coming from agriculture.\n\n10.\nA simulation of these scenarios suggested (i) if economic growth accelerates, it will lead to\nsignificant  poverty  reduction,  even  after  taking  into  account  the  potential  impact  of  rising\ninequality; (ii) to the extent that Bangladesh makes better use of the concessional foreign aid to\nwhich it has access, the impact of higher growth on poverty would be large, and to the extent that\nsafety nets better protect the consumption of the poorest, the impact of faster growth on poverty\nwould be greater; and (iii) growth based on faster agricultural growth would bring additional gains\nin poverty reduction, and reduce inequality.\n\nC.\n\nMicroeconomic Determinants of Poverty\n\n11.\nIn addition to broad-based economic growth, investment in the poor\u2019s human and physical\ncapital are widely recognized to reduce poverty. Further analysis by the World Bank of the 1995-\n1996 HES (para. 1) made the following conclusions and suggested certain policy implications.\n\n12.\nReturns to Education. Holding other household characteristics constant, for a household\nwhose head completes primary school, consumption rises 19 percent per capita in urban areas\nand 7 percent per capita in rural areas compared to a household head who had no education. For\nsecondary  school,  the  gain  is  48  percent  for  urban  areas  and  17  percent  for  rural  areas.  The\ngains  are  high  for  spouses.  These  figures  have  been  relatively  stable  since  1983  and  have\nincreased for women. The gains from education have remained huge, despite recent increases in\nunemployment  among  the  better  educated,  warranting  greater  investment  in  education.  The\nincreasing gains from education for spouses in rural households may denote greater participation\nof women in income-generating activities.\n\n13.\nReturns  to  land  ownership,  occupation,  demographics,  wages,  and  employment.\nLandlessness  increases  the  probability  of  being  poor,  as  do  certain  occupations.  In  agriculture,\nowner-farmers  are  best  off,  followed  by  tenant  farmers,  workers  in  fisheries,  forestry,  and\nlivestock,  and  agricultural  workers  with    land.  Factory  workers,  artisans,  salespeople,  service\nworkers  and  transportation  workers  fare  better  than  agricultural  workers.  Real  wages  have\nincreased  but  agricultural  wages  have  lagged  behind  other  forms  of  employment.  While\nunemployment is relatively low, underemployment remains high, especially in rural areas. Given\nthe  potential  political  and  administrative  constraints  to  land  distribution,  promoting  the  nonfarm\nsector,  microfinance  programs,  and  human  capital  investment  is  a  good  strategy  to  raise  the\nstandard  of  living  of  landless  agricultural  workers.  Nonfarm-related  investments  in  the  poorest\nregions  would  reduce  poverty  the  most,  although  the  absolute  gains  from  joining  the  nonfarm\nsector may be greater in the better-off regions. The slower rise in agricultural wages is consistent\nwith \nto  reduce\nin  rural  poverty.  Policies  should  be \nunderemployment in rural areas, for example by providing better opportunities for women.\n\nthe  slower  decline \n\nimplemented \n\n                                                \n5 World Bank. 1998.  Bangladesh-From Counting the Poor to Making the Poor Count.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\n14.\nArea  Determinants  of  Poverty.  Differences  in  poverty  between  geographic  areas\ndepend more on different area characteristics than on differences of households located in these\nareas.  Policing  targeted  investments  to  poor  regions  should  be  supported.  These  could  include\ninvestments  in  rural  roads  and  bridges,  marketing  facilities,  health  and  school  facilities,\nmicrofinance, energy, and communications.\n\n15.\nDeterminants of Inequality. Land ownership drives inequality the most in rural areas. In\nboth urban and rural areas, location is the second largest determinant of inequality. Occupation\nhas a lesser impact. Enabling the poor to complete primary education is inequality-reducing, as is\ninvesting  in  poorer  regions  and  eliminating  land-labor  failures  that  further  skew  rural  land\ndistribution.  Transfer  and  skill  building  such  as  Food-for-Work  and  Vulnerable  Group\nDevelopment programs  reduce inequality.\n\nD.\n\nPublic Expenditures and Government Safety Net Programs\n\nEffective  public  spending,  including  spending  on  rural  infrastructure  in  addition  to  social\n16.\nsector programs and safety nets, can reduce poverty. Public social sector expenditures rose from\nTk8  billion  in  FY1989/90  to  Tk28.5  billion  in  FY1995/96  in  constant  FY1995/96  prices.  Real\neducation spending has increased the most, both in absolute and real terms from Tk3.14 billion in\nFY1989/90  to  Tk5.85  billion  in  FY1995/96.  Education  and  health  represented  80  percent  of  the\nAnnual  Development  Plan  (ADP)  social  spending  in  FY1995/96.  Overall,  the  share  of\nBangladesh\u2019s  ADP  devoted  to  education,  health,  social  welfare,  and  family  planning  has  more\nthan doubled since FY1989/90 from 10 to 24 percent.\n\nSafety  Nets \n\n17.\nin  Bangladesh  Serve  Transfer  Payment  and  Human  Capital\nAccumulation Objectives. There is a long tradition of safety nets established by external food\naid. The three biggest programs are Food-for-Work, which provides wheat in exchange for work\non  rural  infrastructure  projects,  Food-for-Education  which  initially  provided  wheat  and  now\nprovides  wheat  and  rice  to  poor  children  in  return  for  regular  primary  school  attendance,  and\nVulnerable  Group  Development,  which  provides  food  grains  and  training  to  disadvantaged\nwomen.  Test  Relief  is  a  smaller  program  used  to  support  activities  like  cleaning  ponds  and\nbushes, and making minor repairs to rural roads, schools, and  mosques during the rainy season.\nFood-for-Work is by far the largest program but the fastest growing and second largest program\nis Food-for-Education, which started in FY1993/94 in selected rural villages.\n\nPublic  safety  net  programs  such  as  those  mentioned  above  play  an  important  role  in\n18.\nprotecting the poor and in building rural infrastructure and human capital. Given the persistence\nof  high  poverty  rates  and  the  observed  increases  in  inequality,  these  programs  should  be\npursued.  Monetization  of  these  programs  could  bring  additional  benefits  by  reducing  costs  and\navoiding risks of distortions in food markets and in farmer decision-making of enterprises.\n\nE.\n\nNGO Programs\n\nBangladesh  is  known  internationally  for  its  innovative  NGOs,  which  have  grown  rapidly.\n19.\nThe  number  of  NGOs  registered  with  the  NGO  Affairs  Bureau  has  tripled  since  1990  to  about\n1,200  in  1997.  In  some  areas  the  size  of  NGO  programs  is  now  on  a  par  with  the  size  of\ngovernment  programs.  While  the  influence  of  NGOs  and  their  reliance  on  foreign  funding  has\nbeen  a  source  of  tension  with  the  government  in  the  past,  the  situation  has  improved  and\npartnerships with NGOs are now being more common.\n\n20.\nMicrofinance  programs  such  as  those  provided  by  the  Bangladesh  Rural  Agricultural\nCooperative (BRAC), Association for Social Advancement (ASA), Proshika, and Grameen Bank\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 2, page 5\n\nare among the best known. The Grameen Bank had 2.06 million microcredit clients in 1996, and\nBRAC, Proshika, and ASA has 1.84 million, 1.30 million, and 0.57 million, respectively. This puts\nthe  size  of  these  organizations  on  par  with  the  Bangladesh  Rural  Development  Board  (BRDB),\nthe  government\u2019s  microfinance  agency.  In  addition  to  microfinance,  NGOs  provide  skill  training,\neducation,  health,  family  planning,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  services.  NGOs  are  also\nactive  in  managing  common  property  resources,  extending  nontraditional  agriculture,  and\ninitiating  income  generating  activities.  For  these  activities  as  well,  some  NGO  programs  have\nreached  the  size  of  similar  government  programs.  BRAC\u2019s  Non-Formal  Primary  Education\nprogram  operated  34,175  schools  in  1996,  enrolling  1.1  million  students  in  22,602  villages.  By\ncomparison,  the  Food-for-Education  program  served  about  2  million  children  that  year.  NGOs\nhave also diversified their activities: BRAC acts as a financial intermediary providing microcredit\nto  landless  women  nationwide  and,  for  example,  supports  research  on  plant  tissue  culture  to\nimprove  agribusiness  opportunities  in  fruit  and  vegetable  cultivation.  Grameen  operates  the\nGrameen  Bank  and  has  sponsored  Grameen  Telecom,  which  provides  cellular  telephone\nservices, and likewise Proshika, which acts as an internet provider.\n\n21.\nMicrofinance  programs  are  effective  in  fighting  poverty.  The  large  NGO  microfinance\ninstitutions  are  becoming  more  sustainable  over  time  because  of  their  system  of  group-based\ncollateral  and  high  repayment  rates.  The  vastly  superior  performance  of  NGO  rural  health  and\neducation  services  offers  possibilities  of  partnerships  with  public  agencies  to  broaden  their\npoverty reduction successes.\n\nF.\n\nRural Poverty in the Chittagong Hill Tracts\n\n22.\nNo  official  data  is  available  on  the  poverty  status  in  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  (CHT).\nHowever, the benchmark and socioeconomic survey conducted in all three districts during project\npreparation  showed  that  about  70  percent  of  the  619  rural  families  surveyed  from  all  ethnic\ngroupings,  had  incomes  that  were  below  the  food  poverty  level,6  the  lowest  level  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  index.  This  figure  is  about  twice  the  national  average  for  rural  areas  in\nBangladesh (footnote 1). The BMS also determined that the principal perceived problems of the\nrural communities were poor communications, a lack of drinking and irrigation water, and a lack of\nincome-generating opportunities.\n\n23.\nThe  reasons  for  this  extreme  poverty  are  several.  The  lands  are  not  productive.\nNationally,  about  70  percent  of  Bangladesh  soils  are  cultivatable  and  have  few  production\nlimitations. The equivalent figure in the CHT is about 6 percent  and its generally poor soils and\nsteep  contours  severely  limit  the  production  enterprise  options.  The  creation  of  Lake  Kaptai  in\n1960, took about 20,000 ha of the CHT's best agricultural land and permanently left the CHT as a\ncereal deficit area. The in-migration of people from the plains districts in the late 1970s to early\n1980s exacerbated the pressures on the remaining agricultural land and the resulting insurgency\nwar internally displaced many families. Much of the hilly land that could offer income generating\nopportunities in social forestry, is either under the exclusive control of the Forestry Department or\nis subject to forestry regulations that deter private forestry investments.\n\n24.\nReducing  poverty  in  the  rural  areas  is  directly  addressed  through  a  group  of  public\nexpenditure  programs  associated  with  the  development  of  rural  infrastructure.  These  programs\ninclude Food-for-Work, Vulnerable Group Development, and Rural Maintenance and serve both\ntransfer  payment  and  human  capital  accumulation  objectives.

All of these programs are operating in the CHT and they\nmake a significant contribution to rural incomes.7\n\n25.\nSupporting  the  public  sector  programs  is  a  parallel  set  of  NGO  programs  which  are\nfocused  on  skills  development  backed  up  with  microfinance.  The  national  NGO  operations  of\nBRAC, Integrated Development Foundation, and Proshika did not start in the CHT until 1997 and\ntheir  activities  have  been  limited  by  tribal  leadership  concerns  about  the  potential  erosion  of\ncultural  values  through  the  NGO  development  approach.

Savings in transport costs\nhave  in  turn  led  to  lower  farm  input  prices  and  an  improvement  in  product  prices,  which  have\ntogether  resulted  in  an  increase  in  agricultural  production.  In  some  areas,  a  change  to  more\nintensive forms of land use has occurred.\n\n2. \nIn  the  nonfarm  sectors,  economic  activity  has  also  increased  as  a  direct  result  of  road\nimprovement. These activities have included a range of service enterprises (vehicle repair, for\nexample),  the  supply  of  transport  equipment  reflecting  a  change  from  nonmotorized  to\nmotorized modes of transport and small enterprise development supported by growth in credit\nprovision managed by nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\n\n3. \nWhile similar outcomes from investment in road improvement could be expected in the\nChittagong  Hill  Tracts  (CHT),  there  are  some  important  differences  from  the  plains  areas  in\nwhich most of the recent road building activity in Bangladesh has occurred. First, the terrain in\nthe  CHT  is  characterized  by  many  steep  sided  valleys  through  which  roads  must  necessarily\npass.  As  a  result,  the  area  of  good  quality  agricultural  land  that  can  be  influenced  per  unit  of\nroad is quite small. In the preparation of the Third Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for\nexample, areas of influence per kilometer (km) of road ranging from 900 hectares (ha) to over\n1,400 ha are quoted, while comparable figures for the CHT as assessed during field work are\ntypically 30-50 ha/km.\n\n4. \nSecond, there are serious constraints to expanded agricultural production. Areas of high\nquality  soils  are  very  limited  and  perennial  irrigation  sources  are  not  widely  available.\nFurthermore, uncertain land tenure arrangements together with restrictive legislative provisions\ncovering  forestry  are  likely  to  constrain  the  development  of  tree  crops  that  could  add\nsignificantly to the effective command area of new roads.\n\n5. \nAnother important difference between the plains and the CHT is the availability of data.\nThere is almost no traffic survey data for the CHT, and no CHT-specific vehicle operating cost\ndata for the classes of roads to be upgraded under the project.\n\n6. \nIn  the  evaluation  that  follows,  all  of  the  benefits  from  the  infrastructure  investment\ncomponent  are  assumed  to  be  captured  by  agricultural  producers,  who  will  be  supported  by\nproject investment in credit and technical services.\n\n7. \nQuantified  benefits  of  the  Project  are  (i)  reductions  in  general  goods  transport  costs\nresulting from improvements to the road network; (ii) intensification of crop production through\nprovision  of  term  and  seasonal  finance,  technical  services,  and  improved  access  to  markets;\nand  (iii)  expanded  output  of  livestock  products,  particularly  table  eggs,  broilers,  and  fattened\npigs through provision of seasonal finance, technical services, and improved access to markets.\nBenefits  from  the  community-based  investments  to  be  supported  by  the  Project  or  from  the\ninstitutional strengthening activities to be undertaken have not been quantified, neither have the\ninvestment costs directly related to these activities been included in the analysis.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nB. \n\nExchange Rate and Price Assumptions\n\n8. \nExchange  Rate.  A  trade-weighted  shadow  exchange  rate  of  Tk56=$1  has  been\nassumed  giving  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF)  of  1.10,  which  has  been  used  in  the\neconomic analysis.\n\n9. \nPrice  Assumptions.  The  economic  analysis  is  presented  using  a  domestic  price  level\nnumeraire.  Since  the  incremental  output  from  participating  households  will  be  relatively  small\ncompared to total market volumes, price impacts are expected to be minimal.\n\n10. \nFor  the  major  outputs,  relevant  price  considerations  are  (i)  incremental  rice  production\nwill  substitute  for  imports  and  prices  have  been  determined  on  this  basis  (including  allowance\nfor  reductions  in  transport  costs  expected  as  a  result  of  project  investments)  assuming\ncompetitive markets in the CHT; and (ii) potatoes, fruit, and poultry products are not, in general,\ntraded although their prices are competitively determined \u2014 anecdotal evidence suggests that\neggs do come across the border from India from time to time, introducing a further element of\ncompetition in price determination.\n\n11. \n  Fertilizers  are  the  main  traded  inputs  and  prices  have  been  estimated  at  farmgate\nborder  equivalents  using  medium  term  price  projections.  All  other  inputs  have  been  valued  at\ntheir competitive local financial value.\n\n12. \nAs transport costs are competitively determined, it is expected that reductions in vehicle\noperating  costs  resulting  from  road  improvements  to  be  carried  out  under  the  Project  will  be\nreflected  in  reduced  charges.  Based  on  the  experience  of  other  rural  infrastructure  projects  in\nBangladesh,  it  is  assumed  that  general  goods  freight  costs  will  fall  by  40  percent.  These\nbenefits are expected to arise within a year of each section of road being completed.\n\n Farm family labor has been costed in the financial analysis at Tk70 per day on the basis\n13. \nof actual wages found in the area. For the economic analysis, an opportunity cost of labor of 80\npercent  of  this  rate  has  been  assumed.  Much  of  the  work  will  be  carried  out  by  females  who\ntypically earn a lower wage rate than males, which supports the assumption of an opportunity\ncost of less than market rates.\n\nC. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n1. \n\nBenefit Area and Households\n\n14. \nData collected during the feasibility study indicate that each km of completed feeder road\ntype B (FRB) will have an area of influence of about 48 ha.  As rural roads will, in general, be\nconstructed  in  areas  where  agricultural  land  is  interspersed  with  infertile  land,  their  area  of\ninfluence is estimated at 41 ha/km. Table A10.1 shows areas of influence for each class of road\nto be constructed together with an estimate of the number of households (24,000) in this area,\nassuming a household farm size of 0.75 ha.\n\n15. \nSurvey data also indicates that land use in a typical area of influence comprises rice at\nabout 77 percent of the total; vegetables such as potato and squash, 9 percent; spices such as\nginger  and  turmeric,  6  percent;  and  fruit  crops  about  8  percent.  In  addition,  many  households\nsupplement their food production from settled agriculture with shifting cultivation on steeper hills\nsurrounding  the  area  of  influence.  Many  households  also  have  livestock  enterprises  such  as\nchicken and pig raising.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nTable A10.1:   Road Areas of Influence and Household Numbers\n\nDistrict\n\nUnit\n\nFRB\n\nRR\n\nTotal\n\nArea per km road\n\nha\n\n      48\n\n      41\n\n      20\n      20\n      35\n      75\n\n    960\n    960\n 1,680\n 3,600\n\n73\n     230\n       48\n     351\n\n  2,993\n  9,430\n  1,968\n14,391\n\nRoad length\n\nBandarban\nKhagrachari\nRangamati\n   Total\n\nArea of Influence\nBandarban\nKhagrachari\nRangamati\n   Total\n\nArea per household\n\nHouseholds:\nBandarban\nKhagrachari\nRangamati\n   Total\n\nkm\nkm\nkm\nkm\n\nha\nha\nha\nha\n\nha\n\nno.\nno.\nno.\nno.\n\n93\n250\n83\n426\n\n3,953\n10,390\n3,648\n17,991\n\n0.75\n\n5,271\n13,853\n4,864\n23,988\n\n16. \narea:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFRB = feeder road type  B, ha = hectare, km = kilometer, RR = rural road.\n\n2. \n\nProducer Responses to Project Investments\n\nThree broad patterns of response to project investments are expected within the project\n\nSeventy percent of existing households within the area of influence of roads to be\nconstructed  under  the  Project  will  benefit  from  reduced  transport  costs  but  will\nnot  intensify  their  agricultural  production.  There  will  be  no  incremental  physical\noutput  from  these  households.  Financial  benefits  to  these  producers  will  be\nreflected in increased household savings or consumption.\n\nThirty percent of households in the same area will respond to reduced transport\ncosts,  improved  access  to  markets,  availability  of  seasonal  finance  and\navailability  of  technical  services  (all  to  be  provided  under  the  Project)  by\nincreasing input use and output.\n\n(iii)  Within  the  project  area  as  a  whole,  households  will  invest  in  new  livestock\nenterprises  including  egg  production,  broiler  production,  and  pig  fattening.\nImproved access to credit and technical services will be important factors in this\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\ngrowth. These households will include those both within the area of influence of\nnew roads and in areas covered by existing roads.\n\n17. \n\nBeneficiary numbers are shown in Table A10.2.\n\nTable A10.2:  Beneficiary Numbers\n\nEnterprise\n\n                      No.  of\n                Households\n\nPrice changes only\nPrice changes and new technology\n\n16,800\n7,200\n\nCrop Production\n\nSubtotala\nPoultry Layerb\nPoultry Broilerc\nPig Fattenerd\n\n24,000\n10,000\n13,000\n5,000\n52,000\n\nTotal Households\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\nTotal households from Table A10.1 above.\nSix local birds and 6 high yield value birds.\n150 high yield value broilers.\nTypical unit has three fatteners.\n\n3. \n\nFinancial Benefits to Crop Producers\n\n18.  With and without project gross margins for representative crops in the area of influence\nhave been estimated for both cost reduction and production increase options. For households\nthat intensify output, main changes with the project are an increase in fertilizer use together with\nvarietal  changes.  Incremental  outputs  (including  those  for  livestock  enterprises)  are  shown  in\nTable A10.3.\n\nTable A10.3:  Incremental Production \u2013 Crop and Livestock Enterprises\n\nEnterprise\n\nCrops\n\nAmman paddya\nBoro paddya\nPotato\nGinger (green)\n\nLivestock\nEggs\nBroilers\nFattened pigs\n\na  paddy is unhulled rice.\n\nUnit\n\nNo.\n\nkg/ha\nkg/ha\nkg/ha\nkg/ha\n\nno.\nno.\nno.\n\n1,100\n1,250\n4,500\n205\n\n982\n141\n2.85\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\n19. \n\nIncremental gross margins for representative crops are summarized in Table A10.4.\n\nTable A10.4:  Incremental Gross Margins and Return to Labor \u2013 Crop Enterprises\n\nCrop\n\nAmman rice\nBoro rice\nPotato\nGinger\nFruit\nAll cropsc\n\nAll cropsd\n\nIncremental Gross\nMargina\n\nIncremental Gross\nMarginb\n\nCost\nSavings\nOnly\n\nCost Savings\n and New\nTechnology\n\nCost\nSavings\nOnly\n\nCost Savings\nand  New\nTechnology\n\n(Tk/ha)\n\n         (Tk/ha)\n\n(Tk/ps day)\n\n(Tk/ps day)\n\n317\n427\n715\n657\n50\n408\n\n12,870\n14,294\n22,371\n4,487\n50\n8,593\n\n           81\n           88\n         118\n             8\n             -\n            49\n\n2\n3\n4\n8\n-\n3\n\n2\n\n(Tk/hh)\n306\n\n            (Tk/hh)\n6,400\n\n(Tk/ps day) (Tk/ps day)\n\n             36\n\nhh = household, ps = personal savings.\n\n                  a   Incremental output less the value of incremental input costs excluding the value of family labor.\n            b   Incremental gross margin per unit of incremental family labor.\n                  c   Crop mix of rice (77%), potato (9%), ginger (6%), and fruit (8%) used as basis for estimating\n\n  overall margins per ha.\n\n                   d   Average farm size of 0.75 ha assumed.\n\n20. \nFor  a  typical  beneficiary  household  with  0.75  ha  of  land,  the  improvement  in  gross\nmargin  where  only  transport  cost  savings  are  assumed  is  Tk306.  Where  output  is  intensified,\nthe  incremental  gross  margin  is  estimated  at  Tk6,400.  This  latter  amount  is  very  significant\nwhen  compared  with  current  incomes  of  between  Tk20,000  and  Tk30,000  per  household  and\nshould provide a strong incentive for beneficiary participation.\n\n4. \n\nFinancial Benefits to Livestock Producers\n\n21. \nFinancial models have been prepared for three livestock enterprises: (i) egg production,\n(ii)  broiler  production,  and  (iii)  pig  fattening.  A  typical  egg  producer  would  have  a  flock  of  12\nlayers comprising six locally bred and six improved birds while a typical broiler enterprise would\ncomprise  150  birds.  A  typical  pig  fattening  unit  would  have  three  animals.  A  summary  of  the\nincremental  gross  margins  from  these  enterprises,  together  with  an  indication  of  the  credit\nrequired, is shown in Table A10.5.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\nTable A10.5: Incremental Gross Margins and Labor Return-Livestock Enterprises\n\nEnterprise\n\nPoultry Layer\nPoultry Broiler\nPig Fattening\n\nIncremental\nGross Margin\n(Tk)\n\nReturn to\nLabor\n(Tk)\n\nCredit\nNeed\n(Tk)\n\nFIRR\n(%)\n\n3,220\n8,613\n4,175\n\n        88\n      328\n        46\n\n2,100\n7,500\n5,500\n\n>50%\n>50%\n>50%\n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return.\n\n22.  Margins and return to labor from livestock enterprises are satisfactory when compared to\nhousehold  returns  from  crop  production  enterprises,  and  therefore  should  be  attractive  to\nbeneficiaries. A further advantage is that these enterprises are very suitable for women, while\nchildren can also help with activities such as poultry feeding. Production systems for smallholder\npoultry are in widespread use in Bangladesh with the result that the technology is well tested.\nBoth  of  the  poultry  enterprises  can  be  reduced  in  size  to  fit  the  particular  labor  and  financial\nresources of beneficiaries, as there are few fixed investments involved.\n\n23. \nCredit  requirements,  including  seasonal  finance,  range  from  Tk2,100  in  the  case  of  a\nlayer enterprise to Tk7,500 for broilers. Enterprise cash flows can support a one-year repayment\nperiod, which is the typical term for microfinance loans in Bangladesh.\n\nD. \n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\n1. \n\nIntroduction\n\n24. \nThe economic evaluation draws together the investment costs of the Project (excluding\nsubprojects for which benefits have not been estimated) during a 7-year implementation period,\nplus the recurrent costs needed to ensure sustainable benefits. These costs are then compared\nwith  the  estimated  direct  benefits,  over  a  30-year  period.  With  the  exception  of  rice,  triple\nsuperphosphate,  muriate  of  potash,  and  urea,  the  prices  for  which  have  been  estimated  in\nborder-equivalent  terms,  the  final  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  Project  have  been  valued  at\ncompetitive  market  prices,  at  farmgate,  after  adjusting  for  taxes  and  duties.  As  the  analysis  is\nexpressed  in  economic  prices  at  domestic  price  levels,  tradable  components  have  been\nadjusted by the shadow exchange rate factor to convert them to the domestic price level.\n\n2. \n\nFinal Incremental Outputs\n\n25. \nThe  main  final  incremental  outputs  of  the  project  as  evaluated  (Table  A10.6)  would  be\ncrops (primarily rice and vegetables) and livestock products (eggs, broilers, and fattened pigs).\nThese increments are expected to result from reductions in transport costs and improvements in\nmarket access for existing crop producers, with these changes leading, in some cases, to more\nintensive use of production inputs such as fertilizers. In addition, new livestock enterprises will\narise  as  communications  improve,  transport  costs  change,  and  credit  availability  improves.\nBenefits for crop producers who do not intensify output will be limited to reductions in transport\ncosts.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 10, page 7\n\nFurthermore, there will be unquantified savings in travel time as transport modes change\n26. \nin response to road improvements, and passenger transport fares should decline in response to\nreduced costs of road use.\n\nTable A10.6:  Main Project Incremental Outputs\n\nCommodity\n\nUnit\n\nNo. of Units\n\nt\nt\nt\nt\nm eggs\nm broilers\nnumber\n\n1,660\n2,900\n2,340\n68\n6.16\n1.83\n14,250\n\nAmman paddya\nBoro paddya\nPotatoes\nGinger\nTable eggs\nBroilers\nFattened pigs\n\n          m = million,  t = tons.\n\na paddy is unhulled rice.\n\n3. \n\nCosts\n\nAll  incremental  final  output  would  be  marketed  domestically.  The  CHT  is  a  rice  deficit\n27. \narea  and  it  is  expected  that  much  of  the  increased  rice  output  will  be  consumed  locally.\nVegetables will be marketed in Chittagong and in Dhaka after satisfying local demand. Livestock\nproducts will be sold locally and in Chittagong, with any surpluses being marketed further afield.\n\n28. \nAll costs are in constant mid-2000 terms. Investment costs used in the analysis are total\ncosts  less  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction.  Unskilled  labor  used  in  road\nconstruction has been valued at a shadow wage of 80 percent of the agricultural wage to reflect\nits  opportunity  cost.  On-farm  investments  and  vehicles  and  office  equipment  financed  by  the\nproject are assumed to have a zero residual value.\n\n29. \nAs benefits from the community development component have not been assessed, the\ncost of this component has been excluded from the economic evaluation. Project management\ncosts, estimated as 30 percent of the total, which are assessed as being directly related to the\nimplementation of the community development component and more general capacity building,\nhave  also  been  excluded.  All  rural  infrastructure  investment  costs  have  been  included.  Eighty\npercent of the value of the proposed credit line has been excluded, as the costs that would be\nfinanced by term loans from this proportion of the credit line are included in the various livestock\nenterprise  models.  The  balance  of  the  credit  line  is  included  as  seasonal  finance  for  crop\nproducers and is salvaged at its original value at the end of the 30-year analysis term.\n\n4. \n\nAgricultural Output Prices\n\nRice has been valued as an import substitute, using 2000 World Bank price projections.\n\n30. \nAll other outputs have been valued at current domestic farmgate prices, adjusted by the SERF.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 10, page 8\n\n5. \n\nAgricultural Input Prices\n\n31. \nThe main tradable inputs used in agricultural production\u2013urea (export parity), TSP, and\nMOP  (import  parity)\u2013have  been  valued  in  border  terms  using  World  Bank  2000  price\nprojections.  All  other  base  costs  are  expressed  in  late  1999  terms.  Livestock  feed  ingredients\nare imported free of duty and with minimal taxes and compound feeds have accordingly been\nvalued  at  their  domestic  competitive  market  value  adjusted  by  the  SERF.  All  other  farm\nproduction inputs (with the exception of family labor) have been valued using adjusted domestic\nprices.\n\nLabor  used  in  road  construction  and  agricultural  production  has  been  valued  at  80\n32. \npercent of its Tk70 per day (without food) financial value, reflecting its opportunity cost. All other\nlabor, including consulting and other contract services, has been valued at its financial price.\n\n6. \n\nLabor\n\n7. \n\nBenefit Flows\n\n33. \nAgricultural benefits arising from each section of newly completed road are assumed to\nbe  realized  in  full  in  the  following  year.  These  benefits  have  been  estimated  on  the  basis  of\nincremental  output  per  ha  influenced  by  the  completed  road.  Livestock  benefit  flows  are\nassumed  to  follow  a  similar  pattern.  It  has  been  assumed  that  the  incomes  of  beneficiaries\nwould  remain  at  present  levels  without  the  Project.  Many  of  the  intended  beneficiaries  do  not\ncurrently  have  paid  employment  or  receive  limited  employment  with  other  farmers  or  in  road\nmaintenance work and it is unlikely that this would change significantly without the Project.\n\n8. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity\n\nTaking  the  above  assumptions  as  the  base  case,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return\n34. \n(EIRR) of the project is 11.9 percent. While this rate is below the assumed opportunity cost of\ncapital (12 percent), it is judged to be acceptable when the unquantified benefits are taken into\nconsideration. If road construction costs rise by 10 percent, the EIRR falls to 10.7 percent. If the\narea of land on which more intensive production technology is used falls from 30 percent of the\ntotal  in  the  area  of  influence,  as  assumed  in  the  base  case,  to  20  percent  (but  with  a\ncorresponding increase in the nonintensive production area), the EIRR falls to 10.6 percent. If\nmore intensive production technology is adopted on 40 percent of the available land, the EIRR\nrises to 12.8 percent. The EIRR is also sensitive to changes in assumptions about the area of\nland influenced by each km of road. If this falls by 10 percent, the EIRR falls to 11.5 percent.\n\n35. \nThe EIRR is also sensitive to changes in price assumptions for livestock products. If the\nfeed price is assumed to rise by 10 percent, for example, the EIRR falls to 10.8 percent while if\nthe price of eggs and broilers together falls by 10 percent the EIRR falls to 10.6 percent.\n\nE. \n\nUnquantified Benefits\n\n36. \nBenefits that have not been quantified include (i) a saving in travel time, particularly for\npeople currently using nonmotorized transport on earth surfaced tracks, (ii) improved delivery of\ndevelopment services such as health and education, (iii) a reduction in consumer goods prices\nresulting from reductions in transport costs, (iv) reduced spoilage in markets and easier access\nto markets, and (v) an improvement in the general business environment engendered by more\nreliable and cheaper transport services.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 10, page 9\n\nF. \n\nSubsidy and Recurrent Budget Implications of the Project\n\n37. \nApart from grants to be made under the community development component, there will\nbe no direct subsidies paid by the project. Beneficiaries will, however, continue to draw on the\nfree advisory services currently provided by government agencies in the area. It is expected that\nthe interest rates for loans to be made under the microfinance component will at least cover the\nincremental lending costs of NGOs, including provisioning.\n\nOperating  and  maintenance  costs  of  small  markets  that  may  be  financed  under  the\n38. \ncommunity  development  component  of  the  Project  will  be  met  by  union  councils  using  a  fixed\nproportion  of  the  proceeds  of  market  stall  leases  specifically  set  aside  for  this  purpose.\nOperating  and  maintenance  costs  of  facilities  to  be  constructed  under  the  community\ndevelopment component will be the responsibility of community development committees to be\nset up under the Project.\n\nRecurrent  government  budget  costs  extending  beyond \n\n39. \nthe  seven-year  project\ninvestment period are limited to road maintenance. The estimated annual cost (Table A10.7) is\nTk27.53 m ($0.5 m).\n\nTable A10.7:  Recurrent Budget Implications of the Project\n\nRoad Maintenance\n\nFeeder Roads Type B\n\nItem\n\nRoutine\nPeriodic\nSubtotal\n\nRural Roads\nRoutine\nPeriodic\nSubtotal\n\nTotal\n\nNo. of\n\nCost/unit\n\nTotal\n\nUnit\n\nUnits\n\n(Tk'000)\n\n(Tk'000)\n\nkm\nkm\n\nkm\nkm\n\n75\n75\n\n33.15\n71.40\n\n351\n351\n\n15.30\n40.80\n\n2,486\n5,355\n7,841\n\n5,370\n14,320\n19,691\n27,532\n\n\fSTRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES, THREAT ANALYSIS\nOF CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS ORGANIZATIONSa\n\nOrganization\n\nStrengths\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThreats\n\nComments\n\nMinistry of CHT Affairs\n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nTribal Minister\nFormally has advisory\ncommittee bringing\ntogether the  members of\nparliament (MP),\nRegional Council (RC),\nhill tract district councils\n(HDCs) and rajas\n\u2022  Part of peace accord\n\u2022  Access to other ministries\nand potential political\nsupport\n\n\u2022  Can argue for special\n\nneeds of CHT\n\n\u2022  Potential for advocacy\nand watchdog role\n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nLong role in region\nInstitutional knowledge of\ndevelopment\n\n\u2022  Supported by Ministry\n\u2022  Staff in three districts\n\u2022  Has some engineering\n\nstaff\n\n\u2022  Some past experience\nwith small projects\nImplementing agency for\nsome projects begun\nprior to peace accord\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Dhaka-based\n\u2022 \nLacks outreach\n\u2022  Appears to lack data\n\nbase, and technical and\nplanning staff\n\u2022  Apparent inability to\nprovide good policy\nadvice\n\n\u2022  Status within overall\nministry structure\n\u2022  Advisory committee not\n\nyet established\n\n\u2022  Does not appear to play\nstrong advocacy role\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Historical involvement\nwith the past and\nGovernment treatment of\nCHT\nFormed 1975-1976 and\nhence association with\nmilitary activities\n\u2022 \nFew technical staff\n\u2022  Community attitudes and\n\n\u2022 \n\nperception\nFailure in the past to\ncarry out its mandate to\nensure active\nparticipation of tribal\npopulation in\ndevelopment\n\n\u2022 \n\nLow status and career\nappeal for staff\n\n\u2022  Political differences with\nRC and some tribal\norganizations\n\n\u2022  Sensitivity of CHT issues\n\u2022  Duplication of\n\nadministrative structures\n\n\u2022  Perceptions of\n\norganization by external\nagencies\n\n\u2022  Potential at national level,\nbut appears ineffective\n\n\u2022  Can block action\n\u2022 \n\nLacks realism when\ndealing with external\nagencies\n\n\u2022  Uncertain political\n\ncommitment to carry\nthrough peace accord\n\u2022  Appears subservient to\nGovernment wishes\n\n\u2022  Association with the past\n\n\u2022 \n\nnot the future\nLack of trust in its\ncommitment to\nindigenous peoples\n\u2022  Peace accord requires\nthat it should be under\nthe general and overall\nsupervision of the RC\nLack of tribal staff\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Redundant organization\nfollowing Peace Accord\n\n\u2022  Government failure to\n\ntransfer its staff to other\norganizations to simplify\noverall administration\nLegislative repeal\noverdue\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Slowly being phased out\nin terms of externally\nfunded activities\n\u2022  Chair  has status of\ndeputy minister\n\nCHT Development Board\n\na  This  is  a  brief  overview  of  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  key  organizations  in  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts.
