The  system  is\ncharacterized by inequitable access,  especially  for  the  poor,  girls,\nand  indigenous  peoples,  and  low  quality  with  high  repetition  and\ndropout  rates.  The  weak  education  system  is  perpetuating  the\ncycle  of  poverty,  and  contributing  to  low  productivity,  and  weak\ngovernance.  A  low  level  of  public  expenditure  on  education  has\nbeen  a  major  constraint  to  human  resource  development.  The\nto  reduce  poverty,  and  enhance\nGovernment  realizes \neconomic  growth  and  social  development  in  Cambodia,  higher\nallocations to education are essential, and education policies need\nreform. The Government\u2019s policy priority for education is to ensure\nequitable access and quality improvement for nine years of basic\neducation  by  2010.  As  outlined  in  its  Education  Strategic  Plan\n(ESP)  2001-2005,  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  use  the\neducation  budget  as  a  means  to  implement  education  reforms,\nparticularly  to  ensure  pro-poor  policies  and  strategies  to  address\nissues  of  equitable  access,  quality,  and  efficiency  of\nthe \neducation.\n\nthat \n\nEnsuring equitable access, and improved quality and efficiency of\neducation  services,  requires  a  program  of  education  policies  that\nfocus  on  increased  pro-poor  allocations,  incentives  to  priority\ngroups,  education  service  rationalization,  decentralization  of\neducation  services,  and  sustainable  provision  of  quality  inputs,\nsupplemented  by  project  support  for  basic  education  facilities  in\npoor  and  remote  areas,  and  institutional  strengthening.  The  total\ncost  of  adjustments  to  be  carried  out  under  the  policy  packet  is\nestimated at $98 million for 2001-2005, and justifies the proposed\nsize of the policy loan of $20 million. The ESDP constitutes a key\nelement  of  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy,  which  supports  policy-\nbased  lending  and  approaches  that  address  policy  needs  in\ndecentralization,  quality  improvement,  and  financial  management\nand efficiency.\n\n\fClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nThe Sector Development Program\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nPolicy Framework and\nActions\n\nCapacity Building\n\niii\n\nA sectorwide approach, led by the Government, has been followed\nin  designing  the  ESDP  to  ensure  features  such  as  sustainable\npartnerships,  common  long-term  vision  and  agreed  targets  for\nreform,  comprehensive  sector  policy \neducation \nframework,\nformulation of a rolling program and process for reforms, forward\nwork  plan,  and  sector  performance  review  and  negotiation\nprocesses.\n\nPoverty intervention\nThematic: Human development\n\nCategory  C.  Environmental  implications  of  the  ESDP  were\nreviewed, and no significant adverse environmental impacts were\nidentified.\n\nThe overall objective of the ESDP is to contribute to Cambodia\u2019s\nbroader  poverty  reduction  policy  by  assisting  the  Government  to\nreform  and  strengthen  the  education  sector  as  outlined  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s  ESP.  The  ESDP  will  support  nationwide  policy\nreforms  related  to  education  sector  financing,  removal  of  access\nbarriers  to  education  for  poor  students,  improved  learning,  more\ntransparent  education  service  delivery,  and\nefficient  and \ndecentralized  management;  and  provide  investment  funds  to\nsupport  the  implementation  of  policies  designed  to  improve\nequitable access for underserved and disadvantaged populations\nas well as improved quality of education.\n\nThe  policy  component  promotes  policies  aimed  at  (i)  assuring\nincreased resource allocation to the education sector, (ii) increasing\nequitable  access  to  education  services,  (iii)  improving  quality  and\nefficiency of the sector, and (iv) enhancing managerial capacity at\nall levels and increasing the deconcentration of service delivery.\n\nCapacity  building support under the ESDP is comparatively  small,\nsince major support for sector management, priority action program\nimplementation,  and  quality  improvement  will  be  provided  through\nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  the  Swedish  International\nDevelopment  Cooperation  Agency.  Assistance  will  focus  on  (i)\nestablishing  deconcentrated  and  decentralized  mechanisms  for\neducation  facilities  development,  (ii)  establishing  an  effective\ninternal  accounting  and  audit  function  within  the  Ministry  of\nEducation,  Youth  and  Sport  (MOEYS)  to  ensure  compliance  with\nthe new government audit law, and (iii) institutional development for\nthe\ntechnical  and  vocational  education  and \nGovernment lacks the necessary expertise in these areas.\n\ntraining,  since \n\n\fThe Investment Project\n\niv\n\nThe  project  component  supplements  the  policy  initiatives  by\nsupporting  (i)  increased  access  and  equity,  mainly  for  basic\n(ii)  deconcentrated  and  decentralized  planning,\neducation; \nmanagement,  and  monitoring;  and  (iii)  selective  quality  and\nefficiency  improvement  in  budget  planning,  accounting,  and  audit,\nand  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training.  The  Project\nwill  provide  construction  of  facilities  in  remote  and  underserved\nareas, promote greater deconcentration of the planning of facilities\nprograms to provincial authorities and institutions, and pilot budget\nmanagement of facilities development in four provinces.\n\nPolicy reforms to be implemented under the ESDP will improve the\ntargeting  of  allocations  to  the  poor,  and  have  a  positive  social\nimpact  in  terms  of  poverty,  gender,  and  inclusion  of  ethnic\nminorities.  Through  policy  reforms,  the  cost  of  education  will  be\nreduced to parents; this will benefit poor students, girls, and ethnic\nminorities. The provision of more classrooms, and the introduction\nof  multigrade  approaches  into  primary  education  delivery  will\nenable  poor  children  to  complete  primary  education,  and  provide\nschools close to home, which benefits girls. Direct student support\nmechanisms  such  as  targeted  assistance  programs  will  make  it\neasier  for  girls  and  the  poor  to  attend  and  complete  primary  and\nsecondary education. Teacher performance and teaching quality in\nremote areas are expected to be enhanced by incentives for certain\ncategories  of \nteachers  serving  under  difficult  circumstances.\nRegional  discrepancies  in  education  finance  will  be  offset  through\npoverty-indexed  formulas  for  priority  action  programs  and  facilities\ndevelopment.\n\nA  loan  of  $20  million  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s\nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  24 years,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  of  1  percent\nper  annum  will  be  charged  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5\npercent thereafter.\n\nThe  period  of  the  policy  loan  is  from  December  2001  to  February\n2004. The loan will be disbursed in three tranches. The first tranche\nof  $10  million  will  be  available  for  disbursement  upon  loan\neffectiveness,  the  second  tranche  of  $5  million  will  be  released\nwithin  15  months  from  the  first  tranche  release,  and  the  third\ntranche  of  $5  million  within  12  months  of  the  second  tranche\nrelease,  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  specific  conditions\nindicated in the policy matrix.\n\nSocial and\nEnvironmental Measures\n\nThe Policy Loan\n\nLoan Amount and Terms\n\nProgram Period and\nTranching\n\n\fExecuting Agency\n\nv\n\nMOEYS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  the\nimplementation  of  policy  measures.

In  1999,  ADB  continued  its  education  sector  policy  support\nthrough  the  Secondary  Education  Investment  Plan  technical  assistance  (TA)1  that  helped  the\nMinistry  of  Education  Youth  and  Sport  (MOEYS)  to  formulate  a  pro-poor  education  policy  and\nstrategy.  In  2000,  ADB  provided  further  small-scale  TA2  to  assist  the  Government  prepare  a\ndetailed education sector analysis, followed by project preparatory TA3 to help MOEYS finalize\nan education strategic plan (ESP), identify and cost priority programs through the preparation of\nan education sector support program (ESSP), and design an ESDP to be financed by ADB. The\ncapacity  building  TAs  have  facilitated  thorough  MOEYS  and  stakeholder  participation,  and\nfostered strong ownership of the education reform policies and strategies. All through the policy\nand planning process, a sectorwide approach has been followed. This approach involved a wide\nrange of assistance agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), private sector, community\ngroups,  and  other  stakeholders  in  the  identification  and  design  of  education  reforms,  and\nsupported a move from \u201cdonorship to partnership.\u201d\n\n3.\nDuring  ADB\u2019s  loan  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  February/March  2001,  the  draft  ESP  was\ncirculated,  presented,  discussed,  and  revised  within  MOEYS.  A  sector  development  program\napproach  was  identified  as  the  most  effective  way  to  address  pro-poor  policy  reforms,\ninvestment, and capacity building needs. ADB\u2019s Appraisal Mission4 in June 2001 included a joint\nin-country  appraisal  of  the  ESP  and  ESSP  by  the  Government,  assistance  agencies,  and  the\nNGO  community.  MOEYS  formally  approved  the  ESP  and  ESSP  in  September  2001.  This\nreport is based on the findings of the series of ADB-supported TAs, and the Fact-Finding and\nAppraisal  missions\u2019  consultations  with  government  officials  in  MOEYS  and  other  relevant\nministries,  technical  departments  of  MOEYS,  and  multilateral  and  bilateral  funding  agencies,\nNGOs,  head  teachers,  and  members  of  communities.  The  ESDP  framework  is  given  in\nAppendix 1.\n\nA. \n\nMacroeconomic and Social Context\n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nWith  the  formation  of  the  coalition  Government  in  late  1998,  Cambodia  is  enjoying  the\n4.\nhighest  level  of  political  stability  in  30  years.  The  administration  has  made  poverty  reducing\neconomic  development  its  first  priority,  and  launched  a  comprehensive  reform  program,\nemphasizing  strengthening  fiscal  revenue  collection,  civil  service  reform,  demobilization  of\nsoldiers,  and  improved  forestry  resource  management.  Progress  in  moving  this  large  agenda\nforward has been assisted during the last three years by enhanced structural adjustment facility\n\n                  \n\n1 TA 3169-CAM: Secondary Education Investment Plan, for $650,000, approved on 8 March 1999.\n2 TA 3415-CAM: Education Strategy Support, for $150,000, approved on 15 March 2000.\n3 TA 3463-CAM: Education Sector Development Program, for $800,000, approved on 27 June 2000.\n4 The Mission comprised G. Forsberg, Sr. Education Specialist, Mission Leader; J. Daumas, Counsel; D. Porter, Sr.\nGovernance  Specialist;  C.  Wescott,  Sr.  Governance  Specialist;  E.  Bloom,  Economist,  Staff  Consultant;  M.\nMorrissey, Quality Improvement and Assurance Specialist, Staff Consultant; and A. Pichvai, Access and Facilities\nSpecialist, Staff Consultant.\n\n\f2\n\nsupport from the International Monetary Fund, focusing on fiscal reform, particularly in revenue\nmobilization.\n\n5.\nThe  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  a  rate  of  5.4  percent  in  2000.  The  growth\nwas lower compared with 1999 (6.9 percent) but was still impressive given the severe flooding\nin the final quarter of 2000, and negative growth in the agriculture, fisheries, and forestry sector.\nThe primary engine of growth in 2000 was the garments sector.\n\n6.\nFiscal  policy  remains  conservative,  with  improved  revenue  mobilization,  and  prudent\nexpenditure management. Revenue collection during 2000 continued to improve, with domestic\nrevenues increasing by 8 percent in 2000 compared with the previous year. Expenditures for the\nfour  priority  sectors  of  health,  education,  rural  development,  and  agriculture  increased  to  2.5\npercent  of  GDP,  while  defense  and  security  spending  fell  from  4.2  percent  in  1999,  to  3.5\npercent  in  2000.  Expenditure  plans  in  2001  reinforce  these  trends,  with  defense  and  security\nspending  falling  to  3  percent,  and  the  four  priority  sectors  increasing  to  4.7  percent.  The\nexchange  rate  has  remained  stable  at  around  KR3,700-3,800  to  the  dollar  for  the  last  three\nyears.\n\nExpenditure  on  social  sectors  has \n\n7.\nincreased  significantly.  Education  spending\nallocations  rose  from  $46  million  in  2000,  to  $57  million  in  2001,  representing  a  22  percent\nincrease. Health expenditure rose by 17 percent over the same period. The education share of\nrecurrent  spending  has  shown  a  significant  upward  trend,  rising  from  around  11.5  percent  in\n1999,  to  15.7  percent  in  2001.  In  October  2000,  the  Government  introduced  priority  action\nprograms  (PAPs)  for  rapid  delivery  of  funds  from  the  recurrent  budget  to  the  priority  sectors.\nUnder the 2001 budget, a planned $17 million will be available, representing 30 percent of the\ntotal health budget, and 9 percent of the total education budget.\n\n8.\nHigh population growth, high child mortality, low life expectancy, and high fertility rates\ncharacterize  the  demographic  indices.  A  20  percent  increase  in  population  over  the  next  10\nyears  is  anticipated;  this  will  fuel  demand  for  education  services  and  employment  generation.\nThe  labor  force  is  projected  to  grow  by  around  200,000  per  annum  by  2010.  Growing\nuncertainty in the labor market outlook exacerbates the situation. Although the tourism sector is\nshowing  promising  growth,  the  prospects  for  the  garment  industry  (a  recent  engine  of  job\ncreation  in  urban  areas)  is  somewhat  fragile.  Urban  and  rural  employment  pattern  vary\nsignificantly  with  over  60  percent  of  urban  workers  in  manufacturing  and  service  sectors,\ncompared  with  only  11  percent  in  rural  areas.  The  uncertain  labor  market  outlook  means  that\nmechanisms  need  to  be  put  in  place  to  increase  the  responsiveness  of  the  education  and\ntraining systems.\n\n9.\nVarious  assessments  point  to  extensive  levels  of  poverty  in  Cambodia.  The  poverty\nheadcount index in 1999 was an estimated 36 percent.5 Cambodia compares unfavorably with\nother Asian countries on broader human poverty indices. Cambodia\u2019s human poverty index, the\nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  index,  is  42.5  percent.6  This  figure  is  far  below  the\naverage score for Southeast Asia and the Pacific developing member countries of 25 percent.\nPoor  performances  in  primary  school  completion,  health  and  sanitation  service  access,  and\nchild  nutrition  indicators  are  major  contributing  factors  to  the  low  human  poverty  index  in\nCambodia.\n\n                  \n\n5  Ministry  of  Planning.  1999.  Cambodia Poverty Assessment.  Phnom  Penh.  Incidence  of  poverty  in  Cambodia  is\nbased  on  a  poverty  line,  defined  as  the  cash  equivalent  of  food  consumption  providing  at  least  2,100  calories  of\nenergy (plus 58 grams of protein) per person, per day, plus a small allowance for nonfood consumption to cover\nbasic items like clothing and shelter.\n\n6 UNDP. 1999. Cambodia Human Development Report 1999. Phnom Penh.\n\n\f3\n\n10.\nPoverty rates are highest in rural areas where about 90 percent of the poor live. Only 2.3\npercent of the poor live in the capital, Phnom Penh, and the remaining 7.7 percent are located in\nother urban and periurban areas. Average annual income in rural areas was less than one third\nof  Phnom  Penh  residents  (rural  $197  per  annum;  Phnom  Penh  $691  per  annum).7  Other\nindicators  reinforce  these  wide  disparities.  Per  capita  consumption  by  urban  dwellers  is  twice\nthat  of  rural  people.  Urban  residents  have  an  additional  five  years  life  expectancy,  and  higher\nlevels  of  education  attainment.  Also,  Phnom  Penh  residents  spend  12  times  as  much  on\neducation as the rural population.\n\nPoverty is a major constraint to the level of education students can achieve. One reason\n11.\nis  the  fact  that  overall  financing  of  the  education  system  is  still  heavily  reliant  on  households\u2019\nprivate  contributions  to  education  costs.  Socioeconomic  surveys  report  that,  on  average,\nunofficial monthly school fees are KR3,500 ($0.9) per pupil at primary level, KR8,000 ($2.0) at\nlower  secondary,  and  KR10,200  ($2.6)    at  upper  secondary  level.  At  the  postsecondary  level,\nthe  private  contributions  are  significantly  higher,  especially  in  urban  areas.  As  a  result,  the\nrepresentation  of  the  poor  is  much  greater  in  the  primary  student  population,  than  in  the\nsecondary or tertiary student population. While 20 percent of primary students are drawn from\nthe poorest 20 percent of the population, only 2 percent of upper secondary students are drawn\nfrom this quintile. In contrast, 61 percent of the upper secondary students in the country come\nfrom the richest 20 percent of the population. The poor are not represented in tertiary education,\nwhile the richest 20 percent of the population accounts for 57 percent.\n\n12.\nThe  representation  of  females  in  the  education  system  indicates  further  significant\ninequities. In particular, proportion of girls enrolled drops significantly in the higher grades of the\nprimary  school  system.  Girls  represent  only  one  third  of  enrolment  in  secondary  schools.\nFemales  are  also  significantly  underrepresented  in  technical  and  higher  education.  This  is  the\nresult of a combination of social, cultural, and economic factors. One important reason for the\nunderrepresentation  of  girls  in  secondary  and  higher  education  is  related  to  access.  Only  a\nlimited  number  of  villages  have  secondary  schools,  so  attendance  means  traveling  long\ndistances. Boys have the option of staying in nearby pagodas, but no separate dormitories are\nprovided  for  girls.  Secondly,  although  girls  enroll  at  roughly  the  same  age  as  boys,  earlier\ndropout  occurs  with  the  onset  of  puberty,  and  as  family  responsibilities  begin  to  predominate.\nParents\u2019 perceptions of the relevance and return of girls\u2019 education, as well as cost of education,\nare  other  factors.  Parents  are  reported  to  often  be  less  willing  to  invest  in  educating  females,\nwhich is a critical factor when parental contributions are a large share of education spending.\n\n13.\nOther social dimensions, especially child health and nutrition, and the potential impact of\nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) also have an\neffect on education achievement. Child malnutrition has remained more or less constant at 40\npercent during the past decade. Almost one fifth of children suffer from severe malnutrition. In\naddition,  roughly  70  percent  of  the  population  has  no  access  to  safe  water,  and  about  85\npercent  have  inadequate  sanitation.  HIV  prevalence,  currently  estimated  at  3.75  percent  of\nadults  aged  15-49,  has  potentially  great  significance  for  long-term  teaching  service  planning.\nHIV/AIDS will contribute to growing attrition rates and absenteeism in the teaching service and\ncould add significantly to teaching service, and teacher training costs.\n\nB. \n\nSector Description and Recent Performance\n\n14.\nThe education system in Cambodia consists of six years of primary, three years of lower\nsecondary,  and  three  years  of  upper  secondary  schooling.  In  addition,  the  public-private\npartnership  in  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET)  is  active  and  growing\n\n7  Ministry  of  Planning.  1998.

Higher education may also be characterized as an expanding public-\nprivate partnership subsector, with the introduction of a number of private universities in recent\nyears.  The  Government  and  NGOs  cooperate  in  the  provision  of  literacy  programs,\ncomplementary programs for school dropouts, and (largely urban-based) preschooling.\n\nMOEYS  consists  of  the  central  office,  24  provincial  education  offices,  and  182  district\n15.\neducation  offices,  which  are  looking  after  about  6,500  schools.  Over  the  past  decade,  the\nprimary  mission  of  the  central  MOEYS  office  has  been  to  exercise  control  of  MOEYS\noperations,  with  a  focus  on  administration.  Delegation  to  line  departments,  provincial,  and\ndistrict  authorities  has  been  limited.  In  2000,  the  Government  introduced  a  PAP  for  primary\neducation,  which  is  now  also  being  implemented  for  lower  secondary  education.  PAP  funds\ncome from the recurrent budget, and are currently being used for (i) school operating budgets\nfor primary and lower secondary schools, (ii) remedial classes for primary school students, and\n(iii) strengthening of technical and financial monitoring. Through the PAP mechanism, funds flow\nfrom  the  central  Government  treasury  to  district  accounts  held  in  the  provincial  treasury,  and\nonward  to  schools.  The  introduction  of  the  PAPs  is  providing  an  opportunity  to  rationalize\norganizational structures and responsibilities within MOEYS to make the system more efficient.\nThe  mechanism  is  helping  the  MOEYS  central  office  to  assume  its  more  proper  role  of\npolicymaking, strategic planning, and monitoring. Provincial offices are beginning to take on the\nrole  of  progress  monitoring,  while  districts  and  schools  are  responsible  for  day-to-day\nmanagement of PAP funds.\n\n16.\nEducation  achievements  over  the  past  five  years  are  significant.  Currently  874\ngovernment  preschools  and  364  community  and  private  preschools  are  operating.  Attendance\nat  community  schools  is  generally  free,  compared  with  urban-based  private  preschools,  which\nlevy  a  small  charge.  The  primary  cycle  has  been  extended  from  five  to  six  years  from  1996.\nPrimary school enrolment grew from 1.6 million in 1998 to 2.4 million in 2001, and about 500-\n600 schools were newly constructed or extended. Secondary school enrolment grew from about\n280,000  to  about  380,000.  Quality  improvement  achievements  include  provision  of  free\ntextbooks  for  grades  1  to  9  from  1997  (supported  by  ADB),  accompanied  by  various  forms  of\ntraining  and  upgrading  for  around  60,000  teachers.  MOEYS  is  planning  to  commercialize\ntextbook procurement by transforming the MOEYS publishing house into a public enterprise in\nearly  2002,  linked  to  strengthening  textbook  supply  planning,  procurement,  and  monitoring\nmechanisms. The Government is also committed to introduce a sustainable textbook financing\nsystem, through annual recurrent budget allocations, from 2002.\n\n17.\nThese  achievements  in  primary  and  secondary  education  have  been  accompanied  by\nincreasing  growth  in  the  public-private  partnership  in  higher  education,  and  TVET.  While\nparticipation in higher education is low, by international standards, at 204 students per 100,000\npeople, the Government\u2019s policy of promoting public-private partnerships in higher education is,\nhowever,  showing  encouraging  gains.  In  1999,  the  total  enrolment  was  around  22,000,  with\nabout  two  thirds  of  the  students  paying  fees  in  public  institutions,  or  enrolled  in  private\nuniversities. In 1999, the total enrolment in TVET was estimated at 93,000. Enrolment in public\ninstitutions  was  around  5,700,  private  institutions  around  68,000,  and  in  NGO-supported\noperations around 10,000 students. In addition, 9,300 students are enrolled in National Training\nFund  (NTF)  programs,  which  are  open  to  both  public  and  private  providers.  Hence,  private\nproviders, including NGOs, provide over 80 percent of current TVET provision.\n\n18.\nTeacher training is currently provided at 18 provincial teacher training colleges (PTTCs)\nfor the primary program; six regional teacher training colleges (RTTCs), which train grades 7-9\nteachers;  and  the  postgraduate  program  at  the  Faculty  of  Pedagogy,  which  trains  university\ngraduates  as  upper  secondary  school  teachers.  PTTCs  and  RTTCs  offer  two-year  programs,\nwith  an  annual  graduate  output  of  around  2,950  and  1,000  students  respectively.  The  faculty\noffers a one-year program with an output of around 400 students per annum.\n\n\f5\n\nThe  level  of  adult  illiteracy  is  high  in  regional  terms.  While  the  adult  literacy  rate  is\n19.\nestimated at 68 percent (1998), a recent literacy survey (2000) estimated that 36 percent of the\npopulation  (around  2.4  million  adults)  is  illiterate  and  27  percent  are  semiliterate  (1.7  million\nadults). On this basis, only 36 percent of the population is literate in terms of being able to use\ntheir  literacy  skills  for  everyday  life  and  income  generation.  Adult  literacy  classes  need  to  be\nexpanded, especially for disadvantaged groups, and in underserved areas. MOEYS is currently\ndeveloping a five-year strategic plan, aimed at increasing functional literacy from the estimated\n36 percent to 56 percent over the next five years.\n\nC.\n\nGovernment Expenditure\n\n20.\nBy regional comparison, Cambodia\u2019s education sector was underresourced in the 1990s.\nPublic  spending  on  education  has  remained  more  or  less  constant  at  between  0.9  and  1.0\npercent  of  GDP  since  1994.  This  is  significantly  below  the  levels  in  the  region  (e.g.,  Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic 3.1 percent, Bangladesh 2.8 percent, Nepal 3.2 percent). Since\n1999,  the  education  share  of  GDP  has,  however,  grown  significantly(cid:190)\nfrom  to  1.3  percent  in\n1999 to 1.6 percent in 2001. This is consistent with Government commitments at the 2000 and\n2001 Consultative Group meetings in Paris and Tokyo to increase social sector spending These\npatterns  are  mirrored  by  recurrent  spending  on  education,  where  the  share  of  recurrent\nspending  remained  at  9- 10  percent  between  1994  and  1998,  but  which  has  risen  to  15.7\npercent in 2001. A key prerequisite is effective channeling and disbursement of education funds\nfrom  the  Government  treasury  to  the  central  education  ministry  and  provincial  governments.\nComparatively high disbursement figures have been maintained over the last few years, with an\neducation  budget  outturn  of  96  percent  in  2000,  compared  with  90  percent  for  the  overall\nbudget.\n\n21.\nThe  Government  has  also  addressed,  to  some  extent,  inequitable  public  spending\npatterns for the subsectors. In 1997, only about 40 percent of recurrent spending was devoted\nto  primary  education,  compared  with  15  percent  for  secondary  and  30  percent  for\npostsecondary education.8 Much of this distortion was due to substantial external assistance for\nhigher education and TVET. The situation changed in 1998 and 1999, with public spending on\nprimary and secondary education averaging around 80 to 85 percent. Simultaneously, external\nassistance has shifted to providing a greater share for basic education, i.e., primary and lower\nsecondary  education.  A  recent  MOEYS  analysis  of  externally  assisted  prospects  suggest  this\ntrend is continuing, with around 85 percent of scheduled or potential external assistance being\ndirected at basic education.\n\n22.\nPublic expenditure per student has also been inequitable. In 1997, spending per primary\nstudent  was  around  KR63,000,  of  which  public  spending  was  KR30,000  (47  percent).  In\ncontrast, per student spending on TVET was about KR560,000, with public spending accounting\nfor  KR446,000  (80  percent).  These  patterns  are  not  equitable  or  pro-poor,  given  the\nunderrepresentation  of  students  from  poorer  families  at  later  stages  of  the  education  system.\nRecent  spending  patterns  are  addressing  these  inequities.  In  2001,  the  public  spending  per\nprimary  student  rose  to  around  KR90,000  per  annum,  while  the  figure  for  higher  and\npostsecondary  education  fell  to  KR300,000  per  student  per  year.  Hence,  public  spending  on\neducation is showing an increasingly pro-poor trend, which is projected to continue in 2002 and\nbeyond.\n\n8  World Bank. 1999. Public Expenditure Review. Washington, D.C.\n\n                  \n\n\f6\n\nD.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n1.\n\nFinancing\n\nThe  core  education  sector  issue  is  to  raise  the  overall  level  of  public  sector  financing\n23.\nfrom  the  1.6  percent  in  2001,  to  2.4  percent  of  GDP  by  2005,  while  reducing  dependency  on\nexternal funding sources. To reduce the dependency in the coming decade, the Government will\nhave  to  increase  public  financing  to  achieve  universal  basic  education  by  2010,  put  in  place\nmechanisms  to  provide  the  poor  with  equitable  access  to  education  services,  and  satisfy  the\nincreasing public demand for quality education services at all levels, especially upper secondary\nand  postsecondary  education.  This  will  require  not  only  increased  volumes  of  public  spending\non  basic  education,  but  also  improved  quality  and  effectiveness  of  spending  through  an\nincreased  share  for  nonsalary  expenditures.  A  related  policy  issue  will  be  to  protect  public\nspending  on  basic  education,  through  a  well-planned  and  regulated  financing  policy  and\nstrategy for upper secondary, TVET, and higher education provision.\n\nLow  education  expenditures  in  the  1990s  increased  reliance  on  parental  and  external\n24.\ncontributions. For example, the public expenditure review of 1998 estimated that almost half (46\npercent) of education expenditure was provided by funding agencies and NGOs, compared with\nGovernment  (27  percent)  and  private  households  (27  percent).  This  significant  public-private\npartnership  with  communities  in  education  has  merit  in  terms  of  stakeholder  participation  and\npotential  for  mutual  accountability.  However,  the  private  cost  of  education  also  acts  as  a\ndeterrent  for  poor  parents.  Furthermore,  no  clear  regulatory,  accounting,  and  management\nmechanisms  are  available  for  the  substantial  private  contributions.  Most  of  these  transactions\nbetween parents, schools, and teachers are made in the form of informal payments (in addition\nto  unofficial  school  fees).  As  a  consequence,  these  resources  are  not  effectively  captured  or\nmanaged as part of financing the operations of the education system.\n\n2.\n\nAccess\n\n25.\nThe  second  issue  relates  to  access,  especially  by  the  poor,  females,  and  ethnic\nminorities.9  Preschool  education  is  accessed  by  only  5  percent.  Net  enrolment  in  primary\neducation  is  78  percent,  in  lower  secondary  education  14  percent,  in  upper  secondary  9\npercent,  and  TVET  and  higher  education  less  than  1  percent.  While  the  Government  has\nachieved significant expansion of primary education in the past decade, with enrolment growing\nabout 70 percent between 1992 and 1999, strategies are needed to address significant gender\ndisparities in access, directly linked to urban and rural location. Noticeable is also the decline in\ngirls\u2019  enrolment  across  primary  grades,  where  girls\u2019  share  of  the  total  enrolment  falls  from  47\npercent in grade 1, to 33 percent in grade 6. Overall, at the primary level, the poorest children,\ngirls,  and  ethnic  minorities  are  more  likely  to  enroll  later  and  drop  out  earlier  for  social  and\nfinancial  reasons.  Also,  since  47  percent  of  the  primary  schools  in  Cambodia  are  incomplete,\ni.e., they do not offer all six grades, many children, especially ethnic minority girls, only attend\nthe first two or three grades and then drop out.\n\nGender and geographical inequities in enrolment in secondary education are significant.\n26.\nFemales represent only one third of both lower and upper secondary enrolment. Another access\nconstraint,  especially  in  districts  with  scattered  secondary-age  population,  is  the  cost  or\nshortage of school transportation, lodging facilities, or dormitories. Traveling distances of more\nthan  5  km  to  lower  or  upper  secondary  schools  is  identified  as  an  access  barrier. Significant\nurban-rural and gender disparities also prevail in higher education. About 45 percent of students\n\n9 This refers to the highland ethnic minorities mainly found in the northeast provinces. It does not include Chinese,\n\n                  \n\nVietnamese, and Lao minorities.\n\n\f7\n\nin  public  institutions  come  from  Phnom  Penh,  and  40  percent  come  from  the  more  urban\nprovinces. Virtually no students come from the poorer, more rural, and remote provinces.\n\n27.\nAvailability  of  teachers  is  a  critical  issue  to  ensure  equitable  access  to  education.\nCurrently, some schools have an oversupply of teachers, while rural remote and ethnic minority\nareas have a severe shortage. An important priority is to strengthen teacher supply and demand\nplanning,  in  consultation  with  central  and  provincial  personnel  departments.  In  the  short  term,\nadditional trained teacher output can be achieved by massive redeployment of nonteaching staff\nback to the classroom. An action plan for meeting these teacher development demands needs\nto be prepared.\n\n28.\nA  related  access  issue  is  the  improvement  in  the  living  conditions  of  the  education\nservice  staff,  especially  the  teaching  service,  and  measures  to  ensure  availability  of  good\nteachers  in  poor,  remote  areas.  It  has  been  documented  internationally  that  low  salaries\ncontribute to poor teacher attendance, and considerable time spent on other income generating\nactivities. In Cambodia, primary school teachers earn between $9-13 per month, and secondary\nschool  teachers  $11-16  per  month,  not  enough  to  feed  a  family.  The  low  salaries  result  in\npressure  on  parents  and  students  to  provide  informal  payments  for  private  tuition.  Targeted\nincentives  are  also  needed  for  head    teachers,  multigrade  teachers,  and  staff  deployed  to\nremote schools. A key strategy is to continue to promote substantial teacher salary increases as\npart  of  a  broader  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  the  national  public  administration  reform\n(NPAR), and find ways to offset informal payments to teachers from poor families. To address\nincentives  for  special  core  groups,  a  salary  reform  action  plan  needs  to  be  immediately\ndeveloped  to  link  incentives  and  rewards  to  quality  and  efficiency  gains.  MOEYS  prepared  an\ninitial  action  plan  in  mid  2001.  The  speed  of  implementation  will  depend  on  the  outcomes  of\nbroader NPAR discussions and available resources.\n\n3.\n\nQuality and Efficiency\n\nMOEYS  recognizes  that  the  quality  of  both  primary  and  secondary  education  is  low,\n29.\npartly due to low instructional hours, and a curriculum that does not focus enough on teaching\ncore  subjects.  Minimum  learning  standards  have  not  been  defined  for  primary  education,  and\nstandardized, grade-referenced achievement tests do not exist. Therefore reliably assessing the\nquality  and  effectiveness  of  primary  education  is  difficult.  A  proxy  indicator  is  the  progression\nrate  from  grade  4,  based  on  teachermade  and  marked  tests.10  The  overall  achievement  was\nabout  72  percent  in  1997/98.  Effective  student  performance  monitoring  and  assessment\nsystems  at  various  levels  need  therefore  be  developed.  Currently,  student  performance\nmonitoring  is  limited  to  a  provincially  managed,  grade  9  achievement  test  (largely  used  to\nallocate  grade  10  places),  a  grade  12  examination,  and  various  university  faculty  admission\ntests administered by individual institutions.\n\nSignificant  effort  and  investments  have  been  expended  to  upgrade  the  quality  of  the\n30.\nprimary  teaching  service.  In  1996,  the  entry  qualifications  to  the  teaching  service  were\nincreased  to  12  years  of  schooling,  and  2  years  of  teacher  training  (in  cities  and  towns),  and\n9+2 for candidates from remote areas. By 1999, over 90 percent of teachers had the required\nacademic  qualifications.  However,  for  the  remote  areas,  the  figure  was  only  71  percent.  A\nvicious  circle  remains  in  place  where  poor  quality  primary  education,  and  limited  access  to\nsecondary  education,  means  that  few  teachers  from  remote  areas  are  qualified  for  entry  into\nteachers  colleges.  Posting  and  retraining  better-qualified  teachers  from  towns  to  rural  areas\nremains a problem due to inadequate incentives.\n\n                  \n\n10 Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. 1999. Education for All (EFA) \u2013 Year 2000 Assessment. Country Report by\n\nNational EFA 2000 Assessment Group. Phnom Penh.\n\n\f8\n\n31.\nOther  proxy  indicators  of  quality  and  efficiency  are  repetition  and  survival  rates.  A\nsignificant efficiency constraint is the high level of repetition, particularly in grades 1 and 2. For\nexample,  in  1998  the  overall  repetition  rates  were  41  percent  and  25  percent  in  the  first  two\ngrades, falling to around 4 to 8 percent in grades 5 and 6. In 2000, the average net enrolment\nrate  was  78  percent,  meaning  that  22  children  of  every  100  were  not  enrolled  at  the  official\nschool age of six. In remote areas, the net enrolment falls as low as 34 percent. Late enrollment\nhas  significant  impact  on  girls,  who  traditionally  leave  school  at  puberty.  Furthermore,  the\ncompletion rate for primary school students is only 45 percent. As a result of high repetition and\ndropout  rates,  about  14  years  are  currently  required  to  produce  a  graduate  from  the  six-year\nprimary program.11\n\n32.\nAn  efficiency  priority  is  to  improve  the  deployment  of  secondary  teaching,  and\nnonteaching  staff.  The  average  student:teacher  ratio  is  16.4  for  lower  secondary  schools,  and\n23.1 for upper secondary schools. The student per staff ratios (including nonteaching staff) are\n13.4  and  15.8  respectively,  highlighting  the  large  proportion  of  nonteaching  staff  in  secondary\nschools.  In  contrast,  the  student  per  class  ratios  were  38  and  44  respectively  for  lower  and\nupper secondary schools, once again highlighting the low teaching hours of secondary school\nstaff and inefficient teacher and nonteacher deployment\n\n4.\n\nSector Planning, Management and Decentralization\n\nThe fourth set of constraints is the weakness in sector planning and management, and\n33.\nthe  need  to  promote  decentralization  in  education  services  provision.  Until  1998,  MOEYS\nplanning  for  education  consisted  of  a  rather  rigid  sector  investment  plan,  made  up  of  discrete\nprojects,  within  some  broad  program  themes.  MOEYS  now  recognizes  the  need  for  a  much\nbroader interpretation of sector planning, where education planning is linked with medium-term\nexpenditure  planning,  public  investment  planning,  decentralization  plans,  and  public  service\nreform. Furthermore, the sector and financing plans need to be underpinned by a strong sector\nperformance monitoring system.\n\n34.\nA constraint on planning, managing, and implementing education governance reforms is\nthe  absence  of  strong  institutions  at  various  levels.  The  central  MOEYS  has  only  limited\ncapacity for formulating appropriate legislation and regulations within the designated Directorate\nGeneral for Administration and Finance. At the school level, the school and parents committees\nhave  responsibilities,  but  no  real  authority,  mainly  being  restricted  to  fundraising.  In  the  TVET\nand  higher  education  institutions,  there  are  no  boards  of  management  with  broad-based\nrepresentation; instead, governance and management responsibilities are combined under the\nresponsibilities  of  institutions'  directors  who  are  MOEYS  employees.  Governance  reforms  are\ntherefore a crucial element of education plans for the next decade.\n\n35.\nThe new education policy and institutional reforms will require the delegation of planning\nand resource management to the provinces and communes; capacity and structures have to be\nbuilt  to  enable  this.  The  introduction  of  the  PAP  in  2000  has  provided  an  opportunity  to\nrationalize organizational structures and responsibilities. A key priority will therefore be to build\nup  the  capacity  of  the  central  ministry,  provinces,  and  districts  in  planning  and  monitoring.\nSimultaneously,  capacity  building  in  management  and  implementation  planning  at  commune\nand school levels will be critical. A key reform component will be to put in place organizational\nstructures  and  responsibilities  that  provide  effective  impact  and  progress  monitoring  on\neducation system performance.\n\n                  \n\n11 The formula builds in the number of repeaters and dropouts to determine the average number of years required to\ncomplete  a  cycle.  If  two  students  start  a  year,  and  one  drops  out  halfway,  the  graduating  student  will  be  said  to\nhave consumed TWO student years, although s/he personally did not drop out.\n\n\f9\n\n36.\nStrategies  and  guidelines  have  to  be  established  for  increasing  the  operational\nautonomy of all public education institutions, including schools, teacher training colleges, higher\neducation  institutions,  and  TVET  institutions.  MOEYS  has  recognized  the  value  of  learning\nlessons  from  the  growing  number  of  private  providers.  Priority  needs  include  (i)  setting  out\nappropriate enabling legislation and regulation of both public and private institutions; (ii) putting\nin place appropriate financial management and accounting capability for both private and public\ninstitutions;  and  (iii)  putting  in  place  appropriate  institutional  arrangements  for  a  mix  of  self\nregulation  and  external  quality  control  and  monitoring,  including  well-defined  roles  for  MOEYS\ndepartments,  especially  in  higher  education,  and  TVET,  where  private  provision  is  most\nadvanced.\n\n37.\nA final issue to be addressed for improved education resource management is effective\ndeployment  of  the  education  service,  especially  primary  and  secondary  school  teachers.\nCurrently, there are about 45,000 primary school teachers, 17,500 secondary school teachers,\nand 10,000 nonteaching staff in schools. Approximately 3,100 education staff in provincial and\ndistrict  education  offices  supplement  these.  A  priority  is  therefore  to  undertake  a  thorough\nreview  of  MOEYS  guidelines  for  staff  deployment,  possibly  introducing  student:teacher  ratio\nbased staffing norms.\n\nE.\n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\nThe  Government  has  made  poverty  reduction  its  first  priority.  Extensive,  quantitative\n38.\nanalysis  of  poverty  has  been  conducted  through  regular  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  by  the\nWorld  Food  Programme\u2019s  poverty  mapping.  This  analysis  has  been  complemented  by  a\nparticipatory poverty assessment carried out in 154 villages in 24 provinces and municipalities,\nand among 15 nonrural socioeconomic groups. The participatory poverty assessment confirms\nthat  people  lack  access  to  social  infrastructure  and  other  basic  services;  the  poor  are\ndisempowered, and feel hopeless about their lives and those of their children; and women suffer\nfrom low socioeconomic status.\n\n39.\nThe  Government  has  prepared  the  Interim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  and  the\nSecond  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2001-2005  both  with  ADB  support.  One  important\nstrategy  to  empower  the  poor  will  be  achieved  by  increasing  their  access  to  health  and\neducation  services,  by  increasing  and  redirecting  public  expenditure  on  health  and  education.\nThe  Government  also  acknowledges  that  good  governance  is  a  prerequisite  to  sustainable\nsocioeconomic  development  and  social  justice.  Low  salaries  are  a  fundamental  structural\nproblem  in  the  public  sector,  hence  civil  service  reform,  and  increased  salaries  are  necessary\nfor  improving  governance.  The  Governance  Action  Plan  has  been  adopted,  and  the  reforms\ninclude  areas  such  as  civil  service  reform  (including  decentralization),  public  management\nreform, anticorruption measures, promotion of  gender equity, and demobilization of the armed\nforces. During the first year of implementation of the Second Socioeconomic Development Plan,\nthe  Government  will  focus  on  establishing  priority  groups  of  civil  servants  who  will  receive\nenhanced  remuneration,  and  deconcentration  and  decentralization12  of  government  and  public\nservice delivery, including defining the functions and roles for different levels of staff down to the\ncommune  level;  new  systems  for  decentralized  financing,  planning,  and  management;  and\ntraining of personnel.\n\n                  \n\n12 In  Cambodia,  \"decentralization\"  refers  to  the  design  and  management  of  elected  commune  councils,  and\n\"deconcentration\"  the  delegation  of  central  ministry  functions  to  provincial  authorities.  Reforms  leading  to\ndecentralization  are  the  responsibility  of  the  National  Committee  to  Support  Communes  in  coordination  with  the\nMinistry of Interior. Reforms leading to deconcentration are led by the Council for Administrative Reform and the\nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  in  coordination  with  relevant  sector  ministries  and  provincial  authorities.\nGovernment  policy  recognizes \nimplementation  of\ndecentralization and deconcentration reforms, and that decentralization of government to the communes will only\nwork if supporting functions are also deconcentrated to the provinces and districts.\n\nthe  essential  complementarity, \n\nfor  parallel \n\nthe  need \n\n\f10\n\nReforms already underway include (i) drafting of legislation governing security of public\n40.\naccess  to  land,  forests,  and  water  resource  management;  (ii)  design  of  improved  budget\nexecution  and  medium-term  expenditure  framework;  and  (iii)  implementation  of  the  Audit  Law\nthrough the National Audit Authority. ADB is supporting these state reforms  through economic\nand sector work, TA and loan projects.13\n\n41.\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  the  education  system  represents  an  important  bridge\nbetween  economic  and  social  development.  It  has  taken  several  initiatives  that  provide  a\nplatform  for  education  development  to  be  strongly  linked  to  state  reforms  and  overall  poverty\nreduction. In early 1999, the Government established high level consultative groups to address\nfiscal and financial reform, administration reform, governance reform, and social sector reform.\nThese  mechanisms  are  providing  a  vehicle  for  incorporating  education  policy  reform  into\nbroader macroeconomic and institutional programs.\n\n42.\nThese  Government  initiatives  have  coincided  with  a  revitalized  education  reform\nprocess.  In  mid-1999,  MOEYS  initiated  a  policy  review  and  development  process  for  the\neducation  sector  that  takes  a  broader  and  more  comprehensive  approach  to  education\ndevelopment.14  The  process,  led  by  the  Government  and  endorsed  by  development  agencies,\nincorporates  sectorwide  approach  features  such  as  (i)  sector  analysis;  (ii)  development  of  a\ncomprehensive  policy \nframework,  strategies,  and  a  support  program  (budgetary  and\ninvestment);  (iii)  focus  on  sector  performance  monitoring,  with  emphasis  on  outcomes;  (iv)  an\norganizational  framework  for  aid  coordination;  (v)  regular  Government-financing  agency\nperformance reviews; and (vi) rolling adjustments of programs and plans (for further description\nof the sectorwide approach, see Appendix 2. The process culminated in the approved ESP and\nESSP  in  September  2001.  The  ESP  is  cast  within  the  Government\u2019s  broader  commitments  to\nstate reform outlined above. The ESP is further linked to Cambodia\u2019s commitment to achieving the\ninternational  development  goals,  and  education  for  all  by  2015.  A  summary  of  ESP  policy\npriorities, targets, monitoring mechanisms, and PAPs is in Appendix 3.\n\n43.\nThe Government\u2019s stated policy priorities for education are to ensure that poor students,\ngirls, and ethnic minorities have equitable access to basic, and postbasic education. A priority\nobjective is to achieve universal basic education by 2010 by expanding services, and improving\ninternal efficiency, especially reduced repetition rates. A second priority is to improve the quality\nand  management  of  education  by  increasing  nonsalary  spending,  and  improving  the  use  of\nteaching and nonteaching staff. A third priority is to strengthen public-private partnerships in the\nsector, especially in upper secondary, TVET, and higher education. A cross-cutting theme is to\nstrengthen legislative, and regulatory frameworks for quality assurance, and sector performance\nmonitoring across all subsectors.\n\n44.\nA  PAP  mechanism  was  introduced  to  ensure  financing  of  education  priority  strategies.\nOne  education  priority  strategy  is  to  increase  operating  budgets  for  schools,  TVET,  and  higher\neducation  institutions,  to  reduce  the  cost  of  schooling  for  poor  families  (for  other  PAP  priorities,\nsee  Appendix  3).  To  realize  this  pro-poor  education  policy,  the  Government  is  committed  to\nincreasing the annual recurrent budget from 1.3 percent of GDP in 2000, to 1.9 percent of GDP in\n2004.  A  second  priority  is  to  ensure  quality  improvement  by  increasing  recurrent  spending  on\ninstructional  materials,  and  teacher  development,  as  well  as  to  provide  performance-based\nincentives  for  core  groups  of  teachers,  and  head  teachers.  A  related  strategy  is  to  improve  the\n\n                  \n\n13 ADB  and  Cambodia  Development  Resource  Institute.  2001.  Cambodia: Enhancing Governance for Sustainable\nDevelopment.

MOEYS  and\nprovincial  education  offices  are  required  to  focus  on  planning  and  monitoring,  and  the  district\noffices and institutions have greater operational autonomy for management and implementation.\nThese  changes  will  require  extensive  capacity  building  in  technical  and  financial  planning,\nmanagement, and monitoring.\n\nF. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n1. \n\nExternal Assistance\n\n46.\nIn  the  early  and  mid-1990s,  average  external  assistance  to  the  education  sector  was\naround  $35  million-40  million  per  year.  After  the  political  crisis  in  1997,  education  aid\ncommitments and flows tightened, with projected levels of support at only $5 million-10 million\nper year from 2001 to 2003. The aid profile in the mid-1990s was characterized by a large share\nfor  TVET  and  higher  education  (around  40  percent),  and  limited  support  for  basic  education.\nSince  the  mid-1990s,  the  proportion  of  external  support  for  primary  and  secondary  education\nhas  gradually  increased.  The  major  external  financiers  for  basic  education  have  been  the\nEuropean  Union  (EU),  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida)  through\nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and ADB. The EU has supported primary schools\nconstruction,  and  teacher  training  programs.  UNICEF  is  financing  capacity  building  for  basic\neducation,  e.g.,  curriculum  and  textbook  development,  education  management  information\nsystems,  and  early  childhood  development.  The  World  Bank  supports  a  primary  education\nlearning and innovation project\u2014the Education Quality Improvement Project.\n\n47.\nFor postbasic education, the Australian Agency for International Development is providing\nscholarships, and helping develop national examinations. France and the United Kingdom support\nlanguage projects. The Japan International Cooperation Agency is supporting training projects in\nupper  secondary  and  higher  education,  and  TVET.  A  large  number  of  international  NGOs  are\nsupporting a variety of programs, ranging from early childhood programs to TVET. The amount,\nand  coverage  are,  however,  small.  A  list  of  assistance  to  the  education  sector  provided  by\nexternal agencies is in Appendix 4.\n\n48.\nDuring  the  1990s,  education  assistance  shifted  significantly  away  from  NGOs  and\nbilateral agencies, to greater involvement of the multilateral agencies, especially ADB. This shift\ncoincided  with  increased  support  for  primary  education,  instructional  materials,  and  capacity\nbuilding. Another characteristic of external assistance has been a growing emphasis on short-\nterm capacity building TA, rather than long-term project implementation advisers.\n\n49.\nADB has been the lead financing agency in the education sector in Cambodia since the\nearly  1990s,  and  supported  four  education  projects.  The  first  project,  the  Special  Rehabilitation\nAssistance  Project,15  which  helped  upgrade  selected  educational  facilities,  was  successfully\ncompleted in 1996. The Basic Skills Project,16 has largely completed the expansion of provincial\nTVET centers, stimulated private TVET providers by supporting the establishment of the National\nTraining Board, and the NTF, and building MOEYS capacity to plan, manage, and monitor TVET\nprograms. The NTF is now providing resources to various public, and private training providers for\nskills training.\n\n                  \n\n15 Loan 1199-CAM(SF), Special Rehabilitation Assistance, for $67.7 million, approved on 26 November 1992.\n16 Loan 1368-CAM(SF): Basic Skills,  for $20 million, approved on 30 August 1995.\n\n\f12\n\nThe  Basic  Education  Textbook  Project,17  rated  as  highly  successful,  has  been  providing\n50.\ncore textbooks of improved quality for all primary and lower secondary school students, improved\nprocurement and distribution systems, and strengthened publishing and research capacity. Policy\nreforms  include  reorganizing  MOEYS  publishing  structure  to  a  more  market-oriented  publishing\nsystem,  and  developing  legislative  and  regulatory  frameworks.  Satisfactory  progress  has  been\nmade  in  both  areas.  The  two  projects  will  be  completed  in  2001.  As  a  response  to  physical\ninfrastructure damaged by the 2000 floods, ADB is providing the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation\nProject18  loan to help restore facilities, including education facilities.\n\nThe  capacity  building  focus  of  the  ADB-supported  education  TA  programs  has  also\n51.\nresulted in positive outcomes. The various advisory TA have contributed to the strengthening of\nplanning and monitoring capacity for women in education, employment generation strategy, and\nTVET, and textbooks program planning and management. In addition, ADB has contributed to\nthe strengthening of MOEYS aid planning, management, and monitoring systems from the mid-\n1990s.  Currently,  ADB  is  providing  significant  support  to  improve  governance  in  Cambodia,\nincluding  financial  management  and  public  administration.  This  complementary  assistance  will\nhelp  strengthen  the  public  administration  and  financial  system  reforms  undertaken  under  the\nESDP.\n\n52.\nADB\u2019s  lead  support  for  a  sectorwide  approach  has  acted  as  a  catalyst  for  coordinated\nassistance  to  the  education  sector  for  the  next  five  years.  The  ESP  and  ESSP  process  has\nbeen instrumental in promoting, and mobilizing additional resources from both Government and\nexternal  financiers,  by  providing  a  broad  policy  framework  and  matrix  for  coordination  of\nexternal  assistance.  Secondly,  the  policy  dialogue  under  the  ESDP  preparation  process  has\ncontributed to the targeting of grant financing for capacity building, e.g., the scheduled UNICEF-\nSida support of about $13 million during 2002-2004. The ESDP focus also provides an overall\nframework  for  the  targeting  of  other  external  assistance,  e.g.,  Belgian  support  for  school\nfacilities,  and  World  Bank  assistance  for  higher  education,  currently  under  preparation.\nComplementary support for basic education and higher education through various modalities is\nalso expected from Australia, France, Germany, United Kingdom, World Food Programme, United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Japan, and NGOs. Current\nestimates are that ongoing, and scheduled support under the ESSP over the next 5 to 6 years will\nreach about $35 million per year.\n\n2.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n53.\nThe mid- to late1990s in Cambodia can be characterized as a transition from emergency\nrelief, to reconstruction and development. ADB provided MOEYS with assistance to prepare the\nEducation  Investment  Plan  1995-2000,  as  an  initial  attempt  to  coordinate  assistance  to  the\neducation sector. However, many factors contributed to its limited success: MOEYS capability to\nlead, plan, and manage the programs was still insufficient; the political unrest in 1997 led to a\ndecline  in  external  assistance;  the  long-term  vision  for  education  reform  remained  embryonic,\nlinkages  to  broader  poverty  reduction  strategies  were  limited;  and  integration  of  education\nfinancing  plans  into  public  expenditure  planning  and  management  was  underdeveloped.  From\nthe  experience,  three  main  lessons  were  learned.  First,  policy  reforms  need  to  be  owned  and\nled  by  MOEYS,  and  financing  modalities  need  to  encourage  ownership.  Second,  project\nassistance on its own cannot easily achieve broad policy and institutional reforms. Third, many\nof the constraints on improving equity and quality can only be addressed by resolving broader\ninstitutional and financial issues.\n\n                  \n\n17 Loan 1446-CAM(SF): Basic Education Textbook, for $20 million, approved on 29 June 1996.\n18 Loan  1824-CAM(SF): Emergency Flood Rehabilitation,   for  $55.0  million,  approved  on  21  December  2000.  The\n\nloan amount for education is $5.8 million.\n\n\f13\n\n54.\nThe  Cambodia  Development  Resource  Institute  has  assessed  TA  and  capacity\ndevelopment  in  Cambodia.19  The  report  highlights  several  important  findings.  Recipient\norganizations and counterpart staff are generally positive about the benefits of TAs, both in terms\nof institutional gains and the development of professional skills. The report found that projects that\nwork  through  normal  government  structures  are  likely  to  be  the  most  effective  in  developing\ncapacity,  and  recommended  that  the  concept  of  project  implementation  units  should  be\nreexamined, and alternative ways of managing assistance through normal government structures\nbe found. The study pointed to sectorwide approaches as the way forward, in which the starting\npoint  is  a  jointly  agreed  statement  of  policy  and  priorities  for  the  whole  sector,  with  a  detailed\nannual budget, and work plan, disaggregated by subsector and province. It involves joint planning\nand review meetings, meetings for exchange of information and work plan monitoring, and regular\nmonitoring on performance and expenditure. The proposed ESDP follows this approach.\n\nADB\u2019s draft Special Evaluation Study on Policy-Based Program Lending (October 2000)\n55.\nhighlights  the  need  to  provide  policy  prescriptions  that  are  realistic,  appropriate,  and\nsustainable,  and  to  avoid  blueprint  approaches.  The  study  stresses  institutional  capacity,\nGovernment commitment, integration of support with other assistance agencies, and systematic\nand  effective  monitoring  as  important  factors  for  success.  These  recommendations  were\nconsidered  when  designing  the  ESDP.  The  preparation  and  planning  process  has  been\nthorough,  involving  stakeholders  at  all  levels,  at  key  stages,  over  one  and  a  half  years,  to\nensure ownership and realistic and implementable reforms. The approach to sector reform has\nbeen  adapted  to  the  Cambodian  context,  taking  account  of  MOEYS,  other  ministries,  and\nexternal financiers\u2019 capacities. A challenge will be to effectively manage the transition from the\ncurrent  project-driven  approach,  to  more  flexible  and  adaptive  sector  support  modalities.  The\nESDP  will  combine  program  support,  which  is  judged  to  be  most  effective  to  implement\nimportant  policy  objectives,  with  decentralized  support,  and  the  more  traditional  project  model\nfor school buildings and selected capacity building.\n\n56.\nOther  key  measures  built  into  the  ESDP  to  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  government,\nassistance agency, and NGO partnership processes under the sectorwide approach, include (i)\nbuilding  an  annual  sector  performance  review  process  into  the  annual  government  budget\nplanning process and calendar; (ii) strengthening the capacity of the Government and MOEYS\nto  service  the  proposed  annual  performance  review  process,  especially  sector  performance\ninformation  collection  and  analysis,  prior  to  sector  review;  and  (iii)  ensuring  that  all  partners,\nincluding  the  Government,  MOEYS,  funding  agencies,  NGOs,  and  civil  society,  undertake  the\nnecessary capacity building and find the necessary resources to be effective partners.\n\nG.\n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n57.\nADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  for  Cambodia  (2000),  emphasizes  support  for\npoverty  reduction  through  interventions  in  three  priority  areas:  (i)  support  for  economic\ndevelopment  of  rural  areas,  (ii)  human  and  social  development,  and  (iii)  private  sector\ndevelopment.  The  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  lead  the  facilitation  of  a  sector  approach  in\neducation;  in  fact,  ADB  has  been  doing  this  since  mid-1999.  Within  the  context  of  the  current\nADB  strategy,  and  taking  into  account  the  Second  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  and  the\nGovernance  Action  Plan,  ADB\u2019s  operational  program  will  be  enhanced  by  providing  better\nlinkages  between  the  ESDP  and  the  Government\u2019s  state  reform  process,  especially  the\ndecentralization and deconcentration process, and the public reform process.\n\n                  \n\n19 Godfrey  M,  C.  Sophal,  et  al.  2000.  Technical Assistance and Capacity Development in an Aid Dependent\n\nEconomy: The Experience of Cambodia. Cambodia Development Resource Institute. Phnom Penh.\n\n\f14\n\nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  education  sector  is  to  promote  and  facilitate  a  comprehensive\n58.\napproach to education development, led and owned by the Government. ADB\u2019s poverty reduction\nstrategy for education will help put in place pro-poor education policies, strategies, and resource\nallocation  mechanisms  to  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction\nobjectives and targets. As a facilitating agency in education, ADB has provided a cluster of policy,\nplanning, and institutional TAs in recent years, and helped strengthen MOEYS-assistance agency\npartnerships, and sectorwide approaches. ADB\u2019s immediate strategy is to consolidate and extend\npolicy  and  strategy  development  in  cooperation  with  other  funding  agencies.  This  approach  will\naddress  policy  needs  in  financing  of  education,  equity  and  access,  quality  and  efficiency\nimprovement,  and  management  and  decentralization,  as  well  as  legislative  and  regulatory\nreforms.  Within  the  Government\u2019s  overall  sector  policy  framework,  ADB  will  mainly  focus  on\nimproving  equitable  access,  and  quality  and  efficiency  in  primary  and  secondary  education,\nespecially for the rural poor, girls, and ethnic minorities.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n59. While  some  progress  has  been  made  in  improving  Cambodia\u2019s  education  system,\nconsiderable  challenges  remain.  The  system  is  characterized  by  inequitable  access,  especially\nfor the poor, girls, and ethnic minorities, and low quality with high repetition and dropout rates.\nThe  weak  education  system  is  perpetuating  the  cycle  of  poverty,  and  contributing  to  low\nproductivity and weak governance. The Government realizes that to enhance economic growth\nand  social  development  in  Cambodia,  education  policies  need  reform,  coupled  with  increased\nallocations  to  the  sector.  The  quality  and  equity  of  spending  need  to  be  urgently  addressed,\ntogether  with  inputs  that  will  improve  learning  in  the  classroom  and  promote  efficient  service\ndelivery.\n\n60.\nThe  current  policy  environment  in  Cambodia,  with  ongoing  state  reforms,  represents  a\nmajor  opportunity  to  implement  many  of  the  necessary  reforms  in  education,  especially\ninstitutional and financial changes. In late 1999, as part of the start-up of a new phase of policy\ndevelopment,  MOEYS  examined  a  number  of  approaches.  Three  broad  options  were\nconsidered:  (i)  continue  a  narrow,  technically  focused  project  approach;  (ii)  selectively\nincorporate subsector links using a set of subsector programs; and (iii) initiate a broader, policy-\nfocused,  comprehensive,  sectorwide  approach.  After  consultation  with  stakeholders,  MOEYS\nadopted the third option and during the past year made significant progress in putting processes\nand technical capacity in place to manage this potentially more complex approach.\n\n61.\nBased on experiences and lessons learned from implementing the Education Investment\nPlan  1995-2000,  the  Government  has  decided  to  use  the  education  budget  as  a  means  to\nimplement education reforms, particularly to ensure pro-poor policies and strategies to address\nthe issues of equitable access, quality, and efficiency of education. As described in the ESP and\nESSP, the overall budget allocation for education, as well as the education sector share of the\ntotal recurrent budget will be increased, coupled with investments that will support and facilitate\nimplementation  of  the  policies.  Increased  investment  in  improved  education  in  Cambodia  will\nresult  in  economic,  social,  and  private  returns,  such  as  enhanced  economic  growth  and\nproductivity,  sector  efficiency,  health  benefits,  social  and  regional  equity,  and  institutional  and\ngovernance benefits. A more extensive economic and social justification is provided in Appendix\n5.\n\n\f15\n\nThe  Government  asked  ADB  for  financial  support  for  its  education  policy  reforms  and\n62.\ninvestments, which are part of the comprehensive state reform process. A policy-based loan is\njustified  since  the  Government  will  not  have  the  financial  capacity  to  undertake  pro-poor\npolicies,  decentralization,  and  education  service  rationalization  by  itself,  in  spite  of  increased\nallocations. The total cost of adjustments to be carried out under the policy packet is estimated\nat  $98  million  for  2002-2005:  (i)  adopting  pro-poor  resource  allocations  ($29  million),  (ii)\nproviding  incentives  to  priority  groups  and  rationalizing  education  service  ($15  million),  (iii)\ndecentralizing education services ($25 million), and (iv) ensuring sustainable provision of quality\ninputs ($29 million). External financing will be needed over the medium term to help cover the\nfinancing gap.\n\n63.\nThe  ESDP  is  designed  within  the  overall  framework  of  the  ESP  and  ESSP,  to\ncomplement activities of the Government and other funding agencies in the sector. The policy\nprogram will help ensure that more poor students enroll in basic education by ensuring pro-poor\nresource allocations, regular teacher and student attendance, sustainable instructional materials\nprovision, and education service rationalization and decentralization. The policy component will\nbe  supplemented  by  project  support  for  facilities  development.  Capacity  building  will  also  be\nprovided,  since  the  Government  lacks  the  necessary  expertise  in  the  key  areas  of\ndeconcentrated facilities development, budget planning, accounting and audit, and institutional\ndevelopment for TVET.\n\n64.\nThe ESDP was designed in close coordination with all major assistance agencies in the\neducation  sector,  using  the  principles  of  a  sectorwide  approach:  sustainable  partnerships,\ncommon long-term vision and agreed targets for education reform, comprehensive sector policy\nframework,  formulation  of  a  rolling  program  and  process  for  reforms,  forward  work  plan,  and\nsector performance review and negotiation processes (Appendix 2).\n\n65.\nThe  ESDP  constitutes  a  key  element  of  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy,  which  supports\npolicy-based  lending,  and  approaches  that  address  policy  needs  for  decentralization,  quality\nimprovement,  and  financial  management  and  efficiency.  The  sector  development  program\nmodality  is  most  appropriate  because  it  can  simultaneously  accelerate  policy  and  institutional\nreforms in the provision of education, while funding specific activities to support implementation\nof such initiatives, including capacity building.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe overall objective of the ESDP is to contribute to poverty reduction in Cambodia, by\n66.\nassisting  the  Government  to  increase  the  educational  level  of  new  entrants  to  the  workforce.\nThe ESDP will support the Government in reforming and strengthening the education sector as\noutlined in the ESP, and building on ongoing dialogue between the Government, ADB, external\nfunding  agencies,  NGOs,  and  other  stakeholders,  based  on  the  partnership  arrangements\nformally agreed upon in February 2001.\n\n67.\nThe  policy  component  promotes  policies  aimed  at  (i)  assuring  increased  resource\nallocation  to  the  education  sector,  (ii)  increasing  equitable  access  to  education  services,  (iii)\nimproving  quality  and  efficiency  of  the  sector,  (iv)  enhancing  managerial  capacity  at  all  levels\nand increasing the deconcentration of service delivery.\n\nThe  project  component  supplements  the  policy  initiatives  by  supporting  (i)  increased\n68.\naccess  and  equity,  mainly  for  basic  education;  (ii)  deconcentrated  and  decentralized  planning,\nmanagement,  and  monitoring;  and  (iii)  selective  quality  and  efficiency  improvement  in  budget\nplanning, accounting and auditing, and TVET. The Project will provide construction of facilities in\nremote  and  underserved  areas,  promote  greater  deconcentration  of  the  planning  of  facilities\n\n\f16\n\nprograms  to  provincial  authorities  and  institutions,  and  pilot  budget  management  of  facilities\ndevelopment in four provinces.\n\n69.\nA sector approach is proposed as the Government has developed a sound sector strategy\nand  investment  plan;  the  Department  of  Materials  and  State  Property  (DMSP)  has  built  up\ncapacity  with  EU  support;  decentralized  implementation  of  subprojects  will  be  introduced\ngradually;  and,  with  further  capacity  building,  DMSP,  and  provincial,  and  district  authorities  will\nhave adequate capacity to implement the Project.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n70.\nThe  policies  and  targets  reflected  in  the  ESP  (Appendix  3),  are  based  on  an  intensive\npolicy  review  and  development  process  that  started  in  early  1999;  extensive  internal\nincluding  formation  of  four  in-house  policy  task  forces;\nconsultations  within  MOEYS, \nconsultations  with  provincial  and  district  education  staff;  and  consultations  with  the  national\nparents association forum, and the assistance and NGO community.\n\nThe ESDP is described in the development policy letter (Appendix 6), and in the policy\n71.\nmatrix  (Appendix  7).  The  policy  loan  will  provide  funds  to  the  Government  in  three  tranches,\naccording to prescribed tranche conditions relating to policy reform to be carried out under the\nESDP.  The  ESDP  includes  specific  reforms  to  ensure  pro-poor  resource  allocations  that  will\nprovide  increased  opportunities  for  high  quality  and  efficient  education  services  throughout\nCambodia.  The  reforms  are  important  both  to  selectively  expand  service  provision,  and  to\nestablish  reformed  and  sustainable  financial  and  technical  planning,  and  management\nstructures.\n\n1. \n\nIncreased Resource Allocation to the Education Sector\n\n72.\nThe  Government\u2019s  objective  is  to  ensure  well-planned,  increased,  and  equitable\nresource  allocations  for  the  education  sector.  A  key  reform  is  the  establishment  of  an  agreed\nfive-year  rolling  financing  framework  and  targets  that  will  allow  for  predictable  education\nprogram  planning.  MOEYS,  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF),  and  other  key\nstakeholders  in  national  and  subnational  planning  and  budgeting  processes  will  ensure  that\nsystems  are  strengthened,  to  enable  MOEYS  to  undertake  effective  medium-term  planning,\nbudgeting, and priority program implementation.\n\n73.\nSecondly, under the existing interministerial Economic and Financial Policy Committee,\nan education finance management committee (EFMC) will be established through a ministerial\ncircular. The EFMC will facilitate joint MEF and MOEYS decision making and agreements on all\nissues  related  to  education  financing,  and  financial  management.  The  EFMC  will  comprise\nmembers  from  MOEYS,  MEF,  Ministry  of  Planning,  Ministry  of  Interior,  and  the  Council  for\nAdministration  Reform.  In  the  overall  government  budget,  the  share  of  recurrent  spending  on\neducation increased from 9 percent in 1994 to 15.7 percent in 2001. The Government intends to\nincrease  the  education  recurrent  budget  as  a  share  of  total  recurrent  budget,  reaching  19.5\npercent by 2004; with the highest share going to basic education (about 75 percent per year).\nThe  ESDP  will  facilitate  significant  medium-term  adjustment  cost,  currently  estimated  at  $98\nmillion  for  2002-2005,  to  provide  the  foundation  for  implementing  and  sustaining  longer-term\nreforms. The costs may have to be adjusted and rephased as part of the annual review of the\nESSP rolling program. The primary implementation modality during the medium term will be the\nGovernment\u2019s PAP mechanism.\n\n\f17\n\n2.\n\nEquitable Access to Education Services\n\n74.\nTo  improve  equitable  access  to  education,  the  Government  has  planned  a  number  of\nkey reforms. Firstly, measures will be taken to reduce the cost of basic education to parents by\nabolishing  informal  start-of-year  school  contributions.  Other  parental  contributions  will  be\nretained. The start-of-year contributions are the largest of the school year, and come at a time\nwhen  parents  generally  have  the  least  money.  Levying  of  these  fees,  tends  to  discourage\nenrolment of the poor, particularly girls. The first phase of this reform was introduced in 2000,\nand  the  ESDP  will  enable  nationwide  implementation  of  such  a  policy  across  all  primary  and\nsecondary schools. Associated steps will be taken to ensure transparency and accountability for\nother parental contributions made during the school year.\n\nSecondly,  targeted  assistance  programs  for  the  rural  poor,  particularly  girls  and  ethnic\n75.\nminorities, will gradually be introduced for grades 4-12. The programs will be poverty-indexed,\nand  merit-driven  incentive  schemes,  such  as  scholarships  and  social  credit  programs,  with\ncommunity  involvement  in  student  selection,  management,  and  monitoring.20  Thirdly,  the\nGovernment will formulate a public-private strategy for education, to protect the level of public\nspending required for expanding and improving basic education services. Fourthly, steps will be\ntaken to improve the efficiency of staff deployment and the use of education facilities. Teacher\ntraining  and  deployment  policies  will  be  revised  to  ensure  that  experienced  and  qualified\nteachers  are  assigned  to  underserved  and  remote  rural  and  ethnic  minority  areas  through\nappropriate  recruitment  and  incentive  strategies.  Nonteaching  staff  will  be  redeployed  into\nclassroom  teaching  positions.  An  affirmative  action  plan  to  ensure  the  participation  of  females\nand  ethnic  minorities  at  all  levels  in  schools  and  the  education  system  will  be  adopted  and\nimplemented.  These  programming,  and  deployment  reforms  will  be  linked  to  decentralized\nmanagement and monitoring of school facilities development supported under the Project.\n\n3.\n\nImproved Quality and Efficiency\n\n76.\nA key Government priority is to improve the quality and internal efficiency of education\nservices  through  various  policy  actions.  The  reforms  currently  under  way  to  increase\nprogression and survival rates in primary school through remedial classes will be expanded. To\naddress  the  anticipated  growth  of  both  primary  and  secondary  education  enrolments,  the\nGovernment  will  reform  the  preservice,  and  in-service  teacher  training  system,  including\ngranting  greater  operational  autonomy  to  training  institutions,  providing  more  flexibility  in\nprogramming;  introducing  multigrade  and  ethnic  minority  teaching  strategies;  and  providing\norientation to staff on curriculum and textbook reform. The Government also plans to introduce\nminimum standards at various levels of the curriculum and associated assessment mechanisms\nto monitor the performance of schools, institutions, and students. Further policy reforms include\nestablishing  sustainable  instructional  materials  policies  and  programs,  together  with  continued\ninstitutional  reform  of  the  MOEYS  textbook  publishing  and  distribution  facility,  moving  its\npublishing, printing, and distribution enterprises to more autonomous operations.\n\n4.\n\nEnhanced Management and Deconcentration of Education Services\n\n77.\nRecognizing  that  deconcentration  of  education  management  is  essential  for  enhanced\nschool  efficiency  and  responsiveness,  and  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  overall  deconcentration\nand decentralization process, the Government will take several policy actions designed to improve\nthe efficiency of education management to empower provincial, commune, and school authorities\nto plan and manage their own programs budgets. The Government will introduce new and revised\nfinancial  planning  and  management  procedures,  including  a  medium-term  expenditure  plan  for\n\n20 ADB is currently processing a proposal to pilot this program under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.\n\n                  \n\n\f18\n\neducation,  linked  to  the  Government\u2019s  public  expenditure  program  and  public  investment\nprogram,  as  a  basis  for  setting  priority  program  financing  targets.  An  effective  education  sector\nperformance  system  will  be  essential  for  the  implementation  of  the  policies  under  the  ESP  and\nESSP.  Performance  indicators,  and  targets  will  be  prepared  for  the  sector,  and  annual  sector\nreviews will be undertaken by the Government, ADB, and other funding agencies.\n\n78.\nTo  strengthen  education  service  performance  and  productivity,  a  five-year  education\nservice  rationalization  plan  with  targets  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in  cooperation  with\nMEF and the NPAR authorities. The primary strategy will be targeted incentives for priority groups\nof teachers and school management staff, related to criteria for more equitable staff deployment\nand efficiency. This will complement teacher salary increases, which are part of broader poverty\nreduction  and  NPAR  strategies.  The  establishment  of  the  EFMC  will  help  ensure  effective\ncoordination between MOEYS, MEF, and other key ministries; and improve financial management\nand  disbursement  mechanisms,  and  performance  monitoring  and  financial  compliance  auditing\nsystems will be strengthened.\n\n79.\nEducation  service  decentralization  will  be  implemented  by  providing  operational  budgets\ndirect  to  institutions,  including  primary  and  secondary  schools,  teacher  training  institutions,\npostsecondary  TVET,  and  higher  education  institutions.  This  strategy  will  be  complemented  by\nlegislation and regulations for institutional development planning, and financial management and\ncontrol  to  secure  increasing  decrees  of  operational  autonomy  for  education  institutions.  Greater\nauthority  will  also  be  gradually  given  to  provinces  for  facility  planning  and  implementation.  An\naction plan and guidelines for increased community involvement in institutional governance will be\nprepared,  and  the  system  will  be  implemented.  To  strengthen  the  commitment,  impact,  and\naccountability  of  policy  reforms,  an  information,  education,  and  communication  strategy  will  be\nimplemented.  Strengthening  of  institutional  governance  and  audit  procedures  will  complement\nthese deconcentration reforms.\n\nD. \n\nCapacity Building\n\n80.\nCapacity building support under the ESDP is comparatively small, since major support for\nsector  management,  PAP  implementation,  and  quality  improvement  will  be  provided  through\nUNICEF-Sida.  Assistance  will  focus  on  (i)  establishing  deconcentrated  and  decentralized\nmechanisms for education facilities development, (ii) establishing an effective internal accounting\nand audit function within MOEYS to ensure compliance with the new government audit law, and\n(iii)  institutional  development  for  TVET,  since  the  Government  lacks  the  necessary  expertise  in\nthese areas.\n\nE.\n\nThe Investment Project\n\n81.\nThe  ESDP  will  be  reinforced  through  investment  in  facilities  development  under  the\nProject. To strengthen policies related to equitable access, and assist in achieving international\ndevelopment  and  education  for  all  goals,  the  Project  will  finance  provision  of  school  facilities\nunder the MOEYS priority facilities action plan. The Project will also help design and strengthen\nprovincial  capacity  for  a  deconcentrated  system  of  facilities  development  to  be  piloted  in\nselected  provinces.  To  strengthen  budget  planning  and  accounting  systems,  and  assure\ncompliance with the new Government audit law, capacity for budget planning, accounting, and\ninternal audit will be enhanced within the Department of Finance, MOEYS, the National Training\nBoard, TVET, and provincial education offices.\n\n\f19\n\n1.\n\nEquitable Access\n\na.\n\nFacilities Development\n\nIn  spite  of  significant  expansion  of  primary  education,  geographical  and  gender\n82.\ninequities  in  access  exist,  particularly  for  the  remote  provinces.  MOEYS  has  prepared  the\nEducation Facilities Development Plan  for 2001-2005. The objective of the plan is to achieve\neducation  for  all  over  the  coming  decade,  as  well  as  to  accommodate  the  needs  of  the\nincreased  number  of  students  completing  basic  education.  Significant  capacity  has  been  built\nboth in the Department of Planning, and DMSP(cid:190)\n the MOEYS department that handles facilities\nconstruction.  The  development  of  an  education  information  management  system,  geographic\ninformation  system,    school  inventory  database,  cost  database,  and  standard  designs  for\nfacilities have enhanced the central planning and management in these departments.\n\n83.\nThe total investment needs for education facilities, according to the plan, is estimated at\n$118  million.  Capital  support  from  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  funding  agencies  is  not\nlikely to be enough, therefore, the Government has prioritized the needs according to potential\navailability  of  resources.  The  priority  plan,  estimated  at  $18  million,    includes  policy  targeting\nand  program  prioritization  criteria  for  each  of  the  components  of  facilities  development.  The\npriority  action  plan  will  be  developed,  and  include  an  allocation  formula  for  the  provinces  and\noutline the school facilities program management, monitoring, and disbursement systems.\n\n84.\nThe  Project  will  finance  part  of  the  priority  facilities  development  plan,  with  particular\nemphasis  on  basic  education  facilities  in  poor  and  remote  areas  that  will  benefit  the  poorest\nstudents.  The  Project  will  help  provide  (i)  primary  schools  for  multigrade  teaching  in  small\nvillages without schools, where viable schools can be established; (ii) construction of complete\n(grades  1-6)  primary  schools  in  rural,  remote,  and  ethnic  minority  areas,  currently  with\nincomplete  schools  (para.  25);  (iii)  additional  classrooms  in  overcrowded  primary  schools;  (iv)\nlower secondary schools in underserved and overcrowded areas; and (v) selective completion\nof grades 7-12 schools. Support to PPTCs will also be provided in areas where the development\nof  basic  education  would  heavily  depend  on  increased  capacity  of  training  colleges.  Selective\nsupport  will  also  be  provided  to  provincial  TVET  centers,  mainly  in  rural  and  remote  areas,  to\nprovide a venue for skills training and standards monitoring for public, private, and NGO training\nproviders. This would be a first step in strengthening their partnership in TVET.\n\n85.\nThe  Project  will  be  complementary  to  the  ADB  loan  for  rehabilitation  of  the  schools\nseverely damaged during the floods in 2000. Through the Project, an estimated 53,000 students\nin  primary,  60,000  students  in  lower  secondary,  and  13,000  students  in  combined  lower  and\nupper  secondary  education  will  benefit  from  improved  access  to  education,  and  will  have  a\nbetter learning environment through the reduction of overcrowded classes. In addition, around\n5,000 students in teacher training colleges, and 2,000 students in provincial TVET centers will\nbenefit from an improved learning environment. Unless major resources other than the present\nADB loan are made available for investing in the ESSP school facilities program, the Project will\nsupport  facilities  development  nationwide,  but  target  the  most  needy  provinces,  as  well  as\npockets of poverty in other provinces, according to criteria set by the ESSP.\n\n86.\nThe Project will support a \u201cwhole school development\u201d approach in basic education. The\nwhole  school  development  approach  favors  the  efficient  use  of  resources  to  meet  all  of  the\npriority  needs  of  targeted  schools(cid:190) needs  in  terms  of  expansion,  completion,  furniture,\nsanitation  facilities,  rehabilitation,  and  selective  teacher  accommodation,  utilizing  a  demand-\ndriven process.\n\n\f20\n\nb.\n\nDeconcentrated System for Facilities Development Implementation\n\nfacilities  component  will  support \n\nThe system design for deconcentrated financing, planning, and delivery of the Project\u2019s\n87.\neducation \nthe  Government\u2019s  policy  of  administrative\ndeconcentration and  decentralization in public service management. Capacity building support\n(Appendix  8)  will  help  mainstream  all  education  facilities  programs  in  the  central  DMSP,  in\nprovincial authorities, or in commune councils.21 It will establish coherent planning and financing\nrelationships  for  facilities  between  these  three  levels  of  governance.  This  will  assist  in  the\ntransition  from  a  project  approach  to  facilities  development  (where  there  are  discrete\nimplementation  units  for  each  funding  agency\u2019s  activities),  to  a  program  approach,  with\nimplementation through the agency given the responsibility by the Government at the national,\nprovincial,  and  commune  levels.  A  gradual  transition  of  delegated  responsibility  for  planning,\nand delivering facilities to province authorities is anticipated for secondary and TVET facilities,\nalong with devolution of primary education facilities to commune councils. The role of the central\nDMSP  will  be  to  focus  on  policy,  planning,  implementation  procedures,  quality  assurance,\nfinancial audit, and program monitoring.\n\nThe Project will support the deconcentration of education facilities programs to provincial\n88.\nauthorities  and  institutions,  including  the  piloting  of  financial  management  in  four  provinces,\ncomplemented  by  similar  piloting  in  two  provinces  with  Belgian  support.  The  delegated\nresponsibilities  over  delivery  of  primary  and  secondary  school  facilities  to  provinces  and\ncommunes  will  gradually  expand  over  the  ESP  period  of  2001-2005,  based  on  the  lessons\nlearned from the pilot provinces. During the transitional period, DMSP will assume responsibility\nfor managing the subprojects in the most needy and poor provinces that are not yet included in\nthe deconcentrated delivery of facilities.\n\n89.\nThe  proposed  selection  criteria  for  identifying  pilot  provinces  in  each  phase  of\ndeconcentration  of  responsibilities  will  be  (i)  poor  provinces  with  the  highest  needs  for  school\nfacilities  according  to  ESSP  criteria,  (ii)  provinces  representative  of  a  variety  of  population\ndensity  and  profile  (small  to  large  provinces),  (iii)  provinces  representing  various  levels  of\ncapacity built through decentralized programs such as Seila,22 (iv) provinces where other major\nfunding  agencies  are  not  contributing  to  school  facilities,  and  (v)  provinces  constituting  a\ngeographical cluster to facilitate the monitoring of activities. MOEYS has provided, and ADB has\napproved  the list of the four provinces for the first phase of piloting.\n\n90.\nAt  the  central  level,  DMSP  will  develop  the  capacity  to  implement  the  deconcentration\nand  decentralization  policy  and  to  establish  related  procedures  within  the  framework  of  the\nNPAR, and to implement regulations introduced through the National Committee to Support the\nCommune Councils under the Ministry of Interior. DMSP, together with the Ministry of Planning,\nMinistry of Interior, and Ministry of Women\u2019s and Veterans\u2019 Affairs, will develop the capacity of\ncommune  councils  and  provincial  governments  to  take  on  their  new  roles,  and  become\nresponsible for primary and secondary facilities development. A key policy area to be developed\nthrough  capacity  building  will  be  the  inclusion  of  the  private  sector  as  a  partner  in  facilities\ndevelopment  at  all  levels.  Consulting  services,  equipment,  vehicles  for  provinces,  and  support\nfor  project  operations  and  supervision  will  be  provided  to  help  establish  a  cost-effective  and\nsustainable system for deconcentrated planning and implementation of facilities subprojects.\n\n                  \n\n21 As commune councils develop the capacity to play a role in facilities implementation, the responsibility for this may\n\nbe transferred to communes. Financial resources will continue to come through the  provinces.\n\n22  Seila is  a  Khmer  word  for  \u201cfoundation.\u201d  Seila  is  a  rural  development  program,  characterized  by  institutional\nstrengthening  of  local  authorities  within  the  context  of  the  Government\u2019s  deconcentration  and  decentralization\nprogram. Seila is currently implemented in five provinces (to be extended to 12 by the end of 2001), supported by\nseven funding agencies.\n\n\f21\n\nUnder the Project, consulting services will be provided to build DMSP capacity to fulfill its\n91.\nto  design  and  establish  deconcentrated  and  decentralized\nnew  responsibilities,  and \nmechanisms  for  education  facilities  development  (Appendix  8).  The  consulting  services  for\nschool  facilities  planning,  and  management  will  be  located  in  the  Construction  Unit  of  DMSP.\nMOEYS has confirmed the availability of office space and counterpart support staff, consisting\nof at least four engineers, one accountant, and four technicians of works, who will constitute a\ntemporary  task  force  for  the  Project  and  be  trained  in  deconcentrated  planning  and\nmanagement  during  the  first  year  of  project  implementation.  However,  all  staff  of  DMSP  who\nparticipate  in  the  Project  will  be  trained  and  assigned  to  tasks  according  to  their  professional\nprofiles  and  competencies.  The  vehicles,  computers,  other  equipment,  and  furniture  provided\nunder the ADB loan for the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project (footnote 18) will be shared\nwith the Project.\n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening for Financial Management\n\n92.\nEffective  implementation  and  financing  of  the  reform  programs  will  require  urgent\nstrengthening  of  financing  systems,  including  budgeting,  accounting,  and  audit.  The  Law  on\nAudit,23 approved in 2000, requires MOEYS to establish an internal auditing function to examine\nand  evaluate  the  effectiveness,  economy,  and  efficiency  of  the  systems  of  internal  controls\nestablished by MOEYS management. The law requires each ministry to ensure that systems of\ninternal  control  are  in  place  for  reliability  of  financial  reporting;  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of\noperations;  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations,  policies,  and  procedures.  The\nneed  for  sound  systems  of  internal  MOEYS  budgeting,  accounting,  and  auditing  was  also\nidentified in the ESSP, in the context of gradual deconcentration of financial management to the\nprovinces, districts, and schools. As part of this, the work in the MOEYS General Department of\nAdministration  and  Finance,  and  the  General  Inspectorate  will  shift  from  being  mainly  of  an\ninvestigatory nature, to become more an evaluation of the systems of internal control.\n\n93.\nUnder  the  Project,  an  internal  audit  capacity  building  program  for  MOEYS  will  be\nsupported to ensure compliance with the new government audit law. The assistance will focus\non  an  initial  institutional  assessment  of  MOEYS  audit  arrangements,  especially  within  the\nGeneral  Inspectorate,  and  its  two  departments  of  Administration  and  Finance,  and  Education.\nThe institutional review will also examine necessary coordination arrangements with MEF, and\nthe MOEYS Department of Administration and Finance, including its relationships with provincial\ntreasuries  and  departments  of  education.  The  Project  will  provide  international  and  domestic\nconsulting  services  to  assist  planning  and  execution  of  this  audit  capacity  building  program\n(Appendix  8).  Additional  support  will  be  provided  for  necessary  equipment  and  training,  to\nsecure an efficient internal audit system at central and provincial levels. In the event that grant\nfinancing  will  be  available  for  audit  capacity  building,  the  amount  reserved  for  this  purpose\nunder the Project will be reallocated to the facilities development component.\n\nInstitutional strengthening support will also be provided to the TVET department and the\n94.\nNational  Training  Board,  including  training  in  budget  planning,  program  resource  allocation,\nprogram  performance  monitoring,  technical  and  financial  reporting,  and  skills  standards  and\nquality assurance. The institutional support will build upon  the foundation laid under the Basic\nSkills Project (footnote 16).\n\n3. \n\nQuality and Efficiency Improvements\n\nIn  the  ESSP,  MOEYS  outlines  the  broad  capacity  building  requirements  necessary  to\n95.\nachieve  quality  and  efficiency  targets  for  the  medium  term.  These  include  establishing\n\n23  Prepared  with  support  from  TA  2566-CAM: Developing Capacity in Audit and Inspection Function,  for  $600,000,\n\n                  \n\napproved on 8 May 1996.\n\n\f22\n\nstandards  and  assessment  mechanisms  at  key  points  in  primary  and  secondary  schooling,\nimproving  the  curriculum  for  all  grades,  developing  a  new  generation  of  core  instructional\nmaterials,  and  facilitating  the  publication  and  availability  of  workbooks  and  supplementary\nbooks.  MOEYS  also  plans  to  improve  the  systems  that  deliver  preservice  and  in-service\nprofessional development for working teachers and head teachers, including special programs\nfor  multigrade  teaching;  and  ensure  much  closer  articulation  between  contemporary  school\nneeds and professional development programs. The publishing capacity of MOEYS, developed\nunder  the  ADB-supported  Basic  Education  Textbook  Project  (footnote  17)  will  be  enhanced\nthrough capacity development at management and technical levels, and arrangements made for\nsustaining the system for quality instructional materials provision.\n\n96.\nUNICEF and MOEYS have jointly prepared an assistance proposal ($13 million) for Sida\nfinancing  to  support  key  capacity  building  requirements  outlined  in  the  ESSP,  to  cover\nsectorwide management reform, PAP implementation, and quality improvement. The proposal is\nexpected  to  be  approved  by  Sida  in  December  2001.  MOEYS  will  continue  seeking  grant\nfinancing  for  areas  not  covered  by  UNICEF-Sida,  and  other  confirmed  funding  agencies.  If\nfunding  is  not  found,    assistance  under  the  Project  will  be  provided,  particularly  for  capacity\nbuilding in publishing and quality improvements in upper secondary education (Appendix 8).\n\n4.\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nThe investment Project is estimated to cost $22.5 million equivalent, consisting of $8.0\n97.\nmillion (35 percent) in foreign exchange cost and $14.5 million equivalent (65 percent) in local\ncurrency cost (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements are in Appendix 9.\n\nComponent\nA. Base Cost\n\n1.   Equitable Access: Education Facilities\n2.   Institutional Strengthening\n\nSubtotal (A)\n\nB.

ADB financing of local currency cost is justified on the basis of the low\n\n\f23\n\nlevel of national income ($257 per capita, estimated in 2000), and savings (14.2 percent of the\nnational income in 2000), as well as the Government\u2019s fiscal deficit (6.1 percent of GDP). The\nbalance  of  $4.5  million  will  be  financed  by  the  Government.  This  will  include  facilities\ndevelopment, furniture and equipment, supervision, and incremental operation costs. Part of the\nADB-supported  project  loan  and  Government  funding  will  be  made  available  to  participating\ncommunities  and  institutions  as  block  grants  to  contribute  to  the  funding  of  approved\nsubprojects.\n\n99.\nThe  ESDP  investment  Project  is  providing  support  for  primary,  secondary,  teacher\ntraining, and TVET facilities development. Complementary support is scheduled from Belgium,\nJapan, NGOs, and the World Bank\u2014the latter focusing on higher education. Common planning\nguidelines and management procedures are expected to be adopted.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nAsian Development Bank\nGovernment\n\nTotal\n\nF.\n\nSocial and Environmental Measures\n\n1. \n\nPoverty Impact\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n18.00\n4.50\n\n10.00\n4.50\n\n8.00\n0.00\n\n8.00\n\n14.50\n\n22.50\n\n100.\nThe ESDP will address issues of the exclusion of the poor from basic education, and the\nlow  quality  of  educational  services  delivered  to  the  poor.  Policy  changes,  supported  by  the\npolicy loan, will improve equity in the allocation of resources. Through policy reform, allocations\nto  the  education  sector  will  substantially  increase  and  enable  MOEYS  to  reduce  the  cost  of\neducation to poor families, one of the major barriers to participation. For example, provision of\nincreased operational budgets to schools will help reduce informal payments by parents.\n\n101.\nThe  ESDP  will  also  ensure  continued  access  to  instructional  materials,  a  provision  of\nparticular  importance  to  the  36  percent  of  the  population  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The\nimprovement  of  management  and  the  decentralization  of  educational  services  will  enable\ndisbursement of funds to schools throughout the country to improve the quality of instructional\ndelivery according to needs. This will also increase community involvement in financial planning\nand accountability, and ensure due consideration is given to the poor in policy implementation at\ncommune and school levels.\n\n102. Social  equity  and  poverty  concerns  are  also  integrated  in  the  design  features  and\nimplementation arrangements for the Project. Provision of allocations for facilities development\nin  provinces  will  be  according  to  poverty  index,  needs-based,  and  a  pro-poor  allocation\nformula.24 The provision of more classrooms and the introduction of multigrade approaches into\nprimary education delivery will ensure that children in remote rural village schools benefit from\nthe full cycle of primary education.\n\n                  \n\n24 The formula consists of (i) a fixed block allocation (to favor small schools in poorer areas), (ii) enrolment, and (iii)\nan integrated poverty factor based on the proportion of poor households in the surrounding commune. This formula\nis coupled with an index of priority facilities needs.\n\n\f24\n\n103.\nIn  planning,  MOEYS  will  focus  more  on  the  contribution  of  the  sector  to  poverty\nreduction and the inclusion of the poor as beneficiaries of its services. In the long term, the poor\nwill have more trust in Government and their inclusion in its service provision, and will become\nmore  directly  involved  in  service  evaluation,  and  thereby  the  democratization  process.  The\npoverty impact analysis is summarized in Appendix 10.\n\n2. \n\nGender\n\n104.\n  Several  measures  are  incorporated  in  the  ESDP  to  meet  access  needs,  and  the\nrequirements  of  girls  and  ethnic  communities.  Experience  has  shown  that  schools  close  to\nhome  facilitate  the  enrollment  of  girls.  Construction  of  multigrade  and  complete  schools  in\nunserved and underserved small communities, including provision of toilets and water sources,\nwill  encourage  the  completion  of  the  full  primary  cycle.  Access  to  primary  and  secondary\neducation is limited by parents\u2019 inability to pay formal and informal fees, as well as other costs\nassociated with schooling, e.g., opportunity costs. Abolition of start-of-the year school fees will\nencourage parents to enroll their girls. Targeted scholarships, transport assistance, and/or other\ntypes of assistance will make it easier for girls to attend and complete primary and secondary\nschool. Dormitory space at regional secondary schools will make it possible for larger numbers\nof girls to continue their education beyond lower primary level. Separate toilets for boys and girls\nwill also be beneficial to girls\u2019 enrollment. A gender and development checklist has already been\ndeveloped  at  the  Pedagogical  Research  Department,  MOEYS;  and  the  review  of  current\ntextbooks  for  gender,  ethnic,  or  disability  bias  is  ongoing.  Textbooks  relevant  to  girls\u2019  and\nindigenous peoples\u2019 daily lives and future aspirations will improve their retention in schools. In\nterms  of  decentralized  planning,  management,  and  monitoring,  women  will  be  encouraged  to\ntake an active role in parental committees within communities.\n\n3. \n\nEthnic Minorities\n\n105.\nThe Government recognizes that although ethnic minorities constitute only 1 percent of\nthe total population (footnote 9), special measures are necessary to address neglect of earlier\ndecades.  The  ESDP  policies  will  help  improve  access  of  ethnic  minorities  to  primary  and\nsecondary education. The reduction of the cost of schooling by eliminating start-of-year fees will\nbe  particularly  beneficial  to  ethnic  minority  families  whose  incomes  tend  to  be  lower  than  for\nmainstream  Khmer;  this  measure  is  expected  to  improve  ethnic  minority  participation  in  basic\neducation.  Remote  areas  suffer  from  lack  of  teachers,  especially  ethnic  minority  teachers.\nStaffing  guidelines  and  redeployment  incentives  will  be  used  to  increase  the  provision  of\nteachers to such areas.\n\n106. Project  interventions  include  special  targeting  criteria  for  minority  areas  in  the\nprioritization process for the provision of facilities. In the long term, provision of full primary and\nsecondary  education  opportunities  in  ethnic  minority  areas  will  help  increase  the  supply  of\nminority students who can apply to become teachers. In the short-term, multigrade teaching in\nsmall village schools will enable minority students to complete the full primary cycle.\n\n107. By  increasing  deconcentration  of  responsibility  and  resources  for  education  service\ndelivery to provinces and communes, and providing operational budgets to all schools, schools\nin  remote  ethnic  minority  areas  will  be  improved.  An  information,  education,  communication\nprogram  will  be  provided  to  inform  communities  about  the  new  education  policies,  and  their\nroles,  authority,  and  responsibilities.  Such  measures  will  result  in  greater  inclusiveness  for\nethnic minorities. The Indigenous People\u2019s Development Plan is given in Appendix 11.\n\n\f25\n\n4. \n\nHIV/AIDS Prevention\n\n108. Under the overall ESP, synergies will be developed with the National AIDS Authority to\ndetermine how the education sector can best contribute to the national plan, including the PAP\nmechanism.  In  providing  training  opportunities  through  the  PAP  (teacher  training,  workshops,\netc), an appropriate degree of HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation content will be included. By\nraising  the  profile  of  the  epidemic  through  such  measures,  the  ESDP  will  contribute  more\ngenerally  to  increased  high-level  dialogue  on  the  role  of  the  education  sector  in  reducing  the\nepidemic. It will also initiate dialogue on sector response to the changing social and economic\nconditions that could result from the spread of the disease.\n\n109. Complementary  assistance  is  being  provided  through  the  ADB-supported  TA:  Capacity\nBuilding for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control.25 UNICEF-Sida will also continue the multimedia\ncampaign  for  adolescents  and  youth  on  the  topic,  and  upcoming  revisions  of  curricula  and\ntextbooks  will  ensure  that  students  are  provided  with  realistic  messages  about  the  dangers  of\nHIV/AIDS and steps that can be taken to prevent the disease.\n\n5.\n\nEnvironment\n\n110. Environmental implications of the Project were reviewed, and no adverse impacts were\nidentified.  MOEYS  and  DMSP  will  ensure  that  siting,  design,  construction,  and  operation  of\nschool facilities to be established under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines\nfor Selected Infrastructure Projects and other relevant guidelines. Land for school construction\nis available and owned by the Government or the communities; the plot required for construction\nis small, and no relocation will be involved. Environmental considerations will be factored into all\nproject-funded civil works. The designs of the multigrade schools will be culturally appropriate,\nenvironmentally sound, and easy to maintain. Sanitation issues will be reviewed for rural areas,\nand  appropriate  design  for  low-cost,  water-free  sustainable  amenities  will  be  developed  for\nimplementation and maintenance as a community contribution.\n\nV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED LOANS\n\nA. \n\nThe Policy Loan\n\n1. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n111.\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  education  policy  reform  program  by\nproviding  a  policy  loan  of  $20  million  equivalent  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  the\nKingdom  of  Cambodia.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8\nyears.  An  interest  of  1  percent  per  annum  will  be  charged  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5\npercent  thereafter.  The  loan  will  be  utilized  over  four  years  and  will  be  disbursed  in  three\ntranches.\n\n112. Use of low cost funds from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources is justified in support of policy\nreforms that address long-standing issues and socially significant measures to improve access\nand participation of the poor in education. The policy loan is justified by the content and impact\nof policy reforms and associated adjustment costs (para. 62). In addition to the policy loan, the\neducation  reforms  are  being  supported  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  structural  adjustment  credit.  An\noutline  of  the  education  sector  financing  targets  and  a  short  summary  of  the  reforms  to  be\nimplemented through the PAPs under the recurrent budget are in Appendix 3.\n\n25 TA 3511-CAM: Capacity Building for HIV/AIDS, for $600,000, approved on 3 October 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f26\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\n113. MOEYS will be the Executing Agency responsible for implementing policy measures. A\nsteering  committee  will  be  set  up,  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  state,  MOEYS,  and  comprising\nrepresentatives  from  MOEYS;  MEF;  Ministry  of  Planning;  Council  for  Administrative  Reform;\nMinistry  of  Interior;  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  and  Veterans\u2019  Affairs;  Ministry  of  Rural  Development;\nand Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning, and Construction. This committee will assist\nin  coordinating  the  ESDP  implementation.  The  steering  committee  will  be  established  by  loan\neffectiveness.  Existing  technical  committees  will  monitor  implementation  of  specific  program\ncomponents on a monthly basis. MEF will allocate and monitor the use of counterpart funds to\nbe used to support the education reform package.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n114.\nThe  policy  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items\nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  listed  ineligible  items  (Appendix\n12)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  Borrower  will  certify\nthat the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under\nthe policy loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds\nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n115.\nThe counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the policy loan will be used by the\nGovernment  for  the  following  purposes  in  order  of  priority:  (i)  to  finance  costs  associated  with\nthe implementation of the package of education policy reforms under the ESDP, (ii) to meet part\nof the Government\u2019s contribution to the ADB-funded education projects, and (iii) to meet part of\nthe Government\u2019s contribution to ADB-funded projects in other social sectors.\n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n116.\nThe  Government,  through  the  steering  committee,  will  monitor  the  implementation  of\npolicy,  legal,  and  institutional  reforms  envisaged  under  the  ESDP.  Annually,  the  Government,\nADB,  other  funding  agencies,  and  NGOs  will  review  the  achievement  of  agreed  sector\nperformance targets, and assess the impact of all reforms in the education sector, as part of joint\neducation  sector  performance  reviews.26  Monitoring  of  the  ESDP  will  also  be  strengthened  by\nassistance of consulting services under the Project for performance audit (Appendix 8).\n\n117.\nThe policy loan will be released in three tranches, of $10 million, $5 million, and $5 million.\nThe first tranche will be made available upon loan effectiveness. The Government will be required\nto fulfill the actions specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 7) as conditions for second and third\ntranche  releases,  and  to  demonstrate  satisfactory  progress  with  implementing  the  rest  of  the\nprogram  prior  to  second  and  third  tranche  releases.  The  second  tranche  is  expected  to  be\nreleased  about  15  months  after  release  of  the  first,  or  earlier,  subject  to  the  Government\u2019s\nfulfillment of the second tranche release conditions. The third tranche is expected to be released\nabout 12 months after the release of the second, or earlier, subject to the Government\u2019s fulfillment\nof the third tranche release conditions.\n\n                  \n\n26 An advisory TA for education is also included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Cambodia for 2002. The\nplanned  TA  will  support  the  strengthening  of  Government  and  MOEYS  capacity  in  expenditure  planning,\nprogramming,  and  performance  monitoring  of  the  sector,  including  the  monitoring  of  (i)  education  system\nperformance against outcome and output targets,  (ii) program impact, and (iii) sustainability of education services.\n\n\f27\n\nB. \n\nThe Investment Loan\n\n1. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  an  investment  loan  of  $18.0  million  equivalent  from  its\n118.\nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years. An interest of 1 percent per annum will be charged during\nthe grace period, and 1.5 percent thereafter.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\na. \n\nExecuting Agency\n\n119. MOEYS will be the Executing Agency and be responsible for coordinating overall project\nimplementation.  The  secretary  of  state,  MOEYS,  will  chair  a  steering  committee  (para.  113)\ncomposed of MOEYS; MEF; Ministry of Planning; Council for Administrative Reform; Ministry of\nInterior; Ministry of Women\u2019s and Veterans\u2019 Affairs; Ministry of Rural Development; and Ministry\nof  Land  Management,  Urban  Planning,  and  Construction.  Responsibilities  will  include  (i)\napproval  of  annual  programs  and  budget  allocations,  (ii)  overseeing  progress  and  compliance\nwith agreed guidelines, (iii) commissioning and approving project-required accounts and reports,\nand (iv) ensuring that agreed audit requirements are satisfied.\n\n120. DMSP,  MOEYS,  will  be  responsible  for  facilities  development  and  be  in  charge  of  (i)\noverall  monitoring,  progress,  quality  control,  and  approval  of  provincial  level  activities;  (ii)\ncapacity  building;  (iii)  financial  management,  accounting,  and  audit  compliance  responsibilities\ndelegated  by  the  steering  committee;  (iv)  overseeing  regularity  of  procurements;  and  (v)\nreporting  to  the  steering  committee.  The  operations  will  be  coordinated  by  the  General\nDepartment of Administration and Finance (which oversees DMSP), which will ensure that the\nProject  is  coordinated  with  other  ongoing  school  building  programs;  duplication  of  beneficiary\nschools  and  operational  costs  is  avoided;  and  targeting  criteria  and  unit  costs  are  consistent\nwith the ESSP.\n\nb. \n\nSubproject Implementation\n\n121. Each  provincial  subproject  will  comprise  one  or  more  schools  and/or  education\ninstitutions  to  be  constructed,  expanded,  or  improved  The  subprojects  will  be  implemented\naccording to a \u201cdelegated system\u201d in provinces where responsibilities for planning, selection of\nschools,  procurement,  and  financial  management  have  been  deconcentrated.  A  number  of\nsubprojects  will  be  implemented  according  to  a  \u201ccentral  system\u201d  during  the  transitional  phase,\nwhere  responsibilities  for  school  facilities  or  education  institutions  have  not  yet  been\ndeconcentrated. Appendix 13 provides guidelines for subproject preparation and appraisal.\n\n122. Under  the  central  system,  DMSP,  and  a  project  task  force  will  act  as  the  central\nimplementation  agency  in  provinces  where  the  delegated  mechanism  has  not  yet  been\nimplemented,  provided  that  (i)  the  needs  in  these  provinces  are  not  addressed  by  any  other\nfunding sources; (ii) the schools and education institutions are identified as those most in need\nof expansion of facilities for primary, lower secondary, PTTC, RTTC, and TVET institutions. In\nthese  cases,  DMSP  will  prepare  the  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  for\nsubproject preparation and appraisal, procure services of qualified contractors, and be in charge\nof the disbursements to contractors. DMSP, in close collaboration with the provincial director for\neducation, will prepare the consolidated subprojects for the province, and submit to the steering\ncommittee  for  approval.  DMSP  will  prepare  all  subprojects  for  PTTC,  RTTC,  and  TVET\n\n\f28\n\ninstitutions.  All  central  system  subproject  appraisal  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for\napproval.\n\n123. Upon  approval  of  the  subprojects  by  MOEYS,  DMSP  will  sign  a  subproject  agreement\nwith the representatives of the beneficiary communes and schools. DMSP will be in charge of\nassisting  the  communes  and  schools  to  procure  suitable  contractors,  or  procuring  these\ncontractors;  procuring  contractors  for  PTTC,  RTTC,  and  TVETs;  training  and  assisting  the\nprovinces  and  communes  in  supervising  and  controlling  the  quality  of  works  at  key  stages;\nissuing  certificate  of  payments  at  key  stages;  and  disbursing  the  payments  to  schools,\ncommunes, or contractors, whichever are applicable.\n\n124.\nThe  delegated  system  will  be  implemented  once  deconcentrated  mechanisms  for\neducation facilities development have been worked out, e.g., guidelines, procedures, roles and\nresponsibilities,  and  modalities  for  allocation  and  disbursement  of  funds.  MOEYS,  in\nconsultation  with  relevant  agencies,  will  prepare  detailed  implementation  guidelines  for\neducation facilities and a detailed technical handbook, satisfactory to ADB. This will take place\nduring the first year of project implementation.\n\n125.\nIn  the  delegated  system,  provincial  education  facilities  committees  (PEFCs)  will  be\nconstituted  at  the  provincial  level,  as  part  of  the  existing  provincial  rural  development\ncommittees  (PRDCs).  The  PEFCs  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  at  provincial  and\nmunicipality level in provinces covered by the Project. The names of the four provinces that will\npilot  a  deconcentrated  approach  have  already  been  identified.  The  PEFCs  for  the  first  pilot\nprovinces will be established within six months after loan effectiveness.\n\nThe  PRDCs  will  delegate  day-to-day  management,  monitoring,  and  accounting\n126.\nresponsibilities to the PEFCs. The PRDCs and PEFCs will be responsible for selecting eligible\napplicants;  supervising  and  controlling  the  quality  of  work  at  key  stages;  issuing  certificate  of\npayments  at  key  stages;  and  disbursing  the  payments  to  schools,  communes,  or  contractors,\nwhichever is applicable. The PRDCs and PEFCs will be ultimately responsible for receiving and\naccounting  for  the  project  funds  for  school  facilities.  Consulting  services  for  facilities\ndevelopment will help clarify detailed operational relationships between these various technical\ncommittees during the first year of the Project.\n\n127.\nThe  PEFC  will  consolidate  appraisal  reports  for  the  subproject  under  the  delegated\nsystem, and submit them to the PRDCs for review and approval. The PRDCs will then submit\nthe  list  of  subproject  appraisals  to  the  steering  committee  for  final  approval.  MOEYS  will\napprove  the  list  of  subprojects  for  the  first  four  provinces  within  eight  months  after  the\ninvestment  loan  has  become  effective.  The  first  four  subproject  appraisal  reports  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB for approval. The PRDCs will submit to MOEYS subsequent appraisal reports\nfor  approval.  After  approval,  MOEYS  will  submit  the  reports  to  ADB  for  information.  Upon\napproval of the subprojects by ADB or MOEYS, the PEFC will sign a subproject agreement with\nthe  commune  and  schools.  During  subproject  implementation,  the  PEFC  will  contribute  to  the\nsupervision  of  the  civil  works  in  association  with  the  provincial  authorities.  Support  from  the\ndistricts, communes, and school communities to the provincial levels will consist of monitoring\nthe  progress  of  works  in  school  for  early  detection  of  problems,  and  of  immediate  remedial\nactions to be taken.\n\n128. Communes  will  apply  for  facilities,  provide  daily  supervision  of  works,  contribute  to  the\nimprovement  of  the  school  environment,  be  committed  to  MOEYS  objectives  of  equitable\naccess, and provide for the efficient use of school facilities and the maintenance of the facilities.\nFor  the  primary  schools  under  the  deconcentrated  system,  the  communes/schools  will  also\nprocure a suitable contractor for building works, under the guidance of the PECF. Delegation of\nfinancial  and  procurement  responsibilities  to  provincial  and  commune  levels  will  be  gradually\n\n\f29\n\nimplemented  through  a  rolling  plan,  starting  in  the  pilot  provinces  in  2002,  and  expanding\ngradually  to  new  provinces  based  on  lessons  learned.  The  midterm  review  will  assess  the\nstrengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  decentralized  system  to  identify  ways  of  improving\nimplementation.\n\nc.\n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\nAll ADB-financed procurement for the Project will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines\n129.\nfor Procurement.  Each  contract  for  the  supply  of  goods,  equipment,  furniture,  and  instructional\nmaterials  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational competitive bidding procedures, while contract packages of $500,000 equivalent or\nless  will  follow  international  shopping  procedures.  Minor  items  having  a  value  of  less  than\n$100,000 equivalent may be procured on a direct purchase basis. Civil works under the Project\nwill  be  small,  numerous,  and  scattered  throughout  the  country  and  are  not  likely  to  attract  the\ninterest of international contractors. Therefore, civil works contracts are proposed to be awarded\non the basis of local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB.\n\nTo expedite project implementation, an imprest account for MOEYS will be established\n130.\nin  the  Foreign  Trade  Bank  of  Cambodia  for  expenditures  incurred  by  DMSP  and  the  PEFCs.\nThe  steering  committee  will  determine  the  allocations  of  funds  to  the  PEFCs,  after  obtaining\nagreement  with  ADB.  The  provincial  allocations  will  be  based  on  (i)  time  frame,  and  (ii)\nallocation formulas agreed with ADB.\n\n131.\nThe  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The accounting records and system will\nbe  managed  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Accounting  Manual  for\nCambodia. ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible\nexpenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  to  the  imprest  account.  These  procedures  will  be\napplicable  to  contracts  amounting  to  $100,000  or  less.  A  tentative  procurement  list  is  in\nAppendix 14.\n\nd.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n132. A  total  of  54  person-months  of  international  and  96  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting services will be required. Capacity building support under the ESDP is comparatively\nsmall,  since  major  support  for  sector  management  and  quality  improvement  will  be  provided\nthrough  UNICEF-Sida.  The  Government  has  requested  that  the  international  consultants\ncollaborate  with  domestic  consultants,  and  ADB  has  agreed  to  the  request.  International  and\ndomestic consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.\nOutline terms of reference for the consultants is in Appendix 8.\n\ne.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe  implementation  period  will  be  five  years,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  31\n\n133.\nDecember 2006.\n\nf.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audits\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  goods  and\n134.\nservices financed from the proceeds of the investment loan will be maintained. Separate accounts\nfor the Project will be maintained, and auditors acceptable to ADB will audit accounts and financial\nstatements  annually,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  Certified  copies  of  such\naudited accounts will be submitted to ADB within 12 months after the close of each fiscal year.\n\n\f30\n\n135. MOEYS will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to ADB\nwithin 30 days of each quarter. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and will indicate,\namong  other  things,  (i)  progress  against  established  targets,  both  technical  and  financial;  (ii)\nstatus of performance indicators; (iii) problems encountered during the quarter, and steps taken\nand proposed to be taken to resolve problems identified; (iv) compliance with loan covenants; and\n(v)  program  activities  proposed  for  the  succeeding  quarter.  MOEYS  will  prepare  and  submit  a\nproject completion report to ADB not later than three months following the physical completion of\nthe Project.\n\ng.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n136. Under  the  ESDP,  the  Project  will  provide  substantial  support  to  developing  DMSP\u2019s\nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation capacities. DMSP will be strengthened, and central staff\nprovided  training  in  contract  and  financial  management,  information  systems,  decentralized\ntechnical  surveys,  and  works  monitoring  and  site  completion  audit.  Monitoring  capacities  at\nprovince,  commune,  and  school  levels  will  also  be  enhanced.  Data  collection,  storage,  and\nanalysis procedures will be institutionalized to support management and administrative activities\nat  all  levels.  The  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  captured  through  the  improved  education\nmanagement  information  system  and  monitoring  system.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  for\ncomplementary  benefit  monitoring  studies,  including  surveys.  Preliminary  key  indicators  for\nequitable access and quality and efficiency are in Appendix 3.\n\nh. \n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n137. During  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  government\nofficials, particularly the section on fraud and corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy\nand Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Capacity building to\nestablish an effective internal accounting and audit function within MOEYS (Appendix 8) will help\nsupport anticorruption efforts.\n\ni. \n\nJoint Annual Sector Performance Reviews\n\n138. Annually,  the  Government,  ADB,  other  funding  agencies,  and  NGOs  will  review  the\nimplementation,  and  assess  the  impact  of  all  reforms  in  the  education  sector  as  part  of  joint\neducation sector performance reviews. The reviews will focus on the audit of the agreed upon\nsector performance targets and indicators. The timing of the review will be linked to the planning\nof the next annual budget to ensure the link between policy progress and budget requirements.\nThe  annual  review  will  provide  a  forum  for  joint  strategic  negotiations  on  necessary  program\nadjustments  and  consequent  resource  requirements.  In  addition  to  annual  and  other  reviews,\nthe Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review of the Project, during the third\nyear  of  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  identify  changes  since  the  time  of  appraisal,\nreassess  the  impact  with  regard  to  future  project  implementation  and  sustainability,  assess\nimplementation  performance  against  project  performance  indicators,  review  and  establish\ncompliance with loan covenants, identify problems and constraints, and recommend appropriate\ncorrective actions.\n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts\n\nVI.\n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS\n\n139. Policy reforms to be implemented under the ESDP will improve the targeting of allocations\nto  the  poor,  and  have  a  positive  social  impact  in  terms  of  poverty,  gender,  and  the  inclusion  of\nethnic minorities. The cost of education will be reduced to parents enabling poor students, girls,\nand ethnic minorities to participate at increasingly higher levels. The provision of more classrooms\n\n\f31\n\nand  the  introduction  of  multigrade  approaches  into  primary  education  delivery  will  enable  poor\nchildren to complete primary education, and provide schools close to home, which benefits girls.\nDirect student support mechanisms such as targeted assistance programs will make it easier for\ngirls and the poor to attend and complete primary and secondary education. Teacher performance\nand teaching quality in remote areas are expected to be enhanced through incentives for certain\ncategories of teachers serving under difficult circumstances. Regional discrepancies in education\nfinance will be offset through poverty-indexed formulas for priority action programs and facilities\ndevelopment.  More  effective  governance  systems  will  help  ensure  that  the  communities  are\ninvolved in and benefit from assistance to schools.\n\n140.\nThe  estimated  immediate  beneficiaries  of  the  ESDP  are  (i)  additional  100,000  children\nwho will be able to access schooling as a result of new facilities; (ii) 50,000 teachers who will\nreceive professional development (through PAP) supported by the Program; (iii) 5,000 MOEYS\nofficials, provincial, and district officials, and commune council members who will receive short-\nterm training under the capacity building elements of the Project; and (iv) 250 program budget\nmanagement  center  staff  who  will  receive  on-the-job  technical  and  financial  management\ntraining. Communities in 100 districts will benefit from increased access to secondary schools,\nand  500  communes  will  benefit  from  new  or  expanded  primary  school  facilities.  Students  in\nevery  public  school  will  benefit  from  sustained  access  to  textbooks  with  new  HIV/AIDS\nmessages.\n\nIn the long term, increased access to secondary schooling and TVET in poor rural areas\n141.\nwill  benefit  rural  families  by  improving  income-generating  opportunities.  Better  schooling  will\ncontribute  to  improved  farmer  productivity  and  incomes,  especially  in  Cambodia  where\nagricultural productivity is low compared with regional neighbors. Improved secondary education\nopportunity  will  provide  increased  access  to  higher  education  and  formal  employment,  and\nprovide  wage  earning  opportunities  for  the  poor.  The  increased  access  to  schooling  in  rural\nareas  will  benefit  the  poor  by  enabling  diversification  of  the  rural  economy  and  income\ngeneration. Overall the rural population will benefit from poverty reduction.\n\n142.\nThe competitiveness of the Cambodian economy will improve through a better-educated\nand trained workforce. Cambodia will potentially benefit from increased foreign investment and\nconsequent job creation and income generation. Especially through improved secondary, TVET,\nand  higher  education  opportunities,  the  country  will  be  a  benefit  from  a  shift  to  higher  value-\nadded, technology-based employment, and consequent improvement in wages.\n\n143.\nThe increased access to schooling in the poor rural areas, especially for girls, will also\nprovide significant social benefits to these households. Firstly, educating girls will contribute to\nbetter  school  attendance  for  rural  families,  improved  child  and  family  nutrition,  and  improved\nfamily  planning  practices.  This  will  contribute  to  improving  well-being  and  reducing  human\npoverty in rural areas. In addition, in areas where HIV/AIDS is more prevalent, better-educated\nstudents will be more receptive to AIDS prevention programs.\n\n144. Employers  will  also  benefit  by  having  a  better-educated  and  trainable  workforce.  The\nbenefits  will  include  improved  worker  productivity,  and  improved  efficiency  of  both  on-the-job\nand  institution-based  training  for  the  workforce.  In  the  long  term,  this  should  result  in  cost\nreductions  for  training  at  various  levels,  especially  as  the  economy  undergoes  a  transition  to\nbecoming  more  technology  based.  Improved  earnings  will  provide  benefits  through  greater\npotential for cost sharing of training provision. Employers will benefit from the capacity building\nin training planning, management, and monitoring through the support for systems development\nat TVET\u2019s National Training Board, and the NTF.\n\n\f32\n\n145. Other immediate beneficiaries from the extensive capacity building under the ESDP will\nbe the education staff and community groups at center, province, district, commune, and school\nlevels. This staff, as well as teachers, will benefit from improved earnings and skill levels. In the\nlong  term  this  will  put  education  services  on  a  more  sustainable  footing.  Other  immediate\nbeneficiaries,  through  the  extensive  school  building  program,  will  be  small  private  building\ncontractors,  and  workers  in  rural  and  urban  areas.  In  turn,  these  building  programs  will\ncontribute to increased employment and income generation.\n\n146. A  cross-cutting  benefit  of  the  comprehensive  sector  approach  being  adopted  will  be\ngreater long-term sustainability of education services, both in financial and technical terms. The\nfocus  on  expanded  public-private  partnerships  at  the  postbasic  education  level  will  protect\nspending for basic education, and ensure that the immediate benefits for the rural poor through\nexpanded  schooling  can  be  maintained  and  sustained.  Sustainability  will  also  be  assured  by\nimproving  cost  efficiency  in  the  delivery  of  education  services,  by  improving  student  survival\nrates and more efficient use of staff and facilities.\n\n147. Another  long-term,  cross-cutting  benefit  will  be  the  gradual  reduction  of  stand-alone\nproject implementation units, which currently tend to remove key MOEYS staff from their regular\npositions  in  the  MOEYS  organization,  result  in  off-budget  resource  management,  and  distort\nstaff  performance  reward  and  incentives  systems.  In  the  medium  term,  increased  location  of\nexternally supported TAs within ministry structures, rather than in project implementation units\nor  agencies,  will  reinforce  capacity  building,  and  contribute  to  greater  participation  of  ministry\nstaff in program planning processes.\n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n148. At central and community levels, the potential risk is unpredictability and unevenness in\nthe  financing  of  the  proposed  education  reforms,  especially  government  and  community\ncontributions  to  education  expenditure.  The  ESDP  includes  a  number  of  features  that  will\nreduce the risk of unpredictable financing. Firstly, the formulation of a medium-term expenditure\nplan  for  education  will  develop  government,  funding  agency,  and  NGO  forward  planning  and\nmonitoring.  The  proposed  link  between  the  annual  performance  review,  and  budget  planning\nprocesses will help assure adequate resources. The proposed steps to regulate and account for\nprivate contributions will also help mitigate financial risks.\n\n149. Another risk is that the Government and MOEYS leadership and commitment to difficult\nreforms could diminish and undermine program implementation. The risk will be minimized as a\nresult of early support from ADB under the ESDP, providing an incentive for the Government to\nmaintain  its  commitment.  ADB  support  will  be  complemented  by  significant  assistance  from\nUNICEF-Sida for overall capacity building of the education system. The expanded and improved\npartnership  arrangements,  and  annual  stakeholders\u2019  consultations  and  system  performance\nreview will also help mitigate any such risk.\n\n150. At  the  community  and  school  levels,  a  potential  risk  is  that  demand  for  expanded\neducation services would stagnate, if parents and communities perceive that the provision is of\npoor quality and relevance. The ESDP is designed to address the need for quality improvement\nby  incorporating  a  number  of  technical  and  financial  measures  to  minimize  these  risks.  First,\nincreased  provision  of  key  quality  inputs  such  as  books  and  teacher  training,  linked  to\ncurriculum reforms, is proposed. Second, the focus on community governance and information\ndissemination  will  help  inform  and  encourage  continued  demand.  MOEYS  has  already  taken\ninitiatives  to  reduce  such  risks,  including  formulating  a  preliminary  education  governance  plan\nand  introducing  a  nationwide  information,  education,  communication  campaign  to  stimulate\nprimary school enrolment and monitor fee abolition.\n\n\f33\n\n151. A  further  risk  is  that  the  Government-province-commune-school  financial  management\nsystems will not be adequate for the disbursement, spending, and accounting for the proposed\ndecentralized management of the education programs proposed. To reduce this risk, the ESDP\nwill  be  based  on  agreed  guidelines  between  stakeholder  ministries  for  different  financial\nmanagement  responsibilities,  underpinned  by  new  regulations.  Capacity  building  for  technical\nand financial planning and management at all levels of the system will be extensive.\n\n152. Another  risk  is  that  government  revenues  will  be  less  than  projected.  Cambodia's  tax\nbase is dependent on trade taxes for about 80 percent of its tax revenue. But such reliance on\ntrade taxes is not sustainable, since the Government is committed to reducing tariff rates over\ntime within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area framework. To reduce\nthis  risk,  ADB  and  other  funding  agencies  are  providing  comprehensive  assistance  for  tax\nreforms  and  other  aspects  of  financial  management  under  the  Technical  Cooperation\nAssistance Program, led by MEF and the International Monetary Fund.\n\n153.\nFinally,  a  potential  risk  is  the  lack  of  medium-term  external  support  to  cover  projected\nrecurrent and capital budget shortfalls. A number of measures are included to mitigate any such\nrisks.  Firstly,  the  new  MOEYS-funding  agency-NGO  partnership  arrangements  will  be  used  to\nmobilize external assistance. Secondly, the sector performance review and budget planning will\nallow  for  adjustment  of  targets  and  programs  on  an  annual  basis,  taking  account  of  available\nprojected government and external resources.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n154.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  (a)  ensure  that  the  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  as\ndescribed in the policy letter, including the policy matrix, prior to the date of the\nESDP loan agreement continue in effect for the duration of the ESDP period and\nsubsequently;  and  (b)  promptly  adopt  the  other  policies  and  take  the  other\nactions indicated in the ESDP as specified in the policy letter, including the policy\nmatrix,  and  ensure  that  such  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  during  and\nafter the ESDP period.\n\n(ii)  Within six months after the investment loan becomes effective, the Government\nwill  establish  PEFCs  for  the  first  four  pilot  provinces  where  deconcentrated\nbudget management for facilities development will be piloted under the Project.\n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  MOEYS  uses  no  less  than  60  percent  of\nallocated funds for the provinces under the Project for basic education facilities.\n\nB.\n\nConditions of Loan Effectiveness\n\n155.\n\nFor the policy loan,\n\n(i) \n\nMEF will provide ADB with written confirmation that the sector recurrent and total\nrecurrent  budget  expenditure  ratio  for  the  FY2002  budget  presented  to  the\nNational  Assembly  represents  not  less  than  17.5  percent  of  the  total  recurrent\nbudget expenditures;\n\n\f34\n\n(ii) \n\nMEF will provide ADB with written confirmation that the budget for the education\nsector is consistent with the requirements included in the ESSP; and\n\n(iii)  MEF, through EFMC, will approve sector performance indicators and targets for\n\nFY2002, satisfactory to ADB.\n\nFor the investment loan, the MOEYS will establish the steering committee to coordinate\n\n156.\nactivities to ensure effective implementation of the ESDP.\n\nVIII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n\n157.\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 15,656,000 to\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Education Sector Development Program, with\na  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest\ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5\npercent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are\nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement\npresented to the Board;

The\nGovernment  has  embarked  on  broad-ranging  reforms  to  the  state\u2014public  administration  and\nfinance, legal and judicial(cid:190) and commitment to deconcentration and decentralization. In light of\nthese  broader  reforms,  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport  (MOEYS)  has  led  its  own\nreform process over the past two years, through a high-level policy coordination group and task\nforces.  The  positive  climate  for  reform  has  been  reinforced  by  the  Government\u2019s  poverty\nreduction strategic plan and socioeconomic development plan, ensuring a pro-poor thrust.\n\n6.\nThe  overall  long-term  vision  for  education  reform  is  guided  by  the  Government\u2019s\ncommitment to achieving the international development goals, and high-quality education for all\n(EFA)  by  2015.  The  recent  establishment  of  the  EFA  National  Committee,  with  the  Prime\nMinister as president and the EFA Secretariat within MOEYS, adds to the sustainability of the\nvision and partnership. The long-term vision, and targets, have been phased and sequenced in\na  medium-term  education  strategic  plan  (ESP),  and  an  education  sector  support  program\n(ESSP) for 2001-2005. The medium-term targets focus on achieving nine years of basic EFA by\n2010, and a growing public-private partnership for postbasic education.

Overseas Development Institute, London.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nreform  targets  center  on  gradual  capacity  building  for  decentralization  of  education  service\nmanagement over the next 10 years.\n\n7.\nA joint Government, funding agency, and nongoverment organization (NGO) partnership\nhas been forged to share this vision and reform targets, through joint appraisal and reviews of\nthe ESP and ESSP during March-July 2001. These processes are gradually being assimilated\ninto MOEYS and funding agency structures, including the revitalized education sector working\ngroup of funding agencies.\n\nC.\n\nWell-Defined Sector: Sectoral, Institutional, and Financial Considerations\n\n8.\nAnother  SWAP  characteristic  is  the  formulation  of  a  rolling  program  and  process  for\nreforms.  The  ESP  and  ESSP  are  based  on  the  principle  of  the  budget  being  an  instrument  of\npolicy implementation, rather than of systems maintenance. Consistent with this, policies will be\nimplemented using a rolling five-year medium-term expenditure plan to ensure predictability in\nplanning, and to act as a framework for capturing and coordinating recurrent and capital budget\nsupport from the Government and funding agencies. The Government has also established an\neducation  finance  management  committee  to  coordinate  and  monitor  progress  and  resource\nrequirements.\n\nBroader state reforms have also provided an opportunity to reinforce a SWAP approach.\n9.\nIn  2000,  the  Government  introduced  a  postaudit,  priority  action  program  (PAP)  process  which\nassures  budget  support  for  key  policies.  The  PAP  mechanism  has  also  provided  impetus  for\ndeconcentration  of  financial  management,  and  selected  capacity  building  at  the  central,\nprovincial, district, and institutional levels.\n\nD.\n\nForward Work Plan\n\nThe  ESP  and  ESSP  rolling  process  has  made  it  necessary  to  develop  a  forward  work\n10.\nplan for sectoral, institutional, and financial reforms. Accordingly, a comprehensive institutional\ndevelopment  and  capacity  building  plan  and  program  for  sectorwide  management  is  a  key\nfeature of the ESP and ESSP, endorsed by development partners in late June 2001. In addition,\ncapacity building programs for strengthening the planning and management of priority programs\nwas another feature of the ESSP and its review process.\n\n11.\nThese forward work plan components also provide a framework for coordinated funding\nagency and NGO support for capacity building. For example, both the proposed ADB-supported\nEducation Sector Development Program loan, and the education support program proposed by\nthe  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  Swedish  International  Development\nCooperation  Agency  (Sida)  are  being  coordinated  for  their  capacity  building  components\nthrough  the  ESSP  capacity  building  framework.  The  framework  also  provides  a  basis  for\ncapturing capacity building assistance of ongoing projects where appropriate.\n\n12.\nAt this stage, MOEYS and funding agencies are not expected to move to basket funding,\nas is common in some SWAPs. The principle adopted will be to use the Government's  financial\nand budget planning, and management systems to capture and monitor both government and\nfunding agency support. Accordingly, a forward work plan priority is to strengthen government\nand MOEYS budget planning, disbursement, management, accounting, and audit systems.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nE.\n\nSector Performance Review and Negotiation Processes\n\n13.\nA  key  feature  of  the  education  reform  process  is  the  introduction  of  an  annual  joint\nGovernment, funding agency, and NGO review of the performance of the education sector. The\nfirst such review in June 2001 built on the joint National EFA Assessment 2000.\n\n14.\nA  number  of  important  features  of  the  ESSP  review  process  need  to  be  noted.  Firstly,\nthe  review  will  focus  on  the  audit  of  sector  performance  targets  and  indicators,  rather  than\nreview  and  accounting  of  detailed  program  activities  and  inputs.  Secondly,  the  timing  of  the\nreview  process  in  midyear,  will  be  linked  to  the  planning  of  the  next  annual  budget,  to  ensure\nthe  link  between  policy  progress  and  budget  requirements.  Thirdly,  the  annual  review  will\nprovide  a  forum  for  joint  strategic  negotiation  on  necessary  program  adjustments,  and\nconsequent resource requirements.\n\n15.\nAll partners recognize that strengthening monitoring systems at a number of levels will\nbe critical. Within MOEYS, a key component of the forward plan is to strengthen performance\nmonitoring information systems and processes. Secondly, the strategic monitoring capability of\nthe funding agencies and NGOs needs to be strengthened both in-country and in head offices.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 3, page 1\n\nEDUCATION STRATEGIC PLAN 2001- 2005: SUMMARY\n\nA.\n\nBroad Policy Priorities and Targets\n\n1.\n\nBasic Education1\n\n1.\nThe  Ministry  of  Education  Youth  and  Sport  (MOEYS)  overall  policy  goal  under  the\nEducation Strategic Plan (ESP) is to achieve education for all (EFA) between 2010 and 2015,\nincluding improvement of not only enrolment rates but also participation, attendance, and other\nquality-oriented indicators.

Target:  to  be  determined  by  grade  9  and  grade  12  examinations,\nand posttraining tests of standards, by 2003, and employer satisfaction surveys.\n\n3.\n\nInstitutional Development and Capacity Building for Decentralization\n\n3.\nA  cross-cutting  priority  is  to  strengthen  MOEYS  and  other  stakeholders\u2019  institutional\nsystems,  processes,  and  capacity  to  increasingly  deconcentrate  and  decentralize  authority  to\nprovinces,  districts,  communes,  and  schools  for  education  services  planning,  management,\ndelivery, reporting, and monitoring. The main targets are listed here:\n\nImproved  coordination  systems \nfinancial  planning,  and\nmanagement  between  MOEYS,  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF),  and\nMinistry  of  Planning.  Target:  agreed  medium-term  expenditure  framework,\nMemorandum  of  Understanding,  and  operational  working  groups  by  the  end  of\n2001.\n\nfor  predictable \n\nEffective central MOEYS departmental policy, planning, reporting, and monitoring\noperations,  including  designated  budget  management  centers  (BMCs).  Target:\n80 percent effective by the end of 2003.\n\nFully operational provincial education operations for program planning, reporting,\nand monitoring. Target: 80 percent effective by 2003.\n\nFully  operational  district  education  offices  for  program  management,  and\nimplementation, including the designated 183 BMCs.

Target:  enabling  legislation  by  mid-2002,  selective  regulations  from\nlate 2001 onward.\n\n(viii) \n\nImproved  joint  Government,  MOEYS,  funding  agency,  NGO,  and  civil  society\nmechanisms  for  sector  performance  review,  and  monitoring.  Target:  effective\nannual review exercises from mid-2001 onward.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\n4.\n\nSector Financing\n\n4.\nThe top policy priority is to increase overall expenditures on education, and reduce the\ncost  burden  on  the  poorest  families,  especially  for  basic  education.  An  associated  policy\nobjective  is  to  encourage  greater  private  sector  involvement  in  upper  secondary,  higher\neducation, and TVET. The following are the main financing policy targets by 2005:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nIncreased government spending on education, including an increased share and\nvolume for basic education. Target: KR541 billion ($139 million) annual recurrent\nbudget by 2005, of which 70 percent share for basic education.\n\nReduced  average  parental  contributions \nfor  basic  education  costs,\ncomplemented by increased public spending. Target: reducing parental share of\nunit cost from 50 percent to 18 percent over ESP period (from KR40,000 [$10.3]\nper student in 1997 to KR26,000 [$6.7] in 2005).\n\nIncreased  share  of  recurrent  public  spending  on  nonwage  operational  costs.\nTarget: 48 percent by 2005.\n\nSustained  capital  spending  on  education  development,  especially  for  additional\nprimary,  and  secondary  school  facilities,  and  capacity  building.  Target:  KR570\nbillion($146  million)  (around  KR110  billion  [$28  million]  per  annum)  over  2001-\n2005.\n\nTransitional  recurrent  budget  support  from  the  international  community  to  cover\nany  projected  shortfalls  in  government,  and  private  spending.  Target:  projected\nKR134 billion ($34 million) over 2001-2005.\n\nIncreased  transparency  in  the  financing  of  recurrent,  and  capital  costs  from\nexternal assistance, through the use of the Government's own financial planning\nand  management  systems.

Education Strategic Plan 2001-2005.\n\nThe  General  Education  Teaching  Service  Efficiency  Program.  The  program  will\n7.\nensure  equitable  access  to  education  services  by  reducing  informal  payments  to  teachers  by\npoorer  families;  and  improve  performance  of  the  teaching  service,  linked  to  education  service\nrationalization.  The  primary  strategy  will  be  targeted  incentives  for  priority  groups  of  teachers\nand  school  management  staff,  related  to  criteria  for  more  equitable  staff  deployment  and  staff\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 3, page 5\n\nefficiency. These will be guided by new staff deployment norms introduced in early 2002. The\npriority  groups  will  include  head  teachers,  staff  working  in  remote  and  difficult  circumstances,\nand teachers who teach in multigrade schools and for double shifts. Additional incentives will be\nprovided  for  redeployment  and  relocation  of  nonteaching  staff  back  to  the  classroom.  The\nprogram  will  be  managed  through  180  district  BMCs,  with  monitoring  by  the  Department  of\nPersonnel, based on agreed staffing regulations.\n\n8.\nThe  Basic  Education  Quality  and  Efficiency  Improvement  Program.  The  program\nwill  help  reduce  the  direct  costs  of  poorer  families  by  increasing  government  support  for\noperational  costs  at  both  primary  and  lower  secondary  levels.  This  will  be  facilitated  by\neducation  service  decentralization.  The  main  strategy  will  be  the  provision  of  operational\nbudgets direct to institutions, including primary and secondary schools. The first component will\nbe  to  expand  PAP  provision  of  school  operating  budgets  for  primary  schools  nationwide.  The\nsecond component will be to introduce direct support for school operating budgets into grades 7\nto  9.  For  the  two  components,  funds  will  be  managed  and  channeled  to  schools  by  over  180\ndistrict  BMCs.  The  National  Committee  for  Development  of  General  Education  (NCDGE)  will\nmanage the monitoring of the program.\n\n9.\nThe  Improved  Primary  Progression  and  Retention  Program.  The  program  will\nregulate the age of entry, and increase the student progression rate across grades 1\u20136 and the\ntransition from grade 6 to 7. This will be part of the decentralization strategy. The main activity\nwill be vacation time remedial teaching programs across all six grades, building on the program\nfor  2001.  The  program  will  be  managed  by  180  district  BMCs.  The  Department  of  Primary\nEducation will manage the monitoring of the program on behalf of NCDGE.\n\nThe  Upper  Secondary  Quality  and  Efficiency  Improvement  Program.  The  program\n10.\nwill  help  reduce  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  poorer  families  by  increasing  government\nsupport  for operational costs in upper secondary grades 10-12, as part of the decentralization\nstrategy. A second outcome will be to improve internal staff deployment and pupil-teacher ratios\nby redeploying administrative staff back to the classroom. Meeting the new MOEYS guidelines\nwill be a condition for receiving operational budget support. The main activity will be to introduce\nthe  PAP  for  grades  10-12  in  schools  nationwide  to  over  150  district  BMCs,  including  school\noperating  budgets.  Allowances  for  the  redeployment  of  secondary  school  staff  at  the  district\nlevel will be provided under program 1 (para. 7). The Department of Secondary Education will\nmanage the monitoring of the program.\n\n11.\nThe Higher Education Quality and Efficiency Improvement Program. The outcome\nwill be to improve (i) quality and efficiency of higher education, measured by improved student\nlearning;  and  (ii)  financial  regulation,  management,  and  accountability  of  higher  institutions\nthrough new MOEYS guidelines for public-private partnerships in financing the subsector. The\nmain  component  and  activity  will  be  to  implement  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  recent  guideline  to\nensure  adequate  operational  budget  support  for  higher  education.  The  Department  of  Higher\nEducation will be the BMC for monitoring.\n\n12.\nThe  TVET  Quality  and  Efficiency  Program.  The  program  will  provide  operational\nbudgets to provincial TVET institutions, and funding to the National Training Fund, as part of the\ndecentralization  program.  A  key  objective  will  be  to  secure  quality  improvement  and  financial\nsustainability. The Department of TVET will be the BMC for monitoring.\n\nThe  Teacher  Development  Program.    The  program  will  expand  operations  at  the\n13.\nregional  teacher  training  centers  and  primary  teacher  training  centers  by  providing  operating\nbudgets for these institutions, as part of the decentralization program. The objectives will focus\non  expanding  preservice  and  in-service  programs,  including  full-time  and  part-time  multigrade\nand  multisubject  teaching,  and  continuing  of  teacher  orientation  programs,  especially  for  the\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 3, page 6\n\nintroduction of grades 10-12 textbooks. This will allow for more efficient deployment of teaching\nstaff,  linked  to  the  incentives  under  program  1  (para.  7).  The  Department  of  Teacher  Training\nwill be the BMC for monitoring.\n\n14.\nThe Instruction Materials Program. The program will help secure improved quality and\neducation  standards  in  primary,  lower  secondary,  and  upper  secondary  schools.  The  main\nactivity  will  be  to  provide  core  textbooks  and  additional  selected  complementary  and\nsupplementary  materials  and  workbooks  at  all  levels,  against  agreed  targets  of  provision.\nResources indicated in Table A3.2 cover the provision of one core textbook per student for all\nsubjects  and  grades  (including  grades  10-12)  and  of  selected  complementary  materials.  The\nprogram  will  be  linked  to  the  gradual  commercialization  of  the  Publishing  and  Distribution\nHouse,  MOEYS.  BMC  arrangements  have  yet  to  be  finalized,  although  the  Publishing  and\nDistribution House will be designated to monitor the program.\n\n15.\nThe  Nonformal  Education  Expansion  Program.  The  program  will  provide  cost-\nefficient  and  targeted  complementary  schooling  and  literacy  programs  in  underserved  areas.\nActivities  will  include  literacy  classes,  expansion  of  reentry  programs  for  school  dropouts  into\ngrades 4 and 7, and improved management. BMC arrangements have yet to be finalized. The\nDepartment of Nonformal Education will be responsible for program monitoring.\n\nThe  School  Health  and  Youth  HIV/AIDS2  Awareness  Program.  The  program  will\n16.\nincrease  the  awareness  of  school  and  out-of-school  youth  to  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and\nprevention mechanisms. The target group is an estimated population of 2 million, between the\nages of 11 and 20 years. The main activity will be to launch a nationwide HIV/AIDs information\nand  prevention  campaign,  delivered  through  primary  and  secondary  schools,  and  community\ncenters. The teaching service will be mobilized as major disseminators of HIV/AIDs messages.\nThe Department of Youth and Sport will be the BMC for monitoring.\n\n17.\nThe  Equitable  Access  and  Retention  Program.  The  program  will  provide  targeted\nassistance,  such  as  scholarships  and  social  credits,  to  students  from  poor  families  to  enable\nthem to continue their education to the highest levels that their abilities allow. This initiative will\nalso begin to offset the low levels of participation of the poor at the later stages of education. For\nexample, at present no students from the poorest 20 percent of families are enrolled in higher\neducation,  meaning  that  the  human  potential  of  poor  Cambodian  families  remains  untapped.\nThe  assistance  scheme  will  operate  at  four  levels  including  primary,  lower  secondary,  upper\nsecondary, and higher education. Design, management, and monitoring arrangements have yet\nto be finalized.\n\n2 HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n\n                  \n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nDate of Approval\n\nAmount ($ million)\n\nASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR\n1991-2004\n\nTable A4.1: Asian Development Bank Assistance\n\nNumber\n\nA.

The  benefits  that  will  be\ngenerated will accrue in large measure to poor and vulnerable sections of the population.  The\neconomic  benefits  will  include  (i)  increased  direct  employment;  (ii)  potentially  high  social  and\nprivate  rates  of  return  from  the  investment;  (iii)  improved  efficiency  of  physical  resources  and\npersonnel,  and  in  the  allocation  of  resources;  and  (iv)  addressing  of  public  expenditure\nconstraints to the implementation of the Government\u2019s Education Strategic Plan (ESP).\n\n2.\nSocial  equity  will  be  improved  by  reducing  the  costs  of  access  to  basic  education  for\npoor  and  vulnerable  families  and  thereby  contributing  directly  to  poverty  reduction.  Strata  of\nsociety underrepresented in the school population (girls, ethnic minorities, and remote dwellers)\nwill  benefit  from  increased  inclusion.  The  ESDP  will  also  contribute  to  reducing  regional\ndisparities more generally, through its facilities targeting formulas.\n\nThe  ESDP  will  result  in  institutional  and  governance  benefits.  It  will  contribute\n3.\nsignificantly to the implementation of deconcentration and decentralization policies, and building\nthe  capacities  of  institutions  at  each  level  for  their  increased  functions.    The  management  of\nresources  for  the  education  sector  will  be  improved  through  the  sectorwide  approach.    This\napproach will also have political benefits in shifting genuine ownership of the sector to national\ncontrol,  after  an  era  of  funding  agency  prominence.    The  ESDP  will  contribute  to  governance\nreform;  this  will  contribute  substantially  to  improving  governance  of  the  education  sector,  and\nwill result in improved and more equitable service provision.\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\n1.\n\nIncreased Employment, Economic Growth, and Enhanced Productivity\n\n4.\nThe  ESDP  will  result  directly  in  increased  employment  of  teachers  by  supporting  the\nGovernment\u2019s  plan  to  increase  teacher  supply  through  the  teacher  training  colleges,  and\nthrough  program  support  to  enable  the  Government  to  increase  its  total  teaching  personnel\nexpenditure.  The  program  will  also  provide  for  increased  business  opportunities  and\nemployment  in  the  construction  sector,  particularly  in  the  more  marginalized  provinces  by\nimplementing the facilities development program.\n\nIndirectly,  the  ESDP  will  result  in  increased  rates  of  program  completion  by  students,\n5.\nand  increased  numbers  of  students  gaining  access  to  lower  and  upper  secondary  education.\nData  from  other  countries  suggest  that  the  result  will  be  increased  opportunities  for\nnonsubsistence  employment.  Both  the  social  and  private  rates  of  return  from  investment  in\nlower  secondary  education  are  high,  compared  with  investment  at  other  levels,  based  on\ncalculations from countries at similar levels of development.\n\n6.\nGlobal  studies  demonstrate  a  high  correlation  between  investment  in  educational\nservices and economic growth. Other studies have shown that farmers with primary education\nare more productive because they are more receptive to using modern agricultural techniques.\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\n2.\n\nSector Efficiency\n\n7.\nThe ESDP will support improvement in the efficiency of education spending.  In the ESP,\nthe Government proposes several efficiency measures that will be supported through the policy\nloan and capacity building. Staff will be more productive.  Secondary school and teacher training\ncollege  facilities  will  be  better  used.  Standards  and  improved  assessment  systems  will  be\nintroduced.    Repetition  will  be  reduced.  Technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  utilized  more\neffectively, and made more productive.  Public spending will be more effective. The ESDP will\nalso contribute to enhanced and more efficient provisioning of education services by increasing\ncapacity  utilization  of  recurrent  resources  (by  enabling  double  shift  teaching,  and  multigrade\ndelivery in remote areas).\n\n8.\nStaff  efficiency  will  be  increased  by  (i)  the  transfer  of  nonteaching  staff  at  schools  and\ndistrict  offices  back  into  instructional  positions,  thereby  reducing  the  staff  to  nonteaching  staff\nratio; (ii) increasing the student-staff ratio at secondary schools and teachers colleges; and (iii)\nmaintaining  the  current  student-staff  ratio  in  primary  schooling.  Student-staff  ratios  will  remain\nconstant  (but  high)  at  48  pupils  per  teacher  in  the  primary  sector,  and  rise  for  the  lower\nsecondary sector from 16 pupils per teacher in 2001 to 25 pupils per teacher in 2005. Student-\nstaff  ratios  at  teachers  colleges  will  double  over  the  plan  period.    By  increasing  enrolment  in\ncurrent secondary facilities and teacher training colleges, and introducing the shift system where\nfeasible, existing facilities will be more productive.\n\n9.\nTA  has  not  been  efficiently  utilized  in  the  past.    A  considerable  amount  of  the  TA  has\nbeen  devoted  to  funding  agency  project  implementation  with  less  emphasis  on  capacity\nbuilding.    Separate  international  expertise  has  been  used  for  each  project,  even  though\nobjectives were similar. International expertise from nongovernment organizations (NGOs) has\nfocused on local areas, and not been used to maximum (national) effect.  The ESP intends to\nimprove  the  coordination  of  TA,  and  channel  activities  through  line  ministries,  utilizing  TA  to\nbuild capacity, rather than for discrete project implementation.\n\n10.\nThe effectiveness of public spending will be increased by supporting policy review and\nreform, by enhancing the management of education services, and by supporting improvements\nin  financial  management  and  audit.  These  will  improve  the  quality  of  education  sector  budget\nformulation and implementation. In respect of these objectives, the Government has agreed to\nseveral  fiscal  policy  actions  as  conditions  for  initial  and  subsequent  tranche  releases  of  the\npolicy  loan.  The  focus  on  nonsalary  expenditures  in  the  ESP  will  result  in  an  increase  of  the\nratio of nonsalary expenditures to total expenditures from 26 percent in 2001, to 42 percent in\n2005.  Against  a  backdrop  of  increased  enrolment,  this  represents  a  significant  increase  in\nefficiency  gains.  The  resources  provided  by  the  ESDP  are  critical  to  achieving  this  rise  in\nnonsalary expenditure. The modest increases in salary costs projected in the ESP will generate\nsubstantial benefits in terms of increased enrolments, underpinned by demonstrable efficiency\ngains.  These  efficiency  gains  will  be  further  enhanced  by  the  rise  in  allocations  for  nonsalary\noperating costs. These have tended to be underfunded in the past, with negative implications for\nschool quality.\n\n11.\nThe  ESDP  will  also  support  increased  efficiency  in  the  allocation  of  education  sector\nspending.  In  concert  with  national  policy  on  deconcentration  and  decentralization,  functions,\npowers, and resources will gradually be devolved to subnational agencies to plan, budget, and\ndeliver  education  services.  This  will  result  in  better  matching  expenditure  to  needs,  reduced\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 5, page 3\n\nduplication, and greater synergy among NGO and government agencies delivering educational\nservices.\n\n3.\n\nHealth and Population Benefits\n\n12.\nGlobal  studies  have  shown  that  completion  of  basic  education  has  positive  synergistic\neffects  on  a  number  of  social  indicators  that  in  turn  contribute  to  economic  growth  and\nproductivity.  For  example,  better  educated  women  are  expected  to  have  a  lower  maternal\nmortality rate, and their children will have a lower infant mortality rate.  This will be of particular\nsignificance in the ESDP, which focuses resources on the education of girls in rural and remote\nareas.    More  education  for  girls is also positively correlated with reduced fertility, because  the\nopportunity  costs  of  childbearing  increase  as  educated  women  command  higher  wages  and\nhave  more  employment  opportunities.  Studies  elsewhere  in  Asia  indicate  that  the  nutritional\nstatus  of  a  child  improves  significantly  with  each  year  of  a  mother\u2019s  education  beyond  the\nprimary  grades.    While  these  externalities  are  not  easily  quantified  and  costed,  they  are\nnevertheless  real, and add considerably to the overall rate of return of the investment.\n\n13.\nThe  ESDP  also  promotes  the  containment  of  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic,  which  poses  a\nserious  threat  to  Cambodia,  with  high  prevalence  and  high  growth.  By  utilizing  program\nresources  to  reduce  the  spread  of  the  epidemic,  the  ESDP  will  contribute  more  generally  to\neconomic growth by reducing the risks posed by the epidemic and  mitigating its effects.\n\n4.\n\nIncreased Sector Allocation\n\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  increased  fiscal  stability  to  provide  related  growth\n14.\nbenefits for the Cambodian economy, by enhancing the sustainability and effectiveness of the\npublic  expenditure  policy,  switching  expenditure  in  favor  of  social  services  at  the  expense  of\ngeneral (including military) services. In this context, it has made a medium-term commitment to\nsubstantially  increase  the  recurrent  expenditure  allocation  for  the  education  sector.  This\ncommitment to increase the education sector\u2019s share of total recurrent expenditure is an integral\npart  of  the  overall  transition  the  Government  seeks  to  achieve,  from  a  public  sector  that  is\nfocused  on  the  maintenance  of  internal  and  external  security,  to  one  that  delivers  social  and\neconomic  services  to  citizens  as  part  of  an  overall  poverty-focused  social  and  economic\nstrategy.  These  commitments  are  to  be  reviewed  and  affirmed  on  the  basis  of  the  Interim\nPoverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  increase  the  education\nshare of the total recurrent budget from15.7 percent in 2001, to 19.5 percent in 2004..\n\n15.\nThe  Government  has  also  undertaken  to  provide  real  increases  in  school  operating\nbudgets each year. An analysis of enrolment elasticities in Cambodia carried out by the World\nBank indicates that at the sample mean, a 1 percent increase in public spending on education\nper capita is associated with enrolment ratio increases of 0.3 percent at the primary level, 2.2\npercent  at  the  lower  secondary  level,  and  4.7  percent  at  the  upper  secondary  level.  On  this\nbasis, the elasticity of basic education (primary plus lower secondary) enrolment is expected to\nbe greater than unity.\n\n16.\nIncreased  allocations  for  operating  costs  will  therefore  result  in  direct  and  indirect\nbenefits generated by spending in this sector. In addition, the reduction in private contributions\nrequired  from  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  supplemented  by  a  targeted  assistance  program,\nimplies  that  the  benefits  from  increased  spending  are  enhanced  by  their  positive  impact  on\nthese  groups.  These  increases  are  particularly  important  since  past  experience  shows  that\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 5, page 4\n\nsector budget constraints have resulted in severe underfunding of operational expenditures and\nof expenditure on improving quality.\n\n17.\nProviding  support  for  inputs  therefore  enhances  sustainability  and  the  quality  of\neducation  spending,  and  makes  such  spending  more  effective.  Collectively,  these  policies  will\ngenerate  an  increase  in  nominal  expenditure  on  basic  education  from  KR180,225  million  in\n2001 to KR376,763 million in 2005, according to estimates presented in the ESP. Sustainability\nin  the  education  sector  will  be  improved  by  reducing  the  traditional  underfunding  of  nonwage\nrecurrent expenditure, while at the same time enabling the Government to work within its fiscal\nconstraints and maintaining the recurrent budget balance.\n\n18.\nThe publicly borne salary costs per pupil in nominal terms will be KR67,711 in 2005 as\nopposed to KR50,258 in 2001. This represents a 34 percent increase in salary costs over five\nyears  in  nominal  terms.  Given  an  expected  inflation  rate  of  5  percent  over  this  period,  the\nplanned real increase in wage costs is relatively small.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Equity\n\n1.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\nAccess  to  basic  education  in  Cambodia  involves  sizeable  direct  and  indirect  costs,  the\n19.\nincidence  of  which  falls  significantly  on  private  households.  For  basic  education,  World  Bank\nestimates  indicate  recurrent  spending  costs  to  be  around  KR63,000  per  student,  of  which  53\npercent  of  the  costs  are  privately  borne.  Private  unit  costs  rise  proportionately  for  nonbasic\neducation.  This  results  in  economic  disparities  in  education  access,  with  the  gross  primary\nenrolment ratio for the poorest per capita quintile of the population being 85 percent, while that\nfor  the  richest  quintile  is  113  percent.  This  disparity  has  obvious  negative  intergenerational\neffects on equity.\n\n20.\nThe  policy  loan  directly  addresses  the  problem  of  equity  in  education  access  by\nsupporting  the  Government\u2019s  intent  to  reduce  the  cost  of  basic  education  to  parents.  The\nGovernment has agreed to abolish start-of-year parental contributions in all primary and lower\nsecondary schools, and plans to develop and implement a scheme of incentives to attract and\nkeep  poor  children  in  school.  These  actions  jointly  will  reduce  parental  contributions,  and  will\nparticularly  benefit  the  poor.  This  will  reduce  their  economic  vulnerability(cid:190) defined  as  the\nmarginal  risk  of  decline  in  a  human  life  quality  indicator  (such  as  nutrition  or  literacy)  as  a\nconsequence of a marginal reduction in access to the economic goods that affects that indicator\n(such as health or education). In countries like Cambodia, vulnerability is extremely high even\nfor  populations  contained  in  the  top  quintile  of  the  population  because  of  low  absolute  GDP\ncompounded by adverse income and asset distribution.\n\n21.\nIn  addition,  the  institution  of  a  program  of  targeted  incentives  for  the  rural  poor,\nespecially  for  females,  provides  poverty-  and  gender-targeted  support  to  poor  households.\nBetter equity, results in a wider dissemination of the economic benefits of education across the\npoor and vulnerable sections of the population, and therefore increases resistance to economic\nshocks and access to employment opportunities in a growing and stable economy. Hence, the\nESDP contributes to poverty reduction and enhances general productivity and economic growth.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 5, page 5\n\n2.\n\nSocial Inclusion\n\n22.\nThe ESDP targets disadvantaged gender and ethnic strata in society. It has measures to\nreduce  the  underrepresentation  of  girls  in  schooling  by  supporting  girls\u2019  school  attendance.\nFacilities development will take a whole-school approach and include sanitary facilities for girls,\nthe absence of which is often cited as a reason for low female participation. Capacity building in\nthe  quality  area  will  ensure  even  representation  of  both  genders  in  the  curriculum  and\ninstructional  materials.  The  increased  inclusion  of  girls  in  basic  education  will  result  in  several\neconomic  benefits,  some  of  which  were  referred  to  in  paras.  12  and  13.  More  generally,  the\ninvolvement  of  girls  in  education  will  increase  the  labor  force,  involve  women  in  community\nactivities, expand the economic potential of the country, and strengthen its democratic base.\n\n23.\nThe ESDP targets the marginalized ethnic minorities of the four northeastern provinces,\nfully  described  in  the  Indigenous  People\u2019s  Development  Plan.  The  greater  inclusion  of  such\ngroups,  through  education  services,  in  mainstream  Cambodian  society,  will  increase  their\nidentification  with  the  state,  increase  internal  security,  and  in  the  long-term  provide  Cambodia\nwith a stronger profile as a target for international business investment.\n\n3. \n\nIncreased Regional Equity\n\n24.\nThe investment project will initially focus facilities development on those communes and\nprovinces  where  regional  disparities  in  facilities  provision  are  greatest  (the  most  unserved  or\nunderserved),  based  on  the  management  information  system  of  the  Department  of  Materials\nand  State  Property  (DMSP)  and  field  data.  It  will  also  target  provinces  that  will  not  be\nbeneficiaries  of  facility  rehabilitation  loans  of  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  currently  being\nimplemented. By targeting resources on communes and provinces that are underresourced, and\nwithout  current  facilities  financing  prospects,  the  ESDP  will  contribute  to  increased  regional\nequity  and  ensure  the  spread  of  benefits  throughout  the  country.  Facilities  will  most  likely  be\nprocured  at  province  and  commune  levels,  and  utilize  local  contractors,  providing  jobs  and\nemployment in areas that have traditionally been underprovisioned.\n\nC.\n\nInstitutional and Governance Benefits\n\n1.\n\nDeconcentration and Decentralization\n\nCambodia is committed to deconcentration and decentralization to increase participation\n25.\nin  decision  making  and  performance  monitoring  of  public  services,  leading  to  improved\neffectiveness  and \nincreased  efficiency.  The  ESDP  supports  deconcentration  and\ndecentralization  through  (i)  the  conditions  for  its  program  support,  including  priority  action\nprogram (PAP) support, (ii) its deconcentrated approach to facilities provision, and  (iii) the focus\nof its capacity building for facilities development and decentralized management.\n\n26.\nOf particular importance is the need to improve disbursements under the PAP, which is\nthe  major  vehicle  used  by  the  Government  for  rapid  disbursement  of  resources  to  service\nproviders.  Reviews  of  PAP  performance  in  2000  indicate  substantial  increases  in  economic\nbenefits  as  a  consequence  of  successful  implementation.  Nevertheless,  disbursements  under\nthe  PAP  have  been  well  below  expectations.  By  improving  the  effectiveness  of  the  PAP\nfinancing  mechanism,  through  more  effective  disbursement  methods  and  better  internal  audit,\nthe  ESDP  will  improve  the  effectiveness  of  education  sector  spending,  and  improve\ndeconcentration and decentralization.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 5, page 6\n\n27.\nThe  ESDP  will  also  include  information,  education,  and  communication  support  for  the\nimplementation of decentralized facilities provision, linked to capacity building.  This support will\ndevelop two-way channels of communication between center-province, province-commune, and\ncommune-school, to disseminate policies, procedures, and proposals, and ensure strengthened\nparticipation  at  all  levels.  This  will  contribute  to  the  effective  implementation  of  the\ndecentralization process, ensure effective spending, and assure the rate of loan disbursement\nfor the investment component.\n\n2.\n\nInstitutional Strengthening\n\n28.\nThe  ESDP  has  a  strong  capacity  building  thrust  and  focuses  on  selected  institutions\ncentral  to  service  delivery.  Central  institutions  of  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport\n(MOEYS)  responsible  for  the  planning,  quality,  and  audit  of  facilities  provision  activity  will  be\nsupported in developing their new functions as basic activities are decentralized. Concurrently,\nprovince, districts, and communes, which will be assuming new responsibilities for educational\nservices  provision,  will  be  strengthened  in  these  functions.    The  ESDP  will  also  develop  the\ncapacity  of  institutions  responsible  for  the  quality  of  services,  especially  upper  secondary\neducation, to provide more integrated and efficient programs, and the capacity of the integrated\npublishing  enterprise  to  become  more  commercialized  in  its  operations.  Each  of  these\ninstitutional strengthening exercises will contribute to the more effective and targeted utilization\nof public funds, and enable the Government to implement its efficiency reforms.\n\n3.\n\nSector Management\n\n29.\nThe  ESP  is  Cambodia\u2019s  first  initiative  in  developing  a  comprehensive  and  prioritized\nsectorwide  approach  to  education  development;  this  approach,  if  realized,  will  contribute\nsubstantially  to  improving  utilization  of  government  and  external  funds.  The  key  criteria  in\nprioritizing spending within the ESP are (i) poverty reduction; and (ii) focus on poverty-, gender-,\nregional- and ethnicity-based disparities.\n\n30.\nThe ESDP enhances sustainability by providing policy-based support to supplement the\nrecurrent budget, targeted at protecting service provision to the poor. Initial and tranche release\nconditionalities in the policy matrix will ensure that ADB\u2019s loan support supplements, rather than\nsubstitutes, Government funding by requiring increased allocations to the education sector.\n\n4.\n\nNational Identification\n\n31. When  emerging  from  a  long  period  of  internal  and  external  conflict,  and  foreign\noccupation,  Cambodia  in  the  early  1990s  accepted  external  and  NGO  assistance  from\neverybody, and agreed to whatever conditions and implementation mechanisms were proposed.\nThe  education  sector  was,  from  1990  to  2001,  supported  by  a  plethora  of  projects,\norganizations, and funding agencies, with  numerous project implementation arrangements (see\nlists of current funding agency and NGO assistance to the sector in Appendix 4). Government\ncontrol  of  the  sector  and  its  operations  was  constrained  by  the  need  to  accept  assistance,\nirrespective  of  conditionality.  This  was  most  inefficient,  and  TA  was  utilized  ineffectively.  Most\nsignificantly,  the  role  of  the  Government  and  Cambodian  officials  in  determining  education\npolicy and investment priorities was marginalized.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 5, page 7\n\n32.\nThe  ESP  is  the  Government\u2019s  attempt  to  address  this  loss  of  sovereignty,  and  regain\ncontrol of the development agenda, while maintaining collaboration and participation of funding\nagencies  and  NGOs.    ADB  has  supported  the  ESP  preparation  process  through  TA,  and  will,\nthrough the ESDP, support the implementation of the sector approach. The approach returns to\nGovernment the decision-making role for financial allocation, and reenergizes the structures of\nMOEYS  as  the  means  of  implementation.  This  is  demonstrated  in  the  approaches  for  the\ndisbursement  of  policy  loan  tranches  against  actions  agreed  with  ADB,  the  implementation  of\nthe facilities development through DMSP, and through province and commune authorities; and\nthe focus of TA will be to build capacity rather than to provide management skills. The result will\nbe the stronger identification of education as a service delivered by the Government at central,\nprovincial,  and  commune  levels,  rather  than  by  a  host  of  foreign  funding  agencies,  with\nconcomitant renewed national responsibility for access to and the quality of those services.\n\n5.\n\nImproved Governance\n\nThe ESP is best understood as a program for improving education sector performance\n33.\nby  improving  governance.  It  addresses  the  core  governance  questions  about  how  public\nresources should be allocated, how benefits and costs of allocations should be distributed, and\nwho  is  best  placed  to  decide  on  these  questions.  The  ESP  systematically  addresses  each  of\nthese questions and defines the institutional arrangements and capacities that will be necessary\nto  implement  and  sustain  them.  At  the  national  level,  the  procedures  governing  medium-term\nand annual planning, budgeting, and expenditure of public resources will dramatically improve.\nThe ESDP will be a key and leading-edge program supporting the public finance reforms, and\nreforms in public administration at national, province, and commune levels.\n\n34.\nAt  the  provincial  level,  the  ESDP  will  trial  the  first  step  in  instituting  a  system  of\nintergovernmental fiscal transfers through conditional funds for education facilities. Initially, this\nwill focus on center-province relations, but with the advent of commune councils, the ESDP will\nsupport the establishment of a system of fiscal relations between the center and commune local\ngovernments.  The  ESDP  will  enhance  province,  commune,  and  school  capacity  to  allocate\nresources, judge the relative benefits and costs of these decisions, and increase accountability\nfor the results achieved.\n\n35.\nGiven  the  significance  of  education  sector  spending  in  the  budget  profile  of  provinces\nand communes, the precedents created under the ESDP can be expected to have a profound\ndemonstration  effect  on  the  pace  and  quality  of  implementation  of  the  larger  governance\nreforms to which the Government is committed. In the longer run, increased literacy will in turn\nunderwrite  improved  awareness  of  public  rights  and  responsibilities,  official  systems  of\naccountability,  and  greater  public  access  to  democratic  and  administrative  institutional\nprocedures.  The  result  of  improved  governance  will  be  education  services  that  are  more\nequitably distributed, more accessible to vulnerable and poorer sections of the population, and\nmore  affordable,  both  for  households  and,  through  improved  efficiencies,  for  the  national\nbudget.\n\n.\n\n\f\f\f\fPolicy areas and medium-term\nobjectives\n\nActions to be taken prior to first\ntranche release (expected mid-\nDecember 2001)\n\nActions to be prior to second\ntranche release (expected end\nFebruary 2003)a\n\nActions to be taken prior to third\ntranche release (expected end\nFebruary 2004)a\n\nPOLICY MATRIX\n\n1.

The ESDP supports the Government\u2019s Education\nStrategic Plan (ESP) for 2001-05, which is predicated on a pro-poor platform. ESP policies and\nstrategies are consistent with and contribute to the approved Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy\nPaper (IPRSP), approved in late 2000.\n\nThe  four  areas  of  policy  reform  to  which  the  ESDP  contributes  address  issues  of  (i)\n2.\nincreased resource allocation, (ii) equitable access, (iii) improved quality and efficiency, and (iv)\nenhanced management and deconcentration.\n\nto  assure  an  increased  allocation  to  the  education  sector(cid:190)\n\nESDP support to the four policy areas contribute directly to poverty reduction. In the first\n3.\npolicy  area(cid:190)\nthe  ESDP  will\ncontribute  stability  and  predictability  of  sector  financing,  and  enable  the  Ministry  of  Education,\nYouth  and  Sport  (MOEYS)  to  reduce  the  cost  of  education  to  poor  families.  The  focus  of  the\nsecond  area(cid:190) equitable  access(cid:190) will  reduce  parental  contributions  for  primary  schooling,\nprovide  targeted  assistance  for  the  rural  poor  (especially  girls  and  ethnic  minorities)  and\nfacilities  in  unserved  and  underserved  areas  (especially  rural,  remote,  and  ethnic  minority\nareas), and redeploy teachers to underserved areas.\n\n4.\nThe  third  policy  focuses  on  improving  quality  and  internal  efficiency  of  education\nservices.  Activities  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  poverty  and  gender  targeting  of\ninvestments  by  MOEYS  planners,  and  the  introduction  of  multigrade  approaches  into  primary\neducation  delivery  to  ensure  that  children  in  remote  rural  village  schools  benefit  from  the  full\ncycle  of  primary  education.  The  ESDP  will  also  assure  continued  access  to  instructional\nmaterials, a provision of particular importance to the 36 percent of the population that is living\nbelow the poverty line.\n\n5.\nThe  fourth  policy  area  will  enable  disbursement  of  funds  to  schools  throughout  the\ncountry  to  improve  the  quality  of  instructional  delivery.  It  will  also  increase  community\ninvolvement in financial planning and accountability, and ensure that due consideration is given\nto the poor in policy and implementation at province, commune, and school levels.\n\n6.\nThe ESDP will also contribute indirectly to poverty reduction by increasing net enrolment\nrates,  reducing  repetition  rates,  improving  progression  an  completion  rates,  improving  literacy\nlevels, reducing fertility, and increasing AIDS awareness. MOEYS will be more focused on the\ncontribution of the sector to poverty reduction, and the inclusion of the poor as beneficiaries of\nits services. In the long term, the poor will have more trust in Government and their inclusion in\nits service provision, and will become more directly involved in service evaluation, and thereby\nthe democratization process.\n\n7.\nTable A10 presents the direct and indirect impact of the ESDP on the poor, summarizes\nhow the ESDP contributes to addressing macro policy concerns, and presents key assumptions\non which the effectiveness of each objective for poverty reduction depends.\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nTable A10: Poverty Impact of Policy Actions\n\nObjectives\n\nDirect Impact on the\nPoor\n\nIndirect Impact on\nthe Poor\n\nMacro Policy\nConcerns\nAddressed\n\nAssumptions\n\nImproved stability and\npredictability of\neducation costs\n\nPolicy Area 1: Increased Resource Allocation to the Education Sector\nEstablish national\npolicy and institutional\nframework for the\neducation sector to\nprovide for more\npredictable planning,\nincluding pro-poor\nstrategies.\n\nEnvironment for\nplanning\nimprovements to\neducational services\n\nFinancial\nsustainability of\neducation program;\nrecurrent budget\ninadequacy and\ninstability\n\nCommitment to\nfinancing framework;\neconomic and political\nstability\n\nIncreased allocation\nto the education\nsector, and operating\nbudgets of schools\nand other educational\ninstitutions.\n\nReduced costs of\neducation to poor\nparents;

This population is generally poor and found in remote provinces\nin the northeast of Cambodia. This Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Development Plan (IPDP)1 focuses on\nthe specific interventions aimed to improve the welfare of this population. It is consistent with the\nGovernment\u2019s  Education  Strategic  Plan  (ESP),  draws  on  the  programs  proposed  in  the\nEducation Sector Support Program (ESSP), and includes assistance under the ESDP, as well\nas from other funding agencies.\n\n2.\n\nEthnic Minority People in Cambodia\n\n2.\nCambodia  is  relatively  homogenous  in  ethnic  terms,  with  over  95  percent  of  the\npopulation  Khmer,  and  speaking  Khmer  as  their  mother  language.  The  remaining  5  percent\ncomprises  (i)  ethnic  minority  people  largely  located  in  the  highlands  in  the  northeast;  and  (ii)\nother  ethnic  minorities,  including  Chams  (Muslims,  for  whom  Khmer  is  the  mother  language),\nChinese, Vietnamese, and Lao. The Chinese and Vietnamese total nearly 4 percent of the non-\nKhmer population. Cham people are found mostly in urban areas and along waterways, and are\nintegrated  with  the  Khmer  community.  Ethnic  Chinese  live  in  urban  areas,  and  are  also\nintegrated.  Both  groups  have  established  schools,  offering  special  language  and  religious\ninstruction.  Ethnic  Vietnamese  are \nless  well-integrated  and  have  historically  suffered\ndiscrimination. Many live on houseboats and have an itinerant lifestyle, dependent on fishing for\ntheir livelihoods. Vietnamese children have more difficulty registering at local schools.\n\n3.\nEducation participation and attainment indicators in the highland areas are very poor in\ncomparison with national averages. Most schools attended by highland minority children do not\noffer  the  full  cycle  of  six  primary  grades,  and  participation  and  retention  rates  are  low.\nSecondary schooling is only present in provincial towns, and the enrolment of such schools is\nalmost exclusively the children of ethnic Khmer residents of these provinces. A recent national\nliteracy survey assessed literacy rates within these general ethnic classifications, and found that\nadults  from  highland  minorities  had  much  lower  literate  and  semiliterate  proportions  than  the\nethnic  Khmer.  None  of  the  females  sampled  from  highland  minorities  were  found  to  be\nfunctionally literate, and only 14.3 percent were classified as being semiliterate.\n\nTable A11: Literacy Rates for Khmer and Ethnic Minorities\n\nMinority\n\nIlliterate\n\nLiterate\n\nIlliterate\n\nLiterate\n\nMale\nSemi-\nLiterate\n\nFemale\nSemi-\nLiterate\n\nKhmer\nHighland Minorities\n\n23.2%\n76.3%\n\n28.0%\n18.4%\n\n48.8%\n5.3%\n\n44.1%\n85.7%\n\n26.0%\n14.3%\n\n29.0%\n0.0%\n\nSource: Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport and UNESCO. Report on the Assessment of the Functional\n\nLiteracy Levels of the Adult Population in Cambodia, 2000.\n\n1 While indigenous peoples is the term used by the Asian Development Bank, ethnic minorities is the term used in\n\n                  \n\nCambodia.\n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nCambodia  officially  recognizes  the  ethnic  diversity  of  its  people.  Article  32  of  the  1993\n4.\nConstitution  guarantees  equality  to  all  citizens:  \u201cCambodian  citizens  shall  be  equal  before  the\nlaw  and  shall  enjoy  the  same  rights,  freedom  and  duties  regardless  of  their  race,  color,  sex,\nlanguage,  beliefs,  religions,  political  tendencies,  birth  origin,  social  status,  resources  and  any\nposition.\u201d  Cambodian  citizens  include  the  indigenous  hill  tribes  (collectively  known  as  Khmer\nLoeu)  as  well  as  Cham,  and  long-time  resident  Vietnamese  and  Chinese.  The  Government\ndoes  not  have  detailed  policies  for  ethnic  and  other  minorities.  Its  draft  policy  for  highland\ndevelopment confirms minorities\u2019 constitutional rights, and defines broad goals for development\nof the remote regions.\n\n5.\nKhmer  is  the  only  official  language  and  script  of  Cambodia.  Recently,  scholars  and\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  have  developed  writing  systems  for  the  indigenous\nlanguages  of  Phnong,  Kreung-Brao,  and  Tampuan.  These  scripts  are  being  used  to  develop\ninstructional  materials  for  nonformal  literacy  programs,  but  they  are  currently  not  used  in\ninstruction in public schools and have not been widely adopted.\n\n3.\n\nEthnic Minorities Covered by the Plan\n\n6.\nThe highland ethnic minorities are the focus of the IPDP. They number between 100,000\nand  150,000  in  total,  comprising  just  over  1  percent  of  Cambodia\u2019s  population  of  around  11.6\nmillion. These minorities form the majority of the population in the provinces of Ratanakiri and\nMondulkiri, and most of the remainder are found in the provinces of Kratie, Preah Vihear, and\nSteung  Treng.  Ethnic  minorities  are  a  clearly  defined  target  group  for  the  Government\u2019s  ESP,\nwhich focuses on improving the coverage of basic education to underserved populations.\n\n7.\nThere  is  significant  evidence  that  language  and  ethnicity  are  access  barriers  to\neducation.  Review  of  education  policy,  including  the  work  done  to  prepare  the  ESP,  and  an\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) review of the education needs of ethnic minorities, suggest a\nnumber  of  policy  options  for  attaining  equitable  access,  including  (i)  development  of  primary\neducational  material  and  teacher  training  that  consider  language  differences;  (ii)  review  and\nadaptation of school admission policies, and appropriate regulation to avoid formal and informal\nforms  of  discrimination;  (iii)  an  extensive  information  program  to  promote  the  values  of\neducation,  especially  at  the  primary  level,  linked  to  affirmative  action  to  train  teachers  from\nminority  ethnic  groups;  and  (iv)  the  piloting  of  new  school  models,  including  mobile  schools,\nrevised curricula based on minority languages in the early years, flexible school calendars, and\nselective  boarding  provision.  Several  priority  action  plans  proposed  in  the  ESSP  will  also  play\nan  important  role  by  channeling  funds  to  schools  with  poor  students,  thus  making  education\nmore affordable for the poorest families in Cambodia, including ethnic minority students.\n\nB.\n \n \n\nThe Action Plan\n\n1.\n\nObjective\n\n8.\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  although  indigenous  peoples  constitute  a  mere  1\npercent of the total population, special measures are necessary to address their low education\nlevels. An objective of the ESP, with support from the ESDP, is therefore to take measures to\naddress the low social and educational indicators of the indigenous peoples concentrated in the\nnortheast.\n\n\f79\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\n2.\n\nDevelopment Activities\n\nMeasures  to  improve  access  of  ethnic  minority  students  to  primary  and  secondary\n\n9.\neducation comprise\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ntargeting ethnic minorities when prioritizing facilities subprojects;\nprioritizing  ethnic  minority  boys  and  girls  in  the  award  of  targeted  assistance\nprograms;\nformulating mechanisms to increase the supply of ethnic minority teachers from\nunderserved remote areas;\nformulating redeployment incentives to increase the provision of teachers to such\nareas,  including  the  provision  of  incentives  as  proposed  in  the  Government\u2019s\nESSP; and\npromoting multigrade teaching in small village schools to enable the completion\nof the full primary cycle in places where single-grade teaching is not viable.\n\n10.\nThe  reduction  of  the  cost  of  schooling,  by  eliminating  start-of-year  fees,  will  be\nparticularly  beneficial  to  ethnic  minority  families  whose  incomes  tend  to  be  lower  than  the\nnational average; this measure is expected to improve indigenous peoples\u2019 participation in basic\neducation.\n\n11.\nThe Government is also committed to include measures that will improve the curriculum\nof  ethnic  minority  children,  as  part  of  comprehensive  reform  of  the  curriculum  and  textbook\nsystem.  This  will  be  supported  by  capacity  building  for  curriculum  and  instruction,  that  will  be\npart of the Government\u2019s ESP/ESSP. The Pedagogical Research Department will continue the\nprocess  of  reviewing  its  policy  framework  for  curriculum,  and  will  consider  options  for  the\ninstructional transition from mother language to Khmer.\n\n12.\nAs a consequence of the ESDP\u2019s support for measures to increase deconcentration of\nresponsibility and resources for service delivery to provinces and districts, and the provision of\noperational budgets to all schools, children\u2019s participation and schools in remote ethnic minority\nareas  will  be  improved.  The  ESP  supports,  through  its  modalities  outlined  in  the  ESSP,  more\nparticipation  at  all  levels  at  the  design  stage,  and  by  decentralizing  budgets  and  introducing\ninformation-education-communication  strategies,  more  participation  at  the  grassroots  level  in\nlocal  prioritization  and  implementation.  Such  measures  will  result  in  greater  inclusiveness  of\nethnic minority people.\n\n3.\n\nImplementation of the IPDP\n\nThe  IPDP  will  be  implemented  within  the  context  of  the  ESP;  no  special  line  items  are\n13.\nneeded  for  administrative  arrangements  within  the  support  provided  by  the  ESDP,  or  through\nother  priority  action  program  (PAP)  in  the  ESSP.  For  the  investment  project,  special\nconsideration will be given to the need for targeting ethnic minority communities when selection\ncriteria are developed.\n\n14.\nThe Government will promote the participation of ethnic minorities in determining what is\nbest for their development in the education sector. Their involvement will include an assessment\nof  constraints  that  may  reduce  benefits  accruing  to  indigenous  people  under  the  IPDP.  The\nGovernment will seek assistance for further capacity building for indigenous people, to enable\nthem play a greater role in future education planning, and an assessment of the role of NGOs\nas intermediaries with minority groups.\n\n\f80\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\n15.\nSelected  NGOs  with  experience  with  indigenous  peoples  in  Cambodia  and  other\ncountries  will  be  involved  in  selected  curriculum,  materials,  and  training  program  design\nactivities.  The  NGOs  will  bring  knowledge  of  ethnic  minorities  into  mainstream  development\nwork.\n\n16.\nThe IPDP will be implemented through (i) the five provincial governments with significant\nnumbers  of  ethnic  minorities,  (ii)  two  of  the  MOEYS  line  departments  (Pedagogical  Research\nDepartment, in the case of curriculum policy, and the Teacher Training Department in the case\nof the reform of teacher training to include multigrade teaching), and (iii) Stung Treung Teacher\nTraining  College  (as  the  most  likely  candidate  institution  for  the  development  and  delivery  of\nspecial  programs  for  the  ethnic  minority  teachers).    It  will  also  involve  NGOs  in  the  area  of\nlanguage  transition  issues,  instructional  materials  development,  and  school  attendance\nincentives.\n\n17.\nMOEYS  and  ADB  will  supervise  IPDP  implementation  and  assess  its  effectiveness\nduring the course of regularly scheduled joint missions. Annual sector reviews will ensure that\nall  elements  of  the  IPDP  are  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  program  agreement.  In  the\nfourth year of the ESDP, a dedicated evaluation study will be commissioned on the contribution\nof the ESDP and its IPDP in addressing the needs of ethnic minorities.\n\n4. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe implementation schedule will be embedded in the detailed program schedule to be\n\n18.\ndeveloped.
