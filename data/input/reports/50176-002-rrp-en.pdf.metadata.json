It  will  upgrade  and  expand  the  existing  wastewater \nsystems,  build  institutional  capacity,  and  strengthen  the  sustainability  of  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation (WSS) utilities in Balykchy and Karakol.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIssyk-Kul lake, the second-largest high-altitude lake in the world, is renowned for its clear \nwaters; it is designated as a Ramsar site of globally significant biodiversity,3 and is a key asset of \nthe Issyk-Kul Biosphere Reserve.4 The surrounding Issyk-Kul region is rich with environmental, \narcheological,  and cultural  resources,  and  supports  internationally  important  biodiversity.5 As  a \nconsequence, the region is one of the nation\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, with tourism now \nan important source of revenue, especially for lakeshore cities. The impacts of tourism growth on \nthe  environment  and  ecosystems  of  the  lake  and  shoreline  areas  are  of  growing  concern, \nparticularly in relation to wastewater pollution, and notably in the three primary lakeshore cities of \nBalykchy, Cholpon-Ata, and Karakol. \n \nCore problem.  Balykchy  (population 47,000)  is located  at  the  western  extremity  of the \n4. \nlake;  Karakol  (population  76,000)  is  located  at  the  lake\u2019s  eastern  extremity.  Both  cities  have \nextended  aeration-based  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs)  that  were  constructed  in  the \n1980s.  However,  only  30%  of  the  population  in Balykchy  (3,400  households),  and  45%  of  the \npopulation in Karakol (7,200 households) are currently connected to the centralized systems. The \nWWTPs are dilapidated and treat only about 8 million liters per day (MLD) of wastewater through \nsedimentation. The remaining 14 MLD of wastewater is disposed of through unsanitary pit latrines \nand other methods characterized by poor maintenance and lack of adequate septage collection \nand disposal. While most  resorts maintain  sewage treatment facilities,  monitoring  of  treatment \noperations  and effluent quality  is  inadequate. The  combination  of  partially  operating  sewerage \nsystems,  self-provision  of  sanitation facilities,  and  inadequate  monitoring  of  sewage discharge \nfrom resorts pose a significant threat to the lake\u2019s water quality, leading to increased public health \nrisks and environmental degradation. These in turn limit tourism development, which relies heavily \non the lake\u2019s environment.6 \n \nVodokanal enterprises in Balykchy and Karakol are responsible for WSS services.7 Their \n5. \nexpenditures  are  high  due  to  operational  inefficiencies  arising  from  the  aging  system,  poor \noperational and management capacity and lack of maintenance equipment. Staff incentives are \n\n                                                \n1  Formerly the Second Issyk-Kul Sustainable Development Project, listed in Country Operations Business Plan, 2018\u2013\n\n2020.

Manila. \n\n3  The Ramsar Convention is an international treaty relating to the sustainable use and conservation of wetlands. \n4  The reserve was designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 2001. \n5  The Issyk-Kul region covers an area of approximately 43,100 km2 and has an estimated population of 483,000. \n6  Public health and environmental risks from these practices include groundwater contamination, and diseases related \n\nto poor sanitation such as hepatitis, typhoid, and ascariasis. \n\n7   Vodokanal enterprises are municipal enterprises responsible for WSS services in the nation\u2019s cities and towns. \n\n\f2 \n\nlow, with no corporate motivation mechanisms. The vodokanals are unable to recover operating \ncosts through their revenues and rely on budget support. To improve their cash flows, vodokanals \nneed to develop corporate-oriented business plans and service standards, train and retain skilled \nstaff  in  technical  and  financial  management  to  improve  the  operational  efficiency  and  provide \nbetter customer services, so that customers are willing to pay increased tariffs. \n \n6. \nSector policies and institutional arrangements. Government targets for WSS services \nfocus  on  inclusive  development  to  improve  functionality,  enhance  service  levels,  and  expand \nmunicipal sanitation. In terms of policy, this includes a targeted strategy for WSS development to \n2026,8 and  a  national  strategy  to  guide  sustainable  development  to  2040.9 A  comprehensive \nlegislative and regulatory framework for environmental and natural resource protection has also \nbeen  enacted  with  project  responsibility  recently  transferred  to  the  technically  oriented \nDepartment  of  Drinking  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Development  (DDWSSD). 10 The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  assistance  through  the  Issyk-Kul  Sustainable \nDevelopment Project,11 which improved wastewater collection systems and provided institutional \nstrengthening  in  both  Balykchy  and  Karakol.  Other  development  partners  also  provide  WSS \nsector assistance.12 \n \n7. \n Priority needs. Wastewater treatment in both cities is inadequate, and the dilapidated \nWWTPs  urgently  require  upgrading  to  meet  effluent  discharge  standards.  This  is  widely \nrecognized as essential for the proper functioning of the systems and their subsequent expansion. \nThe management of septage from private sanitation facilities needs to be improved, and sludge \ndischarged from the Karakol WWTP to a reservoir needs to be removed. Building on the original \nIssyk-Kul Sustainable Development Project (footnote 11) institutional development initiatives, the \nvodokanals require further strengthening to increase their financial management and operation \nand maintenance (O&M) capabilities, and to continue their adoption of modern, best practices in \nutility operations. \n \nProposed project. Complementing the Issyk-Kul Sustainable Development Project, the \n8. \nproject  will  upgrade  the  WWTPs  with  new  technology,  further  expand  the  networks,  improve \nprivate facility septage management, and remove wastewater sludge from a reservoir in Karakol. \nIt  will  further  build  the  capacities  of  the  two  vodokanals  through  structural  strengthening  and \ntargeted  personnel training  in utility  corporate  planning,  O&M,  and financial  management. The \nproject  will  support  the  following  operational  priority  areas  of  Strategy  2030:13 (i)  making  cities \nmore livable, (ii) enhancing environmental sustainability, and (iii) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan 2011\u20132020, \n\n                                                \n8  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2016.

The process will meet both national and \ninternational  effluent  discharge  standards  for  irrigation.28 The  WWTPs  will  be  located  on  the \nexisting facility sites, and the discharge of effluent for irrigation use will ensure that effluent will \nnot  be  discharged  to  Issyk-Kul  lake. Although  WWTP  upgrading  is  the  key  project  focus,  the \nproject also includes (i) sewer extensions as a priority because of the low wastewater collection \ncoverage  in  both  cities;  and  (ii)  a  septage  management  program  to  improve  the  quality  and \n\n                                                \n27 This included analysis of capital and O&M costs, proven performance, process complexity, variable load capability, \n\nvodokanal process familiarity, odor generation potential, and biosolids and their stability. \n\n28 The  process  also  includes  a  tertiary  treatment  component  to  satisfy  the  stringent  Kyrgyz  Republic  standard  for \n\nammonia. \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\ncoverage  of  septage  collection  and  disposal  services  for  consumers  that  are  not  currently \nconnected  to  the  centralized  system.  During  the  final  design  and  construction  of  the  project\u2019s \ncomponents, close interaction will be maintained with other development partner-funded projects \nto ensure coordination and alignment. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  quantified  economic  benefits  of  the  project  include  (i)  public \nhealth  benefits  ensuing  from  improved  sanitation  and  hygiene  in  the  project  areas,  and  (ii) \nincremental  tourism  benefits  to  the  local  economies  of  Balykchy  and  Karakol  as  a  result  of \nenhancements in their wastewater collection and treatment systems. The health benefits of the \nproject were calculated by using savings in disability adjusted life years as a proxy for the reduced \nincidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  particularly  diarrhea  and  parasitic  diseases.  The  tourism \nbenefits  were  estimated  based  on  an  assessment  of  the  incremental  increase  in  international \nvisitor arrivals with the project, as well as their length of stay and average daily spending. The \nresults  of  the  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  demonstrated  that  the  project  is  economically  viable,  with \neconomic internal rates of return of 12.3%\u201313.4%, exceeding the minimum prescribed discount \nrate of 9%. A sensitivity analysis conducted showed that the project will be economically robust \nunder  various  scenarios,  including  a  10%  increase  in  investment  cost  and  a  10%  decline  in \nbenefits. \n \n22. \nFinancial analysis. A financial analysis was undertaken by establishing cash flows over \nthe project life to ensure that project revenues fully cover O&M costs. For Balykchy, the combined \nwater and wastewater tariff rates will need to be increased by 7% in real term annually starting in \n2019, which is equal to the average historical tariff increases during 2001\u20132018. By 2025, when \nthe  project  benefit  period  starts,  this  will  raise  the  wastewater  tariff  from  Som4.53/m3  to \nSom7.78/m3, with  an  estimated  monthly  billing  of  Som269,  which  would  be  affordable  for  the \ntarget beneficiaries. Similarly, the wastewater tariff in Karakol will increase from Som1.84/m3 to \nSom4.30/m3,  with  an  estimated  monthly  billing  of  Som116,  which  is  within  the  acceptable \nstandards of affordability for WSS services.29 The project\u2019s public awareness program will help \nbuild consumer acceptance of the proposed tariff increases by linking them to the public health \nand tourism benefits anticipated from the project. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nThe financial management risk of the DDWSSD is considered high because (i) while its \nstaff are experienced in procurement, design, and WSS facility construction, they lack knowledge \nand  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  guidelines  and  procedures;  (ii)  their  existing \naccounting  system  is  adequate,  but  will  require  modification  to  integrate  appropriate  project-\nspecific  accounting,  budgeting,  auditing,  and  reporting;  and  (iii)  they  have  no  prior  experience \nacting as an executing agency, with responsibility for loan and grant disbursements and advance \naccount  management.  The  risk  rating  for  the  Balykchy  and  Karakol  vodokanals  is  moderate, \nbecause (i) they have qualified and trained staff for the PIOs, (ii) have experience in preparing \nrealistic project budgets, and (iii) have implemented other development partner-financed projects, \nthough  limited  experience  in  ADB  project.  The  agreed  financial  management  action  plan  for \nDDWSSD and the vodokanals includes (i) enabling long-term project involvement by transferring \nexisting DDWSSD staff to the PMO; (ii) preparing a project manual, detailing ADB disbursement \npolicies and procedures; (iii) providing training and consultant support in the key areas of ADB \n                                                \n29 The draft loan agreement includes an operational covenant to ensure that, within 2 years of the loan\u2019s effective date, \nthe executing  agency  prepares  and commences  the  implementation  of  a  wastewater  tariff  road  map  to  gradually \nensure O&M expenditure recovery, while also ensuring affordable access by low-income households. \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nproject  financial  management;  and  (iv)  upgrading  their  accounting  systems  to  facilitate  the \npreparation of project financial statements and documentation of withdrawal applications. \n \n24. \nThe project procurement risk assessment shows the procurement risk is high because of  \n(i)  the  lack  of  an  established  procurement  unit  in  DDWSSD,  (ii)  DDWSSD\u2019s  unfamiliarity  with \ndevelopment  partner-funded  project  procurement  principles  and  procedures,  and  (iii) \ninconsistencies  between  national  procurement  laws  and  bidding  documents  and  procurement \nrequirements for development partner-funded projects. The following measures will mitigate the \nrisk:  (i)  consultant  assistance  to  strengthen  DDWSSD  and  ensure  economical,  efficient,  and \ntransparent procurement; (ii) close government agency coordination to minimize approval delays; \nand  (iii)  actions  to  ensure  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment  follow  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Gosstroy,  DDWSSD,  PRGIKO,  and  the  vodokanals.  The  specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nD. \n \nThe  deterioration  of  WSS  infrastructure  and  services  affects  health,  productivity  and \n26. \nwelfare of the population, particularly the poor. In Balykchy and Karakol, there are an estimated \n17,600  poor  households,  accounting  for  over  50%  of  the  aggregate  household  population. 30 \nAlthough households connected to the centralized sewerage systems in these cities encounter \ndeficiencies,31 it  is  the  unconnected  households  using  unsanitary  pit  latrines  and  other  basic \nmethods  of  wastewater  disposal  that  are  at  greatest  risk.  As  women  are  often  responsible for \ncaring  for  household  members,  they  are  more  affected  by  deficiencies  in  WSS  services.  This \nincludes  spending  about  68%  of  their  time  on  domestic  work,  including  fetching  and  treating \nwater.32 When WSS is poor, women bear the burden of caring for sick household members.33 The \nproject is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan will ensure women\u2019s \nparticipation in the project\u2019s decision-making activities by (i) ensuring improved sanitation services \nfor  households  and  businesses;  (ii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  vodokanals  and  local \ngovernment  to  provide  adequate  and  efficient  sanitation  services;  (iii)  ensuring  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  consultation  and  public  awareness  activities;  (iv)  establishing  local  working \ncommittees  in  the  cities,  each  with  30%  female  members; 34 and  (v)  establishing  a  customer \nrelations mechanism that includes gender-sensitive grievance redress. \n \nE. \n \n27. \ncategories are as follows.35 \n \n28. \nEnvironment (category B). By expanding wastewater collection and improving treatment, \nthe project will significantly reduce (i) nutrients, pathogenic elements, and contaminants released \n                                                \n30 The highest poverty incidence is in Balykchy, where over 70% of households are considered poor. \n31 Including blocked pipes, odor, and system overflow issues. \n32 National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2011.

No unavoidably severe or permanent negative impacts are likely to arise from \nproject  activities  provided  that  appropriate  mitigation  measures  are  adopted.  Temporary \nenvironmental impacts occurring during construction can be managed, minimized, and mitigated. \nOperational impacts will be contained within sanitary protection zones (SPZs) around facilities.36 \nThe accidental leakage of untreated effluents will not discharge to Issyk-Kul lake or its core or \nbuffer zones\u2014by design, treated effluents will be  used for irrigation\u2014and the risk of untreated \neffluent discharge to the lake is, therefore, negligible. The environmental management plan (EMP) \nincludes mitigation measures to address construction and operation impacts. Public consultations \nhave been conducted in both Balykchy and Karakol. \n \n29. \nThe  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  EMP  implementation,  and  for  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguards requirements and national environmental regulations. The PMO\u2019s safeguard staff will \nbe  assisted  by  an  international  environment  specialist  and  the  project  design  and  supervision \nconsultant to oversee the  implementation  of  the EMP.  The  cost to implement the  EMP  will  be \nfinanced  by  the  project.37 A  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  handle  both  environmental  and \nsocial safeguard issues will be established in the vodokanals. The PMO will submit semiannual \nenvironmental monitoring reports to ADB and relevant government authorities. These reports will \nbe disclosed to the public on the Gosstroy (in Russian or Kyrgyz) and ADB (in English) websites. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Detailed  measurement  surveys  carried  out \n30. \nduring  project  preparation  identified  approximately  26  affected  households  with  a  total  of  99 \nhousehold  members,  of  which  approximately  15  households  with  67  members  will  experience \nsevere  impacts  on  their  livelihood  because  they  will  be  required  to  relocate. 38  No  affected \nhousehold was found to belong to a vulnerable group. A land acquisition and resettlement plan \n(LARP)  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  have  been  prepared  to  mitigate  and \naddress all associated losses in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant \nnational legislation. Project information was disclosed and meaningful consultations with project \nstakeholders and displaced persons were undertaken during LARP preparation and will continue \nthroughout implementation. When final SPZ boundaries are decided by the government and the \nproject design is finalized, or additional land requirements or involuntary resettlement impacts are \nidentified, the  LARP  will  be  updated  in accordance with applicable laws  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, and ADB approval obtained prior to any further implementation. All displaced \npeople  will  receive  compensation  in  accordance  with  the  LARP  provisions.  The  PMO  will  be \nresponsible for land acquisition and resettlement implementation and for compliance with ADB\u2019s \nsafeguards requirements and national regulations.
