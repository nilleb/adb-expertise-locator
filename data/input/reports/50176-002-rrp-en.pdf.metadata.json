THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed (i) loan \nand (ii) grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Issyk-Kul Wastewater Management Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve wastewater services in two lakeshore cities on Issyk-Kul lake, in \nthe eastern region of the Kyrgyz Republic. It will upgrade and expand the existing wastewater \nsystems, build institutional capacity, and strengthen the sustainability of the water supply and \nsanitation (WSS) utilities in Balykchy and Karakol.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Issyk-Kul lake, the second-largest high-altitude lake in the world, is renowned for its clear \nwaters; it is designated as a Ramsar site of globally significant biodiversity,3 and is a key asset of \nthe Issyk-Kul Biosphere Reserve.4 The surrounding Issyk-Kul region is rich with environmental, \narcheological, and cultural resources, and supports internationally important biodiversity.5 As a \nconsequence, the region is one of the nation\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, with tourism now \nan important source of revenue, especially for lakeshore cities. The impacts of tourism growth on \nthe environment and ecosystems of the lake and shoreline areas are of growing concern, \nparticularly in relation to wastewater pollution, and notably in the three primary lakeshore cities of \nBalykchy, Cholpon-Ata, and Karakol. \n \n4.  Core problem. Balykchy (population 47,000) is located at the western extremity of the \nlake; Karakol (population 76,000) is located at the lake\u2019s eastern extremity. Both cities have \nextended aeration-based wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that were constructed in the \n1980s. However, only 30% of the population in Balykchy (3,400 households), and 45% of the \npopulation in Karakol (7,200 households) are currently connected to the centralized systems. The \nWWTPs are dilapidated and treat only about 8 million liters per day (MLD) of wastewater through \nsedimentation. The remaining 14 MLD of wastewater is disposed of through unsanitary pit latrines \nand other methods characterized by poor maintenance and lack of adequate septage collection \nand disposal. While most resorts maintain sewage treatment facilities, monitoring of treatment \noperations and effluent quality is inadequate. The combination of partially operating sewerage \nsystems, self-provision of sanitation facilities, and inadequate monitoring of sewage discharge \nfrom resorts pose a significant threat to the lake\u2019s water quality, leading to increased public health \nrisks and environmental degradation. These in turn limit tourism development, which relies heavily \non the lake\u2019s environment.6 \n \n5.  Vodokanal enterprises in Balykchy and Karakol are responsible for WSS services.7 Their \nexpenditures are high due to operational inefficiencies arising from the aging system, poor \noperational and management capacity and lack of maintenance equipment. Staff incentives are \n                                                \n1  Formerly the Second Issyk-Kul Sustainable Development Project, listed in Country Operations Business Plan, 2018\u2013\n2020. Manila. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2016. Technical Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for Preparing the Second Issyk-\nKul Sustainable Development Project. Manila. \n3  The Ramsar Convention is an international treaty relating to the sustainable use and conservation of wetlands. \n4  The reserve was designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 2001. \n5  The Issyk-Kul region covers an area of approximately 43,100 km2 and has an estimated population of 483,000. \n6  Public health and environmental risks from these practices include groundwater contamination, and diseases related \nto poor sanitation such as hepatitis, typhoid, and ascariasis. \n7  Vodokanal enterprises are municipal enterprises responsible for WSS services in the nation\u2019s cities and towns. ", "2 \nlow, with no corporate motivation mechanisms. The vodokanals are unable to recover operating \ncosts through their revenues and rely on budget support. To improve their cash flows, vodokanals \nneed to develop corporate-oriented business plans and service standards, train and retain skilled \nstaff in technical and financial management to improve the operational efficiency and provide \nbetter customer services, so that customers are willing to pay increased tariffs. \n \n6.  Sector policies and institutional arrangements. Government targets for WSS services \nfocus on inclusive development to improve functionality, enhance service levels, and expand \nmunicipal sanitation. In terms of policy, this includes a targeted strategy for WSS development to \n2026,8 and a national strategy to guide sustainable development to 2040.9 A comprehensive \nlegislative and regulatory framework for environmental and natural resource protection has also \nbeen  enacted  with  project  responsibility  recently  transferred  to  the  technically  oriented \nDepartment of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Development (DDWSSD).10 The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  assistance  through  the  Issyk-Kul  Sustainable \nDevelopment Project,11 which improved wastewater collection systems and provided institutional \nstrengthening in both Balykchy and Karakol. Other development partners also provide WSS \nsector assistance.12 \n \n7.   Priority needs. Wastewater treatment in both cities is inadequate, and the dilapidated \nWWTPs  urgently  require  upgrading  to  meet  effluent  discharge  standards.  This  is  widely \nrecognized as essential for the proper functioning of the systems and their subsequent expansion. \nThe management of septage from private sanitation facilities needs to be improved, and sludge \ndischarged from the Karakol WWTP to a reservoir needs to be removed. Building on the original \nIssyk-Kul Sustainable Development Project (footnote 11) institutional development initiatives, the \nvodokanals require further strengthening to increase their financial management and operation \nand maintenance (O&M) capabilities, and to continue their adoption of modern, best practices in \nutility operations. \n \n8.  Proposed project. Complementing the Issyk-Kul Sustainable Development Project, the \nproject will upgrade the WWTPs with new technology, further expand the networks, improve \nprivate facility septage management, and remove wastewater sludge from a reservoir in Karakol. \nIt will further build the capacities of the two vodokanals through structural strengthening and \ntargeted personnel training in utility corporate planning, O&M, and financial management. The \nproject will support the following operational priority areas of Strategy 2030:13 (i) making cities \nmore livable, (ii) enhancing environmental sustainability, and (iii) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan 2011\u20132020, \n                                                \n8  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2016.

The wastewater treatment technology adopted for Karakol and Balykchy was agreed with \nthe vodokanals in both cities through a multi-criteria analysis.27 This resulted in the selection of \nthe intermittently decanted extended aeration lagoon technology, which is a variant of an activated \nsludge process with which the vodokanals are familiar. The process will meet both national and \ninternational effluent discharge standards for irrigation.28 The WWTPs will be located on the \nexisting facility sites, and the discharge of effluent for irrigation use will ensure that effluent will \nnot be discharged to Issyk-Kul lake. Although WWTP upgrading is the key project focus, the \nproject also includes (i) sewer extensions as a priority because of the low wastewater collection \ncoverage in both cities; and (ii) a septage management program to improve the quality and \n                                                \n27 This included analysis of capital and O&M costs, proven performance, process complexity, variable load capability, \nvodokanal process familiarity, odor generation potential, and biosolids and their stability. \n28 The process also includes a tertiary treatment component to satisfy the stringent Kyrgyz Republic standard for \nammonia. \n ", "7 \ncoverage of septage collection and disposal services for consumers that are  not currently \nconnected to the centralized system. During the final design and construction of the project\u2019s \ncomponents, close interaction will be maintained with other development partner-funded projects \nto ensure coordination and alignment. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  Economic analysis. The quantified economic benefits of the project include (i) public \nhealth benefits ensuing from improved sanitation and hygiene in the project areas, and (ii) \nincremental tourism benefits to the local economies of Balykchy and Karakol as a result of \nenhancements in their wastewater collection and treatment systems. The health benefits of the \nproject were calculated by using savings in disability adjusted life years as a proxy for the reduced \nincidence of waterborne diseases, particularly diarrhea and parasitic diseases. The tourism \nbenefits were estimated based on an assessment of the incremental increase in international \nvisitor arrivals with the project, as well as their length of stay and average daily spending. The \nresults of the cost\u2013benefit analysis demonstrated that the project is economically viable, with \neconomic internal rates of return of 12.3%\u201313.4%, exceeding the minimum prescribed discount \nrate of 9%. A sensitivity analysis conducted showed that the project will be economically robust \nunder various scenarios, including a 10% increase in investment cost and a 10% decline in \nbenefits. \n \n22.  Financial analysis. A financial analysis was undertaken by establishing cash flows over \nthe project life to ensure that project revenues fully cover O&M costs. For Balykchy, the combined \nwater and wastewater tariff rates will need to be increased by 7% in real term annually starting in \n2019, which is equal to the average historical tariff increases during 2001\u20132018. By 2025, when \nthe  project  benefit  period  starts,  this  will  raise  the  wastewater  tariff  from  Som4.53/m3  to \nSom7.78/m3, with an estimated monthly billing of Som269, which would be affordable for the \ntarget beneficiaries. Similarly, the wastewater tariff in Karakol will increase from Som1.84/m3 to \nSom4.30/m3,  with  an  estimated monthly  billing  of  Som116,  which  is  within  the  acceptable \nstandards of affordability for WSS services.29 The project\u2019s public awareness program will help \nbuild consumer acceptance of the proposed tariff increases by linking them to the public health \nand tourism benefits anticipated from the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  The financial management risk of the DDWSSD is considered high because (i) while its \nstaff are experienced in procurement, design, and WSS facility construction, they lack knowledge \nand  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  guidelines  and  procedures;  (ii)  their  existing \naccounting system is adequate, but will require modification to integrate appropriate project-\nspecific accounting, budgeting, auditing, and reporting; and (iii) they have no prior experience \nacting as an executing agency, with responsibility for loan and grant disbursements and advance \naccount management. The risk rating for the Balykchy and Karakol vodokanals is moderate, \nbecause (i) they have qualified and trained staff for the PIOs, (ii) have experience in preparing \nrealistic project budgets, and (iii) have implemented other development partner-financed projects, \nthough limited experience in ADB project. The agreed financial management action plan for \nDDWSSD and the vodokanals includes (i) enabling long-term project involvement by transferring \nexisting DDWSSD staff to the PMO; (ii) preparing a project manual, detailing ADB disbursement \npolicies and procedures; (iii) providing training and consultant support in the key areas of ADB \n                                                \n29 The draft loan agreement includes an operational covenant to ensure that, within 2 years of the loan\u2019s effective date, \nthe executing agency prepares and commences the implementation of a wastewater tariff road map to gradually \nensure O&M expenditure recovery, while also ensuring affordable access by low-income households. \n ", "8 \nproject financial management; and (iv) upgrading their accounting systems to facilitate the \npreparation of project financial statements and documentation of withdrawal applications. \n \n24.  The project procurement risk assessment shows the procurement risk is high because of  \n(i) the lack of an established procurement unit in DDWSSD, (ii) DDWSSD\u2019s unfamiliarity with \ndevelopment  partner-funded  project  procurement  principles  and  procedures,  and  (iii) \ninconsistencies between national procurement laws and bidding documents and procurement \nrequirements for development partner-funded projects. The following measures will mitigate the \nrisk: (i) consultant assistance to strengthen DDWSSD and ensure economical, efficient, and \ntransparent procurement; (ii) close government agency coordination to minimize approval delays; \nand (iii) actions to ensure procurement and consultant recruitment follow ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Ministry of Finance, Gosstroy, DDWSSD, PRGIKO, and the vodokanals. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  The deterioration of WSS infrastructure and services affects health, productivity and \nwelfare of the population, particularly the poor. In Balykchy and Karakol, there are an estimated \n17,600 poor households, accounting for over 50% of the aggregate household population.30 \nAlthough households connected to the centralized sewerage systems in these cities encounter \ndeficiencies,31 it is the unconnected households using unsanitary pit latrines and other basic \nmethods of wastewater disposal that are at greatest risk. As women are often responsible for \ncaring for household members, they are more affected by deficiencies in WSS services. This \nincludes spending about 68% of their time on domestic work, including fetching and treating \nwater.32 When WSS is poor, women bear the burden of caring for sick household members.33 The \nproject is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan will ensure women\u2019s \nparticipation in the project\u2019s decision-making activities by (i) ensuring improved sanitation services \nfor households and businesses; (ii) strengthening the capacity of the vodokanals and local \ngovernment  to  provide  adequate  and  efficient  sanitation  services;  (iii)  ensuring  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  consultation  and  public  awareness  activities;  (iv)  establishing  local  working \ncommittees in the cities, each with 30% female members;34 and (v) establishing a customer \nrelations mechanism that includes gender-sensitive grievance redress. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.35 \n \n28.  Environment (category B). By expanding wastewater collection and improving treatment, \nthe project will significantly reduce (i) nutrients, pathogenic elements, and contaminants released \n                                                \n30 The highest poverty incidence is in Balykchy, where over 70% of households are considered poor. \n31 Including blocked pipes, odor, and system overflow issues. \n32 National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2011.

Safeguard Categories. \n \n ", "9 \nto the environment; (ii) the risk to Issyk-Kul lake from eutrophication; and (iii) human health threats \nfrom pathogens. No unavoidably severe or permanent negative impacts are likely to arise from \nproject  activities  provided  that  appropriate  mitigation  measures  are  adopted.  Temporary \nenvironmental impacts occurring during construction can be managed, minimized, and mitigated. \nOperational impacts will be contained within sanitary protection zones (SPZs) around facilities.36 \nThe accidental leakage of untreated effluents will not discharge to Issyk-Kul lake or its core or \nbuffer zones\u2014by design, treated effluents will be used for irrigation\u2014and the risk of untreated \neffluent discharge to the lake is, therefore, negligible. The environmental management plan (EMP) \nincludes mitigation measures to address construction and operation impacts. Public consultations \nhave been conducted in both Balykchy and Karakol. \n \n29.  The PMO will be responsible for EMP implementation, and for compliance with ADB\u2019s \nsafeguards requirements and national environmental regulations. The PMO\u2019s safeguard staff will \nbe assisted by an international environment specialist and the project design and supervision \nconsultant to oversee the implementation of the EMP. The cost to implement the EMP will be \nfinanced by the project.37 A grievance redress mechanism to handle both environmental and \nsocial safeguard issues will be established in the vodokanals. The PMO will submit semiannual \nenvironmental monitoring reports to ADB and relevant government authorities. These reports will \nbe disclosed to the public on the Gosstroy (in Russian or Kyrgyz) and ADB (in English) websites. \n \n30.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Detailed  measurement  surveys  carried  out \nduring project preparation identified approximately 26 affected households with a total of 99 \nhousehold members, of which approximately 15 households with 67 members will experience \nsevere impacts on their livelihood because they will be required to relocate.38 No affected \nhousehold was found to belong to a vulnerable group. A land acquisition and resettlement plan \n(LARP) and land acquisition and resettlement framework have been prepared to mitigate and \naddress all associated losses in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant \nnational legislation. Project information was disclosed and meaningful consultations with project \nstakeholders and displaced persons were undertaken during LARP preparation and will continue \nthroughout implementation. When final SPZ boundaries are decided by the government and the \nproject design is finalized, or additional land requirements or involuntary resettlement impacts are \nidentified, the LARP will be updated in accordance with applicable laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, and ADB approval obtained prior to any further implementation. All displaced \npeople will receive compensation in accordance with the LARP provisions. The PMO will be \nresponsible for land acquisition and resettlement implementation and for compliance with ADB\u2019s \nsafeguards requirements and national regulations. DDWSSD will submit semiannual safeguards \nmonitoring reports to ADB for review and disclosure. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples, as defined in ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, in the project area. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n32.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.39 \n                                                \n36 Mostly relating to sludge disposal, odor, and noise from WWTPs and pumping stations, and from chlorination. \n37 The costs of mitigation measures and environmental monitoring will be included in construction contracts. The cost \nof environmental monitoring and supervision are included in the project design and supervision consultant contract. \n38 These resettlement initiatives are necessary in order to comply with SPZ development restrictions that surround \nWWTPs and pump stations. \n39 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nChanges  in  government  approval  Close government agency coordination will be maintained to minimize \nprocedures  by  oversight  agencies  delays in procurement and approvals. \ndelays project completion. \nDDWSSD  personnel\u2019s  unfamiliarity  PMO and DDWSSD staff will participate in ADB procurement training and \nwith  ADB  procurement  procedures  be familiar with relevant guidelines.a ADB will undertake prior review of all \nresults  in  procurement  deficiencies  contract procurement and closely monitor contract implementation. \nand implementation delays. \nWastewater  tariff  increases  do  not  The project\u2019s public awareness program will build consumer acceptance of \nmeet  expected  levels  because  of  proposed tariff increases by linking them to the project\u2019s anticipated public \npolitical uncertainty.  health and tourism benefits. \nHigh  financial  management  risk  Existing government staff will be appointed to the PMO; a project manual \nbecause  staff  lack  knowledge  and  will be prepared, detailing ADB disbursement policies and procedures; \nunderstanding of ADB\u2019s disbursement  training and consultant support will be provided; and accounting systems \nguidelines and procedures.  will be upgraded to facilitate the preparation of project financial statements \nand documentation of withdrawal applications.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DDWSSD = Department of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Development, \nPMO = project management office. \na ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.
