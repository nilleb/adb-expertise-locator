The \nbudget  support  through  the  ERSP  will  give  a  short-term  boost  to \neconomic activity in response to the global economic crisis. It will be \ncomplemented by structural and governance measures that will aid in \neconomic recovery, and by measures that will help protect the vulnerable \nand safeguard the fiscal position of the Cook Islands.  \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsectors): Multisector (public sector management; transport, \nand information and communication technology; heath and social \nprotection; energy; water supply and other municipal infrastructure and \nservices) \nThemes (subthemes): Economic growth (promoting economic efficiency \nand enabling business environment, widening access to markets and \neconomic opportunities); governance (economic and financial \ngovernance) \nClimate change: Climate change adaptation  \nLocation impact: National \n   \nEnvironment  Category  C.  No  significant  adverse  environmental  impact  has  been \nAssessment  identified. \n   \nSocial Safeguards  Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected. \n   \nRationale and  The  global  economic  crisis  led  to  a  contraction  in  the  Cook  Islands \nDescription  economy in 2008, mainly because of a drop in tourism attributable to the \nslowdown in key source economies. One-off events in the second half of \n2009 should prevent a further fall in visitor arrivals during the year, but \nunderlying  conditions  are  weak.  Without  a  response  from  the \nGovernment,  further  economic  contraction,  or  at  best  low  growth,  is \nexpected until the global economy recovers and tourism demand revives. \n \nThe slowdown in growth is affecting government revenue: tax collections \nfell by 8.2% in real terms in FY2009, and the ratio of tax collections to \ngross  domestic  product  declined  from  28.3%  to  25.7%.  The  weak \nrevenue  performance  is  putting  pressure  on  government  expenditure \nprograms. The vulnerable, and particularly women with lower-paid jobs in \nthe tourism industry, are at increasing risk. \n  \nThe  economic  downturn  is  worsening  the  decline  in  economic \nperformance since 2004, a result in part of low infrastructure investment \nand  the  end  of  the  growth  dividend  from  economic  reforms  in  the \nmid-1990s. \n \n ", "ii   \nSubprogram  1  will  provide  budget  support  to  help  the  Government \nstimulate the economy and respond to the economic downturn. Loan \nfinancing will enable higher capital expenditure to reduce the backlog of \npriority  infrastructure  and  other  building  investment.  The  increased \nconstruction  activity  will  lift  aggregate  demand  and  economic  activity. \nGovernment will implement stronger infrastructure investment processes \nand  infrastructure  governance  to  ensure  the  quality  of  the  increased \ncapital  expenditure.  Targeted  actions  will  support  the  vulnerable \nmembers  of  the  community.  Fiscal  safeguards  will  be  reinforced  to \npreserve fiscal sustainability. \n \nSubprogram 2 will support the transition to higher, more-inclusive, and \nsustainable  economic  growth.  Loan  financing  will  help  meet  the \nGovernment\u2019s  overall  financing  needs  for  priority  infrastructure. \nConcerted action to raise the standard of governance in the infrastructure \nsector  will  be  supported.  Efforts  will  center  on  implementing  an \ninfrastructure master plan and an infrastructure governance framework \n(both developed with support from the Asian Development Bank [ADB]). \nInfrastructure will be rebuilt amid constant efforts to preserve prudent \nfiscal  management  and  sustain  the  expansion  in  capital  expenditure, \nwhile paying special attention to the needs of the vulnerable members of \nthe community.  \n   \nImpact and  The  ERSP  will  achieve  higher  and  more  inclusive  economic  growth \nOutcome  (program impact), and will initiate economic recovery with protection of \nthe vulnerable and the country\u2019s fiscal position (outcome).  \n   \nSpecial Features  The design of the ERSP incorporates lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in \nprogram  lending  in  the  Pacific  and  elsewhere.  To  maximize  country \nownership,  the  ERSP  is  anchored  in  the  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment Plan 2007\u20132010 and is designed to assist the Government \nin carrying out its budget strategy for FY2010. The ERSP is fortified by \nsolid diagnostics, communication and awareness-raising initiatives, and a \ncommitment to a longer-term engagement through a flexible and feasible \napproach. \n \nSupport for the vulnerable is a feature of the program, in recognition of \nthe  extra  hardship  imposed  by  the  global  economic  crisis  and  the \npreceding period of high international commodity prices. The real value of \nsocial  welfare  payments  to  the  vulnerable  will  be  preserved,  and \ngovernment programs will be explicitly reoriented toward the vulnerable. \nThe ERSP will also link with other activities in support of the vulnerable. \n \nThe Cook Islands is not a member of the International Monetary Fund or \nthe  World  Bank  Group,  and  therefore  has  limited  access  to  financial \nsupport  to  reduce  the  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis.  A \ncomprehensive support package from ADB is needed.  \n   \nPeriod and  The  program  cluster  period  will  be  from  1  January  2008  to \nTranching  30 December 2011.  A  single-tranche  loan  of  $10.0  million  is  to  be \ndisbursed  under  subprogram  1  when  the  Government  has  met  the ", "  iii\nconditions  for  effectiveness.  Subprogram  2,  a  single-tranche  loan  of \n$6.0 million, will be presented for consideration and approval by ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors depending on the progress achieved in implementing \nsubprogram 1, including compliance with the proposed policy actions, \nand the readiness of the Government to undertake the succeeding policy \nreform measures. Subprogram 2 is expected to be considered by the \nBoard about 24 months after the subprogram 1 loan takes effect. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  program  cluster  amounts  to  $16.0  million,  comprising  two \nsubprograms ($10.0 million and $6.0 million). The loan of $10.0 million \n(subprogram  1)  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based \nlending facility. The loan will have a term of 15 years including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% yearly, and \nother terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. \n   \nProcurement and  Loan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member \nDisbursement  countries. Ineligible items and imports financed from other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources will be excluded. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed to the borrower as provided in ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram Loans (1998). Loan proceeds disbursed against imports will \nrequire a certificate from the Government stipulating that the value of the \ntotal imports of the Cook Islands, minus its imports from nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other  official \ndevelopment assistance, is at least equal to the amount of the loans to be \ndisbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use \nof  the  loan  proceeds  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncertification. \n   \nCounterpart  The Government shall ensure that the local currency generated from the \nFunds  proceeds of the loans are used to support public expenditure objectives \nunder the program. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) will be the \nand  executing  agency  for  the  program.  The  existing  National  Sustainable \nImplementation  Development Commission (comprising heads of MFEM, the Office of the \nArrangements  Prime Minister, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs) will be the program coordinating committee and will meet \nat least quarterly to monitor progress and oversee the implementation of \nthe  program,  and  to  guide  and  direct  the  activities  of  the  executing \nagency. \n   \nBenefits  The  program  will  provide  broadly  distributed  benefits  by  helping  to \ncounter the negative impact of the global economic crisis and setting a \nfoundation  for  higher,  private sector\u2013led  economic  growth  over  the \nmedium  to  long  term.  The  vulnerable  will  benefit  from  the  improved \ntargeting of government programs. \n   \n ", "iv   \nRisks and  The key risks are as follows: (i) technical and legal problems delay capital \nAssumptions  expenditure; (ii) the Government has insufficient capacity to implement \nthe program; (iii) a shortfall in government financing precludes optimized \ninfrastructure  and  implement  policy  actions  linked  to  the  program; \n(iv) there is insufficient community support for the Government\u2019s actions; \nand  (v) the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  the  program  wanes  in  the \nlead-up to the 2010 election. \n \nThe program is designed to mitigate these risks. Community awareness \nand demand for the program will be built as part of the communications \nstrategy.  Explicit  cabinet  commitments  to  fiscal  responsibility  and \nimproved infrastructure governance will drive the allocation of financial \nand human resources to the implementation of the program and ensure \nthat the higher capital expenditure is sustainable. \n \nThe program will also rely on (i) a positive response from the private \nsector  to  a  better  economy;  (ii)  continuing  improvements  in  the \nperformance  of  government  agencies;  and  (iii)  restraint  among \ngovernment  agencies  in  current  expenditure  growth  given  their  weak \nrevenue performance.  ", " \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster, and (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram 1, both to the Cook Islands for the \nEconomic Recovery Support Program (ERSP). The ERSP program cluster was prepared by a \njoint team of representatives of the Government of the Cook Islands (the Government) and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix for subprogram 1, including triggers for subprogram \n2, are in Appendix 2.  \nII.  THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS \nA.  The Cook Islands Economy before the Global Economic Crisis \n2.  The Cook Islands economy grew for 6 consecutive years until 2004 as it recovered from \nthe economic crisis of the mid-1990s, the result of an overly ambitious expansion of the public \nsector.  An  unsustainably  large  public  service,  a  major  public  investment  program,  and \ngovernment guarantees for a hotel development that failed had raised the ratio of public debt to \ngross domestic product (GDP) to 141%. The New Zealand dollar replaced the Cook Islands \ndollar as the national currency and more than half of the public service was retrenched. A \nbroad range of economic and public sector reforms proved to be a catalyst for growth, providing \nthe foundation for a robust expansion in private sector activity.1 \n \n3.  The economy is tourism led (Figure 1), with annual visitors of around 100,000 persons, \nalmost  six  times  the  resident  population  (Appendix  3  gives  an  overview  of  key  economic \nissues). The reform program saw economic growth average 6.0% yearly in the 6 years up to \n2004, substantially above the long-run average yearly growth rate of 3.5%. Damage caused by \ncyclone  Hera  in  2005  and  the  consequent  disruption  of  tourism  brought  the  post-reform \nexpansion to an end. Almost no growth was recorded in 2005, and only slight growth in real \nGDP in 2006 and 2007.  \n \n4.  The weakening in growth since 2004 is linked to slow progress in deepening economic \nreform. Productivity growth and the buildup of physical and human capital have fallen short of \nwhat is needed to sustain the growth momentum. Notably, public investment has been low, and \ntighter restrictions on foreign investment have held back the private sector from accumulating \nproductive capital. Local labor is close to fully employed; foreign labor is needed to meet the \ndemand and avoid a rising cost structure. However, concerns regarding the potential dilution of \nthe country\u2019s identity, with both social and marketing implications, appear to be contributing to \ninertia in providing flexible, efficient access to foreign labor.  \n \n5.  A deterioration in the underlying economic fundamentals is evident in the pattern of \ngrowth. The reforms had led to a rapid increase in private investment. Foreign direct investment \nplayed a large role at the start, before bank lending gained prominence. Commercial building \ninvestment, particularly in tourism accommodation and other tourism-based activities, expanded \n                                                 \n1  ADB supported the Cook Islands economic reform.

Then economic activity shifted from the productive sector to residential building \n(evident  in  an  upsurge  in  residential  building  approvals  and  personal  lending)  as  both \nestablished and new residents, notably retirees drawing on their offshore savings, increased \ntheir spending. \n \nFigure 1: A Tourism-Led Economy \n40 Real GDP (rhs) 20\n)\n% Visitor arrivals (lhs)\ne,  30 15\ng %\nan 20 10 e, \nh g\nc n\nual  10 5 ha\nnn al c\na u\ns ( 0 0 nn\nn A\no\ns -10 -5\nr\ne\nP\n-20 -10\n1983 1986 1989 1992 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007e 2010f\n \ne = estimate, f = forecast, GDP = gross domestic product, lhs = left hand side, rhs = right hand side. \nSources: Cook Islands Statistics Office; ADB estimates. \nB.  Impact of the Crisis on the Cook Islands \n6.  The global economic crisis has heightened the economic deterioration. The economy, \ngiven its dependence on tourism, is highly exposed to the external slowdown. It contracted in \n2008 as visitor arrivals declined by 3.1%. A large decline from high-spending segments of the \nmarket\u2014the key northern hemisphere markets of the United States, Canada, and Europe\u2014\noutweighed a rise in tourism from New Zealand. High fuel prices and the resulting high inflation, \nplus the loss of one of two international freight-shipping services, also further sapped the \neconomy in 2008. A weakening in a range of economic indicators points to a generalized \neconomic  slowdown.  Preliminary  official  estimates  put  the  contraction  at  1.1%,  but  the \nGovernment has already indicated that it could be as large as 3.0%. \n \n7.  The  latest  data  point  to  a  continuation  of  weak  economic  conditions  into  2009. \nCommercial bank lending to business was down by 8.3% in June 2009 from a year earlier, and \ncar  and  truck  registrations  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  were  both  more  than  40%  below \nregistrations in the same period in 2008. Tax revenue collections were down by 3.5% in FY2009 \nin nominal terms and an estimated 8.2% in real terms. \n \n8.  The  weak  revenue  performance  and  the  inflationary  environment  are  placing \nconsiderable pressure on government expenditure programs, and could, in turn, add to pressure \non vulnerable members of the community from a softening in labor demand and an escalation in \nthe cost of living. Women are particularly vulnerable, as they are overrepresented in lower-paid \njobs in tourism. \n \n9.  The overall weakening is taking place despite a small, recent pickup in visitor arrivals. \nTotal visitor arrivals were down in the 12 months up to May 2009, but up by 1.3% in the ", "  3\n12 months up to June 2009. Arrivals from Australia and New Zealand have recovered, more \nthan offsetting a continuing decline in arrivals from the Northern Hemisphere. The rise in arrivals \nfrom Australia and New Zealand appears to be a result of intensive marketing and a substitution \naway from the Fiji Islands.  \n \n10.  Total visitor arrivals and the economy will receive a temporary boost in the second half \nof 2009 from a different kind of tourism, via the World Youth Netball Championships, the South \nPacific Mini Games, and a number of major regional conferences (e.g., the Forum Economic \nMinisters\u2019 Meeting). Short-lived once-offs with low yields in most cases, these events will not \nreverse the underlying weakness in the economy.  \n \n11.  Inflation averaged 7.8% in 2008 and remained high at 11.2% on a year-on-year basis as \nof June 2009. The resultant erosion of purchasing power is a source of economic stress.  \n \n12.  While a small expansion in the overall economy is possible in 2009, a contraction is \nlooming in 2010 in the absence of corrective action by the Government. Business investment is \nstill weak, no major special events are expected, and tourism activity is projected to soften as \nthe Fiji Islands recovers its tourists.  \nC.  The Government\u2019s Response \n1.  Fiscal Measures \n13.  The  Government  acted  early  to  counter  the  economic  slowdown  (Supplementary \nAppendix A). The FY2010 budget was framed to carry out the following fiscal strategies: \n \n(i)  implement new initiatives that will stimulate the economy (such as increased \ncapital expenditure); \n(ii)  maintain  or  increase  expenditure  on  the  delivery  of  public  services  to  the \nvulnerable; \n(iii)  limit new expenditure initiatives that involve significant recurrent costs or do not \ncontribute to productivity improvements; \n(iv)  ensure that the number of people employed in the public service is justified by \nthe delivery of the needed outputs and the desired outcomes; \n(v)  develop and implement policies that will minimize costs to the Government and \nyield  savings  for  use  in  priority  areas,  e.g., suspend  the  payment  of  3-year \nlong-service  bonuses,  performance  bonuses,  and,  where  warranted,  other \nincrements in the public service during this fiscal period; and \n(vi)  align government expenditure and revenue with the medium-term goals of Te \nKaveinga Nui, the National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) 2007\u20132010.2 \n \n14.  The  main  initiative  adopted  was  a  large  increase  in  capital  expenditure  (Table  1), \nbringing forward planned capital expenditure to hasten infrastructure development and give a \nshort-term boost to the economy. The proposed public investment program can help turn the \neconomy  around,  first  by  countering  the  downturn,  and  then  by  helping  to  deal  with  the \nunderlying  economic  weaknesses  caused  by  past  underinvestment  in  infrastructure.  The \nGovernment has planned road and water supply works on Rarotonga and public buildings, while \npublic enterprises have projects planned for the main airport and seaport. These major new \n                                                 \n2  Government of the Cook Islands. 2009. The Cook Islands Budget Policy Statement 2009/2010. Rarotonga (March). \n ", "4   \nprojects follow the construction of sports facilities for the Pacific Mini Games in FY2009 and are \nin addition to a commitment to build a new headquarters for the Ministry of Education.  \n \n15.  The FY2010 budget provides for overall restraint in the growth of operating expenditure, \nsuch that there will be a slight decline in the ratio of operating expenditure to GDP below recent \nlevels and a small reduction in the real value of wages and salaries and expenditure on goods \nand services. Fiscal space will thus be created for higher capital expenditure. However, to \nachieve this overall restraint, the same proportional controls are applied to both high priority and \nlower priority activities of ministries. A prioritized approach would have helped minimize the \npotential adverse effects of the expenditure restraint.  \n \nTable 1: Fiscal Aggregates \n Item  Unit  FY2005  FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009 FY2010\n(est)  (est)  (est)  (est)  (bud) \nGovernment revenue               \nRevenue   % of GDP  37.2   39.0   39.8   43.9   37.6   38.7  \n- tax revenue   % of GDP  25.7   27.1   27.5   28.3   25.7   24.9  \n- real tax revenue  annual  3.3   7.0   (0.1)  0.9   (8.2)  (1.4) \nchange, %  \nGovernment expenditure               \nTotal expenditure   % of GDP  34.6   36.4   39.7   44.8   48.7   54.8  \nCapital expenditure   % of GDP  4.1   4.6   6.4   6.6   12.2   20.4  \nCurrent expenditure   % of GDP  32.0   33.5   35.0   39.9   38.3   35.9  \n- personnel costs   % of GDP  13.1   13.8   14.5   14.8   13.6   13.2  \n- personnel costs  % of current  41.0   41.2   41.4   37.0   35.5   36.8  \nexpenditure \nBudget balance               \nOverall balance   % of GDP  2.6   2.6   0.1   (0.8)  (11.0)  (16.1) \nBudget financing requirement  $ million  (4.7)  (4.7)  (0.1)  1.8   21.0   35.2  \nGeneral government net debt             \nGross debt   % of GDP  37.9  21.2  21.1  16.8  19.9  34.8 \nCash and liquid assets   % of GDP  18.9  15.3  13.9  14.6  9.1  9.5 \nNet debt   % of GDP  19.0  5.9  7.2  2.2  10.8  25.2 \n( ) = negative, bud = budget, est = estimate, GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: Fiscal aggregates prepared on a government financial statistics basis.

The revenue projections are conservative and realistic. Low growth in internal revenue is \nprojected for FY2010, with most of the increase resulting from a higher rate of departure tax. \nWithout that increase, revenue collections would be flat (in nominal terms). \n \n17.  The planned budget deficit is affordable, given current low debt levels, but it is large by \nthe Cook Islands\u2019 own standards and those of other countries. Public debt will nonetheless \nremain below reasonable thresholds (Appendix 4). For fiscal sustainability, planned capital \nexpenditure  must  be  directed  to  sound  capital  projects,  particularly  those  that  directly  or \nindirectly bring in the funds to service the new debt. The growth in operating expenditure must \nbe restrained to allow future budgets to meet rising maintenance and debt service costs.  ", "  5\n \n18.  The Government has acknowledged the uncertain outlook for revenue in the global \neconomic downturn, and recognizes that it must contain operating expenditure if it is to continue \nto fund priority capital expenditure. Exercising restraint on staffing costs will be particularly \nimportant, as these costs already account for a high share of operating expenditure and the \nwage bill is high by regional standards (as a ratio to GDP).  \n \n19.  The subsidies to private businesses also warrant attention. The total cost of subsidies to \nAir  New  Zealand  alone  is  of  the  order  of  4%  of  operating  expenditure,  and  interest  rate \nsubsidies took up a further 2.7% of operating expenditure in the FY2009 budget. Allocating \nsubsidies via competitive tender would (where practical) help minimize their cost while ensuring \nthe use of funds to best effect. \n \n20.  The domestic banking sector is already partially dependent on funds secured offshore to \nmeet domestic needs. The sizable fiscal expansion now planned must also be financed from \noffshore sources. As the Cook Islands currency is the New Zealand dollar, such borrowing can \nhave no adverse effects on the balance of payments or exchange rate.  \n \n21.  The  FY2010  budget  deficit  is  to  be  financed  from  ongoing  loans  from  ADB,  and \nadditional loans from the People\u2019s Republic of China are being negotiated (Table 2). New ADB \nfinancing will take the form of the first disbursement from the proposed ERSP, which provides \nfor a cluster of loans comprising two subprograms totaling $16.0 million. The first subprogram of \n$10.0 million is planned for disbursement in October 2009, and the second subprogram of \n$6.0 million in October 2011 (indicative timing). \n \n \nTable 2: Major Recent and Proposed Loans \nTiming of Investment    Loan Amount \nCompletion    NZ$  US$  (% of \nUse  Lender  Start  (preliminary)    milliona  milliona  GDP) \nGeneral government sector               \nConstruction of sports facilities and  PRC  FY2009  FY2011    15.7  10.5  4.8 \nnew headquarters for the Ministry \nof Education \nEconomic Recovery Support Program  ADB  FY2010  FY2012    23.8  16.0  7.3 \nRehabilitation and upgrade of  PRC  FY2010  FY2014    37.5  25.2  11.5 \nRarotonga main roads and water \nsupply ring main \nSubtotal          77.0  51.7  23.6 \nPublic  enterprises               \nUpgrade of Rarotonga Airport  Local bank  FY2009  FY2010    6.5  4.4  2.0 \nTerminal \nUpgrade of Avatiu Harbor  ADB  FY2010  FY2012    20.4  13.7  6.3 \nSubtotal          26.9  18.1  8.2 \nTotal          103.9  69.8  31.9 \na Based on an exchange rate of NZ$1 = $0.6712 as of 10 August 2009. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: ADB estimates based on data supplied by MFEM. \n \n ", "6   \n22.

Complementary Structural Initiatives \n24.  The Cook Islands achieved the fiscal consolidation that led to its near-debt-free status in \npart by deferring infrastructure investment. The current infrastructure lacks the capacity and \nquality to meet existing demand, and inadequate services in water and sanitation services pose \ndirect risks to the natural environment and public health. The inadequacy of infrastructure is an \nincreasingly tighter constraint on new development, especially on Rarotonga and Aitutaki, where \ntourism is concentrated. There is a growing risk that pollution in the lagoons of these islands, \nwith associated impact on health, would impair the country\u2019s reputation as a clean and safe \ntourism destination. Increased investment is also needed to help climate-proof the Cook Islands, \nnotably the outer islands. \n \n25.  The  need  to  increase  public  investment  to  sustain  economic  growth  and  service \nstandards, while achieving a pattern of commercial activity that is ecologically sustainable, will \ntest the fiscal position of the country as well as the maintenance of governance standards. \nStrengthened infrastructure is (i) at the core of an extensive policy dialogue between ADB and \nthe Government, (ii) the priority area of technical assistance (TA), and the strategic focus of the \ncurrent country partnership strategy.  \n \n26.  An infrastructure master plan (IMP), developed with ADB support in 2006\u20132007, was \nlaunched in 2007 (see box).4 At an estimated total capital cost of $175 million over 20 years \n                                                 \n3  Cook Islands\u2019 financial management legislation allows appropriations for a given year to be spent in future years \nwithout reappropriation. Hence, the large fiscal expansion in the FY2009 and FY2010 budgets provide for both a \nshort-term fiscal stimulus and a medium-term expansion in public investment. ", "  7\n(around 90% of annual GDP), the IMP presents a major challenge to the fiscal and institutional \ncapacity of the public sector and the local construction industry. But such an ambitious plan is \naffordable if investments are carefully selected to contribute to sustainable economic growth \nand development partners provide concessional funding.  \n \n27.  The  IMP  acknowledges  that  the  infrastructure  sector  suffers  from  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity constraints affecting operations, cost recovery, and hence the supply and \nquality of basic infrastructure services. Institutional arrangements are fragmented, overlapping, \nand uncoordinated. These weaknesses have resulted in ineffective management and a lack of \nclear ownership of policies, planning, and regulatory responsibility (Appendixes 5 and 6). \n \n \nThe Infrastructure Master Plan Priority Investments \nThe physical infrastructure in the Cook Islands is in need of substantial investment. Shortcomings in \ninfrastructure increase business costs and constrain development by falling short of users\u2019 needs.  \nThe road network in the tourism-intensive Rarotonga and Aitutaki is a priority. Upgrades are needed to \nmeet the demand from rising vehicle ownership and tourism, to lessen congestion and the incidence of \nserious crashes (including fatalities), and to climate-proof the roads from possible coastal erosion as a \nconsequence of the rise in sea levels induced by climate change. Health problems from pollution in \nRarotonga\u2019s lagoon provide early warning of the potential cost of not addressing the environmental \nstresses created by expansion in tourism. Such episodes may become more frequent if solid and liquid \nwaste management infrastructure is not upgraded. Tourism development in some parts of Rarotonga and \nin Aitutaki has been curtailed by insufficient water supplies, and both islands are susceptible to water \nshortages during dry periods because there is little storage capacity. \nIn the transport sector, the main international wharf on Rarotonga has reached the end of its useful life \nand is in urgent need of major investment. The wharf must be realigned to allow the berthing of larger \nvessels (including cruise ships). Harbor facilities in most outer islands are inadequate or nonexistent. The \nterminal building at the international airport is being upgraded to comply with international civil aviation \nregulations, and aging navigation equipment requires replacement. While telecommunications coverage \nis good, the quality of the service is poor and prices are relatively high. Energy costs are among the \nhighest in the Pacific; energy efficiency must improve to reduce costs. \nThe infrastructure master plan (IMP) was conceived as a response to the five damaging cyclones in 2005. \nAt first, therefore, it emphasized the need for resilience by minimizing the harmful effects of disasters, and \nwas weighted toward the outer islands, while excluding government buildings and investments prioritized \nby the state-owned enterprises. That first IMP identified a prioritized and sequenced set of investments \nfor the next 20 years at an estimated total cost of $175 million.  \nThe IMP was adopted through the NSDP 2007\u20132010, Te Kaveinga Nui, and is at the core of the fifth of \nthe NSDP\u2019s eight strategic goals: \u201cA strong basic infrastructure base to support national development.\u201d \nThe Cook Islands vision \u201cTo enjoy the highest quality of life consistent with the aspirations of our people, \nand in harmony with our culture and environment\u201d can be met only with environmentally sensitive \nimprovements in infrastructure. \nThe coverage of the IMP has since been extended to all sectors and national needs. The IMP is now \nviewed  as  a  living  plan  that  will  evolve  to  meet  emerging  needs  and  be  responsive  to  changing \ncommunity and economic priorities. Capital expenditure projects currently prioritized include wharves and \nharbors ($33.2 million), government buildings ($20.8 million), airports ($9.5 million), roads ($8.5 million), \nsewerage and waste management ($5.6 million), and cyclone management centers ($5.4 million). \nSources: Ministry of Finance and Economic Management; Ministry of Infrastructure and Planning; MPC Group \nInternational. 2007.

Effective  infrastructure  development  and  results-focused  service  delivery  and  asset \nmanagement required a comprehensive review and modernization of institutional arrangements, \ncapacities, and policies, including greater use of cost recovery. The review indicated that, for \nhigh-quality  capital  spending,  government  agencies  must  follow  a  transparent  and  robust \nprocess of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, funding, and implementing investment projects, \nand the projects must have clear social and economic benefits and achieve a satisfactory rate of \nreturn. \n \n29.  An  infrastructure  governance  framework  (IGF)  was  therefore  developed  with  ADB \nsupport.5 The IGF is a set of government-initiated policy principles and actions designed to \nachieve  sound  governance,  investment  decisions,  and  operational  management  in  the \ninfrastructure sector (Appendix 7). The components of the IGF are \n \n(i)  institutional  arrangements  to  support  good  governance,  sound  investment \ndecisions,  and  the  efficient  and  responsive  operation  of  publicly  provided \ninfrastructure; \n \n(ii)  capacity development within the sector institutions to enable them to perform \ntheir designated functions efficiently; \n \n(iii)  clear and consistent regulatory policies for the sector and subsectors that carry \nout the NSDP, including service standards, user charges and cost recovery, \nfinancial return on public assets, and environmental and social responsibilities \nsuch as community service obligations; \n \n(iv)  an agreed process of infrastructure investment planning and implementation that \napplies consistent analysis, ranking, prioritization, approval, and procurement \nmethods; and6 \n \n(v)  arrangements for sustainable asset management, including asset inventory and \nvaluation,  assessment  of  condition,  and  provisions  for  routine,  periodic,  and \nemergency maintenance, repair, and renewal. \n \n30.  The IGF prioritizes improvements in the governance arrangements for infrastructure as a \nsound base for moving forward with environmentally sustainable infrastructure investment. The \nGovernment now looks forward to implementing this broad governance framework quickly for \nvetting infrastructure proposals and optimizing asset management, cost recovery possibilities, \nasset performance, and private sector participation. Elements of the IGF were endorsed by key \ngovernment  agencies  in  2007.  In  2008,  the  cabinet  took  key  decisions  that  established \nhigh-level  committees  to  oversee  its  development  and  implementation:  (i)  the  National \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Cook Islands for Preparing the Infrastructure Development Project. Manila \n(TA 7022-COO). \n6 The IMP initially prioritized projects on the basis of six criteria: (i) Will the project contribute to national economic \ndevelopment and growth? (ii) Will the project contribute to national revenue? (iii) Will the project lead to improved \nliving standards? (iv) Will the project contribute to a better environment? (v) Will the project provide an enabling \nenvironment for private sector involvement? and (vi) Will the project promote community support and involvement? \nThe prioritization process has since become less structured. An objective and transparent process of prioritization \nis now needed that draws on prioritization criteria aligned with current expectations and backed by checks on \neconomic and financial viability. ", "  9\nSustainable Development Commission (NSDC) reporting directly to the cabinet, and (ii) the \nInfrastructure Committee attached to the Cook Islands Investment Corporation (CIIC).7 \n \n31.  The Cook Islands also needs to catch up with improvements made elsewhere in the \nregion (e.g., in telecommunications and in the enabling environment for investors) to become \nmore competitive internationally. A range of structural initiatives has been identified for this \npurpose. Renewed effort in these areas will support the economic recovery. \n3.  Protection for the Vulnerable \n32.  Beyond a general pattern of disadvantage to the outer islands, the vulnerable in the \nCook Islands are those who are least able to help themselves, whose issues go unheard, and \nwho often have special needs and require extra help (Appendix 8). The reasons given for the \nvulnerability include a breakdown in traditional family support systems, the emigration of family \nincome earners, the rising cost of living, and social and community obligations. The vulnerable \nare identified as the elderly, the unemployed, single parents, children, the disabled, squatters, \nand victims of crime.  The last two categories are by far the smallest. \n \n33.  There is no formal system in the Cook Islands for targeting the vulnerable other than \nfairly loosely, through the distribution of sizable social security payments (the equivalent of \naround 3.5% of GDP). There is almost no systematic method of identifying the disadvantaged, \ntheir needs, and the best means of addressing these needs. Because of the widely held\u2015but \nnot necessarily correct\u2015perception that good health, education, and living standards are well \ndistributed in the Cook Islands and there is therefore little poverty, poverty reduction does not \nfigure prominently in government plans and policies. While there has long been an emphasis on \nequity in public policy, especially in access to basic services such as health and education, and \nin outer-island development, more could be done to increase the focus on the disadvantaged.  \n \n34.  There  is  little  hard  evidence  of  the  impact  of  the  high  inflation  triggered  by  high \ninternational  commodity  prices  and  the  concurrent  economic  downturn.  However,  it  is \nreasonable to expect the needs of the vulnerable to be on the rise. Women with lower-paid jobs \nin the tourism industry are potentially the most affected. This raises the imperative to rebalance \ngovernment programs in favor of targeted support for the vulnerable. Such measures are, \nhowever, not explicit in the FY2010 budget (in contrast to the stated intention of the budget \nstrategy). \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n35.  The  program  is  expected  to  achieve  higher  and  more-inclusive  economic  growth \n(program impact). The focus will be on strengthening priority elements of the governance and \ninstitutional framework, and improving opportunities for the vulnerable. ADB financing will be \nused to help meet the Government\u2019s overall budget financing needs, which have increased as a \nresult  of  its  greater  need  for  infrastructure  and  building  investment.  The  program  is  thus \n                                                 \n7 The NSDC comprises the heads of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM), the Office of the \nPrime Minister, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \n ", "10  \nexpected to initiate economic recovery with protection of the vulnerable and the country\u2019s fiscal \nposition (program outcome).  \n \n36.  The process of stimulating inclusive economic growth in the Cook Islands is presented in \nFigure 3. It suggests that economic growth can be stimulated through a program that addresses \nthe governance and institutional environment, along with financing to allow faster accumulation \nof more-productive human and physical capital. These actions must be in harmony with the \nconservation of the natural environment and adaptation to climate change, in part because the \ndomestic tourism industry rests on the natural environment, and require better management to \nincrease the carrying capacity of the natural environment. Removing the bottlenecks that inhibit \nprivate sector development will promote business investment, the key to sustaining economic \ngrowth. These actions, which will address binding constraints on the domestic economy, form \nthe substance of the ERSP. The focus will be on strengthening the governance and institutional \nframework,  while  providing  needed  external  financing  and  support  for  targeted  policy  and \ngovernment expenditure in favor of the vulnerable. \n \n37.  The  actions  will  provide  the  Cook  Islands  with  a  growth  dividend  as  the  currently \ndepressed external demand turns around. The economy would thus recover faster than would \notherwise be the case, and begin to return to at least the long-run growth rate. Extra effort will \nbe needed through this transition to provide opportunities for the vulnerable to benefit from a \nhigher share in economic growth.  \n \nFigure 3: The Economic Recovery Process \nFavorable external \nconditions (e.g. \nrising tourism \ndemand)\nHHuummaann  \nccaappiittaall\nHHuummaann   Stronger \nccaappiittaall governance IInncclluussiivvee  \nPPuubblliicc   BBuussiinneessss   aanndd  \nPPuubblliicc   BBuussiinneessss   + and  = iinnffrraassttrruuccttuurree iinnvveessttmmeenntt ssuussttaaiinnaabbllee  \niinnffrraassttrruucc--\nttuurree iinnvveessttmmeenntt institutional  eeccoonnoommiicc  \nNNaattuurraall   ggrroowwtthh\nframework \neennvviirroonn-- NNaattuurraall  \nmmeenntt and financing eennvviirroonnmmeenntt\nEnhanced \nopportunity for \nthe most \nvulnerable\nCurrent situation\nTarget situation\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n38.

This report ", "  11\ndeals mainly with subprogram 1, but some indicative components of subprogram 2 are also \ncovered. \n \n39.  Subprogram 1 is a single-tranche operation with a well-defined framework aligned with \nthe Government\u2019s NSDP. The policy reform agenda is supported by ongoing advisory TA to \nimplement and deepen reforms over the ERSP period.8 Consideration of subprogram 2 will \ndepend on satisfactory progress toward its policy triggers. Subprogram 2 is expected to be \nsubmitted to the ADB Board of Directors for consideration in 2011 after the key triggers are \ncompleted.  \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions  \n40.  The ERSP will provide an immediate response to the global economic crisis and support \nfor continued economy recovery. Subprogram 1 will enable the Government to ease its fiscal \nstance in the immediate to short term to avoid further economic contraction. Targeted actions \nsupport  the  vulnerable.  A  strengthened  governance  and  institutional  framework  and  loan \nfinancing  will  improve  the  quality  of  capital  expenditure,  and  allow  the  backlog  of  priority \ninfrastructure and other building investment to be reduced. Increased construction activity will lift \naggregate  demand  and  economic  activity.  The  Government  is  committed  to  strengthening \ninfrastructure investment processes and infrastructure governance to promote sustained growth \nin the medium term.  \n \n41.  Subprogram 1 will have five outputs: (i) higher capital expenditure by the Government to \nboost  economic  activity,  (ii)  structural  and  governance  improvements,  (iii)  support  for  the \nvulnerable, (iv) fiscal responsibility, and (v) program communication and ownership. All policy \nmeasures under subprogram 1 have been completed. The five outputs will be implemented \nconcurrently. Subprogram 2 will be structured across the same outputs as subprogram 1 and, \nagain, all areas will be implemented concurrently. \n \n42.  The development of the program placed priority on promoting country ownership and \nkeeping  the  program  manageable,  given  the  capacity  limitations,  to  ensure  sustainable \noutcomes.  \n \n43.  Output  1:  Short-term  economic  boost  from  higher  capital  expenditure  by  the \nGovernment. The FY2010 budget provides for a large increase in capital expenditure above \nthe FY2009 budget outcome estimate\u2014NZ$57.6 million as opposed to NZ$31.0 million. This is \na key component of the Government\u2019s response to the economic downturn arising from the \nglobal economic crisis. Subprogram 1 will provide budget support to enable the Government to \nmeet this expenditure plan, bringing forward planned capital expenditure into the current budget \nyear to stimulate the economy. The increased construction activity will lift aggregate demand \nand economic activity.  \n \n44.  The FY2010 budget does not specify the new investments that will be made, although \nprojects are being readied for the main airport, roads, and water supply on Rarotonga and key \npublic buildings. In view of the urgency of some projects, a range of funding options is being \nconsidered, and the Government is in discussions with the People\u2019s Republic of China for the \nfunding of the Rarotonga main road and water main upgrade, and with commercial lenders for \n                                                 \n8  Notably, ADB. 2009.

ADB budget support will provide the Government with \nan  alternative  funding  option  for  speeding  up  the  start  of  either  of  these  projects,  or  for \nlaunching another priority investment. Rather than earmarking funds for particular infrastructure \ninvestments, the cabinet will decide whether or not to fund particular projects from the budget, \naccording to the recommendations of the NSDC, which will follow an agreed set of criteria for \nprioritizing investments. \n \n45.  The use of an improved process of prioritizing infrastructure investments, committed to \nby the cabinet under output 2, will ensure the quality of this increased capital expenditure \n(paras. 46\u201349). Better-quality infrastructure investments will yield longer-term benefits beyond \nthe short-term economic stimulus, by dealing, at least in part, with the backlog of priority \ninfrastructure and other building investment, thereby providing a sound base for greater private \nsector growth.  \n \n46.  Output 2: Structural and governance improvements. The ERSP will support the \nimplementation of structural reforms and governance improvements across the infrastructure \nsectors. These improvements are vital to medium-term growth prospects, as weak infrastructure \nand poor management of infrastructure assets have held back private sector development and \nplaced  at  risk  the  natural  environment  on  which  the  domestic  tourism  industry  rests.  The \nimprovements have been the subject of ongoing dialogue with the Government of the Cook \nIslands over a number of years, and include significant actions and commitments on the part of \nthe Government that demonstrate its recognition of the importance of sound infrastructure \ndevelopment to economic growth.  \n \n47.  Subprogram 1 will provide for cabinet endorsement of the IMP and its incorporation into \nthe NSDP. These actions will elevate the development role accorded to infrastructure. The \nsubprogram will  elicit  explicit  cabinet  commitment  to  a  transparent  and  objective  two-step \nprocess of prioritizing capital expenditure by the NSDC. The first step will require projects to be \nprioritized from the IMP on the basis of a multi-criteria analysis, taking into account economic, \nfinancial, social, and environmental factors. In the second step, the highest-priority projects will \nbe subjected to a socioeconomic cost\u2013benefit analysis to verify their viability and ensure a \npositive  net  present  value  before  funding  is  confirmed.  This  will  ensure  the  quality  of  the \nincreased capital expenditure under output 1 of the subprogram. \n \n48.  The management of the strengthened infrastructure investment pipeline is supported by \nthe cabinet endorsement of the IGF. The IGF will be implemented across all infrastructure \nsectors  (roads,  airports,  ports  and  harbors,  government  buildings,  energy,  water  supply, \nsanitation and waste management). The IGF, when implemented, will provide for sector policy \nstatements (inclusive of provisions for user charges, cost recovery, and community service \nobligations);  investment  criteria  and  plans;  asset  management;  and  forward  budgeting \nframeworks. It will also promote common approval and implementation procedures across all \ncapital expenditure in the public infrastructure sector. In addition, legislative changes will be \nsupported to provide for institutional improvements and reforms, agency responsibilities and \npowers for public infrastructure provision, ongoing asset maintenance management, internal \nand external audit, user charges and cost recovery, and multiyear budgeting. \n \n49.  Organizational and management elements of the IGF will also be implemented as part of \nsubprogram 1. The Ministry of Works has been merged with the Office of the Minister of Island \nAdministration to form the Ministry of Infrastructure and Planning.9 The new ministry focuses on \n                                                 \n9   This was formally adopted by the Government in October 2008.

Two key committees were created in May 2008; these are the \nNSDC, reporting directly to the cabinet, and the Infrastructure Committee10 attached to the CIIC. \nThe NSDC reviews all development projects and aligns them with NSDP priorities. Prioritized \ninfrastructure projects are then passed on to the Infrastructure Committee, which approves \nallocations  for  government- and  aid-funded  investment.  The  Infrastructure  Committee  and \nNSDC take on performance monitoring roles, thus effectively providing external oversight to the \nimplementation of development projects by line ministries. The creation of the NSDC and the \nInfrastructure  Committee  puts  in  place  a  process  that  keeps  approved  infrastructure \ninvestments in line with the broad infrastructure development needs of the Cook Islands. \n \n50.  Output  3:  Support  for  the  vulnerable  through  targeted  actions.  The  vulnerable \nwithin the community are more exposed to the negative impact of the global financial crisis and \nhave fewer reserves with which to meet their needs. \n \n51.  A review is to be undertaken of the Cook Islands' social welfare system, with an issue \npaper for public consideration to be completed by end December 2009 and the final review to \nbe completed by end of FY2010. This is to allow for inclusion of responsive actions in the \nFY2011 budget, where inflation adjustment of allowances for the vulnerable are expected to \nfigure  prominently.  This  is  potentially  an  important  step  in  the  current  high  inflationary \nenvironment, given that social welfare payments are often the main source of cash income for \nthe vulnerable. \n \n52.  Provision is also made for the pilot-testing of the performance monitoring of services \nused by the vulnerable. The pilot-testing will be conducted on the geriatrics key result area of \nthe  Ministry  of  Health.  This  key  result  area  supports  the  geriatric  ward  at  the  Rarotonga \nHospital, which serves as a de facto old people\u2019s home for infirm elderly people who have no \nfamily to care for them. There is no other residential facility for the elderly in the Cook Islands. \n \n53.  In the medium term, subprogram 2 will broaden the use of performance monitoring of \nservices for the vulnerable, besides assisting in the review of the adequacy of benefits and the \nidentification of savings to be redirected to the vulnerable.11 \n \n54.  Output 4: Maintenance of fiscal responsibility. Cook Islands demonstrated a strong \nsense of fiscal responsibility following the mid-1990s reform, guided by the Ministry of Finance \nand Economic Management (MFEM) Act of 1995\u20131996 and the Manila Agreement12 financial \nratios, which set targets for debt as a proportion of GDP, government personnel costs as a \nproportion of GDP, and other (non-personnel) operating costs as a proportion of GDP. The \nMFEM  Act  (Section  23[2][a])  sets  out  principles  of  fiscal  responsibility  (and  a  process  for \nreporting on compliance with these): \n \n                                                 \n10  The Infrastructure Committee appointed by the cabinet (decision CM [08] 311) comprises two private sector civil \nengineers (one of whom is appointed chair), one private sector architect, and representatives of the Ministry of \nInfrastructure  and  Planning,  MFEM,  the  Aid  Management  Department,  and  the  Cook  Islands  Investment \nCorporation, as well as a member of Parliament.  \n11  The Cook Islands has adopted a performance-based budget, with ministry outputs identified in the budget papers \nand tied to the performance-based contracts of the heads of ministries. However, the system is yet to be operated \nas designed. A key missing link is the regular conduct of performance assessments by the Public Service \nCommission (MFEM\u2019s responsibilities for the budget covers only financial matters). \n12  The Manila Agreement of 1998, supported by ADB as \u201chonest broker,\u201d facilitated debt rescheduling and a \nsignificant write-down of Cook Islands debt to official creditors. \n ", "14  \n(i)  managing total Crown debt at prudent levels to provide a buffer against factors \nthat may adversely affect the level of total Crown debt in the future, by ensuring \nthat, unless such levels have been achieved, the total operating expenses of the \nCrown in each financial year are less than its total operating revenues in the \nsame financial year;  \n(ii)  achieving and maintaining levels of Crown net worth that provide a buffer against \nfactors that may adversely affect the Crown\u2019s net worth in the future;  \n(iii)  managing prudently the fiscal risks facing the Crown; and \n(iv)  pursuing policies that are consistent with a reasonable degree of predictability \nabout the level and stability of tax rates in future years. \n \n55.  The Government is committed to continuing to meet throughout the program period the \nprinciples of fiscal responsibility stated in the MFEM Act.  \n \n56.  Although the term of the Manila Agreement has now ended, the Government sees \nbenefit in continuing to use the concept of operating parameters. The ERSP provides for a \ncabinet commitment  to  update  and  refine  these  as  a  practical  management  tool  for  fiscal \nresponsibility. The use of these ratios will complement the principles of fiscal responsibility in the \nMFEM Act. ADB will assist the Cook Islands in refining and updating these ratios through the \nPacific Economic Management TA (footnote 8).  \n \n57.  The Government has taken a number of steps to improve the budget process and \npresentation, including ongoing efforts to adopt medium-term budgeting (for full implementation \nin FY2011) and to present the budget in an internationally comparable format. The Government \ncommits to provide a statement of government operation in the FY2010 budget in accordance \nwith the International Monetary Fund\u2019s government finance statistics standards. \n \n58.  Under  the  program,  the  Government  is  committed  to  maintaining  the  financial \ncontribution needed to remain under Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services through FY2010. This \nopens the Cook Islands to external scrutiny and comparison, but also provides the Government \nwith an important benchmark by which to measure its progress and performance in economic \nmanagement.  \n \n59.  Output 5: Communication and ownership of economic and fiscal management \ninitiatives. Lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in the implementation of program loans call for \nattention to the development of local awareness, understanding, and ownership of programs to \npromote  their  success.  The  program  commits  the  Government  to  the  development  of  a \ncommunications strategy that will explain \n \n(i)  the Government\u2019s response to the global economic crisis, including actions to \naddress the needs of the vulnerable;  \n(ii)  the transparent and objective process of prioritizing and implementing the IMP; \nand \n(iii)  the role of infrastructure development and governance in supporting growth. \n \n60.  The Government already places considerable public finance information in the public \ndomain by publishing this on the MFEM website in a timely and comprehensive manner. There \nis also a track record of public consultation and participation in key development issues\u2014such \nas in the development of the NSDC. The communication and engagement strategy committed \nto, and subsequently implemented as part of this program, will build on this strong base. ", "  15\nC.  Triggers for Subprogram 2 \n61.  The development policy letter (Appendix 2) sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda for \nthe  next  2  years,  building  on  the  reform  momentum  from  subprogram  1.  Triggers  for \nsubprogram 2 are described in the policy matrix attached to the development policy letter. The \nindicative milestones for subprogram 2 that can be monitored are listed in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n62.  Building on reforms under subprogram 1, subprogram 2 is expected to be implemented \nin 2011, and, subject to Board approval, will be financed by ADB. Subprogram 2 will continue to \nfocus  on  fiscal  consolidation,  but  there  will  be  a  stronger  focus  on  improvements  in \ninfrastructure investment and governance to sustain higher growth, and on progress in other \nareas that may emerge from policy dialogue and engagement with the Government in 2010 and \n2011. The expected time frame for the processing of subprogram 2 is only indicative and is not \nlimited to a specific time frame in the event of a delay. \n \n63.  While subprogram 2 contains targeted policy actions, the program cluster approach \nallows an appropriate policy response to unanticipated changes in the external environment. \nThe conditions for the release of the subprogram 2 tranche will not be specified at the outset of \nthe ERSP, but will be determined in consultation with the Government on the basis of lessons \nfrom  subprogram  1.  These  conditions  are  likely  to  be  in  the  policy  areas  set  out  in  the \nsubprogram 2 triggers. This approach will ensure that the ERSP is synchronized with the \nGovernment\u2019s policy agenda and is responsive to external environmental factors. \nD.  Lessons \n64.  The design of the ERSP incorporates the lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in program \nlending in the Pacific and elsewhere.13 Country ownership is maximized by anchoring the ERSP \nin Te Kaveinga Nui, the NSDP 2007\u20132010, and the use of government systems and processes. \nFurther, the ERSP is designed to assist the Government in achieving the strategy set out for the \nFY2010 budget.  \n \n65.  The  ERSP  is  backed  by  solid  diagnostics,  communication  and  awareness-raising \ninitiatives, and a commitment to a longer-term engagement through a flexible approach aimed at \nmaximizing country ownership.14 The focus is on a systematic approach to improving policy and \nplanning capacity, in contrast to the firefighting role adopted under ADB program loans in the \nmid-1990s. \n \n66.  The cluster approach responds to the lesson that program lending has not always been \nfirmly based on an assessment of achievable rates of change, and has been too inflexible, \ncontributing to program delays. In this case, risk is heightened by the imperative to make the \ninitial disbursement early as a short-term boost to the economy. The time allowed for program \npreparation would therefore be too brief. The cluster approach gives the ERSP the flexibility to \ntailor the specific nature and timing of policy actions to the Cook Islands\u2019 circumstances at the \n                                                 \n13  Key sources of lessons are: ADB. 2009. Special Evaluation Study: ADB\u2019s Support for Public Sector Reforms in \nthe  Pacific:  Enhance  Results  through  Ownership,  Capacity,  and  Continuity.  Manila;  ADB.  2001.  Special \nEvaluation Study on Program Lending. Manila; and ADB. 1999. Reforms in the Pacific: An Assessment of the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Assistance for Reform Programs in the Pacific. Manila. \n14  Program design is built on: broad-ranging diagnostic analysis by ADB; the policy framework presented in ADB\u2019s \nTaking the Helm: A Policy Brief on a Response to the Global Crisis; and ongoing policy dialogue between the \nGovernment, development partners, and private sector and civil society representatives. \n ", "16  \ntime  subprogram 2  is  formulated.  The  cluster  approach  minimizes  the  risk  of  jeopardizing \ntechnical quality by having to compress the timetable. Government and development partner \nresources can focus on the most immediate policy actions, and have more time to consider \nfollow-on actions. \n \n67.  The  cluster  approach  also  allows  extra  time  to  build  the  demand-driven  approach \nthrough firm country ownership. In this case, the impact of the global economic crisis is already \napparent to the community (through the economic contraction of 2008), as is the downside of \ntoo-little attention to infrastructure, and there is awareness of the need for action (evaluation \nstudies have pointed to the importance of such awareness). New structures and processes can \nerode country ownership and have therefore been avoided. Instead, the preparation of the \nERSP has emphasized the use of existing institutional structures and the strengthening of \nexisting systems and processes. The extension of the program period beyond the 2010 general \nelection  will  provide  the  flexibility  to  align  the  policy  actions  with  the  agenda  of  any  new \ngovernment.15 This will also facilitate the reassessment of political commitment to the ERSP, \nwhich is considered critical given the long-term nature of the policy actions to be pursued.16  \n \n68.  Country ownership and endorsement is facilitated by a program that is relatively simple \nin  scope,  unlike  the  overly  complex  programs  developed  for  the  Pacific  in  the  1990s  (in \ncomparison,  the  Cook Islands  program  in  the  mid-1990s  identified 124  policy  actions  and \n44 tranche conditions). The simple scope will increase the likelihood of sustaining the program \nimpact by keeping the program realistic and firmly within the capacity of the Cook Islands. The \nsequencing of actions has helped keep the scope simple. The relatively simple scope will also \nfacilitate the process of communicating and encouraging broad endorsement of the program. \n \n69.  Program lending evaluations support the basic rule that broad participation, in particular \nfrom affected groups and sectors, is critical to the success of public policy reform. The ERSP \napplies this principle by (i) being anchored in the NSDP, which was prepared with the benefit of \na broad-based engagement with the community; (ii) drawing on the diagnostic work of the latest \nPacific Island Economic Report17 and the formulation of the IMP, both of which incorporated the \nfindings of extensive consultation in the main centers and the outer islands and with a range of \ncommunity groups; and (iii) including as one of five output areas, the promotion of public \ncommunication and ownership of economic and fiscal management initiatives. \n \n70.  The need for a long-term perspective and commitment identified by evaluation studies is \nimbedded in the ERSP. The program is seen as the next step in a long-term, sequenced reform \nprocess. Most policy actions, particularly those in the areas of infrastructure, and economic and \nfiscal management, build on earlier support from ADB. Many actions can be seen as follow-ons \nof a reform process begun with ADB support in the mid-1990s (e.g., commitments to the \nprinciples of fiscal responsibility in the MFEM Act and to the updating of the Manila Agreement \nfinancial ratios).18 ADB support continues through the provision of the specialist skills needed to \n                                                 \n15  To reduce the risk that the political commitment will wane, a broad range of political interests was actively \nengaged in the preparation of the IMP and the IGF and the various groups have been kept abreast of \ndevelopments. \n16  ADB\u2019s 1999 evaluation of the program loans of the 1990s (ADB. 1999. Reforms in the Pacific: An Assessment of \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assistance for Reform Programs in the Pacific. Manila, p.167) found that \u201cthe most \nsignificant success factor of Bank assistance for reforms in the Pacific is also the most obvious: political \ncommitment  to  and  ownership  of  the  reform  program  is  essential.  Externally  imposed  reform  measures \n(conditionalities) that have little government ownership are doomed to certain failure.\u201d \n17  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n18  ADB supported the Economic Reconstruction Program, which was aimed at improving public sector institutional \ncapacity and creating a more competitive economy under the leadership of a growth-oriented, productive private ", "  17\nadvance the policy agenda. The policy matrix identifies medium-term program directions as \nguideposts for support that could follow the ERSP.  \nE.  Special Features \n71.  The Cook Islands is not a member of the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank \nGroup and therefore has limited access to financial support to address the impact of the global \neconomic crisis. This requires ADB to provide a comprehensive support package to the country. \n \n72.  Support  for  the  vulnerable  is  a  feature  of  the  program,  in  recognition  of  the  extra \nhardship imposed by the global economic crisis and the preceding episode of high international \ncommodity  prices.  This  support  will  involve  maintaining  expenditure  on  selected  essential \nservices used by the vulnerable, maintaining the real value of social security payments to the \nvulnerable, and explicitly reorienting government programs to the vulnerable. In addition, a \nlinked project\u2014Supporting and Building Resilience of the Vulnerable\u2014is proposed for financing \nfrom the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. As proposed, the linked project will provide (i) a \nshort-term  response  to  the  vulnerable  (including  unemployed  youth,  women,  low-income \nhouseholds,  and  people  with  disabilities)  to  increase  their  economic  status  through \ncash-for-work  and  cash  transfer  programs;  (ii)  a  pilot  social  welfare  and  social  protection \nprogram, along with assessments of target groups and the feasibility of program types, and \npolicy recommendations as long-term measures to strengthen the social safety net; (iii) support \nfor  nongovernment  organizations  and  civil  society  activities  for  the  vulnerable;  and \n(iv) socioeconomic monitoring and evaluation of the situation of the vulnerable.  \nF.  Financing Plan \n73.  The Government has requested assistance in financing the program in the form of a \nprogram cluster amounting to $16.0 million, comprising two subprograms ($10.0 million and \n$6.0 million), from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan of $10.0 million (subprogram 1) \nwill have a term of 15 years including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined \naccording to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per year, and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The remaining cost to the budget of the actions included in \nthe policy matrix will be met by the Government. \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n74.  Program Management. MFEM will be the executing agency and will oversee policy, \nlegal, and regulatory actions and ensure that the reforms agreed to by the Government and \nADB are duly carried out on time. TA resources will be provided to help the Government meet \nthe  tranche  conditions.  MFEM  will  also  be  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of \nsubprogram  1,  including  all  policy  actions,  program  administration,  disbursements,  and \nmaintenance of all program records. The NSDC, the program coordinating committee, will meet \nat least quarterly to monitor progress and oversee the implementation of the program, and guide \n                                                                                                                                                          \nsector. The program was broadly successful. It laid the foundation for the relatively high rates of economic growth \nachieved from 1998 to 2004 (Appendix 3). \n ", "18  \nand direct the activities of the executing agency. The NSDC will invite implementing agencies to \nparticipate in meetings to discuss program implementation issues as appropriate.  \n \n75.  Implementation Period. The program cluster period will be from 1 January 2008 to \n30 December 2011. The policy, legislative, organizational, and operational changes agreed to \nwith the Government and set out in the policy matrix will be put in place during this period.  \n \n76.  Disbursement. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to the Cook Islands as the \nrecipient according to ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans.19 The proceeds will be used to finance items produced and procured in ADB \nmember countries; items in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 9) and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources are excluded. Loan proceeds disbursed against imports will \nrequire a certificate from the Government stipulating that the value of the total imports of the \nCook Islands, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance, is at least equal to the amount of the loan \nto be disbursed during a particular year. \n \n77.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe procured, with due consideration to economy and efficiency, and in compliance with the \nGovernment\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices \nacceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the international commodity market will be \nprocured according to procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. Before \nwithdrawal, the Government will open or nominate a deposit account with the Bank of Cook \nIslands or a commercial bank acceptable to ADB to receive the loan proceeds. The account will \nbe managed, operated, and liquidated according to terms satisfactory to ADB. Subprogram 1 \nwill provide for retroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred by the Government up to \n180  days  before  loan  effectiveness.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan \nproceeds, and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n78.  Tranches. The program will be provided as a cluster loan comprising two single-tranche \nsubprograms.  \n \n79.  Counterpart Funds. Local currency generated from the proceeds of the loans will be \nused to support public expenditure objectives under the program. \n \n80.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. MFEM will (i) within 3 months of \nloan effectiveness, establish and maintain a performance evaluation system for the program, \nwhich will be derived from the design and monitoring framework, policy letter, and policy matrix, \nand directly reflect indicators contained in the IGF; and (ii) monitor and report to ADB, every \n6 months during the term of the program, the implementation of policy actions and their impact \non budget outcomes and public enterprise performance (including financial and performance \nindicators),  in  line  with  the  program  impact  and  outcome  indicators  agreed  on  with  the \nGovernment. As the outcomes and impact of the program will be felt most clearly beyond the \nperiod of its implementation, these will continue to be monitored by MFEM. The monitoring of \noutcomes and impact will be useful to the Government\u2019s own processes and decision making \nand, hence, is not an onerous requirement. \n \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. ", "  19\n81.  Program Review. In cooperation with the NSDC and in conjunction with the review \nmade under the associated TA,20 ADB will periodically review the progress of implementation, \nand assess the impact of the ERSP. The Government will keep ADB informed of the outcome of \npolicy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for ERSP \nimplementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy \nproposals. ADB, in collaboration with the NSDC and other multilateral and bilateral agencies, \nwill review program performance 12 months after loan effectiveness to review the outcome of \nsubprogram  1  and  begin  preparing  subprogram  2.  This  review  will  (i) evaluate  the \nimplementation of the policy reform measures under subprogram 1; (ii) assess the impact on \neach sector; (iii) describe lessons identified during the program period; and (iv) outline reforms \nand  assistance  needed  for  sustained  economic  recovery,  to  enable  the  processing  of \nsubprogram 2. \n \n82.  The Government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators for \nmonitoring ERSP implementation and evaluating its impact, within the overall ERSP design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n83.  A program completion report will be prepared for each subprogram, with an overall \nreport to be prepared within 1 year following the end of the program to evaluate its overall \nsuccess. The Government will continue to monitor and evaluate the program at least until the \nprogram completion report is prepared. \n \n84.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) has \nbeen explained to and discussed with the Government and the executing agency. Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the \nright to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive practices relating to the program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan agreement. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the program will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the program. These actions will \ncomplement the relatively high standard of financial accountability and anticorruption measures \nalready in place (Appendix 5).21 \n \n85.  Technical Assistance. Subproject 1 of the ADB TA for Pacific Economic Management: \nResponse to the Global Economic Crisis is supporting economic monitoring, analysis, and \npolicy  advice  by  Pacific  developing  member  countries  in  a  joint  effort  with  development \npartners.22  The TA supports the strengthening of economic monitoring systems and using this \ninformation to provide higher-quality economic advice. The TA is focused on assisting in the \nformulation and implementation of country-specific actions in response to the global economic \ncrisis. The preparation of action plans by the Cook Islands, with support from the TA, will inform \nthe preparation of subprogram 2 of the program loan. \n \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Cook Islands for Infrastructure Services Delivery Improvement. Manila. (TA \n7287-COO approved on 19 May for $600,000). This TA will support implementation of the IGF.  \n21 In the 2007 country performance assessment (the latest to include the Cook Islands), the Cook Islands ranked \nhighest among ADB\u2019s developing member countries (accessing the Asian Development Fund) for budgetary and \nfinancial management; (with Samoa) for transparency, accountability, and anticorruption efforts; and for public \nadministration.

The  ADB  TA  for  Infrastructure  Services  Delivery  Improvement  is  assisting  the \nGovernment in implementing the IGF (footnote 20). The TA is expected to result in the effective \ndelivery of environmentally sustainable infrastructure and infrastructure services (TA impact). It \nwill  establish  a  governance  framework  in  support  of  infrastructure  management  and \ndevelopment (TA outcome), characterized by common processes for developing infrastructure \ninvestment plans, effective and efficient financial and operational management of assets, and \nappropriate  opportunities  for  community  service  obligations.  This  TA  will  provide  capacity \nsupport to the Government in achieving the program objectives in the areas of structural reform \nand improved governance. It will be implemented over a 2-year period and will be followed by \nfurther TA to help sustain the implementation of the IGF beyond the period of the program loan.  \n \n87.  Details of other development assistance to the Cook Islands are in Appendix 10. \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impact \n88.  Economic.  The  program  will  provide  budget  support  to  enable  the  Government  to \nstimulate the economy and thereby respond to the economic downturn caused by the global \neconomic crisis. It will then support the recovery of the economy and the transition to higher and \nmore-inclusive economic growth. Investment in priority infrastructure projects will deliver the \nhigher-quality and lower-cost services needed for economic growth and provide opportunities \nfor local businesses to participate in service delivery. \n \n89.  Social. The program will help the Government reduce poverty incidence and bring back \nthe economy onto its long-run growth path. An analysis of social and gender issues is in \nAppendix 8. Benefits will be accrued in the short term through the mitigation of the negative \neffects of the global economic crisis, and in the medium to long term through the implementation \nof the IGF, which will allow improved basic infrastructure service delivery (water, sanitation, \ntelecommunications, transport, roads, and power). Improved water and sanitation will deliver \nhealth benefits through lower risk of infection from contaminated water supplies and untreated \nor poorly managed waste. The transport improvements will provide social benefits of improved \naccessibility and transport safety. In the medium term, the IGF will also generate benefits \nthrough introduction of an equitable system of user charges for infrastructure that protects the \nvulnerable. This will avoid costs being unfairly borne by those who do not benefit from the \nservices while providing safeguards for the vulnerable users. The summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n90.  Environmental. Environmental benefits will arise from implementation of the IGF in the \nmedium term as this will allow the Government to optimize the contribution of infrastructure to \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. Infrastructure investment projects will incorporate improved \npollution  management,  mitigation  of  the  effects  of  climate  change,  energy  efficiency,  and \nsubstitution of petroleum fuels with renewable energy. User charges will lead to more efficient \nand less wasteful resource use. An environmental assessment is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n91.  Financial. The program will encourage improved fiscal management and budgeting \nfocus on priority expenditures. A progressive increase in user charges for infrastructure services \nand preventative maintenance will remove unnecessary costs from the Government budget. ", "  21\nImproved cost efficiency in the provision of infrastructure services will give more fiscal space for \nthe Government\u2019s other social and development spending.  \nB.  Risks \n92.  The risks are as follows: (i) unforeseen technical and legal problems could delay capital \nexpenditure; (ii) the Government may have insufficient capacity to implement the program; (iii) a \nshortfall  in  financing  may  prevent  the  Government  from  optimizing  infrastructure  and \nimplementing policy actions linked to the program; (iv) community support for the Government\u2019s \nactions may be insufficient; and (v) the Government\u2019s commitment to the program could wane in \nthe lead-up to the 2010 election. \n \n93.  The  first  two  risks  are  to  be  monitored  and  reduced  through  the  provision  of  TA \n(footnotes 20 and 22). It is recognized that although there is commitment at a political and \ninstitutional level to continuing the implementation of reforms in infrastructure services delivery, \ntechnical and managerial resources are in short supply. The TA for infrastructure services \ndelivery improvement will assist in supplementing the expertise to implement the IGF over the \nfirst 4 years of implementation (footnote 20). However, there is still a risk that not enough skilled \nstaff will be retained or recruited by the line ministries and public enterprises to ensure the \nsustainability of the changes. To offset this risk, the design of the TA will include (in the second \nstage)  the  development  of  a  program  for  human  resource  development  in  infrastructure \noperations and management. \n \n94.  The risk of a shortfall in government financing will be managed through the provision of \nTA  for  improved  economic  management  (footnote  22).  The  operation  of  effective \ncommunication programs is to be imbedded within the program to encourage broad-based \ncommunity support for the Government\u2019s response to the global economic crisis, and actions to \nrevitalize the economy. The Government\u2019s commitment is to be reevaluated after the late-2010 \nelection as part of the formulation of subprogram 2. \n \n95.  The ERSP relies on (i) a positive response by the private sector to improved economic \nconditions; (ii) government agencies\u2019 commitment to improved performance; and (iii) restraint by \ngovernment agencies in increasing current expenditure, given their weak revenue performance. \n \n96.  Overall, the potential benefits from reducing the impact of the global economic crisis and \nproviding  improved  basic  infrastructure  services  with  supporting  structural  and  governance \ninitiatives  are  considered  to  outweigh  the  risks.  Indeed,  the  costs  of  no  action  could  be \nsubstantial.

The Recovery from the Mid-1990s Economic Crisis \n1.  The Cook Islands\u2019 economy achieved 6 consecutive years of growth to 2004 as it \nrecovered from the economic crisis of the mid-1990s. Economic reforms adopted in response to \nthe crisis provided the catalyst to growth by setting the foundation for a robust expansion in \nprivate sector activity. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 6.0% yearly on average \nfrom the turnaround in economic performance to 2004, above the long-run yearly growth rate of \n3.5%. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2013supported Economic Reconstruction Program in \nthe mid-1990s was aimed at improving public sector institutional capacity and creating a more \ncompetitive economy under the leadership of a growth-oriented, productive private sector.2 The \nprogram was largely successful. This is evident in the good rates of private sector\u2013led economic \ngrowth, a large fall in unemployment to low rates, and the business community\u2019s reasonably \nfavorable assessments of the operating environment. Key achievements were the (i) reduction \nin excess employment in the public service and an associated correction of public servant pay \nrates, (ii) reduced involvement of the public sector in business activities, (iii) adoption of a \nmodern  tax  system  centered  on  the  value-added  tax  and  the  reform  of  import  duties, \n(iv) strengthening  of  the  financial  system  through  reform  of  the  state  bank  and  improved \nsupervision, and (v) a more open stance toward foreign investment and workers. \n \n3.  Tourism now leads the Cook Islands economy and the structural transformation to a \nservice-oriented economy is largely complete. Visitor arrivals have grown from less than 50,000 \npeople in the mid-1990s to almost 100,000, compared with a resident population of around \n15,000. Tourism growth has led a more general expansion encompassing the wholesale and \nretail trade, restaurants and accommodation, and transport and communications. However, this \nlack of economic diversification carries significant risks. \n \n4.  The risk was highlighted in 2005. Damage from cyclone Hera and the disruption it \ncaused to tourism saw the economic recovery end in 2005. Real GDP grew by an estimated \n1.1% in 2008, following growth of 1.4% in 2007 and only 0.7% in 2006. The weaker growth \nperformance  appears  to  be  linked  as  well  to  insufficient  progress  in  deepening  economic \nreforms. Productivity growth and the accumulation of physical and human capital appear to \nhave  fallen  short  of  that  needed  to  sustain  the  growth  momentum.  The  accumulation  of \nproductive capital appears to have been slowed by tighter restrictions on foreign investment, \nlargely implemented through indirect means that lack transparency and certainty. The local \nlabor supply is close to fully employed, and imported labor is required to meet demand and \navoid a rising cost structure. However, concerns regarding the potential dilution of the Cook \n                                                 \n1  The sector diagnostics presented in this appendix draw heavily on ADB. 2008.

The Financial Sector \n5.  Commercial  bank  lending  has  provided  a  key  source  of  funding  for  the  surge  in \ninvestment in recent years, complementing high levels of foreign investment. Business lending \nhas been concentrated in hotels and motels. Commercial bank lending to hotels and motels was \n5% of GDP in 1996, had risen to 9% by 2000, and was 23% by 2005.  \n \n6.  Two branches of major Australian banks, Westpac and ANZ, account for over 90% of \nloans (Westpac is by far the largest). The third bank, the state-owned Bank of Cook Islands, has \nimproved operations but continues to struggle with very-limited access to deposits and loan \nfunds.  \n \n7.  Both Australian branches have borrowed overseas to supplement domestic funds to \nmeet credit demand. Interest rate spreads are notably higher than Australian levels (of around \n3%\u20134%). Commercial loans, especially in tourism and related services, represent a major share \nof both branches\u2019 loan books, as do housing loans, the main area of recent growth. Commercial \nloans are short term (below 10 years) and usually secured against land (lease) collateral. The \ncollateral and legal foreclosure processes appear to work satisfactorily and have not hampered \nbank lending. The share of nonperforming loans held by banks is less than 5%.  \n \n8.  Banking  soundness  is  enhanced  by  having  the  two  foreign  branches  prudentially \nsupervised by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority and also by the Cook Islands\u2019 \nFinancial Supervisory Commission, which also supervises the Bank of Cook Islands. Banks, \nincluding  foreign  branches,  must  be  licensed  by  the  Financial  Supervisory  Commission  to \noperate in the Cook Islands to ensure prudential soundness in accordance with the Basel core \nprinciples on banking supervision. The number of licenses is not fixed, and entry to banking is \nopen to any applicant that meets the prudential requirements. \n \n9.  The Bank of Cook Islands began operations on July 2001 through a restructured merger \nof the Cook Islands Savings Bank and the Cook Islands Development Bank, which had suffered \nlarge losses on development loans to the pearling industry. The Bank of Cook Islands currently \noperates as a retail commercial bank, focusing on smaller domestic investors. It is free from \ngovernment interference in its operations, and a good level of transparency and accountability is \nin place. Nevertheless, the bank is struggling to make a profit. \n \n10.  It is uncertain whether the banking market is large enough to sustain three commercial \nbanks in the long term, and the small market share of the Bank of Cook Islands means it is \nunlikely to provide any additional competitive pressures for the two major banks. Government \ninvolvement in such a commercial activity carries risk, including the potential for state favoritism \nand a breakdown in corporate governance. Thus, although not a high priority, the Government \ncould consider divesting its ownership of Bank of Cook Islands, and using the funds to finance \nalternative public investments that would contribute more to national welfare.  \n \n11.  As the Cook Islands currency is the New Zealand dollar, there is no potential for an \nindependent monetary policy.  \n ", "Appendix 3  37\nC.  Measures to Sustain Economic Growth \n12.  Tourism is likely to remain the driver of economic growth, concentrated on Rarotonga \nand Aitutaki. Land suitable for agriculture exists on Rarotonga and the southern group of outer \nislands, but experience suggests that the economy\u2019s strengths are elsewhere and agricultural \nactivity will be limited to the sale of fresh fruit and vegetables to Rarotonga and Aitutaki and \nsmall niche-market opportunities (e.g., sales to Honolulu of maire, from whose leaves are \nfashioned garlands, and coffee exports from Atiu). A key factor is the regionally high cost of \nlabor and the availability of more-attractive employment alternatives (e.g., in tourism or the \npublic sector). \n \n13.  Pearl farming on Manihiki will continue to be the main private sector activity in the \nremote northern group of outer islands, provided that farm management issues are addressed \nand world prices are favorable. Other potential contributors to private sector activity in the \nnorthern group include offshore fishing and fish processing, and handicrafts. But the scale of \nthese  activities  is  likely  to  stay  relatively  small.  Public  sector  employment  will  remain  the \ndominant source of income and jobs in the northern group, and in the southern group (excluding \nAitutaki). \n \n14.  Raising the productivity of infrastructure is an important step toward sustaining overall \neconomic growth. The tight fiscal management necessary to correct the Cook Islands\u2019 very high \ndebt levels and the absence of a clear planning framework for infrastructure have contributed to \na  backlog  of  investment.  Roads,  water,  sewerage,  electricity,  and  harbors  and  ports  on \nRarotonga and Aitutaki are potential constraints on growth over the medium term. Existing \ninfrastructure tends to impose unnecessarily high costs on users and in some cases is unable to \nmeet new demands at a reasonable cost or standard (e.g., water on Aitutaki or liquid waste \ndisposal on Rarotonga).  \n \n15.  A number of structural barriers in the economy have the potential to become significant \nconstraints on growth. Most import duties were removed with the fiscal year FY2007 budget, but \nsome  were  retained.  Protective  import  tariffs  were  retained  on  most  goods  that  are  also \nproduced locally in an attempt to reduce the competitiveness of imports and hence support local \nproducers, especially in agriculture and drink manufacture. The difficulty is that these protective \ntariffs  feed  into  the  cost  structure  of  the  tourism  industry  and  reduce  its  competitiveness. \nFurthermore, they tend to lock scarce local labor and capital into areas of the economy with low \nproductivity and questionable long-term prospects. It would be better for the country if such \nprotective tariffs were removed or at least phased out to allow resources to move to their most \nproductive use. Some tariffs on inputs to production, such as those on vehicles, have been kept \nto boost revenue and they also tend to reduce the economy\u2019s competitiveness. \n \n16.  An extensive regime of price controls covers most basic food items and fuel. The intent \nis to keep key items affordable. These controls can, however, force overall prices up (and \nindications exist that they do), and they tend to shift profit margins from one item to another \nrather  than  actually  reducing  the  overall  cost  of  consumer  items.  From  a  public  policy \nperspective, price controls can be justified only when effective competition is lacking. Few if any \nof the items currently controlled meet this criterion, at least on Rarotonga and probably also on \nthe outer islands. A better way to keep goods affordable is to provide for a competitive business \nenvironment. Effective competition can be relied on to minimize costs to society, but the current \n ", "38   Appendix 3 \nadministrative mechanisms inevitably impose additional burdens on society through market \ndistortions and administrative costs.  \n \n17.  The tendency to overregulate prices notwithstanding, one key area of the economy \ngenuinely needs better price supervision. Telecom Cook Islands has a monopoly and for many \nyears has earned very high profits by overcharging. Such monopolistic behavior reduces the \neconomy\u2019s competitiveness and has adverse social effects, not least worsening the country\u2019s \nremoteness. An agreement with the Government providing key monopoly rights to Telecom \nCook Islands has recently expired, but remains in place via legislative restrictions. While prices \nfor certain international services have been reduced in recent years, it remains important that \nregulatory changes be pursued to facilitate the entry of new suppliers so as to remove any \nremaining  overcharging.  Similar  changes  are  warranted  in  electricity  supply,  though  the \npotential benefits are not as great as in telecommunications. \n \n18.  The education and training sector has an important role to play in maintaining growth. \nLocal labor is in short supply, and this imposes a potential constraint on growth. Adult education \nand further improvements in educational standards have the potential to lift labor productivity \nand underpin a move to higher-valued activities (e.g., in tourism). Better education and training \ncan also contribute to growth by helping to keep residents in the Cook Islands so they are \navailable to meet the needs of the labor market. Education is particularly important for ensuring \nthe  mobility  of  outer  islanders  and  their  ability  to  gain  access  to  the  better  services  and \nopportunities offered by the main centers. \n \n19.  Other efforts are required if economic growth is to return to moderate levels. The initial \npriorities for the economy are to follow through on plans to contract out the operation of the fuel \ntank farms that the Government is planning to buy and to make government subsidies open to \ncompetitive bidding from alternative service providers, so as to maximize the value for money \nthey generate. Over time, it will be important to reduce the size of the public service and the \noverall cost of government, to privatize state enterprises, and to improve tourism infrastructure \non Rarotonga and Aitutaki. \nD.  Links to the Sustainability of Communities \n20.  Perhaps  the  biggest  current  development  challenge  is  a  long-term  decline  in  the \npopulation of indigenous Cook Islanders, from around 21,000 in 1971 to the current estimate of \naround 15,000. Those holding Cook Island residency also hold New Zealand citizenship and \nhave free access to the New Zealand and Australian job markets and the New Zealand health, \neducation, and social security systems. More than three times as many Cook Islanders live \noverseas than in the Cook Islands. The predominant migration flows have been from the outer \nislands to Rarotonga, and from Rarotonga to New Zealand and beyond. Standards of social \nservices, notably education, are generally believed to be important determinants of migration, \nand migration has also responded to variations in the economic fortunes of the Cook Islands. \nEconomic management and social service delivery therefore have important contributions to \nmake in sustaining the population and identity of Cook Islanders.  \n \n21.  Despite  its  overall  success,  economic  reform  has  succeeded  in  generating \nprivate sector\u2013led growth only on Rarotonga and Aitutaki. Elsewhere the private sector has not \nresponded  or,  perhaps  more  correctly,  has  been  unable  to  respond  to  the  new  business \nenvironment. In general, the main impact of the mid-1990s reform on the outer islands was an \nexodus of people. There was no offsetting gain in economic sustainability, as the public sector \n ", "Appendix 3  39\ncontinues to dominate island economies and crowds out prospects of sustainable private sector \nactivity. This crowding-out effect has grown since the reform, not eased. Public sector and \nsocial  security  payments  funded  by  the  Government  are  now  the  predominant  source  of \neconomic activity in most outer islands. Some outer islands will soon face the prospect of an \nintractable economic dependency, while others appear to have already reached such a state.  \nE.  Finding Balance in Foreign Involvement in the Economy \n22.  The makeup of the country is changing as the number of foreign workers and investors \nrise, people of Cook Islands descent continue to depart, and fertility rates decline. The foreign, \nnon-tourist population was estimated at 1,000 through the 1990s. Official estimates now put this \npopulation at 7,000, or around 30% of the total population. While these estimates probably \noverstate the foreign presence (it is difficult to distinguish returning Cook Islanders from other \narrivals, and many returnees are probably included in the official estimates of foreigners), the \nforeign presence is clearly significant and rising.  \n \n23.  Some community members are concerned about the follow-on effects of a rising foreign \npresence,  including  the  potential  erosion  of  the  Cook  Islands  identity.  This  has  a  social \ndimension, as the culture is seen to be at risk. It is also seen to have a commercial dimension, \nreflecting  concerns  that  the  tourism  industry  may  suffer  if  the  easygoing  lifestyle  and \nCook Islands face of the industry is lost. Some foresee that Rarotonga and Aitutaki may evolve \ninto high-density tourism destinations with little involvement with, or connection to, Cook Island \nMaoris other than by way of rental payments on leased land. \n \n24.  Public policy could respond to these issues in a range of ways. At one extreme is a ban \non further foreign involvement, and at the other extreme is the free flow of foreign labor and \ninvestment. The first extreme would probably see economic growth stall, as there would be no \nadditional labor to meet growing demand. It would also carry the risk of the Cook Islands \neconomy losing its competitiveness and actually contracting if local labor were too forceful in \ntaking advantage of the opportunity created to push up pay rates. The opposite extreme would \nminimize the economy\u2019s cost structure by tending to keep wages down. That would probably \nmaximize economic growth but could also bring very large changes in the nature of the Cook \nIslands as the foreign presence grows, especially if Cook Islanders continue to leave for better \nwages overseas.  \n \n25.  The Government\u2019s current approach is a middle path. Foreign workers are allowed \nwhere local skills are not available, and foreign investment is allowed outside reserve activity \nareas (and also within them under certain conditions). Foreign workers and investors both pay \nfees,  which  lightly  control  entry.  The  guiding  policy  framework  however  lacks  clarity  and \ncoordination, and this can give rise to uncertainty and inconsistencies.  \n \n26.  Efficiency, accountability, and transparency would be improved by a more open and \nclearly defined system. Support for local labor and business owners to upgrade their skills so \nthey can play a more prominent role in the economy is probably also important in finding \nbalance on this issue. Tightening current controls on foreign involvement (a proposal that is \nalready well advanced) could be achieved through a variety of means. Higher fees are one \noption for limiting access. Quotas could be set for foreign labor, or partial bans could be applied \n(e.g., for certain skills, industries, or islands). Some options are better than others, so potential \nimpact should be analyzed and discussed openly.  \n \n ", "40   Appendix 4 \nFISCAL ANALYSIS1 \nA.  The Overall Fiscal Stance \n1.  Good  economic  growth  combined  with  improved  tax  administration  provided  for \nsubstantial growth in the real (absolute) value of revenue following the reform of the mid-1990s. \nThe ratio of internal revenue to gross domestic product (GDP) has been relatively steady at \nslightly above 30%. Foreign aid has been relatively high, ranging from 5% to 10% of GDP. Total \nrevenue collections have thus typically been around 40% of GDP, giving rise to a relatively large \ngovernment by international standards. \n \n2.  Expenditure  has  nonetheless  been  kept  within  the  revenue  envelope.  Operating \nsurpluses of up to 5% of GDP were achieved until FY2008. This provided the Government with \ngood financial capacity to either fund investment or run overall budget surpluses. In the event, \ncapital expenditure was restrained and the overall budget was in surplus until FY2006 and in \nnear balance in FY2007, and there was only a small overall deficit in FY2008. \n \n3.  Government debt had reached extraordinarily high levels over the 1990s because of \npoor management of the Government\u2019s involvement in commercial activities and high budget \ndeficits. Debt peaked at 141% of GDP before a debt restructuring facilitated by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), known as the Manila Agreement, cut debt by around half. The \nbudget surpluses, the appreciation of the New Zealand dollar, and a further write-down in the \ndebt in 2004 (by the Government of France) and in 2006 (by the Government of Italy) reduced \ngross general government debt to 16.8% of GDP by FY2008. Once government cash reserves \nbuilt up to cover future loan obligations were taken into account, the net outstanding debt was \nonly 2.2% of GDP. \n \n4.  The gross debt ratios are based on the book value of debt. Nearly all of the current debt \nis external debt secured on concessionary terms from ADB. Moreover, the net present value of \nthe gross debt, which determines the effective value of the debt, is much lower than the gross \ndebt. Hence, prudent fiscal management had transformed the general government sector from a \nposition of extreme debt to one of being close to debt free. \n \n5.  The  tight  fiscal  position  required  post-reform  was,  however,  at  the  expense  of  the \ncountry\u2019s physical infrastructure. A backlog of investment has accumulated in the area of roads, \nports and harbors, electricity, water, liquid and solid waste management, telecommunications, \nand  government  buildings.  Nonfinancial  factors  have  also  contributed  to  the  backlog  of \ninvestment. The Government\u2019s strong financial position means it is now well placed to address \nthe backlog of investment. The improved financial capacity is timely, as the economic expansion \nhas led to bottlenecks in the infrastructure network, and these place growth and public safety at \nrisk.  \n \n6.  The FY2009 budget signaled a move to a more expansionary fiscal stance. Although the \nfiscal expansion was primarily due to rising capital expenditure, there was also some relaxation \nin current expenditure. Notably, subsidies to business were increased and the hosting of the \nPacific  Mini-Games  in  late  2009  carried  with  it  a  substantial  operating  expense,  which \ncollectively saw the operating balance move to deficit in FY2009.  \n                                                 \n1  The sector diagnostics presented in this appendix draw heavily on ADB. 2008. Cook Islands 2008 Social and \nEconomic Report: Equity in Development. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 4  41\nB.  The Quality of the Revenue System \n7.  Good progress was made on the revenue side of the budget, with the tax and customs \nsystem modernized during the economic reform. The tax system is centered on a progressive \nincome tax and flat-rate value-added tax. Tax rates have been kept reasonable and stable, and \nattention  has  been  paid  to  maintaining  the  simplicity  of  the  system.  The  improved  design \ncorrected  for  many  inefficiencies  and  inequities  in the  revenue  system.  Further,  over  time \nadministration and compliance have been improved to lift the performance of the tax and \ncustoms system. \n \n8.  There are nevertheless some areas where the performance of the revenue system could \nbe improved, notably through the following: \n \n(i)  The (phased) removal of the remaining protective tariffs, mainly because of the \ninefficiencies they impose on the economy. \n(ii)  The early removal of the high tax rates that apply to second jobs. The high tax \nrates are inequitable, as people on the same income can pay different levels of \ntax depending on whether they have one or more jobs (an equitable outcome \nwould be one where they pay equal taxes). The high tax rates are also inefficient, \nas they adversely affect the incentive to work. \n(iii)  The adoption over the medium term of a capital gains tax and a fringe benefits \ntax. Better-performing tax systems include all sources of income in the definition \nof taxable income.  \n(iv)  Greater reliance on user charges, subject to equity concerns being addressed \n(e.g.,  through  concessions  for  the  disadvantaged).  There  is  very  little  user \ncharging for government services (e.g., public health and education are provided \nfree of charge), and where charges are levied (e.g., most infrastructure services) \nthey tend to be less than operating costs. \n(vii)  Increased returns from some underperforming public enterprises. \nC.  The Quality of Public Expenditure \n9.  Important progress has also been made in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of \npublic  expenditure.  The  annual  budget  process  requires  ministries  to  prepare  budget \nsubmissions that are scrutinized for potential improvements by the cabinet and the Ministry of \nFinance  and  Economic  Management  (MFEM),  and  efforts  are  being  made  to  raise  the \nsophistication of the process as the capacity of agencies allows. This capacity has been built \nthrough the modernization of the financial management system, improvements in corporate \nplanning overseen by the Public Service Commission, and attention to staff training.  \n \n10.  The formation of a Budget Committee of outside parties to engage in the budget process \nhas emerged as an important initiative. The reports of the committee are notable for their \nvigorous analysis of agency budgets and performance, and they have considerable standing in \nthe  process  and  the  cabinet\u2019s  final  consideration  of  the  proposed  budget.  Efficiency  and \neffectiveness is also assisted by the practice of conducting publicly available, special-purpose \nreviews of key issues, recent examples being of outer-island funding, health management, and \nthe funding and operations of the police force. \n \n11.  The budget process is greatly strengthened by the activities of the Public Expenditure \nReview  Committee  and  Audit,  which  has  a  solid  record  of  providing  forthright,  detailed \nassessments of the use of public funds, and has been prepared to identify publicly inappropriate \n ", "42   Appendix 4 \npractices at the most senior levels of the Government and the community. Areas subject to its \nreview include the actions of ministers, the accounts of ministries, the sale and attempted sale \nof  government  assets,  and  development  partner  projects.  The  key  limitations  of  the  audit \nprocess have been the 2- to 3-year gap in the complete submission of public accounts for audit, \nas this can delay the Public Expenditure Review Committee and Audit\u2019s work until well after \nevents have taken place, and the discretion provided to Parliament as to when the Public \nExpenditure Review Committee and Audit\u2019s reports are tabled or responded to. Actions to \nimprove financial management systems are scheduled to reduce the gap in submission of public \naccounts to less than 1 year soon. The volume and standard of public disclosure achieved \nthrough the Cook Islands\u2019 audit function is probably now the highest among the Pacific island \ncountries and approaching that achievable by the country\u2019s larger neighbors.  \n \n12.  The need to now increase public investment to sustain growth and achieve ecologically \nsustainable development poses a new challenge. Ensuring high quality in capital spending \nremains  an  issue  and  requires  that  government  agencies  follow  a  transparent  and  robust \nprocess of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, funding, and implementing investment projects. It \nis essential that projects have clear social and economic benefits and achieve a satisfactory rate \nof return, particularly where financed from loan funds. Projects that are self-funding from a \nrevenue stream or that result in savings in maintenance and operating cost that outweigh the \ncost of the capital investment are preferred from a fiscal perspective. \n \n13.  Other key issues to be faced in refining public expenditure are:  \n \n(i)  Sector priorities. For the Cook Islands, the economic priorities are likely to lie in \neconomic infrastructure, education, and health. A backlog of infrastructure needs \nto be addressed, there is considerable potential to raise education standards and \ndoing so is important to satisfying the human capital needs of the economy, and \nthe  health  system  is  facing  the  challenge  of  a  rising  incidence  of \nnoncommunicable diseases. \n(ii)  The wage bill. There has been considerable growth in the number of public \nsector employees since the cuts of the mid-1990s. There were 3,200 employees \nin early 1996. Numbers had been cut to 1,500 by early 1997, but have since \nrisen to around 2,000. MFEM has recognized that the expenditure on the wage \nbill was tending to suppress funding for capital goods and services, and hence \nthe funding needed for the delivery of government services. \n(iii)  Inequities between islands. There is considerable variation across islands in \nfunding for essential services. For example, in total funding for outer-island staff \ncosts for education and health, and the island administration (which is largely for \nthe operation of infrastructure), varied from NZ$1,050 per person on Aitutaki to \nNZ$4,600 per person on Rakahanga in FY2007. The average per person for the \nouter islands was of the order of double the allocation to Rarotonga. There is no \nobvious public policy rationale for these variations in funding. \nD.  Debt Sustainability \n14.  The achievement of a sustainable debt position has been one of the key results of the \neconomic reform. The fiscal transformation was guided by the principles of fiscal responsibility \nestablished under the MFEM Act and financial ratios established under the Manila Agreement. \nUnder the Manila Agreement, the Government made a commitment: (i) not to undertake new \ncommercial borrowings for 7 years; (ii) that key financial ratios (in relation to debt, wages and \n ", "  Appendix 4  43\nsalaries and recurrent expenditure on goods and services) would not exceed their levels as of \nthe end of 2001\u201302; (iii) that the operating budget balance would remain in surplus; and (iv) that \nborrowing  by  state-owned  enterprises  would  be  limited  to  activities  that  generate  enough \nadditional revenue to service the debt. \n \n15.  Under current expenditure plans, the net public debt of the general government sector \nwould rise rapidly to the order of 25% of GDP (all of it external). Net debt would, however, \nremain within prudent threshold levels. For example, the net debt ratio would be well below the \n50% debt-to-GDP threshold set for a well-performing low-income economy. The projected debt \nposition also compares favorably with debt thresholds based on comparisons with exports and \ngovernment revenue. \n \n16.  Debt accumulation can be thought of as sustainable if interest and principal repayments \ncan be met by a borrower without an unrealistically large future correction in the balance of \nincome and expenditure.2 Judged on this basis, the fiscal position is sustainable. Long-term \nrevenue prospects are sound, provided prudent public investments are made to relieve the \ninfrastructure constraint on economic growth. There are also a number of other sensible options \nfor accommodating the projected rise in debt servicing costs of the general government sector. \nMoreover, important safeguards are included in the finance legislation, and there is a good \nrecord of compliance with such safeguards. \n \n17.  This conclusion is reached subject to the proviso that debt is secured for well-planned \nand  justified  capital  expenditure,  and  that  public  enterprise  debt  is,  as  planned,  funded \nindependently of the budget (excepting justified community service obligations).  \n \n18.  In interpreting these findings, it is important to keep in mind that the Cook Islands is \nvulnerable to natural disaster and adverse economic developments. This vulnerability means \nthat the Cook Islands should aim for a lower debt level than normal so as to provide a buffer \nagainst shocks (to retain the capacity to borrow in adverse circumstances). This observation, \ncombined with the need to retain the fiscal capacity to complete the planned infrastructure \nupgrade, suggests that the accumulation of public debt now under way should be approached \ncarefully. \n \n19.  The fiscal improvements saw a progressive upgrade from 1998 in the credit rating \nissued by Standard & Poor\u2019s. On 11 August 2009, Standard & Poor\u2019s revised its outlook on the \nCook Islands to negative from stable, while reaffirming its BB/B foreign currency and local \ncurrency credit ratings on the sovereign.3 The updated rating took into account the FY2010 \nbudget and projections of an increase in net debt to an estimated 28% of GDP. Standard & \nPoor\u2019s noted that the projected increase in debt would be temporary, and reflect the bringing \nforward of some port, water, and road infrastructure projects to benefit from concessionary \nterms available from development partners and to address infrastructure shortcomings that \nimpair investment in tourism and allied sectors, which are needed to diversify the economy and \nprovide employment opportunities for the population.4 \n                                                 \n2  International  Monetary  Fund.  2002.

Demands on the public sector are rising, and it must respond by continuing to focus on \nresults.  The  community  demands  higher  service  standards,  higher  incomes,  and  more \nopportunities. The aspiration appears to be to reach New Zealand standards, while at the same \ntime preserving the Cook Islands lifestyle, as modernized on Rarotonga and maintained in more \ntraditional style on the outer islands. At the same time, a declining share of government revenue \nto gross domestic product requires tighter prioritization of government expenditure.  \n \n2.  Public sector management rests on four pieces of legislation enacted as part of the \neconomic reform. These are the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) Act, \n1996; the Public Expenditure Review Committee and Audit (PERCA) Act, 1996; the Public \nService Act, 1996; and the Cook Islands Investment Corporation Act, 1998.  \n \n3.  The MFEM Act provides for detailed annual statements of the Government\u2019s financial \nposition  and  its  activities  according  to  modern  principles  of  budgeting,  and  more  frequent \nupdates of economic and financial conditions. The PERCA Act provides a safeguard against \nfinancial impropriety through its financial audits of government accounts and special-purpose \nreviews of the use of public funds. The heads of ministries operate under performance-based \ncontracts overseen by the public service commissioner, who also has a role in establishing and \noverseeing  the  public  service.  And  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  has  been \nestablished with responsibility for the overall management of public enterprises and other public \nassets. \n \n4.  The main achievement of the modern management system established under this suite \nof  legislation  has  been  a  substantial  improvement  in  the  quality  of  financial  management: \ninternal management reports are prepared regularly; almost all expenditure is on-budget; all \nassets  and  liabilities  (including  contingent  liabilities)  are  identified;  there  is  a  good  public \ndisclosure of the financial position; audits are timely and most concerns raised are minor; and \nexpenditure is generally in line with approved funding. The improvements have been achieved \nacross the public sector, including the public enterprises. In stark contrast to the situation \n15 years ago, the Government now has in place one of the foundations required for effective \nand efficient management of public resources.  \n \n5.  The  progress  that  has  been  made  is  most  readily  evidenced  by  the  substantial \nimprovement  in  the  Government\u2019s  financial  position.  The  fiscal  position  was  unsustainable \n10 years ago. By 2008, the Government was almost debt free and there has been a significant \nlowering of the tax burden. It is also evident in the increasing alignment and harmonization of \ndevelopment partner funds, as initiated by the New Zealand and Australian aid programs, which \nhas resulted in the integration of almost all development partner-funded programs and projects \ninto the budget process. \n                                                 \n1  The sector diagnostics presented in this appendix draw heavily on ADB. 2008. Cook Islands 2008 Social and \nEconomic Report: Equity in Development. Manila. \n ", "46   Appendix 5 \nB.  Priorities \n6.  A remaining gap in public sector management is the establishment of a systematic \nprocess for assessing performance. While the budget sets out a work plan with targeted results \nand performance measures for the outputs of each ministry, they are not scrutinized in a \nsystematic manner. The management system established for ministries requires the Public \nService Commission to regularly review progress in delivering these outputs, but no such review \nis undertaken. Many performance measures are unrealistic\u2014too high to be of use in the annual \nreview.  Heads  of  ministries  are  subject  to  performance  review,  but  without  ministry-level \ninformation the review can be only superficial. This means that the cycle of inputs, activities, and \noutputs required to feed back into reformulation in subsequent years is weak at best and, at \nworst, completely absent.  \n \n7.  Adopting  a  performance  management  system  would  be  greatly  assisted  by  the \nimplementation of the National Sustainable Development Plan 2006\u20132010 (NSDP). The NSDP \nsets out the national vision and goals, as well as the direction to be followed by the lower-level \nplans  (sector  strategies,  corporate  plans,  and  the  annual  budget).  The  plan  presents  an \nimportant opportunity to reinvigorate the broader engagement of the community in the use of \npublic sector resources. \n \n8.  A further gap is in the integration of the substantial payments on behalf of the Crown and \naid activities into ministry outputs. While their use is identified in the budget, at present they are \ntreated  as stand-alone  activities  and  accountability  for  delivery  is  not  defined. A  complete \nperformance assessment system would build in this accountability link. \n \n9.  Improvements can also be made in the mode of government operation. For example, \nkey issues to be faced in developing infrastructure include the process of selecting public \ninvestment, management weaknesses within agencies, low-cost recovery on public services, \nand problems faced in the devolution of responsibilities to island councils. The competitive \noutsourcing of infrastructure to the private sector has the potential to be an important response \nto these problems, requiring further rethinking of the division of responsibilities between the \npublic and private sectors. \n \n10.  All  expenditure  decisions  face  the  need  to  establish  realistic  standards  of  services \nacross  the country.  Improvements  in  services on  the  outer  islands  inevitably  come  at  the \nexpense of improvements on Rarotonga and Aitutaki, thereby accentuating the gap between \nthese centers\u2019 standards and those of New Zealand, to which people appear to aspire. The \nbigger the gap between Cook Islands and New Zealand standards, the larger the population \noutflow, which imposes its own costs on the country.  \n \n11.  Other measures that could support accountability and transparency include (i) making \nbudget documents more readable; (ii) publicly releasing the reports of the independent budget \ncommittee; (iii) reducing the use of payments on behalf of the Crown; (iv) adopting codes of \nconduct for members of Parliament, civil servants, and officers of the public enterprises; and \n(v) imposing tighter controls on public enterprises and the appointment of ministry heads to curb \na tendency toward politicization. \n ", "  Appendix 5  47\nC.  Complementary Improvements in Governance \n12.  The quality of governance remains one of the main risks to continued development and \nan area warranting renewed efforts. A key consideration is the absence of action to advance \nconstitutional  reform.  A  review  of  the  Constitution  was  released  in  1998,  but  few \nrecommendations were implemented. There have been frequent changes of government, and \nthe  associated  political  instability  and  uncertainty  has  probably  undermined  the  quality  of \ngovernment  with  follow-on  effects  on  emigration  and  economic  growth.  Political  patronage \nremains an ongoing risk that has been exaggerated by the (i) weaknesses in the parliamentary \nsystem, (ii) the ability of ministers of the Crown to act outside the accountability framework, \n(iii) the absence of a clear planning framework to guide the use of public funds, and (iv) gaps in \nperformance management under the budget process. \n \n13.  A key component of reforms in the mid-1990s was to be the transfer of formal authority \nto make and implement decisions from the center to the periphery. At the time, and for several \nyears  thereafter,  this  transfer  was  considered  critical  for  the  sustainability  of  the  country. \nSpecifically,  the  Government  was  to  devolve  some  key  resource  management  and  public \nadministrative control to island councils, and to provide a fully functional and effective form of \nself-government  for  each  island,  provided  with  clear  and  open  lines  of  responsibility  and \ncommunications with the restructured central Government on Rarotonga. The actual extent of \ndevolution fell short of this intention. Lacking the support of a clear policy framework, devolution \noutpaced the development of local capacity from a low base, with the result that the devolution \nthat did occur has largely been reversed. The balance of power between central and island \ngovernments  probably  has  a  significant  effect  on  the  quality  of  island  services.  Although \ndevolution is a difficult area for making progress, there is value in revisiting these issues and \nseeking a sustainable approach. \nD.  Anticorruption Measures \n14.  The Cook Islands has extensive legislation in place to prevent or address corruption. \nThis is backed by supportive institutional arrangements for implementation and oversight. This \nsystem provides an example to other Pacific island countries, showing what can be achieved in \na  small  economy.  Cook  Islands  expressed  its  commitment  to  anticorruption  measures  by \nendorsing the Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific of ADB and the Organization for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development in 2001.  \n \n15.  At the same time, Transparency International\u2019s 2004 study of national integrity systems \nin the Cook Islands2 found that, in practice, governance is heavily influenced by the traditional \npractice of respect for elders and leaders, which leads to a reluctance to question their actions. \nThere  appeared  to  be  an  acceptance  that  people  who  misuse,  for  private  benefit,  power \nentrusted to them would not be punished. The problem is exacerbated by the inadequate \ncapacity of the police force and Crown Law office, which means a backlog of pending cases \ncannot  be  prosecuted.  Transparency  International  has  called  for  the  establishment  of  an \nindependent commission on corruption in the Cook Islands to expose and minimize corruption in \nthe public sector and to educate the community on corruption. \n \n16.  Overall, the judicial system has a reputation for being transparent and competent, with \njudges (usually from New Zealand) who are of high caliber and independent, and free from \n                                                 \n2  Transparency International. 2004.

Of growing concern, however, is the increasing \nuse of justices of the peace to sit on criminal and land cases in an effort to reduce costs. This is \nof concern because the justices of the peace are purportedly appointed by the Government \nwithout attention to merit and do not necessarily have relevant qualifications or experience. \n \n17.  The PERCA Act was introduced in July 1996 to help ensure financial management \noversight and improve accountability and transparency. As a result of this legislation, the current \nAudit  Office  was  established  and  given  responsibility  for  external  audits.  The  Audit  Office \nfunctions as a safeguard to maintain the financial integrity of the country\u2019s parliamentary system \nof government. It has effective policies and investigative skills, and the standard of auditing has \nimproved in recent years. \n \n18.  The Cook Islands\u2019 audits of ministries and statutory authorities are mostly completed \nwithin 12 months of the end of the financial year\u2014some outsourcing their accounting, and thus \nadvancing the pace of account preparations\u2014and the number of audit qualifications is steadily \nreducing. Ministries are also recognized as being responsive to the qualifications. The Crown \nconsolidation takes longer (around 24 months from the end of the financial year), as it is reliant \non all ministries and statutory authorities\u2019 accounts being audited first. The PERCA Act requires \nthe use of an audit adviser, a role taken on by Ernst & Young. The strengthening of audit \ncapacity is an iterative process, with the recent adoption of a new software system showing \nproductivity gains in the Audit Office\u2019s operations. Issues highlighted by PERCA have resulted in \ncharges being laid against individuals. \n \n19.  The public service is governed by both the Public Service Act and a code of conduct for \nthe  public service  and  senior  executives.  Merit-based  selection  and  promotion  and  ethical \nstandards are commonly applied and public servants are generally competent. Some serious \nchallenges  remain,  however.  For  example,  management  is  now  supposedly  performance \nbased, but the Public Service Commission lacks the capacity to measure the performance of \nany staff other than heads of agencies at line ministries. Corruption and political nepotism exist, \nwith criminal prosecutions of senior public servants in recent years.  \n \n20.  The Cook Islands is increasingly receptive to transparency in information and decision \nmaking.  One  innovative  mechanism  used  is  the  budget  committee,  which  involves  parties \nexternal to the public sector to analyze agency budgets and performance. The reports of the \nbudget committee have considerable standing in the cabinet\u2019s final decision making. An Official \nInformation Act has recently been put in place and is overseen by the ombudsman\u2019s office. \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  49\nANALYSIS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR \nA.  Infrastructure in the National Sustainable Development Plan \n1.  The Cook Islands Government recognized that the mid-1990s reform process, the need \nfor fiscal consolidation, and too-frequent changes in government composition resulted in too \nlittle attention being paid to medium- and long-term development goals.1 To help refocus, the \nGovernment embarked on the preparation of a policy formation and broad consultative process \naimed at preparing the nation\u2019s second development plan. In 2007, the Government adopted Te \nKaveinga Nui, the National Sustainable Development Plan 2007\u20132010 (NSDP).2  \n \n2.  The NSDP established a national vision \u201cto enjoy the highest quality of life consistent \nwith  the  aspirations  of  our  people,  and  in  harmony  with  our  culture  and  environment.\u201d \nInfrastructure is prominent in the third of the NSDP\u2019s five strategic outcomes: \nStrategic Outcome 3: Sustainable Economic Growth in Harmony with our Social Values, \nCulture and Environment \nWe envisage that by 2020, our largely private sector-led GDP will reach $0.6 billion \nbased on sustainable development principles.  \nWe envisage that by 2020, all islands will have achieved the minimum standards set \nfor basic infrastructure, transport and utilities to support their economic development.  \nWe envisage by 2020, there will be a more equitable distribution of the benefits of \neconomic growth across all islands. \n \n3.  Infrastructure is at the core of the fifth of the NSDP\u2019s eight strategic goals: \u201ca strong \nbasic infrastructure base to support national development.\u201d Improved infrastructure for water \nsupply and waste disposal is also recognized by the NSDP as crucial to achievement of the \nfourth goal of \u201csustainable use and management of our environment and natural resources.\u201d  \n \n4.  Recent Asian Development Bank (ADB) studies have involved comprehensive reviews \nof the legislative, institutional, and regulatory frameworks for infrastructure operating within the \nCook Islands.3 The studies show, almost without exception, that recommendations of previous \nstudies aimed at improving the efficiency of project implementation and service delivery have \nnot been adopted, or have been acted on in a limited manner. In a number of instances, \nimprovements under the respective project initiatives have faltered through a combination of \ninadequate  human  and  financial  resources  for  subsequent  operation  and  maintenance. \nCommitments to cost recovery or \u201cuser pay\u201d have also faltered and tended to fall by the wayside \nfor a number of reasons, including inadequate local resources, inadequate technical assistance \n(TA) support and continuity, an absence of political conviction, and concerted public opposition \n(the latter due in part to limited public awareness and engagement). \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

These observations convey an important message for the implementation of the NSDP. \nThere  is  a  need  for  a  renewed  legislative,  institutional,  and  regulatory  framework  that  is \n(i) attuned to the political environment of the Cook Islands, (ii) culturally acceptable to the \ncommunity, and (iii) capable of being implemented with the available human and financial \nresources. \nB.  Agency Responsibilities \n6.  Responsibility for infrastructure planning, provision, and regulation rests with several line \nministries and government agencies. The roles and responsibilities are fragmented and vital \nskills are dispersed among the agencies. Responsibilities in some instances are unclear and are \nassumed and acted on in default by the agencies with the legal responsibility. A general lack of \naccountability for performance coupled with a critical shortage of resources and skills has meant \nthat planning, the development of policy, and forward budgeting and operational programming \nwithin the agencies has been below that required to implement the NSDP. \n \n7.  The reforms of the mid-1990s included the placement of the financially sustainable \npublic enterprises under the oversight of the Cook Islands Investment Corporation (CIIC). This \nincluded the provision of electricity to Rarotonga and the operation of international airports and \nharbors  for  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  Significant  decentralization  of  functions  to  island \nadministrations  occurred  alongside  the  restructuring  and  downsizing  of  the  public  service. \nDifficulties with capacity have resulted in the recentralization of education and health services \nexcept for Palmerston Island, for which all government services are fully devolved. \n \n8.  The government reforms of the mid-1990s were also significant in passing responsibility \nfor the management, operation, and maintenance of all island infrastructure into the hands of \nthe  island  administrations.  A  lack  of  technical  capacity,  funding,  and  regular  maintenance \nresulted in deteriorating outer-island services, a situation that remains a matter of concern.4 The \nOffice of the Minister of Island Administration has adopted the role of facilitating the devolution \nprocess from the central government to the outer islands. It provides support and advice to the \nisland administrations on governance, financial management, infrastructure development, and \noperation and maintenance. \n \n9.  The Office of the Minister of Island Administration continues to provide facilitation and \nsupport services. Following reform, the office assumed a large measure of responsibility for the \npreparation of financial statements for island administrations, but it has now withdrawn from this \ninvolvement. The agency has a full-time architect on its staff, and since August 2007 a full-time \ncivil engineer; together they provide most technical services within the agency.  \n \n10.  The in-house technical capacity allows the Office of the Minister of Island Administration \nto be directly involved in advice and assistance for outer-island infrastructure. The office has \nalso  overhauled  electrical  generators  for  the  island  administrations  (with  the  exception  of \nAitutaki) at its workshop in the Ministry of Works (MOW) and contracted out the repairs of heavy \nequipment. MOW and the Rarotonga power supplier (Te Aponga Uira) have been called upon to \nprovide support to the island administrations on a fee-for-service basis. The degree of support \nprovided is not, however, clear and may have been minor.

Private Sector Participation \n11.  Consultations during the preparation of the 2007 Preventive Infrastructure Master Plan \nrevealed a widely held belief in both government and civil society that private sector involvement \nshould  be  maximized.  Private  sector  participation  in  the  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure would be seen as having the potential to increase efficiency and \nlead to more sustainable levels of service. Some services provided by government agencies \nwere subsequently placed with private contractors. Services such as the collection of household \nrefuse, trenching for cables, and trenching for water mains on Rarotonga have been contracted \nout without noticeable adverse impact. This offers the benefit of allowing the Government to \navoid the need for reinvestment in plant and equipment for these activities. \n \n12.  Consultation showed a rising acceptance of the value of confining the Government\u2019s role \nin infrastructure to (i) conducting strategic planning and setting policy; (ii) determining affordable \nservice  levels  in  consultation  with  users  of  the  service;  (iii)  establishing  programs  for \ninfrastructure maintenance and operations; and (iv) providing appropriate levels of funding, with \nan increased private sector involvement in service delivery and infrastructure construction and \nmaintenance.  \n \n13.  Devolution of service delivery and the provision of infrastructure will require a clear \ndefinition of the role of the government agencies as the managers of the Crown\u2019s infrastructure \nassets. It will also require new skills and capacity in asset management and the development of \ngeneral conditions of contract, contract documentation, and specifications for the contracting of \nthe service delivery on an outcome-based approach. Transparent and appropriate competitive \npricing procedures will also be required to run alongside the Government\u2019s procurement and \ntendering requirements outlined in its proposed Financial Policies and Procedures Manual. \nLocal contractors will need assistance and training to develop familiarity with and skills for the \nnew  procurement  and  bidding  processes.  Coupled  with  this  will  be  the  need  to  develop \ncontractor  understanding  of  contractual  obligations,  responsibilities,  and  liabilities  for \nperformance-based contract works. \nD.  Infrastructure Ownership \n14.  The Cook Islands Act of 1915 and the amendment acts of 1965 and 1966 provide that \nany road in the Cook Islands vested before or after the act shall not as such vest in the Crown, \nbut  shall  belong  in  accordance  with  common  law  to  the  adjoining  owners,  if  no  public \nright-of-way exists. Referring to the formation of the roads, section 609 of the act then states \nthat all roads in the Cook Islands may be formed, maintained, and repaired by the Crown, and \nshall be deemed to be in the possession of the Crown. \n \n15.  MOW  was  established  originally  as  the  Ministry  of  Supportive  Services  under  the \nSupportive Services Act of 1974 and later renamed under the Public Service Identification of \nDepartments Order of 2000. The Supportive Services Act empowered the ministry to provide, \nconstruct, and maintain roads; and to establish, provide, and maintain an adequate water supply \nand reticulation service in all the islands. These roles have been limited to Rarotonga following \nthe devolution of responsibilities to the outer islands. MOW also has the right to maintain \nforeshores (defined as a 30-meter-wide strip of land extending along and abutting the mean \n ", "52   Appendix 6 \nhigh water mark). The Rarotonga Waterworks Ordinance of 1960 and the acts and amendments \nto which it relates provide for the establishment, maintenance, and control of waterworks on the \nisland. It prescribes powers for the minister, subject to the provisions of the ordinance to \nconstruct,  extend,  improve,  and  maintain  waterworks.  In  2008,  in  accordance  with  the \nInfrastructure Governance Framework, MOW was merged with the Office of the Minister of \nIsland Administration to form the Ministry of Infrastructure and Planning.  \n \n16.  The  CIIC,  established  under  the  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  Act  of  1998 \nadministers  Crown  assets  and  shareholding  interests  and  supervises  the  undertakings  of \nstatutory  corporations.  It  has  assumed  responsibility  for  the  interests  of  the  Cook  Islands \nGovernment Property Corporation. CIIC has a board of three members appointed by its minister \nwith the concurrence of the cabinet, and a chief executive officer appointed by the board. The \nCIIC\u2019s responsibilities cover Te Aponga Uira, the Cook Islands Ports Authority, the Cook Islands \nAirport Authority, and the Cook Islands Government Property Corporation and its subsidiaries. \nThe corporation has responsibility for Crown assets, including infrastructure assets. \n \n17.  CIIC is therefore the trustee of the Crown assets with responsibility for protecting the \nCrown\u2019s investment in public infrastructure. Asset ownership is relevant to any requirement for \nasset management plans, and the responsibility for overseeing the plans prepared by the asset \nmanagers in the infrastructure agencies, and for ensuring the plans remain meaningful and \ncurrent. \n \n18.  The CIIC has an office staff of around 12 persons, and a mobile maintenance unit of \naround eight staff comprising a foreman and maintenance crew. The organization structure has \nfour sections: (i) administration, (ii) property management, (iii) finance, and (iv) legal and lands. \nThe property management section handles maintenance and improvements in all government \nproperty together with the project management of all works and projects. These include the new \nindoor sports stadium being built and funded by the People\u2019s Republic of China, which CIIC was \nrequired to have ready for the South Pacific Mini Games of September 2009.  \n \n19.  The maintenance of government property appears to be a reaction to observed need. \nThere is a database for property and buildings collated in 1997, which has been added to by the \nproperty department of CIIC, but the information is now out of date and all information needed \nfor the development of meaningful maintenance and rehabilitation programs cannot be retrieved \nconveniently,  although  the  discussions  confirmed  steps  to  rectify  this  position  through  the \ndevelopment  of  an  up-to-date  information  system  for  property,  most  likely  in  geographic \ninformation system format. The system is being developed in-house as far as the present \nworkload allows.  \nE.  Legislation and Regulations \n20.  The Cook Islands Parliament is the sole lawmaking authority for the Cook Islands, with \nNew Zealand continuing as a major source of reference for new enactments. Cook Island \nlegislators and law draftspersons are now increasingly looking further afield in the region for \nprecedents more applicable to the Cook Islands conditions and acceptability. Because of the \nshortage of legal drafting skills within Crown Law and in government, draft legislation is often \nprepared by overseas experts who import ideas and approaches that are sometimes difficult to \nimplement locally and are not cognizant of local ways, conditions, and regulatory capacity. Many \ndrafts remain unapproved for long periods of time, or at best require considerable effort locally \nand many discussions and new drafts to bring local acceptance. \n ", "  Appendix 6  53\n  \n21.  The lesson to be taken is that development of legislation and regulations needs to allow \nsufficient time for the progressive refinement of drafts and for the considered review of local \nstakeholders, which could take considerable time. \nF.  Land \n22.  Land issues are central to the infrastructure sector and are potentially the most costly \nconstraint. CIIC has cited problems where existing leases for government-occupied buildings in \nthe Avarua area have expired or are due to expire, and where the landowners have advised that \nthey are not amenable to extending the leases. Planned improvements and extensions of roads, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  airports  will  depend  on  the  Government  reaching  mutually \nagreeable arrangements with landowners. All water sources, reticulated power and networks, \nand the major portion of the road networks are on privately owned land. \nG.  User Pay and Cost Recovery \n23.  While people accept paying for electricity and telecommunications, there is historical and \ncultural resistance in the Cook Islands to the charging of fees for services such as water supply, \nsanitation, and solid waste disposal. Projects for improvement in these services will involve \nsignificant capital and operating investment and will require financial and economic justification \nfor this investment. For water, demand management will assume increasing importance for the \nsustainable management of a finite resource in the face of global climate change and the need \nfor contingency planning. \n \n24.  Direct  payment  for  water  will  inevitably  become  part  of  the  demand  management \nstrategies. At present, reference is made to water being \u201cfree.\u201d This is far from the case as the \ncosts are met through government revenues including personal taxation and is \u201cpaid\u201d indirectly \nby the consumer. Over time, the costs are likely to become too high for the Government to bear \nwhile meeting its broader obligations within budget realities. The risk under these circumstances \nis the underfunding of the activity as the Government juggles other priorities and demands. \nThere are indications of this at the present time.  \n \n25.  Transparent costing of water and the direct charging of consumers enables consumers \nto identify costs and relate these to the level of service and standards of the supply provided, \nthereby empowering the consumer and water user groups with information that will allow them \nto advocate directly with the supply agency for service levels matching their expectations and \nwillingness to pay. The Government needs to develop strategies for the recovery of the costs of \nservices and show how this will be achieved. \n ", "54   Appendix 7 \nGOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR1 \nA.  The Need for Improved Governance \n1.  Many infrastructure services in the Cook Islands have been corporatized or are provided \nby private companies. The exceptions are water supply, solid waste, roads, and electricity \nsupply in the outer islands, which are provided by divisions of the Ministry of Infrastructure and \nPlanning (MOIP). Corporatized public enterprises that provide infrastructure services include the \nCook Islands Airport Authority, the Cook Islands Ports Authority, Telecom Cook Islands, and the \nRarotonga power supplier (Te Aponga Uira). MFEM has taken an active role in overseeing \nMOIP\u2019s infrastructure line departments, by setting key performance targets in each sector, \nmaking  provision  for  maintenance  expenditures,  and  monitoring  performance.  MFEM  also \nadministers procurement. \n \n2.  The  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation  (CIIC)  provides  oversight  of  the  public \nenterprises, regulates tariffs, and monitors performance. However, it lacks the staff and budget \nneeded to effectively fill this function, and often can do little more than rubber-stamp the board \ndecisions of the respective entities. The CIIC has fewer than 20 staff, most of whom are \ninvolved in repairs and maintenance in the property division, but is responsible for oversight of \naviation, marine transport, telecommunications, and urban electricity in the Cook Islands. The \ncapacity of the CIIC needs to be expanded through selective recruitment and on-the-job training \nand possibly \u201ctwinning\u201d arrangements with overseas counterparts. \n \n3.  Responsibility for infrastructure planning, provision, and regulation rests with several line \nministries  and  public  enterprises  that  suffer  from  capacity  constraints.  The  institutional \narrangements are fragmented and overlapping, and there has been a lack of coordination. This \nhas reduced the effectiveness of management regimes and ownership of policies. Most sectors \nlacks the clear sector policy statements needed to integrate and harmonize each sector\u2019s \noutputs and management with the National Sustainable Development Plan 2007\u20132010 (NSDP). \n \n4.  The  legal  framework  for  infrastructure  needs  strengthening.  Laws  are  required  to \nestablish  the  roles  and  functions of  the  new  agencies  that  are  needed.  The draft  Islands \nGovernment Bill and the Ministry of Islands Development Bill 2002\u2014both currently stalled\u2014\nneed to be updated to take account of sector reforms and then enacted to legitimize activities \nand expenditure on the outer islands. The Rarotonga Water Supply Ordinance of 1960 needs to \nbe updated to establish minimum drinking water standards. Economic regulation practices are \noutdated and could be tailored to better suit the Cook Islands\u2019 new economic structure and \nneeds. \n \n5.  The  performance  of  the  public  enterprises  is  clouded  by  their  often  unwritten,  but \nnevertheless  real  obligation,  to  meet  the  Government\u2019s  social  objectives  (for  example,  by \nproviding services that are not commercially viable or charging less than the cost of supply, \nwithout transparent compensation from the Government). A general statement spelling out the \nGovernment\u2019s policy with regard to community service obligations would help service providers \nplan  operations  and  set  budgets.  Such  social  obligations  should  be  embodied  in  a  policy \nstatement that is clear to everyone, costed, and explicitly subsidized by the Government as \ncommunity service obligations. This will increase accountability and transparency, and better \n                                                 \n1  The analysis of this appendix draws on ADB. 2007.

The \nsame considerations apply to those line ministries providing infrastructure services. \n \n6.  Asset performance needs to be optimized through the introduction of proper procedures \nand  simplified  plans  for  asset  management  within  the  capacity  and  resources  available. \nWarranted  actions  include  the  adoption  of  monitored  asset  management  plans  for  all \ngovernment assets under consistent criteria, their routine auditing by the Cook Islands Audit \nOffice, and long-term planning and budgeting for maintenance and rehabilitation as required \nwith practical performance indicators. \n \n7.  Further issues to be faced in developing infrastructure include the process of selecting \npublic works and a low rate of cost recovery on public services. The competitive outsourcing of \ninfrastructure works to the private sector has the potential to be an important response to these \nproblems, requiring a further rethinking of the division of responsibilities between the public and \nprivate sectors. \nB.  Roles and Responsibilities \n8.  The  Government,  acting  through  the  cabinet,  has  overall  responsibility  for  the \nInfrastructure  Governance  Framework  (IGF).  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic \nManagement (MFEM) has the role of assessing the financial and economic implications of \npolicies and programs prepared by line agencies. The aid management division within MFEM \nhas  had  an  important  role  in  infrastructure  development  because  of  the  high  levels  of \ninternational and bilateral assistance to the sector. However, the assumption of an infrastructure \ndevelopment role by the division and its attempts to direct the line agencies have given rise to \ninstitutional rivalries and resource mismatches, which the IGF is in part designed to correct.  \n \n9.  The  present  arrangement  is  for  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  to  have  overall \nresponsibility for approving and putting into effect the infrastructure development program of the \nGovernment, and therefore for implementing the IGF and for advising the Government on \nprogress and any required supportive or corrective actions. In future, the IGF envisages that \nMOIP will report directly to the cabinet through its minister, with the Office of the Prime Minister \nproviding  an  external  check  on  its  performance.  The  National  Sustainable  Development \nCommission (NSDC), which reports directly to the cabinet, has responsibility for reviewing all \npotential infrastructure projects, including those falling within the IGF, and aligning them with the \npriorities in the NSDP. The CIIC infrastructure committee reports to the Office of the Prime \nMinister and is responsible for (i) taking the projects reviewed by the NSDC; (ii) initiating and \nmonitoring their detailed planning, feasibility assessment, and development by the responsible \nline  agencies  and  government-owned  enterprises;  and  (iii) agreeing  on  investment  project \nprioritization  and  funding  priority  for  the  Government\u2019s  endorsement.  However,  while  this \ndescribes the general expectations of how the NSDC and CIIC infrastructure committee should \noperate and interact, the functions and responsibilities of each agency are yet to be formally \ndocumented and ratified by the Government. In practice, the CIIC infrastructure committee \ncurrently identifies short-term projects and assesses priorities, while the NSDC operates on a \nlonger-term horizon.  \n \n10.  Below the Office of the Prime Minister and the CIIC infrastructure committee, the newly \nformed MOIP is the key line department responsible for the planning, implementation, and \n ", "56   Appendix 7 \nmanagement  of  infrastructure  assets  held  directly  by  the  Government.2  The  Cook  Islands \nInvestment  Corporation  has  a  coordinating  role  for  those  infrastructure  sector  agencies \noperating as public enterprises and as government statutory authorities, such as the Cook \nIslands  Ports  Authority,  the  Cook  Islands  Airport  Authority,  and  Te  Aponga  Uira,  the \nstate-owned power supply company for Rarotonga.  \nC.  Progress on the IGF \n11.  The establishment of the NSDC and of the CIIC infrastructure committee were key \ninitiating actions for the IGF. A third was the creation of MOIP in mid-2008 through the merger of \nthe  functions  of  the  Ministry  of  Works  (MOW)  and  the  Office  of  the  Minister  of  Island \nAdministration. While the public enterprises and statutory authorities have organizational and \nlegal structures that provide for a degree of independence and require a commercial approach \nto their areas of responsibility, and these agencies have had some operating experience, the \nMOIP  is  new  and  only  partially  integrated  from  its  precursors,  operates  as  a  traditional \ngovernment department, and will require a greater degree of internal change and capacity \nbuilding before it is able to implement the IGF in its sectors of responsibility. This support is an \nimportant element of an ADB TA.3 \nD.  Actions for Implementing the IGF \n1.  Institutional Reforms and Capacity Development \n12.  Interagency Relationships. The respective functions and relationships between the \ncabinet, the Office of the Prime Minister, MFEM, NSDC, the CIIC infrastructure committee, \nMOIP, the Audit Office, the Public Services Commission, the proposed Cook Islands Water \nSupply  and  Sanitation  Board  (CIWSSB),  and  the  existing  public  enterprises  and  statutory \nauthorities have been proposed. These will be confirmed, modified as necessary, and endorsed \nby the cabinet to form a firm basis for developing the institutional reforms, particularly the MOIP \nand the infrastructure advisory and approval role of the Office of the Prime Minister.  \n \n13.  Ministry of Infrastructure and Planning. While MOIP has been created from the MOW \nand the Office of the Minister of Island Administration, its internal management and staffing \nstructure, functional responsibilities and business planning processes require clear definition. \nCurrently, it has an acting head, and a review of heads of ministry positions is due to take place \nin mid-2009. This will require a degree of staff movement, with people leaving the ministry, \nchanging roles, and new recruitment. Position descriptions and ratification through the PSC will \nbe required. This change management process is expected to take 2 years, commencing with \npreparation of a detailed implementation plan for the future of MOIP, followed by a change \nmanagement  plan  for  the  staffing  structure,  positions  and  associated  legal  process,  then \nfollowed by implementation. \n \n14.  Water Supply and Sanitation. The formation of a self-accounting business unit within \nMOIP, responsible for water supply and sanitation (CIWSSB), operating on a \u201cuser-pays\u201d cost \nrecovery basis, subject to meeting community service obligations for which it would be funded \n                                                 \n2  MOIP is responsible for roads, water supply and sanitation, solid waste, government buildings, and outer-island \nwharves and airports. \n3  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Cook Islands for Infrastructure Services Delivery Improvement. Manila. (TA \n7287-COO, approved on 19 May, $600,000). \n ", "  Appendix 7  57\nfrom government appropriation, has been recommended. Developing the institutional structure, \nfunctional responsibilities, accounting arrangements, and business planning processes for the \nCIWSSB would be a parallel action. \n \n15.  Capacity Development. Institutional capacity issues have been identified that need to \nbe  addressed  as  part  of  the  IGF.  In  part,  these  are  the  lack  of  clear  demarcation  of \nresponsibilities and accountability between and within the government central departments and \nsector line agencies. This has given rise to overlaps and gaps in infrastructure governance that \nhave in some cases been a source of friction and wasted effort. Within the agencies, there is a \nneed to formally define the roles and responsibilities attaching to management and senior \ntechnical  positions,  the  internal  lines  of  responsibility  and  reporting,  performance  review \nsystems, and matching of staff qualifications and experience with the requirements of each \nposition. This process will identify staff development needs and in some cases, the need to \nbetter match staff with positions. At lower levels, there will be a need to match the size and \ncomposition of the permanent staff to the work flow, and to decide where there is need to \nrecruit, to retrench, and to reassign staff resources, and where outsourcing is likely to be more \ncost-effective in achieving the agency objectives.  \n \n16.  A detailed implementation plan for the capacity development for each agency will result, \nincluding individual staff personal development plans, internal and external training schedules \nand  budgets.  Close  coordination  will  be  required  with  the  Office  of  the  Public  Services \nCommission  and  consideration  of  industrial  relations  and  social  impact.  Other  aspects  of \ncapacity  development  will  be  the  appropriate  design  and  functioning  of  business  support \nsystems,  including  asset  management,  financial  control,  accounting,  and  information \ntechnology. \n2.  Infrastructure Planning and Investment Programming \n17.  Sector Policy Statements. A policy statement is required for each subsector (transport, \nwater and sanitation, solid waste, and energy) that will identify (i) the subsector goals, (ii) the \nobjectives by which these goals will be met, (iii) the role of the sector stakeholders, and (iv) the \nrights  of  the  community,  including  the  community  service  obligations  to  be  funded  by \ntransparent subsidies from the Government. Subsector objectives will typically be defined as \nlevel of service provision to intermediate and end users in each subsector and target timeframes \nfor achievement. Line agencies will develop annual statements of intent for the year and report \non  achievements  linked  to  the  sector  policy  statements  and  performance  measurements \nappropriate to the subsector. \n \n18.  Tariffs,  Cost  Recovery,  and  Funding.  While  these  interrelated  issues  could  be \nincluded or summarized within the sector policy statements, they are of fundamental importance \nto  the  IGF,  are  likely  to  be  controversial,  and  should  be  set  out,  agreed  to  by  the  CIIC \ninfrastructure committee, and endorsed by the cabinet, again to form a firm basis for sector \ndevelopment. The main issues to be decided for each subsector are (i) the extent of investment \nand ongoing operational funding required to meet the service levels set out in the subsector \npolicy statements; (ii) the future funding envelope that can be identified for each subsector, \nincluding funds from user charges, annual Government appropriation, and development partner \nassistance; (iii) the principles for, and levels of charges that can be sustained, by users of the \nservices based on users\u2019 willingness to pay for service levels and other concerns such as \nenvironmental protection and sustainability; (iv) the extent and on what basis certain individuals \n ", "58   Appendix 7 \nor  groups  in  the  community  should  receive  subsidized  infrastructure  services;  and  (v)  the \ncommunity service obligations.  \n \n19.  Infrastructure  Planning  and  Prioritization.  A  consistent  and  common  process  is \ndesirable  for  identifying,  evaluating,  and  prioritizing  infrastructure  investment  across  the \ninfrastructure sector. Ideally, this process should be able to compare investments in different \nsubsectors using common principles so that investment in water supply can be compared, for \nexample, with investment in roads. However, planning and prioritization within each subsector \ncan be an interim objective. This is expected to be a development of the project identification \nand multi-criteria weight and rank scoring process developed in the IMP and currently applied \nby the CIIC infrastructure committee together with appropriate economic assessment.  \n \n20.  Investment Programming and Multi-Period Budgeting. The line agencies are moving \nfrom an annual cycle of funding requests and appropriations to multi-year budgeting with long- \n(6 to 10+ years), medium- (3\u20135 years) and short-term (annual plan) expenditure plans based \nupon marrying the prioritized project program with the forecast future funding envelope and with \nother resource constraints such as processing and implementation capacity. The line agencies\u2019 \nprocesses must be harmonized with those of Government\u2019s central fiscal planning and with \nexternal assistance. The investment cycle will involve (i) setting up rolling work programs, \n(ii) integrating the asset management program and the capital works financial forecasts, and \n(iii) making due provision for disaster risks. \n3.  Asset Management Framework \n21.  Each  line  agency  will  set  up  systems  for  managing  the  physical  assets  under  its \nresponsibility. These will be required for transport (roads, ports, airports), water and sanitation, \nsolid waste management, energy, and government buildings. The main elements of the asset \nmanagement systems that will be established are (i) asset registers and inventories; (ii) asset \ncondition and level of service inspections, ratings and reporting; (iii) market, replacement and \ndepreciated (book) asset values; (iv) asset maintenance and replacement policies; (v) asset \nmaintenance work planning, costing, implementation and monitoring; (vi) output and outcome \nperformance standards, and key performance indicator measurement and feedback. \n \n22.  The  asset  management  plans  will  conform  to  standard  templates  established  in \nconjunction with the Audit Office, which will conduct the independent annual audits. The asset \nmanagement plans will be harmonized to the absorptive capacity of the Cook Islands, and will \nbe as simple and robust as possible consistent with gathering the minimum information needed \nto perform the asset management task and recording the maintenance inputs and costs against \nitems in the asset register. The monitoring will be rigorous and continuing in the form of regular \nmonthly review and reporting of program exceptions by the line agencies, annual review and \nreporting  to  the  cabinet  to  assess  achievements  and  to align  future  programs.  An  annual \ncommunity and user satisfaction survey will form part of the monitoring.  \n4.  Legislative Review and Amendments \n23.  The  IGF  will  need  to  be  supported  by  legislative  change  in  some  areas,  and  the \ndevelopment of legal specifications, legal drafting, and passage into law will be integral with a \nnumber of the institutional, policy and financial management changes noted above.  \n ", "  Appendix 8  59\nSOCIAL AND GENDER ANALYSIS1 \nA.  Overview \n1.  Compared with residents of most developing countries, the people of the Cook Islands \nhave a high standard of living. Internationally, the Cook Islands is a high-ranking middle-income \ncountry. Life expectancy is high at 71 years, infant mortality is low at 15\u201320 per 1,000 live births, \nimmunization rates reach almost 100%, secondary school enrollment rates exceed 90%, adult \nliteracy is high, and most Millennium Development Goals have already been met or will be met \nby 2015. The Cook Islands also performs well regionally regarding gender-based indexes of \ndevelopment. \n \n2.  These achievements reflect a long history of heavy government investment in health, \neducation, and welfare buttressed by a good natural resource base and the benefits of close \nintegration with New Zealand. A substantial improvement in the quality of economic and public \nsector management since the financial crisis of the mid-1990s also underpins living standards. \nFor understandable reasons, the Cook Islands now looks to New Zealand to set its benchmarks \nfor service standards, opportunities, and incomes. \n \n3.  This level of well-being is nevertheless fragile. Small island developing states like the \nCook Islands are vulnerable to events beyond their control, particularly environmental hazards. \nFor example, in the mid-1990s the Cook Islands faced a devastating cyclone and an outbreak of \ndisease that badly affected pearl production, and in the FY2006 cyclone season, Rarotonga and \nthe southern group experienced five cyclones. Despite good living standards and achievements \nin education and health, there is little cash employment outside Rarotonga and Aitutaki. Many \nhouseholds get much of their livelihood from pensions and other social security payments, \nparticularly on the outer islands, and the lack of economic dependence is a source of fragility, as \nis the high rate of out-migration. \n \n4.  Beyond a general pattern of outer-island disadvantage, the vulnerable are the people \nwho are least able to help themselves, whose issues go unheard, and who often have special \nneeds and require extra help. The reasons given for people becoming vulnerable include the \nbreakdown in traditional family support systems, emigration, a rising cost of living, and ruinous \nsocial  and  community  obligations.  The  vulnerable  are  the  elderly,  the  unemployed,  single \nparents, children, the disabled, squatters, and victims of crime. The last two categories are by \nfar  the  smallest.  Although  there  is  currently  no  significantly  large  group  of  squatters,  the \nimpending  expiration  of  land  leases  on  Rarotonga  affects  some  outer-island  communities \nresiding there, as uncertain tenure makes repairing or upgrading housing difficult. The Cook \nIslands  has  an  effective  justice  system,  and  most  victims  of  crime  receive  some  form  of \nreparation.  \nB.  The Rarotonga\u2013Outer Island Divide \n5.  Throughout the modern history of the Cook Islands, the main line of difference in living \nstandards and the range of personal opportunities has been drawn between Rarotonga and the \nouter islands. While there have been no studies of poverty in the Cook Islands, available \nstatistics support the perception widely held within the community that the key equity issue \nremains the disparity between Rarotonga and other islands.  \n                                                 \n1  The sector diagnostics presented in this appendix draw heavily on ADB. 2008. Cook Islands 2008 Social and \nEconomic Report: Equity in Development. Manila. \n ", "60   Appendix 8 \n \n6.  The statistics report that, compared with the outer islands, fewer people in Rarotonga \nhave very low cash incomes and considerably more are in the middle-income bracket. The \naverage cash income on Rarotonga is noticeably higher than the average national income. This \noutcome is linked to education standards. Household income and expenditure surveys have \nfound that the educational level attained by the household head, rather than his or her sex or \nage, most influences the amount that a household earns or spends. A higher standard of \neducation is generally associated with higher income. The concentration of higher household \nincomes on Rarotonga is therefore linked to the concentration of more educated people there, \nas well as to the more highly paid livelihoods that they have access to. The education and \nlivelihood  disadvantage  of  outer  island  populations  is  compounded  by  their  age  and  sex \nstructures with more elderly and more women. \n \n7.  The distribution of well-being\u2015viewed subjectively or objectively\u2015is reflected in the \nmovement of people. For the past several decades, the predominant migration flow has been \nfrom the outer islands to Rarotonga, and from Rarotonga to New Zealand and beyond. This flow \nreinforces the community perception of the disadvantage faced by the outer islands. \n \n8.  The economic reform program in the mid-1990s is a key factor behind the Rarotonga\u2013\nouter  island  divide.  The  reforms  carried  with  them  a  risk  of  the  accentuating  economic \ninequalities.  The  expectation  that  the  reforms  would  foster  economic  growth  by  creating \nemployment,  increasing  government  spending  on  basic  services,  and  redistributing \nopportunities  to  poor  communities  has  proved  to  be  overoptimistic  for  most  outer-island \ncommunities. The economies of Rarotonga and Aitutaki did respond well, and there have been \nsome service improvements. But the large losses of people, skills, and paid jobs appear to have \nhastened the decline in outer-island economies. Some communities now stay alive only by \nreceiving social security payments and taking on responsibility for grandchildren.  \n \n9.  The National Sustainable Development Plan 2006\u20132010 described the Rarotonga\u2013Outer \nIsland divide in the follow terms: \u201cA fundamental development challenge is to achieve economic \ngrowth and social development that is more evenly spread across all islands and that involves \nless reliance on public service jobs and social security benefits as sources of cash income.\u201d2  \nC.  The Significance of Gender \n10.  Another general pattern of disadvantage is by gender. By regional standards, Cook \nIslands  women  score  highly  on  the  gender  development  index  and  gender  empowerment \nmeasure. Compared with Cook Islands men, they have substantially longer life expectancy \n(74.3 years, or 6.3 years longer than men) and higher secondary school enrollment. Primary \nschool enrollments and reported adult literacy rates are equal for males and females. The main \ndisadvantages for Cook Islands women are their relatively restricted opportunities for economic \nand  political  participation,  generally  lower  earning  capacity,  and  remaining  subtle  forms  of \ngender bias.  \n \n11.  The equality of men and women is recognized by the Constitution and in family law, as \nwell as by tradition in regard to the inheritance of land and rights of land use. Yet no legislation \nexplicitly prevents discrimination against women, nor are there affirmative action initiatives to \npromote equality between men and women. Despite equal opportunity for women in most \n                                                 \n2  Cook Islands Government. 2006. National Sustainable Development Plan 2006\u20132010. Office of the Prime Minister. \nRarotonga. p. 27. \n ", "  Appendix 8  61\nrespects,  the  National  Policy  on  Women  (1995)  noted:  \u201cSubtle  elements  of  discrimination \nagainst women perpetuated by culture, custom and tradition continue to exist in Cook Island \nsociety today. The continued stereotyping and confining of women\u2019s roles and responsibilities to \nthe domestic arena limits their participation in the development process.\u201d3  \n \n12.  Census data report higher employment rates for males. These data conventionally play \ndown women\u2019s work by defining a large part of their domestic activities as \u201cuneconomic,\u201d while \nmen engaged in similar activities such as village agriculture, or unemployed, are more often \ndescribed as being economically active. What is nevertheless clear is the growing participation \nof women in wage employment outside of agriculture, which, for example, rose from 38% in \n1991 to 44% in 1996 and 46% in 2001. \n \n13.  Alongside this paid work, women spend slightly more time than men caring for children \nand other family members and on such domestic chores as preparing food, cleaning house, \nshopping, and doing home repairs. Most importantly, census data show that a significant gender \ndifference remains in earnings for paid employment. More women than men are in the lowest \nincome bracket, and more men than women are in the highest-earning groups.  \n \n14.  The past decade has, however, been a period of great change. Since the mid-1990s, \nmore job opportunities have opened up for women. Although the public service has contracted, \nmore women now work at its senior levels. This change has been described as one of the \nleast-expected  outcomes  of  the  mid-1990s  reform.  Along  with  their  growing  share  of  paid \nemployment, more women now run small businesses. Areas of business activity that have \nattracted women are handicraft production, agricultural and marine products, and tourism.  \n \n15.  Not all women are doing well, however. Households headed by women suffer elevated \nrisk of having low incomes or being socially isolated, and their number is growing. Most of those \nwho receive allowances from the Social Welfare Department for destitution are single-women \nheads of households with children to support but little income. These women generally are too \nyoung for old-age benefits, and their children are too old (over the age of 10, now changed to \n12) to receive the child benefit. The destitute allowance is essentially a stopgap between social \nsecurity payments, a de facto unemployment benefit.  \nD.  The Elderly \n16.  As traditional family support systems weaken, an especially vulnerable group comprises \nelderly people living alone or supporting grandchildren. Because of the pattern of out-migration \nand the aging population, these are often elderly women, who suffer a real risk of social \nisolation, especially in more-traditional outer-island communities. As these communities have \nshrunk and aged, support systems within them have attenuated. Beyond traditional community \nties among cousins, neighbors, and church congregations, the elderly look for their principal \nmaterial  and  emotional  support  from  children  and  grandchildren,  yet  increasingly  find \nthemselves  on  the  remote  edge  of  family  networks  now  centered  on  Rarotonga  or  in \nNew Zealand. Social support can come down to finding the money for airfare or a child or \ngrandchild willing to return. That may not be enough.  \n \n17.  The geriatric ward at the Rarotonga Hospital serves as a de facto old people\u2019s home for \ninfirm elderly people who have no family to care for them. There is no other residential facility in \n                                                 \n3 Department of Women. 1995. National Policy on Women. Ministry of Internal Affairs. Rarotonga. \n ", "62   Appendix 8 \nthe Cook Islands. However a program supported by the Rotary Club and the Ministry of Health \noperates a day center for elderly people on Rarotonga. \nE.  Disabled People \n18.  Disabled people are another vulnerable group, mainly because of their limited access to \neducation and livelihood opportunities, although they do receive a special security payment. A \nsurvey in 2001 located 641 people with disabilities\u2015at 4.2% of the resident population, around \nthe expected number in any population. Only 50% of the 119 disabled children of school age \nattended school, even though attendance is supposedly compulsory.  \nF.  The Social Security System \n19.  The Cook Islands has no sizable group of very poor people. An important reason for this \nis the high level of social security allowances that Cook Islanders receive, whether they reside in \nNew Zealand or the Cook Islands. \n \n20.  The Cook Islands social security system is modeled on the New Zealand system but has \nthe important differences of being less comprehensive and providing smaller payments. In the \nCook Islands, payments are made to all children aged up to 12 years (extended from 10 years \nin July 2006) and to all people aged 60 years and above. Special payments are made to people \nbetween these ages who are infirm or destitute. One-off grants equivalent to 1 month\u2019s benefit \nare made to the families of deceased beneficiaries to help pay funeral costs. Other special \nassistance is given for improving the residences of disabled people.  \n \n21.  Unlike New Zealand, the Cook Islands offers no unemployment benefits. Cook Islanders \nwho move to New Zealand are eligible for unemployment and related benefits there and, as \nelderly  people,  can  later  bring  back  with  them  to  the  Cook  Islands  the  higher-paying \nNew Zealand  old-age  pensions.  Other  payments  received  by  some  elderly  people  include \nsuperannuation, pensions of various kinds, and life insurance payouts. \n \n22.  Almost all payments are made without any means testing (without determining need), \nand it is perhaps a misnomer to describe it as a welfare system. For example, in 2007 payments \nwere made for 1,464 elderly and 4,943 children with the only criteria being age and residency, \nwhile only 227 people receive payments for infirmities and 43 for destitution. And even funding \nfor these small groups is not according to strict needs-based definitions. For example, tiny but \nfood-rich Mauke is home to 18% of destitute cases while generally poorer Pukapuka and \nPenrhyn account, together with Manihiki, have only 2% of such cases. The infirm are mostly \n(though loosely) part of the group of true welfare recipients. The destitute generally are the \nworst off among the unemployed, being adults with no other livelihood. \n \n23.  Household income and expenditure surveys have found that social security payments \ncontribute to the incomes of most households, largely because they are untargeted. As such, \nthe system could be better described as income supplementation rather than welfare. The \nrationale for the payments is largely historical, based on the culture of egalitarian socialism that \nexisted in New Zealand during the mid-20th century, and is an institution that is politically \ndifficult to dismantle.  \n \n24.  The  Cook  Islands\u2019  social  security  system  therefore  redistributes  a  lot  of  money,  is \nexpensive, and is likely to become more so. At the same time, it does not effectively address the \nneeds of all people who are vulnerable to hardship or poverty during some stage of their life. \n ", "  Appendix 8  63\nG.   Other Support for the Disadvantaged \n25.  The  Government\u2019s  remaining  response  to  the  disadvantaged  largely  rests  on  the \nprovision of services to the outer islands and social security payments. It will be difficult to make \nfurther  substantial  progress  toward  addressing  the  present  imbalance  in  living  standards \nthrough funding alone. Funding already favors the outer islands, to the point of overfunding in \nsome cases, and the additional cost of raising outer-island service standards to those on \nRarotonga is prohibitive.  \n \n26.  However, some progress could be made by setting and meeting minimum standards of \nservices,  addressing  inequities  among  islands  in  funding  for  key  services,  and  finding  a \nmore-workable  approach  to  decentralization  that  gives  local  communities  a  greater  role  in \ndecisions  affecting  outer  islands. Most  services  are  supplied  and  managed  by  the  central \nGovernment with little community input. Communities are most concerned with the standards of \nthe services on their island but consider them something that they simply receive. Teachers \noften cite community apathy as their principal problem; this suggests that the rift goes in both \ndirections.  Other  government  services  as  well\u2015women\u2019s  affairs,  youth  and  sports,  and \nconsumer affairs\u2015now have little direct community input.  \n \n27.  In 2000, the Ministry of Education adopted its Policy for Special Education to integrate \ndisabled  children  into  normal  classrooms  wherever  possible.  A  special  education  adviser, \nappointed in 2000, trains teachers to identify and assist children with special needs, including \nthose who underperform on proficiency examinations. The only special facilities for disabled \nchildren are on Rarotonga, where the Disabled Persons Center, a nongovernment organization, \nruns a special education classroom at Avarua Primary School and the Ministry of Education \npays the salaries of the two teachers. The center provides transport for children but caters \nmainly to people in the Avarua area. Transportation to school is difficult for severely disabled \nchildren\u2014another reason why many stay home. Efforts are being made on the outer islands to \nprovide for disabled children in the schools, but these are nevertheless the children most likely \nto miss out on education. \n \n28.  Partly funded by the Ministry of Health and the New Zealand Agency for International \nDevelopment, the Creative Center on Rarotonga was established in 2000 to provide services for \ndisabled adults over the age of 16. Operating part-time, the center gives disabled people an \nopportunity to develop creative skills and life skills, to socialize, and to stimulate their learning. \nAgain, there are no such facilities in the outer islands. \n \n ", "64   Appendix 9 \nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \nNo withdrawals will be made for the following: \n \n(i)  Expenditures for goods included in the following groups or subgroups of the \nUnited Nations Standard International Trade Classification, Revision 3 (SITC, \nRev. 3) or any successor groups or subgroups under future revisions to the \nSITC, as designated by ADB by notice to the Borrower: \n \nTable A13: Ineligible Items \n \nChapter  Heading  Description of Items \n112    Alcoholic beverages \n121    Tobacco, unmanufactured; tobacco refuse \n122    Tobacco,  manufactured  (whether  or  not  containing  tobacco \nsubstitute \n525    Radioactive and associated materials \n667    Pearls, precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or worked \n718  718.7  Nuclear reactors, and parts thereof, fuel elements (cartridges), \nnon-irradiated for nuclear reactors \n728  728.43  Tobacco processing machinery \n897  897.3  Jewelry of gold, silver or platinum-group metals (except watches \nand  watch  cases)  and  goldsmiths\u2019  or  silversmiths\u2019  wares \n(including set gems) \n971    Gold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ore and concentrates) \n  Source: United Nations.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe primary objective of the Cook Islands National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) 2007\u20132010 is to build a \nsustainable future that meets economic needs without compromising prudent economic management, environmental \nintegrity, social stability and the needs of future generations. The NSDP identifies eight goals as priority areas for \nimplementation. Two of these are (i) an innovative and well-managed private-sector-led economy; and (ii) strengthened \nand affordable basic infrastructure, transport, and utilities to support national development.  \n \nBroadening of economic activity and private sector development are key strategies for improving economic growth rates \nand reducing poverty and will be supported through the program. Elements of the program will also contribute directly to \npoverty reduction through the ring-fencing of some essential services used by the vulnerable from government expenditure \ncuts and the maintenance of the real value of social welfare payments.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \nBeyond a general pattern of outer island disadvantage, the vulnerable of the Cook Islands are the people who are least \nable to help themselves, whose issues go unheard, and who often have special needs and require extra help. The reasons \ngiven for people becoming vulnerable include the breakdown in the traditional family support systems, emigration, rising \ncost of living, and ruinous social and community obligations. The vulnerable are identified as being elderly, unemployed, \nsingle parents, children, disabled, squatters, and victims of crime. \nAnother general pattern of disadvantage is by gender. The main disadvantages for Cook Islands\u2019 women are their \nrelatively restricted opportunities for economic and political participation, generally lower earning capacity, and remaining \nsubtle forms of gender bias. The continued stereotyping and confining of women\u2019s roles and responsibilities to the \ndomestic arena limits their participation in the development process. \nThere is no formal system in the Cook Islands for targeting the vulnerable other than fairly loosely through the distribution \nof social security payments. There is almost no systematic analysis of who the disadvantaged are, their needs and means \nof addressing these needs. Because of the widely held\u2015but not necessarily correct\u2015perception that good health, \neducation and living standards are well distributed in the Cook Islands and there is therefore little poverty, poverty \nreduction does not figure prominently in Government plans and policies. While there has long been an emphasis on equity \nin public policy, especially in access to basic services such as health and education, and in outer island development, \nmore could be done to raise the focus on the disadvantaged.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \nThe program provides for the provision of targeted actions to support the vulnerable members of the community. \nGovernment programs are to be explicitly reoriented to reduce social security benefits to the most well off and to use \nsavings to provide extra targeted support to the vulnerable members of the community. \n \nThere are no specific pro-poor design features of support for infrastructure. However as implementation of the IGF \nprogresses and issues such as user pays charges and community service obligations are tackled pro-poor policy positions \nare expected to be taken by Government. During implementation of the infrastructure governance framework (IGF) poverty \nanalysis will be required in relation to changes made to public sector provision of infrastructure services\u2014these may \ninclude providers of power, water, telecommunications, and banking services. This should include both analysis of impact \nof any changes (including in tariffs and service quality) on current clients and also on potential clients where access to \nservices is increased. This analysis should inform the design of community service obligations and allow better targeting of \nsafety nets to ensure the access of the poorest to basic levels of services. \n ", "Appendix 11   69\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nKey Issues. The impact of the program on the budget should provide benefits to the Cook Islands economy and the Cook \nIslands\u2019 people. The specific areas of impact will be dependent on the decisions the Government makes once a \nstrengthened policy and legislative environment is put in place and so is unable to be assessed at this point.  \nB.
