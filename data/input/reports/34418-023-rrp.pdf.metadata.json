It will address constraints on agriculture, \nfisheries,  and  livelihood  development  through  holistic  and participatory  planning,  development, \nand management of water and delivery of support services. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nWater  affects  various  aspects  of  the  livelihoods  of  the  rural  population  in  Bangladesh. \nThe  country  is  on  a  vast  floodplain  at  the  confluence  of  three  major  rivers,  and  has  faced \nsignificant  physical  challenges  including  monsoon  floods,  changes  in  river  courses  due  to \nerosion and sedimentation, water scarcity in the dry season, cyclones, and widespread arsenic \ncontamination of groundwater. The productivity of agriculture, fisheries, and associated nonfarm \nindustries  is  susceptible  to  these  water-related  issues.  More  than  80%  of  poor  people  in \nBangladesh  live  in  rural  areas  and  depend  on  agriculture  or  fisheries  for  their  livelihoods. 2 \nDespite  a  fall  in  the  share  in  the  gross  domestic  product  to  17%  in  FY2013,  agriculture  in \nBangladesh remains the largest employer, providing jobs for 48% of the population.3 Access to \nand effective management of water is essential to improved productivity and livelihoods for rural \npoor people. Water management is complicated by diverse interests among different water uses \nincluding for agriculture, fisheries, navigation, industries, and drinking water. \n \n4. \nChronic  infrastructure  deterioration  of  existing  FCDI  schemes,  especially  large-scale \nschemes,4 has impaired water management. The absence of stakeholder participation causes a \nlack  of  user  ownership,  which  is  followed  by  rapid  deterioration  of  structures,  inefficient  and \nirrelevant  planning,  and  inefficient  water  use.  Managing  critical  water  resources  through  an \nintegrated  and  participatory  approach  is  essential  for  efficient  water  management;  the \nsustainability  of  FCDI  schemes;  and  improved  livelihood  of  vulnerable  poor  people,  including \nwomen. \n \n5. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  finance  for  participatory  water \nmanagement  projects  for  small-scale  schemes  since  1995.5 The  schemes  have  demonstrated \nsuccess  in  improved  infrastructure  performance  through  beneficiary  participation.  To  extend \nintegrated  and  participatory  water  management  to  large-scale  FCDI  schemes,  in  2005  ADB \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank. 2014.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Small-Scale Water Resources Management Sector Project. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\napproved  a  $20  million  equivalent  loan  for  the  current  Southwest  Area  Integrated  Water \nResources  Planning  and  Management  Project. 6  The  project  also  included  $12.5  million  of \ncofinancing  from  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands.  The  current  project  supports  the \nestablishment  of  participatory  water  management  organizations  (WMOs)  with  the  inclusion  of \nsocially disadvantaged groups; integrated water resources management planning; infrastructure \nrenovation; and coordinated support services for WMOs in the two pilot subprojects, comprising \nthe Narail and Chenchuri Beel FCDI schemes with a total area of 57,000 hectares (ha). \n \nThe  current  project  successfully  demonstrated  that  the  participatory  approach  can \n6. \nimprove the water resources management of large FCDI schemes. This is the first success case \nfor large schemes among several trials in Bangladesh. After a slow start-up as a result of delays \ndue mainly to limited experience of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) in using \na  participatory  approach,  the  progress  of  the  current  project  has  significantly  improved  since \n2010.  Renovation of  water management  infrastructure  and improved  capacity  of WMOs  in the \ntwo targeted subproject areas has been completed with satisfactory achievement of anticipated \ntargets.  Rice  production  has  nearly  doubled  and  fish  production  has  increased  by  30%  in  the \ntwo  subproject  areas. 7  In  total,  116  WMOs,  consisting  of  102  water  management  groups \n(WMGs) and 14 higher-tier water management associations (WMAs), have been organized and \ntrained  and  are  effectively  functioning  in  the  two  subproject  areas.  A  population  of  about \n191,200  has  benefitted  from  the  project,  including  socially  disadvantaged  groups  such  as \nlandless  farmers  and  women.  Capacity  enhancement  activities  for  WMOs  are  demonstrating \nvisible  proactive  WMO  activities  in  agriculture,  fisheries,  livestock,  and  collective  livelihood \nactions.  Operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  small  structures  have  been  handed  over  to \nWMOs,  after  development  of  O&M  manuals  and  WMO  O&M  capacity.  BWDB  acquired \nknowledge  of  and  experience  in  participatory  water  resources  planning  and  management \nthrough the current project. \n \n7. \nThe  current  project  has  been  continuously  rated  on  track  since  the  second  quarter  of \n2011.  Cumulative  disbursement  had  reached  about  $20.3  million  (or  95%  of  the  total  loan \namount)8 for the ADB loan and $12.3 million (98% of the total grant amount) for the Netherlands \ngrant  as  of  31  July  2015.  The  current  project  has  been  complying  with  all  loan  covenants, \nincluding  requirements  for  environmental  and  involuntary  resettlement  safeguards  and  gender \nconsideration. \n \n8. \nThe  proposed  additional  financing  will  replicate  the  successful  current  project  in  nine \nadditional  subprojects  with  a  total  area  of  84,000  ha  and  a  population  of  about  469,500  in \nnearby  areas.  By  applying  knowledge  and  experience  acquired  from  the  current  project, \nBWDB\u2019s  institutional  capacity for  participatory  water  resources  management  is  expected  to  be \nenrooted.  Based  on  the  lessons  learned  through  the  current  project,  the  design  of  the \ninstitutional strengthening component will be further strengthened by establishment of a national \ncapacity enhancement support mechanism under BWDB to ensure sustainability of participatory \nwater resource management by WMOs. \n\n                                                \n6  ADB.  2005.

The \ndisbursed amount in dollars at $20.3 million exceeds the approved loan amount of $20.0 million because the loan \nis denominated in special drawing rights.   \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe project is in line with government and ADB strategies. Economic growth and poverty \n9. \nreduction are the main objectives of the government\u2019s Sixth Five-Year Plan, FY2011\u2013FY2015.9 \nAchieving food security is considered essential to accomplishing these objectives. Food security \nand  agricultural  productivity  are  also  part  of  ADB\u2019s  strategic  priorities  for  2014\u20132020  in  the \naction  plan  of  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.10 ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for \nBangladesh,  2011\u20132015  emphasizes  innovative  approaches  to  water  resource  management \nand  support  to  the  government\u2019s  objectives  for  rural  poverty  reduction,  food  security,  and \ngender equality.11 \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  enhanced  economic  growth  and  reduced  poverty  in \nrural  areas  of  the  selected  districts  in  the  southwest  area  of  Bangladesh,  aligned  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  FY2011\u2013FY2015.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced \nproductivity and sustainability of the selected existing FCDI systems, which could contribute to \nincreasing  incomes  and  livelihood  standards  of  disadvantaged  groups,  including  women.  The \nimpact and outcome statements are unchanged from the current project (footnote 1). \n \nC. \n \nThe  output  targets  for  the  current  project  will  be  scaled  up  by  expanding  the \n11. \ngeographical areas from the current two subprojects to include nine additional subprojects. The \nscope and targets of the additional financing outputs are summarized in paragraphs 12\u201316. \n \n12. \nOutput  1:  Water  management  organizations\u2019  capacity  for  sustainable  water \nresources planning and management in the subproject areas strengthened. The additional \nfinancing  will  cover  formation  and  capacity  development  of  WMOs  in  the  additional  nine \nsubproject areas, aiming at enrollment of 70% of farmers. Follow-up support for O&M capacity \ndevelopment  will  also  be  provided  to  the  existing  102  WMGs  and  14  WMAs  in  the  two \nsubproject areas of the current project. An integrated water management plan will be prepared \nfor each subproject area. Each plan formulates holistic water resources management planning \nand  safeguard  assessments  for  the  subproject,  following  intensive  participatory  analyses  of \nlocal  conditions  and  needs.  Each  subproject  will  be  divided  into  hydrological  subunits.  WMAs \nwill  be  formed  that  will  manage  each  subunit  and  lower-tier WMGs.  A  subunit  implementation \nplan  (SIP)  will  be  prepared  for  each  subunit.  The  plan  will  include  specific  requirements  for \nrenovation or construction of water management infrastructure, and capacity development and \nlivelihood support programs for WMOs. \n \n13. \nSubsequent to the preparation of SIPs, the project will support the WMOs to implement \nthe  institutional  development  plan  specified  in  the  SIPs,  including  (i)  capacity  development \ntraining  of  executive  committees  and subgroups  under WMOs,  (ii)  development  of  operational \nrules,  (iii)  registration,  and  (iv)  establishment  of  a  fee  collection  system  for  O&M  services  and \nother WMO activities. The project will also support skills development of WMOs for efficient use \nof  water  management  infrastructure  to  improve  the  productivity  of  agriculture  and  fisheries \nactivities,  and  for  ensuring  attention  is  given  to  all  aspects  of  water  resource  management \nrelated  to  gender  and  social  inclusion.  The  support  will  be  linked  to  other  income-generating \n                                                \n9  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Planning  Commission.  2011.

Four new subproject management offices will be \nestablished to cover the subproject areas. The existing project steering committee will continue \nto  undertake  central  interministerial  coordination.  A  national  technical  coordination  committee \nwill be formed for timely interdepartmental coordination for practical technical aspects.

Minor  water  management  structures  of  existing  FCDI  schemes  such  as  flood \nembankments,  water  retention  structures,  piped  drainage  culverts,  and  small  drainage  canals \nwill  be  renovated  and  constructed.  These  types  of  physical  works  have  already  been \nundertaken  under  the  current  project  and  their  technical  soundness  verified.  The  project  will \ncontinue  to  ensure  sustainability  of  water  management  structures  through  beneficiary \nparticipation  in  planning  and  construction,  and  capacity  development  of  beneficiary  groups  for \noperation of WMOs and O&M of structures. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nEconomic and financial analyses indicate that each subproject and the entire project are \nboth economically viable and financially sustainable. Benefits of the project will be derived from \nimproved agricultural and fisheries productivity. They will be achieved through reduced flooding, \ntimely  drainage  and  water  retention \nimproved  water \nmanagement, and beneficiary capacity development. The economic analysis was carried out for \neach subproject and for the entire additional scope of the project. The economic internal rate of \nreturn for each subproject area ranges between 16.3% and 26.2%, and for the entire project it is \n19.6%.  The  sensitivity  tests  and  risk  analysis  confirm  that  the  subprojects  are  consistently \nrobust. The project will remain economically viable under all sensitivity test scenarios. There will \nalso  be  nonquantifiable and intangible  benefits  as  a  result  of  training  and  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment of local people, such as women\u2019s participation in community activities, longer-term \nintegrity of the infrastructure, and awareness raising of water users in efficient water use and the \nimportance  of  collective  actions  for  their  livelihood  improvements.  The  project  will  also \nsubstantially benefit poor people, with a poverty impact ratio of 58%. \n \n24. \nThe  project  supports  the  establishment  of  the  annual  O&M  fund  collection  system  for \nWMOs. The O&M fund collection system will also be built into the income-generating activities \nof  WMOs.  The  fund  will  cover  the  costs  of  minor  O&M  to  be  undertaken  by  WMOs,  while \nBWDB\u2019s revenue budget will cover major O&M costs, such as replacement of gates. Capacity \ndevelopment programs will be designed to ensure financial sustainability of WMOs. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThe  financial  and  procurement  management  capacity  of  BWDB  was  assessed  in  2015 \n(footnote 17) and confirmed to be generally sound. The government\u2019s midterm review and the \nperformance assessment of the current project concluded that BWDB\u2019s institutional capacity as \nthe  executing  agency  is  satisfactory  (footnote  7).  The  government\u2019s  draft  project  completion \nreport of the current project reached the same conclusion, and assessed that the current project \nhas  contributed  to  strengthened  capacity  of  BWDB.  The  overall  risk  is  rated  moderate.  The \nproject  has  set  clear  input  and  output  targets  to  ensure  good  governance.  Risk  management \nmeasures  have  been  identified  and  incorporated  in  the  project  design  and  risk  management \nplan (para. 35). \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BWDB.

Despite  recent  good  progress,  Bangladesh\u2019s \neconomic situation remains difficult, with an annual per capita gross national income of $1,010 \n(in 2013) and with 31.5% of its population living below poverty line.18 About 80% of poor people \nreside  in  rural  areas,  and  most  of  them  are  engaged  in  agriculture,  related  nonfarm  activities, \nand  fisheries.  Sampling  surveys  identified  that  the  proportion  of  the  population  in  the  project \narea living below the poverty line is estimated at 41%\u201347%, significantly higher than the national \nfigure.  The  project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  for  about  220,000  people  below  the \npoverty line by accelerating agricultural and rural growth through efficient water use. \n \nThe  project  will  continue  to  be  implemented  with  high  participation  of  stakeholders  in \n28. \ndecision making. The empowerment of poor people and women through income-generation and \nlivelihood  improvement,  and  the  inclusion  of  socially  disadvantaged  groups  such  as  tenant \nfarmers and poor fishers, is built into the project design. The project will provide a more stable \nenvironment  with  improved  water  management  and  strengthened  livelihood  improvement \ncapacity  of  beneficiaries.  The  specific  strategy  includes (i)  pro-poor  procedures for  beneficiary \nselection  and  employment;  (ii)  inclusive  membership  access  to  WMGs;  (iii)  participation  in \nplanning,  designing, \nimplementing,  and  monitoring  water  management  structures;  and \n(iv) inclusive  capacity  development  programs  for  WMG  members  for  water  management  and \nlivelihood  improvement.  Employment  opportunities  for  civil  works,  including  minor  works  by \nlabor  construction  societies  that  include  the  socially  disadvantaged  and  women,  will  also \ncontribute to income generation of local residents. \n \n29. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  having  a  gender  equity  theme,  to sustain  and  advance  the \nprogress made in the current project that demonstrates remarkable empowerment of women. In \naddition  to  the  achievement  of  the  number  of  female  WMO  members,  the  current  project \ndemonstrates women\u2019s quality participation with enhanced decision making capacity with WMG \nexecutive  committees  having  an  average  of  33%  women,  who  hold  positions  such  as  vice-\npresident, assistant secretary, and cashier. \n \nThe  project  will  empower  women  through  (i)  participating  in  decision  making  of  WMA \n30. \nand  WMG  management  committees,  which  should  include  a  minimum  of  33%  women; \n(ii) training in agriculture, livestock, postharvest processing, fisheries production, or other water \nmanagement and livelihood improvement matters depending on the beneficiaries\u2019 practical and \nstrategic  needs;  and  (iii)  employment  opportunities  for  community  mobilization,  construction, \nand  O&M  activities.  Benefits  for  women  are  expected  to  result  in  respectful  relationships  and \ndecision-making  power  within  the  family.  The  percentage  of  women  employed  in  agriculture \nincreased from 59% in 1998 to 66% in 2008, whereas men employed in agriculture decreased \nfrom  83%  to  65%  during  the  same  period. Women  did  48%  of  agricultural  work  during  1999\u2013\n2000  and  the  rate  had  significantly  increased,  to  68%,  in  2005\u20132006. 19 This  situation  was \nattributed to migration of men from agriculture to nonfarm occupations, resulting in a change in \nthe  role  of  women  from  unpaid  family  workers  to  farm  managers  (footnote  19).

An initial environmental examination was prepared to cover \nnine  subprojects  to  be  implemented  under  the  additional  financing  project  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  It  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  with  the \nendorsement  of  BWDB.  Considering  the  nature  of  the  project  and  the  location,  the  project \nactivities  are  not  expected  to  generate  any  significant  adverse  environment  impact  that  is \nirreversible,  long  term,  or  cumulative.  The  subproject  areas  are  not  located  within  or  close  to \nany  protected  areas  or  ecologically \nimportant  areas.  The  subproject  areas  are  not \nenvironmentally sensitive. Potential environmental impacts will occur mainly during construction, \nsuch  as  dust  and  sediment  pollution  of  water,  and  are  temporary  and  reversible.  Mitigation \nmeasures  have  been  incorporated  into  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan. \nThe  potential  environmental  impacts related  to the  operation of structures  are  not  expected  to \nbe significant, because the project will renovate existing structures, except 1.5 kilometers (km) \nof a new embankment that is replacing a breached portion of an existing embankment system. \nStakeholders  to  be  affected  have  been  consulted,  and  an  existing  grievance  redress \nmechanism under the current project will be continued. The current project has been complying \nwith  environmental  safeguard  requirements.  BWDB  has  demonstrated  adequate  capacity  to \nimplement  and  monitor  the  environmental  management  plan  but  has  to  ensure  that  adequate \nstaff is available for implementation and monitoring. \n \nThe  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  rated  the  climate  risk  of  the  project  as \n32. \nmedium.  Adaptation  measures  responding to  address  this  risk  have been built  into the  project \ndesign. Resilience of the water uses against potential climate change will be enhanced through \ncapacity  development  of  WMOs  for  appropriate  operation  of  gates  and  improved  water  use \nefficiency. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  rehabilitation  and  construction  works  will \nbe located within the right-of-way of existing structures or in locations where no land acquisition \nis involved. The new 1.5 km embankment requires 2.74 ha of land acquisition consisting of 49 \nplots.  This  land  acquisition  will  affect  55  households,  of  which  45  households  comprising  183 \npeople  will  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  land.  No  structure  will  be  affected,  and  no \nhousehold  will  be  physically  displaced.  The  resettlement  plan  for  the  new  embankment  was \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, and was disclosed on the ADB website. Precise locations of the rehabilitation \nand  resectioning  of  existing  embankments  and  other  structures  will  be  determined  during  the \nadditional financing project through the beneficiary participatory planning. The locations will be \nselected  to  avoid  involuntary  resettlement  but  there  remains  a  possibility  that  involuntary \nresettlement  will  be  unavoidable.  As  a  prudent  measure,  a  resettlement  framework  was \nprepared,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  should  any  involuntary \nresettlement issue arise. BWDB has demonstrated its capacity to implement resettlement plans \nunder  the  current  project  and  to  comply  with  the  safeguard  requirements  for  involuntary \nresettlement. \n \n34. \noperational purposes by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement in the project area. \n \n \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).

Major  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 20  A \npotential shortage of BWDB O&M funds was found to be a high risk, and the overall project was \ndesigned  to  mitigate  the  risk.  Local  water  users  are  trained  in  routine  O&M  to  minimize \ndeterioration of structures and are involved in major O&M to be conducted by BWDB. Specific \nloan  covenants  are  included  to  ensure  that  the  government  provides  adequate  budget  to \nBWDB. Mitigation measures for other potential medium-to-low risks have been taken during the \nimplementation of the current project and are also built into the project design of the additional \nfinancing.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  of  the  project  are  expected  to  overweigh  the \npotential costs from the risks. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n36. \nThe government and BWDB have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.
