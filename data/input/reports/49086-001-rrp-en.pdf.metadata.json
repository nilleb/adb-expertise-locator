The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $30,000,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for \nthe  Private  Sector  in Asia II  (CFPS II),  and if  the  Board approves the  proposed  loan, I,  acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the CFPS II loan. \n \n2. \nThe loans will provide long-term financing to construct and operate a 216 megawatt (MW) \nrun-of-river  hydro  power  plant,  70  kilometers  north  of  the  main  load  center  Kathmandu.  The \nproject  will  boost  domestic  power  generation  and  help  reduce  imports  of  electricity  into  Nepal \nthrough  the  efficient  use  of  indigenous  renewable  sources,  contributing  to  Nepal\u2019s  long-term \nenergy  security,  sufficiency  and sustainability.1 Being the first major  private  sector  hydropower \ninvestment  with  long-term  international  financing  from  various  development  institutions,  the \nproject is expected to be a landmark transaction and will have a significant demonstration effect \nfor private sector participation in Nepal\u2019s energy sector. Furthermore, the project has incorporated \nseveral design features and targets to improve access to social services, economic and financial \nresources and basic rural infrastructure for women in communities near the project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \nProject identification. Nepal has suffered from a severe shortage of power and frequent \n3. \nload shedding. In fiscal year (FY) 2018, annual peak demand in Nepal was estimated to be 1,508 \nMW  but,  installed  generation  capacity  was  only  1,074  MW.2 The  total  electricity  available  during \nFY2018  was  7,058  gigawatt-hour  (GWh),  of  which  about  one-third  each  was  supplied  by  Nepal \nElectricity  Authority  (NEA),  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  and  India.  In  FY2018,  power \nimported from India totaled 2,581 GWh, an increase of 19% on FY2017. More recently, during the \nmonth of March 2019, more than 50% of daily peak demand was being met by imported electricity.3 \nWhile installed power generation capacity has grown steadily, from 706 MW in FY2011 to 1,074 \nMW in FY2018, or by an annual average of 5.4%, peak power demand during the same period \ngrew even faster, by an annual average of 7.2%, widening the supply\u2013demand gap. This gap has \nbeen partially bridged by imports from India of up to 450 MW. The remaining deficit resulted in \nregular load shedding. \n \n4. \n \n5. \nThe project is in a remote area with high socio-economic vulnerabilities, which were further \nexacerbated after the 2015 earthquake.4 Not only was physical and social infrastructure damaged \nin the 10 project area villages but, there was severe impact on the livelihood (agriculture), housing \nand living conditions of people, with at least 2 villages completely destroyed. Male outmigration \nto work as plantation and security workers is a common livelihood preference, leaving women in \ncharge  of  many  households.  Female  literacy  rate  is  lower  (47%)  as  compared  with  male \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\n                                                \n1  Government  of  Nepal.

(accessed 11 March 2019). \n4  The  total  population  of  the  3  affected  village  development  councils  is  approximately  7,000  with  sex  ratio  of  989 \n\nKathmandu. \n\nfemales per 1,000 males. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\ncounterparts  (61%).  Less  than  10%  of  women  have  legal  ownership  of  land  and  assets. 5 \nEmployment opportunities for women are extremely limited, and if they work, it is physical hard \nlabor, often on low wages, and with no social security benefits. Inadequate water and electricity \ninfrastructure and health care facilities lead to additional hardship, poor health, and hygiene for \nwomen. Instances of girl trafficking have also been reported in this area. Following ADB\u2019s Policy \non  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  NWEDC  has  incorporated  several  design  features  and \ntargets to improve access to better education and health care facilities, economic and financial \nresources  and  basic  rural  infrastructure  for  women  in  communities  near  the  project.  The \ninvestment is proposed to be categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \n6. \nProject  design.  The  project  comprises  the  design,  construction,  commissioning, \noperation  and  maintenance  of  a  216  MW  run-of-river  hydro  power  plant,  1.2  kilometers  of \ntransmission lines, and associated infrastructure on the Trishuli River. Main project components \nare a diversion weir, headrace and tailrace tunnels, vertical shaft, powerhouse, transformer yard, \nand  switchgear.  Daelim  and  Kyeryong  are  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC) \ncontractors and responsible for the construction of the project.  \n \n7. \n \n8. \nBorrower  and  sponsors.  The  borrower  is  NWEDC,  a  company  incorporated  and \nregistered as  a  private  limited  company  in  Nepal.  NWEDC  is  owned  by  KOEN  (50%),  Daelim \n(15%), Kyeryong (10%), IFC (15%), and individual owner Bkesh Pradhanang (10%). \n \n9. \nKOEN  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Korea  Electric  Power  Corporation,  which  is \nultimately majority-owned (51%) by the Government of the Republic of Korea (ROK). [Confidential \ninformation deleted.]  \n \n10. \nDaelim is the engineering and construction arm of Daelim Group, ROK and has executed \nmore than 600 projects across 36 countries since 1939. [Confidential information deleted.] It is \nlisted on the Korea Exchange and had a market capitalization of $2.92 billion as at 27 February \n2019.  \n \nKyeryong  is  an  experienced  architectural  and  civil  engineering  company,  delivering \n11. \nexpressways, railways, harbors, large-scale housing complexes, industrial parks, office buildings, \nhospitals,  and  research  facilities.

The project contributes to Nepal\u2019s energy security, sufficiency and sustainability \nby 2030 through the efficient use of indigenous energy resources;6 and will contribute to meeting \nthe target of increasing hydropower generation capacity by 12,000 MW by 2030.7 \n \n16. \nOutcome.  The  project  outcome  is  the  generation  of  1,282  GWh  of  clean  electricity \nannually to be dispatched to the national grid, and avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions equal \nto 446,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year of operation.8 There will be at least 65 jobs created \nduring the operations phase, of which 10 will be for women. The annual domestic purchase of \ngoods and services is expected to amount to more than $3.3 million during the operations phase. \n \nOutputs. The outputs will be (i) 216 MW of hydropower capacity and 1.2 km of 220 kilovolt \n17. \ntransmission lines developed and installed by the private sector, (ii) local employment generated \nby the construction of the project, (iii) economic opportunities for women improved, (iv) growth of \nthe local economy supported, and (v) awareness with respect to gender-based violence raised. \n \nC. \n \n18. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 outlines \nseven operational priorities to meet the development challenges in Asia and the Pacific today.9  \nThe project supports two of them: (i) fighting remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; and (ii) \ntackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability. Under Strategy 2030, ADB will expand and broaden its support to the private sector \nfor building critical infrastructure with strong development impacts and the project supports this. \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013-2017 for Nepal aims to help the country achieve \nhigh  and  inclusive  economic  growth  through  higher  capital  investment,  in  among  other  areas, \nenergy and transport infrastructure. The strategy calls for an increase in electricity generation to \nhelp  energy  security. 10  The  project  increases  electricity  generation  in  the  country  and  thus \ncontributes to energy security, which is consistent with this country strategy. \n \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \n20. \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which encourages interventions that promote use of renewable energy \nto slow down the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and help countries achieve energy self-\nsufficiency.11 \n \n21. \nLessons from previous operations.  The design of the project took careful consideration \nof the experience with other hydropower projects implemented in Asia. Lessons from a successful \npublic-private  partnership  project  in  hydropower  development  identified  the  involvement  of \ndevelopers with the requisite technical experience and adequate financial resources as one of \n\n                                                \n6  Government  of  Nepal.

Projects  that  included  robust \nstakeholder consultations generated strong project support particularly from communities affected \nby  these projects.14 Close  monitoring  during  project  implementation to ensure  compliance  with \nthe agreed environmental and social plans is also considered indispensable.15 \n \nD. \n \n22. \n \nE. \n \n23. \n \nF. \n \n24. \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nThe  assistance  consists  of:  (i)  a  loan  of  up  to  $30  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources; and (ii) a concessional loan from the CFPS II of up to $30 million, administered by \nADB. [Confidential information deleted.] NWEDC will be bound by commercial terms, and financial \nand operational covenants stipulated in the financing agreements. \n \nB. \n \nADB\u2019s involvement is critical because long-term financing for private sector hydropower \n26. \ngeneration projects is not available in Nepal. The project\u2019s sustainability depends on its ability to \namortize the high up-front capital costs over a long period. The repayment profiles of the ADB \nand the CFPS II loans help make the project financially viable. Being the first major private sector \nhydropower  generation  investment  with international  financing, the  project  is  expected  to be  a \nlandmark  transaction  for  IPP  development  and  ADB\u2019s  participation.  After  several  years  of \nprotracted  efforts,  the  project  will  have  a  significant  demonstration  effect  for  private  sector \nparticipation in major hydropower generation IPPs and other projects in Nepal\u2019s energy sector. \nThe project also benefits from ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and IFC performance standards \n(land  acquisition  and  livelihood  restoration  plan)  and  will  adopt  international  best  practices  in \nsafeguards  management  of  hydropower  projects  establishing  sustainable  benchmarks  for  the \nmanagement  of  cumulative  impacts,  impact  on  habitat  and  benefit  sharing  with  affected \ncommunities.  Furthermore,  ADB\u2019s  participation  helps  to  avoid,  manage  and  mitigate  negative \nsocial and environmental impacts and introduces additional measures to promote gender equity. \n\n                                                \n12 ADB.  2002.

ADB has \nundertaken  due  diligence  and  reviewed  the  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the \nproject and measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate and compensate for the adverse impacts were \nincorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  An  independent  and  qualified  consultant \nprepared a detailed environment and social impact assessment report for the project.17 \n \nEnvironment.  Key  environmental  impacts  include  (i)  permanent  loss  of  circa  (c.)  2.61 \n35. \nhectares (ha) of natural habitat and temporary use of 4.16 ha of modified habitat for the workers\u2019 \ncamp in the Langtang National Park buffer zone; (ii) reduced downstream flows and alteration of \naquatic  habitat  in  the  dewatered  stretch  of  the  Trishuli  river  (about  10.7  kilometers);  (iii) \noccupational, public health, and safety risks and impacts during construction and operation; and \n(iv) project contributions to cumulative impacts in the Trishuli River basin. The climate change risk \nassessment concluded that the risks of climate change for the project are low. The project design \nincludes a fish ladder to minimize the impact on the migration of common snow trout (Schizothorax \nrichardsonii),  a  vulnerable  fish  species.  The  environmental  flow  and  connectivity  assessment \nconcluded that 10% of the mean monthly flow would be adequate to maintain the aquatic habitat \nand  connectivity  within  the  diversion  reach.  The  environmental  and  social  assessment  report \nindicates that the project area is not a critical habitat for any species. The environment and social \nmanagement  and  mitigation  includes  framework  plans  for  dealing  with  all  the  project  impacts, \nincluding a biodiversity management plan and offsets to demonstrate \u2018no net loss\u2019.18 \n \n36. \nNWEDC  has  a  team  of  qualified  experts,  supported  by  consultants,  to  manage  the \nenvironmental and social risks and impacts of the project. This institutional capacity will be further \nstrengthened, by adding qualified resources, to ensure that management plans are implemented \nto meet lenders\u2019 requirements. NWEDC is about to engage an independent advisory panel for \nproject  preparation  and  implementation  phases.  The  company  will  also  submit  quarterly  third-\n                                                \n16 ADB.

The project footprint is spread across 10 villages in the three former \nvillage development councils of Kaku, Dhunche and Ramache. A total of about 109 ha of land is \nrequired for the project on a permanent (c. 31.29 ha) or temporary basis (c. 77.7 ha). Of these \nabout  85  ha  are  government  owned  and  the  rest  is  a  mix  of  private  (c.  8  ha)  and  \u2018guthi\u2019  land \n(monastery-owned  land  farmed  by  local  tenants,  c.  16  ha).  Land  acquisition  for  the  project \naffected 38 land plots and 36 structures (both permanent and temporary) resulting in impacts on \n154  families.  Of  the  affected  structures  which  have  been,  or  will  be,  impacted,  10  represent \nprimary  residences,  the  others  are  agricultural  buildings,  temporary  residences  used  during \ncropping season, water mills or storage buildings. The government and forest lands used by the \nproject and its ancillary facilities such as the transmission line, impact six community forest user \ngroups. Stakeholder consultations indicate that individual dependence on the community forest \nwas limited in nature. Most of these lands were acquired in 2012-2013 and a further 8 ha was \npurchased in 2018 to establish safe worker camps in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake. \n \n38. \n A  land  acquisition  and  livelihood  restoration  plan  (LALRP)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  and  IFC  performance  standards  was  developed  and  is  being \nimplemented to avoid, manage and mitigate impacts resulting from land acquisition for the project. \nThe LALRP: (i) describes the land acquisition and compensation process; (ii) identifies gaps with \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement; and (iii) outlines corresponding mitigation measures that include \na comprehensive livelihood restoration package for affected households. The LALRP reflects the \nresults of past and continuing engagement with affected families and communities in relation to \nland  acquisition,  compensation  and  physical  displacement  arrangements.  The  LALRP  will  be \nupdated and re-disclosed based on the final alignment of the transmission line. \n \n39. \nEstablishing the Upper Trishuli-1 hydropower plant results in direct impacts on the land \nand natural resources of 154 families, of whom, ethnically, more than 90 % are Tamang and less \nthan  5%  are  Gurung.  Both  ethnicities  are  recognized  under  the  Constitution  of  Nepal  as \nindigenous  nationalities,  or  Adivasi  Janajati.  Project  impacts  on  indigenous  people  include  the \nacquisition of community forest user group land and water resources for commercial development \nand the limited relocation of indigenous people families, both of which trigger broad community \nsupport (BCS) under the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n40. \nA project-specific BCS process was assessed and documented in line with the Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  Nepal  Federation  of  Indigenous  Nationalities,  Nepal\u2019s  preeminent \nindigenous peoples\u2019 organization, and an international indigenous peoples\u2019 expert were engaged \nto facilitate the BCS process on behalf of the sponsors. They mobilized the federation\u2019s Tamang \nspeaking national and district chapters to work with affected communities during the BCS process, \nwith the explicit aim of facilitating meaningful and informed consultations and collective decision-\nmaking. The BCS process and outcome, as captured in the  indigenous peoples plan provided \nevidence  (including  explicit  references  in  the  signed  consent  agreement)  that  (i)  affected \ncommunities believe that the process was conducted in a transparent manner and with disclosure \nof  relevant  information;  (ii)  meaningful  consultations  were  held  with  affected  communities;  (iii) \nrecommendations from these consultations were integrated in planning and implementation; and \n(iv) good faith negotiation between these communities formed the basis on which NWEDC and \nthe  indigenous  communities  arrived  at  a  formal  consent  agreement.  ADB  staff  met  with \nrepresentatives  of  affected  communities  on  multiple  occasions  between  2014  and  2018,  most \nrecently during the final round of BCS and consent agreement discussions between indigenous \ngroups and the company. \n \n\n\f7 \n \n\ninvestment \n\nis  proposed \n\nGender.
