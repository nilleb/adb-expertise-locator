THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Investment Climate Reforms Program, (ii) a proposed policy-\nbased loan, and (iii) a proposed policy-based grant to the Republic of Tajikistan for subprogram \n1 of the Investment Climate Reforms Program.1 \n \n2.  The program will provide budget support to help expand economic opportunities and \ndevelop the private sector. The program includes policy actions to (i) reduce the cost of doing \nbusiness, (ii) strengthen protection for businesses, and (iii) increase business innovation and \nproductivity.2 The programmatic approach will comprise three subprograms to be implemented \nduring 2015\u20132019; subprogram 2 is scheduled for 2017, and subprogram 3 for 2019. The \nconcept paper for the programmatic approach was circulated to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Board of Directors on 28 October 2014.3 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tajikistan\u2019s  transition  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market  economy  following  the \ndissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 has been one of the slowest among the Commonwealth \nof Independent States (CIS). The civil war in 1992\u20131997 eroded the country\u2019s human and \nphysical capital inherited from the Soviet Union. While growth has been robust since the end of \nthe civil war, this growth started from a low economic base and Tajikistan\u2019s output remains close \nto 1991 levels. The government has retained control over many production activities and directly \ninfluences  prices  in  several  markets.  Tajikistan\u2019s  economy  has  not  achieved  the  level  of \nstructural transformation that has taken place in other CIS countries. \n \n4.  Since 2005, Tajikistan\u2019s growth has been driven by consumption, fueled by remittance \ninflows. Limited job opportunities in Tajikistan have encouraged up to 40% of the working \npopulation (largely males) to seek jobs abroad, mostly in the Russian Federation. This has been \nfacilitated by an agreement on labor migration signed by Tajikistan and the Russian Federation \nin 2004. In 2013, remittances accounted for 49% of gross domestic product (GDP), which was \nthe highest dependency on remittances of any economy in the world.4 Tajikistan\u2019s economy is \nhighly reliant on external factors, such as the economic situation in the Russian Federation and \nthe international prices of two key export commodities: aluminum and cotton. \n \n5.  Governance and capacity of institutions in Tajikistan have improved marginally over the \nlast decade (ranked 4.1 in 2015 on a 1\u20137 scale, up from 3.4 in 2006) but remain weak by \ninternational standards.5 The majority of policy decisions, including on some public investments, \nare made without comprehensive public scrutiny and analysis of their economic and social \nimpacts.6 Tajikistan\u2019s executive bodies often lack an in-depth understanding of policy concepts \nand implementation methods, limiting the effectiveness of policy decisions. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided policy and advisory technical assistance: ADB. 2013.

Despite  efforts  to  raise  Tajikistan\u2019s  Doing  Business  ranking  (footnote  28),  private \ninvestment continues to be constrained by an unfavorable business environment that imposes \nhigh uncertainty. Arbitrary taxation and informal inspection arrangements reduce the prospects \nof fair competition. The same government agency\u2014Tajikstandard\u2014sets technical regulations, \ncertifies product quality, and accredits conformity assessment bodies; this is prone to conflicts of \ninterest. Strong perceptions of corruption and expropriation risks discourage businesses and \ninvestors from expanding or investing in Tajikistan. The judiciary\u2019s ability to enforce contracts \nand protect investor rights is uncertain.7 Executive documents\u2014government orders, instructions, \nministerial memos, and regulations\u2014are often inaccessible, leaving businesses and investors \nunaware of existing rules. There is limited accountability regarding business ownership. \n \n7.  Businesses have limited knowledge of modern production techniques. Only 17% of firms \nreport having an internationally recognized quality certification (16.7% in 2008). Tajikistan ranks \n121st out of 140 countries in cluster development (footnote 5). Businesses have limited access \nto external markets due to poor transport and logistics infrastructure, and restrictive regional \ntransit arrangements. The energy supply is unreliable and large parts of the country lack a \nstable electricity supply during the 6-month winter period.8 Financing is expensive and short \nterm, reducing investors\u2019 capacity to expand and compete internationally. Credit to the private \nsector was 21.5% of GDP in 2014\u2014in line with the average for fragile and conflict-affected \ncountries (20.0% of GDP)\u2014, which is nevertheless an improvement from 16.9% of GDP during \n2009\u20132013.9 Overall, Tajikistan\u2019s country risk is very high.10 \n \n8.  The  private  sector  remains  weak  and  has  made  limited  progress  in  expanding  its \nproductive capabilities to create more wealth. Since 2005, the private sector\u2019s contribution to \nGDP has remained stable at about 55%; this is lower than Kazakhstan (65%) and the Kyrgyz \nRepublic (75%), but higher than Turkmenistan (25%) and Uzbekistan (45%).11 Many of the \nshortcomings in Tajikistan\u2019s economy\u2014low competitiveness of products in particular\u2014reflect \nthe private sector\u2019s poor performance. Until 2014, remittance inflows supported the appreciation \nof the real effective exchange rate, thereby reducing export competitiveness. The number of \nproducts exported with comparative advantage declined from 48 in 1995 to 44 in 2012.12 \n \n9.  Investment (gross fixed capital formation) is relatively low, averaging 16% of GDP during \n2005\u20132013. This limits future economic growth and job creation. Investment is largely funded by \nthe government and development partners; private investment was 5% of GDP during 2005\u2013\n2013, one of the lowest levels in the world. Foreign direct investment dropped from 9% of GDP \nduring 2004\u20132008 to 1% of GDP during 2009\u20132014, and is mainly concentrated in a few sectors: \n                                                                                                                                                       \nAdministration Working Paper.

Public \ninvestment is focused on large infrastructure and energy projects with long gestation periods. \n \n10.  The  programmatic  approach  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s national  development \nstrategy for 2007\u20132015.13 The government is developing a new national development strategy \nfor 2016\u20132030, which is expected to focus on development of the real economy, diversification \nof production, productive employment, expansion of the export potential of locally produced \ngoods and services, improvement of the investment climate, and support for entrepreneurship. \nIn March 2013, Tajikistan acceded to the World Trade Organization, a process that has led the \ngovernment to introduce improvements to its trade regime. \n \n11.  Under  the  program,  ADB  provides  the  government  with  advice  on  the  design  and \nimplementation of new policy and institutional mechanisms to improve the investment climate \n(footnote 2).14 ADB budget support provides the government with incentives for reforms that \notherwise would be delayed or not implemented. ADB support is important because the political \nsystem is often divided and vested interests resist policy changes. The programmatic approach \nis the best modality to implement required reforms in a chronologically sequenced manner. \n \n12.  The programmatic approach is aligned with (i) the interim country partnership strategy \nfor  2015,  which  includes  support  for  private  sector  reforms  as  one  of  three  operational \npriorities;15 and (ii) the forthcoming country partnership strategy for 2016\u20132020, through which \nADB plans to increase support for government-led reforms to achieve macroeconomic stability, \nimprove the investment climate, diversify the economy, and increase competitiveness. The \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department conducted a country diagnostic \nstudy that explains Tajikistan\u2019s declining competitiveness (footnote 12), which was a factor in \nthe  selection  of  improvement  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  competitiveness  as  a  strategic  thrust  of  ADB \nassistance  for  2016\u20132020.  The  Independent  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  country  assistance \nprogram  evaluation  for  1998\u20132013  recommended  that  ADB  increase  its  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment to strengthen governance and improve the business and investment climate.16 \n \n13.  In  2014,  ADB  completed  a  policy-based  program  in  Tajikistan  to  strengthen  tax \nadministration, social protection, and public financial management.17 In 2014, ADB approved its \nfirst nonsovereign operation in Tajikistan.18 Ongoing technical assistance is strengthening the \nenvironment  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  the  anti-money  laundering  regime.19 ADB \ncontinues to support restructuring of the energy sector. Subprogram 1 reinforced and benefited \nfrom development partner interventions, particularly from the World Bank Group.20 \n                                                \n13 Government of Tajikistan. 2007.

Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the program will be the development of the private sector and attraction of \ninvestments  to  Tajikistan.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  capabilities  and  opportunities  of \nbusinesses to set up and expand higher value-added production. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The program includes policy actions that will help deliver three outputs along the three \nsubprograms: (i) reduced cost of doing business, (ii) strengthened protection for businesses, \nand (iii) increased business innovation and productivity. Subprogram 1 has 10 policy actions; \nsubprogram 2 has 10 indicative policy actions, while subprogram 3 has 11. \n \n16.  Output 1: Reduced cost of doing business. The objective is to reduce the regulatory \ncost  of  operating  in  Tajikistan.  Under  subprogram  1,  to  reduce  unnecessary  costs  for \nbusinesses, the government is approving a new regulatory impact analysis (RIA) system for \nnewly proposed legal acts, and started two pilot RIAs (on improving access to finance and \nimproving  food  safety  through  technical  regulations).  Under  subprograms  2  and  3,  the \ngovernment will implement the new RIA system\u2014including gender analysis\u2014and publish RIA \nresults more widely on an authorized government website. \n \n17.  Under subprogram 1, the parliament is expected to approve a new law on business \ninspections that uses a risk-based inspection system and a new mechanism for coordination \nand reporting of annual inspection plans for all government agencies that conduct inspections. \nTo  fulfill  the  country\u2019s  commitments  under  the  World  Trade  Organization,  the  government \ndisclosed and reviewed the list of all existing provisional technical regulations, and removed 107 \noutdated technical regulations. This effort will continue during subprograms 2 and 3, along with \nthe introduction of voluntary international standards. \n \n18.  As of 1 July 2015, 180,000 taxpayers under the simplified regime (out of a total of \n240,000  taxpayers)  can  apply  to  the  Tax  Committee  for  a  log-in  and  mobile  password \nauthentication  system.  The  new,  free  system  allows  taxpayers  to  submit  tax  declarations \nthrough  the  Tax  Committee\u2019s  website.  The  committee  conducted  a  nationwide  awareness \ncampaign (using workshops; television and radio; and its call center) to inform taxpayers about \nthis option. Under subprograms 2 and  3, the committee will  expand  the use of electronic \ndeclarations to facilitate timely and effective tax compliance, particularly through the log-in and \nmobile  password  authentication  system,  while  continuing  to  make  the  old  token-based \nauthentication system available to other taxpayers (e.g., payers of value-added tax). \n \n19.  Output  2:  Strengthened  protection  for  businesses. The  objective  is  to  increase \ntransparency  and  thereby  reduce  expropriation  risks  for  businesses.  The  government  is \nimproving transparency of business ownership: as of 8 July 2015, the Tax Committee\u2019s website \n(www.andoz.tj) provides access to information in the committee's database of legal entities \n(including ownership, management, economic activity, capital, and contacts). Subprograms 2 \nand 3 will further support transparency, particularly regarding legal documents and gender-\ndisaggregated  statistics  of  business  ownership,  to  ensure  that  the  government  is  better \nprepared to support women entrepreneurship. \n \n20.  The new investment law\u2014to be submitted for Parliament approval under subprogram \n1\u2014seeks to ensure a more transparent and consistent treatment of investment incentives and \nto signal the government\u2019s interest in promoting private investment. An authorized government \n ", "5 \nbody will coordinate and make public all investment incentives. The draft law establishes the \nconcept of indirect expropriation and the right of the investor to compensation in such cases.21 \nUnder the program, the government will (i) improve investment promotion by structuring the \ninvestment promotion agency according to international good practice, with a clear, long-term \nresults framework; strengthened governance; internal control; and funding; and (ii) approve \nlegislation with clear methods for determining compensation in case of expropriation. \n \n21.  Output  3:  Increased  business  innovation  and  productivity.  The  objective  is  to \nimprove the productivity of firms operating in Tajikistan. In subprogram 1, the government is \ntransferring Tajikstandard accreditation functions to the newly established National Accreditation \nCenter, a body with strengthened governance, including management that is accountable to a \nsupervisory board with independent members. The National Accreditation Center will become \nfully independent of Tajikstandard by 1 January 2017. This will reduce potential conflicts of \ninterest within the quality infrastructure system, and support product quality certification. \n \n22.  The government has raised the status for the Entrepreneurship Support Fund (ESF) and \nchanged its governance structure to one governed by a supervisory council. This will increase \nESF oversight and enable increased funding from the state budget. Under the program, the \ngovernment will adopt a credit guarantee scheme that will work with private financial institutions \nto finance investments by local businesses in innovation, particularly for businesses led by \nwomen. Under subprograms 2 and 3, the government will improve ESF governance, internal \ncontrol, and funding to support local businesses when investing in innovation. \n \n23.  In subprogram 1, the government (i) increased state budget allocation for grants to \nbusinesswomen for cofinancing of investments, and (ii) allocated office space for two business \nservice centers, which are managed by nongovernment organizations and provide incubation \nand other services such as marketing and taxation advice. The program will continue to finance \ninvestments by businesswomen, and to support business service center expansion. \n \n24.  In subprogram 1, the President of Tajikistan instructed the government to (i) develop and \nadopt a new tariff policy for electricity that will eliminate cross-customer price subsidies; and (ii) \ncarry out public consultations in developing and implementing the policy. The new tariff policy \nwill  become  effective  on  or  before  1  January  2017,  and  allow  fair  competition  among \nbusinesses. The government will include subsidy allocations in the state budget to ensure tariff \nincreases do not negatively affect low-income customers. Under the program, the government \nwill introduce measures to improve collection rates in the energy sector. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n25.  Tajikistan remains the poorest country in the CIS, with the lowest per capita (i) GDP \n($1,099 in 2014), and (ii) social expenditures. Development financing needs are substantial, \nparticularly for social security and welfare expenditures (predominantly pensions). The pension \nsystem faces demographic challenges,22 which explain in part the significant increase in the \nstate budget share allocated to social expenditures (from 32.8% in 2010 to 44.4% in 2014). \n26.  The  government  is  cutting  expenditures  due  to  lower-than-expected  revenues\u2014a \n                                                \n21 Indirect expropriation occurs when the state interferes with the use of the investor\u2019s property or its benefits, even if \nthe property is not seized and the title not affected (e.g., if government measures force an investor to flee the \ncountry, deny an investor access to funds or profits, or compel the investor to sell or transfer at an unfairly low \nprice). \n22 The number of public pensioners increased by just 1.0% during 1997\u20132009, but rose more than 2.5% per year \nduring 2010\u20132014 (from 554,000 to 611,000), an effect of the post-World War II \u201cbaby boom.\u201d \n ", "6 \nconsequence of the economic slowdown. Growth is projected to decline from 6.7% of GDP in \n2014 to 3.5% in 2015. Remittance inflows in dollar terms dropped 32% in the first half of 2015 \ncompared with the first half of 2014, slashing consumption. Revenue collection in the first 9 \nmonths of 2015 was TJS392 million below the target. The estimated financing gap in the state \nbudget is about $170 million for 2015 and about $42 million for 2016 (Table 1). Fiscal support is \nneeded to prevent reduction of critical social expenditures; address demographic challenges \n(i.e., increased pension demand and the return of migrants); and finance subprogram 1.23 \n \nTable 1: Tajikistan State Budget\u2019s Financing Gap \n2015  2016 \nAmount  Amount \nItem  ($ million)  % of GDP  ($ million)  % of GDP \n1.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $53.4 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance its development program, in particular subprogram 1.24 The \ngovernment has also requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR4.72 million from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance its development program. The loan will have a \n24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft financing agreement. The government is closing the remaining financing gap by using \ncash reserves, reducing noncritical expenditures, and delaying capital expenditure plans and \nincreases in salaries and pensions. The financing plan is in Table 2. The indicative size of \nsubprograms 2 and 3 is $20 million and $30 million; this will be finalized during processing of \neach subprogram, taking into account the government\u2019s development financing needs. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan for Subprogram 1 \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nSpecial Funds resources (grant)  53.4  89.0 \nSpecial Funds resources (loan)  6.6  11.0 \nTotal  60.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n23 The 2015 budget allocates 45.1% of available resources (or 13.2% of GDP) to social expenditures. \n24 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis conducted by the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank in November 2014 determined that Tajikistan had a moderate risk of debt distress and was therefore \neligible to receive 50% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants. The rating was based on debt-to-GDP, \ndebt-to-exports (including remittances), and debt-to-budget revenue ratios. \n ", "7 \n28.  Tajikistan\u2019s long-term debt sustainability remains moderate despite short-term balance of \npayments and fiscal shocks (footnote 24). External debt declined from an average of about 70% \nof GDP in 2000\u20132011 to 28% in 2014, due to economic growth, debt forgiveness, and grant \nassistance from development partners, such as ADB, the World Bank, and bilateral agencies. \nPublic and publicly guaranteed debt was 28.2% of GDP at the end of 2014; the Export\u2013Import \nBank of China was the largest creditor (52%), with the remainder owed to multilateral donors.25 \n \n29.  The macroeconomic deterioration and depletion of foreign exchange reserves observed \nsince  the  end  of  2014  can  worsen  debt  ratios.  Tajikistan\u2019s  gross  official  reserves  were \nequivalent to 1.4 months of imports as of the end of 2014 and are projected to be just 1.2 \nmonths equivalent of imports by the end of 2015. Similar to many currencies in the region, the \nTajik somoni depreciated 30% against the US dollar in the year ending 30 September 2015.26 In \n2014 the current account deficit was 9.1%. Tajikistan is graduating from all-grant assistance \nfrom major development partners such as ADB and the World Bank. The government lacks \naccess to international financial markets to finance sovereign debt, because of the very high \ncountry risk (footnote 10). Domestic financing is very limited and short term. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n30.  The  executing  agency  is  the  State  Committee  on  Investments  and  State  Property \nManagement (SCISPM). The implementing agencies are the Ministry of Energy and Water \nResources,  the  Ministry  of  Justice,  the  SCISPM,  the  ESF,  Tajikstandard,  and  the  Tax \nCommittee. The Executive Office of the President, the Ministry of Finance, and the Secretariat \nof the Consultative Council on Improvement of Investment Climate under the President will \noversee program implementation. No program implementation unit will be established. \n \n31.  Financing  proceeds  for  subprogram  1  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  to  the \nGovernment  of  Tajikistan  as  the  recipient  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2015, as amended from time to time) upon compliance with all policy actions for \nsubprogram 1 and with satisfaction of all conditions precedent to loan and grant effectiveness. \nThe proceeds will be used to finance the cost of items produced and procured in ADB member \ncountries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral \nsources. The implementation period for subprogram 1 is January\u2013December 2015. The closing \ndate is 30 June 2016. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Fiscal Impacts \n32.  The  program  supports  economic  growth  through  reforms  that  increase  investment \nopportunities  and  improve  capabilities  of  firms  to  set  up  and  expand  higher  value-added \nproduction. The reforms are expected to help firms in Tajikistan raise revenues from product \nsales  and  reduce  the cost  of  doing  business, thus  increasing  their  expected returns. The \nprimary beneficiaries are current and future entrepreneurs and investors who will benefit from \nan improved business environment; women entrepreneurs are specifically targeted. The reforms \nare expected to provide indirect benefits to the working population (employed and unemployed), \nbecause investment opportunities will create jobs and increase wages. Reduced regulatory \ncosts will attract more businesses to the formal sector, increasing the number of formal jobs. \n                                                \n25  ADB recognizes China as the People's Republic of China. \n26 Source: National Bank of Tajikistan. \n ", "8 \n33.  Inspections and certification impose direct costs on the average small and medium-sized \nenterprise equivalent to 16.6% of profits.27 More than 1,000 legal acts are adopted every year in \nTajikistan and these can impose unnecessary costs on businesses, because the government \nperforms limited quality checks on the drafts. RIA will improve decision-making quality and \nreduce unnecessary costs to businesses arising from new policy and regulatory proposals. \nMore than 100 outdated technical regulations were eliminated in 2015, reducing the regulatory \nburden on firms. Electronic tax declarations will improve transparency and reduce opportunities \nfor corruption; the new system will help increase the number of taxpayers filing electronically \nfrom about 6,500 taxpayers at the end of 2014 to more than 40,000 by the end of the program. \n \n34.  The perceived risk of corruption and expropriation is high, discouraging businesses and \ninvestors from expanding or investing in Tajikistan. Disclosure of the ownership of businesses \non the Tax Committee\u2019s website will increase transparency and reduce expropriation risks for \nbusinesses. Increased stability in legislation\u2014particularly regarding taxation\u2014provided by the \nnew law on investments will improve the attractiveness of investing in Tajikistan. Recent large \nprivate investments in Tajikistan in the beverages and distribution sectors are encouraging. \n \n35.  The restructuring of Tajikstandard is expected to improve the institutional and regulatory \nframework for firms in Tajikistan applying for certification of product quality. Improvements in the \nquality of products made in Tajikistan are critical to reversing the decline in the number of \nproducts exported with comparative advantage (para. 8). Government support through the ESF \nand  grants  to  women  entrepreneurs  are  expected  to  improve  low  levels  of  financing  for \ninvestments in product and service innovation (para. 7). \n \n36.  Access to electricity is a binding constraint to business development. Tajikistan ranks \n177th out of 189 economies on the ease of getting electricity.28 Firms are reluctant to invest in \nnew equipment and automated production if they cannot access a stable supply of affordable \nelectricity.  Existing  indirect  (tariff-based)  cross-customer  energy  subsidies  distort  both  the \npricing structure and market competition. The new tariff policy for electricity is expected to bring \n(i) additional revenues to a system that charges consumers at a rate lower than required to fully \nrecover  costs,  and  thus  is  not  yet  self-sufficient;  and  (ii)  fairer  competition  for  private \nbusinesses, which pay tariffs that are almost triple those paid by organizations\u2014e.g., budgetary \norganizations and state-owned enterprises (SOEs)\u2014that successfully lobby for lower tariffs. The \nreforms will improve access to a reliable supply of electricity. \n \n37.  The government is expected to incur significant adjustment costs and revenue losses in \nthe implementation of policy reforms under the program. The majority of the costs will come \nfrom the increase of state budget allocations to (i) budgetary organizations, to pay for higher \nelectricity tariffs arising from removal of the implicit subsidy in their tariff; (ii) the low-income \npopulation as compensation for higher electricity costs (through the Utility Subsidy and the \nTargeted Social Assistance Program) arising from the new policy that will remove implicit cross-\ncustomer subsidies from the tariff; and (iii) the ESF, for financing of businesses. Revenue losses \nwill arise from strengthening the investment incentives regime, i.e., from the increase of the \nstabilization period for investors that signed investment agreements with the government.29 \n \n                                                \n27 International Finance Corporation. 2009.

The government approved the Public Financial Management (PFM) Strategy 2009\u20132018 \nto  increase  the  credibility  and  transparency  of  the  country\u2019s  budget,  but  implementation \nchallenges remain: (i) comprehensive public scrutiny and analysis of the economic and social \nimpacts of large public investments are rare; (ii) the quasi-fiscal activities of SOEs have largely \nremained outside the purview of the central budget; and (iii) efficiency in tax collection is among \nthe lowest in Asia and the Pacific. Development partners continue to assist the government in \naddressing these weaknesses. Recent PFM reform initiatives include (i) the creation of internal \naudit  institutions  in  selected  government  agencies,  (ii)  the  implementation  of  the  budget \nadministrative  classification,  (iii)  the  redesign  of  the  chart  of  accounts,  (iv)  improved \nmacroeconomic forecasting, and (v) basic monitoring of SOEs. \n \n39.  The government is revising the law on public procurement to address serious flaws (e.g., \nambiguous provisions on single-source procurement and complaints handling) that can cause \nmisprocurement  and  delay  public  investments.  The  Public  Procurement  Agency  is  heavily \ninvolved in managing procurement, which conflicts with its oversight and regulatory functions. \nADB is reviewing a draft procurement law and will support capacity building for its effective \nimplementation.  ADB  will  facilitate restructuring  of the  Public  Procurement  Agency  into  an \neffective regulatory agency and promote procurement decentralization. \n \n40.  Tajikistan scored 23 out of a possible 100 in Transparency International\u2019s Corruption \nPerception Index, where 0 is \u201chighly corrupt\u201d and 100 \u201cvery clean.\u201d30 The program includes \nmeasures that promote transparency and reduce opportunities for corruption: (i) a new RIA \nsystem that includes mechanisms for disclosure of newly proposed legislation; and a free, single \nrepository for executive documents; (ii) a coordination mechanism for government inspection of \nbusinesses; and (iii) improved information about ownership of businesses through the Tax \nCommittee\u2019s website. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government and with SCISPM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n41.  Policy reforms are expected to have indirect medium- and long-term impacts on poverty, \nmainly through more sustainable economic growth and increased employment opportunities. \nPrivate investment is expected to increase as a result of the reduced cost of doing business; \nmore transparent tax regime; improved access to electricity for businesses and households, and \nincreased  tariff  equity  for  businesses;  and  improved  protection  framework  for  investors. \nReduced regulatory costs are expected to attract businesses to the formal sector and increase \nformal jobs; improved business innovation and productivity should increase profits and wages. \n \n42.  The  program  includes  actions  to  address  obstacles  faced  in  particular  by  women \nentrepreneurs, and promote equality between male and female entrepreneurs. For subprogram \n1, the government (i) included a requirement for gender analysis in the RIA system for newly \nproposed legal acts to understand the potential impacts on women, (ii) allocated funds to \nbusinesswomen to cofinance investments, and (iii) supported the creation of two business \nservice centers that have gender balance among their staff. The program will monitor the share \nof women among entrepreneurs, the number of women entrepreneurs that receive government \ncofinancing for investments, and the number of female taxpayers filing electronic declarations. \n                                                \n30 Transparency  International.

Subprogram  1  is  unlikely  to  have  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment,  require \ninvoluntary resettlement, or affect indigenous peoples. It is categorized as C for each of these \nsafeguard areas. ADB consulted with private businesses and business associations regarding \nthe program design and implementation. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n44.      Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.31 Private investment growth may be constrained by lower remittance \ninflows  due  to  the  deterioration  of  the  economic  situation  of  major  economic  partners. \nPerceptions of high corruption and expropriation risks may discourage business investment in \nTajikistan. The PFM and procurement systems are weak, although PFM reforms to address \nfiduciary  risks  are  being  introduced  (para.  38).  The  program  has  measures  promoting \ntransparency  and  reducing  opportunities  for  corruption  (para.  34).  The  recent  International \nMonetary  Fund  Article IV  report  recommends  the government to  ensure that  central  bank \nliquidity support benefits only banks with strong balance sheets and good collateral, and refrain \nfrom shifting further deposits to banks. The program\u2019s overall risk assessment is high, but the \ngovernment has in place necessary mitigating measures. Subprogram 1\u2019s integrated benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n45.  The  government  and  the  SCISPM  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the financing agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n46.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan and \ngrant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nrecommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Investment Climate Reforms Program; \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR4,720,000 to the Republic of \nTajikistan for subprogram 1 of the Investment Climate Reforms Program, from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft financing \nagreement presented to the Board; and \n(iii)  the grant not exceeding $53,400,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan, from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, for subprogram 1 of the Investment Climate Reforms \nProgram, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \n13 November 2015              President \n                                                \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nDevelopment of the private sector and attraction of investments (National Development Strategy 2007\u2013\n2015)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nwith Targets and  Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nCapabilities and  a.
