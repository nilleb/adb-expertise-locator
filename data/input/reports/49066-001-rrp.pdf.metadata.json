(Beijing  Capital)  for  the \nWestern  Counties  Water  and  Wastewater  Management  Project  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\nlocal  governments \n\n2. \nRegional  imbalances  and a  severe  infrastructure  divide  between urban  and  rural  areas \nare critical  development challenges  for the  PRC.  Less-developed  regions  of the  country  suffer \nfrom  inadequate  public  infrastructure  and  access  to  basic  services.  For  water  in  particular, \nremote and rural areas face large and growing needs for improved water supply and wastewater \nmanagement  services  to  meet  higher  environmental  standards.  Funds  provided  through  local \ngovernment  financing  vehicles,  historically  the  main  channels  to  finance  infrastructure,  are \ninsufficient for the magnitude of investments required. \n \n3. \nThe  scale  of  unmet  needs  in  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  management  sector, \nincreased  pollution  pressures,  the  associated  risks  of  waterborne  diseases,  and  increased \nattention to efficiency have become urgent priorities of the central government. 2 They are also, \nas  in  other  sectors,  encouraging  new  approaches  to  infrastructure  concessions  in  the  form  of \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs).  Traditionally, \nthe  PRC  have \nundertaken public environmental service concessions by planning, tendering, and implementing \nprojects  on  a  staggered  or  stand-alone  basis.  However,  technical  experts  are  coming  to  the \nview  that  an  integrated  economic  approach  to  infrastructure  management  is  required  to  foster \nstrong, sustainable, and balanced growth.3 Infrastructure investment strategies need to take into \naccount that infrastructure assets are interdependent and constitute a wider system; therefore, \nthe conventional project-centric approach adopted by many local governments may not deliver \nthe efficiencies crucial for their long-term sustainability. This awareness is reflected in the PRC\u2019s \nnew  PPP  guidelines  and  concession  measures,  in  which  multiple  interlocking  infrastructure \nservices can be tendered out, presenting an opportunity to raise the efficiency of infrastructure \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  central  government  is  taking  on  this  challenge  by  establishing  a  comprehensive  regulatory  framework  and \ndevelopment  plan  for  water  and  sanitation.  In  January  2011,  the  State  Council\u2019s  No.  1  Document  set  water \nresource  management  as  the  country\u2019s  top  priority  that  year.  In  2013,  the  government\u2019s  Resolution  Concerning \nMajor Issues in Comprehensively Deepening Reform called for integrated urban and rural development, including a \ncomprehensive plan for urban and rural infrastructure construction and the equalization of basic public services in \nurban  and  rural  areas.  The  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  has  also  published  its  Guideline  on  Project \nConstruction  and  Investment  for  Rural  Sewage  Treatment  to  encourage  development  in  less-developed  areas. \nTargets  under  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u20132015)  for  National  Urban  Wastewater  Treatment  and  Reuse \nInfrastructure Construction aim to increase the rate of wastewater treatment in smaller towns  from 2010 levels of \nless  than  20%  to  at  least  30%  by  2015.  In  2015,  the  Action  Plan  for  Water  Pollution  Control  was  announced, \nincluding a list of 10 measures to tackle water pollution, with the aim of improving the country\u2019s water environment \nquality and restoring the system function of water ecology by 2030. \n\n3  McKinsey  Global  Institute.  2013.

Geneva. \n\n\f2 \n\ndesign,  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  through  an  optimized  portfolio  approach. 4 \nExamples of such synergies include (i) the sizing of wastewater treatment capacity in step with \ntap water supply, (ii) cost efficiencies from coordinated operations, (iii) monitoring water quantity \nthroughout  the  value  chain  to  detect  any  illegal  wastewater  discharge,  and  (iv)  facilitating  the \nreuse of treated wastewater as water supply for industrial users. \n \n4. \nThrough  continuous  screening  and  discussion  with  stakeholders  in  the  water  and \nsanitation  sectors,  the  team  identified  Beijing  Capital  as  a  strong  candidate  for  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  support.  Beijing  Capital  has  adopted  a  new  strategic  focus  on \nexpanding into less-developed markets, including counties in western regions of the PRC where \ninfrastructure  for  water  treatment,  distribution,  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems \nremain  severely  underdeveloped. 5  Beijing  Capital  acknowledged  ADB\u2019s  strong  sector \nexperience  in  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  operations  and  requested  ADB  to  lead  the \narrangement of a US dollar\u2013yuan dual-currency financing package. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n5. \nThe  project  is  designed to optimize  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure portfolio  in the \nwestern counties and townships in the PRC. The project involves the construction or acquisition, \nupgrade  and/or  expansion  of  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure  and  associated  facilities \nduring 2016\u20132018, and operation and maintenance thereafter on a concession basis. \n \n6. \nUnit  costs  of  delivering  small-scale  environmental  infrastructure  are  significantly  higher \nthan large-scale urban infrastructure. The project aims to minimize overall costs by adopting (i) \na comprehensive multisector approach, and (ii) cost-competitive technologies: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nMultisector  approach  to  select  an  efficient  combination  of  subprojects. \nThere  are  significant  potential  synergies  in  the  planning,  design,  construction, \nand  operation  of  water  and  wastewater  management  facilities.  By  supporting \nmultisector  concessions  where  available,  the  project  will  improve  resource \nefficiencies. \nCost-competitive  technologies.  Beijing  Capital  will  use  cost-competitive \nsolutions  and  adapt  optimally  to  local  conditions.  In townships  large  enough  for \nsewer  pipe  networks,  the  company  will  implement  centralized  collection  and \nwastewater  treatment  systems.  For  small  towns  and  villages  without  sewage \nnetwork  coverage,  the  company  will  implement  distributed  technology,  such  as \non-site modular units at capacities as small as 0.5 tons per day. \n\n \nBeijing  Capital  will  be  responsible  for  identifying,  selecting,  negotiating,  implementing, \n\n7. \nand operating the subprojects.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n                                                \n4  Regulations  were  revised  in April  2015  to  replace  the  previous concession  templates  (sector-specific  documents \ntailored  for  water,  wastewater,  gas,  district  heating,  and  city  transport)  with  a  unified  template  applicable  to  all \nsectors.

It is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, with 54.6% of its \nshares owned by Beijing Capital Group Co., Ltd., which is in turn wholly  owned by the Beijing \nmunicipal government.6 \n \n9. \nBeijing  Capital\u2019s  core  business  involves  the  investment  and  operation  of  water  supply, \nwastewater  treatment,  solid  waste  management,  and  other  environmental  services.  At  end  of \n2014,  Beijing  Capital  had  aggregate  water  supply  capacity  of  9.3  million  tons/day,  wastewater \ntreatment capacity of 6.3 million tons/day, and solid waste treatment capacity of 5,065 tons/day. \nIts  water  and  solid  waste  treatment  projects  were  spread  over  49  cities  of  17  provinces  and \nserve  a  population  of  over  35  million.  Beijing  Capital  differentiates  itself  from  its  peers  by \nproviding, where applicable, one-stop integrated solutions across multiple infrastructure sectors. \nBy  leveraging  expertise  in  water  supply  and  distribution,  urban\u2013rural  wastewater  treatment, \nsewage  network  management,  and  solid  waste  management,  Beijing  Capital  aims  to  improve \ninfrastructure efficiency. \n \n10.  Western  counties  and  townships,  areas  where  adequate  water  supply  and  wastewater \nmanagement  services are lacking,  are a new  strategic focus  of  the company.  Like its  industry \npeers,  Beijing  Capital  has  historically  focused  on  build-operate-transfer  opportunities  in  large \ncities.  Beijing  Capital  is  undertaking  a  strategic  shift  to  pursue  business  potential  in  less-\ndeveloped  towns and  rural  communities. The company  has  developed  investment targets  and \ntraining  for  this  new  growth  area,  and  has  signed  strategic  cooperation  agreements  with  the \nlocal  governments.  To  expand  the  scope  of  its  service  offerings  to  rural  communities,  Beijing \nCapital  in  2014  acquired  a  majority  stake  in  Capital  Greinworth  Environmental  Protection \nTechnology Co., Ltd. (CGEP), a leading manufacturer of modular, small-scale units for on-site \nwastewater treatment.7 CGEP\u2019s units are used in 3,400 villages across 22 provinces, providing \na strong platform for growth. \n \n11. \nassets of CNY25.2 billion, revenue of CNY5.6 billion, and net profit of CNY688.1 million.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nBeijing Capital has demonstrated steady financial performance. In 2014, it reported total \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Output \n\nImpact.  The  impact  will  be  the  improved  access  to  and  efficiency  of  water  and \n\n12. \nwastewater management services in the western counties of the PRC.  \n \n13. \nsupply and wastewater management services in western counties of the PRC. \n \n\nOutcome. The outcome will be the expansion and improvement in the provision of water \n\n                                                \n6  As Beijing Capital is a managerially independent, commercially oriented company engaged in market competition, \n\nprocurement will follow ADB\u2019s policies for nonsovereign operations. \n\n7  CGEP\u2019s technologies are based on Japan\u2019s Jokaso system and enhanced with (i) flexibility to adapt to small rural \ncommunities by having a product lineup ranging from 0.5 tons/day to 2,000 tons/day; (ii) remote monitoring system \nthat can oversee operations of hundreds of small-scale wastewater treatment stations on a real-time basis and be \naccessible through an internet browser or app; and (iii) automated operation that requires minimum on-site staff. \nThe technologies were awarded 37 patents by the State Intellectual Property Office. \n\n\f4 \n\nOutput.  The  output  will  be  the  newly  constructed  and  rehabilitated  water  supply  and \n14. \nwastewater treatment facilities and associated infrastructure in target provinces of the PRC. By \n2019,  19  subprojects  with  a  total  water  supply  capacity  of  500,000  tons/day  and  wastewater \ntreatment capacity of 540,000 tons/day will be developed. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n15. \nConsistency with ADB strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof  Strategy  2020,    which  identifies  infrastructure  and  environment  as  two  of  four  strategic \npriorities.8 On infrastructure, the project is in line with the strategy\u2019s focus on water supply and \nsanitation, as well as with its emphasis on PPP. On the environment, the project mitigates water \npollution and health threats, and promotes environmentally sustainable growth. \n \n16. \nConsistency  with  country  partnership  strategy.  By  supporting  inclusive  growth  and \nenvironmental sustainability, the project addresses two of the three development goals of ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC  and  aligns  with  its  sector  focus  on  environment \nprotection,  water  management,  and  pollution  control.9 It  strongly  complements  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \ninitiatives  in  wastewater  treatment  and  water  pollution  control  in  urban  areas,  past  policy \nadvisory support for tariff reform,10 and recent advisory work on the sanitation needs of smaller \ncities and towns.11 \n \n17. \nConsistency with water  and urban operational  plans. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s \nWater  Policy,  which  recognizes  the  crucial  importance  of  water  to  the  rural  poor,  the  critical \nimpacts  of  water  scarcity,  pollution,  and  degradation  of  watersheds,  and  the  importance  of \nefficient  and  sustainable  water  utility  operation.12 ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020 \ncommits  to  investments  of  $2.0  billion\u2013$2.5  billion  per  year  to  2020,  and  targets  an  additional \n$500  million  per  year for  private  sector  lending.13 Integrated  water  and wastewater  planning  is \nconsistent  with  the  operational  plan\u2019s  prioritization  of  efficiency  gains  as  the  central  design \nfeature for ADB interventions. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.14 \n\n18. \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n21. \n\nJustification for ADB involvement in the project is based on the following: \n(i) \n\nCompared  with  more  developed  regions,  the  PRC\u2019s  western  counties  and \ntownships  are  disadvantaged  in  attracting  private  capital  to  municipal  service \nconcessions  such  as  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  services.  ADB \nsupport will increase private investment and commercial bank lending to regions \nthat are lagging behind. \nADB assistance is crucial to demonstrate the commercial viability and efficiency \nof multisector service concessions with facilities across a range of sizes\u2014a new \nmodel emerging in the PRC. ADB support is expected to highlight this untapped \npotential  and  build  confidence  in  private  sector  participation  for  new  forms  of \nPPPs. \nADB  assistance  will  encourage  Beijing  Capital  to  improve  environmental \nconditions  in  rural  areas  with  small-sized,  modular,  high-standard  wastewater \ntreatment facilities.  In  so  doing,  the  project  will  improve living  standards in rural \nareas, and contribute to a more balanced urban and rural development. \nADB  assistance  will  lower  transaction  costs  by  bundling  multiple  infrastructure \nsubprojects,  which  are  often  too  small  and  time-consuming  for  international \ncommercial banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. ADB will link the cluster of \nsubprojects  with  the  international  financing  community  by  arranging  syndication \nand providing in-depth technical and safeguard due diligence. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n22. \nRegulatory  risk.  The  PRC\u2019s  policies  governing  water  and  wastewater  treatment  are \nsupportive.  The  government  has  also  set  clear  goals  to  improve  water  quality  and  reduce \npollution.  However,  the  PRC\u2019s  regulatory  framework  is  evolving  with  risks  of  delays  in  the \napproval of tariff increases. \n \nOfftake  counterparty  risk. In the case of water supply, fees are reliably collected from \n23. \nend-users  since  national  policies  require  each  end-use  customer  to  be  metered,  and  allow \ncurtailment of supply in the event of nonpayment. In the case of wastewater treatment, fees are \npublicly  announced,  largely  sourced  through treatment  fees  collected  from  end-users  together \nwith  tap  water  fees,  and  further  backstopped  by  host  governments  under  concession \nobligations.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n24. \nCompletion  and  operation  risk.  Beijing  Capital  has  a  proven  track  record  in \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance across a wide range of facility types. Completion and \noperations risk are mitigated by the standardized, homogeneous nature of the subprojects. The \ncapacity of Beijing Capital\u2019s technical and operational teams was confirmed by ADB\u2019s technical \nadvisor during due diligence. \n \n\n\f \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n7 \n\nimpact  assessment \n\nimplementation  system \n\n25. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts  are  incorporated in the safeguard reports  and  plans.  Beijing Capital  has  committed to \nenhance  its  institutional capacity  to  adequately manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental \nimpacts.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  involved  an  audit  of  Beijing  Capital\u2019s  existing  environmental  and \nsocial  management  system  (ESMS)  and  its  past  and  current  performance  against  the  PRC\u2019s \nlaws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment  of  Beijing  Capital  to  meet  the  PRC\u2019s  social  and  environmental  safeguard \nrequirements  are  deemed  adequate.  Beijing  Capital  will  update  its  ESMS  to  include  an \nenvironmental \nto  meet  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements  prior  to  the  first  disbursement.  The  updated  ESMS  will  ensure  Beijing  Capital\u2019s \ncapacity  to  conduct  future  subprojects  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \ninclude  detailed  subproject  selection  procedure  and  criteria. 16  The  management  of  Beijing \nCapital  has  committed  to  allocate  sufficient  human  resources  and  budget  to  implement  the \nupdated ESMS. \n \nThe potential environmental impacts will be reversible and are not unprecedented.17 The \n26. \nimpacts associated with the construction of sewage and water supply network are mainly noise \nand  vibration  during  excavation  works.  Traffic  congestions  and  nuisance  to  communities  from \nroad  works  are  manageable  as  the  subprojects  are  located  in  small  towns.  Potential  impacts \nduring  operation for  wastewater  treatment  include effluent quality,  sludge  management,  noise, \nodor,  and  possible  generation  of  toxic  gases.  Potential  impacts  during  operation  for  water \nsupply  facility  include  over  extraction  of  water  resources,  delivery  of  unsafe  water  caused  by \nraw  water  pollution,  and  adverse  impacts  associated  with  the  use  of  chlorine  and  other \nchemicals. Subprojects with impacts associated with raw water supply and sludge management \nwill be avoided in the subproject selection process. Other impacts can be mitigated through the \nadoption of good engineering practices. \n \nSubprojects  will  be  screened  and  categorized  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n27. \nStatement. The updated ESMS will include detailed screening procedures and criteria. ADB will \nnot \nincluding \nenvironment  management  plans  will  be  prepared  for  ADB-funded  category  B  subprojects. \nBeijing  Capital  will  carry  out  audits for  existing facilities  that  will  be  acquired  with funding from \nADB; a corrective action plan (CAP) will be developed before the start of operations. The initial \nenvironmental  examinations  and  audit  reports  with  CAP  will  be  disclosed  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard  requirements.18 The  ESMS  will  cover  Beijing  Capital\u2019s  other  activities  such  as  the \nmanufacturing and installation of decentralized wastewater treatment modules for communities. \n \n\nfinance  any  category  A  subprojects. \n\nInitial  environmental  examinations \n\n                                                \n16 The selection criteria include ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list. \n17 Beijing Capital will exclude potential category A subprojects with significant environmental adverse impacts. \n18 Each subproject company will implement environmental management plans and CAPs. \n\n\f8 \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n28. \nThe  audit  finds  that  land  acquisition  is  expected  to  be  in  the  vicinity  of  urban  and \nnonresidential areas, which will avoid any physical displacement in the buffer zone around water \ntreatment  plants.  Land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and \nand  wastewater \nrehabilitation are not expected to be significant and, if needed, are normally carried out by local \ngovernment  agencies.  Beijing  Capital\u2019s  updated ESMS  will  include resettlement  principles and \nprocedures to ensure that ADB-funded subprojects are rigorously examined with regard to land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. Should subprojects have involuntary resettlement impacts \nentailing  physical  and  economic  displacement,  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented by local governments prior to any construction activities  in accordance with PRC \nlaws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  audit  also  finds  that  the \nproject is not expected to have any impacts on ethnic minorities. The ESMS will include social \nsafeguard screening procedures to ensure there are no adverse impacts on ethnic minorities. \n \n29. \nOther  social  dimensions. The project is categorized as no gender elements, however \nBeijing  Capital  will  undertake  gender  analysis  as  part  of  the  environmental  and  social  impact \nassessment for each subproject; and involve women in consultation, awareness campaigns and \nhiring.  Beijing  Capital  upholds  gender  equality  and  provides  equal  benefits  and  training \nopportunities  for  both  men  and  women.  Priorities  are  provided  to  women  for  positions  in  the \nfinancial  and  human  resource  department,  and  in  laboratories.  Beijing  Capital  is  committed  to \nundertake  measures  to  (i)  support  engagement  of  women  in  construction  activities  by  its \ncontractors;  and  (ii)  regularly  ascertain  concerns  of  residents,  including  women,  through  the \nconsultations with resident  welfare  associations.  Beijing  Capital  will  comply  with  national  labor \nlaws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply \nwith the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.19 The  borrower will  report  regularly  to \nADB  on  (i)  its  (and  its  contractors\u2019)  compliance  with  such  laws,  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken. \nInformation  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  will  be  conducted  in  accordance \nwith ADB requirements.20 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nBeijing  Capital  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing best  international  practice \n30. \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\n\n31. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n\n                                                \n19 ADB. 2003.
