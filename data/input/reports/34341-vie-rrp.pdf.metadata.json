The Project will \nenhance  environmental  quality  by  protecting  nationally  and  globally \nsignificant biodiversity and improving the performance of forest-based \nenvironmental services. \n \nThe  Project  addresses  the  problems  of  forest  loss  and  degradation \nand  rural  poverty  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Central  Highlands  by  instituting \nsustainable forest management (SFM) over one third of the country\u2019s \nnatural  forest  estate,  whose  timber  stocks  are  currently  valued  at \nabout $4.4 billion. It will do so by (i) building capacity and upgrading \nforest sector governance, management, and incentive regimes in the \nprovinces of Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, Kon Tum, Lam Dong, and \nPhu  Yen,  covering  over  3  million  hectares  (ha)  of  forestland; \n(ii) increasing  forestry-based  livelihood  opportunities  and  reducing \npoverty  in  60  communes  by  involving  over  80,000  of  the  country\u2019s \npoorest  households  in  sustainable  forestry  covering  144,000  ha  of \ncommune and village forestlands, which will include over 30,000 ha of \nlivelihood  plantations  established  on  bare  lands;  (iii)  creating  an \nenabling business environment; (iv) strengthening supply and market \nchains,  and  (v)  satisfying  participation  requirements  for  the  use  of \ncredit enhancements that may be requested by investors and lenders \nthat wish to invest in the forestry sector in Viet Nam. \n \nThe Project objectives and activities include (i) formulating technically \nsound and socially relevant SFM plans for over 3 million ha of natural \nforests  and  plantations  on  bare  land,  with  SFM  plan  preparation \nincluding  (a)  delineating \nforest  conservation  and  use  zones, \n(b) rationalizing \nthe  Government\u2019s  and  stakeholders\u2019  roles  and \nresponsibilities  and  enabling  effective  participation  of  the  local \ncommunities  and  the  private  sector  in  SFM,  and  (c)  providing \ninvestments for improving the condition and productivity of household, \ncommunity,  and  state-managed \n(ii)  providing  wage-\ngenerating  and  livelihood-improvement  investments,  especially  for \nforest-dependent  ethnic  minorities; \n(iii)  supporting  stakeholder \ntechnical and operational capacity building for SFM; and (iv) providing \nproject implementation support. \n \nAdvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  required  to  (i)  provide  the \nGovernment  with  technical  and  advisory  support  for  extending \n\nforests; \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\n(iii) \n\nand \n\nand \n\nresource \n\ndeveloped, \n\ndevelopment \n\nforest \ninvestments  were \n\nproposed sustainable forest resource development and management \nto small-scale farmers and households; (ii) ensure effective livelihood \nimprovement and community support in 60 communes in the project \narea; \nfinancial \nfacilitate  decentralized  administrative  and \nmanagement;  and  (iv)  support  compliance  with  the  ethnic  minority, \ngender,  environment,  and  involuntary  resettlement  polices  of  the \nGovernment and Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  will \nexecute  the  Project,  and  provinces  will  be  responsible  for  project \nimplementation. Using a participatory diagnosis and design approach \ninvolving  multiple  stakeholders,  a  detailed  needs  assessment  was \nundertaken in the core subproject area of Lam Dong and seven core \ncommunes  spread  over  the  project  area.  Based  on  the  needs \nlivelihood \nassessment, \nimprovement \nproject \nimplementation  strategies  identified.  The  remaining  five  subprojects \nand  communes  have  been  selected  in  accordance  with  criteria \nagreed  among  MARD,  relevant  provincial  authorities,  primary \nstakeholders, and ADB. Consistent with the sector approach, detailed \nfeasibility  studies  for  the  non-core  provinces  and  communes  will  be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  a  predetermined  schedule  and \nguidelines. \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  development  success,  especially  in  expanding  food \nproduction and moving from rice deficits to the world\u2019s second largest \nrice export volume, is attributed to key reforms that (i) allocated land \nto individual farmers and households, (ii) rationalized and reduced the \nrole  of  the  state  in  the  sector,  (iii)  strengthened  the  technical  and \noperational  capacity  of  state  and  other  stakeholders,  and \n(iv) increased investments and access to markets. Viet Nam\u2019s forestry \nsector has the necessary policies, laws, and sector strategies in place \nto  replicate  the  successful  experience  of  the  agriculture  sector.  But \nweak  institutional,  technical,  and  human  resource  capacity  block \ntoward  pro-poor  and  market-oriented  governance  and \nmoves \nincentives \nthe  Central \nthe  sector.  Consequently,  even \nHighlands,  which  has  the  highest  potential  in  the  country  for  forest-\nbased economic development and poverty reduction, the sector is in \nserious  decline  largely  due  to  unsustainable  resource  use  and \nexploitation. A key factor for the poor performance is the uncertainty \nover forest ownership, management, and use rights and roles. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  Forest  Development  Strategy  (2001\u20132010)  and \nsector plans call for making forestry an important economic sector by \n(i)  protecting  and  developing  forest  resources  and  increasing  forest \ncover from 32% to 43% by 2010, (ii) achieving an annual growth rate \nof  over  3.5%  during  2006\u20132010,  (iii)  accelerating  and  completing \nforestland  allocation  under  the  Land  Law  and  the  revised  Forest \nProtection  and  Development  Law,  (iv)  using  forestry  to  improve \nlivelihoods  and  reduce  poverty  in  mountainous  areas  dominated  by \nethnic  minorities,  and  (iv)  increasing  the  efficiency  and  value  of  the \n\nfor \n\nin \n\n\f \n\niii\n\ncountry\u2019s  wood-processing  industry.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  is  to \nrestrict the state\u2019s role to forest and biodiversity protection, and to let \nthe private sector dominate the production of forestry products. \n \nThe comprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy (CPRGS) \nemphasizes the need to focus on the disadvantaged rural areas with \nhigh  proportions  of  ethnic  minorities,  such  as  the  Central  Highlands, \nwhere  minorities  dominate.  These  areas  are  where  most  of  the \nremaining forest survives, and the CPRGS recognizes this. \n \nThe  Central  Highlands  is  Viet  Nam\u2019s  most  important  forestry  region, \ncontributing  more  than  60%  of  the  country\u2019s  annual  hardwood \nconsumption.  Ecological  conditions  and  terrain  are  suitable  for \nsustainable  forestry,  as  population  densities  are  still  low  compared \nwith  the  country\u2019s  other  regions.  An  improving  road  network  is \nincreasing access to national and regional markets, and incremental \nwood  production  from  the  Project  will  mitigate  the  shortages  of  raw \nmaterial  supplies  faced  by  local  processing  enterprises.  Project \ninterventions  have  the  potential  to  secure  over  70%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s \n2010\u20132015 domestic timber needs. Accordingly, the draft 2006\u20132010 \nsocioeconomic development plan identifies the Central Highlands as \na priority forestry region. \n \nThe  Central  Highlands  is  home  to  over  5  million  people  and  the \nsecond  poorest  region  in  the  country,  with  poverty  rates  as  high  as \n57% among ethnic minorities. Over 2.5 million people are in the work \nforce,  but  unemployment  is  high,  with  only  about  11%  in  wage-\nearning  occupations.  As  these  communities  have  forestry-relevant \nskills and knowledge, engaging them in forestry will lead to improved \nforests, forestry, and livelihoods. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  Viet  Nam  Development  Goals  by \n(i) improving  the  condition  and  value  of  country\u2019s  forests  and  timber \nsupply,  (ii)  ending  hunger  among  80,000  of  the  country\u2019s  poorest \nhouseholds living near these forests, and (iii) improving the protection \nof critical watersheds and globally significant biodiversity. The specific \noutcome  of  the  Project  is  enabling  the  Government  to  institute  SFM \nover one-third of country\u2019s remaining natural forest resource base. \n \nThe  total  project  cost,  including  taxes  and  duties,  is  estimated  at \n$90.66 million equivalent. \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $45 million equivalent from \nits Special Fund resources.  \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) \nGovernment  \nGovernments of Finland, The \nNetherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland \nCofinancinga \nBeneficiaries \n \nTotal \na  Trust Funds for Forests \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nTotal Cost \n\n45.00 \n18.29 \n15.57 \n\n11.80 \n90.66 \n\nPercent \n49.60 \n20.20 \n17.20 \n\n13.00 \n100.00 \n\n \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  will  provide  a  loan  of  various \ncurrencies equivalent to $45 million from the Special Fund resources \nof  ADB,  with  a  maturity  term  of  32  years  and  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears, will be provided. The loan will bear an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n30 June 2015 \n \n31 December 2014 \n\n \nMARD  will  serve  as  the  Executing  Agency.  Implementing  agencies \ninclude the six provinces. \n \n\nThe  central  project  management  unit,  headed  by  a  project  director, \nwill  be  responsible  for  project  coordination,  procuring  all  major \nequipment,  and  distributing  it  to  the  provinces.  Provincial  project \nmanagement  units  will  be  responsible  for  project  implementation  in \nthe provinces. \n \nGoods  and  services  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  TA  and \ncofinancing  partners  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  Goods,  civil  works,  and  materials  will  be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding  when  valued  at \nmore  than  $1  million  equivalent,  or  by  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  when  valued  below  $1  million \nequivalent.  Goods  and  materials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  may \nbe procured through shopping, and those valued at less that $10,000 \nequivalent through direct contract. To commence the Project on time, \nADB has approved, at the Government\u2019s request, advance action for \nprocurement.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of \nadvance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  part  of  the \nProject. \n \n\n\fv\n\nthe \n\nthat  constrain \n\nThe Project will contract 5,101 person-months of consultant services. \nThis level of input is necessary to allow for the efficient and effective \nshift  away  from  a  state-dominated  forest  sector  and  will  include  153 \nperson-months of international consultants and 4,948 person-months \nof  national  consultants.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  a  single \npackage from a firm, using quality- and cost-based selection. \n \nThe  Project  will  address  (i)  the  absence  of  technically  sound  and \nsocioeconomically  responsive  forest  governance  and  sustainable \nmanagement  plans  and  (ii)  institutional,  management,  and  market \nfailures \nfull  and  effective  participation  of \ncommunities  and  private  sector.  At  full  development,  the  project \nplantations  will  increase  production  incrementally  by  more  than \n300,000  cubic  meters  annually,  and  total  natural  forest  asset  value \nwill  likely  increase  from  $4.4  billion  to  $6.4  billion.  The  Project  will \nprovide  clear  forest  use  and  management  rights  to  households  and \ncommunities  by  allocating  forestland,  and  the  resulting  security  will \nencourage \nforest  production \nsustainably and profitably. Over 8 years, the Project will generate an \nestimated  minimum  of  23  million  person-days  of  wage-generating \nfor  households,  communities,  and  enterprises. \nopportunities \nCapacity-building activities will create a critical cadre of over 500 well-\ntrained forestry professionals and 1,000 technicians. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  interventions  and  technologies  that  are  well \nestablished  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  forestry  sector  and  so  poses  minimal \ntechnical risks. \n\nin  and  manage \n\ninvest \n\nthem \n\nto \n\nImplementing  the  Government\u2019s  state  forest  enterprise  (SFE)  reform \nis  central  to  rationalizing  forestland  use  roles,  responsibilities,  and \ninvestments. Failure in respect to SFE restructuring will put at risk the \npotential  for  attracting  private  investments  as  well  as  community \nsupport and participation. The following measures incorporated under \nthe  Project  will  mitigate  this  risk:  (i)  a  specific  assurance  from  the \nGovernment to implement the state-owned enterprise reform decrees; \n(ii)  provision  by  the  Project  of  incentives  to  restructured  SFE \nemployees, including training; and (iii) leverage support through state-\nowned enterprise reform of the poverty reduction support credits. \n\nA  demand-driven,  market-oriented  approach \nforest  sector \nmanagement  is  new  to  Viet  Nam  and  risks  undue  government \ninterference.  To  address  this  risk,  demand-driven  and  stakeholder-\nbased  investment  planning  will  be  emphasized  under  the  Project. \nThis  will  also  be  the  focus  of  training  and  building  stakeholder \ncapacity and awareness. \n\nto \n\n \n\n \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  (ii)  a  proposed  administration  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  of  a  grant  to  be \nprovided  by  the  Trust  Fund  for  Forests,  and  (iii)  a  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance  (TA),  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Forests  for  Livelihood \nImprovement in the Central Highlands Sector Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Background and Performance \n\n1. \n\nForest Sector and Sustainable Economic Development \n\n2. \nSixty  percent  of  natural  land  in  Viet  Nam  is  classified  as  forestland,  most  of  which  is \nfound  in  mountainous  areas,  with  the  Central  Highlands  accounting  for  over  30%  of  the \nremaining natural forests and 60% of nation\u2019s domestic timber supply. From 1943 to 1993, Viet \nNam\u2019s forest area suffered a 35% loss, from 14.3 million ha in 1943 to 9.3 million ha in 1993. \nHowever,  recent  years  have  witnessed  a  reversal  of  this  trend,  which  is  attributed  to  national \nreforestation  programs  such  as  5  Million  Hectare  Reforestation  Program  (5MHRP).1 \nMountainous  regions  such  as  the  Central  Highlands  and  forest  areas  are  home  to  ethnic \nminority communities served by poor roads and limited access to social services and markets. \n \n\nTable 1: Forest and Land Area (Viet Nam and Central Highlands) (million ha) \n\n \n\nItem \n\nForest as % of \nTotal \n\u2013 \n58.36 \n33.13 \n28.57 \n4.56 \n\nViet Nam \n\nCentral Highlands \n\nCentral Highlands \nas % of Total \n\n5.95 \n4.10 \n3.20 \n3.00 \n0.14 \n\n18.09 \n21.35 \n29.36 \n31.91 \n9.33 \n\n32.90 \n19.20 \n10.90 \n9.40 \n1.50 \n\nTotal Area \nForestland Area \nForested Land \nNatural Forest  \nPlantation  \n\u2013 = data not available. \nSource: National Forest Development Strategy, 2001\u20132010. \n \n3. \nThe forestry sector in Viet Nam is mainly concerned with forest resource protection and \nmanagement and associated harvesting activities. The value of forestry sector output was about \n1.3%  of  national  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2004,  but  this  does  not  take  into  account \ndomestic  processing,  consumption  of  fuel  wood  and  other  timber  products,  and  exports  of \nwood-derived products. The current value of sector output is estimated to be around $1.8 billion, \nwhich  is  5\u20136%  of  national  GDP.  Consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  priority  to  maximize  export \nearnings, exports of wood products increased from $530 million in 2002 to $1.5 billion in 2005. \nThe forestry sector also contributes about 7% of the nation's energy balance, mainly in the form \nof  fuel  wood.  The  role  of  forests  in  watershed  protection  and  biodiversity  conservation  is \nstrongly emphasized in the 5MHRP. \n \nMeeting  the  Government\u2019s  projected  GDP  growth  rate  of  over  7%  in  2005  would  have \n4. \nrequired  about  12  million  cubic  meters  (m3)  round  wood  equivalent  of  wood  raw  material,  but \ncurrent  official  estimates  put  the  annual  supply  at  about  5  million\u20136  million  m3.  The  deficit  is \nbeing  made  up  from  over-harvesting  of  remaining  forests  and  imports,  both  legal  and  illegal. \n\n                                                 \n1  5MHRP, one of the five national programs, was started in 1998 under the Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 661/QD-\nTTg. The program includes 2 million ha of protected and special-use forest (1 million ha of new plantations and 1 \nmillion ha of natural regeneration), and 3 million ha of production forests. \n\n\f2 \n\nThe magnitude of the supply deficit suggests that the remaining forests are under considerable \nthreat  despite  logging  bans  and  official  sanctioning  of  reduced  harvesting.  Poor  forest \nmanagement and over-harvesting have resulted in forest stocks being 25\u201345% below the norm, \ncausing production and productivity losses. Productivity in natural forests and plantations is at \nhalf to quarter of their potential. Wood-processing efficiencies are at 30\u201335%, or far below the \n80\u201390% that is the international industry norm. \n \n5. \nCurrent  domestic  timber  prices  are  below  import  prices  and  are  generally  lower  than \ninternational prices. This suggests that supply is not constrained, despite greatly reduced felling \nquotas, and reinforces the conclusion that a substantial proportion of the supply is coming from \nunofficial sources. \n \nB. \n\nKey Challenges, Lessons Learned, and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Challenges \n\n6. \nViet Nam\u2019s recent success in development, especially in expanding food production and \nmoving  from  rice  deficits  to  the  world\u2019s  second  largest  rice  export  volume,  is  attributed  to  key \nreforms that (i) allocated land to individual farmers and households, (ii) rationalized and reduced \nthe  role  of  the  state  in  the  sector,  (iii)  strengthened  the  technical  and  operational  capacity  of \nstate and other stakeholders, and (iv) increased access to investments and markets. Viet Nam\u2019s \nforestry sector has the necessary policies, laws, and sector strategies in place to replicate the \nagriculture  sector  experience,  but  institutional,  regulatory,  human,  and  technical  capacity  for \nmoving toward a framework of pro-poor and market-friendly governance and incentives is weak \nand,  in  some  cases,  missing.  Consequently,  even  in  the  Central  Highlands,  which  has  the \nhighest potential in the country for forest-based economic development and poverty reduction, \nthe  sector  is  in  serious  decline,  largely  due  to  unsustainable  resource  use  and  exploitation.  A \nkey contributing factor for the poor forest management and performance is the uncertainty over \nforest ownership, management responsibilities, and use rights. \n \n7. \nRationalizing Forestland Ownership, Use, and Management. Rationalizing forestland \nownership, use, and management roles and responsibilities remains a challenge to sustainable \nforest  management.  Slow  progress  has  occurred  in  classifying  forestland,  planning  land  use, \nand allocating land to households, communities, organizations, and non-state enterprises, both \nnationally  and  in  the  Central  Highlands.  Management  regimes  are  based  on  administrative \nconsiderations, not on sound technical criteria. Several national inventories have estimated over \n8  million  ha  of  bare  land  nationally  and  at  least  700,000  ha  of  bare  forestlands  in  the  Central \nHighlands.  But  these  lands  remain  underutilized  because  of  uncertainty  over  use  rights. \nConsidering the poverty and underemployment in rural areas such as the Central Highlands, the \nunderutilization of bare forestlands represents a missed livelihood development opportunity. \n \n8. \nDespite  the  introduction  of  new  land  allocation  policies  since  1993,  economically \ndisadvantaged ethnic minorities have limited influence on forestland allocation and management \ndecisions. High administrative fees for land certificates that document forest ownership and use \nrights further disadvantage the poor. Insufficient funds have been allocated and made available \nfor  timely,  equitable,  and  effective  forestland  classification  and  allocation.  Tenure  and  access \ninsecurity  discourage  local  communities\u2019  taking  a  long-term  stake  in  sustainable  forest \nmanagement,  resulting  in  commune  and  village  forestlands  being  poorly  managed  and \nunderutilized. The consequences include (i) continuous forest encroachment and unsustainable \nharvesting,  (ii)  declining  food  and  livelihood  security  for  poor  communities,  and  (iii)  increased \nforestland conversion. \n \n\n\f3 \n\n9. \nMore than 400 state forest enterprises (SFEs) control large areas (on average 20,000 to \n25,000  ha  each)  of  primary  forestland,  which  were  allocated  during  the  1970s  for  logging  to \nmeet growing post-war timber demand for reconstruction. Since the late 1990s, the harvesting \nquotas of SFEs have been sharply reduced because of concerns about forest degradation and \nworsening flood risks. As a result, many SFEs are no longer commercially viable but still control \nextensive forest areas. Over 100 SFEs with about 3,000 employees control over 1.4 million ha \nof natural forest. \n \n10. \nBecause of failures in forest classification and allocation, necessary financial and human \nresources  are  not  appropriately  allocated  and/or  utilized,  causing  lost  output  potential  and \nexport  earnings,  reduced  domestic  supplies  of  wood  products,  and  the  sector\u2019s  insignificant \ncontribution to poverty reduction. \n \nFragmented Institutions and Insufficient Human Resources. Responsibility for forest \n11. \nresource management, control, and monitoring has been delegated to provinces, districts, and \ncommunes.  But  insufficient  funds  have  been  allocated  to  the  lower-level  institutions  to  recruit, \ntrain, and retain the necessary staff. Institutional arrangements for provincial forest management \nare  fragmented,  despite  specific  regulations  on  who  can  and  should  do  what.  Provincial \nDepartment  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (DARD)  and  forestry  staff  responsible  for \npolicy  and  technical  matters  have  no  administrative  jurisdiction  over  forest  managers  (i.e.,  the \nSFEs), causing regulatory and technical oversight to break down. \n \n12. \nInternal  coordination  is  weak  between  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry,  which  is \nresponsible  for  planning  and  promoting  wood-processing  industries,  and  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD), which is concerned with producing and supplying \nraw material. Similarly, insufficient coordination exists among departments that manage forestry, \nagriculture,  and  water  resources,  so  that  each  sector  agency  strives  to  maximize  its  own \nbenefits without considering the physical and ecological limits to total resource use. \n \n13. \nNo well-trained, professional forestry cadre exists in provinces, allowing new entrants to \nenter at the district or commune level and climb to the provincial level. Recruitment of forestry \nstaff  in  provinces,  districts,  and  communes  does  not  tap  into  a  national  and  provincial  pool  of \neducated  and  trained  forestry  graduates  and  technicians.  Consequently,  the  skills  for  carrying \nout  the  required  forest  planning  and  management  tasks  are  insufficient  in  provinces,  districts, \nand communes. Staffing of the various technical entities in provinces and districts is insufficient \nto  meet  the  extension  needs  and  demands  of  the  community.  Staff  of  provincial,  district,  and \ncommune  institutions  are  not  adequately  trained  to  ensure  equity  for  women  and  ethnic \nminorities. \n \n14. \nInsufficient Investments. The investment in maintaining economically important forest \nresources is only about 3% of the current value of sector output. The Government's investment \nin the sector is driven mainly by 5MHRP, which focuses on protected and special-use forests. \nProduction  forests  to  supply  raw  materials  for  domestic  and  industrial  use  are  expected  to  be \nfinanced by commercial funds. \n \n15. \nAlthough Government policy includes promoting private sector investment in forestry, a \nconducive  investment  environment  has  not  yet  been  created.  Loans  are  available  for  forest \nplantations  and  wood  processing  at  concessionary  rates  (currently  6.24%) \nthe \nDevelopment  Support  Fund,  but  few  enterprises  can  access  it  due  to  uncertainties  over  land \nholdings. The slow progress of land-use planning and allocation creates further uncertainty that \ndrives away potential investors, both domestic and foreign. \n \n\nfrom \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n16. \nLow Technical Knowledge, Information, and Skills Base. The two fundamental pre-\nconditions  for  sustainable  forest  management  are  that  (i)  the  managed  forest  area  be  defined \nwith clear, long-term ownership and management regimes of 50\u2013100 years and (ii) harvesting \ndecisions and levels are based on sound growth and yield information. Since 1990, the Forest \nInventory  and  Planning  Institute  has  established  a  network  of  around  4,000  sample  plots,  but \nbudgetary  and  technical  constraints  have  prevented  this  data  from  being  analyzed  and \npublished, making it unavailable to planners, managers, and investors. In addition, inadequate \ndata  collection  and  analysis  covers  the  processing  industry,  making  it  difficult  to  link  forest \nmanagement regimes and production with specific market segments and end users. \n \n17. \nEthnic minorities, who reside mainly in upland areas, have traditionally practiced shifting \ncultivation,  which  became  unsustainable  as  the  population  grew  and  land-use  conditions \nchanged. But no sustenance or livelihood alternatives have been developed. Demonstrations of \nagroforestry  systems  suitable  for  replacing  shifting  cultivation  have  been  lacking.  Rural \ncommunities\u2019  lack  of  access  to  new,  improved,  and  appropriate  technologies,  combined  with \nundefined local resource governance regimes, have further contributed to their impoverishment, \nas  well  as  to  forest  loss.  These  communities\u2019  skills  and  capacity  need  to  be  developed  for \nsustainable  forest  management,  community-participatory  development,  and  integrated  village \ndevelopment planning. \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nThe  Forestry  Sector  Project2  (FSP)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  faced \n18. \ndelays  in  implementation  and  low  disbursements.  This  was  expected  to  a  certain  extent,  as  it \nwas  the  first  forestry  loan  project  in  the  country  and  MARD  had  limited  experience  with  the \nsector modality and its requirements. Other key lessons include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nto  undertake \n\nThe assumption was misplaced that the Government had the budget and human \nresources  available \nforestland-use  mapping  and  allocation \nnationwide and in the project area within the specified 2 years. \nParticipatory forestland-use and resource planning approaches and technologies \nwere  not  part  of  MARD\u2019s  operational  tool  kit,  so  there  were  no  cost  norms  or \nbudgetary  provisions  in  the  state  budget  for  these  activities.  Correcting  this \nproblem caused a 3-year delay in implementation. \nFund-flow  and  implementation  decision-making  has  to  be  decentralized,  and \nDARD\u2019s  project  accounting,  financial  management,  and  administrative  capacity \nneed to be strengthened. \nEfficient and effective input delivery and management considerations require that \nproject  investments  and  activities  not  be  sprinkled  over  a  lot  of  noncontiguous \nprovinces. \nSmall-scale forestry is not capital intensive but is labor intensive, which is why a \nloan of about $10 million under the Project could deliver the outputs and benefits \nthat were originally estimated to cost $33 million in loans. \nEfficient and sustainable forestry depends on scale, requiring investments at the \ncommune, province, and watershed level to achieve the desired results. \nSix years is too short for implementing forestry projects. \n\n \n19. \n\nOther funding agencies\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 experience indicates the following: \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  1997.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nSocialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Forestry  Sector  Project.  Manila.  (Loan  1515\u2013VIE,  approved  in  February \n1997) \n\n\f5 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ninstitutional, \n\nImplementing  national  forest  sector  reform  to  restrict  the  state\u2019s  role  in  forest \nmanagement  and  allow  others  to  dominate  production  forest  development  will \nrequire sustained technical and financial inputs over the next 10 years. \nUnder  given \ntechnological,  social,  and  market  conditions, \ndecentralized  and  collaborative  forest  resource  management  is  the  optimal \noption for instituting sustainable forest management in Viet Nam. \nTimely and effective implementation of large-scale investment projects requires \nthat governance, capacity, and market failures be dealt with in a comprehensive \nand integrated manner. \nTo improve fund delivery and disbursements, decentralized financial instruments \nsuch as block grant funding mechanisms should be used. \nInstituting  sustainable  forest  management  will  require  the  full  and  effective \nparticipation of local communities and the formal private sector. \nSustainable  plantation  forestry  is  an  economically  viable  and  environmentally \nsound option for combining sustainable forestry with livelihood improvement. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\n20. \nClear  Sector  Development  Priorities  and  Policy  Directions.  The  Government\u2019s \nForest  Development  Strategy  (2001\u20132010)  and  sector  plans  call  for  making  forestry  an \nimportant  economic  sector  by  (i)  protecting  and  developing  forest  resources  and  increasing \nforest cover from the current 32% to 43% by 2010, (ii) achieving an annual growth rate of over \n3.5%  during  2006\u20132010,  (iii)  accelerating  and  completing  forestland  allocation  under  the  Land \nLaw  and  the  revised  Forest  Protection  and  Development  Law,  (iv)  using  forestry  to  improve \nlivelihoods  and  reduce  poverty  in  chronically  poor  mountainous  areas  dominated  by  ethnic \nminorities; and (iv) increasing the efficiency and value of country\u2019s wood-processing industry. \n \n21. \n5MHRP  explicitly  calls  for  (i)  allocating  forestland  to  organizations,  households,  and \nindividuals with emphasis on hunger elimination and poverty reduction; (ii) increasing people\u2019s \ninvolvement in forestry; (iii) expanding protected forests in important watersheds; (iv) promoting \nthe  use  of  bare  land  for  generating  employment  and  reducing  poverty;  and  (v)  increasing  the \nproductivity  of  natural  forests  and  plantations  to  meet  anticipated  future  demand  for  forest \nproducts. \n \n22. \nThe Government has a benefit-sharing policy in place that requires increasing benefits to \nhouseholds and individuals involved in forest protection, management, and reforestation. These \npolicies  cover  both  allocated  forestland  and  areas  managed  under  contract  by  households  or \nindividuals, including protected, special-use, and production forests. This creates an opportunity \nfor the expanded participation of communities and the non-state sector. \n \nSFE  restructuring  requires  SFEs  that  manage  mainly  production  forests  to  operate  as \n23. \nproductive  business  entities.3  This  allows  rationalizing  and  redefining  the  state\u2019s  role  in  the \nforestry sector. It also removes a major barrier to private sector and community participation. \n \nForest lease laws allow forestland leasing of both protected forests for ecotourism and \n24. \nproduction  forests  to  Vietnamese  residing  abroad,  foreign  organizations,  and  individuals.  This \nprovides  the  right  conditions  for  the  participation  of  national  private  sector  as  well  as  foreign \ninvestors. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  Decision  No.  187/1999/QD-TTg  and  Politburo  Resolution  No.  28QD/TW  of  June  2003  provide  for  renovation  of \n\nSFEs. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n25. \nHigh Potential for Forestry and Poverty Reduction. The Central Highlands region is \ncurrently  the  most  important  in  Viet  Nam  for  forestry,  with  timber  stock  valued  at  about  $4.4 \nbillion  at  current  prices.  It  encloses  about  30%  of  the  country\u2019s  forest  area  and  supplies  over \n60%  of  the  country\u2019s  annual  hardwood  consumption.  Ecological  conditions  in  the  Central \nHighlands  are  ideal  for  forestry.  The  terrain  is  generally  easy,  making  commercial  forestry \nfeasible and potentially efficient. Population densities are still low compared with other regions \nin  Viet  Nam.  Currently,  infrastructure  is  a  constraint  as  major  domestic  and  regional  wood \nproduct  markets  are  more  than  200  kilometers  (km)  away.  But  roads  are  improving,  and  this \nshould  improve  market  access.4  Moreover,  existing  processing  capacity  faces  worsening  raw \nmaterial shortages, which will raise market demand. \n \n26. \nThe  Central  Highlands  have  over  3  million  ha  of  forest,  but  about  half  of  it  is  seriously \ndegraded, requiring investments to restore its condition and productivity. Sound management of \nforests, including planting bare land with high-yielding native and exotic species, can meet over \n70%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  2010\u20132015  domestic  timber  demand.  Accordingly,  the  draft  2006\u20132010 \nsocioeconomic  development  plan  identifies  the  Central  Highlands  as  Government  priority \nregion,  and  forestry  as  a  priority  sector.  It  seeks  to  increase  wood  product  exports  from  $1.5 \nbillion  in  2005  to  $3.5  billion  in  2010.  Central  Highlands  forests  will  have  to  make  a  major \ncontribution if these targets are to be achieved sustainably. \n \n27.  More than half of the 5 million people living in the Central Highlands are in the workforce, \nbut only about 11% are in wage-earning occupations, indicating high unemployment, particularly \nin the chronically poor ethnic minority communities. Most of the rural poor and unemployed live \nnear forests and have basic skills and knowledge relevant  to forestry.  Systematically and fully \nengaging these communities and the unemployed in the forest resource planning, management, \nproduction,  and  processing  provides  a  win-win  opportunity  for  sustainable  forestry  and \nlivelihoods. \n \nThe  Government  aims  to  reduce  poverty  from  52%  in  2005  to  about  38%  by  2010. \n28. \nForestry is to play a major role in meeting this target by contributing to the regional GDP growth \nrate of 8\u20138.5%. Currently, SFEs and provincial management boards employ over 12,000 people \nincluding  contract  laborers.  Lower  forest  harvests  and  the  resulting  reduction  in  wood \nprocessing put their livelihood at risk. But, as they are skilled and semiskilled in some forestry \npractices, the Project can provide alternative job opportunities. \n \n29. \nIncreasing  Funding  Agency  Commitment  and  Emerging  Opportunities. \nGovernment and the Forest Sector Support Program and Partnership (FSSP) provide resources \nfor  developing  a  sector-wide,  programmatic  approach  to  forest  sector  investments.5  The  Trust \nFund  for  Forests  (TFF),  supported  by  FSSP,  helps  mobilize  substantial  grant  financing  for \ncapacity-building activities necessary to improve the management capacity and performance of \nthe  sector. Carbon  sequestration  and  trading  under  the  clean  development  mechanism  create \nadditional  cash-transfer  opportunities  to  communities  living  in  or  near  forests.  Furthermore, \naccessing the Global Environmental Facility-funded Viet Nam Conservation Fund will reduce the \nGovernment\u2019s  start-up  costs  for  protecting  regionally  and  globally  significant  biodiversity \nhotspots found in the Central Highlands. \n \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Central  Region  Transport  Network. \n\nManila. \n\n5  On 12 November 2001, the Government of Viet Nam and 20 representatives from various aid agencies, including \nADB  and  the  World  Bank  and  social  and  environmental  nongovernment  organizations,  signed  the  FSSP \nmemorandum of agreement. \n\n\f7 \n\n30. \nRegional  Synergies  and  Cooperation.  The  Central  Highlands  forest  ecosystem \nstraddles  the  Cambodian  and  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  border,  providing  watershed \nprotection  to  rivers  draining  into  the  Mekong  and  feeding  into  the  Tonle  Sap  in  Cambodia. \nMoreover,  the  conservation  of  these  forests  will  be  central  to  successfully  implementing  the \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Biodiversity  Conservation  Corridors  Initiative  (BCI).6 \nCorrespondingly, GMS economic corridor development will increase the market catchment and \naccess for project products and services. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nApproach, Impact, and Outcome \n\n31. \nA  participatory  approach  to  diagnosis  and  design  involving  multiple  stakeholders  has \nbeen adopted for developing the project proposal.7 Project preparation identified the need for an \nintegrated  approach  to  making  the  forestry  sector  market  oriented.  This  is  necessary  if  the \ncountry\u2019s goal of becoming a fully market-oriented and modern economy is to be achieved and \nthe  sector  is  to  (i)  meet  the  country\u2019s  growing  demand  for  wood  products  for  domestic \nconsumption  and  export,  (ii)  help  reduce  poverty  in  remote  areas,  and  (iii)  enhance  and \nmaintain  forestry-related  environmental  services.  To  achieve  these  sector  objectives  in  an \nenvironmentally  sound  and  socially  equitable  manner,  adopting  a  sector  modality  is  both \ndesirable and feasible. Because forestry investments have to be responsive simultaneously to \nthe needs of many stakeholders and to the socio-ecological conditions of specific locations, the \ntraditional  blueprint  approach  to  development  and  investment  planning  is  inadequate  to  meet \nthe sector\u2019s many goals. \n \n32. \nFurthermore,  as  summarized  in  paragraphs  20\u201324  and  28,  Viet  Nam  has  (i)  a  well-\ndefined forest sector strategy, development, and investment plan; (ii) the necessary policy and \nregulations  in  place;  and  (iii)  the  necessary  institutional  capacity  to  implement  a  sector  loan. \nAccordingly, based on the analysis of the key challenges affecting sector performance, lessons \nlearned,  and  opportunities  identified,  the  Project  takes  a  program  and  geographic  slice  of  the \ncountry\u2019s forest sector development plan as encapsulated in the Forest Development Strategy \n(2001\u20132010) and FSSP. \n \n33. \nInvestment packages and project interventions and implementation arrangements have \nbeen  developed  using  a  participatory  planning  approach.  The  sample  core  subproject  of  Lam \nDong  and  the  seven  sample  communes  were  developed  using  this  approach.  A  similar \napproach  will  be  used  in  designing  and  implementing  the  remaining  five  subprojects  and  53 \ncommune  investment  plans  (CIPs).  Over  8  years,  project  implementation  will  cover  six \nprovinces  (subprojects)  in  the  Central  Highlands  involving  over  60  communes.  Province  and \ncommune  selection  criteria  require  that  they  (i)  have  rich  forests  with  significant  but \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2004.

The outputs of these analyses have \ninformed  the  Government\u2019s  revision  of  the  2001\u20132010  Forest  Sector  Strategy,  2006\u20132010  forest  sector \ndevelopment plan, and formulation of this project proposal. This analysis has been complemented by the findings \nof  ADB.  1999.

The  type  and  scale  of  forestry \ninterventions in each of the subprojects are similar and so are expected to replicate the financial \nand economic viability of the sample Lam Dong subproject. The Project will be implemented by \nprovinces in collaboration with project area households, communities, and forestry teaching and \ntraining institutions. \n \n34. \nThe Project proposes an investment package with the primary purpose of increasing the \nforest capital of the county and improving its developmental and poverty-reduction performance. \nIt includes investments in areas that are critical for transforming the sector, i.e., business capital, \nhuman  capital, \ninfrastructure,  knowledge  capital,  and  stakeholder \ninstitutional  capacity.8  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Viet  Nam  Development  Goals  (VDGs, \nare  national  level  equivalent  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals)  of  poverty  reduction  and \nenvironmental protection by accelerating the market-orientation of the country\u2019s forestry sector.9 \nIt will do so by (i) improving the condition and value of Central Highlands forests, (ii) eliminating \nhunger and halving poverty among 80,000 of the country\u2019s poorest households living in or near \nthese forests, (iii) improving the protection of globally significant biodiversity, (iv) enhancing the \nprotection  and  performance  of  critical  watersheds,  and  (v)  attracting  investors  to  invest  in  the \nsector. The specific outcome of the Project is to enable the Government to bring over one-third \nforest \nof  country\u2019s  poorly  and  mismanaged  natural \nmanagement and secure over 70% of national timber needs in 2010\u20132015. \n \nB. \n\nforest  estates  under  sustainable \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nforestry-related  rural \n\n35. \nThe  Project  consists  of  four  components:  (i)  sustainable  forest  resource  management \nand  development,  (ii)  livelihood  improvement,  (iii)  capacity  development,  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement  and  implementation.  Sustainable  forest  resource  development  and  management \ninvestments focus on provinces and communes; livelihood improvement forestry investments on \nover  60  selected  communes;  business  and  capacity  development  investments  on  relevant \nstakeholders  such  as  state  agencies,  communities  and  communes,  and  small  and  medium \nenterprises  (SMEs)  and  entrepreneurs;  and  project  management  and  capacity-building \ninvestments on provinces, districts and communes to ensure timely delivery of funds, inputs and \noutputs. \n \n\n1. \n\nSustainable Forest Resource Management and Development \n\n36. \nForest Land Management Planning. The main purpose of this investment is to secure \nover $4.4 billion worth of forest and timber assets and future benefits by clarifying, establishing, \nand protecting forestland property and the use rights of the state, households, communities, and \nother  stakeholders.  Building  on  completed  land-use  maps  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources  and  Environment,  and  using  a  participatory  approach \ninvolving  multiple \nstakeholders, the Project will support upgrading strategies for provincial land and forestland use \nin  accordance  with  the  new  Land  and  Forest  Protection  laws.  This  will  include  rationalizing \nforest management objectives and regimes in provinces, districts, and communes. It will provide \nthe  enabling  governance  and  incentive  framework  for  accelerated  and  equitable  forestland \nallocation,  restructuring  of  SFEs,  and  multi-stakeholder  and  multiple-use  sustainable  natural \n\n                                                 \n8  This  is  consistent  with  the  six  capital  bundles  of  a  well-functioning  economy  or  sector  and,  thereby,  for  sound \n\neconomic and sector development investments (Jeffrey Sachs. 2005. The End of Poverty. Penguin Books.) \n\n9  Consistent with the Government\u2019s socioeconomic development plan 2001\u20132005 and ADB. 2002. Country Strategy \nand Program (2002\u20132004): Viet Nam). Manila; it is included in ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update \n(2005\u20132006): Viet Nam. Manila. \n\n\f9 \n\nforest  and  plantation  development  and  management.  Six  provincial  sustainable  forest \nmanagement plans will be prepared and, once approved by the provincial people\u2019s committees, \nwill become the business plans for the forestry sectors in project provinces. \n \n37. \nactivities under this component: \n\nInvolving  over  3  million  ha  of  production  forests,  the  Project  will  support  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nforest  zoning  and  identifying  production  clusters,  for  which  the  Project  will \nsupport forest resource management planning and zoning based on geographic \ninformation systems (GIS) in provinces, districts, and communes; \nforest  delineation,  surveying,  and  demarcation  for  clearly  and  permanently \ndefining  forest  boundaries,  irrespective  of  land  ownership  and/or  management \nregimes; and \nforest inventory and management planning, for which the Project will support the \npreparation  of  detailed  forest  management  plans  for  over  3  million  ha  in \nconsultation  with  participating  stakeholders.  This  will  minimize  conflicts  over \nforestland  use  and  management  and  achieve  economies  of  scale  in  terms  of \nproject management, production, and marketing. \n\n \n38. \nForest  Resource  Development.  The  purpose  of  these  investments  is  to  improve  the \nmanagement of existing commune and village forests, and bring underutilized bare land under \nhigh-yielding  productive  plantations  of  native  and/or  exotic  species.  The  Project  will  support \nforest  management  improvements  such  as  enrichment  planting  and  improved  protection  for \nforest  resources  under  village  and/or  community  ownership  in  60  selected  communes. \nInvestments will aim to increase the extent of plantation forests and improve their condition and \nproductivity. Involving over 80,000 households, this will bring over 144,000 ha of commune and \nvillage  forests  under  sustainable  forestry,  including  over  30,000  ha  of  livelihood  plantations \nestablished  on  bare  lands.  Given  the  low  creditworthiness  and  lack  of  access  to  affordable \nfinancing  in  the  project  area,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  the  investments  will  be  shared  in \naccordance with the equity models identified and developed during project preparation. \n \n39. \nIn addition to defining and delineating protected and special-use forests, the Project will \nfacilitate the conservation of three high-priority global biodiversity areas covering over 87,000 ha \nunder  the  Viet  Nam  Conservation  Fund  and  the  GMS  BCI.  Project  activities  will  include \nparticipatory biodiversity assessments and monitoring. This will provide increased wage-earning \nopportunities for the local communities and, at the same time, improve their development skills \nin numeracy and community organization. \n \n40. \nBusiness  Development.  The  Project  will  support  business  development  opportunities \nfor  such  entities  as  SMEs  and  reformed  and  restructured  SFEs.  This  will  improve  forest \nresource use and processing efficiencies, strengthen supply and markets chains, and add value \nto  forest-based  goods  and  services.  The  Project  will  provide  support  to  at  least  three  SFEs \nundergoing  restructuring  within  the  overall  framework  of  public  sector  and  state  enterprise \nreform.  The  Project  will  support  market  diversification  by  helping  to  establish  at  least  20  new \nSMEs  and  providing  marketing  support  to  about  75  community  groups  and  over  40  existing \nSMEs.  It  will  support  piloting  of  modern,  efficient  woody  biomass\u2013conversion  technologies  to \nincrease  the  efficiency  of  using  wood  as  fuel  in  project  communes.  To  capture  emerging \nresource  mobilization  and  marketing  opportunities,  the  Project  will  support  pilot  measures \npromoting  clean  development  mechanisms  and  technologies  that  contribute  to  innovative \nfinancing for forest ecosystem conservation and services. \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n2. \n\nLivelihood Improvement \n\n41. \nThe  Project  will  support  livelihood  improvement  and  income  generation  in  60  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  poorest  communes  by  establishing  commune  development  funds  (CDFs).  Using  an \nequity model, 70% of the income from household and commune forestry activities will go to the \nparticipating households and 30% to the revolving fund established under each CDF. CDFs will \ngive  priority,  but  will  not  be  restricted,  to  forestry-related  income-generating  and  livelihood-\nimprovement  investments  in  communes  and  villages.  Support  for  small-scale  infrastructure \nimprovement will include constructing and upgrading health posts, class rooms, drinking wells, \nsmall  irrigation  systems,  inter-village  and  commune  access  roads,  and  commune  cultural \nhouses.  These  investments  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  CIPs.10  Over  80,000 \nhouseholds,  and  over  144,000  ha  of  village  and  commune  forests,  will  benefit  from  these \ninterventions.  CDFs  will  use  a  bottom-up  participatory  planning  approach  to  allow  communes \nand  communities  to  determine  project  investment  priorities  and  activities.  Reinvesting  30%  of \nrevenues in the CDF will contribute to making Project investments financially self-sustaining and \nreduce  dependence  on  external  sources.  CDF  management  will  also  empower  local \ncommunities,  including  ethnic  minorities  and  women,  by  increasing  their  capacity  and \nopportunity to participate in decision making. In addition to these commune-based activities, the \nProject  will  actively  involve  local  communities  in  forest  demarcation,  inventorying,  and \nmonitoring.  These  activities  will  provide  additional  opportunities  for  income  generation  in  local \ncommunities in the early stages of project implementation. \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Development \n\n42. \nThe  objective  is  to  build  the  relevant  stakeholders\u2019  technical,  management,  and \nmonitoring  capacity  at  central,  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels.  This  will  catalyze  the \ntransition  of  the  state-dominated  forest  management  regime  toward  a  non-state  and  market-\nfriendly  one.  The  Project  will  support  strengthening  (i)  forest  planning  and  management \ndecision-support systems, (ii) collaborative and community-based forest resource development \nand  management,  (iii)  decentralized  financial  and  administrative  decision  making  and  project \nimplementation, (iv) effective extension delivery, and (v) institutional capacity in communes and \ndistricts. Key interventions include training staff, providing equipment to provide extension, and \nenterprise support services to communities, households, and SMEs. Particular emphasis will be \nplaced  on  strengthening  capacity  in  communes,  especially  of  ethnic  minority  groups,  to \nadminister and manage a CDF. The Project will support and facilitate upgrading teaching staff at \ntwo forestry institutions responsible for educating and training foresters and forestry technicians. \nIt  will  also  support  training  and  upgrading  the  skills  of  over  550  professional  staff  and  about \n1,000 technicians. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Management and Implementation \n\n43. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  MARD\u2019s  project  management  and  implementation  capacity \ncentrally  and  provincially,  financing  the  necessary  office  equipment  and  supplies  for  project \nimplementation.  To  overcome  Government  staff  constraints  without  increasing  the  long-term \nbudgetary  burden  on  the  Government,  the  Project  will  contract  administrative  and  support \npersonnel  for  efficient  and  effective  implementation  and  monitoring  of  project  activities.  Under \nTA,  a  consulting  firm  will  be  contracted  to  help  MARD  implement  the  Project,  in  particular \npreparing  a  forest  resource  management  plan,  decentralizing  commune  investment  planning \n                                                 \n10 CIPs were prepared for seven sample communes spread over the six provinces, and these provide the template for \nscaling up and replication in the remaining 53 communes. The indicative investment size and decision criteria are \nidentified and agreed with the Government. These will be detailed in the project implementation manual prepared \nby the project preparatory TA consultants and will be finalized within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \n\n\f11 \n\nand  implementation,  supporting  social  and  ethnic  minority  development,  and  ensuring \ncompliance with Government and ADB guidelines. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nClustering.  Project  activities  and  commune  clustering  will  (i)  maximize  synergies \n44. \nbetween  sustainable  forestry  and  livelihood  improvement  for  poverty  reduction,  especially \namong ethnic minority communities; (ii) facilitate the efficient delivery of material and extension \ninputs  and  project  supervision;  and  (iii)  achieve  critical  production  thresholds  to  catalyze  the \ndevelopment of market chains and enterprises. \n \n45. \nCollaborative  Resource  Management  and  Decentralized  Implementation.  The \ninvolvement  of  primary  stakeholders  and  other  non-state  actors  in  forest  management  and \nProject  implementation  will  help  overcome  the  Government\u2019s  human  resource  capacity \nconstraints,  improve  transparency,  and  empower  rural  communities.  In  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s decentralization policies, the 5-year commune investment plans will be approved \nby provincial people\u2019s committees, but yearly investment plans and budgets will be approved by \ndistrict people\u2019s committees. Commune people\u2019s councils will approve investments of up to D1 \nbillion.11 \n \nPerformance-Based Allocation. Project fund allocation will be based on the timely and \n46. \nefficient utilization of funds and disbursements by project provinces. Consistent with the sector \nmodality,  the  provincial  and  physical  targets  are  indicative.  Provincial  fund  allocation  will  be \nadjusted in project years 2, 4, and 6 to take into account fund utilization and disbursements by \nproject provinces. Funds from underperforming components and/or provinces will be reallocated \nto better-performing components and/or provinces. \n \n47. \nGIS-Based  Landscape  Approach.  Consistent  with  state-of-the-art  conservation  and \nforestry  practices,  the  Project  uses  the  landscape  approach  and  GIS  technology  for  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring impact. \n \n48. \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Emerging  Resource  Mobilization  Opportunities:  The \nProject  will  strengthen  Viet  Nam\u2019s  contribution  to  regional  cooperation  in  environmental \nmanagement by improving the protection of critical watersheds and biodiversity of importance to \nneighboring countries such as Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and to the \nlarger  global  community.  It  will  maximize  synergies  with  the  GMS  economic  cooperation \nprogram  and  BCI.  It  will  help  Viet  Nam\u2019s  forestry  sector  attract  substantial  foreign  direct \ninvestment and capture the new funding opportunities from carbon trading and ecotourism.  \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n49. \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $90.66  million  equivalent,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  during  implementation.  Component-specific  cost \nestimates are in Table 2, and the detailed project cost estimate is presented in Appendix 4. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 Existing  Department  of  Finance  guidelines  for  decentralizing  budget  management  will  be  adopted  for  project \nimplementation. Administrative and financial management arrangements are to ensure that disbursement is done \nwithin  30  days  of  completing  work  under  the  Project.  The  Project  will  undertake  capacity  building  and  provide \ntechnical assistance to provinces, districts, and communes to support this objective. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nAmountsa \n\n \n\nItem \nBase Costb \nA. \n1.

MARD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU), \nheaded  by  a  project  director,  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating,  monitoring,  and  providing \nquality  control  and  advisory  services  to  provinces  during  implementation.  The  CPMU  will  be \nresponsible  for  procuring  all  major  equipment  and  distributing  it  to  implementing  agencies. \nProvincial project management units (PPMU) under the provincial DARD will be responsible for \nproject  implementation  in  the  provinces.  Facilitated  and  supported  by  the  CPMU  and  PPMUs, \nMARD and provincial authorities will meet at least twice in a year to jointly review and endorse \nthe  project  annual  plan  of  operations.  The  central  Project  Steering  Committee  (CPSC)  will  be \nestablished  by  MARD.  The  CPSC  will  be  headed  by  a  Vice-Minister  of  MARD  and  will  have \nrepresentatives from concerned agencies from concerned agencies and provinces. The CPSC \nwill  be  responsible  for  providing  guidance  and  Project  oversight  to  ensure  objectives  of  the \nProject as outlined in this Loan Agreement are achieved. Provincial steering committee (PPSC) \nheaded by the leader of the relevant people's provincial committee leader will be established to \noversee Project implementation at the provincial level. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 8 years from October 2006 to 31 December 2014. \n52. \nProject activities are sequenced across provinces and in communes in accordance with project \nplanning and the implementation capacity of Government staff and local communities. Starting \nin project year 1, CIPs will be prepared on a rolling basis with funds flowing within 3 months of \nplanning  phase  completion  and  as  approved  by  appropriate  provincial  authorities.  Procuring \nmajor  equipment  will  take  place  in  the  first  year.  The  implementation  schedule,  outlining  the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  six  provincial  forest  management  plans  and  CIPs,  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nADB  has  approved  advance  action  for  procurement  of  goods  and  recruitment  of \n53. \nconsultants.  MARD  will  take  advance  procurement  action  to  expedite  Project  implementation \nparticularly office equipment and supplies for the CPMU. All supplies, equipment and services \nfinanced from the ADB loan, technical assistance and ADB-administered grants will be procured \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines.  Goods,  works,  and  materials  will  be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than  $1 \nmillion equivalent, or by national competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB, where the \ncost is valued below $1,000,000 equivalent. Goods and materials valued at less than $1 million \nand  $10,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  through  shopping  and  direct  contracting  respectively. \nThe Government has been advised that approval of such advance action does not commit ADB \nto finance any part of the Project. The procurement plan is outlined in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n54. \nThe  Project  will  require  153  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n4,948  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  In  addition,  staff  will  be  contracted  as \nneeded  to  develop  commune  capacity  for  sustainable  forest  management  and  livelihood \ndiversification.  This  level  of  input  is  necessary  to  efficiently  and  effectively  shift  the  state-\ndominated  forest  sector  (over  a  third  of  the  country\u2019s  natural  forest  estate)  toward  non-state \nmanagement.  Under  TA,  international  and  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  a  single \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\npackage  from  a  consulting  firm,  using  ADB  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  through  a  full \ntechnical  proposal  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Contracted \nstaff and/or NGOs with relevant experience will be recruited by MARD in consultation with ADB \nand  in  a  manner  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  national  staff  recruitment.  Appendix  7 \nsummarizes consulting services. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nliquidated \n\nreplenished,  and \n\n55. \nThe  CPMU  will  use  ADB  imprest  account  procedures  for  eligible  project  expenditures. \nAn  imprest  account  for  the  loan  will  be  established  by  the  CPMU  at  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable to ADB within 1 month of loan effectiveness. The account will have a ceiling of $2.5 \nmillion;  the  initial  deposit  will  be  based  on  estimated  expenditures  for  the  first  6  months  of \nproject  implementation  or  $2.5  million,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nestablished,  managed, \nDisbursement Handbook, as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements agreed by \nthe  Government  and  ADB.  Statement-of-expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  for  reimbursing \neligible expenditures and liquidating advances to the imprest accounts to ensure speedy project \nimplementation. The maximum payment for any individual item using statement of expenditure \nis $100,000. \n \nTo  expedite  fund  flows  to  the  provinces  and  national  institutes,  each  province  will \n56. \nestablish  a  second-generation  imprest  account  (SGIA)  if  necessary  for  the  grant  proceeds  or \nlocal equivalent for the loan proceeds, at commercial banks acceptable to ADB. The CPMU will \ntransfer  funds  from  the  imprest  accounts  to  the  SGIAs  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. The \ninitial amount to be deposited into each of the SGIAs will not exceed the equivalent of 6 months\u2019 \nestimated expenditures or $250,000, whichever is lower. The ceiling for SGIAs will not exceed \n$250,000. Project financial management and supporting documents will be in accordance with \narrangements acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n6. \n\nFinancial Management, Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nFinancial  Management.  MARD  is  currently  implementing  five  ADB  loan  projects, \n57. \nincluding  the  FSP.  It  has  implemented  forestry  loan  and  grant  projects  funded  by  the  World \nBank  and  other  development  partners  amounting  to  over  $380  million  and  demonstrated  the \nfinancial-management capacity necessary to manage a large, externally financed project. It has \nmaintained  a  number  of  first  and  second  generation  imprest  accounts  and  has  submitted \nrequired audits in a timely fashion. Based on the experience of ADB and others with MARD, the \nfinancial management arrangements are appropriate. \n \nAccounts  and  Auditing.  The  Government  will,  through  MARD,  maintain  adequate \n58. \nrecords  and  accounts  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  Project.  The  CPMU  will \n(i) keep project accounts separate from regular accounts; (ii) maintain separate accounts for the \nloan and grant portions of the Project; (iii) ensure accounts and financial statements are audited \nannually  in  a  timely  fashion,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  by  external \nauditors acceptable to ADB; and (iv) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of \neach  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  (including  the  imprest  accounts, \nstatements of expenditure, and financial statements), the auditor\u2019s reports and opinions, and the \n\n\f15 \n\nmanagement  letter,  together  with  a  report  of  actions  taken  by  MARD  to  improve  the  financial \nmanagement system. The Project will finance the cost of auditing.12 \n \n59. \nAnticorruption.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \nMARD. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nReporting \n\n60. \nAfter  the  Project  becomes  effective,  MARD  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports \nsummarizing  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  (ii)  delays  and  problems \nencountered  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  issues,  (iii)  compliance  with  loan  assurances  and \ncovenants,  (iv)  a  proposed  program  of  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  next  6  months, \n(v) expected  progress  during  the  succeeding  period,  and  (vi)  the  status  of  participating \nprovinces  and  institutions.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment will prepare and submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n61. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  conduct  reviews  of  the  Project  at  least  twice  a  year  to \nensure  smooth  implementation.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a  midterm \nreview after 3 years of physical implementation. The midterm review will (i) review the Project\u2019s \nscope, design, implementation arrangements, and other relevant issues; (ii) examine progress \ntoward  the  Project\u2019s  objectives  and  output;  (iii)  assess  implementation  performance  against \nprojections and identify changing needs for resource allocation; (iv) review compliance with loan \ncovenants; \nformulate  appropriate \nrecommendations for corrective action. \n \n\nidentify  problems  and  constraints;  and \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Sustainability \n\nOne of the major objectives of the Project is to improve the productivity of forest sector in \n62. \nthe Central Highlands and its contribution to poverty reduction. MARD and ADB have identified \na  shortlist  of  verifiable  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  that  are  incorporated  in  the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 3). In addition, the Project will promote beneficiary-\nbased  impact-monitoring  regimes  developed  under  the  ongoing  FSP.  Putting  in  place  and \nstrengthening a decentralized forest-resource and financial-management regime is necessary to \nensure  the  post-project  sustainability  of  assets  created  by  the  Project.  CDFs  will  play  an \nimportant role in ensuring that sufficient operational budgets are available for this purpose. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n63. \nAdvisory TA is required to provide the Government with technical and advisory support \nfor  extending  the  proposed  sustainable  resource  development  and  management  in  the  forest \n                                                 \n12 ADB.

The total cost of \nTA is estimated at $7.82 million equivalent, with cofinancing of $7.57 million from TFF and the \nremaining $0.25 million from ADB.13 TA objectives, scope, cost, financing, and outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 7. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\nPro-Poor  and  Market-Friendly  Sector  Governance.  The  Project  will  address  (i)  the \n65. \nabsence of technically sound and socioeconomically responsive forest management plans and \n(ii)  institutional,  management,  and  market  failures  that  constrain  the  full  and  effective \nparticipation of the private sector, both formal and informal, in forestry. Removing these barriers \nwill facilitate mobilizing much-needed human and financial resources from non-state sectors. It \nwill  also  increase  the  efficiency  of  public  sector  forestry  investments,  which  so  far  have \nunderperformed because of insufficient forest planning and management capacity. The Project \nwill help secure over 3 million ha of natural forests with a current value of $4.4 billion and bring \nmanagement of over 1.5 million ha of natural production forests in line with international market \nrequirements  and  certification  standards.  Timber  asset  value  is  expected  to  increase  to  $6.4 \nbillion over the project life of 40 years, instead of reducing to $2.8 billion, as it would without the \nProject.  Stakeholder-specific  cost-  and  benefit-sharing  options  and  arrangements  have  been \nidentified to ensure the efficient use of project funds and equitable sharing of project benefits. \nThis will improve governance and the transparency of financial transactions. \n \nImproved Sector Performance and Competitiveness. By allocating long-term, secure \n66. \nownership  or  usufruct  rights,  providing  forest-management  and  agroforestry-extension  advice \nand  financial  support,  and  developing  appropriate  infrastructure,  the  Project  will  encourage \nprivate  sector  investment  in  a  range  of  new  or  restructured  and  diversified  enterprises  for \nproduction  and  the  effective  utilization  of  forest  resources.  It  will  also  strengthen  forest  sector \ninstitutions  to  enable  them  to  provide  long-term  forest  management  capacity  building  to  both \nstate  and  private  enterprises.  The  focus  on  strengthening  private  sector  production  and \nmarketing  mechanisms  will  increasingly  meet  domestic  and  international  market  demand  for \nsustainably  harvested  domestic  forest  resources,  thereby  curtailing  illegal  logging  and \nexpensive imports. \n \n67. \nImproved Livelihoods and Reduced Poverty. Allocating land to individual farmers and \nhouseholds has significantly contributed to Viet Nam\u2019s transition from rice deficits to the second \n\n                                                 \n13 TFF was established in December 2003. The governments of Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland are \n\nthe main contributors to the fund. \n\n\f17 \n\nlargest volume of rice exports in the world. The Project will facilitate a similar transformation of \ncountry\u2019s forest sector, especially in the Central Highlands. Less than 1% of forestland has been \nallocated so far to households and communities. The principal social benefit from the Project will \nbe  the  provision  of  clear  forestland-use  rights  to  households  and  communities  through  the \nallocation of forestland, and the resulting security will encourage them to invest in and manage \nforest production and protection sustainably and profitably. More direct, quantifiable benefits will \nderive from employment generation by households, communities, and enterprises. The Project \nwill have a significant impact by providing opportunities for long-term employment either through \nowner-operated  forest  production  or  employment  in  forest-based  enterprises.  Project  forest \nplanning and management activities will directly create at least 23 million person-days of wage-\ngenerating  opportunities  for  semiskilled  and  underemployed  rural  residents.  Under  the  equity-\nsharing models for household forestry, in the first year of implementation, the Project will ensure \nat  least  $110  in  additional  income  to  households.  This  additional  cash  income  will  allow \nhouseholds  to  overcome  3\u20135  month  food  deficits  and  eliminate  hunger.  In  addition  to  cash \nincome  from  labor  wages  during  the  first  6  years,  households  will  realize  a  revenue  share  of \nabout $1,100/ha in year 8. \n \n68. \nEnhanced Social and Gender Equity. The equitable allocation of land and clear rights \nover its use will help ethnic minorities in the project area participate effectively in forest-based \neconomic  activities  and  reduce  income  disparities.  Poor  households  will  acquire  economic \nopportunities  other  than  shifting  cultivation,  thereby  reducing  forest  loss.  The  Project  will \npromote  the  participation  of  women  in  forest  production  and  management  through  focused \ncapacity building and training. For this purpose, the Project will seek to recruit one female staff \nmember  in  each  provincial  project  implementation  office  in  one  of  three  key  areas  of \nspecialization: forestry, farming systems, and community development. \n \n69. \nIncreased  Revenue  Generation,  Natural  Forest  Assets  and  Value,  and  Wood \nProduction. In the scenario without the Project, the total growing stock in the natural production \nforests of the Central Highlands is expected to decline from the present 100 million m3 to about \n75  million  m3  by  2045.  With  the  Project,  the  estimate  is  about  135  million  m3.  Thus  the  total \ngrowing  stock  is  expected  to  be  60  million  m3  higher  40  years  from  now  as  a  result  of  the \nProject. With a project investment of about $12 million for improving natural forest management \nand $60 million in maintenance costs over 40 years, the asset value is expected to increase to \n$6.4  billion.  Under  the  proposed  management,  over  40  years  the  natural  forest  area  has  the \npotential  to  generate  incremental  wood  yield  valued  at  $44  million  (net  present  value  at  10% \ndiscount  rate).  At  full  development,  the  Project\u2019s  livelihood  plantations  will  have  an  annual \nproduction value of over $3.6 million. Annual Government revenues from natural resource taxes \non livelihood plantations and natural forest management alone are expected to average $1.86 \nmillion  in  2006\u20132010  and  about  $2  million  in  2011\u20132015.  This  revenue  will  increase \nsubstantially  if  the  envisaged  private  sector  investments  are  realized.  The  revenue-generating \ncomponents described above do not include the value of biodiversity conservation or watershed \nservices the forests provide. A financial evaluation of candidate revenue-generating investments \nfor  the  sample  subproject  was  undertaken  in  real  terms,  using  constant  2005  prices.  The \nfinancial analyses of selected plantation models indicate a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nof 12\u201317%, whereas longer rotations of 15\u201340 years have FIRRs of 9\u201315%. Sensitivity analysis \nwas carried out for a combination of yield classes (12, 16, and 20 m3/ha/year), daily wage rates \n(D35,000,  D30,000,  and  D25,000),  and  distance  to  market  (50,  100,  150  km).  The  financial \nrates  of  return  for  50  and  100  km  vary  from  13%  to  27%.  For  more  than  150  km  and  a  daily \nwage rate of D35,000, it varies from 1% for yield class 12 to 8.2% for yield class 20, indicating \nthat returns are most sensitive to distance to market. These rates of return compare favorably \nwith the weighted average cost of project capital. \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n70. \nCombining Environmental Protection and Poverty Reduction. The sector's ability to \nachieve the national goal of placing 43% of its land area under forest cover, and of protecting \nthe  environment  and  maintaining  habitats,  is  clearly  under  serious  threat  despite  the  recorded \nincrease in forest area through reforestation. Delineating and demarcating the remaining natural \nforest  areas  into  special-use,  protected,  and  production  management  blocks  or  zones,  with \nclearly  defined  management  roles  and  responsibilities,  will  strongly  help  stem  habitat \ndegradation.  The  Project  will  specifically  address  biodiversity  conservation  by  supporting  the \nprotection  of  over  99,000  ha  of  natural  forest  and  facilitating  improved  management  of  over \n87,000 ha of globally significant biodiversity area. In addition to providing sustainable supplies of \nnon-wood forest products, these activities will increase opportunities for the local poor to earn \nwages and develop social capital. \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional, Economic, and Environmental Risks \n\n71. \nThe  Project  will  support  interventions  and  technologies  well  established  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nforestry  sector,  with  minimal  technical  risks.  Project  interventions  will  secure  and  enhance \nindigenous people\u2019s access to forest resources without causing any involuntary restrictions on \nland use or access to resources. \n \nSFE  reform  is  central  to  rationalizing  roles,  responsibilities,  and  investments  in  using \n72. \nforestlands. Failed SFE restructuring would put at risk the potential for attracting private sector \ninvestments and community support and participation. The following measures will mitigate this \nrisk:  (i)  a  specific  assurance  from  the  Government  to  implement  SOE  reform  decrees;  (ii) \nprovision by the Project of incentives to restructured SFE employees, including training; and (iii) \nthe coordination with FSSP partners and through SOE and/or SFE reform performance trigger \nin the poverty reduction support credits to leverage support. \n \n73. \nA demand-driven, market-oriented approach to forest sector management is new to Viet \nNam  and  risks  undue  government  interference.  The  demand-driven  aspect  will,  however,  be \nfacilitated  by  the  Project\u2019s  emphasis  on  participatory  management,  which  will  be  the  focus  of \ncapacity  building,  training,  and  awareness-building  consultations  and  workshops.  These \nactivities  will  contribute  to  the  growth  of  forest  and  agroforestry  SMEs  and  the  long-term \nsustainability of project outcomes. \n \nBusiness  or  technical  risks  exist  if  householders  and  enterprises  do  not  attain  the \n74. \nrequired  skills \nforest  utilization  and \nmanagement.  The  Project\u2019s  investment  in  long-term  capacity  building  in  the  forest  sector  will \nhelp to mitigate this risk. \n \n75. \nFailure to provide adequate income-earning opportunities to absorb labor affected by the \nrestructuring of SFEs may increase poverty and illegal felling in the project area. To mitigate this \nrisk, SFE restructuring will include retraining for job opportunities created by increased forestry \nand processing activities in the non-state sector. \n \n76. \nA  risk  exists  that  worsening  supply  deficits  and  poverty  will  increase  illegal  logging, \nmaking sustainable forest management less attractive and profitable in the short run. This risk \nwill be managed by increasing the access and stake of households, communities, and the state \nsector in the forests, so that they see the long-term benefits of sustainable forestry. The Project \nwill  also  involve  the  Ministry  of  Industry  in  sector  discussions  so  that  developing  forest \nprocessing enterprises stays in line with supplies of raw materials. \n\nthe  returns  expected \n\nto  achieve \n\nimproved \n\nfrom \n\n\f19 \n\n77. \nPotential  environmental  risks  include  (i)  soil  erosion  during  forest  harvesting  and \nplanting, (ii) water contamination from fertilizer and pesticide use, (iii) the use of lands suitable \nfor natural forests for plantations, and (iv) minor impacts from constructing village infrastructure. \nThe  Project  recommends  the  necessary  mitigation  measures  together  with  specific  staff  and \nbudgetary  resources  for  implementing  internationally  recognized,  sustainable  forestry  and  risk \nmanagement  regimes  to  avoid  or  minimize  these  impacts.  Environmental  assessment  and \nreview  procedures  have  been  prepared  to  ensure  environmental  compliance  in  subproject \nselection. A sector environmental analysis was carried out, and the findings suggest that long-\nterm and cumulative impacts are largely beneficial. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MARD  will  give  the \n\n78. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nWithin  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MARD  will  approve  a  detailed  project \nimplementation  manual  with  clear  definitions  of  roles  and  responsibilities  of \ndifferent line agencies and stakeholders and guidelines on technical, operational, \nand financial administration and management of the Project. \nThe  central  and  provincial  authorities  will  ensure  to  make  timely  requests  for \ncounterpart  funds  to  be  appropriated  in  the  central  and  provincial  budget  for \nactivities for the first and subsequent project years. \nBy  30  June  2008,  harvesting  and  transit  rules  governing  wood  and  wood \nproducts  as  stipulated  in  Decision  No.  40/2005/QD-BNN  dated  7  July  2005  will \nbe reviewed and if necessary revised to ensure unhindered access to markets for \nwood  and  wood  products  harvested  by  villages  and  communes  under  the \napproved management plans set up under the Project. \nBy 31 December 2008, provincial timber harvesting quotas and harvesting plans \nwill  be  based  on  the  results  of  the  forestry  inventory  and  growth  and  yield \nassessments carried out under the Project. \nBy 31 December 2008, SFE's role and functions in the project provinces will be \nbrought  in  line  with  the  sustainable  forest  management  administrative  and \nmanagement regimes developed by the Project. \nBy  30  June  2009,  MARD  and  project  provincial  authorities  will  approve  SFE's \nplans and submit respective proposals to the Government requesting permission \nto implement these plans. \nThe Government will ensure that adequate budget will be made available on an \nannual  basis  to  the  project  provinces  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the \nproject  facilities  and  government-employed  staff  at  the  provincial,  district,  and \ncommune level. \n\n(viii)  The  Government,  through  MARD,  will  ensure  that  project  activities  comply  with \napplicable  laws  and  regulations  of  Viet  Nam;  ADB  environment  policies  and \n(2002);  environment \nregulations,  specifically  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \nassessment  and \ninitial  environmental \nthe  summary \nexamination; and environmental monitoring plan as set out in the summary initial \nenvironmental examination for preparing initial environmental examination for the \nremaining project provinces. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  livelihood  improvement \nand ethnic minority development plan prepared for the Project in accordance with \napplicable  government  policies  and  procedures  and  ADB  policies,  specifically \n\nreview  procedures, \n\n(ix) \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  This  includes  ensuring  equal \nopportunities for ethnic minority communities and staff in training, and integrating \ncultural sensitivities in project implementation. \nIn  the  unforeseen  event  of  involuntary  resettlement  as  defined  by  ADB\u2019s  policy \non involuntary resettlement, MARD will inform ADB and, prior to proceeding with \nthe  particular  activity,  prepare  resettlement  planning  documents  for  review  and \napproval by ADB. \nThe Government will ensure that the Project\u2019s gender action plan is implemented \nand that equal access to project and training opportunities are provided for men \nand  women.  Women  will  make  up  at  least  a  quarter  of  commune-level  project \nstaff. Forestland allocation certificates will be for women and men with joint titles \nas per the Land Law of 2003. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  forestland  tenure  rights  are  consistent  with \nforest  and  plantation  harvesting  cycles  to  ensure  project  primary  stakeholders \nrights to harvest wood and non-wood forest products at maturity. \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n79. \nThe  following  are  specified  as  additional  conditions  to  the  effectiveness  of  this  Loan \nAgreement for the purposes of Section 9.01(f) of the Loan Regulations: (i) MARD and relevant \nGovernment  authorities  will  have  issued  decisions  providing  clear  guidelines  for  Project \nimplementation and financial allocations; (ii) the Borrower will have established the CPMU and \nPPMUs  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  with  necessary  staffing  including  full  time  qualified \naccountants;  and  (iii)  the  Borrower  will  have  received  the  confirmation  of  the  Trust  Fund  for \nForests that the TFF Grant will be made available for the purpose of the Project. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n80. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 30,486,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Forests for Livelihood Improvement in \nthe Central Highlands Sector Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with \nan  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; \nthe administration by ADB of grant not exceeding the equivalent of $8,000,000 to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to be provided by the Trust Fund for Forests; \nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent \nof $7,570,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Forests for Livelihood \nImprovement in the Central Highlands Sector Project to be provided by the Trust \nFund for Forests on a grant basis; and \nIf  the  Board  approves  the  proposals,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by \nthe Board, will approve ADB providing the balance of the technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $250,000 for the Project. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 October 2006 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FORESTRY SECTOR \n\nForest Sector Support Program and Partnership \n\n \n1. \nCurrent  external  assistance  to  the  forestry  sector  is  estimated  at  over  $400  million \nequivalent, and there are at least 21 development partners contributing over $1 million. Among \nthese,  the  most  prominent  are  Asian  Development  Bank,  Australia,  Canada,  Denmark, \nEuropean  Union,  Finland,  Global  Environment  Facility,  Germany,  International  Development \nAssociation of the World Bank, Japan, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Forest  Sector  Support  Program  and  Partnership  (FSSP)  is  a  broad  framework  for \ncollaboration  between  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  over  24  international  development \npartners now working in the forestry sector. The FSSP memorandum of agreement includes 15 \nbasic  principles  of  collaboration  agreed  among  the  partners  and  a  program  framework  that \nspecifies indicative performance standards for the broad goal, focused objective, and purpose, \nas well as specific activities under nine result areas. \n \n\nTable A1.1: Forest Sector Support Program Result Areas \n\nResult Area  Specific Activities \n1 \n2 \n3 and 4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n\nCollaborative planning and monitoring of strategic developments \nPolicy, legal, and institutional frameworks \nMacro and micro land-use planning \nState forest enterprise reform \nSustainable forest management planning and implementation \nSustainable use and conservation of indigenous flora and fauna \nResearch, training, and extension \nMarketing and processing \n\nTrust Fund for Forests \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3. \nThe  FSSP  program  framework,  with  its  nine  result  areas, will  likely  be  replaced  by  the \nforthcoming  national  forest  strategy  (NFS,  2006\u20132020),  as  the  key  document  for  collaborative \nsupport and implementation by both national and international partners. \n \nB. \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  Trust  Fund  for  Forests  (TFF)  is  a  grant  facility  established  in  June  2004  to \n4. \nsupport pro-poor and sustainable approaches to forest management, and a transition towards a \ncomprehensive sector-wide approach for development and cooperation in the forest sector. By \npooling  resources  from  several  funding  agencies  into  one  fund,  TFF  will  provide  a  more \neffective means of supporting key sectoral priorities, which are agreed and updated annually by \nthe FSSP partnership. \n \n5. \nFinland, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland have pledged to contribute around \n$28 million to the fund in 2004\u20132007. Moreover, the German Government has provided MARD \nwith  technical  assistance  to  help  manage  the  fund  through  the  project  Reform  of  the  Forestry \nAdministration System. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nTable A1.2: Trust Fund for Forests Funding \n($) \n\nFunding Source \n\nEarmarked \n\nGeneral \n\nTotal \n\n6,019,047 \n \n5,000,000 \n \nIn kind \n\n4,815,238 \n1,203,809 \n7,307,020 \n3,800,000 \n \n\n10,834,285 \n1,203,809 \n12,307,020 \n3,800,000 \n \n\nThe Netherlands \nSwitzerland  \nFinland \nSweden \nGermany (GTZ) \nGTZ = Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) (German Agency for Technical Cooperation). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTwo  technical  advisors  have  worked  with  the  FSSP  coordination  office  and  relevant \n6. \nministries since November 2004 to develop TFF regulations and operational procedures, launch \noperations,  and  build  capacity  to  manage  the  fund.  In  2004,  the  FSSP  Technical  Executive \nCommittee  approved  five  small  TFF  grants  totalling  \u20ac200,000.  Currently,  the  committee  is \nappraising  two  proposals  for  full  projects.  Work  will  commence  in  2005  on  developing \nbenchmarks for sectoral budget support. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nTotal investment in the sector, according to the Forestry Development Strategy (FDS) in \n1999, was around D1.185 trillion, equivalent to around $76.5 million, of which 85%, or around \n$65 million, was for silviculture. However, an ADB-funded study (TA 3255\u2013VIE) on Forest Policy \nand  Institutional  Framework  suggests  that  expenditure  in  1999  was  only  D314  billion,  or  $22 \nmillion. Table A1.3 below summarizes the current relationship between planned targets, actual \nareas planted, and expenditure. \n \n\nPast Investment Levels in the Sector \n\nTable A1.3: Targets, Actual Areas Planted, and Expenditure on Plantations \n\n \n\nYear \n\nTarget Area to be \nPlanted Annually \n(ha) \n500,000 \n\nReported Area \nPlanted Annually \n(ha) \n \n\nReported/Required \nAnnual Expenditure \n($\u2019000) \n300,000 \n\nAverage Cost per \nHa \n($) \n600a  \n\nPlanned 1999\u20132005 \n(FDS) \nActual 1999 (FDS) \nActual 1999 (TA \n3255\u2013VIE) \nFDS = Forestry Development Strategy, ha = hectare, TA = technical assistance. \na  Based on current cost norms for plantations establishment. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n311,000 \n311,000 \n\n \n \n\n65,000 \n22,000 \n\n209 \n70 \n\n8. \nThe funds provided for investment are insufficient to achieve the planted area targets set \nin the 661 Program and the FDS. The apparent actual investment for planting 1 hectare (ha) is \n12\u201330% of the current cost norm for plantation establishment. Part of this difference may that \nsome  of  the  labor  is  provided  unpaid  in  return  for  a  share  of  future  benefits  and  is  not  being \nvalued.  However,  low  investment  is  almost  certainly  a  major  contributory  factor  to  the  poor \nperformance of the plantations established. Only about 3% of the value of current output from \nthe forestry sector is being invested in maintaining this important economic resource. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n23 \n\nPROBLEM TREE ANALYSIS \n \n \n\nUnderperforming forestry sector resulting in slower economic growth, leading to \nsuboptimal poverty reduction \n\nForegone  \nGovernment \nrevenues and \nenterprise \nprofits \n\nDelayed \nimplementa-\ntion of \nsector \nactivities \n\nForegone \nrural \nlivelihood and \nemployment \nopportunities \n\nInadequate \nforest \nresource base \nto meet \nnational needs \n\nUnderdeveloped \nand \nunproductive \nplantations and \nprocessing \nindustry \n\nPoor forest resource management \n\nLack of \nfunds and \ncumbersome \nprocedures \n\nWeak \ninstitutional \ncapacity at \nlower levels \n\nRestrictive \npolicy and \nregulatory \nframeworks \n\nLack of unified system \nfor managing sectoral \ndata and indicators of \nsector performance \n\nLack of appropriate \ntechnology for \nresource manage-\nment and utilization \n\nLand \n\n\u2022 Slow progress of \n\nallocation of \nforestland to \nhouseholds, \ncommunities, \norganizations, and \ncommercial \nenterprises in some \nprovinces  \n\u2022 Forestland \n\ndominated by state \nforest enterprises \n(SFEs) \n\n\u2022 Micro-level land \nclassification \nincomplete \n\u2022 Large areas of \ndenuded and \nunderutilized \nforestland \n\n\u2022 Inappropriate land \n\nallocation \nprocedures \n\n \n\nInstitutions\n\n\u2022 Insufficient staff \nand funds to \nhandle delegated \nresponsibilities \n\u2022 Weak planning \n\nand management \nin district, \ncommunes, and \nSFEs \n\n\u2022 Cumbersome \ncentralized \napproval system  \nfor releasing funds\n\u2022 Gender and social \n\ninequity \n\n\u2022 Lack of forestry \n\nextension services \nin poor communes\n\u2022 Weak coordination \nbetween industry \nand resource \nplanning \n\nPolicy Instruments\n\u2022 Poor investment \nenvironment and \nincentives for \npotential \nbeneficiaries  \n\u2022 Inconsistent cost \n\nnorms \n\n\u2022 Poor follow-up on \n\ncentral Government \nregulations in  the \nprovinces \n\u2022 Inappropriate \nregulations on \nmanagement by \nforeign residents \n\nData \n\u2022 Inadequate  data \non land capability \n\u2022 Insufficient  data \non plantation \nyield and \nproduction \nforecasting \n\n\u2022 Inadequate  data \non forest product \nmarkets and \nconsumption \nInadequate data \non forest-based \nlivelihoods \n\n\u2022 Inadequate  data \n\non forest \nproducts \nprocessing \ncapacity   \n\u2022 Inadequate \nfinancial \nresources \n\nTechnology\n\n\u2022 Overly \n\nconservative \nmanagement of \nnatural forests \n\u2022 Poor use of best \n\navailable \ntechnology for \nplantations \n\u2022 Low plantation \nproductivity \n\u2022 Insufficient \n\ntechnology for \nvalue addition \n\u2022 Minimal use of \n\nmodern \ntechnology for \nsurveying and \nmapping \n\n\u2022 Poor seedling \nproduction and \nmanagement \ntechnology \n\nNational \n \nImpacts \n \n\nSector \nImpacts \n\nCore \nSector \nProblem \n\nMain \nCauses \n\nDeficient \nSector \nOutputs \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \n\u2022  Provincial and district \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  Stable socioeconomic \n\nstatistics \n\n\u2022  Project baseline data \n\nand monitoring reports \n\n\u2022  Evidence from \n\nprovincial cadastral \noffices \n\n\u2022  National forest and \npoverty surveys \n\nenvironment \n\n\u2022  Prices for agricultural \nand forest produce \nremain favorable \n\u2022  Timely fund-flow and \nbudget allocations \n\n \n\n24 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact  \nImproved forest productivity \nand livelihoods and reduced \npoverty in the Central \nHighlands \n \n \n\nOutcome  \nState-owned and other \nforests sustainably managed \nin the Central Highlands. \n \n\nOutputs \n1.

Villages  of  the  Central  Highlands  are  largely \npopulated  by  indigenous  or  other  minority  groups.  The  livelihoods  development  and  ethnic \nminorities  development  plan  (LIEMDP)  is  formulated  as  a  time-bound  program  to  ensure  that \nethnic minority groups living in 60 communes in the six provinces of the Central Highlands will \nbenefit from project interventions, which aim to improve forestland allocation and management \nto  reduce  poverty  and  improve  livelihoods  in  the  area.  The  LIEMDP  is  based  on  detailed \nanalyses  of  poverty,  ethnicity,  and  livelihoods  in  the  project  area  in  general  and  in  sample \ncommunes  in  particular.  It  is  expected  to  have  beneficial  impacts  upon  approximately  65,000 \nmembers of ethnic minorities and other poor households in approximately 6,000 villages in the \n60 communes selected. \n \n \n \n2. \nTaken as a  whole, the  northwest and the Central Highlands are the poorest regions in \nthe country. According to the Vietnam Development Report 2004,1 the Central Highlands stand \nout  because  of  their  limited  progress  in  poverty  reduction  over  the  past  4  years  and  because \nfood  poverty  in  this  central  region  has  remained  unchanged  for  the  past  decade.  The  report \ngoes on to predict that the overall poverty rate for Viet Nam in 2010 will be 21%, and that 37% \nof that figure will be ethnic minority people. Indeed, more recent times have seen an increase in \nthe Central Highlands poverty rate due to the collapse of coffee prices, a sharp drop in pepper \nprices, and the lack of a diversified local production base. The LIEMDP is a central document \nfor  project  design,  presenting  the  strategy  that  will  drive  poverty  reduction  in  targeted \ncommunities  throughout  the  Central  Highlands.  The  LIEMDP  is  based  upon  extensive \nparticipatory  beneficiary  consultations  in  the  target  provinces.  In  terms  of  its  replicability,  the \nLIEMDP  is  generic  and  the  main  strategies  will  remain  the  same.  Only  the  specific  income-\ngenerating  activities  adopted  by  different  communities  are  expected  to  vary,  as  will  some \ninternal implementation arrangements. \n \nThe objective of the LIEMDP is to provide an enabling environment in which a suitable \n3. \nstrategy  and  appropriate  mechanisms\u2014replicable  in  most  if  not  all  of  the  137  poor  forest \ncommunes in the Central Highlands\u2014to ensure sustainable livelihood improvement and access \nto  benefits  for  the  target  communities.  The  LIEMDP  has  been  formulated  such  that  most \nbeneficiaries belong to indigenous and other minority groups. \n \n4. \nPoverty  in  Viet  Nam  is  measured  in  a  variety  of  ways,  depending  upon  the  agency \nconcerned.  The  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA)  uses  a  measure  of \nhousehold income per capita as follows for 2001\u20132005: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nin highland and mountainous areas, per capita income of less than D80,000 per \nmonth or D960,000 per year; \nin  flat  rural  areas,  per  capita  income  of  less  than  D100,000  per  month  or \nD1,200,000 per year; and, \n\n                                                 \n1 2003. Joint Donor Report to the Vietnam Consultative Group Meeting. Ha Noi. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n(iii) \n\nin  urban  and  peri-urban  areas,  per  capita  income  of  less  than  D150,000  per \nmonth or D1,800,000 per year. \n\n \n5. \nThe Government Statistics Office published a comparative view of the spatial incidence \nof poverty in 1993, 1998, and 2002. All regions of Viet Nam are compared against three poverty \nmeasures: overall poverty rate, food poverty rate, and poverty gap. According to this report, the \nCentral  Highlands  region  has  the  second  worst  incidence  of  overall  and  food  poverty  and  the \nsecond highest poverty gap of all regions. In fact, the figures suggest that poverty reduction in \nthe  Central  Highlands  has  lagged  behind  that  of  other  regions,  as  it  declined  from  third  to \nsecond  worst  ranking  for  overall  poverty  between  1993  and  2002.  A  recent  study\u2014funded  by \nNew  Zealand\u2019s  International  Aid  and  Development  Agency  (NZAID)  in  collaboration  with  the \nInter-Ministerial  Poverty  Mapping  Task  Force,  International  Food  Policy  Research  Institute, \nInformation  Center  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  and  Institute  of  Development \nStudies\u2014used  combined  data  from  the  1998  Vietnam  Living  Standards  Survey  and  the  1999 \nPopulation  and  Housing  Census  to  map  national  poverty  by  commune.  Although  the  analysis \ndiffers  significantly  from  MOLISA  estimates  of  poverty,  the  study  confirms  that  the  poorest \nregions are the remote areas of the northwest, upland areas of the north-central coast and the \nnorthern part of the Central Highlands.2 \n \n6. \nAccording to this analysis, Dak Lak, Lam Dong, and Phu Yen are among the better-off \nprovinces in the country, while Gia Lai and Kon Tum are among the poorest. Phu Yen and Lam \nDong are not generally regarded as Central Highlands provinces, but both are contiguous to the \nproject area and have some districts in the upland and highland areas. Again, these upland and \nhighland  areas  are  inhabited  mainly  by  minority  communities,  and  their  socioeconomic  well-\nbeing  is  significantly  worse  than  conditions  in  lowland  areas.  Although  there  are  undoubtedly \nmany poor Kinh (mainstream Vietnamese) households in the Central Highlands, ethnic minority \nhouseholds are  more  likely  than  Kinh  to  be  poor.  Poverty  in  the  selected  areas  of  the  Central \nHighlands  is  marked  by  landlessness,  periods  of  food  and  cash  deficit,  illiteracy,  and  lack  of \naccess  to  forestland  and  forest  resource  exploitation.  The  poor  suffer  high  illiteracy  among \npeople above school age, particularly in indigenous communities. People lack savings or capital \nfor  investing  in  better  production  technology  and  also  lack  awareness  and  knowledge  of  the \noptions available. Population growth in the Central Highlands has been dramatic, mainly due to \nthe migration of Kinh into the area. In 1998 only 4% of Viet Nam\u2019s population lived in the Central \nHighlands, but by 2002 this figure had risen to 6% and, over the same period, the percentage of \nethnic minorities in this population decreased from 45% to 39%. This in-migration can also help \nexplain  the  rise  in  poverty  in  the  Central  Highlands  over  recent  years,  as  poor  and  perhaps \nlandless Kinh migrate into the area hoping to obtain cheap or government-allocated land. \n \n \n \nAlthough the Central Highlands are the richest region in terms of forest resources, only \n7. \n3% of the income of Central Highlands dwellers comes from forestry. Local households\u2019 forestry \nactivities have been limited mainly to forest planting and care under contract. Also interesting is \nthat  the  Central  Highlands  contain  almost  50%  of  the  national  area  of  destroyed  forest, \npresumably due to slash-and-burn, shifting cultivation. Although now illegal, it is still practiced by \nthose  with  no  other  land  resources.  Field  studies  confirmed  that  most  of  the  forestland, \nespecially  areas  with  good  forest  reserves  in  the  Central  Highlands,  is  owned  by  state  forest \nenterprises  (SFEs).  All  the  forest  area  that  has  been  allocated  to  the  villagers  is  poor.

Washington,  DC: \nInternational Food Policy Research Institute. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n39 \n\nsurvey  clearly  shows  that  the  forest\u2019s  potential  to  benefit  those  living  nearby  has  not  been \nproperly  exploited.  The  issuance  of  land-use  certificates  is  still  very  limited,  and  this  slow \nprogress has affected households\u2019 capital mobilization for production. \n \nThe  Government  has  promulgated  many  different  policies  and  regulations  to  facilitate \n8. \nrural development and poverty reduction, but they have been implemented with varying degrees \nof  success.  The  Government  has  also  made  serious  attempts  to  create  an  appropriate  legal \nenvironment  to  facilitate  implementation  of  its  policies  and  programs.  The  Land  Law  of  2003 \nprovides for allocating long-term land-use rights to individuals, households, and communities of \nVietnamese  living  in  the  same  villages  and  hamlets,  or  with  similar  customs  and  practices,  or \nwith the same descents.3 This would allow assigning long-term land-use rights to ethnic minority \nand indigenous tribal communities. \n \n9. \nThe 2001\u20132005 Five-Year Plan and Fundamental Solutions for the Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  of  the  Central  Highlands.  This  plan  was  approved  through  Decision \n168/2001/QD  on  30  October  2001  and  is  particularly  relevant  to  the  Project.  It  applies  to  the \nCentral  Highlands  provinces  Dak  Lak,  Gia  Lai,  Kon  Tum,  and  Lam  Dong,  seeking  to  facilitate \ndynamic  development  with  a  high  but  sustainable  growth  rate  while  protecting  ecological  and \nenvironmental resources. It aims to raise living standards and the quality of life in remote areas \ninhabited by ethnic minorities and other areas that encounter significant difficulties. It also hopes \nto build a strong and transparent political system and an equitable society. \n \n \n \nSpecific  mention  is  made  of  the  need  to  improve  and  stabilize  the  living  standards  of \n10. \nethnic minorities in a manner that is compatible with their customs. The Comprehensive Poverty \nReduction  and  Growth  Strategy  aims  to  reduce  poverty  by  creating  new  and  improved \nopportunities  for  poor  people  to  take  part  more  fully  in,  and  gain  more  benefit  from,  ongoing \nsocioeconomic reform and development. \n \n\nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nGovernment of Viet Nam Agencies Responsible for Poverty Reduction and \nEthnic Minority Development \n\n \n11. \nThe most immediately relevant agencies involved in rural community and ethnic minority \ndevelopment are the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Committee for Ethnic and \nMinority Affairs, MOLISA, Vietnamese Women\u2019s Union, education, and health. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nIn  recent  years,  some  community-based  forestry  initiatives  have  been  piloted  through \nfunding  agency  assistance  programs  such  as  the  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation \n(GTZ)  Dak  Lak  project.  These  experiences  indicate  that  conditions  required  for  successful \ncommunity-based management include the following: \n\nCommunity Forestry and Forest Land Allocation, Experiences, and Issues \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nLand allocation processes should be decided by the community. These need to \ntake  into  account  community  traditions,  traditional  boundaries,  village  social \ncomposition, earlier experiences with social forestry, and access to markets. \nBenefit  realization  is  fundamental  to  providing  incentives  for  protecting  forests. \nBenefits  should  be  available  to  those  receiving  forestland  and  to  others  in  the \ncommunity.  Benefit-sharing  policies  that  result  in  uniform  sharing  of  benefits \nneed to be developed within the community. \n\n                                                 \n3 Official Gazette Nos. 228\u2013229 (28/12/2003). \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n(iii)   Community forest rules need to be developed and agreed by all members of the \ncommunity (and adjacent communities) and include penalties for noncompliance. \nAccess  to  capital  and  technical  and  marketing  advice  is  needed  to  ensure \nmaximum benefits are realized from the allocated forestland and that incentives \nto protect it are also maximized. \n\n(iv) \n\n1. \n\nResults of Participatory Appraisals Carried out in Sample Communes \n\n \n \n \nBased  on  the  lessons  above,  the  LIEMDP  has  been  developed  on  the  basis  of \n13. \nparticipatory  enquiries  held  with  the  indigenous  and  other  ethnic  minorities  in  the  course  of \nproject preparation. \n \nOverall  Conclusions  from  Field  Studies.  Poverty  in  the  areas  studied  is  patterned \n14. \nthematically  across  communities  such  that  effectively  tackling  poverty  reduction  and  livelihood \nimprovement  requires  addressing  these  thematic  issues  in a  strategic manner.  To  prescribe  a \nlist  of  investments  without  building  a  mechanism  within  the  target  communities  to  build \nempowerment  and  the  capacity  to  address  poverty  reduction  needs  locally  would  be  a  design \noversight. \n \n15. \nAccess  to  Forests,  Forest  Land,  and  Agricultural  Lowland.  Ethnic  minority  groups \ntraditionally  live  in  or  on  the  borders  of  forested  areas  and  survive  by  hunting,  collecting  non-\ntimber  forest  products,  and  cultivating  various  crops.  They  were  denied  access  to  these \nlivelihood resources when forested land was passed to SFEs. In reality, they have received very \nlittle  land.  The  allocation  of  agricultural  land  to  households  and  forested  land  to  communities \nmust take place.  \n \n16. \nCultures,  Traditions,  and  Religious  and  Behavioral  Differences.  These  must  be \ntaken  into  consideration  when  designing  interventions  and  their  implementation  to  ensure  that \nthey are appropriate.  \n \nAccess  to  Services,  Technology,  and  Capital.  These  communities\u2019  access  to \n17. \ntechnology  or  services \nisolation,  poor  roads  and \ncommunications,  illiteracy,  and  lack  of  cash  and  savings  for  investment.  Heads  of  household, \nparticularly  in  middle  and  lower  socioeconomic  groups,  are  generally  illiterate  in  the  Kinh \nlanguage. The community suffers from poor delivery of education and health services. \n \n18.  Minority  communities  hold  very  few  assets  or  farming  tools  and  are  inexperienced  in \nintensive agriculture, which is necessary on small flatland plots and home gardens. Agricultural \nextension services are ineffective. \n \nFarming systems are very basic and extensive, with low inputs. Yields are low, and no \n19. \nprocessing  is  done  to  add  value.  Most  ethic  minority  members  are  basically  subsistence \nfarmers,  and  some  still  engage  in  slash-and-burn,  shifting  cultivation,  although  this  is  illegal. \nLivelihood insecurity is a big problem. \n \n20. \nEthnic  Minority  Participation.  The  goal  of  the  LIEMDP  is  to  reduce  the  incidence  of \npoverty  and  improve  food  security  among  ethnic  minority  communities  who  form  the  poorest \nsections of the population in the project area. \n \n21. \nThe  immediate  objective  is  to  increase  the  benefits  of  forest  management  and  use  by \ngrassroots communities, in partnership with state and other agencies, to improve the livelihoods \n\nis  constrained  by \n\ntheir  geographic \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe intended beneficiaries are ethnic minority and other poor households, communities, \n\nof  forest-dependent  communes  in  the  60  target  communes  in  the  selected  provinces.  These \ncommunes are taken from the MOLISA list of the 137 poorest communes in the six provinces. \nEthnic  minorities  occupy  shares  of  the  population  of  these  communes  ranging  from \napproximately 50% to 100% and suffer poverty rates of 40\u201360% and higher. These communes \nalso have productive forestlands available for allocation under the Project. \n \n22. \nand village and commune forest protection boards. \n \n \n \n \n \n23. \nForestland  Management  Planning.  Using  a  participatory  approach  involving  multiple \nstakeholders, the Project will support upgrading provincial land and forestland use strategies in \naccordance  with  the  new  Land  and  Forest  Protection  laws.  This  will  include  rationalizing \nforestland use objectives and management regimes in provinces, districts, and communes. The \nProject  will  provide  the  enabling  governance  and  incentive  framework  for  sustainable  natural \nforest and plantation development and management, the restructuring of SFEs, and accelerated \nand equitable forestland allocation. \n \n24. \nactivities under this component: \n\nCovering  over  3  million  ha  of  production  forests,  the  Project  will  support  the  following \n\nSustainable Forest Resource Development and Management \n\na. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nRegarding  forest  zoning  and  identifying  production  clusters,  the  Project  will \nsupport provincial, district, and commune forest resource management planning \nand zoning based on geographic information systems (GIS). \nIt  will  lead  the  delineation,  surveying,  and  demarcation  of  forests  to  clearly  and \npermanently  define  forest  boundaries,  irrespective  of  land  ownership  and/or \nmanagement regimes. \nRegarding  forest  inventory  and  management  planning,  the  Project  will  support \nthe  preparation  of  detailed  forest  management  plans  for  over  3  million  ha,  in \nconsultation with participating stakeholders. This will minimize forestland use and \nmanagement  conflicts  and  achieve  economies  of  scale  in  terms  of  project \nmanagement,  as  well  as  of  production  and  marketing.  Sustainable  forest \nmanagement  plans  will  be  approved  by  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  and \nbecome the business plan for provincial forestry. \n\n \n25. \nThe Project will address one of the fundamental issues of both forest management and \npoverty  reduction  in  the  Central  Highlands:  forest  boundary  demarcation  and  land  allocation. \nLocal communities and all stakeholders will be involved in this process. The Project will support \nspecial measures to enable the participation of hitherto excluded sections of local communities, \nespecially  ethnic  minorities  and  women,  by  building  their  literacy  in  the  Vietnamese  language \nand increasing their access to information, training, and extension programs. Empowerment via \nfunctionality in different languages will develop in tandem with local communities\u2019 rediscovering \ntheir indigenous knowledge, especially regarding forest-related activities. \n \n26. \nThe Project will also build the capacity of state agencies to implement ethnic minority\u2013\nsensitive participatory planning and implementation in forestry. These measures are expected to \nbring under the management of the 60 selected communes approximately 180,000\u2013480,000 ha, \nincreasing the forest resources available for livelihood improvement. Local communities and all \nstakeholders will be involved in surveying to ensure consensus on forest boundaries. In areas \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nwhere  demarcation  cannot  be  done  by  natural  features,  permanent  markers  such  as  concrete \nposts  will  ideally  be  used.  However,  permanent  colored  markings  on  trees  and  rocks  can  be \nused,  with  their  positions  recorded  on  the  map  record  using  global  positioning  systems. \nTraditional  leaders  of  ethnic  minority  communities  will  participate  in  the  process,  along  with \ncommune  people\u2019s  committees,  to  include  consideration  of  traditional  boundaries  of  village \nforestlands in boundary demarcation. \n \n27. \nSmall and Fragmented Forest Tracts. Small forest tracts will generally be allocated to \ncommunities to manage. A similar set of activities will be undertaken for these blocks as part of \npreparing  commune  investment  plans  (CIPs),  but  procedures  will  be  simplified  as  much  as \npossible to keep paperwork to a minimum. \n \nThe  management  of  forest  areas  will  be  achieved  by  implementing  participatory \n28. \nrehabilitation  and  management  of  protected  forests  by  protected  forest  management  boards, \nand of special-use forests by (i) participatory protection of protected forest areas with usufruct \nsharing, (ii) planting indigenous tree species, and (iii) enrichment planting in degraded areas. \n \n29. \nThe  Project  will  see  community  forest  planting  by  communes  and  village  communities, \nimproved  forest  management,  and  increased  valuation  of  forest  resources  under  village \ncommunity ownership or tenure in at least 60 selected communes covering a total area between \n180,000  and  480,000  ha.  Participatory  protection  of  forests  shall  also  be  done  over  the  area \nplanted  by  communes  and  areas  for  which  they  enter  into  contractual  obligations  with  state \nagencies. The proposed community forestry activities for the selected 60 communes will include \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nplanting indigenous species; \nforest restoration and enrichment planting in degraded natural forests; \ncreating  village  woodlots  with  fast-growing  tree  species  to meet  local  fuel  wood \nand small timber needs, as well as for commercial purposes; \nagroforestry practices; \nfarm forestry and homestead planting, especially for fruit trees; \nparticipatory protection of natural forest; and \ndeveloping basic infrastructure for the overall development of the commune. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nLivelihood Improvement (Community Support) \n\n \nBusiness Development. The Project will support (i) the promotion of small and medium \n30. \nenterprises  and  household  economic  development  opportunities  to  support  the  productive \nsector\u2019s  adding  value  to  forest-derived  goods  and  services  in  the  Central  Highlands,  (ii)  SFE \nrestructuring to set up efficient forest-related enterprises and to release land for community use, \nand  (iii)  pilot  measures  to  promote  the  clean  development  mechanism,  ecotourism,  and \nrenewable energy in the Central Highlands. \n \n \n \n31. \nThe  Project  will  support  livelihood  improvement  and  income  generation  in  the  60 \ncommunes by establishing a commune development fund (CDF) in each of the 60 communes \nwith seed capital of $20,000 per CDF. These will be revolving funds, each CDF handling its own \nincome generation and project investment funds on a sustainable basis. \n \n32. \nCommune investment plans for small-scale infrastructure and forestry activities in the 60 \ntarget communes, covering about 400,000 people in over 80,000 households, will be prepared \nand  implemented  by  the  beneficiaries  and  supported  with  functioning  and  sustainable  CDFs. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  livelihood-improvement,  or  community  support,  component  of  the \nProject is to have functioning CDFs in place in the 60 selected communes of the project area to \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n43 \n\nincome-generating  activities  and  develop  and  maintain  small-scale  commune \n\nsupport \ninfrastructure. \n \n33. \nCommune  investment  plans  (CIPs)  will  be  drawn  up  in  the  communes,  and  their \nimplementation  by  beneficiaries  will  be  supported  by  functioning  and  sustainable  CDFs. \nLivelihood  improvement  under  the  Project  will  focus  on  two  sub-components,  namely \n(i) establishing  CDFs  for  undertaking  income-generating  activities  and  (ii)  rural  infrastructure \nsupport. \n \n34. \nThe CDF scheme is a self-funding mechanism to distribute the benefits of forestland and \nforest  resource  allocation  throughout  the  beneficiary  community  and  will  actively  drive  local \npoverty reduction. It will not be just a project account for channeling project funds to communes, \nbut  should  be  an  active  fund  through  which  beneficiaries  receive  project  funds  under \nGovernment  programs  and  other  income  or  revenue  that  the  community  beneficiaries  may \ngenerate  through  various  economic  activities,  including  selling  products  gathered  from  the \ncommunity  forest.  CDFs  should  not  be  drawn  down  by  expenditures  on  project  activities,  but \ncontinue as revolving funds for the commune with two accounts as described below. \n \n35. \nTechnical  assistance  (TA)  grant  support  will  help  communes  build  capacity  to  manage \ntheir  CDF,  provide  farming  systems  advice,  and  carry  out  planning  and  monitoring.  CDFs  will \nhave  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\na  project  account,  in  which  project  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  for  project \nactivities, and. \na  commune  revenue  account,  which  can  receive  seed  money  to  establish \nlivelihood  improvement  activities  identified  by  the  producer  groups  in  the \ncommune, as well as funds from the Trust Fund for Forests (TFF). \nAll  interest  accrued  from  the  project  account  will  be  transferred  to  the  commune  revenue \naccount for the commune to use for livelihood improvement. \n \n36. \nSmall-Scale Community Infrastructure Support. The Project will support the funding \nof  small-scale  rural  infrastructure  to  help  communes  improve  (i)  such  social  amenities  as \ndrinking  water  supply,  school  rooms,  and  health  clinics;  (ii)  access  to  roads  and  markets  by \nrepairing  and  improving  village  access  roads;  and  (iii)  small-scale  irrigation  by  constructing \nsmall dams and irrigation channels. \n \n37. \nEach  commune  selected  under  the  Project  for  community  support  will  receive \ninvestment funds of up to $275,000 from the loan, of which up to 30% can be invested in small \ninfrastructure. The remaining 70% must be invested in forest-related activities. Adjustments can \nbe  made  freely  between  activities  within  each  category,  as  the  beneficiaries  see  fit,  by  using \nannual  work  plans  to  adjust  proposals  and  targets  already  laid  down  in  a  CIP  approved  by \ndistrict and provincial authorities. \n \n \n \nCapacity  development  includes  strengthening  institutional  capacity  in  communes  and \n38. \ndistricts  through  staff  training  and  providing  equipment  for  extension  and  enterprise  support \nservices to communities, households, and small and medium enterprises. \n \nCapacity  building  for  ethnic  minority  groups  in  village  communities  is  essential,  as  is \n39. \ncapacity  building  for  commune  and  village  officials  for  establishing  CDFs,  handling  finances, \nand producing simple financial statements and physical target monitoring reports. Other training \n\nCapacity Development \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n3. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nneeds include improved functional literacy and language proficiency; poverty reduction through \nextension  with  a  focus  on  ethnic  minorities;  information  and  communications  technology  for \nselected  communes;  enterprise  development;  training  for  project  implementation  staff  in \ndistricts,  provinces,  and  the  central  Government;  and  training  for  GIS  and  database  utilization \nand for monitoring and evaluation (M&E). \n \n \n \nThe  LIEMDP  will  be  monitored  as  part  of  overall  monitoring  of  project  implementation. \n40. \nImpact  assessment  of  the  LIEMDP  will  form  part  of  the  overall  M&E  process.  It  will  be \nnecessary  to  create  an  enabling  environment  in  which  sub-commune  residents  can  develop \nindicators to evaluate. All progress reports prepared by the executing agency (EA) will address \nthe  LIEMDP  goal,  objectives,  and  components  and  report  on  achievements,  problems,  and \nfuture strategies. At midterm review and project completion, external monitoring will be carried \nout by an external institution engaged by the EA with ADB approval. External monitoring will be \nboth quantitative and qualitative. Participatory research will be carried out to fully involve ethnic \nminority  communities  and  women  in  assessing  how  well  the  strategies  visualized  under  the \nLIEMDP and the Project have delivered benefits. \n \n41. \nSome  indicators  for  measuring  the  achievement  of  this  goal  relate  to  income \nimprovement,  others  to  better  health  outcomes,  and  others  to  a  greater  degree  of  informed \nparticipation  in  community  decision  making  by  marginalized  residents.  Still  others  relate  to \nintangibles  such  as  self  esteem,  sense  of  vulnerability,  sense  of  control,  and  social  inclusion. \nMany  indicators  will  be  locally  determined  according  to  the  outlook  of  ethnic  groups.  Broadly \nspeaking,  however,  a  list  of  indicators  including  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  ones  may \ninclude increased \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nnumbers of beneficiary households; \naverage forest-based incomes; \nemployment; \nwages and incomes of forest enterprise workers; \nforest areas legally owned or managed by households; \nfood  security  in  terms  of  food  availability  in  households  year-round,  food \nallocation within households, and nutritional adequacy; \nvalue of social infrastructure in rural communities; \nhousehold forestry enterprises, \nsavings in households and communities; \npercentage  of  communities  and  households  with  access  to  safe  water  and \nsanitation; \ncapacity of workers in forest-related industries; \nparticipation  of  ethnic  minority  women  and  men  in  community-based  decision \nmaking on forestland demarcation, allocation, and utilization; and \nuse of non-timber forest products by communities. \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(xi) \n(xii) \n\n(xiii) \n\nConclusion \n\n \nC. \n \n42. \nIt  must  be  noted  that  the  LIEMDP  is  a  generic  document,  which  can  be  adapted  to  a \nvariety  of  commune  situations.  Although  it  represents  a  sum  of  community  choices  for  project \nimplementation, community validation of the LIEMDP during implementation will heighten local \nownership,  thereby  improving  its  effectiveness.  Careful  calibration  of  the  LIEMDP  with  other \nproject  components  will  likely  bring  to  communities  significantly  improved  livelihood,  both \nmaterial and not, even for the poorest and most vulnerable groups in the Central Highlands. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n  No \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nThe  forestry  sector  plays  a  critical  role  in  meeting  the  subsistence  needs  of  poor  ethnic  minority  communities  and \nother poor groups in Viet Nam, particularly in the Central Highlands. The Central Highlands have biodiversity of high \nnational  and  international  importance.  All  indigenous  ethnic  minority  groups  have  traditionally  derived  a  significant \nportion of their livelihood by harvesting timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for household use. Upland rice \nand  other  crops  were  grown  in  forest  clearings  with  long  fallows.  However,  ethnic  minorities\u2019  traditional  use  of  the \nforests  has  gradually  waned  on  account  of  Government  policies  restricting  access  to  forest  areas.  The  Government \nhas,  until  recently,  allocated  large  forest  areas  to  state  forest  enterprises  (SFEs),  leading  to  a  net  reduction  in \nproductive  forest  areas  available  to  people.  In  addition,  the  role  of  communities  in  forests  has  been  reduced  to \nprotection  and  maintenance  functions  contracted  by  SFEs  and  highly  restricted  access  to  NTFPs.  All  these  factors \nhave contributed to worsening poverty among ethnic minority communities over the years. The Forestry Sector Project \nassisted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other projects have facilitated the development of new thinking \nwith  regard  to  the  likely  contribution  of  the  forestry  sector  to  poverty  reduction.  The  denuded  condition  of  many \nforestlands  has  also  brought  about  the  realization  that  joint  management  of  forests  with  communities  in  partnership \nwith government can provide greater protection and sustainable use of the resources for reducing poverty among rural \ncommunities  in  the  Central  Highlands,  as  well  as  facilitate  reforestation  and  environmental  improvements.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  new  approach  is  to  provide  communities  with  rights  to  use  forests  to  improve  their  livelihood  and  to \nprotect forests with conservation and sustainable management. The proposed Forests for Livelihood Improvement in \nthe  Central  Highlands  Sector  Project  (the  Project)  will  aim  to  develop  this  further  by  providing  capacity  building, \ntechnical assistance (TA), and financial resources to  government agencies and communities so that they can better \nwork together for the common good. \n \n\nPoverty Classification: Targeted intervention \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nProject preparatory TA has produced an in-depth participatory assessment \nof  poverty  in  the  project  provinces.  It  includes  detailed  analyses  of  all \nstakeholders,  in  particular  of  the  indigenous  and  other  ethnic  minority \ncommunities  living  in  the  project  area,  which  are  among  the  poorest  and \nmost vulnerable groups in the country. Strong analysis links poverty to the \ndecline in the communities\u2019 access to forest and croplands, as well as their \npoor access to health and education services. Authoritative analyses detail \nthe  situation  of  women,  gender  relations,  the  priorities  and  needs  of \nwomen,  and  the  gender-based  constraints  to  reducing  poverty  and \nimproving well-being.  \n \n\n \nTI \nH/G \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\n  Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n  No \n\n  No \n\n \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  The  Project  includes  a  gender  action  plan  to  maximize  women\u2019s \nopportunities  to  participate  in  land  allocation,  land-use  planning,  and  livelihoods  development.  The  Project  also \nprovides capacity building, particularly for ethnic minority women, to strengthen project benefits. It provides proactively \nfor  ethnic  minorities\u2019  participation  in  and  benefit  from  commune  development  funds,  which  will  enable  local \ncommunities  to  invest  in  social  infrastructure  to  reduce  women\u2019s  domestic  drudgery.  It  will  also  support  community \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nlivelihoods activities expected to enable women in particular to improve incomes and food security. All land allocations \nwill  be  made  equally  to  women  and  men.  This  will  be  indicated  by  including  the  names  of  both  spouses  on  land \ndocuments and, for households headed by women, the women\u2019s names. \n \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n  Yes \n\n  No \n\nE.  Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nSignificant positive impacts are expected. The project will \nprovide  skills  upgrading  for  local  labor,  mainly  ethnic \nminority  groups,  so  that  they  may  find  employment  and \nhigher  wages  in  forestry  management  operations  and \nforest-product  processing.  The  Project  will  support \nforest \nimproving \nenterprises \nimproving \nemployment  opportunities  and  wages,  reducing  wastage \nof  wood,  and  improving  the  utilization  of  wood  resources \nin  the  Central  Highlands.  The  strategy  forms  part  of  the \nlivelihood  improvement  and  ethnic  minority  development \nplan (LIEMDP). \n\ntechnology  and  skills  of  state \n\nthereby \n\nlabor, \n\nlocal \n\nand \n\nthe \n\nSignificant positive impacts are expected. The LIEMDP is \nsummarized  in  Appendix  8.  In  a  sense,  the  Project  is \ndevoted almost entirely to improving conditions for ethnic \nminorities.  It  will  improve  their  legal  access  to  productive \nforestland and provide opportunities for their participation \nin \nland-use  planning,  demarcating  boundaries,  and \nallocating  land.  It  will  facilitate  access  to  improved \nextension  and \nfrom  government \nagencies. It will provide value-adding opportunities locally, \nso that ethnic  minority  households and communities may \nbenefit from better incomes and prices for their produce. It \nwill  help  build  critically  needed  social  development  skills \nsuch  as  numeracy,  particularly  among  children  and \nwomen.  Adult  learning  programs  will  improve  people\u2019s \nability  to  assimilate  information  and  participate  effectively \nin public consultations and decision making. \n\ntechnology  support \n\n  Full \n\n  Short \n\n  None  \n\n  Yes \n\n  No \n\n  Yes \n\n  No  \n\n  Yes \n\n  No  \n\n  Yes \n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\nResettlement  \n\n  Significant \n\n  \n\n  Not significant \n\n  None \n\nAffordability  \n\n  Significant \n\nLabor \n\n  Significant \n\n  Not significant \n\n  None \n\n  Not significant \n\n  None \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n  Significant \n\n  Not significant \n\n  None \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\n  Significant \n  Not significant \n  None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nThis gender action plan (GAP) ensures that poor rural women benefit equitably with men \n1. \n(with  emphasis  on  the  indigenous  communities  of  the  Central  Highlands)  from  investments \nmade under the Forests for Livelihood Improvement in the Central Highlands Sector Project (the \nProject). The GAP is based upon participatory research and consultations carried out in the six \nprovinces  covered  by  the  Project  as  part  of  project  preparation.  The  GAP  is  based  on  two \npremises,  one  of  which  involves  the  return  of  forestland  use  to  women  and  men  living  in \ncommunities  and  households  located  in  and  around  forested  areas,  for  their  livelihood \ndevelopment  and  sustainable  management.  However,  returning  forestlands  without  technical \nsupport  and  other  opportunities  for  livelihood  diversification  will  not  lead  to  many  improved \nconditions.  Therefore,  the  GAP  includes  setting  up  commune  funds  that  can  be  accessed  by \ncommunities  for  improving  their  income-earning  opportunities.  These  funds  can  also  generate \nrevenues  to  support  forest-based  activities  and  improvements  to  social  and  physical \ninfrastructure  and  services.  All  of  these  interventions  are  based  on  gender  analyses  of  the \nlivelihoods,  priorities,  and  needs  of  poor  rural  communities,  particularly  ethnic  minorities, \ninhabiting  these  areas.  Gender-sensitive  strategies  to  augment  access  to  resources  and \nlivelihoods are expected to improve the lives in particular of ethnic minority women and men in \nthe project areas. \n \n2. \nThe people who are the subjects of this GAP lack access to commune resources. Most \nof the women and many of the men are illiterate and lack mainstream Kinh language skills and \nso  cannot  make  their  needs  felt  by  commune  authorities.  While  the  commune  is  the \nadministrative unit, it is important to include planning and implementation of livelihoods activities \nin villages or hamlets to include the most vulnerable and poorest members of local communities \nin the Project. Traditional leaders of ethnic minority villages, including elders\u2019 groups and groups \nof women, will be among those who need to be mobilized to bring their voices into the planning \nprocess. \n \n \n \n3. \nThe  analysis  of  gender  issues  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  situation  of  ethnic  minority \ncommunities  in  particular,  as  well  as  the  gender  concerns  of  Kinh  women  in  the  project  area. \nThe  Project  potentially  affects  approximately  400,000  people  in  80,000  households  in  the  60 \ncommunes  of  the  six  project  provinces,  of  which  five  are  in  the  Central  Highlands.  The  other \nprovince,  Phu  Yen,  adjoins  the  Central  Highlands.  Poverty  is  high  in  these  provinces1  and  in \nparticular in the communes inhabited by ethnic minorities (where poverty rates are 50\u201360% and \nhigher)  on  account  of  their  loss  of  traditional  forest-based  livelihoods  without  compensation. \nEthnic  minorities  indigenous  to  the  Central  Highlands  are  of  the  Mon  Khmer  ethno-linguistic \ngroup.  They  have  suffered  of  the  most  from  the  loss  of  access  to  productive  forests  because \ntheir  livelihoods  were  the  most  dependent  upon  forests.  The  10  Mon  Khmer  ethno-linguistic \ngroups  in  the  Central  Highlands  include  the  relatively  large  Ro  Mam  and  Ba  Na,  each  with \napproximately 215,000 people. The other ethno-linguistic group partly indigenous to the Central \nHighlands  is  the  Malayo  Polynesian  group,  which  includes  the  Ede,  numbering  approximately \n350,000,  and  the  Chu  Ru,  who  are  few  in  number.  Non-indigenous  ethnic  minority  groups \ninclude  the  Hmong,  Tay,  Thai,  Nung,  Lu,  and  Dao.  Ethnic  minorities  constitute  approximately \n50% of the population in Kon Tum, 43% in Gia Lai, 29% in Dak Lak, 22% in Lam Dong, and 5% \n                                                 \n1   As per the report New Zealand Aid. 2003. Poverty and Inequality in Vietnam. The percentage of rural population in \n\nGender Issues \n\n1. \n\npoverty in Gia Lai is approximately 63%, Kon Tum 65%, Dak Lak 50%, Lam Dong 46%, and Phu Yen 46%. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nin  Phu  Yen.  The  kinship  system  of  most  of  the  upland  indigenous  ethnic  minority  groups \n(UIEMGs)  has  a  clear  matrilineal  bias,  particularly  regarding  the  ownership  and  inheritance  of \nland, including forestland. Traditional ownership systems define the kinds of reciprocal relations \nthat exist within lineage groups and the extent  of mutual exchange permitted with others. The \nnew Land Law, approved in 2003, accords equal rights to women and men for having property \nregistered in their name. As the allocation of land titles has not proceeded apace in the Central \nHighlands,  its  impact  on  women\u2019s  customary  land  rights  in  unclear.  However,  vestiges  of \ntraditional  matrilineal  land-holding  systems  will  be  relevant  when  forestlands  are  about  to  be \nallocated,  particularly  if  customary  rights  are  to  be  included,  as  is  essential  for  empowering \nethnic minority communities to improve their livelihoods. \n \n4. \nThe  social  position  of  women  in  UIEMGs  is  supposed  to  be  superior  to  that  of  Kinh \nwomen  and  other  lowland  ethnic  groups.  Most  of  the  latter  groups  are  characterized  by \npatriarchal  norms  underpinning  family  and  community  relations  and  functions.  These  include \nsubstantial  deference  toward  men  in  most  matters,  both  domestic  and  public.  Among  the \nUIEMGs, women did not in theory have to deal with such patriarchal systems of deference and \ncontrol, as the matriarchal systems tilted in their favor. Men came to live in the homes of their \nwives  after  marriage,  preserving  women\u2019s  support  from  their  own  families  and  kin  groups. \nAccess  to  land  for  men  was  mediated  by  their  relations  with  women.  However,  given  the \nsignificant responsibilities of women in food production and domestic roles, men were supposed \nto  deal  with  external  forces,  giving  them  substantial  roles  in  public  decision  making  and \nmediation  with  the  state.  Women  of  UIEMGs  have  lost  out  through  the  gradual  loss  of \nforestlands to the state.2 \n \nToday,  the  situation  of  UIEMG  women  is  characterized  by  pressure  on  account  of  a \n5. \nnumber of factors. As the communities lost access to forestlands, both women and men came \nunder  pressure  to  grow  sufficient  food  to  meet  household  requirements.  Among  the  UIEMG, \nwomen  collected  forest  foods  to  supplement  upland  agriculture,  in  which  women  played  an \nequal role. As there was no plowing involved in upland farming, women were quite self-sufficient \nin  producing  crops  in  temporary  fields,  after  they  were  first  cleared  by  men.  In  addition  to \nclearing  land,  men  hunted  and  harvested  timber.  However,  the  loss  of  forestlands  drastically \nreduced  the  scope  for  such  activities.  As  forest  foods  provided  sustenance  in  periods  of  rice \nshortage, as well as supplementing families\u2019 diets at all times, women tried to sell forest produce \nand handicrafts to procure food in times of shortage. Women bear full responsibility for domestic \nwork, which lengthens their workday by several hours beyond that of men. The lack of culturally \nappropriate  reproductive  health  options  and  inadequate  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems \ncause  reproductive  health  problems.  The  lack  of  safe  water  increases  women\u2019s  workload,  as \ndoes family ill health. The improved availability of basic amenities in these communes will go a \nlong  way  toward  reducing  women\u2019s  vulnerabilities  and  improving  the  health  and  well-being  of \nthe entire community. \n \n6. \nWhile women are clearly more hard pressed than men under the shrinkage of livelihoods \nresources,  traditional  patterns  of  decision  making  also  appears  to  be  changing  in  response  to \nchanging  circumstances.  While  decision  making  on  a  range  of  domestic  issues  is  shared, \nincreased  contact  with  mainstream  lowland  communities  has  increased  men\u2019s  personal \nexpenditures on alcohol and tobacco and claim, over which women have no control (as is true in \nmainstream society). \n\n                                                 \n2  From the 1970s, state enterprises for developing plantations of coffee, tea, and rubber, as well as agro-industries, \ncontrolled approximately 70\u201380% of the natural forest area of the Central Highlands provinces. In 1993, the Land \nCode severely restricted communities\u2019 access to NTFPs from forestlands under state control. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n49 \n\nThen  again,  women\u2019s  traditional knowledge  of  non-timber  forest  products  (NTFPs)  and \n7. \nupland agriculture without chemical inputs is increasingly regarded as useless, such that men, \nwho know somewhat more about intensive lowland rice and other crops, appear to be gaining \nthe  upper  hand.  This  is  particularly  so  regarding  new  crops  and  farming  techniques.  When \nethnic minority communities relocate and receive land for cash cropping, men tend to take over \ncritical  decisions  on  crop  production.  They  are  the  ones  to  negotiate  with  officials  and  others \nregarding  cash  cropping  and  appear  to  make  decisions  regarding  land-use  changes  and \ninvestment  in  chemical  fertilizers,  which  increases  investments  in  agriculture.  While  women\u2019s \ntraditional  knowledge  increasingly  comes  to  be  regarded  as  irrelevant,  women  are  also  losing \ntheir  decision-making  position  with  regard  to  land  and  resource  allocation.  This,  along  with \nreduced access to land, does not augur well for women\u2019s position. The new Land Law does deal \nwith the issue of land titles for both spouses, but its implementation goes back only to 2001. A \nlot remains to be done in granting equal land rights to men and women. The Project is expected \nto  do  much  by  providing  equal  land  rights  to  productive  forestlands  to  women  and  men. \nGranting  legal,  secure  access  to  productive  forestlands  will  benefit  not  only  women  but  entire \nUIEMGs. \n \n8. \nWomen\u2019s traditional knowledge of livestock rearing commands respect in communities. \nWomen are responsible for rearing and maintaining small and large livestock but prefer smaller \nlivestock  because  of  disease  problems  with  larger  ones.  Men  are  generally  responsible  for \nselling  and  buying  larger  livestock.  During  participatory  consultations,  women  revealed  their \npreference for increased livestock resources for livelihoods improvement. The Project will help \nwomen to acquire additional livestock resources through the commune-based funds to be set up \nfor livelihoods and building social infrastructure. \n \n9. \nWomen  of  UIEMGs  lack  literacy  and  numerical  skills.  They  usually  do  not  speak  or \nunderstand the Kinh language and thereby are excluded from officially disseminated information \nand training and extension services, among other aspects of mainstream economic and political \nlife.  This  gap  needs  to  be  addressed  to  improve  women\u2019s  capability  to  participate  in  activities \nunder the Project in particular and in the development process in general. The Project will aim to \nprovide  an  enabling  environment  for  local  women  to  participate  effectively  in  all  levels  of \ngovernance. \n \n \n \n10. \nThe  following  are  some  of  the  gender-related  interventions  that  the  Government  must \nthe  Vietnamese  Women\u2019s  Union  (VWU),  nongovernment \nput \norganizations  (NGOs)  working  on  gender  issues,  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  to \nmaximize  the  positive  outcomes  of  development  on  ethnic  minority  women  in  the  Central \nHighlands. These include \n\nGender Interventions Required \n\nin  place,  working  with \n\n2. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ntraining in adding value to existing and potential NTFPs and ensuring marketing \narrangements; \nusing women\u2019s indigenous knowledge, especially of forests, to add more value to \nforest-based activities; \ndiversifying  women\u2019s  access  to  higher  value  commodities  (the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty  Reduction\u2013assisted  project  for  developing  eri  silk  production  among \nethnic minority women will provide valuable experience for replication); \nincreasing the availability of affordable credit for women, with improved targeting \nof UIEMG women; \ngender-sensitization  training  including  UIEMG  perspectives  for  upland  women \nand men as well as others; \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nliteracy empowerment programs for UIEMG women and men; \ndesigning culturally appropriate health programs; and \nincorporating  key  components  of  Gender  Strategy  in  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment  to  the  Year  2010  (Decision  No.  4776QD-BNN/TCCB,  28  January \n2003) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) in programs \nto monitor and evaluate the changing status of ethnic minority women in forest-\nbased livelihoods improvement. \n\nDraft Gender Strategy \n\n \nB. \n \n11.  MARD\u2019s gender strategy is designed to improve gender equity, promote women\u2019s status \nin  agriculture  and  rural  development,  and  strengthen  the  institutionalization  of  gender-\nresponsive planning in the sector. One of the key objectives is to increase women\u2019s access to \nresources,  in  particular  land,  including  forestlands.  Another  is  to  increase  gender  awareness, \ninclude gender-disaggregated indicators in monitoring, and increase gender-sensitive planning \nand implementation of programs and projects, particularly with regard to training and extension \nservices. All in all, the gender strategy aims to empower women and increase their participation \nin decision making at all levels. \n \n12. \nThis GAP is designed specifically to meet the needs of project communes in the Central \nHighlands. It stands together with the ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP) prepared for \nthe Project and needs to be understood and implemented in conjunction with the EMDP so that \ngender issues are properly addressed. \n \n13. \n\nThe principles upon which the GAP is based include  \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nequal project opportunity and benefit-sharing between women and men, \nsystematic  measures  to  reduce  gender  inequality  in  project  areas  regarding \nforest-related interventions, \na targeted approach for poor women lacking livelihoods, \ncollecting  gender-disaggregated  data  including stakeholder-designed  monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E), \nfacilitating  an  enabling  environment  to  support  women\u2019s  capacity  building  and \nparticipation in all phases of project activities and mainstream gender beyond the \nEMDP, and \nincreased representation of women in decision-making bodies at all levels. \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \nThe GAP has the overall goal of reducing poverty in approximately 600 villages in the 60 \n14. \ncommunes in the project area. More specifically, the aim is to reduce the incidence of food-poor \nhouseholds  and  increase  the  incomes  of  poor  households,  with  a  particular  focus  on  UIEMG \nwomen.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  this  goal  by  introducing  sustainable  forest  management \nand biodiversity conservation by communities, the state and other entities. \n \n15.  Women are likely to benefit from investments in forestry-related activities and improved \naccess  to  social  infrastructure,  as  well  as  from  measures  to  build  their  capacity  and  reduce \ndrudgery,  according  to  consultations  with  women  in  the  project  areas  and  the  priorities  they \nidentified.  \n \n16. \nBenefits for women will arise primarily from the return of forestlands to communities and \nhouseholds. While this is a step in the right direction, returning forestlands will not itself reduce \npoverty in the short run. Immediate sources of income will be required, so it will be important to \ninclude non-forest activities such as livestock rearing, which has been prioritized by women and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\ncommune  people\u2019s  committee  (CPC)  officials.  Particular  livelihoods  chosen  will  relate  to  the \nresource base of individual communes. However, the fundamental need is to ensure women\u2019s \nequal  access  to  resources  and  provide  special  capacity-building  efforts  to  facilitate  their \ninformed participation. \n \n17. \nCapacity building for gender-responsive planning, implementation, and M&E will need to \nbe provided by the executing agency (EA) nationally, provincially, and in districts. There are no \nwomen employed in provincial DARD planning and management. While competent women work \nin  VWU  at  the  provincial  level,  female  staff  are  needed  with  technical  training  in  forest \nmanagement.  In  most  areas,  VWU  has  acquired  sufficient  experience  in  working  with  ethnic \nminority communities, but it often has difficulty targeting UIEMG women. The Project will need \nto  work  with  VWU  to  develop  training  programs  for  them  for  NTFP  processing  and  value \naddition, which can become important income-earning activities. VWU may need external help \nin  designing  culturally  appropriate  literacy  programs  or  supporting  culturally  acceptable  health \nprograms. GAP recommends using external facilitators from Tay Ngyuen University in Pleiku or \nNGOs with demonstrated experience in Viet Nam. \n \n18. \nLow  literacy  among  older  women  is  recognized  as  weakening  their  capacity  to \nparticipate and absorb learning and information disseminated by government agencies. Among \nyounger  women,  literacy  rates  are  close  to  national  averages.  Wherever  possible,  project \ninformation will need to be translated into different ethnic minority languages. However, younger \nwomen who are bilingual can play valuable roles in project implementation. The GAP rests on \nthe  premise  that,  unless  UIEMG  women  are  enabled  to  participate  fully,  the  project  outcomes \nwill not be sustainable from a gender perspective. Younger, bilingual ethnic minority women can \nbe employed as facilitators and trained to work with other women\u2019s groups. \n \n19. \nAs  decision  making  in  villages  will  focus  on  the  role  of  traditional  councils  of  elders, \nwhere women are not represented, gender sensitizing these councils will be undertaken so that \nwomen\u2019s interests are considered in deliberations and decisions. Women will make up 40% of \nthe  membership  of  community  development  funds  (CDFs)  set  up  under  the  Project.  Through \ntheir participation in CDFs, as well as during participatory land-use planning and land allocation \n(PLUPLA), women will be provided with the enabling environment they require to participate and \nforward  their  interests.  Besides,  all  forest  and  other  land  will  be  allocated  to  women  and  men \nwith joint title under the Land Law of 2003. \n \n20. \nAs  project  activities  in  forestry  and  infrastructure  development  are  community  based, \nsafeguards  are  required  to  ensure  that  women  do  not  provide  free  labor.  Women\u2019s  existing \nworkloads need to be considered, and their labor must be compensated at the same rate as for \nmen  for  similar  activities.  As  far  as  agroforestry  with  individual  households  is  concerned,  the \ninitial payment from loan should be made to household members who actually provide the labor \nand not to the putative household head. Women\u2019s preferences for activities should be assessed \nthrough household surveys assisted by CDFs. \n \n21. \nAn important aspect of the Project will be joint ventures between restructured state forest \nenterprises (SFEs) and the newly constituted CDFs. The gender profile of most SFEs is not very \ngood, particularly at senior levels. To receive project support, each SFE must provide a human \nresource strategy that will include measures to improve the recruitment of women for senior and \ntechnical  positions.  They  will  also  need  to  demonstrate  measures  by  which  rural  women  will \nbenefit from joint ventures. \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nTo ensure the implementation of the GAP, an international consultant with demonstrated \n22. \ncompetency in gender and development (GAD) relevant to forestry-based livelihoods and rural \ndevelopment among ethnic minority groups will need to be employed on an intermittent basis. \nShe or he will need to be supported by a local GAD consultant employed full time. \n \n\nComponent \nLivelihoods Improvement \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A10.1:

Highlands \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nThe  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS)  of \n\nthe \n1. \nGovernment of Viet Nam aims to reduce poverty rapidly and ensure that all Vietnamese benefit \nfrom economic growth. Specific mention is made in the CPRGS about the need to improve and \nstabilize  the  living  standards  of  ethnic  minorities  in  a  manner  that  is  compatible  with  their \ncustoms.  The  Government\u2019s  Forest  Development  Strategy  (2001\u20132010)  and  sector  plans  call \nfor  making  forestry  an  important  economic  sector  by  (i)  protecting  and  developing  forest \nresources  and  increasing  forest  cover  from  32%  to  43%  by  2010,  (ii)  achieving  an  annual \ngrowth  rate  in  the  forestry  sector  of  over  3.5%  during  2006\u20132010,  (iii)  accelerating  and \ncompleting  forestland  allocation  under  the  Land  Law  and  the  revised  forest  protection  and \ndevelopment  law;  (iv)  using  forestry  to  improve  livelihoods  and  reduce  poverty  in  chronically \npoor mountainous and ethnic minority\u2013dominated areas, and (iv) increasing the efficiency and \nvalue of the country\u2019s wood-processing industry. \n\n2. \nRecent  poverty  assessments  highlighted  that  progress  in  poverty  reduction  has  been \nslow  in  the  Central  Highlands,  where  significant  numbers  of  ethnic  minorities  live. This  finding \npoints out the requirement for continued targeted investment for poverty reduction in this area. \nForestry  remains  the  major  potential  economic  activity  in  the  Central  Highlands.  In  the  overall \npolicy framework of poverty reduction, a sub-objective exists to increase the share of benefits to \nhouseholds involved in forest protection, forest management, and reforestation. Implementation \nof  this  benefit-sharing  policy  lags  behind  expectations  due  to  a  number  of  constraints.  The \nemphasis on socially inclusive development and a geographic focus on the central region in the \ncountry strategy and program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) further justify the proposed \ninvestments under this Project. \n\nThe forestry sector in Viet Nam is mainly concerned with forest-resource protection and \n3. \nmanagement  and  the  associated  harvesting  of  timber,  mainly  from  natural  forests.  Available \ninformation indicates an annual wood deficit of around 5\u20136 million cubic meters (m3) roundwood \nequivalent. The Government's drive to expand the economy includes promoting exports of wood \nproducts, particularly wooden furniture. The value of wood exports was $530 million in 2002 and \nincreased  to  about  $1.5  billion  in  2005.  Most  of  the  wood  inputs  for  the  processing  industry \ncome  from  imports  and  illegal  sources.  The  Central  Highlands  region  is  the  most  important  in \nViet  Nam  for  forestry,  as  it  has  almost  30%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  forest  area  and  contributes \nmore  than  60%  of  the  total  hardwood  supplies  from  natural  forests.  The  region  also  assumes \nunique  significance  in  view  of  its  including  biodiversity  hotspots  and  important  watersheds. \nThere  are  currently  about  3.17  million  hectares  (ha)  of  forestland  in  the  Central  Highland, \nincluding  about  3.03  million  ha  of  natural  forest  and  0.14  million  ha  of  forest  plantations.  The \nProject proposes to establish scientifically sound management regimes for these forestlands in \nthe  central  region.  It  will  undertake  forest  resource  development  and  management  activities \nsupported  by  capacity  development  and  project  management  support.  It  will  also  undertake \nrural infrastructure improvement to ensure that all the necessary types of capital are in place to \nmake investment in the sector effective. \n\n4. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  address  a  number  of  market  and  other  failures.  First  and \nforemost,  it  will  remedy  the  issue  of  forestland  tenure  rights.  The  existing  land  tenure  of \nforestlands  in  the  Central  Highlands  does  not  provide  adequate  incentive  for  investment,  nor \ndoes  it  guarantee  benefits  accruing  to  the  local  communities.  Despite  the  availability  of  vast \nforest resources in the region, the current contribution of forestry to household income remains \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nvery  low  at  less  than  5%.  Forestland  definition,  delineation,  demarcation,  and  allocation  will \nprovide well-defined property right to forestlands. These activities will generate substantial rural \nemployment  opportunities.  The  proposed  Project  will  augment  tree  cover,  rehabilitating  and \nrestoring  natural  forests  in  sensitive  ecosystems  and  reversing  forest  degradation.  These \nactivities will internalize the environmental externalities associated with forestland degradation. \nThat  project  area  is  a  nationally  important  watershed  signifies  the  correction  of  this  market \nfailure. The enhanced management of natural forest will augment the supply of environmentally \nrelated public goods. The project will also address the information coordination failures, which \nprevent  private  sector  investment  in  the  forestry  sector,  by  identifying suitable  forestlands  and \nmaking  this  information  available  to  the  private  sector.  It  will  also  address  the  capacity  and \ntechnological  failures  of  the  Government  that  result  in  unproductive  and  economically \nunattractive forestry activities in the vast forestlands of the Central Highlands. \n\nB. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n5. \nPoverty  Reduction.  The  project  directly  and  indirectly  helps  reduce  poverty  in  the \nCentral Highlands. It will directly address poverty through its assistance regarding fast-growing \ntree species using an equity model. In the first round of livelihood plantations, 5,200 households \nwill be permanently lifted out of poverty by project investments. A financing mechanism will be \ninstitutionalized  by  establishing  commune  development  funds  to  scale  up  the  livelihood \nplantation  model.  After  the  first  harvest,  a  similar  number  of  households  will  be  supported  to \nestablish livelihood plantations. The project will provide a lot of employment (23 million person-\ndays)  covering  80,000  households  in  the  targeted  local  communities  through  its  forestland \nmanagement planning activities. In addition, the vibrant forestry sector envisaged by the Project \nis expected to generate a variety of secondary economic opportunities for local communities. \n\n6. \nNatural  Forest  Management.  The  Project  will  arrest  forest  degradation  and  develop \nand  implement  sustainable  forest  management  plans  for  about  1.5  million  ha  of  natural \nproduction forestlands in the Central Highlands. Employing certain plausible assumptions, with- \nand  without-project  revenue  streams  from  sustainable  timber  harvesting  were  calculated.  The \ntotal forest stock under the project management regimes is expected to increase significantly as \n(i)  the  forest  area  stabilizes  at  the  baseline  area  and  (ii)  the  stock  is  allowed  to  grow  under \ninitially low rates of harvesting. The predicted yield difference with and without the project was \nvalued at $40/m3. The stumpage value of hardwood timber was taken at $76/m3, and $36 was \ndeducted  from  this  stumpage  to  account  for  the  cost  of  state  forest  enterprise  (SFE)  forest \nmanagement  over  and  above  the  direct  project  investment.  Incremental  wood  yield  due  to \nproposed  better  management  will  generate  $44  million  worth  of  net  present  value  for  the \nGovernment at a 10% discount rate. \n\n7. \nPlantation  Forestry.  The  Project  will  support  establishing  44,000  ha  of  forest \nplantations,  30,000  ha  by  small  holders,  9,550  ha  by  SFEs,  and  5,200  ha  by  small-  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs).  The  livelihood  plantation  is  supported  through  an  equity \nmodel.1 The bulk of project investments, $21 million (over 26%), are allocated for this activity. A \nnumber  of  fast-growing plantation  models  were developed  and  subjected  to  financial  analysis. \nThe results indicate that returns are attractive for fast-growing species on short rotations, with \nfinancial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  of  12\u201317%.  Models  based  on  longer  rotations  have \nFIRRs  of  9\u201315%.  All  plantation  models  are  moderately  sensitive  to  the  cost  of  labor,  which \nconstitutes a significant proportion of the cost of plantation establishment. Short rotation models \nare also sensitive to the output price of wood. All models show significantly better returns than \n\n                                                 \n1  See Supplementary Appendix H for details. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nthose  earned  from  comparable  models  based  upon  existing  activities  and  cost  and  price \nparameters, for which FIRRs are 2\u201311%. The analyses thus show that the proposed Project will \ngenerate  adequate  financial  incentive  for  smallholders,  SFEs,  and  SMEs  to  engage  in  forest \nplantation.  Moreover,  the  analyses  show  that  the  Project  has  potential  for  significantly \nimprovements over the baseline situation. The weighted average cost of capital for the Project \nwas estimated to be 4.6, and the indicative FIRR values of revenue-generating components are \nmuch  above  that  figure.  This  clearly  demonstrates  the  financial  viability  of  the  revenue-\ngenerating components of the Project. \n \n8. \nThe plantation component of the proposed Project is expected to generate over 2 million \nm3  of  pulpwood  and  72,500  m3  of  saw  logs  during  the  first  8  year  rotation.  In  addition,  if  the \nprojected area of 6,850 ha of indigenous hardwoods and 2,700 ha of enrichment planting goes \nto a full rotation of 40 years, around 1.5 million m3 of hardwood timber will become available in \nthe future. The smallholder labor contribution to the project is expected to amount to 6.5 million \nperson-days over 8 years, and SFEs and SMEs are expected to require 1.6 million person-days \nof input from workers in their areas. At current wage rates, this is valued at almost D32 billion \n($2 million). Much of this demand for labor is likely to be met by poor households. \n \n9. \nIf the anticipate private sector investment materializes, forest plantations are expected to \nexpand by about 50,000 ha per year over a decade, beginning from 2010. This expectation is \nconsistent with the target in the National Forestry Development Strategy and demand for wood \nas an industrial raw material. The plantations will take about 10 years to come into production \nand  start  to  generating  revenue,  allowing  a  few  years  to  begin  investment,  complete  land \nallocation,  and  attract  private  investment.  With  a  conservatively  estimated  yield  of  about \n15m3/ha/year, annual government revenue would be around $6 million. This is based on a 4% \nnatural resources tax and a log value of $20 per m3. The present value of future annual income \nof  $6  million,  starting  in  10  years  time  at  10%  discount,  is  around  $20  million,  which  is \nsubstantially more than the proposed investment in sector strengthening. \n \n10. \nEconomic Feasibility of Core Subproject. One of the core subprojects, the Lam Dong \ncore  subproject,  was  subjected  to  economic  analysis.  Timber  benefits  from  natural  forest \nmanagement  and  forest  plantations  and  non-timber  forest  product  (NTFP)  benefits  were \nquantified.  Among  the  environmental  benefits,  watershed  protection  benefits  were  assessed \nusing  benefit-transfer  methods.  Only  conservative  environmental  values  were  used  in \ncalculations. Appropriate conversion factors were used to convert financial costs and benefits to \neconomic  costs  and  benefits.  The analysis  shows  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  14%, \nindicating  that  the  overall  project  generates  benefits  in  excess  of  costs.  As  the  Lam  Dong \nsubproject  is  representative,  this  analysis  is  indicative  of  the  economic  feasibility  of  the  entire \nProject. \n \nEnvironmental Benefits. The Project will define, allocate, and enhance management of \n11. \n1  million  ha  of  special-use  and  protected  forests,  mostly  in  important  watershed  areas. \nWatersheds provide many environmental services such as smoothing flows for flood protection \nand  the  provision  of  dry  season  water  flows,  as  well  as  water  filtration  and  protection. \nWatersheds  also  support  downstream  economic  activities  such  as  fisheries  by  protecting \nhabitats and nursery grounds, as well as water-supply schemes. Very conservative assumptions \non  benefits  from  NTFPs  and  such  environmental  services  as  preventing  soil  erosion  generate \nbenefits worth $5 million per annum. The present value of this benefit stream, at 10% discount \nrate for 40 years, is about $49 million, far exceeding expenditure. The ecological importance of \nthe natural forests for conserving biodiversity, the extent to which the water resources are used \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nfor  hydro-power  generation  and  irrigation,  and  the  negative  impact  of  flood  damage  would \nsuggest a much higher economic value. \n\nC. \n\nFinancial Sustainability \n\n12. \nSustainability of financing for livelihood plantation has been guaranteed by the proposed \nequity  model.  While  contributing  to  poverty  reduction  significantly,  commune  development \nfunds,  created  to  finance  this  component,  recover  adequate  funds  (30%  of  revenue)  to  allow \nrepeating  support  for  other  farmers.  Revenue  from  sustainable  natural  production  forest \nmanagement  and  natural  resource  taxes  from  plantation  activities  will  generate  adequate \nrevenues for the Government to repay the loan and continue to support the forest management \nregimes put in place by the Project. Tax revenues (the 4% natural resources tax) from natural \nand plantation forestry components will be $1.86 million in 2006\u20132010 and $2 million in 2011\u2013\n2015. Fiscal affordability analysis shows that the revenue stream from the natural resource tax \nalone is adequate to repay the loan. If private sector development takes place as envisaged, it \nwill generate an additional $6 million in annual Government revenues. The expected expansion \nof  the  forestry  sector  will  lead  to  parallel  expansion  of  processing  activities.  The  Government \ncharges 22% percent sales tax on processed wood products. The incremental increase in sales \ntax due to project intervention will be substantial. These extra revenues, which come at the later \npart of project implementation, and surplus from the natural resource tax after paying the debt \nservices, is more than adequate to sustain financial support for forestry sector activities after the \nproject implementation period. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 27 September 2006) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "D1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n", "dong (D) \n \n$0.00006234 \nD16,040 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "5MHRP \nADB  \nBCI  \nCDF  \nCDM  \nCFM \nCIP \nCPC  \nCPMU  \nCPRGS \nDARD  \nEA \nEMDP  \nFDS  \nFIRR \nFLITCH \n", "FSP \nFSSP \nGAD \nGDP \nGIS  \nGMS \nGPS \nGTZ  \n", "LIEMDP  \n", "MARD  \nMOLISA  \nNTFP  \nPFMB  \nPLUPLA \nPPMU \nSDR \nSFE \nSFM \nSGIA \nSME  \nSOE \nSUF  \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "5 million hectare reforestation program \nAsian Development Bank \nBiodiversity Conservation Corridor Initiative \ncommune development fund \nclean development mechanism \ncommunity forest management \ncommune investment plan \ncommune people\u2019s committee \ncentral project management unit \ncomprehensive poverty reduction and growth strategy \nDepartment of Agriculture and Rural Development \nexecuting agency \nEthnic Minorities Development Plan \nForestry Development Strategy \nfinancial internal rate of return \nForests for Livelihood Improvement in the Central \nHighlands Sector Project \nForestry Sector Project \nForest Sector Support Program and Partnership \ngender and development \ngross domestic product \ngeographic information system \nGreater Mekong Subregion \nglobal positioning system \nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit \n(German Agency for Technical Cooperation) \nlivelihoods development and ethnic minorities \ndevelopment plan \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development \nMinistry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs \nnon-timber forest product \nprotected forest management board \nparticipatory land-use planning and forestland allocation \nprovincial project management unit \nspecial drawing rights \nstate forest enterprise \nsustainable forest management \nsecond generation imprest account \nsmall or medium enterprise \nstate-owned enterprise \nspecial-use forest \n", "TA \nTFF \nUIEMG \nVDG \nVWU \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "technical assistance \nTrust Fund for Forests \nupland indigenous ethnic minority group \nViet Nam development goals \nVietnamese Women\u2019s Union \n", "NOTES \n \nThe fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", " \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n", "C.
