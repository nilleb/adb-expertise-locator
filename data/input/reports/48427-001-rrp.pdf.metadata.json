THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic  approach  for  the  Encouraging  Investment  through  Capital  Market  Reforms \nProgram,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  policy-based  loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for \nsubprogram 1 of the Encouraging Investment through Capital Market Reforms Program.1 \n \n2.  The program will supplement coordinated support provided by the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  accelerate  investment,  including  infrastructure  through  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs), by increasing the availability of long-term finance to fund these ventures. \nThe program will apply sequenced reforms to (i) develop the government bond market as a \nprecursor to further developing the corporate and/or project bond market, (ii) encourage growth \nin domestic long-term savings, and (iii) ease barriers to entry to diversify and broaden available \nsources of long-term finance. The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor 2011\u20132016 which focuses on supporting infrastructure development,  and is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for delivery in 2015.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The development problem. The Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2011\u201320163 calls \nfor real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 7.0%\u20138.0% per year, investment ratios \nreaching 22.0% by 2016 (2011\u20132013 average was 19.7%), and a corresponding reduction in \nextreme poverty to 17.0% (33% in 1991). In recognition of the key role played by investment in \nmeeting  the  broader  goals  of  inclusive  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  the  PDP \ntargeted public infrastructure spending at 5.0% of GDP with private infrastructure spending \nexceeding 1.0% of GDP, all by 2016.4 The government has achieved measured success in \nmeeting these targets. As fiscal reforms initiated in 2010 began to take hold, public spending on \ninfrastructure rose to 3.5% of GDP in 2014 from 2.2% of GDP in 2012, with private sector \nspending increasing to approximately 1.0% of GDP. However, infrastructure needs continue to \n \nballoon, with recent estimates calling for annual infrastructure spending of 6% of GDP.\n \n4.  Despite being relatively large and well-capitalized, the intermediation provided by banks \nto the economy is insufficient to close this widening investment funding gap (Figure 1a). At the \nsame time, the central bank is implementing Basel III and will allow the exemption to the single \nborrower\u2019s limit for PPPs to lapse in 2016, which will further curtail the sector\u2019s ability to fund \ninfrastructure development with short-term deposits.  Local currency bonds represent a viable \nalternative and are still growing at a respectable pace despite a recent slowdown in regional \nlocal currency bond markets.5 Nevertheless, the local currency bond market represents only \n37% of GDP, is small relative to regional peers, and also provides limited intermediation to the \neconomy. Malaysia and Thailand have local currency debt markets that exceed 75% of GDP, \nand their local currency corporate debt markets are 3\u20138 times the size of the Philippine market \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n4  The Global Competitiveness Report, 2013\u20132014 has identified the inadequate supply of infrastructure as the most \nproblematic factor in doing business in the Philippines. \n5  Philippine local currency corporate bonds exhibited the fastest year-on-year growth through 2014 relative to \nregional peers at 27%, albeit from a very low base. ", "2 \n \n(Figure  1b).  In  the  government  bond  market,  liquidity  is  low  with  bid\u2013ask  spreads  (a \nfundamental measure of liquidity) higher than in all regional peers except for Indonesia and Viet \nNam.  Trading  activity  has  been  depressed  by  an  underdeveloped  issuance  process, \nfragmentation caused by too many outstanding issues, and high costs. As a result, reliance on \nlow-volume  issues  produces  a  yield  curve  that  does  not  provide  a  fully  reliable  pricing \nbenchmark for corporate or infrastructure bonds. \n \n \nFigure 1: Finance Sector \u2013 Regional Comparison \n \n(a) Size of Finance Sector to GDP (2013) (b) LCY Corporate Bonds (2010\u20132014) \n   \n  450 45\n  400 40\n  350 35\n  300 30\nP\n   % of GD220500 % GDP 2250\n150 15\n \n100 10\n  50 5\n  0 0\n  Viet Nam Thailand Singapore Malaysia PhilippinesIndonesia Thailand Singapore Malaysia Philippines Indonesia\n  Bank credit LCY corporate LCY government Equity   2010 2012 2014  \n  GDP = gross domestic product, LCY = local currency.   \n  Sources: Asian Bonds Online; and Asian Development Bank. 2014. Key Indicators 2014. Manila. \n \n5.  The  binding  constraints. The government has recognized the set of challenges it \nneeds to deal with to improve financial intermediation in the economy, including: (i) addressing \nthe absence of a money market which discourages the wider development of the capital market, \n(ii) encouraging long term contractual savings and investment products, and (iii) diversifying the \ninvestor base. These binding constraints are elaborated in paragraphs 6 to 9 below. \n \n6.  The  development  of  the  local  currency  bond  market  has  been  constrained  by  the \nabsence of a short-term money market. This market facilitates price discovery by setting short \nterm  market  determined  pricing  benchmarks  (interest  rates)  and  supports  the  conduct  of \nefficient and effective monetary policy. It is a key prerequisite to wider market development. In \nthe  Philippines,  a  legally  mandated  bond  sinking  fund  holds  approximately  20%  of  all \noutstanding government debt (about P980 billion as of September 2012) and provides cash to \noffset temporary revenue gaps.6 This practice has discouraged the development of robust cash \nmanagement at the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) and has led to a critical shortage of short-term \ntreasury bills. Without a ready supply of short-term bills, the central bank utilizes monetary \ninterventions which do not produce market determined short term pricing benchmarks (e.g., \ndeposit accounts with administered rates). Classic monetary policy, on the other hand, relies on \nbuying and selling short-term government treasury bills. This provides for more efficient and \neffective  monetary  management. In  addition,  classic  monetary  policy  provides  an  enabling \nenvironment for trading of liquidity between banks, and the establishment of the necessary \nmarket determined pricing benchmarks. Moreover, the use of the sinking fund produces a \nnegative carry of approximate 2% per annum, or a cost to government of P20 billion per year.  \n \n7.  Reforms in the government bond market need to encompass a variety of technical \nissues but fundamentally the government needs to encourage higher levels of trading, increase \n                                                \n6  Republic Act 1000 of 1954. ", "3 \n \nliquidity, and provide a reliable yield curve so that the corporate bond market and other financial \ninstruments can develop. First, the total number of outstanding government issues is too high, \nand so trading activity is spread too thinly among the issues. 7 In addition, primary dealers are \nnot held to minimum obligations of participation in primary auctions, secondary market making, \nor information disclosure, and conversely do not enjoy any privileges. Further compounding this \nproblem, primary dealers lack the risk management tools, such as repos and interest rate \nderivatives. Without these tools, primary dealers cannot act as market makers, which is a base \nrequirement for increasing liquidity.8 Moreover, the market suffers from a bifurcation between \ntaxable and nontaxable investors, which effectively prohibits trading between the groups. \n \n8.  The domestic investor base does not provide sufficient demand. The contractual savings \nsector (insurance and pensions) in particular represents a potential engine of demand for long-\ntenor capital markets products.9 Growth trends in this sector are positive and, unlike other \nregional peers, the focus of the industry still produces demand for long-term investments.10 \nHowever, the development of the insurance sector has been constrained by financial literacy \nissues, as well as restrictive investment guidelines coupled with narrow distribution channels. \nCorporate and project bonds represent an especially challenging investment for the sector given \nthe  lack  of  reliable  national  credit  rating  agencies,  as  well  as  capacity  and  regulatory \nconstraints. Moreover, investors have not been provided any incentives, such as a tax-deferred \nretirement savings plan, to defer consumption to a later date. Premium taxes are among the \nhighest in the region and impede growth in the insurance industry. \n \n9.  The domestic investor base is  not diversified. A historical restriction on the foreign \nownership of domestic financial institutions has led to the development of a \u201cone-way\u201d market \nwherein most participants practice buy-and-hold strategies. As a result, more sophisticated \ntrading strategies and business models, such as the resale of loans to end investors through \nsecuritization and project finance, have yet to emerge. Speculative trading must be encouraged \nso those seeking to hedge will find willing counterparties at reasonable cost. Finally, the limited \nadoption of international standards has exacerbated these constraints as the Philippines is the \nonly country among the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) 6, which has not yet \nsigned  the  Multilateral  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MMOU)  of  the  International \nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). 11  Bank secrecy laws complicate efforts to \nshare information with foreign supervisors, although the authorities are devising mechanisms to \naddress this impediment. Lacking this agreement, the Philippines has been unable to fully \nparticipate in the cross-border investment initiatives of the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum. \n \n10.  The  government\u2019s  sector  strategy.  The  government  recognizes  these  binding \nconstraints and has aligned its reform agenda to focus on promoting savings generation and \ndeveloping  an  enabling  environment  for  long-term  investments. Within  this  framework,  the \ngovernment has adopted a capital market blueprint covering 2011\u20132016. Initiatives have been \nidentified to improve cash management and forecasting, develop a money market, and increase \nliquidity  in  the  government  bond  market.  A  primary  dealer  system  will  be  established, \nfragmentation will be reduced, and pricing between participants will be harmonized. In addition, \nthe government will launch an interdealer repo market and introduce securities lending. Savers \n                                                \n7  Currently, only the 10- and 20-year benchmarks have achieved sufficient size to serve as reliable benchmarks. \n8  The inability of dealers to \u201cshort\u201d bonds to offset long positions is considered a major impediment. \n9  For  example,  the  investment  holdings  of  this  sector  and  the  trust  divisions  of  banks  currently  aggregate \napproximately $86 billion, representing 32% of GDP. \n10 The industry relies heavily on endowment products (whole life policies) which require investment in long-duration \ninvestments such as infrastructure bonds. \n11 Members of the ASEAN 6: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. \n ", "4 \n \nwill be provided the opportunity to become investors through an enabling environment that \nincludes  wider  investment  alternatives,  appropriate  prudential  guidelines,  and  a  national \nfinancial education program. A tax-deferred retirement savings account will be launched. Finally, \nefforts to enlarge and diversify domestic financial markets will be supported through faster \nintegration of the financial system into ASEAN and the global financial markets. \n \n \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s  experience.  ADB  has  supported  reforms  in  the  finance  sector  with  four \nprogrammatic approach policy-based loans and substantial technical assistance (TA) between \n1995 and 2010 (Figure 2). ADB\u2019s initial focus consolidated the markets, enhanced transparency \nand  accountability,  and  supported  capacity  development.  The  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission (SEC) was restructured and its enforcement capacity was strengthened. ADB\u2019s \nprograms then focused on the nonbank finance subsector; governance of the Philippine Stock \nExchange  (PSE)  was  improved,  market  oversight  was  strengthened,  and  an  anti-money-\nlaundering regime was established. More recently, ADB promoted market liquidity, financial \ndeepening,  and  stronger  intermediaries.  Reporting  and  disclosure  practices  were  set  to \ninternational  standards,  settlement  and  payment  systems  were  improved,  and  regulatory \ncapabilities were further strengthened. Going forward, ADB will utilize a highly coordinated \napproach to guide its programmatic support. Through the proposed program, ADB will continue \nto work with the government to enhance liquidity in the government bond market, encourage \nlong-term savings and investments, and increase market depth and diversity. The proposed \nprogram  supplements  ADB's  proposed  Expanding  Private  Participation  in  Infrastructure \nProgram (EPPIP) by addressing impediments to capital market financing of PPPs. Concurrent \nwith  these  efforts,  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  encourage  the  local \ncurrency  bond market  to  support  infrastructure  through  selective  support to  local  currency \nproject bonds.12 The program will also lay the foundations for a dedicated financial inclusion \nprogram planned for 2018. \n \n12.  Lessons learned from the experience. Several lessons have been learned during \nADB\u2019s long-term engagement in the Philippines finance sector that have helped inform the \nprogram. First, sound public finances are a prerequisite for pursuing capital market development. \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Partial Credit \nGuarantee and Loan for the Tiwi and MakBan Geothermal Power Green Bonds Project in the Philippines. Manila. ", "5 \n \nThe  credit  rating  upgrades  provide  broad  flexibility  for  reforms  while  enhanced  cash \nmanagement  provides  a  key  prerequisite  for  development  of  a  money  market.  Second,  a \ncollaborative diagnostic13 of the government bond market, completed in 2014, highlighted that \nprevious interventions had accomplished much.14 However, the diagnostic also illustrated that \nthe reforms had not been integrated or modernized in step with the wider financial markets and \nadvancements in international standards. In addition, the structure and technical capacity of the \nBTr did not receive sufficient attention. As a result, development of the government bond market \nlagged  the  banking  sector  and  equity  market.  Third,  ADB\u2019s  wider  experience,  which  is \nconsistent with the diagnostic, underscores that finance sector development is hierarchical and \nthat sequencing of reforms matters. Key foundation reforms must be successfully implemented \nbefore moving on to complex or higher-order reforms, and reform requires a continuous effort to \nkeep pace with changes in global financial markets and new emerging risks to stability. Fourth, \na  published  program  completion  report  provided  project-specific  lessons  which  were \nincorporated into the design of the program, such as the need to focus on key reforms in key \nsubsectors backed by demonstrated political will.15 In addition, efforts to develop domestic \ncapital markets are enhanced through a \u201cone ADB\u201d approach wherein all departments, such as \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department, provide highly coordinated support. \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s value added to the design and implementation of the program. ADB\u2019s recent \nengagement  began  in  2011  with  policy  dialogue  and  supporting  TA.16 A  comprehensive \ndiagnostic  of  the  SEC  and  subsequent  engagements  strengthened  supervision,  upgraded \nsystems, and is currently providing assistance to facilitate the issuance of project bonds. The \ninfrastructure to launch the Personal Equity and Retirement Account (PERA) was completed. \nThis engagement was followed by a series of TA projects17 which supported a reorganization of \nthe BTr, improved its technical capacity, and provided the framework to launch a repo market. \nSupport is being provided to institutionalize a middle office and risk management function, and \nto upgrade the treasury management system and registry of scripless securities. \n \n14.  Development partner coordination. There is strong development partner coordination \nbehind the government\u2019s capital market reform agenda.18 The Government of Australia has \nbeen supporting the Philippines\u2013Australia Public Financial Management Program through which \nthe treasury single account was launched. The government bond market diagnostic is also \nproviding a template for donor coordination. The US Treasury is providing a resident advisor to \nstrengthen the primary dealer system, while ADB is providing TA to modernize infrastructure, \nstrengthen cash management, introduce a repo market, and develop capacity. The International \nMonetary Fund is providing intermittent follow-up support and advice to strengthen the conduct \nof monetary policy. The Japan International Cooperation Agency is considering parallel funding \nfor the program and is providing assistance to the SEC to enhance reporting and surveillance \nand to better utilize credit information to increase financial inclusion. \n \n                                                \n13 Undertaken by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, ADB, and the United States Treasury. \n14 An automated debt auction processing system was established, a registry of scripless securities was introduced, a \nnascent primary dealer system was created, and straight-through processing was implemented. \n15 ADB. 2013.

The use of a programmatic approach with a \npolicy-based loan providing budget support leverages a longer-term policy reform program. The \nprogrammatic approach  begins with the recommendations of the government bond market \ndiagnostic and will build on ADB\u2019s previous engagements to properly sequence reforms to \nincrease access to long-term finance, complementing the medium-term PPP reform agenda. \nThe program utilizes two subprograms concentrating initially on improving cash forecasting, \nreducing bond market fragmentation, and establishing an enabling environment for a money \nmarket to increase trading activity and provide reliable price discovery. Subsequent reforms in \nsubprogram  2  will  address the  conditions  necessary  to  establish  a reliable  yield  curve  by \nprogressively introducing additive and more complex reforms, including a primary dealer system. \nSubprogram 2 will also increase the availability of long-term finance by launching a tax-deferred \nlong-term retirement savings program, diversifying market participants, and expanding long-\nterm funding models. A medium-term agenda and expected results framework will be used to \ncontinue ADB\u2019s engagement, assess program effectiveness, and provide an eventual pivot into \nwider financial inclusion efforts to supplement those of the central bank. \n \n16.  Economic impact of the program. The program achieves important impacts. The first \nis  substantial fiscal  savings from  a more  efficient management  of  liquid  assets  (para  18). \nSecond, reforms to treasury operations and the government bond market are expected to not \nonly deepen the bond market but also produce efficiencies. These efficiencies will be passed on \nthrough lower yields on corporate bonds, thereby lowering the cost of capital. The program is \nalso expected to increase the wealth of individuals through better retirement incomes (para. 26). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The program is aligned with the PDP and will contribute to meeting the government\u2019s \ntargeted investment rate. The outcome will be a deeper nonbank finance sector. Subprogram 1 \ncontains 20 policy actions, of which 10 are triggers, all of which have been accomplished. \nSubprogram 2 will deepen the reforms and contains 22 policy actions of which 9 are triggers.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n18.   Output  1:  Liquidity  in  the  government  bond  market  enhanced.  Improved  cash \nmanagement will encourage trading of liquidity, develop a money market, and contribute to the \ndevelopment of short term pricing benchmarks. Accomplishments achieved under subprogram 1 \ninclude the following. To improve control over cash, the BTr has consolidated 603 government \nbank accounts into a treasury single account in line with international best practices. In addition, \nthe BTr adopted a fee-based compensation scheme for its revenue collection banks which \nstrengthened controls and reduced opportunity costs by approximately  P1 billion per year. \nFurther, the BTr reduced the cost of carry associated with maintaining the Bond Sinking Fund \nby reducing its size, yielding an estimated annual saving of P2 billion\u2013P3 billion. These reforms \nwill, in time, increase the ability of the BTr to issue short-term treasury bills. To provide a key \nprerequisite for a reliable yield curve, the  government also adopted measures to increase \nliquidity and trading activity in the government bond market. First, the Department of Finance \n(DOF) reduced market bifurcation by enabling the taxable and tax-exempt sectors to trade freely \nwith one another.19 The BTr then reduced the number of outstanding government bond issues \nfrom 204 to 118 to increase trading volumes in the remaining outstanding benchmark issues. \nThe BTr introduced the international-standard Global Master Repurchase Agreement which \nsupports  the  development  of  a  money  market  and  the  introduction  of  diversified  trading \n                                                \n19 The total outstanding reserves of two major government pension schemes are approximately $18.7 billion. ", "7 \n \nstrategies, including hedging. Finally, the BTr has modernized its operations and established a \nRisk Management Division, Fund Management Division, Capital Market Strategy and Planning \nDivision, and a Debt Strategy and Planning Division. \n \n19.  In subprogram 2, the government will build on these reforms by implementing additional \nmeasures to further improve cash management and forecasts, and to support the formation of a \nreliable yield curve. The government will continue to defragment the market by concentrating \ntrading into key benchmark securities, and a primary dealer system will be launched with a \nbasic set of responsibilities and privileges. To encourage market making, the BTr will sponsor a \ntargeted repo program for selected dealers who will provide firm two-way price quotes (prices) \nfor  eligible  government  securities.  The  BTr  will  complete  installation  of  the  new  treasury \nmanagement system, institutionalize middle office risk management, and establish performance \nmanagement and exception reporting. \n \n20.  Output  2:  Long-term  savings  and  long-term  investment  products  encouraged. \nAccomplishments include measures to encourage savers to become investors, which will lead \nto an increase in the supply of long-term savings. In subprogram 1, the government encouraged \nmore domestic participation in the finance sector, with an emphasis on contractual savings. The \nrevised Insurance Code authorized a wider diversity of investments for the sector, including \nproject bonds, and increased the range of permissible investment strategies. The infrastructure \nneeded to support the introduction of a tax-deferred long-term retirement savings platform\u2014the \nPERA\u2014has been completed. The SEC, in conjunction with the PSE, encouraged professional \nmanagement of collective investments by launching exchange-traded funds. Simultaneously, \nthe government reduced the costs of financial transactions by introducing a bill to cut premium \ntaxes on nonlife policies, removing the documentary stamp tax from repo transactions (policy \naction 13), and accelerating the processing of applications for business registration. \n \n21.  In subprogram 2, the government will continue to encourage the development of long-\nterm savings and investment, and will establish an interagency memorandum of understanding \nto promote neutrality in capital market taxation. The PERA system will be launched and opened \nto public participation. The Insurance Commission will explore alternative investment schemes \n(e.g.  structured  finance),  and  encourage  insurance  companies  to  channel  funds  to  PPPs. \nSimilarly, the SEC, in conjunction with the PSE, will support the expansion of exchange-traded \nfunds  including  both  equity  and  fixed-income.  Finally,  the  SEC  will  submit  the  revised \nCorporation  Code  to  Congress  to  introduce  one-man  corporations,  perpetual  corporate \nexistence  and  registration,  XBRL-based  electronic  submission  of  financial  statements,  and \nstrengthened anticorruption provisions. \n \n22.  Output  3:  Market  depth  and  diversity  increased.  The  government  has  adopted \nreforms to increase competition, diversify participants and business models, and introduce new \nskill  sets.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  1  include  the  following.  The  government \nauthorized up to 100% foreign ownership in financial institutions.20 An application for admittance \nto IOSCO\u2019s MMOU has been filed, which will position the government for deeper participation in \nASEAN  cross-border  investment  initiatives.  Parallel  efforts  to  strengthen  governance  and \nsupervision in line with international standards have been enacted, including the issuance of \nguidelines covering the accreditation and operating standards of credit rating agencies. The \nSEC created a corporate governance and finance department and issued guidelines mandating \nall publicly listed companies to publish an annual corporate governance report. Incentives to \n                                                \n20 Republic Act 10607, The Revised Insurance Code; Republic Act 10641, an act allowing the full entry of foreign \nbanks into the Philippines; and BSP Circular No.858. \n ", "8 \n \nstrengthen governance have been provided by completing the ASEAN corporate governance \nscorecard assessment for 2013\u20132014. Surveillance of the equities market has been improved \nand efforts made to strengthen surveillance of the fixed-income market. \n \n23.  In subprogram 2, the government will strengthen the insurance sector by encouraging \nconsolidation  through  increased  capitalization  and  the  introduction  of  risk-based  capital \nstandards. The government will sign IOSCO\u2019s MMOU and will participate more fully in ASEAN \ncross-border investment initiatives. The SEC, in conjunction with the PSE, will promulgate a \nnew code of corporate governance and a corporate governance road map. The SEC, through \nthe  Institute  of  Corporate  Directors,  will  participate  in  the  ASEAN  corporate  governance \nscorecard assessment and the SEC will establish surveillance of the fixed-income market. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n24.  The government has requested a policy-based loan of $300 million from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 1, with an equivalent amount programmed for \nsubprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, annuity \nmethod  with  30%  discount,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement (the average \nmaturity is 12.1 years). The Government of Japan, through the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency,  is  considering  parallel  financing  for  subprogram  1  in  the  amount  of  $100  million \nequivalent. The loan size is based on the financing needs of the Philippines, the development \nimpact of the policy reform package, and development spending arising from the reform. The \nPhilippines\u2019 gross financing needs remain high. In 2015, with a budget deficit target of 2% of \nGDP, the government will need to borrow $15.6 billion to close the budget gap, of which $1.65 \nbillion will be obtained through official development assistance. The program impacts the budget \nthrough concessionary tax treatment of PERA accounts and incremental spending on the capital \nmarket reforms (para. 26). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The DOF will be the executing agency; the Bureau of the Treasury and the SEC will be \nimplementing  agencies.  A  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  Department  of  Finance  with \nimplementing agencies as members, will oversee the implementation of the program.21 The \nsteering committee will meet semiannually and, if needed, on an ad hoc basis to monitor \nprogress in implementing reforms under the program and to provide guidance and direction to \nthe DOF and the implementing agencies. The government will invite ADB and development \npartners to participate as observers. The implementation period is January 2013\u2013June 2015 for \nsubprogram 1 and July 2015\u2013June 2017 for subprogram 2.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  A  growing  body  of  empirical  research  produces  a  remarkably  consistent  narrative: \nfinance sector development exerts a first-order impact on long-run economic growth.22 On a \n                                                \n21 The Insurance Commission and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will be committee members, reflecting ADB\u2019s \nongoing TA to each and the role of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in supporting financial inclusion and literacy. \n22 Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \n \nproject-specific level, the program impact assessment23 estimates that the recurrent quantifiable \nbenefits of the program have a present value of $1.2 billion, under conservative discounting \nassumptions, and well exceed the program\u2019s estimated costs. Of this, approximately, $890 \nmillion flows to the government from more efficient use of liquid assets. A further $290 million is \nexpected to flow to the corporate sector from improvements to the corporate bond market, and \nindividuals are expected to benefit from a $50 million efficiency improvement in the insurance \nmarket. In addition to these recurrent benefits, better retirement incomes are expected to lift \nindividual  wealth  by  $143  million  over  10  years.  Significant,  if  unquantifiable,  benefits  are \nexpected to flow from greater efficiency in the non-life-insurance sector and from initiatives to \ndeepen the markets in investment vehicles, such as exchange-traded funds. The reforms will \nentail some costs, such as the concessionary tax treatment on PERA accounts estimated at $80 \nmillion. Other costs, while not insignificant, are small relative to the potential benefits. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n27.  The government\u2019s public financial management system has been strengthened with the \nimplementation of the 2011 public financial management reform road map. On the basis of the \n2014 update of the 2010 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability  assessment, the \naverage scores for three of the six dimensions (comprehensiveness and transparency; policy-\nbased budgeting; and accounting, recording, and reporting) have improved. Areas where no \nprogress was observed since 2010 included budget credibility, predictability and control in \nbudget execution, and external scrutiny and audit (e.g., legislative scrutiny of external audit \nreports). The government has adopted the unified account code structure which harmonizes \nbudget classification and accounts codes, and the treasury single account which improves cash \nmanagement  and  control.  Other  initiatives  include  adopting  new  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards that are in line with international standards, involving civil society organizations in the \nnational budget process, and carrying out citizen participatory audit. The remaining challenges \ninclude the need to strengthen the annual budget process, provide comparative accounting data, \nand strengthen revenue administration and internal controls.24 \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the DOF. The Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Cabinet Cluster \nis developing a comprehensive and results-based anticorruption action plan, drawing on a \nreview of the National Anti-Corruption Plan of Action. Initiatives are under way by various \ndevelopment partners to strengthen the capacity of the Office of the Ombudsman and the \njustice sector to perform their investigative and prosecutorial functions. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  Finance  sector  development  helps  reduce  poverty  through  at  least  three  channels: \nhigher economic growth, finance sector inclusiveness, and finance sector stability. The program \ncontributes  to  poverty  reduction  by  encouraging  the  nonbank  finance  sector  to  support \ninfrastructure  development  through  the  provision  of  long-term  peso-denominated  financing. \nIncreased  investments  in  infrastructure  will  lead  to  increased  employment  and,  in  turn, \ngovernment tax revenues. While the program does not directly focus on financial inclusion, \nreforms to retirement income policies and policy improvements in the insurance industry lay \ndown foundations for ADB\u2019s future engagement in this area. \n \n                                                \n23 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Assessment of Public Financial Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  The program will not entail any involuntary resettlement or affect indigenous people or \nthe  environment.  It  is  assigned  category  C  for  all  safeguards  categories  (involuntary \nresettlement, impact on indigenous people, and environmental impact). \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  The  program  is  exposed  to  broad  national  and  macroeconomic  risks  and  risks \nassociated with public financial management and corruption. ADB is actively coordinating with \nother development partners to mitigate these risks. A macroeconomic and debt sustainability \nassessment  has  been  prepared  and  documents  these  risks  as  low.25 Strong  economic \nperformance over the past 4 years has produced one of the fastest growth rates in Southeast \nAsia with a corresponding decline in the level of public debt relative to GDP. However, risks \narising out of the public financial management and procurement systems, as well as corruption, \nare considered high. To mitigate these risks, ADB is providing high-level leadership to facilitate \ninteragency coordination to implement the government\u2019s whole of government approach to the \nentire public financial management cycle. ADB will support the revision of legislation supporting \nprocurement  to  enable  the  participation  of  a  wider  range  of  bidders,  including  the  direct \nparticipation of foreign firms, and is working to strengthen the bid and evaluation process. In \naddition, ADB will participate in the government\u2019s efforts to develop a comprehensive and \nresults-based anticorruption action plan, drawing on a review of the National Anti-Corruption \nPlan of Action. Program-specific risks, including specific risks and corresponding mitigating \nmeasures, are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n32.  The government and the DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan documents. \n \n   V.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the  programmatic  approach  for  the  Encouraging  Investment  through  Capital \nMarket Reforms Program; and \n(ii)  the loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of \nthe  Encouraging  Investment  through  Capital  Market  Reforms  Program,  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a \nterm of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n27 October 2015 \n                                                \n25 Macroeconomic and Debt Sustainability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

In \ndoing so, the program will establish a framework through which private funding can be channeled to boost private \ninvestment in infrastructure. To accomplish this objective, the program will address fundamental constraints to \nbond market development, encourage growth in long-term savings, and diversify the investor base. \n \nImpact: The Encouraging Investment through Capital Market Reforms Program is aligned with the Philippine \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132016  and  will  contribute  to  meeting  the  government\u2019s  targeted  investment  rate, \nincluding public and private spending on infrastructure.  \n \nOutcome: The outcome will be a deeper nonbank finance sector, measured by an increase in corporate bonds \nrelative to GDP, participation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) cross-border initiatives, and \ngrowth in contractual and long-term retirement savings. \nHighlights of \n \nBackground \n\uf0d8  The program will build on ADB\u2019s comprehensive engagement with the Philippine financial sector, which \ndates from 2010, and will seek to increase the supply of long-term investable fundsavailable through the \nprivate sector.  \n\uf0b2  The program will address development constraints in the government bond market, which is a \nfundamental building block of financial market development, to facilitate the eventual issuance of \ncorporate and project bonds. \n\uf0b2  The program will increase the size of the domestic capital market by building up the contractual \nsavings sector, eliminating costs on financial transactions, and easing administrative burdens. At the \nsame time, the program will increase demand for capital market products by encouraging short-term \nsavers to become long-term investors. \n\uf0b2  Finally, the program will increase the diversity of participants and business models, and increase the \navailable pool of savings, by encouraging deeper regulatory harmonization within Association of \nSouth East Asian Nations (ASEAN) through the ASEAN Capital Market Forum. \n \n   ", "Appendix 4  21 \n  Medium-term \n  Subprogram 2 \nSubprogram 1 Accomplishments  directions and \nOutputs  (Policy triggers In bold) \n(Policy triggers in bold)  expected results \n  July 2015 to June 2017 \nJune 2013 to June 2015  2013 to 2021 \nOutput 1: Government Bond Market Depth and Liquidity Enhanced \n1.1Money market  The Government of the Philippines  The BTr continues to improve cash  The Btr further \ndeveloped through  (government) (through the Bureau of the  management and forecasts.
