This  is  achieved  by  establishing  a  unified \nstructure  of government bank accounts  via a treasury  single \naccount system. \n \nA broker-dealer firm that accepts the risk of holding a certain \nnumber of shares of a particular security in order to facilitate \ntrading  in  that  security.  Each  market  maker  competes  for \ncustomer order flow by displaying buy and sell quotations for \na  guaranteed  number  of  shares.

These  institutions  must  meet  certain  liquidity \nand quality requirements. Specific privileges typically include; \nactively  participating \nissuance \nprograms,  providing  liquidity  by  quoting  effective  two-way \nprices  for  government  securities  (sales  and  repurchase \nagreements)  under  all  market  conditions,  providing  market \nfeedback  to the  monetary  authorities  and  contributing  to the \ndevelopment  of  the  capital  market.

For the party selling the security \n(and agreeing to repurchase it  in  the future),  it  is  a repo; for \nthe  party  on  the  other  end  of  the  transaction  (buying  the \nsecurity  and  agreeing  to  sell  in  the  future),  it  is  a  reverse \nrepurchase agreement. \n \nA  line  that  plots  the  interest  rates,  at  a  set  point  in  time,  of \nbonds  with  equal  credit  quality  but  differing  maturity  dates. \nThe  most  frequently  reported  yield  curve  compares  the  3-\nmonth,  2-year,  5-year,  and  30-year  US  Treasury  debt.

The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor  2011\u20132016  which  focuses  on  supporting  infrastructure  development,  and  is  included  in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for delivery in 2015.2 \n \n\nto  accelerate \n\ninfrastructure \n\ninvestment, \n\nincluding \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe development problem. The Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2011\u201320163 calls \n3. \nfor real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 7.0%\u20138.0% per year, investment ratios \nreaching  22.0%  by  2016  (2011\u20132013  average  was  19.7%),  and  a  corresponding  reduction  in \nextreme poverty to 17.0% (33% in 1991). In recognition of the key role played by investment in \nmeeting  the  broader  goals  of  inclusive  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  the  PDP \ntargeted  public  infrastructure  spending  at  5.0%  of  GDP  with  private  infrastructure  spending \nexceeding  1.0%  of  GDP,  all  by  2016.4 The  government  has  achieved  measured  success  in \nmeeting these targets. As fiscal reforms initiated in 2010 began to take hold, public spending on \ninfrastructure  rose  to  3.5%  of  GDP  in  2014  from  2.2%  of  GDP  in  2012,  with  private  sector \nspending increasing to approximately 1.0% of GDP. However, infrastructure needs continue to \nballoon, with recent estimates calling for annual infrastructure spending of 6% of GDP. \n \nDespite being relatively large and well-capitalized, the intermediation provided by banks \n4. \nto the economy is insufficient to close this widening investment funding gap (Figure 1a). At the \nsame time, the central bank is implementing Basel III and will allow the exemption to the single \nborrower\u2019s  limit  for  PPPs  to  lapse  in  2016,  which  will  further  curtail  the  sector\u2019s  ability  to  fund \ninfrastructure  development  with  short-term  deposits.    Local  currency  bonds  represent  a  viable \nalternative  and  are  still  growing  at  a  respectable  pace  despite  a  recent  slowdown  in  regional \nlocal  currency  bond  markets.5 Nevertheless,  the  local  currency  bond  market  represents  only \n37% of GDP, is small relative to regional peers, and also provides limited intermediation to the \neconomy.  Malaysia  and Thailand  have  local  currency  debt  markets  that  exceed  75%  of  GDP, \nand their local currency corporate debt markets are 3\u20138 times the size of the Philippine market \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2011.

In  the  government  bond  market,  liquidity  is  low  with  bid\u2013ask  spreads  (a \nfundamental measure of liquidity) higher than in all regional peers except for Indonesia and Viet \nNam.  Trading  activity  has  been  depressed  by  an  underdeveloped  issuance  process, \nfragmentation caused by too many outstanding issues, and high costs. As a result, reliance on \nlow-volume  issues  produces  a  yield  curve  that  does  not  provide  a  fully  reliable  pricing \nbenchmark for corporate or infrastructure bonds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe  binding  constraints.  The  government  has  recognized  the  set  of  challenges  it \n5. \nneeds to deal with to improve financial intermediation in the economy, including: (i) addressing \nthe absence of a money market which discourages the wider development of the capital market, \n(ii) encouraging long term contractual savings and investment products, and (iii) diversifying the \ninvestor base. These binding constraints are elaborated in paragraphs 6 to 9 below. \n \n6. \nThe  development  of  the  local  currency  bond  market  has  been  constrained  by  the \nabsence of a short-term money market. This market facilitates price discovery by setting short \nterm  market  determined  pricing  benchmarks  (interest  rates)  and  supports  the  conduct  of \nefficient and effective monetary policy. It is a key prerequisite to wider market development. In \nthe  Philippines,  a  legally  mandated  bond  sinking  fund  holds  approximately  20%  of  all \noutstanding government debt (about P980 billion as of September 2012) and provides cash to \noffset temporary revenue gaps.6 This practice has discouraged the development of robust cash \nmanagement at the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) and has led to a critical shortage of short-term \ntreasury  bills.  Without  a  ready  supply  of  short-term  bills,  the  central  bank  utilizes  monetary \ninterventions  which  do  not  produce  market  determined  short  term  pricing  benchmarks  (e.g., \ndeposit accounts with administered rates). Classic monetary policy, on the other hand, relies on \nbuying  and  selling  short-term  government  treasury  bills.  This  provides  for  more  efficient  and \neffective  monetary  management.  In  addition,  classic  monetary  policy  provides  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  trading  of  liquidity  between  banks,  and  the  establishment  of  the  necessary \nmarket  determined  pricing  benchmarks.  Moreover,  the  use  of  the  sinking  fund  produces  a \nnegative carry of approximate 2% per annum, or a cost to government of P20 billion per year.  \n \n7. \nReforms  in  the  government  bond  market  need  to  encompass  a  variety  of  technical \nissues but fundamentally the government needs to encourage higher levels of trading, increase \n\n2014\n\n2012\n\n \n\n                                                \n6  Republic Act 1000 of 1954. \n\n\f3 \n\n \n\nliquidity, and provide a reliable yield curve so that the corporate bond market and other financial \ninstruments can develop. First, the total number of outstanding government issues is too high, \nand so trading activity is spread too thinly among the issues. 7 In addition, primary dealers are \nnot held to minimum obligations of participation in primary auctions, secondary market making, \nor information disclosure, and conversely do not enjoy any privileges. Further compounding this \nproblem,  primary  dealers  lack  the  risk  management  tools,  such  as  repos  and  interest  rate \nderivatives. Without these tools, primary dealers cannot act as market makers, which is a base \nrequirement  for  increasing  liquidity.8 Moreover,  the  market  suffers  from  a  bifurcation  between \ntaxable and nontaxable investors, which effectively prohibits trading between the groups. \n \n8. \nThe domestic investor base does not provide sufficient demand. The contractual savings \nsector (insurance and pensions) in particular represents a potential engine of demand for long-\ntenor  capital  markets  products. 9 Growth  trends  in  this  sector  are  positive  and,  unlike  other \nregional  peers,  the  focus  of  the  industry  still  produces  demand  for  long-term  investments.10 \nHowever,  the  development  of  the  insurance  sector  has  been  constrained  by  financial  literacy \nissues,  as  well  as  restrictive  investment  guidelines  coupled  with  narrow  distribution  channels. \nCorporate and project bonds represent an especially challenging investment for the sector given \nthe  lack  of  reliable  national  credit  rating  agencies,  as  well  as  capacity  and  regulatory \nconstraints. Moreover, investors have not been provided any incentives, such as a tax-deferred \nretirement  savings  plan,  to  defer  consumption  to  a  later  date.  Premium  taxes  are  among  the \nhighest in the region and impede growth in the insurance industry. \n \n9. \nThe  domestic  investor  base  is  not  diversified.  A  historical  restriction  on  the  foreign \nownership  of  domestic  financial  institutions  has  led  to the  development  of  a \u201cone-way\u201d  market \nwherein  most  participants  practice  buy-and-hold  strategies.  As  a  result,  more  sophisticated \ntrading  strategies  and  business  models,  such  as  the  resale  of  loans  to  end  investors  through \nsecuritization and project finance, have yet to emerge. Speculative trading must be encouraged \nso those seeking to hedge will find willing counterparties at reasonable cost. Finally, the limited \nadoption of international standards has exacerbated these constraints as the Philippines is the \nonly  country  among  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asia  Nations  (ASEAN)  6,  which  has  not  yet \nsigned \nInternational \nOrganization  of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO). 11   Bank  secrecy  laws  complicate  efforts  to \nshare information with foreign supervisors, although the authorities are devising mechanisms to \naddress  this  impediment.  Lacking  this  agreement,  the  Philippines  has  been  unable  to  fully \nparticipate in the cross-border investment initiatives of the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  sector  strategy.  The  government  recognizes  these  binding \n10. \nconstraints  and  has  aligned  its  reform  agenda  to  focus  on  promoting  savings  generation  and \ndeveloping  an  enabling  environment  for  long-term  investments.  Within  this  framework,  the \ngovernment has adopted a capital market blueprint covering 2011\u20132016. Initiatives have been \nidentified to improve cash management and forecasting, develop a money market, and increase \nliquidity  in  the  government  bond  market.  A  primary  dealer  system  will  be  established, \nfragmentation will be reduced, and pricing between participants will be harmonized. In addition, \nthe government will launch an interdealer repo market and introduce securities lending. Savers \n\nthe  Multilateral  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MMOU)  of \n\nthe \n\n                                                \n7  Currently, only the 10- and 20-year benchmarks have achieved sufficient size to serve as reliable benchmarks. \n8  The inability of dealers to \u201cshort\u201d bonds to offset long positions is considered a major impediment. \n9  For  example,  the  investment  holdings  of  this  sector  and  the  trust  divisions  of  banks  currently  aggregate \n\napproximately $86 billion, representing 32% of GDP. \n\n10 The industry relies heavily on endowment products (whole life policies) which require investment in long-duration \n\ninvestments such as infrastructure bonds. \n\n11 Members of the ASEAN 6: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\nwill  be  provided  the  opportunity  to  become  investors  through  an  enabling  environment  that \nincludes  wider  investment  alternatives,  appropriate  prudential  guidelines,  and  a  national \nfinancial education program. A tax-deferred retirement savings account will be launched. Finally, \nefforts  to  enlarge  and  diversify  domestic  financial  markets  will  be  supported  through  faster \nintegration of the financial system into ASEAN and the global financial markets. \n \n\n \n\n \nADB\u2019s  experience.  ADB  has  supported  reforms  in  the  finance  sector  with  four \n11. \nprogrammatic  approach policy-based  loans and substantial  technical  assistance  (TA)  between \n1995 and 2010 (Figure 2). ADB\u2019s initial focus consolidated the markets, enhanced transparency \nand  accountability,  and  supported  capacity  development.  The  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission  (SEC)  was  restructured  and  its  enforcement  capacity  was  strengthened.  ADB\u2019s \nprograms then focused on the nonbank finance subsector; governance of the Philippine Stock \nExchange  (PSE)  was  improved,  market  oversight  was  strengthened,  and  an  anti-money-\nlaundering  regime  was  established.  More  recently,  ADB  promoted  market  liquidity,  financial \ndeepening,  and  stronger  intermediaries.  Reporting  and  disclosure  practices  were  set  to \ninternational  standards,  settlement  and  payment  systems  were  improved,  and  regulatory \ncapabilities  were  further  strengthened.  Going  forward,  ADB  will  utilize  a  highly  coordinated \napproach to guide its programmatic support. Through the proposed program, ADB will continue \nto  work  with  the  government  to  enhance  liquidity  in  the  government  bond  market,  encourage \nlong-term  savings  and  investments,  and  increase  market  depth  and  diversity.  The  proposed \nprogram  supplements  ADB's  proposed  Expanding  Private  Participation  in  Infrastructure \nProgram  (EPPIP)  by  addressing  impediments  to  capital market financing  of  PPPs.  Concurrent \nwith  these  efforts,  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  encourage  the  local \ncurrency  bond  market  to  support  infrastructure  through  selective  support  to  local  currency \nproject  bonds.12 The  program  will  also  lay  the  foundations  for  a  dedicated  financial  inclusion \nprogram planned for 2018. \n \n12. \nLessons  learned  from  the  experience.  Several  lessons  have  been  learned  during \nADB\u2019s  long-term  engagement  in  the  Philippines  finance  sector  that  have  helped  inform  the \nprogram. First, sound public finances are a prerequisite for pursuing capital market development. \n\n                                                \n12 ADB.  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Partial  Credit \nGuarantee and Loan for the Tiwi and MakBan Geothermal Power Green Bonds Project in the Philippines. Manila. \n\n\f5 \n\n \n\nThe  credit  rating  upgrades  provide  broad  flexibility  for  reforms  while  enhanced  cash \nmanagement  provides  a  key  prerequisite  for  development  of  a  money  market.  Second,  a \ncollaborative  diagnostic13 of  the  government  bond  market,  completed  in  2014,  highlighted  that \nprevious  interventions  had  accomplished  much.14 However,  the  diagnostic  also  illustrated  that \nthe reforms had not been integrated or modernized in step with the wider financial markets and \nadvancements in international standards. In addition, the structure and technical capacity of the \nBTr did not receive sufficient attention. As a result, development of the government bond market \nlagged  the  banking  sector  and  equity  market.  Third,  ADB\u2019s  wider  experience,  which  is \nconsistent with the diagnostic, underscores that finance sector development is hierarchical and \nthat sequencing of reforms matters. Key foundation reforms must be successfully implemented \nbefore moving on to complex or higher-order reforms, and reform requires a continuous effort to \nkeep pace with changes in global financial markets and new emerging risks to stability. Fourth, \nlessons  which  were \na  published  program  completion  report  provided  project-specific \nincorporated  into the  design of  the  program,  such as the  need  to focus on key  reforms  in key \nsubsectors  backed  by  demonstrated  political  will. 15 In  addition,  efforts  to  develop  domestic \ncapital markets are enhanced through a \u201cone ADB\u201d approach wherein all departments, such as \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department, provide highly coordinated support. \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s value added to the design and implementation of the program. ADB\u2019s recent \nengagement  began  in  2011  with  policy  dialogue  and  supporting  TA. 16  A  comprehensive \ndiagnostic  of  the  SEC  and  subsequent  engagements  strengthened  supervision,  upgraded \nsystems,  and  is  currently  providing  assistance  to  facilitate  the  issuance  of  project  bonds.  The \ninfrastructure  to  launch  the  Personal  Equity  and  Retirement  Account  (PERA)  was  completed. \nThis engagement was followed by a series of TA projects17 which supported a reorganization of \nthe BTr, improved its technical capacity, and provided the framework to launch a repo market. \nSupport is being provided to institutionalize a middle office and risk management function, and \nto upgrade the treasury management system and registry of scripless securities. \n \nDevelopment partner coordination. There is strong development partner coordination \n14. \nbehind  the  government\u2019s  capital  market  reform  agenda. 18 The  Government  of  Australia  has \nbeen supporting the Philippines\u2013Australia Public Financial Management Program through which \nthe  treasury  single  account  was  launched.  The  government  bond  market  diagnostic  is  also \nproviding a template for donor coordination. The US Treasury is providing a resident advisor to \nstrengthen  the  primary  dealer  system,  while  ADB  is  providing  TA  to  modernize  infrastructure, \nstrengthen cash management, introduce a repo market, and develop capacity. The International \nMonetary Fund is providing intermittent follow-up support and advice to strengthen the conduct \nof monetary policy. The Japan International Cooperation Agency is considering parallel funding \nfor  the  program  and  is  providing  assistance to the SEC  to  enhance  reporting  and  surveillance \nand to better utilize credit information to increase financial inclusion. \n \n\n                                                \n13 Undertaken by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, ADB, and the United States Treasury. \n14 An automated debt auction processing system was established, a registry of scripless securities was introduced, a \n\nnascent primary dealer system was created, and straight-through processing was implemented. \n\n15 ADB.  2013.

The use  of a  programmatic  approach  with a \n15. \npolicy-based loan providing budget support leverages a longer-term policy reform program. The \nprogrammatic  approach  begins  with  the  recommendations  of  the  government  bond  market \ndiagnostic  and  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  previous  engagements  to  properly  sequence  reforms  to \nincrease  access  to  long-term  finance,  complementing  the  medium-term  PPP  reform  agenda. \nThe  program  utilizes  two  subprograms  concentrating  initially  on  improving  cash  forecasting, \nreducing  bond  market  fragmentation,  and  establishing  an  enabling  environment  for  a  money \nmarket to increase trading activity and provide reliable price discovery.  Subsequent reforms in \nsubprogram  2  will  address  the  conditions  necessary  to  establish  a  reliable  yield  curve  by \nprogressively introducing additive and more complex reforms, including a primary dealer system. \nSubprogram 2 will also increase the availability of long-term finance by launching a tax-deferred \nlong-term  retirement  savings  program,  diversifying  market  participants,  and  expanding  long-\nterm  funding  models.  A  medium-term  agenda  and  expected  results  framework  will  be  used  to \ncontinue ADB\u2019s engagement, assess program effectiveness, and provide an eventual pivot into \nwider financial inclusion efforts to supplement those of the central bank. \n \nEconomic impact  of  the program. The program achieves important impacts. The first \n16. \nis  substantial  fiscal  savings  from  a  more  efficient  management  of  liquid  assets  (para  18). \nSecond,  reforms  to  treasury  operations  and the  government  bond market  are  expected  to  not \nonly deepen the bond market but also produce efficiencies. These efficiencies will be passed on \nthrough  lower  yields  on  corporate  bonds,  thereby  lowering  the  cost  of  capital.  The  program  is \nalso expected to increase the wealth of individuals through better retirement incomes (para. 26). \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe  program  is  aligned  with  the  PDP  and  will  contribute  to  meeting  the  government\u2019s \ntargeted investment rate. The outcome will be a deeper nonbank finance sector. Subprogram 1 \ncontains  20  policy  actions,  of  which  10  are  triggers,  all  of  which  have  been  accomplished. \nSubprogram 2 will deepen the reforms and contains 22 policy actions of which 9 are triggers.  \n \nC. \n \n18.   Output  1:  Liquidity  in  the  government  bond  market  enhanced.  Improved  cash \nmanagement will encourage trading of liquidity, develop a money market, and contribute to the \ndevelopment of short term pricing benchmarks. Accomplishments achieved under subprogram 1 \ninclude the following. To improve control over cash, the BTr has consolidated 603 government \nbank accounts into a treasury single account in line with international best practices. In addition, \nthe  BTr  adopted  a  fee-based  compensation  scheme  for  its  revenue  collection  banks  which \nstrengthened  controls  and  reduced  opportunity  costs  by  approximately  P1  billion  per  year. \nFurther, the  BTr  reduced the  cost  of carry  associated  with maintaining the  Bond  Sinking  Fund \nby reducing its size, yielding an estimated annual saving of P2 billion\u2013P3 billion. These reforms \nwill,  in time,  increase the ability  of  the  BTr to issue  short-term  treasury bills.  To provide  a key \nprerequisite  for  a  reliable  yield  curve,  the  government  also  adopted  measures  to  increase \nliquidity  and  trading  activity  in  the  government  bond  market.  First,  the  Department  of  Finance \n(DOF) reduced market bifurcation by enabling the taxable and tax-exempt sectors to trade freely \nwith one another.19 The BTr then reduced the number of outstanding government bond issues \nfrom  204  to  118  to  increase  trading  volumes  in  the  remaining  outstanding  benchmark  issues. \nThe  BTr  introduced  the  international-standard  Global  Master  Repurchase  Agreement  which \nsupports  the  development  of  a  money  market  and  the  introduction  of  diversified  trading \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n19 The total outstanding reserves of two major government pension schemes are approximately $18.7 billion. \n\n\f7 \n\n \n\nstrategies, including hedging. Finally, the BTr has modernized its operations and established a \nRisk Management Division, Fund Management Division, Capital Market Strategy and Planning \nDivision, and a Debt Strategy and Planning Division. \n \nIn subprogram 2, the government will build on these reforms by implementing additional \n19. \nmeasures to further improve cash management and forecasts, and to support the formation of a \nreliable  yield  curve.  The  government  will  continue  to  defragment  the  market  by  concentrating \ntrading  into  key  benchmark  securities,  and  a  primary  dealer  system  will  be  launched  with  a \nbasic set of responsibilities and privileges. To encourage market making, the BTr will sponsor a \ntargeted repo program for selected dealers who will provide firm two-way price quotes (prices) \nfor  eligible  government  securities.  The  BTr  will  complete  installation  of  the  new  treasury \nmanagement system, institutionalize middle office risk management, and establish performance \nmanagement and exception reporting. \n \n20. \nOutput  2:  Long-term  savings  and  long-term  investment  products  encouraged. \nAccomplishments  include  measures  to  encourage  savers to become investors,  which will  lead \nto an increase in the supply of long-term savings. In subprogram 1, the government encouraged \nmore domestic participation in the finance sector, with an emphasis on contractual savings. The \nrevised  Insurance  Code  authorized  a  wider  diversity  of  investments  for  the  sector,  including \nproject bonds, and increased the range of permissible investment strategies. The infrastructure \nneeded to support the introduction of a tax-deferred long-term retirement savings platform\u2014the \nPERA\u2014has been completed. The SEC,  in conjunction with the PSE, encouraged professional \nmanagement  of  collective  investments  by  launching  exchange-traded  funds.  Simultaneously, \nthe government reduced the costs of financial transactions by introducing a bill to cut premium \ntaxes  on  nonlife  policies,  removing  the  documentary  stamp  tax  from  repo  transactions  (policy \naction 13), and accelerating the processing of applications for business registration. \n \n21. \nIn  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  continue  to  encourage the  development  of  long-\nterm savings and investment, and will establish an interagency memorandum of understanding \nto promote neutrality in capital market taxation. The PERA system will be launched and opened \nto public participation. The Insurance Commission will explore  alternative investment schemes \n(e.g.  structured  finance),  and  encourage  insurance  companies  to  channel  funds  to  PPPs. \nSimilarly, the SEC, in conjunction with the PSE, will support the expansion of exchange-traded \nfunds  including  both  equity  and  fixed-income.  Finally,  the  SEC  will  submit  the  revised \nCorporation  Code  to  Congress  to  introduce  one-man  corporations,  perpetual  corporate \nexistence  and  registration,  XBRL-based  electronic  submission  of  financial  statements,  and \nstrengthened anticorruption provisions. \n \n22. \nOutput  3:  Market  depth  and  diversity  increased.  The  government  has  adopted \nreforms to increase competition, diversify participants and business models, and introduce new \nskill  sets.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  1  include  the  following.  The  government \nauthorized up to 100% foreign ownership in financial institutions.20 An application for admittance \nto IOSCO\u2019s MMOU has been filed, which will position the government for deeper participation in \nASEAN  cross-border  investment  initiatives.  Parallel  efforts  to  strengthen  governance  and \nsupervision  in  line  with  international  standards  have  been  enacted,  including  the  issuance  of \nguidelines  covering  the  accreditation  and  operating  standards  of  credit  rating  agencies.  The \nSEC created a corporate governance and finance department and issued guidelines mandating \nall  publicly  listed  companies  to  publish  an  annual  corporate  governance  report.  Incentives  to \n\n                                                \n20 Republic  Act  10607,  The  Revised  Insurance  Code;  Republic  Act  10641,  an  act  allowing  the  full  entry  of  foreign \n\nbanks into the Philippines; and BSP Circular No.858. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nstrengthen  governance  have  been  provided  by  completing  the  ASEAN  corporate  governance \nscorecard  assessment  for  2013\u20132014.  Surveillance  of  the  equities  market  has  been  improved \nand efforts made to strengthen surveillance of the fixed-income market. \n \nIn  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  strengthen  the  insurance  sector  by  encouraging \n23. \nconsolidation  through  increased  capitalization  and  the  introduction  of  risk-based  capital \nstandards. The government will sign IOSCO\u2019s MMOU and will participate more fully in ASEAN \ncross-border  investment  initiatives.  The  SEC,  in  conjunction  with  the  PSE,  will  promulgate  a \nnew  code of  corporate governance  and  a  corporate governance road map. The  SEC,  through \nthe  Institute  of  Corporate  Directors,  will  participate  in  the  ASEAN  corporate  governance \nscorecard assessment and the SEC will establish surveillance of the fixed-income market. \n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe government has requested a policy-based loan of $300 million from ADB's ordinary \ncapital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1,  with  an  equivalent  amount  programmed  for \nsubprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years,  annuity \nmethod  with  30%  discount,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15% \nper year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement (the average \nmaturity is 12.1 years). The Government of Japan, through the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency,  is  considering  parallel  financing  for  subprogram  1  in  the  amount  of  $100  million \nequivalent. The loan size is based on the financing needs of the Philippines, the  development \nimpact  of  the  policy  reform  package,  and  development  spending  arising  from  the  reform.  The \nPhilippines\u2019  gross  financing  needs  remain  high.  In  2015,  with  a  budget  deficit  target  of  2%  of \nGDP, the government will need to borrow $15.6 billion to close the budget gap, of which $1.65 \nbillion will be obtained through official development assistance. The program impacts the budget \nthrough concessionary tax treatment of PERA accounts and incremental spending on the capital \nmarket reforms (para. 26). \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n \nThe DOF will be the executing agency; the Bureau of the Treasury and the SEC will be \n25. \nimplementing  agencies.  A  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  Department  of  Finance  with \nimplementing  agencies  as  members,  will  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  program.21 The \nsteering  committee  will  meet  semiannually  and,  if  needed,  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  to  monitor \nprogress in implementing reforms under the program and to provide guidance and direction to \nthe  DOF  and  the  implementing  agencies.  The  government  will  invite  ADB  and  development \npartners to participate as observers. The implementation period is January 2013\u2013June 2015 for \nsubprogram 1 and July 2015\u2013June 2017 for subprogram 2.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \nA  growing  body  of  empirical  research  produces  a  remarkably  consistent  narrative: \nfinance  sector  development  exerts  a  first-order  impact  on  long-run  economic  growth.22 On  a \n\n                                                \n21 The  Insurance  Commission  and  the  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  will  be  committee  members,  reflecting  ADB\u2019s \nongoing TA to each and the role of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in supporting financial inclusion and literacy. \n\n22 Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nproject-specific level, the program impact assessment23 estimates that the recurrent quantifiable \nbenefits  of  the  program  have  a  present  value  of  $1.2  billion,  under  conservative  discounting \nassumptions,  and  well  exceed  the  program\u2019s  estimated  costs.  Of  this,  approximately,  $890 \nmillion flows to the government from more efficient use of liquid assets. A further $290 million is \nexpected to flow to the corporate sector from improvements to the corporate bond market, and \nindividuals  are  expected  to  benefit  from  a  $50 million  efficiency  improvement  in the  insurance \nmarket.  In  addition  to  these  recurrent  benefits,  better  retirement  incomes  are  expected  to  lift \nindividual  wealth  by  $143  million  over  10  years.  Significant,  if  unquantifiable,  benefits  are \nexpected  to flow  from  greater  efficiency  in  the  non-life-insurance sector  and from  initiatives  to \ndeepen  the  markets  in  investment  vehicles,  such  as  exchange-traded  funds.  The  reforms  will \nentail some costs, such as the concessionary tax treatment on PERA accounts estimated at $80 \nmillion. Other costs, while not insignificant, are small relative to the potential benefits. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nThe government\u2019s public financial management system has been strengthened with the \nimplementation of the 2011 public financial management reform road map. On the basis of the \n2014  update  of  the  2010  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  assessment,  the \naverage scores for  three  of  the  six  dimensions  (comprehensiveness and transparency;  policy-\nbased  budgeting;  and  accounting,  recording,  and  reporting)  have  improved.  Areas  where  no \nprogress  was  observed  since  2010  included  budget  credibility,  predictability  and  control  in \nbudget  execution,  and  external  scrutiny  and  audit  (e.g.,  legislative  scrutiny  of  external  audit \nreports).  The  government  has  adopted  the  unified  account  code  structure  which  harmonizes \nbudget classification and accounts codes, and the treasury single account which improves cash \nmanagement  and  control.  Other  initiatives  include  adopting  new  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards that are in line with international standards, involving civil society organizations in the \nnational budget process, and carrying out citizen participatory audit. The remaining challenges \ninclude the need to strengthen the annual budget process, provide comparative accounting data, \nand strengthen revenue administration and internal controls.24 \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the DOF. The Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Cabinet Cluster \nis  developing  a  comprehensive  and  results-based  anticorruption  action  plan,  drawing  on  a \nreview  of  the  National  Anti-Corruption  Plan  of  Action.  Initiatives  are  under  way  by  various \ndevelopment  partners  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Office  of  the  Ombudsman  and  the \njustice sector to perform their investigative and prosecutorial functions. \n \nC. \n \n29. \nFinance  sector  development  helps  reduce  poverty  through  at  least  three  channels: \nhigher economic growth, finance sector inclusiveness, and finance sector stability. The program \ncontributes  to  poverty  reduction  by  encouraging  the  nonbank  finance  sector  to  support \ninfrastructure  development  through  the  provision  of  long-term  peso-denominated  financing. \nIncreased  investments  in  infrastructure  will  lead  to  increased  employment  and,  in  turn, \ngovernment  tax  revenues.  While  the  program  does  not  directly  focus  on  financial  inclusion, \nreforms  to  retirement  income  policies  and  policy  improvements  in  the  insurance  industry  lay \ndown foundations for ADB\u2019s future engagement in this area. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n23 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Assessment of Public Financial Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nSafeguards \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nD. \n \n30. \nThe  program  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect  indigenous  people  or \nthe  environment.  It  is  assigned  category  C  for  all  safeguards  categories  (involuntary \nresettlement, impact on indigenous people, and environmental impact). \n \nE. \n \nThe  program  is  exposed  to  broad  national  and  macroeconomic  risks  and  risks \n31. \nassociated  with public financial  management  and corruption.  ADB  is  actively  coordinating  with \nother  development  partners  to  mitigate  these  risks.  A  macroeconomic  and  debt  sustainability \nassessment  has  been  prepared  and  documents  these  risks  as  low. 25  Strong  economic \nperformance  over  the  past  4  years  has  produced one  of the fastest growth rates  in  Southeast \nAsia  with  a  corresponding  decline  in  the  level  of  public  debt  relative  to  GDP.  However,  risks \narising out of the public financial management and procurement systems, as well as corruption, \nare considered high. To mitigate these risks, ADB is providing high-level leadership to facilitate \ninteragency coordination to implement the government\u2019s whole of government approach  to the \nentire public financial management cycle. ADB will support the revision of legislation supporting \nprocurement  to  enable  the  participation  of  a  wider  range  of  bidders,  including  the  direct \nparticipation  of  foreign  firms,  and  is  working  to  strengthen  the  bid  and  evaluation  process.  In \naddition,  ADB  will  participate  in  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  a  comprehensive  and \nresults-based  anticorruption  action  plan,  drawing  on  a  review  of  the  National  Anti-Corruption \nPlan  of  Action.

In \ndoing so, the program will establish a framework through which private funding can be channeled to boost private \ninvestment  in  infrastructure.  To  accomplish  this  objective,  the  program  will  address  fundamental  constraints  to \nbond market development, encourage growth in long-term savings, and diversify the investor base. \n \nImpact:  The  Encouraging  Investment  through  Capital  Market  Reforms  Program  is  aligned  with  the  Philippine \nDevelopment  Plan,  2011\u20132016  and  will  contribute  to  meeting  the  government\u2019s  targeted  investment  rate, \nincluding public and private spending on infrastructure.  \n \nOutcome: The outcome will  be  a deeper  nonbank finance  sector, measured  by  an  increase  in corporate bonds \nrelative to GDP, participation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) cross-border initiatives, and \ngrowth in contractual and long-term retirement savings. \n \n\n\uf0d8  The program will build on ADB\u2019s comprehensive engagement with the Philippine financial sector, which \ndates from 2010, and will seek to increase the supply of long-term investable fundsavailable through the \nprivate sector.  \n\uf0b2  The  program  will  address  development  constraints  in  the  government  bond  market,  which  is  a \nfundamental  building  block  of  financial  market  development,  to  facilitate  the  eventual  issuance  of \ncorporate and project bonds. \n\n\uf0b2  The  program  will  increase  the  size  of  the  domestic  capital  market  by  building  up  the  contractual \nsavings sector, eliminating costs on financial transactions, and easing administrative burdens. At the \nsame time, the program will increase demand for capital market products by encouraging short-term \nsavers to become long-term investors. \n\n\uf0b2  Finally, the program will increase the diversity of participants and business models, and increase the \navailable  pool  of  savings,  by  encouraging  deeper  regulatory  harmonization  within  Association  of \nSouth East Asian Nations (ASEAN) through the ASEAN Capital Market Forum. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nOutputs \n \n\n \nSubprogram 1 Accomplishments \n(Policy triggers in bold) \nJune 2013 to June 2015 \n\nSubprogram 2 \n(Policy triggers In bold) \nJuly 2015 to June 2017 \n\n1.1Money market \ndeveloped through \nimproved cash \nmanagement. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\no Government of \n\nAustralia, Philippines-\nAustralia Public \nFinancial Management \nProgram \n \n\no ADB TA, Strengthening \nTreasury\u2019s Liquidity \nManagement (TA8495) \n \n\nOutput 1: Government Bond Market Depth and Liquidity Enhanced \n\nThe Government of the Philippines \n(government) (through the Bureau of the \nTreasury (BTr)) implemented measures \nto stimulate the development of the short \nterm money market by improving cash \nmanagement and forecasts. \nAccomplishments included: \n \n\n1.
