Given  the  complexity  of\nsector reforms, implementation will follow a phased approach over\na period of time. The SDP supports the first stage of reforms that\nlay the foundation for change and create an enabling environment\nfor  future  private  sector  involvement  through  independent  sector\nregulation;  institutional  and  organizational  actions  for  improved\nsector  governance;  establishment  and  gradual  operationalization\nof  new  sector  companies;  decisions  about  reconfigurating  the\ndistribution  segment,  and  managerial,  financial,  and  operational\nefficiency  improvements  in  ongoing  operations.  These  policy\ninitiatives  will  be  supported  by  targeted  physical  investments  to\nfinancial\nreduce  system \nperformance,  and  increase  the  delivery  capacity  of  the  power\nsector to reap the benefits offered by sector restructuring.\n\nimprove  operational  and \n\nlosses, \n\nfunds  at \n\nThe SDP seeks to assist in improving public and private resource\nallocation  in  MP  by  increasing  the  operational  efficiencies  and\ndelivery capacity, and progressively reducing the demands on the\nstate budget for the power sector that have resulted in suboptimal\nthe  expense  of  other  state\nallocation  of  public \nresponsibilities \nrequires\nsimultaneous  intervention  at  the  policy  level  to  provide  the\nnecessary  legal  and  institutional  framework,  and  at  the  project\nlevel  to  support  critical  investment  components  to  ensure  the\nsuccess of the reforms. Therefore, a mixed-modality SDP seeking\nto  establish  appropriate  policies  as  well  as  supporting  project\ninvestments  is  considered  the  best  instrument  for  supporting\npower sector restructuring initiatives.\n\nlike  education  and  health.  This \n\nClassification\n\nThematic: Economic Growth\nGood Governance\n\n\fiii\n\nThe Sector Development Program\n\nObjectives and Scope The immediate objectives of the policy component (the Program)\nof  the  SDP  are  to  (i) improve  the  policy  environment  and\ngovernance  of  the  sector;  (ii) initiate  the  establishment  of  a\ncommercial  and  competitive  business  environment  to  promote\nefficiency  gains  and  loss  reduction;  (iii) improve  the  financial\nviability  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board  (MPSEB)\nthrough  financial  restructuring;  and  (iv) introduce  a  computerized\ninformation and revenue management system.\n\nPolicy Framework\nand Actions\n\nThe policy framework includes support for several actions.\n\nThe MP Vidyut Sudhar Adhiniyam, 2000 (the Reform Act), brought\ninto force on 3 July 2001, is the most progressive in India to date\nand  includes  provision  for  (i) restructuring  MPSEB,  (ii) mandatory\nmetering  of  all  consumers;  (iii) rationalizing  tariffs  so  that  all\nclasses of consumers will pay at least 75 percent of cost of supply\n(progressively phased over 5 years); (iv) allocating subsidies from\nthe  MP  government  (MPG)  budget  before  subsidizing  any\ncategory  of  consumers;  (v) creating  the  MP  State  Electricity\nRegulatory  Commission  (MPSERC);  and  (vi) referring  dispute\nresolution  between  MPG  and  the  MPSERC  to  the  Central\nElectricity Regulatory Commission rather than to the courts.\n\nThe existing MP Electricity Regulatory Commission was converted\ninto  the  first  MPSERC  following  the  coming  into  force  of  the\nReform Act.\n\nThe generation, transmission, and distribution functions of MPSEB\nwill be corporatized and commercialized.\n\nThe  MPSEB  tariff  structure  will  be  rationalized  and  free  power\nsupply in the state will be restricted.\n\nThe sector will undergo financial restructuring.\n\nA: 33 kilovolt (kV)  and  11kV  system   improvements   in Bhopal,\nGwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, Khargone, Mandsaur, and Ujjain areas;\n\nB:  Conversion \nfeeders  supplying\nagricultural  pumps  in  selected    divisions    in    Mandsaur    and\nUjjain districts to 11kV operation;\n\n  of  selected \n\nlow-voltage \n\nThe Investment Project\n\nThe investment component (the Project) of the SDP comprises six\ncomponents:\n\n\fCost Estimates\n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $318.9  million  equivalent,\ncomprising $200.0 million in foreign exchange and $118.9 million\nequivalent in local currency costs.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\niv\n\nC: Reinforcement  and   augmentation of the   transmission  system\nfacilities in selected priority areas of MP;\n\nD: Setting  up  of   a    computerized   information   and    revenue\nmanagement system;\n\nE: Provision of three-phase meters; and\n\nF: Consulting     services      for    the    initial   phase   of    project\nimplementation.\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n200.0\n\n118.9\n\n($ million)\nPercent\n\n62.7\n\n37.3\n\n200.0\n\n    0.0\n\n     0.0\n\n 118.9\n\nADB\n\nMPSEB/\nMPG\n\nTotal\n\n200.0\n\n118.9\n\n318.9\n\n100.0\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; MPG = Madhya Pradesh government,\nMPSEB = Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board.\n\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  Category  B.  An  initial  environmental\nexamination  was  undertaken  and  the  summary  is  attached  as  a\ncore appendix.\n\nThe  poverty  impact  assessment  for  the  SDP  indicates  that  the\nmandatory  metering  under  the  Reform  Act  is  more  beneficial  for\nlow-income  and  poor  households  than  the  flat  rate  currently\ncharged,  since  the  per-unit  charge  is  higher  on  a  flat  rate  basis.\nUnder the SDP, access to power connections by consumers living\nbelow  the  poverty  line  will  be  facilitated  through  a  scheme  of\namortizing  the  upfront  connection  charges  and  associated  fees\nover  12  months.  Improved  technical  and  nontechnical  efficiency\nwill  benefit  all  categories  of  consumers  by  improving  supply\nquality.\n\nEnvironmental and \nSocial Measures \n\n\fThe Policy Loan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nProgram Period\nand Tranching\n\nv\n\nA  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will\nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan\nwill  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an\ninterest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased  lending  facility,  including  commitment  charges  and  front-\nend  fee.

The  slowing  of  economic  reforms  since  the  mid-1990s\nhighlighted \ninfrastructure\nbottlenecks, widening fiscal deficits, poverty, and illiteracy. In particular, the deteriorating fiscal\nhealth  of  the  central  and  state  governments  is  significantly  undermining  the  long-term  growth\npotential  of  the  economy.  Insufficient  investments  in  physical  infrastructure,  both  public  and\nprivate, prevent the economy from reaping the benefits that are offered by market reforms and\nliberalization.  This  is  particularly  worrisome  as  empirical  evidence  on  India  strongly  suggests\nthat economic growth is the most effective path to sustained poverty reduction.\n\nincluding  severe \n\nthe  economy \n\nincluding \n\ninfrastructure \n\nfacilities,  education,  health,  and \n\nUnder the Indian federal structure the states are responsible for a large number of vital\n3.\nactivities, \nlaw  enforcement.\nConsequently, the fiscal health of the states is crucial for delivering these public services. While\na  large  part  of  the  states\u2019  fiscal  deficit  is  due  to  financial  mismanagement  and  the  priority\nservicing of political interests, the inability of the states to recover the costs of their services is a\nfurther  reason  for  their  poor  fiscal  health.  For  example,  in  the  power  sector,  the  inadequate\naverage tariff base necessitates high budgetary subsidies to power utilities. As one result of the\nfiscal  crunch,  the  electricity  generation  expansion  target  set  for  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan\n(1992/97) fell short by 50 percent due primarily to inadequate investment at the state level. If not\nremedied,  the  unavailability  of  sufficient  power  will  be  the  single  most  important  constraint  to\neconomic  development  in  the  coming  years  and  will  thwart  efforts  to  attract  domestic  and\nforeign investment.\n\nRecognizing  the  importance  of  improving  policymaking  at  the  state  level  to  enhance\n4.\nstructural reforms in India, in 1996 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopted a new strategy\nfor its operations in India directly targeting a portion of its assistance to selected states that have\ndemonstrated  the  political  will  to  (i) undertake  structural  reforms  in  their  macrofinances;\n(ii) improve  their  public  resources  management,  (iii) restructure  public  sector  enterprises;  and\n(iv) undertake sectoral reforms. Gujarat was the first state chosen for this type of holistic support.\nADB approved the first loan in December 1996.2 Based on the willingness and commitment of\nthe  Madhya  Pradesh  government  (MPG)  to  reforms,  the  state  of  Madhya  Pradesh  (MP)  was\nincluded  as  the  second  focal  state.  Kerala  was  included  as  the  third  focal  state  and  policy\ndialogue  has  been  initiated.  The  MPG  and  ADB  agreed  on  a  program  to  enhance  resource\nallocation to social sectors, improve fiscal capabilities, reform the public enterprise sector, and\npromote  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  participation  in  supporting  infrastructure.\nThe  reform  program  was  supported  by  the  approval  of  the  MP  Public  Resource  Management\nProgram loan,3  which  initiated  power  sector  reform  with  ADB  agreeing,  in  principal,  to  provide\n\n                  \n\n1 CER: IND 200019: Country Economic Review , India, December 2000.\n2 Loan  1506-IND:  Gujarat  Public  Sector  Resource  Management  Program,  for  $250  million,  approved  on\n\n3 Loan  1717-IND:  Madhya  Pradesh  Public  Resource  Management  Program,  for  $250  million,  approved  on\n\n18 December 1996.\n\n14 December 1999.\n\n\f2\n\ntargeted  assistance  for  power  sector  development.  The  Power  Sector  Development  Program\n(SDP)  is  included  in  the  2001  country  program  for  India.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  and\nAppraisal  Mission  were  fielded  during  March-April  2001  and  August-September  2001.4  This\nreport is based on the agreements reached during the missions.\n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nA. \n\nMacroeconomic Context\n\n1. \n\nRecent Macroeconomic Performance\n\n5.\nIn terms of area, MP was the largest state in India and fourth in population until it was\nbifurcated into two states, MP and Chhattisgarh, on 1 November 2000, on the basis of the MP\nReorganization  Act,  2000.  Its  rich  deposits  of  coal,  iron  ore,  limestone,  and  forest  resources\nwere the prime sources of industrial growth in the prebifurcated state. The major resource-tied\nindustries  were  steel,  cement,  and  newsprint.  During  the  1980\u2019s,  the  state  had  three  primary\nattractions for many industrial units not based on local resources, such as chemical, electrical\nappliances,  yarns,  and  garments:  abundant  land,  no  labor  problems,  and  uninterrupted  power\nsupply. Thus the state economy has shown robust growth averaging 4.4 percent since 1980/81,\naccelerating  to  5 percent  during  1990/96.  The  contribution  of  the  primary  sector  in  state\ndomestic product declined gradually over time and the contribution of services and industry rose\nconsistently. For example, the share of the primary sector declined from 43.4 percent in 1993/94\nto  39.6  percent  in  1998/99.  Similarly,  the  share  of  manufacturing  and  construction  rose  from\n21.4 percent to 23.0 percent during the same period.\n\nHowever,  the  industrial  growth  situation  has  changed  noticeably  since  1995/96.\n6.\nCountrywide  industrial  recession  and  acute  power  shortages  (almost  14  percent  of  the  peak\ndemand in 1995/96) led to a sharp decline in industrial growth in MP.5 The growth rate of real\nnet  state  domestic  product  of  registered  manufacturing  declined  sharply  from  7.1  percent  in\n1994/95  to  4.4  percent  in  1995/96,  and  1.1  percent  in  1996/97.  Many  industrial  units  were\nforced to shutdown leading to large-scale unemployment. For example, the ferro alloys industry\nmade its debut in the state in 1989. The number of units rose to 22 by 1995. Power shortages\ncoupled  with  steep  hikes  in  the  power  tariff  after  1995  and  strong  market  pressure  due  to  the\nnew  open  import  policy  led  to  the  closure  of  almost  all  of  the  22  units  as  of  1999;6  and  their\npower  consumption  reduced  from  424  million  units  in  1995/96  to  17.34  in  1999/2000.  Total\ninvestment in these plants was about Rs2 billion and 20,000 workers were involved directly or\nindirectly.  Similarly  many  designated  economic  growth  centers  in  MP  failed  to  promote\nindustrialization due to the lack of proper infrastructure, such as roads, water, and street lights\netc. A recent small survey of constraints faced by small-and medium-sized enterprises in MP7\nidentifies lack of infrastructure, in particular shortage of electricity and its quality, followed by the\npoor state of the roads.\n\n                  \n\n4  The  project  team  consisted  of  D.

Fiscal Industrial Incentives of the Government of Madhya\n\n7 TA  3338-IND:  Capacity Building for Public Enterprises Reform and Social Safety Net in Madhya Pradesh,  for\n\nPradesh: Costs and Benefits. New Delhi.\n\n$750,000, approved on 14 December 1999.\n\n\f3\n\nMP is one of the poorest states in India. In 1998/99, the per capita annual income was\n7.\nRs7,350 (in constant prices) as compared with Rs9,739 at the all-India level. The percentage of\nthe  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  was  37.4  in  1999/2000,  much  higher  than  the  all-\nIndia figure of 26.1 percent.\n\n8.\nThe new MP comprises roughly two thirds of the state before bifurcation, in terms of land\narea  and  population,  is  industrially  more  diversified  with  a  higher  proportion  of  light  and\nmanufacturing  industries,  and  will  have  a  higher  per-capita  income  than  the  undivided  state.\nHowever, the new MP has lost most of its natural and mineral resources to Chhattisgarh, and\nwill  need  to  adopt  a  new  strategy  for  stimulating  industrial  growth.  Therefore,  future  plans  for\nindustrialization  in  the  new  MP  should  primarily  focus  on  promoting  industries  that  are  not\nresource-tied.  States  in  India  are  competing  to  attract  these  industries.  As  decided  by  the\ncouncil  of  state  finance  ministers,  all  fiscal  incentives  for  industrialization  were  ended  by\nApril 2001. Thus, future industrialization will critically depend on adequate infrastructure facilities\nincluding power and good roads, as  well as adequate education and health facilities to attract\ngrowth industries and their employees.\n\n2. \n\nMacroeconomic Linkages of Power Sector Reform\n\nDelays in reforms and the MPG policy of free power supply to a large proportion of its\n9.\nagricultural  and  domestic  consumers  (para.  62)  has  brought  the  MP  Electricity  Board  (MPEB)\n(para. 20) into a severe financial crisis. As a result, MPEB is unable to provide adequate power,\nwhich is the most important ingredient of growth in the state. Also, the state exchequer is losing\npotential revenues that could have been mobilized from a financially strong electricity board. For\nexample, in fiscal year (FY) 2001 MPEB\u2019s dues from interest on MPG loans (Rs3.33 billion) and\nfor  electricity  duty  (Rs3.31  billion),  which  MPEB  collects  on  behalf  of  MPG,  is  estimated  to  be\nequivalent to almost 8 percent of the state\u2019s own revenue (both tax and nontax), and 0.8 percent\nof  the  net  state  domestic  product.  However,  as  a  result  of  misdirected  power  policies  and  a\nnoncommercial tariff structure, MPG provides annual budgetary support for MPEB such as the\nrural  electrification  subsidy,  subsidy  for  free  power  supply,  and  fresh  loans.  And  although\nMPEB\u2019s dues are adjusted entirely against budgetary support, MPG\u2019s unpaid subsidy to MPEB\namounted to Rs23.3 billion as of March 2001. In 1996, MPG adjusted Rs7.9 billion by writing off\nits loans to MPEB, and in FY 1998 converted another Rs7 billion of its loans to equity to clear\nthe backlog of subsidy payment from the state budget to MPEB.\n\nAlthough  funds  are  not  fully  fungible,  fiscal  imbalances,  budgetary  allocations,  and  the\n10.\nfinancial deterioration of MPSEB are clearly linked, as state budget support to the power sector\ncrowds  out  public  expenditure  and  investments  in  alternative  sectors  more  productive  for\npoverty  reduction.  The  cash  shortfall  of  MPSEB  under  a  no-reform  scenario  is  estimated  at\nRs16.7  billion  for  FY2002.  In  terms  of  evaluating  the  opportunity  cost  of  MPSEB\u2019s  cash\nrequirements,  the  cash  shortfall  translates  into  32  percent  of  total  social  sector  spending,\nincluding capital investments. In view of the state fiscal imbalances, the Government has been\ncompelled  to  finance  budgetary  support  for  the  power  sector  through  the  banking  sector.  The\ncash  requirement  of  MPSEB  would  amount  to  43  percent  of  the  gross  fiscal  deficit.  Further\ndeterioration  of  MPSEB  would  increase  resource  requirements  from  the  banking  sector  and\naffect the ability of the sector to lend for private sector investments, which are more productive\nfor economic growth. The macroeconomic linkages of the power sector reform are summarized\nin Figure 1.\n\n11.\nMPG support for the power sector is targeted primarily at operational subsidies instead\nof  supporting  investments  in  system  expansion  to  improve  quantity,  quality,  and  reliability  of\n\n\f4\n\nsupply  or  at  least  for  adequate  maintenance  of  existing  assets.  The  electrification  ratio  for\nhouseholds in MP is about 42 percent, with less than 29 percent electrified in rural areas. Efforts\nby the state to increase private sector investment in power generation were undermined by the\nMPEB\u2019s low credit rating. Recognizing its inability to fund the additional investments required in\nthe  power  sector,  MPG  has  decided  to  reorganize  the  power  sector  to  increase  the  self-\nfinancing  capability  with  the  objective  of  increasing  the  ability  to  allocate  budget  resources  to\nsocial sectors.\n\nFigure 1: Macroeconomic Linkages of Power Sector Reform\n\nPower Sector Reform\n\nFiscal relief\nto the state\ngovernment\n\nHigher\nrevenue\ngrowth\n\nBenefits to the\nreal sector\n\nIncreased\ncredit available\nfor private\nsector\n\nHigher\nexpenditure\non social\nsectors\n\nHigher\ncapital\nexpenditure\n\nHigher\nemployment\n\nStable\ndemand for\nmass-\nconsumption\nitems\n\nReduction in\nPoverty\n\nB. \n\nSector Description and Recent Performance\n\n1. \n\nOrganization\n\nIndia consists of 28 states8 and 7 union territories with a total population of over 1 billion.\n12.\nThe organization of the power sector is determined by the country\u2019s federal structure. All major\nissues  affecting  the  power  sector  require  concurrent  action  by  the  central  and  state\ngovernments.\n\n13.\nThe  central  Government\u2019s  Ministry  of  Power  provides  overall  guidance  to  the  sector\nthrough  the  Central  Electricity  Authority  (CEA).  The  Government  owns  central  power  utilities\nsuch  as  the  National  Thermal  Power  Corporation  (NTPC),  National  Hydroelectric  Power\n\n                  \n\n8 Three  new  states,  Chhattisgarh,  Jharkhand,  and  Uttaranchal,  were  created  in  November  2000  through  the\n\nbifurcation of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh states, respectively.\n\n\f5\n\nCorporation  (NHPC),  Nuclear  Power  Corporation  and  the  Powergrid  Corporation  of  India\n(Powergrid),  which  are  engaged  in  generation  and  interstate  power  transmission.  The  Rural\nElectrification  Corporation  and  the  Power  Finance  Corporation  (PFC)  are  Government-owned\nand dedicated to financing power sector activities. The Power Trading Corporation was recently\nestablished to be responsible for power trading for large independent power producers targeted\nto multistate purchases.\n\n14.\nState  governments  control  the  rest  of  the  sector  through  17  state  electricity  boards\n(SEBs)  and  12  electricity  departments,  which  provide  distribution  facilities  and  set  retail  tariffs\nwithin  a  state,  and  share  responsibility  with  the  central  power  sector  agencies  for  power\ngeneration and transmission. The central agencies own and operate 32 percent of the country\u2019s\ntotal  generation,  while  the  SEBs  and  electricity  departments  have  64  percent  of  the  total.  In\naddition,  five  private  utilities  in  urban  agglomerations  have  a  4  percent  share  in  power\ngeneration.\n\n15.\nIn  1998,  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC)  Act  was  passed  by  the  Indian\nParliament  and  in  the  same  year  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (CERC)  was\nestablished.  The  ERC  Act  gives  CERC  full  autonomy  to  regulate  central  power  utilities  and  to\nset bulk tariffs. The ERC Act also encourages the states to establish state electricity regulatory\ncommissions with full authority for state-level power utilities.\n\n2. \n\nState Electricity Boards\n\n16.\nThe  Indian  Electricity  Act  of  1910  and  the  Electricity  (Supply)  Act  of  1948  provide  the\nlegal basis for the establishment and operation of SEBs. SEBs are typically vertically integrated\nentities  owned  by  their  respective  state  governments.  While  they  are  nominally  independent\nfrom the state governments, their commercial and financial operations are subject to substantial\nintervention  by  these  governments,  in  particular  for  tariff  setting,  metering  policies,  and\nelectrification targets. Most SEBs are ordered to provide free or highly subsidized power to the\nagriculture sector and to a substantial portion of domestic consumers. Continuous politicization\nof  the  sector  combined  with  a  lack  of  commercial  culture  and  accountability  have  resulted  in\nnegative  internal  cash  generation  by  SEBs,  impeded  expansion  of  the  power  system,  and\nrestrained adequate maintenance and rehabilitation of existing assets. As a result, the demand-\nsupply gap has widened, and the quality of power supply has deteriorated in almost all parts of\nthe country.\n\nRecognizing the need to separate social obligations from commercial imperatives, some\n17.\nstates  initiated  power  sector  reforms  in  the  mid-1990s  and  passed  their  own  power  sector\nreform bills to provide a legal basis for SEB reorganization. The states that have reorganized, or\nare  in  the  process  of  reorganizing,  their  power  sectors  are  Orissa  (1996),  Haryana  (1998),\nAndhra Pradesh (1999), Karnataka (1999), MP (2000), Rajasthan (2000), Uttar Pradesh (2000),\nDelhi  (2001),  and  Gujarat  (2001).  The  major  objective  of  the  state  power  sector  reform  is  to\nincrease the sector\u2019s self-generation of funds and to reduce its reliance on budget transfers from\nthe state\u2019s budget. Although each state has adopted a unique model of power reform, all models\nreflect  in  one  way  or  the  other  the  desire  to  distance  the  government  from  power  sector\noperations.\n\n3. \n\nCentral Power Utilities\n\n18.\nUntil  1972,  the  SEBs  were  almost  solely  responsible  for  developing  power  generation\nand transmission within their states, but were unable to meet the rapidly increasing demand for\nelectricity.  To  improve  the  efficiency  of  generation,  three  central  sector  agencies  \u2014  NTPC,\n\n\f6\n\nNHPC, and Nuclear Power Corporation \u2014 were established in 1975 to generate bulk power for\nsale to SEBs. In 1989, Powergrid was established as a transmission and dispatch company by\namalgamating  the  transmission  and  dispatch  assets  of  all  central  power  sector  agencies.  In\naddition to these wholly owned companies, the Government also has shares in special-purpose\ngenerating companies.\n\n19.\nThe central agencies, including NTPC, NHPC, and Powergrid, are seriously affected by\nthe  poor  financial  health  of  most  SEBs,  as  was  evidenced  several  times  in  the  past  when\nexcessive  accounts  receivable  from  SEBs  seriously  impaired  the  central  agencies\u2019  financial\nliquidity.  To  resolve  this  problem,  NTPC  has,  in  addition  to  restricting  supply  and  obtaining\nGovernment appropriation to settle SEB debts, even resorted to taking over the SEB generation\nfacilities  in  settlement  of  accounts  receivable.9  ADB\u2019s  two  loans  to  Powergrid,10  restrict\ninvestments  to  SEBs  that  have  a  satisfactory  payment  record  with  Powergrid  and  make\nprovisions for Powergrid to suspend power supply to delinquent SEBs.\n\n4. \n\nMadhya Pradesh Power Sector\n\nThe  MP  power  sector  was  operated  by  a  vertically  integrated  monopoly,  MPEB.\n20.\nFollowing the bifurcation of the state into MP and Chhattisgarh, in pursuance of subsection (4)\nof  section  58  of  the  MP  Reorganization  Act,  2000,  MPEB  was  succeeded  by  the  MP  State\nElectricity Board (MPSEB) and the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB), both vertically\nintegrated  monopolies.  As  of  1  November  2000,  the  total  installed  capacity  in  the  undivided\nstate  of  MP  was  4,261  megawatt  (MW).  The  division  of  generating  capacity  following  the\nbifurcation is given in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Generation Plant Details (1999-2000)\n\nState\n\nType\n\nA.

Similarly, transmission assets, distribution regions,\nand project/asset-specific liabilities, including employees, would be split along geographic state\nborders.  However,  non-project/asset-specific \nliabilities  (including  employees)  would  be\napportioned on the basis of population leaving MPSEB to assume approximately 79 percent of\ntotal  long-term  debt  of  MPEB.  Both  states  have  requested  the  Government  to  reconsider  its\n\n                  \n\n9  As part of the agreement to change the executing agency for Loan 907-IND: Unchahar Thermal Power Project, for\n$160.0 million approved on 29 September 1988 to NTPC, ADB, the Government, the Uttar Pradesh government,\nand  NTPC  agreed  to  transfer  title  to  the  420-MW  Stage-I  to  NTPC.  NTPC  has  since  taken  over  the  Talcher\nThermal Power Station from Orissa SEB, and the Tanda Thermal Power Station from Uttar Pradesh SEB in lieu of\ndues owned by these states.\n\n10 Loan  1405-IND:  Power Transmission (Sector) Project,  for  $275  million,  approved  on  16  November  1995  and\nLoan 1764-IND: Power Transmission Improvement (Sector) Project, for $250 million, approved on 6 October 2000.\n\n\f7\n\norder. Nonetheless, MPSEB was already granted the right of first refusal for purchasing surplus\npower  from  CSEB\u2019s  own  production.  The  key  indicators  for  the  new  MP\u2019s  power  sector  are\ngiven in Supplementary Appendix A.\n\n22.\nFrom  1993  to  2000,  power  demand  grew  by  a  compounded  7.3  percent  annually.\nHowever,  annual  growth  rates  fluctuated  strongly  due  to  the  severe  power  shortages\nexperienced  from  1996  to  1998.  Growth  was  also  uneven  between  the  different  customer\ncategories  over  the  same  period  with  high  tension  (HT)  industrial  consumers  showing  zero\ngrowth compared with a compounded 16 percent growth rate for agricultural consumers.\n\n23.\nThe  size  of  load  served,  as  well  as  the  load  mix,  in  the  two  new  states  differs\nsignificantly  from  that  of  the  undivided  MP  state  (Table  2).  As  a  result,  the  new  MPSEB  is\nexpected  to  be  in  a  financially  weaker  position  than  erstwhile  MPEB  because  (i) many  high-\nprofile  industrial  consumers  reside  in  Chhattisgarh,  (ii) 94  percent  of  agricultural  consumers\nremain in the new MP, and (iii) allocation of 32 percent of generation capacity to Chhattisgarh\nwill leave the new MP with a more serious power shortage.\n\nState\nMadhya Pradesh\n(MPSEB)\nChhattisgarh\n\nTotal (MPEB)\n\nTable 2: Load Mix for MPSEB and MPEB in 1999-2000\nLT Agriculture\nUnit\n8,994.6\nMU\n49%\n624.3\n12%\n9,618.9\n41%\n\nDomestic\n2,622.2\n14%\n929.8\n17%\n3,552.0\n15%\n\n2,984.2\n16%\n2,916.8\n54%\n5,901.0\n25%\n\nMU\n%\nMU\n%\n\nHT Industry\n\nAll Other\n3,721.6\n21%\n942.3\n17%\n4,663.9\n19%\n\nTotal\n18,322.6\n100%\n  5,413.2\n100%\n23,735.8\n100%\n\nHT  = high tension, LT = low tension, MPEB  = Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board, MU = million units.\nSource: MPSEB.\n\nC. \n\nConstraints and Issues\n\nLoad  Restrictions.  Power  demand  grew  by  6.4  percent  in  1999/2000  and  the  peak\n24.\ndemand-supply  gap  in  the  same  year  is  estimated  at  about  1,500  MW.  This  unserved,  or\nsuppressed demand, results from planned (load relief) and unplanned (load shedding) cuts. In\nresponse to the shortage, MPEB resorted to load restrictions for HT, low tension (LT), and rural\nconsumers. Energy shortfall reached 1,060 gigawatt-hours in 1998/99 and is estimated to have\nincreased to 1,552 gigawatt-hours for the year 1999/2000. Quality of supply has also suffered\nas a result of overloaded transmission and distribution facilities; the system has been operating\nat lower than normal frequency and voltage approximately 55 percent of the time. Transmission,\ndistribution, and generation limitations are thus preventing the system from meeting demand.\n\n25.\nIndependent  Power  Producer  Policy.  In  response  to  the  growing  supply  gap,  MPG\ninitiated a policy to invite private power producers and entered into power purchase agreements\nwith a total of 17 sponsors. However, none of the independent power producers has achieved\nfinancial  closure  yet  due  to  MPEB\u2019s  insufficient  escrow  capacity11.  In  December  1999,  the\nescrow capacity was reviewed and revised to 900 MW, which is only 35 percent of the capacity\nestimated 18 months earlier, pointing to the sector\u2019s severe financial problems.\n\n                  \n\n11 The  term  escrow  used  here  refers  to  the  deposition  of  the  revenue  stream  from  a  specific  revenue  collection\ncenter, e.g., a distribution unit, into a separate account in an identified bank, an escrow agent. In the power sector\nthis  mechanism  is  mostly  used  to  guarantee  payment  of  an  independent  power  producer,  to  whom  the  primary\nclaim on a revenue stream from a distribution zone is transferred or escrowed.\n\n\f8\n\n26.\nTariff  Structure  and  Subsidies.  The  financial  problems  of  MPEB  and  its  successor\nMPSEB are in large part due to an MPG policy (para. 62) to provide free power to single-point\nconnections12  in  urban  and  rural  areas  and  for  agricultural  pump  connections  up  to\n5 horsepower.  Moreover,  MPG  instructed  MPEB  to  supply  almost  free  electricity  to  rural\nelectricity  cooperative  committees  (Rs0.07  per  kWh)  and  to  pursue  a  vigorous  rural\nelectrification program. This resulted in lopsided growth rates in the domestic and primarily the\nagriculture  sectors  at  the  expense  of  the  industrial  and  commercial  consumer  categories.\nIndustrial consumption was 82.7 percent of total energy consumption in 1970/71, but dropped to\nonly  20  percent  of  consumption  in  1999/2000.  During  the  same  period,  the  percentage  of\nagricultural consumption went up from 3.4 percent to 41 percent.\n\n27. With its high energy consumption, the agriculture sector contributed barely 6 percent of\ntotal  MPEB  revenue  in  1999/2000,  while  the  industry  sector\u2019s  contribution  was  43  percent\ncompared  with  20  percent  of  consumption.  In  terms  of  average  realization  per  kilowatt-hour\n(kWh),  the  agriculture  sector  accounted  for  Rs0.27  and  the  domestic  sector  for  Rs0.93  as\ncompared with an average cost of supply of Rs3.03 per kWh (Table 3).\n\nItem\n\nDomestica\n\nIrrigation/\nAgriculture\n\nHT Industriesb\n\nTable 3: Average Realization from Energy Sold\n\n%Total\nConsumption\n15\n\nFY1996\nAverage Tariff\nRs/kWh\n0.65\n\n%Total\nRevenue\n7\n\n%Total\nConsumption\n15\n\nFY2000\n\nAverage Tariff\nRs/kWh\n0.93\n\n%Total\nRevenue\n8\n\n35\n\n33\n\n0.18\n\n2.66\n\n4\n\n62\n\n41\n\n20\n\n0.27\n\n3.82\n\n3.03\n\n6\n\n43\n\nAve.Overall\nSupply Cost\nHT= high tension, kWh= kilowatt-hour, Rs= Indian Rupee.\naIncludes single point consumers.\nbIncludes steel plants.\nSource: MPSEB.\n\n1.74\n\nThis  situation  has  resulted  in  (i) MPSEB  not  having  resources  to  finance  its  system\n28.\nexpansion  to  meet  unserved  demand;  (ii) industrial  consumers  paying  high  tariffs  that  impair\ntheir  competitiveness  and  consequently  establishing  their  own  generation  facilities,  eroding\nMPSEB\u2019s  consumer  mix;  and  (iii) MPSEB  being  unable,  without  subsidies  from  the  state\ngovernment, to earn a return on its investments as prescribed by law.\n\n29.\nCaptive Power. In direct response to the deficient quantity and quality of power supply\ncoupled  with  high  tariffs,  major  industrial  consumers  have  set  up  their  own  captive  power\ngeneration  plants.  From  1995/96  to  1999/2000,  growth  of  captive  generation  averaged  8.7\npercent  per  year,  with  the  last  two  years  being  above  9.3  percent  for  a  total  of  1,390  MW  of\ninstalled  captive  capacity  for  MPEB.  Of  this,  671  MW  or  48  percent  is  located  in  the  territory\nsupplied by the new MPSEB. This represents considerable loss of revenues for MPSEB.\n\n30.\nSystem Losses. From 1994/95 to 1998/99, transmission and distribution (T&D) losses\nhave varied within a range of 19.6 percent to 20.9 percent. Precise loss estimation is hampered\nby  the  fact  that  currently  only  about  38  percent  of  energy  input  into  the  distribution  system  is\nmeasured due to the policy of free supply for designated agricultural and domestic consumers,\n\n                  \n\n12 These are unmetered connections intended for operation of a single power outlet point only.\n\n\f9\n\nand  the  charging  of  a  flat  rate  for  several  other  consumer  groups.  In  addition,  a  significant\nnumber  of  meters  are  defective  and  consumption  of  those  customers  also  needs  to  be\nestimated.\n\n31.\nLosses  consist  of  two  major  types:  technical  and  commercial.  Estimation  of  technical\nlosses  can  be  made  rather  precisely  through  load-flow  analysis.  Commercial  losses  are\ngenerally  a  function  of  the  operation  of  the  system;  and  can  include  theft,  metering  problems,\nand billing and collection inefficiencies. Given the current absence of energy audit and full end-\nuser  metering  of  agricultural  customers,  reestimation  of  consumption  by  MPSEB  consultants\nbased  on  connected  load,  supply  restrictions,  etc.,  provides  strong  evidence  that  agricultural\nconsumption is gravely overstated and that losses are understated. This revised estimate shows\nlosses  of  around  47  percent,  of  which  22  percent  are  considered  technical  and  25  percent\ncommercial. Reduction in technical losses generally requires significant investment; because of\nthe financial constraint of MPSEB, the improvement in technical losses is expected to be slow.\nOn  the  other  hand,  major  improvement  in  nontechnical  losses  can  be  quickly  achieved  with\nconcerted management effort at much lower levels of investment.\n\nD. \n\nState Government Objectives and Strategy\n\n1. \n\nThe Policy Framework\n\nAs  a  result  of  efforts  made  by  the  National  Development  Council13  the  high-level\n32.\nCommittee  on  Power  was  constituted  in  June  1993.  In  its  report  submitted  in  October  1994,\nthe committee  recommended  (i) organizational  reforms  at \nlevel,  consisting  of\ncommercialization  and  vertical  and  horizontal  unbundling;  (ii) large-scale  involvement  of  the\nprivate sector in generation and distribution; (iii)  depoliticizing electricity-tariff setting by creating\nnational  and  regional  tariff  boards;  and  (iv) progressive  phasing  out  of  subsidies  to  agricultural\nconsumers. These recommendations were renewed in the council meeting with Power ministers\nin October and December 1996, and are outlined in the Common Minimum National Action Plan\nfor Power.\n\nthe  state \n\n33.\nIn  response  to  the  National  Development  Council\u2019s  recommendation,  MPG  appointed  a\nhigh-level  committee  in  1996  to  review  the  existing  power  sector  situation  and  to  suggest\nmeasures for its restructuring in the context of economic liberalization and introduction of private\ncapital into the sector. Named after its chairman, the Tata Rao Committee issued Guidelines on\nRestructuring  and  Privatization  of  Power  Sector  and  Power  Tariff  in  January  1997.  The  major\nrecommendations  of  the  report  were  to  (i) divide  MPEB  along  functional  lines,  (ii) maintain\nMPEB  as  a  holding  company,  (iii) establish  a  regulatory  authority,  (iv) allow  private  sector\ninvestment in all functional areas, and (v) improve the financial and operational efficiency of the\ndistribution  segment  before  inviting  private  sector  investment.  The  report  recommended\nfundamental changes in the free supply of power to certain consumer segments, and that any\nsubsidies  must  be  transparent  and  reimbursed  to  the  utility  on  a  timely  basis.  The  Tata  Rao\nCommittee  advised  against  separating  and  privatizing  urban  area  distribution  from  semiurban\nand rural distribution, as this would leave the remaining public sector distribution segment highly\nnonviable. It also recommended maintaining uniform tariffs for each category of consumers, as\nlong as the areas continue to be MPEB subsidiaries.\n\n                  \n\n13 India's highest political body, the council is chaired by the Prime Minister and comprises the chief ministers of all the\n\nstates in India.\n\n\fE. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n10\n\n34.\nThe power sector has received a major portion of India's external assistance. Of ADB\u2019s\ntotal  Government-guaranteed  lending  to  India  amounting  to  $9.898  billion  as  of  31  October\n2001, 9 loans for $1.865 billion (18.8 percent) were approved for the power sector. The first four\nprojects  were  for  power  generation;  three  were  sector  loans  to  support  improvements  in  SEB\nefficiency and development of the national transmission grid; and the two most recent were for\nsector development to support the restructuring of a state\u2019s power sector. In addition, under its\nprivate sector operations, ADB has approved three loans and investments totaling $79.8 million\nfor one captive transmission and two generation projects.14 Power subprojects have also been\nconsidered for financing under ADB's private sector infrastructure facility15 and the Infrastructure\nDevelopment  Finance  Company.16  ADB  also  has  approved  $12.9  million  for  21  technical\nassistance (TA), mainly advisory, at both the national and state levels. The TAs have focused\non  environmental  and  pollution  control  issues  related  to  power  generation,  bulk  transmission\ntariffs, improved least-cost system planning, tariff studies at the retail level, improved technical\nand  commercial  operations,  power  sector  restructuring,  and  establishment  of  an  independent\nregulatory authority. Previous ADB assistance to India\u2019s power sector is listed in Supplementary\nAppendix B.\n\n35.\nThe major funding source to the sector is the World Bank Group. The World Bank has\nsupported  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  projects,  including  assistance\ndirected to SEBs. The World Bank is supporting power sector reforms in the states of Andhra\nPradesh,  Haryana,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  In  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Uttar\nPradesh,  power  sector  reform  is  viewed  as  part  of  overall  reform  of  the  state  finances.  ADB\ncoordinates with the World Bank on the geographical demarcation of state-level operations, as\nwell  as  to  ensure  overall  complementarity  of  actions  at  both  the  central  and  state  levels.  ADB\nand  the  World  Bank  have  concurrent  ongoing  operations  for  different  projects  with  three\norganizations:  PFC,  Powergrid,  and  NTPC.  Other  major  agencies  funding  the  sector  are  the\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau for the Government of\nGermany, Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID), Canadian\nInternational  Development  Agency  (CIDA),  and  United  States  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment. Although the combined assistance of all aid agencies constitutes only about 8-10\npercent of the total investments in the sector, several key policy initiatives have been catalyzed\nas a result. Major external assistance provided to the power sector by other aid agencies is also\nlisted in Supplementary Appendix B.\n\nThe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  is  supporting  the  expansion  of  public\n36.\nsector  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  including  rural  electrification.  It  has  no\ngeographic preferences.\n\nDFID\u2019s  exclusive  objective  in  providing  assistance  is  poverty  reduction.  It  is  financing\n37.\nstudies  for  power  sector  restructuring  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Haryana,  and  Orissa;  and  has  no\nplans to participate in the financing of hardware other than in renewable energy systems. It is\n\n                  \n\n14 Loan 7058/1036-IND: CESC Limited, for $17.8 million, approved on 4 October 1990; Loan 7082/1142-IND: CESC\nLimited II, for $32.0 million, approved on 13 December 1991; and Loan 7130/1499-IND: Balagarh Power Company\nLimited, for $15 million in equity and a loan for $25 million, approved on 5 December 1996.\n\n15 Loans  1480/1481/1482-IND:  Private  Sector  Infrastructure  Facility,  for  a  total  of  $300  million,  approved  on\n\n7 November 1996.\n\n16 Investment 7138-IND: Infrastructure Development Finance Company, for $30 million equity investment, approved\non 14 October 1997. The loan amount was subsequently reduced to $15.463 million due to greater than expected\nsubscription from the investors.\n\n\f11\n\nconsidering  (i) cooperating  with  ADB  to  fund  studies  on  power  sector  restructuring  in  MP  and\nWest  Bengal  states;  and  (ii) assisting  these  states  in  other  areas  also,  preferably  in  the  \"soft\"\nsectors, like health and education.\n\n38.\nThe United States Agency for International Development has extensively supported and\ncontinues to support policy aspects of private sector participation. It has supported studies for\nstate sector reforms through PFC, and by providing grant assistance for energy management,\nconservation, and training.\n\nCIDA assisted Kerala in conducting extensive studies for restructuring its power sector.\n39.\nADB is following up on CIDA\u2019s work through policy dialogue and preparation for a possible loan\nintervention.  Together  with  the  World  Bank,  CIDA  is  providing  similar  TA  for  power  sector\nreforms  in  Andhra  Pradesh.  In  Madhya  Pradesh,  CIDA  and  ADB  are  cooperating  and\ncoordinating closely in providing assistance to MPSEB and MPG for power sector reform. CIDA\nprovides the most bilateral assistance and is providing an umbrella TA to MPSEB through the\nEnergy  Infrastructure  Services  Project  (EISP).  The  EISP\u2019s  components  include  (i) rationalizing\nthe  tariff  structure;  (ii) developing  a  power  system  master  plan;  (iii) supporting  distribution\nreconfiguration  and  preparation  of  a  grid  code;  (iv) restructuring  MPSEB  debt  and  preparing\nopening  balance  sheets  for  the  new  sector  entities;  (v) supporting  capacity  building  for  cross-\ncutting themes in environment, gender equality, socioeconomic analysis, and governance; and\n(vi) developing  a  poverty  reduction  strategy  as  it  relates  to  energy  availability  for  the  poor\n(para. 50).\n\nF. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n1. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n40.\nADB  operations  in  India\u2019s  power  sector  have  generally  been  successful  from  a  project\npoint  of  view,  i.e.,  the  projects  concerned  have  achieved  their  physical  objectives.  However,\nexcept for the ongoing loans to Powergrid and Gujarat (footnote 10),17 these projects were not\ndesigned to change the business environment, and sector performance continues to deteriorate.\nThis was primarily on account of (i) political interference in tariff setting; (ii) rapid growth of the\ndemand for electricity, making conventional investment strategies unworkable; (iii) government\nrules and regulations and control of the SEBs that inhibited speedy decision making; and (iv) the\nnoncommercial setup of the sector, which did not generate the market for alternative players to\nstep in to bridge the gap between supply and demand.\n\n41.\nAlthough  the  past  strategy  enabled  ADB  to  support  many  projects,  it  spread  ADB's\nresources  too  thinly,  with  the  result  that  it  could  not  achieve  its  desired  goal  of  policy  reforms\nwith its power sector borrowers. In most states, the power sector has been the largest recipient\nof state resources, in terms of subsidies as well as in terms of capital investments. Thus, macro\nmanagement  of  the  state's  finances  needs  to  be  improved  if  the  power  sector  is  to  be\nsuccessfully turned around. Therefore, ADB is now assisting selected states with power sector\nreforms, only in the context of a holistic change in their macroeconomic management.\n\n2. \n\nOperational Strategy\n\n42.\nADB\u2019s  current  operational  strategy  in  India  is  to  support  efforts  to  achieve  higher\nsustainable  economic  growth  to  promote  employment  and  reduce  poverty.  Its  contribution  to\n\n                  \n\n17 Loans 1803/1804-IND: Gujarat Power Sector Development Program, for $350 million, approved on 13 December\n\n2000.\n\n\f12\n\nhigher  growth  focuses  on  improving  the  supply-side  efficiency  of  the  economy,  especially  by\nreducing  bottlenecks  in  key  infrastructure  sectors.  Emphasis  is  on  improving  the  policy,\ninstitutional, and regulatory framework to enhance the efficiency of public sector operations and\nto  encourage  private  investment.  Improving  resource  mobilization  to  finance  the  necessary\ninvestments is a key component of ADB\u2019s assistance, and includes support for the development\nof  financial  and  capital  markets,  as  well  as  for  improving  internal  resource  mobilization  in  the\nsector  agencies  and  enhancing  their  creditworthiness.  High  priority  is  also  given  to  assisting\nprojects that contribute to environmental improvement.\n\nADB's  strategy  for  India  was  revised  in  1996  to  accommodate  an  urgent  need  for  a\n43.\nportion  of  its  assistance  to  be  provided  in  a  systematic  and  comprehensive  way  at  the\nsubnational or state level. This need reflects the facts that (i) a geographic focus, together with\nthe ongoing selective sector focus, enables ADB to maximize its developmental impact both in\nthe states concerned and, through the demonstrational impact of its operations on other states\nas  well;  (ii) state-level  economic  reforms,  which  have  been  lagging  behind  initiatives  taken\nby the Government,  need  support  and  incentives;  and  (iii) the  states  have  considerable\nautonomy  and  have  major  legislative,  administrative,  and  fiscal  responsibilities  in  many\neconomic and social sectors. Key elements of the subnational assistance include (i) improving\nthe  states'  public  resources  management,  (ii) reforming  and  restructuring  public  sector\nenterprises  to  improve  operating  efficiencies,  and  (iii) supporting  reforms  in  key  infrastructure\nsectors with a view to increasing private investment (para. 4).\n\n44.\nReflecting  ADB\u2019s  overall  country  strategy  for  India  and  in  recognition  of  the  dualistic\nstructure of India's power sector, ADB's strategy for the power sector, which has been pursued\nin  coordination  with  the  World  Bank,  intends  to  operate  at  two  levels.  At  the  central  level,\nassistance  is  provided  to  central  power  sector  companies  such  as  Powergrid  (para.  18,\nfootnote 10)  and  PFC18  with  a  view  to  supporting  their  commercialization  and  using  them  as\nagents  to  leverage  reform  in  their  client  SEBs.  Through  its  support  to  PFC,  ADB  seeks  to\npromote  power  sector  reforms  in  states  that  would  currently  not  qualify  for  direct  lending\noperations.  At  the  state  level,  by  considering  assistance  only  for  states  that  demonstrate  the\npolitical will to substantially restructure and commercialize their power sectors, and by assisting\nthem  to  actualize  the  reforms,  ADB  is  building  up  the  reform  process  from  the  grassroots.\nImprovements in the power sector will increase the fiscal space of the state governments and\nincrease  their  ability  to  allocate  more  resources  for  poverty  reduction  and  socioeconomic\ndevelopment.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nThe power sector has become one of the major budget items for MPG due to politicized\n45.\nsector  management.  Despite  receiving  high  annual  subsidies,  the  sector  has  not  been  in  a\nposition to meet the growing demand for power, and quality and reliability of power supply have\ndeteriorated. Political interference in tariff setting and sector operations had adverse impacts on\nthe operational and financial performance of the MPSEB, which finds itself in a severe financial\ncrisis. The lack of sufficient and reliable power is eroding MP\u2019s competitiveness, and prevents it\nfrom attracting the same level of industrial investments as some of its neighboring states. At the\nsame time, the demands on the state budget for the power sector have resulted in suboptimal\nallocation of public funds at the expense of other state responsibilities like education and health,\n\n                  \n\n18 Loan 1161-IND: Power Efficiency (Sector) Project, for $250 million, approved on 26 March 1992. The loan account\n\nwas closed on 18 December 1998.\n\n\f13\n\nfurther  undermining  the  state\u2019s  attractiveness  as  a  location  for  new  industrial  developments,\nespecially  information  technology  and  biotechnology,  which  are  India\u2019s  future  growth  sectors.\nRestoring  the  sector\u2019s  financial  viability  and  sustainability  is  a  declared  objective  of  MPG  and\nthe SDP provides the basis for MPG to reform and restructure the power sector.\n\nMPG  adopted  the  recommendations  of  the  Tata  Rao  Report  as  the  base  model  for\n46.\nsector reform, namely, (i) functional unbundling of MPSEB, (ii) retention of MPSEB as a holding\ncompany,  (iii) establishment  of  a  regulatory  authority,  and  (iv) improvement  of  operational  and\nfinancial  efficiency  of  the  distribution  segment  before  inviting  private  sector  investment.\nHowever,  MPG  found  that  given  the  complexity  of  the  sector  reforms  to  be  undertaken,\nimplementation should be phased. Stage I of the reforms will lay  the foundation for change and\ncreate  the  conducive  environment  for  future  private  sector  involvement  in  the  power  sector19\n(Appendix 1 provides a vision for the long-term sector model). In close dialogue with ADB, MPG\ndeveloped  a  detailed  plan  for  stage  I  of  the  reform  process  that  aims  at  creating  an  enabling\nenvironment  and  independent  sector  regulation;  establishing  new  sector  companies  and  their\ngradual  operationalization;  deciding  on  reconfiguring  the  distribution  segment;  and  improving\nmanagerial,  financial,  and  operational  efficiency  of  its  ongoing  operations.  Those  policy\ninitiatives  would  be  supported  by  targeted  physical  investments  to  reduce  system  losses  and\nincrease  the  delivery  capacity  of  the  power  sector  to  reap  the  benefits  offered  by  sector\nrestructuring. On the basis of the policy dialogue associated with the SDP, MPG submitted its\ndevelopment  policy  letter  (Appendix  2),  which  includes  a  policy  matrix  and  memorandum  of\nunderstanding  (MOU)  between  MPB  and  MPSEB.  A  detailed  plan  for  stage  I  of  the  reform\nprocess is provided in Appendix 3.\n\nThe  SDP  is  designed  to  support  MPG\u2019s  long-term  goal  to  ensure  an  efficient,  self-\n47.\nsustaining,  and  competitive  power  sector  to  provide  sufficient  quantity  and  quality  of  power  to\nsupport  the  state\u2019s  economic  and  social  development.  The  SDP  provides  incentives  for\ninstitutional  and  organizational  actions  for  improved  sector  governance  and  the  functional\nunbundling of MPSEB, and in parallel supports physical investments to strengthen the capacity\nof  the  power  system  and  to  reduce  technical  and  nontechnical  losses  to  improve  operational\nand  financial  sector  performance.  The  SDP  seeks  to  improve  public  and  private  resource\nallocation  in  MP  by  increasing  MPSEB\u2019s  operational  efficiencies  and  delivery  capacity,  and\nprogressively reducing the need for transfers from the state government budget. This requires\nsimultaneous  intervention  at  the  policy  level  to  provide  the  necessary  legal  and  institutional\nframework,  and  at  the  project  level,  to  support  critical  investment  components  to  ensure\nsuccess of the reform. Therefore, a mixed-modality sector development program is considered\nthe  best  instrument  for  supporting  an  initiative  to  restructure  the  power  sector.  The  SDP\nconstitutes  the  first  stage  of  the  reform  process,  and  will  be  followed  by  a  second  loan\nintervention upon successful implementation of the first stage of reforms.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n48.\nThe immediate objectives of the SDP are to assist MPG and MPSEB to (i) improve the\npolicy environment and governance of the sector; (ii) initiate the establishment of a commercial\nand  competitive  business  environment  to  promote  efficiency  gains  and  loss  reduction;\n(iii) improve the financial viability of the MPSEB through financial restructuring; (iv) improve the\nquality and quantity of supply by reinforcing, modernizing, and rehabilitating the T&D systems to\n\n                  \n\n19 The India Country Strategy Program for 2003 includes TA for Increasing Private Sector Participation in Electricity\n\nDistribution.\n\n\f14\n\npromote economic growth; (v) introduce a computerized information and revenue management\nsystem; and (vi) pursue installation of meters.\n\n49.\nGiven  the  lack  of  creditworthiness  of  MPSEB  to  attract  private  capital  and  the  parallel\nneed to meet the growing demand for energy, the sector reform and restructuring strategy must\nfocus  on  enhancing  the  cash  flow  at  the  distribution  end.  In  addition  to  rationalizing  the  tariff\nstructure,  the  SDP  will  (i) reduce  T&D  losses,  (ii) pursue  100  percent  metering,  (iii) improve\nbilling and collection efficiency, and (iv) install efficient operational management of power sector\ncompanies.  To  achieve  these  changes,  autonomous  functioning  of  the  power  sector  along\ncommercial lines, especially of the distribution functions, and independent sector regulation and\ncorporatization  of  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  functions  of  MPSEB,  are\nrequired. The SDP is designed to assist MPG and MPSEB in achieving these objectives. The\nSDP frameworks are provided in Appendix 4.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n50.\nDuring its deliberation of the Tata Rao Report, MPG recognized that irrespective of the\nchoice of the long-term sector model, a set of preparatory studies would be needed to optimize\nsector expansion, ensure its commercial viability, attract and optimize private capital investment,\nand  establish  benchmark  performance  for  introducing  competition.  Consequently,  MPG\nrequested  ADB  assistance  for  preparing  and  financing  the  MP  Power  Sector  Development\nProject.20 The TA was designed as a cluster TA to include six studies, two financed by ADB and\nfour  by  CIDA.21  In  addition,  CIDA  recently  expanded  the  EISP  scope  to  include  funding  of\nactivities  related  to  implementing  stage  I  and  preparing  stage  II  of  the  power  sector  reforms\n(para.  39).  ADB  will  coordinate  the  overall  MP  power  sector  reform  program  and  CIDA  is\nworking closely with ADB to implement the studies. The first TA subproject to be implemented\nreviewed  electricity  legislation  and  regulation,  and  included  drafting  of  the  MP  Power  Sector\nReform Bill and support for the selection of a base model for the restructured power sector.\n\n51.\nIn May 2000, an MOU was signed between the Union Ministry of Power and MPG. In the\nMOU  both  parties  affirm  their  joint  commitment  to  the  reform  of  the  power  sector,  and  set  out\ntime-bound reform measures to be implemented by MP and the implementation support to be\nprovided  by  the  Government.  The  MOU  outlines  the  objectives  of  the  reform  program:  to\npromote  the  development  of  an  efficient,  commercially  viable  and  competitive  power  supply\nindustry, which will provide reliable and quality power at competitive prices to all consumers in\nthe  state  and  which  will  support  the  industrial  development  in  the  State.  The  Government\ncommits to support the reforms by allocating additional power from central power stations; and\nproviding  financial  support  for  investment  projects  through  Powergrid  and  PFC,  and  technical\nconsulting assistance.\n\n52.\nADB had extensive policy dialogue with MPG and MPEB about the legislative framework\nand the need to constitute the regulatory authority under a separate state power sector bill and\n\n1. \n\nGovernance\n\n                  \n\n20 TA  2980-IND:  Technical Assistance to India for the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Project,  for\n$1,000,000, approved on 7 January 1998. The six studies include (i) preparation of a power system master plan\n(CIDA);  (ii)  preparation  of  a  framework  for  rationalization  of  tariffs  (CIDA);  (iii)  review  of  electricity  legislation  and\nregulation (ADB); (iv) solicitation for private sector implementation of a generation project (ADB); (v) technical and\nmanagerial upgrading of distribution profit centers (CIDA); and (vi) demandside management (CIDA).\n\n21 Implementation  of  CIDA\u2019s  TA  components  was  delayed  due  to  then  prevailing  external  environment.  CIDA  is\n\ncurrently implementing TA components (i) and (ii).\n\n\f15\n\nnot  under  the  ERC  Act  to  ensure  independence  of  the  regulator.  As  a  result  of  the  policy\ndialogue,  the  MP  Vidyut  Sudhar  Adhiniyam,  2000  (the  Reform  Act)  was  brought  into  force  on\n3 July 2001. The Reform Act is the most progressive in India to date and includes provision for\n(i) restructuring  MPSEB,  (ii) mandatory  metering  of  all  consumers,  (iii) tariff  rationalization  so\nthat  all  classes  of  consumers  will  pay  at  least  75  percent  of  the  cost  of  supply  (progressively\nphased over 5 years), (iv) allocation of MPG budget subsidies before subsidizing any category\nof consumers, (v) creation of the MP State Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPSERC), and\n(vi) dispute  resolution  between  MPG  and  MPSERC  by  reference  to  the  CERC  as  against\nreference to the courts. The Reform Act is primarily an enabling provision for reform and leaves\nsufficient  flexibility  for  the  power  sector  structure  to  evolve  with  future  policy  decisions  and\noperational requirements. Its prescriptive elements, like mandatory metering and minimum tariff\nlevels, are aimed at reducing political interference and ensuring the commercial management of\npower sector operations.\n\n53.\nThe MP Electricity Regulatory Commission was established in June 1999 under the ERC\nAct  and  was  recognized  as  the  first  MPSERC  upon  bringing  the  Reform  Act  into  force.\nMPSERC is gradually increasing its role as a proactive sector stakeholder. It formed an advisory\ncommittee  consisting  of  representatives  of  different  consumer  groups, \nlabor  unions,\nnongovernment  organizations,  academic  and  research  bodies,  and  various  government\ndepartments, and issued a tariff philosophy paper for discussion. Its first tariff award was made\nafter holding extensive public hearings throughout MP involving questions and answer sessions\nwith  MPSEB  officials.  Also,  in  response  to  MPG\u2019s  recent  proposals  for  a  state-wide,  load-\nshedding schedule, MPSERC held several public consultations before issuing an order.\n\nIn  relation  to  the  selection  of  a  model  for  the  postreform  power  sector,  two  large\n54.\nstakeholder  meetings  were  organized  during  1999.  Representatives  from  unions,  the  MP\nFederation  of  Industries,  academia,  MPG  officials,  Madhya  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory\nCommission, and MPEB staff attended the meetings. The workshops contributed significantly to\nan  understanding  of  the  objectives,  strategies,  challenges,  and  benefits  of  power  sector\nrestructuring, and increased the transparency of the reform process.\n\n55.\nBoth the MOU and the Reform Act define MPG\u2019s long-term vision for the sector and set\nthe  legal  framework  for  restructuring.  However,  in  the  short-term,  visible  improvements  in  the\npower sector can only be achieved by combining internal efficiency enhancements of the utility\nand MPG actions to boost MPSEB\u2019s financial viability.\n\nTo  depoliticize  sector  management,  open  and  transparent  recruitment  processes  must\n56.\nbe  used  to  fill  boards  of  directors  and  senior  management  positions  of  the  new  sector\ncompanies. MPG has agreed to recruit experts from outside government services for functional\nareas  including  finance,  commercial,  corporate  planning,  and  information  technology.  In\nrecognition  of  the  importance  of  installing  and  maintaining  commercial  discipline  in  the  sector,\nMPG  has  taken  the  leadership  role  and  issued  an  order  to  appropriate  at  source  outstanding\ndues  of  municipalities  and  other  government  bodies.  MPG  also  committed  to  make  future\nsubsidy payments to MPSEB in cash on a monthly basis.\n\n2. \n\nReform Model and Institutional Arrangements\n\n57.\nDetails  of  the  power  sector  model  for  stage  I  of  reforms  were  decided  upon  by  MPG\nthrough  continuous  policy  dialogue  with  ADB.  As  recommended  by  the  Tata  Rao  Report,  MPG\ndecided to functionally segregate MPSEB into separate generation, transmission, and distribution\ncompanies  incorporated  under  the  Indian  Companies\u2019  Act,  1956,  to  conduct  business  on  a\ncommercial  basis.  MPSEB  will  remain  as  the  holding  company  of  the  newly  incorporated\n\n\f16\n\ncompanies,  and  will  also  act  as  the  single  buyer  and  system  operator  during  the  first  stage  of\npower sector reform. All generation assets of MPSEB will be transferred to the newly incorporated\ngenerating company, and each of the plants will be operated as an independent profit center. All\ntransmission assets will be transferred to the newly established transmission company and it will\nact as the wheeling agent for intrastate transmission activities.\n\n58.\nStage  I  of  the  reforms  also  has  to  contend  with  the  continuous  uncertainty  over\napportionment of liabilities and employees between the two states as a result of bifurcation. The\nfinal  apportionment  will  impact  on  MPG\u2019s  decision  on  transfer  schemes  (proposed  to  be\nprepared  under  ADB  TA)  that  are  a  prerequisite  for  full  operationalization  of  the  new  sector\ncompanies.  Further,  MPG  recognizes  the  importance  of  identifying  and  assessing  any  costs\nresulting from the transfer schemes early to be able to mitigate their impacts.\n\nDetailed  analytical  work  needs  to  be  carried  out  before  the  final  number  of  distribution\n59.\ncompanies  can  be  decided  upon.  Moreover,  the  final  decision  on  the  number  of  distribution\ncompanies  includes  an  element  of  political  decision  making  about  the  extent  of  supportable\ncross-subsidization  within  and  between  the  new  distribution  entities  and  the  treatment  of\npredominantly rural distribution areas. Therefore, MPG decided to retain the existing distribution\nregions  under  MPSEB  as  the  holding  company  until  a  final  decision  has  been  reached  on\ndistribution reconfiguration. ADB also initiated policy dialogue with MPG and MPSEB that some\nof the existing distribution circles should already start operating as independent profit centers to\nprovide  practical  experience  and  best  practices  before  operationalization  of  the  new  distribution\ncompanies  becomes  effective.  The  most  suitable  candidates  for  the  profit  center  approach  are\nthose distribution circles whose facilities are proposed for upgrading and strengthening. MPSEB\nshould give priority to installing of meters for energy audit and for end-consumers in these circles;\nand  fully  delegate  managerial  powers  to  those  circles  as  part  of  the  overall  internal  efficiency\nenhancement measures currently being implemented.\n\n60. While principally open to divestment and private sector involvement in all three functional\nareas, MPG wishes to make its decision based on full and detailed information about the current\noperational  and  financial  situation  and  the  business  prospects  of  the  power  sector  in  the\nmedium term. Learning from experiences made elsewhere, MPG will first establish the legal and\nregulatory  framework  and  an  enabling  business  environment  to  create  certainty  for  investors\nbefore soliciting private sector investments.\n\n61.\nMPG recognizes the benefits of creating a formal coordination mechanism for the reform\nprocess since effective reform management will require that a strategic and program overview\nbe  maintained  at  the  highest  level  throughout  the  reform  process  to  ensure  effective  use  of\nresources  and  to  establish  priorities.  MPG  has  set  up  an  institutional  framework  for  managing\npower  sector  reform  under  the  apex  of  the  Steering  Committee  for  Power  Sector  Reform\nchaired by the chief secretary. The members of the committee include the principal secretaries\nfor power, finance, law, and planning; secretary, finance; and chairman, MPSEB. In addition, the\njoint  secretary  reforms,  Union  Ministry  of  Power,  and  director,  ADB,  Department  of  Economic\nAffairs, have been included to ensure close coordination on power sector reforms. Reporting to\nthe committee is the Strategic Policy Unit (SPU) headed by the principal secretary, power. The\nSPU  is  responsible  for  defining  the  critical  path  for  reform  and  for  preparing  a  time-bound\nimplementation  plan  and  review  mechanisms,  keeping  in  mind  the  institutional,  financial,  and\nregulatory  imperatives.  The  SPU  includes  representatives  from  MPSEB  and  the  Power  and\nFinance  ministries  of  MPG,  and  coordinates  with  ADB  and  other  assistance  agencies  in  the\nsector. Power sector experts from outside the state and representatives of consumer groups are\ninvited  to  provide  feedback  and  input  to  the  SPU  on  an  intermittent  basis.  The  SPU  should\nideally be supported by a professional implementation task force to analyze best practices and\n\n\f17\n\npresent alternative scenarios considering local conditions. With the assistance of ADB, MPG is\ncurrently  identifying  external  funding  for  the  implementation  task  force  and  the  SPU.  DFID  has\nexpressed general interest in supporting both.\n\n3. \n\nRestriction of Free Power Supply\n\n62. With  effect  from  1  January  2001,  a  new  MPG  policy  became  effective  reducing  free\nsupply  of  power  to  agriculture  consumers  and  single-point  consumers.  Under  the  new  policy\nonly  scheduled  castes  and  scheduled  tribes  (SC/ST)  consumers  who  are  living  below  the\npoverty line and with a monthly consumption of not more than 20 kWh will receive free power\nsupply  under  the  single-point  scheme.  SC/ST  agricultural  consumers  are  now  only  eligible  for\nfree electricity supply for pumps up to 5 horsepower if they have less than 1 hectare of irrigated\nland.  As  a  consequence  of  this  policy,  about  95  percent  of  agriculture  consumers  and\n75 percent of single-point consumers are now required to pay their electricity bills fully. MPSEB\nexpects  annual  revenues  from  the  agriculture  sector  to  increase  by  Rs1,610  million,  and  from\nsingle-point  connections  up  to  Rs1,440  million  once  the  new  policy  is  fully  implemented.  The\nprojected increase is equivalent to 19 percent of total revenues from LT consumers in FY2000.\n\n4. \n\nEnergy Audit and Metering\n\n63.\nThe MP Urja Vidheyak, 2001, or the MP Energy Act for the prohibition of unauthorized\nuse  of  electricity;  and  the  assessment,  compounding,  and  recovery  of  arrears  and  dues  to\nreduce losses caused by illegal abstraction, use, consumption, and pilferage of electricity was\nenacted  on  17  April  2001.  A  comprehensive  energy  audit  comprising  the  installation  of  7,500\nmeters is being implemented on all feeders up to the 11 kilovolt (kV) level; electronic meters will\nbe  provided  to  all  HT  consumers.  This  will  allow  MPSEB  to  record  and  compare  the  energy\ninput into a specific distribution feeder with the realized revenues coming from the same feeder.\nGrouping and accounting of consumers according to distribution feeder will be implemented as\npart of the energy audit. In addition to allowing specific targeting of high loss zones for efficiency\nimprovements, the energy audit is a fundamental ingredient for distribution reconfiguration and\ncorporatization/divestment to be carried out as part of sector reform.\n\n64. While  preparing  for  supplying  and  installing  meters  to  all  endusers,  MPSEB  has\nlaunched a campaign to regularize unmetered connections using self-assessment of electricity\nconsumption.  Under  the  scheme,  administrative  requirements  for  official  connections  are\nrelaxed,  and  consumers  are  encouraged  to  self-assess  their  monthly  electricity  consumption\nand  make  payments  based  on  this  assessment.  Once  meters  have  been  installed  the\nconnections  will  be  billed  based  on  the  meter  reading.  The  self-assessment  campaign  fulfills\nthree  objectives:  (i) immediately  increase  MPSEB\u2019s  revenues,  (ii) lower  resistance  to  meter\ninstallation,  and  (iii) assist  in  detecting  tampering  of  meters  if  metered  consumption  is\nsubstantially  lower  than  that  self-assessed.  It  also  benefits  poorer  consumers  who  until  now\ncould  not  obtain  legal  connections  due  to  lack  of  titles  to  their  land/housing.  Under  the  new\npolicy,  proof  of  property  titles  is  no  longer  a  requirement  for  obtaining  a  connection  from\nMPSEB.  After  an  interim  period,  all  nonregistered  connections  will  be  levied  with  heavy  fines\nand ultimately disconnected.\n\n5. \n\nInternal Reforms\n\nThe  self-assessment  scheme  is  part  of  the  comprehensive  measures  implemented  by\n65.\nMPSEB to increase the internal operational efficiencies. Simplifying procedural hurdles to obtain\nofficial  connections  will  reduce  nonmonetary  access  barriers \nthe  network,  while\nsimultaneously reducing illegal connections and thus system losses.\n\nto \n\n\f18\n\nIntroduction  of  grievance  procedures  to  better  respond  to  customer  needs  and  to\n66.\nincrease public participation is another step toward a commercial and competitive power sector.\nMPSEB has formed grievance redress committees at district and subdivision levels headed by\nrepresentatives  of  MPSEB  and  the  local  community.  In  anticipation  of  the  new  business\nenvironment,  MPSEB  has  implemented  measures  to  decentralize  powers  and  to  increase\nMPSEB  officers\u2019  responsibility  for  incidents  of  theft  in  their  jurisdiction.  As  part  of  the  internal\nrestructuring, MPSEB banned all new recruitment and revised the retirement age from 60 to 58\nyears starting in January 2001, which immediately reduced the number of employees by about\n1,200 (of a total of 67,000).\n\nMPSEB \n\nrecently  delegated  more  operational \n\n67.\nresponsibilities.  Administrative,\ncommercial,  and  financial  responsibilities  created  on  a  graduated  scale  by  MPSEB  were\ndelegated  to  individual  generating  plants  and  distribution  circles.  For  example,  in  an  effort  to\nincrease  the  number  of  high-profile  customers,  line  extensions  for  HT  consumers  can  now  be\napproved  by  superintending  engineers,  and  for  industrial  consumers  up  to  5  MW  by  regional\nchief engineers instead of requiring approval of MPSEB board members.\n\n68.\nIn  response  to  the  changes  resulting  from  the  sector  reforms,  MPSEB  is  adjusting  its\norganizational set-up. MPSEB\u2019s reform coordination structure mirrors MPG\u2019s, in the sense that\nis  supported  by  a  coordination\nMPSEB\u2019s  High-Level  Reform  Coordination  Committee \ncommittee,  which  in  turn  collaborates  closely  with  the  Corporate  Planning  Group,  (the\ncounterparts for CIDA\u2019s EISP), which acts as MPSEB\u2019s resource center for coordination with the\nreform process and is equivalent to MPG\u2019s implementation task force.\n\n69.\nA  tariff  and  regulatory  affairs  cell  is  being  created  by  MPSEB  to  concentrate  and\ncultivate specialist expertise for the annual tariff filings and to act as the focal point for any data\nrequest by MPSERC. The expertise of senior officers assigned to the social and environmental\nmanagement cell was obtained during their work with the Corporate Planning Group on power\nsystem  planning,  and  financial  and  socioeconomic  analysis.  Officers  assigned  to  the  project\nmanagement unit (PMU) were involved in preparing project reports for submission to ADB under\nthe project loan and have been associated with reform-related activities carried out by corporate\nplanning  group.  All  new  organizational  units  are  staffed  with  officers  representing  generation,\ntransmission,  and  distribution  functions  with  a  view  to  the  unbundling  of  MPSEB,  and  the\nexpertise and functional requirements of the new companies.\n\nThe  successful  implementation  of  the  reform  initiatives  requires  a  combination  of\n70.\nfinancial  support  for  reform  adjustment  costs  and  system  improvements,  and  technical  advice\non properly integrating the reforms into operational procedures and their implementation in day-\nto-day management of MPSEB.\n\nD. \n\nThe Investment Project\n\n1. \n\nProject Description\n\nAn  outline  description  of  the  investment  components  (the  Project)  is  given  in\n\n71.\nSupplementary Appendix C.

The  PRA  objective\nwas  to  investigate  the  impacts  of  the  reform  process  on  consumers,  especially  the  poor.  The\nPRA  also  examined  barriers  for  the  poor  to  access  electricity  connections.  In  addition,\nconsultations were held with three MPSEB labor unions and associations representing different\nclasses of employees to discuss the concerns of the employees with regard to the current status\nof  MPSEB  and  the  reform  process.  The  unions  expressed  concern  in  three  major  areas:\n(i) political interference in MPSEB operations, including tariff setting; noting that field staff were\noften put in a situation of implementing policies with little support for enforcement; (ii) MPSEB\u2019s\nfinancial status and allocation of resources for maintenance; and (iii) lack of generation capacity.\nUltimately,  the  current  situation  in  the  areas  where  the  unions  expressed  concern  affects  the\nmorale, dedication, and incentives to enforce policies.\n\nMP has a high percentage of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes (SC/ST). They are\n75.\noverrepresented  among  households  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  tribal  population\nconstitutes  approximately  23.3  percent  of  the  total  population,  is  mainly  rural,  and  is\ncharacterized by small and marginal landholdings; forest-based occupations; and limited access\nto  water  resources,  and  infrastructure  and  agricultural  technology  including  electrical  irrigation\npumps. Under the new MPSEB policy on free power supply, SC/ST consumers living below the\npoverty  line  are  eligible  for  the  single-point  scheme;  the  connection  charge  is  amortized  over\nfour  monthly  installments.  This  policy  does  not  apply  to  other  consumers  living  below  the\npoverty line.\n\n76.\nThe new mandatory metering policy of MPSEB was found to be more beneficial for low-\nincome  and  poor  households  as  opposed  to  the  flat  rate  tariff  currently  charged;  the  per-unit\ncharge  is  higher  on  a  flat  rate  basis.  The  current  schedule  of  load  shedding  combined  with\nbilling  on  a  flat  rate  basis  is  regressive  in  the  sense  that  consumers  experiencing  more  load\nshedding will be paying a higher unit rate than consumers experiencing less.\n\n77.\nThe  PRA  findings  indicate  a  consistent  demand  and  willingness  to  pay  for  improved\nsupply of power services, even in remote areas, for irrigation and domestic use. This finding is\nalso  confirmed  by  the  poverty  impact  assessment  (Appendix  6).  However,  the  seasonality  of\nagriculture  results  in  a  mismatch  of  rural  farm  incomes  and  MPSEB  billing  practices.\nFurthermore, small and marginal SC/ST farmers who have been exempted from power charges\nand who now have to pay unless they are classified as living below the poverty line are finding it\ndifficult to pay as their access to water resources and alternative income sources have declined.\nThe  PRA  found  that  while  MPSEB  informally  implements  installment-based  payments  of  bills,\nsuch  installments  need  to  be  systematized  and  poverty-related  policies  and  guidelines  for  the\npower sector more effectively communicated to MPSEB field staff.\n\nThe  PRA  found  a  substantial  number  of  illegal  connections  among  low-income\n78.\nhouseholds, which MPSEB finds difficult to legalize. These connections are partially a result of\nthe  recent  policy  changes  requiring  certificates  to  prove  \u201cbelow-poverty\u201d  status,  which  can  be\ndifficult to obtain for poorer households. While MPSEB and MPG are attempting to mitigate this\nproblem  by  authorizing  village  heads  to  issue  the  certificates,  not  all  village  heads  have  yet\nbeen made aware of this new scheme. However, the PRA found that the major reason for illegal\nconnections appears to be the inability of poorer consumers to pay up-front connection charges\nand associated fees in one payment, and found that 12 monthly installments would facilitate the\n\n\f21\n\nability  of  these  consumers  to  afford  the  initial  charges.  The  findings  where  discussed  with\nMPSEB, which agreed to introduce a 12 month installment facility applicable to all consumers\nliving below the poverty line. A detailed analysis of the barriers for poor households to access\nelectricity is also provided in Appendix 6.\n\n2. \n\nEnvironment\n\n79.\nThe  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  policy  and  institutional  changes  under  the\nSDP as per the Reform Act were evaluated (Appendix 7). Most potential impacts are considered\nbeneficial  from  an  environmental  point  of  view.  Policy  dialogue  is  ongoing  with  MPSERC  to\nenhance  benefits  by  institutionalizing  environmental  management  in  sector  regulation  and  to\nalso  increase  public  participation  during  conceptualization  of  new  investment  projects.  On  the\noperational  side,  MPSEB  has  agreed  to  establish  a  fully  functional  social  and  environmental\nmanagement  cell;  selection  of  officers  is  ongoing.  The  new  cell  will  include  an  environmental\nmanagement  and  monitoring  section  to  ensure  that  the  Project  is  undertaken,  and  all  project\nfacilities operated and maintained in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,\nincluding ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirements. A proposed organizational setup for\nthe cell is in Supplementary Appendix E.\n\nfor  components  A  and  C, \n\n80.\nThe Project is classified as Environment Category B as it will have limited environmental\nimpacts during construction and operational stages. Based on the environmental assessments\nand  surveys  conducted \nthe  associated  potential  adverse\nenvironmental impacts can be mitigated to an acceptable level by adequate implementation of\nthe  measures  outlined  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE);  a  summary  is  given  in\nAppendix 7. Although 1.4 kilometers of the alignment of the transmission lines is forested, it is\neither  degraded  Grade  IV  forest  or  no  tree  is  standing  on  the  affected  area.  No  endangered,\nrare,  or  threatened  species  of  flora  or  fauna  have  been  reported  in  the  project  sites.\nNevertheless, compensatory forestry will be strictly implemented in coordination with the State\nForest  Department.  Adequate  provisions  have  been  made  in  the  Project  to  cover  the\nenvironmental mitigation and monitoring requirements, and their associated costs.\n\n81.\nMPSEB\u2019s current technical specification for transformer oil and practices of reclamation\nof  used  transformer  oil  shows  its  capability  of  handling  process-generated  wastes  to  minimize\nadverse  environmental  effects  of \nIndia\u2019s\nEnvironmental  Protection  Act  and  other  applicable  regulations  for  the  handling  of  used\ntransformer oil. All new transformer and capacitors purchased under the project loan by MPSEB\nmust be polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-free and specifications in the bidding documents will be\nmade accordingly.\n\nthe  components.  MPSEB  will  comply  with \n\n82.\nNo significant rehabilitation, land acquisition, or compensation is required for the Project.\nFor  the  Jabalpur,  Khargone,  and  Mandsaur  areas  under  component  A,  site  selection  for\nsubstations  and  routing  of  transmission  lines  has  been  completed,  and  a  land  acquisition  and\ncompensation  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on\ninvoluntary  resettlement.22  The  social  assessment  shows  that  49  of  the  62  proposed  sites  for\nsubstations  are  government  owned,  and  will  be  transferred  to  MPSEB  for  nominal  payments.\nThese  sites  are  free  of  encroachments.  The  remaining  13  sites  are  privately  owned  and  are\nmostly agricultural lands belonging to small-and medium-sized landholders. Field visits revealed\nthat the owners of these sites were willing to donate their land to MPSEB with the expectation\nthat  their  power  supply  will  improve.  However,  MPSEB  decided  to  compensate  the  owners  in\n\n                  \n\n22 ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Handbook on Resettlement. Manila.\n\n\f22\n\naccordance with market rates for comparable land. Crop compensation as per market rates and\nproduction  levels  will  be  paid  for  any  crop  losses  that  might  occur  during  construction.  Rs40\nmillion is included is included in the project cost for these purposes.\n\n 83.\nFor  the  remaining  components,  pending  final  site  selection  for  construction  of\nsubstations  and  routing  of  transmission  lines,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  frameworks\nwere  prepared  in  keeping  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  The  resettlement\nframework for the Project is based on the principles that involuntary resettlement will be avoided\nor  minimized  where  possible  by  exploring  other  alternative  project  designs,  and  where  land\nacquisition is unavoidable, people losing assets, livelihoods, or other resources will be assisted\nin restoring or preferably improving their former standard of living. All those affected are entitled\nto  be  compensated  for  their  lost  assets,  incomes,  and  businesses  at  replacement  cost,  and\nprovided with rehabilitation measures in keeping with the ADB policy. Lack of legal rights will not\nbe a bar to rehabilitation assistance for people affected by the Project. Compensation for ethnic\nminorities,  households  headed  by  women,  and  families  with  disabled  and  other  vulnerable\nfamilies will be carried out with respect for their particular cultural and specific needs. The final\nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  in  keeping  with  ADB  policy,  and  be\nreviewed and approved by ADB prior to construction activities. Implementation of the plans will\nbe monitored by the PMU, which will submit regular reports to ADB.\n \n\nV. \n\nTHE LOANS\n\nA. \n\nThe Policy Loan\n\n1. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n\n84.\nThe  Government  of  India  has  requested  a  policy  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s\nordinary capital resources to help finance the policy component of the SDP. The loan will have a\n15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3 years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum;  a\nfront-end fee of 1.0 percent, (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), conversion options that may\nbe exercised in accordance with terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations, and\nADB\u2019s  Conversion  Guidelines;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan\nAgreement.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i) the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow\nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an\nundertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent decision and not made\nin reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The counterpart funds to be generated\nfrom  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  from  the  Government  to  MPG  under  normal\narrangements  for  the  transfer  of  external  assistance.  The  funds  transferred  to  MPG  will  be\ntreated  as  \u201cadditional\u201d  to  the  Government\u2019s  transfers  allocated  annually  to  MPG.  The\nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk in accordance with its policy.\n\n85.\n\nMPG is expected to incur the following costs of adjustments over the reform period:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPayments of outstanding dues of municipalities and other local and state bodies\noutstanding  as  of  31  March  2001  will  cost  approximately  Rs7,423  million  ($164\nmillion) after deducting 26 percent on account of bifurcation.\n\nRationalization  of  electricity  duty  is  expected  to  cause  a  revenue  loss  of  about\nRs350  million  ($7.5  million)  each  year  in  the  next  five  years  for  a  total  of\n$37 million.\n\n\f23\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSet-off  of  dues  of  market  borrowing  of  MPSEB  to  MPG  will  result  in  costs  of\nRs6,750 million ($144 million) over a five years period.\n\nSet-off  of  cross-liabilities23  between  MPG  and  MPSEB  will  result  in  a  one-time\npayment of Rs620 million ($13.2 million).\n\n(v) \n\nReduction of debt obligations of MPSEB.\n\n2. \n\nExecuting Agencies\n\nThe Executing Agencies will be the Finance Department and the Energy Department of\n\n86.\nMPG.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n87.\nThe proceeds of the policy loan will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs\n(excluding the local duties and taxes) of imports produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member\ncountries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible items (Supplementary Appendix G)\nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. All procurement will be through\nnormal  commercial  practices  in  case  of  procurement  by  the  private  sector,  or  prescribed\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  in  the  case  of  procurement  by  the  public  sector,  having  due\nregard  for  the  principles  of  economy  and  efficiency.  The  Government  will  certify  that  (i) if  the\nproceeds  of  the  loan  will  finance  imports  already  made,  the  value  of  eligible  imports  in  the\nperiod concerned exceeds the amount of the requested withdrawal, or (ii) if the loan proceeds\nare to finance goods to be imported, the value of eligible imports in the immediately preceding\n12 months period is equal to or greater than the amount of the requested disbursement plus all\nother amounts expected to be withdrawn from the loan during the succeeding one year.\n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n88.\nCounterpart funds generated by the policy loan will be transferred by the Government to\nMPG  and  be  used  by  MPG  under  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  support  the  financial\nrestructuring of MPSEB and adjustment costs associated with the SDP, including (i) payment of\noutstanding  municipalities\u2019  and  other  local  and  state  bodies\u2019  dues  owed  to  MPSEB,\n(ii) rationalization of electricity duty, (iii) set-off of dues of market borrowings of MPSEB to MPG,\n(iv) set-off of cross liabilities between MPG and MPSEB, and (v) reduction of debt obligations of\nMPSEB.\n\n5.

While sales revenue of MPEB has consistently increased from Rs47.3 billion in FY1998\nto  Rs54.5  billion  in  FY2000,  cash  flow  position  has  deteriorated  as  shown  in  earnings  before\ninterest,  taxes,  depreciation,  and  amortization,  and  in  FY2000  revenue  narrowly  covered\noperating cost, leaving no cash available for debt service. One of the major reasons for this was\nthe high cost structure due to the high level of T&D losses, estimated at 31.6 percent in FY2000\nas  compared  with  an  estimated  19.3  percent  in  FY1999.  This  sharp  increase  resulted  from\nreassessment of consumption of agricultural consumers. As most of agricultural consumers are\nnot  metered,  their  consumption  tended  to  be  overestimated  and  they  are  overbilled;  this\ncontributes  to  an  underestimation  of  losses.  A  recent  study  by  MPSEB  in  collaboration  with\nEISP  on  actual  consumption  by  unmetered  consumers  has  revealed  that  the  actual  system\nlosses for MPSEB could be as high as 47.1 percent in FY2000.\n\n98.\nAnother reason for the cash flow problems is low cost recovery as shown in Table 7. In\nFY2000, the tariff covered only 60 percent of cost of supply due to the highly subsidized tariff for\nLT  consumers,  particularly  agricultural  and  domestic  consumers.  In  addition,  fuel  and  power\npurchase  cost  continually  increased  well  above  revenue  increases.  The  lack  of  an  automatic\nfuel  or  power  purchase  cost  adjustment  mechanism,  which  passes  cost  fluctuations  on  to\nconsumers, has also contributed to squeezing profit margins of MPEB. MPEB started to have a\nserious  cash  flow  problem  in  FY1999.  In  response  to  this,  tariffs  were  raised  in  March  1999.\nHowever,  the  increase  was  only  sufficient  to  cover  increasing  operating  costs,  and  MPEB\ncontinued to post substantial net losses.\n\n99.\nUntil FY1999, MPEB continued to achieve 3 percent statutory rate of return on net fixed\nassets  after  subsidy  and  subvention  from  MPG.  However,  MPG  was  unable  to  budget  for  the\nrequired subsidy and subvention amounts, and was not even able to pay budgeted amounts in\ncash. Adjusting subsidy and subvention payments at the end of each fiscal year against MPEB\u2019s\npayments  of  liabilities  to  MPG  has  been  common  practice.  In  FY2000,  MPEB  stopped\nrecognizing unbudgeted subsidies in its accounts and was thus not able to achieve a 3 percent\nrate of return. Even after this change of accounting policy, subsidy and subvention receivable of\nMPEB stood at Rs23.3 billion as of 31 March 2001.\n\nii. \n\nFinancial Position of MPSEB\n\nIn  April  2001  the  Government  issued  a  provisional  order  whereby  assets  and  project-\n100.\nrelated  liabilities  of  MPEB  would  be  apportioned  on  a  geographical  location  basis  between\nMPSEB  and  CSEB  while  non  project-related  liabilities  would  be  apportioned  based  on  a\n\n\f28\n\npopulation  basis  (MP:  Chhattisgarh  =  73.38:26.62).  The  pro  forma  financial  figures  in  Table  6\nwere prepared as per this order. Accordingly, MPSEB would assume approximately 79 percent\nof  the  total  long-term  debt  of  MPEB.  On  the  other  hand,  MPSEB  would  retain  only\napproximately 67 percent of the total revenue base of MPEB, losing a substantial proportion of\nthe  high-profile  industrial  customers  while  keeping  94  percent  of  MPEB\u2019s  agricultural\nconsumers. Therefore, the Government\u2019s order further undermines MPSEB\u2019s capacity to service\nits debt obligations. Both MPSEB and CSEB have requested the Government to reconsider the\norder.\n\nIndependent from the final apportionment of assets and liabilities, the new MPSEB faces\n101.\nmore serious financial problem than its predecessor. In addition to the shift in its customer base,\nT&D  losses  are  estimated  at  about  49  percent  in  FY2001;  this  coupled  with  accumulating\nenergy  dues from public  sector consumers (Rs8.75  billion as of 31 March 2001), continues to\nsqueeze MPSEB\u2019s cash flow. MPG had no fiscal space to provide sufficient budgetary support\nin cash and has accumulated unpaid subsidy of Rs18.5 billion as of March 2001 (estimate after\ndeducting  26.62  percent  on  account  of  bifurcation).  Consequently,  with  the  current  tariff  level,\nMPSEB has been unable to fully pay its dues to power and fuel suppliers, and defaulted on its\npayment obligations to creditors.\n\n102.\nTo break the vicious spiral of this circular debt, MPG agreed under the SDP to offset its\nsubsidy-related  and  other  liabilities  owed  to  MPSEB  (Rs18.5  billion)  against  its  loans  owed  to\nMPG  (Rs17.9  billion).  The  net  balance  of  Rs0.6  billion  was  paid  in  cash  by  MPG  to  MPSEB.\nFurthermore, MPG agreed to pay all outstanding energy dues of municipalities and other MPG\nbodies and to ensure that they will remain current with their bills. MPG will use the entire policy\nloan  under  the  SDP  to  settle,  in  cash,  municipality  and  other  MPG  arrears  outstanding  as  of\n31 March  2001  (Rs7.4  billion).  As  regards  dues  after  March  2001,  MPG  has  committed  that  if\nmunicipalities  and  state  government  bodies  do  not  make  full  payments  of  their  energy  dues,\nappropriations at source will be made by MPG so that the balance of receivables do not exceed\none-month  equivalent  of  sales.  These  measures  will  help  MPSEB  overcome  its  immediate\nliquidity  problem,  clean  up  its  balance  sheet,  repay  some  of  its  creditors,  and  improve  its\nborrowing capacity for future investments.\n\n103. As of 31 March 2001, MPSEB owed approximately Rs16 billion to central power sector\nundertakings,  mainly  NTPC,  Nuclear  Power  Corporation,  and  Coal  India.  Since  accumulated\nliabilities to central power sector undertaking is a common problem of SEBs throughout India, a\ncommittee  was  set  up  by  the  Government  to  look  into  strategies  for  a  one-time  settlement  of\ndebts. The committee proposed that the state governments take over the SEBs\u2019 liabilities and\nissue a 15-year tax-free bond to the central power sector creditors bearing 8.5 percent interest\nper annum with a 5-year grace period for repayment. In this securitization scheme, payment of\ncurrent  dues  by  SEBs  would  need  to  be  guaranteed  by  the  state  governments.  To  become\neffective,  the  scheme  requires  consent  from  a  majority  of  state  governments.  However,  some\nuncertainty exists as to whether the scheme would be workable given substantial liabilities to be\nassumed  by  state  governments,  many  of  which  have  little  fiscal  space.  NTPC,  one  of  the\nbiggest  nonfinancial  creditors  to  MPSEB,  has  indicated  that  regardless  of  this  one-time\nsettlement issue it would continue to supply power unless MPSEB defaults on current dues.\n\nb. \n\nProjected Financial Performance\n\n104.

MPSERC issued a tariff award in September 2001. As shown in Table 7, average tariffs\nfor LT and HT consumers were raised by 16 percent and 13 percent respectively, resulting in an\noverall tariff increase of 11 percent due to expected change in the consumer mix from FY2001\nto FY2002. Although the new agricultural tariff is still far below the cost of supply, new tariffs are\nexpected to boost FY2002 revenue by 17 percent27 on an annual basis. Further tariff increases\nare  projected  to  enable  MPSEB  to  achieve  at  least  75  percent  cost  recovery  by  FY2007  as\nrequired by the Reform Act except for agricultural consumers and a minor bulk purchaser. The\nprojected  average  retail  tariff  per  kWh  for  each  consumer  category  is  provided  in  Appendix  8,\nTable A8.2. The projection envisages that (i) a modest tariff increase will continue to be given to\nthe  consumer  categories  being  already  charged  higher-than-cost  tariff,  and  (ii) tariff  increase\nabove inflation rate for consumers paying tariff below cost of service until achieving 100 percent\ncost of recovery. For commercial and industrial consumers in HT and LT categories, no further\ntariff  increase  is  assumed  once  the  tariffs  reach  the  breakeven  point  of  cost  of  captive  power\n(approximately Rs5.00/kwh). Also in September 2001, the MPG raised cess on electricity from\nRs0.01 to Rs0.10 per unit. This is expected to generate additional tax revenue of Rs1.5 billion to\nRs1.6 billion per year.\n\nc. \n\nImpact of the SDP on MPSEB\u2019s Financial Projections\n\n106.\nThe  projected  financial  results  also  depend  on  substantial  reduction  of  losses,\nparticularly  nontechnical  losses.  In  the  projection,  the  current  T&D  losses  are  assumed  to  be\n49.0 percent in FY2001 based on the recent MPSEB estimate. The losses are projected to be\nreduced  by  5  percent  in  FY2002,  3  percent  annually  up  to  FY  2007,  and  diminishing  margins\nthereafter. The projected reduction of T&D losses is in line with MPSEB\u2019s comprehensive loss\n\n                  \n\n27 Since new tariffs became effective on 26 September 2001, net increase of revenue in FY 2002 will be about 6.6\n\npercent.\n\n\f30\n\nreduction plan partly financed under the Project. The projection also envisages improvement of\ncollection efficiency due to computerization of the revenue management system financed under\nthe Project and the MPG\u2019s assurance under the SDP of full recovery of dues from municipalities\nand other state government bodies.\n\n107. Based  on  the  MOU  between  MPG  and  MPSEB  (agreed  upon  under  the  SDP),  the\nprojection  envisages  (i) any  future  subsidy  and  subvention  to  be  paid  in  cash,  (ii) free  power\nsupply bills to be fully reimbursed monthly, (iii) cash grant equal to electricity duties and cess to\nbe provided monthly, and (iv) additional cash injection in the form of subvention and/or capital\ngrant  to  be  provided  to  the  extent  necessary  for  MPSEB  to  remain  solvent.  As  MPSEB  has\ndefaulted on all creditors and cannot afford to fully service its debt obligations for the next few\nyears,  it  needs  to  agree  with  lenders  and  bondholders  on  debt  restructuring  as  soon  as\npossible.  Under  EISP,  CIDA  is  financing  TA  to  prepare  a  debt  restructuring  plan  for  MPSEB.\nInitiation of negotiations with creditors based on the plan is a second tranche release condition\nunder  the  Program.  In  the  projection,  debt  service  obligations,  which  have  become  due  and\nunpaid,  as  well  as  ones  that  will  become  due  over  the  next  three  years,  are  assumed  to  be\nrescheduled in a manner reasonably acceptable to creditors.\n\n108.\nThe  financial  projections  in  Table  8  and  in  Appendix  8  present  a  base  case  scenario\nduring  SDP  implementation.  The  projection  indicates  that  MPSEB  would  be  able  to  overcome\nimmediate liquidity shortage through additional cash in-flow from tariff increase, partial recovery\nof arrears from municipalities and state government bodies, and cash injection from MPG in the\nform  of  subsidies  and  subventions.  In  the  medium  to  long  term,  efficiency  improvement,\nparticularly  T&D  loss  reduction,  will  be  a  key  driver  for  recovery  of  financial  soundness.\nReduction of losses by 3 \u2013 5 percent annually, together with an average annual tariff increase of\nabout  6  percent28  and  continued  government  support,  is  expected  to  bring  MPSEB  back  to  a\nbreak-even position in FY2008 and 3 percent rate of return in FY2010 on an after-subsidy and\nsubvention  basis.  This  means  that  from  FY2010  onward,  MPG  would  start  to  phase  out  the\nannual subsidies and subventions. An upside scenario would be feasible if MPSERC increases\nthe agricultural tariff to achieve 75 percent cost recovery by FY2007 and MPSEB accelerates its\nloss reduction program to achieve target 22 percent by FY2007. In this scenario, MPSEB would\nachieve positive net income without subsidies and subventions by FY2006.\n\n3. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\na. \n\nManagement\n\n109.\nThe  MPSEB  Chairman  will  be  in  overall  charge  of  the  Project.  Day-to-day  project\nimplementation will be undertaken and supervised by the PMU, which was established in May\n2001 specifically for the Project, headed by a senior MPSEB officer. The PMU will be assisted\nby  a  team  of  consultants  to  refine  project  details,  procurement  activities,  and  project\nmanagement in general. MPSEB is in the process of expanding the staff strength of the PMU to\ncorrespond  with  the  increased  workload.  Except  for  exceptional  organizational  requirements,\nthe staff assigned to the PMU will be retained for the entire duration of project implementation in\nthe PMU and any vacancy in the PMU will be filled before such vacancy is made effective. The\nPMU will be delegated decision-making powers.\n\n                  \n\n28 Annual tariff increase is projected at 10 percent for LT consumers and 4 percent for HT consumers until FY2007.\n\n\f31\n\nb. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Performance Review\n\n110. Project implementation will commence in January 2002 and be completed in December\n2005  (Supplementary  Appendix  J).  Direct  supervision  of  implementation  and  monitoring  the\noperational performance of the components will be the responsibility of MPSEB. The PMU will\nprepare progress reports for the respective project components and submit them to MPG and\nADB on a quarterly basis within 20 days of the end of each quarter. The reports will contain a\nnarrative description of progress made during the period. ADB will monitor the overall financial\nand technical performance of the state\u2019s power sector, and the MPG\u2019s fiscal position. MPSEB\nwill  set  up  a  benefit  monitoring  unit  (BMU)  within  and  reporting  to  the  PMU,  to  monitor  and\nevaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  and  progress  of  SDP  achievement.  The\nquarterly  reporting  will  include  socioeconomic  and  poverty  indicators  reflecting  the  impacts  of\nthe  policy  and  the  project  components  on  end-consumers,  particularly  those  living  below  the\npoverty  line.  Using  consulting  services,  the  BMU  will  undertake  an  in-depth  qualitative  and\nquantitative  assessment  of  the  impacts  of  the  reform  on  end-consumers.  Outline  terms  of\nreference for the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix K.\n\nc. \n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n111. Since  the  disbursements  under  the  Project  will  be  mainly  for  supply  of  goods,  ADB's\ncommitment and direct payment procedures will be used for disbursement purposes.\n\nd. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audits\n\n112. MPSEB  and  the  PMU  will  prepare  separate  progress  reports  for  their  respective\ncomponents and submit them to ADB on a quarterly basis within 20 days from the end of each\nquarter.  The  reports  will  include  narrative  descriptions  of  progress  made  during  the  period;\nchanges  to  the  implementation  schedule,  if  any;  problems  or  difficulties  encountered  and  the\nremedial  actions  taken;  the  performance  of  the  project  implementation  consultants  where\napplicable;  and  the  work  to  be  carried  out  in  the  upcoming  period.  The  reports  will  also  include\nsummary  financial  accounts  for  the  Project  consisting  of  project  expenditures  during  the  period,\nyear to date, and total expenditure to date. ADB will review the implementation and operation of\nthe  Project  based  on  these  reports  and  meet  with  MPSEB  and  the  MPG  officials  at  least\nsemiannually  to  discuss  project  progress.  Completion  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within\nthree  months  from  completion  of  each  of  the  components.  A  project  completion  report  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB within three months of physical completion of the Project.\n\n113. MPSEB will have its annual financial statements, including the income statement, balance\nsheet, and sources and applications of funds statements, audited by a professional auditing firm\nacceptable to ADB. Unaudited statements will be submitted to ADB within six months and audited\nstatements  within  nine  months  from  the  close  of  the  financial  year.  MPSEB  will  also  submit  to\nADB audited project accounts and the auditors\u2019 observations with respect to compliance with the\nloan covenants.\n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services\n\n114. ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines\nfor Procurement.  For  such  procurement,  bidding  documents  will  be  prepared  in  a  manner  to\nensure  maximum  competition  under  international  competitive  bidding.  Each  supply  contract,\nestimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more, will be awarded on the basis of international\ncompetitive bidding. Each contract estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $500,000 will be\nawarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping.  For  transmission  lines  and  grid  substations  in\n\n\f32\n\ngeneral, separate contracts will be let on the basis of supply of materials. The contract for erection\nof transmission lines will, however, include supply of tower steel. For facilities at 33kV and below,\nmaterials and equipment will be procured under supply only contracts. Erection will be done either\nby  MPSEB\u2019s  own  staff  or  under  separate  erection  contracts  to  be  let  on  the  basis  of  local\ncompetitive  bidding. A list of the  major contract packages under the Project with their estimated\ncosts  is  attached  in  Appendix  9.  To  expedite  the  procurement  process,  advance  procurement\naction was approved and MPSEB has been advised that approval of such advance procurement\naction by ADB does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing Project. The Project does not include\nretroactive financing.\n\n115.\nTo assist with timely project implementation, an international consulting firm with expertise\nin  transmission  line  and  substation  construction,  and  project  management  will  be  engaged,\nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  About  72  person-months  of  consulting\nservices  are  expected  to  be  required  for  this  purpose  during  the  first  two  years  of  project\nimplementation.  A  broad  outline  of  the  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  is  given  in\nSupplementary Appendix L.\n\n116.\nFor  implementation  of  component  D:  Computerization  of  Information  and  Revenue\nManagement  System,  as  also  to  carry  out  benefit  monitoring  of  the  SDP,  MPSEB  will  engage\nexternal consultants, using its own funds and procedures. If however, ADB financing is required\nfor consulting services, then ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants will be followed.\n\nVI. \n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nFinancial evaluation was undertaken for components A, B, and C. The financial rate of\n117.\nreturn of each component is satisfactory compared with MPSEB\u2019s weighted average real cost of\ncapital  of  7.81  percent.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  each  component  and  its\nsensitivity  analysis  are  summarized  in  Table  9.  The  sensitivity  analysis  for  components  A,  B,\nand  C  confirmed  that  they  would  be  expected  to  produce  reasonable  financial  returns  under\nvarious  downside  scenarios.  The  major  assumptions  used  in  the  financial  evaluation  of  the\nProject and detailed calculations are in Appendix 10.\n\nTable 9: Sensitivity Analysis of the Financial Internal Rate of Return\n\nScenario\n\nBase Case\na. 10% Increase in Capital Cost\nb.

With overall T&D losses estimated at 47 percent, comprehensive reduction of losses\nis  one  of  MPSEB\u2019s  priorities.  MPSEB\u2019s  loss  reduction  strategy  targets  three  levels:  (i) energy\naudit  and  end-user  metering,  (ii) internal  efficiency  improvement  through  computerized  billing\nand revenue system, and (iii) physical investments directly targeting loss reduction.\n\n\f33\n\n119. Benefits from loss reduction are threefold. First, they will generate additional revenue for\nMPSEB. Second, commercial loss reduction in particular will reduce power demand for different\ncustomer  categories,  and  will  thus  indirectly  contribute  to  reduced  power  shortages.  Third,\ntechnical loss reduction in particular will result in economic resource cost savings as less units\nneed to be generated, transmitted, and distributed to supply the same amount of energy to end-\nconsumers.\n\n120. Project components A and B are for investment in the five distribution regions of MP with\nthe  highest  losses,  namely,  Bhopal,  Gwalior,  Indore,  Jabalpur,  and  Ujjain.  Component  C  is\ndirected at transmission system improvements throughout MP to reduce technical losses. The\nmethodology applied for the three components is similar.\n\nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  at  border  price  level  using  FY2001  prices.  To\n121.\nconvert  financial  cost  into  economic  cost,  taxes  and  duties  were  deducted.  No  price\ncontingencies  are  included  in  the  base  capital  cost,  but  the  economic  capital  costs  include\n10 percent  physical  contingencies.  The  costs  were  separated  into  foreign  exchange,  indirect\nforeign  exchange,  and  local  currency  costs.  Local  costs  were  further  separated  and  specific\nconversion factors used for unskilled labor. The remaining local costs were converted to border\nprices by applying a standard conversion factor. Annual operation and maintenance cost were\nalso calculated in economic prices.\n\n122.\nThe  economic  benefits  of  loss  reduction  were  calculated  separately  for  technical  and\ncommercial  loss  reduction.  Technical  loss  reduction  under  component  A  was  valued  at  the\naverage  cost  of  supply  at  LT  level  for  FY2002,  and  for  component  C  at  the  average  cost  of\nsupply  at  extra  high  tension  level  for  FY2000,  the  latest  year  for  which  the  breakdown  is\navailable.  Commercial  loss  reduction  was  valued  at  the  increasing  tariff  levels  up  to  FY2010,\nreflecting  the  changing  relationship  between  average  cost  of  supply  and  average  tariff,  which\nresults in reduction of economic subsidies over the lifetime of the Project. Benefits are expected\nto build up gradually over three years.\n\n123.\nThe  base  case  economic  internal  rates  of  return  are  estimated  at  17.1 percent  for\ncomponent  A,  16.8  percent  for  component  B,  and  at  16.4  percent  for  Project  component  C.\nThey  were  calculated  for  25  years,  including  the  construction  period.  No  residual  values  were\nconsidered.  Comprehensive  sensitivity  analysis,  including  calculation  of  switching  values,\nindicated that the economic internal rate of return values for all components are above the 12\npercent threshold for all adverse circumstances tested. Details of the economic analysis and the\nsensitivity analysis are in Appendix 11.\n\n3. \n\nPoverty and Environmental Dimensions\n\n124.\nThe  current  state  of  electricity  supply  and  operations  has  serious  adverse  impacts  on\nincome earning activities for the poor. They are affected both indirectly, through reduced wage\nemployment  opportunities,29  and  directly,  through  reduced  farm  profitability  and  household\nwelfare. The restructuring process provides an opportunity for MPSEB to review its operations\nand the impacts on consumers. For MPG, it provides an opportunity to review the impacts of the\ntariff  and  subsidy  policy  and  other  interventions  in  the  power  sector.  An  in-depth  poverty\nassessment  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  impacts  of  the  reforms  and  of  the  investment\ncomponent on the poor under the SDP (Appendix 6).\n\n                  \n\n29 This is particularly affecting the landless and the poorest of the poor.\n\n\f34\n\nThe  poverty  assessment  revealed  that  the  poor  face  significant  barriers  to  access\n125.\nelectricity.  The  new  policy  of  MPSEB  includes  applying  connection  charges  retroactively.  The\npoverty  assessment  revealed  that  the  introduction  of  connection  charges  constituted  a  barrier\nfor the poor to access electricity. Under the current policy SC/ST consumers below the poverty\nline are eligible for a single-point scheme for which the connection charge is amortized in four\nmonthly  installments.  However,  a  majority  of  the  poor  do  not  fall  into  the  SC/ST  category  and\nare  as  such  not  eligible  for  the  scheme.  On  the  basis  of  an  affordability  assessment  and  in\nconsultations  with  the  poor  MPSEB  will  introduce  an  interest-free  12  month  installment  facility\nfor all consumers below the poverty line.\n\n126.\nThe  current  tariff  and  subsidy  structure  has  hampered  economic  growth  through  its\nburden on the fiscal budget, crowding out alternative public investments, and through its burden\non the banking sector, with consequent credit squeeze for private investments. Most of the poor\ndo  not  have  electricity  connections  and  as  such  they  are  not  beneficiaries  of  subsidized\nelectricity  tariffs.  However,  they  are  indirectly  paying  in  terms  of  forgone  investments  and  are\ndirectly  affected  by  the  lack  of  ability  of  MPSEB  to  provide  good  quality  of  services  and  to\nexpand the network into poorer areas. Thus, the current subsidy and tariff structure cannot be\ndefended on the basis of providing cheap services to the poor. Although the agricultural tariffs\nsubsidize  input  costs  for  the  agricultural  sector,  this  has  severely  hampered  the  ability  of\nMPSEB  to  provide  good  quality  of  services.  Tariffs  set  below  the  cost  of  supply,  without\nadequate  compensation  from  MPG,  has  made  load  shedding  financially  beneficial  for  MPSEB\nwhereas it has adverse impacts on consumers and economic growth.\n\n127. Most  of  the  poor  are  not  connected,  and  those  who  are,  experience  poor  quality  of\nservices. Farm profitability has been especially affected by voltage fluctuations since in addition\nto  reducing  farm  output,  it  has  led  to  increased  costs.  The  findings  show  that  the  impact  of\nvoltage fluctuations has been especially costly for the poor. Load-shedding has led to reduced\nfarm output and forced consumers to diversify their energy sources, with consequent reduction\nin  benefits  of  electricity  use.  The  prevalence  of  unscheduled  load-shedding,  which  represents\nabout  62  percent  of  the  total  number  of  power  cuts,  has  especially  been  devastating  by\nincreasing uncertainty in production and consumption activities.\n\n128.\nThe new mandatory metering policy was found to be beneficial for poor consumers and\nwill act to reduce the impacts of tariff increases. Metered consumers pay a lower per unit tariff\nthan  unmetered  consumers.  In  addition,  it  benefits  consumers  who  consume  more  electricity.\nSince  the  majority  of  the  poor  are  unmetered  and  consume  small  amounts  the  effect  is\nregressive.  These  regressive  effects  of  the  tariff  structure  are  further  reinforced  by  the\noccurrence  of  load  shedding.  Consumers  experiencing  less  load  shedding  are  paying  a  lower\nper  unit  charge.  Metering  will  reduce  the  impacts  of  tariff  increases  on  the  poor.  Operational\nefficiency gains from the SPD will further reduce the need for and the impact of tariff increases.\n\n129.\nThe SDP is designed to improve the policy and institutional environment of the sector as\noutlined  in  the  Reform  Act  with  the  long-term  aim  of  improving  the  quality  and  quantity  of  the\npower  supply.  The  Reform  Act  has  positive  impacts  from  an  environmental  point  of  view  as  it\noffers the opportunity to institutionalize environmental management in sector regulation beyond\nthe existing all-India statutory environmental requirements. Also, the decentralization of powers\nfor  metering,  revenue  realization,  disconnection,  prosecution  for  theft,  meter  tampering,  and\ndiversion  of  electricity  to  new  power  sector  companies  will  facilitate  adoption  of  measures  to\nprevent energy wastage. This will contribute positively to more economic use of resources that\nwill enhance environmental conservation.\n\n\f35\n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n130.\n\nThe SDP has several perceived risks:\n\n131. Regulatory  Risk.  A  central  aspect  of  power  sector  reform  is  the  establishment  of  an\nindependent regulatory authority to ensure the commercial operation of the sector, including a\nrationalization for the tariff structure. A comprehensive program for institutional strengthening of\nMPSERC, in particular for tariff setting principles and other financial aspects is required. In the\npast, ADB supported participation of the three commissioners at an external training course and\nis currently preparing assistance to MPSERC for the drafting of rules, regulations, and licenses.\nDFID  has  prepared  terms  of  reference  for  long-term  consulting  support  for  MPSERC  and  has\nalready  given  approval  in  principal;  the  final  decision  by  DFID  is  expected  before  the  end  of\n2001.\n\n132.\nFinancial Situation of MPSEB. To bring the sector to a sound commercial footing and\nto promote private investment, MPSEB will have to overcome the short-term liquidity crisis and\nimprove  its  financial  viability  in  the  long  run.  Given  uncertainty  of  future  tariff  increase  and\noperational  efficiency  improvements,  MPSEB  will  need  to  substantially  reduce  its  financial\nburden  through  comprehensive  financial  restructuring  with  support  from  its  stakeholders\nincluding creditors, MPG, and the Government. Mitigation measures include the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nSettlement  of  unpaid  revenue  subsidy  by  MPG  through  a  set-off  against\noutstanding  state  government  loans  to  MPSEB  is  a  first  tranche  release\ncondition.  This  will  leave  MPSEB  less  leveraged  and  will  facilitate  raising  new\nfunds in the market at lower cost.\n\nCIDA  included  analysis  of  debt  and  liabilities  and  preparation  of  an  outline\nfinancial restructuring plan under their EISP assistance to MPSEB.\n\nMPG  and  MPSEB  to  agree  on  a  future  payment  modality  for  subsidies  and\nsubventions over the reform period.\n\n133. Support  for  Outstanding  Analytical  Work.  The  model  for  the  postreform  sector  has\nbeen agreed upon in principle. However, in addition to the financial and accounting work required\nfor  the  functional  segregation  and  the  distribution  reconfiguration  (provided  by  CIDA  under  the\nEISP), substantial work is needed to develop schemes to transfer assets, liabilities, and personnel\nto the new power sector companies and to introduce the computerized information and revenue\nmanagement  system.  The  India  country  strategy  program  for  2001  includes  three  small-scale\nTAs30 and the 2002 program includes a TA for MP Power Sector Reform. The proposed scope of\nthis  TA  is  expected  to  focus  on  developing  transfer  schemes  concerning  MPSEB,  under  the\nReform Act. If cofinancing for the outstanding work cannot be mobilized, ADB will make further TA\nfunds available to support the reform activities.\n\n134. Operational  Effectiveness.  The  operational  effectiveness  of  MPSEB  and  other  power\nsector entities that will be created during the reform period will be critical in determining success\nor failure. To improve effectiveness, processes are being built into the system to strengthen the\nentities capacity to deliver over time. These include the following:\n\n                  \n\n30 The TAs are for (i) corporate restructuring of MPSEB, (ii) business plan development, and (iii) capacity building for\n\nimproved customer responsiveness.\n\n\f36\n\n(i) \n\n(ii)\n\nThe  composition  of  board  of  directors  and  senior  management  of  new  sector\ncompanies  will  be  changed  to  include  professional  expertise  from  outside\ngovernment services. The operational performance is expected to improve as a\nresult of these measures.\n\nDelegation  of  authorities  to  management  of  distribution  circles  benefiting  from\nADB  assistance  is  being  promoted.  This  will  increase  the  accountability  and\nprepare employees and customers for the creation of new distribution companies\nwith a more efficient and responsive management style.\n\n135. Bifurcation  of  the  Undivided  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh.  Following  the  bifurcation  of\nthe undivided state of MP, the Government issued a provisional order on the bifurcation of the\nassets and liabilities (including employees) of MPEB between MPSEB and CSEB. MPG and the\nChhattisgarh  government  are  requesting  reconsideration  of  the  order.  Further,  MPSEB  has\npending litigation with the CSEB on the revenues collected and retained by the latter between 1\nDecember 2000 and 15 April 2001. Since these two issues could impact on the agreement on\nthe transfer scheme(s), it has been made a third tranche condition and an assurance has been\nincluded in the loan documentation that the Government will take timely steps to resolve these\nissues (para. 149).\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, MPG and MPSEB, have given\n\n136.\nthe following assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n\n1.\n\nGeneral\n\n137.\nThe  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  loan,  as  described  in  the\ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix, will continue to be in effect for at least the duration\nof the SDP.\n\n138.\nThe Government will transfer the counterpart funds generated under the policy loan, and\nthe  loan  proceeds  under  the  investment  loan,  under  normal  arrangements  for  transfer  of\nexternal  assistance  to  MPG  and  shall  treat  such  counterpart  funds  as  an  additionality  to\ntransfers allocated annually to MPG.\n\n139.\nThe  Government  will  cause  MPG  to  ensure  that  sufficient  budgetary  allocations  are\nmade to MPSEB in a timely manner for efficient and timely implementation of the Project and\nthe SDP.\n\n2.\n\nAdministrative\n\n140. MPG  will,  at  all  times,  continue  to  emphasize,  respect,  and  support  the  autonomy  of\nMPSEB with respect to commercial, administrative, and operational activities.\n\nThe Government and MPG will assist in expediting, issue of due permits and licenses for\n\n141.\nthe effective functioning of MPSEB\u2019s successor entities as may be required by law.\n\n\f37\n\n142. MPG and MPSEB will review with ADB the recommendations of the EISP study and other\ntechnical assistance, towards the restructuring of the power sector for its long-term administrative,\nfinancial, and economic viability, for implementation thereof in a manner satisfactory to ADB.\n\n143. Within  15  months  from  the  loan  effectiveness,  MPG  will  ensure  that  the  majority  of  the\nofficers in the senior management of MPPGCL, MPPTCL, and one of the established distribution\ncompanies,  are  recruited  through  open  and  competitive  selection  process  by  the  board  of\ndirectors of the respective companies.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial\n\n144. MPG  will  make  timely  and  adequate  budgetary  appropriations  to  meet  its  subsidy  and\nsubvention payments to ensure that all dues are paid in cash to MPSEB (or its successor entities)\nwithin no more than six months of the raising of the claim by MPSEB or such entities.\n\n145. MPG  will  make  timely  and  adequate  budgetary  appropriations  to  meet  its  rural\nelectrification subsidy/subvention payments based on the MOU between MPG and MPSEB; and\nwill  continue  to  make  timely  and  appropriate  budgetary  appropriations  to  meet  MPSEB\u2019s\nbalance of receivables (excluding past dues until 31 August 2001) from municipalities and other\nlocal and state bodies so as not to exceed the immediately preceding one month\u2019s equivalent of\nsales at any time with effect from 1 January 2002.\n\n4.\n\nSector Reforms\n\n146. MPG  will  ensure  that  MPSEB  or  its  successor  entities  carry  out  proper  metering  of  all\nend  consumers  in  MP,  in  a  phased  manner  for  completion  within  four  years  from  the  date  of\nloan effectiveness of the SDP.\n\n147. MPG will ensure that the power sector reforms under the SDP and the preparation of the\ntransfer  scheme(s)  are  undertaken  with  full  information  and  participation  of  all  stakeholders\nincluding,  but  not  limited  to,  consumers,  utilities,  employees,  and  unions  of  MPSEB,  and\nnongovernment organizations. In doing so, MPG will also ensure that such participation includes\ninformation to the stakeholders, procuring feedback on the same.\n\n148. Recommendations  of  any  employee  transfer  under  the  transfer  scheme(s)  will  be  in  full\nparticipation  and  consultation  of  all  affected,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  laws  and\nregulations of the Government and MPG.\n\n149.\nThe  Government  will  take  timely  steps  in  resolution  of  issues  relating  to  (i) the  final\nallocation  of  assets  and  liabilities  of  MPSEB  and  the  CSEB,  (ii) the  revenue  collected  by  the\nCSEB from 1 December 2000 to 15 April 2001, and (iii) allocation of surplus power from CSEB\nand central sector utilities to MPSEB.\n\n5.\n\nSDP Implementation and Benefit Monitoring\n\nThe  MPG  and  MPSEB  will  undertake  together  with  ADB,  periodic  reviews  during  SDP\n150.\nimplementation  arrangements,  progress,  and\nimplementation, \nachievement  of \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance\nManagement  System  guidelines.

MPG  and  MPSEB  will  allow  all  consumers  living  below  the  poverty  line  to  make  their\npayment  for  electricity  connection  charges,  including  all  up-front  charges  associated  with\nelectricity connections, in 12 monthly installments.\n\n7.\n\nSuccessor Entities\n\n152. Owing  to  the  functional  segregation  of  MPSEB  under  the  SDP,  if  at  any  time  in  the\ninterest  of  proper  implementation  of  the  Project,  ADB,  MPG,  and  MPSEB  find  it  necessary,\nMPSEB will transfer its rights and obligations under the related loan documents to its successor\nentity(ies) as required, with prior approval of and on such terms, conditions, and arrangements\nas  acceptable  to  ADB,  wherefore  such  successor  entity(ies)  as  the  case  may  be,  will  be\ndeemed to be substituted for MPSEB.\n\n8.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n153. Within  four  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness  and  under  its  own  financing,  MPSEB  will\nengage the domestic consultant required to implement component D of the Project.\n\n9.\n\nEnvironmental Compliance and Resettlement Issues\n\n154. MPSEB will establish a fully functional social and environmental management cell within\nfour months of loan effectiveness to the satisfaction of ADB.\n\n155.

MPSEB  will  provide  ADB  with  annual  reports  on  the  monitoring  results,  permits,\nlicenses, and clearances obtained for the Project. In case of any violation of laws and standards\ncited, the report will include certification from the relevant authority that such violation has been\nrectified or an acceptable plan for correction approved.\n\n157. MPG  and  MPSEB  will  ensure  that  in  case  of  any  specific  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement under the Project, the Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan (where there is no\nresettlement)  and  the  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Framework  (where  there  is\nresettlement)  for  the  various  subprojects  as  agreed  upon  with  ADB  are  implemented  and  due\ncompensation is paid to those affected in accordance with ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy\nand ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement (1998) as amended from time to time.\n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\nIn addition to the conditions set forth in the ADB\u2019s ordinary operations loan regulations,\n\n158.\nfollowing are conditions for effectiveness for the SDP loans:\n\n(i)\n\nLegal  opinions  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  have  been  provided  for  the  Loan  and\nProgram Agreements for the policy loan; and the Loan and Project Agreements for\nthe investment loan.\n\n\f(ii)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n39\n\nThe  MP  state  legislature  will  have  passed  supplementary  budget  and  MPG  will\nhave paid MPSEB not less than (a) Rs3,000 million out of total outstanding dues\nas  of  31  March  2001  (approximately  Rs7,423  million  after  deducting  26.62\npercent on account of bifurcation) and (b) total dues between 1 April to 31 August\n2001, owed by municipalities and other local and MPG bodies to MPSEB.\n\nVIII.

In support  of this,  the  State's  approech\nwill  be  to  foster  a  business  environment,  which  will  provide  a  level  playing  fieid  both  for  the\nprivate  and  public  sectors  and  also  by  separating  sector  regulation  from  operations. \nIt  is\nrecognized,  however,  that  to  provide  incentives  for  better  technical  performanCl:1, there  has to  be\ncompetition  and  an  appropriate  enabling  commercial  business  environmEtnt.  As  already\nmentioned  earlier,  Madhya  Pradesh  has  established  the  Madhya  Pradesh  jState  Electriclty\nRegulatory  Commission \nto  make  tariff  setting  and  regulation,  transparent  and  apolitical,  arId has\nmade  metering  compulsorf.

While \n\nif  private  and  foreign  investments  are  to  be  forthcoming \n\nThe  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  recognizes  the  fact  that  there  has  to  be  a  tariff\n10. \nrationalization \nin  the  power  sector.\nUtilities  should  operate  on  commercial  principles  and  earn  adequate  rates  of  return  on  capital\ninvestments.  On  the  other  hand,  grant  of  unrestrained  freedom  to  fix  the  tariff  ~y  power  utilities\n...vill lead to  consumer  interest  being  adversely  affected.  Looking  to  this  Madhya  Pradesh  has  set\nup  an \nthe  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh\nrecognizes,  on  the  one  hand,  the  need  for  the  continuance  of  subsidized  tariff  for  agricultural\nand  socially  obligatory  activities  like  drinking  water  and  street  lighting  and  lighting  for  urban  and\nrural  poor,  on  the  other  hand,  it  also  recognizes  that  these  subsidies  will  have  to  be  explicit,\nquantified, \ncannot  be  fully\neliminated,  it  has  to  be  kept  within  reasonable  limits.  Thus,  the  Reform  Act  provides  a minimum\nrecovery  of  75  percent  of  the  cost  to  seNe  a  category  of  consumers  has  been  mandated.  As  a\nmeasure \ntariffs  and  reverse  the  trand  of\nto  rationalize  electricity \nincreasing  cross-subsidization  of  agriculture  consumers,  rv1 PERC  has  raised  the  effective  tariff\nfor  electricity,  supply  to  the  agriculture  sector  from  Rs  1.00  per  kWh  to  Rs.  1.20  ~er  kVvh with\neffect  from  5'h Oct.  2001.  This  trend  is expected  to  continue  in the  years  ahead.  In addition,  the\nGovernment  of  f'v1adhya Pradesh  has  restricted  the  provision  of free  power  supply  to  single-Jight\npoint  urban  and  rural  consumers  and to  agricultural  consumers  'Nith  purr,ps  up to  5  HP effective\nJanuary  2001.\n\nthat,  while  cross-subsidization \n\nreasonable  and \n\nto  demonstrate \n\ntargeted  and \n\nits  will \n\n\f47\n\nAppendix \n\n21  page  6\n\nE.\n\nPublic  Consultations\n\n11. \nThe  Government  believes  that  pO'Ner sector  reform  requires  concerted  interventions  at\ndifferent  levels  of  the  sector  to  make  the  reforms  a  success.

Due to the lack of poverty statistics in\nconsumer  data  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board  (MPSEB),  the  poverty  profile\n(Tables A6.1 and A6.2) of electricity and nonelectricity users is based on primary household and\nfarm  data  from  a  socioeconomic  survey  carried  out  by  Canadian  International  Development\nAgency  (CIDA)-funded  consultants  during  the  first  half  of  2001.  The  definition  of  poverty  used\nfor households is based on the poverty line applied for provision of food subsidies (\u201cBlue Cards\u201d\nissued by the Madhya Pradesh government [MPG]). Landholding criteria of less than 1 hectare\nhas been used to set the poverty line for farmers. Given the overall poverty profile of Madhya\nPradesh and rural/urban electrification ratios the survey sample appears to be biased in favor of\nusers and nonpoor. Some caution should therefore be used in interpreting connection ratios for\nconsumer  categories.  In  addition  to  the  quantitative  analysis,  qualitative  assessments  were\nmade  to  complement  and  assess  the  survey  findings.  These  are  based  on  participatory  and\nindividual  stakeholder  consultations  in  the  field  carried  out  during  appraisal  of  the  Sector\nDevelopment Program (SDP).\n\n1.\n\nDomestic Users and Non-users\n\nEconometric  analysis  indicates  that  income  is  a  major  determinant  of  households\u2019\n2.\naccess  to  electricity.  Income  levels  are  substantially  more  important  for  the  poor  than  for  the\nnonpoor.  The  location  (rural/urban)  of  the  households  is  also  an  important  determinant  of\naccess for households below the poverty line. The average income of the poor with access is 46\npercent higher than the income of the poor with no access (Table A6.1). Over 36 percent of the\npoor households lack access to electricity while the corresponding figure is less than 17 percent\nfor  nonpoor.  Thus,  when  income  is  a  barrier  to  access  the  current  subsidy  structure  on\nelectricity consumption is inequitable, and would be difficult to defend on the basis of providing\ncheap and affordable services to the poor. Barriers to access for the poor will be discussed in\nparas. 4 to 7.\n\nTable A6.1: Poverty Profile \u2013 Domestic Consumers\n\nPoor Households\n\nNonpoor Households\n\nTotal Households\n\nAccess\n\nElectricity\n\nShare\n63.5%\n\nMean Income\n(Rs/month)\n1,379\n\nNo Electricity\n\n36.5%\n\n942\n\nShare\n87.3%\n\n12.7%\n\nTotal Sample\nPoverty line: Expenditure< Rs 12,000/household/Year.\nSource: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\n\n83.3%\n\n16.7%\n\n1,219\n\n2.\n\nAgricultural Users and Non-users\n\nMean Income\n(Rs/month)\n5,860\n\n1,690\n\n5,332\n\nShare\n83.3%\n\n16.7%\n\n100.0%\n\nMean Income\n(Rs/month)\n5,289\n\n1,426\n\n4,644\n\nAbout  6.6  million  farmers  live  in  the  new  state  of  Madhya  Pradesh.

A  majority  of  the  poor  nonusers  do  not  own  land  but  engage  in  share  cropping2\nand  supplement  farm  income  by  temporary  wage  employment.  Poor  users  own  one  3  or  5\nhorsepower (HP) electric pump. About 30 percent of the poor farmers share capital costs, initial\nconnection  charges,  and  electricity  bills  with  other  farmers.  Sharing  was  not  found  to  be\ncommon  among  nonpoor  farmers  who  tend  to  own  more  than  one  pump  above  5  HP.  All\nnonusers own diesel pumps irrespective of whether they are poor or not. However, the type of\npump  is  a  significant  determinant  of  farm  income  and  profitability.  About  80  percent  of  the\nnonpoor farmers reported that groundwater levels had dropped in the last two years. For poor\nfarmers  the  corresponding  figure  is  87  percent.  While  nonpoor  farmers  reported  that\ngroundwater levels are on average 36 feet, poor farmers are exposed to about 20 percent lower\nwater levels (43 feet). The low capacity irrigation pumps owned by the poor farmers make them\nmore vulnerable to the low water levels.\n\nTable A6.2: Poverty Profile \u2013 Agricultural Consumers\n\nPoor Farmers\n\nNonpoor Farmers\n\nTotal Farmers\n\nAccess\n\nShare\n\nElectricity\n\n80.3%\n\nMean\nIncome\n(Rs/month)\n1,468\n\nMean\nLandholding\n(ha)\n0.68\n\nShare\n\n91.7%\n\nMean\nIncome\n(Rs/month)\n5,028\n\nMean\nLandholding\n(ha)\n5.43\n\nShare\n\n90.0%\n\nMean\nIncome\n(Rs/month)\n4,556\n\nMean\nLandholding\n(ha)\n4.81\n\nNo Electricity\n\n19.7%\n\n1,263\n\n8.3%\n\n2,937\n\n10.0%\n\n2478\n\nTotal Sample\n\n14.9%\n\n1,447\n\n85.1%\n\n4,854\n\n100%\n\n4,348\n\n0.67\n\n0.68\n\n4.14\n\n5.33\n\n3.13\n\n4.64\n\nha = hectare.\nPoverty line: Marginal farmers with less than 1 hectare in landholdings.\nSource: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\n\nB. \n\nBarriers to Access\n\nFour  main  barriers  for  the  poor  to  access  electricity  services  were  identified  during  the\n4.\nparticipatory  stakeholder  consultations  with  the  poor.  First,  insufficient  new  investments  to\nextend grid-connections to poor rural areas. Second, in areas where the grid exists, connection\ncosts, associated transaction costs (including waiting time and number of applications) and up-\nfront  charges  are  major  barriers  for  the  poor  to  connect.  Third,  business  practices  of  property\nrights  have  excluded  a  large  share  of  urban  and  rural  poor  since  they  could  not  produce  the\nnecessary  land  titles  required  to  obtain  official  connections.  However,  this  policy  has  recently\nbeen changed. The fourth is related to the poor quality of electricity supply and load-shedding,\nwhich  acts  to  deter  connections  since  cost  savings  and  other  benefits  will  be  limited.  Load-\nshedding will further be discussed in paras. 8 to 10\n\n5.\nThe  socioeconomic  survey  included  questions  to  examine  issues  related  to  access  to\nelectricity.  Table  A6.3  presents  the  responses  from  nonusers.  Forty-six  percent  stated  they\nwould not be able to afford electricity. Affordability is consistently perceived to be higher for the\npoor than the nonpoor. Nearly 60 percent of the poor stated that they would be able to pay while\nthis  was  only  48  percent  for  the  nonpoor.  The  perception  of  affordability  is  related  to  the\nwillingness to pay, which also is higher for the poor than for the nonpoor (Table A6.9). Quality of\nhousing is perceived to be a problem for both poor and nonpoor. Econometric analysis confirms\nthis conclusion and results indicate that a house made of thatch is 13 percent less likely to have\nelectricity.\n\n6.\nA  substantial  number  of  nonusers  reported  that  they  have  applied  for  but  not  received\nconnections. This may indicate the presence of transaction costs associated with connections.\n\n                                                          \n2 The landowner will share input costs in exchange for a share in crop output.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\nSome  respondents  stated  that  they  did  not  need  electricity.  Surprisingly,  this  response  was\nhigher among the rural nonpoor than among the poor.\n\nTable A6.3: Perceived Reasons for Not Having Electricity (Domestic)\n\nRural\n\nUrban\n\nReason\n\nNo connections nearby\nApplied but waiting\nCannot afford\nHouse not appropriate for wiring\nDo not need/want it\nPoverty line: Expenditure< Rs 12,000/household/Year.\nSource: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\n\nPoor\n44.7%\n31.6%\n39.5%\n26.3%\n5.3%\n\nNonpoor\n37.8%\n18.9%\n53.7%\n29.7%\n16.2%\n\nPoor\n32.1%\n50.0%\n38.9%\n21.4%\n14.3%\n\nNonpoor\n27.5%\n47.5%\n40.0%\n15.0%\n12.5%\n\nTotal\n\n36.1%\n32.8%\n45.6%\n24.4%\n12.8%\n\n7.\nOn  average,  users  spend  5  percent  of  their  income  on  electricity.  As  expected  the\nexpenditure  share  is  higher  for  the  poor  (8  percent)  than  for  the  nonpoor  (3  percent)3.\nConsultations  with  nonusers  show  that  kerosene  expenditure  shares  vary  between  7  and  15\npercent of household income. Since kerosene is mainly used for lighting purposes expenditure\nsavings from electricity are quite substantial.4\n\nC. \n\nLoad-Shedding and Quality of Supply\n\n8.\nThe  prevalence  of  load-shedding  causes  consumers  to  diversify  their  energy  sources,\nwhere kerosene is the main substitute for electricity. Over 90 percent of electricity users in rural\nareas  reported  that  they  also  use  kerosene  for  lighting.  In  urban  areas,  load-shedding  is  less\nfrequent, and thus, the use of kerosene by electricity users is less common (Table A6.4). Forced\ndiversification  of  energy  sources  incurs  additional  costs  and  reduces  benefits  of  electricity.\nUltimately,  load-shedding  affects  the  willingness  to  pay  for  electricity.  Where  consumers  are\ncharged on a flat rate basis, load-shedding leads to a higher per unit cost and reduces the net\nbenefits per unit consumed. This reinforces the adverse effects of load-shedding on consumer\u2019s\nwillingness to pay for electricity.\n\nLoad-shedding  in  rural  areas  is  nearly  six  times  more  frequent  than  in  urban  areas\n9.\n(Table A6.4).  Scheduled load-shedding is announced to consumers in advance of the season\nto  allow  consumers  to  adjust  and  plan  for  it.  Still,  scheduled  load-shedding  disrupts  activities,\nincreases  loss  of  income,  and  increases  costs.  However,  the  unscheduled  load-shedding\ncauses the most serious problems for consumers as it increases uncertainty in production and\nconsumption activities and does not allow consumer to adjust activities in advance. Between 10\nto 15 percent of total load-shedding and 62 percent of the number of power cuts in rural areas\nare unscheduled (Table A6.4).\n\nTable A6.4: Distribution of Load-shedding by Area\nRural\n\nSemi-urban\nScheduled Unscheduled Total Scheduled Unscheduled Total Scheduled Unscheduled Total\n\nUrban\n\n270\n270\n\n30\n\n30.45\n50.4\n\n300.5\n320.4\n\n48\n\n78\n\n120\n120\n\n30\n\n30\n35\n\n4\n\n150\n155\n\n34\n\n45\n45\n\n30\n\n3\n7\n\n4\n\n48\n52\n\n34\n\nItem\n\nMin.

The  poor  quality  of  supply  appears  to  affect  poor  and\nnonpoor  equally  (Table  A6.5).  However,  the  consequences  of  power  cuts  and  voltage\nfluctuations tend to be more serious for the poor. Over 60 percent of the farmers reported pump\nburnouts  as  a  result  of  voltage  fluctuations  (Table  A6.6).  Nearly  20  percent  experience  more\nthan  one  burnout  during  Rabbi  season.  Poor  farmers  are  more  vulnerable  to  pump  burnouts\nbecause  they  do  not  have  the  same  adjustment  and  coping  capabilities  as  nonpoor  farmers.\nThey  seldom  own  more  than  one  pump  and  the  loss  in  crop  production  can  be  devastating.\nVoltage fluctuations in power supply also have a bearing on the maintenance cost of pumps.\n\nTable A6.5: Quality of Supply\n\nPoor\n\nNonpoor\n\nTotal\n\nDomestic\n67.8%\n47.8%\n55.7%\n\nItem\nPower Cutsa\nVoltage Variations\nVoltage Drop\nMean hrs of Power\nSupply / Day\na Unscheduled power cuts for farmers.\nSource: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\n\nFarmer\n82.5%\n65.7%\n\n6.3\n\nDomestic\n56.1%\n44.1%\n52.5%\n\nFarmer\n84.0%\n71.2%\n\n7.0\n\nDomestic\n57.6%\n44.6%\n52.9%\n\nFarmer\n83.8%\n70.5%\n\nTable A6.6:  Effects of Voltage Fluctuations\n\nNo. of Pump Burn Outs\n\n1\n2\nMore than 2\nTotal\n\nPoor\nShare\n39.6%\n8.2%\n7.0%\n54.8%\n\nNonpoor\nShare\n44.5%\n14.8%\n3.4%\n62.7%\n\nTotal\nShare\n43.0%\n14.3%\n4.1%\n61.4%\n\n       Source: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\n\nD. \n\nImpacts of Reforms\n\n1.\n\nConnections for the Poor\n\nThe new MPSEB policy includes applying connection charges retroactively. The MPSEB\n11.\nconsumer  base  data  indicate  that  the  introduction  of  connection  charges  has  resulted  in  a\nreduction  of  single  point  consumers.  This  can  partially  be  explained  by  an  increase  in  other\nconsumer  groups.  However,  consultations  with  the  poor  and  MPSEB  staff  show  that  poor\nconsumers have been disconnected as a result of inability to pay up-front connection charges.\nThis may have resulted in an increase of illegal connections and thus, a consequent reduction in\nrevenue  for  MPSEB.  Under  the  current  policy,  scheduled  caste  and  tribe  consumers  living\nbelow the poverty line are eligible for the single point scheme for which the connection charge is\namortized  (interest-free)  in  four  monthly  installments.  However,  this  policy  does  not  apply  to\nother  consumers  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Consultations  with  poor  \u2018illegal\u2019  consumers\nshowed  that  these  consumers  are  not  eligible  for  the  single  point  scheme  and  up-front  costs\nassociated with various charges, such as meter charges, service connection charges, etc, are\ntoo  high  for  them  to  afford  in  one  monthly  installment.  On  the  basis  of  the  consumers  self-\nassessment  and  on  their  level  of  income,  MPSEB  will  introduce  an  interest-free  12  month\ninstallment facility to address the ability of the poor to pay up-front charges.\n\n2.\n\nMetering of the Poor\n\n12.\nAs  part  of  the  loss  reduction  program,  MPSEB  has  introduced  mandatory  metering  of\nconsumers.  The  metering  policy  has  been  found  to  be  beneficial  for  poor  and  low-income\nconsumers as opposed to the flat rate tariff currently charged. A poor urban consumer who has\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 6, page 5\n\ntwo  light  bulbs  and  a  fan  is  billed  Rs115  per  month  on  a  flat  rate  basis.  With  metering,  the\ncorresponding bill on a per unit basis would amount to Rs87 per month, or 24 percent less.5\n\n13.\nLoad-shedding combined with flat rate tariffs is regressive in the sense that consumers\nexperiencing  more  load-shedding  are  paying  a  higher  unit  rate  than  consumers  experiencing\nless. Over 50 percent of domestic poor consumers and 84 percent of the poor farmers are not\nmetered  (Tables  A6.7  and  A6.8).  In  addition,  of  the  ones  who  do  have  meters,  few  receive\nregular readings. Thus, when load-shedding increases, bills are not adjusted.\n\nTable A6.7: Metering of Domestic Consumers\n\nRural\n\nUrban\n\nPoor\n43.5%\n94.2%\n7.2%\n\nNonpoor\n65.0\n87%\n21.4%\n\nPoor\n56.5%\n99.7%\n43.5%\n\nNonpoor\n82.7%\n96.1%\n58.2%\n\nTotal\n\n80.6%\n96.4%\n57.0%\n\nItem\n\nMetered\nMeter is Working\nMeter  is  Read  on  a  Regular\nBasis\nBilled According to Meter\n\n18.1%\n      Source: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\n\n13.0%\n\n45.7%\n\n54.7%\n\n54.0%\n\nTable A6.8: Metering of Agricultural Consumers\n\nItem\n\nMetered\nMeter is Read on a Regular Basis\n\nRural\n\nPoor\n16.2%\n54.2%\n\nNonpoor\n13.0%\n34.7%\n\nTotal\n\n13.4%\n37.8%\n\n          Source: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\n\n3.\n\nWillingness to Pay\n\nOver  60  percent  of  agricultural  consumers  are  willing  to  pay  more  for  better  quality\n14.\nsupply. Poor farmers are particularly willing to pay more if services improve (65.4 percent). The\nwillingness  to  pay  more  is  also  higher  for  the  poor  than  for  the  nonpoor.  Similar  results  are\nfound  for  domestic  consumers.  Sixty-seven  percent  of  domestic  consumers  are  willing  to  pay\nmore,  as  are  nearly  75  percent  of  the  poor,  and  66  percent  of  the  nonpoor.  The  poor  are  on\naverage willing to pay 27 percent more than their current bill for better quality supply, while the\ncorresponding figure is 23 percent for the nonpoor (Table A6.9).\n\nTable A6.9: Willingness to Pay More\n\nVariable\n\nMean WTPM\n\nPoor\n27.3%\n\nDomestic\nNonpoor\n22.7%\n\nAll\n23.2%\n\nPoor\n23.8%\n\nAgriculture\nNonpoor\n22.9%\n\nAll\n23.0%\n\n    Source: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey\n\n15.\nThe willingness to pay for better quality service is governed by a number of factors, such\nas  the  costs  and  loss  in  income  that  occurs  as  a  result  of  voltage  fluctuations  and  load-\nshedding.  Econometric  simulations  (Table  A6.10)  show  that  metering  followed  by  income  are\nthe  most  important  factors  influencing  the  willingness  to  pay  for  domestic  consumers.  Urban\nconsumers  are  willing  to  pay  more  than  rural  consumers,  even  when  controlling  for  income\ndifferences. For agricultural consumers groundwater levels and voltage variations are the most\nimportant  factors  while  metering  is  not  significant.  For  poor  farmers,  these  factors  are  of\nparticular  importance.  Groundwater  levels  are  directly  related  to  electricity  consumption  for\nirrigation purposes. Low capacity pumps in combination with low groundwater levels affect the\nability to irrigate. In addition, flat rate charges induce inefficient utilization of both electricity and\nwater. While nonpoor farmers invest in higher HP pumps, this option is not economically viable\n                                                          \n5 The light bulbs are assumed each to be used for 8 hours a day and the fan for 15 hours.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 6, page 6\n\nfor poor farmers and thus the distribution of water resources is directly effected by the ability to\neffectively  utilize  electricity  for  irrigation  purposes.  Thus,  flat  rate  charges  cause  inefficient\nutilization and unequitable distribution of both electricity and water resources. The latter effect is\nreinforced by the fact that poor farmers tend to live in more drought-prone areas.\n\nTable A6.10: Willingness to Pay (dependent variable)\n\nDomestic\n\nAgriculture\n\nVariable\n\nIncome\n\nMetering\n\nFrequency of Meter\nReading\nFrequency of Power Cutsa\n\nFrequency of Voltage\nFluctuations\nGroundwater (feet)\n\nRural/Urban\n\nPoor\n0.142\n(4.11)\n0.498\n(2.43)\n0.079\n(1.99)\n-0.110\n(-2.73)\n-0.082\n(-2.67)\n\n-0.154\n(-2.69)\n\nNonpoor\n0.390\n(11.59)\n0.372\n(5.66)\n0.04\n(1.22)\n-0.035\n(2.62)\n-0.107\n(-2.069)\n\n-0.197\n(-4.28)\n\n*t - statistics in parenthesis\na Power cuts for farmers include unscheduled only.\nSource: Estimations are based on the socioeconomic survey data.\n\nPoor\n0.132\n(1.98)\n0.03\n(1.23)\n0.143\n(1.73)\n-0.069\n(2.23)\n-0.19\n(-2.00)\n0.30\n(1.98)\n\nNonpoor\n0.068\n(2.83)\n0.03\n(1.46)\n0.112\n(1.92)\n-0.074\n(-2.76)\n-0.123\n(-2.60)\n0.23\n(4.24)\n\n16.\nThe  results  show  that  load-shedding  is  an  important  factor  but  less  so  than  voltage\nfluctuations.  This  is  because  voltage  fluctuations  reduce  farm  profitability  by  reducing  crop\nyields  and  by  increasing  pump  maintenance  costs.  The  econometric  simulations  indicate  that\nthe reduction in farm profitability due to voltage fluctuations is likely to be higher than the loss of\nincome that occurs as a result of load-shedding. The results show that the effects of the poor\nquality of supply and services affect poor farmers more than the nonpoor. Overall, eighty-eight\npercent  of  the  farmers  expect  increased  yields  as  a  result  of  improved  quality  of  supply;  50\npercent expect at least a 20 percent increase in yields.\n\nThe  econometric  results  in  Table  A6.10  show  that  the  impacts  of  the  various\n17.\ninterventions  of  improving  the  quality  of  services  vary  between  different  consumer  categories.\nWhile the number of poor connected to the grid might be relatively small, the results show that\nthe magnitude of the direct impacts of reduced voltage fluctuations are especially pro-poor. For\ndomestic consumers, a meter-based tariff, followed by reduced load-shedding, was found to be\nthe  most  pro-poor  intervention.  The  importance  of  voltage  fluctuations  was  less  for  poor\ndomestic consumers due to the limited ownership of appliances.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\n18.\nThe  current  state  of  electricity  supply  and  operations  has  serious  adverse  impacts  on\nincome earning activities for the poor. They are affected both indirectly, through reduced wage\nemployment  opportunities6  and  directly,  through  reduced  farm  profitability  and  household\nwelfare. The restructuring process provides an opportunity for MPSEB to review its operations\nand the impacts on consumers. For the state government, it provides an opportunity to assess\nthe  impacts  of  its  subsidy  policy  and  other  interventions  in  the  electricity  sector.  Given  the\nsignificant barriers for the poor to access electricity, it is difficult to defend the current subsidy\nstructure  on  the  basis  of  providing  cheap  services  to  the  poor.  Most  of  the  poor  do  not  have\nelectricity  connections  and  are  not  benefiting  from  subsidized  electricity  tariffs.  However,  they\n\n                                                          \n6 This particularly affects the landless and the poorest of the poor.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 6, page 7\n\nare  indirectly  paying  in  terms  of  forgone  investments  and  are  directly  affected  by  the  lack  of\nfinancial ability of MPSEB to expand the network into poorer areas.\n\n19.\nThe  lack  of  reforms  would  have  a  disastrous  effect  on  farmers\u2019  ability  to  cope  with  the\npoor quality of supply in combination with low groundwater levels. This would particularly affect\nthe poor who are less able to cope with the uncertainty that unscheduled load-shedding brings.\nAbsence of tariff reform would be expected to continue draining the state government budget,\nand thus, increase the opportunity costs in terms of investing in other sectors more beneficial for\npoverty reduction.\n\n20. While  tariff  restructuring  is  necessary  to  improve  the  quality  of  supply,  the  impacts  of\nsuch  increases  on  the  poor  are  significantly  reduced  by  introducing  meter-based  tariffs.  In\naddition, the improved quality of supply would lead to decreased expenditure on kerosene. The\nwillingness to pay higher tariffs, especially by the poor, reflects high adjustment and opportunity\ncosts of the poor quality of electricity supply. Further reducing the ability of MPSEB to maintain\nnetwork  systems  would  result  in  increased  unscheduled  load-shedding  and  uncertainty  for\nconsumers and reduced benefits of electrification. Tariffs set below the cost of supply, without\ncompensation  from  the  state  government,  reduces  the  ability  of  MPSEB  to  purchase  bulk\npower.  Every  sold  unit  is  a  loss  and  thus,  load-shedding  under  the  current  tariff  regime  is\nfinancially beneficial for MPSEB while adversely affecting consumers.\n\n\fMatrix 1: Structural

Project).  The  SDP  seeks  to  establish  appropriate  policy  and  institutional\nenvironment  to  improve  the  governance  of  the  power  sector  in  Madhya  Pradesh  (MP)  .  The\nProject consists of (i) subtransmission and distribution system strengthening (component A); (ii)\nconversion  of  low  voltage  lines  to  110  kilovolt  (kV)  (component  B),  (iii)  transmission  system\nstrengthening  (component  C),  and  (vi) setting  up  of  a  computerized  information  and  revenue\nmanagement  system  (component D).  A  description  of  the  Project  is  given  in  para.  71  and\nSupplementary Appendix C.\n\n2.\nThe  SDP  is  classified  as  Category  B  due  to  the  limited  impacts  of  the  Program  and\ncomponents A, B, and C of the Project. The Program\u2019s potential environmental impact, and in\nparticular of the MP Reform Act, was evaluated and an impact analysis prepared, showing that\nInitial\nmost  potential  environmental \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  conducted  by  MPSEB  for  components  A  and  C.\nConsultations were held with related agencies, and interviews were carried out with farmers and\nother stakeholders. This summary IEE presents the major findings of the IEEs and discussions\nwith  concerned  government  officials.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  summary  IEE,  an\nenvironmental impact assessment is not required for the components.\n\nimpacts  are  considered  beneficial  (Table  A7.1). \n\nThis report describes the existing environment in the area where the components are to\n3.\nbe implemented; the likely environmental impacts of the components; and the various measures\nthat  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board  (MPSEB)  during  the\ndesign,  construction,  and  maintenance  stages  to  mitigate  any  potential  significant  adverse\nenvironmental  impacts.  Some  of  the  measures  such  as  the  selection  and  survey  of  the\nalignment for the transmission lines have already been started by MPSEB.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n4.\nThe proposed transmission system of component C will pass through the whole state of\nMP.  Component  A  will  upgrade  and  expand  the  existing  substation  capacity  and  distribution\nlines in Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, Khargone, Mandsaur, and Ujjain.\n\n5.\nMP is located in the center of India and is one of the biggest state in the country. Except\nfor the valley of the Narmada and Tapti, MP consists of a plateau with mean elevation of about\n500  meters  above  sea  level,  interspersed  with  mountains  of  the  Vindhya  and  the  Satpura\nranges. The main river systems are the Betwa, Chambal, Indravati, Mahanadi, Narmada, Sindh,\nand Tapti. The area is part of a peninsular plateau consisting of sedimentary and metamorphic\nrocks,  and  is  structurally  part  of  the  peninsular  block.  The  area  is  geologically  stable  and  not\nprone to earthquakes.\n\n6.\nThe  MP  climate  is  extreme  in  the  north,  temperate  and  breezy  in  the  plateau,  and\ngenerally hot and humid in the eastern and southern plains. Summer is hot, with temperatures\nranging  from  22oC  to  48oC,  while  winter  is  mild,  with  temperatures  ranging  from  4oC  to  23oC.\nThe low-lying area of Baghelkhand and Gwalior plains have lighter soil; and the Narmada valley\nis formed by deep rich alluvial deposits.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\nAbout  35  percent  (154,497  square  kilometer  [km2])  of  the  total  geographical  area\n7.\n(443,496  km2)  is  under  forest  cover.  The  forest  cover  consists  of  82,700  km2  (54  percent)  of\nreserve forest and 66,678 km2 (43 percent) of protected forest, with the rest, about 5,119 km2 (3\npercent),  classified  as  other  forest.1  There  are  9  national  parks  and  22  wildlife  sanctuaries  in\nMadhya  Pradesh.  In  the  subproject  areas,  the  notable  wildlife  species  are  jackal,  fox,  and\nmonkey. No endangered or rare species of flora or fauna are reported in the subproject areas.\n\nC.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts Due to Project Location and Design\n\n8.\nPotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  transmission  lines  and\nsubstations  can  be  avoided  or  minimized  through  careful  route  and  site  selection.  Preliminary\nsite  selection  was  done  based  on  the  topographic  sheets  of  the  Survey  of  India  and  Forest\nAtlas2.  For  the  selection  of  the  optimum  route  or  substation  site,  consideration  was  given  to\nensure  that  the  route:  (i)  minimizes  human  resettlements;  (ii)  does  not  affect  monuments  of\ncultural or historical importance; (iii) does not create a threat to the survival of any community\nwith  special  reference  to  tribal  communities;  (iv)  does  not  affect  any  public  utility  services  like\nplaygrounds  or  schools;  (v)  does  not  pass  through  any  sanctuaries,  national  park,  etc;  and,\n(vi) minimizes damage to existing forest resources.\n\n9.\nAs a rule, alignments are sited 10-15 km away from major towns, whenever possible, to\naccount for future urban expansion. Similarly, forests are avoided whenever possible. When not\npossible,  a  route  that  will  minimize  damage  to  the  existing  forest  resources  is  selected  in\nconsultation  with  the  local  divisional  forest  officer.  Alignments  in  the  subprojects  avoided\nwetlands and unstable areas. MPSEB undertook the route selection for individual transmission\nlines  in  close  consultation  with  representatives  from  the  State  Forest  Department.  Alternative\nalignments were considered to ensure that disruptions to environmentally sensitive areas would\nbe  minimal.  Clearances  from  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  (MOEF)  are  being\nprocessed for the use of 3.78 hectares of forestland for the right-of-way (ROW) of transmission\nlines. Land values are not expected to be affected, as the selected line route generally passes\nthrough uninhabited areas, cultivated lands, and forests.\n\n2.\n\nEnvironmental Effects Related to Construction\n\nUnder  component  C,  only  two  transmission  lines  will  pass  through  forested  areas  in\n10.\nMandsaur  (1.0  km,  2.7  hectares  in  Gunjaliya  Protected  Forest,)  and  Indore  (0.4  km,  1.08\nhectares  in  Main  Vindhya  Reserved  Forest).  This  could  not  be  avoided  due  the  presence  of\ntowns  and  villages  and  vast  area  of  forestland  in  the  two  districts.  However,  no  endangered,\nthreatened,  or  rare  species  of  fauna  and  flora  are  recorded  in  the  forest  affected  by  the\ntransmission line route. Divisional forest officers of the State Forest Department and executive\nengineer Extra High Tension (Construction and Maintenance) of MPSEB have prepared a joint\n\n                                                \n1 The Indian Forest Act, 1927 regulates the classification and declaration of different categories of forests. The state\ngovernment  may  constitute  any  forestland  or  wasteland,  which  is  the  property  of  Government  or  over  which  the\nGovernment has proprietary rights, or to the whole or any part of the forest-produce of which the Government is\nentitled, a reserved forest or protected forest in the manner provided in the act. A reserved forest usually has good\nquality  of  woods,  and  the  right  of  people  in  it  is  very  limited  until  a  clearance  is  obtained.  A  protected  forest  is\nusually  near  villages  or  human  settlement  where  people  are  entitled  to  the  existing  forest  activities,  such  as\nfuelwood collection and grazing. Clearance procedures for development activities in both forests are the same.\n\n2  Government of India. Survey of India, Forest Atlas. Delhi.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\ninvestigation report for each of the two forest areas where the two transmission line will pass.\nThe two reports conclude that the forest that will be affected is either degraded Grade IV forest\nas in the case of Gunjaliya Protected Forest, or without trees standing on the ground as in that\nof Main Vindhya Reserve Forest. MPSEB has obtained the first stage clearance from MOEF for\nusing  the  land  of  Gunjaliya  Protected  Forest  for  ROW.  Clearance  for  Main  Vindhya  Reserved\nForest is being processed. With provision for compensatory forestry, the overall forest condition\nwill improve.\n\nTo mitigate losses to existing forests, clearing of the transmission line ROW will be done\n11.\nunder the supervision of the Forest Department, and low canopy seed trees and shrubs will be\nkept intact if they do not interfere with tower erection and line installation. The wood will be sold\nby  the  Forest  Department,  which  will  retain  the  proceeds  from  the  sale.  MPSEB  will  provide\nconstruction  crews  with  fuelwood  or  alternative  fuels  as  a  precaution  against  collection  of\nfuelwood  from  the  nearby  forest.  Local  forest  department  personnel  will  assess  the  risk  of\npoaching during construction and take appropriate action. Guard stations will be established, as\nneeded, at the entrance to forested areas. Since the affected forest is mostly revenue forest and\nis currently accessible, this impact may not be significant. Nonetheless, MPSEB staff will report\nto the Forest Department any noticeable encroachment resulting from the Project.\n\n12.\nMost  of  the  route  will  pass  through  agricultural  lands  or  wasteland.  According  to  the\nElectricity (Supply) Act, 1948, no land acquisition is required for placing transmission towers on\nprivate  land.  However,  any  damage  will  be  duly  compensated.  Associated  impacts  on\nagricultural  land  will  be  restricted  to  the  construction  phase  and  will  be  temporary  in  nature.\nAgricultural  land  will  be  lost  permanently  at  the  base  of  the  transmission  tower,  estimated  at\n0.2\u20131.0 square meters per average farm holding. After construction, agricultural land within the\ntransmission line corridors can be used again for farming purposes.\n\n3.\n\nEnvironmental Effects During Operation\n\n13.\nThree-meter wide strips of land under each conductor will be cleared and maintained as\nmaintenance  ROWs.  Lopping  of  trees  will  be  carried  out  with  the  assistance  of  the  Forest\nDepartment to ensure that the required clearances are maintained throughout the stretch of the\ntransmission lines. This will reduce the chances of forest fires due to electric sparks.\n\n14.\nTo  minimize  the  risk  of  accidents  and  exposure  to  electric  fields,  houses  will  not  be\nallowed within the ROW and under the 220 kV and 132 kV double circuit lines. Disturbed areas\nduring the construction of transmission towers will be rehabilitated to minimize soil erosion.\n\n15.\nMPSEB has discontinued procurement of poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) transformer\noil since 1974. Pure hydrocarbon mineral oil has been used since then. New transformers and\ncapacitors to be purchased under the Project will not have any adverse environmental impacts.\nNone of the transformers to be replaced will be disposed of. Instead, they will be used in other\nsubstations  where  loads  are  less.  Used  transformer  oil  will  be  collected  and  reclaimed  by\ncontractors through the Office of Stores and Purchase. Scrap will be collected and disposed of\nin  compliance  with  the  Environmental  Protection  Act,  1986,  and  applicable  regulations  and\nrules.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 7, page 4\n\nD.\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n16.\nFor  component  C,  the  EHT  construction  circles  and  divisions  are  responsible  for\nimplementation and supervision of the construction of new transmission lines and substations.\nThese divisions will ensure that the Project will comply with best environmental and engineering\npractices  during \nline  maintenance  and  substation\nmaintenance  circle  and  divisions  are  responsible  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  new\ntransmission lines and substations.\n\nthe  construction  phase.  The  EHT \n\n17.\nMonitoring  activities  include  patrolling  and  thermo  vision  scanning.  Monthly  preventive\nmaintenance will be carried out to identify and resolve problems related to cooling oil, gaskets,\ncircuit  breakers,  vibration  measurements,  and  other  activities.  Monitoring  results  will  be\npublished monthly, including a report on the corrective actions taken.\n\n18.\nAs  part  of  the  normal  duties  of  the  concerned  divisional  forest  officer  and  staff,\nmonitoring  of  impacts  on  ecological  resources  will  be  carried  out.  Monitoring  of  compensatory\nforests  will  be  established  in  coordination  with  the  Forest  Department,  and  MPSEB  will\nundertake  environmental  monitoring  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  and\nsocial regulations and rules.\n\nFor component A, a field level monitoring committee will be looking after the construction\n19.\nwork, operation, and maintenance of the subtransmission and distribution system; and ensure\nthat the management of any scrap will comply with the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, and\nother applicable regulations and rules.\n\nIn  addition,  MPSEB  will  establish  a \n\n20.\nfunctional  social  and  environmental\nmanagement  cell  within  four  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  new  cell  will  include  an\nenvironmental management and monitoring section to ensure that the Project is undertaken and\nall project facilities operated and maintained in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and\nregulations.\n\nfully \n\nE.\n\nConclusions\n\n21.\nBased  on  the  environmental  assessment  and  surveys  conducted  for  the  subprojects,\nassociated potential adverse environmental impacts can be mitigated to an acceptable level by\nadequate implementation of the measures as stated in the IEEs. Although part of the affected\narea for the alignment of the transmission lines is forested, it is mainly lower grade forest, and\nno  endangered,  rare,  or  threatened  species  of  flora  or  fauna  are  recorded.  Nevertheless,\ncompensatory forestry will be strictly implemented in coordination with the Forest Department.\nAdequate provisions have been made in the Project to cover the environmental mitigation and\nmonitoring requirements, and their associated costs.\n\n22.\nThe Project will strengthen the establishment of the State Power Transmission System\nof  the  MP.  Overall,  the  social  and  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  two  subprojects\nare  limited  to  the  construction  period  and  can  be  mitigated  to  an  acceptable  level  by\nimplementation  of  recommended  measures  and  by  best  engineering  and  environmental\npractices.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 7, page 5\n\nTable 7.1: Evaluation of the Madhya Pradesh Power Reform Act, 2001\n\n           for Potential Environmental Impacts\n\nPolicy/Institutional change\n\nRemarks\n\nPotential\nEnvironmental\nImpacta\n+\n\nSet up regulatory authority (MPSERC) with\nindependence ensured by specifying\nprofessional qualifications of members,\nprohibition of members from concurrently or\nsubsequently holding government office, and\nsafeguards against conflict of interest\n\n Functions of MPSERC include tariff setting,\nensuring quality of service, efficiency, safety,\nperspective planning, promoting competition,\nadjudicating or facilitating dispute resolution,\ncoordination with environmental regulatory\nauthorities and evolve policies/procedures for\nenvironmental regulation of the electricity\nindustry, standard setting, ensuring data and\ninformation collection, and others.\n\nMPSERC to function as a quasi-judicial\nauthority, following the civil procedure code.\n\nState government\u2019s powers restricted to\nproviding policy directions in writing confined\nto overall planning/coordination for\ndevelopment of the electricity industry, but\nnot in relation to tariff setting or licensing.\nDisputes between state government and\nMPSERC to be subject to binding, time\nbound adjudication by the Central Electricity\nRegulatory Commission (CERC).\n\nLicensing of transmission and supply:\npublic participation (PP) requirement before\nissue of license for each \u201cproject.\u201d\n\nRequirement of economical power purchase,\nincluding least-cost dispatch principle.\n\nNo exclusivity in grant of license.\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n?\n\n+\n\nAn independent regulatory authority is assumed\nto be able to withstand political pressure on\ntariff setting and other regulatory functions,\nthereby enabling cost recovery, which in turn\nwould give appropriate price signals for energy\nconservation.\n\nThe functions of MPSERC encompass those\nnecessary for setting up a competitive supply\nside for the electricity industry, planning to\nensure least-cost supply over the long-run, cost\nrecovery through tariff policies, safety, and\nstrengthened environmental regulation. These\nwill contribute to energy efficiency on supply\nand demand sides, appropriate fuel mix, and\nproper environmental management.\n\nQuasi-judicial procedures, including the passing\nof appellable speaking orders (findings) will\nenhance transparency, thereby strengthening\nindependence of the authority from political\npressures.\n\nClear demarcation of roles of state government\nand MPSERC is conducive to independent tariff\nsetting and licensing, the latter facilitating\ncompetitive supply.

Thereafter, it is assumed that tariff will be revised at the beginning of each\nyear.  Among  low  tension  (LT)  consumers,  domestic,  waterworks,  agriculture,  and  street  light\nconsumers are currently charged below the cost of supply. A tariff increase above inflation rate\nis  assumed  for  these  consumers  until  full  cost  recovery  is  ensured.  However,  for  agricultural\nconsumers, 75 percent cost recovery would be achieved in FY2010 under the base case and in\nFY2007  for  the  upside  scenario.  Since  most  of  high  tension  (HT)  consumers  are  already\ncharged more than the cost of supply, a modest increase is projected except for waterworks and\ntwo minor bulk consumers (rural electrification cooperatives and border villages). Particularly for\nindustrial  and  commercial  consumers  that  have  the  option  to  switch  to  captive  generation,  no\ntariff increase is envisaged once the tariffs reach a breakeven point with cost of captive power\n(approximately  Rs5.00/kWh).  Under  the  base  case  scenario,  full  recovery  of  cost  will  be\nachieved  by  FY2009.  Projected  electricity  tariffs  net  of  electricity  duty  and  sales  tax  are\npresented in Table A8.2.\n\nTable A8.2: Projected Average Cost of power and Consumer-wise Tariff\n(Rs/kWh, excluding electricity duties and sales taxes)\n\nItem\n\nFY2001 FY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009 FY2010\n\nA.

Due to the\nsluggish  local  economy,  only  marginal  demand  growth  is  expected  for  HT  consumers.  The\nsharp  decrease  in  FY2001  for  LT  consumers  is  due  to  reassessment  of  agricultural\nconsumption.  Consumption  by  LT  consumers  is  expected  to  show  a  big  increase  in  FY2002\nbecause  of  legalization  of  illegally  connected  agricultural  consumers.  Otherwise,  demand\ngrowth corresponding to overall economic growth of the state is envisaged for LT consumers. In\nthe projection, due to limited power purchase capability, power cuts between 5 to 20 percent are\nenvisaged for the first three years except for railways, coal mines, and waterworks.\n\nTable A8.3: Unrestricted Consumption Growth (%)\n\nItem\nLT Consumers\nHT Consumers\n   Total\nSource: MPSEB, Staff estimates.\n\n0.1%\n\nFY2001 FY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009 FY2010\n5.6%\n-36.0% 20.3%\n5.6%\n0.6%\n5.6%\n-25.8% 12.8%\n\n5.6%\n5.6%\n5.6%\n\n5.5%\n5.3%\n5.4%\n\n5.2%\n5.2%\n5.2%\n\n5.1%\n4.5%\n4.9%\n\n5.1%\n4.3%\n4.8%\n\n4.7%\n3.6%\n4.4%\n\n4.7%\n1.5%\n3.6%\n\nEfficiency  gains  are  to  be  realized  by  reducing  of  transmission  and  distribution  losses\n4. \nand improving collection efficiency.

Impact  of  tax  payment  is  not  considered  for\ncalculation  of  benefit  and  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  since  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State\nElectricity  Board  (MPSEB)  will  not  be  in  a  position  to  pay  income  taxes.  All  prices  are  in\nconstant September 2001 value. Foreign exchange rate is assumed at Rs47.00 to $1.00.\n\nThe capital cost of each subproject and its disbursement schedule were reviewed during\n\n3. \nthe Appraisal mission. Physical contingency is assumed at 10 percent of the base cost.\n\nMPSEB\u2019s  cost  of  capital  is  calculated  for  the  Project  as  a  whole.  The  Project  will  be\n4. \nfinanced by foreign debt (60 percent) and local debt. The cost of debt for the Project in rupees is\n12 percent and 11 percent, respectively, for the ADB loan and domestic commercial loans.

Overall  system  losses  in  Madhya  Pradesh  are  estimated  at  47\npercent, comprising 22 percent technical and 25 commercial losses for a total estimated loss of\n16,857  million  units.  However,  regional  data  of  losses  show  high  discrepancies  between  the\ndifferent  distribution  areas.  Gwalior  (64  percent)  and  Ujjain  (60  percent)  districts  have  the\nhighest  distribution  system  losses,  with  Indore  following  close  behind  with  an  estimated  52\npercent loss and Bhopal and Jabalpur at 48 percent and 46 percent. Project components A and\nB  support  physical  investments  for  technical  and  commercial  loss  reduction  in  those  regions.\nThese  physical  investments  are  an  integral  part  of  the  comprehensive  loss  reduction  strategy\ncurrently being implemented by the Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPSEB). The loss\nreduction strategy of MPSEB is targeting three levels, (i) energy audit and end-user metering to\ngain  more  accurate  loss  estimation  data  to  identify  the  distribution  circles  with  the  highest\nlosses,  (ii)  internal  efficiency  improvement  through  computerized  billing  and  revenue  system\nand  increased  staff  responsibilities  for  reducing  theft  and  meter  tampering,  and  (iii)  physical\ninvestments directly targeting loss reduction.\n\n2.\nComponent  C  supports  upgrading  and  rehabilitation  of  state  transmission  system\ncomponents  to  reduce  technical  losses  throughout  the  state.  Load-flow  analysis  for  9  of  the\nproposed  132  33  kilovolt  (kV)  substations  found  an  average  loss  reduction  value  of\n11 megawatt (MW) per substation with the lowest value at 4.6 MW and the highest at 16 MW. In\nthe economic analysis a value of 3 MW of loss reduction for the 25 substations was used, which\nestimates benefits conservatively. In addition, a reduction of 57 MW peak-load transmission loss\nhas also been included in the analysis.\n\n3.\nBenefits from loss reduction are threefold. First, they will generate additional revenue for\nMPSEB and contribute to an improvement in the financial situation, which will ultimately result in\nan improved power supply situation. Second, commercial loss reduction in particular will reduce\npower demand for different customer categories according to their respective price elasticity of\ndemand,  and  will  thus  indirectly  contribute  to  a  reduction  of  power  shortages.  No  analysis  of\nprice  elasticity  has  been  carried  out  for  Madhya  Pradesh  and  the  currently  available  data\nappears insufficient to calculate appropriate values. Third, technical loss reduction in particular\nwill  result  in  economic  resource  cost  savings  as  less  units  need  to  be  generated,  transmitted,\nand distributed to supply the same amount of energy to end-consumers.\n\n4.\nThe  methodology  of  economic  evaluation  for  all  subprojects  is  similar.  The  economic\nanalysis was carried out at border price level using FY2001 prices. To convert financial cost into\neconomic  cost,  taxes  and  duties  were  deducted.  No  price  contingencies  are  included  in  the\nbase capital cost but the economic capital costs include 10 percent physical contingencies. The\ncosts  were  separated  into  foreign  exchange,  indirect  foreign  exchange,  and  local  currency\ncosts. Local costs were further separated and a specific conversion factor of 0.85 was used for\nunskilled  labor.  The  remaining  local  costs  were  converted  to  border  price  level  by  applying  a\nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.9.  Annual  operation  and  maintenance  costs  were  also\ncalculated in economic prices as a percentage of the total capital investment cost. However, no\noperational  and  maintenance  cost  were  included  for  component  B  since  the  conversion  of\nexisting low tension (LT) lines into 11 kV does not create any incremental cost.\n\n5.\nThe  economic  benefits  of  loss  reduction  were  calculated  separately  for  technical  and\ncommercial  loss  reduction.  Technical  loss  reduction  under  component  A  was  valued  at  the\naverage  cost  of  supply  at  LT  level  for  FY2000,  and  for  component  C  at  the  average  cost  of\nsupply  at  extra  high  tension  level  for  FY2000,  the  latest  year  for  which  the  breakdown  is\n\n\f88\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\navailable.  Commercial  loss  reduction  was  valued  at  the  increasing  tariff  levels  up  to  FY2010,\nreflecting  the  changing  relationship  between  average  cost  of  supply  and  average  tariff,  which\nresults in reduction of economic subsidies over the lifetime of the Project.  Benefits are assumed\nto build up gradually over three years.\n\n6.\nThe base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for component A is estimated at\n17.1  percent,  for  component  B  at  16.8  percent,  and  for  component  C  at  16.4  percent.  The\nEIRRs  were  calculated  for  25  years,  including  the  construction  period.  No  residual  value  was\nconsidered.  Comprehensive  sensitivity  analysis  and  calculation  of  switching  values  indicates\nthat the EIRR values for all three project components are above the 12 percent threshold for all\nadverse circumstances tested. Implementation delay was tested by assuming that the buildup of\nbenefits over a three-year period will only commence after finalization of construction.
