Given the complexity of\nsector reforms, implementation will follow a phased approach over\na period of time. The SDP supports the first stage of reforms that\nlay the foundation for change and create an enabling environment\nfor future private sector involvement through independent sector\nregulation;  institutional  and  organizational  actions  for  improved\nsector governance; establishment and gradual operationalization\nof  new  sector  companies;  decisions  about  reconfigurating  the\ndistribution segment, and managerial, financial, and operational\nefficiency  improvements  in  ongoing  operations.  These  policy\ninitiatives will be supported by targeted physical investments to\nreduce  system  losses,  improve  operational  and  financial\nperformance,  and  increase  the  delivery  capacity  of  the  power\nsector to reap the benefits offered by sector restructuring.\nThe SDP seeks to assist in improving public and private resource\nallocation in MP by increasing the operational efficiencies and\ndelivery capacity, and progressively reducing the demands on the\nstate budget for the power sector that have resulted in suboptimal\nallocation  of  public  funds  at  the  expense  of  other  state\nresponsibilities  like  education  and  health.  This  requires\nsimultaneous  intervention  at  the  policy  level  to  provide  the\nnecessary legal and institutional framework, and at the project\nlevel  to  support  critical  investment  components  to  ensure  the\nsuccess of the reforms. Therefore, a mixed-modality SDP seeking\nto  establish  appropriate  policies  as  well  as  supporting  project\ninvestments  is  considered  the  best  instrument  for  supporting\npower sector restructuring initiatives.\nClassification Thematic: Economic Growth\nGood Governance", "iii\nThe Sector Development Program\nObjectives and Scope The immediate objectives of the policy component (the Program)\nof  the  SDP  are  to  (i) improve  the  policy  environment  and\ngovernance  of  the  sector;  (ii) initiate  the  establishment  of  a\ncommercial  and  competitive  business  environment  to  promote\nefficiency  gains  and  loss  reduction;  (iii) improve  the  financial\nviability of the Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPSEB)\nthrough financial restructuring; and (iv) introduce a computerized\ninformation and revenue management system.\nPolicy Framework\nand Actions The policy framework includes support for several actions.\nThe MP Vidyut Sudhar Adhiniyam, 2000 (the Reform Act), brought\ninto force on 3 July 2001, is the most progressive in India to date\nand includes provision for (i) restructuring MPSEB, (ii) mandatory\nmetering  of  all  consumers;  (iii) rationalizing  tariffs  so  that  all\nclasses of consumers will pay at least 75 percent of cost of supply\n(progressively phased over 5 years); (iv) allocating subsidies from\nthe  MP  government  (MPG)  budget  before  subsidizing  any\ncategory  of  consumers;  (v) creating  the  MP  State  Electricity\nRegulatory  Commission  (MPSERC);  and  (vi) referring  dispute\nresolution  between  MPG  and  the  MPSERC  to  the  Central\nElectricity Regulatory Commission rather than to the courts.\nThe existing MP Electricity Regulatory Commission was converted\ninto  the  first  MPSERC  following  the  coming  into  force  of  the\nReform Act.\nThe generation, transmission, and distribution functions of MPSEB\nwill be corporatized and commercialized.\nThe MPSEB tariff structure will be rationalized and free power\nsupply in the state will be restricted.\nThe sector will undergo financial restructuring.\nThe Investment Project The investment component (the Project) of the SDP comprises six\ncomponents:\nA: 33 kilovolt (kV)  and  11kV  system   improvements   in Bhopal,\nGwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, Khargone, Mandsaur, and Ujjain areas;\nB:  Conversion    of  selected  low-voltage  feeders  supplying\nagricultural  pumps  in  selected    divisions    in    Mandsaur    and\nUjjain districts to 11kV operation;", "iv\nC: Reinforcement  and   augmentation of the   transmission  system\nfacilities in selected priority areas of MP;\nD: Setting  up  of   a    computerized   information   and    revenue\nmanagement system;\nE: Provision of three-phase meters; and\nF: Consulting     services      for    the    initial   phase   of    project\nimplementation.\nCost Estimates The  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $318.9  million  equivalent,\ncomprising $200.0 million in foreign exchange and $118.9 million\nequivalent in local currency costs.\n($ million)\nFinancing Plan Source Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB 200.0      0.0 200.0 62.7\nMPSEB/     0.0  118.9 118.9 37.3\nMPG\nTotal 200.0 118.9 318.9 100.0\nADB = Asian Development Bank; MPG = Madhya Pradesh government,\nMPSEB = Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board.\nEnvironmental and \nSocial Measures  The Project is classified as Category B. An initial environmental\nexamination was undertaken and the summary is attached as a\ncore appendix.\nThe poverty impact assessment for the SDP indicates that the\nmandatory metering under the Reform Act is more beneficial for\nlow-income  and  poor  households  than  the  flat  rate  currently\ncharged, since the per-unit charge is higher on a flat rate basis.\nUnder the SDP, access to power connections by consumers living\nbelow  the  poverty  line  will  be  facilitated  through  a  scheme  of\namortizing the upfront connection charges and associated fees\nover 12 months. Improved technical and nontechnical efficiency\nwill  benefit  all  categories  of  consumers  by  improving  supply\nquality.", "v\nThe Policy Loan\nLoan Amount\nand Terms A loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will\nbe provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on proposed\nassistance to India for the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Program, that includes\n(i) a policy loan, and (ii) an investment loan.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. India\u2019s economy has been growing by about 6 percent annually over the last six years.1\nThe country\u2019s economic performance, however, does not necessarily imply that the economy is\nfully  utilizing  its  growth  potential.  The  slowing  of  economic  reforms  since  the  mid-1990s\nhighlighted  the  major  problems  affecting  the  economy  including  severe  infrastructure\nbottlenecks, widening fiscal deficits, poverty, and illiteracy. In particular, the deteriorating fiscal\nhealth of the central and state governments is significantly undermining the long-term growth\npotential of the economy. Insufficient investments in physical infrastructure, both public and\nprivate, prevent the economy from reaping the benefits that are offered by market reforms and\nliberalization. This is particularly worrisome as empirical evidence on India strongly suggests\nthat economic growth is the most effective path to sustained poverty reduction.\n3. Under the Indian federal structure the states are responsible for a large number of vital\nactivities,  including  infrastructure  facilities,  education,  health,  and  law  enforcement.\nConsequently, the fiscal health of the states is crucial for delivering these public services. While\na large part of the states\u2019 fiscal deficit is due to financial mismanagement and the priority\nservicing of political interests, the inability of the states to recover the costs of their services is a\nfurther reason for their poor fiscal health. For example, in the power sector, the inadequate\naverage tariff base necessitates high budgetary subsidies to power utilities. As one result of the\nfiscal crunch, the electricity generation expansion target set for the Eighth Five-Year Plan\n(1992/97) fell short by 50 percent due primarily to inadequate investment at the state level. If not\nremedied, the unavailability of sufficient power will be the single most important constraint to\neconomic development in the coming years and will thwart efforts to attract domestic and\nforeign investment.\n4. Recognizing the importance of improving policymaking at the state level to enhance\nstructural reforms in India, in 1996 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopted a new strategy\nfor its operations in India directly targeting a portion of its assistance to selected states that have\ndemonstrated  the  political  will  to  (i) undertake  structural  reforms  in  their  macrofinances;\n(ii) improve their public resources management, (iii) restructure public sector enterprises; and\n(iv) undertake sectoral reforms. Gujarat was the first state chosen for this type of holistic support.\nADB approved the first loan in December 1996.2 Based on the willingness and commitment of\nthe Madhya Pradesh government (MPG) to reforms, the state of Madhya Pradesh (MP) was\nincluded as the second focal state. Kerala was included as the third focal state and policy\ndialogue has been initiated. The MPG and ADB agreed on a program to enhance resource\nallocation to social sectors, improve fiscal capabilities, reform the public enterprise sector, and\npromote an enabling environment for private sector participation in supporting infrastructure.\nThe reform program was supported by the approval of the MP Public Resource Management\nProgram loan,3 which initiated power sector reform with ADB agreeing, in principal, to provide\n                  \n1 CER: IND 200019: Country Economic Review , India, December 2000.\n2 Loan  1506-IND:  Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management Program,  for  $250  million,  approved  on\n18 December 1996.\n3 Loan  1717-IND:  Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program,  for  $250  million,  approved  on\n14 December 1999.", "2\ntargeted assistance for power sector development. The Power Sector Development Program\n(SDP)  is  included  in  the  2001  country  program  for  India.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  and\nAppraisal Mission were fielded during March-April 2001 and August-September 2001.4 This\nreport is based on the agreements reached during the missions.\nIII.  THE SECTOR\nA.  Macroeconomic Context\n1.  Recent Macroeconomic Performance\n5. In terms of area, MP was the largest state in India and fourth in population until it was\nbifurcated into two states, MP and Chhattisgarh, on 1 November 2000, on the basis of the MP\nReorganization Act, 2000. Its rich deposits of coal, iron ore, limestone, and forest resources\nwere the prime sources of industrial growth in the prebifurcated state. The major resource-tied\nindustries were steel, cement, and newsprint. During the 1980\u2019s, the state had three primary\nattractions for many industrial units not based on local resources, such as chemical, electrical\nappliances, yarns, and garments: abundant land, no labor problems, and uninterrupted power\nsupply. Thus the state economy has shown robust growth averaging 4.4 percent since 1980/81,\naccelerating  to  5 percent  during  1990/96.  The  contribution  of  the  primary  sector  in  state\ndomestic product declined gradually over time and the contribution of services and industry rose\nconsistently. For example, the share of the primary sector declined from 43.4 percent in 1993/94\nto 39.6 percent in 1998/99. Similarly, the share of manufacturing and construction rose from\n21.4 percent to 23.0 percent during the same period.\n6. However,  the  industrial  growth  situation  has  changed  noticeably  since  1995/96.\nCountrywide industrial recession and acute power shortages (almost 14 percent of the peak\ndemand in 1995/96) led to a sharp decline in industrial growth in MP.5 The growth rate of real\nnet state domestic product of registered manufacturing declined sharply from 7.1 percent in\n1994/95 to 4.4 percent in 1995/96, and 1.1 percent in 1996/97. Many industrial units were\nforced to shutdown leading to large-scale unemployment. For example, the ferro alloys industry\nmade its debut in the state in 1989. The number of units rose to 22 by 1995. Power shortages\ncoupled with steep hikes in the power tariff after 1995 and strong market pressure due to the\nnew open import policy led to the closure of almost all of the 22 units as of 1999;6 and their\npower consumption reduced from 424 million units in 1995/96 to 17.34 in 1999/2000. Total\ninvestment in these plants was about Rs2 billion and 20,000 workers were involved directly or\nindirectly.  Similarly  many  designated  economic  growth  centers  in  MP  failed  to  promote\nindustrialization due to the lack of proper infrastructure, such as roads, water, and street lights\netc. A recent small survey of constraints faced by small-and medium-sized enterprises in MP7\nidentifies lack of infrastructure, in particular shortage of electricity and its quality, followed by the\npoor state of the roads.\n                  \n4  The project team consisted of D. Graczyk, Senior Energy Sector Specialist and Mission Leader; IWEN; B. M.\nKarunaratne, Senior Project Engineer, IWEN; P. Ghosh, Senior Environment Specialist, ENVD; K.

Kimura, Energy Sector Specialist, IWEN; C. Litwin,\nPoverty Reduction Specialist, IWEN; V. S. Rekha, Counsel, OGC; and H. Mukhopadhyay, Macroeconomist, INRM.\n5 The reasons for postreform industrial recession in India are still being debated. However, high lending rates, credit\nsqueeze, and political uncertainties are some of the important factors.\n6 National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. 1999.

MP is one of the poorest states in India. In 1998/99, the per capita annual income was\nRs7,350 (in constant prices) as compared with Rs9,739 at the all-India level. The percentage of\nthe population living below the poverty line was 37.4 in 1999/2000, much higher than the all-\nIndia figure of 26.1 percent.\n8. The new MP comprises roughly two thirds of the state before bifurcation, in terms of land\narea  and  population,  is  industrially  more  diversified  with  a  higher  proportion  of  light  and\nmanufacturing industries, and will have a higher per-capita income than the undivided state.\nHowever, the new MP has lost most of its natural and mineral resources to Chhattisgarh, and\nwill need to adopt a new strategy for stimulating industrial growth. Therefore, future plans for\nindustrialization in the new MP should primarily focus on promoting industries that are not\nresource-tied. States in India are competing to attract these industries. As decided by the\ncouncil  of  state  finance  ministers,  all  fiscal  incentives  for  industrialization  were  ended  by\nApril 2001. Thus, future industrialization will critically depend on adequate infrastructure facilities\nincluding power and good roads, as well as adequate education and health facilities to attract\ngrowth industries and their employees.\n2.  Macroeconomic Linkages of Power Sector Reform\n9. Delays in reforms and the MPG policy of free power supply to a large proportion of its\nagricultural and domestic consumers (para. 62) has brought the MP Electricity Board (MPEB)\n(para. 20) into a severe financial crisis. As a result, MPEB is unable to provide adequate power,\nwhich is the most important ingredient of growth in the state. Also, the state exchequer is losing\npotential revenues that could have been mobilized from a financially strong electricity board. For\nexample, in fiscal year (FY) 2001 MPEB\u2019s dues from interest on MPG loans (Rs3.33 billion) and\nfor electricity duty (Rs3.31 billion), which MPEB collects on behalf of MPG, is estimated to be\nequivalent to almost 8 percent of the state\u2019s own revenue (both tax and nontax), and 0.8 percent\nof the net state domestic product. However, as a result of misdirected power policies and a\nnoncommercial tariff structure, MPG provides annual budgetary support for MPEB such as the\nrural  electrification  subsidy,  subsidy  for  free  power  supply,  and  fresh  loans.  And  although\nMPEB\u2019s dues are adjusted entirely against budgetary support, MPG\u2019s unpaid subsidy to MPEB\namounted to Rs23.3 billion as of March 2001. In 1996, MPG adjusted Rs7.9 billion by writing off\nits loans to MPEB, and in FY 1998 converted another Rs7 billion of its loans to equity to clear\nthe backlog of subsidy payment from the state budget to MPEB.\n10. Although funds are not fully fungible, fiscal imbalances, budgetary allocations, and the\nfinancial deterioration of MPSEB are clearly linked, as state budget support to the power sector\ncrowds  out  public  expenditure  and  investments  in  alternative  sectors  more  productive  for\npoverty reduction. The cash shortfall of MPSEB under a no-reform scenario is estimated at\nRs16.7  billion  for  FY2002.  In  terms  of  evaluating  the  opportunity  cost  of  MPSEB\u2019s  cash\nrequirements,  the  cash  shortfall  translates  into  32  percent  of  total  social  sector  spending,\nincluding capital investments. In view of the state fiscal imbalances, the Government has been\ncompelled to finance budgetary support for the power sector through the banking sector. The\ncash requirement of MPSEB would amount to 43 percent of the gross fiscal deficit. Further\ndeterioration of MPSEB would increase resource requirements from the banking sector and\naffect the ability of the sector to lend for private sector investments, which are more productive\nfor economic growth. The macroeconomic linkages of the power sector reform are summarized\nin Figure 1.\n11. MPG support for the power sector is targeted primarily at operational subsidies instead\nof supporting investments in system expansion to improve quantity, quality, and reliability of", "4\nsupply or at least for adequate maintenance of existing assets. The electrification ratio for\nhouseholds in MP is about 42 percent, with less than 29 percent electrified in rural areas. Efforts\nby the state to increase private sector investment in power generation were undermined by the\nMPEB\u2019s low credit rating. Recognizing its inability to fund the additional investments required in\nthe  power  sector,  MPG  has  decided  to  reorganize  the  power  sector  to  increase  the  self-\nfinancing capability with the objective of increasing the ability to allocate budget resources to\nsocial sectors.\nFigure 1: Macroeconomic Linkages of Power Sector Reform\nPower Sector Reform\nFiscal relief Higher Benefits to the\nto the state revenue real sector\ngovernment growth\nStable\nIncreased Higher Higher Higher demand for\ncredit available expenditure capital employment mass-\nfor private on social expenditure consumption\nsector sectors items\nReduction in\nPoverty\nB.  Sector Description and Recent Performance\n1.  Organization\n12. India consists of 28 states8 and 7 union territories with a total population of over 1 billion.\nThe organization of the power sector is determined by the country\u2019s federal structure. All major\nissues  affecting  the  power  sector  require  concurrent  action  by  the  central  and  state\ngovernments.\n13. The central Government\u2019s Ministry of Power provides overall guidance to the sector\nthrough the Central Electricity Authority (CEA). The Government owns central power utilities\nsuch  as  the  National  Thermal  Power  Corporation  (NTPC),  National  Hydroelectric  Power\n                  \n8 Three new states, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Uttaranchal, were created in November 2000 through the\nbifurcation of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh states, respectively.", "5\nCorporation  (NHPC),  Nuclear  Power  Corporation  and  the  Powergrid  Corporation  of  India\n(Powergrid), which are engaged in generation and interstate power transmission. The Rural\nElectrification Corporation and the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) are Government-owned\nand dedicated to financing power sector activities. The Power Trading Corporation was recently\nestablished to be responsible for power trading for large independent power producers targeted\nto multistate purchases.\n14. State governments control the rest of the sector through 17 state electricity boards\n(SEBs) and 12 electricity departments, which provide distribution facilities and set retail tariffs\nwithin  a  state,  and  share  responsibility  with  the  central  power  sector  agencies  for  power\ngeneration and transmission. The central agencies own and operate 32 percent of the country\u2019s\ntotal generation, while the SEBs and electricity departments have 64 percent of the total. In\naddition,  five  private  utilities  in  urban  agglomerations  have  a  4  percent  share  in  power\ngeneration.\n15. In 1998, the Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC) Act was passed by the Indian\nParliament and in the same year the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) was\nestablished. The ERC Act gives CERC full autonomy to regulate central power utilities and to\nset bulk tariffs. The ERC Act also encourages the states to establish state electricity regulatory\ncommissions with full authority for state-level power utilities.\n2.  State Electricity Boards\n16. The Indian Electricity Act of 1910 and the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 provide the\nlegal basis for the establishment and operation of SEBs. SEBs are typically vertically integrated\nentities owned by their respective state governments. While they are nominally independent\nfrom the state governments, their commercial and financial operations are subject to substantial\nintervention  by  these  governments,  in  particular  for  tariff  setting,  metering  policies,  and\nelectrification targets. Most SEBs are ordered to provide free or highly subsidized power to the\nagriculture sector and to a substantial portion of domestic consumers. Continuous politicization\nof the sector combined with a lack of commercial culture and accountability have resulted in\nnegative internal cash generation by SEBs, impeded expansion of the power system, and\nrestrained adequate maintenance and rehabilitation of existing assets. As a result, the demand-\nsupply gap has widened, and the quality of power supply has deteriorated in almost all parts of\nthe country.\n17. Recognizing the need to separate social obligations from commercial imperatives, some\nstates initiated power sector reforms in the mid-1990s and passed their own power sector\nreform bills to provide a legal basis for SEB reorganization. The states that have reorganized, or\nare in the process of reorganizing, their power sectors are Orissa (1996), Haryana (1998),\nAndhra Pradesh (1999), Karnataka (1999), MP (2000), Rajasthan (2000), Uttar Pradesh (2000),\nDelhi (2001), and Gujarat (2001). The major objective of the state power sector reform is to\nincrease the sector\u2019s self-generation of funds and to reduce its reliance on budget transfers from\nthe state\u2019s budget. Although each state has adopted a unique model of power reform, all models\nreflect in one way or the other the desire to distance the government from power sector\noperations.\n3.  Central Power Utilities\n18. Until 1972, the SEBs were almost solely responsible for developing power generation\nand transmission within their states, but were unable to meet the rapidly increasing demand for\nelectricity. To improve the efficiency of generation, three central sector agencies \u2014 NTPC,", "6\nNHPC, and Nuclear Power Corporation \u2014 were established in 1975 to generate bulk power for\nsale to SEBs. In 1989, Powergrid was established as a transmission and dispatch company by\namalgamating the transmission and dispatch assets of all central power sector agencies. In\naddition to these wholly owned companies, the Government also has shares in special-purpose\ngenerating companies.\n19. The central agencies, including NTPC, NHPC, and Powergrid, are seriously affected by\nthe poor financial health of most SEBs, as was evidenced several times in the past when\nexcessive accounts receivable from SEBs seriously impaired the central agencies\u2019 financial\nliquidity. To resolve this problem, NTPC has, in addition to restricting supply and obtaining\nGovernment appropriation to settle SEB debts, even resorted to taking over the SEB generation\nfacilities  in  settlement  of  accounts  receivable.9  ADB\u2019s  two  loans  to  Powergrid,10  restrict\ninvestments  to  SEBs  that  have  a  satisfactory  payment  record  with  Powergrid  and  make\nprovisions for Powergrid to suspend power supply to delinquent SEBs.\n4.  Madhya Pradesh Power Sector\n20. The  MP  power  sector  was  operated  by  a  vertically  integrated  monopoly,  MPEB.\nFollowing the bifurcation of the state into MP and Chhattisgarh, in pursuance of subsection (4)\nof section 58 of the MP Reorganization Act, 2000, MPEB was succeeded by the MP State\nElectricity Board (MPSEB) and the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB), both vertically\nintegrated monopolies. As of 1 November 2000, the total installed capacity in the undivided\nstate of MP was 4,261 megawatt (MW). The division of generating capacity following the\nbifurcation is given in Table 1.\nTable 1: Generation Plant Details (1999-2000)\nState Type Total\n(megawatts)\nA. Madhya Pradesh (new) Thermal 2,148\nHydro    753\nTotal (A) 2,901\nB. Chhattisgarh Thermal 1,240\nHydro   120\nTotal (B) 1,360\nC. Total (Old MP) Thermal 3,388\nHydro    873\nTotal (C) 4,261\nCentral Allocation 1,521\n      Source: MPSEB.\n21. Based on a provisional Government order, generation capacity was allocated between\nthe two states on the basis of asset location. Similarly, transmission assets, distribution regions,\nand project/asset-specific liabilities, including employees, would be split along geographic state\nborders.  However,  non-project/asset-specific  liabilities  (including  employees)  would  be\napportioned on the basis of population leaving MPSEB to assume approximately 79 percent of\ntotal long-term debt of MPEB. Both states have requested the Government to reconsider its\n                  \n9  As part of the agreement to change the executing agency for Loan 907-IND: Unchahar Thermal Power Project, for\n$160.0 million approved on 29 September 1988 to NTPC, ADB, the Government, the Uttar Pradesh government,\nand NTPC agreed to transfer title to the 420-MW Stage-I to NTPC. NTPC has since taken over the Talcher\nThermal Power Station from Orissa SEB, and the Tanda Thermal Power Station from Uttar Pradesh SEB in lieu of\ndues owned by these states.\n10Loan 1405-IND: Power Transmission (Sector) Project, for $275 million, approved on 16 November 1995 and\nLoan 1764-IND: Power Transmission Improvement (Sector) Project, for $250 million, approved on 6 October 2000.", "7\norder. Nonetheless, MPSEB was already granted the right of first refusal for purchasing surplus\npower from CSEB\u2019s own production. The key indicators for the new MP\u2019s power sector are\ngiven in Supplementary Appendix A.\n22. From  1993  to  2000,  power  demand  grew  by  a  compounded  7.3  percent  annually.\nHowever,  annual  growth  rates  fluctuated  strongly  due  to  the  severe  power  shortages\nexperienced from 1996 to 1998. Growth was also uneven between the different customer\ncategories over the same period with high tension (HT) industrial consumers showing zero\ngrowth compared with a compounded 16 percent growth rate for agricultural consumers.\n23. The  size  of  load  served,  as  well  as  the  load  mix,  in  the  two  new  states  differs\nsignificantly from that of the undivided MP state (Table 2). As a result, the new MPSEB is\nexpected to be in a financially weaker position than erstwhile MPEB because (i) many high-\nprofile industrial consumers reside in Chhattisgarh, (ii) 94 percent of agricultural consumers\nremain in the new MP, and (iii) allocation of 32 percent of generation capacity to Chhattisgarh\nwill leave the new MP with a more serious power shortage.\nTable 2: Load Mix for MPSEB and MPEB in 1999-2000\nState Unit Domestic LT Agriculture HT Industry All Other Total\nMadhya Pradesh MU 2,622.2 8,994.6 2,984.2 3,721.6 18,322.6\n(MPSEB) 14% 49% 16% 21% 100%\nChhattisgarh MU 929.8 624.3 2,916.8 942.3   5,413.2\n% 17% 12% 54% 17% 100%\nTotal (MPEB) MU 3,552.0 9,618.9 5,901.0 4,663.9 23,735.8\n% 15% 41% 25% 19% 100%\nHT  = high tension, LT = low tension, MPEB  = Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board, MU = million units.\nSource: MPSEB.\nC.  Constraints and Issues\n24. Load Restrictions. Power demand grew by 6.4 percent in 1999/2000 and the peak\ndemand-supply gap in the same year is estimated at about 1,500 MW. This unserved, or\nsuppressed demand, results from planned (load relief) and unplanned (load shedding) cuts. In\nresponse to the shortage, MPEB resorted to load restrictions for HT, low tension (LT), and rural\nconsumers. Energy shortfall reached 1,060 gigawatt-hours in 1998/99 and is estimated to have\nincreased to 1,552 gigawatt-hours for the year 1999/2000. Quality of supply has also suffered\nas a result of overloaded transmission and distribution facilities; the system has been operating\nat lower than normal frequency and voltage approximately 55 percent of the time. Transmission,\ndistribution, and generation limitations are thus preventing the system from meeting demand.\n25. Independent Power Producer Policy. In response to the growing supply gap, MPG\ninitiated a policy to invite private power producers and entered into power purchase agreements\nwith a total of 17 sponsors. However, none of the independent power producers has achieved\nfinancial closure yet due to MPEB\u2019s insufficient escrow capacity11. In December 1999, the\nescrow capacity was reviewed and revised to 900 MW, which is only 35 percent of the capacity\nestimated 18 months earlier, pointing to the sector\u2019s severe financial problems.\n                  \n11The term escrow used here refers to the deposition of the revenue stream from a specific revenue collection\ncenter, e.g., a distribution unit, into a separate account in an identified bank, an escrow agent. In the power sector\nthis mechanism is mostly used to guarantee payment of an independent power producer, to whom the primary\nclaim on a revenue stream from a distribution zone is transferred or escrowed.", "8\n26. Tariff Structure and Subsidies. The financial problems of MPEB and its successor\nMPSEB are in large part due to an MPG policy (para. 62) to provide free power to single-point\nconnections12  in  urban  and  rural  areas  and  for  agricultural  pump  connections  up  to\n5 horsepower.  Moreover,  MPG  instructed  MPEB  to  supply  almost  free  electricity  to  rural\nelectricity  cooperative  committees  (Rs0.07  per  kWh)  and  to  pursue  a  vigorous  rural\nelectrification program. This resulted in lopsided growth rates in the domestic and primarily the\nagriculture  sectors  at  the  expense  of  the  industrial  and  commercial  consumer  categories.\nIndustrial consumption was 82.7 percent of total energy consumption in 1970/71, but dropped to\nonly 20 percent of consumption in 1999/2000. During the same period, the percentage of\nagricultural consumption went up from 3.4 percent to 41 percent.\n27. With its high energy consumption, the agriculture sector contributed barely 6 percent of\ntotal MPEB revenue in 1999/2000, while the industry sector\u2019s contribution was 43 percent\ncompared with 20 percent of consumption. In terms of average realization per kilowatt-hour\n(kWh), the agriculture sector accounted for Rs0.27 and the domestic sector for Rs0.93 as\ncompared with an average cost of supply of Rs3.03 per kWh (Table 3).\nTable 3: Average Realization from Energy Sold\nFY1996 FY2000\nItem %Total Average Tariff %Total %Total Average Tariff %Total\nConsumption Rs/kWh Revenue Consumption Rs/kWh Revenue\nDomestica 15 0.65 7 15 0.93 8\nIrrigation/ 35 0.18 4 41 0.27 6\nAgriculture\nHT Industriesb 33 2.66 62 20 3.82 43\nAve.Overall 1.74 3.03\nSupply Cost\nHT= high tension, kWh= kilowatt-hour, Rs= Indian Rupee.\na\nIncludes single point consumers.\nbIncludes steel plants.\nSource: MPSEB.\n28. This situation has resulted in (i) MPSEB not having resources to finance its system\nexpansion to meet unserved demand; (ii) industrial consumers paying high tariffs that impair\ntheir competitiveness and consequently establishing their own generation facilities, eroding\nMPSEB\u2019s  consumer  mix;  and  (iii) MPSEB  being  unable,  without  subsidies  from  the  state\ngovernment, to earn a return on its investments as prescribed by law.\n29. Captive Power. In direct response to the deficient quantity and quality of power supply\ncoupled with high tariffs, major industrial consumers have set up their own captive power\ngeneration plants. From 1995/96 to 1999/2000, growth of captive generation averaged 8.7\npercent per year, with the last two years being above 9.3 percent for a total of 1,390 MW of\ninstalled captive capacity for MPEB. Of this, 671 MW or 48 percent is located in the territory\nsupplied by the new MPSEB. This represents considerable loss of revenues for MPSEB.\n30. System Losses. From 1994/95 to 1998/99, transmission and distribution (T&D) losses\nhave varied within a range of 19.6 percent to 20.9 percent. Precise loss estimation is hampered\nby the fact that currently only about 38 percent of energy input into the distribution system is\nmeasured due to the policy of free supply for designated agricultural and domestic consumers,\n                  \n12These are unmetered connections intended for operation of a single power outlet point only.", "9\nand the charging of a flat rate for several other consumer groups. In addition, a significant\nnumber  of  meters  are  defective  and  consumption  of  those  customers  also  needs  to  be\nestimated.\n31. Losses consist of two major types: technical and commercial. Estimation of technical\nlosses  can  be  made  rather  precisely  through  load-flow  analysis.  Commercial  losses  are\ngenerally a function of the operation of the system; and can include theft, metering problems,\nand billing and collection inefficiencies. Given the current absence of energy audit and full end-\nuser metering of agricultural customers, reestimation of consumption by MPSEB consultants\nbased on connected load, supply restrictions, etc., provides strong evidence that agricultural\nconsumption is gravely overstated and that losses are understated. This revised estimate shows\nlosses of around 47 percent, of which 22 percent are considered technical and 25 percent\ncommercial. Reduction in technical losses generally requires significant investment; because of\nthe financial constraint of MPSEB, the improvement in technical losses is expected to be slow.\nOn the other hand, major improvement in nontechnical losses can be quickly achieved with\nconcerted management effort at much lower levels of investment.\nD.  State Government Objectives and Strategy\n1.  The Policy Framework\n32. As  a  result  of  efforts  made  by  the  National  Development  Council13  the  high-level\nCommittee on Power was constituted in June 1993. In its report submitted in October 1994,\nthe committee  recommended  (i) organizational  reforms  at  the  state  level,  consisting  of\ncommercialization  and  vertical  and  horizontal  unbundling;  (ii) large-scale  involvement  of  the\nprivate sector in generation and distribution; (iii)  depoliticizing electricity-tariff setting by creating\nnational and regional tariff boards; and (iv) progressive phasing out of subsidies to agricultural\nconsumers. These recommendations were renewed in the council meeting with Power ministers\nin October and December 1996, and are outlined in the Common Minimum National Action Plan\nfor Power.\n33. In response to the National Development Council\u2019s recommendation, MPG appointed a\nhigh-level  committee  in  1996  to  review  the  existing  power  sector  situation  and  to  suggest\nmeasures for its restructuring in the context of economic liberalization and introduction of private\ncapital into the sector. Named after its chairman, the Tata Rao Committee issued Guidelines on\nRestructuring and Privatization of Power Sector and Power Tariff in January 1997. The major\nrecommendations of the report were to (i) divide MPEB along functional lines, (ii) maintain\nMPEB  as  a  holding  company,  (iii) establish  a  regulatory  authority,  (iv) allow  private  sector\ninvestment in all functional areas, and (v) improve the financial and operational efficiency of the\ndistribution  segment  before  inviting  private  sector  investment.  The  report  recommended\nfundamental changes in the free supply of power to certain consumer segments, and that any\nsubsidies must be transparent and reimbursed to the utility on a timely basis. The Tata Rao\nCommittee advised against separating and privatizing urban area distribution from semiurban\nand rural distribution, as this would leave the remaining public sector distribution segment highly\nnonviable. It also recommended maintaining uniform tariffs for each category of consumers, as\nlong as the areas continue to be MPEB subsidiaries.\n                  \n13India's highest political body, the council is chaired by the Prime Minister and comprises the chief ministers of all the\nstates in India.", "10\nE.  External Assistance to the Sector\n34. The power sector has received a major portion of India's external assistance. Of ADB\u2019s\ntotal Government-guaranteed lending to India amounting to $9.898 billion as of 31 October\n2001, 9 loans for $1.865 billion (18.8 percent) were approved for the power sector. The first four\nprojects were for power generation; three were sector loans to support improvements in SEB\nefficiency and development of the national transmission grid; and the two most recent were for\nsector development to support the restructuring of a state\u2019s power sector. In addition, under its\nprivate sector operations, ADB has approved three loans and investments totaling $79.8 million\nfor one captive transmission and two generation projects.14 Power subprojects have also been\nconsidered for financing under ADB's private sector infrastructure facility15 and the Infrastructure\nDevelopment  Finance  Company.16  ADB  also  has  approved  $12.9  million  for  21  technical\nassistance (TA), mainly advisory, at both the national and state levels. The TAs have focused\non environmental and pollution control issues related to power generation, bulk transmission\ntariffs, improved least-cost system planning, tariff studies at the retail level, improved technical\nand commercial operations, power sector restructuring, and establishment of an independent\nregulatory authority. Previous ADB assistance to India\u2019s power sector is listed in Supplementary\nAppendix B.\n35. The major funding source to the sector is the World Bank Group. The World Bank has\nsupported  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  projects,  including  assistance\ndirected to SEBs. The World Bank is supporting power sector reforms in the states of Andhra\nPradesh,  Haryana,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  In  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Uttar\nPradesh, power sector reform is viewed as part of overall reform of the state finances. ADB\ncoordinates with the World Bank on the geographical demarcation of state-level operations, as\nwell as to ensure overall complementarity of actions at both the central and state levels. ADB\nand  the  World  Bank  have  concurrent  ongoing  operations  for  different  projects  with  three\norganizations: PFC, Powergrid, and NTPC. Other major agencies funding the sector are the\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau for the Government of\nGermany, Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID), Canadian\nInternational  Development  Agency  (CIDA),  and  United  States  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment. Although the combined assistance of all aid agencies constitutes only about 8-10\npercent of the total investments in the sector, several key policy initiatives have been catalyzed\nas a result. Major external assistance provided to the power sector by other aid agencies is also\nlisted in Supplementary Appendix B.\n36. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation is supporting the expansion of public\nsector  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  including  rural  electrification.  It  has  no\ngeographic preferences.\n37. DFID\u2019s exclusive objective in providing assistance is poverty reduction. It is financing\nstudies for power sector restructuring in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Orissa; and has no\nplans to participate in the financing of hardware other than in renewable energy systems. It is\n                  \n14Loan 7058/1036-IND: CESC Limited, for $17.8 million, approved on 4 October 1990; Loan 7082/1142-IND: CESC\nLimited II, for $32.0 million, approved on 13 December 1991; and Loan 7130/1499-IND: Balagarh Power Company\nLimited, for $15 million in equity and a loan for $25 million, approved on 5 December 1996.\n15Loans  1480/1481/1482-IND: Private Sector Infrastructure Facility, for  a  total  of  $300  million,  approved  on\n7 November 1996.\n16 Investment 7138-IND: Infrastructure Development Finance Company, for $30 million equity investment, approved\non 14 October 1997. The loan amount was subsequently reduced to $15.463 million due to greater than expected\nsubscription from the investors.", "11\nconsidering (i) cooperating with ADB to fund studies on power sector restructuring in MP and\nWest Bengal states; and (ii) assisting these states in other areas also, preferably in the \"soft\"\nsectors, like health and education.\n38. The United States Agency for International Development has extensively supported and\ncontinues to support policy aspects of private sector participation. It has supported studies for\nstate sector reforms through PFC, and by providing grant assistance for energy management,\nconservation, and training.\n39. CIDA assisted Kerala in conducting extensive studies for restructuring its power sector.\nADB is following up on CIDA\u2019s work through policy dialogue and preparation for a possible loan\nintervention. Together with the World Bank, CIDA is providing similar TA for power sector\nreforms  in  Andhra  Pradesh.  In  Madhya  Pradesh,  CIDA  and  ADB  are  cooperating  and\ncoordinating closely in providing assistance to MPSEB and MPG for power sector reform. CIDA\nprovides the most bilateral assistance and is providing an umbrella TA to MPSEB through the\nEnergy Infrastructure Services Project (EISP). The EISP\u2019s components include (i) rationalizing\nthe  tariff  structure;  (ii) developing  a  power  system  master  plan;  (iii) supporting  distribution\nreconfiguration and preparation of a grid code; (iv) restructuring MPSEB debt and preparing\nopening balance sheets for the new sector entities; (v) supporting capacity building for cross-\ncutting themes in environment, gender equality, socioeconomic analysis, and governance; and\n(vi) developing a poverty reduction strategy as it relates to energy availability for the poor\n(para. 50).\nF.  ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n1.  Lessons Learned\n40. ADB operations in India\u2019s power sector have generally been successful from a project\npoint of view, i.e., the projects concerned have achieved their physical objectives. However,\nexcept for the ongoing loans to Powergrid and Gujarat (footnote 10),17 these projects were not\ndesigned to change the business environment, and sector performance continues to deteriorate.\nThis was primarily on account of (i) political interference in tariff setting; (ii) rapid growth of the\ndemand for electricity, making conventional investment strategies unworkable; (iii) government\nrules and regulations and control of the SEBs that inhibited speedy decision making; and (iv) the\nnoncommercial setup of the sector, which did not generate the market for alternative players to\nstep in to bridge the gap between supply and demand.\n41. Although the past strategy enabled ADB to support many projects, it spread ADB's\nresources too thinly, with the result that it could not achieve its desired goal of policy reforms\nwith its power sector borrowers. In most states, the power sector has been the largest recipient\nof state resources, in terms of subsidies as well as in terms of capital investments. Thus, macro\nmanagement  of  the  state's  finances  needs  to  be  improved  if  the  power  sector  is  to  be\nsuccessfully turned around. Therefore, ADB is now assisting selected states with power sector\nreforms, only in the context of a holistic change in their macroeconomic management.\n2.  Operational Strategy\n42. ADB\u2019s  current  operational  strategy  in  India  is  to  support  efforts  to  achieve  higher\nsustainable economic growth to promote employment and reduce poverty. Its contribution to\n                  \n17Loans 1803/1804-IND: Gujarat Power Sector Development Program, for $350 million, approved on 13 December\n2000.", "12\nhigher growth focuses on improving the supply-side efficiency of the economy, especially by\nreducing  bottlenecks  in  key  infrastructure  sectors.  Emphasis  is  on  improving  the  policy,\ninstitutional, and regulatory framework to enhance the efficiency of public sector operations and\nto encourage private investment. Improving resource mobilization to finance the necessary\ninvestments is a key component of ADB\u2019s assistance, and includes support for the development\nof financial and capital markets, as well as for improving internal resource mobilization in the\nsector agencies and enhancing their creditworthiness. High priority is also given to assisting\nprojects that contribute to environmental improvement.\n43. ADB's strategy for India was revised in 1996 to accommodate an urgent need for a\nportion  of  its  assistance  to  be  provided  in  a  systematic  and  comprehensive  way  at  the\nsubnational or state level. This need reflects the facts that (i) a geographic focus, together with\nthe ongoing selective sector focus, enables ADB to maximize its developmental impact both in\nthe states concerned and, through the demonstrational impact of its operations on other states\nas well; (ii) state-level economic reforms, which have been lagging behind initiatives taken\nby the Government,  need  support  and  incentives;  and  (iii) the  states  have  considerable\nautonomy  and  have  major  legislative,  administrative,  and  fiscal  responsibilities  in  many\neconomic and social sectors. Key elements of the subnational assistance include (i) improving\nthe  states'  public  resources  management,  (ii) reforming  and  restructuring  public  sector\nenterprises to improve operating efficiencies, and (iii) supporting reforms in key infrastructure\nsectors with a view to increasing private investment (para. 4).\n44. Reflecting ADB\u2019s overall country strategy for India and in recognition of the dualistic\nstructure of India's power sector, ADB's strategy for the power sector, which has been pursued\nin coordination with the World Bank, intends to operate at two levels. At the central level,\nassistance  is  provided  to  central  power  sector  companies  such  as  Powergrid  (para.  18,\nfootnote 10) and PFC18 with a view to supporting their commercialization and using them as\nagents to leverage reform in their client SEBs. Through its support to PFC, ADB seeks to\npromote  power  sector  reforms  in  states  that  would  currently  not  qualify  for  direct  lending\noperations. At the state level, by considering assistance only for states that demonstrate the\npolitical will to substantially restructure and commercialize their power sectors, and by assisting\nthem to actualize the reforms, ADB is building up the reform process from the grassroots.\nImprovements in the power sector will increase the fiscal space of the state governments and\nincrease  their  ability  to  allocate  more  resources  for  poverty  reduction  and  socioeconomic\ndevelopment.\nIV.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n45. The power sector has become one of the major budget items for MPG due to politicized\nsector management. Despite receiving high annual subsidies, the sector has not been in a\nposition to meet the growing demand for power, and quality and reliability of power supply have\ndeteriorated. Political interference in tariff setting and sector operations had adverse impacts on\nthe operational and financial performance of the MPSEB, which finds itself in a severe financial\ncrisis. The lack of sufficient and reliable power is eroding MP\u2019s competitiveness, and prevents it\nfrom attracting the same level of industrial investments as some of its neighboring states. At the\nsame time, the demands on the state budget for the power sector have resulted in suboptimal\nallocation of public funds at the expense of other state responsibilities like education and health,\n                  \n18Loan 1161-IND: Power Efficiency (Sector) Project, for $250 million, approved on 26 March 1992. The loan account\nwas closed on 18 December 1998.", "13\nfurther undermining the state\u2019s attractiveness as a location for new industrial developments,\nespecially information technology and biotechnology, which are India\u2019s future growth sectors.\nRestoring the sector\u2019s financial viability and sustainability is a declared objective of MPG and\nthe SDP provides the basis for MPG to reform and restructure the power sector.\n46. MPG adopted the recommendations of the Tata Rao Report as the base model for\nsector reform, namely, (i) functional unbundling of MPSEB, (ii) retention of MPSEB as a holding\ncompany, (iii) establishment of a regulatory authority, and (iv) improvement of operational and\nfinancial  efficiency  of  the  distribution  segment  before  inviting  private  sector  investment.\nHowever,  MPG  found  that  given  the  complexity  of  the  sector  reforms  to  be  undertaken,\nimplementation should be phased. Stage I of the reforms will lay  the foundation for change and\ncreate the conducive environment for future private sector involvement in the power sector19\n(Appendix 1 provides a vision for the long-term sector model). In close dialogue with ADB, MPG\ndeveloped a detailed plan for stage I of the reform process that aims at creating an enabling\nenvironment and independent sector regulation; establishing new sector companies and their\ngradual operationalization; deciding on reconfiguring the distribution segment; and improving\nmanagerial,  financial,  and  operational  efficiency  of  its  ongoing  operations.  Those  policy\ninitiatives would be supported by targeted physical investments to reduce system losses and\nincrease  the  delivery  capacity  of  the  power  sector  to  reap  the  benefits  offered  by  sector\nrestructuring. On the basis of the policy dialogue associated with the SDP, MPG submitted its\ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 2), which includes a policy matrix and memorandum of\nunderstanding (MOU) between MPB and MPSEB. A detailed plan for stage I of the reform\nprocess is provided in Appendix 3.\n47. The SDP is designed to support MPG\u2019s long-term goal to ensure an efficient, self-\nsustaining, and competitive power sector to provide sufficient quantity and quality of power to\nsupport  the  state\u2019s  economic  and  social  development.  The  SDP  provides  incentives  for\ninstitutional  and  organizational  actions  for  improved  sector  governance  and  the  functional\nunbundling of MPSEB, and in parallel supports physical investments to strengthen the capacity\nof the power system and to reduce technical and nontechnical losses to improve operational\nand  financial  sector  performance.  The  SDP  seeks  to  improve  public  and  private  resource\nallocation in MP by increasing MPSEB\u2019s operational efficiencies and delivery capacity, and\nprogressively reducing the need for transfers from the state government budget. This requires\nsimultaneous intervention at the policy level to provide the necessary legal and institutional\nframework,  and  at  the  project  level,  to  support  critical  investment  components  to  ensure\nsuccess of the reform. Therefore, a mixed-modality sector development program is considered\nthe  best  instrument  for  supporting  an  initiative  to  restructure  the  power  sector.  The  SDP\nconstitutes  the  first  stage  of  the  reform  process,  and  will  be  followed  by  a  second  loan\nintervention upon successful implementation of the first stage of reforms.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n48. The immediate objectives of the SDP are to assist MPG and MPSEB to (i) improve the\npolicy environment and governance of the sector; (ii) initiate the establishment of a commercial\nand  competitive  business  environment  to  promote  efficiency  gains  and  loss  reduction;\n(iii) improve the financial viability of the MPSEB through financial restructuring; (iv) improve the\nquality and quantity of supply by reinforcing, modernizing, and rehabilitating the T&D systems to\n                  \n19The India Country Strategy Program for 2003 includes TA for Increasing Private Sector Participation in Electricity\nDistribution.", "14\npromote economic growth; (v) introduce a computerized information and revenue management\nsystem; and (vi) pursue installation of meters.\n49. Given the lack of creditworthiness of MPSEB to attract private capital and the parallel\nneed to meet the growing demand for energy, the sector reform and restructuring strategy must\nfocus on enhancing the cash flow at the distribution end. In addition to rationalizing the tariff\nstructure, the SDP will (i) reduce T&D losses, (ii) pursue 100 percent metering, (iii) improve\nbilling and collection efficiency, and (iv) install efficient operational management of power sector\ncompanies. To achieve these changes, autonomous functioning of the power sector along\ncommercial lines, especially of the distribution functions, and independent sector regulation and\ncorporatization  of  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  functions  of  MPSEB,  are\nrequired. The SDP is designed to assist MPG and MPSEB in achieving these objectives. The\nSDP frameworks are provided in Appendix 4.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n50. During its deliberation of the Tata Rao Report, MPG recognized that irrespective of the\nchoice of the long-term sector model, a set of preparatory studies would be needed to optimize\nsector expansion, ensure its commercial viability, attract and optimize private capital investment,\nand  establish  benchmark  performance  for  introducing  competition.  Consequently,  MPG\nrequested ADB assistance for preparing and financing the MP Power Sector Development\nProject.20 The TA was designed as a cluster TA to include six studies, two financed by ADB and\nfour by CIDA.21 In addition, CIDA recently expanded the EISP scope to include funding of\nactivities related to implementing stage I and preparing stage II of the power sector reforms\n(para. 39). ADB will coordinate the overall MP power sector reform program and CIDA is\nworking closely with ADB to implement the studies. The first TA subproject to be implemented\nreviewed electricity legislation and regulation, and included drafting of the MP Power Sector\nReform Bill and support for the selection of a base model for the restructured power sector.\n51. In May 2000, an MOU was signed between the Union Ministry of Power and MPG. In the\nMOU both parties affirm their joint commitment to the reform of the power sector, and set out\ntime-bound reform measures to be implemented by MP and the implementation support to be\nprovided  by  the  Government.  The  MOU  outlines  the  objectives  of  the  reform  program:  to\npromote the development of an efficient, commercially viable and competitive power supply\nindustry, which will provide reliable and quality power at competitive prices to all consumers in\nthe state and which will support the industrial development in the State. The Government\ncommits to support the reforms by allocating additional power from central power stations; and\nproviding financial support for investment projects through Powergrid and PFC, and technical\nconsulting assistance.\n1.  Governance\n52. ADB had extensive policy dialogue with MPG and MPEB about the legislative framework\nand the need to constitute the regulatory authority under a separate state power sector bill and\n                  \n20TA 2980-IND: Technical Assistance to India for the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Project, for\n$1,000,000, approved on 7 January 1998. The six studies include (i) preparation of a power system master plan\n(CIDA); (ii) preparation of a framework for rationalization of tariffs (CIDA); (iii) review of electricity legislation and\nregulation (ADB); (iv) solicitation for private sector implementation of a generation project (ADB); (v) technical and\nmanagerial upgrading of distribution profit centers (CIDA); and (vi) demandside management (CIDA).\n21Implementation of CIDA\u2019s TA components was delayed due to then prevailing external environment. CIDA is\ncurrently implementing TA components (i) and (ii).", "15\nnot under the ERC Act to ensure independence of the regulator. As a result of the policy\ndialogue, the MP Vidyut Sudhar Adhiniyam, 2000 (the Reform Act) was brought into force on\n3 July 2001. The Reform Act is the most progressive in India to date and includes provision for\n(i) restructuring MPSEB, (ii) mandatory metering of all consumers, (iii) tariff rationalization so\nthat all classes of consumers will pay at least 75 percent of the cost of supply (progressively\nphased over 5 years), (iv) allocation of MPG budget subsidies before subsidizing any category\nof consumers, (v) creation of the MP State Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPSERC), and\n(vi) dispute  resolution  between  MPG  and  MPSERC  by  reference  to  the  CERC  as  against\nreference to the courts. The Reform Act is primarily an enabling provision for reform and leaves\nsufficient flexibility for the power sector structure to evolve with future policy decisions and\noperational requirements. Its prescriptive elements, like mandatory metering and minimum tariff\nlevels, are aimed at reducing political interference and ensuring the commercial management of\npower sector operations.\n53. The MP Electricity Regulatory Commission was established in June 1999 under the ERC\nAct  and  was  recognized  as  the  first  MPSERC  upon  bringing  the  Reform  Act  into  force.\nMPSERC is gradually increasing its role as a proactive sector stakeholder. It formed an advisory\ncommittee  consisting  of  representatives  of  different  consumer  groups,  labor  unions,\nnongovernment  organizations,  academic  and  research  bodies,  and  various  government\ndepartments, and issued a tariff philosophy paper for discussion. Its first tariff award was made\nafter holding extensive public hearings throughout MP involving questions and answer sessions\nwith MPSEB officials. Also, in response to MPG\u2019s recent proposals for a state-wide, load-\nshedding schedule, MPSERC held several public consultations before issuing an order.\n54. In  relation  to  the  selection  of  a  model  for  the  postreform  power  sector,  two  large\nstakeholder  meetings  were  organized  during  1999.  Representatives  from  unions,  the  MP\nFederation  of  Industries,  academia,  MPG  officials,  Madhya  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory\nCommission, and MPEB staff attended the meetings. The workshops contributed significantly to\nan  understanding  of  the  objectives,  strategies,  challenges,  and  benefits  of  power  sector\nrestructuring, and increased the transparency of the reform process.\n55. Both the MOU and the Reform Act define MPG\u2019s long-term vision for the sector and set\nthe legal framework for restructuring. However, in the short-term, visible improvements in the\npower sector can only be achieved by combining internal efficiency enhancements of the utility\nand MPG actions to boost MPSEB\u2019s financial viability.\n56. To depoliticize sector management, open and transparent recruitment processes must\nbe  used  to  fill  boards  of  directors  and  senior  management  positions  of  the  new  sector\ncompanies. MPG has agreed to recruit experts from outside government services for functional\nareas  including  finance,  commercial,  corporate  planning,  and  information  technology.  In\nrecognition of the importance of installing and maintaining commercial discipline in the sector,\nMPG has taken the leadership role and issued an order to appropriate at source outstanding\ndues of municipalities and other government bodies. MPG also committed to make future\nsubsidy payments to MPSEB in cash on a monthly basis.\n2.  Reform Model and Institutional Arrangements\n57. Details of the power sector model for stage I of reforms were decided upon by MPG\nthrough continuous policy dialogue with ADB. As recommended by the Tata Rao Report, MPG\ndecided to functionally segregate MPSEB into separate generation, transmission, and distribution\ncompanies  incorporated  under  the  Indian  Companies\u2019  Act,  1956,  to  conduct  business  on  a\ncommercial  basis.  MPSEB  will  remain  as  the  holding  company  of  the  newly  incorporated", "16\ncompanies, and will also act as the single buyer and system operator during the first stage of\npower sector reform. All generation assets of MPSEB will be transferred to the newly incorporated\ngenerating company, and each of the plants will be operated as an independent profit center. All\ntransmission assets will be transferred to the newly established transmission company and it will\nact as the wheeling agent for intrastate transmission activities.\n58. Stage  I  of  the  reforms  also  has  to  contend  with  the  continuous  uncertainty  over\napportionment of liabilities and employees between the two states as a result of bifurcation. The\nfinal  apportionment  will  impact  on  MPG\u2019s  decision  on  transfer  schemes  (proposed  to  be\nprepared under ADB TA) that are a prerequisite for full operationalization of the new sector\ncompanies. Further, MPG recognizes the importance of identifying and assessing any costs\nresulting from the transfer schemes early to be able to mitigate their impacts.\n59. Detailed analytical work needs to be carried out before the final number of distribution\ncompanies can be decided upon. Moreover, the final decision on the number of distribution\ncompanies includes an element of political decision making about the extent of supportable\ncross-subsidization  within  and  between  the  new  distribution  entities  and  the  treatment  of\npredominantly rural distribution areas. Therefore, MPG decided to retain the existing distribution\nregions under MPSEB as the holding company until a final decision has been reached on\ndistribution reconfiguration. ADB also initiated policy dialogue with MPG and MPSEB that some\nof the existing distribution circles should already start operating as independent profit centers to\nprovide practical experience and best practices before operationalization of the new distribution\ncompanies becomes effective. The most suitable candidates for the profit center approach are\nthose distribution circles whose facilities are proposed for upgrading and strengthening. MPSEB\nshould give priority to installing of meters for energy audit and for end-consumers in these circles;\nand fully delegate managerial powers to those circles as part of the overall internal efficiency\nenhancement measures currently being implemented.\n60. While principally open to divestment and private sector involvement in all three functional\nareas, MPG wishes to make its decision based on full and detailed information about the current\noperational  and  financial  situation  and  the  business  prospects  of  the  power  sector  in  the\nmedium term. Learning from experiences made elsewhere, MPG will first establish the legal and\nregulatory framework and an enabling business environment to create certainty for investors\nbefore soliciting private sector investments.\n61. MPG recognizes the benefits of creating a formal coordination mechanism for the reform\nprocess since effective reform management will require that a strategic and program overview\nbe maintained at the highest level throughout the reform process to ensure effective use of\nresources and to establish priorities. MPG has set up an institutional framework for managing\npower sector reform under the apex of the Steering Committee for Power Sector Reform\nchaired by the chief secretary. The members of the committee include the principal secretaries\nfor power, finance, law, and planning; secretary, finance; and chairman, MPSEB. In addition, the\njoint secretary reforms, Union Ministry of Power, and director, ADB, Department of Economic\nAffairs, have been included to ensure close coordination on power sector reforms. Reporting to\nthe committee is the Strategic Policy Unit (SPU) headed by the principal secretary, power. The\nSPU is responsible for defining the critical path for reform and for preparing a time-bound\nimplementation plan and review mechanisms, keeping in mind the institutional, financial, and\nregulatory imperatives. The SPU includes representatives from MPSEB and the Power and\nFinance ministries of MPG, and coordinates with ADB and other assistance agencies in the\nsector. Power sector experts from outside the state and representatives of consumer groups are\ninvited to provide feedback and input to the SPU on an intermittent basis. The SPU should\nideally be supported by a professional implementation task force to analyze best practices and", "17\npresent alternative scenarios considering local conditions. With the assistance of ADB, MPG is\ncurrently identifying external funding for the implementation task force and the SPU. DFID has\nexpressed general interest in supporting both.\n3.  Restriction of Free Power Supply\n62. With effect from 1 January 2001, a new MPG policy became effective reducing free\nsupply of power to agriculture consumers and single-point consumers. Under the new policy\nonly scheduled castes and scheduled tribes (SC/ST) consumers who are living below the\npoverty line and with a monthly consumption of not more than 20 kWh will receive free power\nsupply under the single-point scheme. SC/ST agricultural consumers are now only eligible for\nfree electricity supply for pumps up to 5 horsepower if they have less than 1 hectare of irrigated\nland.  As  a  consequence  of  this  policy,  about  95  percent  of  agriculture  consumers  and\n75 percent of single-point consumers are now required to pay their electricity bills fully. MPSEB\nexpects annual revenues from the agriculture sector to increase by Rs1,610 million, and from\nsingle-point connections up to Rs1,440 million once the new policy is fully implemented. The\nprojected increase is equivalent to 19 percent of total revenues from LT consumers in FY2000.\n4.  Energy Audit and Metering\n63. The MP Urja Vidheyak, 2001, or the MP Energy Act for the prohibition of unauthorized\nuse of electricity; and the assessment, compounding, and recovery of arrears and dues to\nreduce losses caused by illegal abstraction, use, consumption, and pilferage of electricity was\nenacted on 17 April 2001. A comprehensive energy audit comprising the installation of 7,500\nmeters is being implemented on all feeders up to the 11 kilovolt (kV) level; electronic meters will\nbe provided to all HT consumers. This will allow MPSEB to record and compare the energy\ninput into a specific distribution feeder with the realized revenues coming from the same feeder.\nGrouping and accounting of consumers according to distribution feeder will be implemented as\npart of the energy audit. In addition to allowing specific targeting of high loss zones for efficiency\nimprovements, the energy audit is a fundamental ingredient for distribution reconfiguration and\ncorporatization/divestment to be carried out as part of sector reform.\n64. While  preparing  for  supplying  and  installing  meters  to  all  endusers,  MPSEB  has\nlaunched a campaign to regularize unmetered connections using self-assessment of electricity\nconsumption.  Under  the  scheme,  administrative  requirements  for  official  connections  are\nrelaxed, and consumers are encouraged to self-assess their monthly electricity consumption\nand  make  payments  based  on  this  assessment.  Once  meters  have  been  installed  the\nconnections will be billed based on the meter reading. The self-assessment campaign fulfills\nthree objectives: (i) immediately increase MPSEB\u2019s revenues, (ii) lower resistance to meter\ninstallation,  and  (iii) assist  in  detecting  tampering  of  meters  if  metered  consumption  is\nsubstantially lower than that self-assessed. It also benefits poorer consumers who until now\ncould not obtain legal connections due to lack of titles to their land/housing. Under the new\npolicy,  proof  of  property  titles  is  no  longer  a  requirement  for  obtaining  a  connection  from\nMPSEB. After an interim period, all nonregistered connections will be levied with heavy fines\nand ultimately disconnected.\n5.  Internal Reforms\n65. The self-assessment scheme is part of the comprehensive measures implemented by\nMPSEB to increase the internal operational efficiencies. Simplifying procedural hurdles to obtain\nofficial  connections  will  reduce  nonmonetary  access  barriers  to  the  network,  while\nsimultaneously reducing illegal connections and thus system losses.", "18\n66. Introduction  of  grievance  procedures  to  better  respond  to  customer  needs  and  to\nincrease public participation is another step toward a commercial and competitive power sector.\nMPSEB has formed grievance redress committees at district and subdivision levels headed by\nrepresentatives  of  MPSEB  and  the  local  community.  In  anticipation  of  the  new  business\nenvironment,  MPSEB  has  implemented  measures  to  decentralize  powers  and  to  increase\nMPSEB officers\u2019 responsibility for incidents of theft in their jurisdiction. As part of the internal\nrestructuring, MPSEB banned all new recruitment and revised the retirement age from 60 to 58\nyears starting in January 2001, which immediately reduced the number of employees by about\n1,200 (of a total of 67,000).\n67. MPSEB  recently  delegated  more  operational  responsibilities.  Administrative,\ncommercial,  and  financial  responsibilities  created  on  a  graduated  scale  by  MPSEB  were\ndelegated to individual generating plants and distribution circles. For example, in an effort to\nincrease the number of high-profile customers, line extensions for HT consumers can now be\napproved by superintending engineers, and for industrial consumers up to 5 MW by regional\nchief engineers instead of requiring approval of MPSEB board members.\n68. In response to the changes resulting from the sector reforms, MPSEB is adjusting its\norganizational set-up. MPSEB\u2019s reform coordination structure mirrors MPG\u2019s, in the sense that\nMPSEB\u2019s  High-Level  Reform  Coordination  Committee  is  supported  by  a  coordination\ncommittee,  which  in  turn  collaborates  closely  with  the  Corporate  Planning  Group,  (the\ncounterparts for CIDA\u2019s EISP), which acts as MPSEB\u2019s resource center for coordination with the\nreform process and is equivalent to MPG\u2019s implementation task force.\n69. A  tariff  and  regulatory  affairs  cell  is  being  created  by  MPSEB  to  concentrate  and\ncultivate specialist expertise for the annual tariff filings and to act as the focal point for any data\nrequest by MPSERC. The expertise of senior officers assigned to the social and environmental\nmanagement cell was obtained during their work with the Corporate Planning Group on power\nsystem planning, and financial and socioeconomic analysis. Officers assigned to the project\nmanagement unit (PMU) were involved in preparing project reports for submission to ADB under\nthe project loan and have been associated with reform-related activities carried out by corporate\nplanning group. All new organizational units are staffed with officers representing generation,\ntransmission, and distribution functions with a view to the unbundling of MPSEB, and the\nexpertise and functional requirements of the new companies.\n70. The  successful  implementation  of  the  reform  initiatives  requires  a  combination  of\nfinancial support for reform adjustment costs and system improvements, and technical advice\non properly integrating the reforms into operational procedures and their implementation in day-\nto-day management of MPSEB.\nD.

Social and Environmental Measures\n1.  Social Dimensions\n74. Participatory rapid appraisal (PRA) and extensive public consultations were undertaken\nthroughout MP during appraisal of the SDP (Supplementary Appendix D). The PRA objective\nwas to investigate the impacts of the reform process on consumers, especially the poor. The\nPRA  also  examined  barriers  for  the  poor  to  access  electricity  connections.  In  addition,\nconsultations were held with three MPSEB labor unions and associations representing different\nclasses of employees to discuss the concerns of the employees with regard to the current status\nof  MPSEB  and  the  reform  process.  The  unions  expressed  concern  in  three  major  areas:\n(i) political interference in MPSEB operations, including tariff setting; noting that field staff were\noften put in a situation of implementing policies with little support for enforcement; (ii) MPSEB\u2019s\nfinancial status and allocation of resources for maintenance; and (iii) lack of generation capacity.\nUltimately, the current situation in the areas where the unions expressed concern affects the\nmorale, dedication, and incentives to enforce policies.\n75. MP has a high percentage of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes (SC/ST). They are\noverrepresented  among  households  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  tribal  population\nconstitutes  approximately  23.3  percent  of  the  total  population,  is  mainly  rural,  and  is\ncharacterized by small and marginal landholdings; forest-based occupations; and limited access\nto water resources, and infrastructure and agricultural technology including electrical irrigation\npumps. Under the new MPSEB policy on free power supply, SC/ST consumers living below the\npoverty line are eligible for the single-point scheme; the connection charge is amortized over\nfour monthly installments. This policy does not apply to other consumers living below the\npoverty line.\n76. The new mandatory metering policy of MPSEB was found to be more beneficial for low-\nincome and poor households as opposed to the flat rate tariff currently charged; the per-unit\ncharge is higher on a flat rate basis. The current schedule of load shedding combined with\nbilling on a flat rate basis is regressive in the sense that consumers experiencing more load\nshedding will be paying a higher unit rate than consumers experiencing less.\n77. The PRA findings indicate a consistent demand and willingness to pay for improved\nsupply of power services, even in remote areas, for irrigation and domestic use. This finding is\nalso confirmed by the poverty impact assessment (Appendix 6). However, the seasonality of\nagriculture  results  in  a  mismatch  of  rural  farm  incomes  and  MPSEB  billing  practices.\nFurthermore, small and marginal SC/ST farmers who have been exempted from power charges\nand who now have to pay unless they are classified as living below the poverty line are finding it\ndifficult to pay as their access to water resources and alternative income sources have declined.\nThe PRA found that while MPSEB informally implements installment-based payments of bills,\nsuch installments need to be systematized and poverty-related policies and guidelines for the\npower sector more effectively communicated to MPSEB field staff.\n78. The  PRA  found  a  substantial  number  of  illegal  connections  among  low-income\nhouseholds, which MPSEB finds difficult to legalize. These connections are partially a result of\nthe recent policy changes requiring certificates to prove \u201cbelow-poverty\u201d status, which can be\ndifficult to obtain for poorer households. While MPSEB and MPG are attempting to mitigate this\nproblem by authorizing village heads to issue the certificates, not all village heads have yet\nbeen made aware of this new scheme. However, the PRA found that the major reason for illegal\nconnections appears to be the inability of poorer consumers to pay up-front connection charges\nand associated fees in one payment, and found that 12 monthly installments would facilitate the", "21\nability of these consumers to afford the initial charges. The findings where discussed with\nMPSEB, which agreed to introduce a 12 month installment facility applicable to all consumers\nliving below the poverty line. A detailed analysis of the barriers for poor households to access\nelectricity is also provided in Appendix 6.\n2.  Environment\n79. The potential environmental impacts of the policy and institutional changes under the\nSDP as per the Reform Act were evaluated (Appendix 7). Most potential impacts are considered\nbeneficial from an environmental point of view. Policy dialogue is ongoing with MPSERC to\nenhance benefits by institutionalizing environmental management in sector regulation and to\nalso increase public participation during conceptualization of new investment projects. On the\noperational side, MPSEB has agreed to establish a fully functional social and environmental\nmanagement cell; selection of officers is ongoing. The new cell will include an environmental\nmanagement and monitoring section to ensure that the Project is undertaken, and all project\nfacilities operated and maintained in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,\nincluding ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirements. A proposed organizational setup for\nthe cell is in Supplementary Appendix E.\n80. The Project is classified as Environment Category B as it will have limited environmental\nimpacts during construction and operational stages. Based on the environmental assessments\nand  surveys  conducted  for  components  A  and  C,  the  associated  potential  adverse\nenvironmental impacts can be mitigated to an acceptable level by adequate implementation of\nthe measures outlined in the initial environmental examination (IEE); a summary is given in\nAppendix 7. Although 1.4 kilometers of the alignment of the transmission lines is forested, it is\neither degraded Grade IV forest or no tree is standing on the affected area. No endangered,\nrare,  or  threatened  species  of  flora  or  fauna  have  been  reported  in  the  project  sites.\nNevertheless, compensatory forestry will be strictly implemented in coordination with the State\nForest  Department.  Adequate  provisions  have  been  made  in  the  Project  to  cover  the\nenvironmental mitigation and monitoring requirements, and their associated costs.\n81. MPSEB\u2019s current technical specification for transformer oil and practices of reclamation\nof used transformer oil shows its capability of handling process-generated wastes to minimize\nadverse  environmental  effects  of  the  components.  MPSEB  will  comply  with  India\u2019s\nEnvironmental  Protection  Act  and  other  applicable  regulations  for  the  handling  of  used\ntransformer oil. All new transformer and capacitors purchased under the project loan by MPSEB\nmust be polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-free and specifications in the bidding documents will be\nmade accordingly.\n82. No significant rehabilitation, land acquisition, or compensation is required for the Project.\nFor  the  Jabalpur,  Khargone,  and  Mandsaur  areas  under  component  A,  site  selection  for\nsubstations and routing of transmission lines has been completed, and a land acquisition and\ncompensation  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on\ninvoluntary resettlement.22 The social assessment shows that 49 of the 62 proposed sites for\nsubstations are government owned, and will be transferred to MPSEB for nominal payments.\nThese sites are free of encroachments. The remaining 13 sites are privately owned and are\nmostly agricultural lands belonging to small-and medium-sized landholders. Field visits revealed\nthat the owners of these sites were willing to donate their land to MPSEB with the expectation\nthat their power supply will improve. However, MPSEB decided to compensate the owners in\n                  \n22ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Handbook on Resettlement.

For  the  remaining  components,  pending  final  site  selection  for  construction  of\nsubstations and routing of transmission lines, land acquisition and resettlement frameworks\nwere prepared in keeping with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. The resettlement\nframework for the Project is based on the principles that involuntary resettlement will be avoided\nor minimized where possible by exploring other alternative project designs, and where land\nacquisition is unavoidable, people losing assets, livelihoods, or other resources will be assisted\nin restoring or preferably improving their former standard of living. All those affected are entitled\nto be compensated for their lost assets, incomes, and businesses at replacement cost, and\nprovided with rehabilitation measures in keeping with the ADB policy. Lack of legal rights will not\nbe a bar to rehabilitation assistance for people affected by the Project. Compensation for ethnic\nminorities, households headed by women, and families with disabled and other vulnerable\nfamilies will be carried out with respect for their particular cultural and specific needs. The final\nland acquisition and resettlement plan will be prepared in keeping with ADB policy, and be\nreviewed and approved by ADB prior to construction activities. Implementation of the plans will\nbe monitored by the PMU, which will submit regular reports to ADB.\n \nV.  THE LOANS\nA.  The Policy Loan\n1.  Amount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n84. The  Government  of  India  has  requested  a  policy  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s\nordinary capital resources to help finance the policy component of the SDP. The loan will have a\n15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum; a\nfront-end fee of 1.0 percent, (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), conversion options that may\nbe exercised in accordance with terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations, and\nADB\u2019s  Conversion  Guidelines;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan\nAgreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow\nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an\nundertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent decision and not made\nin reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The counterpart funds to be generated\nfrom  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  from  the  Government  to  MPG  under  normal\narrangements for the transfer of external assistance. The funds transferred to MPG will be\ntreated  as  \u201cadditional\u201d  to  the  Government\u2019s  transfers  allocated  annually  to  MPG.  The\nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk in accordance with its policy.\n85. MPG is expected to incur the following costs of adjustments over the reform period:\n(i)  Payments of outstanding dues of municipalities and other local and state bodies\noutstanding as of 31 March 2001 will cost approximately Rs7,423 million ($164\nmillion) after deducting 26 percent on account of bifurcation.\n(ii)  Rationalization of electricity duty is expected to cause a revenue loss of about\nRs350  million  ($7.5  million)  each  year  in  the  next  five  years  for  a  total  of\n$37 million.", "23\n(iii)  Set-off of dues of market borrowing of MPSEB to MPG will result in costs of\nRs6,750 million ($144 million) over a five years period.\n(iv)  Set-off of cross-liabilities23 between MPG and MPSEB will result in a one-time\npayment of Rs620 million ($13.2 million).\n(v)  Reduction of debt obligations of MPSEB.\n2.

While sales revenue of MPEB has consistently increased from Rs47.3 billion in FY1998\nto Rs54.5 billion in FY2000, cash flow position has deteriorated as shown in earnings before\ninterest,  taxes,  depreciation,  and  amortization,  and  in  FY2000  revenue  narrowly  covered\noperating cost, leaving no cash available for debt service. One of the major reasons for this was\nthe high cost structure due to the high level of T&D losses, estimated at 31.6 percent in FY2000\nas compared with an estimated 19.3 percent in FY1999. This sharp increase resulted from\nreassessment of consumption of agricultural consumers. As most of agricultural consumers are\nnot  metered,  their  consumption  tended  to  be  overestimated  and  they  are  overbilled;  this\ncontributes to an underestimation of losses. A recent study by MPSEB in collaboration with\nEISP on actual consumption by unmetered consumers has revealed that the actual system\nlosses for MPSEB could be as high as 47.1 percent in FY2000.\n98. Another reason for the cash flow problems is low cost recovery as shown in Table 7. In\nFY2000, the tariff covered only 60 percent of cost of supply due to the highly subsidized tariff for\nLT consumers, particularly agricultural and domestic consumers. In addition, fuel and power\npurchase cost continually increased well above revenue increases. The lack of an automatic\nfuel or power purchase cost adjustment mechanism, which passes cost fluctuations on to\nconsumers, has also contributed to squeezing profit margins of MPEB. MPEB started to have a\nserious cash flow problem in FY1999. In response to this, tariffs were raised in March 1999.\nHowever, the increase was only sufficient to cover increasing operating costs, and MPEB\ncontinued to post substantial net losses.\n99. Until FY1999, MPEB continued to achieve 3 percent statutory rate of return on net fixed\nassets after subsidy and subvention from MPG. However, MPG was unable to budget for the\nrequired subsidy and subvention amounts, and was not even able to pay budgeted amounts in\ncash. Adjusting subsidy and subvention payments at the end of each fiscal year against MPEB\u2019s\npayments  of  liabilities  to  MPG  has  been  common  practice.  In  FY2000,  MPEB  stopped\nrecognizing unbudgeted subsidies in its accounts and was thus not able to achieve a 3 percent\nrate of return. Even after this change of accounting policy, subsidy and subvention receivable of\nMPEB stood at Rs23.3 billion as of 31 March 2001.\nii.  Financial Position of MPSEB\n100. In April 2001 the Government issued a provisional order whereby assets and project-\nrelated liabilities of MPEB would be apportioned on a geographical location basis between\nMPSEB  and  CSEB  while  non  project-related  liabilities  would  be  apportioned  based  on  a", "28\npopulation basis (MP: Chhattisgarh = 73.38:26.62). The pro forma financial figures in Table 6\nwere prepared as per this order. Accordingly, MPSEB would assume approximately 79 percent\nof  the  total  long-term  debt  of  MPEB.  On  the  other  hand,  MPSEB  would  retain  only\napproximately 67 percent of the total revenue base of MPEB, losing a substantial proportion of\nthe  high-profile  industrial  customers  while  keeping  94  percent  of  MPEB\u2019s  agricultural\nconsumers. Therefore, the Government\u2019s order further undermines MPSEB\u2019s capacity to service\nits debt obligations. Both MPSEB and CSEB have requested the Government to reconsider the\norder.\n101. Independent from the final apportionment of assets and liabilities, the new MPSEB faces\nmore serious financial problem than its predecessor. In addition to the shift in its customer base,\nT&D losses are estimated at about 49 percent in FY2001; this coupled with accumulating\nenergy dues from public sector consumers (Rs8.75 billion as of 31 March 2001), continues to\nsqueeze MPSEB\u2019s cash flow. MPG had no fiscal space to provide sufficient budgetary support\nin cash and has accumulated unpaid subsidy of Rs18.5 billion as of March 2001 (estimate after\ndeducting 26.62 percent on account of bifurcation). Consequently, with the current tariff level,\nMPSEB has been unable to fully pay its dues to power and fuel suppliers, and defaulted on its\npayment obligations to creditors.\n102. To break the vicious spiral of this circular debt, MPG agreed under the SDP to offset its\nsubsidy-related and other liabilities owed to MPSEB (Rs18.5 billion) against its loans owed to\nMPG (Rs17.9 billion). The net balance of Rs0.6 billion was paid in cash by MPG to MPSEB.\nFurthermore, MPG agreed to pay all outstanding energy dues of municipalities and other MPG\nbodies and to ensure that they will remain current with their bills. MPG will use the entire policy\nloan under the SDP to settle, in cash, municipality and other MPG arrears outstanding as of\n31 March 2001 (Rs7.4 billion). As regards dues after March 2001, MPG has committed that if\nmunicipalities and state government bodies do not make full payments of their energy dues,\nappropriations at source will be made by MPG so that the balance of receivables do not exceed\none-month equivalent of sales. These measures will help MPSEB overcome its immediate\nliquidity problem, clean up its balance sheet, repay some of its creditors, and improve its\nborrowing capacity for future investments.\n103. As of 31 March 2001, MPSEB owed approximately Rs16 billion to central power sector\nundertakings, mainly NTPC, Nuclear Power Corporation, and Coal India. Since accumulated\nliabilities to central power sector undertaking is a common problem of SEBs throughout India, a\ncommittee was set up by the Government to look into strategies for a one-time settlement of\ndebts. The committee proposed that the state governments take over the SEBs\u2019 liabilities and\nissue a 15-year tax-free bond to the central power sector creditors bearing 8.5 percent interest\nper annum with a 5-year grace period for repayment. In this securitization scheme, payment of\ncurrent dues by SEBs would need to be guaranteed by the state governments. To become\neffective, the scheme requires consent from a majority of state governments. However, some\nuncertainty exists as to whether the scheme would be workable given substantial liabilities to be\nassumed by state governments, many of which have little fiscal space. NTPC, one of the\nbiggest  nonfinancial  creditors  to  MPSEB,  has  indicated  that  regardless  of  this  one-time\nsettlement issue it would continue to supply power unless MPSEB defaults on current dues.\nb.

As shown in Table 7, average tariffs\nfor LT and HT consumers were raised by 16 percent and 13 percent respectively, resulting in an\noverall tariff increase of 11 percent due to expected change in the consumer mix from FY2001\nto FY2002. Although the new agricultural tariff is still far below the cost of supply, new tariffs are\nexpected to boost FY2002 revenue by 17 percent27 on an annual basis. Further tariff increases\nare projected to enable MPSEB to achieve at least 75 percent cost recovery by FY2007 as\nrequired by the Reform Act except for agricultural consumers and a minor bulk purchaser. The\nprojected average retail tariff per kWh for each consumer category is provided in Appendix 8,\nTable A8.2. The projection envisages that (i) a modest tariff increase will continue to be given to\nthe consumer categories being already charged higher-than-cost tariff, and (ii) tariff increase\nabove inflation rate for consumers paying tariff below cost of service until achieving 100 percent\ncost of recovery. For commercial and industrial consumers in HT and LT categories, no further\ntariff increase is assumed once the tariffs reach the breakeven point of cost of captive power\n(approximately Rs5.00/kwh). Also in September 2001, the MPG raised cess on electricity from\nRs0.01 to Rs0.10 per unit. This is expected to generate additional tax revenue of Rs1.5 billion to\nRs1.6 billion per year.\nc.  Impact of the SDP on MPSEB\u2019s Financial Projections\n106. The  projected  financial  results  also  depend  on  substantial  reduction  of  losses,\nparticularly nontechnical losses. In the projection, the current T&D losses are assumed to be\n49.0 percent in FY2001 based on the recent MPSEB estimate. The losses are projected to be\nreduced by 5 percent in FY2002, 3 percent annually up to FY 2007, and diminishing margins\nthereafter. The projected reduction of T&D losses is in line with MPSEB\u2019s comprehensive loss\n                  \n27Since new tariffs became effective on 26 September 2001, net increase of revenue in FY 2002 will be about 6.6\npercent.", "30\nreduction plan partly financed under the Project. The projection also envisages improvement of\ncollection efficiency due to computerization of the revenue management system financed under\nthe Project and the MPG\u2019s assurance under the SDP of full recovery of dues from municipalities\nand other state government bodies.\n107. Based on the MOU between MPG and MPSEB (agreed upon under the SDP), the\nprojection envisages (i) any future subsidy and subvention to be paid in cash, (ii) free power\nsupply bills to be fully reimbursed monthly, (iii) cash grant equal to electricity duties and cess to\nbe provided monthly, and (iv) additional cash injection in the form of subvention and/or capital\ngrant to be provided to the extent necessary for MPSEB to remain solvent. As MPSEB has\ndefaulted on all creditors and cannot afford to fully service its debt obligations for the next few\nyears,  it  needs  to  agree  with  lenders  and  bondholders  on  debt  restructuring  as  soon  as\npossible. Under EISP, CIDA is financing TA to prepare a debt restructuring plan for MPSEB.\nInitiation of negotiations with creditors based on the plan is a second tranche release condition\nunder the Program. In the projection, debt service obligations, which have become due and\nunpaid, as well as ones that will become due over the next three years, are assumed to be\nrescheduled in a manner reasonably acceptable to creditors.\n108. The financial projections in Table 8 and in Appendix 8 present a base case scenario\nduring SDP implementation. The projection indicates that MPSEB would be able to overcome\nimmediate liquidity shortage through additional cash in-flow from tariff increase, partial recovery\nof arrears from municipalities and state government bodies, and cash injection from MPG in the\nform  of  subsidies  and  subventions.  In  the  medium  to  long  term,  efficiency  improvement,\nparticularly  T&D  loss  reduction,  will  be  a  key  driver  for  recovery  of  financial  soundness.\nReduction of losses by 3 \u2013 5 percent annually, together with an average annual tariff increase of\nabout 6 percent28 and continued government support, is expected to bring MPSEB back to a\nbreak-even position in FY2008 and 3 percent rate of return in FY2010 on an after-subsidy and\nsubvention basis. This means that from FY2010 onward, MPG would start to phase out the\nannual subsidies and subventions. An upside scenario would be feasible if MPSERC increases\nthe agricultural tariff to achieve 75 percent cost recovery by FY2007 and MPSEB accelerates its\nloss reduction program to achieve target 22 percent by FY2007. In this scenario, MPSEB would\nachieve positive net income without subsidies and subventions by FY2006.\n3.  Implementation Arrangements\na.  Management\n109. The  MPSEB  Chairman  will  be  in  overall  charge  of  the  Project.  Day-to-day  project\nimplementation will be undertaken and supervised by the PMU, which was established in May\n2001 specifically for the Project, headed by a senior MPSEB officer. The PMU will be assisted\nby  a  team  of  consultants  to  refine  project  details,  procurement  activities,  and  project\nmanagement in general. MPSEB is in the process of expanding the staff strength of the PMU to\ncorrespond with the increased workload. Except for exceptional organizational requirements,\nthe staff assigned to the PMU will be retained for the entire duration of project implementation in\nthe PMU and any vacancy in the PMU will be filled before such vacancy is made effective. The\nPMU will be delegated decision-making powers.\n                  \n28Annual tariff increase is projected at 10 percent for LT consumers and 4 percent for HT consumers until FY2007.", "31\nb.  Implementation Schedule and Performance Review\n110. Project implementation will commence in January 2002 and be completed in December\n2005 (Supplementary Appendix J). Direct supervision of implementation and monitoring the\noperational performance of the components will be the responsibility of MPSEB. The PMU will\nprepare progress reports for the respective project components and submit them to MPG and\nADB on a quarterly basis within 20 days of the end of each quarter. The reports will contain a\nnarrative description of progress made during the period. ADB will monitor the overall financial\nand technical performance of the state\u2019s power sector, and the MPG\u2019s fiscal position. MPSEB\nwill set up a benefit monitoring unit (BMU) within and reporting to the PMU, to monitor and\nevaluate the scope, implementation arrangements, and progress of SDP achievement. The\nquarterly reporting will include socioeconomic and poverty indicators reflecting the impacts of\nthe policy and the project components on end-consumers, particularly those living below the\npoverty line. Using consulting services, the BMU will undertake an in-depth qualitative and\nquantitative assessment of the impacts of the reform on end-consumers. Outline terms of\nreference for the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix K.\nc.  Disbursement Procedures\n111. Since the disbursements under the Project will be mainly for supply of goods, ADB's\ncommitment and direct payment procedures will be used for disbursement purposes.\nd.  Reports, Accounts, and Audits\n112. MPSEB  and  the  PMU  will  prepare  separate  progress  reports  for  their  respective\ncomponents and submit them to ADB on a quarterly basis within 20 days from the end of each\nquarter. The reports will include narrative descriptions of progress made during the period;\nchanges to the implementation schedule, if any; problems or difficulties encountered and the\nremedial  actions  taken;  the  performance  of  the  project  implementation  consultants  where\napplicable; and the work to be carried out in the upcoming period. The reports will also include\nsummary financial accounts for the Project consisting of project expenditures during the period,\nyear to date, and total expenditure to date. ADB will review the implementation and operation of\nthe  Project  based  on  these  reports  and  meet  with  MPSEB  and  the  MPG  officials  at  least\nsemiannually to discuss project progress. Completion reports will be submitted to ADB within\nthree months from completion of each of the components. A project completion report will be\nsubmitted to ADB within three months of physical completion of the Project.\n113. MPSEB will have its annual financial statements, including the income statement, balance\nsheet, and sources and applications of funds statements, audited by a professional auditing firm\nacceptable to ADB. Unaudited statements will be submitted to ADB within six months and audited\nstatements within nine months from the close of the financial year. MPSEB will also submit to\nADB audited project accounts and the auditors\u2019 observations with respect to compliance with the\nloan covenants.\n4.  Procurement and Consulting Services\n114. ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines\nfor Procurement. For such procurement, bidding documents will be prepared in a manner to\nensure  maximum  competition  under  international  competitive  bidding.  Each  supply  contract,\nestimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more, will be awarded on the basis of international\ncompetitive bidding. Each contract estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $500,000 will be\nawarded on the basis of international shopping. For transmission lines and grid substations in", "32\ngeneral, separate contracts will be let on the basis of supply of materials. The contract for erection\nof transmission lines will, however, include supply of tower steel. For facilities at 33kV and below,\nmaterials and equipment will be procured under supply only contracts. Erection will be done either\nby MPSEB\u2019s own staff or under separate erection contracts to be let on the basis of local\ncompetitive bidding. A list of the major contract packages under the Project with their estimated\ncosts is attached in Appendix 9. To expedite the procurement process, advance procurement\naction was approved and MPSEB has been advised that approval of such advance procurement\naction by ADB does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing Project. The Project does not include\nretroactive financing.\n115. To assist with timely project implementation, an international consulting firm with expertise\nin  transmission  line  and  substation  construction,  and  project  management  will  be  engaged,\nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. About 72 person-months of consulting\nservices  are  expected  to  be  required  for  this  purpose  during  the  first  two  years  of  project\nimplementation. A broad outline of the terms of reference for consulting services is given in\nSupplementary Appendix L.\n116. For  implementation  of  component  D:  Computerization  of  Information  and  Revenue\nManagement System, as also to carry out benefit monitoring of the SDP, MPSEB will engage\nexternal consultants, using its own funds and procedures. If however, ADB financing is required\nfor consulting services, then ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants will be followed.\nVI.  BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Expected Impacts\n1.  Financial Analysis\n117. Financial evaluation was undertaken for components A, B, and C. The financial rate of\nreturn of each component is satisfactory compared with MPSEB\u2019s weighted average real cost of\ncapital  of  7.81  percent.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  each  component  and  its\nsensitivity analysis are summarized in Table 9. The sensitivity analysis for components A, B,\nand C confirmed that they would be expected to produce reasonable financial returns under\nvarious downside scenarios. The major assumptions used in the financial evaluation of the\nProject and detailed calculations are in Appendix 10.\nTable 9: Sensitivity Analysis of the Financial Internal Rate of Return\nScenario A B C\nBase Case 9.8% 10.0% 16.3%\na. 10% Increase in Capital Cost 8.5% 8.9% 14.7%\nb. One Year Delay 8.7% 9.0% 14.1%\nc. 10% Decrease in Tariffs 8.4% 8.7% 14.5%\nd. a+b 7.7% 8.0% 12.8%\n2.  Economic Analysis\n118. The  SDP  has  as  one  of  its  immediate  objectives  establishing  a  commercial  and\ncompetitive business environment in the power sector to promote efficiency gains and loss\nreductions. With overall T&D losses estimated at 47 percent, comprehensive reduction of losses\nis one of MPSEB\u2019s priorities. MPSEB\u2019s loss reduction strategy targets three levels: (i) energy\naudit and end-user metering, (ii) internal efficiency improvement through computerized billing\nand revenue system, and (iii) physical investments directly targeting loss reduction.", "33\n119. Benefits from loss reduction are threefold. First, they will generate additional revenue for\nMPSEB. Second, commercial loss reduction in particular will reduce power demand for different\ncustomer categories, and will thus indirectly contribute to reduced power shortages. Third,\ntechnical loss reduction in particular will result in economic resource cost savings as less units\nneed to be generated, transmitted, and distributed to supply the same amount of energy to end-\nconsumers.\n120. Project components A and B are for investment in the five distribution regions of MP with\nthe highest losses, namely, Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, and Ujjain. Component C is\ndirected at transmission system improvements throughout MP to reduce technical losses. The\nmethodology applied for the three components is similar.\n121. The economic analysis was carried out at border price level using FY2001 prices. To\nconvert  financial  cost  into  economic  cost,  taxes  and  duties  were  deducted.  No  price\ncontingencies are included in the base capital cost, but the economic capital costs include\n10 percent physical contingencies. The costs were separated into foreign exchange, indirect\nforeign exchange, and local currency costs. Local costs were further separated and specific\nconversion factors used for unskilled labor. The remaining local costs were converted to border\nprices by applying a standard conversion factor. Annual operation and maintenance cost were\nalso calculated in economic prices.\n122. The economic benefits of loss reduction were calculated separately for technical and\ncommercial loss reduction. Technical loss reduction under component A was valued at the\naverage cost of supply at LT level for FY2002, and for component C at the average cost of\nsupply at extra high tension level for FY2000, the latest year for which the breakdown is\navailable. Commercial loss reduction was valued at the increasing tariff levels up to FY2010,\nreflecting the changing relationship between average cost of supply and average tariff, which\nresults in reduction of economic subsidies over the lifetime of the Project. Benefits are expected\nto build up gradually over three years.\n123. The  base  case  economic  internal  rates  of  return  are  estimated  at  17.1 percent  for\ncomponent A, 16.8 percent for component B, and at 16.4 percent for Project component C.\nThey were calculated for 25 years, including the construction period. No residual values were\nconsidered.  Comprehensive  sensitivity  analysis,  including  calculation  of  switching  values,\nindicated that the economic internal rate of return values for all components are above the 12\npercent threshold for all adverse circumstances tested. Details of the economic analysis and the\nsensitivity analysis are in Appendix 11.\n3.  Poverty and Environmental Dimensions\n124. The current state of electricity supply and operations has serious adverse impacts on\nincome earning activities for the poor. They are affected both indirectly, through reduced wage\nemployment  opportunities,29  and  directly,  through  reduced  farm  profitability  and  household\nwelfare. The restructuring process provides an opportunity for MPSEB to review its operations\nand the impacts on consumers. For MPG, it provides an opportunity to review the impacts of the\ntariff  and  subsidy  policy  and  other  interventions  in  the  power  sector.  An  in-depth  poverty\nassessment  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  impacts  of  the  reforms  and  of  the  investment\ncomponent on the poor under the SDP (Appendix 6).\n                  \n29 This is particularly affecting the landless and the poorest of the poor.", "34\n125. The  poverty  assessment  revealed  that  the  poor  face  significant  barriers  to  access\nelectricity. The new policy of MPSEB includes applying connection charges retroactively. The\npoverty assessment revealed that the introduction of connection charges constituted a barrier\nfor the poor to access electricity. Under the current policy SC/ST consumers below the poverty\nline are eligible for a single-point scheme for which the connection charge is amortized in four\nmonthly installments. However, a majority of the poor do not fall into the SC/ST category and\nare as such not eligible for the scheme. On the basis of an affordability assessment and in\nconsultations with the poor MPSEB will introduce an interest-free 12 month installment facility\nfor all consumers below the poverty line.\n126. The current tariff and subsidy structure has hampered economic growth through its\nburden on the fiscal budget, crowding out alternative public investments, and through its burden\non the banking sector, with consequent credit squeeze for private investments. Most of the poor\ndo  not  have  electricity  connections  and  as  such  they  are  not  beneficiaries  of  subsidized\nelectricity tariffs. However, they are indirectly paying in terms of forgone investments and are\ndirectly affected by the lack of ability of MPSEB to provide good quality of services and to\nexpand the network into poorer areas. Thus, the current subsidy and tariff structure cannot be\ndefended on the basis of providing cheap services to the poor. Although the agricultural tariffs\nsubsidize  input  costs  for  the  agricultural  sector,  this  has  severely  hampered  the  ability  of\nMPSEB  to  provide  good  quality  of  services.  Tariffs  set  below  the  cost  of  supply,  without\nadequate compensation from MPG, has made load shedding financially beneficial for MPSEB\nwhereas it has adverse impacts on consumers and economic growth.\n127. Most of the poor are not connected, and those who are, experience poor quality of\nservices. Farm profitability has been especially affected by voltage fluctuations since in addition\nto reducing farm output, it has led to increased costs. The findings show that the impact of\nvoltage fluctuations has been especially costly for the poor. Load-shedding has led to reduced\nfarm output and forced consumers to diversify their energy sources, with consequent reduction\nin benefits of electricity use. The prevalence of unscheduled load-shedding, which represents\nabout  62  percent  of  the  total  number  of  power  cuts,  has  especially  been  devastating  by\nincreasing uncertainty in production and consumption activities.\n128. The new mandatory metering policy was found to be beneficial for poor consumers and\nwill act to reduce the impacts of tariff increases. Metered consumers pay a lower per unit tariff\nthan unmetered consumers. In addition, it benefits consumers who consume more electricity.\nSince  the  majority  of  the  poor  are  unmetered  and  consume  small  amounts  the  effect  is\nregressive.  These  regressive  effects  of  the  tariff  structure  are  further  reinforced  by  the\noccurrence of load shedding. Consumers experiencing less load shedding are paying a lower\nper unit charge. Metering will reduce the impacts of tariff increases on the poor. Operational\nefficiency gains from the SPD will further reduce the need for and the impact of tariff increases.\n129. The SDP is designed to improve the policy and institutional environment of the sector as\noutlined in the Reform Act with the long-term aim of improving the quality and quantity of the\npower supply. The Reform Act has positive impacts from an environmental point of view as it\noffers the opportunity to institutionalize environmental management in sector regulation beyond\nthe existing all-India statutory environmental requirements. Also, the decentralization of powers\nfor metering, revenue realization, disconnection, prosecution for theft, meter tampering, and\ndiversion of electricity to new power sector companies will facilitate adoption of measures to\nprevent energy wastage. This will contribute positively to more economic use of resources that\nwill enhance environmental conservation.", "35\nB.  Risks and Safeguards\n130. The SDP has several perceived risks:\n131. Regulatory Risk. A central aspect of power sector reform is the establishment of an\nindependent regulatory authority to ensure the commercial operation of the sector, including a\nrationalization for the tariff structure. A comprehensive program for institutional strengthening of\nMPSERC, in particular for tariff setting principles and other financial aspects is required. In the\npast, ADB supported participation of the three commissioners at an external training course and\nis currently preparing assistance to MPSERC for the drafting of rules, regulations, and licenses.\nDFID has prepared terms of reference for long-term consulting support for MPSERC and has\nalready given approval in principal; the final decision by DFID is expected before the end of\n2001.\n132. Financial Situation of MPSEB. To bring the sector to a sound commercial footing and\nto promote private investment, MPSEB will have to overcome the short-term liquidity crisis and\nimprove its financial viability in the long run. Given uncertainty of future tariff increase and\noperational  efficiency  improvements,  MPSEB  will  need  to  substantially  reduce  its  financial\nburden  through  comprehensive  financial  restructuring  with  support  from  its  stakeholders\nincluding creditors, MPG, and the Government. Mitigation measures include the following:\n(i) Settlement  of  unpaid  revenue  subsidy  by  MPG  through  a  set-off  against\noutstanding  state  government  loans  to  MPSEB  is  a  first  tranche  release\ncondition. This will leave MPSEB less leveraged and will facilitate raising new\nfunds in the market at lower cost.\n(ii) CIDA  included  analysis  of  debt  and  liabilities  and  preparation  of  an  outline\nfinancial restructuring plan under their EISP assistance to MPSEB.\n(iii) MPG and MPSEB to agree on a future payment modality for subsidies and\nsubventions over the reform period.\n133. Support for Outstanding Analytical Work. The model for the postreform sector has\nbeen agreed upon in principle. However, in addition to the financial and accounting work required\nfor the functional segregation and the distribution reconfiguration (provided by CIDA under the\nEISP), substantial work is needed to develop schemes to transfer assets, liabilities, and personnel\nto the new power sector companies and to introduce the computerized information and revenue\nmanagement system. The India country strategy program for 2001 includes three small-scale\nTAs30 and the 2002 program includes a TA for MP Power Sector Reform. The proposed scope of\nthis TA is expected to focus on developing transfer schemes concerning MPSEB, under the\nReform Act. If cofinancing for the outstanding work cannot be mobilized, ADB will make further TA\nfunds available to support the reform activities.\n134. Operational Effectiveness. The operational effectiveness of MPSEB and other power\nsector entities that will be created during the reform period will be critical in determining success\nor failure. To improve effectiveness, processes are being built into the system to strengthen the\nentities capacity to deliver over time. These include the following:\n                  \n30The TAs are for (i) corporate restructuring of MPSEB, (ii) business plan development, and (iii) capacity building for\nimproved customer responsiveness.", "36\n(i)  The composition of board of directors and senior management of new sector\ncompanies  will  be  changed  to  include  professional  expertise  from  outside\ngovernment services. The operational performance is expected to improve as a\nresult of these measures.\n(ii) Delegation of authorities to management of distribution circles benefiting from\nADB assistance is being promoted. This will increase the accountability and\nprepare employees and customers for the creation of new distribution companies\nwith a more efficient and responsive management style.\n135. Bifurcation of the Undivided State of Madhya Pradesh. Following the bifurcation of\nthe undivided state of MP, the Government issued a provisional order on the bifurcation of the\nassets and liabilities (including employees) of MPEB between MPSEB and CSEB. MPG and the\nChhattisgarh government are requesting reconsideration of the order. Further, MPSEB has\npending litigation with the CSEB on the revenues collected and retained by the latter between 1\nDecember 2000 and 15 April 2001. Since these two issues could impact on the agreement on\nthe transfer scheme(s), it has been made a third tranche condition and an assurance has been\nincluded in the loan documentation that the Government will take timely steps to resolve these\nissues (para. 149).\nVII.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n136. In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, MPG and MPSEB, have given\nthe following assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n1. General\n137. The  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  loan,  as  described  in  the\ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix, will continue to be in effect for at least the duration\nof the SDP.\n138. The Government will transfer the counterpart funds generated under the policy loan, and\nthe  loan  proceeds  under  the  investment  loan,  under  normal  arrangements  for  transfer  of\nexternal  assistance  to  MPG  and  shall  treat  such  counterpart  funds  as  an  additionality  to\ntransfers allocated annually to MPG.\n139. The Government will cause MPG to ensure that sufficient budgetary allocations are\nmade to MPSEB in a timely manner for efficient and timely implementation of the Project and\nthe SDP.\n2. Administrative\n140. MPG will, at all times, continue to emphasize, respect, and support the autonomy of\nMPSEB with respect to commercial, administrative, and operational activities.\n141. The Government and MPG will assist in expediting, issue of due permits and licenses for\nthe effective functioning of MPSEB\u2019s successor entities as may be required by law.", "37\n142. MPG and MPSEB will review with ADB the recommendations of the EISP study and other\ntechnical assistance, towards the restructuring of the power sector for its long-term administrative,\nfinancial, and economic viability, for implementation thereof in a manner satisfactory to ADB.\n143. Within 15 months from the loan effectiveness, MPG will ensure that the majority of the\nofficers in the senior management of MPPGCL, MPPTCL, and one of the established distribution\ncompanies,  are  recruited  through  open  and  competitive  selection  process  by  the  board  of\ndirectors of the respective companies.\n3. Financial\n144. MPG will make timely and adequate budgetary appropriations to meet its subsidy and\nsubvention payments to ensure that all dues are paid in cash to MPSEB (or its successor entities)\nwithin no more than six months of the raising of the claim by MPSEB or such entities.\n145. MPG  will  make  timely  and  adequate  budgetary  appropriations  to  meet  its  rural\nelectrification subsidy/subvention payments based on the MOU between MPG and MPSEB; and\nwill  continue  to  make  timely  and  appropriate  budgetary  appropriations  to  meet  MPSEB\u2019s\nbalance of receivables (excluding past dues until 31 August 2001) from municipalities and other\nlocal and state bodies so as not to exceed the immediately preceding one month\u2019s equivalent of\nsales at any time with effect from 1 January 2002.\n4. Sector Reforms\n146. MPG will ensure that MPSEB or its successor entities carry out proper metering of all\nend consumers in MP, in a phased manner for completion within four years from the date of\nloan effectiveness of the SDP.\n147. MPG will ensure that the power sector reforms under the SDP and the preparation of the\ntransfer scheme(s) are undertaken with full information and participation of all stakeholders\nincluding,  but  not  limited  to,  consumers,  utilities,  employees,  and  unions  of  MPSEB,  and\nnongovernment organizations. In doing so, MPG will also ensure that such participation includes\ninformation to the stakeholders, procuring feedback on the same.\n148. Recommendations of any employee transfer under the transfer scheme(s) will be in full\nparticipation  and  consultation  of  all  affected,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  laws  and\nregulations of the Government and MPG.\n149. The Government will take timely steps in resolution of issues relating to (i) the final\nallocation of assets and liabilities of MPSEB and the CSEB, (ii) the revenue collected by the\nCSEB from 1 December 2000 to 15 April 2001, and (iii) allocation of surplus power from CSEB\nand central sector utilities to MPSEB.\n5. SDP Implementation and Benefit Monitoring\n150. The MPG and MPSEB will undertake together with ADB, periodic reviews during SDP\nimplementation,  to  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  progress,  and\nachievement  of  the  SDP  objectives  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance\nManagement System guidelines. For this purpose, MPSEB will set up the BMU within three\nmonths of loan effectiveness.", "38\n6. Social Issues\n151. MPG and MPSEB will allow all consumers living below the poverty line to make their\npayment  for  electricity  connection  charges,  including  all  up-front  charges  associated  with\nelectricity connections, in 12 monthly installments.\n7. Successor Entities\n152. Owing to the functional segregation of MPSEB under the SDP, if at any time in the\ninterest of proper implementation of the Project, ADB, MPG, and MPSEB find it necessary,\nMPSEB will transfer its rights and obligations under the related loan documents to its successor\nentity(ies) as required, with prior approval of and on such terms, conditions, and arrangements\nas  acceptable  to  ADB,  wherefore  such  successor  entity(ies)  as  the  case  may  be,  will  be\ndeemed to be substituted for MPSEB.\n8. Consulting Services\n153. Within four months of the loan effectiveness and under its own financing, MPSEB will\nengage the domestic consultant required to implement component D of the Project.\n9. Environmental Compliance and Resettlement Issues\n154. MPSEB will establish a fully functional social and environmental management cell within\nfour months of loan effectiveness to the satisfaction of ADB.\n155. MPG and MPSEB will ensure that the Project is undertaken and all project facilities\noperated and maintained in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations of the\nGovernment  and  MPG,  the  initial  environmental  examinations,  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental\nguidelines and the Environmental Assessment Requirements.\n156. MPSEB  will  provide  ADB  with  annual  reports  on  the  monitoring  results,  permits,\nlicenses, and clearances obtained for the Project. In case of any violation of laws and standards\ncited, the report will include certification from the relevant authority that such violation has been\nrectified or an acceptable plan for correction approved.\n157. MPG  and  MPSEB  will  ensure  that  in  case  of  any  specific  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement under the Project, the Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan (where there is no\nresettlement)  and  the  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Framework  (where  there  is\nresettlement) for the various subprojects as agreed upon with ADB are implemented and due\ncompensation is paid to those affected in accordance with ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy\nand ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement (1998) as amended from time to time.\nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n158. In addition to the conditions set forth in the ADB\u2019s ordinary operations loan regulations,\nfollowing are conditions for effectiveness for the SDP loans:\n(i) Legal opinions satisfactory to ADB will have been provided for the Loan and\nProgram Agreements for the policy loan; and the Loan and Project Agreements for\nthe investment loan.", "39\n(ii) The MP state legislature will have passed supplementary budget and MPG will\nhave paid MPSEB not less than (a) Rs3,000 million out of total outstanding dues\nas  of  31  March  2001  (approximately  Rs7,423  million  after  deducting  26.62\npercent on account of bifurcation) and (b) total dues between 1 April to 31 August\n2001, owed by municipalities and other local and MPG bodies to MPSEB.\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION\n159. I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB\nand recommend that the Board approve:\n(i) the  loan  of  $150,000,000  to  India  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector\nDevelopment Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility; an amortization\nperiod of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, and such other terms and\nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft\nLoan and Program Agreements presented to the Board; and\n(ii) the  loan  of  $200,000,000  to  India  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector\nDevelopment Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility; an amortization\nperiod of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other terms and\nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft\nLoan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n14 November 2001", "40\nAPPENDIXES\nCORE\nNumber Title Page Cited On\n(page, para.)\n1 Long-Term Sector Model 41 13, 46\n2 Development Policy Letter 42 13, 46\n3 Implementation Plan for Stage I 53 13, 46\n4 Sector Development Program Frameworks 56 14, 49\n5 Project Cost Estimates 60 19, 72\n6 Poverty Impact Assessment 61 20, 77\n7 Summary Initial Environmental Examination 70 21, 79\n8 Financial Performance and Projections for MPSEB 77 30, 108\n9 Contract Packages and Cost Estimates 81 31, 114\n10 Financial Evaluation of the Project 83 32, 117\n11 Economic Evaluation 87 33, 123\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(Available on request)\nA.

Objectives  of Power  S~ctor  Reforms\n2 'he  objectives  of tr1e ;.;c\\;.l/er sector  reforms  are'\n(a) To  achieve  ccmmerciat  =fficienc:1  and  financia!  viabilit-/  so  that  the  sector  jces\nnot  absorb  \"'1adhya  Pradesh's  financial  resources  that  are  needed  for  socio-\neconomic  development;\n(b) To  improve  delivery  of services  and  acr.ieve  cost  effecti'.jeness  throl,lgh  t=chn:cal,\nmanagerial  and  administrative  restructuring  of the  utilities.\nTo  increa~e  the  operating  efficiency  of all  power  sector  utilities  thtough  greater\n(,c \\ j\ncompetition,  managerial  autonomy  ar.d higher  accountability.\n(d) To create  an  environment  which  will  attract  private  capita!,  both  domestic  and\nforeign to supplement  public sector investment;\nB. P.,pproach to the Reforms\n3.  The  legislative  basis  for  restructuring  and  regulating  the  State's  power  sector  is  tne\n~l1adhya Pradesh  Vidyllt  Sudhar  Adhin!yam  2000  (No.4  of 2001)  (the  Reform  Act)", "45 Appendix  2, page  4\n4. The key provisions  of the Act are\nIndependent  tariff  setting  and  regulation.  through  the  establishment  of  the\n(i)\nMadhya  Pradesh Electricity  Regulatory Commission;\n(ii) Compulsory  metering of all consumers;\nRecovery  of  at  least  75  percent  of the  cost  to  serve  each  consumer  category,\n(iii)\nthrough  the  tariffs  of  that  consumer  category.  progressively  over  a  period  of 5\nyears;\n(iv) Functional  segregation  of  the  sector  into  generation, transmission  and\ndistribution;\n(v) Reorganization  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board  into  several\nsuccessor  companies, to enable competition;  and\n(vi) Commercialization  of all activities  in the  sector,  including  promotion  of  prNate\nsector  participation wherever feasible and desirable.\n5.  Under  the  Act  referred  in  paragraph  3,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory\nCommission  (MPERC)  a ne',v statutory,  independent regulatory  authority  has been established\nwhich is responsible  for:\n(a) setting electricity  tariffs and determining the corresponding  performance  norms;\n(b) collecting,  verifying and disseminating  sector statistics;\n(0) coordinating  long term  PQlNer planning;\n(d) creating  and  maintaining  a  non-discriminatory  and  commercial  business\nenvironment  in this sector;\n(e) adjudicating  disputes betvveen sector entities; and\n(f) licensing.\n6.  In the power generation  segment of the sector, it is expectea that in the long-term, there\nwould  be several  generating  companies,  both public and private. The latter could be of various\ntypes including:\n(a) independent  power  producers;\n(b) cooperative  generators;\n(c) captive generating  units selling their surplus energy to the grid; and\n(d) private generating  and distribution companies.\n7.  At  present  Madhya  Pradesh's  pOller  grid  is  being  maintained  by the  MPSEB.  After\nrestructuring,  in  order  to  facilitate  povJer  pooling  and  wheeling  between  suppliers  and\nconsumers,  the State's  power grid will be maintained by the transmission  subsidiary of MPSEB,", "46 Appendix  2, page  5\nwhich  will  re  responsible  for  operation,  system  expansion  and  maintenance  of  proper\nparameters  in the grid under the supervision  of the regulator. This entity will aJso be responsible\nfor the interconnections  with other power systems of the country.\n8.  To  have  a  sustainable  power  sector  development  and  to  provide  quality  power  on\ndemand  to all consumers,  GOMP  would undertake segregation  of the generation,  transmission\nand distribution  functions  and will corporatize the utilities.  GOMP  will review the working of the\nreorganized  utilities/companies  and  will  take  measures  to  restructure  them  to  achieve\ncommercial  viability  and reduction  and elimination  of power theft within  a spe~ified time frame.\nIf the  achievement  of those  objectives  required  sufficient  disinvestments  for  professionalising\nmanagement  and fully distancing  it from Government, the same wouJd be undertaken.\nc. Private Sector Participation\n9.  The  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  reaffirms  its  commitmen~  to  encourc.ge\ninvoivement  of  private  sector  participation  in generation  and  distribution  in a i phased  manner\nthrough  a transparent  and competitive  bidding process.  In support  of this,  the State's approech\nwill  be to foster  a business  environment,  which  will  provide  a level  playing  fieid  both for the\nprivate  and  public  sectors  and  also  by  separating  sector  regulation  from  operations.  It  is\nrecognized,  however, that to provide incentives for better technical  performanCl:1,t here has to be\ncompetition  and  an  appropriate  enabling  commercial  business  environmEtnt.  As  already\nmentioned  earlier,  Madhya  Pradesh  has  established  the  Madhya  Pradesh  jState  Electriclty\nRegulatory  Commission  to make tariff setting and regulation, transparent  and apolitical, arId has\nmade metering compulsorf.  Further,  in order to create an enabling environment' GOMP has also\nenacted  a  lay,  prohibiting  unauthorized  use  of  electrical  energy  and  to  brihg  into  effect  a\ntransparent,  effective  and  speedy  mechanism  for  assessment  and  compounding  of cases  of\nillegal abstraction,  use. consumption  and pilferage of energy, and recovery of electricity  charges\nin a manner \\Nhich series  public interest and ensures fair play and justice.\nD. Tariffs\n10.  The Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  recognizes  the fact  that  there  has to be a tariff\nrationalization  if  private  and  foreign  investments  are to  be forthcoming  in the  power  sector.\nUtilities  should  operate  on commercial  principles  and earn adequate  rates of return on capital\ninvestments.  On the other  hand, grant of unrestrained freedom to fix the tariff ~y power utilities\n...villl ead to consumer  interest  being adversely affected. Looking to this Madhya Pradesh has set\nup  an  independent  regulatory  commission.  While  the  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh\nrecognizes,  on the  one  hand, the  need for the continuance  of subsidized  tariff for agricultural\nand socially  obligatory  activities  like drinking water and street lighting and lighting for urban and\nrural  poor, on the  other  hand,  it also  recognizes that these  subsidies  will  have to  be explicit,\nquantified,  reasonable  and  targeted  and  that,  while  cross-subsidization  cannot  be  fully\neliminated,  it has to be kept within  reasonable limits.  Thus, the Reform Act provides a minimum\nrecovery of 75 percent of the cost to seNe a category of consumers  has been mandated. As a\nmeasure  to  demonstrate  its  will  to  rationalize  electricity  tariffs  and  reverse  the  trand  of\nincreasing  cross-subsidization  of agriculture  consumers,  rv1P ERC  has raised the effective tariff\nfor electricity, supply  to the  agriculture  sector from Rs 1.00 per kWh to Rs.  1.20 ~er kVvh with\neffect from 5'h Oct.  2001.  This trend is expected to continue  in the years ahead. In addition, the\nGovernment  of f'v1adhyaP  radesh has restricted the provision of free power supply to single-Jight\npoint urban and rural consumers  and to agricultural consumers  'Nith purr,ps up to 5 HP effective\nJanuary 2001.", "47 Appendix  21 page  6\nE. Public  Consultations\n11.  The Government  believes  that  pO'Ner sector  reform requires  concerted  interventions  at\ndifferent  levels  of the  sector  to  make  the  reforms a success.  A  phased  approach  taking  into\naccount  the  ground  realities  and  the  available  financial  and  managerial  resources  of  the\nGovernment  and the sector  has been drafted. The Government  of Madhya  Pradesh held public\nconsultations  about  domestic  and international  experiences  't.Jith power  sector  reform and the\nmerits  of  different  sector  structures  before  it  commenced  the  preparation  of  the  Madhya\nPradesh  Reform  Act.  The  Reform  Act  was brought into force on 3 July 2001 and is the  most\nprogressive  in India todate.  Similarly,  many of reports generated  by the ADS  and CIDA-funded\nstudies  were  prepared  after  consultations  vvith  various  stakeholders  and  their  views\nincorporated.  This makes  the  Madhya  Pradesh reform program  one of the most transparent  in\nIndia.\nF. Conclusion\n12.  Only  a reliable  and  efficient  electricity  infrastructure  will  pave  the  VJ ay for  the  contir,ued\nexpansion  of  the  state's  economy  and  the  welfare  of  its  people.  The  Government  of  Madhya\nPradesh  once  again  reaffirms  its commitment  to  restructure  the  pQ\\Ner isector  along  commercial\nlines.  Given  its  vast  experience  in the  reform  process  in the  pO'\\.'ier sectors  of  its  developing\nmember  countries.  ADS  can  playa  majOr role  in assisting  Madhya  Pradesh  in restructuring  the\nsector.  On  behalf  of  the  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  I wish  to  convey  our  unequivocal\ncommitment  to  the  ~J1ac!hy.aP radesh  Power  Sector  Development  Prc~ram  and  request  you  to\nkindly  for.;vard this  letter  to the  President  of ADB  for the  purpose  of seel{ing  ADS's  assistance  for\nits implementation.\n13.

Poverty Profile\n1. The domestic electrification ratio in the new state of Madhya Pradesh is estimated at\n42 percent with 80 percent of the households electrified in urban areas and 29 percent in rural.\nPoverty is fairly equally distributed between rural (37.1 percent) and urban areas (38.4 percent).\nThus, the urban bias in electrification favors the nonpoor. Due to the lack of poverty statistics in\nconsumer data of the Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPSEB), the poverty profile\n(Tables A6.1 and A6.2) of electricity and nonelectricity users is based on primary household and\nfarm data from a socioeconomic survey carried out by Canadian International Development\nAgency (CIDA)-funded consultants during the first half of 2001. The definition of poverty used\nfor households is based on the poverty line applied for provision of food subsidies (\u201cBlue Cards\u201d\nissued by the Madhya Pradesh government [MPG]). Landholding criteria of less than 1 hectare\nhas been used to set the poverty line for farmers. Given the overall poverty profile of Madhya\nPradesh and rural/urban electrification ratios the survey sample appears to be biased in favor of\nusers and nonpoor. Some caution should therefore be used in interpreting connection ratios for\nconsumer categories. In addition to the quantitative analysis, qualitative assessments were\nmade to complement and assess the survey findings. These are based on participatory and\nindividual  stakeholder  consultations  in  the  field  carried  out  during  appraisal  of  the  Sector\nDevelopment Program (SDP).\n1. Domestic Users and Non-users\n2. Econometric  analysis  indicates  that  income  is  a  major  determinant  of  households\u2019\naccess to electricity. Income levels are substantially more important for the poor than for the\nnonpoor.  The  location  (rural/urban)  of  the  households  is  also  an  important  determinant  of\naccess for households below the poverty line. The average income of the poor with access is 46\npercent higher than the income of the poor with no access (Table A6.1). Over 36 percent of the\npoor households lack access to electricity while the corresponding figure is less than 17 percent\nfor  nonpoor.  Thus,  when  income  is  a  barrier  to  access  the  current  subsidy  structure  on\nelectricity consumption is inequitable, and would be difficult to defend on the basis of providing\ncheap and affordable services to the poor. Barriers to access for the poor will be discussed in\nparas. 4 to 7.\nTable A6.1: Poverty Profile \u2013 Domestic Consumers\nPoor Households Nonpoor Households Total Households\nAccess Mean Income Mean Income Mean Income\nShare (Rs/month) Share (Rs/month) Share (Rs/month)\nElectricity 63.5% 1,379 87.3% 5,860 83.3% 5,289\nNo Electricity 36.5% 942 12.7% 1,690 16.7% 1,426\nTotal Sample 16.7% 1,219 83.3% 5,332 100.0% 4,644\nPoverty line: Expenditure< Rs 12,000/household/Year.\nSource: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\n2. Agricultural Users and Non-users\n3. About 6.6 million farmers live in the new state of Madhya Pradesh. Over 4 million, or\n61 percent, are marginal farmer with landholdings of less than 1 hectare. Although landholdings\nare on average similar for poor electric pump users and nonusers,1 difference in income earning\n                                                          \n1Evidently, since the upward landholding boundary is set at < 1 ha for the poor farmers.", "62\nAppendix 6, page 2\nis significant. A majority of the poor nonusers do not own land but engage in share cropping2\nand supplement farm income by temporary wage employment. Poor users own one 3 or 5\nhorsepower (HP) electric pump. About 30 percent of the poor farmers share capital costs, initial\nconnection  charges,  and  electricity  bills  with  other  farmers.  Sharing  was  not  found  to  be\ncommon among nonpoor farmers who tend to own more than one pump above 5 HP. All\nnonusers own diesel pumps irrespective of whether they are poor or not. However, the type of\npump is a significant determinant of farm income and profitability. About 80 percent of the\nnonpoor farmers reported that groundwater levels had dropped in the last two years. For poor\nfarmers  the  corresponding  figure  is  87  percent.  While  nonpoor  farmers  reported  that\ngroundwater levels are on average 36 feet, poor farmers are exposed to about 20 percent lower\nwater levels (43 feet). The low capacity irrigation pumps owned by the poor farmers make them\nmore vulnerable to the low water levels.\nTable A6.2: Poverty Profile \u2013 Agricultural Consumers\nPoor Farmers Nonpoor Farmers Total Farmers\nMean Mean Mean Mean Mean Mean\nAccess\nShare Income Landholding Share Income Landholding Share Income Landholding\n(Rs/month) (ha) (Rs/month) (ha) (Rs/month) (ha)\nElectricity 80.3% 1,468 0.68 91.7% 5,028 5.43 90.0% 4,556 4.81\nNo Electricity 19.7% 1,263 0.67 8.3% 2,937 4.14 10.0% 2478 3.13\nTotal Sample 14.9% 1,447 0.68 85.1% 4,854 5.33 100% 4,348 4.64\nha = hectare.\nPoverty line: Marginal farmers with less than 1 hectare in landholdings.\nSource: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\nB.  Barriers to Access\n4. Four main barriers for the poor to access electricity services were identified during the\nparticipatory  stakeholder  consultations  with  the  poor.  First,  insufficient  new  investments  to\nextend grid-connections to poor rural areas. Second, in areas where the grid exists, connection\ncosts, associated transaction costs (including waiting time and number of applications) and up-\nfront charges are major barriers for the poor to connect. Third, business practices of property\nrights have excluded a large share of urban and rural poor since they could not produce the\nnecessary land titles required to obtain official connections. However, this policy has recently\nbeen changed. The fourth is related to the poor quality of electricity supply and load-shedding,\nwhich acts to deter connections since cost savings and other benefits will be limited. Load-\nshedding will further be discussed in paras. 8 to 10\n5. The socioeconomic survey included questions to examine issues related to access to\nelectricity. Table A6.3 presents the responses from nonusers. Forty-six percent stated they\nwould not be able to afford electricity. Affordability is consistently perceived to be higher for the\npoor than the nonpoor. Nearly 60 percent of the poor stated that they would be able to pay while\nthis was only 48 percent for the nonpoor. The perception of affordability is related to the\nwillingness to pay, which also is higher for the poor than for the nonpoor (Table A6.9). Quality of\nhousing is perceived to be a problem for both poor and nonpoor. Econometric analysis confirms\nthis conclusion and results indicate that a house made of thatch is 13 percent less likely to have\nelectricity.\n6. A substantial number of nonusers reported that they have applied for but not received\nconnections. This may indicate the presence of transaction costs associated with connections.\n                                                          \n2The landowner will share input costs in exchange for a share in crop output.", "63\nAppendix 6, page 3\nSome respondents stated that they did not need electricity. Surprisingly, this response was\nhigher among the rural nonpoor than among the poor.\nTable A6.3: Perceived Reasons for Not Having Electricity (Domestic)\nRural Urban\nReason Total\nPoor Nonpoor Poor Nonpoor\nNo connections nearby 44.7% 37.8% 32.1% 27.5% 36.1%\nApplied but waiting 31.6% 18.9% 50.0% 47.5% 32.8%\nCannot afford 39.5% 53.7% 38.9% 40.0% 45.6%\nHouse not appropriate for wiring 26.3% 29.7% 21.4% 15.0% 24.4%\nDo not need/want it 5.3% 16.2% 14.3% 12.5% 12.8%\nPoverty line: Expenditure< Rs 12,000/household/Year.\nSource: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\n7. On average, users spend 5 percent of their income on electricity. As expected the\nexpenditure  share  is  higher  for  the  poor  (8  percent)  than  for  the  nonpoor  (3  percent)3.\nConsultations with nonusers show that kerosene expenditure shares vary between 7 and 15\npercent of household income. Since kerosene is mainly used for lighting purposes expenditure\nsavings from electricity are quite substantial.4\nC.  Load-Shedding and Quality of Supply\n8. The prevalence of load-shedding causes consumers to diversify their energy sources,\nwhere kerosene is the main substitute for electricity. Over 90 percent of electricity users in rural\nareas reported that they also use kerosene for lighting. In urban areas, load-shedding is less\nfrequent, and thus, the use of kerosene by electricity users is less common (Table A6.4). Forced\ndiversification of energy sources incurs additional costs and reduces benefits of electricity.\nUltimately, load-shedding affects the willingness to pay for electricity. Where consumers are\ncharged on a flat rate basis, load-shedding leads to a higher per unit cost and reduces the net\nbenefits per unit consumed. This reinforces the adverse effects of load-shedding on consumer\u2019s\nwillingness to pay for electricity.\n9. Load-shedding in rural areas is nearly six times more frequent than in urban areas\n(Table A6.4).  Scheduled load-shedding is announced to consumers in advance of the season\nto allow consumers to adjust and plan for it. Still, scheduled load-shedding disrupts activities,\nincreases  loss  of  income,  and  increases  costs.  However,  the  unscheduled  load-shedding\ncauses the most serious problems for consumers as it increases uncertainty in production and\nconsumption activities and does not allow consumer to adjust activities in advance. Between 10\nto 15 percent of total load-shedding and 62 percent of the number of power cuts in rural areas\nare unscheduled (Table A6.4).\nTable A6.4: Distribution of Load-shedding by Area\nRural Semi-urban Urban\nItem\nScheduled Unscheduled Total Scheduled Unscheduled Total Scheduled Unscheduled Total\nMin.

Eighty-seven percent of the agricultural consumers reported that the quality of supply\nhad deteriorated during the last year. The poor quality of supply appears to affect poor and\nnonpoor  equally  (Table  A6.5).  However,  the  consequences  of  power  cuts  and  voltage\nfluctuations tend to be more serious for the poor. Over 60 percent of the farmers reported pump\nburnouts as a result of voltage fluctuations (Table A6.6). Nearly 20 percent experience more\nthan one burnout during Rabbi season. Poor farmers are more vulnerable to pump burnouts\nbecause they do not have the same adjustment and coping capabilities as nonpoor farmers.\nThey seldom own more than one pump and the loss in crop production can be devastating.\nVoltage fluctuations in power supply also have a bearing on the maintenance cost of pumps.\nTable A6.5: Quality of Supply\nPoor Nonpoor Total\nItem\nDomestic Farmer Domestic Farmer Domestic Farmer\nPower Cutsa 67.8% 82.5% 56.1% 84.0% 57.6% 83.8%\nVoltage Variations 47.8% 65.7% 44.1% 71.2% 44.6% 70.5%\nVoltage Drop 55.7% 52.5% 52.9%\nMean hrs of Power 6.3 7.0\nSupply / Day\na Unscheduled power cuts for farmers.\nSource: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\nTable A6.6:  Effects of Voltage Fluctuations\nPoor Nonpoor Total\nNo. of Pump Burn Outs\nShare Share Share\n1 39.6% 44.5% 43.0%\n2 8.2% 14.8% 14.3%\nMore than 2 7.0% 3.4% 4.1%\nTotal 54.8% 62.7% 61.4%\n       Source: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\nD.  Impacts of Reforms\n1. Connections for the Poor\n11. The new MPSEB policy includes applying connection charges retroactively. The MPSEB\nconsumer base data indicate that the introduction of connection charges has resulted in a\nreduction of single point consumers. This can partially be explained by an increase in other\nconsumer groups. However, consultations with the poor and MPSEB staff show that poor\nconsumers have been disconnected as a result of inability to pay up-front connection charges.\nThis may have resulted in an increase of illegal connections and thus, a consequent reduction in\nrevenue for MPSEB. Under the current policy, scheduled caste and tribe consumers living\nbelow the poverty line are eligible for the single point scheme for which the connection charge is\namortized (interest-free) in four monthly installments. However, this policy does not apply to\nother  consumers  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Consultations  with  poor  \u2018illegal\u2019  consumers\nshowed that these consumers are not eligible for the single point scheme and up-front costs\nassociated with various charges, such as meter charges, service connection charges, etc, are\ntoo high for them to afford in one monthly installment. On the basis of the consumers self-\nassessment and on their level of income, MPSEB will introduce an interest-free 12 month\ninstallment facility to address the ability of the poor to pay up-front charges.\n2. Metering of the Poor\n12. As part of the loss reduction program, MPSEB has introduced mandatory metering of\nconsumers. The metering policy has been found to be beneficial for poor and low-income\nconsumers as opposed to the flat rate tariff currently charged. A poor urban consumer who has", "65\nAppendix 6, page 5\ntwo light bulbs and a fan is billed Rs115 per month on a flat rate basis. With metering, the\ncorresponding bill on a per unit basis would amount to Rs87 per month, or 24 percent less.5\n13. Load-shedding combined with flat rate tariffs is regressive in the sense that consumers\nexperiencing more load-shedding are paying a higher unit rate than consumers experiencing\nless. Over 50 percent of domestic poor consumers and 84 percent of the poor farmers are not\nmetered (Tables A6.7 and A6.8). In addition, of the ones who do have meters, few receive\nregular readings. Thus, when load-shedding increases, bills are not adjusted.\nTable A6.7: Metering of Domestic Consumers\nRural Urban\nItem Total\nPoor Nonpoor Poor Nonpoor\nMetered 43.5% 65.0 56.5% 82.7% 80.6%\nMeter is Working 94.2% 87% 99.7% 96.1% 96.4%\nMeter  is  Read  on  a  Regular 7.2% 21.4% 43.5% 58.2% 57.0%\nBasis\nBilled According to Meter 13.0% 18.1% 45.7% 54.7% 54.0%\n      Source: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\nTable A6.8: Metering of Agricultural Consumers\nRural Total\nItem\nPoor Nonpoor\nMetered 16.2% 13.0% 13.4%\nMeter is Read on a Regular Basis 54.2% 34.7% 37.8%\n          Source: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey.\n3. Willingness to Pay\n14. Over 60 percent of agricultural consumers are willing to pay more for better quality\nsupply. Poor farmers are particularly willing to pay more if services improve (65.4 percent). The\nwillingness to pay more is also higher for the poor than for the nonpoor. Similar results are\nfound for domestic consumers. Sixty-seven percent of domestic consumers are willing to pay\nmore, as are nearly 75 percent of the poor, and 66 percent of the nonpoor. The poor are on\naverage willing to pay 27 percent more than their current bill for better quality supply, while the\ncorresponding figure is 23 percent for the nonpoor (Table A6.9).\nTable A6.9: Willingness to Pay More\nDomestic Agriculture\nVariable\nPoor Nonpoor All Poor Nonpoor All\nMean WTPM 27.3% 22.7% 23.2% 23.8% 22.9% 23.0%\n    Source: Calculations based on the socioeconomic survey\n15. The willingness to pay for better quality service is governed by a number of factors, such\nas the costs and loss in income that occurs as a result of voltage fluctuations and load-\nshedding. Econometric simulations (Table A6.10) show that metering followed by income are\nthe most important factors influencing the willingness to pay for domestic consumers. Urban\nconsumers are willing to pay more than rural consumers, even when controlling for income\ndifferences. For agricultural consumers groundwater levels and voltage variations are the most\nimportant  factors  while  metering  is  not  significant.  For  poor  farmers,  these  factors  are  of\nparticular importance. Groundwater levels are directly related to electricity consumption for\nirrigation purposes. Low capacity pumps in combination with low groundwater levels affect the\nability to irrigate. In addition, flat rate charges induce inefficient utilization of both electricity and\nwater. While nonpoor farmers invest in higher HP pumps, this option is not economically viable\n                                                          \n5The light bulbs are assumed each to be used for 8 hours a day and the fan for 15 hours.", "66\nAppendix 6, page 6\nfor poor farmers and thus the distribution of water resources is directly effected by the ability to\neffectively utilize electricity for irrigation purposes. Thus, flat rate charges cause inefficient\nutilization and unequitable distribution of both electricity and water resources. The latter effect is\nreinforced by the fact that poor farmers tend to live in more drought-prone areas.\nTable A6.10: Willingness to Pay (dependent variable)\nDomestic Agriculture\nVariable\nPoor Nonpoor Poor Nonpoor\nIncome 0.142 0.390 0.132 0.068\n(4.11) (11.59) (1.98) (2.83)\nMetering 0.498 0.372 0.03 0.03\n(2.43) (5.66) (1.23) (1.46)\nFrequency of Meter 0.079 0.04 0.143 0.112\nReading (1.99) (1.22) (1.73) (1.92)\nFrequency of Power Cutsa -0.110 -0.035 -0.069 -0.074\n(-2.73) (2.62) (2.23) (-2.76)\nFrequency of Voltage -0.082 -0.107 -0.19 -0.123\nFluctuations (-2.67) (-2.069) (-2.00) (-2.60)\nGroundwater (feet) 0.30 0.23\n(1.98) (4.24)\nRural/Urban -0.154 -0.197\n(-2.69) (-4.28)\n*t - statistics in parenthesis\na Power cuts for farmers include unscheduled only.\nSource: Estimations are based on the socioeconomic survey data.\n16. The results show that load-shedding is an important factor but less so than voltage\nfluctuations. This is because voltage fluctuations reduce farm profitability by reducing crop\nyields and by increasing pump maintenance costs. The econometric simulations indicate that\nthe reduction in farm profitability due to voltage fluctuations is likely to be higher than the loss of\nincome that occurs as a result of load-shedding. The results show that the effects of the poor\nquality of supply and services affect poor farmers more than the nonpoor. Overall, eighty-eight\npercent of the farmers expect increased yields as a result of improved quality of supply; 50\npercent expect at least a 20 percent increase in yields.\n17. The  econometric  results  in  Table  A6.10  show  that  the  impacts  of  the  various\ninterventions of improving the quality of services vary between different consumer categories.\nWhile the number of poor connected to the grid might be relatively small, the results show that\nthe magnitude of the direct impacts of reduced voltage fluctuations are especially pro-poor. For\ndomestic consumers, a meter-based tariff, followed by reduced load-shedding, was found to be\nthe  most  pro-poor  intervention.  The  importance  of  voltage  fluctuations  was  less  for  poor\ndomestic consumers due to the limited ownership of appliances.\n5. Conclusions\n18. The current state of electricity supply and operations has serious adverse impacts on\nincome earning activities for the poor. They are affected both indirectly, through reduced wage\nemployment  opportunities6  and  directly,  through  reduced  farm  profitability  and  household\nwelfare. The restructuring process provides an opportunity for MPSEB to review its operations\nand the impacts on consumers. For the state government, it provides an opportunity to assess\nthe impacts of its subsidy policy and other interventions in the electricity sector. Given the\nsignificant barriers for the poor to access electricity, it is difficult to defend the current subsidy\nstructure on the basis of providing cheap services to the poor. Most of the poor do not have\nelectricity connections and are not benefiting from subsidized electricity tariffs. However, they\n                                                          \n6This particularly affects the landless and the poorest of the poor.", "67\nAppendix 6, page 7\nare indirectly paying in terms of forgone investments and are directly affected by the lack of\nfinancial ability of MPSEB to expand the network into poorer areas.\n19. The lack of reforms would have a disastrous effect on farmers\u2019 ability to cope with the\npoor quality of supply in combination with low groundwater levels. This would particularly affect\nthe poor who are less able to cope with the uncertainty that unscheduled load-shedding brings.\nAbsence of tariff reform would be expected to continue draining the state government budget,\nand thus, increase the opportunity costs in terms of investing in other sectors more beneficial for\npoverty reduction.\n20. While tariff restructuring is necessary to improve the quality of supply, the impacts of\nsuch increases on the poor are significantly reduced by introducing meter-based tariffs. In\naddition, the improved quality of supply would lead to decreased expenditure on kerosene. The\nwillingness to pay higher tariffs, especially by the poor, reflects high adjustment and opportunity\ncosts of the poor quality of electricity supply. Further reducing the ability of MPSEB to maintain\nnetwork systems would result in increased unscheduled load-shedding and uncertainty for\nconsumers and reduced benefits of electrification. Tariffs set below the cost of supply, without\ncompensation from the state government, reduces the ability of MPSEB to purchase bulk\npower. Every sold unit is a loss and thus, load-shedding under the current tariff regime is\nfinancially beneficial for MPSEB while adversely affecting consumers.", "POVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nMatrix 1:

Introduction\n1. The Sector Development Program (SDP) includes a policy loan (the Program) and an\ninvestment loan (the Project). The SDP seeks to establish appropriate policy and institutional\nenvironment to improve the governance of the power sector in Madhya Pradesh (MP) . The\nProject consists of (i) subtransmission and distribution system strengthening (component A); (ii)\nconversion of low voltage lines to 110 kilovolt (kV) (component B), (iii) transmission system\nstrengthening (component C), and (vi) setting up of a computerized information and revenue\nmanagement system (component D). A description of the Project is given in para. 71 and\nSupplementary Appendix C.\n2. The SDP is classified as Category B due to the limited impacts of the Program and\ncomponents A, B, and C of the Project. The Program\u2019s potential environmental impact, and in\nparticular of the MP Reform Act, was evaluated and an impact analysis prepared, showing that\nmost  potential  environmental  impacts  are  considered  beneficial  (Table  A7.1).  Initial\nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  conducted  by  MPSEB  for  components  A  and  C.\nConsultations were held with related agencies, and interviews were carried out with farmers and\nother stakeholders. This summary IEE presents the major findings of the IEEs and discussions\nwith  concerned  government  officials.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  summary  IEE,  an\nenvironmental impact assessment is not required for the components.\n3. This report describes the existing environment in the area where the components are to\nbe implemented; the likely environmental impacts of the components; and the various measures\nthat will be undertaken by the Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPSEB) during the\ndesign,  construction,  and  maintenance  stages  to  mitigate  any  potential  significant  adverse\nenvironmental  impacts.  Some  of  the  measures  such  as  the  selection  and  survey  of  the\nalignment for the transmission lines have already been started by MPSEB.\nB. Description of the Environment\n4. The proposed transmission system of component C will pass through the whole state of\nMP. Component A will upgrade and expand the existing substation capacity and distribution\nlines in Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, Khargone, Mandsaur, and Ujjain.\n5. MP is located in the center of India and is one of the biggest state in the country. Except\nfor the valley of the Narmada and Tapti, MP consists of a plateau with mean elevation of about\n500 meters above sea level, interspersed with mountains of the Vindhya and the Satpura\nranges. The main river systems are the Betwa, Chambal, Indravati, Mahanadi, Narmada, Sindh,\nand Tapti. The area is part of a peninsular plateau consisting of sedimentary and metamorphic\nrocks, and is structurally part of the peninsular block. The area is geologically stable and not\nprone to earthquakes.\n6. The MP climate is extreme in the north, temperate and breezy in the plateau, and\ngenerally hot and humid in the eastern and southern plains. Summer is hot, with temperatures\nranging from 22oC to 48oC, while winter is mild, with temperatures ranging from 4oC to 23oC.\nThe low-lying area of Baghelkhand and Gwalior plains have lighter soil; and the Narmada valley\nis formed by deep rich alluvial deposits.", "71 Appendix 7, page 2\n7. About  35  percent  (154,497  square  kilometer  [km2])  of  the  total  geographical  area\n(443,496 km2) is under forest cover. The forest cover consists of 82,700 km2 (54 percent) of\nreserve forest and 66,678 km2 (43 percent) of protected forest, with the rest, about 5,119 km2 (3\npercent), classified as other forest.1 There are 9 national parks and 22 wildlife sanctuaries in\nMadhya Pradesh. In the subproject areas, the notable wildlife species are jackal, fox, and\nmonkey. No endangered or rare species of flora or fauna are reported in the subproject areas.\nC. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Environmental Impacts Due to Project Location and Design\n8. Potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  transmission  lines  and\nsubstations can be avoided or minimized through careful route and site selection. Preliminary\nsite selection was done based on the topographic sheets of the Survey of India and Forest\nAtlas2. For the selection of the optimum route or substation site, consideration was given to\nensure that the route: (i) minimizes human resettlements; (ii) does not affect monuments of\ncultural or historical importance; (iii) does not create a threat to the survival of any community\nwith special reference to tribal communities; (iv) does not affect any public utility services like\nplaygrounds or schools; (v) does not pass through any sanctuaries, national park, etc; and,\n(vi) minimizes damage to existing forest resources.\n9. As a rule, alignments are sited 10-15 km away from major towns, whenever possible, to\naccount for future urban expansion. Similarly, forests are avoided whenever possible. When not\npossible, a route that will minimize damage to the existing forest resources is selected in\nconsultation  with  the  local  divisional  forest  officer.  Alignments  in  the  subprojects  avoided\nwetlands and unstable areas. MPSEB undertook the route selection for individual transmission\nlines in close consultation with representatives from the State Forest Department. Alternative\nalignments were considered to ensure that disruptions to environmentally sensitive areas would\nbe  minimal.  Clearances  from  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  (MOEF)  are  being\nprocessed for the use of 3.78 hectares of forestland for the right-of-way (ROW) of transmission\nlines. Land values are not expected to be affected, as the selected line route generally passes\nthrough uninhabited areas, cultivated lands, and forests.\n2. Environmental Effects Related to Construction\n10. Under component C, only two transmission lines will pass through forested areas in\nMandsaur (1.0 km, 2.7 hectares in Gunjaliya Protected Forest,) and Indore (0.4 km, 1.08\nhectares in Main Vindhya Reserved Forest). This could not be avoided due the presence of\ntowns and villages and vast area of forestland in the two districts. However, no endangered,\nthreatened,  or  rare  species  of  fauna  and  flora  are  recorded  in  the  forest  affected  by  the\ntransmission line route. Divisional forest officers of the State Forest Department and executive\nengineer Extra High Tension (Construction and Maintenance) of MPSEB have prepared a joint\n                                                \n1 The Indian Forest Act, 1927 regulates the classification and declaration of different categories of forests. The state\ngovernment may constitute any forestland or wasteland, which is the property of Government or over which the\nGovernment has proprietary rights, or to the whole or any part of the forest-produce of which the Government is\nentitled, a reserved forest or protected forest in the manner provided in the act. A reserved forest usually has good\nquality of woods, and the right of people in it is very limited until a clearance is obtained. A protected forest is\nusually near villages or human settlement where people are entitled to the existing forest activities, such as\nfuelwood collection and grazing. Clearance procedures for development activities in both forests are the same.\n2  Government of India. Survey of India, Forest Atlas. Delhi.", "72\nAppendix 7, page 3\ninvestigation report for each of the two forest areas where the two transmission line will pass.\nThe two reports conclude that the forest that will be affected is either degraded Grade IV forest\nas in the case of Gunjaliya Protected Forest, or without trees standing on the ground as in that\nof Main Vindhya Reserve Forest. MPSEB has obtained the first stage clearance from MOEF for\nusing the land of Gunjaliya Protected Forest for ROW. Clearance for Main Vindhya Reserved\nForest is being processed. With provision for compensatory forestry, the overall forest condition\nwill improve.\n11. To mitigate losses to existing forests, clearing of the transmission line ROW will be done\nunder the supervision of the Forest Department, and low canopy seed trees and shrubs will be\nkept intact if they do not interfere with tower erection and line installation. The wood will be sold\nby the Forest Department, which will retain the proceeds from the sale. MPSEB will provide\nconstruction crews with fuelwood or alternative fuels as a precaution against collection of\nfuelwood from the nearby forest. Local forest department personnel will assess the risk of\npoaching during construction and take appropriate action. Guard stations will be established, as\nneeded, at the entrance to forested areas. Since the affected forest is mostly revenue forest and\nis currently accessible, this impact may not be significant. Nonetheless, MPSEB staff will report\nto the Forest Department any noticeable encroachment resulting from the Project.\n12. Most of the route will pass through agricultural lands or wasteland. According to the\nElectricity (Supply) Act, 1948, no land acquisition is required for placing transmission towers on\nprivate  land.  However,  any  damage  will  be  duly  compensated.  Associated  impacts  on\nagricultural land will be restricted to the construction phase and will be temporary in nature.\nAgricultural land will be lost permanently at the base of the transmission tower, estimated at\n0.2\u20131.0 square meters per average farm holding. After construction, agricultural land within the\ntransmission line corridors can be used again for farming purposes.\n3. Environmental Effects During Operation\n13. Three-meter wide strips of land under each conductor will be cleared and maintained as\nmaintenance ROWs. Lopping of trees will be carried out with the assistance of the Forest\nDepartment to ensure that the required clearances are maintained throughout the stretch of the\ntransmission lines. This will reduce the chances of forest fires due to electric sparks.\n14. To minimize the risk of accidents and exposure to electric fields, houses will not be\nallowed within the ROW and under the 220 kV and 132 kV double circuit lines. Disturbed areas\nduring the construction of transmission towers will be rehabilitated to minimize soil erosion.\n15. MPSEB has discontinued procurement of poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) transformer\noil since 1974. Pure hydrocarbon mineral oil has been used since then. New transformers and\ncapacitors to be purchased under the Project will not have any adverse environmental impacts.\nNone of the transformers to be replaced will be disposed of. Instead, they will be used in other\nsubstations where loads are less. Used transformer oil will be collected and reclaimed by\ncontractors through the Office of Stores and Purchase. Scrap will be collected and disposed of\nin compliance with the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, and applicable regulations and\nrules.", "73 Appendix 7, page 4\nD. Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n16. For  component  C,  the  EHT  construction  circles  and  divisions  are  responsible  for\nimplementation and supervision of the construction of new transmission lines and substations.\nThese divisions will ensure that the Project will comply with best environmental and engineering\npractices  during  the  construction  phase.  The  EHT  line  maintenance  and  substation\nmaintenance  circle  and  divisions  are  responsible  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  new\ntransmission lines and substations.\n17. Monitoring activities include patrolling and thermo vision scanning. Monthly preventive\nmaintenance will be carried out to identify and resolve problems related to cooling oil, gaskets,\ncircuit  breakers,  vibration  measurements,  and  other  activities.  Monitoring  results  will  be\npublished monthly, including a report on the corrective actions taken.\n18. As  part  of  the  normal  duties  of  the  concerned  divisional  forest  officer  and  staff,\nmonitoring of impacts on ecological resources will be carried out. Monitoring of compensatory\nforests  will  be  established  in  coordination  with  the  Forest  Department,  and  MPSEB  will\nundertake environmental monitoring in accordance with the Government\u2019s environmental and\nsocial regulations and rules.\n19. For component A, a field level monitoring committee will be looking after the construction\nwork, operation, and maintenance of the subtransmission and distribution system; and ensure\nthat the management of any scrap will comply with the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, and\nother applicable regulations and rules.\n20. In  addition,  MPSEB  will  establish  a  fully  functional  social  and  environmental\nmanagement  cell  within  four  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  new  cell  will  include  an\nenvironmental management and monitoring section to ensure that the Project is undertaken and\nall project facilities operated and maintained in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and\nregulations.\nE. Conclusions\n21. Based on the environmental assessment and surveys conducted for the subprojects,\nassociated potential adverse environmental impacts can be mitigated to an acceptable level by\nadequate implementation of the measures as stated in the IEEs. Although part of the affected\narea for the alignment of the transmission lines is forested, it is mainly lower grade forest, and\nno  endangered,  rare,  or  threatened  species  of  flora  or  fauna  are  recorded.  Nevertheless,\ncompensatory forestry will be strictly implemented in coordination with the Forest Department.\nAdequate provisions have been made in the Project to cover the environmental mitigation and\nmonitoring requirements, and their associated costs.\n22. The Project will strengthen the establishment of the State Power Transmission System\nof the MP. Overall, the social and environmental impacts associated with the two subprojects\nare  limited  to  the  construction  period  and  can  be  mitigated  to  an  acceptable  level  by\nimplementation  of  recommended  measures  and  by  best  engineering  and  environmental\npractices.", "74 Appendix 7, page 5\nTable 7.1: Evaluation of the Madhya Pradesh Power Reform Act, 2001\n           for Potential Environmental Impacts\nPolicy/Institutional change Potential Remarks\nEnvironmental\nImpacta\nSet up regulatory authority (MPSERC) with + An independent regulatory authority is assumed\nindependence ensured by specifying to be able to withstand political pressure on\nprofessional qualifications of members, tariff setting and other regulatory functions,\nprohibition of members from concurrently or thereby enabling cost recovery, which in turn\nsubsequently holding government office, and would give appropriate price signals for energy\nsafeguards against conflict of interest conservation.\n Functions of MPSERC include tariff setting, + The functions of MPSERC encompass those\nensuring quality of service, efficiency, safety, necessary for setting up a competitive supply\nperspective planning, promoting competition, side for the electricity industry, planning to\nadjudicating or facilitating dispute resolution, ensure least-cost supply over the long-run, cost\ncoordination with environmental regulatory recovery through tariff policies, safety, and\nauthorities and evolve policies/procedures for strengthened environmental regulation.

General\n1.  The projected financial statements are in current terms. The domestic and international\ninflation  rates  in  the  projections  are  presented  in  Table  A8.1.  The  rupee  is  assumed  to\ndepreciate against the dollar at the end of every fiscal year by the difference between the two\ninflation rates according to \u201cpurchasing power parity theory.\u201d Forecasted foreign exchange rates\nare also given in Table A8.1.\nTable A8.1: Inflation and Foreign Exchange Rates\nItem FY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009 FY2010\nInflation Rate\n  Domestic(%) 6.5% 6.5% 6.5% 6.5% 6.5% 6.5% 6.5% 6.5% 6.5%\n  International(%) 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4%\nForeign Exchange Rate 47.0 48.9 50.8 52.9 55.0 57.2 59.5 61.9 64.3\n(Rs/$)\nB.  Income Statements\n1.  Sales Revenues\n2. The Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPSERC) issued a tariff\naward in September 2001 whereby the overall average tariff will be increased by 11percent\ncompared with the average tariff of Rs2.32/kilowatt-hour (kWh) in FY2001. Based on this,\nrevenue in FY2002 is projected to be approximately 6.6 percent higher than the revenue with\nthe previous tariffs. Thereafter, it is assumed that tariff will be revised at the beginning of each\nyear. Among low tension (LT) consumers, domestic, waterworks, agriculture, and street light\nconsumers are currently charged below the cost of supply. A tariff increase above inflation rate\nis assumed for these consumers until full cost recovery is ensured. However, for agricultural\nconsumers, 75 percent cost recovery would be achieved in FY2010 under the base case and in\nFY2007  for  the  upside  scenario.  Since  most  of  high  tension  (HT)  consumers  are  already\ncharged more than the cost of supply, a modest increase is projected except for waterworks and\ntwo minor bulk consumers (rural electrification cooperatives and border villages). Particularly for\nindustrial and commercial consumers that have the option to switch to captive generation, no\ntariff increase is envisaged once the tariffs reach a breakeven point with cost of captive power\n(approximately  Rs5.00/kWh).  Under  the  base  case  scenario,  full  recovery  of  cost  will  be\nachieved  by  FY2009.  Projected  electricity  tariffs  net  of  electricity  duty  and  sales  tax  are\npresented in Table A8.2.\nTable A8.2: Projected Average Cost of power and Consumer-wise Tariff\n(Rs/kWh, excluding electricity duties and sales taxes)\nItem FY2001 FY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009 FY2010\nA.

Table A8.3 provides forecasted consumption growth on an unrestricted basis. Due to the\nsluggish local economy, only marginal demand growth is expected for HT consumers. The\nsharp  decrease  in  FY2001  for  LT  consumers  is  due  to  reassessment  of  agricultural\nconsumption. Consumption by LT consumers is expected to show a big increase in FY2002\nbecause  of  legalization  of  illegally  connected  agricultural  consumers.  Otherwise,  demand\ngrowth corresponding to overall economic growth of the state is envisaged for LT consumers. In\nthe projection, due to limited power purchase capability, power cuts between 5 to 20 percent are\nenvisaged for the first three years except for railways, coal mines, and waterworks.\nTable A8.3: Unrestricted Consumption Growth (%)\nItem FY2001 FY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009 FY2010\nLT Consumers -36.0% 20.3% 4.7% 4.7% 5.1% 5.1% 5.2% 5.5% 5.6% 5.6%\nHT Consumers 0.1% 0.6% 1.5% 3.6% 4.3% 4.5% 5.2% 5.3% 5.6% 5.6%\n   Total -25.8% 12.8% 3.6% 4.4% 4.8% 4.9% 5.2% 5.4% 5.6% 5.6%\nSource: MPSEB, Staff estimates.\n4.  Efficiency gains are to be realized by reducing of transmission and distribution losses\nand improving collection efficiency. Substantial reduction of transmission and distribution losses\nfor the first five years is to be mainly driven by nontechnical loss reduction through full metering,\nenergy audit, and tariff rationalization. Modest but continuous reduction of losses is expected to\nfollow as benefit of technical loss reduction program financed partly under the Project will\nmaterialize.

Interest and principal payments on the outstanding loans, which have become due and\nunpaid and will become due by FY2003, are assumed to be rescheduled and rescheduled loans\nbe fully repaid over 7 years. Other loans that will become due after FY2003 will be repaid as per\noriginal  amortization  schedule.  All  outstanding  loans  from  MPG  will  be  written  off  against\nsubsidy receivables from MPG in FY2002, resulting in net payment of Rs620 million from\nGOMP to MPSEB.

The major assumptions used in the financial evaluation of the investment Project are\ndiscussed in this appendix.\nA.       General\n2.  The financial evaluation of the Project was carried out on an incremental basis and also\non a subproject basis due to its discreet nature. Impact of tax payment is not considered for\ncalculation of benefit and weighted average cost of capital since the Madhya Pradesh State\nElectricity Board (MPSEB) will not be in a position to pay income taxes. All prices are in\nconstant September 2001 value. Foreign exchange rate is assumed at Rs47.00 to $1.00.\n3.  The capital cost of each subproject and its disbursement schedule were reviewed during\nthe Appraisal mission. Physical contingency is assumed at 10 percent of the base cost.\n4.  MPSEB\u2019s cost of capital is calculated for the Project as a whole. The Project will be\nfinanced by foreign debt (60 percent) and local debt. The cost of debt for the Project in rupees is\n12 percent and 11 percent, respectively, for the ADB loan and domestic commercial loans. The\nweighed average cost of capital is estimated in real terms and shown in Table A10.1.\nTable A10.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital\nSource Amount Cost Weighted\n(Rs million) (%) (%)\nADB Loan 9,400 9.38 6.51\nDomestic Commercial 4,151 4.23 1.30\nLoan\nWeighted Average 7.81\nCost of Capital\n  Source: MPSEB, Staff estimates.\nB.

The Sector Development Program has as one of its immediate objectives to establish a\ncommercial and competitive business environment in the power sector to promote efficiency\ngains and loss reductions. Overall system losses in Madhya Pradesh are estimated at 47\npercent, comprising 22 percent technical and 25 commercial losses for a total estimated loss of\n16,857 million units. However, regional data of losses show high discrepancies between the\ndifferent distribution areas. Gwalior (64 percent) and Ujjain (60 percent) districts have the\nhighest distribution system losses, with Indore following close behind with an estimated 52\npercent loss and Bhopal and Jabalpur at 48 percent and 46 percent. Project components A and\nB support physical investments for technical and commercial loss reduction in those regions.\nThese physical investments are an integral part of the comprehensive loss reduction strategy\ncurrently being implemented by the Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPSEB). The loss\nreduction strategy of MPSEB is targeting three levels, (i) energy audit and end-user metering to\ngain more accurate loss estimation data to identify the distribution circles with the highest\nlosses, (ii) internal efficiency improvement through computerized billing and revenue system\nand increased staff responsibilities for reducing theft and meter tampering, and (iii) physical\ninvestments directly targeting loss reduction.\n2. Component  C  supports  upgrading  and  rehabilitation  of  state  transmission  system\ncomponents to reduce technical losses throughout the state. Load-flow analysis for 9 of the\nproposed  132  33  kilovolt  (kV)  substations  found  an  average  loss  reduction  value  of\n11 megawatt (MW) per substation with the lowest value at 4.6 MW and the highest at 16 MW. In\nthe economic analysis a value of 3 MW of loss reduction for the 25 substations was used, which\nestimates benefits conservatively. In addition, a reduction of 57 MW peak-load transmission loss\nhas also been included in the analysis.\n3. Benefits from loss reduction are threefold. First, they will generate additional revenue for\nMPSEB and contribute to an improvement in the financial situation, which will ultimately result in\nan improved power supply situation. Second, commercial loss reduction in particular will reduce\npower demand for different customer categories according to their respective price elasticity of\ndemand, and will thus indirectly contribute to a reduction of power shortages. No analysis of\nprice elasticity has been carried out for Madhya Pradesh and the currently available data\nappears insufficient to calculate appropriate values. Third, technical loss reduction in particular\nwill result in economic resource cost savings as less units need to be generated, transmitted,\nand distributed to supply the same amount of energy to end-consumers.\n4. The methodology of economic evaluation for all subprojects is similar. The economic\nanalysis was carried out at border price level using FY2001 prices. To convert financial cost into\neconomic cost, taxes and duties were deducted. No price contingencies are included in the\nbase capital cost but the economic capital costs include 10 percent physical contingencies. The\ncosts were separated into foreign exchange, indirect foreign exchange, and local currency\ncosts. Local costs were further separated and a specific conversion factor of 0.85 was used for\nunskilled labor. The remaining local costs were converted to border price level by applying a\nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.9.  Annual  operation  and  maintenance  costs  were  also\ncalculated in economic prices as a percentage of the total capital investment cost. However, no\noperational and maintenance cost were included for component B since the conversion of\nexisting low tension (LT) lines into 11 kV does not create any incremental cost.\n5. The economic benefits of loss reduction were calculated separately for technical and\ncommercial loss reduction. Technical loss reduction under component A was valued at the\naverage cost of supply at LT level for FY2000, and for component C at the average cost of\nsupply at extra high tension level for FY2000, the latest year for which the breakdown is", "88\nAppendix 11, page 2\navailable. Commercial loss reduction was valued at the increasing tariff levels up to FY2010,\nreflecting the changing relationship between average cost of supply and average tariff, which\nresults in reduction of economic subsidies over the lifetime of the Project.  Benefits are assumed\nto build up gradually over three years.\n6. The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for component A is estimated at\n17.1 percent, for component B at 16.8 percent, and for component C at 16.4 percent. The\nEIRRs were calculated for 25 years, including the construction period. No residual value was\nconsidered. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis and calculation of switching values indicates\nthat the EIRR values for all three project components are above the 12 percent threshold for all\nadverse circumstances tested. Implementation delay was tested by assuming that the buildup of\nbenefits over a three-year period will only commence after finalization of construction.
