By  2015,  this  had  risen  to  about  72%  with  per  capita  electricity  consumption \nreaching 371 kilowatt-hours per annum.3 The gross domestic product of Bangladesh  has been \ngrowing at a rate of over 6% consistently during 2005\u20132015. Meeting the need for reliable and \naffordable electricity is a challenge for Bangladesh as it seeks to sustain economic growth and \nconsolidate its transition to middle-income country status by 2021.4 To support inclusive growth \nand  development  as  well  as  the  creation  of  more  and  better  jobs,  the  government  has  set  a \ntarget of electricity for all by 2021, and is working across the electricity generation, transmission, \nand distribution value chain to enhance improved delivery of electricity and meet the expected \ndemand of 19 gigawatts (GW) by 2021.5 \n \n4. \nIncreasing  power  generation  capacity.  Expensive  liquid  fuels,  such  as  diesel  and \nfurnace  oil,  have  proliferated  particularly  since  2009  and  contributed  about  20%  of  the  power \ngeneration  in  2015.  This  increase  in  capacity  contributed  to  electricity  generation  capacity \ncrossing 13 GW in 2015 (more than double the installed capacity in 2009) and ended the rolling \nblackouts  in  major  cities.  Between  2007  and  2015,  retail  electricity  tariffs  in  Bangladesh  have \nincreased  by  about  7.9%  annually,  but  have  been  inadequate  to  cover  the  increased  cost  of \npower.6 In  the  generation  subsector,  long-term  planning  is  focused  on  increasing  the  installed \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, \n2017\u20132019.  Manila.

Bangladesh is ranked 107th in the 2015 Global Competitiveness \nIndex ratings behind most South Asian countries on account of several factors, including infrastructure constraints. \n5  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. 2011.  Power System Master Plan \n\n2010. Dhaka. An updated master plan is under preparation and expected to be finalized in 2017. \n\n6  The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) purchases all electricity and sells this to distribution utilities, \nincluding  the  Dhaka  Electric  Supply  Company  Limited  (DESCO)  and  the  Bangladesh  Rural  Electrification  Board \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ninter-country \n\nthe  creation  of \n\ngenerating  capacity,  including  rehabilitation  and  efficiency  improvement  of  the  existing  public \nsector  gas-fueled  power  plants  and \ntransmission  grid \ninterconnections.  Bangladesh  is  also  executing  plans  to  set  up  imported  liquefied  natural  gas \nterminals and gas and coal power plants. There are also investments planned in grid-connected \nand  off-grid  solar  power  generation. 7  These  measures  support  scaling  up  and  diversifying \ngeneration capacity through a range of financing sources, including through the private sector. \nThis momentum in generation capacity growth is expected to be maintained, with about 7 GW of \ngeneration  capacity  to  be  installed  by  2021.  This  would  reduce  dependence  on  liquid  fuel \nsources and facilitate  a transition to a lower  cost  trajectory  for  power  purchase costs  over the \nmedium term. \n \n5. \nStrengthening  transmission  network  coverage.  The  Power  Grid  Company  of \nBangladesh  Limited  (PGCB)  is  responsible  for  the  national  transmission  grid  in  Bangladesh. \nThe  south-west  part  of  Bangladesh  is  a  high-growth-potential  region  for  economic  corridor \ndevelopment  as  well  as  a  location  for  multiple  power  plants.  There  is  one  existing \ninterconnection  crossing  the  Padma  River  and  connecting  the  eastern  and  western regions  of \nBangladesh  at  230  kilovolts  (kV).  A  second  high-voltage  interconnection  across  the  Padma \nRiver  between  the  southwest  regions  and  Dhaka  would  improve  reliability  and  permit  efficient \npower flows over the national transmission network. \n \nDistribution  system  improvement  in  Dhaka.  Dhaka  city  has  been  one  of  the  major \n6. \nbeneficiaries  of  the  improved  power  availability  since  2010.  The  Dhaka  Electric  Supply \nCompany  Limited  (DESCO)  services  about  half  the  city  and  surrounding  areas,  and  has \nprogressively reduced its distribution losses from 27.0% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2015, which places it \namong the best city-based utilities in South Asia. This has been achieved through a relentless \nfocus on reducing commercial losses and increasing the share of its  medium voltage network. \nDESCO  is  now  focusing  on  improving  its  ability  to  monitor  and  control  its  city  distribution \nnetwork and improve the quality of customer service and network utilization. \n \n7. \nEnhancement  of  rural  distribution  network.  Bangladesh\u2019s  rural  electrification \ncommenced  in  1977  with  a  few  rural  areas  electrified  through  a  program  supported  by  the \nUnited  States  Agency \nthe  Bangladesh  Rural \nElectrification  Board  (BREB),  the  highest  rural  electrification  agency  responsible  for  financing \nprocurement and technical oversight of the palli bidyut samitis (PBSs)8 that are responsible for \noperation,  billing,  and  collection  in  rural  areas.  The  rural  electrification  network,  with  about  15 \nmillion  customers,  accounts  for  over  42%  of  power  consumption  in  the  country  and  is \nresponsible  for  serving  industries,  irrigation,  and  domestic  demand  in  rural  areas.  Distribution \nloss levels in rural areas are at about 12.5% in 2016, lower than the 15.0% loss level in 2009, \nand  expected  to  reduce  to  about  10.0%  by  2021,  driven  by  investments  in  loss  reduction  and \nthe  recently  approved  plan  to  decentralize  and  manage  widespread  rural  operations  at  a \nregional  level.  Sales  are  growing  at  11%  annually,  and  about  0.5  million  new  consumers  are \nbeing  connected  annually  to  the  rural  distribution  network.  To  meet  its  target  of  100% \nelectrification  by  2021,  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  has  embarked  on  a  large-scale  rural \nelectrification program supported by development partners since 2011. The Japan International \n\nInternational  Development \n\nthrough \n\nfor \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \n(BREB).  The  BPDB  has  not  been  able  to  pass  on  the  full  cost  of  liquid  fuel  power  purchase  to  the  distribution \nsector. \n\n7  Bangladesh has a successful program for off-grid electrification using solar home systems that has helped improve \n\naccess to electricity. Projects for large utility-scale grid-connected renewable energy are under consideration. \n\n8  At the end of fiscal year 2016, there were 77 PBSs or  rural electricity cooperatives that purchase power from the \nBPDB  and  sell  it  to  retail  consumers  at  33  kV  and  lower  voltages.  They  are  responsible  for  maintaining  the \ndistribution infrastructure created by BREB. \n\n\fCooperation  Agency  and  the  World  Bank  have  undertaken  upstream  high  voltage  rural \nelectrification  projects.  The  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank  is  providing  $100  million  of \nfinancing  for  downstream  last  mile  customer  connections  for  rural  electrification.  BREB  has \nsought assistance to enhance the midstream capacity of the rural electrification network as well \nas rehabilitate and improve sections of the network that are over 20 years old and using wooden \ndistribution  poles  with  low-capacity  conductors.  These  investments  are  needed  to  ensure \ndelivery  of  increasing  requirement  of  power  and  meet  customer  demand  in  an  efficient  and \nreliable manner.  \n \n8. \nCapacity development for sector planning and regulation.  Under the 7th Five Year \nPlan,  over  8,400  circuit  kilometers  (km)  of  transmission  lines  and  over  120,000  circuit  km  of \ndistribution  lines  are  to  be  constructed  and  rehabilitated.9 The  government  expects  that  about \n90% of the population would be served through the grid by 2020. Capacity development of the \nsector  agencies  on  medium-term  transmission  planning,  distribution  system  planning,  loss \nmonitoring,  and  feasibility  studies  for  new  generation  projects;  and  to  consolidate  recent \nprogress on tariff regulations would be needed. \n \n9. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is a key development partner in the power sector of \nBangladesh  and  has  been  active  in  supporting  investments  in  power  generation,  efficiency \nimprovement,  international  power  interconnections,  and  improvement  of  transmission  and \ndistribution networks. ADB has supported power generation capacity addition and cross-border \nconnectivity  in  western  Bangladesh.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2016\u20132020 for Bangladesh, which highlights the need to strengthen the transmission \nand distribution network and improve access to electricity.10  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  will  be  100%  access  to  power  by  2021  and  improved  power  sector \nsustainability  in  Bangladesh  by  2030.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  Perspective  Plan  of \nBangladesh,  2010\u20132021:  Making  Vision  2021  a  Reality,11 and  the  Power  System  Master  Plan \n2010  (footnote  5).  The  outcome  will  be  improved  access  to  efficient  and  reliable  electricity \nsupply in Bangladesh. Performance indicators are in Appendix 1. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe outputs of the project are (i) national transmission network in southern Bangladesh, \nstrengthened by PGCB through the construction of a 174 km high-voltage, 400 kV transmission \nlink  between  southwest  Bangladesh  and  Dhaka;  (ii)  distribution  network  improved  in  DESCO \nservice areas through design and installation of control systems; (iii) distribution network in rural \nareas of Bangladesh, including the capacity of end-users, improved to support increase in safe, \nefficient,  and  productive  electricity  usage  in  BREB  service  areas;  and  (iv)  capacity  in  power \nsector  agencies  enhanced,  including  on  new  project  design  and  improved  regulatory \ncompliance.12 \n \n\n                                                \n9  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning, Planning Commission. 2015. 7th Five Year Plan, FY2016\u20132020: \n\nAccelerating Growth, Empowering Citizens.

Goods, equipment, and civil works financed by ADB will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).        \nADB-funded consultants will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Each  executing  agency  has  established  a  project \nmanagement unit for project preparation, implementation, monitoring, and reporting to ADB and \nthe  government.  The  Power  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Power,  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources \nwill  coordinate,  through  Power  Cell,  with  relevant  sector  agencies  for  output  4.

The feasibility report \n17. \nfor component 1, the transmission line, was prepared for PGCB by an external consultant and \nindependently reviewed. Component 2, the control system for DESCO, would support enhanced \ndistribution  system  management  and  improve  the  reliability  of  the  distribution  network.  Under \nthe  loan,  the  control  system  would  be  procured  and  implemented  with  international  consulting \nsupport. Component 3, comprising the physical investments in rural electrification, was prepared \nbased  on  feasibility  studies  undertaken  at  the  PBSs  by  consultants,  and  reviewed  and \naggregated at BREB. The reports were assessed during project preparation through on-ground \nsurveys and reviews. The rural electrification investments identified under the project are part of \nthe  government\u2019s  7th  Five  Year  Plan  (footnote  9).  A  consulting  firm  would  be  appointed  to \nmonitor implementation and to support loss reduction and improvement in reliability for BREB. \nComponent  4  covers  priority  sector  studies  through  Power  Division  and  rural  electrification \ninitiatives  for  productive  and  safe  energy  usage  and  capacity  building  of  utility  staff  through \nBREB. Climate change risk assessment is expected to be high as the project area is monsoon-\naffected,  with  a  possibility  of  extreme  weather  events  such  as  floods.  The  detailed  design  will \nreview and incorporate elements to address these risks. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n18. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.16 The gradual decline in the availability of domestic natural gas \nfor  the  power  sector  has  resulted  in  an  increased  dependence  on  smaller  projects  with \nexpensive liquid fuel (diesel, furnace oil) from 2007 to 2016. Liquid fuel now contributes 20% of \nthe power generation mix and a disproportionately high share of fuel expenses. The expansion \nplan for Bangladesh is based on base-load power plants and regional power connections. For \nthe PGCB investment, the economic benefit of the transmission link with southern Bangladesh \nwould be through resource cost savings on power generation and the improved reliability of the \ntransmission  network.  For  DESCO,  the  economic  benefit  is  derived  from  improved  ability  to \nreduce the  number  and duration of  interruptions through  the  proposed  investment.  For  BREB, \nbenefits  include  the  reduction  of  system  losses  and  increased  electricity  consumption  by  new \nand existing consumers. 17   \n \nAll costs and benefits have been expressed in constant 2016 prices. Capital costs and \n19. \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  were  taken  from  the  financial  data,  with  appropriate \nadjustments  to  remove  taxes  and  price  contingencies.  Components  1,  2,  and  3  were \neconomically  viable  when  economic  analyses  were  undertaken,  resulting  in  economic  internal \nrates of return of 14.5% (component 1), 13.6% (component 2), and 26.6% (component 3). The \noverall project provided an economic internal rate of return of 24.7%. The project is resilient to \nchanges  in  the  parameters,  including  10%  increase  in  capital  costs,  20%  increase  in  O&M \ncosts, construction delays, cost increases, and combined changes. The analysis demonstrates \nthe economic feasibility of the project. \n \n\n                                                \n16 ADB.1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n17 ADB.  2013.  Cost-Benefit  Analysis  for  Development:  A  Practical  Guide.  Manila  (Chapter  8:  Appraising  Electricity \n\nProjects). \n\n \n\n\fFinancial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \n20. \nthe  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects. 18  Financial  viability  was  assessed  by \ncomparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the  project  over  the  life  of  the  project.  The \nbenefits for PGCB are based on the electricity transported over the transmission assets valued \nusing  the  tariff  set  by  the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (BERC)  and  using  the \napproved  transmission  tariff  methodology.19 For  DESCO,  the  benefits  are  from  the  creation  of \nassets  that  earn  returns  for  the  company  as  per  the  BERC\u2019s  tariff  regulations.  For  BREB,  the \nbenefits  are  from  the  increased  sale  of  power  to  both  new  and  existing  consumers  over  the \nenhanced rural distribution network. \n \n21. \nCosts used to determine the financial internal rate of return  (FIRR) included the capital \ninvestment,  O&M  costs,  taxes,  and  duties  to  install  and  operate  the  project.  The  estimated \nweighted average cost of capital is 1.8%. The FIRRs of components 1, 2 and 3 were calculated \nto be 3.5%, 4.6%, and 5.0%, while the FIRR of the total project was calculated to be 4.7% and \nexceeds the weighted average cost of capital. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse changes in \nthe underlying assumptions was also assessed and the project is considered financially viable. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nExecuting  agencies  were  assessed  on  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and  financial  management \nrequirements. PGCB, DESCO and BREB have ongoing ADB and other donor-funded projects. \nPower  Cell,  an  arm  of  the  Power  Division  has  undertaken  recruitment  of  consultants  and \nsupported coordinating capacity building under previous donor-funded projects, including ADB. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged  corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. Procurement contracts financed by ADB \nare subject to prior ADB review and include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, PGCB, BREB, DESCO, and the Power Division of the Ministry of Power, \nEnergy and Mineral Resources. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n24. \nThe  financial  management  risk  is  considered  substantial  and  an  action  plan  has  been \nprepared  to  address  this.  The  BERC  and  the  government  made  effective  the  electricity \ntransmission  and  distribution  tariff  regulations  in  June  2016.  This  establishes  a  transparent \nmechanism for the periodic review and reset of tariffs to cover costs and improve the financial \nsustainability  of  the  PGCB,  DESCO,  and  BREB.  PGCB  and  DESCO  are  listed  on  the  Dhaka \nis  a \nStock  Exchange  and \nsemiautonomous body operating under the BREB 2013 Act approved by Parliament. The BREB \nboard has been expanded to bring in additional expertise, and it is undertaking a restructuring \nby  setting  up  eight  zones  to  manage  the  decentralization  of  operations.  The  project  would \nsupport enhancing capacity for internal controls, tariff-setting, asset-mapping, and monitoring of \nADB-supported  investments.  All  executing  agencies  have  executed  similar  projects  previously \nand  are  capable  of  managing  funds  flow,  disbursement  procedures,  accounting,  and  financial \n\nfinancial  parameters  are  disclosed  quarterly.

Counterpart  funds  and  their  terms  and  conditions  from  the \ngovernment to the executing agencies have been approved.20 \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nBangladesh  is  the  eighth  most  populated  country  in  the  world  with  a  population  of \naround 160 million. Nearly 47% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture. The rate of poverty \nreduction  has  accelerated  with  extreme  poverty  declining  significantly  in  both  urban  and  rural \nareas,  with  the  proportion  of  rural  population  living  in  extreme  poverty  dropping  from  44%  in \n1992 to 21% in 2010. This can be attributed to more rapid gross domestic product growth, faster \nrate of urbanization, rising labor productivity and wages, a shift from low-return agricultural labor \nto nonfarm employment, and growth in export industries. \n \n26.  \nThe  Perspective  Plan  of  Bangladesh,  2010\u20132021  (footnote  11)  outlines  a  target  of  per \ncapita electricity consumption of 600 kilowatt-hours per year by 2021. To achieve this, sufficient \nelectrical  power  at  affordable  prices  is  a  key  prerequisite  and  is  enunciated  in  the  goal  for \nelectricity  access.  The  project,  particularly  the  component  on  rural  electrification,  will  enhance \nreliable  access  to  electricity  and  contribute  to  economic  growth  in  rural  areas.  About  875,000 \nhouseholds  will  benefit  from  the  distribution  investments  by  2020,  with  a  broad  range  of \nindividual and household level impacts accruing to women and children. In  addition, under the \nproposed  grant,  support  will  be  provided  to  develop  new  energy-based  businesses  in  rural \nareas,  including  those  led  by  women.  Support  for  improved  safety  and  awareness  for  the \nefficient use of electricity will target end-users who tend to be mostly women and address their \nspecific concerns. The project will generate jobs for local communities during construction and \noperation  of the physical infrastructure and adopt gender targets to promote women's equitable \nparticipation  in  project  related  employment  opportunities,  including  in  areas  such  as  GIS  and \nasset  mapping.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  given  the  above \ninterventions.   \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nThe  project  outputs  were  assessed  for  their  environmental  and  social  impacts.  For  the \n400 kV transmission line, a total of 865 hectares of land would be temporarily affected under the \nright-of-way.  Social  surveys  undertaken  along  the  right-of-way  showed  that  no  physical \ndisplacement  was  envisaged  and  the  impact  was  not  significant.  The economic  impact  due  to \nthe  loss  of  crops  and  trees  would  be  compensated.  The  transmission  line  may  cross  over  18 \nhouseholds and PGCB has agreed to flexibility in route alignment and positioning of individual \ntowers  to reduce  the  impact  on these  households.  Potential  environmental  impacts  are  mostly \ntemporary, predictable, and reversible; and can be mitigated through adherence to national and \ninternational  standards, design criteria,  and implementation  of  the  environmental management \nplans  (EMPs).  The  transmission  towers  across  the  Padma  River  will  be  constructed  on \nplatforms (associated facilities) provided by the Bangladesh Bridge Authority under an ongoing \nproject and due diligence on the approved environmental impact assessment report found it to \nbe  in  compliance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  A  covenant  is  included  to \nfacilitate  verification  of the mitigation measures for  the  platforms.  Due  diligence has confirmed \nthat  the  land  required  for  receiving  bays  at  the  Aminbazar  site  is  in  the  possession  of  PGCB, \nand  no  resettlement  impacts  are  expected.  The  DESCO  component  would  be  based  in  the \nexisting  premises  of  the  DESCO  building  and  would  have  minimal  environmental  and \nresettlement impacts. \n                                                \n20 Executive  Committee  of  the  National  Economic  Council  clearance  received  for  PGCB,  DESCO,  and  BREB \n\ninvestments in November 2016. \n\n\fThe impact of the rural electrification component is expected to be minor. Rehabilitation \n28.  \nof existing 33 kV, 11 kV, and 230-volt (V) lines would require replacement of old infrastructure \nwith  new  poles,  conductors,  and  insulators.  The  work  would  be  taken  up  on  road  sides  and \nalong  existing  rights-of-way  and  there  could  be  temporary  disruption  during  installation  and \nrehabilitation.  BREB  and  the  PBSs  will  follow  national  waste  disposal  regulations  and  put  in \nplace  mechanisms  to  handle  waste,  including  used  oil,  wood,  ceramic  insulators,  and \nconductors.  The  distribution  line  extensions  at  low  voltages  (230  V  and  400  V)  would  require \nextensions of not more than 100 meters and would not require displacement of people or impact \nproperty,  and  there  is  flexibility  on  the  location  of  new  poles.  Construction  of  PBS  buildings \nwould  be  on  land  owned  by  PBS.  BREB  has  implemented  similar  projects  with  other  bilateral \nand multilateral agencies. The capacity-building component would not cause safeguard impacts. \n \n29.   Environment  approvals  were  received  for  the  project  components  in  2016.  Based  on \nsocial assessments, no indigenous peoples are expected to be affected by the project. Surveys, \nand consultations conducted for subprojects did not identify any indigenous peoples territories \nor their natural and cultural resources within the boundaries earmarked for construction of the \nproject  components.  Based  on  due  diligence,  the  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the \nenvironment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for  indigenous  people. \nThe  project  safeguard  impacts  have  been  adequately  assessed  and  mitigation  measures  and \nentitlement  matrix  have  been  developed  commensurate  to  the  impacts.  Consultations  were \nundertaken at project locations, and views and opinions received taken into consideration. Initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  including  EMPs  and  a  resettlement  plan  have  been \nprepared following the Safeguard Policy Statement and Bangladesh regulations. The EMPs and \nresettlement  plan  budgets  have  been  approved  and  are  sufficient  to  ensure  the  proper \nimplementation  of  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures.  They  will  be  updated  as  necessary  if \nunanticipated  impacts  are  identified  during  implementation.  The  executing  agencies  will \nestablish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism.  The  executing  agencies  have  the  capacity  and \ncommitment  to  manage  the  social  and  environmental  risks.  The  safeguard  documents  are \ndisclosed on the ADB website. The implementation of the EMP and the resettlement plan will be \nmonitored  by  the  executing  agencies,  and  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB \nsemiannually.  In  the  event  of  any  change  during  implementation,  executing  agencies  would \nupdate the initial environmental examinations, including the EMP and the resettlement plans. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 21 Based  on  an  overall  assessment,  the \nbenefits and impact from the project outweigh the costs. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nNon-timely availability of counterpart funds \nfor BREB  \nInadequate  increase in wheeling charges \nfor transmission and distribution charges to \nmeet revenue requirements and the \nservicing of loans \n\nDelays in procurement and contract award \ngiven the large number of packages for \nBREB \n\nApex government approvals for BREB projects were received in \nNovember 2016. \nNotification of tariff regulations by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory \nCommission in June 2016 allows utilities to file periodically for tariff \nincreases.
