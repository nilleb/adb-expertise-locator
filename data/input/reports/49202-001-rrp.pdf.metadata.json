The  project  will  focus  on  reconstructing  disaster-resilient  schools,  building \ncommunity  capacity  to  cope  with  future  disasters,  and  providing  microcredit  to  recover \nproductive capacities. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nOn  25  April  2015,  a  7.8  magnitude  earthquake  struck  Nepal,  causing  widespread \ndestruction  and  loss  of  life.  The  initial  earthquake  was  followed  by  aftershocks  and  another \npowerful quake on 12 May 2015. The earthquake affected 31 out of 75 districts in Nepal. Among \nthe affected districts, 14 in the central and western regions with a total population of 5.4 million \nwere most severely affected. 2 \n \nDisaster  needs  assessment  and  response.  The  Government  of  Nepal  and \n4. \ninternational  and  bilateral  donor  agencies  responded  quickly  and  jointly  undertook  a  Post \nDisaster  Needs  Assessment  (PDNA). 3  The  overall  damages  in  all  of  the  affected  districts \ninclude  8,790  deaths  and  over  22,300  injured  (footnote  3).    Nearly  500,000  houses  were \ndestroyed and 250,000 damaged (footnote 3). The total value of disaster effects, including direct \ndamages  and  indirect  losses,  is  estimated  at  NRs706  billion.  Of  that  amount,  NRs517  billion \n(73% of the total effects) represents the value of destroyed physical assets, and NRs189 billion \n(27%  of  the  total  effects)  reflects  the  losses  and  higher  costs  of  production  of  goods  and \nservices arising from the disaster. \n\n \n5. \nThe  affected  districts,  except  for  the  Kathmandu  Valley,  are  essentially  rural  and \nagriculture-based areas where the pre-earthquake vulnerability level was  already high. The 14 \nseverely affected districts account for about 13.6% of the total number of people living below the \npoverty  line  across  Nepal.  The  earthquake  particularly  affected  rural  livelihoods  by  damaging \nlivestock,  crops,  and  agro-based  cottage  industries.  Due  to  the  income  shock  caused  by  the \nearthquake, it is estimated that an additional 2.5% of Nepal\u2019s total population of 27 million as of \n2013,  or  at  least  700,000  people,  will  be  pushed  into  poverty  in  FY2015.  The  affected  rural \ndistricts account for 20% of the country\u2019s total road networks and 23% of total schools, and the \nearthquake  caused  severe  disruptions  to  rural  households\u2019  access  to  essential  physical \ninfrastructure and social services. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  14  most  severely  affected  districts  are  Bhaktapur,  Dhading,  Dolakha,  Gorkha,  Kabhrepalanchok  (Kavre), \nKathmandu,  Lalitpur,  Makwanpur,  Nuwakot,  Okhaldunga,  Ramenchhap,  Rasuwa,  Sindhuli,  and  Sindhupalchowk.  \nGovernment of Nepal. Central Bureau of Statistics. National Population and Housing Census 2011. Kathmandu. \n3   On 22 May 2015, the government launched the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), covering 23 sectors and \nthemes.  Supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  European  Union,  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA),  the  United  Nations  (UN),  and  the World  Bank,  it  aimed  to  assess  the  impact  of  the \nearthquake  and  define  a  recovery  strategy.  A  PDNA  report  was  presented  at  the  International  Conference  on \nNepal\u2019s  Reconstruction  on  25  June  2015  (Government  of  Nepal.  National  Planning  Commission.  2015.  Nepal \nEarthquake 2015 Post Disaster Needs Assessment. Kathmandu). \n\n\f2 \n\nEducation  sector  damage  and  needs. Over  8,000  public  schools  were  affected,  with \n6. \n25,134  classrooms  fully  destroyed  and  another  22,097  partially  damaged.  In  private  schools, \n956 classrooms were fully destroyed and 3,983 classrooms were partially damaged. More than \n80%  of  the  damages  have  been  concentrated  in  the  14  severely  affected  districts.  Public \nschools  accounted  for  92%  of  the  education  sector\u2019s  estimated  total  damages  and  losses  of \nNRs31.3  billion.  Of  this,  the  damage  to  infrastructure  and  physical  assets  is  estimated  at \nNRs28.0  billion.  The  total  needs  for  recovery  and  reconstruction  are  estimated  at  NRs39.70 \nbillion (footnote 3). \n \n7. \nDue  to  the  disruption  in  educational  services,  there  will  be  an  impact  on  enrollment, \nattendance,  and  internal  efficiency,  leading  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of  out-of-school \nchildren. With an increase in the demand for additional labor for reconstruction, some children, \nparticularly in the higher grades, may attend school less regularly or drop out. \n \n8. \nLivelihood  damage  and  needs.  The  earthquake  affected  the  livelihoods  of  about  2.3 \nmillion households and 5.6 million workers across 31 districts, resulting in the loss of 94 million \nworkdays  and  NRs17  billion  of  personal  income  in  FY2015.  The  agriculture  sector  was  most \nseverely affected. It is estimated that 49% of all workdays lost occurred in agriculture, followed \nby tourism (31%), industry (11%), and commerce (9%) (footnote 3). \n\n \nAffected households need immediate access to finance to recover their livelihoods and \n9. \nrestart income generation. However, microfinance institutions (MFIs), which are the main source \nof  finance  in  rural  areas,  were  also  affected.  4 It  is  estimated  that  as  of  September  2015, \napproximately  NRs10  billion  MFI  portfolio  is  at  risk,  and  the  funding  needed  by  MFIs  to  meet \naffected people\u2019s demands is estimated at over NRs100 billion. In Nepal, only 14% of the total \npopulation  have  bank  accounts.  The  majority  of  the  affected  households  have  access  to  only \nsemiformal  MFIs  (footnote  4).  The  earthquake  affected  a  large  number  of  such  unbanked \nhouseholds, and it is estimated that approximately 30% of the 1.5 million MFI borrowers across \nthe country have been affected. \n \n10. \nAs  most  of  the  affected  MFI  borrowers  do  not  have  alternative  credit  source,  MFIs  will \nface  both  liquidity  and  solvency  issues,  impacting  their  capacity  to  assist  their  communities  in \nthis  time  of  need.  MFIs  have  limited  funding  sources  and  mainly  rely  on  the  government\u2019s \ndeprived sector lending scheme, in which banks are mandated to allocate 5% of their total loan \nportfolio  to  relend  to  MFIs.  After  the  earthquake,  banks  are  particularly  cautious  in  extending \nloans to MFIs due to the increased risk from the disaster. \n \n11. \nPost-disaster  recovery  strategy.  For  the  education  sector,  the  recovery  strategy \ninvolves  three  major  elements:  (i)  improving  existing  policies,  guidelines,  and  systems  to \npromote  safety;  (ii)  working  to  make  new  schools  and  other  education  institutions  resilient  to \nclimate change and disaster; and (iii) enhancing disaster resilience through awareness-building \namong teachers and students. \n\n \n12. \nFor the education sector, the government has already initiated reconstruction activities. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  contributed  to  construct \ntemporary  learning  centers.5 ADB\u2019s  Earthquake  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (EEAP)  will  (i) \n\n                                                \n4  MFIs  in  this  document  refer  to  both  microfinance  nongovernment  organizations,  and  savings  and  credit \n\n5   ADB. 2015. Nepal Earthquake Disaster Response Humanitarian Assistance (funded from the Asia Pacific Disaster \n\ncooperatives. \n\nResponse Fund). Manila. \n\n \n\n\fsupport the reconstruction and retrofitting of schools in the 14 severely affected districts, and (ii) \nstrengthen awareness and capacities for disaster risk management at schools. 6 The EEAP will \nbuild  on  ADB\u2019s  successful  experience  in  piloting  a  school  safety  program  that  retrofitted  160 \nschools  and  provided  capacity  development  to  180  engineers  and  sub-engineers  of  the \ngovernment.7 \n \n13. \nFor  livelihood  recovery,  the  strategy  focuses  on  enabling  households  to  recover  their \nproductive activities while increasing their resilience to disasters. Affected households must gain \naccess to finance to regenerate incomes, but they cannot obtain commercial sources of finance \nbecause their income streams have been disrupted. MFIs and savings and credit cooperatives \ncan  serve  as  effective  mechanisms  to  provide  assistance  in  rebuilding  affected  people\u2019s \nlivelihoods.  MFIs  have  huge  outreach,  community-based  linkages,  and  a  long  and  trusted \npresence in the rural areas. A priority need is injecting liquidity into MFIs to onlend to affected \nhouseholds and enabling them to restart their livelihoods and become bankable again. \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  built  on  ADB\u2019s  successful  experience  in  extending rural finance  services \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Cluster  Program,  under  which  the  Small \nFarmers  Development  Bank  (SFDB)  and  network  of  small  farmers\u2019  cooperatives  (SFCs)  were \nreformed  and  strengthened  as  an  efficient  financial  service  provider. 8 The  program  enabled \n142,514 small farmers in rural areas to access institutional financial services for the first time. \n \n15. \nEmergency  assistance  coordination.  There  are  three  phases  of  ADB\u2019s  earthquake \nresponse: (i) an Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund grant of $3 million for Nepal Earthquake \nDisaster  Response  Humanitarian  Assistance  approved  on  27  May  2015,  (ii)  a  loan  of  $200 \nmillion for the EEAP approved on 24 June 2015, and (iii) the grant from the JFPR of $15 million \nfor the project. 9 \n \n16. \nOn 25 June 2015, the World Bank announced its plan to provide $100 million of support \nto Nepal from its International Development Association resources. It also pledged to reallocate \nup to $200 million from the existing portfolio for the recovery and reconstruction, and provide an \nadditional $200 million for a house reconstruction program. The Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA)  is focusing  efforts  on  education with  ADB  and  housing with  the World  Bank,  in \naddition to general disaster risk reduction activities for increasing disaster resiliency. \n \n17. \nNeed for emergency assistance grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. \nThe project will have a strong focus on innovation, future orientation, and poverty reduction. The \nproject will rebuild or retrofit model schools that will be equipped with disaster-resilient structural \nstandards,  more  learning  space,  better  furniture  and  amenities,  and  capable  and  dedicated \nteachers who are trained for disaster-preparedness education. The model schools can provide a \nprototype for possible replication in future. The JFPR grant funding will also enable the project \nto  provide  concessional  livelihood  restoration  microcredit  to  affected  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds.  ADB  loans  or  other  commercial  sources  of  funding  are  not  suitable  for  the \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2015.

The  project  is  also  intended  to  provide  transitional  assistance  for \npriority  rehabilitation  and  include  microcredit  for  a  quick  transfer  of  resources  to  affected \nhouseholds.  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  requires that  the  processing  of \nan  emergency  project  will  not  exceed  12  weeks. 13  The  Project\u2019s  ADB  Board  of  Directors \nconsideration date falls beyond 12 weeks from the government request date for the emergency \nassistance  due  to  (i)  additional  time  required  for  the  Government  of  Japan\u2019s  approval,  and  (ii) \ndelayed grant negotiation date because of Nepal\u2019s ongoing constitution formulation process. \n\n \nImpacts and Outcome \n\nB. \n\n20. \nThe impacts will be (i) improved equity and enhanced social inclusion; and (ii) enhanced \ndisaster  preparedness  and  resilience  of  earthquake-affected  communities  aligned  with  Nepal \nEarthquake  2015  Post  Disaster  Needs  Assessment.  The  outcome  will  be  livelihoods  and \nschooling  in  poorer  and  more  severely  earthquake-affected  communities  restored  with  better \ndisaster resilience. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n21. \nOutput 1: Schools in poorer and severely affected districts constructed or rebuilt \nas  model  disaster-resilient  schools.  The  project  will  rebuild  or  retrofit  at  least  14  model \nschools with disaster-resilient standards in line with the government\u2019s education sector recovery \nstrategy (footnote 3), and equipped with information and communication technology equipment, \n                                                \n10 Sustainability  in  disaster  risk  reduction  will  be  ensured  in  various  measures,  including  adopting  disaster  risk \n\nmanagement plans by village development committees (VDCs) covered under the project (Appendix 1). \n\n11 Adopted at the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, 14\u201318 March 2015 in Sendai, \n\nJapan. \n\n12 ADB  received  a  request  from  the  Government  of  Nepal  for  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  for  an \nemergency  assistance  on  18  June  2015.  The  PDNA,  led  by  the  National  Planning  Commission  to  estimate \ndamages, losses, and reconstruction needs, was initiated on 20 May 2015 and published on 25 June 2015. The \nearthquake is not a chronic natural hazard, but a rare, severe disaster. The security risks to ADB staff are at an \nacceptable level for engagement, as determined by the UN. The level of burden and risk-sharing among partners, \nespecially  shareholders  and  other  key  local  and  international  actors,  is  appropriate.  An  emergency  assistance \ngrant  was  assessed  as  the  most  relevant  instrument  because  (i)  the  proposed  support  is  designed  to  provide \nimmediate to short-term assistance to ease the transition from relief to normal development through quick support \nfor priority recovery and reconstruction, and (ii) ongoing development programs need to advance simultaneously so \nthat  Nepal\u2019s  development  objectives  will  be  met.

This  output \nwill  be  implemented  using  the  same  implementation  arrangements  as  the  EEAP  and  in \ncoordination  with  JICA\u2019s  planned  reconstruction assistances for  schools.14 The  overall  designs \nand approach to disaster-resilient structures are expected to be harmonized between the EEAP, \nJICA, and the project. \n \n22. \nThe project will cover the 14 severely affected districts, and there will be no overlapping \nbetween the EEAP and the project locations. This output will have a strong linkage to disaster \nrisk  reduction  capacity  building  (output  3)  to  make  the  model  schools  serve  as  local  learning \ncenters for disaster risk reduction. \n \n23. \nOutput  2:  Microcredit  facility  for  livelihood  restoration  provided  to  members  of \nsmall  farmers\u2019  cooperatives.  The  project  will  provide  microcredit  to  approximately  12,500 \naffected households to recover from the impacts of the earthquake. The microcredit, which will \nhave  flexible  purposes  to  meet  the  various  needs  of  affected  households,  could  finance  (i) \nreviving  microenterprises;  (ii)  restoring  livestock,  agricultural  activities,  and  other  means  of \nlivelihood;  and  (iii)  purchasing  essential  expenses  during  the  recovery  period,  such  as  food. \nMicrocredit  will  be  channeled  through  SFCs  affiliated  under  the  SFDB.  SFCs  are  member-\nowned  and  member-governed  cooperatives  with  small  and  poor  farmers  as  members.  The \nSFDB has 85 SFC affiliates in the affected districts with 150,000 member households in total.15 \n\n \n24. \nUsing  the  grant  proceeds,  the  government  will  provide  a  loan  to  the  SFDB,  which  will \nrelend  the  loan  to  SFCs,  which  will  onlend  to  final  borrowers.16 Microcredit  will  be  provided  in \nthe same geographic areas for the model schools. SFC member networks will also be utilized to \ntraining  on  disaster-resilient  construction  and  community-based  disaster  risk \nprovide \nmanagement (output 3). \n \n25. \nOutput  3:  Disaster  risk  management  capacity  of  the  affected  communities \nstrengthened. Training programs will be provided on disaster-resilient construction and disaster \nrisk  management.  The  disaster-resilient  construction  training  will  adopt  the  training  of  trainer \nmethodology in which trained masons and carpenters will conduct training in communities. \n\n \nThe  project  will  also  support  disaster  risk  management  trainings  for  the  communities \n26. \nassociated with the schools, including maintenance of school buildings as potential evacuation \ncenters  in  the  event  of  disaster.  The  project  will  prepare  community-based  disaster  risk \nmanagement  plans  for  the  individual  school  communities,  and  train  locally  selected  teachers, \neducation administrators, school management committee members, and VDC members. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n14 At the International Conference on Nepal\u2019s Reconstruction, JICA announced its plan to assist school reconstruction \n\nin collaboration with ADB. \n\n15 The  SFDB  was  selected  as  a  partner  financial  intermediary  for  the  JFPR  grant  because  it  has  (i)  the  most \nextensive  outreach  network  in  the  affected  districts,  (ii)  a  satisfactory  implementation  record  in  providing \nmicrofinance services in rural areas under ADB\u2019s project (footnote 8), and (iii) a functioning project implementation \nunit staffed with experienced experts that can facilitate fast disbursement and implementation under the emergency \ncircumstances. \n\n16 Final terms and conditions will be defined in the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government of Nepal and \n\nthe SFDB. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nD. \n \n27. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $17.8  million,  inclusive  of  taxes  and  duties  (Table  1). \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  detailed  cost  estimates  by  financier  are \nprovided in the project administration manual. 17 \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n  \n\n \nContingenciesc \n \n \n\n Model disaster-resilient schools \n Microcredit for livelihood restoration \nDisaster risk reduction capacity building \nSubtotal (A) \n\nItem \nBase Costb \nA. \n1. \n \n \n2. \n             3. \n \nB. \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of about $1.3 million to be partially financed from government resources, Small Farmers \nDevelopment  Bank  resources,  or  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  resources.

Upon  its \n\n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Any  incidental  expenditures  relating  to  bank  charges,  local  transport,  freight,  and  insurance  are  eligible  for  ADB \n\nfinancing. \n\n \n\n\festablishment,  the  NRA  will  be  the  project\u2019s  executing  agency.  In  the  interim,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF) will be the executing agency for the project.19  \n \n30. \nThe  project  will  adopt  the  same  overall  project  implementation  arrangement  as  the \nEEAP. Under the EEAP, a dedicated project management unit will be established in the MOF as \nthe  executing  agency,  consisting  of  managerial  staff  and  technical  experts  assisted  by  project \nmanagement  consultants.  The  project  management  unit  of  the  EEAP  will  also  be  the  project \nmanagement unit for the project. \n \n31. \nOutput  1  will  be  implemented  using  the  EEAP  implementation  arrangement  for  school \nrebuilding.  Under  the  EEAP,  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  under  the  Ministry  of \nEducation  will  be  the  implementing  agency,  with  a  dedicated  project  implementation  unit. \nConsultants  to  be  recruited  under  the  EEAP  will  also  assist  in  the  implementation  of  the \nproject\u2019s  output  1.  The  implementing  agency  will  establish  a  high-level  task  force  for  the \napproval  of  designs  for  model  schools  and  an  overall  policy  for  the  construction  of  disaster-\nresilient school buildings. \n \n32. \nFor output 2, the Financial Sector Management Division (FSMD) of the MOF will be the \nimplementing  agency,  with  SFDB  as  the  partner  financial  intermediary.  SFDB  will  channel  the \nfunds to SFCs to onlend to its members. SFDB has been the implementing agency under ADB\u2019s \nRural Finance Sector Development Cluster Program (Subprogram 2) (footnote 8), whose project \nimplementation unit will be used for this output. \n \n33. \nFor output 3, the MOF\u2019s FSMD and the DOE will implement the output in their areas of \nresponsibility. The MOF\u2019s FSMD, in coordination with SFDB, will organize the disaster-resilient \nconstruction  training  and  community-based  disaster  risk  management  training  to  SFCs.  The \nDOE will organize training for school communities on disaster risk management. \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2015\u2013September 2018 \nThe extended implementation period beyond the emergency assistance norm of 2 years \nis justified based on slow disbursement and implementation progress in similar projects \nin Nepal.a The project\u2019s implementation period needs to be aligned with the EEAP \nbecause the consultants under the EEAP will also support implementation of the project. \n\nEstimated completion date  30 September 2018 \n\nEstimated closing date \n\n31 March 2019 \n\nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\nProject Steering Committee (to be established) \nMOF (interim executing agency) \nDepartment of Education, MOF (Financial Sector Management Division), Small Farmers \nDevelopment Bank (partner financial intermediary) \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit  Kathmandu, Nepal, about three full-time staff proposed (three offices) \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \n\nNational competitive bidding \nShopping \nIndividual consultant selection \nSingle source selection \nProvided for eligible expenditures incurred for consulting services, procurement of goods \nand civil works, training and capacity building, and credit line after 25 April 2015, and up \nto a maximum of 20% of the grant amount \n\n2 contracts \nMultiple contracts \n152 person-months \n5 person-months \n\n$6.8 million \n$0.68 million \n$608,000 \n$125,000 \n\n                                                \n19 A  National  Reconstruction  Authority  is  expected  to  be  established  and  provided  with  adequate  financial  and \napproval authority (through an ordinance or the 2015 earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction act) to allow it to \nexecute rehabilitation and reconstruction programs successfully. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nAspects \nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EEAP = Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project, MOF = Ministry of Finance. \na ADB. 2015.

ADB will assist the implementing agency in the selection of the following consultants, and \nthe  executing  agency  will  be  responsible  for  contracts  and  administration:  (i)  engineer  advisor \n(earthquake-resistant  building  design  for  the  DOE),  (ii)  project  management  specialist  (JFPR), \n(iii)  school  project  coordinator  (school  safety,  JFPR),  (iv)  training  specialist  (model  schools  for \nthe  DOE),  (v)  architect  (model  schools  for  the  DOE),  (vi)  information  and  communication \ntechnology  specialist  (model  schools  for  the  DOE),  and  (vii)  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement specialist for the DOE. \n \n35. \nProcurement capacity assessments of the executing agency and implementing agencies \nhave been undertaken. Based on these assessments, (i) centralized procurement will be used \nby  all  implementing  agencies,  and  (ii)  the  thresholds  for  procurement  of  goods  and  works  as \nwell as consulting services have been agreed upon with the government. Likewise, ADB\u2019s prior \nreview and post-review have been set forth in the procurement plan. The procurement section in \nthe  project  administration  manual  details  the  thresholds  and  processes  to  be  followed  by  the \nproject to support the executing and implementing agencies. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n36. \nThe  design  and  site  selection  of  model  disaster-resilient  school  subprojects  will  be  in \naccordance  with  the  subproject  selection  criteria  and  approval  procedures  agreed  with  the \ngovernment.  The  project  adopts  the  same  subproject  selection  criteria  as  under  the  EEAP.20 \nThese include adherence to safeguards requirements and technical and economic viability. The \nscreening  of  subprojects  will  be  led  by  the  implementing  agency.  The  objectives  of  the  model \nschools  will  be  better  disaster  resilience.  Each  school  shall  also  serve  as  community-based \nlearning  centers  for  disaster  risk  management,  and  promote  community  outreach  for  disaster \nrisk reduction  planning  and  training  programs. The  possible  impacts  of climate  change  and  its \nresilience measures will also be considered during the screening of subprojects. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n37. \nEconomic  and  financial  assessments  for  the  model  disaster-resilient  schools  will  be \nundertaken  after  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approves  the  project  and  under  the  EEAP \nimplementation  arrangement.  The  EEAP  will  conduct  an  economic  analysis  for  model  schools \nwith reference to cost\u2013benefit analysis of educational opportunities provided to students at risk \nof  dropout,  particularly  in  poor  and  vulnerable  locations.  Selection  and  approval  of  individual \n\n                                                \n20 The subproject selection criteria are in Appendix 5 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fsubprojects,  as  well  as  their  implementation,  will  be  subject  to  the  conduct  of  economic  due \ndiligence and to the demonstration of each subproject\u2019s economic viability. \n \n38. \nThe project\u2019s model schools are public services goods with no cost recovery, and hence \nno  financial  viability  assessment  is  required.  The  schools  will  be  maintained  using  funds  from \nthe government\u2019s recurrent budget. \n \n39. \nEconomic returns of microcredit for livelihood restoration will be an aggregate of at least \n12,500 investment subprojects, with each investment size less than $500. As such, quantifying \neconomic  returns  of  the  microcredit  will  be  difficult.  However,  microcredit  for  livelihood \nrestoration  is  expected  to  generate  significant  economic  impacts  through  restored  livelihoods \nand  income-generating  activities  of  affected  households.  Direct  employment  will  be  generated \nby  reviving  farm  activities  and  microenterprises.  Liquidity  injection  into  the  post-disaster \neconomic  environment  will  enhance  financial  viability  of  SFCs.  Improved  financial  viability  of \nSFCs  and  enhanced  financial  intermediation  in  the  affected  areas  will  significantly  reduce  the \ngovernment\u2019s budgetary needs for rehabilitation. \n\n \nSFDB\u2019s institutional due diligence was conducted in May 2015.21 SFDB is a leading rural \n40. \nfinance provider and is licensed and regulated as a class D financial institution (i.e., an MFIs) by \nthe Central Bank of Nepal. As a regulated institution, SFDB is subject to the central bank\u2019s on-\nsite  and  off-site  inspection  and  minimum  capital  and  liquidity  compliance.  SFDB  has  a  track \nrecord  of  delivering  microfinance  services  through  SFCs.  It  has  successfully  expanded \nmicrofinance  outreach  in  remote  hill  and  mountain  areas  under  ADB\u2019s  Rural  Finance  Sector \nDevelopment Cluster Program (Subprogram 2) (footnote 8). \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n41. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  under  the  same  implementation  arrangement  as  the \nEEAP. The FSMD of the MOF will be added as an additional implementing agency, and SFDB \nwill be added as the financial intermediary for the microcredit. The same measures to address \nthe  fiduciary  risk  will  be  applied  as  under  the  EEAP.  The  overall  fiduciary  risk,  although \nsubstantial,  remains  manageable  as  a  result  of  the  additional  measures,  notably  the  targeted \ntechnical assistance and support to the executing agency under the EEAP. All the implementing \nagencies,  including  the  FSMD  of  the  MOF  and  SFDB,  have  a  satisfactory  record  in \nimplementing ADB-funded projects. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n42. \nwith the government, the MOF, and all implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n43. \nThe project will address the post-disaster needs of women and vulnerable groups, and \ntheir equal access to project benefits. The project will rebuild or retrofit model disaster-resilient \nschools  addressing  gender  equity  and  social  inclusion  (GESI)  concerns  such  as  meeting \nuniversal design and accessibility standards, building the capacity of women teachers and staff \non  emergency  response.  In  the  livelihood  restoration  microcredit  operation,  at  least  60% \n\n                                                \n21 Small Farmers Development Bank Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\nmicrocredit borrowers are women. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, \nand a GESI action plan was prepared.22  \n\n44. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  Subproject  selection  criteria  were \nformulated  to  avoid  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  for  outputs  1  and  3,  and  to \nexclude  output  2  subprojects  with  environmental  impacts.  The  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  framework  (EARF),  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009) and government laws and regulations, will be used for the project. The project\u2019s EARF is \naligned  with  the  EEAP.  Initial  environmental  examinations  and  environmental  management \nplans will be (i) prepared consistent with the EARF through consultant support provided through \nthe  project,  and  (ii)  incorporated  in  bidding  documents  and  contract  documents  to  be \nimplemented  by  contractors  and  monitored  by  the  implementing  agencies.  Environmental \nreporting to ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission will be done on a semiannual basis. The project is \nclassified  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples. \nSubproject selection criteria were formulated to avoid land acquisition, involuntary resettlement \nimpacts, and social risks. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n45. \nThe  overall  implementing  risk  is  considered  to  be  high.  The  key  risks  relate  to  the \nongoing political instability and limited implementation capacity. To mitigate these key risks the \nproject\u2019s  implementation  arrangement  will  use  the  arrangement  under  the  EEAP,  with  project \nmanagement  consultants  for  output  1.  For  output  2,  implementation  will  be  supported  by  a \nnational  project  coordination  specialist,  who  has  extensive  experience  implementing  ADB-\nfunded  projects.  Major  risks  and  mitigation  measures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n46. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration  manual.  The  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the grant and project agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n47. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the administration by \nADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $15,000,000  to  Nepal  for  the  Disaster  Risk \nReduction  and  Livelihood  Restoration  for  Earthquake-Affected  Communities  Project,  to  be \nprovided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. \n\n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n22 Gender and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2).  \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n23 September 2015\n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with: \nImproved equity and enhanced social inclusion, and enhanced disaster preparedness and resilience of \nearthquake-affected communities (Nepal Earthquake 2015 Post Disaster Needs Assessment)a \nProject Results \nChain \nOutcome \n\nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and Baselines \n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLivelihood and \nschooling in poorer \nand more severely \nearthquake-\naffected \ncommunities \nrestored with better \ndisaster resilience \n\nOutputs \n\n1.
