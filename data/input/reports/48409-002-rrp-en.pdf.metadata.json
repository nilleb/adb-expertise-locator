THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Climate-Friendly Agribusiness Value Chains Sector Project. \nThe report also describes the proposed administration of a loan and a grant to be provided by the \nGreen Climate Fund (GCF) for the Climate-Friendly Agribusiness Value Chains Sector Project, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the GCF loan and grant. \n \n2.  The proposed project supports fulfilling the government\u2019s Agriculture Sector Strategic \nDevelopment Plan and the Industrial Development Policy, by improving the competitiveness of \nagribusiness value chains in Kampong Cham and Tboung Khmum provinces along the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) southern economic corridor, and in Kampot and Takeo provinces along \nthe south coastal economic corridor.1 The project will boost the climate resilience of critical \nagricultural infrastructure and help commercialize rice, maize, cassava, and mango production. It \nwill  help  increase  crop  productivity  and  diversification;  improve  the  capacity  for  storage, \nprocessing, and quality and safety testing; and promote the use of solar and bioenergy. It will \nstrengthen the technical and institutional capacity for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and create \nan enabling policy environment for climate-friendly agribusinesses. This will in turn promote long-\nterm environmental sustainability and enhance the profitability for farmers and agribusinesses.   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector performance. Agriculture\u2014including processing, transportation, and trade of farm \nproducts\u2014is crucial for the Cambodian economy, still accounting for 33.7% of the nation\u2019s gross \ndomestic  product.  Crop  production  is  the  largest  contributor (59.4%)  to the  sector\u2019s gross \ndomestic  product.2  Agriculture  grew  at  4.5%  per  annum  during  2008\u20132012,  driven  by  the \nexpansion of cultivated land and high prices of farm products, but it slowed down during 2013\u2013\n2016 (0.9% per annum) because of the loss of those drivers, extreme weather events, and rapid \ngrowth  in  other  sectors,  such  as  industry  and  services.3  The  transition  from  a  traditional \nsubsistence to a modern commercial agriculture sector is slow.4 \n \n4.  Development constraints. To accelerate the transition to commercial agriculture, several \nbarriers related to infrastructure, capacity, and policy must be removed. Currently, agribusiness \nvalue chains in Cambodia remain less developed, more fragmented, less resource-efficient, and \nless competitive than those in neighboring countries such as Thailand and Viet Nam. Most \ncommodities are exported in raw form, and most of the value addition to Cambodia\u2019s agricultural \nproducts occurs in Thailand and Viet Nam. This is mainly the result of (i) poor production and \npost-harvest infrastructure leading to low productivity and high post-harvest losses (15% to 20%); \n(ii) limited capacity to deal with the impacts of climate change; and (iii) an unfavorable policy \nenvironment for agribusiness. Farming remains mostly subsistence and rain-fed. Many irrigation \nschemes are not functional. High energy costs and poor-quality road networks also contribute to \n                                                \n1 Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. 2015.

Varieties grown are of low productivity and less resilient to \nthe impacts of climate change. The labor shortage in rural areas has increased because of \nmigration, but farm mechanization is still limited. The drying, storage, and processing facilities at \nfarm cooperatives are still rudimentary, leading to poor quality and safety of food products. Quality \nand safety standards remain weak. Private investments in agriculture are low in the absence of \nsound  agribusiness  policy  frameworks  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs).  Market \nliberalization and changing global trade rules that require stringent quality and food safety \nstandards are also making it hard for Cambodian farmers to access competitive markets.  \n \n5.  Cambodia\u2019s agriculture sector is highly vulnerable to impacts of climate change. High risks \nof flood and drought combined with poverty and low adaptive capacity makes Cambodia one of \nthe most vulnerable countries in the world.5 Weather patterns have been unpredictable of late but \nessentially result in longer dry seasons and droughts, and rainy seasons that start late but are \nmore intense. Climate projections to 2050 suggest that Cambodia will experience changes in \ntemperature  and  rainfall  with  significant  adverse  impacts  on  farming  communities  and \necosystems. Farm residues are mostly used as fuel for cooking or burnt in the open, leading to \nincreased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. About 75% of households use firewood for cooking, \nof which about 88% comes from natural forests, partly contributing to forest degradation and \ndeforestation. Reducing the reliance on firewood and fossil fuels is therefore critical.  \n \n6.  Opportunities. Investments in climate-friendly agribusiness value chain infrastructure \ncoupled with targeted capacity strengthening and policy support are vital to tackling the above \nconstraints. Intensified crop production with irrigation and efficient water management, improved \nproduction and postharvest infrastructure with better connectivity to cooperatives and markets, \nand adoption of CSA production practices and climate-resilient varieties will enhance food \nsecurity, reduce postharvest losses, and help farmers to better cope with climate change. \nIntegration of renewable energy options can enhance competitiveness by reducing energy costs. \nFarm mechanization  can  help manage  labor  shortages,  while  support  to  cooperatives  can \nencourage farmers to work together to enhance their bargaining power and farming incomes. \n  \n7.  Government\u2019s  efforts.  The  government\u2019s  Agriculture  Sector  Strategic  Development \nPlan, 2014\u20132018 aims to enhance the competitiveness of the sector through greater agricultural \nproductivity  (intensification),  diversification,  and  commercialization.  Measures  include  the \n(i) expansion of agricultural extension services, improvement of seed quality to respond to market \nneeds, and better postharvest technology; (ii) creation of an enabling environment for the private \nsector and adoption of good agricultural practices; (iii) strengthening of policies that will support \nagricultural businesses and exports, and improve product quality and standards (e.g., sustainable \nrice platform); (iv) bolstering of the analytical capacity of the National Agricultural Laboratory; \n(v) rehabilitation  of  the  infrastructure  of  state  farms  and  agricultural  development  centers; \n(vi) implementation of the strategy and action plan for climate change adaptation and mitigation; \nand (vii) promotion of private investment in agriculture through PPPs.

Using \ncooperatives as an entry point, the project will foster PPPs and encourage the private sector to \ninvest in input and output markets, and marketing. The government prioritized rice, maize, \ncassava, and mango in Kampong Cham, Kampot, Tboung Khmum, and Takeo provinces.8 The \nproject will promote economic integration through harmonization of standards and complement \ninitiatives on trade and agriculture.9 It will also complement planned projects on irrigation and \nagricultural value chains. \n \n9.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from ADB and other development \npartner-funded programs such as the (i) climate-resilient rice commercialization program and \n(ii) the strategic program for climate resilience.10 Lessons call for (i) improving climate resilience \nof  critical rural infrastructure, (ii) strengthening capacity of farmers in CSA and of agribusinesses \nin climate-friendly technologies and practices, and (iii) supporting an enabling policy environment \nfor climate-friendly agribusinesses. Many projects have focused on only one of these issues, and \nno other development partner has yet designed a project in an integrated manner. \n10.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with the Agriculture Sector Strategic Development \nPlan 2014\u20132018; National Climate Change Action Plan (2016\u20132018); National Strategic Plan on \nGreen Growth (2013\u20132030); the GMS Regional Investment Framework 2022; ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia; and was included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2018\u20132020 for Cambodia.11 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan \nfor Agriculture and Natural Resources, which aims  to increase value addition and expand \npartnerships with the private sector in productivity enhancement, agro-processing, and retailing.12 \nB.

Outputs \n12.  Output  1:  Critical  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure improved  and  made \nclimate-resilient. This output bridges gaps in infrastructure to enhance the competitiveness of \nthe value chains of rice, maize, cassava, and mango in target provinces. It involves rehabilitation \nand modernization of rural infrastructure to increase production and resource efficiency, reduce \npostharvest losses, and enhance quality and value chain links while reducing GHG emissions \nand increasing climate resilience. Key activities involve (i) rehabilitating irrigation and water \nmanagement infrastructure (off-farm irrigation systems, on-farm rainwater harvesting ponds, and \ndrip irrigation) to climate-resilient condition; (ii) upgrading agricultural cooperatives\u2019 value chain \ninfrastructure (drying, processing, and storage facilities); (iii) improving the connectivity of farms \nto cooperatives and markets through climate-resilient farm road networks; (iv) strengthening the \ninfrastructure for agricultural quality and safety testing; and (v) promoting renewable energy \n(biodigesters and use of solar energy in target cooperative areas) to reduce GHG emissions. \n \n13.  The project will rehabilitate water management infrastructure through de-silting works and \nupgrades of design standards to withstand climate variability and projected climate changes, and \ninstall drip irrigation systems to improve yields and deliver exportable mango fruit. The project will \nsupport the construction of climate-proofed postharvest units at farm cooperatives. It will improve \nclimate resilience of farm-to-market roads by increasing the height of embankments, promoting \ncross drainage, and selecting permeable materials, among other measures. The sustainability of \nthe infrastructure is ensured through an integrated approach to operation and maintenance (O&M) \npractices, focusing on institutions, capacity building, financing, and technologies. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Climate-smart  agriculture  and  agribusiness  promoted.  Key  activities \ninclude (i) deploying climate-resilient varieties; (ii) strengthening the capacity for climate-friendly \nproduction practices and technologies; and (iii) promoting farm mechanization and extension. The \nproject will support the Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute to produce, \nmultiply, and distribute climate-resilient varieties of rice and maize and to improve weaning and \nacclimatization of mango and cassava. The project will train at least 40,000 farmers (of which \n16,000 are women) on CSA practices. It will demonstrate laser land leveling to improve water use \nefficiency and enhance the capacity of farmers\u2019 water user groups to operate and manage \nirrigation schemes. The project will construct and upgrade four farm mechanization workshops \nand four agribusiness training facilities to train farm water user communities, women farmers, and \nmembers of agricultural cooperatives in infrastructure O&M and farm mechanization.   \n \n15.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  Project  preparation  considered  the  (i)  economic  viability  of  technical  options  and \ncompatibility  with  local  conditions;  (ii)  adaptation  and  mitigation  [biogas  and  solar  energy \npromotion] measures; (iii) options to maximize the agribusiness value chain benefits to farmers; \n(iv) mechanisms to strengthen links to enhance and consolidate the production base for target \nvalue chains; and (v) measures to minimize adverse environmental and social impacts. The \nproject team incorporated adaptation measures in terms of siting, construction, and upgrades of \ninfrastructure to reduce climate change risks. The project team conducted technical due diligence \nfor three representative subprojects: (i) Trapaing Run irrigation and modernization; (ii) agricultural \ncooperative cassava chip drying, processing, and storage; and (iii) Tram Kak drip irrigation for \nimproved mango production. The team evaluated representative subprojects against eligibility \ncriteria, which are detailed in the PAM. The project incorporates a participatory development \napproach, whereby beneficiary farmers will participate in the design and implementation of \nsubprojects. Cooperatives and farmers will be partially responsible for the O&M of infrastructure. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The project team conducted an economic and financial analysis for the representative \nsubprojects. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Trapaing Run irrigation subproject \nis 13.1%, based on increased yield and cropping intensity. The Tram Kak drip irrigation subproject \nyields an EIRR of 22.5%, based on improved yield and higher percentage of grade A mango fruit. \nThe cassava cooperative subproject yields an EIRR of 18.8%, based on a higher cassava price \ndue to processing and off-season sales. The sensitivity analysis considered several downside \nscenarios: (i) a 10% increase in subproject costs, (ii) a 10% increase in operating costs, (iii) a \n10% reduction in benefits, and (iv) a combination of all three scenarios. In all scenarios, the EIRRs \nfor all subprojects exceed 9% and are economically viable. The project, especially in outputs 2 \nand 3, generates other benefits that could not be monetized, such as (i) sound agribusiness \npolicies that attract private sector investment; (ii) stronger institutional and human capacity; and \n(iii) other environmental benefits from CSA, biodigesters, and laser land leveling.   \n \n22.  For the irrigation subprojects, the beneficiaries will perform routine O&M. The project will \neither establish and/or strengthen farmers\u2019 water user communities and enhance their capacity \nfor O&M. The financial analysis indicates that the subproject will generate sufficient incremental \nnet income for the beneficiaries to contribute to routine O&M. However, periodic maintenance \ntypically requires more resources, specialized equipment, and skills beyond the ability of the \nbeneficiaries. In 2016, the Ministry of Economy and Finance allocated an annual O&M budget of \n$15 million. As the funding is allocated upon request by the implementing agencies, the project \nimplementation consultants will assist the agencies to tap into this fund for periodic O&M. For drip \nirrigation system and cooperative storage facilities, orchard owners and cooperative members are \nexpected to take responsibility for periodic and routine O&M. The annual net operating cash flows \nof these subprojects are positive, indicating that the beneficiaries will have sufficient financial \nresources to provide for O&M. All subprojects will develop a viable and realistic O&M plan. \n ", "8 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  Project implementation, financial management, and procurement will be aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s standard operating procedures. The existing institutional structures for financial \nmanagement are adequate. The pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate as several \ngovernment staff members are conversant with the financial management guidelines of ADB. All \nprocurement financed by ADB will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time).17 The project procurement risk is moderate. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MAFF. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n24.  The project is classified general intervention. It will benefit at least 390,000 people (80,000 \nhouseholds) by increasing their net incomes.18 It will promote inclusive economic growth, reduce \npoverty, and provide rural jobs and improved services, including the development of partnerships \nbetween farmers, cooperatives, processors, distributors, and traders. Farmers will produce quality \nproducts on time and with continuity of supply. Landless and poor households will be included in \nagribusiness, farm mechanization, and O&M training. Identified poor households in project areas \nwill be targeted for jobs related to civil works. Landless and poor farmers will have the opportunity \nto access off-farm and on-farm employment related to postharvest support services. \n \n25.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project team prepared a \ngender  action  plan,  which  includes gender  actions,  performance  indicators,  and targets  to \npromote women\u2019s voice and active participation in project activities.19 The project will promote \ngender equality and women\u2019s empowerment by boosting women\u2019s capacity in CSA production \nand processing, management and business, farm machinery use and maintenance, and by \nstrengthening links between women-led enterprises and the agribusiness industry. In addition, a \ndetailed gender analysis of value chains will inform the refinement of the gender action plan and \nthe development of a gender-responsive agribusiness policy. Women will be targeted for training \nand jobs in infrastructure-related rehabilitation and O&M, and as decision-makers in the selection \nof climate-resilient varieties. The project will work in close partnership with the Women Farmers\u2019 \nNetwork and MAFF\u2019s Gender and Children Project Support Unit and strengthen their capacity to \nensure sustainability of gender mainstreaming efforts in the sector. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n27.  Environment (category B). The project is expected to achieve significant environmental \nbenefits, including cumulative reduction of 240,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of GHG \nemissions, improved resilience, and increased crop diversity in the project areas. The project \nteam conducted environmental due diligence for three representative subprojects and prepared \na sample initial environmental examination, including an environmental management plan, for the \n                                                \n17 Universal procurement will apply as per ADB. 2013.

The  government  prepared  the \nenvironmental codes of conduct and the environmental assessment and review framework to \nguide the screening and categorization of subprojects, identify potential impacts and prepare \nenvironmental impact assessments as required, and uploaded them to the ADB website in \nJanuary 2018.21 Only subprojects classified as category B or C will be financed. All subprojects \nwill be screened for climate risks and incorporate risk reduction measures. \n28.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Due diligence conducted for three representative \nsubprojects shows no need (or only minimal need) for land acquisition, and none will result in any \nphysical or economic displacement.22 However, as most of the subprojects will be prepared after \nBoard approval, the government prepared the land acquisition and resettlement framework \n(LARF) to guide the screening and selection of subprojects as well as the resettlement planning \nprocess, and uploaded the LARF to ADB\u2019s website in January 2018.23 Only subprojects classified \nas category B or C will be financed. The government will prepare the land acquisition and \nresettlement plan in accordance with LARF and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for any \nsubproject entailing involuntary resettlement impact.  \n29.  The General Department of Resettlement (GDR) under the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance  together  with  the  project  management  unit,  and  with  support  from  the  project \nimplementation consultants, will update due diligence reports, and conduct due diligence for all \nsubprojects identified after Board approval. A screening checklist will be applied to (i) reject \nsubprojects with significant negative impacts; and (ii) assess impacts and confirm categorization \nof subprojects as either B or C. For subprojects involving voluntary land donation only in case of \nminimal land requirement, GDR will conduct due diligence as defined in the LARF. If negotiated \nsettlement (willing buyer-willing seller) is used: (i) GDR will involve a third party to validate and \ndocument the process; and (ii) GDR will submit the report with supporting documents to ADB for \nconcurrence  and  no  objection  before  any  civil  works  commence.  If  the  land  is  acquired \ninvoluntarily, the GDR will prepare a land acquisition and resettlement plan in accordance with \nthe LARF, compensate for all affected land and/or assets, and send to ADB for concurrence and \ndisclosure prior to issuance of the bidding documents.     \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category B). No indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities reside in \nthe areas of sample subprojects. However, some ethnic minorities may live in project provinces \nwho could be impacted by subprojects chosen during project implementation. Impacts are largely \nexpected to be positive. The project will not finance any category A subprojects. The executing \nagency prepared an ethnic minority development framework to ensure inclusion, full consultation, \nand participation of ethnic minority households, which was uploaded to the ADB website in \nJanuary  2018.24  The  institutional  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  to manage  impacts  on \nindigenous  peoples,  as  verified  during  due  diligence,  is  considered  adequate.  Adequate \nresources have been allocated to the preparation and implementation of social and environmental \nsafeguards, and to their monitoring and reporting.
