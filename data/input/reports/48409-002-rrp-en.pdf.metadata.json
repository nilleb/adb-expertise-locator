It \nwill  help  increase  crop  productivity  and  diversification;  improve  the  capacity  for  storage, \nprocessing,  and quality  and safety  testing;  and promote the  use  of  solar  and bioenergy. It  will \nstrengthen the technical and institutional capacity for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and create \nan enabling policy environment for climate-friendly agribusinesses. This will in turn promote long-\nterm environmental sustainability and enhance the profitability for farmers and agribusinesses.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSector performance. Agriculture\u2014including processing, transportation, and trade of farm \nproducts\u2014is crucial for the Cambodian economy, still accounting for 33.7% of the nation\u2019s gross \ndomestic  product.  Crop  production  is  the  largest  contributor  (59.4%)  to  the  sector\u2019s  gross \ndomestic  product.2  Agriculture  grew  at  4.5%  per  annum  during  2008\u20132012,  driven  by  the \nexpansion of cultivated land and high prices of farm products, but it slowed down during 2013\u2013\n2016 (0.9% per annum) because of the loss of those drivers, extreme weather events, and rapid \ngrowth  in  other  sectors,  such  as  industry  and  services.3  The  transition  from  a  traditional \nsubsistence to a modern commercial agriculture sector is slow.4 \n \n4. \nDevelopment constraints. To accelerate the transition to commercial agriculture, several \nbarriers related to infrastructure, capacity, and policy must be removed. Currently, agribusiness \nvalue chains in Cambodia remain less developed, more fragmented, less resource-efficient, and \nless  competitive  than  those  in  neighboring  countries  such  as  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam.  Most \ncommodities are exported in raw form, and most of the value addition to Cambodia\u2019s agricultural \nproducts  occurs  in Thailand and  Viet  Nam. This  is mainly  the  result  of (i)  poor  production  and \npost-harvest infrastructure leading to low productivity and high post-harvest losses (15% to 20%); \n(ii)  limited  capacity  to  deal  with  the  impacts  of  climate  change;  and  (iii)  an  unfavorable  policy \nenvironment for agribusiness. Farming remains mostly subsistence and rain-fed. Many irrigation \nschemes are not functional. High energy costs and poor-quality road networks also contribute to \n\n                                                \n1  Government  of  Cambodia,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries.  2015.

Washington DC. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nframeworks \n\nhigh production and distribution costs. Varieties grown are of low productivity and less resilient to \nthe  impacts  of  climate  change.  The  labor  shortage  in  rural  areas  has  increased  because  of \nmigration, but farm mechanization is still limited. The drying, storage, and processing facilities at \nfarm cooperatives are still rudimentary, leading to poor quality and safety of food products. Quality \nand safety standards remain weak. Private investments in agriculture are low in the absence of \nsound  agribusiness  policy \nfor  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs).  Market \nliberalization  and  changing  global  trade  rules  that  require  stringent  quality  and  food  safety \nstandards are also making it hard for Cambodian farmers to access competitive markets.  \n \n5. \nCambodia\u2019s agriculture sector is highly vulnerable to impacts of climate change. High risks \nof flood and drought combined with poverty and low adaptive capacity makes Cambodia one of \nthe most vulnerable countries in the world.5 Weather patterns have been unpredictable of late but \nessentially result in longer dry seasons and droughts, and rainy seasons that start late but are \nmore  intense.  Climate  projections  to  2050  suggest  that  Cambodia  will  experience  changes  in \ntemperature  and  rainfall  with  significant  adverse  impacts  on  farming  communities  and \necosystems. Farm residues are mostly used as fuel for cooking or burnt in the open, leading to \nincreased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. About 75% of households use firewood for cooking, \nof  which  about  88%  comes  from  natural  forests,  partly  contributing  to  forest  degradation  and \ndeforestation. Reducing the reliance on firewood and fossil fuels is therefore critical.  \n \nOpportunities.  Investments  in  climate-friendly  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure \n6. \ncoupled with targeted capacity strengthening and policy support are vital to tackling the above \nconstraints. Intensified crop production with irrigation and efficient water management, improved \nproduction and postharvest infrastructure with better connectivity to cooperatives and markets, \nand  adoption  of  CSA  production  practices  and  climate-resilient  varieties  will  enhance  food \nsecurity,  reduce  postharvest  losses,  and  help  farmers  to  better  cope  with  climate  change. \nIntegration of renewable energy options can enhance competitiveness by reducing energy costs. \nFarm  mechanization  can  help  manage  labor  shortages,  while  support  to  cooperatives  can \nencourage farmers to work together to enhance their bargaining power and farming incomes. \n  \n7. \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts.  The  government\u2019s  Agriculture  Sector  Strategic  Development \nPlan, 2014\u20132018 aims to enhance the competitiveness of the sector through greater agricultural \nproductivity  (intensification),  diversification,  and  commercialization.  Measures  include  the \n(i) expansion of agricultural extension services, improvement of seed quality to respond to market \nneeds, and better postharvest technology; (ii) creation of an enabling environment for the private \nsector and adoption of good agricultural practices; (iii) strengthening of policies that will support \nagricultural businesses and exports, and improve product quality and standards (e.g., sustainable \nrice  platform);  (iv)  bolstering  of  the  analytical  capacity  of  the  National  Agricultural  Laboratory; \n(v) rehabilitation  of  the  infrastructure  of  state  farms  and  agricultural  development  centers; \n(vi) implementation of the strategy and action plan for climate change adaptation and mitigation; \nand  (vii)  promotion  of  private  investment  in  agriculture  through  PPPs.

By providing targeted capacity building and policy support to stakeholders along the \nvalue chain, the project will enhance crop production and productivity in project areas, diversify \nlivelihood options, and assist smallholders\u2019 transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture. \nBy improving the testing capacity for quality and safety, the project will significantly enable broader \naccess by project beneficiaries to high-value (export) markets within and beyond the GMS. Using \ncooperatives as an entry point, the project will foster PPPs and encourage the private sector to \ninvest  in  input  and  output  markets,  and  marketing.  The  government  prioritized  rice,  maize, \ncassava, and mango in Kampong Cham, Kampot, Tboung Khmum, and Takeo provinces.8 The \nproject will promote economic integration through harmonization of standards and complement \ninitiatives  on  trade  and  agriculture.9  It  will  also  complement  planned  projects  on  irrigation  and \nagricultural value chains. \n \n9. \nLessons.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  ADB  and  other  development \npartner-funded  programs  such  as  the  (i)  climate-resilient  rice  commercialization  program  and \n(ii) the strategic program for climate resilience.10 Lessons call for (i) improving climate resilience \nof  critical rural infrastructure, (ii) strengthening capacity of farmers in CSA and of agribusinesses \nin climate-friendly technologies and practices, and (iii) supporting an enabling policy environment \nfor climate-friendly agribusinesses. Many projects have focused on only one of these issues, and \nno other development partner has yet designed a project in an integrated manner. \n\n10. \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  Agriculture  Sector  Strategic  Development \nPlan 2014\u20132018; National Climate Change Action Plan (2016\u20132018); National Strategic Plan on \nGreen  Growth  (2013\u20132030);  the  GMS  Regional  Investment  Framework  2022;  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018  for  Cambodia;  and  was  included  in  the  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2018\u20132020 for Cambodia.11 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan \nfor  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources,  which  aims  to  increase  value  addition  and  expand \npartnerships with the private sector in productivity enhancement, agro-processing, and retailing.12 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \n\nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  agricultural  competitiveness \n\n                                                \n8  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the  Climate-Friendly Agribusiness Value Chains Sector \nProject.

This output bridges gaps in infrastructure to enhance the competitiveness of \nthe value chains of rice, maize, cassava, and mango in target provinces. It involves rehabilitation \nand modernization of rural infrastructure to increase production and resource efficiency, reduce \npostharvest  losses,  and  enhance  quality  and  value  chain  links  while  reducing  GHG  emissions \nand  increasing  climate  resilience.  Key  activities  involve  (i)  rehabilitating  irrigation  and  water \nmanagement infrastructure (off-farm irrigation systems, on-farm rainwater harvesting ponds, and \ndrip irrigation) to climate-resilient condition; (ii) upgrading agricultural cooperatives\u2019 value chain \ninfrastructure (drying, processing, and storage facilities); (iii) improving the connectivity of farms \nto cooperatives and markets through climate-resilient farm road networks; (iv) strengthening the \ninfrastructure  for  agricultural  quality  and  safety  testing;  and  (v)  promoting  renewable  energy \n(biodigesters and use of solar energy in target cooperative areas) to reduce GHG emissions. \n \n13. \nThe project will rehabilitate water management infrastructure through de-silting works and \nupgrades of design standards to withstand climate variability and projected climate changes, and \ninstall drip irrigation systems to improve yields and deliver exportable mango fruit. The project will \nsupport the construction of climate-proofed postharvest units at farm cooperatives. It will improve \nclimate resilience of farm-to-market roads by increasing the height of embankments, promoting \ncross drainage, and selecting permeable materials, among other measures. The sustainability of \nthe infrastructure is ensured through an integrated approach to operation and maintenance (O&M) \npractices, focusing on institutions, capacity building, financing, and technologies. \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Climate-smart  agriculture  and  agribusiness  promoted.  Key  activities \ninclude (i) deploying climate-resilient varieties; (ii) strengthening the capacity for climate-friendly \nproduction practices and technologies; and (iii) promoting farm mechanization and extension. The \nproject will support the Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute to produce, \nmultiply, and distribute climate-resilient varieties of rice and maize and to improve weaning and \nacclimatization of mango  and cassava. The  project  will  train at  least  40,000 farmers  (of  which \n16,000 are women) on CSA practices. It will demonstrate laser land leveling to improve water use \nefficiency  and  enhance  the  capacity  of  farmers\u2019  water  user  groups  to  operate  and  manage \nirrigation schemes. The project will construct and upgrade four farm mechanization workshops \nand four agribusiness training facilities to train farm water user communities, women farmers, and \nmembers of agricultural cooperatives in infrastructure O&M and farm mechanization.   \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Enabling  environment  for  climate-friendly  agribusiness  enhanced.  The \nproject will support the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) and the Ministry of \nCommerce  in  creating  a  favorable  policy  environment  for  agribusiness  to  mobilize  the  private \nsector participation through PPPs and contract farming. Activities include (i) formulating climate-\nfriendly  agribusiness  policies  and  standards;  (ii)  promoting  green  finance  and  risk-sharing \nmechanisms; and (iii) supporting climate risk management through ICT. The project will provide \nsupport  for  farm  product  certification,  quality,  and  resilience  standards,  including  Cambodia\u2019s \ngood agricultural practice and organic fertilizer standards. The project will support cooperatives \n\n                                                \n13  The  impact  is  reflected  in  enhanced  productivity,  climate  resilience,  quality  and  safety,  value  addition,  and  rural   \n\nhousehold incomes. \n\n14  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nin  becoming  sustainable  agribusiness  ventures  by  linking  up  with  the  private  sector  and  by \nestablishing crop-centric PPP forums.

The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The sector \nlending  modality  is  appropriate  for  this  project  because  the  government  has  a  robust  sector \ndevelopment plan (footnote 1) and has demonstrated adequate capacity to implement it. Overall \nsector policies are adequate but need improvement to enable the growth of agribusinesses. The \nmodality  also  enables  the  government  to  identify  and  finance  additional  subprojects  while \ncontinuing to execute necessary policy reforms in implementing the sector development plan.16 \n \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance expenditures related to works, \n18. \nequipment, consulting services, and incremental operating costs. GCF will provide cofinancing on \na cost-sharing basis in the form of a loan equivalent to $10 million and a grant equivalent to $30 \nmillion, to be administered by ADB.

The \nproject team incorporated adaptation measures in terms of siting, construction, and upgrades of \ninfrastructure to reduce climate change risks. The project team conducted technical due diligence \nfor three representative subprojects: (i) Trapaing Run irrigation and modernization; (ii) agricultural \ncooperative cassava chip drying, processing, and storage; and (iii) Tram Kak  drip irrigation for \nimproved  mango  production.  The  team  evaluated  representative  subprojects  against  eligibility \ncriteria,  which  are  detailed  in  the  PAM.  The  project  incorporates  a  participatory  development \napproach,  whereby  beneficiary  farmers  will  participate  in  the  design  and  implementation  of \nsubprojects. Cooperatives and farmers will be partially responsible for the O&M of infrastructure. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe  project  team  conducted  an  economic  and  financial  analysis  for  the  representative \nsubprojects. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Trapaing Run irrigation subproject \nis 13.1%, based on increased yield and cropping intensity. The Tram Kak drip irrigation subproject \nyields an EIRR of 22.5%, based on improved yield and higher percentage of grade A mango fruit. \nThe cassava cooperative subproject yields an EIRR of 18.8%, based on a higher cassava price \ndue  to  processing  and  off-season  sales.  The  sensitivity  analysis  considered  several  downside \nscenarios: (i) a 10% increase in subproject costs, (ii) a 10% increase in operating costs, (iii) a \n10% reduction in benefits, and (iv) a combination of all three scenarios. In all scenarios, the EIRRs \nfor all subprojects exceed 9% and are economically viable. The project, especially in outputs 2 \nand  3,  generates  other  benefits  that  could  not  be  monetized,  such  as  (i)  sound  agribusiness \npolicies that attract private sector investment; (ii) stronger institutional and human capacity; and \n(iii) other environmental benefits from CSA, biodigesters, and laser land leveling.   \n \n22. \nFor the irrigation subprojects, the beneficiaries will perform routine O&M. The project will \neither establish and/or strengthen farmers\u2019 water user communities and enhance their capacity \nfor O&M. The financial analysis indicates that the subproject will generate sufficient incremental \nnet  income for  the  beneficiaries  to  contribute  to  routine  O&M.  However,  periodic  maintenance \ntypically  requires  more  resources,  specialized  equipment,  and  skills  beyond  the  ability  of  the \nbeneficiaries. In 2016, the Ministry of Economy and Finance allocated an annual O&M budget of \n$15 million. As the funding is allocated upon request by the implementing agencies, the project \nimplementation consultants will assist the agencies to tap into this fund for periodic O&M. For drip \nirrigation system and cooperative storage facilities, orchard owners and cooperative members are \nexpected to take responsibility for periodic and routine O&M. The annual net operating cash flows \nof  these  subprojects  are  positive,  indicating  that  the  beneficiaries  will  have  sufficient  financial \nresources to provide for O&M. All subprojects will develop a viable and realistic O&M plan. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nC. \n \n23. \nProject implementation, financial management, and procurement will be aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s  standard  operating  procedures.  The  existing  institutional  structures  for  financial \nmanagement are adequate. The pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate as several \ngovernment staff members are conversant with the financial management guidelines of ADB. All \nprocurement financed by ADB will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time).17 The project procurement risk is moderate. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MAFF.  The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe project is classified general intervention. It will benefit at least 390,000 people (80,000 \nhouseholds) by increasing their net incomes.18 It will promote inclusive economic growth, reduce \npoverty, and provide rural jobs and improved services, including the development of partnerships \nbetween farmers, cooperatives, processors, distributors, and traders. Farmers will produce quality \nproducts on time and with continuity of supply. Landless and poor households will be included in \nagribusiness, farm mechanization, and O&M training. Identified poor households in project areas \nwill be targeted for jobs related to civil works. Landless and poor farmers will have the opportunity \nto access off-farm and on-farm employment related to postharvest support services. \n \n25. \nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project team prepared a \ngender  action  plan,  which  includes  gender  actions,  performance  indicators,  and  targets  to \npromote women\u2019s  voice and active participation  in project  activities.19 The project  will  promote \ngender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  by  boosting  women\u2019s  capacity  in  CSA  production \nand  processing,  management  and  business,  farm  machinery  use  and  maintenance,  and  by \nstrengthening links between women-led enterprises and the agribusiness industry. In addition, a \ndetailed gender analysis of value chains will inform the refinement of the gender action plan and \nthe development of a gender-responsive agribusiness policy. Women will be targeted for training \nand jobs in infrastructure-related rehabilitation and O&M, and as decision-makers in the selection \nof climate-resilient varieties. The project will work in close partnership with the Women Farmers\u2019 \nNetwork and MAFF\u2019s Gender and Children Project Support Unit and strengthen their capacity to \nensure sustainability of gender mainstreaming efforts in the sector. \n \nE. \n \n26. \ncategories are as follows. \n \n27. \nEnvironment (category B). The project is expected to achieve significant environmental \nbenefits,  including  cumulative  reduction  of  240,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  of  GHG \nemissions,  improved  resilience,  and  increased  crop  diversity  in  the  project  areas.  The  project \nteam conducted environmental due diligence for three representative subprojects and prepared \na sample initial environmental examination, including an environmental management plan, for the \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n17  Universal  procurement  will  apply  as  per  ADB.  2013.

The  government  prepared  the \nenvironmental  codes  of  conduct  and  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  to \nguide  the  screening  and  categorization  of  subprojects,  identify  potential  impacts  and  prepare \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  as  required,  and  uploaded  them  to  the  ADB  website  in \nJanuary 2018.21 Only subprojects classified as category B or C will be financed. All subprojects \nwill be screened for climate risks and incorporate risk reduction measures. \n\n28. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). Due diligence conducted for three representative \nsubprojects shows no need (or only minimal need) for land acquisition, and none will result in any \nphysical or economic displacement.22 However, as most of the subprojects will be prepared after \nBoard  approval,  the  government  prepared  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework \n(LARF) to guide the screening and selection of subprojects as well as the resettlement planning \nprocess, and uploaded the LARF to ADB\u2019s website in January 2018.23 Only subprojects classified \nas  category  B  or  C  will  be  financed.  The  government  will  prepare  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  LARF  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for  any \nsubproject entailing involuntary resettlement impact.  \n\n29. \nThe  General  Department  of  Resettlement  (GDR)  under  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance  together  with  the  project  management  unit,  and  with  support  from  the  project \nimplementation consultants, will update due diligence reports, and conduct due diligence for all \nsubprojects  identified  after  Board  approval.  A  screening  checklist  will  be  applied  to  (i)  reject \nsubprojects with significant negative impacts; and (ii) assess impacts and confirm categorization \nof subprojects as either B or C. For subprojects involving voluntary land donation only in case of \nminimal land requirement, GDR will conduct due diligence as defined in the LARF. If negotiated \nsettlement (willing buyer-willing seller) is used: (i) GDR will involve a third party to validate and \ndocument the process; and (ii) GDR will submit the report with supporting documents to ADB for \nconcurrence  and  no  objection  before  any  civil  works  commence.  If  the  land  is  acquired \ninvoluntarily, the GDR will prepare a land acquisition and resettlement plan in accordance with \nthe LARF, compensate for all affected land and/or assets, and send to ADB for concurrence and \ndisclosure prior to issuance of the bidding documents.     \n\n30. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). No indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities reside in \nthe areas of sample subprojects. However, some ethnic minorities may live in project provinces \nwho could be impacted by subprojects chosen during project implementation. Impacts are largely \nexpected to be positive. The project will not finance any category A subprojects. The executing \nagency prepared an ethnic minority development framework to ensure inclusion, full consultation, \nand  participation  of  ethnic  minority  households,  which  was  uploaded  to  the  ADB  website  in \nJanuary  2018.24  The  institutional  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  to  manage  impacts  on \nindigenous  peoples,  as  verified  during  due  diligence,  is  considered  adequate.  Adequate \nresources have been allocated to the preparation and implementation of social and environmental \nsafeguards,  and  to  their  monitoring  and  reporting.
