The Liupanshan project area in the NHAR is one of \n14 contiguous  high-poverty  lagging  areas  targeted  by  the  national  government.  It  comprises \nseven of the NHAR\u2019s 21 counties,5 and its population of 2.39 million is just over one-third of the \nNHAR\u2019s  total  population.  It  is  one  of  the  poorest  areas  of  the  PRC,  with  38%  of  the  farmers \n(over 600,000 people) under the national poverty line of CNY2,300 of annual income per capita. \nHui minorities make up 59% of the population. According to the Poverty Alleviation Office (PAO) \nof the NHAR, 76% of the administrative villages in the project area are classified as poor. The \nNHAR  targets  eradication  of  poverty  in  the  Liupanshan  area  by  the  end  of  2018,  with  some \ncounties, including Pengyang, Longde, and Jingyuan, to be free of poverty by 2017.6 \n \n4. \nRural roads and poverty. Inadequate access is an important cause of the high levels of \npoverty,  related  to  the  mountainous  topography  of  the  Liupanshan  area.  Poor  connectivity \nbetween  urban  and  rural  areas  constrains  economic  growth  and  limits  the  extent  to  which  the \nbenefits of growth can be spread among the population. About 77% of people in the Liupanshan \narea rely on agriculture for their livelihood. Local farmers often travel along unpaved rural roads to \ntowns  to  sell  their  produce,  but  during  rainy  periods  unpaved  roads  become  impassable  and \nperishable  crops  cannot  reach  the  market.  Poor  accessibility  also  inflicts  high  costs  to  access \nsocial  services,  reduces  non-farming  employment  opportunities,  and  further  isolates  minority \ncommunities. Improved roads would provide poor farmers with more reliable access to economic \nopportunities,  information,  education,  health,  and  other  services.  It  is  therefore  essential  to \naccelerate  the  development  of  better  roads  to  connect  rural  areas  to  urban  growth  centers  and \nmarkets. The project includes an impact analysis of road development on poverty reduction, which \nwill provide key  information for understanding the trickle-down effects on poverty reduction from \nrural road improvements in lagging areas.    \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government  of  the  PRC,  Ministry  of  the  State  Council  Leading  Group,  Office  of  Poverty  Alleviation  and \nDevelopment.  2011.

Yinchuan, NHAR.  \n4  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Ningxia Liupanshan \n\nPoverty Reduction Rural Road Development Program (TA 8771-PRC).  \n\n5  The seven counties are Haiyuan, Jingyuan, Longde, Pengyang, Tongxin, Xiji, and Yuanzhou.  \n6  Ningxia Poverty Alleviation Office. 2016. 13th Five-Year Poverty Reduction Plan. Yinchuan, NHAR. \n\n \n\n\fRural  road  improvement.  The  seven  project  counties  together  have  a  rural  road \n5. \nnetwork  of  11,600  kilometers  (km),  of  which  19%  are  class  III  and  78%  are  class  IV  or \nunderclass.  Within  the  rural  road  network,  3,000  km  are  unpaved  (almost  exclusively  village \nroads),  and  an  additional  4,500  km  of  paved  roads  are  in  poor  or  very  poor  condition  that \nrequires rehabilitation. The Ministry  of Transport  aims  to improve the  transport  situation in the \npoverty areas as a basic requirement for poverty reduction,7 and has been allocating significant \nsubsidies to improving rural access in these designated poverty areas.8 This has resulted in the \nrural  road  network  in  Ningxia  tripling  in  size  and  becoming  largely  paved.  NHAR\u2019s  13th  Five-\nYear Plan aims to provide paved road access to all the administrative villages (200 remaining). \nThe  project  targets  the  Liupanshan  area  as  a  whole  and  fills  the  priority  gaps  needed  to \nenhance (i) direct connection to poor villages through rural feeder roads improvement, and (ii) \nurban\u2013rural connection through enhancement of the rural trunk road network. It will improve 435 \nkm of rural roads, benefiting 116,000 poor people.   \n  \nRoad  maintenance  and  climate  risks.  The  volume  of  medium  maintenance9  carried \n6. \nout  each  year  is  insufficient  to  slow  down  deterioration  of  the  poor-condition  rural  roads  and \nkeep the rural road network in a maintainable state. In addition, climate change will result in an \nincrease  in  the  intensity  and  frequency  of  extreme  rainfall  events  and  rainfall-induced  floods, \nmudslides,  and  landslides  in  the  mountainous  topography  and  erosion-prone  soil  condition. \nMedium  maintenance  works  are  largely  carried  out  by  the  maintenance  stations,  which  lack \nskills and equipment, resulting in poor quality work that rapidly becomes damaged again. At the \nsame time, the maintenance stations spend much of their time on cleaning and clearing works \nthat  are  better  outsourced  to  local  residents,  allowing  the  maintenance  stations  to  focus  on \nsmall  pavement  repairs.  The  project  will  enhance  more  sustainable  maintenance  practices \nthrough  the  use  of  skilled  private  contractors  for  medium  maintenance  and  local  women\u2019s \ngroups for routine maintenance. \n \n7. \nRoad safety. Road safety remains a significant issue. The project area contains many \nhigh-risk  rural  roads  with  significant  traffic  volume  and  a  mix  of  heavy  vehicles,  automobiles, \nmotorcycles,  nonmotorized  vehicles,  and  pedestrians.  Many  accidents  are  attributed  to  driver \nerror  aggravated  by  the  steep,  mountainous  terrain.  In  many  cases,  dangerous  road  conditions \ncan  be  addressed  by  modest  design  interventions  at  relatively  low  cost.  The  development  and \ninstitutionalization  of  modern  road  safety  design  and  management  approaches  will  lead  to  a \nsustainable  reduction  in  road  deaths  and  injuries.  The  project  will  improve  rural  road  safety  by \ndeveloping  and  implementing  a  system  of  road  safety  assessments  and  audits,  which  could  be \nreplicated throughout the NHAR after successful implementation. \n \n8. \nStrategic relevance and value addition. Maintaining sustainable rural connectivity is a \nstrategic  priority  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for  the \nPRC.10  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative11  in  the  areas  of \npoverty  reduction,  road  safety,  and  social  sustainability  and  with  the  NHAR\u2019s  13th  Five-Year \nPlan  on  poverty  reduction  and  transport.  The  project  has  drawn  on  lessons  from  the  Ningxia \n                                                \n7  Government  of  the  PRC,  Ministry  of  Transport.  2013.

The  outcome  will  be  an  improved  rural  transport  network  in  Liupanshan, \nparticularly in poor areas. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput 1: Priority rural roads rehabilitated and upgraded. This component includes \n10. \n(i) rehabilitation and upgrading of high-volume rural trunk roads connecting high-poverty areas \nwith  national  or  provincial  highways,  and  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  paving  of  rural  feeder  roads \nreaching further into poor villages. Specific outputs include improvement of (i) seven rural trunk \nroads (266.7 km) connecting 63 administrative villages (42 of  which are poor) and 126 natural \nvillages;14 and (ii) 21 rural feeder roads (168.3 km) linking 47 administrative villages (41 of which \nare designated poor) and 111 natural villages (84 of which lack paved road access). Output 1 \nalso incorporates road safety and climate adaptation measures for the project roads. \n \n11. \nOutput  2:  Rural  road  safety  and  sustainability  enhanced.  Project  assistance  to  the \ncounty  transport  bureaus  (CTBs)  will  enhance  the  coverage  and  efficiency  of  maintenance \nimplementation by engaging women\u2019s maintenance groups for routine off-pavement maintenance \non all project feeder roads and by outsourcing medium maintenance works to private contractors. \nWomen\u2019s  maintenance  groups  will  carry  out  routine  maintenance,  with  initial  support  to  be \nprovided  through  technical  assistance  funded  by  the  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation \nFund.15  This  assistance  will  develop  a  strategy  for  the  replication  and  mainstreaming  of  the \napproach in the area. The project will also carry out road safety audits for the rural trunk roads, \nincorporating  the  recommendations  into  the  project  designs,  and  provide  capacity  building  and \nsupport to the CTBs to carry out road safety assessments on the existing rural roads. \n \n12. \nOutput  3:  Impact  evaluation  conducted  and  project  implementation  capacity \nimproved. An impact evaluation will measure the impact of the project on poverty reduction in \nthe  Liupanshan  target  area.  The  project  will  conduct  an  end-line  survey  together  with  the \nanalysis,  following  the  predesigned  evaluation  methods  and  using  a  baseline  survey  to  be \nconducted in 2016 employing e-survey tools.16 The PAOs of the NHAR and the project counties \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2013.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the project administration manual (PAM).18 \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nNovember 2016\u2013December 2021 \n31 December 2021 (loan closing date: 30 June 2022) \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement (Asian Development \nBank [ADB]-financed contract \npackages) \nConsulting services \n\nNingxia Foreign Debt Leading Group \nDepartment of Finance, Development and Reform Commission, \nDepartment of Transport, Poverty Alleviation Office, Audit Office, and \nother agencies of the autonomous region level (members) \nNingxia Hui Autonomous Region government \nTransport bureaus of Haiyuan, Jingyuan, Longde, Pengyang, Tongxin, \nXiji, and Yuanzhou counties \nProject management office in Ningxia Department of Transport, eight \nstaff, including the director \nNational competitive \nbidding \n\n9 contracts \n\nQuality- and cost-\nbased selection (80:20) \nIndividual consultant \n\n60 person-months \n\n24 person-months \n\n$400,000 \n\n$166.1 million \n($5.6 million\u2013\n$26.9 million) \n$800,000 \n\n                                                \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nAspects \n\nRetroactive financing and/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nselection \n\n(5 contracts, \n3 packages) \n\nAdvance contracting and retroactive financing is proposed for consulting \nservices and civil works of rural trunk roads 12 months before the date of \nthe loan agreement, subject to a maximum amount equivalent to 20% of \nthe loan amount. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n19. \nPlanning. The sector assessment reveals deficiencies in the previous planning practices \nfocused on developing a high-class network of north\u2013south and east\u2013west roads, without taking \nsufficient  account  of  traffic  forecasts  and  upgrading  needs,  causing  over-dimensioning  in \nseveral  cases.  Consequently,  rehabilitation  received  insufficient  attention,  despite  two-fifths  of \nthe rural road network being in poor or very poor condition. Road improvements for connecting \npoor villages were not prioritized systematically and often drew on the personal knowledge and \njudgment  of  CTB  staff.  The  project  roads  were  selected  to  enhance  poverty  impact,  among \nother  things,  by  prioritizing  connection  to  poverty  villages  identified  by  the  Ningxia  PAO.  The \nproject\u2019s  road  works  were  designed  for  (i)  rehabilitation  and  paving  of  roads  in  poor  and  very \npoor  conditions,  aimed  at  providing  and  reinstating  paved  road  access  to  rural  poor \ncommunities without any change to the technical class of the roads; and (ii) upgrading of rural \ntrunk  roads  with  justifiable  traffic  volumes  to  a  higher  technical  class,  in  line  with  national \nstandards. \n \nSustainability.  The  massive  scale  of  rural  road  construction  in  2000\u20132009  was  not \n20. \ncomplemented  by  a  similar  increase  in  maintenance  funding  and  implementation  capacity. \nRoutine  maintenance  is  often  lacking,  especially  in  lower  level  rural  roads,  leading  to \nwidespread damage. The sustainability of rural roads was put at further risk by a lack of medium \nmaintenance  and  the  poor  quality  of  major  maintenance  works,  causing  accelerated \ndeterioration  of  the  rural  road  network.  The  project  includes  a  specific  component  aimed  at \nimproving rural road maintenance coverage and implementation, and enhancing CTB capacity \nfor  outsourcing  off-pavement  routine  maintenance  to  local  women\u2019s  groups  and  medium \nmaintenance works to qualified private contractors. \n \n21. \nRural  road  safety.  Increasing  traffic  volumes  and  speeds  on  rural  roads  is  leading  to \nmore  traffic  accidents  and  fatalities.  The  NHAR  has  been  funding  road  safety  engineering \nmeasures since 2015, with road safety assessments carried out in most county roads. However, \nthe CTBs tend to lack skilled experts and guidelines for road safety. The project will pay specific \nattention  to  enhancing  skills for  conducting road  safety  assessments  and  applying  road safety \naudits to rural trunk roads. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nEconomic analysis. A cost\u2013benefit analysis has been conducted for the rural trunk roads \npackage  as  well  as  the  rural  feeder  roads.  Overall,  the  project  is  economically  viable  with  an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13.5%. The evaluations of individual trunk roads show \nEIRRs  of  10.2%\u201318.1%  and  a  combined  EIRR  of  13.8%.  At  the  county  level,  when  the  rural \n\n \n\n\ffeeder roads are added, the EIRRs  are 7.8%\u201318.3%. The improvement from unpaved to paved \nrural feeder roads is further justified through the unquantified socioeconomic impacts of improved \nyear-round  accessibility  to  markets  and  services  directly  targeting  the  poor  population,  including \nethnic minorities. These socioeconomic benefits are expected to include (i) increased agricultural \nproduction and marketing; (ii) local market development; (iii) increased wages, consumption, and \nemployment;  (iv)  reduced  poverty;  (v)  positive  impacts  on  transport  speeds,  costs,  and  travel \npatterns; (vi) improved access to health services and education; and (vii) benefits for women. \n \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  sustainability  analysis  for  the  project  indicates  that \n23. \ncounterpart  funding  availability  and  debt  service  from  the  project  counties  are  acceptable  in \ncomparison  with  overall  local  government  revenues  and  expenditures.  Average  annual \ncounterpart  funding  is  estimated  to  account  for  10.2%  of  the  projected  local  government \nrevenues and 0.6% of the expenditures during the implementation period. Annual debt service \nis estimated to be 2.3% of projected government revenues in the first year of repayment and will \ndecline thereafter. There is a risk that operation and maintenance will be underfunded. Although \nthe  annual  minimum  operation  and  maintenance  requirement  is  0.01%\u20130.07%  of  projected \nrevenues  during  2019\u20132025,  it  has  historically  been given  low  priority.  Local  governments  are \nunder some funding pressure because of their poor fiscal history, but the central and provincial \ngovernments will provide the necessary support given the important role this project will play in \nachieving the poverty reduction goal in the Liupanshan area. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as amended from  time to time). Financial  management \nrisk  is  considered  moderate,  as  is  procurement  risk,  despite  the  involvement  of  multiple \nimplementing  agencies  (CTBs)  and  lack  of  experience  of  the  PMO  and  the  CTBs  in  ADB \nprojects,  because  of  the  existence  and  correct  application  of  generally  accepted  accounting \nprinciples. To mitigate these risks, action plans have been prepared for both procurement and \nfinancial  matters.  PMO  and  CTB  staff  will  be  trained  in  ADB  procurement  and  disbursement \nprocedures  and  guidelines.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the governments of PRC and the NHAR. The relevant sections \nof ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included in all procurement documents and contracts. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote \n18).  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nPoverty. A total of 702,600 poor people accounts for 17.4% of the total rural population, \nand  1,100  villages  designated  as  poor  account  for  48.1%  of  the  total  number  of  villages.  The \naverage  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  in  the  project  counties  was  CNY12,778  in  2013, \nwhich was only 32.4% of the NHAR average and 30.5% of the national average. The economic \ndevelopment  level  measured  by  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  varies  considerably  within \nthe project counties. Yuanzhou county had the highest level, 120% higher than that of Haiyuan. \nThe most important causes of poverty in the Liupanshan area are insufficient access to credit, \nillness  and  medical  expense,  lack  of  employment  opportunities  and  labor  skills,  and  bad  road \nconditions that limit transportation of products and access to schools, services, and markets. \n \nThe  project  is  a  geographically  targeted  poverty  intervention.  The  number  of  poor \n26. \nbeneficiaries comprises 52% of the total beneficiaries.  The improvement of rural feeder roads \nwill  provide  direct  access  to  rural  farmsteads  and  fields,  generating  new  opportunities  for \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\ffarmers  to  shift  to  higher-value  crops,  increase  production,  and  market  directly  to  traders.  A \npositive impact on farmgate prices, and consequently incomes, is expected. Year-round access \nwill  be  delivered  as  the  project  will  connect  poor  villages  to  the  surfaced  road  network.  The \nproject will conduct an impact evaluation study to assess the impact of the road improvements \non poverty reduction. \n \n27. \nSocial and gender. Better road connectivity and reduced transport costs and travel time \nwill  also  improve  access  to  employment  opportunities  and  social  services.  The  project  is \nestimated  to  create  about  1,800  jobs  during  the  construction  period,  of  which  760  will  be \nunskilled jobs and 1,040 will be skilled jobs. The road safety output of the project will result in \nsafer  roads.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  as  improved  road \nconditions  will  benefit  women  with  easier,  faster,  and  safer  travel;  increase  their  mobility;  and \nfacilitate more productive use of their time. Measures to address gender issues in project design \nand  implementation  have  been  incorporated  in  the  gender  action  plan  and  other  project \ndocuments. Specific measures include (i) traffic safety improvements incorporated in the project \ndesign,  (ii) public  participation  meetings  at  all  stages  of  the  project  involving  at  least  50% \nwomen,  (iii)  30%  of  total  unskilled  construction  jobs  for  local  women,  and  (iv)  training  and \nemployment  of  local  women  in  at  least  22  road  maintenance  groups.  Project  information \ndissemination, training, and other activities will be conducted in times and places convenient to \nwomen  with  respect  to  their  schedule  and  in  a  manner  that  women  can  easily  understand. \nWomen will be equally entitled to compensation for land acquisition and house demolition. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  category  B  for  environment.  A  consolidated  initial \n28. \nenvironmental  examination  and  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  which  cover  all \nproject components, have been prepared. These documents comply with the PRC\u2019s regulatory \nrequirements  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  and  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite in August 2016. Public consultations were carried out to inform the project design and \nenvironmental  assessment  process,  and  will  continue  during  project  implementation.  Capacity \ndevelopment  and  institutional  strengthening  will  be  provided  to  minimize  environmental  risks. \nEnvironmental  complaints  will  be  handled  through  a  project  safeguards  grievance  redress \nmechanism.  Carbon  dioxide  emissions  are  estimated  at  about  84,000  tons  in  2033  from  the \nseven rural trunk roads and less than 100,000 tons in 2030 for the 21 rural feeder roads. Total \ncarbon  dioxide  emissions  from  the  project  roads  will  be  less  than  the  ADB  threshold  of \n100,000 tons/year in the long term. \n \n29. \nAll  proposed  rural  trunk  roads  and  rural  feeder  roads  are  existing  roads  proposed  for \nimprovement.  Anticipated  construction  environmental  impacts  are  fugitive  dust,  noise,  water \nquality  impacts,  and disposal  of solid waste. One of  the  rural  trunk roads  is  about  500  meters \nfrom  the  Yunwushan  National  Nature  Reserve,  which  is  designated  to  protect  grassland \nresources.  The  EMP  and  project  assurances  include  specific  protection  measures  for  the \nreserve.  The  major  operational  impacts  are  noise  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  associated \nwith increases in traffic volume. The EMP outlines potential impacts, mitigation and monitoring \nrequirements,  and  an  environment \ntraining \nmeasures, \nimplementation budget that is 0.8% of the total project budget. \n \n30. \nClimate  change  risk.  The  project  is  classified  at  medium  risk  from  climate  change.  A \nclimate  risk  and  vulnerability  analysis  indicated  an  increased  risk  of  extreme  rainfall  events, \nflooding,  and  landslides  as  a  result  of  climate  change.  During  the  detailed  design,  a  15% \nincrease in design flood discharge will be used to examine the adequacy of bridge and culvert \ndesign under future climate conditions. An assurance requiring the consideration of climate risk \n\ninstitutional  arrangements, \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fand adaptation measures has been included in the project agreement. A range of hard and soft \nadaptation  measures  will  be  considered,  and  measures  adopted  and  the  incremental  cost  of \nadaptation will be confirmed following detailed design. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement. Land \n31. \nacquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  impacts  are  mainly  to  the  rural  trunk  roads  and  two  rural \nfeeder  roads.  Rural  road  improvement  will  result  in  partial  LAR  impacts,  as  they  are  existing \nroads.  The  LAR  impacts  have  been  adequately  assessed,  and  eight  resettlement  plans  have \nbeen prepared and disclosed on the ADB website. For the rural trunk roads and two rural feeder \nroads,19 an estimated 6,446 mu20 of land will be acquired permanently and 8,775 square meters \nof housing structures will be demolished. Land acquisition and house demolition will affect 2,031 \nhouseholds  with  8,780  persons.  No  household  will  lose  more  than  10%  of  farmland,  and  only \nnine  households  with  33  persons  will  suffer  complete  house  demolition  and  are  regarded  as \nseverely  affected.  For  the  other  19  rural  feeder  roads,  it  is  estimated  that  825  mu\u2013925  mu  of \nfarmland (99% is dry farmland) will be acquired, 541 households will be affected in 38 villages, \nand  no  house  will  be  demolished.  The  amount  of  ground  attachments,  which  mainly  include \nyoung  crop  and  public  facilities,  will  be  measured  after  the  preliminary  engineering  design. \nCapacity building for implementing agencies on social safeguards implementation is integrated \ninto the project design. Affected people were sufficiently consulted during the preparation of the \nresettlement plans. Approved resettlement plans will be disclosed to the affected people and on \nland \nthe  ADB  website.  The  estimated  cost  of  LAR \ncompensation;  house  relocation;  and  livelihood  support,  taxes,  fees,  and  contingency  funds. \nThe NHAR government confirmed that adequate counterpart funding would be made available \nfor  LAR.  An  independent  agency  will  monitor  resettlement  implementation  and  produce \nsemiannual  reports.  Public  consultations  will  continue  throughout  the  project  cycle,  and  a \ngrievance-redress mechanism will be established. \n \n32. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  category  B  for  ethnic  minorities.  The  Hui  are  the \nsole  ethnic  minority  in  the  project  area  and  the  overwhelming  population  along  most  of  the \nproposed  rural  trunk  and  feeder  roads.  Over  86%  of  the  direct  beneficiaries  are  Hui.  Some \nminor  impacts  will  occur  during  road  construction  and  operation,  but  these  will  not  have \nsignificant negative impacts on ethnic culture, social life, religion, or economic development. An \nethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  that  the  Hui  benefit \npositively  from  the  proposed  rural  road  project  and  that  any  negative  social  impact,  direct  or \nindirect,  is  mitigated  or  avoided.  The  actions  outlined  in  the  EMDP  and  integrated  into  the \nproject, in coordination with other stakeholders, are (i) road safety awareness, (ii) ethnic minority \ncultural  awareness  building  for  the  contractors  with  the  county  Ethnic  and  Religious  Affairs \nCommittees,  and  (iii) communicable  disease  prevention  training  for  villagers  by  the  Chinese \nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention. The executing and implementing agencies agreed \nto  provide  funds  and  implement  the  specified  activities  as  indicated  in  the  EMDP.  Public \nconsultations  were  conducted  through  formal  and  informal  focus  group  discussions  from \nOctober  2015  and  will  continue  throughout  the  project  period  by  the  PMO  safeguards  focal \npersons, including consultants and the external monitor. A grievance redress mechanism will be \nestablished to address affected people\u2019s concerns. An independent agency will monitor EMDP \nimplementation and produce semiannual reports. \n \n\nis  CNY98.66  million\u2014including \n\n                                                \n19 These two rural feeder roads were included in the Jingyuan and Longde resettlement plans while the other 19 rural \nfeeder  roads  were  included  in  Resettlement  Plan:  Other  Feeder  Roads  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n20 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  overall  risk  assessment  is  deemed  to  be  medium.  The  integrated  benefits  and \n33. \nimpacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.
