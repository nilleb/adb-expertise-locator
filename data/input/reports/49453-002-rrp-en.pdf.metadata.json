The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for the \nSouth Tarawa Water Supply Project, and if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \nThe project will combat factors that result in the high incidence of waterborne disease in \n2. \nSouth Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati, through the delivery and effective management of new and \nrehabilitated climate-resilient water supply assets and of improved hygiene practices. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nPublic health. South Tarawa is highly urbanized with a population of about 62,000 and \nan average population density of around 4,000 persons per square kilometer.1 Natural resources \n(particularly  land  and  potable  water)  are  highly  stressed.  Overcrowding  as  well  as  inadequate \nwater, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) coverage are closely linked to waterborne diseases such \nas  diarrhea  and  dysentery.  A  consistent  increase  in  the  incidence  of  diarrhea  averaged \napproximately 860 new cases per year  between 2002 and 2016.2  \n \n4. \nLimited freshwater resources. The Bonriki and Buota groundwater lenses are the only \nfreshwater  sources  in  South  Tarawa  that  are  suitable  for  producing  drinking  water,  with  a \ncombined sustainable yield of about 2,000 cubic meters per day.3 Since leakages from the water \nsupply network are estimated at 67%, only about 700 cubic meters per day, or 11 liters per person \nper day are available to the population through the public water supply network\u2014far below the 50 \nliters per person per day recommended to meet minimum health requirements.4 The projected \npopulation  growth  means  that,  without  intervention,  the  gap  between  supply  and  demand  will \ncontinue to widen. Alternative sources such as household wells are deemed unsafe because of \ngroundwater contamination from human and animal waste, while rainwater supplies cannot be \nrelied upon during droughts. \n \n5. \nClimate  change  and  disaster  risk  reduction.  Kiribati  faces  significant  challenges \nbecause of its vulnerability to climate change and disasters triggered by natural hazards. Rising \nsea levels are of particular concern, since most land lies less than 3 meters above sea level. The \nquality and quantity of freshwater provided by the Bonriki and Buota lenses is seriously threatened \nby climate-change-induced inundation and extreme weather events, including prolonged droughts. \nThe simultaneous or successive occurrence of inundation and drought could be catastrophic for \nwater supplies in South Tarawa, effectively reducing the lenses\u2019 yield to zero for periods of up to \n5 years. Taking a precautionary approach, the lenses cannot be relied upon as the main source \nof water in a future with climate change. In addition to drought, natural climate phenomena may \nalso affect demand for clean water on South Tarawa; heatwaves, for instance, will increase per \ncapita demand.\n\n                                                \n1  Projected from the 2015 Population and Housing Census. Land area of South Tarawa is 16 square kilometers. \n2  Ministry of Health and Medical Services. Data on Betio Town Council and Teinainano Urban Council hospitals in \n\nSouth Tarawa. Unpublished. \n\n3 Current water demand is around 4,500m3/d and is projected to increase to more than 6,000m3/day by 2040. \n4  G.  Howard  and  J.  Bartram.  2003.  Domestic  Water  Quantity,  Service,  Level  and  Health.  Geneva:  World  Health \n\nOrganization. http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/WSH0302.pdf. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n6. \nWater supply service levels. Water supplies in South Tarawa are rationed to 2 hours in \nevery  48  hours,  and  some  areas  receive  no  water  at  all.  Nonrevenue  water,  which  includes \nphysical losses from the network, unbilled authorized consumption, and commercial losses such \nas  theft  through  illegal  connections,  has  been  estimated  at  89%. 5  While  South  Tarawa\u2019s \ntransmission main was recently rehabilitated, the distribution network is dilapidated and accounts \nfor the vast majority of physical losses. Domestic customers have not paid for water since 2013, \nand customers\u2019 willingness to pay has been eroded by poor service levels; it will take significant \ncommunity engagement and advocacy, in addition to better service levels, to restore it. \n \n7. \nHygiene.  Appreciation of  the  importance  of good hygiene  is  low  in South Tarawa,  and \nsignificantly improved hygiene practices are needed to head off the surge in waterborne diseases \nas a result of overcrowding and inadequate provision of basic infrastructure. Behavioral change \ninterventions  which  promote  hand  washing  with  soap,  household  water  treatment  and  safe \nstorage  and  menstrual  hygiene  management  will  continue  to  play  a  role  in  reinforcing  key \nmessages and helping to ensure the long-term impacts of WASH interventions are realized.  \n \nOptions  for  increasing  water  supplies.  The  Tarawa  Water  Master  Plan  2010\u201320306 \n8. \nand  the  Tarawa  Water  and  Sanitation  Roadmap  2011\u20132030 7 both  concluded  that  seawater \nreverse  osmosis  desalination  represents  a  practical  and  affordable  longer-term  option  for \nsupplementing the water supplies. A comprehensive desalination feasibility study8 was conducted \nin 2012 and endorsed through peer review.9 Desalination is also considered a climate-adaptive \ntechnology,  given  its  ability  to  improve  resilience  to  water  quality  degradation  and  diversify \nexisting water supplies independent of rainfall.10 The government recently reasserted its interest \nin solar photovoltaic desalination to augment water supplies.11 Reducing water losses from the \nnetwork and improving nonrevenue water management are also key to ensuring the efficiency of \nwater supplies.  \n \nCapacity  of  key  institutions.  The  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Sustainable  Energy \n9. \n(MISE) leads national infrastructure development and the provision of public utility services. At \nthe operational level, the main actor is the Public Utilities Board (PUB), a state-owned enterprise \nwhich manages power generation, water supply, and sewage disposal in urban South Tarawa. \nCapacity gaps in key institutions could potentially be accentuated by the implementation of the \ncomplex  technology  (relative  to the  existing  water  supply  system)  that  desalination  represents \nand  which  will  require  long-term  skilled  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  overall \nmanagement.  The  project  will \nthe  outcomes  of  sector  assessments,  which \nrecommended long-term O&M contracts for critical infrastructure. Parallel capacity development \nactivities are included in the project through specialist support to PUB in key result areas and to \nvocational education and training. The project will also provide project management support to \nthe government. \n                                                \n5  The  International  Benchmarking  Network  for  Water  and  Sanitation  Utilities.  https://www.ib-net.org/  (accessed  12 \n\nformalize \n\nMarch 2019). \n\nPRIF.

The project will continue on from the ongoing Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)-supported  South  Tarawa  Sanitation  Improvement  Sector  Project  in \ncontributing  to  better  health  and  fewer  chronic  waterborne  illnesses  among  South  Tarawa \ncommunities.12 It is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for 11 Pacific \nsmall island countries, and is aligned with ADB\u2019s (i) Strategy 2030,13 (ii) Pacific Approach (2016\u2013\n2020),14 and (iii) Water Operational Plan 2011\u20132020.15 The project is consistent with the Kiribati \n20-Year Vision 2016\u20132036 (KV20).16 It is also aligned with the Kiribati Joint Implementation Plan \nfor Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management 2014\u20132023 and the Kiribati Integrated Energy \nRoadmap 2016\u20132025.17 \n \n11. \nValue added by ADB assistance. ADB has strong experience with Kiribati\u2019s development \nof water and other urban infrastructure through its South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector \nProject, which is on track. As an accredited entity of the GCF, ADB mobilized GCF grant financing \nfor the proposed project. It led the project\u2019s preparation, having funded the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  and  the  ongoing  project  design  advance  (PDA).19ADB\u2019s  experience  in \nimplementing  the  Ebeye  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project,20  which  involves  desalination \ntechnology in another densely populated Pacific island atoll, was applied in the development of \nthe project.21 ADB is well placed to help capture and disseminate lessons through its investment \nprogram and network of partners across the Pacific. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: health and climate change resilience of \nSouth Tarawa\u2019s  population  improved.22  The  project  will  have the following  outcome:  access  of \nSouth Tarawa\u2019s population to safe, climate-resilient water supplies increased.22 \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Climate resilient and low carbon water supply infrastructure. This will be \nachieved  by  building  a  desalination  plant  of  4,000  cubic  meters  per  day,  whose  energy \nconsumption is offset by a 2,500-kilowatt solar photovoltaic system, and by rehabilitating the water \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n12 ADB.  2011.

The  project  will  fund  consultants  in  the  PMU,  including  project  manager,  deputy  project \nmanager, project accountant, safeguards manager, and social development and gender specialist. \n\n31 Rainwater harvesting, household water wells,  groundwater from groundwater reserves in South Tarawa, potential \n\nnew groundwater sources in North Tarawa, and nonconventional sources of water were considered. \n\n32 For the proposed project, an economic operating lifetime of 20 years is expected. \n33 These  include  (i)  Fraser  Thomas  Partners.  2012.

Water use efficiency is a further adaptation strategy and will be achieved through more \neffective  nonrevenue  water  management,  e.g.,  by  strengthening  water  supply  infrastructure, \ninstitutional capacity, and community engagement. \n \n25.  Weak local capacity to sustain the sound long-term operation of the desalination plant is \ncounteracted through 5-year outsourced O&M contracts, which will be packaged with the works \nand delivered through a DBO contract encompassing both the desalination plant and water supply \nnetwork. The firm responsible for the DBO package will play a critical role in transferring capacity \nto PUB, and this skills transfer will be incorporated into the employer\u2019s requirements. \n \n26.  While desalination is an energy-intensive technology compared with conventional water \ntreatment, the project helps offset the energy consumed by the plant and the network by producing \nrenewable energy through solar photovoltaic technology, significantly reducing the overall O&M \ncost  of  potable  water  production. 34 A  2015  study  concluded  that  solar  photovoltaic-powered \nreverse osmosis desalination is the best renewable energy technology option for South Tarawa.35  \n \nB. \n \n27. \nThe project is found to be economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of \n9.1% and an economic net present value of $216,683. Substantial cost savings arise from the \ndesalination  plant\u2019s  use  of  solar  photovoltaic  energy  rather  than  diesel,  and  from  avoided \nhousehold-level treatment (i.e., boiling) before the consumption of water. The reduced incidence\nof waterborne diseases brings down the costs associated with medical care and lost productivity. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that economic viability worsens across all adverse scenarios, with \nthe project being more sensitive to changes in benefits. A user-pays approach to the water supply \ncomponent  will  be  developed  and  adopted,  with  affordability  and  willingness-to-pay  taken  into \nconsideration. Further, the government is expected to realize surplus resources sufficient to fund \nO&M  expenditures  not  covered  by  the  proposed  project,  but  the  risk  to  the  project\u2019s  financial \nsustainability  is  substantial  given  the  high  dependence  on  budgetary  support.  To  help  ensure \nfinancial  sustainability,  the  government  has  issued  a  cabinet  decision  formally  committing  it  to \nmeet, after project implementation, any additional financing that may be needed for the ongoing \noperation of the water supply system. \n \nC. \n \nThe  project  team  assessed  project-related  governance  risks  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n28. \nprocurement  and  financial  management  requirements.    The  overall  risk  was  assessed  to  be \nmoderate (defined as \u201clikely to occur\u201d) and will have low impact if it occurs. Effective mitigation of \nthese  risks  will  take  place  through  (i)  the  engagement  of  a  qualified  and  experienced  project \naccountant, who as part of the PMU and based in the Kiribati Fiduciary Services Unit (KFSU) will\nbe responsible for project disbursements, accounting, financial reporting, and record keeping; (ii) \nan action plan to mitigate the risks, which is detailed in the PAM and will be regularly reviewed \nand/or updated to ensure that the project responds dynamically to risks during implementation;  \n(iii)  inclusion  of  these  tasks  in  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  accountant;  (iv)  financial \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n\nReview Report.

The PMU, with support from the \nfirm recruited through the PDA as well as the project implementation assistance firm, will have \nthe requisite expertise to support the execution of DBO contracts and assist MISE in mitigating \ncontract  delays.  Project  management  functions  such  as  procurement,  contract  administration, \nworks  supervision,  and  project  accounting  will  be  assisted  by  the  PMU.  These  measures  are \nsatisfactory to mitigate the procurement risks described above. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 28). \n \nD. \n \n31. \nThe  provision  of  safe  and  sufficient  water  supplies  in  South  Tarawa  will  benefit  the \npeople\u2019s health by eliminating the current high dependence on contaminated water supplies. The \nreduction  in  waterborne  diseases  will  avoid  the  cost  of  medical  treatment,  lost  productivity  of \npatients and caregivers, and loss of lives. Other social benefits of improved water supply include \nimprovements  in  household  income  levels  and  security  of  livelihoods;  increased  school \nattendance;  and wider  social  and cultural  benefits  such  as  reduced stress  levels,  better family \nand  community  relations,  and  greater  ability  to  observe  religious  rites  and  customs.  Women, \nchildren, the elderly, and the most disadvantaged households that now bear a disproportionate \nshare of the burden of inadequate water services in South Tarawa will benefit the most. \n \n32. \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan \nwas prepared. Some of the gender targets to be implemented by the project involve establishing \nnew  connections  in  project  areas,  which  will  benefit  100%  households  headed  by  women; \nproviding  quarterly  financial  literacy  training  to  PUB  customers  (75%  of  them  women)  in  250 \ncommunities to  improve their  ability  to  pay for  water;  ensuring that  at least  50%  of  community \nmobilizers  are  women;  organizing  monthly WASH  awareness-raising  seminars for  students,  of \nwhom at least 50% are girls; making sure that at least 20% of new recruits to MISE\u2019s Water and \nSanitation Engineering Unit and PUB\u2019s Water Engineering Department are women, and that at \nleast 20% of PUB and MISE staff trained under the project are women; and involving at least 10% \nwomen in community work during civil works and/or employing them during O&M.  \n \nE. \n \n33. \nPolicy Statement (2009), and plans to mitigate and manage impacts were prepared.36 \n \n34. \nEnvironment  (category  B).

Due  diligence  was  undertaken  to  assess \npotential involuntary resettlement impacts on all the proposed sites. It found that the proposed \nwater supply infrastructure will not have significant involuntary resettlement impacts; impacts are \nconfined to minor land acquisition and/or lease, affecting assets such as crops and trees of an \nestimated 33 persons. The desalination plant is proposed to be constructed on land held by the \ngovernment on a long-term lease, and is not expected to pose any risks during implementation, \nsince  the  current  lease extends until  2040. Government  land  is generally  being  sought for  the \nlocation of the storage tanks, booster pump station, and solar installations, and only if government \nland is not available will private land be considered. The route for the water supply pipe network \nis  expected  to  align  with  existing  roads  but  may  require  some  private  land.  A  resettlement \nframework  was  prepared  to  guide  the  preparation  of  necessary  safeguard  documents  for  the \nwater  supply  network  upon  confirmation  of  the  exact  route  and  a  resettlement  plan  for  the \ndesalination plant, booster pumps, and solar installations.37 Consultations were held with affected \npersons  and  included  the  disclosure  of  draft  safeguard  documents;  they  will  continue  during \nproject implementation. \n \n36. \ngroup, and the project beneficiaries are not considered distinct and vulnerable.\n \n37. \nSince  PDA  is  financing  the  detailed  engineering  design  for  the  water  supply  network, \nsafeguard documents will be updated upon design completion. The project will support positions \nin the PMU for safeguards, which will enhance the institutional capacity of the borrower to manage \nenvironmental and social risks. The PDA and project implementation assistance consultants will \nsupport the PMU and provide capacity building and training as core elements of their terms of \nreference. Pursuant to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, ADB funds may not be applied to the \nactivities described on  the  ADB  Prohibited  Investment  Activities List set forth  in Appendix  5 of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.
