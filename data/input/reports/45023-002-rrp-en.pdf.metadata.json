I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hubei\u2013Yichang Sustainable Urban Transport \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project will (i) establish a bus rapid transit (BRT) corridor in Yichang city, Hubei \nprovince, (ii) support nonmotorized transport (NMT) along the BRT corridor, (iii) construct an \nurban bypass road, and (iv) strengthen institutional capacity. This will contribute to inclusive \ngrowth  and  environmentally  sustainable  development  by  improving  the  efficiency  and \nsustainability of urban transport and promoting more efficient freight logistics. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The urban population of the PRC amounted to 690.79 million in 2011, or 51.3% of the \ntotal  population.  Since  1978,  the  PRC\u2019s  urban  population  had  increased  by  more  than \n500 million (and another 300 million people are expected to move to cities by 2020). Such a \nhuge  rural\u2013urban  migration  was  unprecedented.  Millions  of  rural  peasants  became  urban \nresidents, which enabled a major shift in the economy from agriculture to manufacturing and \nservice employment, contributing to rapid economic growth and rising per capita incomes. As a \nresult of this massive migration, there is a need to expand second-tier cities to relieve pressure \non first-tier urban centers and provide efficient access to economic activities. Large investments \nare needed in urban infrastructure and service provision. A critical task is to develop sustainable \nurban transport systems that will give all urban residents access to centers of employment and \nservices, and do so in a way that is convenient, affordable, efficient, safe, and clean. \n \n4.  The central region of the PRC, where Hubei province is located, has become a major \ncenter  for  energy  production,  agricultural  processing,  and  high-technology  manufacturing.2 \nLarge hydropower facilities at Three Gorges Dam and Gezhou Dam provide low-cost energy. \nThe region has also developed as a transportation and logistics hub. Yichang benefits from \nrecent investments in railway infrastructure, including a new high-speed rail service, and road \nnetwork expansion. New and expanded terminal facilities for waterborne traffic on the Yangtze \nRiver further enhance regional connectivity and development. However, due to limitations in \nship-lock capacity at Three Gorges Dam and Gezhou Dam, additional road investments are \nneeded to support road-based transfer of goods between the upstream and downstream sides \nof the dam (pass-dam transshipment).3 \n \n5.  Yichang is a prefecture-level city, the second-largest city in Hubei province after Wuhan, \nthe provincial capital. Yichang has a total population of 4.1 million, of which 1.4 million is urban. \nThe urbanization rate of about 32% at the end of 2011 was well below the national average of \n51.3%.  Yichang\u2019s  urban  population  is  forecast  to  increase  to  2.8  million  by  2030  due  to \ncontinuing  migration.  Major  investments  are  needed  in  urban  infrastructure,  transport,  and \nrelated services to accommodate the growing population and support sustainable urbanization \nand inclusive growth. \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  In 2011, the secondary industry contributed 60.6% to Yichang's gross domestic product, the tertiary industry \ncontributed 28.2%, and the primary industry contributed 11.2%.  \n3  Pass-dam transshipment is the shipping of goods or containers by road or rail to an inland waterway port upstream \nor downstream of a dam to bypass the ship lock or ship-lifting facilities at the dam. ", "2 \n6.  Urban transport. Yichang has a linear urban form running east\u2013west along the Yangtze \nRiver valley. Most of the city is located on the north bank of the river, with three primary urban \narterial roads running in parallel to each other. Interregional traffic movements flow through the \nurban area. About 75% of all person-trips are made with private means of transport and are \nmainly concentrated in the central business district. While there is a bus priority system in the \nform of curb-side bus lanes, this has been less effective due to encroachment by illegal parking \nand hawker activities, among others. There is also lack of enforcement of traffic regulations. In \nview of the rapid growth of car ownership4 and limited land available for expansion of the urban \narea, the city will experience congestion, increasing road accidents, and vehicle emissions-\nrelated air quality problems unless a more sustainable approach to transport is established. \n \n7.  International  best  practice  indicates  that  one  of  the  key  elements  in  a  sustainable \ntransport system is to improve public transport and make it an attractive option for travelers. In \nthe PRC, bus-based public transport and NMT have received less attention than road building. \nThe mode shares of public transport and NMT are well below potential levels, and there is \ngrowing dependency on private vehicles. The present public transport system of Yichang will \nnot be able to cope with future travel demand, and the city\u2019s NMT facilities are unable to provide \na safe environment for pedestrians and bicycle users. An affordable, efficient public transport \nsystem coupled with safe, attractive NMT should be introduced. In most medium-sized cities \nand many large cities, BRT represents the best, most cost-effective, and most flexible option for \npublic  transport.5 Yichang\u2019s  linear  form  is  very  well  suited  for  BRT,  which  can  begin  by \nestablishing a core BRT corridor connecting the new railway station and provincial bus terminal, \nand then be extended in phases. As part of ongoing efforts to improve urban planning in \nYichang,  there  is  an  opportunity  to  introduce  safe,  seamless  NMT  routes  for  cyclists  and \npedestrians. Investments in BRT and NMT could well boost the share of public transport and \nreverse the decline of NMT. There is potential for Yichang to become a model for BRT and NMT \ndevelopment in medium-sized cities in the PRC. \n \n8.  Pass-dam transshipment freight. Three Gorges Dam is a major part of the Yichang \neconomy, and growth in associated freight transport has become a challenge for the transport \nsystem in Yichang. The bi-directional freight volume of the Three Gorges ship lock reached \n90 million tons in 2010 and is projected to reach 185 million tons in 2020 and 248 million tons in \n2030.  Due  to  limitations  in  ship-lock  capacity,  the  portion  of  traffic  requiring  pass-dam \ntransshipment could increase from 12.4 million tons in 2010 to 85 million tons in 2020, and \n148 million tons in 2030. A bypass road is therefore needed to handle this traffic growth without \ncausing congestion and traffic safety problems in the city center area. In addition, it is necessary \nto reinforce the logistics hub function of Yichang by improving access to the logistics parks and \ndeveloping manufacturing facilities. More efficient access to logistics facilities and increased \npass-dam transshipment capacity will contribute to stronger use of inland waterways, which is \nthe most economical and environmentally friendly mode of freight transport. \n \n9.  Strategic fit. The project is in line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC. It will (i) support inclusive growth and balanced \ndevelopment by promoting sustainable urbanization and (ii) contribute to resource efficiency and \nenvironmental sustainability by promoting efficient and sustainable urban transport.6 The focus \n                                                 \n4  From 2007 to 2008, the vehicle fleet increased by 14.7%, compared with a gross domestic product per capita \nincrease of 14.6%. \n5  The first line, Guangzhou BRT, was put into operation on 10 February 2010. It handles nearly 1 million passenger \ntrips  daily  with  a  peak  passenger  flow  of  29,900  passengers  per  hour  per  direction  (second  only  to  the \nTransMilenio BRT system in Bogota, Colombia). \n6  ADB. 2012.

", "    3 \non public transport and multimodal integration directly supports ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport \nInitiative. The project aligns with the development plan of the Three Gorges Modern Logistics \nCenter,7 a key priority of the National Development and Reform Commission under the 12th \nfive-year plan. \n \n10.  This is ADB's third project to support BRT in the PRC, after the Lanzhou Sustainable \nUrban  Transport  Project8 and  Jiangxi  Fuzhou  Urban  Integrated  Infrastructure  Improvement \nProject.9 It incorporates lessons learned in developing and implementing those projects. A key \nlesson  is  that  when  developing  BRT  and  NMT,  careful  attention  to  design  is  essential  to \noptimize system configuration and capacity to best serve user needs. An integrated approach is \nneeded for BRT design and NMT development, including careful coordination between BRT \ndesign, traffic management, and urban planning. Due to the specialized nature of BRT system \nplanning, design, and operations, it is useful to include a program of institutional strengthening \nand capacity building for the municipal bus company, project management office (PMO), and \nthe traffic police. \n \n11.  The BRT corridor in Yichang will serve all the major districts and major public transport \nfacilities, including the new high-speed railway station and provincial bus terminals. The project \nrepresents a new concept for small and medium-sized cities that links urban development to the \nexpansion of public transport. This project will be a model for sustainable transport development \nthat can be replicated in the PRC and across Asia. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the project will be an efficient, inclusive, and sustainable transport system \nin Yichang. The outcome will be the provision of efficient passenger and freight transport. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  Output  1:  Bus  rapid  transit  system.  A  23.9  kilometer  (km)  BRT  system  will  be \nimplemented in the median of the main arterial road in Yichang. Services will operate from the \nprovincial bus terminal in Yiling district, extend along the Yixing Avenue\u2013Yemingzhu Road\u2013\nDongshan Avenue\u2013Jucheng Road, and end at Yichang East railway station. The route will \nconnect the main residential and business districts with the city\u2019s new logistics and industrial \npark and the high-speed railway station. The BRT will include dedicated, center-running bus \nlanes, fully enclosed BRT stations, a bus management system and bus information system, a \nfare collection system, and parking management along the BRT corridor. \n \n14.  Output 2: Nonmotorized transport measures. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities (bicycle \nlane and bicycle parking) will be implemented along the BRT corridor and at key intersections. \nThis will help improve accessibility and safety for bus passengers and other NMT users. \n                                                 \n7  In  May  2010,  the  Comprehensive  Transportation  Study  Office  of  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission completed the Development Plan for the Three Gorges Modern Logistics Center. The plan includes \nnine  comprehensive  logistics  park  areas  and  an  urban  distribution  center  in  Yichang  (including  Huayan \nComprehensive Logistics Park Area, Taipingxi Logistics Park Area, Maoping Logistics Park Area, Yunchi Logistics \nPark Area, Honghuatao Logistics Park Area, and Three Gorges Airport Logistics Park Area). The logistics parks \nare selected to support the development of Three Gorges Logistics Center and expand logistics operational \ncapacity by creating an efficient multimodal logistics network through ports, railway, roads, and the airport. \n8  The project includes 12.4 kilometers (km) of BRT corridor development. The initial phase of BRT operations \ncommenced in December 2012. \n9  The Jiangxi-Fuzhou Urban Integrated Infrastructure Improvement Project includes 12.2 km of BRT development \nand an urban transport hub at new high-speed railway station. \n ", "4 \n15.  Output  3:  Road  network  improvement.  This  will  build  a  23.4  km  extension  of \nDongshan 4th Road to accommodate through-traffic and freight traffic, including pass-dam \ntransshipment. The road comprises (i) improvement of 12.3 km of Fazhan Avenue\u2013Bailinhe \nRoad Section (phase 1) to a road width of 44\u201370 meters (m); and (ii) improvement of the \n11.1 km Bailinhe Road to Xianfeng Road (phase 2) to class 1 highway, with a road width of \n24.5 m. The output includes 11 bridges and two tunnels. \n \n16.  Output  4:  Capacity  building  and  quality  assurance.  This  will  (i) support  project \nmanagement and implementation to ensure that project outputs are delivered on time and within \nbudget in accordance with ADB policies and procedures, develop and maintain the project \nperformance monitoring system, and assist with procurement and disbursement; (ii) support \ndetailed design review and safeguard implementation, monitoring, and reporting; and (iii) build \ncapacity in traffic management, road safety, and BRT operation and management. \n \nD.

The  government  requested  a  loan  of  $150.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to finance 29.1% of the project cost. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nterms and conditions as may be set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.10 ADB\u2019s loan \nwill cover civil works, equipment, capacity building and quality assurance, and taxes and duties \non the expenditures financed by ADB.11 The Yichang municipal government (YMG) will provide \n$365.1 million, including 154.5 million from the municipal budget and 210.6 million borrowed \n                                                 \n10  Interest includes a maturity premium of 0.20%.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  Technical due diligence confirmed that the project is economically viable and technically \nfeasible, with technology choices based on efficient and proven designs. The capacity of the \nYMG is considered adequate to implement the project\u2019s advanced technical and sustainable \ntransport aspects, based on its performance in past and ongoing urban transport development \nprojects.13 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The economic analysis compared the \u201cwith-project\u201d case of introducing BRT service and \nroad improvement against the \u201cwithout-project\u201d case of existing public transport services and \nroad  facilities.  The  estimated  costs  include  investment  in  civil  works  and  equipment,  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  and  operation  and  maintenance.  BRT  will  enable  faster  bus \noperating speeds and shorten passenger transport times. The project road improvement will \nincrease road capacity, leading to faster vehicle speeds, shortened transport time, and fewer \nroad accidents. The estimated benefits include savings in vehicle operating cost and travel time, \ntraffic and pedestrian safety benefits, and a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions. The \n2\nproject is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 17.8% and \nnet present value of CNY1,334.63 million at a 12.0% discount rate. Sensitivity analysis of \npotential cost overruns and benefit reductions demonstrates that project economic viability is \nrobust. Other benefits that could not be quantified include health benefits thanks to better air \nquality, and better quality of life thanks to more convenient transportation. \n \n23.  The  project  has  both  revenue-earning  and  nonrevenue  outputs.  The  road  network \nimprovements are not revenue-earning. The BRT output will generate revenue through the \ncollection of bus fares from passengers. The ticket revenue of the BRT will exceed the operating \nand maintenance cost of the BRT component. The estimated financial internal rate of return for \nthe BRT component is 4.8% before corporate income tax and 2.7% after tax.14 As the financial \ninternal rate of return after tax is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.56%, the \nBRT component is financially viable. The executing agency will periodically review and update \nfares to ensure that these are sufficient to meet the cost of service provision and are affordable \nfor poor and vulnerable groups. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocuments and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  the  PMO.  Specific  policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  12).  An \nassessment of financial management capacity indicates that the implementing and executing \nagencies  carefully  follow  PRC  policies  and  procedures  for  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement.  The  implementing  agency  has  strong  accounting  and  financial  management \n                                                 \n13 Project Technical Description (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 The business tax for transport entities is 3.36% of sales, and the corporate income tax for all businesses is 25.00% \nof profit. ", "    7 \ncapacity,  as  well  as  experience  in  managing  multiple  large  construction  projects  such  as \nYichang Logistics Center and  Xioting Wastewater Treatment Plant. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines, a poverty and social impact analysis \naimed at assessing transport and economic development needs of the people in the project-\naffected area. Urban traffic decongestion, safe and convenient public transport facilities, and \nroad  connectivity  for  neighboring  rural  areas  are  main  transport  requirements  of  the  local \npeople. The causes of poverty include lack of economic and employment opportunities, illness, \nand disability. The project will benefit 1.3 million people, both urban and rural. Within the project \narea, there are 32,673 urban poor and 39,100 rural poor. The project will endeavor to meet the \ntransport and economic development needs of people by mitigating traffic congestion, improving \ntraffic  efficiency  and  safety,  reducing  travel  time,  improving  public  transit  facilities,  and \nenhancing access to nonfarm employment and markets. People from low-income groups will get \npriority for job opportunities created during construction and operation of the project. \n \n26.  The project will facilitate the development of a sustainable transport system to meet the \ntransport needs of Yichang city as it continues to expand rapidly. A large number of urban \nresidents, including women and poor, are dependent on public transport. The proposed project \nwill provide them with a convenient and efficient mode of transportation to meet their everyday \nrequirements. The inclusive aspect of the project is strengthened by the NMT output, which will \nprovide pedestrians and cyclists with a dedicated, safe right-of-way within the city\u2019s main traffic \ncorridor.  The  extended  Dongshan  4th  Road  will  also  serve  the  transport  and  economic \ndevelopment needs of rural neighborhoods of the city. \n \n27.  Gender.  The  project  is  designed  with  distinct  gender-sensitive  features  to  boost \nwomen\u2019s inclusion and participation. All four project outputs include features that go toward \nmeeting gender-specific transport and economic development needs of the project beneficiary \npopulation. The poverty and social assessment (PSA) indicated that 51% of women use public \ntransport as the main mode of transportation, and 31% rely on walking. Women have particular \ntransport needs arising from their various social roles and patterns of mobility. They also have \npersonal safety concerns when using public transport. These gender-related concerns have \nbeen dealt with in the project design to ensure that women benefit from an urban transport \nsystem that is safe and convenient. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to (i) ensure \nwomen\u2019s  equitable  participation  in  public  consultation,  (ii) implement  the  gender-responsive \nfeatures  of  the  project,  (iii)  promote  employment  opportunities  for  women,  and  (iv)  build \ninstitutional capacity for gender mainstreaming. 15 Implementation of the GAP will be financed \nfrom the project budget and will be monitored through collection of sex-disaggregated data. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment. The project is classified as environment category A. An environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) report and environmental management plan (EMP) that comply with \nADB Safeguard Policy (2009) and PRC regulatory requirements have been prepared for the \nproject and were disclosed on the ADB website on 14 December 2012. The EIA concludes that \nanticipated environmental impacts and risks are modest and can be limited to an acceptable \nlevel through the implementation of the EMP and compliance with loan covenants. Capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening are proposed to minimize environmental risks. The \n                                                 \n15 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nEMP assesses potential impacts of the project components, sets out mitigation and monitoring \nmeasures, institutional arrangements, training requirements, and budgets for implementation of \nthe  EMP.  The  budget  for  implementation  of  the  EMP  is  $2,978,250.  This  includes \n$2,881,500 for mitigation measures, $80,000 for environmental monitoring, $9,600 for training \nand capacity development, and $7,150 for public consultation. \n \n29.  The BRT corridor will be constructed in an urban center that already experiences high \nnoise, and pollutants and CO  emissions from traffic. Modelling indicates that the introduction of \n2\nBRT will reduce daytime noise and CO  emission levels as a result of smoother traffic flow. \n2\nDongshan 4th Road is in a semi-urban setting and construction will result in permanent loss of \n101.52 hectares of plantation, patchy woodland, and artificial ponds of limited biodiversity value. \nDongshan 4th Road will divert heavy traffic from the city and contribute to a reduction in noise, \npollutants, and CO  emissions in the urban center. During construction, activities that generate \n2\ndust and noise have the potential to disturb residents and businesses along both the BRT \ncorridor and Dongshan 4th Road, and these will be subject to controls as specified in the EMP. \nTunneling and bridge works present environmental, occupational, and community safety risks, \nand will be subject to specific controls. The project will provide double-glazing for all households \nalong the BRT corridor and Dongshan 4th Road that are predicted to experience noise levels in \nexcess of the PRC noise standards for the assessed operational years (2018 to 2030). Two \nhouseholds will be resettled as a result of operational noise impacts of Dongshan 4th Road. \nPublic consultation was carried out to discuss the project design and EIA process and will \ncontinue  throughout  project  implementation.  Environmental  complaints  or  disputes  will  be \nhandled through a grievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \n30.  Resettlement. The project is category A for involuntary resettlement.16 The resettlement \nimpacts of the project include land acquisition in rural areas and demolition of rural and urban \nhouses and urban commercial structures (shops). Nine villages and one urban neighborhood in \nYichang city will be affected. The total permanent land acquisition is 1,797.5 mu. Demolition will \ninvolve 56,106.60 square meters (m2) of residential structures. Together, land acquisition and \ndemolition will affect 1,453 persons in 370 households. The project will also involve demolition \nof 325 m2 of shops along the BRT corridor that will affect 25 persons in nine shops. The project \nwill temporarily occupy 528.59 mu of land. \n \n31.  A draft resettlement plan has been prepared in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and adequately assesses the involuntary resettlement impacts of the project. \nThe draft resettlement plan has been disclosed to the affected persons and on the ADB website. \nThe plan will be finalized in line with the detailed engineering design and detailed measurement \nsurvey, disclosed to the affected people, and submitted to ADB for approval before awarding \ncivil works contracts. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement is CNY463.4 million \n(14.5% of total project cost). The YMG has assured ADB that adequate counterpart funding will \nbe made available. A resettlement implementation schedule has been prepared. The YMG has \nrelevant  experience;  nonetheless,  some  capacity  development  support  for  safeguards \nimplementation is included in the project. A resettlement specialist will be engaged to assist in \nimplementing  the  resettlement  plan.  The  PMO's  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  unit  will \ncoordinate internal supervision and reporting of plan implementation. The YMG will engage an \nexternal institute for semiannual monitoring and reporting. An acceptable grievance resolution \nmechanism  will  be  established  before  starting  the  civil  works,  to  deal  with  project-related \ngrievances. Public consultations were undertaken during project preparation and will continue \nthroughout the project cycle in accordance with the public consultation schedule. \n                                                 \n16 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  The  project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risk.  The  YMG  and  YMUCID  have \nsuccessfully carried out many large infrastructure projects and have substantial experience in \nproject implementation and management but no experience with ADB-financed projects. To \ncounteract the lack of experience with ADB procedures, training on ADB safeguards and project \nprocurement  and  monitoring  procedures  was  provided  during  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance.17 An  estimated  153  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  provided  to \nstrengthen project management and support project implementation. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.18 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures\n1.
