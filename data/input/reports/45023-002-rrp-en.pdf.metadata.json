This  will  contribute  to  inclusive \ngrowth  and  environmentally  sustainable  development  by  improving  the  efficiency  and \nsustainability of urban transport and promoting more efficient freight logistics. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe urban population of the PRC amounted to 690.79 million in 2011, or 51.3% of the \n3. \ntotal  population.  Since  1978,  the  PRC\u2019s  urban  population  had  increased  by  more  than \n500 million  (and  another  300  million  people  are  expected  to  move  to  cities  by  2020).  Such  a \nhuge  rural\u2013urban  migration  was  unprecedented.  Millions  of  rural  peasants  became  urban \nresidents,  which  enabled  a  major  shift  in  the  economy  from  agriculture  to  manufacturing  and \nservice employment, contributing to rapid economic growth and rising per capita incomes. As a \nresult of this massive migration, there is a need to expand second-tier cities to relieve pressure \non first-tier urban centers and provide efficient access to economic activities. Large investments \nare needed in urban infrastructure and service provision. A critical task is to develop sustainable \nurban transport systems that will give all urban residents access to centers of employment and \nservices, and do so in a way that is convenient, affordable, efficient, safe, and clean. \n \nThe  central  region  of  the  PRC,  where  Hubei  province  is  located,  has  become  a  major \n4. \ncenter  for  energy  production,  agricultural  processing,  and  high-technology  manufacturing. 2 \nLarge  hydropower  facilities  at  Three  Gorges  Dam  and  Gezhou  Dam  provide  low-cost  energy. \nThe  region  has  also  developed  as  a  transportation  and  logistics  hub.  Yichang  benefits  from \nrecent  investments  in  railway  infrastructure,  including  a  new  high-speed  rail  service,  and  road \nnetwork expansion. New and expanded terminal facilities for waterborne traffic on the Yangtze \nRiver  further  enhance  regional  connectivity  and  development.  However,  due  to  limitations  in \nship-lock  capacity  at  Three  Gorges  Dam  and  Gezhou  Dam,  additional  road  investments  are \nneeded to support road-based transfer of goods between the upstream and downstream sides \nof the dam (pass-dam transshipment).3 \n \n5. \nYichang is a prefecture-level city, the second-largest city in Hubei province after Wuhan, \nthe provincial capital. Yichang has a total population of 4.1 million, of which 1.4 million is urban. \nThe urbanization rate of about 32% at the end of 2011 was well below the national average of \n51.3%.  Yichang\u2019s  urban  population  is  forecast  to  increase  to  2.8  million  by  2030  due  to \ncontinuing  migration.  Major  investments  are  needed  in  urban  infrastructure,  transport,  and \nrelated services to accommodate the growing population and support sustainable urbanization \nand inclusive growth. \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   In  2011,  the  secondary  industry  contributed  60.6%  to  Yichang's  gross  domestic  product,  the  tertiary  industry \n\ncontributed 28.2%, and the primary industry contributed 11.2%.  \n\n3   Pass-dam transshipment is the shipping of goods or containers by road or rail to an inland waterway port upstream \n\nor downstream of a dam to bypass the ship lock or ship-lifting facilities at the dam. \n\n\f2 \n\nUrban transport. Yichang has a linear urban form running east\u2013west along the Yangtze \n6. \nRiver valley. Most of the city is located on the north bank of the river, with three primary urban \narterial roads running in parallel to each other. Interregional traffic movements flow through the \nurban  area.  About  75%  of  all  person-trips  are  made  with  private  means  of  transport  and  are \nmainly concentrated in the central business district. While there is a bus priority system in the \nform of curb-side bus lanes, this has been less effective due to encroachment by illegal parking \nand hawker activities, among others. There is also lack of enforcement of traffic regulations. In \nview of the rapid growth of car ownership4 and limited land available for expansion of the urban \narea,  the  city  will  experience  congestion,  increasing  road  accidents,  and  vehicle  emissions-\nrelated air quality problems unless a more sustainable approach to transport is established. \n \n7. \nInternational  best  practice  indicates  that  one  of  the  key  elements  in  a  sustainable \ntransport system is to improve public transport and make it an attractive option for travelers. In \nthe PRC, bus-based public transport and NMT have received less attention than road building. \nThe  mode  shares  of  public  transport  and  NMT  are  well  below  potential  levels,  and  there  is \ngrowing  dependency  on  private  vehicles.  The  present  public  transport  system  of  Yichang  will \nnot be able to cope with future travel demand, and the city\u2019s NMT facilities are unable to provide \na  safe  environment  for  pedestrians  and  bicycle  users.  An  affordable,  efficient  public  transport \nsystem  coupled  with  safe,  attractive  NMT  should  be  introduced.  In  most  medium-sized  cities \nand many large cities, BRT represents the best, most cost-effective, and most flexible option for \npublic  transport. 5  Yichang\u2019s  linear  form  is  very  well  suited  for  BRT,  which  can  begin  by \nestablishing a core BRT corridor connecting the new railway station and provincial bus terminal, \nand  then  be  extended  in  phases.  As  part  of  ongoing  efforts  to  improve  urban  planning  in \nYichang,  there  is  an  opportunity  to  introduce  safe,  seamless  NMT  routes  for  cyclists  and \npedestrians.  Investments  in  BRT  and  NMT  could  well  boost  the  share  of  public  transport  and \nreverse the decline of NMT. There is potential for Yichang to become a model for BRT and NMT \ndevelopment in medium-sized cities in the PRC. \n \nPass-dam  transshipment  freight.  Three  Gorges  Dam  is  a  major  part  of  the  Yichang \n8. \neconomy, and growth in associated freight transport has become a challenge for the transport \nsystem  in  Yichang.  The  bi-directional  freight  volume  of  the  Three  Gorges  ship  lock  reached \n90 million tons in 2010 and is projected to reach 185 million tons in 2020 and 248 million tons in \n2030.  Due  to  limitations  in  ship-lock  capacity,  the  portion  of  traffic  requiring  pass-dam \ntransshipment  could  increase  from  12.4  million  tons  in  2010  to  85  million  tons  in  2020,  and \n148 million tons in 2030. A bypass road is therefore needed to handle this traffic growth without \ncausing congestion and traffic safety problems in the city center area. In addition, it is necessary \nto reinforce the logistics hub function of Yichang by improving access to the logistics parks and \ndeveloping  manufacturing  facilities.  More  efficient  access  to  logistics  facilities  and  increased \npass-dam transshipment capacity will contribute to stronger use of inland waterways, which is \nthe most economical and environmentally friendly mode of freight transport. \n \n9. \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \npartnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC.  It  will  (i)  support  inclusive  growth  and  balanced \ndevelopment by promoting sustainable urbanization and (ii) contribute to resource efficiency and \nenvironmental sustainability by promoting efficient and sustainable urban transport.6 The focus \n\n                                                 \n4   From  2007  to  2008,  the  vehicle  fleet  increased  by  14.7%,  compared  with  a  gross  domestic  product  per  capita \n\nincrease of 14.6%. \n\n5   The first line, Guangzhou BRT, was put into operation on 10 February 2010. It handles nearly 1 million passenger \ntrips  daily  with  a  peak  passenger  flow  of  29,900  passengers  per  hour  per  direction  (second  only  to  the \nTransMilenio BRT system in Bogota, Colombia). \n\n6  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\non  public  transport  and  multimodal  integration  directly  supports  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport \nInitiative.  The  project  aligns  with  the  development  plan  of  the  Three  Gorges  Modern  Logistics \nCenter,7 a  key  priority  of  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  under  the  12th \nfive-year plan. \n \n10. \nThis  is  ADB's  third  project  to  support  BRT  in  the  PRC,  after  the  Lanzhou  Sustainable \nUrban  Transport  Project 8  and  Jiangxi  Fuzhou  Urban  Integrated  Infrastructure  Improvement \nProject.9 It incorporates lessons learned in developing and implementing those projects. A key \nlesson  is  that  when  developing  BRT  and  NMT,  careful  attention  to  design  is  essential  to \noptimize system configuration and capacity to best serve user needs. An integrated approach is \nneeded  for  BRT  design  and  NMT  development,  including  careful  coordination  between  BRT \ndesign, traffic management, and urban planning. Due to the specialized nature of BRT system \nplanning, design, and operations, it is useful to include a program of institutional strengthening \nand  capacity  building  for  the  municipal  bus  company,  project  management  office  (PMO),  and \nthe traffic police. \n \nThe BRT corridor in Yichang will serve all the major districts and major public transport \n11. \nfacilities, including the new high-speed railway station and provincial bus terminals. The project \nrepresents a new concept for small and medium-sized cities that links urban development to the \nexpansion of public transport. This project will be a model for sustainable transport development \nthat can be replicated in the PRC and across Asia. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the project will be an efficient, inclusive, and sustainable transport system \n\n12. \nin Yichang. The outcome will be the provision of efficient passenger and freight transport. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nOutput  1:  Bus  rapid  transit  system.  A  23.9  kilometer  (km)  BRT  system  will  be \nimplemented in the median of the main arterial road in Yichang. Services will operate from the \nprovincial  bus  terminal  in  Yiling  district,  extend  along  the  Yixing  Avenue\u2013Yemingzhu  Road\u2013\nDongshan  Avenue\u2013Jucheng  Road,  and  end  at  Yichang  East  railway  station.  The  route  will \nconnect  the  main  residential  and  business  districts  with  the  city\u2019s  new  logistics  and  industrial \npark  and  the  high-speed  railway  station.  The  BRT  will  include  dedicated,  center-running  bus \nlanes,  fully enclosed  BRT  stations,  a  bus  management  system  and  bus  information  system,  a \nfare collection system, and parking management along the BRT corridor. \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Nonmotorized transport measures. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities (bicycle \nlane and bicycle parking) will be implemented along the BRT corridor and at key intersections. \nThis will help improve accessibility and safety for bus passengers and other NMT users. \n\n                                                 \n7  In  May  2010,  the  Comprehensive  Transportation  Study  Office  of  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission  completed  the  Development  Plan  for  the  Three  Gorges  Modern  Logistics  Center. The  plan  includes \nnine  comprehensive  logistics  park  areas  and  an  urban  distribution  center  in  Yichang  (including  Huayan \nComprehensive Logistics Park Area, Taipingxi Logistics Park Area, Maoping Logistics Park Area, Yunchi Logistics \nPark  Area,  Honghuatao  Logistics  Park  Area,  and  Three  Gorges  Airport  Logistics  Park  Area).  The  logistics  parks \nare  selected  to  support  the  development  of  Three  Gorges  Logistics  Center  and  expand  logistics  operational \ncapacity by creating an efficient multimodal logistics network through ports, railway, roads, and the airport. \n\n8   The  project  includes  12.4  kilometers  (km)  of  BRT  corridor  development.  The  initial  phase  of  BRT  operations \n\ncommenced in December 2012. \n\n9   The  Jiangxi-Fuzhou  Urban  Integrated  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  includes  12.2  km  of  BRT  development \n\nand an urban transport hub at new high-speed railway station. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nOutput  3:  Road  network  improvement.  This  will  build  a  23.4  km  extension  of \n15. \nDongshan  4th  Road  to  accommodate  through-traffic  and  freight  traffic,  including  pass-dam \ntransshipment.  The  road  comprises  (i)  improvement  of  12.3  km  of  Fazhan  Avenue\u2013Bailinhe \nRoad  Section  (phase  1)  to  a  road  width  of  44\u201370  meters  (m);  and  (ii)  improvement  of  the \n11.1 km  Bailinhe  Road  to  Xianfeng  Road  (phase  2)  to  class  1  highway,  with  a  road  width  of \n24.5 m. The output includes 11 bridges and two tunnels. \n \n16. \nOutput  4:  Capacity  building  and  quality  assurance.  This  will  (i) support  project \nmanagement and implementation to ensure that project outputs are delivered on time and within \nbudget  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  develop  and  maintain  the  project \nperformance  monitoring  system,  and  assist  with  procurement  and  disbursement;  (ii)  support \ndetailed  design  review  and  safeguard  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  and  (iii) build \ncapacity in traffic management, road safety, and BRT operation and management. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nShare of \nTotal \n(%) \n\n50.6 \n33.4 \n0.4 \n84.3\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe estimated cost of the project is $515.1 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost \n\n17. \n \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

The  capacity  of  the \nYMG  is  considered  adequate  to  implement  the  project\u2019s  advanced  technical  and  sustainable \ntransport aspects, based on its performance in past and ongoing urban transport development \nprojects.13 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe economic analysis compared the \u201cwith-project\u201d case of introducing BRT service and \n22. \nroad  improvement  against  the  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  case  of  existing  public  transport  services  and \nroad  facilities.  The  estimated  costs  include  investment  in  civil  works  and  equipment,  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  and  operation  and  maintenance.  BRT  will  enable  faster  bus \noperating  speeds  and  shorten  passenger  transport  times.  The  project  road  improvement  will \nincrease  road  capacity,  leading  to  faster  vehicle  speeds,  shortened  transport  time,  and  fewer \nroad accidents. The estimated benefits include savings in vehicle operating cost and travel time, \ntraffic  and  pedestrian  safety  benefits,  and  a  reduction  in  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions.  The \nproject is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 17.8% and \nnet  present  value  of  CNY1,334.63  million  at  a  12.0%  discount  rate.  Sensitivity  analysis  of \npotential  cost  overruns  and  benefit  reductions  demonstrates  that  project  economic  viability  is \nrobust.  Other  benefits  that  could  not  be  quantified  include  health  benefits  thanks  to  better  air \nquality, and better quality of life thanks to more convenient transportation. \n \n23. \nThe  project  has  both  revenue-earning  and  nonrevenue  outputs.  The  road  network \nimprovements  are  not  revenue-earning.  The  BRT  output  will  generate  revenue  through  the \ncollection of bus fares from passengers. The ticket revenue of the BRT will exceed the operating \nand maintenance cost of the BRT component. The estimated financial internal rate of return for \nthe BRT component is 4.8% before corporate income tax and 2.7% after tax.14 As the financial \ninternal rate of return after tax is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.56%, the \nBRT component is financially viable. The executing agency will periodically review and update \nfares to ensure that these are sufficient to meet the cost of service provision and are affordable \nfor poor and vulnerable groups. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  relevant  sections  of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement \ndocuments and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  the  PMO.  Specific  policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  12).  An \nassessment  of  financial  management  capacity  indicates  that  the  implementing  and  executing \nagencies  carefully \nfinancial \nmanagement.  The  implementing  agency  has  strong  accounting  and  financial  management \n\nfollow  PRC  policies  and  procedures \n\nfor  accounting  and \n\n                                                 \n13 Project Technical Description (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 The business tax for transport entities is 3.36% of sales, and the corporate income tax for all businesses is 25.00% \n\nof profit. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\ncapacity,  as  well  as  experience  in  managing  multiple  large  construction  projects  such  as \nYichang Logistics Center and  Xioting Wastewater Treatment Plant. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nConducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines,  a  poverty  and  social  impact  analysis \naimed  at  assessing  transport  and  economic  development  needs  of  the  people  in  the  project-\naffected  area.  Urban  traffic  decongestion,  safe  and  convenient  public  transport  facilities,  and \nroad  connectivity  for  neighboring  rural  areas  are  main  transport  requirements  of  the  local \npeople. The causes of poverty include lack of economic and employment opportunities, illness, \nand disability. The project will benefit 1.3 million people, both urban and rural. Within the project \narea, there are 32,673 urban poor and 39,100 rural poor. The project will endeavor to meet the \ntransport and economic development needs of people by mitigating traffic congestion, improving \ntraffic  efficiency  and  safety,  reducing  travel  time,  improving  public  transit  facilities,  and \nenhancing access to nonfarm employment and markets. People from low-income groups will get \npriority for job opportunities created during construction and operation of the project. \n \n26. \nThe project will facilitate the development of a sustainable transport system to meet the \ntransport  needs  of  Yichang  city  as  it  continues  to  expand  rapidly.  A  large  number  of  urban \nresidents, including women and poor, are dependent on public transport. The proposed project \nwill provide them with a convenient and efficient mode of transportation to meet their everyday \nrequirements. The inclusive aspect of the project is strengthened by the NMT output, which will \nprovide pedestrians and cyclists with a dedicated, safe right-of-way within the city\u2019s main traffic \ncorridor.  The  extended  Dongshan  4th  Road  will  also  serve  the  transport  and  economic \ndevelopment needs of rural neighborhoods of the city. \n \n27. \nGender.  The  project  is  designed  with  distinct  gender-sensitive  features  to  boost \nwomen\u2019s  inclusion  and  participation.  All  four  project  outputs  include  features  that  go  toward \nmeeting  gender-specific  transport and  economic  development  needs  of  the  project  beneficiary \npopulation. The poverty and social assessment (PSA) indicated that 51% of women use public \ntransport as the main mode of transportation, and 31% rely on walking. Women have particular \ntransport needs arising from their various social roles and patterns of mobility. They also have \npersonal  safety  concerns  when  using  public  transport.  These  gender-related  concerns  have \nbeen  dealt  with  in  the  project  design  to  ensure  that  women  benefit  from  an  urban  transport \nsystem that is safe and convenient. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to (i) ensure \nwomen\u2019s  equitable  participation  in  public  consultation,  (ii) implement  the  gender-responsive \nfeatures  of  the  project,  (iii)  promote  employment  opportunities  for  women,  and  (iv)  build \ninstitutional  capacity  for  gender  mainstreaming. 15 Implementation  of  the  GAP  will  be  financed \nfrom the project budget and will be monitored through collection of sex-disaggregated data. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  A.  An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  report  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  that  comply  with \nADB  Safeguard  Policy  (2009)  and  PRC  regulatory  requirements  have  been  prepared  for  the \nproject and were disclosed on the ADB website on 14 December 2012. The EIA concludes that \nanticipated  environmental  impacts  and  risks  are  modest  and  can  be  limited  to  an  acceptable \nlevel  through  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  Capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening are proposed to minimize environmental risks. The \n\n                                                 \n15 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nfor \n\nthe  EMP \n\nimplementation  of \n\nis  $2,978,250.  This \n\nEMP assesses potential impacts of the project components, sets out mitigation and monitoring \nmeasures, institutional arrangements, training requirements, and budgets for implementation of \nthe  EMP.  The  budget \nincludes \n$2,881,500 for  mitigation  measures,  $80,000  for  environmental  monitoring,  $9,600  for  training \nand capacity development, and $7,150 for public consultation. \n \n29. \nThe  BRT  corridor  will  be  constructed  in  an  urban  center  that  already  experiences  high \nnoise, and pollutants and CO2 emissions from traffic. Modelling indicates that the introduction of \nBRT  will  reduce  daytime  noise  and  CO2  emission  levels  as  a  result  of  smoother  traffic  flow. \nDongshan 4th Road is in a semi-urban setting and construction will result in permanent loss of \n101.52 hectares of plantation, patchy woodland, and artificial ponds of limited biodiversity value. \nDongshan 4th Road will divert heavy traffic from the city and contribute to a reduction in noise, \npollutants, and CO2 emissions in the urban center. During construction, activities that generate \ndust  and  noise  have  the  potential  to  disturb  residents  and  businesses  along  both  the  BRT \ncorridor and Dongshan 4th Road, and these will be subject to controls as specified in the EMP. \nTunneling  and  bridge  works  present  environmental,  occupational,  and community  safety  risks, \nand will be subject to specific controls. The project will provide double-glazing for all households \nalong the BRT corridor and Dongshan 4th Road that are predicted to experience noise levels in \nexcess  of  the  PRC  noise  standards  for  the  assessed  operational  years  (2018  to  2030).  Two \nhouseholds  will  be  resettled  as  a  result  of  operational  noise  impacts  of  Dongshan  4th  Road. \nPublic  consultation  was  carried  out  to  discuss  the  project  design  and  EIA  process  and  will \ncontinue  throughout  project  implementation.  Environmental  complaints  or  disputes  will  be \nhandled through a grievance redress mechanism established for the project. \n \nResettlement. The project is category A for involuntary resettlement.16 The resettlement \n30. \nimpacts of the project include land acquisition in rural areas and demolition of rural and urban \nhouses and urban commercial structures (shops). Nine villages and one urban neighborhood in \nYichang city will be affected. The total permanent land acquisition is 1,797.5 mu. Demolition will \ninvolve  56,106.60  square  meters  (m2)  of  residential  structures.  Together,  land  acquisition  and \ndemolition will affect 1,453 persons in 370 households. The project will also involve demolition \nof 325 m2 of shops along the BRT corridor that will affect 25 persons in nine shops. The project \nwill temporarily occupy 528.59 mu of land. \n \n31. \nA draft resettlement plan has been prepared in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and adequately assesses the involuntary resettlement impacts of the project. \nThe draft resettlement plan has been disclosed to the affected persons and on the ADB website. \nThe plan will be finalized in line with the detailed engineering design and detailed measurement \nsurvey,  disclosed  to  the  affected  people,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  awarding \ncivil  works  contracts.  The  total  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  CNY463.4  million \n(14.5% of total project cost). The YMG has assured ADB that adequate counterpart funding will \nbe made available. A resettlement implementation schedule has been prepared. The YMG has \nrelevant  experience;  nonetheless,  some  capacity  development  support \nfor  safeguards \nimplementation is included in the project. A resettlement specialist will be engaged to assist in \nimplementing  the  resettlement  plan.  The  PMO's  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  unit  will \ncoordinate internal supervision and reporting of plan implementation. The YMG will engage an \nexternal  institute  for  semiannual  monitoring  and  reporting.  An  acceptable  grievance  resolution \nmechanism  will  be  established  before  starting  the  civil  works,  to  deal  with  project-related \ngrievances.  Public  consultations  were  undertaken  during  project  preparation  and  will  continue \nthroughout the project cycle in accordance with the public consultation schedule. \n\n                                                 \n16 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nIndigenous  peoples.  There  are  no  ethnic  minority  communities  that  will  be  adversely \n\n32. \naffected by the project, which is category C for indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33. \nThe  project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risk.  The  YMG  and  YMUCID  have \nsuccessfully  carried  out  many  large  infrastructure  projects  and  have  substantial  experience  in \nproject  implementation  and  management  but  no  experience  with  ADB-financed  projects.  To \ncounteract the lack of experience with ADB procedures, training on ADB safeguards and project \nprocurement  and  monitoring  procedures  was  provided  during  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance. 17  An  estimated  153  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  provided  to \nstrengthen project management and support project implementation. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.18 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n1.
