I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior loan of up to $75,000,000 to ACLEDA Bank Plc for Promoting Financial Inclusion in \nCambodia.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are very important to Cambodia\u2019s \neconomy. They account for 99% of the country\u2019s firms and for 73% of all employment.2 Limited \naccess to finance is one of the most critical challenges MSMEs face. According to the National \nBank of Cambodia (NBC), the country\u2019s central bank, 84% of MSMEs are financed by the \ninformal banking system, where interest rates can be as high as 10% per month. A 2010 \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) survey found that 57% of respondent enterprises did not \nhave  a  bank  account.  Of  these,  72%  were  microenterprises  and  63%  small  enterprises.3 \nDemand from MSMEs for financial services and for credit particularly is therefore extremely high. \n \n3.  Cambodia\u2019s level of financial services outreach is one of the lowest in Asia and the \nPacific. The IFC study estimated that fewer than 8% of the country\u2019s people make use of formal \nfinancial services (footnote 3). Growth of the financial sector has been constrained by the \nabsence  of  an  interbank  market  and  by  underdeveloped  capital  markets,  among  other \nchallenges. To improve financial inclusion in Cambodia and strengthen its financial sector, the \nPrivate Sector Operations Department of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) met with several \nbanks  in  Cambodia  to  identify  suitable  candidates  for  long-term  financing  to  support  the \ncountry\u2019s MSMEs.  \n   \n4.  ACLEDA Bank Plc, which is the only bank in Cambodia participating in ADB\u2019s Trade \nFinance Program, has been discussing possible support for its broader lending program with \nADB since early 2012. ACLEDA Bank Plc\u2019s history began in 1992 when a small group of \nCambodians  returned  from  a  Thai  refugee  camp  to  work  on  a  joint  International  Labour \nOrganization and United Nations Development Programme business development, training, and \ncredit project for demobilized soldiers and, later, also for widows, returned refugees, and others \ndisplaced by decades of  war.4  The International Labour Organization and United Nations \nDevelopment Programme turned to this core group of people to manage a revolving credit fund, \nestablishing the Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies (ACLEDA) \nas a nongovernment organization (NGO). By helping rebuild the country and providing low-\nincome  people  access  to  finance,  ACLEDA  grew  into  the  most  successful  microfinance \ninstitution in Cambodia and a model for similar NGOs throughout Asia. It became a specialized \nbank in 2000 and, in 2003, when it was renamed ACLEDA Bank Plc, it obtained a commercial \nbanking license and was authorized to provide a full range of banking services.  \n \n5.  Although now the country\u2019s largest bank, it still serves the microfinance segment as a \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  National Institute of Statistics, Ministry of Planning. 2013.

The  Bank  that  Likes  to  Say  Less.  22  September. \nhttp://www.economist.com/node/21563302 \n ", "2   \nuniversal bank. ACLEDA Bank Plc has most extensive outreach of any of the country\u2019s banks to \nthe rural areas where about 90% of the country\u2019s poor live. Its network of 238 branches covers \nall Cambodia\u2019s provinces and towns, and it plans to expand it to other underserved areas.5 \nAbout 46% of the bank\u2019s borrowers are in the agriculture sector, and 54% of its borrowing \nclients are women.6 The bank has excellent asset quality, focuses strongly on the needs of its \nclients, and aims to promote more equitable and inclusive growth across the country. Since its \ninception as an NGO, its strong corporate culture has been based on employee ownership, \nteam work, and high ethical standards. ACLEDA Bank Plc has a zero tolerance policy on \ncorruption  and  prides  and  markets  itself  on  its  transparency.  It  believes  this  transparency \ncontributes to its growth. Its high corporate governance standards reflect these principles.  \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for 2011\u20132013 makes finance an area of \nemphasis  for  private  sector  operations  in  Cambodia.7 The  CPS  states  that  private  sector \ncompanies  must  meet  ADB\u2019s  stringent  criteria  for  nonsovereign  investments  to  receive  its \nfinancial assistance. These criteria include long-term financial viability, significant and positive \ndevelopment impact, sufficient project scale, good corporate governance, and compliance with \nADB\u2019s safeguard policies. Based on these criteria, ACLEDA Bank Plc is the best candidate in \nthe country\u2019s financial sector for ADB assistance. The loan will also allow ADB to deepen its \nrelationship with a bank that has a presence in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and \nMyanmar and thereby strengthen the potential for ADB to help promote financial inclusion in \nthese other challenging markets as well.8 \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  ACLEDA Bank Plc accounts for 23% of the banking sector\u2019s loans and 21% of its \ndeposits. It has leveraged its strong franchise and extensive branch network to build customer \nconfidence and gain market share in recent years. In 2006, the bank ranked fifth in terms of \ndeposits, with 9% market share. Its vision is to be Cambodia\u2019s leading commercial bank and to \nprovide superior financial services to all segments of the community. Its stated mission is to \nprovide micro, small, and medium-sized entrepreneurs with the wherewithal to manage their \nfinancial  resources  efficiently  and,  by  doing  so,  to  improve  the  quality  of  their  lives.  It  is \nmarketed as \u201cthe bank for the people.\u201d It has built a high level of trust with the public since its \ninception, and this has been a major part of its market strength. \n \n8.  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  plays  a  systemically  important  economic  role  as  the  country\u2019s \nprincipal financial intermediary, mobilizing its customers\u2019 deposits and relending the funds to \nenterprises and individuals in need of capital to establish and expand their businesses. It is also \nkey to such important financial system functions as settlement and cash management, money \ntransfers, payroll services, and trade finance. The bank helps create employment and income \nopportunities by providing lending for local private sector development that other commercial \nbanks have been reluctant to offer. Its staff of 9,250\u201438% of whom are women\u2014is more than \nfive times the size of the second largest commercial bank\u2019s.  \n \n9.  ACLEDA Bank Plc strategy is to grow across all loan segments by developing existing \n                                                \n5  ACLEDA Bank Plc\u2019s network of 238 branches accounts for more than 50% of all bank branches in Cambodia. \nNational Bank of Cambodia. 2013.

It is exploring electronic banking \ninitiatives and has developed an integrated mobile phone banking platform. The latter has \nallowed it to make greater inroads and strengthen its existing competitive advantage in the \nunderserved  rural  areas  of  Cambodia  where  infrastructure  is  often  lacking.9 The  bank  is \nupgrading information systems in key areas to serve its customers more efficiently and support \nfuture growth. This has included the introduction of an Oracle database to improve processing \ncapacity.  \n \n10.  The ACLEDA Training Center, a self-sustaining subsidiary of ACLEDA Bank Plc, builds \nthe  capacity  of  the  bank\u2019s  staff  to  make  its  operations  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, and Myanmar successful. It also offers six fee-based training programs to \nthe public and to participants from other local and foreign organizations. The center has trained \nmore than 2,950 participants from organizations in Cambodia and 26 other countries.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n11.  Ownership.  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc\u2019s  current  shareholders  are  the  ACLEDA  Staff \nAssociation (26.0%), ACLEDA NGO (25.0%), Compagnie Financi\u00e8re de la BRED (12.25%), the \nIFC (12.25%), JSH Asian Holdings (12.25%), and Triodos Group (12.25%). \n \n12.  Management. The president and group chief executive officer of ACLEDA Bank Plc is In \nChanny,  who  commenced  working  with  ACLEDA  NGO  in  1993.  He is  a  highly  respected \nmember of the Cambodian financial services industry and business community. ACLEDA Bank \nPlc's organizational structure is appropriately decentralized, with the CEO supported by an \nexecutive management team of six members who have all been with the organization since \n1993. The team is responsible for overall strategic planning, running the day-to-day business, \nand  implementation  and  execution  of  the  business  plan.  The  bank  strives  to  develop  a \ndisciplined,  controlled  environment  in  which  all  employees  understand  their  roles  and \nresponsibilities. It has developed a culture under which all employees acknowledge that they \nare accountable for managing risk in the functions and business areas at their levels.  \n \n13.  Governance  structure.  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  recognizes  the  importance  of  sound \ncorporate governance to sustainable growth and securing the trust of stakeholders, including \ncustomers, staff, and shareholders. The bank\u2019s board supports the implementation of the bank\u2019s \ncorporate governance policy and its code of conduct and business ethics.10  \n \n14.  The board of directors has eight members and includes representatives from all the \nmajor shareholders. The chairperson is Chea Sok, a Cambodian national with more than 20 \nyears of financial services experience. The board is responsible for determining the bank\u2019s \nstrategy  and  for  conducting  or  supervising  the  conduct  of  its  business.  This  includes \nresponsibility  for  corporate  governance.  The  board  is  required  to  establish  committees  to \noversee audit and compliance, credit and risk, assets and liabilities, and remuneration. All \ncommittee members must be approved by the board.  \n \n15.  The compliance department manages reporting of any suspicious transactions. ACLEDA \nBank Plc identifies suspicious transactions through scanning information by highlighted items \nthat include transaction type, transaction frequency, amount, geographical origin and destination \n                                                \n9  ACLEDA Bank received the award presented by The Asian Banker for best mobile banking project in 2012.

It \nreports findings to the Financial Intelligence Unit of the NBC. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n16.  ADB proposes to extend a senior unsecured loan of up to $75 million to ACLEDA Bank \nPlc, with a tenor of up to 5 years. The loan\u2019s size is based on the significant unmet demand for \nMSME financing in Cambodia and on the bank\u2019s historical and expected loan growth.11 ACLEDA \nBank Plc projects a lending program of $300 million for 2014 and, as the only bank operating in \nmuch of the country, is uniquely positioned to deliver the unmet demand for financial services, \nparticularly in rural areas. The bank\u2019s successful new mobile banking platform addresses the \nneeds of underserved areas and is expected to generate even greater levels of demand for the \nbank\u2019s services in future years.  \n \n17.  The ADB loan, equivalent to about 25% of the bank\u2019s 2014 funding and business plan, \nwill make a meaningful contribution to its growth and support of MSMEs. The proceeds of the \nloan will be used exclusively to support MSMEs.12 The assistance will enhance MSME access to \nlonger-term finance, which is in turn critical to support poverty alleviation through income and \nemployment generation in the rural areas where about 90% of Cambodia\u2019s poor live. A portion \nof the risk on ADB\u2019s loan may be transferred to counterparties that are eligible under ADB\u2019s \npolicies.13 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ACLEDA Bank Plc will be required to provide annual audited financial statements. The \nbank will also provide quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates for agreed \ncovenants.  Reporting  requirements  will  include  updates  on  governance,  safeguards,  social \nprotection compliance, and on ACLEDA Bank Plc\u2019s business performance and use of the ADB \nloan. ADB will field review missions at least annually to review and discuss progress with the \nbank\u2019s management. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s support for ACLEDA Bank Plc will add value in several ways:  \n \n(i)  ADB will provide stable, long-term financing that currently cannot be raised from \nthe local market and is needed to help the bank address the maturity mismatch \non its balance sheet. Cambodia\u2019s capital markets are nascent. Public confidence \nin  the  financial  sector  is  relatively  weak.  No  interbank  market  exists  for \ncommercial bank funding, and the bank has no access to debt capital markets. \nADB engagement is also greatly needed because IFIs that provide funding to the \ncountry\u2019s  financial  sector  have  already  reached  country,  sector,  and  single \ninvestment and borrower exposure limits.  \n                                                \n11 ACLEDA\u2019s loan portfolio grew by $270 million in each of 2011 and 2012. \n12 The government and this report classify these enterprises by total assets and number of employees as (i) micro, if \nthey have total assets of less than $50,000 and fewer than 10 employees; (ii) small, if they have total assets of \n$50,000\u2013$250,000 and 11\u201350 employees; (iii) medium, if they have total assets of $250,000\u2013$500,000 and 51\u2013\n100 employees; and (iv) large, if they have total assets of more than $500,000 and greater than 100 employees.  \n13 The terms of the risk transfer arrangements, if any, will be approved by the ADB Investment Committee. ", "        5 \n(ii)  The ADB loan will help ACLEDA Bank Plc diversify its lending base and fulfill \nplans to open an additional 50 branches by the end of 2017. This will broaden \nthe availability of banking services and critically needed financing for MSMEs in \nparts of the country that are now underserved.  \n(iii)  The  loan  will  be  an  important  step  in  supporting  private  sector  growth  in \nCambodia. ADB has been the lead development partner in Cambodia\u2019s financial \nsector since 2001, and, as its first long-term, nonsovereign financing intervention \nwith a Cambodian bank, the loan will complement ADB\u2019s ongoing work in the \nsector.  \n(iv)  Apart from increasing the number of women borrowers overall, the ADB loan will \npromote  greater  financial  inclusion  for  women  entrepreneurs  through  the \nimplementation of the measures in the gender action plan. \n \nD.  Risks \n \n20.  Challenging  operational  environment.  Cambodia  has  a  small,  narrow,  and \nunderdeveloped economy, and its dependence on agriculture, garment exports and tourism \nmakes economic growth volatile. Although no run on deposits occurred during the 2008\u20132009 \nglobal financial crisis, consumer confidence in the banking system has historically been low. To \nmitigate these risks, ACLEDA Bank Plc prudently manages its capital and liquidity positions, \nand maintains a diversified loan portfolio.  \n \n21.  Rapid growth of credit. Continued rapid credit growth could jeopardize macroeconomic \nand financial stability in Cambodia. Although it was from a small and narrow base, credit growth \nspiked in 2011 and 2012 and continues to be robust, rising by 15% in the first 6 months of 2013. \nHowever, the country still has one of the lowest rates of financial intermediation in Asia when \nmeasured by banking sector credit to gross domestic product (GDP). The NBC has stated that it \nwill  adopt  a  stronger,  risk-based,  forward-looking  approach  to  bank  supervision.  It  also \nincreased the reserve rate requirement by 50 basis points in 2012 to 12.5%. The NBC continues \nto monitor credit growth to maintain sound asset quality across the sector.  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n22.  Impacts. The impacts will be (i) growth of Cambodia\u2019s financial sector; (ii) increased \nfinancial inclusion in Cambodia; and (iii) improved access to commercial bank credit by MSMEs. \nThis will be indicated by an increase in bank deposits and loans, as well as an increase in the \nratio of banking sector credit to GDP and higher levels of credit in rural areas.  \n \n23.  The loan will contribute to improving financial inclusion by providing additional financing \nfor MSMEs, primarily in rural areas. MSMEs dominate the economy, in terms of the number of \nfirms (99%) and employment (73%) (footnote 2). They play an important role in (i) job creation; \n(ii) generating  income  for  low-income  people  and  vulnerable  populations;  and  (iii) fostering \neconomic  growth,  social  stability,  and  contributing  to  growth  of  a  dynamic  private  sector. \nMSMEs  are  poorly  served  by  the  banking  system,  and  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  is  the  only \ncommercial  bank  to  have  developed  a  national  branch  network  and  specialized  lending \npractices to reach these underserved customers. \n \n24.  Outcome. The outcome will be the growth and sustainability of ACLEDA Bank Plc\u2019s \nservices to MSMEs. ACLEDA Bank Plc is expected to set an example for other banks by \ncontinuing  to  expand  its  outreach  to  rural  areas  by  adding  to  its  branch  network,  while ", "6   \nmaintaining good asset quality and funding private economic activity in underserved areas. A \nlarge number of new MSME customers are expected to be women. \n \n25.  Output. The output will be ACLEDA\u2019s Bank Plc\u2019s expanded financial capacity to service \nMSMEs, primarily in rural areas, while ensuring that adequate investment is made in human \nresources, processes, and branch infrastructure as it expands its network in remote locations. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n26.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and country strategy. Strategy 2020\u2019s mission of \npoverty  reduction,  its  inclusive  economic  growth  agenda,  its  emphasis  on  private  sector \ndevelopment as a driver of change, and its focus on the need to expand the outreach of \nfinancial  systems  will  be  supported  through  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc\u2019s  emphasis  on  funding \nunderserved segments of the population, where productivity is low and potential for increases in \nemployment and income generation are high.14 The CPS cites limited access to finance as a key \nconstraint to private sector development in Cambodia, makes the financial sector one of five \npriority sectors, and identifies MSME finance as a priority subsector. A new CPS now being \nprepared will continue to make support for the financial sector and for expanding MSME access \nto finance a priority for ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations.  \n \n27.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  loan  will \ncomplement  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  initiatives  in  the financial  sector,  as  well  as  the government\u2019s \n10-year  rolling  financial  sector  development  strategy  for  2011\u20132020. 15  The  government \nstrategy\u2019s  main goal  is  to  develop  a  sound financial  sector that  can  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction by supporting economic growth and giving lower-income people greater access to \nfinance. ADB has been supporting government reform efforts since approving its first financial \nsector program for the country in 2001. 16 ADB\u2019s contributions have been in such areas as \n(i) modernizing  the  national  payment,  clearance,  and  settlement  system;  (ii)  strengthening \nregulation  and  supervision  of  banks  and  microfinance  institutions;  (iii)  introducing  higher \nstandards of accounting, auditing, and financial reporting; (iv) establishing a registry to record \nassets that banks accept as security for loans; (v) drafting and successfully supporting the \npassage of a securities law; and (vi) launching the credit information bureau. While progress \nhas been achieved, formal finance remains unavailable in a large part of the country, and \naccess to finance to support the growing economy has remained well below potential.  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n28.  The  loan  is  classified  as  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.
