They account for 99% of the country\u2019s firms and for 73% of all employment.2 Limited \naccess to finance is one of the most critical challenges MSMEs face. According to the National \nBank  of  Cambodia  (NBC),  the  country\u2019s  central  bank,  84%  of  MSMEs  are  financed  by  the \ninformal  banking  system,  where  interest  rates  can  be  as  high  as  10%  per  month.  A  2010 \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) survey found that 57% of respondent enterprises did not \nhave  a  bank  account.  Of  these,  72%  were  microenterprises  and  63%  small  enterprises. 3 \nDemand from MSMEs for financial services and for credit particularly is therefore extremely high. \n \n3. \nCambodia\u2019s  level  of  financial  services  outreach  is  one  of  the  lowest  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific. The IFC study estimated that fewer than 8% of the country\u2019s people make use of formal \nfinancial  services  (footnote  3).  Growth  of  the  financial  sector  has  been  constrained  by  the \nabsence  of  an  interbank  market  and  by  underdeveloped  capital  markets,  among  other \nchallenges. To improve financial inclusion in Cambodia and strengthen its financial sector, the \nPrivate Sector Operations Department of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) met with several \nbanks  in  Cambodia  to  identify  suitable  candidates  for  long-term  financing  to  support  the \ncountry\u2019s MSMEs.  \n \n \n4. \nACLEDA  Bank  Plc,  which  is  the  only  bank  in  Cambodia  participating  in  ADB\u2019s  Trade \nFinance  Program,  has  been  discussing  possible  support  for  its  broader  lending  program  with \nADB  since  early  2012.  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc\u2019s  history  began  in  1992  when  a  small  group  of \nCambodians  returned  from  a  Thai  refugee  camp  to  work  on  a  joint  International  Labour \nOrganization and United Nations Development Programme business development, training, and \ncredit project for demobilized soldiers and, later, also for widows, returned refugees, and others \ndisplaced  by  decades  of  war. 4   The  International  Labour  Organization  and  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme turned to this core group of people to manage a revolving credit fund, \nestablishing  the  Association  of  Cambodian  Local  Economic  Development  Agencies (ACLEDA) \nas  a  nongovernment  organization  (NGO).  By  helping  rebuild  the  country  and  providing  low-\nincome  people  access  to  finance,  ACLEDA  grew  into  the  most  successful  microfinance \ninstitution in Cambodia and a model for similar NGOs throughout Asia. It became a specialized \nbank in 2000 and, in 2003, when it was renamed ACLEDA Bank Plc, it obtained a commercial \nbanking license and was authorized to provide a full range of banking services.  \n \n5. \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   National  Institute  of  Statistics,  Ministry  of  Planning.  2013.

ACLEDA Bank Plc has most extensive outreach of any of the country\u2019s banks to \nthe rural areas where about 90% of the country\u2019s poor live. Its network of 238 branches covers \nall  Cambodia\u2019s  provinces  and  towns,  and  it  plans  to  expand  it  to  other  underserved  areas.5 \nAbout  46%  of  the  bank\u2019s  borrowers  are  in  the  agriculture  sector,  and  54%  of  its  borrowing \nclients  are women.6 The bank  has  excellent  asset quality, focuses  strongly  on  the  needs  of  its \nclients, and aims to promote more equitable and inclusive growth across the country. Since its \ninception  as  an  NGO,  its  strong  corporate  culture  has  been  based  on  employee  ownership, \nteam  work,  and  high  ethical  standards.  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  has  a  zero  tolerance  policy  on \ncorruption  and  prides  and  markets  itself  on  its  transparency.  It  believes  this  transparency \ncontributes to its growth. Its high corporate governance standards reflect these principles.  \n \n6. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  2011\u20132013  makes  finance  an  area  of \nemphasis  for  private  sector  operations  in  Cambodia. 7  The  CPS  states  that  private  sector \ncompanies  must  meet  ADB\u2019s  stringent  criteria  for  nonsovereign  investments  to  receive  its \nfinancial  assistance.  These  criteria  include  long-term  financial  viability,  significant  and  positive \ndevelopment impact, sufficient project scale, good corporate governance, and compliance with \nADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies.  Based  on  these  criteria,  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  is the  best  candidate  in \nthe  country\u2019s  financial  sector  for  ADB  assistance.  The  loan  will  also  allow  ADB  to  deepen  its \nrelationship  with  a  bank  that  has  a  presence  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  and \nMyanmar  and  thereby  strengthen  the  potential  for  ADB  to  help  promote  financial  inclusion  in \nthese other challenging markets as well.8 \n \nB. \n \nACLEDA  Bank  Plc  accounts  for  23%  of  the  banking  sector\u2019s  loans  and  21%  of  its \n7. \ndeposits. It has leveraged its strong franchise and extensive branch network to build customer \nconfidence  and  gain  market  share  in  recent  years.  In  2006,  the  bank  ranked  fifth  in  terms  of \ndeposits, with 9% market share. Its vision is to be Cambodia\u2019s leading commercial bank and to \nprovide  superior  financial  services  to  all  segments  of  the  community.  Its  stated  mission  is  to \nprovide  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  entrepreneurs  with  the  wherewithal  to  manage  their \nfinancial  resources  efficiently  and,  by  doing  so,  to  improve  the  quality  of  their  lives.  It  is \nmarketed as \u201cthe bank for the people.\u201d It has built a high level of trust with the public since its \ninception, and this has been a major part of its market strength. \n \n8. \nACLEDA  Bank  Plc  plays  a  systemically  important  economic  role  as  the  country\u2019s \nprincipal  financial  intermediary,  mobilizing  its  customers\u2019  deposits  and  relending  the  funds  to \nenterprises and individuals in need of capital to establish and expand their businesses. It is also \nkey to  such  important financial  system functions  as  settlement  and  cash  management, money \ntransfers,  payroll  services,  and  trade  finance.  The  bank  helps  create  employment  and  income \nopportunities  by  providing  lending  for  local  private  sector  development  that  other  commercial \nbanks have been reluctant to offer. Its staff of 9,250\u201438% of whom are women\u2014is more than \nfive times the size of the second largest commercial bank\u2019s.  \n \n9. \n\nACLEDA  Bank  Plc  strategy  is to grow  across  all  loan segments  by  developing  existing \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n                                                \n5   ACLEDA  Bank  Plc\u2019s  network  of  238  branches  accounts  for  more  than  50%  of  all  bank  branches  in  Cambodia. \n\nNational Bank of Cambodia. 2013.

A feasibility study for ACLEDA Myanmar was completed in 2012, and a \nmicrofinance  license  was  granted  in  December  2012.  ACLEDA  Myanmar  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  and  was \nestablished with $10 million in capital. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nOwnership.  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc\u2019s  current  shareholders  are \n\nand new products to meet customers\u2019 needs, and to gain higher market share by improving and \nexpanding the delivery system for these products and services. It is exploring electronic banking \ninitiatives  and  has  developed  an  integrated  mobile  phone  banking  platform.  The  latter  has \nallowed  it  to  make  greater  inroads  and  strengthen  its  existing  competitive  advantage  in  the \nunderserved  rural  areas  of  Cambodia  where  infrastructure  is  often  lacking. 9  The  bank  is \nupgrading information systems in key areas to serve its customers more efficiently and support \nfuture growth. This has included the introduction of an Oracle database to improve processing \ncapacity.  \n \n10. \nThe ACLEDA Training Center, a self-sustaining subsidiary of ACLEDA Bank Plc, builds \nthe  capacity  of  the  bank\u2019s  staff  to  make  its  operations  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, and Myanmar successful. It also offers six fee-based training programs to \nthe public and to participants from other local and foreign organizations. The center has trained \nmore than 2,950 participants from organizations in Cambodia and 26 other countries.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nthe  ACLEDA  Staff \nAssociation (26.0%), ACLEDA NGO (25.0%), Compagnie Financi\u00e8re de la BRED (12.25%), the \nIFC (12.25%), JSH Asian Holdings (12.25%), and Triodos Group (12.25%). \n \n12.  Management. The president and group chief executive officer of ACLEDA Bank Plc is In \nChanny,  who  commenced  working  with  ACLEDA  NGO  in  1993.  He  is  a  highly  respected \nmember of the Cambodian financial services industry and business community. ACLEDA Bank \nPlc's  organizational  structure  is  appropriately  decentralized,  with  the  CEO  supported  by  an \nexecutive  management  team  of  six  members  who  have  all  been  with  the  organization  since \n1993.  The  team  is  responsible for  overall  strategic  planning,  running  the  day-to-day  business, \nand  implementation  and  execution  of  the  business  plan.  The  bank  strives  to  develop  a \ndisciplined,  controlled  environment  in  which  all  employees  understand  their  roles  and \nresponsibilities.  It  has  developed  a  culture  under  which  all  employees  acknowledge  that  they \nare accountable for managing risk in the functions and business areas at their levels.  \n \nGovernance  structure.  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  recognizes  the  importance  of  sound \n13. \ncorporate  governance  to  sustainable  growth  and  securing  the  trust  of  stakeholders,  including \ncustomers, staff, and shareholders. The bank\u2019s board supports the implementation of the bank\u2019s \ncorporate governance policy and its code of conduct and business ethics.10  \n \nThe  board  of  directors  has  eight  members  and  includes  representatives  from  all  the \n14. \nmajor  shareholders.  The  chairperson  is  Chea  Sok,  a  Cambodian  national  with  more  than  20 \nyears  of  financial  services  experience.  The  board  is  responsible  for  determining  the  bank\u2019s \nstrategy  and  for  conducting  or  supervising  the  conduct  of  its  business.  This  includes \nresponsibility  for  corporate  governance.  The  board  is  required  to  establish  committees  to \noversee  audit  and  compliance,  credit  and  risk,  assets  and  liabilities,  and  remuneration.  All \ncommittee members must be approved by the board.  \n \n15. \nThe compliance department manages reporting of any suspicious transactions.

The loan\u2019s size is based on the significant unmet demand for \nMSME financing in Cambodia and on the bank\u2019s historical and expected loan growth.11 ACLEDA \nBank Plc projects a lending program of $300 million for 2014 and, as the only bank operating in \nmuch of the country, is uniquely positioned to deliver the unmet demand for financial services, \nparticularly  in  rural  areas.  The  bank\u2019s  successful  new  mobile  banking  platform  addresses  the \nneeds of underserved areas and is expected to generate even greater levels of demand for the \nbank\u2019s services in future years.  \n \n17. \nThe ADB loan, equivalent to about 25% of the bank\u2019s 2014 funding and business plan, \nwill  make  a meaningful contribution  to  its growth  and  support  of  MSMEs. The  proceeds  of the \nloan will be used exclusively to support MSMEs.12 The assistance will enhance MSME access to \nlonger-term  finance,  which  is  in  turn  critical  to  support  poverty  alleviation  through  income  and \nemployment generation in the rural areas where about 90% of Cambodia\u2019s poor live. A portion \nof  the  risk  on  ADB\u2019s  loan  may  be  transferred  to  counterparties  that  are  eligible  under  ADB\u2019s \npolicies.13 \n \nB. \n \n18. \nACLEDA  Bank  Plc  will  be  required to  provide  annual  audited financial  statements. The \nbank  will  also  provide  quarterly  financial  statements  and  compliance  certificates  for  agreed \ncovenants.  Reporting  requirements  will  include  updates  on  governance,  safeguards,  social \nprotection compliance, and on ACLEDA Bank Plc\u2019s business performance and use of the ADB \nloan.  ADB  will  field  review  missions  at  least  annually  to  review  and  discuss  progress  with  the \nbank\u2019s management. \n \nC. \n \n19. \n \n\nADB\u2019s support for ACLEDA Bank Plc will add value in several ways:  \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n(i) \n\nADB will provide stable, long-term financing that currently cannot be raised from \nthe local market and is needed to help the bank address the maturity mismatch \non its balance sheet. Cambodia\u2019s capital markets are nascent. Public confidence \nin  the  financial  sector  is  relatively  weak.  No  interbank  market  exists  for \ncommercial  bank  funding,  and  the  bank  has  no  access  to  debt  capital  markets. \nADB engagement is also greatly needed because IFIs that provide funding to the \ncountry\u2019s  financial  sector  have  already  reached  country,  sector,  and  single \ninvestment and borrower exposure limits.  \n\n                                                \n11 ACLEDA\u2019s loan portfolio grew by $270 million in each of 2011 and 2012. \n12 The government and this report classify these enterprises by total assets and number of employees as (i) micro, if \nthey  have  total  assets  of  less  than  $50,000  and  fewer  than  10  employees;  (ii) small, if  they  have  total  assets  of \n$50,000\u2013$250,000  and  11\u201350  employees;  (iii)  medium,  if  they  have  total  assets  of  $250,000\u2013$500,000  and  51\u2013\n100 employees; and (iv) large, if they have total assets of more than $500,000 and greater than 100 employees.  \n\n13 The terms of the risk transfer arrangements, if any, will be approved by the ADB Investment Committee. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  ADB  loan  will  help  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  diversify  its  lending  base  and  fulfill \nplans  to  open  an  additional  50  branches  by  the  end  of  2017.  This  will  broaden \nthe availability of banking services and critically needed financing for MSMEs in \nparts of the country that are now underserved.  \nThe  loan  will  be  an  important  step  in  supporting  private  sector  growth  in \nCambodia. ADB has been the lead development partner in Cambodia\u2019s financial \nsector since 2001, and, as its first long-term, nonsovereign financing intervention \nwith  a  Cambodian  bank,  the  loan  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  work  in  the \nsector.  \nApart from increasing the number of women borrowers overall, the ADB loan will \npromote  greater  financial  inclusion  for  women  entrepreneurs  through  the \nimplementation of the measures in the gender action plan. \n \n\nRisks \n\nD. \n \n20. \nChallenging  operational  environment.  Cambodia  has  a  small,  narrow,  and \nunderdeveloped  economy,  and  its  dependence  on  agriculture,  garment  exports  and  tourism \nmakes economic growth volatile.  Although  no run on  deposits  occurred during  the  2008\u20132009 \nglobal financial crisis, consumer confidence in the banking system has historically been low. To \nmitigate  these  risks,  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  prudently  manages  its  capital  and  liquidity  positions, \nand maintains a diversified loan portfolio.  \n \n21. \nRapid growth of credit. Continued rapid credit growth could jeopardize macroeconomic \nand financial stability in Cambodia. Although it was from a small and narrow base, credit growth \nspiked in 2011 and 2012 and continues to be robust, rising by 15% in the first 6 months of 2013. \nHowever,  the  country  still  has  one  of  the  lowest  rates  of  financial  intermediation  in  Asia  when \nmeasured by banking sector credit to gross domestic product (GDP). The NBC has stated that it \nwill  adopt  a  stronger,  risk-based,  forward-looking  approach  to  bank  supervision.  It  also \nincreased the reserve rate requirement by 50 basis points in 2012 to 12.5%. The NBC continues \nto monitor credit growth to maintain sound asset quality across the sector.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\n \nA. \n \n22. \nImpacts.  The  impacts  will  be  (i)  growth  of  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector;  (ii)  increased \nfinancial inclusion in Cambodia; and (iii) improved access to commercial bank credit by MSMEs. \nThis will be indicated by an increase in bank deposits and loans, as well as an increase in the \nratio of banking sector credit to GDP and higher levels of credit in rural areas.  \n \n23. \nThe loan will contribute to improving financial inclusion by providing additional financing \nfor MSMEs, primarily in rural areas. MSMEs dominate the economy, in terms of the number of \nfirms (99%) and employment (73%) (footnote 2). They play an important role in (i) job creation; \n(ii) generating  income  for  low-income  people  and  vulnerable  populations;  and  (iii) fostering \neconomic  growth,  social  stability,  and  contributing  to  growth  of  a  dynamic  private  sector. \nMSMEs  are  poorly  served  by  the  banking  system,  and  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  is  the  only \ncommercial  bank  to  have  developed  a  national  branch  network  and  specialized  lending \npractices to reach these underserved customers. \n \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  the  growth  and  sustainability  of  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc\u2019s \n24. \nservices  to  MSMEs.  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  is  expected  to  set  an  example  for  other  banks  by \ncontinuing  to  expand  its  outreach  to  rural  areas  by  adding  to  its  branch  network,  while \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nmaintaining  good  asset  quality  and  funding  private  economic  activity  in  underserved  areas.  A \nlarge number of new MSME customers are expected to be women. \n \n25. \nOutput. The output will be ACLEDA\u2019s Bank Plc\u2019s expanded financial capacity to service \nMSMEs,  primarily  in  rural  areas,  while  ensuring  that  adequate  investment  is  made  in  human \nresources, processes, and branch infrastructure as it expands its network in remote locations. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nConsistency  with  Strategy  2020  and  country  strategy.  Strategy  2020\u2019s  mission  of \npoverty  reduction,  its  inclusive  economic  growth  agenda,  its  emphasis  on  private  sector \ndevelopment  as  a  driver  of  change,  and  its  focus  on  the  need  to  expand  the  outreach  of \nfinancial  systems  will  be  supported  through  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc\u2019s  emphasis  on  funding \nunderserved segments of the population, where productivity is low and potential for increases in \nemployment and income generation are high.14 The CPS cites limited access to finance as a key \nconstraint  to  private  sector  development  in  Cambodia,  makes  the  financial  sector  one  of  five \npriority  sectors,  and  identifies  MSME  finance  as  a  priority  subsector.  A  new  CPS  now  being \nprepared will continue to make support for the financial sector and for expanding MSME access \nto finance a priority for ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations.  \n \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  loan  will \n27. \ncomplement  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  initiatives  in  the  financial  sector,  as  well  as  the  government\u2019s \n10-year  rolling  financial  sector  development  strategy  for  2011\u20132020. 15  The  government \nstrategy\u2019s  main  goal  is  to  develop  a  sound  financial  sector  that  can  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction  by  supporting  economic  growth  and  giving  lower-income  people  greater  access  to \nfinance.  ADB  has  been supporting government  reform  efforts  since  approving  its first financial \nsector  program  for  the  country  in  2001.  16 ADB\u2019s  contributions  have  been  in  such  areas  as \n(i) modernizing  the  national  payment,  clearance,  and  settlement  system;  (ii)  strengthening \nregulation  and  supervision  of  banks  and  microfinance  institutions;  (iii)  introducing  higher \nstandards  of  accounting,  auditing,  and  financial  reporting;  (iv) establishing  a  registry  to  record \nassets  that  banks  accept  as  security  for  loans;  (v) drafting  and  successfully  supporting  the \npassage  of  a  securities  law;  and  (vi) launching  the  credit  information  bureau.  While  progress \nhas  been  achieved,  formal  finance  remains  unavailable  in  a  large  part  of  the  country,  and \naccess to finance to support the growing economy has remained well below potential.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nThe  loan  is  classified  as  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.  Subprojects classified as category A for impacts on  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples will not be financed under ADB\u2019s \nsenior  loan.  The  risks  associated  with  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc\u2019s  existing  and  likely  future  portfolio \nhave  been  assessed,  as  have  its  commitment  and  capacity  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement.  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  will  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  ensure \nthat loans extended using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, comply \n\n                                                \n14  ADB. 2008.

Women  comprise  38%  of  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc\u2019s  staff  and  the  bank\u2019s  human  resource \npolicies are based on providing equal opportunities. ACLEDA Bank Plc had more than 178,000 \nfemale  borrowers  as  of  31 August  2013,  representing  54%  of  total  borrowers.  Based  on  an \nassessment  of  the  capacity  and  commitment  of  ACLEDA  Bank  Plc  to  promote  gender  equity, \ngender  inclusiveness  has  been  incorporated  as  an  integral  feature  of  this  project,  which  is \nclassified as effective gender mainstreaming.18  \n \nB. \n \nACLEDA  Bank  Plc  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \n30. \ndate),  and  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering,  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  ADB  will  require \nACLEDA  Bank  Plc  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  and \nmoney laundering activities and the financing of terrorism, and to covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities.  \n \nC. \n \n31. \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 19  the \n32. \nGovernment of Cambodia\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to  ACLEDA Bank Plc will \nbe  obtained.
