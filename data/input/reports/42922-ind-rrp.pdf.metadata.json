As  an  honest  broker,  ADB  provides \ndirect  comfort  to  both  the  local  and  foreign  investors  through  its \nproposed equity participation in the JVC. \n \nAlongside  those  from  other  investors  and  debt,  the  proceeds  of \nADB\u2019s  investment  will  be  used  to  fund  the  development  and \nconstruction  of  the  renewable  energy  projects,  as  well  as  the \nincorporation and start-up expenses of the JVC.  \n \nThe  proposed  outcome  of  the  investment  will  be  500  MW  of \nadditional  renewable-power  generation  by  2012  by  implementing \nprojects \nthus  catalyzing \ninvestment  from  the  private  sector.  The  investment  will  help \ndiversify  India's  energy  mix  away  from  its  dependence  on  fossil \nfuels, notably coal-fired thermal projects, toward more sustainable \nenergy  sources,  and  contribute  to  the  national  goal  of  achieving \nand  maintaining  10%  of  total  power  generation  from  renewable \nsources by 2012. \n \n\nthrough  public-private  partnership, \n\n \nInvestment Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nInvestment Description \n\n \nUse of Proceeds \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nEnvironment and Social \nAssessment \n\n \nDevelopment Impact  \n\n \nJustification \n\n \n \n \n\nAs  an  equity  investment,  this  will  be  classified  as  environmental \ncategory  FI.  Given  the  nature  and  general  location  of  projects  to \nbe  financed  by  the  JVC,  the  investment  has  been  classified  as \nB/C under the ADB Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and B \nfrom  the  perspective  of  the  ADB  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998).  The  JVC  will  implement  an  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system \nfully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \npolicies,  and  will  screen,  assess,  and  monitor  projects  at  the \nappropriate  stage  of  due  diligence.  The  JVC  will  covenant  not  to \nfinance activities on ADB\u2019s list of prohibited investments. \n \nThe investment will achieve the following: \n(i) \n\nin \n\nIndia \n\nAccelerate  the  development  and  financing  of  renewable \nenergy  projects \nto  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions,  such  as  carbon  dioxide,  in  line  with  the \nMillennium Development Goals. \nHelp  reduce  India\u2019s  dependence  on  fossil  fuel  sources  to \nmeet  the  growing  power  demand  and  use  indigenous \nrenewable  sources  to  meet  and  maintain  the  policy \nobjective  of  generating  10%  of  its  power  needs  from \nrenewable sources by 2012. \nCatalyze foreign investment in the renewable-power sector \nin  India  by  facilitating  the  formation  of  a  new  independent \nutility  company  in  a  joint  venture  between  experienced \nglobal  electric  utility  companies  and  NTPC  Limited,  the \nanchor  of  India\u2019s  power  sector.  As  indicated  by  both \nforeign investors, ADB\u2019s equity participation is a key factor \nin their decision to invest in the JVC. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n \nThe  investment  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework \n2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)  and  Clean  Energy  and  Environment \nProgram,  which  calls  for  ADB  investments  in  energy  efficiency \nand renewable energy in Asia to reach about $1 billion a year and \nto  sustain  that  level.  It  helps  India  diversify  from  fossil  fuels  for \npower generation and benefit from underused indigenous sources \nof  energy.  The  proposed  JVC,  initiated  by  ADB,  introduces  the \nindependent  utility  model  for  renewables,  which  will  help  bring \ndown  the  overall  cost  of  funding  (and  hence  the  average  cost  of \ngeneration)  and  attract  other  foreign  investors  to  the  renewable \nsector. \n \n\n\f  \n\n1 \n \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nequity  investment  of  up  to  $40,000,000  equivalent  in  a  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  for \nRenewable Energy Development in India. \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n2. \nIndia is endowed with abundant renewable energy sources\u2014solar, wind, biomass, and \nsmall  hydroelectric\u2014and  the  Government  is  working  proactively  to  develop  them  to  reduce \nlong-standing  peak  power  and  energy  deficits  sustainably.  Under  the  \u201cPower  for  All  by  2012\u201d \ninitiative,  the  Government  looks  forward  to  universal  electricity  supply  in  India  by  2012.  The \nmagnitude  of  the  investment  is  vast:  78,700  MW  of  additional  power  generation  capacity  is \nneeded to reach that goal. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)  (formerly the \nMinistry  of  Non-Conventional  Energy  Sources)  has  proposed  exploiting  the  full  potential  of \nrenewable energy sources to increase generation capacity in the country. The National Electric \nPolicy, issued by the Ministry of Power in February 2005, also emphasized the development of \nrenewable energy sources, and the Integrated Energy Policy of August 2006 provided the vision \nneeded  to  reliably  meet  the  demand  for  energy  in  a  technically  efficient,  economically  viable, \nand environmentally sustainable manner.  \n \n3. \nSince  its  inception,  India\u2019s  renewable  energy  program  has  been  driven  by  policies and \npromotional  measures  framed  initially  by  MNRE  and  subsequently  by  the  state  governments. \nThe  promotional  measures  available  to  renewable  energy  projects  comprise  a  wide  range  of \nfiscal  and  financial  incentives,  including  concessional  loans,  concessional  customs  duties, \nexemptions  from  excise  duties,  income  tax  holidays,  and  accelerated  depreciation  benefits. \nThese  policies  have  led  to  the  development  by  January 2009  of  13,000  MW  of  renewable \nenergy, 9% of total power generation in the country. To accelerate the promotion of renewable \nenergy, most state electric regulatory commissions (SERCs) have imposed minimum amounts \nof  renewable  energy  purchase  obligations  on  licensed  distributors  in  their  states.  The \nrequirements  are  aligned  with  achieving  the  national  renewable  energy  target  of  10%  of  total \npower  generation  capacity\u201422,000  MW  of  renewable  energy\u2014by  2012,  according  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan (FYP).1 \n \nNTPC Limited (established in 1975 as the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited) \n4. \noperates over 29,000 MW in thermal-power generating capacity in India and, with a 28% market \nshare, is the industry anchor. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has an existing relationship \nwith NTPC through a nonsovereign loan facility signed in September 20062 to partially finance \ntwo  supercritical  thermal  power  plants  in  India.  ADB  has  encouraged  NTPC  to  continue \ndiversifying its sources of power generation and improving the environmental aspects of future \nprojects.  NTPC  has  set  a  corporate  goal  of  adding  1,000 MW  of  capacity  through  renewable \nenergy sources.  \n \n5. \nADB and NTPC have also discussed the establishment of a new joint venture company \n(JVC), with private sector entities as majority owners, to develop renewable power sources on a \nlarger  scale  as  a  power  utility  would,  instead  of  project  by  project.

The JVC would also include the energy \nfinancial  services  group  of  General  Electric  Energy  of  the  United  States  (GE Energy)  and \nKyushu  Electric  Power  Company  of  Japan  (Kyushu),  private  sector  power  companies  whose \nglobal expertise in renewable energy would be invaluable to the venture. The proposed equity \ninvestment  received  concept  clearance  in  January  2008,  and  due  diligence  was  completed  in \nFebruary 2009. If approved, the investment would be ADB\u2019s first in a public-private partnership \nto develop, construct, and operate renewable energy projects in India. \n\nIII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Background, Performance Indicators, and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nDemand for and Supply of Power \n\nIndia  is  the  third-largest  electricity  consumer  in  Asia  behind  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \n6. \nChina  and  Japan.  As  of  31  January  2009,  its  installed  power  generation  capacity  was \n147,452 MW,  of  which  56%  was  owned  and  operated  by  state  entities,  33%  by  central  public \nsector undertakings, and 11% by independent power producers and other private sector utilities. \nThermal  power  plants,  mostly  coal-fired,  provide  63%  of  installed  capacity.  Hydropower \naccounts  for  25%  of  the  capacity,  and  renewable  energy  plants  and  nuclear  plants,  for  the \nremaining 12%.3 Industry buys about 35% of the electricity sold in India, followed by households \nat 25%, agriculture at 22%, and businesses and others at 18%.4 Annual consumption per capita \nis  relatively  low,  at  slightly  over  700 kilowatt-hours  (kWh),  despite  the  growing  economy.  In \naddition,  power  quality  remains  poor,  marked  by  high  voltage  fluctuations  and  recurring  load \nshedding.  India  continues  to  suffer  from  chronic  electricity  shortages,  with  peak  demand \nexceeding supply by 13.8% and the energy deficit at 11.0% as of January 2009 (footnote 3). \n \n7. \nPower demand in India has grown rapidly as the economy has expanded, at an annual \naverage rate of 6.8% in real terms since FY1995.5 As the 10th FYP (2002\u20132007) achieved only \n52% of the targeted increase in capacity, energy shortfalls will persist at least over the short to \nmedium  term.  Target  capacity  has  been  expanded  to  78,700  MW  for  the  11th  FYP  period \n(2007\u20132012),  to  keep  the  longer-term  economic  growth  target  within  reach.  This  excludes  the \n11th FYP target for renewable energy generation capacity proposed by MNRE of 15,000 MW, \nincluding 14,000 MW of grid-interactive renewable power and 1,000 MW of off-grid renewable \npower.  If  these  ambitious  goals  are  attained,  India  should  be  able  to  achieve  its  national \nelectricity  policy  goal  of  Power  for  All  by  2012  and  available  power  per  capita  should  reach \n1,000 kWh by FY2012. \n \nThe availability of electric power, and more broadly infrastructure, has indirect but strong \n8. \nlinks to poverty reduction and economic growth. In 2008, India\u2019s finance minister suggested that \nthe country\u2019s lack of adequate infrastructure was holding back its economic growth by 1.5%\u20132% \nper year.6 Empirical evidence presented by other comprehensive studies on the links between \nnew  electricity  availability  and  economic  growth  suggest  that  increases  in  per  capita  gross \n\n                                                 \n3   Central Electricity Authority. 2009.

During  the  11th  FYP  period, \nutility-based generation is set to increase by 78,000 MW, with coal-fired thermal power making \nup the majority. Table 1 shows the energy mix for electricity generation in India as of the end of \n2007 and the estimated generation of GHG emissions per unit of electricity. \n\n \nTable 1: Energy Mix and Emission Intensity for Electricity Generation in India, 2007 \n\nFuel Source \nCoal \nHydropower \nOil / Diesel / Naphtha \nNatural gas \nWind and solar power \nNuclear power \n\nProportion \n(%) \n53 \n25 \n1 \n10 \n8 \n3 \n\nWeighted Average GHG Emissionsa \n(tons CO2 per MWh) \n1.08 \n\u2013   \n0.62 \n0.47 \n\u2013   \n\u2013   \n\nCO2 = carbon dioxide, GHG = greenhouse gas, MWh = megawatt-hour. \na  Values denoted by a hyphen are negligible or not measurable. \nSource: Central Electricity Authority. 2008. CO2 Baseline Data for the Indian Power Sector. New Delhi. \n\n \n10.  While  total  emissions  from  the  power  sector  have  been  increasing  in  the  past  3  years \n(from 469 million tons of carbon dioxide [CO2] in 2006 to 520 million tons of CO2 in 2008), the \nweighted  average  operating  emissions  intensity  rate  (tons  per  CO2  per  megawatt-hour)  has \nbeen declining slightly (from 0.82 to 0.80).8 \n \n11. \nIn  2008,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  issued  the  National  Action  Plan  on  Climate \nChange to raise the living standards of the majority of Indians and at the same time reduce their \nvulnerability  to  the  impact  of  climate  change.  The  action  plan  is  guided  by  the  principles  of \nprotecting the poor through inclusive and sustainable development, deploying technologies for \nthe mitigation of GHG emissions, and engineering new and innovative market, regulatory, and \nvoluntary mechanisms to promote sustainable development on an equitable basis.9 \n \n12. \nThe  action  plan  comprises  eight  national  missions  defining  multipronged,  long-term, \nintegrated  strategies  for  achieving  climate-change  objectives.  These  eight  missions  include, \namong  other  items,  sustainable  agriculture,  enhanced  energy  efficiency,  use  of  solar  energy, \nand the \u201cgreening\u201d of India. India\u2019s development agenda defined in the 11th FYP targets poverty \neradication as a prerequisite for economic growth. As of 2005, 27.5% of the population lived in \npoverty and 44% had no access to power. India\u2019s goal of increasing access to power for all its \ncitizens  is  based  in  part  on  the  strong  positive  correlation  between  energy  use  and  human \ndevelopment.10 \n\n                                                 \n7    Esfahani,  H.

India is therefore urgently exploring sustainable energy development, while reducing GHG \nintensity.  Two  major  areas  of  renewable  energy  development,  in  view  of  their  natural \nabundance, are wind power and small hydropower. \n\na. \n\nWind Power in India \n\nAmong  the  renewable  power  resources  available  in  India,  wind  energy  is  a  promising \n14. \nsource for further development. India has over 45,000 MW of gross potential and 13,000 MW of \ntechnical potential for wind power. A 2,200 MW increase in installed wind power capacity was \ntargeted  in  the  10th  FYP,  but  over  5,400  MW  was  actually  installed.11 As  of  September  2007, \nIndia,  with  over  7,700  MW  of  installed  wind  power  capacity,  ranked  fourth  in  the  world  after \nGermany, the United States, and Spain.  \n \n15. \nThe  Government  has  provided  support  measures  to  increase  renewable  energy \ncontributions  in  the  country.  It  has  also  issued  policy  guidelines  for  the  state  governments  to \nestablish  and  maintain  state-specific  policies  to  promote  renewable  power  projects.  These \npolicies  include  permission  to  accelerate  depreciation,  concession  or  full  exemption  from \ncustoms  duties,  tax  holidays,  and  soft  loans  available  through  government-owned  agencies. \nOther policy and financial incentives are now being implemented by MNRE.  \n \n16. \nThe wind power sector in India has been dominated by indigenous wind-turbine original \nequipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as Suzlon Energy, Enercon (India), RRB Energy, and \nVestas  Wind  Technology,  which  collected  wind  resource  data  early  on  and  obtained  land-use \nrights  for  potential  sites.  These  manufacturers-cum-developers  can  fully  develop  and  operate \ncommercial  wind  farms  on  their  own  behalf,  sell  the  development  rights  to  other  developers \nthrough  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  contracts,  or  carve  out  portions  of  the \nplanned  wind  farms  for  other  investors.  In  all  cases,  project  concessions  require  validation  of \nwind resource data by the Center for Wind Energy Technology. While this process has led to an \ninitial rise in wind power installations, it has also hindered the development of potential sites as \nreturns  to  other  investors  are  limited  by  the  prices  offered  by  the  OEMs.  Appendix  2  contains \nmore information on the wind-power sector in India. \n\nb. \n\nState Regulatory Environment for Wind Power  \n\n17. \nThe SERCs control the approval of wind power projects for grid connectivity and the sale \nof  electricity  to  the  utilities.  Most  of  the  SERCs  in  states  with  high  wind  potential  have \nstandardized  long-term  power  purchase  agreements  (PPAs)  and  declared  feed-in  tariffs  as \nprovided  in  the  Electricity  Act  2003  and  the  National  Electricity  Tariff  Policy.  These  states \ninclude  Maharashtra,  Karnataka,  Rajasthan,  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  Tamil  Nadu.  Offtake  of \npower from wind and renewables is guaranteed via \u201cmust-run status\u201d priority in the merit-order \ndispatch of total electricity from all utilities in each state. \n \n\n                                                 \n11  Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.  2007.  Annual Report 2006\u20132007.  New Delhi. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\nA first-year accelerated-depreciation incentive at 80% is also offered; however, in light of \n18. \nthe  typically  low  profitability  during  the  first  year  of  operation,  this  incentive,  in  some  cases, \nprovides only a limited tax shield. Many developers of early wind projects were in fact investors \nin more diversified businesses not related to energy, so that the depreciation benefits and tax \nshield  could  be  applied  to  consolidated  profits.  This  process  led  to  inefficient  operation  or \nmaintenance  of  wind  turbines,  reducing  availability  and  utilization.  In  response  to  this \nunintended  consequence,  MNRE  in  2008  announced  a  generation-based  incentive  as  an \nalternative  to  accelerated  depreciation.  The  incentive  is  Rs0.50  per  kWh  paid  on  top  of  the \nfeed-in  tariffs  set  by  SERCs  for  a  period  of  10  years  after  the  commercial  operation  date. \nMNRE\u2019s initial target of 49 MW to qualify for the incentive is likely to increase to 5,000 MW by \n2012. \n\nc. \n\nSmall Hydroelectric Power in India \n\nThe  Central  Electric  Authority  has  estimated \n\n19. \nIndia\u2019s  hydropower  potential  at \n148,700 MW, with 28,000 MW in operation and 14,000 MW in various stages of development.12 \nThe  potential  installed  capacity  of  small  hydropower13 is  estimated  at  15,000 MW;  only  about \n2,000 MW is in operation. Hydropower generation is often the only means of providing electricity \nto  low-income  populations  in  remote  hilly  areas  with  limited  access  to  grid  connection.  Small \nhydropower  is  also  more  predictable  than  solar  or  wind  power:  variations  in  water  flow  occur \nover longer periods, rather than hourly or daily. \n \n20.  MNRE oversees the development of small hydropower and has set a target of facilitating \nthe development of about 2,000 MW through 2012. The focus of the small-hydropower program \nis commercialization through private sector participation with physical and financial incentives.14 \nMNRE  is  providing  the  states  with  financial  support  for  project  development\u2014for  the \nidentification  of  new  potential  sites,  the  conduct  of  detailed  surveys,  and  the  preparation  of \ndetailed project reports\u2014and implementation incentives consisting of interest subsidies ranging \nfrom  1.50%  to  5.00%  for  commercially  developed  1\u201325  MW  projects.  The  South  Asia \nDepartment  of  ADB  has  also  been  working  with  state  governments  on  the  development  of \nhydropower projects in the states of Uttarakhand15 and Himachal Pradesh.16 Further details on \nthe small hydroelectric power market in India can be found in Appendix 3. \n\n4. \n\nConstraints on Private Sector Participation \n\nDespite the programs put in place by central and state agencies, foreign investment in \n21. \nthe  Indian  renewable  power  sector  remains  limited.  The  sector  continues  to  be  dominated  by \nwind-turbine  OEMs,  local  investors,  and  existing  power  utilities,  which  seek  to  maximize  the \naccelerated-depreciation  benefits  (or  must  now  meet  state-mandated  renewable  power \npurchase  obligations).  Participation  tends  to  be  project  by  project  and  without  a  coordinated \nstrategic approach to meeting the Government\u2019s renewable energy standards efficiently. \n \n\n                                                 \n12 Prime Minister\u2019s Council on Climate Change.  2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nThe  MNRE  has  established  tax  and  generation  incentives  to  encourage  private  sector \n22. \nparticipation in wind power, but significant barriers tend to put off some private sector investors. \nThese barriers include (i) the absence of comparable economies of scale in renewable projects, \n(ii) marginal  commercial  viability,  (iii)  the  inability  to  sustain  regulatory  incentives,  and  (iv)  the \ncollection  and  credit  risk  assumed  by  state  offtakers  who  cannot  negotiate  additional \npayment-security or hypothecation provisions. Due diligence to determine the technical merits of \nprojects,  verify  land  ownership  and  approvals,  and  negotiate  offtake  contracts  and  power \nevacuation  can  also  be  cumbersome  to  less-experienced  investors  without  access  to  local \nexpertise. \n  \n23. \nSmall hydropower developers with no experience in managing the development process, \nor those with limited access to capital required to complete the detailed studies, have difficulty \novercoming  the  technical,  procedural,  and  cost  barriers.  Typically,  developers  must  obtain  a \nproject allotment from the state nodal agency, clearance from the Ministry of Environment and \nForests  (MoEF)  if  forest  land  is  involved,  and  clearances  from  the  irrigation,  water  resources, \nand  state  land-use  departments  to  have  their  projects  approved.  In  the  absence  of  a \nstreamlined, single-window clearance system, the process of obtaining approvals can set back \norganizations  unfamiliar  with  the  process.  While  local  banks  and  financial  institutions  may  be \nwilling to lend long term to such projects, the development and time-sensitive construction risks \nusually necessitate recourse to financial resources from outside the project, such as a corporate \nguarantee. Hence, private investment in small hydropower projects have ironically been limited \nto  the  larger  infrastructure  and  power  project  developers.  In  both  the  wind  power  and  small \nhydropower  subsectors,  the  JVC  will  implement  a  new  business  model  that  will  leverage  the \npartners\u2019  financial  strength,  technical  expertise,  and  industry  relationships  (in  India  and \nworldwide)  to  pursue  such  projects  on  a  much  larger  scale  as  an  independent  electric  utility \ncompany focused solely on the renewable business.  \n\nB. \n\nADB Operations, Strategy, and Sector Policy \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\n24.  Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy for India.17 The 2009\u20132012 country partnership strategy is now in the advanced stages \nof  development.  The  2006\u20132008  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  update  draws  on  the \nthree  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy:  pro-poor  growth,  social  development,  and \ngood  governance.  The  strategy  is  aimed  at  supporting  the  achievement  of  the  Government\u2019s \nhigh-growth agenda by assisting in fiscal consolidation, infrastructure development, and private \nsector  development.  Political  and  economic  developments  since  the  last  approved  CSP  was \nfinalized  indicate  that  the  assistance  strategy  remains  valid,  especially  the  core  strategy  of \npoverty reduction through infrastructure-led growth supported by social development and good \ngovernance. The CSP update suggests that, for GDP growth to accelerate to 8%  as planned, \ninfrastructure  facilities  must  be  upgraded  and  public  services  must  be  made  more  efficient. \nADB\u2019s proposed assistance program reflects this priority: infrastructure accounts for nearly 77% \nof the 3-year pipeline (not including private sector and other nonsovereign operations).  \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s strategy for the energy sector18 establishes its operational priorities as (i) reducing \n25. \npoverty  by,  among  others,  creating  energy  infrastructure  for  sustainable  economic  growth; \n(ii) promoting  private  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an \nenabling  environment  for  private  investors;  (iii)  addressing  the  environmental  impact  on  the \nregion  and  the  rest  of  the  world;  and  (iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation.  In  particular,  the \nstrategy strongly encourages ADB interventions to increase investment in the renewable energy \nsubsector,  as  well  as  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the  energy  sector  to  take \nadvantage of the higher operational efficiencies that private operators can achieve and to meet \nthe large capital requirements. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  power  sector,  as  outlined  in  the  2006\u20132008  CSP  update,  has \nsix main priorities: (i) reforming the sector; (ii) promoting higher-efficiency and low-carbon power \nsources  that  are  locally  available;  (iii)  expanding  and  optimizing  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems; (iv) supporting institutional strengthening to implement the reforms required under the \nElectricity  Act  of  2003,  including  the  development  of  more  flexible  power  delivery  and  trading \nsystems;  (v)  promoting  private  sector  participation;  and  (vi)  encouraging  energy  conservation, \nand  ensuring  environmental  and  social  sustainability.  To  support  the  Government\u2019s  Power  for \nAll by 2012 initiative, ADB\u2019s strategy for the power sector will create synergy with the 11th FYP \nthrough the development of sustainable energy sources, particularly the promotion of renewable \nenergy projects, and other means. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nStrategy 2020 \n\n27. \nA  core  area  of  operation  under  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020) is environmentally-sustainable growth for the region.19 One of the key actions is \nmitigating  climate  change.  ADB  will  assist  the  developing  member  countries  in  moving  to \nlow-carbon  growth  paths  by  (i)  improving  energy  efficiency,  (ii)  expanding  the  use  of  clean \nenergy  sources,  (iii) reducing  fugitive  GHG  emissions,  (iv)  modernizing  public  transport \nsystems, and (v) arresting deforestation. \n \nThe ADB 2009 Energy Policy20 emphasizes, among other objectives, the development of \n28. \nindigenous  energy  sources  and  the  creation  of  markets  conducive  to  foreign  investment  in \ndeveloping  member  countries.  The  2009  policy  updates  the  1995  policy  and  its  2000  review, \nand  aligns  ADB\u2019s  energy  initiatives  with  Strategy  2020.  One  of  the  principles  of  the  policy\u2019s \nimplementation  is  the  promotion  of  clean  energy  projects  and  the  provision  of  energy  to \ncommunities  and  groups  with  no  access  to  its  economic  and  social  benefits.  As  part  of  the \npolicy  implementation,  ADB  is  emphasizing  public-private  partnerships  to  enhance  energy \nsector efficiency by increasing competition and investable resources. The objective is to create \na framework that makes investing in renewable energy a commercially viable proposition. ADB \nis committed to facilitating direct private sector participation.  \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED JOINT-VENTURE COMPANY \n\nA. \n\nCompany Mission and Objectives \n\nInvestments  in  the  renewable  energy  sector  involve  more  risks  than  investments  in \n29. \nconventional energy sources because of (i) the relatively higher cost per unit; (ii) the uncertainty \nof  equipment  life  and  long-term  maintenance  resources;  (iii)  technical  issues  such  as  voltage \ncontrol  and  loss  optimization  in  remotely  connected  generation;  (iv)  commercial  issues,  since \nrenewable energy is not a substitute for firm capacity; and (v) the long gestation and breakeven \nperiod for investments. ADB\u2019s participation is needed, given the heightened risk perceptions and \nwithdrawal  of  investors  and  lenders  in  the  global  liquidity  and  credit  crisis.  Thus,  for  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  renewable  energy  projects,  investors  must  not  only  have \ntechnical,  project  management,  and  procurement  abilities  but  must  also  be  skilled  in  the \ncommercial  aspects  and  in  long-term  financing  and  risk  taking.  A  combination  of  financially \nstrong electric power utilities, experienced renewable energy investors, and financial institutions \nthat can provide long-term financing would be best equipped to succeed at this task. \n \n30. \nNTPC, ADB, Kyushu, and GE Energy propose  to combine their aligned objectives and \nmanagement  capabilities  in  a  public\u2013private  JVC  that  will  develop,  construct,  operate,  and \nmaintain renewable energy projects with maximum development impact on the people of India. \nSuccess in achieving India\u2019s renewable energy target of 10% of total power generation depends \nin large part on private sector participation in the selection, development, and implementation of \nprojects  in  a  timely  and  cost-effective  manner.  However,  the  present  model,  where  private \nsector investors develop one project at a time, is not the most efficient path to renewable energy \ngeneration.  Developing  renewable  projects  in  a  portfolio  allows  the  blending  of  credit,  offtake, \ndevelopment, and technical risks, and potentially lowers the overall cost of financing. The JVC \nwill endeavor to invest in a portfolio of 500 MW of renewable energy generation projects in India \nover a period of 3 years.  \n \n31. \nTo  start  with,  the  JVC  will  concentrate  on  wind  power  and  small  hydroelectric  power \nprojects  in  India.  But  other  renewable  power  generation  resources,  such  as  industrial \ncogeneration,  waste-to-energy,  solar,  geothermal,  biomass,  biofuel,  and  tidal  energy  projects, \nmay also be considered. In the future, the JVC could adopt a regional and global outlook as a \nmajor investor in, and facilitator of, renewable energy. \n\nB. \n\nOrganization and Management \n\n1. \n\nShareholders \n\n32. \nThe JVC will be established as a partnership between public and private shareholders. \nAt  incorporation,  the  largest  shareholding  (40%)  will  be  held  by  NTPC,  a  state-owned \nenterprise. The rest of the shares will be held equally by ADB and two global power companies, \nKyushu (Japan) and GE Energy (United States). The foreign partners were selected jointly by \nADB  and  NTPC  in  a  structured  expression-of-interest  process  on  the  basis  of  their  financial \nstrength, global experience in carrying out renewable energy projects, and long-term interest in \ninvesting  in  the  Indian  power  sector.  At  no  point  will  the  Government  of  India  hold,  directly  or \nindirectly,  more  than  50%  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  shares.  More  information  about  the \nshareholders is in Appendix 4. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nNTPC,  89%  of  which  is  owned  by  the  Government,  is  the  premier  power  generation \n33. \ncompany  in  India,  with  expertise  and  strength  in  such  areas  as  establishing,  operating,  and \nmaintaining  large  power  projects,  and  selling  power  to  various  state  power  utilities  and  other \nbulk  customers.  It  operates  over  29,000  MW  of  power  generation  capacity.  According  to  its \naudited  statements  for  FY2008,  NTPC  has  a  turnover  of  Rs400.2  billion  net  profit  after  tax  of \nRs75.1  billon  and  net  worth  of  Rs526  billion.  It  is  rated  BBB\u2212  by  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  but  was \nrecently placed on negative watch because of the deterioration of the sovereign\u2019s fiscal position. \nNTPC has developed comprehensive in-house expertise in various facets of power generation, \nfrom  concept  to  commissioning,  efficient  operation,  and  nurturing  of  ecology  and  the \nenvironment  in  accordance  with  the  policies  of  the  Government.  Its  corporate  plan  foresees \nabout 1,000 MW in additional capacity up to 2017 from renewable energy sources.  \n \nKyushu,  the  fourth-largest  electric  power  company  in  Japan,  operates  193  power \n34. \ngeneration  facilities  with  a  total  capacity  of  19,716  MW  on  Kyushu  and  surrounding  islands. \nWhile  a  majority  of  this  capacity  is  thermal  and  nuclear  power,  the  company  also  has \n138 hydroelectric  power  stations  (2,676  MW),  five  geothermal  power  stations  (207 MW),  and \ntwo wind power stations (3.3 MW) in its renewable energy portfolio. Its overseas investments in \nAsia  include  the  1,200  MW  Ilijan  gas-fired  power  project  in  the  Philippines  and  the  717 MW \nPhu My 3 gas-fired power project in Viet Nam, which was partially financed by ADB. In FY2008, \nKyushu  had  a  turnover  of  $14.8  billion,  net  profit  after  tax  of  $416.4  million,  and  net  worth  of \n$23.0  billion.  That  year,  Kyushu  began  voluntarily  reducing  its  CO2  emissions,  with  the  aim  of \nachieving a 20% reduction in the 1990 levels by 2012. It plans to add substantial wind, biomass, \nand solar projects by 2017. \n \nA business unit of General Electric (GE),  GE  Energy Financial Services provides long-\n35. \nterm debt, mezzanine, and equity finance to the energy and water sectors around the world and \nhas over $14 billion in assets, backed by GE's technical knowledge and financial strength. GE is \nrated AA+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s. It invests more than $5 billion each year in energy and water, \ntwo of the world\u2019s most capital-intensive industries. It adds more than 25 years of lending and \ninvesting experience in these industries to GE's 100 years in the energy business. GE Energy \nFinancial Services' renewable energy portfolio of over $4 billion includes wind, biomass, biogas, \nsolar, geothermal, and small hydro projects. The company currently owns equity interest in 51 \nwind  farms  worldwide,  with  the  capacity  to  produce  more  than  2,550  MW  of  renewable \nelectricity.  Through  its  affiliated  companies,  GE  Energy  brings  technical  knowledge  from  its \nmanufacturing of high-capacity wind-turbine generators and off-grid distributed-generation sets \nand experience operating and maintaining its renewable energy equipment worldwide. \n\n2. \n\nBoard of Directors and Chief Executive Officer \n\nThe shareholders will appoint 5\u201315 nominees to the board of directors of the JVC in a \n36. \ncomposition approximately proportional to the shareholding of each investor. Initially, there will \nbe a maximum of five directors, two of whom will be nominated by NTPC and one each by ADB, \nKyushu,  and  GE  Energy.  If  ADB  decides  not  to  nominate  a  director,  it  will  have  the  right  to \nappoint an observer to the board. For the first 10 years after formation of the JVC and subject to \nthe  unanimous  consent  of  the  parties,  the  board  will  be  chaired  by  a  director  nominated  by \nNTPC, who will preside over the meetings of the board and the shareholders.  \n \nThe JVC will form its own professional management team under a chief executive officer \n37. \n(CEO)  and  supported  by  executives  in  engineering,  finance,  human  resources,  and  utility \noperations.  The  CEO  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  JVC.  The  initial \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nactivities  will  include  proposing  the  organization  structure  of  the  JVC,  delegating  authority  to \nvarious  officials,  creating  initial  staff  positions,  having  budgets  approved  by  the  board  of \ndirectors,  and  recruiting  and  managing  the  employees.  The  CEO  will  also  be  responsible  for \nfinalizing and updating the business plan of the company.  \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact and Outcome \n\n50. \nThe  JVC  will  help  diversify  India\u2019s  energy  mix  and  wean  the  country  away  from  its \ndependence  on  fossil  fuels,  notably  coal-fired  thermal  projects,  and  toward  more  sustainable \nenergy  sources.  In  the  process,  1.1 million  tons  per  year  of  CO2  emissions  will  be  avoided,21 \nand the national goal of generating 10% of the country\u2019s power needs from renewable sources \nby 2012 will become more attainable. \n \nThe  JVC  intends  to  commission  500  MW  of  additional  renewable  power  generation  by \n51. \n201222 by  implementing  projects  through  public-private  partnership,  thus  catalyzing  investment \nfrom  the  private  sector  and  delivering  maximum  value  to  the  public  sector.  The  additional \ncapacity  would  provide  about  1.2 gigawatt-hours  of  additional  electricity  per  year,  helping  to \nbridge  the  persistent  energy  deficits  and  load  shedding,  which  disproportionally  affect  India\u2019s \npoor with limited or no access to electricity.  \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n52. \nThe  development  impact  of  the  investment  in  the  JVC  will  be  assessed  in  terms  of \nprivate  sector  development,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  according  to  the \nguidelines  for  implementing  the  Good-Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector \nInvestment Operations.23 The JVC will incubate projects in a diversified portfolio that can attract \nprivate sector investment at the time of listing or sale and by introducing the independent utility \nmodel of collaboration between a state-owned utility and strategic foreign electric utilities. With a \ntarget of continuously developing private renewable energy generation, even beyond 500 MW, \nthe JVC will demonstrate a model of renewable portfolio development for future private sector \ninvestments in alternative energy. Over the past 18 months, ADB has facilitated discussions and \nnegotiations between the state-owned enterprise and foreign investors to reconcile the different \nrisk perceptions and investment expectations. The success of the JVC may encourage further \npartnerships between the public sector and strategic foreign investors. The market assessment \nindicates that the portfolio of projects is financially and economically sustainable and will play a \nsignificant role in mitigating GHG emissions, thus leading to global environmental benefits. The \nJVC\u2019s development effectiveness framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Considerations \n\nThe initial JVC investment is classified as environmental category FI (equity investment) \n53. \nbecause the specific subprojects have not yet fully been identified.

Good-Practice Standards for Evaluation of \n\nPrivate Sector Investment Operations. Washington D.C. 3rd ed. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nmanagement  system  will  be  put  in  place  by  the  JVC  after  incorporation.  For  those  projects \nenvisioned by the JVC, the subprojects are likely to be classified as environmental category B \nbecause renewable energy projects are unlikely to create any significant negative environmental \nimpact  during  construction  and  operation.  The  JVC  will  covenant  not  to  finance  activities  that \nare on ADB\u2019s list of prohibited investment activities. As laid out in the environmental and social \nmanagement  system  framework  (Appendix  6),  each  project  will  be  properly  classified  and \nassessed in line with ADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policies before subprojects are approved \nby ADB. \n  \n54. \nThe perceptible environmental impact of wind power projects is noise and visual impact, \nbut both may be considered insignificant depending on the setback of turbines from settlements \nand the landscape values of the sites. Bird kill may be a nonissue since locations in the flight \npaths of endangered migratory birds will be avoided. Small hydroelectric projects could result in \nchanges  in  waterway  ecosystems,  in  the  migration  of  some  aquatic  species,  and  in  terrestrial \nareas affected by inundation where small amounts of pondage may be required. The JVC will \ntherefore prioritize the development of run-of-the-river configurations that require minimal or no \npondage  to  maintain  flooding  of  the  penstock,  and  will  avoid  locating  in  environmentally \nsensitive  areas  such  as  national  parks  or  wildlife  reserves.  Any  environmental  disturbance \nassociated  with  construction  (i.e.,  land  disturbance,  vegetation  clearance,  erosion  and \nsedimentation, construction noise and traffic, and waste generation) is considered temporary, by \nvirtue  of  the  limited  extent  and  significance  of  the  consequences.  The  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  for  each  project  will  minimize  or  mitigate  the  impact  during \nproject operations, and will also include monitoring arrangements. \n \nThe  project  sites  may  be  on  government  or  private  land  or  forestland.  Sites  on \n55. \ngovernment-owned  land  or  forestland  could  first  be  leased  by  the  Government  to  the  JVC  or \ndeveloper,  and  then  transferred  to  the  utility  on  commissioning.  For  privately  owned  land,  the \nland is likely to be purchased by the JVC or the developer and later transferred to the utility after \nlegal  due  diligence  by  the  utility.  The  physical  assets  of  wind  farms  have  relatively  small \nfootprints.  Wind-turbine  generators  will  be  sited  on  uninhabited  land  to  avoid  displacement  of \ncommunities  or  loss  of  livelihoods.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  amount  of  land  to  be  permanently \nacquired  or  purchased  will  be  limited,  and  effects  on  grazing  or  agricultural  activities,  if  not \navoided,  will  be  only  minimal  or  temporary.  Wind  power  projects  are  likely  to  be  developed  in \nstates  where  there  are  tribal  populations  (Karnataka,  Gujarat,  Tamil  Nadu,  Maharashtra  and \nRajasthan), but the impact on scheduled tribes is expected to be limited since only small parcels \nof land will be required and tribal community life as a whole is unlikely to be disrupted. Given the \nnature  and  general  location  of  projects  to  be  financed  by  the  JVC,  the  investment  has  been \nclassified  as  B/C  under  the  ADB  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  B  from  the \nperspective of  the  ADB  Policy on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998). The  summary  poverty  reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 7. \n\nD. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\nThe  economic  analysis  conducted  to  measure  the  viability  of  the  JVC  from  the \n59. \nperspective  of  India\u2019s  economy  (Appendix  9)  shows  all  costs  and  benefits  in  domestic  2009 \nconstant  values,  with  all  estimated  taxes  and  duties  excluded.  The  value  of  electricity \ngenerated, the major economic benefit from the implementation of the JVC business plan, will \nbe fully absorbed at present levels of electricity demand in the identified states, all of which face \npower shortages. The energy and power shortages of the past decade were mainly due to the \nsignificant  lag  in  capacity  additions  behind  demand  growth.  Hence,  the  electricity  to  be \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\ngenerated by the JVC will answer unmet demand, i.e., it will not be a substitute for power from \nexisting  generation  capacity.  The  entire  output  from  the  JVC  will  be  incremental  and  will \nincrease  the  supply  of  clean  energy.  Although  the  projects  are  not  registered  for  CERs,  the \ninvestments  will  lead  to  reductions  in  GHG  emissions,  a  global  environmental  benefit.  The \neconomic  analysis  incorporates  the  value  of  this  benefit,  using  a  reasonable  international \nmarket price for CERs.  \n \n60. \nThe base-case economic internal rate of return for the JVC that will develop and operate \n500  MW  of  renewable  energy  capacity  is  21.1%,  above  the  social  discount  rate  of  12%. \nSensitivity  testing  against  four  adverse  scenarios  demonstrates  that  the  investment  is \neconomically robust and viable. \n\nE. \n\nJustification \n\ninnovative  business  and \n\n64. \nThe investment is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 (footnote 19) and Clean Energy and \nEnvironment Program, which calls for ADB to invest up to $1 billion per year in energy efficiency \nand renewable energy in Asia and to sustain that level of investment.24 Significant additions will \nbe  made  in  India\u2019s  generation  capacity  for  thermal  power  to  help  meet  the  country\u2019s  rapid \ngrowth  in  electricity  demand.  Total  GHG  emissions  will,  however,  also  increase  as  a  result. \nADB\u2019s investment in the JVC will enable India to reduce emission intensity in the power sector \nand to bring down incremental increases in GHG emissions by 1.1 million tons of CO2 per year, \nwhile pursuing its poverty reduction strategies and economic development. \n \nThe proposed investment is consistent with the CSP update (2006\u20132008) and with the \n65. \n2009\u20132012  country  partnership  strategy,  now  being  prepared,  to  sustain  ADB\u2019s  support  for \ninclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth  in  India  (footnote  17).  It  affirms  the  strategic \npillars  of  (i)  supporting  the  development  of  a  low-carbon  infrastructure,  particularly  in \nhydropower and other forms of renewable energy; and (ii) catalyzing investment through the use \nof \nfinancing  modalities  such  as  public-private  partnerships, \nnonsovereign operations, and the carbon credit market. \n \nThe  proposed  investment  will  increase  power  generation  from  renewable  energy \n66. \nsources  in  India,  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  objectives  stated  in  the  Electricity  Act  of  2003 \nand  the  Integrated  Energy  Policy.  India  has  been  trying  to  reduce  its  dependence  on \nprice-sensitive fossil fuels and to develop renewable energy sources, which are abundant and \nmostly underused, for energy security and environmentally sustainable economic development. \nOutflows of foreign exchange for imports of fossil fuels, such as coal from Indonesia, Australia, \nand South Africa, will also be reduced. \n \nThe proposed JVC will attract private foreign investors who were previously reluctant to \n67. \ninvest  directly  in  the  renewable  energy  sector  because  of  the  perceived  risks  and  the \ndominance  of  local  firms.  Private  investment  has  been  project  by  project  at  best.  Domestic \ninvestment in wind power was initially encouraging, but most of it was undertaken purely for the \naccelerated-depreciation benefits, or by captive power supply or distribution utilities seeking to \ncomply with renewable energy purchase obligations. The proposed joint venture introduces the \nindependent utility model for renewables, which will help bring down the overall cost of funding \n(and hence the average cost of generation) and prove that this business concept is viable and \n\n                                                 \n24  The  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  as  described  and  endorsed  in  ADB.  2007.

This  proof  of  concept  may  change  risk  perceptions  and  attract  other  foreign \ninvestors to the renewable sector in India. \n\nF. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Policy of Combating Money Laundering and the \nFinancing of Terrorism \n\n69. \nThe investors were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism \n(2003).  Consistent  with its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB will require the JVC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best-practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation among ADB, the other shareholders, \nand  the  JVC  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these \nundertaking. \n\nVI. \n\nINVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n\nThe  proposed  financing  will  be  within  approved  country,  industry,  project,  and  group \n\n70. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign operations.  \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nthe  Agreement  Establishing \n\nNo-Objection  Letter.  Consistent  with \n\n71. \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank, the Government of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection \nto  the  proposed  assistance  to  the  JVC.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such \nconfirmation. \n \n72. \nDocumentation. Following the approval of the proposed investment by the ADB Board \nof Directors, ADB will enter into suitable investment documentation. The documentation will be \non terms and conditions consistent with this document, acceptable to ADB, and consistent with \nall relevant ADB policies. \n\nVIII.

With the recent volatility in oil and gas prices, and the expected shortage of fossil \nfuels  in  the  future,  there  has  been  increasing  concern  about  the  security  of  India\u2019s  energy \nsupply,  as  well  as  the  environmental  effects  of  excessive  use  of  fossil  fuels.  India  therefore \nurgently  needs  to  explore  sustainable  energy  development,  and  the  Government  has  been \nworking proactively to promote the use of renewable energy. \n \n11. \nAmong the renewable power resources available in India, wind energy shows promise. \nIndia  has  45,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  gross  potential  if  1%  of  land  in  the  potential  areas  is \nassumed  to  be  available  for  wind-power  generation.  Sites  with  annual  mean  wind  density \nexceeding  200  watts  per  square  meter  are  considered  suitable  for  wind  power  projects.  The \nCenter for Wind Energy Technology (C-WET) identified 216 such sites in India. The states with \nthe most sites are Tamil Nadu (41), Gujarat (38), Andhra Pradesh (32), Maharashtra (31), and \nKarnataka (26). India\u2019s technical potential is only about 13,000 MW with 20% grid penetration, \nbut  this  figure  should  rise  as  grid  capacity  in  the  potential  states  increases.  As  of \nDecember 2007, India had installed wind power capacity of over 7,800 MW and ranked fourth in \nthe world in this regard, after Germany, Spain, and the United States. A 2,200 MW increase in \ninstalled wind power capacity was targeted in the 10th Five Year Plan; over 5,500 MW has been \ninstalled.25 The installed wind power capacity and gross potential in India, by state, is shown in \nTable A2.1. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Installed Wind Power Capacity and Potential in India, by State \n(MW) \n\nState \nAndhra Pradesh \nGujarat \nKarnataka \nKerala \nMadhya Pradesh \nMaharashtra \nRajasthan \nTamil Nadu \nWest Bengal \nOthers \n\nTotal \n\nAs of \n31 March 2005 \n120.5 \n253.5 \n410.8 \n2.0 \n28.9 \n456.2 \n284.8 \n2,034.9 \n1.1 \n1.6 \n3,594.3 \n\nAs of \n31 March 2006 \n121.0 \n338.1 \n584.6 \n2.0 \n40.3 \n1,001.3 \n358.1 \n2,892.5 \n1.1 \n1.6 \n5,340.6 \n\nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \n \n\nAs of \n31 December 2007 \n\n122.5 \n874.8 \n917.2 \n2.0 \n70.3 \n1,646.3 \n495.7 \n3,711.6 \n1.6 \n2.7 \n7,844.5 \n\nGross Potential  \n8,275 \n9,675 \n6,620 \n875 \n5,500 \n3,650 \n1,700 \n5,400 \n3,050 \n450 \n45,195 \n\n12.  While  the  joint  venture  company  (JVC)  has  no  geographic  restrictions,  it  has  targeted \ncertain states on the basis of a market assessment and discussions with investors. The states \ntargeted  for  new  wind-turbine  installation  are  Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Rajasthan,  and \nMadhya Pradesh.  All  are  leading  states  in  wind  resource  availability  (gross  potential  is \n6,620 MW in Karnataka, 3,650 MW in Maharashtra, 1,700 MW in Rajasthan, and 5,500 MW in \nMadhya  Pradesh)  and  in  wind  generation  capacity  (Karnataka  has  917  MW  of  installations, \nMaharashtra  1,646  MW,  Rajasthan  496  MW,  and  Madhya  Pradesh  70  MW).  Wind  power \npotential  is  already  well  developed  in  Tamil  Nadu,  with  5,400  MW  available  and  3,712 MW \n\n                                                 \n25 Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. 2008.

But  since  the  state  is  in  an  advanced  state  of  development,  many  installed  turbines \nare  older,  and  thus  less  efficient  and  undersized.  Some  existing  sites  can  be  retrofitted  with \nnewer and larger turbines. All of the targeted states actively promote wind power generation and \nhave declared 20-year fixed feed-in tariffs.  \n\nB. \n\nRegulatory Framework for Wind Power in India \n\n(iv) \n\nresearch  and  development, \n\n13. \nThe  Government  is  proactively  encouraging  the  development  of  renewable  energy \nsources.  It  started  promoting  renewable  energy  in  the  early  1980s,  after  the  first  and  second \nglobal oil price shocks. The Commission for Additional Sources of Energy was created in 1981, \nand  the  Department  of  Non-Conventional  Energy  Sources  in  1982.  The  latter  became  the \nMinistry  of  Non-Conventional  Energy  Sources  (MNES)  in  1992,  and  then  was  renamed  the \nMinistry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy  (MNRE)  in  2006.  The  development  of  renewable \nenergy sources is a major goal of the National Electricity Policy, issued by the Ministry of Power \nin  2005.  MNRE  is  the  nodal  ministry  for  all  matters  relating  to  new  and  renewable  energy.  Its \nmain functions are (i) policy making and planning, (ii) program formulation and implementation, \ntechnology  development  and  commercialization, \n(iii) \n(v) promotion of demonstration and pilot projects, and (vi) implementation of fiscal and financial \nincentives. \n \n14.  MNES  (now  MNRE)  established  C-WET  at  Chennai  as  an  autonomous  research  and \ndevelopment institution of the Government and as a technical focal point for India\u2019s wind power \ndevelopment.  The  center  provides  developers  with  technical  services, including  wind  resource \nassessment  for  project  sites,  testing  and  certification  services  for  equipment,  and  training  and \ncapacity-building services. \n \n15. \nTechnological  advances  are  gradually  producing  more  commercially  viable  wind  power \nprojects. Wind power has become a more attractive investment with the replacement of the old \n250-kilowatt wind turbines 30 meters (m) high with 1\u20132 MW units 50\u201380 m high. Greater wind \npower  density  due  to  the  increased  height,  lower  installation  cost  per  MW,  and  reduced  land \nrequirement  make  a  good  case  for  choosing  a  larger  unit  size  of  wind  turbines.  India\u2019s \nadvantage is that it manufactures wind turbines 1 MW and above. \n \n16. \nFiscal and financial incentives from the national and state governments have traditionally \ndriven  the  development  of  wind  power  projects  in  India.  The  incentives  provided  by  the \nGovernment  include  (i)  80%  accelerated  depreciation  of  project  costs;  (ii)  concessions  or  full \nexemption  from  customs  duties  on  certain  imported  components  of  wind  turbines;  (iii)  tax \nholiday for up to 10 consecutive years within 15 years of commissioning; and (iv) concessional \nloans \nIndian  Renewable  Energy \nDevelopment Agency, the Power Finance Corporation, and the Rural Electrification Corporation.  \n \n17. \nRecently,  the  focus  of  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  renewable  energy  sector  has \nshifted from being supply-driven to being demand-driven. The Electricity Act of 2003 requires all \nstate  energy  regulatory  commissions  to  ensure  that  electricity  distributors  procure  a  specified \nminimum  percentage  of  power  generation  from  renewable  energy  sources. 26 In  its  midterm \n\nthrough  government-owned  agencies, \n\nincluding \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n26 Section  86  of  the  Electricity  Act  of  2003  states:  \u201cThe  State  Commission  shall  discharge  the  following  functions, \nnamely:\u2026(e)  promote  cogeneration  and  generation  of  electricity  from  renewable  sources  of  energy  by  providing \nsuitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase \nof  electricity  from  such  sources,  a  percentage  of  the  total  consumption  of  electricity  in  the  area  of  a  distribution \nlicense;\u2026\u201d \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n19  \n\nappraisal of the 10th Five Year Plan, the Planning Commission (footnote 1) made the following \nrecommendations regarding the renewable energy sector: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nswitch  incentives  and  support  from  supply-driven  programs  to  demand-driven \nprograms and technologies; \nexplore alternative subsidy structures that encourage utilities to use wind, small \nhydroelectric, cogeneration, and other nontraditional energy sources; \nphase out capital subsidies linked to the creation of renewable capacity in favor \nof subsidies linked to renewable energy generated; \nrequire  electricity  distributors, \nregulatory \nthrough \ncommissions,  to  purchase  energy  from  renewable  sources,  as  provided  in  the \nElectricity Act; and \nimprove coordination and synergy between the programs of MNES (now MNRE) \nand similar programs of other central ministries and state governments. \n\nthe  state  electricity \n\nC. \n\nWind Power in Target States \n\n18. \nThe  target  states  of  Karnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  Rajasthan,  and \nTamil Nadu are among India\u2019s leading states in wind energy generation, with a gross potential \nof about 22,870 MW. As of 31 December 2007, these states had an installed wind generation \ncapacity of 6,841 MW. Their potential for further wind generation is therefore significant. \n \n19. \nEach of the target states has passed regulations to encourage wind power generation. In \naccordance with the tariff policies of the Government, the states have issued renewable energy \npurchase  obligations  requiring  distribution  licensees  to  purchase  a  minimum  quantity  of  total \nelectricity consumption from renewable sources (Table A2.2). \n \nEach of the target states has declared power purchase agreement (PPA) conditions and \n20. \napproved  standard  PPAs  to  be  executed  between  the  generator  and  the  distribution  licensee \naccording  to  the  terms  indicated  in  Table  A2.2.

This  consists  of  hydroelectric  generation  stations  with  a \ncapacity  of  up  to  25 megawatts  (MW),  typically  run-of-river  or  small  pondage  installations  with \nminimal inundation zones for storage or none. India ranks fifth in the world in usable potential, \ndistributed across six major river systems\u2014the Indus, the Brahmaputra, the Ganga, the central \nIndian  river  systems,  and  the  east-  and  west-flowing  river  systems  of  south  India. 1  The \neconomically  exploitable  potential  from  these  river  systems  has  been  assessed  at  just  over \n84,000  MW  in  delivered  capacity,  accounting  for  load  factor,  topographic  features,  and \nwatershed hydrology. So far only 32,325 MW has been established. Included in the assessment \nis  nearly  10,000  MW  in  small  hydroelectric  power  development  potential  distributed  over \n4,000 sites with an estimated unidentified potential of an additional 5,000 MW. \n \nThe  hydroelectric  power  sector  was  opened  to  private  sector  participation  in  1991,  but \n2. \nonly  about  910  MW,  or  less  than  3%  of  the  total  installed  hydropower  capacity,  has  been \ncommissioned  so  far.  The  hydro-rich  states  of  Himachal  Pradesh,  Sikkim,  and  Uttarakhand \nhave adopted several measures in recent years to promote the balanced growth of public and \nprivate  sector  projects.  They  are  the  initial  target  development  states  of  the  joint  venture \ncompany  (JVC).  These  states  have  an  estimated  potential  capacity  of  just  over  3,450 MW, \ndistributed  among  874  remaining  sites. 2  Table  A3.1  shows  the  installed  small  hydropower \ncapacity and gross potential in the three target states. \n \n\nTable A3.1: Installed Small Hydropower Capacity and Potential \nin Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and Uttarakhand \n \nCapacity under \nDevelopment \n(MW) \n71.8 \n13.2 \n584.6 \n669.6 \n\nGross Potential \nCapacity \n(MW) \n2,268.4 \n265.5 \n917.2 \n3,451.1 \n\nInstalled \nCapacity \n(MW) \n146.6 \n39.1 \n410.8 \n596.5 \n\nState \nHimachal Pradesh \nSikkim \nUttarakhand \nTotal \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \n\nNumber of Sites \nRemaining \n\n469 \n73 \n332 \n874 \n\nB. \n\nRegulatory Framework for Small Hydropower in India \n\nThe  Government  is  proactively  encouraging  the  development  of  renewable  energy \n3. \nsources.  Its  efforts  to  promote  renewable  energy  started  in  the  early  1980s  after  the  first  and \nsecond global oil price shocks. The Commission for Additional Sources of Energy was created \nin 1981 and the Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources in 1982. The Department of \nNon-Conventional  Energy  Sources  became  the  Ministry  of  Non-Conventional  Energy  Sources \n(MNES) in 1992, and then was renamed the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in \n2006. The development of renewable energy sources is a major goal of the National Electricity \nPolicy,  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Power  in  2005.  MNRE  is  the  nodal  ministry  for  all  matters \n\n                                                 \n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2007. Hydropower Development in India: A Sector Assessment.

Its  main  functions  are  (i)  policymaking  and  planning, \n(ii) program  formulation  and  implementation,  (iii)  research  and  development,  (iv)  technology \ndevelopment  and  commercialization,  (v)  promotion  of  demonstration  and  pilot  projects,  and \n(vi) implementation of fiscal and financial incentives. \n \n4. \nRecently,  the  focus  of  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  renewable  energy  sector  has \nshifted from being supply-driven to being demand-driven. The Electricity Act of 2003 requires all \nstate  energy  regulatory  commissions  to  ensure  that  electricity  distributors  procure  a  specified \nminimum  percentage  of  power  generation  from  renewable  energy  sources. 3  In  its  midterm \nappraisal of the 10th Five Year Plan, the Planning Commission (footnote 1) made the following \nrecommendations regarding the renewable energy sector: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nswitch  incentives  and  support  from  supply-driven  programs  to  demand-driven \nprograms and technologies; \nexplore alternative subsidy structures that encourage utilities to use wind, small \nhydroelectric, cogeneration, and other nontraditional energy sources; \nphase out capital subsidies linked to the creation of renewable capacity in favor \nof subsidies linked to renewable energy generated; \nrequire  electricity  distributors, \nregulatory \nthrough \ncommissions,  to  purchase  energy  from  renewable  sources,  as  provided  in  the \nElectricity Act; and \nimprove coordination and synergy between the programs of MNES (now MNRE) \nand similar programs of other central ministries and state governments. \n\nthe  state  electricity \n\n \nThe  National  Tariff  Policy  2005  requires  distribution  companies  to  procure  their  future \n5. \nhydropower requirements from the generation companies through competitive bidding. Central \nand state public utilities have a 5-year window within which to implement the bidding framework. \nThe terms and conditions laid down by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) \nfor  tariff  setting  include  0.2%\u20130.7%  auxiliary  energy  consumption,  based  on  generator \nconfiguration, and recovery of full capacity charges based on the capacity indexes indicated in \nTable A3.2. \n \n\nTable A3.2: Norms of Operation for Recovery of Capacity Charges \n(%) \nCapacity Index in \nYear 1 of \nCommercial \nOperation \n85 \n\nCapacity Index \nafter Year 1 of \nCommercial \nOperation  \n90 \n\n80 \n\n85 \n\nPower Station Type \nPurely run-of-river \nStorage-type or run-of-river \n     with pondage           \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n6. \nCERC has set the debt-equity ratio as of the start of commercial operation at 70:30 for \ntariff  setting.  A  developer  may  contribute  additional  equity,  but  the  amount  for  tariff  setting  is \n\n                                                 \n3   Section  86  of  the  Electricity  Act  of  2003  states:  \u201cThe  State  Commission  shall  discharge  the  following  functions, \nnamely:\u2026(e)  promote  cogeneration  and  generation  of  electricity  from  renewable  sources  of  energy  by  providing \nsuitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase \nof  electricity  from  such  sources,  a  percentage  of  the  total  consumption  of  electricity  in  the  area  of  a  distribution \nlicense;\u2026\u201d \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\ncapped at 30% and the balance is considered as quasi-equity debt. For structures at less than \n30% equity, the tariff may be determined at the actual debt and equity. \n \n7. \nThe  tariff  is  a  two-part  structure,  comprising  recovery  of  annual  capacity  charges  and \nprimary  energy  charges.  Project  capital  is  recovered  through  the  annual  capacity  charge,  and \nvariable  costs  through  the  energy  charges.  The  rate  of  primary  energy  charge  is  equal  to  the \nlowest  variable  charge  of  the  central  sector  thermal  power  station  in  the  region.  Generation \nperformance  incentives  are  payable  when  the  capacity  index4 exceeds  the  values  indicated  in \nTable  A3.2,  accrued  up  to  a  maximum  of  100%.  Additionally,  an  incentive  for  early \ncommissioning  is  payable  for  an  amount  of  pro  rata  reduction  in  interest  during  construction \nrecovered through the tariff in 12 equal monthly installments for the first 12 months of operation. \n \nDespite this regulatory framework and progress made in the sector, the development of \n8. \nsmall  hydropower  projects  has  been  impeded  by  various  factors.  Barriers  specific  to  private \nsector small hydropower development include (i) long project gestation periods, (ii) high capital \ncosts,  (iii)  statutory  clearances,  (iv)  geologic  uncertainties,  (v)  land  acquisition  difficulties,  and \n(vi) resettlement  and  rehabilitation  problems  (in  some  cases).  In  addition,  the  absence  of  a \nstreamlined single-window clearance system can delay the approval process and be a setback \nfor  organizations  not  familiar  with  the  process.  To  assist  developers  in  overcoming  these \nbarriers,  MNRE  provides  financial  and  technical  support  to  state  hydropower  development \ninitiatives.  Three  states  in  particular  have  adopted  initiatives  to  promote  the  growth  of  private \nsector projects, as discussed below.5 \n \n9. \nHimachal Pradesh. The key features of the state\u2019s policy are (i) developers are selected \nthrough  the  memorandum  of  understanding  route  for  projects  of  up  to  100  MW;  (ii)  no  CEA \nclearances are required for projects of up to Rs25 billion, selected through competitive bidding; \n(iii) a premium is paid on peak power; and (iv) 100% foreign equity is permitted on the automatic \napproval  route  for  projects  of  up  to  Rs15 billion.  Through  a  multitranche  financing  facility  to \nHimachal Pradesh Power Corporation, ADB is supporting four hydroelectric power projects (111 \nMW, 195 MW, 100 MW, and 402 MW). \n \n10. \nSikkim.  The  Sikkim  Power  Development  Corporation  Limited  (SPDCL)  facilitates  joint \nventure  projects  between  private  power  developers  and  the  Government.  SPDCL-sponsored \nprojects have the following key features: (i) 12% free power is made available to the state, (ii) \nthe  project  may  sell  the  balance  directly  to  states  or  power  trading  agencies  on  a  merchant \nbasis, and (iii) the Government has equity participation of 10%\u201349%. \n \nUttarakhand. The key features of the state\u2019s policy for private sector development  are \n11. \nas follows: (i) potential projects are advertised for international competitive bidding, (ii) projects \nare  awarded  on  the  basis  of  the  highest  bid  over  the  up-front  minimum  premium, \ncontracts, \n(iii) concessions  are  granted \n(iv) developers may sell the power outside the state, and (v) up to 12% of the power generated \ncan  be  captured  by  the  state\u2019s  free  power  program.  Through  a  multitranche  financing  facility, \nADB  is  funding  four  small  hydropower  projects  in  Uttarakhand  (10  MW  Madhyamaheshwar, \n4 MW Kaliganga-I, 6 MW Kaliganga-II, and 9 MW Kaldigad). \n\nthrough  45-year  build-own-operate-transfer \n\n                                                 \n4   Capacity  index\u2014the  ratio  of  declared  capacity  to  the  maximum  available  capacity\u2014has  been  adopted  by  the \nCentral  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  as  a  standard  parameter  for  hydropower  in  lieu  of  plant  load  factor. \nCapacity  index  is  essentially  a  declaration  of  machine  availability  independent  of  water  availability;  therefore, \nhydrological risk is passed on directly to beneficiaries. \n\n5   ADB. 2007.

NTPC  is  India\u2019s  largest  producer  of  thermal  power. 1  Although  the \nGovernment is the majority owner, NTPC is considered a navratna company, that is, it operates \nunder  the  Companies  Act  like  a  private  company  and  its  management  can  make  operating \ndecisions  without  interference  from  the  Government.  As  of  31 December  2008,  the  total \ninstalled capacity of NTPC was 29,894 megawatts (MW), through 15 coal-fired power stations \n(23,895  MW),  seven  gas-fired  power  stations  (3,955  MW),  and  three  joint  venture  projects \n(2,044 MW). NTPC had a 19.6% share of the total installed capacity in India as of that date, and \nit contributed 27.1% of total power generation in the country in FY2005. \n \n2. \nNTPC  is  expanding  its  business  into  hydroelectric  power  generation,  coal  mining,  gas \nexploration, and the liquefied natural gas value chain, to supplement and support its core power \ngeneration activities. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, NTPC proposes to implement and \noperate  small  to  medium-sized  hydroelectric  power  plants  and  engage  in  power  trading  and \ndistribution. It is also involved in several joint ventures, including one with Alstom, Germany, for \nthe  renovation  and  modernization  of  third-party  power  plants  in  India  and  other  member \ncountries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nAssets and Operations \n\n3. \nNTPC  has  a  current  installed  capacity  of  29,894  MW.  It  plans  to  become  a  generation \ncompany  with  power  generation  of  more  than  46,000  MW  by  the  end  of  the  11th  Plan  period \n(end  of  2012)  and  more  than  66,000  MW  by  the  end  of  the  12th  Plan  period  (end  of  2017). \nNTPC  is  adopting  a  multipronged  growth  strategy  for  capacity  addition  through  greenfield \nprojects,  expansion  of  existing  stations,  acquisitions  and  takeovers,  and  joint  ventures  and \nsubsidiaries. Aside from the 4,000 MW already commissioned during the 10th Plan period and \n8,970  MW  under  implementation  during  the  10th  and  11th  plan  periods,  the  new  generation \nprojects  identified  for  implementation  include  both  greenfield  projects  and  the  expansion  of \nexisting power plants.  \n \nThe  engineering,  construction,  and  operation  of  power  plants  for  thermal  power \n4. \ngeneration  is  the  core  business  of  NTPC.  Sales  of  energy  accounted  for  93%  of  its  operating \nincome in FY2008. NTPC\u2019s facilities are located throughout India, but mostly in the central and \neastern  states.  The  company  is  also  looking  to  invest  in  power  generation  facilities  in \nneighboring countries like Sri Lanka. \n\n                                                 \n1   Ministry of Power. 2005.

The \ndividend  paid  for  FY2007  was  Rs28,859  million,  or  38.9%  of  profits  after  tax,  not  far  different \nfrom  the  Rs26,385  million  paid  for  the  previous  fiscal  year.  NTPC\u2019s  dividend  target  is  30%  of \nprofit  after  tax,  but  NTPC  is  allowed  to  use  its  internal  resources  to  fund  capacity  expansion. \nDividends  are  declared  and  paid  at  the  board\u2019s  recommendation  and  with  the  approval  of  the \nshareholders. \n \n6. \nThe  increase  in  the  availability  factor  for  coal  stations,  from  85.03%  in  FY1997  to  92.12%  in   \nFY2007, compares favorably with international standards. The plant load factor increased from \n75.2% in FY1997 to 92.24% in FY2007, its highest level since the start.

GE EFS  is \nheadquartered in Connecticut, USA, and will interface with the JVC from its office in Gurgaon, \nIndia, from which it operates its global growth business unit.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nAssets and Operations \n\n22. \nProjects  supported  by  GE  EFS  generate  a  total  of  26  gigawatts  and  the  company  has \ninvested  in  more  than  30,000  miles  of  natural  gas  pipelines.  Considerable  equity  investments \nand  loan  products  have  put  over  $4  billion  into  wind,  solar,  biomass,  hydroelectric  power, \ngeothermal,  and  other  renewable  power  projects.  In  emerging  markets,  the  core  business  of \nGE EFS is in power, water, gas, and renewables. Outside North America, it has invested more \nthan $1.6 billion in 24 projects, including projects in India, and plans to increase the investment \ntotal  to  $5  billion  by  2010.  It  has  recently  taken  equity  positions  in  a  power  and  water  project \nholding  company  in  Turkey  and  a  captive  power  developer  in  India,  and  is  establishing  a \nrenewable energy trust in Singapore to pursue renewable opportunities in Southeast Asia. The \nparent company, GE Energy, has supplied over 10,000 wind-turbine installations worldwide with \nmore  than  15,000 MW  of  capacity  in  over  20  years.  Its  product  and  service  portfolio  includes \nwind  turbines  with  rated  capacities  of  up  to  3.6  MW  and  support  services  ranging  from \ndevelopment assistance to operation and maintenance. \n\n5. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nGE EFS is a wholly owned subsidiary of GE under its capital finance operating segment \n23. \nand  therefore  does  not  publish  financial  statements  aside  from  GE's  consolidated  statements. \nTotal  revenue  and  profit  after  tax  are  indicated  specifically  for  GE  EFS  (Table  A4.3)  and  the \ncompany enjoys access to the capital markets under GE\u2019s AA+ credit rating. \n \n\nTable A4.3: Summary Financial Key Indicators for GE Energy Financial Services  \n($ million) \n\nPerformance Indicator \nTotal revenue \n\nProfit after tax \n\nFY2006 \n1,664 \n\n648 \n\nSource: GE 2008.

As  an \nanchor  investor,  it  has  launched  the  Renewable  Energy  Trust  Asia  to  build  a  portfolio  of \n200 MW  in  renewable  energy  projects  in  Southeast  Asia.  GE  has  a  long  track  record  of \ninvesting in wind, solar, biomass, hydro, and geothermal power assets. In addition to renewable \npower assets, GE\u2019s renewables finance experts are examining growth opportunities in biofuels, \ngreenhouse-gas offsets, energy efficiency, and many other sectors. \n \n25. \nGE  EFS  has  equity  positions  in  over  30  wind  farms  totaling  more  than  2,000  MW, \nincluding  a  $51  million  equity  investment  in  the  Kumeyaay  wind  farm,  which  was  the  largest \nwind  farm  in  India  in  2005.  The  equity  investments  have  demonstrated  a  transparent \ncommercial approach, as evidenced by the selection of seven turbine vendors, six of them from \noutside GE, to supply more than 50% of the turbines. \n\n \n\n\f \n28 \n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nA. \n\nGuiding Principles \n\nDRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FRAMEWORK \n\nAfter incorporation, the joint venture company (JVC) will formulate a corporate policy for \n1. \nenvironmental and social management and establish an environmental and social management \nsystem  (ESMS)  consistent  with  the  safeguard  policy  principles  and  requirements  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The guiding principles are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ncompliance  by  the  JVC  with  ADB\u2019s  applicable  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  policies, 1  and  the  environmental  and  social  laws  and  policies  (on \nlabor,2 land acquisition, and resettlement) of India; \n\nintegration  of  an  assessment  of  compliance  with  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards in the due diligence and risk assessment by the JVC; \n\nestablishment  of  a  process  or  system  for  screening,  categorization  and \nclassification, and assessment, to identify and monitor the adverse environmental \nand social impact of the JVC\u2019s projects; \n\nidentification  of  appropriate  mitigation  and  compensation  measures  to  minimize \nadverse \ninternational  best  practices  and  applicable \nin \nenvironmental and social safeguards; \n\nline  with \n\nimpact \n\npublic  disclosure  of  information  about  the  projects\u2019  environmental  and  social \nimpact;  \n\npromotion  of  compliance  by  the  investee  with  applicable  environmental  and \nsocial  safeguards,  including  India\u2019s  resettlement  laws  and  standards,  through \nappropriate  documentation  of  environmental  and  social \nimpact  studies, \napprovals, and site visits as appropriate; \n\n(vii)  where  applicable,  in  case  of  breach  of  the  environmental  and  social  policy \nrequirements  of  ADB,  or  the  laws  and  standards  of  the  Government  of  India, \nprompt collaboration in the preparation of an action plan; and  \n\n(viii) \n\nappropriate staffing of the JVC to enable it to implement the ESMS. \n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Management System \n\n2. \nThe  JVC  will  establish  and  adopt  an  ESMS  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and \nsocial  safeguard  policies.  The  ESMS  will  comprise  (i)  the  environmental  and  social  safeguard \npolicy, signed by senior management; (ii) environmental management capability; (iii) procedures \nfor the environmental assessment and review of subprojects; and (iv) environmental monitoring \nand reporting procedures.  \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB has three safeguard policies: the Environment Policy (2002), the  Policy  on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and \n\nthe Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). ADB investees are legally obligated to comply with these policies. \n\n2  In addition to the three policies mentioned in footnote 1, ADB has a Social Protection Strategy, which recommends \nbest practices with regard to labor markets, social insurance, social assistance, micro- and area-based schemes, \nand  child  protection.  Although  compliance  with  the  Social  Protection  Strategy  is  not  a  legal  requirement,  it  is  a \ndesirable  extension  of  the  JVC\u2019s  approach  to  environmental  and  social  protection.  Additional  guidance  on  the \nSocial Protection Strategy is available at http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n29  \n \n\n1.  \n\nEnvironmental and Social Management System Policy \n\n3. \nAs  part  of  the  process  of  establishing  an  ESMS,  the  JVC  will  prepare  and  adopt  an \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  policy  statement  signed  by  its  senior  management,  which \nstipulates, among other things, that  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthe  JVC\u2019s  projects  should  be  consistent  with  its  policies  on  the  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples and scheduled tribes,3 as well \nas other social and disclosure policy requirements;  \n\nthe  JVC  should  actively  observe  all  applicable  environmental  and  social \nrequirements  of  the  national  and  local  governments  of  India,  particularly  those \nresettlement,  and \ngoverning \nindigenous peoples;  \n\nland  acquisition,  compensation, \n\ninvoluntary \n\nthe  JVC  should  also  follow  internationally  recognized  labor  practices  consistent \nwith national labor laws and regulations; and  \n\nif \nthe  JVC  contravenes  applicable  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nrequirements, ADB will take action to understand the reasons for noncompliance \nand will discuss corrective actions acceptable to the relevant authorities.  \n\nWherever the relevant projects of the JVC involve involuntary resettlement4 impact, the \n4. \nJVC  will  satisfy  itself  that  it  has  (i)  avoided  involuntary  resettlement  wherever  feasible; \n(ii) minimized resettlement where population displacement is unavoidable; and (iii) ensured that \naffected persons5 have been compensated and assisted through replacement of land, housing, \ninfrastructure,  resources,  income  sources,  and  services,  in  cash  or  in  kind,  so  that  their \neconomic  and  social  circumstances  will  be  at  least  restored  to  the  pre-project  level.  All \ncompensation will be based on the principle of replacement cost.  \n\n5. \nWherever the projects of the JVC affect indigenous peoples or scheduled tribes, the JVC \nwill  satisfy  itself  that  it  has  (i)  avoided  negative  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  or  scheduled \ntribes,  where  possible;  (ii)  provided  adequate  and  appropriate  compensation  where  negative \nimpact  is  unavoidable;  and  (iii)  ensured  that  development  initiatives  affecting  indigenous \npeoples are effective and sustainable, and are compatible in substance and structure with their \ncultures and social and economic institutions, and commensurate with their needs, aspirations, \nand demands. \n\n                                                 \n3  Scheduled tribes or indigenous people are those with a social or cultural identity distinct from that of the dominant \n\nor mainstream society, making them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the process of development. \n\n4   ADB  defines  \u201cinvoluntary  resettlement\u201d  as  social  and  economic  impact  that  is  permanent  or  temporary  and  is \ncaused  by  (i)  the  acquisition  of  land  and  other  fixed  assets,  (ii)  a  change  in  the  use  of  land,  or  (iii)  restrictions \nimposed on land as a result of an ADB operation. \n\n5   The  term  \u201caffected  person\u201d  includes  any  people,  households,  firms,  or  private  institutions  that,  on  account  of \nchanges resulting from the project, will have their (i) standard of living adversely affected; (ii) right, title, or interest \nin  any  house,  land  (residential,  commercial,  agricultural,  forest,  or  grazing  land),  water  resources,  or  any  other \nmovable  or  fixed  assets  acquired,  possessed,  restricted,  or  otherwise  adversely  affected,  in  full  or  in  part, \npermanently or temporarily; or (iii) business, occupation, place of work or residence, or habitat adversely affected, \nwith or without displacement. \n\n \n\n\f \n30 \n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Management System Procedures \n\n6. \nScreening.  Before  making  any  specific  investment,  the JVC  will  verify  to  ADB  that  the \nproposed project is not on ADB\u2019s list of prohibited investments. The JVC will undertake an initial \nassessment of whether the project, in its reasonable opinion, has the potential to have adverse \nenvironmental  or  social  impact  or  may  involve  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement,  or \naffect indigenous peoples or scheduled tribes. These issues will continue to be assessed during \ndue  diligence,  to  ensure  that  the  project  complies  with  the  environmental  and  social \nrequirements  of  India.  The  JVC  will  develop  and  implement  a  rigorous  screening  system  to \nassess whether the proposed projects have adequately addressed the environmental and social \nsafeguards.  \n\nProjects  are  categorized  according  to  the  significance  of  their  impact  on  the \n7. \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The significance of the impact \nis measured by its type, location, scale, nature, and magnitude. ADB has several categories of \nprojects, depending on their environmental and social impact, as follows.  \n\na. \n\nEnvironmental  \n\n8. \nCategory  A.  Category  A  projects  are  those  with  anticipated  significant  adverse  impact \non  the  environment.  In  this  category  are  the  following  types  of  projects:  thermal  power  and \nhydropower  plants;  irrigation  systems;  roads,  bridges,  tunnels,  railways,  and  airports;  forestry; \nfarming; general construction; waste processing and disposal facilities (landfill, transfer station, \nand incineration); mining, oil extraction, and refinery; iron, steel, and metal production; chemical \nplant  installation;  skin  and  hide  processing,  and  tanneries;  sawdust  processing,  and  pulp  and \npaper  production;  and  establishment  of  artificial  lakes  or  reservoirs.  Category  A  projects  will \nrequire an adequately prepared environmental impact assessment (EIA) with an environmental \nmanagement plan and an environmental monitoring program.  \n\n9. \nCategory  B.  Projects  with  anticipated  insignificant  adverse  impact  on  the  environment \nare in category B.6 Included here are transmission lines and substations; wind power projects; \nrehabilitation of power plants, factories, or roads within the same corridor or footprint; and other \ndevelopments  where  the  anticipated  adverse  impact  is  insignificant.  Category  B  projects  will \nrequire  the  preparation  of  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  with  an  environmental \nmitigation and monitoring program. A project listed (by type) as category B but deemed to be of \nsignificant  anticipated  environmental  impact  can  be  determined  to  be  a  category  A  project  by \nthe JVC.  \n\nCategory  C.  In  this  category  are  projects  with  no  anticipated  adverse  impact  on  the \n\n10. \nenvironment. Category C projects require no impact assessment studies. \n\nb. \n\nSocial \n\nCategory  A.  Projects  where  200  or  more  people  will  experience  major  impact  from \n11. \ninvoluntary  resettlement\u2014physical  displacement  from  housing  or  loss  of  10%  or  more  of  their \nproductive  (income-generating)  assets\u2014are  in  category  A.  A  full  resettlement  plan  is  required \nfor  such  projects.  A  project\u2019s  impact  is  also  considered  significant  if  it  positively  or  negatively \n                                                 \n6   Under  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  a  project  is  classified  as  category  B  if  its  potential  environmental  and \nsocial  impact  is  less  adverse  than  that  of  category  A  projects.  Typically,  the  impact  is  site-specific,  rarely \nirreversible, and can readily be mitigated. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n31  \n \n\n(i) affects indigenous peoples\u2019 or scheduled tribes\u2019 customary rights of use and access to land \nand  natural  resources;  (ii)  changes  indigenous  peoples\u2019  or  scheduled  tribes\u2019  socioeconomic \nstatus;  (iii)  affects  indigenous  peoples\u2019  or  scheduled  tribes\u2019  cultural  and  communal  integrity; \n(iv) affects  indigenous  peoples\u2019  or  scheduled  tribes\u2019  health,  education,  livelihood,  or  social \nsecurity; or (v) alters or undermines the recognition of indigenous knowledge. For projects that \nsignificantly affect indigenous peoples or scheduled tribes, an indigenous peoples development \nplan (IPDP) or a scheduled tribes development plan (STDP) is prepared. \n  \nCategory  B.  Projects  where  fewer  than  200  people  will  experience  major  impact  from \n12. \ninvoluntary  resettlement  are  in  category  B.  These  projects  require  a  short  resettlement  plan. \nProjects that are expected to have limited impact on indigenous peoples and scheduled tribes \nrequire a specific action favorable to indigenous peoples in the project design or in related plans \n(e.g., a resettlement plan).  \n \n13. \nCategory  C.  Projects  in  this  category  are  not  expected  to  have  any  impact  on \nindigenous  peoples  or  to  lead  to  involuntary  resettlement.  Category  C  projects  do  not  require \nany plans to be prepared. \n \n14. \nImpact  Assessment  and  Safeguards  Planning.  If  the  JVC  determines  that  a  project \ncould  have  significant  adverse  environmental  or  social  impact,  or  could  involve  involuntary \nresettlement or affect indigenous people, it will, before providing any financial assistance, \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nconsult  with  and  assist  in  providing  advisory  or  other  services  related  to  the \nsafeguards to the client; and \n\nwhere the project has significant impact on the environment, prepare a feasibility \nstudy  (or  review  the  existing  study),  to  include  an  environmental  and  social \nassessment, which addresses the following key environmental and social issues: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\nenvironmental  and  socioeconomic  impact  of  the  investment,  including \ncareful consideration of gender issues in the conduct of social analysis or \nconsultation  with  women\u2019s  groups  during  preparation,  to  ensure  that \nwomen participate and receive benefits; \n\nrequirements  under  relevant  Indian laws  and  regulations,  and  applicable \ninternational agreements, including but not limited to laws and regulations \ngoverning  land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples; \n\nsustainable development and use of renewable natural resources; \n\nprotection of human health, cultural properties, and biodiversity, including \nendangered species and sensitive ecosystems; \n\nland acquisition and land use; \n\nimpact on indigenous peoples, scheduled tribes, and communities; \n\ncumulative  environmental  and  social  impact  of  existing,  proposed,  and \nanticipated future investments; \n\ndisclosure of impact and mitigation measures to affected parties and the \nparticipation  of  those  parties  in  the  design  and  review  of  mitigation  and \nrehabilitation measures; \n\nconsideration  of  environmentally,  socially,  and  economically  feasible \nalternatives; and \n\n \n\n\f \n32 \n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(j) \n\npollution prevention and waste minimization, pollution (liquid effluents and \nair emissions) control, and solid and chemical waste management.  \n\n15. \nFor  greenfield  development  or  the  rehabilitation  or  expansion  of  existing  facilities,  the \nJVC  will  conduct  screening,  categorization,  and  environmental  due  diligence  to  determine  the \nrequired  level  of  environmental  assessment  for  each  subproject.  During  the  implementation  of \nthe subproject, the JVC will be required to comply with the environmental management plan and \nthe environmental monitoring program indicated in the EIA or IEE. Wherever an EIA is required, \na  summary  EIA  must  be  prepared  and  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  for  a  specific  period  of  time \nbefore ADB may approve the project.7  \n\n16. \nIf  greenfield  development  is  involved,  the  JVC  will  determine  whether  indigenous \npeoples will be affected, and land acquisition and involuntary resettlement may be  involved. If \nthe  JVC  cannot  reasonably  satisfy  itself  that  the  project  complies  with  all  applicable \nenvironmental  and  social  requirements  of  the  Indian  national  and  local  governments,  and  that \nindigenous  peoples  and  scheduled  tribes  will  not  be  affected  and  the  project  will  involve  no \ninvoluntary resettlement, the JVC will  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ndecline to invest in such project; or \nimplement an agreed corrective action plan within a specified period of time; or  \nif  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  or  scheduled  tribes \ncannot  be  avoided,  the  JVC  will  prepare  and  submit  a  resettlement  plan  or  an \nIPDP  or  STDP,  according  to  the  policy  outlined  in  section  3  of  the  SPRSS \n(Appendix 7). The plans must satisfy the JVC that impact on indigenous peoples \nor  scheduled  tribes  will  be  mitigated  and  involuntary  resettlement  will  be \nminimized,  and \nthe  affected  people  will  receive  compensation  at \nreplacement  cost.  During  the  implementation  of  the  investment,  the  JVC  will \nmonitor  the  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  and  IPDPs  or  STDPs,  and \nensure that such plans are made available to the public.  \n\nthat \n\n \n17. \nIf the project involves rehabilitation or expansion of existing facilities, the JVC manager \nwill conduct due diligence to determine if there are any outstanding compensation or involuntary \nresettlement issues, unaddressed adverse impact on ethnic minorities, unresolved grievances, \nor  related  areas  of  reputational  risk  to  the  JVC  and  to  ADB.  If  there  are  any  outstanding \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  issues,  the  JVC  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare \ncorrective measures in the form of a retrofit plan to comply with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policy \nrequirements.  The  retrofit  plan  should  be  disclosed  to  the  affected  persons  and  submitted  to \nADB for review and approval. \n\n18.  Wherever a resettlement plan is required, the affected persons will be fully informed and \nincluding  relocation  sites,  and \nconsulted  on  compensation  and  resettlement  options, \nsocioeconomic  rehabilitation.  Pertinent  resettlement  information 8  will  be  disclosed  to  the \naffected persons at key points, and specific opportunities will be provided for them to participate \nin choosing, planning, and implementing options. The information will be disclosed in a manner \nthat is accessible to the affected people where  there are differing levels of literacy.  Grievance \nredress mechanisms for affected persons, with adequate representation of affected people and \n\n                                                 \n7  This time limit is stipulated in the ADB Operations Manual as 120 days. ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. Section \n\nF1: Environmental Considerations in ADB Operations. Manila (25 September). \n\n8  In  accordance  with  ADB's  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005),  resettlement  information  should  include \nmeasurement  of  losses,  detailed  asset  valuations,  entitlements  and  special  provisions,  grievance  procedures, \ntiming of payments, and displacement schedule. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n33  \n \n\nwith  adequate  multi-gender  presence,  will  be  established  in  each  resettlement  plan.  The  plan \nwill  be  made  available  to  the  affected  persons  in  their  own  language(s),  with  details  on  their \nentitlements, before it is implemented.  \n\n19.  Wherever  an  IPDP  or  STDP  is  required,  adequate  consultations  will  be  held  with \nindigenous  peoples  or  ethnic  minorities  during  its  preparation.  They  will  be  informed  of  the \nmitigation  measures  proposed  and  their  views  will  be  taken  into  account  when  the  plan  is \nfinalized. The IPDP or STDP will be translated into the language of the indigenous peoples or \nethnic minorities and made available to them before implementation. The disclosure will be in a \nmanner accessible to the affected people where there are differing levels of literacy. Indigenous \npeople or ethnic minority institutions and organizations in the affected area will also be involved \nin implementing the IPDP or STDP and in resolving any disputes that arise. \n\n20. \nThe  draft  resettlement  plans,  IPDPs,  and  STDPs  will  be  made  available  to  the  public. \nADB will review and approve the necessary resettlement plans as they are prepared, and, once \nthey  are  finalized,  will  disclose  these  on  its  website  before  implementation.  Plans  may  be \nrevised  after  submission  in  response  to  (i)  requests  for  revision  during  the  review  process,  or \n(ii) changes in design during implementation. Such revised plans will also be made available to \nthe  affected  people,  in  a  form  and  language  they  can  understand,  and  in  English  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite.  \n\n21. \nReporting.  The  JVC  will  report  on  the  environmental  and  social  impact  in  a  manner \ncommensurate with the significance (e.g., semiannual reports in case of significant impact). The \nJVC will prepare and submit to ADB an annual environmental and social performance report9 on \ninvestments made by the JVC, summarizing \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe environmental and social impact of projects undertaken by the JVC, including \nthe  progress  and  performance  of  each  project  under \nits  environmental \nmanagement plan, resettlement plan, and IPDP or STDP; \nany areas of noncompliance or other issues arising from the environmental and \nsocial safeguards, including resettlement (for each individual investment), and a \ndescription of any prospective investments where such policies may be triggered; \nand \nperiodic reviews of the ESMS, with a view to continual improvement. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Management System Capacity \n\nThe ESMS will be established through  \n\n22. \n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\nintegration  of  environmental  and  social  safeguard  aspects  in  the  appraisal, \napproval, and monitoring process; and \nadequate staffing of the JVC with personnel appropriately qualified to undertake \nthe functions associated with the ESMS. \n\n \n23. \nAn appropriate number of qualified staff members of the JVC will be assigned to operate \nthe  ESMS.  The  JVC  will  ensure  that  at  least  one  of  its  senior  representatives  receives \nenvironmental and social safeguard training under a recognized program. \n\n                                                 \n9  A sample report is provided in the full ESMS framework. \n\n \n\n\f \n34 \n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nCountry/Project Title: India: Public\u2013Private Partnership for Renewable Energy Development \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nEquity Investment  \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nPrivate Sector Operations Department \nInfrastructure Finance Division 1 \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n1.  Based  on  the  country  poverty  assessment,  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  the  sector  analysis,  describe  how  the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nThe equity investment will increase the number of renewable energy projects in India and help meet the demand for energy in \na  sustainable  manner.  Availability  of  clean  and  reliable  sources  of  energy  is  expected  to  improve  the  local  economy,  and \nthereby create more work opportunities for the population including the poor. The investment is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020  and  Clean  Energy  and  Environment  Program,  which  calls  for  ADB  investments  in  energy  efficiency  and  renewable \nenergy  in  Asia  to  reach  about  $1  billion  per  year.  It  is  also  expected  to  increase  power  generation  from  renewable  energy \nsources in India, in line with the Government\u2019s objectives in the Electricity Act of 2003 and the Power for All by 2012 initiative. \nThe investment is consistent with the CSP update (2006\u20132008) and with the CPS (2009\u20132012) now being prepared to sustain \nADB\u2019s  support  for  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth  in  India.  It  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  pillars  of \n(i) supporting the development of a low-carbon infrastructure, explicitly in hydropower and other renewable energy forms; and \n(ii) catalyzing investment through the use of innovative business and financing modalities such as public-private partnerships, \nnonsovereign operations, and the carbon credit market. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key Issues. The availability of electric power, and more broadly infrastructure, has an indirect but strong link with poverty \nreduction and economic growth. The availability of reliable power supply from renewable sources will encourage the growth of \nlocal enterprises, the development of good transport and communications systems, and the improvement of health and other \nsocial  services,  ultimately  resulting  in  more  employment  and  improved  living  conditions  for  the  poor  in  the  areas  where \nrenewable energy projects will be developed.  \n2. Design Features. The investment will achieve an outcome of 500 MW of additional renewable power generation by 2012 \nby implementing projects through public-private partnership, thus catalyzing investment from the private sector and delivering \nmaximum value to the public sector. The addition of 500 MW in renewable energy capacity would provide about 1.1 GWh of \nadditional  electricity  per  year  and  thus  help  to  bridge  the  persistent  energy  deficits  and  load  shedding  disproportionately \naffecting India\u2019s poor, who have little or no access to electricity. \n \n\nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending Not applicable. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of the Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. Social impact assessments will be undertaken as part of the feasibility studies to be conducted for each project \nto  be  developed  by  the  JVC.  Given  the  nature  and  general  location  of  projects,  the  investment  has  been  classified  as  B/C \nunder  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  B  from  the  perspective  of  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998). The JVC will be required to adopt and maintain an environment and social management system (ESMS) approved in \nform  and  substance  by  ADB.  The  ESMS  will  include  principles,  policies,  and  procedures  for  addressing  the  involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  people  impact  of  projects.  Each  project  will  be  classified  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous people impact; wherever potential impact is identified, the JVC will prepare the necessary social safeguard plans \nand actions and submit these to ADB for review and approval.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nFor future projects to be developed by the JVC, consultation and participation activities will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements and the ESMS approved in form and substance by ADB.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n 35  \n \n\n \n2.

This  is  an  equity  investment  and  no  specific  infrastructure  projects  have  been  identified  for  financing.  The \nJVC  will  carefully  consider  gender  issues  in  the  conduct  of  social  analysis  or  consultation  with  women\u2019s  groups  during \npreparation, and ensure that women participate and receive benefits. \n\n2.

The  main  reason  for  this  has \nbeen  that  capacity  additions  have  lagged  significantly  behind  demand  growth.  For  example, \nduring  the  10th  Five  Year  Plan  period  (FY2003\u2013FY2007)  only  52%  of  the  targeted  capacity \nadditions  were  achieved.  Though  there  has  been  an  absolute  increase  in  capacity  and  in  the \nper capita  consumption  of  electricity,  the  per  capita  consumption  is  a  fraction  of  that  in \ndeveloped countries and also much lower than in some developing countries like the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. The current per capita electricity consumption in India is 700 kWh, compared \nwith  1,200  kWh  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  13,000  kWh  in  the  United  States.  The \nGovernment  of  India  has  highlighted  a  vision  of  \u201cPower  for  All\u201d  by  2012  when  currently  only \n55.8% of the households have access to electricity. The Planning Commission has estimated an \nelectricity-GDP  elasticity  of  1  and  projected  GDP  to  grow  at  8%  over  the  medium  term.  Even \nwith  the  current  global  economic  downturn  and  with  the  lowering  of  GDP  growth  rates  for \nFY2010, GDP is expected to grow at 5%\u20136%. \n \nThe  Central  Electricity  Authority  (CEA)  undertakes  periodic  electric  power  surveys  to \n3. \nproject  the  energy  requirement  of  the  country  and  guide  the  planning  process  for  capacity \naddition. CEA released its 17th electric power survey in March 2007 with detailed estimates of \nthe growth in power demand, region-wise and for the country as a whole. Table A9.1 shows the \nlong-term projected energy requirement across various regions in the country. \n \n\nTable A9.1: Project Energy Requirements \n\n \n\nEnergy Requirement (GWh) \n\n \n \nRegion/States \nNorthern \nWestern \nGujarat \nSouthern \nKarnataka \nEastern \nNortheastern \nIslands \nAll India \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Central Electricity Authority. 2007.

Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n 37  \n\nThe  investment  would  develop  and  operate  wind-power  projects  in  Maharashtra, \n4. \nKarnataka,  Rajasthan,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  small  hydroelectric  projects  in \nHimachal  Pradesh.  In  the  hilly  and  mountainous  terrains  of  Himachal  Pradesh,  off-grid  hydro \nmay be the only source of electricity in the foreseeable future.  \n \n5. \nThe  major  economic  benefit  from  the  investment  is  the  electricity  generated,  which  is \nfully absorbed at current levels of electricity demand in the states identified. These states face \npeak  and  energy  shortages,  which  are  projected  to  persist  in  the  future.  Lack  of  adequate \nelectricity will adversely affect economic growth and development.  \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Costs \n\nCapital  costs  include  the  cost  of  developing  500  MW  of  wind  and  small  hydroelectric \n6. \nprojects,  as  detailed  in  the  main  text,  and  a  conservative  adjustment  of  10%  tax  to  exclude \ntaxes in the calculation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). O&M costs for generation \nhave been adjusted to remove the escalation factor. \n\n4. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nGiven the shortages in meeting energy and peak demand in the offtaking states, all the \n7. \nelectricity generated by the investment will meet unmet demand, that is, it would not substitute \npower from any existing generation capacity. The entire output from the projects is considered \nincremental.  The  economic  value  of  the  incremental  electricity  generated  is  the  cost  paid  by \neach state for power purchased. The energy charge paid is linked to the cost of supply of the \nlowest-cost  thermal  plant.  This  is  taken  to  reflect  the  willingness  to  pay  for  the  incremental \nsupply of electricity in that state.  \n \nAs the investment develops renewable energy technologies, another benefit will be the \n8. \nreduction  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  The  investment  is  likely  to  generate  certified \nemission reductions (CERs) of GHGs, the sale of which will generate additional revenue. Even \nin the absence of CER registration and revenue, the investment continues to contribute to the \noverall  reduction  of  GHGs.  The  investment  generates  a  benefit  (with  or  without  the  CER \nrevenue), which is the lowering of GHG emissions. The estimated reductions in emissions are \nbased on the carbon emissions reduction factor determined by the Central Electricity Authority. \nThe carbon emissions reduction is valued at a price of \u20ac8 per ton of CO2 (about $10 per ton of \nCO2) 2  for  20  years,  as  this  is  a  global  benefit  that  will  accrue  over  the  entire  life  of  the \ninvestment. For illustrative purposes, the analysis was done with and without the benefit of the \nGHG reductions. The inclusion of the benefit of GHG abatement increases the EIRR by 2.4% in \nthe base case. Other local environmental benefits like lower suspended particulate matter and \nthe related health benefits are not included in the quantitative analysis. As these would have a \nnet positive contribution to benefits, the current analysis of economic return is conservative. \n\n5. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n9. \nA  consolidated  EIRR  is  calculated  for  all  the  subprojects  to  determine  the  economic \nviability of the total investment. The base case EIRR is estimated at 21.1%. The results of the \neconomic  analysis  for  the  base  case  have  been  summarized  in  Table  A9.2.  The  sensitivity  of \nthe  EIRR  was  tested  under  four  adverse  scenarios:  (i)  a  10%  decrease  in  output,  (ii)  a  20% \n                                                 \n2  As of 06 March 2009, \u20ac1 = $1.27. \n\n \n\n\f38  \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nincrease  in  O&M  costs,  (iii)  a  10%  increase  in  capital  costs,  and  (iv)  the  simultaneous \noccurrence of cases (i) to (iii). The results of sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table A9.3. \nThe results of the economic analysis indicate that the investment is economically viable under \nall stress scenarios.  \n \n\nTable A9.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(Rs million) \n \n\nCapex \n (10,035) \n (8,078) \n (5,720) \n (180) \n (360) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\nO&M \n (134) \n (221) \n (331) \n (331) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n (337) \n\nGeneration \n(million kWh) \n 430  \n 710  \n 1,173  \n 1,173  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n 1,208  \n  \n\nRevenue \n1,488 \n2,461 \n4,289 \n4,334 \n4,480 \n4,525 \n4,573 \n4,648 \n4,723 \n4,798 \n4,874 \n4,949 \n5,015 \n4,585 \n4,282 \n4,285 \n4,287 \n4,290 \n4,293 \n4,296 \nEIRR \n\nNet Benefits \n(including CER \nrevenue) \n(8,537) \n(5,599) \n(1,367) \n4,218 \n4,189 \n4,594 \n4,642 \n4,717 \n4,792 \n4,867 \n4,943 \n5,018 \n5,084 \n4,654 \n4,351 \n4,354 \n4,356 \n4,359 \n4,362 \n4,365 \n\n  \n( ) = negative, capex = capital expenditures, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and \nmaintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n21.12% \n\n  \n\nTable A9.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nScenario \nBase Case \n (i) 10% lower power sales \n (ii) 20% O&M cost increase \n (iii) 10% higher capital costs \n (iv) Combination of (i) to (iii) \n\nEIRR \nwithout CER benefits \n18.74 \n16.30 \n18.33 \n14.31 \n13.94 \n\nEIRR  \nincluding CER benefits \n21.12 \n18.45 \n20.71 \n16.49 \n15.91 \n\nCER = certified emission reduction, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nYear \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 11 February 2009) \n", "Currency Unit \u2013 Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n", "Re1.00 = $0.021 \n$1.00 = Rs48.8 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nchief executive officer \ncertified emission reduction \ncarbon dioxide \ncountry strategy and program \nCenter for Wind Energy Technology \ndetailed project report \nfive-year plan \nIndia Renewable Energy Development Agency \ngross domestic product \ninternal rate of return \nGeneral Electric \ngreenhouse gas \njoint venture company \nkilowatt-hour \nMinistry of Environment and Forests \nMinistry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources \nMinistry of New and Renewable Energy \nmegawatt \noriginal equipment manufacturer \noperation and maintenance \npower purchase agreement \nstate electric regulatory commission \n", "NOTES \n", "ADB \nCEO \nCER \nCO2 \nCSP \nC-WET \nDPR \nFYP \nIREDA \nGDP \nIRR \nGE \nGHG \nJVC \nkWh \nMoEF \nMNES \nMNRE \nMW \nOEM \nO&M \nPPA \nSERC \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  and  its  agencies  begins  on  1  April  and \nends  on  31  March.  \u201cFY\u201d  before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the \nfiscal year begins, e.g., FY2009 begins on 1 April 2009. \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "(ii) \n \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n", "X.
