THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Industrial Corridor Development Program, and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based  loan  (PBL)  to  India for subprogram  1  of the  Industrial  Corridor  Development \nProgram. The report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for Knowledge \nServices for Industrial Corridor Development Program, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed PBL will strengthen the enabling environment for effective implementation \nof the Government of India\u2019s National Industrial Corridor Development Program (NICDP), which \naims to increase the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, strengthen national supply \nchains and links with regional and global value chains (GVCs), and create jobs.1 The PBL will \nbuild on state-level strategic studies and investment programs already supported by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  the  development  of  industrial  corridors.  The  PBL  is \nconsistent with pillar 1\u2014boosting economic competitiveness to create more and better jobs\u2014of \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2018\u20132022\u2014accelerating  inclusive  economic \ntransformation.2 Transaction TA for knowledge and policy advisory services will be provided to \nsupport certain policy actions under subprogram 2. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 objectives\u2014operational priorities 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.3 \n \n3.  The PBL modality is selected as the loan supports the enabling policy environment for a \nnational program aimed at developing integrated industrial corridors (i.e., the NICDP). The loan \nwill  strengthen  the  institutional  and  regulatory  framework  being  developed  by  the  federal \ngovernment under the NICDP and lay out policy guidelines for states participating in the NICDP. \nA programmatic approach comprising two subprograms was adopted to ensure sequencing of \nthe reforms. The objective of subprogram 1 is to establish institutional structures and strengthen \nthem with guidelines and frameworks on providing knowledge and technical advisories on master \nplanning of industrial corridors, developing skills, and creating opportunities for private sector \nengagement. The objective of subprogram 2 is to ensure that the policies developed under \nsubprogram 1 are delivered in corridor areas and within the mandates of industrial corridor \ninstitutions, and to promote continued private sector engagement in corridors by improving \nefficiency of business processes. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n4.  Background. India is characterized as a lower middle-income country, with average \nannual per capita income of $2,047 during fiscal year (FY) 2019 to FY2021. It is estimated that \nthe percentage of the population living below the international poverty line of $1.9/day decreased \nfrom 22.5% in 2012 to 10.6% in 2017.4 Simulations suggest that poverty would have continued to \ndecline in the absence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the pandemic \n \n1  The National Industrial Corridor Development Program aims to provide multi modal connectivity with complete \u201cplug \nand play\u201d infrastructure along with building resilient and sustainable future ready cities.

India\u2019s economy grew rapidly at an average rate of 7.2% \nduring FY2012\u2013FY2019 but contracted by 7.3% during FY2020 because of COVID-19.5 The \neconomy is expected to recover starting in FY2021 but may take longer to recover if the pandemic \ndrags on. During FY2013\u2013FY2019, the government's fiscal deficit averaged 4.0% of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP).6 However, the pandemic caused the fiscal deficit to increase to 9.5% of \nGDP in FY2021.7 The ratio of public debt to GDP increased significantly in FY2021, to nearly \n90.0%, as growth contracted, and the primary deficit increased (69.8% in FY2017). However, \nmost of India\u2019s public debt is denominated in domestic currency and is predominantly held by \nresidents, which helps reduce external financing risks. A revamped privatization program, once \nfully implemented, will provide more fiscal space.8 \n \n5.  Development problem. Despite India's robust economic growth before the pandemic, the \nshare  of  manufacturing  in  the  country\u2019s  GDP  remained  stagnant  at  about  13%\u201316%.9 \nManufacturing growth declined from an annual average of 8.4% during FY2006\u2013FY2012 to an \nannual average of 7.7% during FY2013\u2013FY2019. Growth in manufacturing exports has been \nweak, resulting in low participation in GVCs. Manufacturing has also failed to absorb the country\u2019s \ngrowing labor force. It employs only 12% of the labor force, which is less than half the share \nemployed  by  the  services  sector.10  The  weak  performance  of  manufacturing  also  limits \nemployment generated in upstream and downstream segments, such as logistics, distribution, \nsales, and marketing. Furthermore, about 72% of the labor force in manufacturing works in the \nlow-productivity and low-income informal sector, where the small size of firms makes it difficult to \nadopt  modern  production  technologies  and  organizational  methods.  Finally,  women\u2019s \nparticipation in manufacturing remains low.11 Their share of employment is about 13%. They \nmainly work in traditionally women-dominated segments such as textiles and apparel, rather than \nin  nontraditional  segments  such  as  electronics  and  automobiles.  COVID-19  has  exposed \nstructural weaknesses, hitting small and informal firms especially hard. Manufacturing output \ndeclined 7.2% from FY2020 to FY2021. \n \n6.  Binding constraints. India\u2019s low competitiveness in manufacturing is reflected in the \ndeclining contribution of manufacturing to GDP, India's low share of world manufacturing exports \n(less than 2.5%), and a low number of workers working in the sector. There are large number of \nmicro and small sector firms in the manufacturing sector, which employ around 10 employees on \naverage (micro and small firms employed just 17.1 million workers in 2015\u20132016). Key factors \nimpacting manufacturing competitiveness include cumbersome business processes and high cost \nof  capital;12  challenges  in  infrastructure,  especially  lack  of  integrated  multimodal  transport \nnetworks leading to high logistics costs;13 bottlenecks in land availability; rigidities in labor \n \n5  ADB. 2021.

Logistics costs are estimated to \nbe much higher at 14% of GDP compared to the developed countries and are expected to worsen in FY2022 as the \npandemic approaches its third year. India needs to lower its logistic cost to below 10% of GDP. \n \n ", "3 \nregulation;14 paucity of industry-aligned skilled workforce;15 and absence of long-term financing \nfor private investment.16 Furthermore, because of unsynchronized economic and spatial planning \nat the city and regional levels, the synergies that typically exist between industrial and urban \ndevelopment remains untapped. Industrial locations have found it difficult to attract the full range \nof skilled workers needed, and haphazard development, including lack of sustainable and green \npractices around industrial locations, have made it difficult to reap agglomeration economies. \nLastly, a lack of information on market trends and opportunities and production technologies limits \nthe ability of the private sector, especially smaller firms, to improve their competitiveness. The \ninstitutional environment for coordination between central and state agencies is inadequate for \naddressing these constraints, which impedes smooth decision-making and implementation of \nreforms. \n \n7.  Government reforms to address binding constraints. The government has introduced \nvarious policy initiatives to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP and raise productivity and \ncompetitiveness. It has streamlined business processes, thereby improving FDI inflows to the \nmanufacturing sector to $11.3 billion in 2020 from $3.2 billion in 2010;17 reduced corporate taxes; \nincreased public investment in infrastructure and proposed new infrastructure finance institutions; \nencouraged state-level land reforms; introduced phased industrial development for land value \ncapture financing;18 and consolidated 29 central laws on labor into 4 codes\u2014on wages, industrial \nrelations, social security, and occupational working conditions\u2014while easing restrictions on \nlayoffs  for  firms  with  100  or  more  workers.  Given  the  country's  youthful  population,  the \ngovernment has launched the \"Skill India\" and \"Digital India\" programs to complement its \"Make \nin India\" program, with an aim to boost growth in manufacturing while creating high-value jobs.19 \nIndia improved its ranking in competitiveness for infrastructure from 60 to 49 from 2017 to 2021.20 \nThe government is also taking steps to strengthen equity and debt markets to provide long-\nterm financing. \n \n8.  Acceleration  of  reforms  amid  the  pandemic.  The  government  has  announced \nadditional reforms and launched the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Movement) \nin May 2020, focusing on the rejuvenation of domestic manufacturing and greater integration with \nGVCs, including the promotion of foreign direct investment in 13 priority manufacturing sectors.21 \nThe government has passed a legislation to up the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and \nDevelopment as a principal development financial institution for infrastructure financing, including \nfacilitating the development of the market for bonds, loans, and derivatives.22 \n \n14 An economic survey 2015\u20132016 noted that firm size in India has remained small because of stringent labor laws \n(lack of an easy exit policy and high administrative burdens).

Government  reform  agenda  based  on  industrial  corridors.  Measures  to  raise \nmanufacturing competitiveness rank is among India's most challenging development endeavors, \nrequiring a combination of policy reforms (e.g., business and labor regulations) and investments \nto create an enabling ecosystem and enhanced coordinated decision making across functions \nand levels of government. The multipronged NICDP, which targets reforms and investments in \nrelation to industrial corridors, provides an integrated approach to address these constraints. The \nNICDP is an ambitious program that aims to develop both brownfield and greenfield industrial \nclusters within corridors. \n \n10.  Industry\u2013urban linkages. Around the world, firms\u2019 decisions on where to locate are \nbased on the availability of not only industrial land and industrial infrastructure for current and \nfuture needs, but also residential (housing), commercial (banking and sales transactions), and \nsocial infrastructure (e.g., schools, colleges, and hospitals), and even the colocation of other \nbusinesses within and outside industrial zones. Industrial planning in India has traditionally \nfocused on pure industrial development rather than on embedded industrial locations in the \ncontext of broader urban and economic planning. This has had two adverse effects: (i) it makes \nit difficult to attract the full range of workers (from trained shop floor workers to supervisors and \nmanagers) needed for a dynamic industrial ecosystem, and (ii) increases urban sprawl. These \nconstraints have restricted transport options, constrained land use options, and dissuaded the \nlocation of modern small businesses that are integral features of economically dynamic urban \ncenters.23 Economic corridors offer an opportunity to synchronize urbanization and industrial \ndevelopment following decades of disconnect between the two, boosting manufacturing, creating \njobs, and improving links with GVCs.24 Corridor development promotes a particular geographic \nspace (known as clusters or nodes), targeting urban centers that not only serve as major markets \nfor manufactured goods and imports but are also sources of labor, technology, knowledge, and \ninnovation.  \n \n11.  Institutional  framework  for  industrial  corridors.  Accelerating  industrial  corridor \ndevelopment will require planners to target specific geographic locations where multiple existing \nconstraints can be addressed in a coordinated manner. Ministry of Industry and Commerce \n(MOCI) through the Department Promotion of Industries and Internal Trade (DPIIT) set up an \napex monitoring and review committee under the finance minister as chairperson, consisting of \nother senior ministers of the government and the chief ministers of corridor states, to oversee \nactivities of the NICDP. Two institutions were set up under the corridor framework to establish \ncoordination between national and state governments. At the national level, the National Industrial \nCorridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT) under the DPIIT, MOCI, was created \nin 2016 by expanding the scope of Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project Implementation Trust \nFund. NICDIT, set up as a public trust of India, will enter into partnerships with state-level special \n \nGovernment of India under the National Infrastructure Pipeline for FY2019\u2013FY2025. In March 2021, the Parliament \nenacted an act to set up the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development to fund infrastructure \nprojects in India National Infrastructure Fund India Limited (Fund of Funds, Master Fund, and Strategic Opportunities \nFund) was created through a union government decision in February 2015 and set up under the Securities and \nExchange Commission, India in December 2015. \n23 For more on the key factors that enable an urban agglomeration to serve as an engine of growth and good jobs, refer \nto: ADB. 2019.

National Industrial Corridor Development Program progress. India\u2019s first corridor \ndeveloped under the NICDP was the Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor, launched in 2007. It was \nfollowed by the approval of the Amritsar\u2013Kolkata Industrial Corridor in January 2014. The second \nphase of industrial corridor development started in 2014 with the conceptualization of the East \nCoast Economic Corridor (ECEC) from Kolkata to Kanyakumari. The NICDP has 5 ongoing \nindustrial corridors in India and the government has expanded the program to 11 corridors \ncovering 17 states, including 7 low-income and special category states in 4 phases.27 \n \n13.  Reform area 1: Institutional structures and mechanisms for industrial corridors\u2019 \nintegrated development strengthened. Reforms under subprogram 1 aimed to improve the \ninstitutional environment around industrial corridor development and introduce gender-inclusive \nstrategies for fulfilling industrial skills needs. Both policy actions included under this reform area \nwere achieved: (i) expansion of NICDCL\u2019s institutional mandate to cover six new corridors in \naddition to five existing corridors under the NICDP, and to assume the role of national program \ndevelopment agency and knowledge partner of NICDIT; and (ii) addressing the need for a more \nhighly skilled workforce to ensure that the industrial corridors function effectively. The National \nSkills  Development  Corporation  (NSDC)  and  NICDCL  jointly  developed  skills  development \nprograms to upgrade skills of local labor force and to address skill gaps with a gender focus.28 \n \n14.  Subprogram 2 will further consolidate the improved institutional environment achieved \nunder subprogram 1. Reforms under subprogram 2 will support synchronized planning, improving \ninfrastructure, reducing asymmetry of information on business opportunities to the private sector, \nand improving private sector\u2019s access to long-term finance. Under subprogram 2, four policy \nactions are proposed:  \n \n(i)  MOCI will develop the National Master Plan on Multi-Modal Connectivity (NMP\u2013\nMMC), an important policy tool that will enhance logistics efficiency and integrate \nindustrial and urban agglomeration, thereby connecting production centers and \nconsumption  centers  to  internal  markets  and  trade  gateways.  A  high-level \nEmpowered Group of Secretaries comprising top officials from key ministries will \nbe formed to develop a formal institutional arrangement to oversee, guide, and \ndecide on the implementation of the NMP\u2013MMC. A network planning group will be \nformed to function as the operational arm of the Empowered Group of Secretaries \n \n25 Special purpose vehicles are entities established at state level with 51% or 50% state government ownership (usually \nthrough contribution of land) while NICDIT funding is restricted to a maximum 50%. \n26 National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation.

Reform area 2: Delivery of integrated and innovative project development and \nfinancing solutions for industrial corridors improved. These reforms supported sustainable \nand green infrastructure planning at node levels, addressed challenges related to unsynchronized \neconomic and spatial planning at the city and regional levels with a gender focus, and improved \nprivate  sector  access  to  long-term finance.  Under  subprogram  1,  four  policy  actions  were \ncompleted: (i) NICDIT developed an investment and financing plan, including modalities and \nproject readiness criteria for disbursement; (ii) NICDCL developed guidelines on project appraisal \nand preparation criteria, and prioritization of project proposals by SPVs to achieve uniformity in \ncorridor development; (iii) SPVs identified by NICDCL adopted guidelines on gender-inclusive \ntransport including infrastructure, services, and policy initiatives in and around nodes;30 and (iv) \nNICDIT adopted green industrial corridor development policy framework for sustainable planning, \nand development of climate-resilient infrastructure within industrial corridors.  \n \n16.  Reforms in this area under subprogram 2 will improve the institutional environment to \nfacilitate SPVs\u2019 access to long-term finance, reduce asymmetry of information, available on \nbusiness opportunities, and improve planning and human resource development with a gender \nfocus  in  industrial  corridor  areas.  These  policy  actions  will  build  on  reforms  introduced  in \nsubprogram 1. Under subprogram 2, five policy actions are proposed: (i) at least five project \nproposals on the development of industrial nodes will be appraised and submitted by NICDCL to \nNICDIT, based on new appraisal, preparation, and prioritization criteria; (ii) at least one SPV board \nwill approve node and/or project-specific concession agreement for master developers in corridor \nareas; (iii) NICDCL board will approve a framework on industrial housing for employees ensuring \nsafety, security, and convenience, which will include gender related provisions and will be adopted \nby an SPV as identified by NICDCL; (iv) NICDCL board will approve guidelines on human \nresources management manuals for the node level SPVs, focusing on gender-inclusive measures \nlike workplace safety and equal opportunity; and (v) NICDCL board will approve guidelines on \nclimate-resilient infrastructure development for the node level SPVs in industrial corridor areas \nthat ensure compliance with environmental and social safeguards and will be adopted by an SPV. \n \n17.  Reform  area  3:  Integrated  investment  in  industrial  corridors  facilitated  and \npromoted. These reforms support reduced asymmetry of information on business opportunities \nto the private sector and gender-focused skills development. Under subprogram 1, policy actions \nwere completed to introduce reforms enhancing transparency, streamlining business processes, \n \n29 The integrated multimodal network planning group comprises heads of network planning divisions from government \nministries and departments. \n30 The gender measures include infrastructure initiatives such as: (i) separate toilets; (ii) CCTV; (iii) improved street \nlighting; (iv) safe travel routes; (v) intermediate public transport facilities; (vi) reserved seating for women; gender-\nsensitization training for employees of freight hubs; and ensuring shuttle bus services at night.  \n \n ", "7 \nand increasing outreach activities to draw private and foreign investment to clusters and industrial \ncorridors. Five policy actions were completed: (i) establish digital platforms such as the National \nSingle Window System, (ii) NICDCL instructed SPVs update information on the India Industrial \nLand Bank portal, (iii) DPIIT upgraded Industrial Park Rating System\u2015three digital platforms that \nenable investors to identify potential investment locations and obtain clearances from multiple \nministries  via  a  single  application  form  and  a  single  platform,  (iv)  NICDCL  developed  a \ncomprehensive marketing and investor outreach plan to attract private investors, and (v) NICDCL \nadopted policies on skills enhancement for implementation by the concerned corridor SPVs with \nthe support of NSDC based on gender sensitive needs assessment and market demand from \nindustries based in the clusters.  \n \n18.  Reforms in this area under subprogram 2 will support reduced asymmetry in information \nto the private sector. Building on subprogram 1, GOI and DPIIT will implement integrated digital \ninformation platforms. Four policy actions are proposed: (i) DPIIT will integrate the national single \nwindow system with 14 state systems, (ii) NICDCL will strengthen guidelines for industrial land \nofftake measures in the clusters, (iii) provide a basis for private concessionaire engagements in \ncorridor utility services, and (iv) DPIIT will expand the IPRS criteria by including sex disaggregated \ndata on employment of labor force in industrial parks. These policy actions will ensure that SPVs \nand corridor entities are able to attract investments.  \n \n19.  ADB's value addition. ADB has been working with the government to boost India\u2019s \nmanufacturing competitiveness and deepen its integration with GVCs, including initiatives like \neconomic corridors; logistics and trade facilitation; multimodal logistics parks; micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprise clusters; industrial park development; and coastal shipping. Since 2014, \nADB has been the government\u2019s lead partner in developing the ECEC through (i) upstream \nknowledge work, including the preparation of comprehensive development plans and master \nplans for priority industrial regions; (ii) funding commitment of more than $2 billion to develop \ncrucial infrastructure; (iii) policy recommendations pertaining to holistic planning of corridor \ndevelopment and ease of doing business; and (iv) investment promotion to attract anchor \ninvestors. The ECEC aims to stimulate regional trade and cooperation through links with the \nproposed Northeast Economic Corridor and Bangladesh Economic Corridor.31 \n \n20.  The government\u2019s Make in India program recognizes industrial corridors as a development \ntool to enable India to integrate better with GVCs, Southeast Asia, and East Asia through the \nregional Association of Southeast Asian Nations\u2013India Free Trade Agreement and subregional \nprograms such as South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) and the Bay of \nBengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation. The PBL is closely \naligned with the SASEC program of ADB through the SASEC Operational Plan 2016\u20132025, which \nalso covers economic corridor development as a strategic priority area.32 \n \n21.  Lessons. The PBL draws upon learnings from the sector development program in the \nVisakhapatnam\u2013Chennai Industrial Corridor,33 project investments in the Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari \nIndustrial  Corridor,  and  TA  support  in  the  ECEC.  These  lessons  include  establishment  of \ninstitutional  frameworks  for  corridor  development;  development  of  single  window  clearance \nplatforms to integrate all investor applications at one place; establishing framework for green \n \n31 ADB. 2018.

The national- and state-level strategic \nplanning and interventions under the ECEC have paved the way for this $500 million PBL, which \nwill support policy reforms and institutional development in national corridors in order to increase \nmanufacturing's share of GDP, improve national supply chains, and strengthen links with regional \nand global value chains.34 \n \n22.  Policy-based loan. The PBL supports a national program which was expanded by the \nGOI by increasing the number of industrial corridors from 5 corridors to 11 corridors across 17 \nstates (para. 12). This expansion will allow states to access additional funds for development. The \nPBL for industrial corridor development will lay the foundation for future support to states, either \nthrough sector development loans or through project loans, and will create opportunities for ADB\u2019s \nprivate  sector  operations  to  engage  with  potential  investors  in  these  corridors.  The  PBL \nstrengthens the overall institutional and regulatory framework that aligns national and state \npolicies that supports planning and facilitate operationalization of integrated development of \nindustrial corridors and facilitate investment from the private sector in corridors.  \n \n23.  Sustainability of reforms. The PBL has a post program partnership framework (PPPF) \nto ensure the government's continued progress toward implementing the NICDP. NICDIT will \nrequire additional funds going forward as the four phases of the NICDP are completed. Supporting \nNICDIT to develop a comprehensive financing plan for corridor development, with relevant \npotential regulatory approvals from Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in raising debt \nfinance and enhance the scope of financing instruments like debentures and bonds is included. \nPPPF aims to ensure that SPVs will adopt green corridors that promote sustainable development, \nestablish gender-inclusive industrial housing, and transport systems within corridors. Project team \nwill  assist  NICDCL  through  technical  assistance  to  achieve  the  activities  in  the  PPPF. \nStrengthening the coordination between the center and the states will encourage participation of \nnew nodes in the NICDP. ADB will also be engaging with more states through policy dialogue and \nlending and/or advisory services to improve the industrial policy and regulatory regime in the \nstates and support them to integrate with the national program. ADB has already identified some \nlow-income states in the northeastern region of India to address the low development and \nremoteness of the region and promote regional cooperation and integration with South Asia and \nSoutheast Asia.35 A project readiness financing facility in the state of Tripura in the northeastern \nregion is being processed to develop industrial estates in the state and it has plans to bring in \npolicy and regulatory changes following the national level engagement.36 \n \n24.  Development partner coordination. The program team held extensive consultation with \nthe World Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which are engaged with the \ngovernment  to  develop  transport  infrastructure  that  supports  industrial  corridors.  JICA  has \nsupported industrial corridor development through the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (spine \nof  Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial  Corridor).  JICA  invested  about  $4.5  billion  in  developing  1,500 \n \n34 The ECEC is India\u2019s first coastal economic corridor, covering 2,500 kilometers of India's east coast, from Kolkata to \nKanyakumari, traversing four states\u2014West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. It is a multimodal, \nregional maritime corridor that can play a vital role in unifying the large domestic market, as well as integrating the \nIndian economy with the dynamic GVCs of Southeast and East Asia. Because of ECEC's vast scope, its development \nis being undertaken in segments: Visakhapatnam\u2013Chennai Industrial Corridor; Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial \nCorridor; Odisha Economic Corridor; and West Bengal Economic Corridor. \n35 These states are Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura. \n36  ADB is currently processing a $2.5 million project readiness financing: Infrastructure Development of Industrial \nEstates in Tripura.  \n \n \n ", "9 \nkilometers  of  the  Western  Dedicated  Freight  Corridor.  In  addition,  JICA  supported  master \nplanning of Chennai\u2013Bengaluru Industrial Corridor and supported EODB and investor promotion \nregulations in Tamil Nadu. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation has a 26% shareholding \nin NICDCL, NICDIT\u2019s knowledge partner.37 The World Bank committed $2.7 billion for the Eastern \nDedicated Freight Corridor, an 1,800-kilometer spine of Amritsar\u2013Kolkata Industrial Corridor. \nThey also provided active support in EODB at the national level, developing an EODB ranking \nsystem and similar evaluations for states. The World Bank also supported the knowledge work \non  industrial  cluster  development  in  the  state  of  Uttar  Pradesh.  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement and German development cooperation through KfW supported the \u201cSmart Cities\u201d \ninitiative,  which  complements  the  corridor  program.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  has \nprovided a debt sustainability assessment letter for the program (footnote 8). \n \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n25.  The overarching objective of the program is increasing manufacturing competitiveness to \nincrease  the  share  of  manufacturing  in  GDP.38  The  program  will  strengthen  the  enabling \nenvironment for integrated development of industrial corridors through institutional and regulatory \nreforms. This will lead to better and more efficient planning for nodes and will facilitate private \ninvestment. The program\u2019s outcome is an improved investment climate for industrial corridor \ndevelopment. The program outcome will be measured through increased investment flow in \ncorridor areas, both from the public and private sectors. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n26.  The fiscal deficit of the central government was $246 billion (9.2% of GDP) in FY2021 \nfrom $132 billion (4.6% of GDP) in FY2020 because of the COVID-19 crisis. However, the deficit \nis projected at $201 billion (6.8% of GDP) in FY2022. As part of its fiscal consolidation plan, the \ngovernment projects reducing the fiscal deficit to 5.1% of GDP by FY2025. External borrowings \nin FY2022 include this proposed PBL and other proposed ADB PBLs as well as borrowings from \nother multilateral lenders and foreign borrowings.39 Domestic borrowings will be made through \ntreasury bills and bonds as elaborated in succeeding Table. As part of National Infrastructure \nPipeline,  projects  worth  $15.5  billion  have  been  envisaged  under  the  Industrial  Corridor \nDevelopment Program.40 The Union Cabinet has sanctioned about $2.7 billion up to FY2027 for \nNICDP.41  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n37 NICDCL\u2019s balance shareholding: Government of India = 49%, Housing and Urban Development Corporation = \n19.9%, India Infrastructure Finance Corporation Limited = 4.1%, and Life Insurance Corporation of India = 1%. \n38 Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Commerce  and  Industry.

The government has requested for a loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the NICDP. The program will consist of two subprograms of $250 million \neach. The proposed loan under subprogram 1 will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; with repayments on an equal instalment basis; an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and program agreements. The loan under subprogram 1 will be disbursed in a single tranche. \nPBL under subprogram 2 of $250 million is also expected to be disbursed under a single tranche \nin FY2024. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  MOCI, through DPIIT, will be the executing agency, while NICDIT, with NICDCL as its \nknowledge partner, will be the implementing agency. A steering committee, headed by the \nsecretary  of  the  department,  has  been  constituted  by  DPIIT  to  guide  and  monitor  the \nimplementation  of  the  PBL.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \nThe implementation period for subprogram 1 is from April 2020 to 31 January 2022. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n29.  The proposed transaction TA will support government initiatives under subprogram 2. The \nTA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The TA will provide advisory services under the \nreform areas and policy actions under subprogram 2 identified in paras. 14, 16, and 18, including \n(i) development of node and/or project-specific concession agreement for master developers, \nmaster plans, and operationalization of utility companies; (ii) framework on industrial housing for \nemployees; (iii) framework on methodology to enhance industry and/or urban linkages; (iv) \nguidelines on human resource process manuals for the node SPVs, including gender-inclusive \nmeasures; (v) guidelines on climate-resilient infrastructure development in industrial corridor \nareas; (vi) an action framework containing processes and methodologies of land policy enablers \nat the nodes; and (vii) expansion of Industrial Park Rating System to include sex disaggregated \ndata of labor force in industrial parks.42 \n \n42 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "11 \n  \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n30.  The program is classified category B for environment, and C for involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples safeguards. A safeguards assessment matrix has been prepared to \nassess potential environment and social impacts and risks associated with the program\u2019s policy \nactions.43 The assessment shows that the program has no direct impact on environment and \nsocial safeguards. The program also has no indirect social impacts as documented in the \nassessment matrix. With regard to environment, potential indirect impacts can be mitigated as \npart of the program. The program has policy actions for sustainable development activities \nthrough a green corridor framework, which will support sustainable planning and climate-resilient \ninfrastructure. Attached TA, which will provide capacity-building support and advisory services to \nnational industrial corridor development institutions and SPVs, will also help address these \npotential indirect impacts. The TA will support the NICDCL board to develop and approve \nguidelines that ensure compliance with environmental and social safeguards and climate-resilient \ninfrastructure development in industrial corridor areas. TA will focus on SPVs in corridor areas \nmeeting the safeguard requirements of the government as well as policies and guidelines from \nany  future  sources  of  international  financing.  Investment  activities  prohibited  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) will be excluded from the program. \n \n31.  Gender elements. Labor market statistics informs that about 18.2% of rural women and \n15.9% of urban women were in the labor force in usual status.44 The unemployment rate was \n3.8% among rural women and 10.8% among urban women (footnote 11). COVID-19 has further \nreduced women's workforce participation disproportionately compared with men, especially in \nmanufacturing. The program's policy actions aim to advance gender equality and social inclusion \nin  industrial  corridor  development  program.  The  program  is  categorized effective  gender \nmainstreaming. As per operational priority 2 of ADB Strategy 2030, the program seeks to \naccelerate progress in gender equality through the provision of direct benefits and support for \nwomen's economic empowerment, gender equality in human development, decision-making, and \nleadership. Supported by specific policy actions incorporated in the program's policy design and \nmonitoring framework, a memorandum of understanding between NICDCL and NSDC have been \nestablished and skills guidelines have been developed. These will be implemented to reskill the \nlabor force considering the gender equality and social inclusion needs. Further, the gender-\ninclusive transport arrangements have been adopted by the SPV. The manufacturing clusters to \nbe developed will provide jobs to women and socially excluded groups. Inclusive worker housing \nwill  incorporate  the  requirements  of  women,  the  disabled,  and  the  elderly  (Appendix  1).45 \nMechanisms for sex-disaggregated data in industrial park rating system are also aligned with \ncapacity building and prioritizing accessibility.  \n \n \n43 Matrix of Potential Environmental and Social Impacts and Measures (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n44 The activity status on which a person spent relatively long time (major time criterion) during 365 days preceding the \ndate of survey, is considered the usual status of the person.

The roads in the nodes have table-top crossings (crossings signalized or constructed \nwith ramps for vehicles to reduce vehicle speeds and emphasize the presence of the pedestrian crossings), bus \nshelters, rumble strips (notifications to inattentive drivers to reduce run-off-the-road crashes) and disabled-friendly \ntoilets. \n \n ", "12 \n32.  Governance. The public financial management (PFM) system in India has (i) a well-\norganized and systematic approach to budget formulation; (ii) a high level of fiscal transparency; \n(iii) comprehensive recording and management of cash balances, debt, and guarantees by the \ngovernment; and (iv) timely external audits by the comptroller and auditor general of India.46 \nHowever, the 2010 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability report as well as other \nassessments carried out for ADB operations in the past two years ending FY2021 noted that \nstrengthening is still required in areas such as (i) effectiveness of internal controls for non-salary \nexpenditures; (ii) effectiveness of internal audit; and (iii) scope, nature, and follow-up of and \nlegislative scrutiny of external audit reports.47  \n \n33.  To strengthen PFM systems, the government has undertaken several reforms including \n(i) rolling out a comprehensive PFM system for digitally monitoring fund flows to states and \nexecuting agencies, and (ii) implementing an expenditure management system. However, ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, and assessments done for ADB operations in \nthe past two years ending FY2021 noted that strengthening is still required in areas such as (i) \neffectiveness of internal controls for non-salary expenditures; (ii) effectiveness of internal audit; \nand (iii) scope, nature, and follow-up of and legislative scrutiny of external audit reports. Based \non these assessments, the program pre-mitigation fiduciary risks are considered moderate.  \n \n34  Risk and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.48 The risk category \nis low. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n35  MOCI through DPIIT, have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform \nto all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail in the draft \nloan agreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Industrial Corridor Development Program, and \n \n(ii)  the loan of $250,000,000 to India for subprogram 1 of the Industrial Corridor \nDevelopment Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \n \n46 According to the most recent available Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment \nconducted in 2010, India has relatively strong PFM systems in place. The overall score for India (2.75) with a medium \nfiduciary risk was relatively high in an international context, given that the worldwide average PEFA overall score for \n57 countries was 2.33 and the average for lower middle-income economies was 2.41 in 2019. \n47 ADB. 2014.
