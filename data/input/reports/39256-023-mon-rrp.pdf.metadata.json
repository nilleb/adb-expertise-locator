This will improve connectivity; reduce traffic congestion; \nand promote sustainable, safe, reliable, and efficient transport.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nThe  population  of  Ulaanbaatar  has  been  growing  rapidly.  The  city  grew  from  about \n600,000  people  in  1989  to  over  1.2  million  in  2010,  representing  42.8%  of  the  nation\u2019s \npopulation  (2.8  million).  Migration  to  Ulaanbaatar  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  future  \u2014it  is \nestimated that the population of the city will reach 1.4 million in 2020 and 1.7 million in 2030.3 \nDevelopment  of  sustainable  urban  transport  for  the  growing  population  is  one  of  the  most \nimportant urban development issues facing the city. \n \nSince 2000, the number of registered vehicles has increased by 4.4 times.4 An average \n4. \nof 35,000 private vehicles has been added annually, representing an average increase of more \nthan  25%  per  year.  The  increasing  number  of  vehicles,  unplanned  urbanization,  the \noverburdened  transport  system,  and  poor  traffic  management  are  contributing  to  congestion, \nreduced traffic safety, and deteriorating air quality. Although the total number of recorded traffic \naccidents  has  been  falling  after  peaking  in  2000,5 the  number  of  traffic  fatalities  and  personal \ninjury  accidents  relative  to  the  number  of  registered  vehicles  remains  alarming.  An  annual \nincidence of 7.5 deaths per 10,000 vehicles highlights the need for continued improvements in \nurban road safety and better protection for pedestrians. \n \n5. \nIncreased trip frequency and travel time, excessive fuel use, and high vehicle emissions \nare reducing the quality of life and causing health problems in Ulaanbaatar. Although there has \nbeen  a  rapid  increase  in  motor  vehicles,  the  majority  of  Ulaanbaatar  residents  rely  on  public \ntransport  or  walking.  The  congestion  on  the  city\u2019s  roads  has  reduced  the  speed,  quality,  and \nreliability of bus services. These problems are particularly acute for the poor because they face \nlonger travel distances and higher costs, ride in overcrowded and poorly maintained buses, and \nare most affected by the lack of infrastructure provision for pedestrians. \n \n6. \nUlaanbaatar needs significant investment in its public transport system to ensure access \nto economic opportunities and social services for all its residents, and to support inclusive and \nsustainable  economic  growth.  There  has  been  chronic  underinvestment  in  public  transport, \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  TA.  ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to \n\nMongolia for Preparing the Urban Transport Development Project. Manila (TA 7156-MON). \n\n3  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2008. The Study on City Master Plan and Urban Development Program \n\nof Ulaanbaatar City. Ulaanbaatar (June). \n\n4  From 1998 to 2011, the number of registered vehicles increased from 36,723 to 162,710. \n5   The World Health Organization estimates that Mongolia has the 18th worst traffic accident incidence in the world. \nThe  capital  city  is  home  to  about  43% of  the  total  population  of  Mongolia but  Ulaanbaatar  routinely  accounts for \nover 70% of annual traffic accidents in the country. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nwhich  has  not  kept  pace  with  recent  urban  growth.  The  majority  of  buses  are  more  than  10 \nyears  old  and  in  poor  condition.  Large  parts  of  the  trolleybus  infrastructure  are  no  longer \nfunctioning due to lack of maintenance, and service quality is deteriorating. About 40% of public \ntransport passengers are subsidized by the municipal budget, but the mechanism for allocating \nsubsidies  to  bus  operators  lacks  transparency  and  is  perceived  as  inequitable.  Most  bus \noperators  lack  the  financial  resources  to  renew  and  expand  their  bus  fleets  and  provide  an \nadequate level of service. \n \nThe road network in Ulaanbaatar has not been expanded to accommodate the increased \n7. \npopulation  and  vehicles.  From  1990  to  2006,  only  two  road  construction  projects  were  carried \nout,  both  financed  by  bilateral  donor  agencies.  Between  2007  and  2011,  only  42.5  kilometers \n(km) of new roads were constructed and 68 km of existing roads were rehabilitated. About 65% \nof Ulaanbaatar\u2019s road network is in poor condition. The road network is particularly deficient in \nthe  outlying  residential  areas,  where  over  700,000  people  live  (around  60%  of  the  city\u2019s \npopulation), including most low-income families. The lack of a reliable road network is a major \nbarrier to the provision of public transport to serve these areas. \n \n8. \nThe  municipality  of  Ulaanbaatar  (MUB)  city  master  plan  aims  to  develop  the  city\u2019s \ninfrastructure,  including  its  urban  roads,  utility  network,  and  transport  system.  The  MUB  road \nfund  finances  road  network  construction  and maintenance  works,  but  it  is  insufficient  to  cover \nthe  city\u2019s  needs.  Although  experienced  in  managing  the  existing  urban  transport  system,  the \nMUB  needs  to  strengthen  its  capacity  to  (i)  develop,  implement,  and  enforce  urban  transport \npolicy  and  strategy;  (ii)  undertake  long-term  investment  planning,  capital  budgeting,  and \nfinancial  management;  and  (iii)  design  and  manage  urban  transport  projects  financed  by \ninternational development partners. \n \n9. \nTo  address  these  challenges,  Ulaanbaatar  requires  a  comprehensive  program  to \nimprove  its  urban  transport  system.  This  includes  investments  in  infrastructure  combined  with \nmodern  traffic  management  technologies,  policy  reforms,  efficient  and  sustainable  public \ntransport services, and institutional development. \n \n10. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  International  development  partners  have  played \nan  important  role  in  supporting  urban  transport  development  in  Mongolia.  In  preparing  the \ninvestment program, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has coordinated closely with each of \nthese  partners  to  (i)  ensure  synergies  with  existing  and  planned  international  support,  and  (ii) \ncontribute  to  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  of  Mongolia  on  introducing  a  financially \nsustainable  and  environmentally  friendly  transport  system  to  support  inclusive  economic \ngrowth.6 \n \n11. \nSector experience. Past transport projects in Mongolia have experienced cost overruns \nand implementation delays. ADB has taken steps to prevent cost overruns under the investment \nprogram  through  extensive  due  diligence  of  the  cost  estimates.  All  estimates  are  based  on \nrecent  bid  prices  from  recent  projects  implemented  by  the  MUB.  Past  implementation  delays \nwere caused by problems with preparing bid documents, bid evaluation reports, and acceptable \nwithdrawal  applications,  and  with  evaluating  bids.  ADB  intends  to  address  the  implementation \nproblems  with  a  multifaceted  capacity  development  effort  that  will  provide  international \nconsultancy support to the MUB. This will directly assist with, and provide on-the-job training in, \nevery  aspect  of procurement,  project management,  and  implementation for  the  duration  of the \nfirst tranche implementation period. \n\n                                                \n6  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fJustification for financing modality. An MFF is proposed as the financing modality for \n12. \nthe  investment  program.  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s  urban  infrastructure  is  growing  very  rapidly  and  urban \ntransport requires a range of complementary investments over the next decade. The investment \nprogram will enable ADB to provide the medium- to long-term commitment that the government \nneeds  to  improve  the  city\u2019s  urban  transport  system.  The  expected  cost  of  the  required \ninvestments  is  about  $274.4  million,  which  is  significantly  more  than  ADB  has  been  able  to \nprovide under a single loan to Mongolia. The MFF modality allows ADB to include the full scope \nof the urban transport sector improvement under the investment program. It also enables ADB \nto sequence its financing in relation to the MUB\u2019s ability to implement the investment program. \n \n13.  Multitranche  financing  facility  constituents:  Sector  road  map  and  policy \nframework.  ADB  has  had  extensive  dialogue  with  the  government  to  formulate  a  sector  road \nmap  and  capacity  development  program.  This  road  map  establishes  medium-  and  long-term \nperformance objectives for the urban transport sector of Ulaanbaatar and draws up a series of \ntargets  and  actions  to  be  implemented.  The  investment  program  will  strengthen  the  MUB\u2019s \ninstitutional  and  implementation  capacity  and  help  it  implement  the  road  map,  policy  actions, \nand investment program. The road map implementation targets are incorporated as government \nundertakings for the MFF. \n \nStrategic  context.  The  investment  program  addresses  ADB\u2019s  strategic  goals7 in  the \n14. \nurban  transport  sector:  (i)  promoting  clean,  efficient,  and  sustainable  urban  transport; \n(ii) improving  sector  institutions,  management,  human  capacity,  and  asset  sustainability;  and \n(iii) developing  and  improving  urban  transport  infrastructure  and  services.  The  investment \nprogram  objectives  are  fully  consistent  with  the  strategic  goals  of  the  country  partnership \nstrategy8 and ADB's transport sector operational plan, the Sustainable Transport Initiative.9 \n \n15. \nInvestment  program.  The  investment  program  includes  (i) construction  of  bus  rapid \ntransit  (BRT)  infrastructure  (roads,  bridges,  and  stations);  and  (ii)  development  of  a  BRT \nsystem,  including  a  bus  management  system  (BMS)  and  bus  information  system  (BIS). \nNonphysical  components  include  institutional  capacity  development  in  the  urban  transport \nsector,  support  for  local  contractors,  extensive  on-the-job  training  in  project  management  and \nimplementation, and sector reform initiatives adopted in the road map and policy framework to \nbe  implemented  with  support  from  the  capacity  development  TA.  The  link  between  the  MFF \nphysical investments and the sector road map implementation will provide strong incentives for \nsector development and reform. \n \nB. \n \n16. \nThe  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  sustainable  economic  growth  of \nUlaanbaatar promoted by a sustainable and efficient urban transport system and services. The \noutcome  will  be  development  of  efficient,  safe,  and  affordable  urban  transport  services  in \nUlaanbaatar. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport, and Information and Communication Technology (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2012\u20132016. Manila. \n9  The  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative,  which  was  approved  by  ADB  Management  on  20 July  2010,  has set  a new \ndirection  for  ADB's  transport  sector  efforts  to  promote  more  environmentally  and  socially  sustainable  transport \nsolutions in developing member countries in line with Strategy 2020. (ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term \nStrategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila.) \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nOutputs \n\nC. \n \n17. \nProject  1.  Outputs  to  be  financed  under  project  1  will  be  (i)  developing  BRT \ninfrastructure  (improve  7.7 km  of road,  expand  the  Peace  Bridge for  the  BRT,  and  install  14.0 \nkm  of  electric  trolleybus  infrastructure  [electric  wires,  feeder  cables,  and  substations])  for  the \nBRT system in the north\u2013south corridor of Ulaanbaatar; (ii)  introducing a 14.0 km BRT line on \nthe  north\u2013south  corridor,  and  procuring  five  trolleybuses  and  vehicle  emission  testing \nequipment;  (iii)  installing  an  intelligent  transport  system  (ITS)  component  (the  BMS);  and  (iv) \nproviding resources for project management, detailed engineering design, and institutional  and \npolicy development. In addition, ADB plans to prepare and provide TA to help the MUB develop \na performance-based contract for BRT operation, and improve the public transport management \ncapacity of the Public Transport Department. \n \n18. \nProject  2.  Outputs  to  be  financed  under  project  2  are  expected  to  be  (i)  further \nexpanding the BRT infrastructure and services, including extending the BRT corridors (27.9 km) \nand  installing  trolleybus  infrastructure  (electric  wires,  feeder  cables,  and  substations)  in  the \nnorth\u2013south, east\u2013west, and ring road corridors (11.1 km), upgrading bus depots, and procuring \nBRT  buses  and  trolleybuses;  (ii)  implementing  traffic  management  and  pedestrian  safety \nprograms,  which  will  include  improving  geometry  and  pedestrian  facilities  of  10  urban  road \nintersections;  (iii)  installing  ITS  components  (BIS  and  e-ticketing  system  [phase  1]);  and  (iv) \nproviding  resources  for  institutional  development,  detailed  engineering  design,  and  project \nmanagement. \n \n19. \nProject  3.  Outputs  to  be  financed  under  project  3  are  expected  to  be  (i)  further \nexpanding the BRT infrastructure, including improving 4.6 km of urban road as required for the \nBRT  system  and  installing  trolleybus  infrastructure  (electric  wires,  feeder  cables,  and \nsubstations)  in  the  east\u2013west  corridor;  (ii)  extending  the  BRT  system,  including  extending  the \neast\u2013west BRT corridor (22.6 km), constructing BRT bus depots and a bus\u2013rail intermodal hub, \nand procuring BRT buses and trolleybuses; (iii) expanding ITS components (BIS and e-ticketing \nsystem  [phase  2]);  and  (iv)  providing  resources  for  project  management,  detailed  engineering \ndesign, and institutional development. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe  investment  program  will  help  the  MUB  develop  a  sustainable,  efficient,  affordable, \nand environmentally friendly transport system that will prioritize public transport and traffic and \nroad  safety.  The  BRT,  as  the  core  of  the  public  transport  system,  will  be  underpinned  by \ninfrastructure  improvement,  policy  reforms,  capacity  development,  and  introduction  of  modern \nITS  technologies.  Introduction  of  the  BRT-dedicated  lines  will  significantly  reduce  passenger \ntravel  time,  which  will  provide  more  time  for  productive  economic  activities  and  improve  the \nquality  of  life,  especially  for  low-income  residents.  Use  of  environmentally  friendly  buses  and \ntrolleybuses,  combined  with  reduction  of  the  overall  bus  fleet  and  use  of  private  vehicles,  will \nreduce  vehicle  emissions  and  contribute  to  reducing  carbon  emissions.  The  ITS  components \n(BMS, BIS, and e-ticketing) will increase the efficiency and transparency of the public transport \nfinancial management and subsidy systems. \n \nE. \n \nThe  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $274.4  million  (Table  1).  Project  1, \n21. \ninclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest,  and  other  charges,  is \nestimated to cost $78.4 million. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million) \n\nInvestment \nProgram \n  \n\n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n  \na  Includes 10% for value-added tax and 5% for import duties.

The  first \ntranche, for $61.4 million equivalent, will be financed from the Asian Development Fund (ADF), \nOCR, and GEF. The ADF loan for $30.2 million equivalent will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  relevant  loan \nagreement. The OCR loan for $29.7 million will have a 20-year term, including a 5-year grace \nperiod,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as set forth in the relevant loan agreement.12 A grant for $1.5 million will be provided \nfrom the GEF fund.

The investment program is technically viable with technology \nchoices based on efficient and proven designs. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n30. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  tranche  1  investments  was  calculated.  The \neconomic  benefits  are  travel  time  and  vehicle  operating  costs  savings.  The  analysis  showed \nthat  project  1  is  economically  viable,  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  24.8%  at  a \n12.0%  discount  rate.  Sensitivity  analysis  confirmed  this  economic  viability.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis considered project economic viability under various scenarios. Economic and financial \nanalysis will be conducted for all future subprojects financed under the MFF. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n31. \nAll works and goods to be financed under the MFF will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  All  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be \nprocured  in accordance with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to \nand  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  facility  administration  manual  (footnote  15).  A  financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  assessment  indicates  that  the  MUB\u2019s  financial  management, \nreporting, procurement, and monitoring systems are satisfactory. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nProject  1  will  directly  benefit  residents  along  the  BRT  corridors  and  indirectly  benefit \nabout  1.2  million  urban  residents  by  improving  living  conditions  and  the  economic  and  urban \nenvironment in Ulaanbaatar. The potential beneficiaries are local residents, students, and road \nand public transport users. Businesses will benefit from greater people mobility and connectivity. \nThe poor and socially excluded will benefit from (i) better access to the city\u2019s activity centers, (ii) \naffordable  public  transport,  (iii)  better  living  conditions  and  less  pollution,  (iv)  employment \nopportunities,  and  (v)  development  of  business  activities  after  project  completion.  Project  1  is \ndesigned  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  action  plan  for  the  investment \nprogram  will  ensure  equal  gender  access  to  urban  transport. 16 Poverty,  gender,  and  social \nassessments will be done in preparation for subsequent tranches to determine their respective \ncategorization  and  required  actions.  The  BRT  will  include  gender-responsive  and  universal \ndesign features and focus on pedestrian safety; ease of access for the elderly, children, and the \ndisabled; and public awareness. A parallel grant project focuses on road safety in school areas. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nEnvironment.  To  comply  with  national  laws  and  ADB  requirements,  an  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  was  reviewed  by  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department and the MUB. 17 Environment classification of project 1 is category B \nas it will not have significant irreversible or permanent negative environmental impacts during or \nafter  construction.  To  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  an  initial \nenvironmental examination was prepared and disclosed.18 The environmental management plan \nwill become an integral part of construction contracts. Assuming effective implementation of the \nmitigation measures and monitoring requirements outlined in the plan, project 1 is not expected \nto  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Subsequent  projects  are  expected  to  be \nclassified environment category B. \n \nResettlement. Project 1 has been classified involuntary resettlement category B. A land \n34. \nacquisition  and  resettlement framework  has  been  prepared for  the  investment  program;  it  was \nendorsed  by  the  MUB  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.19 It  specifies  compensation  eligibility \nand  entitlements,  land  acquisition  and  related  conditions  for  subproject  implementation,  and \nmechanisms  for  the  preparation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs)  for \nsubprojects.  Subsequent  projects  are  expected  to  be  classified  involuntary  resettlement \ncategory B. A LARP has been prepared for project 1 and endorsed by the government and the \n                                                \n16 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fMUB,  and  has  been  disclosed  to  affected  persons  in  the  local  language.

A procurement specialist will be \nrecruited in advance to assist during the tendering process. \nCost estimates are based on recent actual bid prices and will be revised on completion of the \ndetailed design. The cost estimates have been independently assessed by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, including allowances for cost escalation and contingencies. \nThe municipality of Ulaanbaatar and the PIU will (i) develop and implement an efficient public \nrelations program to explain the program benefits to the public, and (ii) use techniques to \nminimize traffic disturbance. \nProcurement review for effective implementation will be applied during loan reviews to validate \nreported procurement capacities and address gaps that may impede program effectiveness.  \n\nPIU = program implementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n37. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  facility  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.  The  government  has  given  ADB \ncertain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by \nthe government with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan and \nproject agreements for the respective tranches. \n \n38. \nADB  will  consider  financing  subsequent  tranches  if  the  government  adheres  to  the \ngeneral agreement for the MFF as set forth in the FFA. Specific assurances for project 1 should \nalso be complied with by the government. Progress toward achieving the outputs and expected \noutcomes  in  the  design  and  monitoring  frameworks  for  the  investment  program  and  project  1 \nwill  also  be  among  the  decision-making  criteria  for  financing  subsequent  tranches  under  the \nMFF. \n \n\n                                                \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $217,400,000  equivalent  to  Mongolia  for  the  Urban  Transport \nDevelopment Investment Program, comprising \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nloans  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  interest  and  other  terms  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  applicable  policies  relating  to  Special \nFunds resources, subject to conditions set forth in para. 23 of this report; \nloans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest  and other terms to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; and \nthe administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 \nto  Mongolia  for  project  1  under  the  Urban  Transport  Development  Investment \nProgram, to be provided by the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund \n\n \nsubject  to  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set \nforth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n27 August 2012 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nEconomic \ngrowth of \nUlaanbaatar is \npromoted by \nsustainable and \nefficient urban \ntransport \nsystem and \nservices \n\nOutcome \nEfficient, safe, \nand affordable \nurban transport \nservices \ndeveloped in \nUlaanbaatar \n\nOutputs \n1.
