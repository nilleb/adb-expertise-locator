THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia, and \n(iii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries (OPEC) Fund for International Development (OFID) to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for \nthe Rural Primary Health Services Delivery Project. \n   \n2.  The  project  will  strengthen  rural  health  systems  in  selected  areas  by  expanding  the \ncoverage and improving the quality of primary health care (PHC) in partnership with state and \nother  service  providers.  It  will  build  on  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  experience  in \nstrengthening health service delivery in rural areas of PNG.1 The project will cover two districts in \neach of the following eight provinces: Eastern Highlands, East Sepik, Enga, Milne Bay, Western \nHighlands, West New Britain, Morobe, and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The government's long-term Vision 2050; Development Strategic Plan, 2010\u20132030; and \nMedium Term Development Plan, 2011\u20132015 aim to transform PNG\u2019s health system to achieve \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals  for  health  and  improve  PNG\u2019s  ranking  in  the  human \ndevelopment index.3 In support of the government\u2019s approach and in line with ADB\u2019s operational \nplan for health,4 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for PNG, 2011\u20132015, which recognizes \nissues of fragility in PNG, includes health as a priority area.5    \n \n4.  The health status of the population of PNG has deteriorated since 1980s with severe \nneglect of the health system, especially in rural areas, where 87% of the population lives. An \nestimated 40% of rural health facilities have closed or are not fully functioning. Limited resources, \ndeteriorating infrastructure, poorly trained staff, and inadequate and declining access to basic \nhealth services are among the main reasons for the decline. \n  \n5.  The country has widespread poverty and weak health indicators, particularly for maternal \nand child health. The infant mortality rate is 57 per 1,000 live births and the maternal mortality \nrate is 733 per 100,000 live births.6 The main health problems continue to be communicable \ndiseases, with malaria, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory disease being the \nmajor  causes  of  morbidity  and  mortality.  PNG  has  a  generalized  HIV  epidemic,  driven \npredominantly by heterosexual intercourse. The epidemiological profile of PNG, with a heavy \nburden of communicable disease, indicates that significant gains in health outcomes could be \n                                                \n1  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for \nStrengthening Rural Primary Health Services Delivery.  Manila.  \n2  The government, in consultation with ADB, selected the provinces based on the criteria on health needs and service \ncapacity in provinces. The Department of Health (DOH) selected these eight provinces for phase 1. Further \nexpansion of the project will be considered at midterm review. DOH has selected two participating districts per \nprovince based upon agreed selection criteria. The government will select project sites in each district in accordance \nwith agreed selection criteria for outputs 2, 3, 4, and 5. A map is included to demonstrate the project\u2019s coverage and \nthe distribution of its resources and benefits. \n3  PNG ranks 137th of 169 countries in the 2010 human development index. UNDP. 2010. Human Development Report \n2010. New York. \n4  ADB. 2008. An Operational Plan of Health for Improving Health Access and Outcomes under Strategy 2020. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2010.

While \nsome hospital services (e.g., for maternal complications) are essential, more than 80% of health \nproblems can be addressed adequately and at lower cost through the effective delivery of PHC. \nThe current poor health status of the rural population points to a weak PHC system that lacks \noutreach services such as for child immunization and providing women with the basic support \nrequired for safe delivery. \n \n6.  Provinces  and  districts  are  responsible  for  delivering  health  care  services  through \nhospitals, health centers, health subcenters, community health post (CHP), and aid posts. The \n1998  Organic  Law  on  provincial  and  local-level  governments  significantly  decentralized \nresponsibility for delivering health care services to the provinces and districts. 7 However, the law \ndid not adequately address how to implement the changes. In the health sector, only operational \nresponsibilities have been devolved, while capital investments remain centralized in the public \ninvestment program.  Provinces are allocated a percentage of net government revenue through \nstaffing  and  health  sector  functional  grants,  which  cover  operational  costs  but  not  capital \ninvestment  costs.  Resources,  authority,  and  competency  are  thus  poorly  aligned  with \ndecentralized responsibility.8 \n \n7.  To overcome this misalignment, three provinces have so far exercised the option outlined \nin the 2007 Provincial Health Authorities Act to establish their own provincial health authorities.9 \nIn addition, the government, recognizing that it needs to prioritize health service delivery  in \ndistricts and communities, has recently developed the concept of the CHP in 2010. CHPs will \nprovide services at the outer perimeter of the health  system. Over time, the government will \ntransform existing aid posts and health sub-centers into a service able to meet the requirements \nof the National Health Plan (NHP) 2011\u20132010. \n \n8.  ADB has provided support for the PNG health sector since the 1980s. The completed \nHealth  Sector  Development  Program10 established  the  Health  Sector  Improvement  Program \n(HSIP) trust account in 1998, which became a major mechanism for administering extended \ndevelopment assistance to the health sector.11 \n \n9.  The  HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in Rural Development Enclaves Project12 has \nsuccessfully built innovative partnerships with non-state service providers to improve rural PHC \nservice  delivery.  Under  that  project,  local  health  authorities  in  eight  provinces  established \npartnerships with six large private companies to improve more than 100 rural health facilities and \ntrained  health  workers  and  communities  in  preventing  HIV/AIDS  transmission,  significantly \nincreasing the number of PHC beneficiaries in project areas. \n \n10.  Building on the lessons and experience of the existing project, the proposed project will \nsupport the government in implementing NHP, as it relates to rural health. The project will \nestablish  and  develop  partnerships  between  state  and  other  health  care  service  providers, \nincluding the private sector, churches, nongovernment organizations, and civil society, working at \nthe provincial and district level to strengthen the rural PHC system.  \n                                                \n7  Government of PNG. 1998.

", "3 \n \n \n11.  By working through the envisioned partnerships, the project will build human resource \ncapacity in the health sector, improve health information and monitoring systems, and revitalize \nrural health facilities to strengthen the existing rural PHC system in PNG. The project will expand \nthe coverage and improve the quality of PHC services for the rural population by strengthening \nthe rural health system at the provincial and district level.  \n \n12.  The project will be implemented under the sector-wide approach currently in place for the \nhealth  sector.13 To  avoid  replicating  government  functions,  the  project  will  use  government \nsystems whenever possible, and the government will be responsible for all facility recurrent costs. \nThe project will focus on infrastructure and training that can help the government deliver health  \nservices more efficiently and effectively,14 building on the strengths of existing health institutions \nrun by the government and others.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The project will contribute to improved health for the rural population in project areas. The \noutcome will be that the selected provinces, in partnership with non-state service providers, will \nefficiently deliver high-quality PHC to the rural population, in particular to women and children. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Output 1: National policies and standards. The project will assist the Department of \nHealth (DOH) to develop and implement policies, standards, and strategies for CHPs15 and \nstrengthen human resources in the health sector within the framework of the NHP.  It will assist \nDOH  in  its  provincial  planning  and  coordination  functions,  including  facility  and  asset \nmanagement, human resource audits, staff retention, and planning health services. The project \nwill provide improved health information systems by applying information and communication \ntechnology (ICT) and geographic information systems (GIS). This support will (i) increase the \navailability of information  at all levels of the health sector, (ii) enable provincial and district \ngovernments to monitor the performance in the sector, and (iii) improve logistics for supplying \ndrugs locally. \n \n15.  Output 2: Sustainable partnerships between provincial governments and non-state \nactors. The project will help provincial and district governments to develop and formalize existing \nor new partnerships with non-state providers of health  services by forming a partnership board.16 \nThis will facilitate greater coordination and efficiency among diverse health service providers and \nimprove their consistency and accountability. In particular, it will assist provincial governments in \nformalizing partnerships and negotiating and implementing agreements with non-state actors, \nincluding the development of monitoring and evaluation tools and targets. The project will help \n                                                \n13 ADB  supports  the  health  sector-wide  approach  with  other  development  partners:  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development,  New  Zealand  Aid  Programme,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund,  United  Nations \nPopulation  Fund,  and  World  Health  Organization.  The  sector-wide  approach  was  initially  established  as  a  \n\u201cpartnership arrangement\u201d to support the country\u2019s National Health Plan, 2001\u20132010 under the HSIP in 2004.   \n14 Long-term commitment and capacity development are in line with the ADB\u2019s approach to fragile countries.

Output  3:  Human  resource  development  in  the  health  sector.  The  project  will \nstrengthen the skills of health personnel in rural communities. It will provide skills and capacity \ntraining for health workers and training in facility management and clinical supervision for district \nand provincial managers in participating districts. The project will also support the government to \naddress issues of performance and retention of health workers.  \n \n17.  Output 4: Community health facility upgrading. The project will build or upgrade two \nCHPs and upgrade and refurbish eight rural health facilities in each of 16 participating districts. It \nwill provide medical equipment and small vehicles including  cars, boats, or motorbikes. It will \nupgrade staff housing, install or upgrade sanitation and waste-management facilities, and supply \nselected health facilities with renewable energy. Design of facilities will take into account climate \nchange impacts, e.g., rising sea levels for facilities on small islands.18  \n \n18.  Output 5: Health promotion in local communities. The project will increase women\u2019s \ninvolvement in all aspects of delivering community health services. Through health programs, it \nwill support existing and new initiatives by civil society organizations to increase knowledge on \nsanitation, primary health (i.e., maternal and child health and HIV/AIDS), and gender (including \ndomestic and sexual violence) in local communities.19 \n \n19.  Output 6: Project monitoring, evaluation and management. The project will support \nplanning, reporting, coordination with development partners, and monitoring and evaluation. It will \nestablish a project support unit (PSU) in DOH. A formative evaluation every 6 months will inform \nstakeholders of project progress, impact, and experiences, including crosscutting aspects such as \ngender and climate change.20 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $81.2 million, including taxes and duties. The project cost \nincludes physical and price contingencies and interest charged during implementation. Table 1 \nsummarizes  the  investment  plan.  Detailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by \nfinancier are in the project administration manual.21 \n \n21.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to                         \nSDR 12,435,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \n                                                \n17 Direct Facility Funding (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Facility-based funding in the \nhealth sector has been introduced in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, used initially for operational costs \nincluding outreach. The project will facilitate the introduction of the funding arrangement in participating provinces. \nOutput-based funding using project funds will be considered after the midterm review of the project.  \n18  Adaptation and mitigation measures should be guided by the opportunities and challenges for climate change    and \nhealth in PNG.

The Government  of Australia,  represented  by the  Australian  Agency for International \nDevelopment (AusAID), is currently refocusing its aid program in PNG, with health and education \nas key delivery areas. To improve aid effectiveness, the Government of PNG has recommended \nthat all aid agencies, including AusAID, channel their support for improving rural health service \ndelivery through the project. The Government of Australia will, through its PNG Health Delivery \nStrategy Program, provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $40 million, to be administered by \nADB.  \n \n23.  The Government  of  PNG  has  requested  cofinancing  of  $9 million  from OFID,  to  be \nadministered  by  ADB.22 OFID  has  provided  its firm  commitment,  with  OFID  board  approval \nexpected in December 2011. In the unlikely event that cofinancing from OFID is not provided \nwithin 6 months following the effectiveness of the loan, the government shall take all necessary \nand appropriate steps to make available all counterpart funds required for timely and effective \ncompletion  of  the  project  whether  through  either  budget  allocations  or  other  arrangements \nacceptable to ADB, in the absence of which the government and ADB shall agree to scale down \nthe scope of the project and if applicable to adjust the relevant financing arrangements.  \n \n24.  The government has requested the Japan International Cooperation Agency to provide 12 \nsenior volunteers to work in selected provinces as provincial partnership coordinators.23 The \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) will support \nthe project with technical assistance in their areas of expertise.24 \n                                                \n22  The OFID loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 1.75% per annum; \nand a service charge of 1%. \n23  Volunteers will be retained by the agency under its standard procedures but will work under the project. \n24 Proposed Program for Output 5: Health Promotion in Local Communities; Formative Evaluation (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The project will collaborate with other development partners \nin the health sector.26 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 November 2011\u201331 October 2019 \nEstimated completion date  31 October  2019 \nLoan closing date  30 April 2020 \nProject management \n(i)   Project steering  DOH, Department of National Planning and Monitoring, Department of Finance, and \ncommittee  Department of Treasury \n(ii)   Executing agency  DOH \n(iii)  Key implementing  DOH,  provincial  government  authorities  in  Eastern  Highlands  Province,  East  Sepik \nagencies  Province, Enga Province, Milne Bay Province, Western Highlands Province, West New \nBritain Province, Morobe Province, and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville \n(iv)  Project support unit  Embedded at DOH and based in Port Moresby \nProcurement   International competitive  64 contracts for civil works, two contracts for  $28.51 \n  bidding; national  medical equipment, two contracts for vehicles,  million \n  competitive bidding;  and eight contracts for workshops \n  shopping  \nConsulting services   Quality- and cost-based  ICT and GIS provision (firm); formative  $27.9 \n                                                \n25 Of which $500,000 will be in-kind contributions for office space, utility costs, and management supervision. \n26 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  The  strengthened  delivery  of  improved  rural  PHC  will  mean  (i)  improvements  in \nproductivity resulting from reduced morbidity and mortality and time spent caring for sick relatives, \n(ii)  increased  household  savings  through  improved  accessibility  to  health  facilities,  and \n(iii) consumption benefits derived by individuals from feeling healthier. The economic internal rate \nof  return  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  21%,  exceeding  the  12%  threshold  for  viability.27 \nUnderestimation is likely, since psychological and consumption benefits associated with improved \nhealth cannot be captured in numerical values. The financial analysis concluded that the project \nis sustainable based on the government\u2019s commitment to cover the costs of personnel, medical \nsupplies,  and  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  all  rural  health  facilities  developed  and \nrefurbished under the project.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n29.  DOH has implemented numerous aid projects using the HSIP trust account. The financial \nanalysis  found  that  financial  management  arrangements  for  implementing  the  HSIP  are \nadequate,  with  documented  financial  procedures,  computerized  accounting  software,  and  a \nfunctioning internal control system. Because the financial management unit depends heavily on \nexternal consultants, the financial management assessment recommends providing adequate \naccounting  expertise.28 The  procurement  capacity  assessment  concluded  that  DOH  and  the \nnational procurement agency face significant challenges in terms of resources and capacity, \ncausing  in  the  past  noncompliance  with  applicable  procedures,  which  could  affect  the \nmanagement of project procurement through government systems. To mitigate these concerns, \nproject-specific measures to enhance governance and prevent corruption include (i) engaging a \nsenior accounting expert and an international procurement expert to ensure the accuracy of \n                                                \n27 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Project Administration Manual (Section V: Financial Management Assessment); Financial Analysis (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nproject accounts and compliance with procurement procedures; (ii) direct payment procedures for \nall international and PSU consultants and other high-value goods and services, with regular \ninternal audits of financial management and procurement in addition to the planned external \naudit; (iii) an evaluation committee to review criteria for tenders of small civil works; and (iv) a \ndedicated section of the DOH website to serve as the project website, publishing procurement \nand performance data to maximize transparency.29 Risk mitigation is discussed in detail in the \nPAM and set out in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and DOH. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.  The project is gender category I (gender equity as a theme).31 Project improvements will \ncontribute to poverty reduction and provide social benefits by expanding coverage and improving \nthe quality of PHC for rural women and children.32 Many health problems in PNG, such as high \nmaternal  and  infant  mortality,  poor  reproductive  health,  poor  nutrition,  and  communicable \ndiseases,  can  be  prevented  with  affordable  access  to  PHC,  including  skilled  professionals \nsupervising  deliveries  and  adequate  medical  equipment,  and  the  project  will  contribute \nsignificantly to improving the health and economic circumstances of rural residents. To increase \nawareness of maternal health, the project will support health promotion conducted by health \nworkers  and  village  health  volunteers.  It  will  employ  a  social,  gender,  and  community \ndevelopment  specialist to monitor  the  implementation  of gender  action  plans  and report  on \nprogress, together with the PSU. The formative evaluation team will collect and analyze sex-\ndisaggregated data for all project activities under the gender action plan.   \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n32.  Environment.  The  project  is  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). An environmental assessment and review framework was \nprepared to guide the assessment and review of project investments. An initial environmental \nexamination was prepared to provide DOH with technical guidance on expected environmental \nissues and how to address them in a manner consistent with the Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n33.  Social safeguards. The project is involuntary resettlement category C and indigenous \npeoples category C in accordance with the  Safeguard Policy Statement. The project is not \nexpected to require land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. All civil works will be on land \ncurrently used by health facilities. A land assessment framework provides detailed guidelines for \nassessing and confirming that the land proposed for each health facility is owned by the state or a \nhealth services partner organization (e.g., a church) with control over the operations of  the \nexisting facility. Melanesians comprise the vast majority of the PNG population, and the project is \nnot expected to have any negative impact on indigenous peoples. While a separate indigenous \npeoples plan is not needed, all project outputs will be delivered in a culturally appropriate and \nparticipatory manner to meet the needs of various beneficiaries. \n                                                \n29 These measures are in line with the recommendations of the ADB\u2019s approach to fragile countries (footnote 14). \n30 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  ADB.

DOH  has  endorsed  the  environmental  and  land  assessment  frameworks  and  initial \nenvironmental examination for the project, which are posted on the ADB website.33 The project \nwill support DOH, the implementing agencies, and other stakeholders by strengthening their \ncapacity to effectively manage safeguard activities. \n  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. The benefits of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the associated risks. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nFinancing delays and lack of  The government gives an assurance in the loan agreement to provide \ncounterpart funds for asset  appropriate counterpart recurrent funding. \noperation and maintenance at  Site selection criteria require evidence of appropriate recurrent funding through \nprovincial and local levels  the Health Function Grant.  \nRisk of reduction in availability of  The risk is spread over eight participating provinces, permitting the project to \ndecision-making authority in  place adaptive emphasis on less-affected areas during the election period. \ngovernment needed for project  The project aims to identify key decision points to be accelerated prior to the \nimplementation for 6\u20138 months  election period. \nsurrounding national elections \nSite selection criteria require preparatory milestones to have been met.
