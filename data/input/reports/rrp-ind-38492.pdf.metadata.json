An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \n\nto  rural, \n\nindustrial,  services, \n\n \nThe  Project  represents  a  5-year  time  slice  of  POWERGRID's \nNational  Transmission  Development  Plan \n(NTDP)  covering \nstrengthening  and  expansion  of  765  kilovolt  (kV)  and  400  kV \ntransmission lines and associated substations. \n \nAs  electricity  is  one  of  the  key  drivers  for  economic  growth  and \npoverty  reduction,  the  Government  has  set  the  target of installing \nan  additional  100,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  generation  capacity  to \nprovide electricity access to all households by 2012. India faces a \ngrowing  deficit  of  electricity.  Unless  dealt  with  quickly  and \neffectively, this deficit will impair the  cost, quality, and reliability of \ntrade,  and \nelectricity  delivery \nthe  country.  Load  shedding \nresidential  consumers  across \n(rationing)  and  significant  voltage \nfluctuations  are  already \nprevalent, especially in the highest deficit regions, undermining the \nindustry, \noperating  cost  structures  of  businesses  across \nagriculture,  services,  and \ntrade;  bringing  down  productivity; \ncurtailing  competitiveness;  and  ultimately  constraining  economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction.  \n \nWith  increased  generation  capacity,  transmission  bottlenecks  will \nworsen,  resulting  in  increased  transmission  losses  unless  the \nnational  transmission  grid  is  strengthened  and  developed.  Open \ntransmission  access  and  development  of  a  national  market  for \npower  trading,  as  provided  under  the  Electricity  Act  2003,  are \nsignificant  policy  developments  that  require  a  robust  and  reliable \ntransmission  grid  to  ensure  smooth  power  flow  within  the  whole \npower  system.  POWERGRID's  NTDP  entails  an  investment \nprogram  of  about  $12.6  billion  up  to  year  2012.  The  huge \ninvestment  program  will  not  materialize  without  long-term finance. \nLocal  finance  is  available,  but  the  terms  are  comparatively  short. \nThrough this intervention, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) can \nbe  considered  a  catalyst  and  additional  in  the  context  of \nPOWERGRID\u2019s \ninvestment  program.  A  robust  and  reliable  \nnational transmission grid with an enabling environment will  attract  \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nincreased  private  sector  participation  in  generation,  transmission, \nand  distribution.  Policy  dialogue  on  safeguard  issues  and  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement  in  reviewing  and  providing  comments  to  refine \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  environmental  and  social  policy  and  procedures \nwill  contribute  to  POWERGRID's  adoption  of  best  practices  in \nsafeguard  policies  and  implementation  of  safeguard measures. In \naddition,  policy  dialogue  in  collaboration  with  other  development \nagencies  will  contribute  to  prudent  financial  management  and \nimproved  corporate  governance  of  POWERGRID.  ADB\u2019s \ncontinuing  support  for  POWERGRID  will  help  meet  the  funding \ngap, and improve the confidence of private sector investors in the \nnascent regulatory framework. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  strengthen  and  develop \nIndia\u2019s  national  transmission  grid  to  improve  system  reliability, \nfacilitate  interstate  and  interregional  power  transfers  by  removing \ntransmission  bottlenecks,  reduce  transmission  losses,  facilitate \nefficient  utilization  of  existing  and  planned  power  plants,  and \nfacilitate  development  of  a  national  power  trading  market  through \nopen access to the national transmission grid.  \n \nThe proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance subprojects \nunder  POWERGRID\u2019s  investment  program.  The  subprojects  are \nestimated  to  cost  $568.0  million  equivalent  (inclusive  of  physical \nand  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction).  This  comprises  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $465.2 \nmillion and local currency cost of $102.8 million equivalent. \n \n\nItem \n\nCore Subprojects \nBase Cost \n \nTaxes and Duties \n \n \nIDC \nSubtotal \nCandidate Subprojects \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n168.0 \n0.0 \n10.2 \n178.2 \n287.0 \n465.2 \n\nLocal  \nCurrency \n\n \n23.3 \n11.7 \n4.8 \n39.8 \n63.0 \n102.8 \n\n($ million) \n\nTotal  \nCost \n \n191.3 \n11.7 \n15.0 \n218.0 \n350.0 \n568.0 \n\nIDC = interest and other charges during construction. \nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Asian Development Bank \nestimates. \n \n\nFinancing \nSource \nADB \nPOWERGRID \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n400.0 \n65.2 \n465.2 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.0 \n102.8 \n102.8 \n\nTotal \n\n400.0 \n168.0 \n568.0 \n\nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Asian Development Bank \nestimates. \n \n\n($ million) \n\n% \n\n70 \n30 \n100 \n\n\f  v\n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 20-year term including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe Loan Agreement. The loan will close on 31 December 2009. \n \n30 June 2009 \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented using a sector loan approach. The \nsubprojects, which have not yet been appraised, will be submitted \nfor ADB\u2019s approval during the implementation stage. POWERGRID \nwill be responsible for planning, designing, contracting, testing, and \ncommissioning  the  subprojects.  POWERGRID  will  submit  an \nappraisal report for each additional subproject to ADB for approval. \nPOWERGRID  will  also  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress \nreports for project monitoring. \n \nPOWERGRID \n \nProcurement of goods and services for the Project will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Supply \nof  materials  will  be  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive \nbidding.  To  accelerate  project  implementation,  POWERGRID  is \nallowed  advance  procurement  action  for  eligible  subprojects. \nRetroactive financing is not allowed. \n \nBy  strengthening  and  developing  the  national  transmission  grid, \nthe  Project  is  expected  to  result  in  efficient  and  more  reliable \ndelivery of services to consumers, particularly benefiting industrial, \ncommercial,  residential,  and  agriculture  customers  in  the  country. \nIn  addition,  by  inducing  industrial  and  commercial  activity,  the \nProject will create more job opportunities and improve productivity \nand  the  quality  of  outputs  in  the  manufacturing  and  agriculture \nsectors.  This  will  lead  to  enhanced  production  and  national \neconomic  growth  that  will  increase  employment  and  income-\nearning  opportunities  for  the  poor.  The  Project  will  remove \ntransmission bottlenecks and reduce transmission losses, thereby \nincrease  electrification \nmaking  more  electricity  available \noutreach.  This  will  facilitate  employment  creation  and  increase \nopportunities for income generation for poor people living in areas \npreviously  without  access  to  electricity.  The  Project  will  provide \nemployment  for  poor  people  during  construction.  Poor  and \nvulnerable  consumers,  often  hardest  hit  by  inadequate  power \nsupply, load shedding, and poor power quality, will benefit from the \nProject. \n\nto \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe  disparity  of  investments  in  power  generation,  transmission, \nand  distribution  may  result  in  some  of  the  national  transmission \ngrid not operating at full capacity. POWERGRID\u2019s NTDP is based \non the sequencing of generation plants in the least-cost generation \nexpansion  plan  developed  by  the  Central  Electricity  Authority  of \nIndia.  The  plan  assumes  a  certain  pattern  of  load  growth. \nHowever,  state  electricity  boards  in  poor  financial  health  may  not \nbe able to adequately invest in associated state transmission and \ndistribution  networks.  To  mitigate  this  potential  risk,  subprojects \nhave  been  carefully  chosen  to  ensure  that  investments  in  the \nnational  transmission  grid  are  properly  planned  and  sequenced \nvis-\u00e0-vis  generation  and  the  state  electricity  boards\u2019  transmission \nand distribution investments. \n \nThe recently enacted Electricity Act 2003, especially the provision \nof open transmission access and development of a national power \ntrading market, is expected to be implemented in a transparent and \ntimely  manner  to  create  a  predictable  and  enabling  policy \nframework and regulatory process in the power sector. This would \nincrease competition and private sector participation. \n \nPrice  increases  in  steel  and  aluminum,  which  comprise  major \ncomponents  of \nthe \nestimated  project  cost.  However,  the  sensitivity  analysis  shows \nthat the Project is economically robust even with price increases. \n \nNo  technological  risks  exist.  POWERGRID  has  been  using  extra-\nhigh  voltage  transmission  technology  and  has  sufficient  in-house \ntechnical  capability  for  design,  project  management  and  overall \nimplementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  similar \nprojects. As it has been operating profitably since its first full year \nof  commercial  operation \nthat  ended  on  31  March  1993, \nPOWERGRID  is  expected  to  provide  adequate  funds  for  project \noperation and maintenance. \n\ntransmission  system,  will \n\nincrease \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID), guaranteed by India, for the Power \nGrid Transmission (Sector) Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nIn  India,  the  total  power  generation  capacity  available  to  the  grid  was  112,000 \nmegawatts (MW) as of 31 March 2004, comprising 29,500 MW of hydro, 77,910 MW of thermal, \n2,720 MW of nuclear, and 1,870 MW of wind.  State electricity boards (SEBs) own 62% of the \ntotal  installed  capacity,  the  central  sector  26%,  and  the  private  sector  12%.  As  of  31  March \n2004, the peak power deficit was about 11% (9,510 MW); the energy deficit about 7% (39,870 \ngigawatt-hours [GWh]). As of 31 March 2003, per capita electricity consumption stood at about \n567 kilowatt-hours (kWh). About 84% of villages, but only about 31% of rural households, were \nelectrified.  Quality  of  power  is  poor,  with  frequent  load  shedding  (rationing)  and  significant \nvoltage  fluctuation.  This  undermines  industrial  competitiveness  and  severely  constrains \neconomic growth. The power system comprises five interconnected electrical regions: northern, \nnortheastern, eastern, western, and southern. The sector analysis is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \n3. \nThe Tenth Five-Year Plan (the 10th Plan) targets a high growth rate of 8% per year to \nsustain poverty reduction. The Government recognizes electricity as one of the key drivers for \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  and  has  set  the  target  of  providing  access  to  all \nhouseholds  by  2012.  To  meet  this  target  100,000  MW  of  new  generation  capacity  is  needed. \nBecause natural energy resources are unevenly distributed and concentrated in a few pockets, \nnew  generation  plants  such  as  hydropower  and  coal-fired  mine-mouth  plants  are  located  far \naway from the load centers. To ensure reliable and secured delivery of power from generation \nprojects to end users, development of an adequate transmission system is vital.  \n \n4. \nIn India, transmission and distribution (T&D) losses are quite high compared with other \ncountries. The world average T&D loss is about 10\u201315%, while India\u2019s T&D loss as of 31 March \n2003  was  reported  to  be  about  33%.  However,  in  the  absence  of  adequate  metering \narrangements,  especially  for  agricultural  consumers,  some  of  the  losses  were  treated  as \nagricultural  consumption.  The  actual  losses  are,  therefore,  thought  to  be  much  higher,  with \nsome  SEBs  now  reporting  T&D  losses  as  high  as  45\u201355%.  The  major  reasons  for  such  high \nlosses  are  pilferage  of  electricity  through  unauthorized  connections,  tampering  of  meters,  and \ntechnical losses originating from overloaded T&D networks. \n \nThe  organization  of  the  power  sector  is  determined  by  the  country's  dual  political \n5. \nstructure\u2014all major issues affecting the sector require concurrent action by the central and state \ngovernments. The financial health of SEBs has become a matter of concern for governments. \nSEB losses have reached an alarming level of Rs330 billion, equivalent to about 1.5% of gross \ndomestic product. The accumulation of electricity arrears to the central power utilities has grown \nto  over  Rs400  billion.  Thus,  poor  creditworthiness  of  SEBs  has  considerably  slowed  private \nsector  investing  despite  the  central  Government\u2019s  enabling  and  encouraging  framework. \nConsequently,  the  Government  formulated  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform \nProgram  (Supplementary  Appendix  A)  to  introduce  reforms  at  the  distribution  level  with  an \noverall objective of reducing T&D losses to 15%. Implementation began in February 2000.  \n \n\n\f2 \n\nIn  line  with  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  Act  1998,  the  Central  Electricity \n6. \nRegulatory Commission (CERC) was established in 1998. CERC has full authority to determine \nbulk  tariffs.  The  1998  Act  enables  state  governments  to  establish  state  electricity  regulatory \ncommissions with jurisdiction over state power utilities.  CERC regulates the interstate, regional, \nand interregional transmissions, while the 23  state  electricity  regulatory  commissions regulate \nstate  transmission  and  distribution.  State  and  central  regulatory  commissions  have  powers  to \ngrant,  amend,  and  revoke  licenses;  regulate  the  performance  of  licensees;  determine  tariffs; \nsafeguard consumers' interest while ensuring cost recovery of electricity; promote development \nof markets, including trading; and rationalize electricity tariffs by making subsidies transparent. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nNational Transmission Grid \n\n \n7. \nPOWERGRID,  established  as  the  central  transmission  utility  in  1989  and  fully \noperational in 1991, is responsible for developing and operating the national transmission grid \nspanning interstate and interregional transmission links, including load dispatch. Prior to 1991, \ncentral  sector  generating  companies  constructed  and  operated  the  transmission  facilities  to \nevacuate  power  from  their  power  plants  and  transmit  to  client  SEBs.  Therefore,  the  national \ntransmission  grid  has  historically  evolved  in  an  unplanned  manner,  resulting  in  transmission \nbottlenecks  with  high  transmission  losses.  At  present,  transmission  links  within  each  electrical \nregion (interstate) and especially between the five electrical regions are limited.1  \n \n8. \nWith  the  addition  of  100,000  MW  of  generation  capacity  by  2012,  the  transmission \nbottlenecks  will  worsen  and  transmission  losses  will  increase  unless  the  national  transmission \ngrid is strengthened and expanded. In 2003, the Government enacted the Electricity Act, which \nincludes provision of open transmission access to facilitate development of a national market for \npower trading. POWERGRID responded by formulating the National Transmission Development \nPlan (NTDP) to develop a robust and reliable national transmission grid to ensure smooth power \nflow within the whole power system (Appendix 2). To implement the NTDP, investments totaling \nup  to  $12.6  billion  over  8  years  are  needed,  including  from  the private sector and commercial \ncofinancing. \n \n9. \nThe  huge  investment  program  will  not  materialize  without  long-term  finance.  Local \nfinance  is  available,  but  the  terms  are  comparatively  short.  The  involvement  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  can  help  bring  down  the  total  cost  of  funds  to  POWERGRID  and \nultimately  the  tariff  to  end-users.  Through  this  intervention,  ADB  can  be  considered  a  catalyst \nand  additional  in  the  context  of  POWERGRID\u2019s  investment  program.  A  robust  and  reliable \nnational  transmission  grid  with  an  enabling  environment  will  attract  increased  private  sector \nparticipation  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Policy  dialogue  on  safeguard  issues \nand  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  reviewing  and  providing  comments  to  refine  POWERGRID\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  policy  and  procedures  (ESPP)  will  contribute  to  POWERGRID's \nadoption  of  best  practices  in  safeguard  policies  and  implementation  of  safeguard  measures. \nAlso  policy  dialogue  on  prudent  financial  management  and  appointment  of  independent board \nmembers  will  contribute  to  improved  corporate  governance.  The  private  sector  has  been \ncautious  to  invest  in  a  new  unproven  regulatory  framework,  and  has  contributed  about  $120 \nmillion to develop the national transmission grid, which is small com pared with the overall need \n                                                 \n1   Only  the  eastern  and  northeastern  regional  power  systems  are  operating  in  synchronous  mode  with  frequency \ncontrol  and  power  flow  control  schemes,  while  the  other  three  regional  power  systems  have  been  operating  in \nasynchronous  mode  with  interchanges  of  power  with  neighboring  regional  power  systems  on  high  voltage  direct \ncurrent links, or on radial mode, alternating current transmission links. \n\n\f3 \n\nof  the  NTDP.  ADB\u2019s  continuing  support  for  POWERGRID  will  help  meet  the  funding  gap  and \nimprove private sector confidence in the nascent regulatory framework (para. 25). \n \n\n2. \n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy for the Power Sector \n\n \nADB's  strategy  for  the  power  sector2  is  in  synergy  with  the  10th  Plan  to  develop \n10. \ninfrastructure  needed  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the \nenergy  sector3  has  six  main  priorities:  (i)  reforming  the  power  sector;  (ii)  promoting  higher \nefficiency  and  low-carbon  power  sources;  (iii)  expanding  and  optimizing  transmission  and \ndistribution systems; (iv) providing institutional strengthening to implement reforms required by \nthe Electricity Act 2003; (v) promoting private sector participation; and (vi) encouraging energy \nconservation, and ensuring environmental and social sustainability.  \n \n11. \nADB  has  provided  support  for  nationwide  sector  reforms  through  Power  Finance \nCorporation Limited,4 a government-owned development finance institution for the power sector. \nTo  overcome  transmission  bottlenecks,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  is  focused  on  strengthening  the \nnational  transmission  grid  through  POWERGRID.5  The  proposed  sector  loan  will  support  the \ndevelopment of the national transmission grid and introduce best practices that will lead to pro-\npoor growth and poverty reduction consistent with ADB's country assistance strategy for India. \n \nADB has supported state power sector reforms and stand-alone investments in Assam, \n12. \nGujarat,  and  Madhya  Pradesh,  which  included  facilitation  of  private  sector  participation  in \ngeneration facilities.6 ADB will continue to expand its promotion of state power sector reforms by \nincluding more states such as Uttaranchal and West Bengal; and by  deepening its efforts in the \nstates where it is currently active such as Assam, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh. As requested by \nthe  Government  and  due  to  the  high  prevalence  of  poverty,  ADB  is  also  considering  initiating \npower sector-related activities in the northeastern states. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n13. \nADB has conducted four project performance audit reports for energy projects in India, \ncomprising  two  loans  for  thermal  power  stations,  one  loan  for  a  hydrocarbon  sector  program, \nand one loan for gas rehabilitation and expansion. Relevant lessons learned are (i) the need for \nADB to be flexible and adaptable to changing conditions in India, (ii) land acquisition should be \ncarried  out  expeditiously  to  minimize  implementation  delays,  (iii)  construction  contracts should \nbe  properly  packaged  to  facilitate  implementation  and  coordination,  and  (iv)  loan  covenants \nshould be appropriate. \n \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2003. 2003\u20132006 Country Strategy and  Program for India.

Manila. \n\n\f4 \n\nBalanced  development  of  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  is  essential  to \n14. \nimprove  the  power  sector.  As  generation  is  attracting  increasing  private  sector  participation, \ncontinuing  public  investments  in  strengthening  and  expanding  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems are needed. At the central level, ensuring open transmission access and development \nof a national power trading market to attract increased private sector investments in generation \nrequire a robust and reliable national transmission grid to ensure electricity flows smoothly from \ngenerators to distributors. At the state level, the poor financial health of most SEBs has resulted \nin inadequate investments in state transmission and distribution systems. Realizing that macro \nmanagement  of  the  states\u2019  finances  need  to  be  improved  for  the  successful  turnaround  of  the \nstate  power  sector,  ADB  has  been  working  with  states  to  reform  and  restructure  the  power \nsector  to  bring  a  holistic  change  in  their  macroeconomic  management.  Improvements  in  the \npower sector to provide financial sustainability will increase the ability of state governments to \nallocate more resources for the social sectors to address poverty reduction. \n \n15. \nThe  ongoing  Power  Transmission  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (footnote  5)  has \nencountered  implementation  delays  with  a  subproject  that  has  transmission  lines  emanating \nfrom  a  new  power  generation  plant.  Approval  of  the  construction  of  the  power  plant  and \ntransmission  lines  was  delayed,  and  it  is  outside  the  control  of  POWERGRID.  Subprojects \nunder  the  proposed  sector  Project  will  be  carefully  selected  to  ensure  that  investments  are \nproperly planned and sequenced. \n \n\n4.  \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n16. \nPrevious  ADB  assistance  and  major  assistance  by  other  aid  agencies  to  the  power \nsector in India are listed in Appendix 3. ADB\u2019s total public sector lending to India was about $13 \nbillion as of 31 December 2003. Of this, 14 loans totaling about $3 billion (23%) were approved \nfor the power sector. The first four projects were for power generation, two were sector loans to \nsupport  efficiency  improvements  of  SEBs,  two  were  for  development  of  the  national \ntransmission  grid,  and  the  six  most  recent  were  for  sector  development  to  support  sector \nrestructuring.  Under  its  private  sector  operations,  ADB  has  approved  four  loans  totaling  about \n$80  million  for  two  transmission  and  two  generation  projects.7  Power  projects  have  been \nconsidered for financing under ADB's private sector infrastructure facility8 and the Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Finance  Company.9  ADB  has  approved  about  $19  million  for  33  technical \nassistance grants, mainly advisory, at the national and state levels.  \n \n17. \nThe  World  Bank,  the  other  major  funding  source,  has  supported  power  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  projects,  including  assistance  for  SEBs.  The  World  Bank  is \nsupporting  power  sector  reforms  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Haryana,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar \nPradesh. In Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, power sector reform is viewed as part of overall \nreform  of  the  state  finances.  ADB  coordinates  closely  with  the  World  Bank  to  ensure  overall \ncomplementarity of actions and consistency of policy advice at the central and state levels.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1991.

The  Department \nfor  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  is  financing  studies  for  power  sector \nrestructuring  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Haryana,  Orissa,  and  West  Bengal;  and  recently  started  an \nextensive program in Madhya Pradesh and Assam in coordination with ADB and the Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency. The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \nhas  (i)  supported  studies  for  state  sector  reforms  through  the  Power  Finance  Corporation;  (ii) \nprovided  grant  assistance  for  energy  management,  conservation,  and  training;  (iii)  extensively \nsupported and continues to support policy aspects of private sector participation and renewable \nenergy  development;  and  (iv)  recently  started  a  new  program  to  modernize  distribution.  The \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency  helped  Kerala  and  Madhya  Pradesh  conduct \nextensive studies to restructure their power sectors.  Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau of Germany \n(KfW) supports thermal and hydropower generation, including rehabilitation and modernization. \n \n\n \n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \nADB,  in  close  coordination  with  other  major  development  partners  active  in  the  power \n19. \nsector,  have  through  policy  dialogue  facilitated  a  policy  environment  conducive  for  efficient \noperations in the power sector. The unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution of \ncentral  power  agencies  with  POWERGRID  as  the  independent  national  transmission  grid \noperator;  involvement  of  a  public-private  partnership  in  transmission;  implementation  of  an \navailability-based tariff structure for economic generation dispatch; reforms in SEBs (the clients \nof  POWERGRID);  and  recently  enactment  of  the  Electricity  Act  2003  are  important  policy \ndevelopments.  The  key  developments  in  the  central  policy  environment  are  summarized  in \nAppendix 4. During the processing of the proposed sector loan, the following policy issues were \ndiscussed with the Government and POWERGRID. \n \n\na. \n\nNegative Pledge  \n\n20. \nThe  two  previous  ADB  loans  (footnote  5)  to  POWERGRID  have  a  negative  pledge \ncovenant  relating  to  its  borrowings.  The  negative  pledge  clause  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility is only applicable to foreign currency borrowings. In order to maintain the existing \nrelationship  with  ADB,  and  not  only  secure  but  also  deepen  ADB\u2019s  future  involvement  in  its \ninvestment  program,  POWERGRID,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  has  taken  action  to  obtain  the \nconsent  of  the  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  and  Bank  of  India, \nCayman Islands to cede a pari passu charge so that the charge to be created in favor of ADB \nshall  rank  equally  and  ratably  to  their  loans  to  secure  the  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest \nand other charges on the two previous ADB loans. Given the steps needed to meet the negative \npledge  requirement  subsequent  to  the  positive  actions  by  POWERGRID,  it  is  expected  that \ncompletion of the process will be achieved by 30 June 2005. A Board Paper was circulated on \n19  November  2004  seeking  waiver  of  the  negative  pledge  covenant  under  the  two  previous \nloans  to  POWERGRID  with  respect  to  its  domestic  borrowings  in  order  to  harmonize  the \nnegative pledge conditions in those two loans with the current LIBOR-based loan regulations. A \ndetailed  analysis  of  POWERGRID\u2019s  borrowing  requirements  and  financial  performance  has \nindicated  that  POWERGRID  has  been  operating  profitably  since  its  first  year  of  commercial \noperations  that  ended  31  March  1993.  Since  the  commencement  of  ADB  lending  in  1996, \nPOWERGRID has consistently met all its debt service obligations.  \n \n\n\f6 \n\nb. \n\nFinancial Governance \n\nthe  major \n\nfinancial  concern \n\nto  management,  computerized  management \n\nCollection  of  accounts  receivable  has  been \n\n21. \nfor \nPOWERGRID.  In  March  2003,  the  entire  outstanding  accounts  receivable  of  SEBs,  as  of  the \ncut-off  date  of  30  September  2001  and  amounting  to  about  Rs12  billion,  were  securitized  by \nReserve  Bank  of  India\u2019s  tax-free  bonds.  Given  that  securitization  of  the  outstanding  accounts \nreceivable will only reduce the past dues of SEBs, POWERGRID has signed agreements with \n27 SEBs to pay their current dues through irrevocable revolving letters of credit opened in favor \nof POWERGRID and covering an amount equivalent to 100% of each SEB's average monthly \nbilling  of  the  previous  financial  year  as  allowed  by  CERC.  Currently,  outstanding  accounts \nreceivable are 2.4 months of equivalent sales. ADB, in consultation with other funding agencies \nincluding the World Bank, will require POWERGRID to maintain its accounts receivable to less \nthan  3  months  of  billable  amount  as  allowed  by  CERC.  In  addition,  ADB  will  not  finance  any \nsubprojects in SEBs with poor payment record of dues to POWERGRID.  \n  \n22. \nAs  part  of  overall  power  sector  reform,  the  Government  is  enhancing  governance \nthrough corporatization, independence of boards of directors from the Government, delegation \nof  powers \ninformation  systems,  and \ncommercialization  of  activities.  As  POWERGRID\u2019s  bonds  are  listed  in  the  Delhi  Stock \nExchange, the Government appointed three independent directors to POWERGRID\u2019s board of \ndirectors  to  fulfill  the  listing  requirements  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India. \nPOWERGRID  is  conducting  a  comprehensive  review  of  corporate  governance  and  financial \naccountability with assistance from the World Bank and will share the review findings with ADB.  \n \nDuring  project  processing,  the  financial  management  structure  of  POWERGRID  was \n23. \nassessed  and  found  to  be  adequate  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).  Its  financial  accounting \nsystem  is  computerized  with  confidentiality  and  integrity  at  various  levels.  Existence  of  well-\ndefined  charts  of  accounts  enables  proper  recording  of  financial  transactions.  Accounting \npolicies, based on the accounting standards issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \nIndia, have been framed for accounting and preparation of the financial statements. Accounting \nand  financial  reporting  related  responsibilities  are  carried  out  as  per  delegation  of  powers \ndefined  and  approved  by  POWERGRID\u2019s  board  of  directors.  Its  Finance  Department  has \ndeveloped written procedures and guidelines for this reporting. POWERGRID has constituted a \ncommittee  of  three  independent  chartered  accountants  to  review  its  existing  procedures, \nsystems, and capabilities in the area of financial management, including risk management. The \nupdated manuals have been shared with ADB. \n \n\nc. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\n24. \nIn 1998, POWERGRID adopted a comprehensive company policy on ESPP; it has a full-\nfledged department to manage environmental and social issues. Although the field practices of \nPOWERGRID are consistent with sound environmental, social, and  resettlement management, \nsome  gaps  exist  compared  with  the  safeguard  policy  requirements  of  ADB.  These  were \ndiscussed with POWERGRID during project processing. As a result, POWERGRID is refining its \nESPP by constituting a review committee comprising civil  society, academia, and development \npartners, including ADB and World Bank, to review the updated ESPP. Dialogue on safeguard \nissues and ADB's involvement in refining the ESPP will contribute to POWERGRID's adoption \nof best practices in safeguard policies and implementation of safeguard measures. \n \n\n\f7 \n\nd. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation in Transmission \n\n25. \nADB  provided  a  technical  assistance  grant  to  POWERGRID  to  facilitate  private  sector \nparticipation  in  electricity  transmission.10  The  main  deliverables  included  capacity  building  of \nPOWERGRID,  and  draft  documentation  relating  to  request  for  proposals  and  transmission \nservice  agreements.  As  a  result  and  through  the  ADB  private  sector  window,  ADB  provided  a \nloan  for  the  first  public-private  partnership  in  power  transmission  project  in  India  of  which \nPOWERGRID  is  one  of  the  sponsors  (footnote  7).  ADB's  participation  is  viewed  as \ndemonstrational and catalytic, as the public-private partnership project will facilitate the creation \nof  a  framework  for  power  transmission  participation  by  the  private  sector.  Transparent  and \ntimely  implementation  of  the  Electricity  Act  2003  will  foster  an  enabling  environment  for \nincreased  private  sector  participation,  especially  through  open  transmission  access  and \ndevelopment of a national power trading market with POWERGRID as the independent national \ntransmission  grid  operator.  Continuing  policy  dialogue  has  been  held  with  POWERGRID  and \nthe Government to increase private sector participation through fair and transparent competition \nin developing the national transmission grid. POWERGRID has identified two more transmission \nprojects  for  private  sector  participation  through  open  bidding.  However,  the  private  sector  has \nbeen  cautious  in  investing  in  transmission  because  of  the  unproven  regulatory  framework.  In \naddition, the poor creditworthiness of SEBs has discouraged the private sector from investing in \nstate \nimplement \nthe \nPOWERGRID\u2019s NTDP to 2012 (paras. 8 and 9), ADB\u2019s continuing support for POWERGRID will \nmeet the funding gap and improve private sector confidence in the regulatory framework. \n \n\ntransmission  networks.  Because  of \n\ninvestment  needed \n\nlarge \n\nto \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n26. \nThe  objective  is  to  help  strengthen  and  develop  India\u2019s  national  transmission  grid. \nDevelopment of the national transmission grid is important given the location of natural energy \nresources  and  load  centers  (para.  3).  The  national  transmission  grid,  comprising  765  kV  and \n400  kV  transmission  lines  and  associated  substations,  needs  to  be  strengthened  and \naugmented to improve system reliability, facilitate interstate and interregional power transfers by \nremoving  transmission  bottlenecks,  reduce  transmission  losses,  facilitate  efficient  utilization  of \nexisting  and  planned  power  plants,  and  facilitate  development  of  a  national  power  trading \nmarket  through  open  access  to  the  national  transmission  grid.  The  Project  Framework  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n27. \nThe sector loan modality is justified as (i) POWERGRID's NDTP is a well-defined sector \ndevelopment plan that covers all the five regional grids; and (ii) the Electricity Act 2003 provides \nthe enabling policy environment for wholesale competition, trading, and efficiency improvements \nin  the  Indian  power  sector.  POWERGRID  has  demonstrated  its  institutional  capacity  to \nimplement sector loans.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n28. \nTechnical  Justification.  The  Central  Electricity  Authority  carries  out  least-cost \ngeneration  expansion  and  long-term  transmission  planning  studies  for  the  country  using  an \nintegrated  resource  planning  approach  to  ensure  optimum  use  of  national  power  resources. \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB.  1999.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Government  of  India  for  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Electricity \n\nTransmission. Manila. \n\n\f8 \n\nBased on these studies, POWERGRID, as the central transmission utility, formulates its NTDP \nthrough  exhaustive  engineering  design  calculations.  POWERGRID  employs  state-of-the-art \ncommercially  available  power  system  simulation  software  packages  to  perform  detailed  power \nflow studies, short-circuit calculations, and dynamic and transient stability analyses to ensure a \nrobust yet optimal national transmission grid based on internationally proven extra-high voltage \nalternating current and high voltage direct current transmission technologies.  \n \n29. \n \n\nSubproject Selection. Criteria include the following: \n\nThe subproject should be technically feasible. \nThe subproject will be part of POWERGRID's NTDP. \nAny  subproject  classified  as  category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy 2002 will not be eligible.  \nThe  subproject  will  not  include  transmission  lines  emanating  from  power \ngenerating stations. \nThe SEB or other beneficiary of the subproject has a satisfactory payment record \nwith POWERGRID, i.e., has an accounts receivable owing to POWERGRID of  3 \nmonths or less. \n\n \n30. \nBased  on  the  data  available  and  the  eligibility  criteria,  ADB  and  POWERGRID  have \njointly appraised the following three core subprojects covering the states of Andhra Pradesh and \nTamil Nadu, and the Union Territory of Pondicherry: \n \n\nGrid strengthening for Tamil Nadu I. The subproject comprises construction of \n600 circuit-kilometers (cct-km) of new 400 kV transmission lines from Tirunelveli \nto Udumalpet, and 220 cct-km of new loop-in-loop-out 400 kV transmission lines \nfrom  Madurai  to  Trivandrum;  construction  of  a  new  400/220  kV  substation  with \n2x315  megavolt-ampere  (MVA)  transformation  capacity  at  Tirunelveli;  and \naugmentation of existing 400/220 kV substations at Udumalpet and Trivandrum, \neach with a 315 MVA transformer. \nGrid strengthening for Tamil Nadu II. The subproject comprises construction of \n280 cct-km of new 400 kV transmission lines from Pugalur to Madurai, and 156 \ncct-km of new 400 kV transmission lines from Udumalpet to Arasur; construction \nof new 400/220 kV substations with 2x315 MVA transformation capacity each at \nPugalur and Arasur; and augmentation of 400/220 kV substation bays at Madurai \nand Udumalpet. \nGrid strengthening for Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Union Territory of \nPondicherry  includes  the  establishment  of  a  new  2x315  MVA  substation  at \nPondicherry  and  Warangal  by  60  cct-km  line-in-line-out of one of the circuits of \nNeyveli-Sriperumbudur  400  kV  double-circuit  transmission  line  and  38  cct-km \nline-in-line-out  of  Ramagundam-Khammam  400  kV  single-circuit  transmission \nline, respectively. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n31. \nSelection  of  additional  subprojects  after  loan  approval  will  satisfy  the  eligibility  criteria \n(para.  29),  and  POWERGRID  will  follow  procedures  that  include  (i) carrying  out  a  technical \nfeasibility  study  for  each  subproject;  (ii) preparing a resettlement plan (RP); (iii) conducting an \ninitial environmental examination (IEE); and (iv) if indigenous people are impacted, preparing an \nindigenous  peoples  development  plan  (IPDP).  The  technical  feasibility  study  will  include  a \ndetailed  engineering  design  of  the  subproject,  cost  estimates,  contract  packages,  and \nimplementation  schedule.  The  RP  and  IEE  must  meet  the  requirements  of  the  resettlement \nframework  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  and  the  criteria  for  environmental  requirements  as \n\n\f9 \n\nin  accordance  with \n\ngiven  in  the  summary  IEE  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  and  environmental  assessment  and \nreview framework (Supplementary Appendix E). If indigenous people are affected, an IPDP will \nbe  prepared \nin \nSupplementary  Appendix  F.  POWERGRID  will  submit  an  appraisal  report  (format  provided  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  G)  to  ADB  for  consideration  and  approval  of  each  additional \nsubproject. ADB will not consider any subproject that does not satisfy all of the eligibility criteria \n(paras. 29 and 31) or where the above procedures have not been followed. \n \nC. \n\nindigenous  peoples  development \n\nSpecial Features \n\nframework \n\nthe \n\n32. \nProgrammatic  Approach.  ADB  has  adopted,  as  envisaged  in  the  2005\u20132007 country \nstrategy  and  program  update  (footnote  3),  a  programmatic  approach  by  providing  a  series  of \nloans to POWERGRID to help it implement its NTDP. The first phase, under the proposed loan, \ncovers  selected  subprojects  to  be  implemented  during  2005\u20132009.  Subject  to  continuing \nimprovement  of \nthe  policy  environment  and  corporate  governance,  and  satisfactory \nimplementation and timely disbursements of the first phase loan, future assistance will depend \non POWERGRID\u2019s borrowing program. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe  Project  consists  of  strengthening  and  augmenting  POWERGRID's  transmission \n33. \nlines and associated substations, which are part of POWERGRID's NTDP. The cost estimates \nof the three core subprojects, and additional subprojects to be implemented during 2005\u20132009 \nare summarized in Table 1.

POWERGRID\u2019s \n37. \norganizational  structure  (Appendix  7)  consists  of  (i)  a  corporate  center  at  the  head  office  in \nGurgaon  (in  the  state  of  Haryana)  that  is  responsible  for  overall  corporate  planning,  system \nplanning  and  engineering,  management  of  transmission  system  operations  and  projects, \nfinance, commercial matters, and personnel; and (ii) regional offices. POWERGRID has been \noperating with a healthy profit margin since its first full year of commercial operations that ended \non  31  March  1993.  Details  of  its  past  financial  performance  indicators,  historical  financial \nstatements,  financial  projections,  and  the  critical  assumptions  used  in  developing the financial \nprojections are provided in Appendix 8. \n \n38. \nThrough  ADB\u2019s  continued  assistance,  POWERGRID  has  strengthened  its  project \ndevelopment, implementation capability, fund mobilization capacity, and financial sustainability. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s competence as an executing agency has been demonstrated by the successful \nimplementation of the ongoing  Power  Transmission  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (footnote  5) \nas well as the earlier Power Transmission (Sector) Project (footnote 5), whose loan account was \nclosed  on  9  July  2003.  In  addition  to  experience  gained  with  POWERGRID  under  previous \nprojects,  assessment  of  the  financial  management  capacity  of  POWERGRID  (para.  23) \nindicates  that  POWERGRID  systems  and  financial  management  processes  are  sufficient for \npurposes of project financial management. \n \n\n2.  \n\nProject Management \n\n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  as  a  sector  loan  and  additional  subprojects  will  be \nconsidered  during  implementation.  A  draft  project  administration  memorandum  is  included  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. POWERGRID has set up a project management unit headed by an \nexecutive  director  (corporate  planning)  at  its  headquarters.  The  unit,  through  the  related \nfunctional  departments  of  POWERGRID,  will  be  responsible  for  processing  and  implementing \nthe  subprojects.  POWERGRID  has  seven  regional  offices  generally  headed  by  an  executive \ndirector  to  implement  the  subprojects  under  their  respective  jurisdiction.  The  deputy  general \nmanagers in the region responsible for construction and commissioning of the subprojects will \nreport  to  their  respective  regional  heads.  The  regional  heads  will  facilitate  submission  of  the \nimplementation  progress  reports.  The  management  of  POWERGRID  will  receive  monthly \nprogress reports and review each subproject in quarterly review meetings. In addition to ADB, \nthe  project  management  unit  will  maintain  regular  consultations  with  other  funding  agencies \nincluding  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  World  Bank  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n40. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years, inclusive of procurement and construction \nactivities,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  December  2009.  The  subprojects  will  be \nimplemented from January 2005 to June 2009. The implementation schedule of the three core \nsubprojects  that  have  secured  in-principle  approval  from  the  Government  is  given  in \nAppendix 9.  Advance  procurement  activities  for  the  three  core  subprojects  began  in  October \n2004. Unless otherwise acceptable to ADB, POWERGRID will submit for ADB's consideration \nnot  later  than  31  December  2005  the  appraisal  reports  for  additional  subprojects  to  be \nfinanced under the proposed loan. \n\n\f12 \n\n4.  \n\nProcurement \n\n \n41. \nEquipment and materials to be financed under the loan will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding will be used for supply \ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000,  international  shopping  for  contracts  from \n$100,000\u2013$500,000,  and  direct  purchase  arrangement  for  those  less  than  $100,000.  The \nagreed  upon  contract  package  list  for  the  three  core  subprojects,  which  will  attract \ninternational bidders, is given in Appendix 10. Contract packages and bid specifications have \nbeen prepared to ensure maximum competition under international competitive bidding. Similar \ncontractual  structures  and  specifications  will  be  applied  to  other  subprojects.  To  facilitate \ntimely  implementation  of  the  Project  and  based  on  POWERGRID\u2019s  effectiveness  in  handling \nprocurement  under  the  two  ADB-financed  projects,  POWERGRID  has  been  allowed  advance \nprocurement  action  for  eligible  subprojects.  POWERGRID  has  been  informed  that  approval  of \nadvance  procurement  action  does  not  in  any  way  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project. \nPOWERGRID has also been allowed to use the modified ADB bid documents applied under the \nSipat subproject along with the agreed modifications (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \n42. \nFor contracts to be awarded based on ICB procurement procedures, POWERGRID shall \nbe  exempted  from  ADB\u2019s  prior  review  of  its  bid  documents  provided  that  such  documents  are \nforwarded at the time of their release to ADB for post-facto approval, and POWERGRID issues \namendments to such documents based on comments made by ADB, if any, during the bidding \nperiod. Further, POWERGRID may also award contracts of value less than $3 million in each \ncase  without  seeking  approval  of  ADB,  provided  the  lowest  priced  bidder  is  also  the  lowest \nevaluated  bidder,  and  further  provided  that  (i)  all  cases  involving  unusual  issues  shall  be \nsubmitted to ADB for prior approval, and (ii) all cases shall be subject to post-facto approval of \nADB  which  shall  retain  the  right  to  disallow  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  in  case  it  is  unable  to \nagree with POWERGRID on either the bid documents or the bid evaluation report. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n43. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook, January 2001, and ADB's Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, July 2002, both as amended from time to time. No imprest account will \nbe required for disbursement under the loan. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n44. \nPOWERGRID  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project.  Within  6  months  of  the \nclose  of  the  financial  year,  POWERGRID  will  submit  (i)  annual  project  accounts,  with  detailed \ndescriptions  of  the  sources  of  receipts  and  expenditures;  and  (ii)  annual  financial  statements \ncomprising an income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and related notes to \nthe financial statement and consolidated for all of POWERGRID\u2019s operations. POWERGRID will \ncontinue  the  current  practice  of  hiring  independent  chartered  accountants  to  audit  its  annual \nfinancial  statements and  annual  project  accounts,  together  with  the  memorandum  on  issues \nidentified  during  the  audit  process  (i.e.,  management  letter).  These  will  be  submitted  with  the \nrespective  reports.  As  part  of  the  harmonization  of  procedures  of  development  agencies,  the \nauditors\u2019 terms of reference will be approved by ADB in consultation with the World Bank prior \nto  commencement  of  work.  The  accounts  will  be  prepared  using  accounting  standards  issued \nby  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India.  The  auditors  will  be  required  to  provide  an \nopinion on POWERGRID\u2019s compliance with ADB\u2019s financial covenants and indicate the details \n\n\f13 \n\nof the actual calculation for all ratios, in conformity with the definitions contained in the Loan and \nGuarantee Agreements. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n45. \nPOWERGRID will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit these to ADB within 45 \ndays  after  the  end  of  each  quarter.  These  reports  will  provide  a  narrative  description  of \nprogress made during the period, changes in implementation schedule, problems or difficulties \nencountered, and the work to be carried out in the next period. The progress reports will also \ninclude  a  summary  financial  account  for  the  project  components  including  subprojects, \nconsisting  of  project  expenditures  including  for  subprojects  during  the  period,  and  total \nexpenditure  to  date,  and  benefit  monitoring  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project Performance \nManagement Systems Handbook. Performance will be evaluated on the basis of performance \nindicators/targets stipulated in the Project Framework (Appendix 5). \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n46. \nADB  will  field  a  project  inception  mission  soon  after  loan  approval  to  initiate \nimplementation.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  and  operation  of  the  Project  based  on \nquarterly  progress  reports  and  meet  with  POWERGRID  and  the  Government  semiannually  to \ndiscuss project progress. A midterm review to be carried out 2 years after loan effectiveness will \nfocus  on  the  engineering,  resettlement,  environment,  and  other  social  aspects  of  the  Project; \nand review the financial status of POWERGRID. Representatives of ADB and POWERGRID will \ntake part in the review. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure \nsuccessful  project  implementation  and  achievement  of  objectives. A project completion report \nwill be submitted within 3 months following project completion.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n47. \nBased on the findings of an initial poverty reduction and social assessment carried out \nduring  project  preparation,  a  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  was  developed \n(Appendix 11). The Project is classified as sustainable economic growth. During project design, \nthe participatory approach included consultation with local governments and communities. \n \nA. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\nCore  Subprojects:  The  three  core  subprojects  include  construction  of  five  new \n48. \nsubstations  in  the  states  of  Tamil  Nadu  and  Andhra  Pradesh,  and  the  Union  Territory  of \nPondicherry; all entail land acquisition. A full RP (Supplementary Appendix J) for the three core \nsubprojects  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy of  Involuntary Resettlement 1995 \nand  is  based  on  all  land  needed  to  be  acquired  for  construction  of  the  five  substations.  The \nentitlement  benefits  are  summarized  in  the  summary  resettlement  framework  (Appendix  12). \nAccording  to  the  RP,  the  Project  will  acquire  a  total  of  186  acres  of  land,  of  which  19  are \ngovernment  land,  98  are  private  land,  and  the  remaining  69  belong  to  Tamil  Nadu  Hindu \nReligious Endowment Board. An  estimated 40 households previously cultivated these 69 acres \nand  the  acquisition  would  adversely  affect  their  livelihood.  However,  this  land  has  not  been \nunder  cultivation  for  the  last  4\u20135  years  due  to  inadequate  rainfall  and  no  irrigation  facilities. \nDespite this, the land remains arable and affected families can cultivate if rainfall is adequate. \nThese  households  will  be  entitled  to  rehabilitation  assistance  preferably  in  income-generating \nschemes  depending  upon  their  aptitude/skills  or  alternatively  they  may  be  offered  units  of \nequivalent financial reimbursement in the joint names of the spouses under a monthly income \n\n\f14 \n\nscheme  for  regular  income.  Apart  from  this,  POWERGRID  will  fund  short  and  needs-based \ntraining  to  develop  entrepreneurship  skills  required  for successful implementation of selected \nincome-generating schemes for affected households. \n \nIn  addition,  the  substation  construction  in  Karmatthapuram  Village  in  Arasur  (Tamil \n49. \nNadu) will result in loss of a temple and will partially affect a pond currently used by villagers for \nsanitation  purposes.  The  villagers  will  be  entitled  to  replacement/augmentation  of  common \nproperty resources/amenities that will be carried out in consultation with affected people.  Land \nacquisition for the three core  subprojects will affect an estimated 82 households, comprising 42 \ntitleholders and 40 households without formal titles. The land acquisition will not adversely affect \nany  commercial  or  residential  structures.  In  keeping  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  1995  and  POWERGRID\u2019s  ESPP,  technical  design  for  the  proposed  five \nsubstations  was  adjusted  to  avoid  or  to  minimize  impacts  especially  if  homestead  land  and \nhouses could be completely avoided.  \n \n50. \nThe  RP  provides  details  on  the  subproject  impacts  and  measures  proposed  for \nmitigation.  As  per  the  entitlement  matrix,  key  measures  include  compensation  at  full \nreplacement  cost  for  all  lost  assets.  In  addition  to  payments  by  competent  authority,  affected \npeople  will  receive  grants  to  meet  replacement costs of lost assets, transaction costs such as \nstamps and registration costs (in case of purchase of replacement land), and other cash grants \nand  resettlement  assistance  such  as  compensation  for  loss  of  standing  crops  and  trees. \nHouseholds headed by women and other vulnerable households will be eligible for assistance in \naccordance with entitlements detailed in the RP.  \n \nThe detailed field surveys undertaken to assess the socioeconomic profile of the project \n51. \ncommunities did not find any  scheduled tribes 11 or indigenous people and groups in the project \narea.  Socioeconomic  data  suggest  that  the  majority  population  in  the  project  area  comprises \nother  disadvantaged  groups,12  followed  by  scheduled  caste13  groups,  and  general  population. \nAs  a  result,  the  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  adverse  or  differential  impacts  on \nindigenous people.  \n \n52. \nindigenous  peoples \ndevelopment  framework  were  prepared  and  will  serve  as  basis  for  preparing  subsequent \nresettlement plans and IPDPs for additional subprojects as required. All plans will be prepared \nin full consultation with affected persons and disclosed in draft form to them. The resettlement \nframework  and  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  was  placed  on  the  ADB  website \nbefore submission of the Project for ADB Board approval.  \n \nB. \n\nNoncore  Subprojects:  A  resettlement \n\nframework  and  an \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nThe  core  subproject  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Union  Territory  of \n53. \nPondicherry  are  among  the  better-off  areas  in  the  country  in  terms  of  per  capita  income, \neconomic  growth,  and  human  and  social  development.  The  National  Human  Development \n\n                                                 \n11 \u201cScheduled tribes\u201d are one of the weaker sections of the Indian Population. Article 342 of Constitution of India on \nfundamental rights defines scheduled tribes as a \u201cspecific tribe or tribal communities or parts or groups within tribes \nor tribal communities.\u201d The Constitution enshrines their rights taking into account their vulnerable status in society. \n12 The other low-ranking and disadvantaged groups (besides the scheduled tribes ) in India are referred to as Other \nBackward  Classes.  Discrimination  against  these  backward  classes  is  prohibited  by  Article  15  of  the  Indian \nconstitution. The backward classes reportedly constitute an estimated 52% of India's population.  \n\n13 Similarly, \u201dscheduled caste\u201d is defined as the lowest caste in the Hindu caste system. Untouchables, also known as \n\nHarijans or Dalits, constitute the bulk of scheduled castes. \n\n\f15 \n\nReport 2001 ranks the state of Andhra Pradesh 10th among the 15 major states calculated in \nterms  of  human  development  indices,  with  about  16%  of  the  state  population  living  below  the \npoverty line (1999\u20132000) in comparison with national data of about 26%. On the other hand, the \nstate of Tamil Nadu is ranked 3rd out of 15 states calculated. In general, Tamil Nadu has been \nsuccessful in its overall efforts to address poverty, and the proportion of those living below the \npoverty line fell from over 35% in 1993\u20131994 to about 21% in 1999\u20132000. Similarly in the Union \nTerritory of Pondicherry, poverty levels were estimated at about 37% (1993\u20131994) and 21.67% \n(1999\u20132000).14 In all three areas, the proportion of people living below the poverty line has been \ndrastically  reduced,  with  the  poverty  levels  in  the  three  areas  largely  lower  than  the  national \naverage.15 However, in spite of this impressive performance, poverty remains pervasive with a \nlarge  section  of  the  population  (scheduled  castes/tribes,  minorities,  women)  who  have  not \nbenefited from the economic and social development that the areas have experienced. \n \n54. \nBy strengthening and developing the national transmission grid, the Project is expected \nto result in efficient and more reliable delivery of services to consumers, particularly benefiting \nindustrial,  commercial,  residential,  and  agriculture  customers  in  the  country.  In  addition,  by \ninducing  industrial  and  commercial  activity,  the  Project  will  create  more  job  opportunities  and \nimprove productivity and quality of outputs in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, leading \nto  enhanced  production  and  national  economic  growth  that  will  increase  employment  and \nincome-earning opportunities for the poor. The Project will remove transmission bottlenecks and \nreduce transmission losses, thereby making more electricity available to increase electrification \noutreach. This will facilitate employment creation and income-generating opportunities for poor \npeople  living  in  areas  previously  without  access  to  electricity.  The  Project  will  provide \nemployment  for  poor  people  during  construction.  In  addition,  poor  and  vulnerable  consumers \nwho are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality \nwill benefit from the Project. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n55. \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  a  \u201cB\u201d  project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nAssessment  Guidelines  2003.  The  three  core  subprojects,  comprising  transmission  lines  and \nassociated  substations  involving  mostly  wasteland,  and  agricultural  and  grazing  land  and \navoiding  forestland,  is  not  subject  to  the  India  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Notification \n(1994). The  IEE, which included an environmental management plan with budget for the three \ncore  subprojects,  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines 2003.  Based  on  the  environmental  assessments  and  walkover  surveys  conducted \nfor  the  scope  of  activities  under  the  three  core  subprojects,  the  associated  potential  adverse \nenvironmental impacts can be mitigated to an acceptable level by adequate implementation of \nthe  measures  outlined  in  the  summary  IEE  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  The  environmental \nanalysis  is  presented  in  Appendix  13.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix E to guide preparation of IEEs for additional subprojects. \nAny additional subproject confirmed by ADB as environmentally  B sensitive will require that the \nsummary IEE be made available to the general public at least 120 days before the subproject is \napproved by ADB. \n\n56. \nThe  total  length  of  transmission  lines  under  the  three  core  subprojects  is  about  570 \nkilometers (km); they pass through wasteland, agricultural land, and grazing land. No sections \n\n                                                 \n14  Government of India. 2002. National Human Development Report 2001. New Delhi. \n15  As per the National Human Development Report, 26% of India\u2019s population lived below the poverty line in 1999\u2013\n\n2000. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nof the proposed alignments pass  through forest or ecologically sensitive areas. No endangered, \nrare,  or  threatened  species  of  flora  or  fauna  have  been  reported  in  the  core  subproject sites. \nThe substations are located mostly on state government-owned land. The land acquired for the \nnew substations will not dislocate any ongoing agricultural activity or pass through any built-up \nareas. POWERGRID will prepare and implement the  IEE and the related EMP (with budget) for \neach subproject. \n \n57. \nPOWERGRID  has  discontinued  procurement  of  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs) \ntransformer  oil;  pure  hydrocarbon  mineral  oil  is  specified  in  the  bidding  documents. \nPOWERGRID  will  comply  with  India's  Environmental  Protection  Act  and  other  applicable \nregulations  for  the  handling  of  used  transformer  oil,  which  will  be  collected  and  reclaimed  by \nauthorized  contractors.  POWERGRID  has  set  up  regional  testing  laboratories  for  testing  of \nexisting oil for PCB traces. No significant concentrations of PCBs have been detected. \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Assessment \n\nAnalysis  of  economic  viability \n\nthe \ninvolved \n58. \ninvestments (about $12.6 billion) in the transmission sector as per the NTDP between 2002 and \n2012.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  about  31%  was  calculated  on  the  basis  of \nincremental costs and incremental benefits. This and sensitivity analysis, under various adverse \nscenarios, confirm viability of POWERGRID\u2019s overall investment for the sector. Details of these \nanalyses are in Supplementary Appendix K, and a summary is presented in Appendix 14. \n \nE. \n\ntwo  scenarios\u2014with  and  without \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n59. \nPOWERGRID  prepared  financial  projections  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects to assess the financial viability \nand  sustainability  of  the  entire  NTDP  (2002\u20132012)  using  a  time-slice  approach  (Appendix  8). \nBased  on  the  financial  projections,  a  long-term  debt-equity  ratio  of  65:35  or  better  will  be \nachieved over the life of the Project. \n \n60. \nThe  financial  evaluation  of  NTDP  (2002\u20132012)  was  undertaken  in  real  terms  using \nconstant 2004 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were \nconverted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation \nand currency fluctuation. Incremental benefits and costs were derived by evaluating the financial \nposition of POWERGRID under with- and without-NTDP scenarios. The financial internal rate of \nreturn,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  7.9%.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted \naverage cost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis, of 4.5%.  Sensitivity analysis was \nrun  for  a  10%  increase  in  project  cost  and  1-year  delay  in  project  implementation  with  a  10% \nincrease  in  project  cost  that  resulted  in  financial  internal  rates  of  return  of  6.7%  and  6.2%, \nrespectively.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  indicates  that  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is \nrobust under adverse conditions. Therefore, the Project is considered both financially viable and \nsustainable as summarized in Appendix 14; details are in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nF. \n\nRisks \n\n61. \nThe  disparity  of  investments  in  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution may \nresult  in  some  of  the  national  transmission  grid  capacity  not  operating  at  full  capacity. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  NTDP  is  based  on  the  sequencing  of  generation  plants  in  the  least-cost \ngeneration expansion plan developed by the Central Electricity Authority that assumes a certain \npattern of load growth. However, the SEBs that are in poor financial health may not be capable \n\n\f17 \n\nof adequately investing in associated state transmission and distribution networks. To mitigate \nthis  potential  risk,  subprojects  have  been  carefully  chosen  to  ensure  that  investments  in  the \nnational  transmission  grid  are  properly  planned  and  sequenced  vis-\u00e0-vis  generation  and  the \nSEBs\u2019 transmission and distribution investments. \n \n62. \nAlthough the policy environment has been conducive for continuing policy reforms for a \nmore effective power sector, firm political commitment to the power sector reforms is assumed \nto  continue.  A  second  assumption  is  that  the  recently  enacted  Electricity  Act  2003,  especially \nthe provision of open transmission access and development of a national power trading market, \nwill  be  implemented  in  a  transparent  and  timely  manner  to  create  a  predictable  and  enabling \npolicy framework and regulatory process in the power sector to increase competition and attract \nincreased private sector participation. Any price increase in steel and aluminum, which comprise \nmajor components of the transmission system, will increase the estimated cost of the Project. \nHowever,  the  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  is  economically  robust  even  with \nincreases  in  steel  and  aluminum  prices.  POWERGRID  is  expected  to  provide  adequate  funds \nfor operation and maintenance of the Project. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  POWERGRID  have  given  the \n\n63. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n1. \n\nImplementation  \n\n \nPOWERGRID  will  be  responsible  for  the  planning,  design  and  procurement  under  the \n64. \nProject  as  well  as  coordination  of  the  Project.

POWERGRID  will  share,  upon  completion,  the  outcome  of  the  detailed  reviews  on \nPOWERGRID  with  respect  to  (i)  corporate  governance  and  financial  accountability,  (ii) \nsafeguard management (environmental and social), and (iii) procurement management. \n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Matters  \n\n \n76.  POWERGRID will ensure that the  Project  is  undertaken  and  all  subproject  facilities  are \noperated and maintained, in accordance  with  all  applicable  laws,  rules  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy 2002, prepare and implement for each subproject, \nthe  IEE  (including  related  environmental  management  plan  [EMP]  with  budget)  in  accordance \nwith said Policy and the Environmental Assessment and Review Framework in Supplementary \nAppendix E.  \n \n77.  Environment Category \u201cB Sensitive\u201d subprojects will be avoided to the extent possible. All \nadditional  subprojects  will  be  subject  to  ADB  classification,  and  any  subprojects  deemed \n\u201csensitive\u201d will require justification and documentation that anticipated impacts can be effectively \nmitigated.   \n \n78.  POWERGRID will ensure that all necessary environmental clearances are obtained from \nthe relevant statutory authorities of the Government and all environmental mitigation measures \nset forth in the IEE (including related EMP with budget) for each subproject are incorporated  in \ndetailed  designs  (including  any  amendments  on  account  of  detailed  designs  with  prior  ADB \napproval) and followed during construction and operation of the subprojects. POWERGRID will \nmonitor,  audit,  and  report  quarterly,  the  implementation  of  the  IEE    (including  the  EMP  with \nbudget) for each subproject to ADB.  \n \n79.  POWERGRID will  not  undertake  any  works  in  any  stretch  of  transmission  lines  passing \nthrough  reserve  forests  or  other  forestland  unless  the  required  forest  and  environmental \nclearances are obtained from the Government\u2019s Ministry of Forest and Environment. \n \n\n\f19 \n\n80.  POWERGRID  will  use  only  PCB-free  transformers  for  all  the  substations  renovated \nand/or established under the Project.  \n \n81.  POWERGRID  will  install  oil  separators  (oil  traps)  in  all  outlets  of  the  sewers  of \nsubstations.  The  sludge  of  oil  trapped  by  the  separator  will  be  kept  in  safe  place  (e.g.  using \ndrums) within the property of the substation and will be sold only to the authorized third parties, \nin accordance with applicable laws and regulations of India. \n \n82.  POWERGRID,  through  its  Environmental  and  Social  Management  Department  (ESMD) \nwill  undertake  routine  monitoring  to  check  the  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures \nrecommended by the IEE (including the EMP with budget) for each subproject. \n \n\n6. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n \n83.  POWERGRID will ensure that all land and rights-of way required by the subprojects will \nbe made available in a timely manner and that the provisions of the Resettlement Plan (RP) for \neach subproject as agreed with ADB (including any changes on account of detailed designs with \nprior  approval  of  ADB),  including  compensation  and  entitlements  for  affected  households  and \npersons, will be implemented in accordance with the  RP for each subproject, and in conformity \nwith  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement 1995 and the Resettlement Framework. \n   \n84.  POWERGRID  will  ensure  that  people  affected  by  each  subproject  are  consulted  and \nfairly compensated in a timely manner in accordance with the related RPs, such that their living \nstandards are not adversely affected. POWERGRID will submit progress and completion reports \non land acquisition and resettlement under the quarterly progress reports for each subproject. \n \n85.  POWERGRID  will  ensure  that  prior  to  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  under  each \nsubproject, the related RP including its update is disclosed with all necessary information made \navailable to persons affected by the subproject and confirm that it be posted on ADB web site. \nPOWERGRID  will  ensure  that  essential  public  infrastructure  that  may  be  affected  under  land \nacquisition and resettlement is replaced as appropriate in an expeditious manner in  accordance \nwith  the  related  RPs.  As  a  condition  for  award  of  civil  works  contracts  under  each  additional \nsubproject,  prior  to  such  award,  POWERGRID  will  have  disclosed  through  appropriate \nmeasures, the draft RP to persons affected by the subproject, and submitted the same to ADB \nfor review and obtained its approval. \n \n86. \nThe  following  principles  shall  apply  under  each  subproject  for  the  entitlements  and \ncompensation of households and persons affected by the Program: (i) POWERGRID will ensure \nthat  all  compensation  payments  shall  be  made  to  affected  households  and  persons  prior  to \ncommencement  of  civil  works,  in  accordance  with  the  related  RP;  and  (ii)  POWERGRID  will \nensure  that  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  scheduled  tribes,  scheduled  castes,  vulnerable \nhouseholds,  and  female-headed  households  will  be  provided  with  additional  assistance  as \nprovided for in the entitlement matrix in the related RP.  \n \n87. \nFor  each  subproject,  POWERGRID  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  budget  for  land \nacquisition  and  other  activities  outlined  in  the  related  RP  and  will  meet  any  unforeseen \nobligations in excess of the RP budget estimate in order to satisfy the RP requirements. \n \n88.  POWERGRID will set up a social, resettlement, and environment implementation unit  for \neach  subproject.  These  units  will  be  responsible  for  timely  and  effective  implementation  and \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nsupervision of RPs, the IEE (including the EMP with budget), the IPDP (if any), and other social \nissues  for  each  subproject.  The  units  will  be  assisted,  as  required,  by  local  community-based \norganizations,  to  be  engaged  for  field  implementation  of  the  related  RPs  and  IPDP,  if  any,  for \neach subproject. \n \n89.  By not later than  3 months of Loan  effectiveness for the core subprojects , and at least 2 \nmonths  prior  to  the  commencement  of  civil  works  under  each  additional  subproject, \nPOWERGRID  will  engage  an  independent  individual  expert  in  consultation  with  ADB  for \nmonitoring  and  verification  of  the  RP  implementation  under  each  subproject.  The  independent \nexperts  will  be  responsible  for  providing  ADB  through  POWERGRID,  regular  semi-annual \nmonitoring and evaluation reports on resettlement implementation.  \n \n\n7. \n\nOther Social Issues  \n\n \n90.  Within  3  months  of  Loan  effectiveness,  POWERGRID  will  also  establish  a  grievance \nredress  committee  under  each  core  subproject  in  accordance  with  the  related  RP.  Similarly \nPOWERGRID will establish prior to commencement of civil works, for each additional subproject \na  grievance  redress  committee,  in  accordance  with  the  related  RP. Such committees will be \nresponsible  for  addressing  any  grievances  from  affected  peoples  concerning  resettlement, \nenvironment and other social issues in a timely manner. \n \n91. \nPOWERGRID will ensure that contracts under the Project incorporate provisions to the \neffect  that  contractors  (i)  will  not  use  children  as  labor;  and  (ii)  will  follow  legally-mandated \nprovisions  of  labor  (including  equal  pay  for  equal  work),  health,  safety,  sanitation  and  working \nconditions.  The  contracts  will  also  provide  for termination of the contracts by POWERGRID in \ncase of breach of any of the stated provisions by the contractors. \n \n\n8. \n\nAmendments  to  Loan  Agreements  (Loan  1764:  Power  Transmission \nImprovement [Sector] Project and Loan 1405: Power Transmission [Sector] \nProject) \n\n \n92. \nAmendments under the Loan Agreement for the proposed Loan, to the Loan Agreements \nfor  the  referred  Loans  1764  and  1405  (footnote  5)  reflect  changes  (i)  in  rights  of  POWERGRID \nwith delinquent SEBs/other beneficiaries, (ii) functioning of POWERGRID as central transmission \nutility under the Electricity Act of 2003, (iii) accounts receivables to be in accordance with CERC \nallowables, (iv) irrevocable letters of credit to be obtained by POWERGRID, (v) deletion of debt \nservice coverage ratio and substitution with assurance under para. 71. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n93. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$400,000,000  to  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited,  to  be  guaranteed  by  India,  for  the \nPower Grid Transmission (Sector) Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  20  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and \nGuarantee Agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n26 November 2004 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nAs  electricity  is  one  of  the  key  drivers  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  the \nGovernment  has  set  the  target  of  installing  additional  100,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  generation \ncapacity  to  provide  electricity  access  to  all  households  by  2012  as  stated  in  its  National \nElectricity Policy. The total power generation capacity available to the grid was 112,000 MW as \nof  31  March  2004,  consisting  of  29,500  MW  of  hydro,  77,910  MW  of  thermal,  2,720  MW  of \nnuclear, and 1,870 MW of wind. State electricity boards (SEBs) own 62% of the total installed \ncapacity,  while  the  private  and  the  central  sector  own  12%  and  26%,  respectively.  As  of  31 \nMarch  2004,  the  peak  power  deficit  was  about  11%  (9,510  MW)  and  energy  deficit about 7% \n(39,870  gigawatt  hours  [GWh]).  The  per  capita  electricity  consumption  stood  at  567 kilowatt-\nhours  (kWh)  as  of  March  2003  with  about  84%  of  villages  but  only  about  31%  of  rural \nhouseholds  electrified.  Quality  of  power  is  poor,  with  frequent  load  shedding  (rationing)  and \nsignificant  voltage \nindustry  competitiveness  and  severely \nconstrains  economic  growth.  The  power  system  comprises  five  interconnected  electrical \nregions, namely, northern, north eastern, eastern, western, and southern. Each electrical region \ncomprises interconnection of power systems of neighboring states. \n \n2. \nThe  major  portion  of  coal-based  generation  potential  is  in  the  states  of  Bihar  and \nJharkhand  in  the  eastern  region,  Madhya  Pradesh/Chattisgarh  in  the  western  region;  while \nhydro potential is in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, and Kashmir, and Uttaranchal in \nthe northern region as well as Arunachal Pradesh in the northeastern region. Generating power \nat large pit-head generating stations and transmitting electricity to far-off load centers has more \nadvantages  than  transporting  coal.  To  ensure  reliable  and  secured  delivery  of  power  from \ngeneration projects to the end users, development of an adequate transmission system is vital. \n \nA. \n\nGeneration Capacity, Demand, and Deficit \n\nfluctuation.

By  the  end  of  the  10th  Plan,  the \neastern  and  northeastern  regions  will  have  surplus  power,  while  the  northern,  western,  and \nsouthern  regions  will  be  in  a  deficit  situation.  Considering the generation addition program for \nthe  next  5\u20136  years,  the  surplus  power  in  the  eastern  and  northeastern  regions  will  be  about \n10,000  MW  and  300  MW,  respectively;  whereas  the  northern,  western,  and  southern  regions \nwill  need  to  import  power  to  a  large  extent  from  the  eastern  region  to  reduce  their  deficit \nsituation.

Grid strengthening is urgently needed to facilitate export from \nthe surplus regions to the deficit regions. \n \nThe existing national transmission grid is hybrid in nature, comprising 400 kV and high \n6. \nvoltage  direct  current  lines  along  with  several  400  kV  touch  points  spread  over  the  entire \ncountry.  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited  (POWERGRID)  currently  operates  about \n48,000 circuit kilometers of extra-high voltage power transmission lines of 400 kV (existing 765 \nkV  lines  are  energized  at  400  kV)  and  82  extra-high  voltage  substations  with  a  total \ntransformation  capacity  of  about  46,500  megavolt-ampere.  The  capacity  of  interregional \ntransmission links is shown in Table A1.3. \n \n\nTable A1.3: Capacity of Inter-Regional Transmission Links \n(megawatts) \n\nBetween Regions \n\nExisting Capacity   Capacity in 2012 \n\nEastern and Northern \nEastern and Western \nEastern and Southern \nEastern and Northeastern \nWestern and Northern \nWestern and Southern \n\nTotal \n\n650 \n1,650 \n2,650 \n1,000 \n900 \n1,200 \n8,050 \n\n12,350 \n6,550 \n3,150 \n1,000 \n5,800 \n1,200 \n30,050 \n\n \n\nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \n\n \n \nAccording  to  the  least-cost  generation  expansion  program  and  demand  projection  for \n7. \ndifferent  regions,  the  eastern  region  would  be  the  major  power  exporter  for  other  regions. \nTherefore,  development  of  strong  interregional  links  interconnecting  the  eastern  region  to  all \nother regions would be needed. By 2012, the eastern, western, and northern regions could be \ninterconnected  by  a  high  capacity  765  kV  ring,  while  the  southern  region  would  remain \ninterconnected  in  asynchronous  mode.  This  would  ultimately  form  the  national  transmission \ngrid. Table A1.3 shows the projected capacity of interregional transmission links in 2012. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\nC. \n\nState Transmission and Distribution  \n\n8. \nThe  organization  of  the  power  sector  is  determined  by  the  country's  dual  political \nstructure, so that all major issues affecting the sector require concurrent action by the central \nand  state  governments.  SEBs  are  under  the  administrative  control  of  the  respective  state \nministry  of  power  or  department  of  power.  SEBs  now  account  for  approximately  80%  of \ncommercial electricity sales. However, most state governments use SEBs to provide low tariffs \nfor  agricultural  and  residential  consumers,  and  to  provide  employment  to  attract  political \nsupport. The consolidated rate of return on net fixed assets of SEBs has been negative and is \ndeteriorating rapidly due mainly to low agriculture tariff, low cost recovery, and high transmission \nand distribution (T&D) losses. \n \nThe world average T&D loss is about 10\u201315%, while India\u2019s T&D loss as of March 2003 \n9. \nwas  about  33%.  However,  in  the  absence  of  adequate  metering  arrangements, especially for \nagricultural consumers, part of the losses were treated as agricultural consumption. The actual \nlosses are, therefore, thought to be much higher, with some SEBs now reporting T&D losses as \nhigh  as  45\u201355%.  The  major  reasons  for  such  high  losses  are  pilferage  of  energy  through \nunauthorized  connections  and  tampering  of  meters,  and  technical  losses  originating  from \noverloaded distribution networks. \n \nThe  financial  health  of  SEBs  has  become  a  matter  of  concern  for  central  and  state \n10. \ngovernments,  considering  that  their  losses  have  reached  an  alarming  level  of  Rs330  billion, \nwhich is equivalent to about 1.5% of gross domestic product. The accumulation of outstanding \ndues to the central power utilities such as National Thermal Power Corporation, National Hydro \nPower  Corporation,  and  POWERGRID  has  grown  to  over  Rs400  billion.  Thus,  poor  credit \nworthiness  of  SEBs  has  considerably  slowed  private  sector  investments,  despite  the  central \nGovernment\u2019s  enabling  and  encouraging  framework.  Consequently,  the  Government  has \nformulated  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform  Program  to  bring  the  reforms  to \nthe  distribution  level  with  an  overall  objective  of  reducing  T&D  losses  to  15%.  The  Ministry  of \nPower has signed agreements with 24 states to expedite the process of reforms under program \nincentives.  The  agreements  provide  for  metering  of  all  11  kV  feeders,  100%  metering  of \nconsumers,  energy  audit,  reduction  of  T&D  losses,  and  attaining  commercial  viability  of \ndistribution. \n \n11. \nSEBs  will  have  to  fund  corresponding  strengthening  and  expansion  of  their  own  state \ntransmission  and  distribution  networks  if  they  are  to  reap  the  full  benefits  of  investments  in \nadditional  generation  capacity,  and  strengthening and expansion of the national transmission \ngrid.  Unless  reforms  are  undertaken  by  SEBs  in  a  timely  manner  to  improve  their  financial \nsustainability, inadequate state transmission and distribution facilities may continue to constrain \neconomic growth and hamper electricity access to all households by 2012. \n \n12. \nThe  Energy  Conservation  Act  2001  gives  the  central  and  state  governments  the \nrequisite statutory powers to promote and enforce a progressive regime of energy conservation. \nThe  10th  Plan  targets  energy  saving  of  95,000  GWh,  mainly  from  the  industry  and  agriculture \nsectors using energy efficient equipment.  \n\n\f        \n\n        \n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n4\n\n \n\n \n\nA\n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\ne\n\nn\n\nn\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni\n\ni\n\nx\n\nx\n\n \n\n \n\n2\n\n2\n\n \n\n \n\nEastern \n\nRegional System Coordination and Control\n\n1998\n\n2005\n\n2,501\n\nNATIONAL TRANSMISSION DEVELOPMENT PLAN\n\n        \n\n         Scheduled Date\n\nStart\n\nCompletion\n\nCapital Investment\n2002-2012 \n(Rs Million)\n\n2\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\nRegion\n\nType\n\nProject\n\nCentral\nFacilities\n\nGrid Strengthening Project\n\nBihar Grid Strengthening\nLILO of Kolaghat-Rengali at Baripada\n400 kV Kahalgaon-Biharsariff D/C - Second Circuit\nLILO of  Rangit-Siliguri at Gangtok\nLILO of Siliguri-Gangtok at Melli\nSystem Strengthening Scheme for ER (supplementary scheme to Tala)   \nSecond Interconnecting Transformer at Indravati\nER Strengthening Scheme\nJamshedpur-Rourkela 400 kV S/C\n\nInterregional Links\nSasaram-Biharsariff  HVDC Back to Back (500 MW)\nInterregional System Strengthening-I\n\n \n\n \n\nNHPC\n \n\nNTPC\n\nTransmission System Associated with Kahalgaon-II ( Phase-I)\n\nTransmission System Associated with Kahalgaon-II ( Phase-II)\n\nTransmission System Associated with Barh\n\nTransmission System Associated with North Karanpura\n\nTransmission System for Teesta-V (510MW);

In  2001,  the  Government  transferred  the  transmission  tariff \nsetting responsibility to  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission (CERC), which passed the \ncurrent  tariff  procedures  with  effect  from  1 April  2004.  POWERGRID  now  computes  its  tariff \nbased on full cos t recovery of the loan capital (debt-equity of 70:30); depreciation (straight line); \nreturn on equity (14%); operation and maintenance expenses (based on fixed coefficient\u2014about \n$500 per circuit-km, and $65,000 per bay); and interest (based on short-term rates of the State \nBank  of  India)  on  working  capital.  State  electricity  boards  (SEBs)  are  billed  fixed  monthly \navailability charges irrespective of the level of transmission capacity used.  \n \nUntil  2003,  collection  of  accounts  receivables  from  SEBs  had  been  the  major  financial \n3. \nconcern for POWERGRID. Recognizing that rising past dues of SEBs to POWERGRID are no \nlonger  sustainable,  and  restoration  of  financial  viability  of  SEBs  is  essential,  the  Government \ndecided  on  a  one-time  settlement  of  outstanding  SEB  dues.  In  March  2003,  by  setting  30 \nSeptember  2001  as  the  cut-off  date,  the  outstanding  accounts  receivable  amounting  to  about \nRs12  billion  was  securitized  by  tax-free  bonds  issued  by  Reserve  Bank  of  India  with  a  5-year \ngrace  period  paid  semiannually.  Currently  outstanding  accounts  receivable  are  2.4  months  of \nthe equivalent sales. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n39 \n\nB. \n\nCompliance with Current Loan Covenants \n\n4. \nTwo Asian Development Bank loans involving POWERGRID (footnote 5) have five major \ncovenants  (self-financing  ratio,  debt-equity  ratio,  debt  service  coverage  ratio,  outstanding \naccounts receivable, and negative pledge). With regard to these covenants POWERGRID has \ncomplied with the debt-equity ratio, while facing some issues with in compliance with others.  \n \n5. \nPOWERGRID  is  required  to  generate  resources  from  internal  sources  amounting  to  at \nleast 20% of the average annual capital expenditure for the preceding, current, and succeeding \nfiscal year. POWERGRID\u2019s self-financing ratio fluctuated significantly between 1998/99 to 2003-\n2004  due  to  high  investments  that  resulted  in  high  amounts  of  assets  under  construction,  low \ncash flows from operations because of slow payments from SEBs, and bonds structured with a \nsingle payment mechanism (100% of the principal paid in the year of maturity).  \n \n6. \nPOWERGRID is required to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 in all \nfuture years as defined in the Loan Agreement. The definition requires income from operations \nfor  the  immediately  preceding  fiscal  year  or  the  immediately  preceding  12  months,  before  the \nproposed  debt  is  to  be  considered  as  the  base,  while  debt  to  be  serviced  would  include \nobligations for all debt  including  the  debt  to  be  incurred.  POWERGRID  has  generally  been  in \ncompliance with this covenant.  \n \n7. \nThe  Power  Transmission  (Sector)  Project  requires  POWERGRID  to  maintain  an \naggregate outstanding accounts receivable equal  to the billing for the preceding 2 months. This \nwas not complied with as most SEBs were chronic defaulters and often ran arrears of up to 12 \nmonths.  Consequently,  the  covenant  was  revised  under  the  onging  Power  Transmission \nImprovement (Sector) Project to  stipulate  that,  if  the  60-day condition could not be complied \nwith,  POWERGRID  should  hold  irrevocable  letters  of  credit  for  at  least  65%  of  the  average \nmonthly invoicing. POWERGRID has been complying with the revised covenant.  \n \n8. \nThe  ongoing  loan  requires  the  Government  to  appoint  at  least  three  nongovernment \ndirectors  to  POWERGRID's  board  of  directors.  The  Government  has  already  commenced  the \nprocess  of  appointing  the  replacement  directors.  The  Government  and  POWERGRID  are \nconscious  of  the  need  to  act  quickly  as  the  nongovernment  directors  on  the  board  are  also  a \nrequirement of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. \n \n9. \nThe  two  previous  ADB  loans  (footnote  5)  to  POWERGRID  have  a  negative  pledge \ncovenant  relating  to  its  borrowings.  The  negative  pledge  clause  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility is only applicable to foreign currency borrowings. In order to maintain the existing \nrelationship  with  ADB,  and  not  only  secure  but  also  deepen  ADB\u2019s  future  involvement  in  its \ninvestment  program,  POWERGRID,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  has  taken  action  to  obtain  the \nconsent  of  the  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  and  Bank  of  India, \nCayman Islands to cede a pari passu charge so that the charge to be created in favor of ADB \nshall  rank  equally  and  ratably  to  their  loans  to  secure  the  payment  of  principal  of  and  interest \nand other charges on the two previous ADB loans. Given the steps needed to meet the negative \npledge  requirement  subsequent  to  the  positive  actions  by  POWERGRID,  it  is  expected  that \ncompletion of the process will be achieved by 30 June 2005. A Board Paper was circulated on \n19  November  2004  seeking  waiver  of  the  negative  pledge  covenant  under  the  two  previous \nloans  to  POWERGRID  with  respect  to  its  domestic  borrowings  in  order  to  harmonize  the \nnegative  pledge  conditions  in  those  two  loans  with  the  current  LIBOR-based loan regulations. \nPOWERGRID  has  been  operating  profitably  since  its  first  year  of  commercial  operations  that \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nended  31  March  1993.  Since  the  commencement  of  ADB  lending  in  1996,  POWERGRID  has \nconsistently met all its debt service obligations.   \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\n1. \n\nGeneral \n\n \n10. \nDomestic inflation rates were assumed to be 4.8% through out the projections from year \nending 2003/04. The cumulative capital expenditure to be made by POWERRGRID during the \nimplementation  of  its  NTDP  amounts  to  Rs565  billion  ($12.6  billion).  The  debt-equity ratio for \nADB-financed  projects  is  considered  as  70:30.  For  the  NTDP,  internal  resources  have  been \nconsidered as 20% of capital investment until 2008/09 and 30% from 2009/10.  \n \n\n2. \n\nIncome Statement Assumptions \n\n \n11. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  revenue  was  projected  using  the  transmission tariff procedures set by \nCERC.  Operation  and  maintenance  expenses  include  salaries  and  wages,  transmission \nexpenses,  and  depreciation.  Salaries  were  computed  on  the  basis  of  POWERGRID\u2019s  current \nstaff size of 6,900 employees, remuneration on actual wage cost in 2002/03 and escalated by \n11% to reflect current wage setting practice. For administrative expenses, repairs, maintenance, \ninventories,  the  actual  amount  of  2002/03  was  used  and  escalated  by  11%.  Depreciation  was \ncomputed in line with the tariff norms as per the CERC guidelines at 2.91%. For existing loans, \ninterest  expense  was  computed  as  per  their  loan  schedules.  The  interest  rate,  moratorium \nperiod, and repayment period for balance domestic borrowings are 6.5%, 4 years, and 12 years, \nrespectively.  \n \n\n3. \n\nBalance Sheet Assumptions \n\n \nAccounts receivable represents 2.4 months of sales in 2003/04 and 3 months sales from \n12. \n2004/05  onward.  Inventories  were  assumed  as  1%  of  total  assets.  Accounts  payable  were \ncomputed  on  the  basis  of  monthly  electricity,  repairs,  maintenance,  administration,  and \nprocurement  expenditures.  Construction  deposits  are  assumed  to  be  20%  of  construction  in \nprogress and to be fully disbursed in the year following completion of construction in progress. \nInterest and dividends are assumed to be paid in the year following, whereas taxes will be paid \nin  the  year  in  which  they  occur.  Principal  repayments  with  respect  to  bonds,  and  foreign  and \ndomestic debt were computed according to the terms and conditions of each facility. \n \n\n4. \n\nProjected Financial Performance \n\n \n13. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  financial  projections,  as  shown  in  Table  8.2,  indicate  profitability  over \nthe  term  of  the  loan.  The  minimum  debt-service  coverage  ratio  is  1.33  in  2004/05,  and  the \nhighest  debt-equity  ratio  is  expected  to  be  69:31  in  2007/08,  2008/09  and  2009/10. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s assets under construction will increase significantly between years 2004/05 and \n2010/11  and  the  time  lag  for  these  assets  to  be  transferred  to  fixed  assets  for  revenue \ngeneration  ranges  from  14  to  18  months.  The  self-financing  ratio  is  7.3%  in  2004/05,  but \ngradually  improves  and  reaches  to  22.4%  in  2008/09  and  30.0%  in  2011/12.  Despite  an \nambitious  capital  expenditure  program,  POWERGRID  should  be  able  to  maintain  its  financial \nviability over the term of the loan, and will remain profitable provided that its cost remains within \nthe margins established by the CERC tariff procedure. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n    \n\n \n\nTable A8.2: Financial Projections\n\nFiscal Year Ending 2000-2001 to 2009-2010\nIncome Statement Summary\n  Sales\n  Operating Cost\n  Operating Income/(Loss)\n  Net Income/(Loss) before Tax \n  Less: Income Tax\n\nAudited\n\nAudited\n\nAudited Provisional Forecast\n\n2000-2001 2001-2002 2002-2003 2003-2004 2004-2005 2005-2006 2006-2007 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2010\n\n      \n      \n      \n        \n           \n        \n\n26,826\n12,597\n14,229\n8,123\n698\n7,425\n\n      \n      \n      \n        \n           \n        \n\n24,555\n10,022\n14,533\n7,953\n722\n6,886\n\n      \n      \n      \n        \n           \n        \n\n25,327\n10,805\n14,522\n7,518\n704\n6,426\n\n28,054\n11,406\n16,663\n8,095\n622\n7,482\n\n31,325\n12,362\n18,963\n8,021\n617\n7,404\n\n36,161\n14,121\n22,040\n9,031\n695\n8,336\n\n43,254\n15,965\n27,289\n11,713\n901\n10,812\n\n53,018\n18,191\n34,827\n16,226\n1,248\n14,978\n\n63,698\n20,814\n42,885\n20,979\n1,614\n19,365\n\n76,791\n23,550\n53,241\n26,630\n2,048\n24,582\n\nCash Flow Summary\n      \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n        \n  Net Cash Flow from Financing\n     \n  Net Cash Used for Investing\n           \n  Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalent\n\n12,217\n7,148\n(18,660)\n705\n\n      \n      \n     \n       \n\n22,363\n11,524\n(34,972)\n(1,085)\n\n      \n        \n     \n          \n\n15,813\n8,369\n(24,960)\n(778)\n\n        \n        \n       \n        \n\n29,177\n30,235\n(23,238)\n36,174\n\n      \n      \n     \n      \n\n33,463\n35,252\n(37,645)\n31,070\n\n      \n      \n     \n      \n\n41,767\n51,033\n(56,881)\n35,919\n\n     \n     \n    \n     \n\n50,921\n62,164\n(70,024)\n43,061\n\n    \n    \n   \n    \n\n60,670\n64,743\n(76,034)\n49,378\n\n    \n    \n   \n    \n\n73,484\n76,408\n(90,024)\n59,868\n\n    \n    \n   \n    \n\n82,782\n70,639\n(83,147)\n70,274\n\nBalance Sheet Summary\n  Fixed Assets\n  Current Assets\n  Total Assets\n  Current Liabilities\n  Long-Term Debt\n  Total Equity\n  Total Liabilities and Equity\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n  Debt Service Coverage Ratio (Times)\n  Self-Financing Ratio (%)\n  Return on Average Net Fixed Assets (%)\n  Long-Term Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n      \n      \n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n\n97,844\n57,982\n155,826\n9,148\n80,622\n62,471\n152,241\n\n      \n      \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n99,059\n90,562\n189,621\n15,833\n99,235\n67,571\n182,639\n\n    \n      \n    \n      \n    \n      \n    \n\n145,987\n64,444\n210,431\n13,982\n114,432\n73,124\n201,538\n\n      \n\n    \n\n187,599\n47,759\n235,358\n28,083\n122,664\n81,191\n235,358\n\n221,558\n44,988\n266,546\n30,721\n147,612\n88,213\n266,546\n\n271,617\n51,472\n323,089\n40,484\n183,279\n99,326\n323,089\n\n    \n\n    \n\n319,044\n71,701\n390,746\n49,457\n229,499\n111,790\n390,746\n\n   \n\n   \n\n385,928\n80,265\n466,194\n  \n59,029\n279,115\n128,050\n  \n466,194\n\n465,202\n92,845\n558,047\n  \n76,083\n334,786\n147,178\n  \n558,047\n\n535,998\n106,316\n642,314\n  \n91,373\n380,420\n170,521\n  \n642,314\n\n      \n\n    \n\n1.49\n33.6\n7.6\n56:44\n\n1.08\n0.0\n7.0\n59:41\n\n1.59\n37.5\n4.4\n64:36\n\n1.51\n22.20\n5.0\n62:38\n\n1.33\n6.8\n4.5\n63.37\n\n1.32\n11.6\n4.3\n65:35\n\n1.38\n12.5\n4.8\n67:33\n\n1.56\n14.9\n5.6\n69:31\n\n1.68\n22.0\n6.2\n69:31\n\n1.55\n17.5\n6.8\n69:31\n\nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n \n\ni\n\n4\n1\n \n\n\f \n\n                \n\n4\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n9\n \n\ni\n\nSUBPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n\nS No.\n\nSubproject Name\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 11 12\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 11 12\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 6\n\n7\n\n8 9 10 11 12 1\n\n2\n\n3 4 5 6\n\n7 8 9 10 11 12\n\nCore Subprojects\n\nI.

In accordance with the sector lending procedure of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), three core \nsubprojects identified in the southern regional grid involve setting up of five new substations in two states of Andhra \nPradesh  and  Tamil  Nadu,  and  one  Union  Territory  of  Pondicherry.  The  Project,  by  focusing  on  strengthening  and \nexpansion of the transmission systems of the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) is expected to \nreduce  system  losses,  which  in  turn  will  improve  frequency  and  voltage  levels,  and  ultimately  reduce  wear  on \nelectrical  equipment.  This  will  lead  to  more  efficient  use  of  resources  and  make  more  power  available  to  increase \nelectrification  outreach.  In  addition,  it  will  facilitate  efficient  utilization  of  existing  and  planned  power  plants.  The \nstrengthening of the sector in the selected states will result in efficient delivery of services to consumers. Profitability \nand efficiency in the farm and nonfarm sector is expected to improve with improvements in quality and reliability of \npower  supply  with  effective  restructuring.  For  the  poor,  wage  employm ent  opportunities  and  farm  profitability  and \nhousehold welfare will improve.  \n\n \nB.         Poverty Analysis                                                   Targeting Classification: General intervention     \n \nThe  three  core  subprojects  cover  five  districts  in  the  two  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Union \nTerritory  of  Pondicherry.  These  states  are  among  the  better-off states in the country in terms of per capita income, \neconomic growth, and human and social development. In case of Andhra Prades h, the National Human Development \nReport (2001) ranks the state as 10th among 15 states calculated. Poverty is still a pertinent problem in the state with \n15.77%  of  the  state  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  (1999/00)  compared  with  national  data  of 26.10%. The \nstate of Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, is country's 6th most populous state, and was ranked it 3rd out of 15 states \ncalculated. In general, the state has been successful in its overall efforts to address poverty, and the proportion of \nthose  living  below  the  poverty  line  fell  from  over  35.03%  in  1993/94  to  21.12%  in  1999/00.  The  state  ranks  12th in \nhuman poverty index ranking for the country.  \n \nPoverty levels in the Union Territory of Pondicherry were estimated at 37.40%( 1993/94) and 21.67% (1999/00). In all \nthe three states, poverty levels are now largely lower than the national average. However, in spite of this impressive \nperformance, poverty remains pervasive with a large section of the population (scheduled castes/tribes, minorities, \nwomen) not benefiting from the economic and social development. \n \nThe Project is expected to result in efficient delivery of services to consumers. The improved frequency and voltage as \nwill boost the industry and agriculture sectors leading to enhanced production, and improved economic development.  \n \n \nC.         Participation Process \n\n \n\n \nDuring project preparation, a total of 10 consultations and meetings with the project communities in the five subproject \ndistricts were organized. Discussions aimed at ascertaining community response to the subprojects, their needs and \ndemands from the subprojects, an estimate of losses that they would suffer, and steps to mitigate those losses. These \nmeetings  were  held  in  groups  comprising  village  panchayats,  village  administrative officers, men, women, farmers, \nand disadvantaged groups to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the Project and its impacts. \n \n \nD. \n \n\nGender and Development  \n\nBased  on  the  premise  that  no  development  activity  can  be  gender  neutral  and  potentially  affects  women, gender \nparticipation was ensured during the course of the social study by means of focus group discussions with women to \nascertain the impact of the subprojects on them. The interactions revealed that women as a group perceived no direct \nbenefit or  impacts  from  the  subprojects.  However,  they  established  a  clear  linkage  in  terms  of  the  future  indirect \nbenefits that should boost industrial development and agricultural production (by making available options of irrigation \nsources through mechanization) and thereby leading to socioeconomic development of their community and area.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nE.         Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n \n\nResettlement  \n\nSignificant/ \nNot \nSignificant/ \nNone \nSignificant \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nThe three core subprojects  construction would entail land \nacquisition  of  a  total  of  186  acres  in  the  five  sites,  out  of \nwhich  98  comprise  private  land,  the  majority  of  which  is \ncultivable  agricultural \nland  but  currently  not  under \ncultivation due to inadequate rainfall and lack of irrigation \nfacilities.  Of  the  remaining  88  acres,  19  are  government \nland  and  69  belong  to  Tamil  Nadu  Hindu  Religious \nEndowment Board. These 69 acres are being used by an \nestimated 40 households with users\u2019 rights but no formal \ntitles  of  Abishegapatti  Village  (Tirunaveli)  for  cultivation \nthereby adversely affecting their livelihood. In addition an \nestimated 42 households comprising titleholders would be \naffected by land acquisition. \n \nIn addition, land acquisition for setting up the substation in \nArasur (Tamil Nadu) would adversely affect a temple and \na partially affect a pond in the category of common \nproperty resources. The pond is currently used for \nsanitation purposes by the villagers; as a result people \nwould lose access to community facilities.  \n \nAll these losses will be compensated by POWERGRID in \nkeeping with the full resettlement plan prepared for the \nthree core subprojects. \n \nDuring the study undertaken for project preparation, no \nindigenous groups or populations were found in any of the \nfive project sites: Arasur, Karur, Tirunaveli in Tamil Nadu, \nWarangal in Andhra Pradesh, and Pondicherry.  \n\nFull resettlement \nplan for the three \ncore subprojects \nand resettlement \nframework for \nadditional \nsubprojects \nprepared  \n\nNot required. \nIndigenous \npeoples \ndevelopment \nplan framework \nprepared for \nadditional \nsubprojects  \nNot required \n\nNot required \n\nNone \n\nIndigenous \nPeople \n\nNone \n\nLabor \n\nNone \n\nAffordability \n\nNone \n \n \nNone \n\nImprovement in the quality of power supply will have a \npositive impact on labor by boosting industrial \ndevelopment in the area and thereby lead to employment \ncreation.

The  three  core  subprojects  cover  five  rural  villages  in  the  districts  of  Warangal, \nTriunelveli,  Karur,  Coimbatore,  and  Pondicherry.  The  majority  of  households  depend  upon \nagriculture and agricultural labor for livelihood. \n \nB. \n \nThe three core subprojects include construction of five new substations and will involve \n2. \nland acquisition. The land has been identified in each of the  subproject locations (Table A12.1). \nTechnical  design  for  the  proposed  five  substations  has  been  adjusted  to  avoid  or  to  minimize \nimpacts, especially homestead land and houses. Field visits and public consultations helped to \ndevelop  the  measures  to  minimize  negative  social  impacts.  These  substations  will  directly \nbenefit  the  core  subproject  areas  and  contribute  to  ensuring  better  power  supply  and  voltage \nregulation for the overall development of the communities. \n \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nTable A12.1: Summary of Core Subproject Impacts \n\n \n \nSubproject \nGrid \nStrengthening \nfor TN\u2013I  \nGrid \nstrengthening \nfor TN\u2013II \n\n \nState/Union \nTerritory \nTamil Nadu \n\nTamil Nadu \n\n \nName of New \nSubstation  \n400/220 kV at \nTriunelveli  \n\n400/220 kV \nKarur/Pugalur \n\n400/220 kV \nArasur \n\nGrid \nstrengthening \nfor TN, AP, \nand Union \nTerritory of \nPondicherry \n\nAndhra \nPradesh \n& \nPondicherry \n\n400/220 kV at \nWarangal \n\n400/220 kV \nPondicherry \n\n \nVillage and \nDistrict \nAbishegapatti \nVillage in \nTriunelveli District  \nK.

The  community  sanitation  pond  and  temple  will  be  reconstructed  in  a \nsuitable location in consultation with those affected. The land acquisition will not adversely affect \nany commercial or residential structures.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nA  full  resettlement  plan  (RP)  was  prepared  for  the  three  core  subprojects  and  is \npresented as Supplementary Appendix J. The total estimated resettlement budget for the three \ncore subprojects RP implementation is about Rs71.3 million. The estimate includes all the cost \nrelated  to  land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement  assistance,  monitoring  and evaluation, \nand administrative costs. The budget is based on field-level information and past experience in \nresettlement  management.  To  guide  preparation  of  the  RPs  for  additional  subprojects,  a \nresettlement framework was prepared (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nD. \n  \n6. \nThe policy framework and entitlements of the Project are based on the Land Acquisition \nAmendment  Act  of  1984,  and  associated  regulations,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ninvoluntary resettlement policy (1995) and  Handbook  on  Resettlement (1998), the Power Grid \nCorporation  of  India  Limited  (POWERGRID)  social  and  environmental  policy  and  guidelines \n(2004),  and  the  entitlement  benefits  as  listed  in  the  National  Policy  on  Resettlement  and \nRehabilitation of India as notified in February 2004.

These meetings are to \ngather  wider  public  input  from  both  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders.  POWERGRID  will \nundertake  an  information  campaign  and  publish  brochures  in  local  language  summarizing  the \ncore  subproject  resettlement  policy,  entitlement  matrix,  and  implementation  schedule.  During \nthe  subprojects  implementation,  each  RP  will  be  made  available  to  people  affected  and \ncommunity groups. \n \nA  grievance  redress  committee  will  be  set  up  by  the  Environment  and  Social \n9. \nManagement Unit of POWERGRID in each of the subproject locations to address all concerns \nand grievances of the local communities and people affected. The committee will be established \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\n Institutional Arrangement and Budget  \n\n2 months prior to the commencement of civil works for additional subprojects, and will comprise \nPOWERGRID, representatives of local authorities, people affected, village  panchayat, and well-\nreputed  representatives  of  the  health  and  education  sectors  as  mutually  agreed  with  the  local \nauthorities and people affected. The committee will address project-related grievances and will \nprovide  a  public  forum  for  concerns  or  objections  regarding  the  assistance. POWERGRID will \nbe  represented  by  a  senior  official  from  the  regional/corporate  center.  The  grievance  redress \ncommittee  will  be  locally  located  and  functional  to  ensure  easy  access  to  communities  and \npeople  affected.  POWERGRID  will  disseminate  information  about  the  functional  norms  of  the \ncommittees, which will meet at least twice a year or as and when required. \n \nF. \n \nPOWERGRID will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A social, resettlement, and \n10. \nenvironment  implementation  unit  will  be  established  for  each  subproject,  headed  by  a \nconcerned  senior  official  of  the  region.  The  unit  will  be  accountable  and  responsible  for \nimplementation  of  the  RP.  Each  unit  will  have  one  or  more  resettlement officer depending on \nnumber of people affected to implement. These resettlement officers should have an academic \nbackground  of  social  sciences  with  field  experience  handling  RP  implementation  and \ncommunity-based  activities.  The  unit  will  maintain  all  databases,  work  closely  with  those \naffected and target community and community based organizations. \n \n11. \nThe  social,  resettlement,  and  environment  implementation  units  will  be  responsible  for \ninternal  monitoring  and  will  prepare  progress  reports  on  RP  implementation.  RPs  must  be \nimplemented and completed within 12 months, effective from the commencement of civil works. \nPOWERGRID will ensure that all compensation payments shall be made to affected households \nand persons prior to commencement of civil works.  \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n12. \nThe  total  estimated  resettlement  budget  for  each  subproject  RP  should  be  stated.  The \nestimate includes all the cost related to land acquisition, compensation, resettlement assistance, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  and  administrative  costs.  The  budget  will  be  based  on  field \ninformation and past experience with resettlement management.  \n \nG. \n \n13. \nThe  RP  will  have  both  internal  and  external monitoring. The local social, resettlement, \nand  environment  implementation  unit  will  be  responsible  for  internal  monitoring  of  RP \nimplementation,  and  will  forward  quarterly  progress  reports  to  POWERGRID.  The  report  will \ncontain progress made in RP implementation with particular attention to compliance with the RP \nprinciples  and  matrix.  POWERGRID  will  submit  a  monitoring  report  twice  a  year  to  ADB.  An \nindependent  expert  will  be  hired  by  the  POWERGRID  with  ADB  concurrence  for  undertaking \nexternal  monitoring  of  each  subproject  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness  for  the  core \nsubprojects, and at least 2 months prior to commencement of civil works under each additional \nsubproject. Such expert will report on a 6 monthly basis directly to ADB and POWERGRID and \ndetermine  whether  resettlement  goals  have  been  achieved,  more  importantly  whether \nlivelihoods and living standards have been restored, and suggest suitable recommendations for \nimprovement.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction \n\nPower  Grid  Corporation  of \n\n(POWERGRID)  prepared  an \n\n \nA.  \n \ninitial \nIndia  Limited \n1. \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  and  a  summary  IEE  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  for  the \nPower Grid  Transmission  (Sector)  Project.  The  Project  is  assigned  environment  category B. \nIEEs  and  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  with  implementation  budgets  were \nprepared  for  the  three  core  subprojects,  comprising  six  transmission  line  segments  and  nine \nsubstations (five new and four to be augmented) by POWERGRID. The IEE and its summary for \nthe  entire  Project  was  prepared  following  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Environment \nPolicy  2002  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  2003,  and  Government  of  India \nenvironmental assessment guidelines and regulations.  \n \n2. \nEnvironmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  for  Subproject  Selection  (the \nEnvironmental Framework) has been defined as required by ADB guidelines for sector lending \nand  Government  requirements  for  transmission  projects  (see  Section  C,  below).  The \nEnvironmental  Framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  identifies  the  broad  scope  of  the \nProject  and  outlines  the  policy,  procedures  and  institutional  requirements  for  core  subproject \nselection  and  preparation  of  subsequent  sub-projects.  Consistent  with  ADB  procedures  and \nthe  Environmental  Framework  and \nPOWERGRID  environmental  management  system, \nenvironmental management procedural guidelines will apply to all subprojects under the loan to \nensure  that  the  environmental  issues  are  appropriately  addressed  and  any  impacts  are \nadequately mitigated.  \n \nB.  \n \n3. \nThe Project is a sector loan to strengthen and develop India\u2019s national transmission grid, \nthrough  intra-  and  interregional  high  capacity  transmission  development,  including  operation \nand maintenance services, without causing any major environmental and social problems. The \nthree  core  subprojects  will  strengthen  the  high  voltage  transmission  system  in  the  southern \nregional grid covering the regional  and state grids of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil \nNadu, and Union Territory of Pondicherry. This southern region strengthening component of the \nProject will improve reliability and security in this region and transmit additional power within the \nregion by improving existing grid interconnections. The proposed southern transmission system \nwould  fulfill  high  capacity  transmission  requirements  of  the  region.  A  description  of  the  three \ncore subprojects is summarized in Table A13.1. \n \nC.  \n \nThe following criteria have been and will be applied to selection of subprojects, including \n4. \ncore and future subprojects. All subprojects require an IEE, in accordance with ADB policy and \nguidelines  (para.  1).  The  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  does  not  require  a  full \nenvironmental impact assessment for transmission line projects. However, for transmission lines \ntraversing forests,1 the project executing agency is required to obtain forest clearance from the \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Framework for Subproject Selection \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n                                                 \n1   The Indian Forest Act, 1927 regulates the classification and declaration of different categories of forests. The state \ngovernment may constitute  any  forestland  or  wasteland,  which  is  the  property  of  Government  or  over  which  the \nGovernment has proprietary rights, or to the whole or any part of the forest-produce of which the Government is \nentitled, a reserved forest, or protected forest in the manner provided in the act. A reserved forest usually has good \nquality of woods with limited rights of inhabitants until clearances are obtained.

A final check on \nconformity  with  the  selection  criteria  will  be  the  submission  of  a  detailed  IEE  for  additional \nsubprojects  for  ADB  clearance.  An  environmental  categorization  process  using  a  checklist \napproach in compliance with the ADB  Environment Policy 2002 will be applied.  Any  additional \nsubproject confirmed by ADB as environmentally sensitive will require that the summary IEE be \nmade available to general public at least 120 days before subproject approval by ADB. \n \n7. \nDuring subproject selection and preparation of the  IEE, at least one public consultation \nwill be conducted with local community and potentially affected people for each subproject. The \nIEE  will  be  approved  before  commencement  of  detailed  design:  IEE  results  will  be \ncommunicated to the local community before commencement of construction.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nResponsibilities and Authority of Various Agencies \n\n \n8. \nPOWERGRID  will  be  solely  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  entire  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures of selecting additional subprojects. This includes ensuring \nthat the selection criteria are strictly followed, IEEs (including EMPs with budgets) and summary \nIEEs are prepared in a timely and adequate manner, environmental monitoring and institutional \nrequirements are fully met, and public consultations be carried out satisfactorily. POWERGRID \nwill submit the categorization checklist and IEEs and summary IEEs and monitoring reports to \nADB for review. \n \n9. \nADB  will  be  responsible  for  regular  review  and  timely  approval  of  subproject  checklists \nand IEEs and summary IEEs. ADB will provide technical guidance to POWERGRID if needed. \nADB will also be responsible for reviewing regular monitoring reports and officially disclosing the \nIEEs for selected subprojects on its website.  \n \n\n3.  \n\nDetailed Design and Construction Contracts \n\n \nDetailed  design  work  for  each  additional  subproject  will  follow  the  recommendations  of \n10. \nthe  IEE.  The  Environmental  and  Social  Management  Department  of  POWERGRID  will  vet \ndetailed designs before contracts are finalized and modifications are incorporated if considered \nnecessary.  Certification  to  ADB  that  the  detailed  designs  comply  with  IEE  (including  EMP) \nrecommendations will be required before contracts can be made effective.  \n \n11. \nEarly  in  the  implementation  period,  model  construction  contracts  will  be  prepared \nincorporating general environmental safeguards and practices. Specific, individual contracts will \nbe based on the model contracts, but evaluated by the  Environmental and Social Management \nDepartment of POWERGRID to ensure that any special or particular safeguard recommended \nby the IEE (including EMP) for the subproject is incorporated within the contract. \n \nD. \n \n12. \nTable  A13.2  summarizes  the  anticipated  impacts  during  construction  and  operation. \nAlignment selection during the design stage has avoided major impacts.

The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  compares  the  annual \nstreams of economic capital and operating costs against benefits based on willingness to pay. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) compares the annual streams of financial capital and \noperating  costs  against  revenues.  All  costs,  benefits,  and  revenues  are  expressed  in  2004 \nconstant prices. The analysis period includes the construction period and 20 years of operation. \nDetails  on  the  assumptions  and  calculations  used  for  the  economic  and  financial  analysis are \npresented in Supplementary Appendices K and L, respectively. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  main  benefits  stems  from  (i)  removing  existing  bottlenecks  to  meet  the  growing \nenergy  needs  by  introducing  economic  dispatch  between  neighboring  regions;  (ii)  improving \nefficiency  reliability  and  system  security;  (iii)  facilitating  energy  trade  from  surplus  to  deficit \nregions;  and  (iv)  reducing  losses.  The  physical  output\u2014interstate  transmission  of  electricity\u2014\nwill  add  to  existing  supply  (incremental  benefit)  and  will  substitute  (nonincremental)  for \nalternative  forms  of  energy  supply.  The  incremental  benefit  of  the  interregional  link  of  22,000 \nmegawatts (MW) is about 102,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity transmission at 60% load \nfactor. The incremental benefits were valued for each category of customers, using customers\u2019 \nwillingness to pay for electricity. \n \n3. \nThe nonincremental benefit was quantified using the alternative energy resources used \nin  the  without-project  scenario.  The  16,000  MW  of  demand  not  met  (23,500  GWh  assuming  4 \nhours  of  load-shedding  [rationing]  each  day)  in  the  deficit  regions  are  valued  at  the  cost  of \nalternative energy sources\u2014kerosene, lamp, diesel irrigation pump, and diesel generation\u2014for \nrespective  customer  class.  The  nonincremental  benefits  were  divided  to  customer  categories \nusing  the  approximate  pattern  of  load-shedding  by  the  customer  class:  domestic  (55%), \ncommercial (10%), industrial (20%), and agriculture (15%). \n \n \n \n4. \nThe  value  of  each  unit  of  electricity  to  customers  was  estimated  by  comparing  current \nprices  against  the  price  of  alternative  sources  of  electricity.  Particular  consumer  classes  are \nassumed to be willing to pay the difference between the present cost for an alternative source of \nelectricity and the amount that charged for incremental grid-supplied units. This was used as the \nbasis  for  the  willingness-to-pay  calculation.  Focusing  on  the  consumer  class,  the  analysis \nidentified  focused  at  the  consumer  class  level  and  four  classed  of  electricity  consumer  types\u2013\nagricultural,  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  were  analysed.  The  focus  is  on  the  main \nenergy  use  (and  the  alternative  source)  rather  than  full  range  of  appliances  used  by  the \ncustomer category to calculate the real value for lost load. Table A14.1 shows the willingness to \npay and price of alternative energy for each customer category \n\nCalculation of Willingness to Pay \n\n1. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nTable A14.1: Cost of Alternative Energy and WTP ($/kWh) \n\nItem \n\nDomestic \nCommercial \nIndustrial \nAgriculture \n\nAlternative \nEnergy \n0.195 \n0.143 \n0.143 \n0.214 \n\nWTP \n\n0.132 \n0.134 \n0.121 \n0.108 \n\n2. \n\n      \n\n          Source: Asian Development Bank. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n                                       WTP = willingness to pay \n         \n \n \n \n5. \nThe  base  case  real  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  30.5%.  The  time-slice analysis \ninvolved  time-series  data  over  2002-2012,  equivalent  to  10  annual  observations.  The  data  for \nincremental  cost  of  distribution,  generation,  and  load  factor  was  obtained  from  POWERGRID \nand the annual reports of the Planning Commission, Government of India. \n \n\nTable 14.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n(%) \n\nSensitivity Analysis of EIRR \n  \nBase Case \n(i) Capital Cost Overrun \n(ii) Energy Sales Reduction \n(iii) Steel Price Increase \n(v) Willingness-to-Pay Decrease \n(iv) Combination of (i), (ii), and (v) \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n   Change in Variable  NPV 2004  EIRR \n  \n(%) \n30.5\n    \n29.5\n \n28.1\n \n28.9\n \n25.2\n22.1\n\n($ million) \n   22,350  \n   21,735  \n   16,615  \n   21,334  \n   14,584  \n     9,832  \n\n10 \n(20) \n50 \n(20) \n\n  \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  financial  viability  of  the  overall  investment  program  during  2002\u20132012  when  the \nsubprojects will be financed under the sector loan was assessed. The weighted average cost of \ncapital  (WACC)  is  also  calculated  for  the  overall  investment  program  to  be  financed  by \nPOWERGRID  and  was  compared  with  the  FIRR  to  ascertain  the  financial  viability  of  the \ninvestment project. \n \n \n \n7. \nTo compute the WACC, the financing sources are assumed to comprise POWERGRID\u2019s \nequity contribution financed through retained earnings, government funding, and a combination \nof foreign exchange and local currency loans. Based on the expectations and POWERGRID\u2019s \nhistorical  cost  of  borrowing,  the  loans  earmarked  for  POWERGRID  are  assumed  to  carry \ndifferent  nominal  interest  rates.  The  cost  of  POWERGRID\u2019s  equity  is  calculated  at  14%  as \nallowed by  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission tariff norms for pass through. The other \nassumptions are domestic inflation rate of 4.8%, international interest rate of 6.7%, and tax rate \nof  7.5%.  For  foreign-sourced  loans,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  requires  that  a  premium  for \nforeign  exchange  risk  be  included  in  the  WACC.  To  simplify  the  WACC  calculation,  assumed \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nthe foreign exchange risk premium is assumed to offset the prevailing foreign inflation rate.
