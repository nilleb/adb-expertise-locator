The distribution networks and elevated towers of the Muttur \nscheme are under construction. However, even after supplementary assistance2 for this project \non  29 November  2006,  for  exogenous  reasons,  significant  price  escalation  of  key  inputs  has \nresulted  in  cost  overruns.  While  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  is  prepared  to  increase  its \ncontribution  to  meet  the  final  cost  to  completion,  it  has  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  to  provide  additional  financing  from  loan  savings  to  ease  the  pressure  on  government \nfunds. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe government gives high priority to the provision of and access to safe drinking water \nfor  its  population.3 Under  Section  III  of  its  2001  Millennium  Development  Goals  objective,  the \ngovernment aims by 2015 to reduce by 50% the proportion of people unable to reach or afford \nsafe  drinking  water.  4  The  additional  financing  will  strengthen  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in \n(i) promoting regionally balanced development, (ii) rehabilitating and reconstructing the conflict-\naffected  areas,  and  (iii)  reducing  poverty  and  ensuring  equitable  development  in  the  conflict-\naffected areas. The additional financing was included in the country operations business plan, \n2010\u20132012.5  \n \nProject implementation is rated satisfactory despite being affected by the conflict. All but \n4. \none of the 16 contract packages under the urban component covering the towns of Batticaloa, \nHambantota, Muttur, and Polonnaruwa have been awarded. Nine contracts are ongoing and the \nremaining six contracts have been completed. Most of the ongoing works will be completed in \n2011\u2014except for the salinity barrier in Hambantota, which is expected to be completed in early \n2012 well within the current loan closing date of June 2012. This overall progress is despite 18 \nmonths  delay  in  Batticaloa  and  Muttur  caused  by  the  resurgence  of  conflict  in  these  areas \nduring 2006\u20132007. In addition, three towns6 out of the four  in the project were affected by the \n2004  tsunami.  In  these  towns,  the  displaced  persons  were  resettled  during  2005\u20132006.  The \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Secondary Towns and Rural  Community-Based Water Supply \nand Sanitation Project. Manila (Loan 1993-SRI[SF]). \n\n2  ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Supplementary \nLoans  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-Based \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila (Loan 2275-SRI and Loan 2276-SRI [SF]). \n\n3  As  defined  by  the  World  Health  Organization,  access  to  safe  drinking  water  is  the  proportion  of  people  using \nimproved drinking water sources: household connection, public standpipe, borehole, protected dug well, protected \nspring, and rainwater. Safe drinking water is water with microbial, chemical, and physical characteristics that meet \nWorld Health Organization guidelines or national standards on drinking water quality. \n\n4 United Nations. 2001. Road Map Towards the Implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. New \nYork (The report of the Secretary-General). Currently, the proportion of households with sustainable access to safe \ndrinking water is 84.7% and households\u2019 access to improved sanitation is 93.6%. \n\n5  ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Sri Lanka, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n6  Batticaloa, Muttur, and Hambantota. \n\n\f2 \n\nworking  environment  in  the  Eastern  districts improved  from  mid-2007  and  work  in  most  of  the \ncontracts resumed slowly after clearing of mines. Since the end of conflict in 2009, the working \nenvironment has improved and most of the work is progressing well. Nearly 81% of the 9,606 \nrural  water  supply  schemes  planned  are  now  completed,  benefiting  over  130,000  people.  The \nremaining  schemes  will  be  completed  in  2011.  The  cumulative  contract  awards  to  date  are \n$112.24 million (84.1%) and cumulative disbursements are $85.96 million (64.4%).7 \n \n5. \nCost  overruns  have  been  reported  in  most  construction  operations  in  Sri  Lanka  during \n2005 to 2010 including the water supply and sanitation sector. By the time the initial contracts \nwere due for award in 2005 following detailed design, it became apparent that there was a very \nsignificant  cost  overrun\u2014estimated  at  $80.2  million.  Factors  leading  to  cost  overruns  in  the \nproject  included  (i)  price  increases  and  revision  of  estimates  as  a  result  of  the  input  price \nincrease in the international market and the impact of 2004 tsunami8 ($48.7 million [60%]), and \n(ii)  physical  changes  during  detailed  engineering  design  ($16.5  million  [21%]).  To  meet  the \nexpected  cost  overrun,  a  supplementary  assistance  loan  (footnote  2)  for  $60  million  was \napproved in November 2006. The revised project cost was estimated at $175.2 million in 2006. \nADB\u2019s  loan  amount  was  increased  to  $120.3  million  equivalent  (69%)  with  funds  from  the \nSpecial  Funds  resources  and  ordinary  capital  resources,  the  government\u2019s  contribution \nincreased to $51.8 million (30%), while beneficiaries\u2019 contribution remained at $3.1 million (1%). \n \nAlthough price and physical contingencies were built into the 2006 supplementary loan, \n6. \nsignificant price escalation continued through 2007\u20132008. As a result, for all contracts awarded, \nbid prices were well above the revised estimates in 2006. This was despite competition in the \nbidding process, with an average of three bids  being received, even in conflict-affected areas. \nFrom 2006 to 2009, the average cost increases for key inputs were cement 20%, metal (granite \nstone)  25%,  sand  34%,  reinforced  steel  58%,  polyvinyl  chloride  pipes  57%,  ductile  iron  pipes \n100%, fuel 23%, and labor 25%. During 2006\u20132009, average inflation was 12.5%, but it peaked \nin 2008 at 22.6%. As a result, the final revised cost is now estimated as $259.5 million.  \n \n7. \nThe  remaining  contract  to  be  awarded,  and  for  which  additional  financing  is  being \nproposed,  is  for  the  Muttur  head  works  and  treatment  plant  which  could  not  be  financed  as  a \nresult of increased costs. In the case of the Muttur subproject, bids for the distribution system \nwere called by mid-2006 while the original bidding for the treatment plant and head works was \nin  the  technical  proposal  stage  under  the  two-envelope  bidding  procedure.  The  tender  for  the \ndistribution  network  was  awarded  in  early  2008  in  anticipation  of  awarding  the  head  works \ntender  by  mid  2008.  However,  due  to  a  poor  response  and  unreasonable  bid  prices,  the \ngovernment and ADB decided to re-tender the head works in mid-2008. \n \n8. \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is classified involuntary resettlement category B. \nThe  NWSDB  prepared  a  short  resettlement  plan  during  initial  project  appraisal,  in accordance \nwith  the  government\u2019s  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy 9  and  ADB\u2019s  applicable \nsafeguard  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  (1995).  All  land  acquisition  is  completed  and \ncompensation  paid.  The  proposed  activity  under  this  additional  financing  is  within  the  original \nscope; the current short resettlement plan is valid and no revision is needed. However, ADB will \ncontinuously monitor for any physical changes during implementation.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Overall Progress and Details of the Loan Utilization (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  The impact of the December 2004 tsunami led to a very significant escalation in construction costs in all sectors in \n\n9  Ministry of Land Development. 2001. National Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Colombo. \n\nSri Lanka. \n\n \n\n\fis \n\nimplementing \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  environmental  category  B.  As  part  of  due \n9. \ndiligence,  proposed  physical  changes  within  the  original  design  have  been  screened  for \nsafeguard  significance  and  found  to  be  within  the  original  project  categorization.  Initial \nenvironmental  examinations  incorporating  detailed  engineering  design  changes  have  been \nformulated  for  all  the  schemes  during  the  reappraisal  for  the  2006  supplementary  loan.  The \nproject \nidentified  mitigation  measures.  The  project  has  renewed  all \nenvironmental clearances from the Central Environmental Authority. Since the Muttur scheme is \nwithin the original scope, the current initial environmental examination is valid and no revision is \nneeded.  Environmental  impacts  have  been  minimized  through  appropriate  design  and  site \nlocation,  and  adequate  mitigation  measures  have  been  proposed  to  prevent  or  minimize \nimpacts resulting from construction and operation. \n \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  was  classified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples \n10. \nsafeguards  under  the  original  loan.  Since  the  Muttur  scheme  is  within  the  original  scope,  the \ncurrent classification is valid and no revision is needed. \n \nThe  project  promotes  equal  representation  of  women  in  staffing,  planning,  and \n11. \nimplementation of the project. Numerical targets set for the project have been met or exceeded, \nand women\u2019s involvement in project implementation is high. Also, women\u2019s participation in the \nrural component of the project was comprehensive because the gender action plan provisions \nwere  implemented  effectively.  Implementing  partner  nongovernment  organizations  established \nnew  community-based  organizations  to  manage  rural  water  supply  schemes.  A  recent \nreview shows  that  both  women  and  men  have  equal  participation  and  leadership  positions  in \nthese  community-based  organizations,  which  manage  the  rural  water  supply  schemes. 10 \nPositive  changes  in  gender  relations  and  gender  roles  resulting  from  the  project  include \nwomen\u2019s  leadership  in  the  community,  their  increased  involvement  in  planning  and  managing \ncommunity infrastructure, and increased engagement with local government on identification of \nand  planning  related  to  community  needs.  Women\u2019s  livelihood-related  activities  improved \nthrough access to revolving loan funds through the project, although the impact was limited as \nthe loans were small.  \n \n12. \nThe  government  requested  ADB  to  allocate  from  portfolio  savings  (i) SDR8.148  million \n($12.773 million)  to  a  supplementary  loan  to  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment  Project  II 11  for  urgent  rehabilitation  works  in  the  Northern  province,  and \n(ii) $13 million12 as  additional  financing  to  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-Based \nWater Supply and Sanitation Project for completion of the head works and water treatment plant \nin the Muttur water supply scheme in the Eastern province.13 \n \n13. \nThe  additional  financing  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  in  ADB\u2019s  additional  financing \npolicy,14 i.e., the project remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2010.

The  cost  overrun  is  due  to \nexogenous reasons, and the government\u2019s evaluation of the tender for the Muttur  head works \nhas been completed and works can be completed within 24 months after the award. ADB may \nprovide  additional  financing  to  ensure  successful  completion  of  ADB-financed  projects  in  the \nevent  of  a  financing  gap  or  a  cost  overrun.  Other  applicable  priority  conditions  are  that  the \nproject is at an advanced stage of implementation and can be completed within a relatively short \ntime,  and  has  a  high  degree  of  project  readiness  in  such  areas  as  design,  implementation \ncapacity,  and  safeguards.  The  additional  financing  will  meet  cost  overruns  resulting  from \nspecific input price increases and overall inflation, while the project\u2019s scope remains unchanged.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  is  to  improve  health  conditions  in  Batticaloa,  Hambantota, \nMuttur, and Polonnaruwa by reducing (i) the incidence of waterborne diseases by 50%, (ii) the \ninfant  mortality  by  20%,  and  (iii)  the  time  and  resources  that  households  spend  in  acquiring \nwater  by  75%.  The  outcome  of  the  project  is  to  provide  pipe-borne  safe  drinking  water  to \n946,000 people and safe sanitation16 to 171,500 people in the project areas.   \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe main outputs of the project are to: \n \n(a)  undertake  urban  schemes  -  construct  three  new  water  networks  to  provide  40,000 \nm3/day in Batticaloa, 8,500 m3/day in Muttur, and 30,500 m3/day in Polonnaruwa, extend \none  existing  water  network  to  provide  15,000 m3/day  in  Hambantota,  construct  33,000 \nlow-cost  latrines,  construct  Batticaloa  Hospital  waste  treatment  plan  with  capacity  to \ntreat 350 m3/day, and provide training and public awareness campaigns;  \n \n(b) develop rural water supply and sanitation - construct rural water schemes to provide \ndrinking  water  (piped,  rainfed,  protected  well)  to  350,000  people  in  Anuradhapura, \nBatticaloa  and  Polonnaruwa,  construct  27,000  low-cost  latrines,  and  deliver  training \nprograms;  \n \n(c) support institutional strengthening capacity - deliver a national public awareness and \neducation campaign, implement a corporate strategy to improve NWSDB management, \nimplement a strategy to reduce operation and maintenance cost, implement a financial \nmanagement  strategy,  implement  a  strategy  to  transfer  systems  with  less  than  1,000 \nconnections to local authorities, community-based organizations, and the private sector, \nand develop an asset registry for systems with more than 10,000 connections. \n\n \n16. \nThe additional financing will be used to fund the head works of the Muttur water supply \nscheme. The head works include water intake, raw water transmission, and 8,500 m3/day water \ntreatment  plant.  If  the  head  works  of  the  Muttur  water  supply  are  not  completed,  it  will  not  be \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: Sri Lanka, 2009\u20132011. Manila. \n16 As  defined  by  the  World  Health  Organization,  basic  sanitation  is  the  lowest-cost  technology  ensuring  hygienic \nexcreta and sullage disposal and a clean and healthful living environment both at home and in the neighborhood of \nusers.  Access  to  basic  sanitation  includes  safety  and  privacy  in  the  use  of  these  services.  Coverage  is  the \nproportion of people using improved sanitation facilities: public sewer connection, septic system connection, pour-\nflush latrine, simple pit latrine, and ventilated improved pit latrine. \n\n\fInvestment and Financing Plans \n\npossible  to  commission  the  scheme  even  though  the  distribution  network  and  the  elevated \ntowers will be completed by the second quarter of 2011. In addition, about 55,000 beneficiaries \nin Muttur, who are resettled internally displaced persons from the conflict and who were earlier \nimpacted by the 2004 tsunami, would not be able to benefit from the project. Overall, the project \nwould not be able to achieve its full scope and objectives. \n \nD. \n \n17. \n \n18.   Since the approval of supplementary financing in 2006, project cost increased by $84.4 \nmillion. Most of the increase is being financed by the increase in the government\u2019s contribution. \nThe  total  shortfall  for  the  proposed  Muttur  scheme  is  estimated  at  $19.6  million  including \ncontingencies, interest payments, and taxes and duties. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $259.5 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nOriginal \nCost \nEstimate \n\n2006 Revised \nCost \nEstimate \n \n\n \n\n2011 Revised \nCost Estimate \na,b \n\nFunding Gap\n\n \nComponent \n\nA.

These  figures  are  compared  to  226,724  in \nBatticaloa; 133,029  in Hambantota;  49,490  in Muttur;  and  84,128  in  Polonnaruwa  assumed  at \nthe  previous  appraisal  in  2006.  Two  major  streams  of  economic  benefits  from  water  supply \nschemes are quantified: (i) resource cost savings for the non-incremental water supply from the \nproject  including  savings  in  time  spent  fetching  water;  savings  in  costs  of  replacement  and \nrepair of wells, bores, jars and buckets, and transportation; and savings in medical costs spent \nfor  waterborne  diseases;  and  (ii)  the  value  of  the  incremental  water  supply  from  the  project. \nWithout the project, the average domestic water consumption is assumed at 60 liters per capita \nper day; and with the project, 100 liters per capita per day, in line with the assumption made at \nappraisal. The average household is assumed to save 43\u201376 minutes per day spent in fetching \nwater as a result of the project, and the time savings are evaluated at an unskilled wage rate of \nSLRs550  per  day. 19 Unquantifiable  benefits  from  the  project  include  (i)  increased  economic \nactivity in the areas resulting from the more reliable water supply infrastructure, (ii) appreciation \n\n                                                 \n18 Detailed Analysis of the Cost Overrun (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2009.

For the four water \nsupply  schemes  combined,  the  overall  EIRR  is  estimated  at  9.1%.  This  compares  with  an \noverall  EIRR  of  10.0%  estimated  during  the  project  reevaluation  in  2006.  While  the  overall \neconomic  returns  of  the  project  have  declined  with  the  escalation  of  project  costs,  the  overall \nproject is viable since (i) there is significant sunk costs incurred on the project; (ii) in the post-\nconflict era, significant economic development activity is occurring or planned to occur, which is \nlikely  to  result  in  further  urban  migration  into  the  project  areas  leading  to  greater  demand  for \nwater  from  both  domestic  and  nondomestic  consumers;  and  (iii)  a  scarcity  of  water  exists  in \nthese  project  areas.  The  economic  analysis  excludes  indirect  secondary  benefits  such  as \nreduction  in  spending  on  healthcare  due  to  a  reduction  in  waterborne  disease  and  an \nimprovement  in  health.  The  updated  economic  returns  estimated  for  the  respective  towns  are \nshown in Table 4. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Project Financial and Economic Analysis, 2001\u20132010 \n\n \n\nBatticaloa \n\nMuttur \n\nHambantota \n\nPolonnaruwa \n\n9.3 \n\n6.9 \n\n9.5 \n\n9.8 \n\n7.2 \n\n8.3 \n\n+ve \n\n+ve \n\n+ve \n\n+ve \n\n12.3 \n\n21.7 \n\n18.9 \n\n25.7 \n\n10.9 \n\n14.3 \n\n18.6 \n\n17.0 \n\n12.0 \n\n11.1 \n\n12.6 \n\nNPV \n\n(3,544) \n\n(1,311) \n\n(4,195) \n\n(1,010) \n\n-ve \n66.8 \n\n-ve \n65.5 \n\n5.3 \n16.8 \n\n-ve \n74.6 \n\n3.6 \n18.2 \n\n1.9 \n28.2 \n\n-ve \n65.7 \n\n1.2 \n13.1 \n\n(4.3) \n93.7 \n\n(6.9) \n102.6 \n\n(6.9) \n129.1 \n\n(9.3) \n142.9 \n\n2001  2006 \n\n2001  2006 \n\n2001  2006 \n\n2001  2006 \n\n2010 \n(6,294) \n\n2010 \n(2,261) \n\n2010 \n(3,801) \n\n2010 \n(4,272) \n\nItem \nFinancial \n(SLRs million) \nFIRR (%) \nAIFC-Full  Cost  ($ \nmillion) \nAIFC \u2013 O&M Only \n($ million) \nEIRR (%) \n4.6 \n( ) = negative, +ve = positive, -ve = negative, AIFC = average incremental financial cost, FIRR = financial internal rate \nof return, NPV = net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance.

This  is  consistent  with \nthe NWSDB\u2019s tariffs revision effected in February 2009 following which the effective water tariff \nrevenue  (considering  a  4%  real  increase  in  tariff  annually)  from  each  of  the  four  water  supply \nschemes will at minimum cover the incremental O&M costs, while three out of the four schemes \nwould  also  be  able  to  cover  debt  servicing  costs  of  the  project.20 With  the  improved  financial \nperformance of the NWSDB, following the tariff revisions in 2009, the capital costs of the project \ncan be recovered. \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n16.6 \n\n13.8 \n\n33.9 \n\n7.6 \n\n7.4 \n\n7.9 \n\n27.
