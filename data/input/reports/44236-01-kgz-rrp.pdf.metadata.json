This will in turn help the Kyrgyz \nRepublic with reconciliation efforts and restoration of normalcy. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIn April 2010, the Kyrgyz Republic experienced significant political disturbance, resulting \nin  many  deaths  and  injuries,  substantial  property  damage,  and  a  change  in  government. \nCommunity violence erupted in June 2010 with even greater casualties, internal displacement, \nphysical damage, and losses. The urgent need for shelter before the onset of winter combined \nwith  food  security  and  livelihood-restoration  needs  increased  the  government\u2019s  burden. \nMoreover, energy infrastructure remains vulnerable to breakdown as a result of disrepair. While \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure  was  not  directly  damaged,  the  shortfall  in  fiscal \ntransfers to maintain dilapidated systems in the country\u2019s urban centers, especially in Osh and \nJalal-Abad cities, will result in significant deterioration of public health conditions. \n\nPoverty incidence for 2009 was estimated at 31.7%. While the planned increase in social \n4. \nassistance  spending  (an  increase  of  115.7%  in  2010  from  2009)  is  expected  to  lower  poverty \nincidence, the fall in per capita income will push more households below the poverty line.1 The \nnumber of households headed by women will likely increase after the emergency. Gender gaps \nin  wage  and  employment  opportunities  make  these  households  more  vulnerable  to  poverty, \nincreasing the dependence of women on social assistance to support their families. Moreover, \nwith  women  receiving  more  than  half  the  social  benefits,  providing  relatively  stable  social \nassistance coverage protects households headed by women from falling into extreme poverty.2 \n\n5. \nJoint  economic  assessment. In May and July 2010, development partners conducted \na  joint  economic  assessment  (JEA)  to  determine  the  economic  and  social  impact  of  the \nconflicts,  and  identify  needs  and  priorities.3 With  impeded  international  trade,  a  drastic  drop  in \ntourist  revenues,  contraction  in  agricultural  output,  impaired  business  activities,  and  continued \nsocial tensions, gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to contract by 3.5% in 2010, below the \n5.5%  growth  forecast  made  at  the  start  of  the  year.  Significant  nonresident  deposit  outflows \nimpaired  the  balance  sheets  of  some  banks,  including  the  largest  bank,  Asia  Universal  Bank. \nThese outflows are thus increasing the risk of systemic banking problems. The JEA estimates \nthe  aggregate  financing  requirement  due  to  the  emergency  until  the  end  of  2012  at  $1  billion;  \n$671 million is needed for 2010 alone, of which $335 million is the budget financing gap. The \n\n                                                 \n1   Per capita output in 2010 is expected to fall from the pre-emergency projection of $943 to $826. \n2   Women  comprise  (i)  53%  of  the  351,000  beneficiaries  of  monthly  benefits  and  (ii)  51%  of  63,818  recipients  of \nmonthly  social  benefits.

It  likewise  highlights  the  need  to  strengthen  the  delivery  of \nbasic \nlocal \ncommunities as a way of alleviating social tensions. \n\nincluding  water  supply  and  sanitation  services, \n\ninfrastructure  services, \n\nin \n\n6. \nFiscal  impact.  Lower  economic  growth,  the  rollback  of  the  energy  tariff  increase, \nremoval of the retail tax on energy payments, and restoration of value-added tax exemptions will \nlikely  result  in  a  revenue  shortfall  of  $86.5  million,  or  1.9%  of  GDP  (Table  1).  Expenditure \nreallocation  is  also  needed  to  accommodate  crisis-related  spending  of  $268  million,  which \nincludes  victim  compensation,  higher  security  spending,  social \ninfrastructure  projects, \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation,  and  bank  recapitalization.  With  these,  the  2010  fiscal  deficit  will \nwiden  to  $615.8  million  (13.7%  of  GDP)  from  the  original  estimate  of  $268.4  million  (6%  of \nGDP). 4  The  government  will  finance  $280.8  million  largely  from  net  external  financing  \n($123.2 million) and use of the Kyrgyz Republic Development Fund balances ($197.6 million),5 \nleaving  a  $335  million  financing  gap.  The  development  partners,  excluding  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), pledged fiscal support during their 27 July 2010 conference of only \n$207 million.6 \n\nTable 1: 2010 State Budget \n($ million) \n\nItem \nRevenue and Grants \nExpenditures and Net Lending \nFiscal Balance \nFinancing \nFinancing Gap \nFiscal Support (excluding ADB) \nADB = Asian Development Bank, JEA = joint economic assessment.  \nSources: Ministry of Finance, Joint Economic Assessment staff estimates. \n\nOriginal Budget \n1,343.3 \n1,611.6 \n(268.4) \n153.1 \n115.2 \n\nJEA Estimates \n1,256.7 \n1,872.6 \n(615.8) \n280.8 \n335.0 \n207.0 \n\nDifference \n(86.5) \n260.9 \n(347.5) \n127.7 \n219.7 \n\nThe  fiscal  situation  requires  prudent  fiscal  management  to  balance  reconstruction  and \n7. \ndevelopment needs over the next 2 years with critical social expenditures for education, health, \nand  social  assistance.  Education  expenditures  include  wages,  textbook  purchases,  food, \nstipends, transportation, utility payments, and repair and maintenance of school facilities. State \ntransfers  to  local  governments  cover  teachers\u2019  salaries,  where  85%  are  women. 7  Health \nexpenditures  include  health  worker  wages,  medicines,  food,  transportation,  and  repair  and \nmaintenance  of  health  facilities.  This  includes  support  for  maternal  health  care,  especially  in \nrural  areas. 8  In  response  to  the  emergency,  the  government  provided  one-time,  lump-sum \ncompensation  for  victims  of  the  April  and  June  2010  events.  An  increase  in  social  assistance \nbeneficiaries  is  likely  as  disabled  victims  of  the  emergency  become  eligible  and  more \nhouseholds are likely to fall into extreme poverty.  \n\n                                                 \n4   Including the extrabudgetary funds, i.e., operations of the Social Fund and Kyrgyz Republic Development Fund, the \n\noverall budget deficit is $669.0 million (Som30.7 billion). \n\n5   The Kyrgyz Republic Development Fund is an extrabudgetary fund financed by proceeds of the $300 million loan \nfrom the Russian Federation in 2009. The fund balances comprise $191 million in the National Bank of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and $46 million in commercial banks. The fund reserves could be used for budgetary financing. \n\n6   Of  which, the  World Bank pledged  $28 million, the International Monetary Fund  $34 million, the European Union \n$15  million,  the  Eurasian  Development  Bank  (Anti-crisis  Fund)  $120  million,  and  the  Russian  Federation  \n$10 million. \n\n7   National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2009.

The maternal mortality ranges from 55 to 150 per 100,000 \n\nlive births according to National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic and United Nations data. \n\n\fHousing  crisis  and  reconciliation  needs.  Community  violence  in  June  2010  led  to \n8. \nnumerous  casualties  and  property  damage  in  Osh  and  Jalal-Abad.  Approximately  375,000 \npeople  were  internally  displaced.  The  Rapid  Joint  Shelter  Assessment, 9  conducted  by  the \nShelter  Cluster  partners  (led  by  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees \n(UNHCR)), 10 indicates  that  about  1,900  houses  were  damaged,  of  which  about  1,700  were \neither  severely  damaged  or  completely  destroyed.11 This  affected  about  13,500  people.  The \nassessment indicates that (i) 36% of households had no access to water supply and sanitation \nservices  after  the  emergency;  (ii)  41%  of  households  lost  ownership  documents  during  the \nemergency; and (iii) more than 95% of those who were internally displaced preferred to return \nand rebuild their own homes rather than be resettled to a new location. \n\n9. \nIn  consultation  with  the  government,  the  Shelter  Cluster  partners  adopted  a  shelter \nstrategy with a budget of $26 million. This was to provide an immediate response to the need for \nshelter  and  included  (i)  immediate  emergency  assistance,  (ii)  emergency  transitional  shelter \nsupport and \u201cwinterization\u201d, and (iii) support for displaced persons living with host families. The \ngovernment  was  to  follow  up  on  this  immediate  response  with  the  provision  of  permanent \nhousing.  \n\n10. \nOf  the  1,900  damaged  houses,  UNHCR  is  coordinating  the  reconstruction  of  1,350 \nseverely  damaged  houses,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  is \nreconstructing 200 houses, and the International Committee of the Red Cross is reconstructing \n350  houses.  Under  these  efforts,  families  are  provided  with  basic  construction  materials  and \nengaged  in  reconstruction  through  a  self-help  program  with  assistance  of  construction  teams. \nUNHCR  is  also  assisting  in  restoration  of  the  property  title  and  housing  documentation  lost  or \ndamaged  during  the  emergency.  The  United  Nation  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  is  providing \nwater, sanitation, and hygiene support during the early recovery phase. \n\n11. \nBased  on  the  shelter  strategy,  severely  damaged  houses  were  eligible  for  100  square \nmeters  (m2)  of  built-up  area.  The  Shelter  Cluster  partners  were  to  reconstruct  transitional \nshelters of up to 50 m2 for each damaged house to allow displaced persons to resettle at their \nproperties before the onset of winter. The government planned to construct the remaining 50 m2 \nof  built-up  area  through  their  own  funds.  The  transitional  shelter  is,  in  reality,  a  permanent \nstructure, which can be extended for permanent housing. Due to higher input prices, the Shelter \nCluster partners could only provide 28 m2 of built-up area comprising two rooms.  \n\n12. \nPublic  infrastructure  damage.  The  impact  on  public  infrastructure  comprises  direct \nstructural damage and risks of further dilapidation due to lack of fiscal resources to operate and \nmaintain  all  infrastructure  assets.  If  left  unaddressed,  both  will  result  in  infrastructure  crises  in \nthe medium-term. The needs include the following: \n\n(i) \n\nThe energy sector requires financing of $180 million to address energy efficiency \nimprovements; and rehabilitation and reconstruction of district heating, electricity, \nand gas systems. Also, maintenance of district heating facilities, operated by the \nstate-owned  KyrgyzZhilKommunSoyuz  Enterprise,  is  likely  to  suffer  due  to  the \nreversal of energy tariffs; the adverse impact will only be felt during winter. The \nWorld Bank will repair damaged power lines and provide heating fuel. \n\n                                                 \n9   United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 2010.

Cuts \nin  the  road  repair  budget  need  to  be  avoided  to  avert  the  consequences  of \ndeferred maintenance. Routine road works will provide temporary jobs to counter \nincome losses during crises. \nPublic  health  has  been  largely  affected  by  the  lack  of  adequate  resources  to \nmaintain  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems.  City  governments  are  unable  to \nsubsidize  revenue  shortfalls  of  the  utilities.  Significant  capital  outlays  are \nimmediately  required  to  rehabilitate  the  systems  and  continue  services  to \nmitigate potential stability risks.  \nAbout  30  public  buildings  and  700  commercial  establishments  were  damaged \nwith a loss of $130 million due to the emergency. \n\n13. \nProposed  ADB  assistance.  The  EARR  is  in  response  to  the  government's  call  for \nassistance  to  mitigate  the  adverse  effects  of  the  April  and  June  2010  conflicts.  It  is  based  on \nADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Policy  (DEAP), 12  which  offers  an  effective  and  suitable \nframework to promptly respond to emergency needs, and provides rapid funding to help rebuild \nhigh priority assets and restore economic, social, and governance activities after emergencies.13  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe  impact  of  the  EARR  is  economic  recovery  and  social  reconciliation.  The  EARR\u2019s \noutcome  is  maintenance  of  essential  public  expenditures  and  rebuilding  of  critical  social  and \npublic infrastructure assets in areas affected by the community violence. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Fiscal Support \n\nThe first component will ensure (i) uninterrupted service delivery by health and education \n15. \ninstitutions  managed  by  the  central  and  local  governments,  (ii)  continued  provision  of  social \nsafety  nets  to  vulnerable  groups,14 and  (iii)  maintenance  of  roads  and  urban  services.  This \nentails fiscal support for critical recurrent social and infrastructure maintenance expenditures. It \nwill act as a liquidity cushion against revenue shocks and, combined with the government's own \nresources,  prevent  further  disruption  of  public  services.  To  achieve  these,  certain  priority \nrecurrent public expenditures in the proposed revised Republican budget for 2010 will need to \nbe protected (Table 2).15 \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2004.

The government requested emergency assistance \n\nfrom ADB in July 2010. \n\n13  A proposed urban services project for Bishkek and Osh planned for 2011 has been brought forward to 2010 to help \nwith the reconstruction process. In addition to the Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Reconstruction Project, \nADB assistance in 2010 to the Kyrgyz Republic includes the Power Sector Improvement Project ($44.8 million) and \nSupplementary  Financing  for  the  CAREC  Regional  Road  Corridor  Improvement  Project  (Supplementary;  \n$23 million). \n\n14  Support for the social assistance program will sustain the benefits under the reformed system and help vulnerable \n\nbeneficiaries, especially women. \n\n15  The  government  has  approved  a  proposed  revised  Republican  budget  for  2010,  which  will  be  submitted  for \n\nparliamentary approval as required by the national budget law. \n\n\f5 \n\n4,490 \n6,808 \n1,351 \n1,127 \n20,204\n\nTable 2: Critical Public Expenditures in the Proposed Revised 2010 Republican Budget \n(Som million) \n\nRecurrent Expenditure Item \n1.

This  component  will  assist  the  government  in \nproviding permanent houses to affected families by expanding the two-room (28 m2) transitional \nshelter for approximately 1,700 severely damaged or completely destroyed houses by 72 m2 at \nan estimated cost of $246 per m2 of built-up area. House design will be based on the individual \nhousehold  need  as  estimated  by  the  UNHCR  shelter  database.  All  reconstructed  houses  will \nhave  water  supply  and  sanitation  services,  electricity  and  heating  facilities.  Where  sewerage \nsystems do not exist, septic tanks or other safe sanitation systems will be provided.  \n\n17. \nTo ensure a smooth transition from the early recovery phase of the shelter strategy, this \ncomponent  will  make  use  of  the  UNHCR  implementing  partners.  By  doing  this,  the  EARR  will \nbenefit  from  the  familiarity  of  the  UNHCR  implementing  partners  with  the  affected  families  as \nwell  as  technical  requirements  for  reconstruction.  This  component  will  be  coordinated  with \nUNHCR to ensure a smooth transition from the early recovery phase.  \n\n18. \nThe EARR will continue to engage those affected families in the reconstruction of their \nhouses  through  a  self-help  program.  The  EARR  consultants  will  conduct  technical,  financial, \nand social audits to monitor construction and ensure that construction quality is maintained. \n\n3. \n\nComponent  3:  Community  Infrastructure  and  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \n(WSS) Improvement \n\nThe  EARR  will  improve  community  infrastructure  as  a  means  of  achieving  social \n19. \nreconciliation.  Community  consultations  by  the  government  and  ADB  will  determine  critical \ncommunity infrastructure, which needs improvement. This would include repair and renovation \nof community centers, schools, and health clinics. Such infrastructure improvement is seen as a \nkey factor in improving social cohesion in the affected region. \n\n20. \nImproving  public  health  in  the  region  will  also  accelerate  the  reconciliation  process. \nProvision of clean and reliable water is the main urban basic service requirement in the cities of \nOsh  and  Jalal-Abad.  The  EARR  will  rehabilitate  water  supply  intake  works  and  treatment \nsystems, and replace the water transmission system to supply continuous and reliable water to \napproximately  335,000  residents  in  both  cities.  It  will  develop  detailed  designs  for  long-term \nWSS improvement in the two cities to be financed through normal lending after the emergency \nphase.

The  loan  will  have  an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1% per annum; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 \nyears; repayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after the grace period and \n4%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement. The government has also requested a grant not exceeding $51.5 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the  EARR.  Counterpart  funds  generated  from \nSDR10.906  million  of  loan  proceeds  and  $23.5  million  of  the  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to \nfinance critical public expenditures under component 1 (as indicated in Table 2). Grant proceeds \nof  $28  million  will  be  used  for  component  2,  and  loan  proceeds  of  SDR21.151  million  will  be \nused for component 3 and SDRD safeguard unit costs. The financing plan is in Table 4. ADB\u2019s \nresources will come from the normal annual allocations for the Kyrgyz Republic for 2010\u20132011  \n($77 million) and an allocation from Asian Development Fund savings ($23 million).  \n\nTable 4: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n    ADF Grant \n    ADF Loan \nGovernment \n\n \n\nTotal\n\n \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund.               . \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nAmount\n($ million) \n100.0 \n51.5 \n48.5 \n10.0 \n110.0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n90.91 \n46.82 \n44.09 \n9.09 \n100.00 \n\n                                                 \n16  They plan to provide approximately $17 million equivalent to Osh and Jalal-Abad cities. \n\n\fE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n24. \nThe  DEAP  contemplates  the  inclusion  of  quick-disbursing  components  to  finance \nimports  considered  necessary  for  effective  recovery  but  also  emphasizes  that  such  quick-\ndisbursing components are not program loans. Component 1 provides fiscal support for critical \npublic  expenditures  and  related  counterpart  funds  are  earmarked  for  such  local  currency \nexpenditures (i.e., based on a positive list of eligible expenditures incurred from 1 October 2010 \nto  31  December  2010).  Component  2  will  support  reconstruction  of  damaged  houses  and \nfinance local currency expenditures for the costs of construction materials and labor (in addition \nto  imports)  as  most  of  the  basic  construction  materials  and  labor  will  be  sourced  locally. \nConsequently,  the  DEAP  requirement  for  imports  to  be  financed  under  quick-disbursing \ncomponents  is  not  applicable  for  components  1  and  2.  Loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). \n\nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements\n1 October 2010\u201330 September 2013 \n30 September 2013  \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body \n\n(ii) Executing agency \n(iii) Key implementing \nagencies \nProcurement \n\nEARR steering committee \nPrime Minister, (chair), and members: minister, MOF; minister, MOES; director, \nSAAC; director, SDRD; and director, SAEPF; mayors, Osh and Jalal-Abad cities \nMOF \nComponent 1: MOF \nComponents 2 and 3: SDRDa \nInternational competitive \nbidding \nNational Competitive Bidding \n\n \n$20 million \n$7 million \n\nTwo contracts for water supply \nand sewerage system \nVarious contracts for \ncommunity infrastructure \nimprovement \nWater supply and sewerage \nmaintenance equipment \n220 person-months (QCBS) \n\n$1 million \n\n$1.5 million \n\n$2.5 million \n\n228 person-months (QCBS) \n\nRetroactive financing and \nadvance actions \nDisbursement  \n\nConsulting services \u2013 \nappointed by the SDRD and \nreporting to SDRD and ADB \n\nInternational competitive \nbidding - Goods \nProject management \nconsultant (firm) \nDesign and supervision \nconsultant (firm) \nRetroactive financing for advance actions for components 2 and 3, up to 20% of \nloan and grant proceeds, to finance consultants and house reconstruction. \nComponent 1: The $40 million equivalent will be disbursed in a single withdrawal \nupon grant and loan effectiveness using a positive list of eligible expenditures and \nsupported by documents specified in the financing agreement. The monthly \nmonitoring reports and budget execution report for 2010 will be used for liquidating \nthe disbursed amount. \nComponent 2: The house reconstruction cost will be disbursed directly to the \nimplementing partners in three withdrawals: (i) advance, (ii) on completion of 50% of \nhouses, and (iii) on completion of 100% of houses. Direct payments will be \ncontingent on appropriate certifications by the project management consultant (firm). \nComponent 3: The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed by the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; EARR = Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Reconstruction; MOES = Ministry \nof Emergency Situations; MOF = Ministry of Finance; QCBS = quality and cost-based selection; SAAC = State \nAgency for Architecture and Construction, SAEPF = State Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry; SDRD \n= State Directorate for Reconstruction and Development of Osh and Jalal-Abad  \na SDRD operations will be financed by government share in EARR cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGiven  the  urgent  EARR  needs,  procurement  of  goods,  services,  and  works  will  be \n25. \ncarried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient procedures permitted under \nthe  DEAP  and  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nRelaxation  of  international  competitive  bidding  requirements  for  works  and  goods  with  an \nabbreviated  bidding  and  evaluation  period  will  expedite  contract  awards  under  the  EARR  (as \ndetailed  in  the  project  administration  manual).  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nAfter the conflicts, the immediate task is to stop further economic slippage. By providing \n26. \nadditional liquidity protection against revenue shortfalls, fiscal support will help the government \nimplement  its  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus,  fueling  economic  growth  to  make  economic \nactivities  more  viable.  Given  the  total  destruction  in  many  areas,  any  support  is  likely  to  bring \nsignificant  incremental  benefits  to  the  affected  population.  Support  for  the  restoration  of \ndamaged  houses  will  have  beneficial  economic  and  social  outcomes.  By  providing  essential \npublic services and rebuilding infrastructure, the EARR\u2019s investment component will have direct \nand  indirect  impacts  on  economic  revival.  Financial  and  economic  assessment  will  be \nconducted for investments made under component 3, and only those assessed to be financial \nand economically viable will be undertaken. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  2009  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  found  that  the \n27. \neffectiveness of the public financial management systems varied across stages. It found budget \nclassification, preparation, and execution reporting satisfactory. However, internal audits are not \nin  line  with  international  standards  and  the  scope  of  external  audit  is  not  comprehensive.  To \nmitigate the weakness in the government audit system, the EARR will require the government to \nestablish  a  special  account  in  the  National  Bank  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  grant  and  loan \nproceeds  for  component  1.  ADB  will  regularly  monitor  this  account,  and  public  expenditures \nfinanced  out  of  the  som  conversion  of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds.  The  government  will  also \nsubmit  sections  of  the  2010  budget  execution  report  pertaining  to  the  eligible  expenditures \nunder component 1. These requirements will be reflected in the financing agreement. \n\n28. \nSDRD  currently  comprises  administrative  and  field  staff  appointed  to  oversee  the \nreconciliation  process.  It  has  limited  knowledge  of  ADB  procurement  procedures.  Hence, \nprocurement will be conducted with assistance of the project management consultant (firm). It \nwill also create a safeguards unit to ensure all activities are compliant with EARR environmental \nand social safeguard requirements. \n\n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  including  MOF  and  SDRD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any allegedly corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nthe  EARR.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the loan and grant regulations and the bidding documents. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the EARR will include provisions specifying the right of ADB \nto  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  MOF  and  SDRD  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers  as they relate to the EARR.  Specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nBy supporting critical social expenditures and rebuilding physical assets, the EARR will \nmitigate  the  short-  and  medium-term  poverty  and  social  impact  of  the  emergency.  Protecting \nsocial assistance expenditures will lessen the risk of reversal in the social assistance reforms. It \nwill also support uninterrupted delivery of education and health services. This will address the \npossible  deterioration  of  social  services,  which  could  occur  as  a  result  of  the  emergency  and \nwould  especially  burden  the  most  vulnerable  population  groups  such  as  poor  households \nheaded by women.  \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \nThe EARR is classified as category C for (i) involuntary resettlement; and (ii) indigenous \npeoples.  The  EARR  will  not  finance  activities  that  require  land  acquisition,  involuntary \nresettlement and/or impact on indigenous peoples, or are associated with such activities.  \n\n32.  With respect to indigenous peoples, the classification reflects the fact that ethnic groups \nin the Kyrgyz Republic do not fit the indigenous people definition under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009).  However,  when  supporting  critical social  expenditures  and  housing,  as  well \nas  reconciliation  efforts  benefiting  people  affected  by  the  emergency,  the  EARR  will  exercise \nextensive due diligence to ensure that these benefits are equitable among all affected groups. \nStakeholder consultations involving all affected families and community representatives will be \nan  integral  part  of  the  EARR.  Consultations  will  be  well  documented  and  reported  to  ADB  for \nreview and, if required, specific actions and/or programs for identified vulnerable groups might \nbe  prepared  and  integrated  into  the EARR\u2019s  activities.  The  social  development  specialist  from \nthe  project  management  consultant  (firm)  will  be  involved  in  preparing,  implementing,  and \nmonitoring social programs for vulnerable groups. \n\nThe  EARR \n\nis  classified  as  B \n\nInitial  environmental \n33. \nthe \nexaminations  and  environmental  management  plans  will  be  prepared  based  on \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  which  is  based  on  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of the government and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n\nfor  environmental \n\nimpacts. \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34. \nThe  benefits  of  the  EARR,  both  short-  and  medium-term,  are  contingent  on  mitigating \npotential  risks.  Measures  to  mitigate  different  types  of  risks  are  incorporated  in  the  EARR\u2019s \ndesign. One important assumption is that the government is able to reestablish political stability. \nADB will work closely with the government and other JEA partners to monitor results and track \naid  to  the  government.  Overall,  the  EARR\u2019s  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6.  \n\nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nRenewed community tension \n\nStructural damage to houses and \ninfrastructure due to seismic \nactivity \n\nLack of institutional capacity and \nexperience in housing \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe EARR\u2019s fiscal support component helps maintain critical public \nexpenditures that benefit the entire population. The housing component is \nbased on technical assessment of damaged houses in affected areas. The \ncommunity infrastructure and water supply component is a complementary \nintervention benefiting the entire communities in Osh and Jalal-Abad. \nADB and the government will ensure that all designs and construction of \nhouses meet acceptable structural and geotechnical standards. The project \nmanagement consultant (firm) will provide quality assurance on technical \naspects. \nADB and the government will partner with experienced development partners \nand international nongovernment organizations in project implementation. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nreconstruction \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nSystemic banking risks are \naggravated requiring additional \nfiscal support \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  EBRD  =  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development;  IMF  = \nInternational Monetary Fund; NBKR = National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nThe IMF and EBRD are advising NBKR on this issue. ADB will closely \ncoordinate with the IMF and EBRD in monitoring the situation.  \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n35. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the EARR will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and financing documents.  \n\nThe government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the EARR, which are set \n\n36. \nforth in the financing agreement. \n\n37. \nNo withdrawal will be made (i) under component 1 until the revised government budget \nfor  financial  year  2010  has  been  approved  for  submission  to  the  Parliament;  and  (ii)  under \ncomponent  2  until  an  agreement  for  implementation  of  component  2,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  has  been  entered  into  between  the  government  and  the  implementing \npartners, except for specified retroactively financed activities. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n38. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR32,057,000  to  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  for  the  Emergency  Assistance  for  Recovery  and  Reconstruction  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum;  for  a  term  of  40  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years;  with \nrepayment  of  principal  at  2%  per  annum  for  the  first  10  years  after  the  grace \nperiod and 4% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft financing agreement \npresented to the Board; \n\nthe grant not exceeding $51,500,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds \nfor  Recovery  and \nReconstruction, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft financing agreement presented to the Board; and  \n\nthe  Emergency  Assistance \n\nresources \n\nfor \n\n(iii) \n\nwaiver  of  the  requirement  that  quick-disbursing  components  finance  a  list  of \nimports as discussed more fully in paragraph 24 of this report. \n\n \n\nC.
