As  of  15  April  2020,  there  were  5,136  confirmed  cases  of \nCOVID-19 in Indonesia and 469 deaths. Indonesia is highly vulnerable to pandemics, and has \nthe  highest  COVID-19  related  fatality  rate  of  any  country  in  Southeast  Asia. 2  Public  health \nmeasures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have seriously disrupted economic activity, and \nthe Government projects 2020 to produce the lowest economic growth level in 21 years (2.3%), \ndown  from  an  original  estimate  of  5.2%.  Other  institutions  have  also  revised  their  growth \nexpectations downwards, with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) projecting a 2020 growth rate \nof 2.5%, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting 0.5%.3 Each of these outlooks has \nrisks tilted towards the downside.   \n \n3. \nThe  crisis  is  also  having  a  significant  impact  on  livelihoods,  especially  within  the  most \nvulnerable communities.  Close to ten million people are at risk of falling below the national poverty \nline, with poverty incidence expected to increase from 9.4% in March 2019 to between 11.9%-\n12.8% in 2020. The Government estimates that 5.2 million Indonesians will lose their jobs due to \nthe COVID-19 induced economic slowdown.  \n \nThese shocks severely impact the government\u2019s fiscal position and give rise to urgent and \n4. \nlarge near-term financing needs.  The economic slowdown is expected to produce a 20% shortfall \nin revenue relative to projections for 2020, with the reduction concentrated in the second quarter \nof 2020. At the same time, the government must undertake significant fiscal actions in response \nto  the  crisis  and  has  announced  a  $32.4  billion  package  for  urgently  needed  health,  social \nassistance, and economic support measures. The additional gross financing requirement for 2020 \nis estimated at $39.8 billion.  \n \nOfficial  financing  is  of  heightened  importance  in  this  context.    Global  uncertainty  has \n5. \nunnerved financial markets resulting in sudden capital flight, depreciation of the rupiah to levels \nunseen  since  the  1998  Asian  financial  crisis,  and  a  sharp  increase  in  bond  yields.    Liquidity \nconditions are also deteriorating in domestic credit markets, and borrowing costs are rising. There \nis  a  heightened  risk  that  government  debt  issuance  could  crowd  out  potential  financing  for  an \neven more liquidity constrained private sector.  \n \n6. \nThe  proposed  CARES  program  is  critical.  The  CARES  program  will  provide  timely \nsupport  for  urgent  public  health  measures  and  for  the  expansion  of  social  and  economic \nassistance. It builds on ADB\u2019s trusted relationship with the Government of Indonesia through long-\nstanding engagement. Indonesia meets all of the access criteria of ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Pandemic \nResponse Option (CPRO) under the Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF), which include robust \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2020.

Coordination with \n\nInternational Monetary \nFund \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government projects 2020 to produce \nthe lowest economic growth level in 21 years at 2.3%, down from an original \nestimate of 5.2%, with employment loss projected at as many as 7 million. \nGross  financing  requirements  have  substantially  increased  due  to  falling \npublic  revenue  and  increased  expenditure,  resulting  in  a  widening  fiscal \ndeficit.  Unfavorable  liquidity  conditions  and  rising  costs  pose  a  severe \nchallenge to meeting additional financing needs.  \nThe  government  has  announced  a  pro-poor  countercyclical  expenditure \nprogram  of  $32.4  billion  to  support  public  health,  social  assistance,  and \neconomic measures towards mitigating the adverse impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic.  About  20.2%  of  the  package,  $6.5  billion,  will  be  in  the  form  of \nsocial assistance programs for poor and vulnerable households. \nPrior  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  economy  expanded  by  5.0%  on \naverage during 2015\u20132019. Inflation has been carefully managed and was \nonly 2.8% in 2019. The tax-to-GDP ratio averaged 10.2% over 2015-2019. \nThe fiscal deficit averaged only 2.3% between 2015-2019. \nIndonesia is taking credible steps to address the spread of COVID-19 and \nmitigate its economic impacts on the population (Tables 3 and 4). To address \nthe  health  crisis, \nthe  World  Health  Organization\u2019s \nrecommendation, \nthe  government  emphasizes  clinical  management \nparticularly  of  severe  and  critical  cases,  infection  prevention  and  control \namong health workers and the general population. It announced a $4.5 billion \nhealth response package. As presented in Table 4, besides support for the \nhealth  sector,  the  government\u2019s  response  consists  of  3  packages  with \nsupport  covering  social  assistance,  small  business  recovery  program,  and \ntax relief for manufacturing workers. The government established a COVID-\n19 task force chaired by the head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency \nwith senior representatives from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of State-\nOwned Enterprises, Indonesian Military, and the National Police.   \nCentral government debt increased marginally from 26.2% of GDP to 29.8% \nof  GDP  between  2010\u20132019  as \ninfrastructure \naccelerated.  Additional  borrowing  under  the  CPRO  has  minimal  (0.2%) \nimpact on debt\u2013GDP ratio.  \nADB  is  in  close  contact  with  the  IMF  on  macroeconomic  monitoring, \nparticularly on the impact of COVID-19 and fiscal responses.

COVID-19 is a \nrecently  discovered  infectious  disease,  and  from  the  same  family  of  viruses  that  triggered  the \n\n4  Details on compliance with the access criteria are in Appendix 4.  \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\fsevere  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)  outbreak  in  2003  and  the  Middle  East  respiratory \nsyndrome  (MERS)  outbreak  in  2012.  Its  outbreak  was  initially  identified  in  Wuhan,  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, and the first official death was recorded on 9 January 2020. By 30 January \n2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health \nemergency of global concern, and later declared it a pandemic.5 COVID-19 has now spread to \n185  countries,  areas  and  territories.  Globally,  the  preliminary  estimated  death  rate  is  between \n3%\u20134%, although there continue to be significant data limitations.  Death rates are higher for older \npeople and for those with underlying health conditions.6 As of 15 April 2020, over 2 million people \nwere recorded as infected, with more than 134,000 deaths reported globally.7 In contrast, SARS \nresulted in 813 deaths and MERS in 858 deaths globally.8 \n \n8. \nGlobal commerce is grinding to a halt. Countries are now learning that flattening the \npandemic curve inevitably steepens the macroeconomic recession curve.9 Low income countries \nface  particular  challenges  due  to  severe  deficiencies  in  health  services.  Many  countries  have \nrestricted citizens\u2019 mobility and are requesting people to stay home in order to contain the spread  \nof the virus and prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems. As a result, economic activity \nhas been seriously curtailed, with factories suspending production and retail trade restricted to \nessential services. The ultimate health and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 will depend on \nhow the spread of the disease continues to evolve; the effectiveness of public health care systems \nand  policies;  communities\u2019  behavioral  responses;  and  national,  regional,  and  global \nmacroeconomic  and  fiscal  responses.  As  of  3  April  2020,  ADB  estimated  the  impact  of  the \npandemic  on  global  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  be  in  the  range  of  -2.3%  to  -4.8%.  On  \n14  April  2020,  the  IMF  released  economic  growth  projections  of  -0.6%  for  ASEAN-5,  on  the \nassumption that the United States (US) and eurozone economies would contract by -5.9% and -\n7.9% respectively.10  \n \n\nFigure 1: National COVID-19 Trends in Indonesia \n\n6000\n\n5000\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nr\na\nM\n5\n1\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n7\n1\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n9\n1\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n1\n2\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n3\n2\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n5\n2\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n7\n2\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n9\n2\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n1\n3\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n2\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n4\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n6\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n8\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n0\n1\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n2\n1\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n4\n1\n\n \n\nCumulative Cases (since 100th case)\n\nSource: https://www.covid19.go.id/situasi-virus-corona/ \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n5\n1\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n7\n1\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n9\n1\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n1\n2\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n3\n2\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n5\n2\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n9\n2\n\n \n\nr\na\nM\n1\n3\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n2\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n4\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n6\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n8\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n0\n1\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n2\n1\n\n \n\nr\np\nA\n4\n1\n\n \n\nTotal Number of Patients Recovered\nTotal Number of Deaths\n\n5  WHO  declared  COVID-19  a  pandemic  on  11  March  2020.  https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-\n\ngeneral-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020 (accessed on 3 April 2020). \n\n6  WHO. 2020.

World  Economic \n\nOutlook, April 2020 - The Great Lockdown. Washington, DC. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f9. \nCOVID-19  cases  and  deaths  are  rapidly  increasing  in  Indonesia,  leaving  many \nhouseholds highly vulnerable to health and income shocks. As of 15 April 2020, Indonesia \nhad 5,136 positive cases and 469 deaths (Figure 1). Three regions\u2014Jakarta, Bali, and Banten\u2014\nwere hit particularly hard. There is concern that these figures may not show the complete picture, \ndue to many undetected cases arising from the low number of tests carried out to date, and some \nmodels suggest that the true number of positive cases could be between 70,000 and 250,000.11 \nAs  the  number  of  cases  has  grown,  so  has  the  number  of  deaths;  Indonesia\u2019s  fatality  rate  of \napproximately 8% is one of the highest in the world. Given Indonesia\u2019s weak health care system \nand  institutions,  the  Citibank  Pandemic  Vulnerability  Index  shows  Indonesia  as  the  third  most \nvulnerable  to  pandemics  in  Asia.  Poor  and  vulnerable  households  could  face  increased  food \ninsecurity due to loss of income as well as food shortages. Even prior to the outbreak, 19.4 million \npeople were unable to meet their dietary requirements, with 37.2% of children under the age of 5 \nexperiencing stunting, which will be further worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.12  \n \n10. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic is further straining an already overburdened health care \nsystem. The pandemic will put increasing pressure on Indonesia\u2019s health system, which already \nlags behind its regional peers in terms of main health indicators. For example, Indonesia has only \n3.7 doctors per 10,000 people (the Republic of Korea has six times more); and only 10 hospital \nbeds per 10,000 people and 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people, which is among the lowest \nin the region.13 Table 2 shows a comparative analysis of various Southeast Asian countries on \nkey indicators.14 The rapidly increasing burden on Indonesia\u2019s health care system from the spread \nof  COVID-19  will  impede:  (i)  surveillance  and  diagnosis,  including  testing;  (ii)  health  service \ndelivery in terms of both equipment and personnel; (iii) infection prevention and control; and (iv) \nhealth  financing  protection.  Indonesia\u2019s  health  workers  are  overburdened  (approximately  26 \nmedical doctors and nine nurses have passed away due to COVID-19 infection or exhaustion)15 \nand are under intense strain due to limited personal protective equipment. Even before COVID-\n19,  the  health  insurance  system  was  suffering  from  constant  deficits,  resulting  in  underfunded \nfacilities.  Moreover,  as  the  focus  and  fiscal  support  are  being  diverted  to  address  COVID-19, \npatients are less likely to be able to access routine health services and receive medical care for \nacute and chronic conditions. This will result in devastating outcomes for the population at large, \nnot just for those infected by COVID-19.16  \n\nTable 2: Summary Comparison of COVID-19 Related Data and Effects  \n\nCountry \n\nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nSingapore \nThailand \nViet Nam \n\nNo. of \ncases \n(as of \n15 April \n2020) \n5,136  \n5,072  \n5,453  \n3,699  \n2,643  \n   267  \n\nTests processed \nper 1 million \npopulation  \n(as of  \n15 April 2020) \n   132  \n2,694  \n   415  \n12,423  \n  1,440  \n  1,397  \n\nCritical \ncare \nbeds/ \n100,000 \n\n   2.7 \n   3.4 \n   2.2 \n11.4 \n10.4 \nNA \n\nGDP \nforecasta\n/ fiscal \ndeficit \n(%) \n0.5/-5.1 \n-2.0/-4.7 \n-1.0/-5.3 \n-4.0/-8.9 \n-5.3/-7.0 \n4.8/-5.1 \n\nJob \nlosses \n(million) \n\n7 \n2.4 \n4.3 \n0.15\u20130.2 \n1.8\u20133.1 \n1.3 \n\nPoverty \nestimates \n(pre-/post-\nCOVID-19; \n(%) \n9.4/11.9\u201312.8 \n0.4/NA \n16.6/20.7 \nNA \n10.0/18.0 \n5.8/NA \n\nAnnounced \nstimulus \npackage  \n($ billion) \n\n32.4 \n60.3 \n12.1 \n43.7 \n73.2 \n10.8 \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, NA = data not available. \n\n \n\n11 https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/current-patterns-transmission/cases-from-deaths.html  \n12 https://www.wfp.org/countries/indonesia  \n13 Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  Data.  2019.

Indonesian manufacturing \n11. \nfirms  reported  a  steep  downturn  in  March  2020,  with  production  and  new  orders  sharply \ncontracting. As global public health measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have ramped \nup, tourist arrivals have come to an abrupt halt, and domestic industry and service activities have \ndecelerated.  Simulation  results  using  Indonesia\u2019s  computable  general  equilibrium  model \n(IndoTERM) indicate that a 1-month-long national disruption could result in a drop in the output \nof hotels by 11.54% and of restaurants by 7.86% in 2020 (Figure 3a).17 Transport, construction, \nfood processing, and other manufacturing outputs would also suffer serious impacts. The most \nseverely affected regions of Banten, Jakarta, and Bali are expected to sustain a sharp deviation \nfrom their baseline growth in 2020 (Figure 3b). The government projects that economic growth in \n2020  will  see  a  very  steep  decline,  from  the  pre-COVID-19  projection  of  5.2%  to  2.3%. \nFurthermore, business shutdowns have already resulted in job losses and declines in consumer \nsentiment, particularly in urban areas. Household budgets are likely to come under stress from \njob  losses  and  increased  health  care  spending,  with  discretionary  expenditures  expected  to \nshrink. \n \n\nFigure 3a: Top 5 Most Affected Sectors \n(% reduction in sector output in 2020) \n \n\n Figure 3b: Regions Most Severely Affected \n (% deviation from baseline growth in 2020) \n\nRestaurants\n\n-7.86\n\nHotels\n\n-11.54\n\nTransport\n\nConstruction\n\nOther manufacturing\n\nFood Processing\n\n-5.67\n\n-3.07\n\n-1.37\n\n-2.87\n\n-15.00\n\n-10.00\n\n-5.00\n\n0.00\n\nBali\n\n-5.73\n\nEast Java\n\nYogyakarta\n\nCentral Java\n\n-4.17\n\n-4.12\n\n-4.10\n\nBanten\n\n-5.74\n\nWest Java\n\nJakarta\n\n-5.03\n\n-5.51\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n12. \nEconomic slowdown threatens gains made in job creation. As measures to mitigate \nthe  health  impacts  of  COVID-19  are  implemented,  the  labor  market  has  been  affected.  It  is \nestimated that job losses due to shutdown of the economy could be in the range of 1 million to  \n7 million under ADB\u2019s current best-case and worst-case scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 on \nIndonesia\u2019s  economy.  As  of  11  April  2020,  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  reported  that  1.5  million \nworkers had already been put on unpaid leave or laid off. It is estimated that this will result in the \nunemployment rate almost doubling from 5.3% in 2019 to 10.5% in 2020. Wage income losses \nwill be influenced by the effectiveness of measures to protect the 33 million male and 18 million \nfemale  employees  (40%  of  total  employment)  in  the  formal  economy.  The  71  million  self-\nemployed, casual employees, and unpaid workers who are not covered by employment protection \nlegislation\u2014accounting for approximately 53% of total employment\u2014will have very limited options \n\n \n\n17 A. Yusuf. 2020. Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Indonesia. Background analysis for ADB\u2019s COVID-\n19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program in Indonesia. Jakarta. (unpublished). IndoTERM is a bottom \nup multiregional computable general equilibrium model. The model was developed through a collaborative effort from \nIndonesia\u2019s National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS); Center for Economics and Development Studies \n(CEDS), Universitas Padjadjaran, Indonesia; Center of Policy Studies (CoPS), Monash University, Australia; and, \nADB. The analysis did not include the impact of the fiscal measures.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\ffor respite. One in five men and one in three women work in the wholesale or retail trade and in \naccommodation and food services, and many of these jobs are informal. Occupations in these \nsectors, as well as in construction, agriculture, manufacturing, and transport, are less amenable \nto work-from-home  arrangements  and exposed to downturns in  business  volumes.  Temporary \nemployees and casual workers are usually the first to be laid off as business slows.  \n \n13. \nIncome  losses  will  result  in  higher  poverty  rates.  It  is  estimated  that  the  national \npoverty  rate may  increase from  a baseline  of  9.4%  in March  2019 to 11.9%\u201312.8%  in 2020.18 \nWhile the severity in the hike of poverty may vary by province, those provinces that have economic \nactivities  with  strong  links  to  commodity  trade,  tourism,  and  manufacturing  are  likely  to  be  hit \nhardest. \n \n14. \nThe  health  and  economic  shocks  are  cascading  into  the  financial  and  external \nsectors.  Indonesia  is  experiencing  a  sudden  capital  outflow  due  to  a  change  in  global  risk \nsentiment resulting in investors\u2019 exiting emerging markets. From January to April 2020, cumulative \nportfolio outflow stood at $9.6 billion, compared to inflow of $5.7 billion during the same period in \n2019 (Figure 4a). These reversals increased bond yields by nearly 200 basis points and the rupiah \ndepreciated by approximately 20% to Rp16,741 against the US dollar\u2014to levels last seen during \nthe Asian financial crisis in 1998 (Figure 4b). To mitigate the market volatility caused by the capital \noutflows, the central bank bought $10.8 billion in local and foreign currency government bonds \nfrom  the  secondary  market,  of  which  $10.4  billion  was  from  foreign  investors,  leading  to  a \nreduction in international reserves of 6.8% to $121.0 billion. Key trading partners of Indonesia are \nfacing  sudden  economic  shutdowns  because  of  the  staggered  global  outbreak  of  COVID-19 \naffecting demand for Indonesia\u2019s exports. The continuing slump in oil and commodity prices due \nto the global economic slowdown will reduce Indonesia\u2019s export earnings, while travel disruptions \nwill  translate  into  lower  tourism  and  transport  receipts.  Disruptions  to  trade  flow  and  weak \ndomestic demand will lower overall imports. Seasonal dividend repatriations in primary income \nwill contribute to higher current account deficit in the near term. The current account deficit has \nbeen historically financed by net portfolio inflows, while the ongoing uncertainty has triggered a \nmass outflow of portfolio investment.  \n \nFigure 4a: Cumulative Portfolio Flow ($ billion) \n\n Figure 4b: Foreign Exchange Rate (Rp/$) \n\nEquity\nDebt\nTotal - 2019\nTotal\n\n-0.8\n\n-8.6\n\n-9.4\n\nJan-2020\n\nFeb-2020\n\nMar-2020\n\nApr-2020\n\nSource: Bank Indonesia; https://prospera.or.id.  \n \n15. \nGross  financing  needs  will  increase  due  to  the  countercyclical  measures.  The \ncentral government\u2019s revenue and grants in 2020 are projected to decline by $27 billion to $100.6 \nbillion from the pre-COVID-19 projection of $127.6 billion, with significant downside risks.

Continued  lower  commodity  prices  will  affect  export  earnings.  Public \nexpenditure is projected to increase to $149.4 billion from $145.2 billion, in part due to unplanned \nexpenditures  related  to  COVID-19  response.  The  government  has  deferred  $10.4  billion  in \nplanned  capital  spending,  and  reallocated  $3.1  billion  within  certain  sectors  due  to  COVID-19 \nrelated requirements. In 2020, the fiscal deficit is expected to increase to $48.7 billion (5.1% of \nGDP) from $17.6 billion (1.8% of GDP), and the gross financing needs are expected to almost \ndouble from $42.4 billion to $82.2 billion.  \n \n16. \nThe Government of Indonesia has responded well to meet the initial public health \nneeds.  On  13  April  2020,  President  Widodo  declared  the  COVID-19  pandemic  a  national \nemergency.19 On 13 March 2020, the government established a COVID-19 task force chaired by \nthe head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency with senior representatives from the Ministry \nof Health, the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, Indonesian Military, and the National Police. \nThe central government also issued a regulation to allow local governments to formally restrict \nthe movement of people and goods in their territory with approval from the minister of health.20 \nMeasures to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control are summarized in Table 3.  \n\n \nTable 3: Summary of Measures to Bring the COVID-19 Pandemic Under Control \nMeasure \nPreparedness plan \n\nSocial distancing \n\nMedical personnel \n\nTest kits and \nequipment \n\nRepurposing and \nbuilding of facilities \n\nDescription \nThe plan, based on technical advice from the World Health Organization, details: \n(i) clinical management, particularly of critical cases; (ii) infection prevention and \ncontrol  among  health  workers  and  the  general  population;  and  (iii)  specimen \nmanagement and laboratory confirmation to reduce the spread of COVID-19. \nSome  local governments have introduced social  distancing  measures to contain \nthe disease, such as a ban on mass gatherings, temporary closure of schools and \ntourist attractions, limitations of religious activities, and urged \u2018physical distancing\u2019 \nto reduce transmission. People may still travel to fulfil basic needs.  \nIn  addition  to  40,320  specialist  doctors,  the  government  has  deployed  students \nfrom  158  universities  and  15,000  volunteers.  Medical  personnel  are  promised \nbonuses (Rp15 million for specialist doctors, Rp10 million for general practitioners, \nRp7.5  million  for  midwives  and  nurses,  and  Rp5  million  for  other  medical \npersonnel). \nThe  government  has  made  available  approximately  1  million  kits  for  mass \nscreening, while prioritizing government workers for testing. Across 2,867 hospitals \nthroughout Indonesia, there are 8,413 ventilators available. \nThe  government  designated  132  referral  hospitals  containing  approximately \n41,000 beds for COVID-19 and repurposed the athletes\u2019 village used for the 2018 \nAsian Games in Jakarta into an emergency hospital containing 1,800 beds. The \ngovernment  purchased  175,000  new  sets  of  protective  equipment.  13  medical \nschools  and  13  teaching  hospitals  were  upgraded  to  serve  as  extra  COVID-19 \nlaboratories.  \nThe  government  temporarily  suspended  visa  issuance  for  all  countries  and \nexpanded restrictions to people from the worst-hit countries. \n\nVisa suspension \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, Rp= rupiah. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n\n \n\n19 On 28 January 2020, the government issued a disaster emergency decree, allowing the utilization of special fund to \n\nfight COVID-19, initially valid until 28 February 2020 and subsequently extended to 29 May 2020. \n\n20 Such restrictions have now been imposed in a number of provinces including Jakarta. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nPublic  spending  on  health  will  be  increased  substantially.  Prior  to  COVID-19,  the \n17. \ngovernment mandated that 5% of the total national budget be spent on health. Accordingly, $7.6 \nbillion\u2014comprising $5.6 billion for central government and $2.0 billion for regional transfers\u2014had \noriginally  been  allocated  for  2020. 21 This  indicates  approximately  13%  growth  in  the  budget \nbetween 2019 and 2020. To meet additional resource requirements because of COVID-19, the \ngovernment  has  allocated  an  additional  $4.3  billion  for  health,  equivalent  to  13.3%  of  the total \nstimulus package ($32.4 billion).22 With this additional allocation, the health budget will increase \nto an  all-time  high  of  8.1%  of the  national  budget.  Of  these funds,  $3.8  billion  will  be  used for \n\"health management expenditures\" such as medical devices and equipment, and health facilities \nand  infrastructure.  Subsidy  contributions  to  the  national  health  insurance  fund  will  also  be \nincreased  ($171  million),  especially  for  non-wage  workers  and  the  unemployed.23 Remaining \nresources will be spent on incentives for medical personnel over the next 6 months ($337 million), \ndeath benefits for health workers ($17 million), and other human resources support. Support for \nhealth workers is particularly important, given the significant strain that COVID-19 poses on the \nprofession.  Such  support  will  also  be  particularly  beneficial  for  women.  Of  the  over  1  million \nmedical professionals, 71% are female, with the ratio being 64% for general practitioners, 80% \nfor  pharmacists,  and  68%  for  nurses.24 In  addition  to  national  measures,  Indonesia  has  also \ncommitted to regional sharing of data and lessons learned.25   \n \n18. \nThe  government  has  formulated  a  strong  pro-poor  countercyclical  expenditure \nplan.  The  government  has  announced  fiscal  measures  worth  $32.4  billion  that  will  fund \nsubstantially increased public health measures, social assistance to the poor and vulnerable, and \nsupport to businesses (Table 4). A key component of the fiscal measures is to support enterprises \nincluding  affected  micro,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs).  This  includes  the \nnational recovery program, which will target real and finance sectors amounting to $8.9 billion. \nMeasures  also  include  capital  injection,  credit  restructuring  and  financing,  as  well  as  business \nfunding  guarantees.  The  government  will  subsidize  interest  for  MSMEs  credit  and  will  provide \ntransfers  to  subnational  governments  for  tax  waivers.  The  government  is  providing  relief  to \nmanufacturing workers by extending a tax holiday for workers with an annual income of less than \n$14,000. It is supporting the productive sectors by lowering corporate taxes, suspending import \ntaxes, and accelerating valued-added tax restitution for 19 manufacturing subsectors for up to 6 \nmonths. In addition to the new resources allocated, President Widodo instructed all ministries and \nlocal governments to limit their budget spending, so that funds can be reallocated to tackle the \nCOVID-19  pandemic  and  to  maintain  people\u2019s  purchasing  power.  The  government  is  closely \nmonitoring the situation and considering further fiscal stimulus measures as needed. The fiscal \nimpact of the stimulus packages could be significant in restarting growth in the economy due to \nthe multiplier effects of their spending and tax relief components. Preliminary estimates by ADB \nshow that the  overall  impact  of the  $32.4 billion  fiscal  package  (2.7%  of GDP)  could  lead to  a \ncumulative increase in real GDP of $38.2 billion after one year, and $44.4 billion after two years, \nequivalent to 3.2% and 3.7% of GDP, respectively.26 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n21 https://www.kemenkeu.go.id/apbn2020. \n22 Total health package is $4.48billion is the sum of $4.3 billion in additional to $180 million of budget reallocation. \n23 Press Conference: Measures to Strengthen Protection and Economic Stimulus Facing the Impact of Covid-19, 1 April \n\n24 Ministry of Health. 2019.

In addition to the increased budget \nallocation to the health sector (para. 15), the government is providing additional social assistance \nto  poor  and  vulnerable  households  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  through  its  flagship  social \nassistance  and  social  protection  programs,  amounting  to  $6.4  billion  (Table  5).27 While  these \nprograms are available for all poor and vulnerable groups (as defined under a registry held by the \nMinistry of Social Affairs), two programs specifically target mothers and children. Under the Family \nHope  Program  (PKH),  a  conditional  cash  transfer  program,  women  are  encouraged  to  utilize \nhealth facilities for prenatal and antenatal care and ensure that children attend school. Women \nare also usually the attendees of the family development sessions, which are learning sessions \non  topics  such  as  health,  nutrition  and  early  learning.  The  Kartu  Sembako  food  assistance \nprogram  provides  basic  commodities  to  mothers,  who  are  usually  responsible  for  buying  and \ncooking for the household. In addition, electricity subsidies and housing incentives for the poor \nare included. These social assistance programs complement additional funds for social protection \nprograms such as education subsidies, strengthening market and logistics operations, and the \nKartu Pra Kerja program, which subsidizes vouchers for unemployed workers for skilling and re-\nskilling.  \n \n\n27 There  is  robust  evidence  showing  the  positive  outcomes  of  the  social  and  food  assistance  programs  on  health, \neducation  and  social  welfare.

Before COVID-19, \nrecipients were entitled to purchase \na range of food (rice, eggs, basic \nprotein) to the value of Rp150,000 \nper month. In response to COVID-\n19, the government temporarily \nincreased the value to Rp200,000 \nuntil November, and will increase \ncoverage to 20 million households. \nKartu Sembako recipients are \nnormally mothers as they take prime \nresponsibility for shopping and \ncooking for their families.  \n\nPKH is a conditional cash transfer \nprogram offering cash assistance to \n9.2 million households with mothers \nand children, upon fulfillment of health \ncare utilization and school attendance \nconditions. Payments are usually \ndisbursed every fourth month. In \nresponse to the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19), the government paid out \nthe July tranche in April and will \nhenceforth disburse every month. It is \nalso considering increasing the \ncoverage to 10 million households and \nwill increase the assistance for \nhouseholds with pregnant women by \n25% for 3 month.

The government\u2019s package includes the simplification of requirements for imports \nand  exports,  including  raw  materials,  to  increase  the  competitiveness  of  enterprises.  The \ngovernment also reduced the number of import procedures for strategic food products such as \nsalt, sugar, flour, corn, meat, and potatoes. Employers in affected sectors are supported through \nthe  temporary  suspension  of  mandated  contributions  to  death  and  accident  insurance,  which \nreduces enterprise operating costs. \n  \nRegulatory  non-fiscal  measures  to  support  MSMEs  and  workers.  The  Financial \n21. \nServices Authority (OJK) issued a regulation in March 2020 to enable banks to support MSMEs \naffected by COVID-19. Banks can provide loans of up to $600,000 equivalent based on a debtor\u2019s \ncredit  history  with  relaxed  requirements  for  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and  debt \nquality assessment thus allowing banks to restructure existing MSMEs loans. Based on this new \nrule,  the  four  state-owned  banks  have  collectively  restructured  approximately  $1.84  billion  of \nloans. These measures will help reduce the adverse impact on banks as well as increase access \nto credit for MSMEs.  The government is accelerating the rollout of Kartu Pra Kerja program (para. \n17) and has doubled the allocation to the program. The program will benefit 5.6 million informal \nworkers. In addition, workers who have lost their job may apply for early withdrawal of savings \nfrom the provident fund.  \n \nCoordinated  monetary  and  financial  sector  supervision  responses.  In  Indonesia, \n22. \ncoordination between the MOF, Bank Indonesia, and the OJK has been very close in recent years \nreflecting the  government\u2019s commitment to financial  stability.28 All  three have coordinated  their \npolicy  responses  for  COVID-19  quite  closely.  To  help  counter  the  economic  slowdown,  Bank \n\n28 In  2015,  the  government  established  the  Financial  Sector  Stability  Forum,  which  comprises  the  MOF,  Bank \nIndonesia,  OJK,  and  the  Indonesia  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation.  The  forum  covers  surveillance,  exchange  of \ninformation, and implementation of crisis management protocols. \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fIndonesia lowered its policy rate, the 7-day reverse repurchase rate, in February and March 2020 \nby  a  total  of  50  basis  points  to  4.5%.  Bank  Indonesia  lowered  the  reserve  requirements  for \ncommercial  banks  from  8%  to  4%  and  extended  the  government  securities  repo  tenor  to  \n12  months,  with  daily  auctions  to  ensure  rupiah  banking  liquidity.  On  31  March  2020,  the \ngovernment  issued  a  government  regulation-in-lieu-of-law  that  allows  the  Indonesia  Deposit \nInsurance Corporation to merge banks and carry out bailouts to address strains on the banking \nsystem. It will also allow the central bank to buy government debt directly (in addition to purchases \nvia the secondary market, as has been the practice), with the proceeds being used to provide \nsupport  to  distressed  companies  and  provide  the  government  with  liquidity  to  implement  its \ncountercyclical measures.  \n \n23. \nTo support exchange rate stability, minimize speculation, and smooth investment outflows, \nBank  Indonesia  strengthened  interventions  in  the  bond,  spot,  and  domestic  non-deliverable \nforward (DNDF) markets. This involves broadening the collateral used for DNDF transactions to \ninclude proceeds from the sale of government bonds and including DNDF as part of banks\u2019 net \nopen positions to mitigate the spike in the rupiah hedging cost. Interventions in the first quarter of \n2020 helped preserve local currency money market liquidity, despite capital outflows. In addition, \nto alleviate foreign exchange pressures and increase foreign exchange liquidity in the banking \nsubsector, Bank Indonesia committed to remaining in the market to stabilize the rupiah by selling \ndollars through spot and DNDF. Bank Indonesia also agreed on a $60 billion repo deal with the \nUS Federal Reserve to boost dollar liquidity supply in addition to existing bilateral swaps. As of  \n12 March 2020, Bank Indonesia had purchased Rp130 trillion ($8.2 billion) worth of government \nbonds since the beginning of the year to moderate capital outflow.  \n \n24. \nIndonesia  had  demonstrated  sound  macroeconomic  management  prior  to  the \nshock.  The  fiscal  position  of Indonesia  has  been maintained at  a  healthy  level,  with the  fiscal \ndeficit below the legally stipulated ceiling of 3% of GDP between 2000 and 2019 and the debt-to-\nGDP ratio remaining low and sustainable. Inflation has been at the lower end of the central bank\u2019s \ntarget range and official reserves remain ample to cover imports and debt repayment. Indonesia \nhas effectively managed past external headwinds through sound macroeconomic management.29 \nFinally,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  2017  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  (PEFA) \nassessment  noted  that  Indonesia  has  a  well-functioning  public  financial  management  (PFM) \nsystem.30 It concluded that Indonesia has a strong legal and regulatory framework, especially on \nfiscal management and control of budget execution.  \n \nADB  has  longstanding  engagement  in  public  sector  management.31 In  2002,  ADB \n25. \nhelped  set  up  national  and  subnational  public  expenditure  management  systems  after  the \nintroduction  of  decentralization  reforms.  This  was  followed  by  ADB  support  in  2005  for \ngovernment efforts to build a modern national PFM system, including a public debt management \noffice. In 2008, ADB provided support to introduce financial management information systems in \n147 local  governments and to decentralize the  tax framework.  Since  2012,  ADB  has  provided \ntechnical  assistance to improve  the  fiscal sustainability  of  social  security,  strengthen the fiscal \ndecentralization  framework,  and  improve  the  fiscal  risk  management  of  contingent  liabilities \narising  from  accelerated  infrastructure  investment.  During  2016\u20132019,  ADB  assisted  the \n\n-consultation-with-indonesia \n\n \n\n29 https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2019/07/31/pr19305-indonesia-imf-executive-board-concludes-2019-article-iv \n\n30 World  Bank.  2017.

It  established  a  national  coordination  team  for  SDG  implementation, \nchaired by President Widodo, to oversee SDG implementation progress. The government also \nlaunched an SDG road map, which includes a financing chapter for SDG implementation. The \nroad  map  assesses  the  costs  of  the  various  SDG  programs,  government  resources,  and \ninnovative means to enable private sector financing. The government\u2019s commitment to the SDGs \nis reflected in its increased budget allocation for pro-poor expenditure.  \n \nLessons learned. ADB has provided two countercyclical programs in Indonesia, in 2009 \n27. \nand  in  2012  (precautionary  financing  option).  The  CARES  program  benefited  from  lessons \nlearned from both program completion reports (PCR).32 First, Indonesia\u2019s fiscal stimulus package \nduring  2009  was  successful  because  measures  included  tax  cuts,  social  spending,  and  labor-\nintensive  small-scale  infrastructure  projects,  coupled  with  effective  and  regular  monitoring  and \nreporting  mechanisms.  The  CARES  program  includes  an  elaborate  monitoring  and  reporting \nmechanism  including  committees  involving  government,  private  sector  and  civil  society \norganizations that will be active throughout the implementation period. Second, the PCR found \nthat the 2009 CSF would have been more effective had it been in place at the time the  global \nfinancial crisis began in the third quarter of 2008. This is a strong rationale for early processing of \nthe CARES program to assist the government\u2019s timely action to stabilize the economy. Third, the \n2012 precautionary financing facility was part of a contingent financing option provided by ADB, \nthe Government of Australia, the Government of Japan, and the World Bank. The government \nbenefited from the partnership with cofinanciers through the provision of high-quality economic \nsurveillance. ADB is also collaborating closely with other development partners, including the IMF, \nin  the  design  of  the  CARES  program.  Some  development  partners  have  indicated  interest  in \ncofinancing the program.  \n \nB. \n \nThe CARES program will support the government in its continuing effort to address critical \n28. \npublic health risks while also managing a sharp economic downturn, particularly through timely \ncountercyclical  fiscal  measures.  ADB\u2019s  budget  support  will  allow  the  government  to  protect \nurgently  needed  social  expenditures  and  expand  its  social  assistance  programs  for  the  poor, \nincluding households headed by women, elderly people, and people with disabilities, to reduce \nthe  adverse  social  and  economic  impacts  of  COVID-19.  The  CARES  program  is  aligned  with  \n(i)  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Indonesia,  2016\u20132019,  especially  with  its  focus  on \neconomic governance and disaster risk management; and (ii) ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, in particular \nthe operational priorities on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, and fostering regional cooperation and integration.33  \n \n29. \nThe impact of the program will be that adverse impacts of COVID-19 on health, livelihoods \nand  economy  are  mitigated.  The  outcome  will  be  that  COVID-19  outbreak  more  effectively \nmanaged  and  its  social  and economic  damages  mitigated,  which will  be  achieved through the \n\nProposed Program, Impacts and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n \n\n32 ADB.  2011.

ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  COVID-19  response  builds  on  its  long-\nstanding partnership with Indonesia especially in the areas of economic governance and reform \nand disaster and emergency risk management and finance. ADB\u2019s financial support package to \nthe  government  in  responding  to  the  COVID  situation  includes  a  closely  linked  and  well \nsequenced set  of  support measures  involving:  (i)  quick  disbursing  budget  support  through the \nCARES program to bolster critical public spending and countercyclical fiscal stimulus; (ii) health \nsector emergency support; (iii) disaster risk financing; and (iv) structural reform support to bolster \neconomic  recovery.  The  financial  support  package  is  complemented  by  technical  advice  and \nknowledge support. ADB closely engages with MOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency to jointly analyze and \nmonitor the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic. The analysis supports policy development \nand provides diagnostics to inform development financing needs and initiatives to be included in \nfuture fiscal measures. Through technical assistance, ADB is also strengthening the capacity of \nPKH  and  Kartu  Sembako  program  facilitators,  supporting  the  formulation  of  Kartu  Pra  Kerja \nprogram, and strategizing on maintaining supplies of basic food and protective equipment.  \n \nADB is likewise supporting the Ministry of Health in fast tracking the procurement of critical \n31. \nmedical equipment and supplies under a $3 million grant approved on 20 March 2020 with funding \nfrom  the  Asia  Pacific  Disaster  Response  Fund. 34  In  addition  to  being  responsive  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s immediate financial needs in an emergency situation, ADB\u2019s response package, \nstarting with the proposed CARES program, is instrumental in catalyzing cofinancing from other \ndevelopment partners. Finally, a bespoke coordination and monitoring framework, agreed upon \nbetween the government and ADB, will support effective implementation of the CARES program \nand establish regional  synergies with  similar countercyclical  support  provided by  ADB  in  other \ndeveloping member countries (para. 35). \n \n32. \nIn the area of structural reform, ADB is supporting several dimensions of the government\u2019s \ninvestment and competitiveness reform agenda. This includes supporting measures to simplify \nand expedite business licensing, improving linkages of Indonesian firms, particularly MSMEs, with \nglobal  value  chains,  and  developing  labor  regulations  that  balance  competitiveness  objectives \nwith  skills  development  and  social  protection  for  Indonesian  workers.  To  promote  inclusive \ngrowth, ADB is supporting financial inclusion through reforms, service upgrades, innovations to \nenhance  access  and  digital  literacy.  Finally,  ADB  is  also  processing  a  new  regional  technical \nassistance to assess the efficacy of the stimulus packages as well as draft medium-term recovery \nand  transformational  strategies for  the  post-COVID-19  era  for  selected  countries  in  Southeast \nAsia,  including  Indonesia.  This  technical  assistance  will  also  be  utilized  for  supporting  the \nimplementation of the CARES Program (para. 35).  \n \nC. \n \nDue to the adverse impact of COVID-19, the government\u2019s financing needs are projected \n33. \nto increase by $39.8 billion in 2020 (from $42.4 billion to $82.2 billion). The government plans to \nmeet  the  additional  financing  requirement  through  domestic  ($28.9  billion)  and  foreign  ($10.9 \nbillion) sources (Table 6).  \n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs, Budget Support and Debt Sustainability \n\n34 https://www.adb.org/news/adb-approves-3-million-grant-support-indonesias-fight-against-covid-19. \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nItem \n\nTable 6: Urgent Financing Needs and Support for 2020 \n($ billion) \n\nchange \n(%) \n\n2020 \n(before  \nCOVID-19) \n42.4 \n33.0 \n9.4 \n6.6 \n \n\n2020 \n(adjusted for  \nCOVID-19) \n82.2 \n61.9 \n20.3 \n12.4 \n1.5 \n \n 1.0 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n1.5b \n2.8 \n1.1 \n\nGross financing requirement \nGross domestic financing \nGross foreign financing \nBond issuance \nADB COVID-19 response \nCARES program (CPRO) \nADB originally programmed support \nPromoting Innovative Financial Inclusion Program, SP1 \nCompetitiveness, Industrialization and Trade Acceleration Program, SP 1 \nContingent Disaster Financinga  \nWorld Bank \nOther Development Partners (AIIB, AfD, JICA, KfW) \nOther Development Partners (TBD) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank; AfD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement; AIIB = Asian Infrastructure Investment \nBank; CARES = COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; CPRO = \nCOVID-19  Pandemic  Response  Option;  JICA  =  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency;  KfW  =  Kreditanstalt  fuer \nWiederaufbau; TBD = to be determined.  \na  The Contingent Disaster Financing, programmed for 2020, is reflected for transparency, but is not included in the \n\n \n 1.0 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n0.4 \n1.4 \n \n\n94 \n87 \n116 \n \n \n\ntotal for ADB originally programmed support, as it may not be drawn upon given its contingent nature.  \n\nb  Includes Program-for-Results Financing. \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculations \n \n34. \nThe government has requested two loans, comprised of, (i) a regular loan of \u20ac462,920,000 \n($500 million equivalent), and (ii) a regular loan of \u20ac925,840,000 ($1 billion equivalent), both from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to provide countercyclical budgetary support for the economic \nrecovery and much-needed public health programs.35 The first euro-denominated loan will have \na  10-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  For  the  first  euro-denominated  loan,  based  on  the  straight-line  method,  the \naverage maturity is 6.75 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The second \neuro-denominated loan will have a 5-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment \ncharge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement.  For  the  second  euro-denominated  loan,  based  on  the  straight-line  method,  the \naverage maturity is 4.25 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The total size \nof the loans is based on Indonesia\u2019s financing needs, and development spending arising from the \ndevelopment expenditure programs. The loans are expected to be disbursed in April 2020.  \n \nDebt sustainability. In July 2019, IMF assessed Indonesia external and public debt to be \n35. \nmoderate and sustainable.36 The ratio of central government debt to GDP is expected to increase \nfrom 29.8% in 2019 to 37.8% in 2020 and decline to 37.1% in 2021 under a baseline scenario of \nthe rupiah depreciating by 19.5% and GDP growth declining to 2.3% in 2020 due to COVID-19. \nThe  projection  of  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio  for  2020  indicates  that  the  central  government\u2019s  debt \nwould be sustainable if assumptions were to be realized. With the proposed CARES program of \n$1.5 billion equivalent, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by 0.2% (from 37.8% to 38.0% in \n2020).37 The existing debt ratio and projected public indebtedness, including the potential impact \n\n35 Euro 0.92584 = $1.00 as of 9 April 2020. \n36 IMF. 2019.

The  medium-term \noutlook is acceptable in terms of creditworthiness. \n \nD. \n \n36. \nADB coordinates its COVID-19 response support closely with other development partners, \nunder the overall lead of the government. As for the public health policy response, WHO is the \ntechnical  lead  partner  and  has  provided  the  Strategic  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan  for \nCOVID-19, which has been applied by the government in forming its own plan. It also helps to \ncoordinate  among  United  Nations  agencies,  with  non-governmental  organizations,  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  working  on  COVID-19.  Other  development  partners  involved  in  public \nhealth include the Government of Australia, United Nations agencies, United States Agency for \nInternational  Development,  and  the  World  Bank,  among  others.  ADB  works  closely  with  the \nMinistry of Health and Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency, and in collaboration with \nWHO and UNICEF, on the procurement of critical medical equipment and supplies. For economic \nand fiscal support, ADB has been coordinating with the IMF in assessing the economic impact of \nCOVID-19,  helping  the  government  develop  effective  stimulus  programs,  and  designing  the \nproposed CARES program for which the IMF has provided an assessment letter.38 At the request \nof  the  government,  the  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank  (AIIB)  and German  development \nassistance through KfW have both indicated their intentions to provide cofinancing for the CARES \nprogram. KfW has proposed parallel cofinancing of \u20ac250 million and the loan size for AIIB is yet \nto be determined. Both AIIB and KfW will disburse their cofinancing directly to the government.39  \n \nE. \n \n37. \nThe Fiscal Policy Agency of the MOF will be the executing agency for the program. To \nsupport  effective  implementation  of  the  program,  a  country  engagement  framework  has  been \nestablished between  ADB  and  the  government. The  framework  focuses on  (i)  policy  dialogue,  \n(ii) monitoring, and (iii) reporting of the government\u2019s countercyclical strategy and measures. The \nframework will also be used to identify gaps and analysis required that will enable ADB to channel \nsupport including through technical assistances. For instance, the regional technical assistance \nthat is being processed can provide inputs on the efficacy of government\u2019s measures as well as \nrecovery strategies. The framework includes a policy committee to guide and monitor the overall \nimplementation  of  the  countercyclical  measures.  The  policy  committee  will  be  supported  by  a \ntechnical  committee  which  will  provide  inputs  including  monitoring  of  the  government\u2019s  overall \nresponse  measures  and  the  gender  monitoring  matrix.  Three  sub-committees  will  facilitate \nengagement with the private sector, civil society organizations, and entities that focus on big data \nanalytics  to  drive  innovative  solutions  based  on  the  latest  available  data. 40  Government \nrepresentatives on the (sub)committees will include officials from the MOF and other ministries \nas appropriate. The frequency of the meetings will be at least once every quarter. The program \nimplementation period is April 2020\u2013March 2021. The proceeds of the loans will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n38 IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40 Country Engagement Framework for COVID-19 Response to Indonesia (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2).  \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n38.  Governance.  In  2017,  Indonesia  scored  either  A  or  B  (both  considered  above  basic \nalignment with international good practice) on 17 of 31 indicators in the World Bank\u2019s PEFA report. \nIndicators with particularly good assessment results include transparency of public finance, and \naccounting  and  reporting.  Government  regulations  issued  in  2017  strengthened  the  legal  and \nregulatory  frameworks  for  PFM,  mandating  coordination  between  the  National  Development \nPlanning  Agency  and  the  MOF  in  planning,  budgeting,  and  subsequent  regulations.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment. \n \n39. \nPoverty and inequality. As millions of wage and non-wage workers are on the verge of \nlosing  jobs  because  of  business  disruptions  and  the  sudden  stop  in  economic  activity,  the \nproposed  CARES  program  is  crucial  to  uphold  the  declining  trends  of  poverty  and  inequality. \nPoverty in Indonesia consistently declined from a peak of 24.2% in 1999 to 9.2% in September \n2019. Expenditure inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, was estimated at 0.31 in 1999 \nand rose to 0.41 in 2011, where it stayed until 2015, before gradually declining to 0.38 in 2019. \nThese improvements are linked with low inflation, the growing formal economy, the upscaling of \nsocial  assistance,  and  investment.  The  government\u2019s  stimulus  packages  supported  under  the \nproposed program will help mitigate COVID-19\u2019s impact with timely and effective health and social \nassistance  measures that shield  the  vulnerable population\u2014especially  women,  elderly  people, \nand those with disabilities\u2014against price and income shocks. Simulation results indicate that the \nexpected  rise  in  the  poverty  rate  by  up  to  3.0%  from  the  baseline  of  9.4%  could  be  mitigated \nthrough the provision of additional social assistance transfers by the government.  \n \n40. \nGender. The CARES program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming at entry. \nWhile the CARES program is for budget support, the focus of the support under the program is \nthe expansion of social assistance programs for the poor and vulnerable with clear linkages to \nwomen\u2019s welfare. First, the government proposes to increase the total beneficiaries of the PKH \nconditional cash transfer program from 9.2 million to 10 million, including households headed by \nwomen.  The  PKH  provides  conditional  cash  transfer  to  female  beneficiaries  in  the  identified \nrecipient households thereby ensuring that women have access to and control over family-related \nbudgetary  decision-making.41 This  is  in  line  with the  United  Nations\u2019  recommendation  for  cash \ntransfers to be targeted to women.42 The PKH also provide women with access to counselling, \nmaternal and child health programs, and economic empowerment training. Additional resources, \nincluding from the CARES program, will enable the government to increase the transfers by 25%, \nincluding for pregnant women from Rp2.4 million to Rp3 million per year. Second, the government \nproposes to increase the total beneficiaries of the Kartu Sembako program from 15.2 million to \n20  million  households,  representing  a  30%  cash  increase  from  Rp150,000  to  Rp200,000,  for  \n9 months. More than 90% of the Kartu Sembako program recipients are women, including 16% \nfemale-headed households. Third, the government proposes to provide 6-months of income tax \nrelief to manufacturing workers with annual incomes less than $14,000 and at least 75% of female \nmanufacturing  workers  will  qualify  for  the  relief.  Finally,  gender-responsive  budgeting  will  be \napplied to the monitoring and evaluation of these and other social assistance programs for poor \nand vulnerable households. To supplement the CARES program, a technical assistance from the \n\n \n\n41 Based on data from April 2020, 8,616,758 of 9,214,143 PKH households have women receiving transfers into their \nbank  accounts  which  equates  to  at  least  90%  of  beneficiaries  being  women  (based  on  number  of  bank  account \nholders). \n\n42 https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/put-women-and-girls-centre-efforts-recover-covid-19. \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fCOVID-19  TASF  Special  Pool  Resources  is  being  prepared  to  respond  to  the  gender-related \nimpacts of COVID-19 including support for domestic and/or gender-based violence. \n \n41. \nSafeguards. The program will not have any adverse social or environmental safeguard \nimpacts and will not trigger ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). It is classified category C \nfor environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \n42. \nin Table 7 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.43 \n \n\nRisks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \n\nTable 7: Substantial Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisk Description \n\nEscalation of the outbreak and its \nsocial impact:  \nA worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic \nglobally and across regions in \nIndonesia, including a rise in \nundetected cases, may undermine the \nimplementation of measures to fight the \npandemic. If business and consumer \nsentiments remain subdued, there is a \nrisk of potential second-round impacts, \nincluding bankruptcies and additional \nlayoffs, leaving the poor and vulnerable \nexposed because of gaps in the social \nprotection floor.  \nFinancial markets:  \nWorsening conditions in international \ncommodity and financial markets put \nfurther downward pressure on the \neconomy and government revenues.  \n\nCapacity gaps: \nInsufficient capacity of the implementing \nagencies may delay the implementation \nof the government's COVID-19 strategy. \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe Government of Indonesia  has announced two stimulus \npackages to address COVID-19 and its social impact, which \nwere accompanied  by measures from  Bank Indonesia. The \ngovernment provided an additional $1.8 billion to the Ministry \nof  Social  Affairs  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  to  fund  the \nresponse  to  COVID-19.  Key  government  measures  are: \n(i) temporarily  increasing  the  value  of  the  Kartu  Sembako \nfood assistance program; (ii) bringing forward by 1-month the \ndisbursement of the benefits and increasing value under the \nPKH  conditional  cash  transfer  program;  (iii) reimbursing \nexpenses from COVID-19 hospital utilization under the public \nhealth  insurance  scheme;  and  (iv)  increasing  incentives  for \nmedical workers. \n\nBank  Indonesia  lowered  its  policy  rate  by  25  bps  in  both \nFebruary and March, for a total of 50 bps, bringing it to 4.5%. \nIt also introduced liquidity-supporting measures, such as (i) a \n12-month  tenor  for  its  repo  liquidity  injection  facility;  (ii)  an \nincrease  in  the  frequency  of  foreign  exchange  swaps;  and, \nand (iii) a widening of the number of banks subject to the 50 \nbps local currency reserve requirement. To support exchange \nrate  stability,  minimize  speculation,  and  smooth  outflows, \nBank Indonesia strengthened interventions in the bond, spot, \nand domestic non-deliverable forward markets. The Financial \nServices  Authority  also  took  some  confidence-boosting \nmeasures  in  the  capital  market,  including  making  share \nbuybacks more flexible. \nADB  is  coordinating  closely  with  MOF  to  design  the  fiscal \nstimulus package and is providing capacity building technical \nassistance in several key areas, including social assistance \ntechnical \nand  human  capital  development.  Additional \nassistance  including  diagnostic  support  will  be  provided \nthrough  the  country  engagement  framework.  ADB  is  also \nprocessing a new regional technical assistance to assess the \nefficacy  of  the  stimulus  packages  as  well  as  draft  medium-\nterm  recovery  and  transformational  strategies  for  the  post-\nCOVID-19  era  for  selected  countries  in  Southeast  Asia, \nincluding Indonesia.  \n\nbps = basis points, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, MOF = Ministry of Finance, PKH = Family Hope Program. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n\n43 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n43. \nThe government has assured ADB that the implementation of the CARES Program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards,  gender  equality,  procurement,  financial  management,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the loan documents.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n44. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve:  \n \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  \u20ac462,920,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  COVID-19  Active \nResponse  and  Expenditure  Support  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n10 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n \nthe  loan  of  \u20ac925,840,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  COVID-19  Active \nResponse  and  Expenditure  Support  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n5 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board.  \n\n \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n16 April 2020 \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n19 \n\nRisks \n\nWorsening \nconditions in \ninternational \ncommodity and \nfinancial markets \nput further \ndownward \npressure on the \neconomy and \ngovernment \nrevenues. \n \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \nAdverse impacts of COVID-19 on health, livelihoods and economy mitigateda  \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n \n\nResults Chain \n\nEffect of the \nProgram \n \nCOVID-19 outbreak \nmore effectively \nmanaged and its \nsocial and economic \ndamages mitigated.1  \n\nOutputs \n1.

Adverse impact of \nexogenous shocks  \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\nIndonesia has experienced a severe decline in growth and fiscal stress as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. \nAs of 15 April 2020, Indonesia had 5,136 positive cases and 469 deaths (Figure 1). Three regions\u2014Jakarta, \nWest Java Bali, and Banten\u2014have been hit particularly hard. However, there is concern that these figures do \nnot show the complete picture due to large numbers of undetected cases arising from the low number of tests \ncarried  out.  Some  models  suggest  that  the  true  number  of  positive  cases  could  be  between  70,000  and \n250,000, and by the end of April 2020, the number could be as high as 1 million. \n \nWith the outbreak of COVID-19, Indonesia is experiencing sudden capital outflow due to change in global risk \nsentiment  resulting  in  investors  exiting  emerging  markets.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  net  foreign  outflow \nreached $10.5 billion, which included $9.6 billion in bond and $900 million in equity market. These reversals \nincreased  bond yields by nearly 200 basis points (Figure 3a) and the rupiah depreciated by approximately \n20% to Rp16,741\u2014to levels last seen during the Asian financial crisis in 1998. \n \nSimulation results using Indonesia\u2019s computable general equilibrium model (IndoTerm) indicate that a 1-month \nnational disruption could result in  a drop  in the output of hotels by 11.54% and  of restaurants by 7.86%  in \n2020. Transport, construction, food processing, and other manufacturing outputs would also suffer seriously. \nThe most severely affected regions of Banten, Jakarta, and Bali will see a sharp deviation from their baseline \ngrowth  in  2020.  The  government  projects  2020  to  produce  the  lowest  economic  growth  level  in  21  years \n(2.3%), down from an original estimate of 5.2%, with employment loss projected at as many as 7 million. It is \nestimated that the national poverty rate may increase from a baseline of 9.4% in March 2019 to 11.8%\u201312.8% \nin 2020. \n \nThe central government\u2019s revenue and grants in 2020 are projected to reduce to $101 billion from the pre- \nCOVID-19  projection  of  $128  billion,  with  further  downside  risk.  In  the  second  quarter  alone,  revenue  is \nexpected to reduce by 20% year-on-year. The fall in revenue is a result of general economic slowdown as well \nas tax reliefs provided as part of the fiscal measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Continued lower \ncommodity prices will affect export earnings. Public expenditure is projected to increase to $149 billion from \n$145 billion, in part because of  unplanned  expenditures related  to  COVID-19.  The fiscal  deficit for  2020  is \nexpected to increase to $51.7 billion (5.1% of GDP), and the gross financing needs are expected to increase \nfrom $52 billion to $87 billion. \nThe government has an effective pro-poor countercyclical expenditure program that will be supported by the \nCARES  program  under  the  COVID-19  Pandemic  Response  Option,  which  focus  on  social,  health,  and \neconomic  dimensions:  (i)  additional  allocation  of  social  assistance  programs  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable \nimplemented;  (ii)  dedicated  fund  for  COVID-19  prevention  and  control  established;  (iii)  productive  sectors \nsafeguarded and manufacturing workers supported from the economic downturn. About 20.2% of the package, \n$6.5 billion, will be in the form of social assistance programs for poor and vulnerable households. \n\n \n\n2. Counter cyclical \ndevelopment expenditures \n\n\fADB Staff Assessment \n\nThe government has unveiled three fiscal packages to fund substantially increased public health measures, \nsocial assistance to the poor and vulnerable, and support to businesses worth $32.4 billion. In health, a key \nchange is the inclusion of COVID-19 in the health insurance benefits package through increased allocations. \nCurrently, approximately 222 million people are enrolled in health insurance, of whom 131 million receive state \nsubsidies for premia. This ensures the poor in society are not impeded from accessing facilities due to cost \nconstraints. In addition to the increased allocation to the health sector, the government is providing additional \nsocial assistance to poor and vulnerable households during the COVID-19 pandemic through two key social \nassistance programs, the Family Hope Program (PKH), and Kartu Sembako.  \n \nWhile both programs are available for all poor and vulnerable groups (as defined through a registry held by \nthe  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs),  they  particularly  target  mothers  and  children.  Under  PKH,  women  are \nencouraged to utilize health facilities for prenatal -and antenatal care, and for children to attend school; further, \nwomen are usually the attendees of family development sessions on topics such as health, nutrition and early \nlearning. Under Kartu Sembako program, mothers are usually responsible for buying and cooking the food for \nthe household. In addition, electricity subsidies and housing incentives for the poor are included. These social \nassistance programs complement additional funds for social protection programs such as education subsidies, \nstrengthening  market  and  logistics  operations,  and  the  Kartu  Pra  Kerja  program.  The  government  also \nextended a tax holiday for manufacturing workers with an annual income of less than $14,000. It is supporting \nproductive sectors by lowering corporate taxes, suspending import taxes, and accelerating valued-added tax \nrestitution for 19 manufacturing subsectors for up to 6 months.  \n\n26 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAccess Criteria \n\n3. Pre-shock record of \ngenerally sound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\n4. Structural reforms \n\n5. Debt sustainability \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy expanded by 5.0% on average during 2015\u20132019. Inflation \nhas been carefully managed and was only 2.8% in 2019. The tax-to-GDP ratio averaged 10.2% over 2015-\n2019. The fiscal deficit averaged only 2.3% between 2015-2019.The quality of adjustment measures being \nplanned, is within a sound budgetary framework. There is strong coordination on macroeconomic management \nbetween  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Bank  Indonesia  and  the  Financial  Services  Authority  and  to  respond  to \nexternal uncertainties. The 2017 PEFA noted that Indonesia has a well-functioning PFM system. \n \nADB has supported reforms in PFM since 2002, aiming to set up a well-functioning national and subnational \npublic expenditure management (PEM) frameworks. ADB has provided technical assistance (TA) to improve \nthe fiscal sustainability of social security, strengthen the fiscal decentralization framework, and improve the \nfiscal  risk  management  of  contingent  liabilities  arising  from  accelerated  infrastructure  investment.  In \n2016\ua7f72019,  ADB  continued  to  engage  with  the  government  by  supporting  the  PEM  framework  and  fiscal \ntransfers to subnational governments for efficient service delivery. \n \nThe government is committed to achieving the SDGs. The government has mapped the SDGs targets against \ntargets in its National Medium-Term Development Strategy and established the national coordination team for \nSDGs implementation chaired by the President of Indonesia. The team monitors and provides annual reporting \non progress in achieving SDGs. The government also launched the SDG road map, which included a financing \nchapter for SDG implementation. The government\u2019s commitment to SDGs is reflected in its increased budget \nallocation for pro-poor expenditure. \nIndonesia is taking credible steps to address the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its economic impacts on \nthe population. It has created a COVID-19 task force led by the head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency \nand including representatives of the Ministry of Health, the Indonesian Military and the National Police. On 28 \nJanuary 2020, the government issued an emergency decree, allowing the utilization of state funds to address \nCOVID-19.  (The  decree  was  extended  on  29  February  2020,  prolonging  the  emergency  period  to  29  May \n2020.)  To  address  the  health  crisis,  the  government  has  prepared  an  Indonesian  Preparedness  Plan  for \nCOVID-19  following  advice  from  the  World  Health  Organization.  It  emphasizes  the  following:  clinical \nmanagement particularly of severe and critical cases; infection prevention and control among health workers \nand the general population; and specimen management and laboratory confirmation to help reduce the spread \nof the infection. \n \nThe government announced a $4.5 billion health response package. As presented in Table 4, besides support \nfor  the  health  sector,  the  government\u2019s  response  consists  of  3  packages  with  support  covering  social \nassistance, small business recovery program, and tax relief for manufacturing workers.  \nExternal debt. Indonesia\u2019s external debt in January 2020 amounted to $410.8 billion or 36.1% of GDP, a slight \ndecline from 36.2% a year earlier. Debt held by non-residents is predominantly long-term (88.3%), consisting \nof government and central bank\u2019s debt of $204.9 billion, and private debt (including state-owned enterprises) \nof $203 billion. In 2019 growth in the government\u2019s external debt was driven by an influx of foreign capital to \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess Criteria \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\nthe domestic government securities market and issuance of dual currency global bonds, namely in euros and \nUS  dollars.  External  debt  at  the  end  of  January  2020  grew  by  7.2%  year-on-year.  Due  to  the  COVID-19 \npandemic, external debt at the end of 2020 could climb to $483.7 billion (a jump of 16.3%) from $410.8 billion \nin January 2020. \n\n6. Coordination with \nInternational Monetary Fund. \n\nGovernment  debt.  Central  government  debt  increased  marginally  from  26.2%  of  GDP  to  29.8%  of  GDP \nbetween 2010\u20132019 as investment in public infrastructure accelerated. Additional borrowing under the CPRO \nhas minimal (0.2%) impact on debt\u2013GDP ratio.  \nADB  and  the  IMF  coordinate  closely  on  macroeconomic  monitoring,  including  in  assessing  the  impact  of \nCOVID-19  on  the  economy  and  government  finances.  The  government  is  in  contact  with  the  IMF  on  the \nongoing measures to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The last IMF Article IV assessment for Indonesia \nwas completed in July 2019, concluding that the Indonesian economy performed well in 2018, despite external \nheadwinds, and that the economic outlook was positive. ADB has been in close contact with the IMF in relation \nto the proposed CARES program, and the IMF has provided an assessment letter. ADB is also coordinating \nclosely,  and  exploring  cofinancing  opportunities,  with  other  development  partners  that  are  providing,  or \nconsidering providing budget support, such as the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment  Bank, German  development assistance through  KfW, Japan International Cooperation  Agency, \nIslamic Development Bank, the Republic of Korea, and the World Bank. \nCARES = COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support, COVID-19 = COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International \nMonetary Fund, KfW = Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau, PFM = public financial management. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 16 April 2020) \n \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n$0.000063 \nRp15,758 \nRp14,417 \n", "Currency unit \nRp1.00 \n$1.00 \n\u20ac1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n= \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nAsian Development Bank \nCOVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support \ncoronavirus disease \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \ndomestic non-deliverable forward (transaction) \ngross domestic product \nInternational Monetary Fund \nMinistry of Finance \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \nFinancial Services Authority \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability \nProgram Keluarga Harapan (Family Hope Program) \nSustainable Development Goal \nUnited States \nWorld Health Organization \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars. \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013_ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ADB \nCARES \nCOVID-19 \nCPRO \nDNDF \nGDP \nIMF \nMOF \nMSMEs \nOJK \nPEFA \nPKH \nSDG \nUS \nWHO \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General  Ramesh Subramaniam, Southeast Asia Department (SERD) \nDirectors \n", "Ahmed M.
