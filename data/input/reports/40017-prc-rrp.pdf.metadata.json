The Project will bring tangible benefits to \nthe environment of Jiaozhou City and the bay area by (i) reducing water \npollution; (ii) protecting water resources; (iii) reducing economic losses \nand  disruption  to  livelihoods  from  frequent  localized  flooding;  (iv) \nenhancing  wetland  ecosystems  in  both  Shaohai  Lake  and  the  Dagu \nEstuary/Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands;  (v)  promoting  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment;  (vi)  improving  the  environment,  living  conditions,  and \npublic  health  standards;  and  (vii)  strengthening  public  service  delivery \nthrough  corporatization  and  improved  financial  sustainability.  The \nimpact  of  the  Project  will  be  enhanced  by  the  replication  of  project \nlessons  learned  in  other  newly  developed  zones  within  the  Qingdao \nmunicipal  government  (QMG)  by  the  implementation  of  a  strategic \nenvironmental assessment (SEA).   \n \nThe  Project  has  three  key  outputs:  (i)  improved  water  resources  and \nflood  management, \n(a)  dredging,  embankment,  and \nrehabilitation of four river courses with a total length of 19.5 kilometers \n(km); (b) upgrading flood retention facilities; and (c) constructing about \n11.4  km  of  storm  sewers;  (ii)  strengthening  wastewater  management \nand  pollution  control,  including  (a)  constructing  about  15.9  km  of \ninterceptor  sewers,  (b)  establishing  about  11.8  km  of  additional \nsewerage networks to supplement the existing trunk sewerage, and (c) \nsupporting  the  establishment  of  a  wastewater  treatment  plant  with \nprivate  sector  involvement  for  an  additional  50,000  cubic  meters  per \nday;  and  (iii)  integrated  water  and  ecosystem  management.  The \nintegrated information system for Jiaozhou flood, water, and wastewater \nmanagement  and  the  related  emergency  response  system  will  be \nestablished.  Management  of  the  downstream  Shaohai  Lake  will  be \n\nincluding \n\n\fii \n\n \nRationale \n\nstrengthened  by  (i)  improving  biodiversity  monitoring  capacities;  (ii) \nestablishing  surface  water  flow,  water  quality,  and  other  ecosystem \nparameters;  and  (iii)  establishing  a  hydraulic  and  water  quality \nsimulation  tool.  The  goal  of  protecting  environmental  conditions  in \nJiaozhou  Bay  and  preserving  wetland  areas  will  be  reinforced  by \nstrengthening  both  Qingdao\u2019s  and  Jiaozhou\u2019s  integrated  planning \ncapabilities through preparation of an SEA aimed at providing guidance \nfor environmental management in Qingdao Municipality.   \n \nMost  of  the  water  management  problems  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC), particularly in coastal cities, are the result of a fragmented \napproach  to  development.  There  is  a  need  to  move  towards  a  more \ntasks \nintegrated  management  approach  whereby \nthe  different \nassociated  with  water  management \n(water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement, and drainage) and ecosystem rehabilitation are managed \ntogether in close coordination with land-use planning, coastal zone and \nwater  resource  management,  and  pollution  control  at  the  river  basin \nlevel.  To  reduce  pollution  in  the  country\u2019s  coastal  waters  and  sustain \necosystems,  a  number  of  specific  actions  are  needed,  including  (i) \nadopting  a  holistic  approach  to  water  management  in  river  basins  and \ncoastal  zones;  (ii)  reducing  land-based  pollution  sources,  particularly \nfrom  industrial  and  urban  sources;  and  (iii)  continuing  institutional  and \nfinancial  management  reforms  to  facilitate  sustainable  environment \nmanagement.   \n \nThe  coastal  wetlands  of  Jiaozhou  Bay  surrounded  by  Qingdao \nMunicipality  (including  Jiaozhou  City  at  the  head  of  the  bay)  are  vital; \nthey  represent  the  most  important  marine  ecosystem  of  the  Qingdao \ncoastal  region  and  the  Shandong  Peninsula.  They  provide  breeding \ngrounds  for  many  types  of  fish  and  shellfish,  a  resting  place  for \nmigratory  birds,  and  a  habitat  for  other  coastal  biological  diversity.  In \naddition,  they  play  a  key  role  in  absorbing  excessive  nutrients  from \nland-based  activities  before  the  nutrients  enter  the  waters  of  the  bay \nproper, thereby helping to prevent eutrophication in the bay. Finally, the \nwetlands  play  a  key  role  in  flood  management  and  coastal  protection, \nwhich  will  be  increasingly  significant  to  coastal  cities  as  sea  levels \ncontinue  to  rise  as  a  result  of  global  warming.  Since  the  1950s,  the \ncoastal wetlands around Jiaozhou Bay have been severely impacted by \nhuman  activities,  notably  in  relation  to  excessive  pollution.  It  is \nestimated  that  since  1950,  the  wetland  area  has  shrunk  by  30%. \nMoreover, the area of natural wetlands has decreased, with the area of \nartificial  wetlands,  such  as  salt  and  aquaculture  ponds,  doubling. \nEffective  upstream  environmental  and  water  resources  management \n(i.e.,  reducing  pollution  loads,  preserving  river  regimes,  and  effective \ncoastal  zone  management)  is  required  to  reduce  further  wetlands  loss \nand  degradation,  and  thereby  ensure  the  preservation  of  the  Jiaozhou \nBay environment.  \n \nJiaozhou  City  is  one  of the  county-level  cities  under  the  administration \nof  Qingdao  municipality  on  the  northwest  coast  of  Jiaozhou  Bay.  In \n2007,  the  city  had  a  total  area  of  1,210  square  kilometers  and  a \n\n\fpopulation  of  891,800.  The  population  is  estimated  to  be  increasing  at \nan average annual rate of 1.12%. Economic growth in the project area \nhas  averaged  about  20%  per  annum  in  real  terms  since  2004  (well \nabove  the  national  average)  and  this  rapid  growth  is  expected  to \ncontinue  in  the  intermediate  term.  Immediate  impacts  of  this  rapid \ndevelopment  have  included  (i)  an  increase in  the  incidence  of  flooding \nin  the  expanding  urban  areas,  (ii)  a  high  rate  of  waterborne  disease, \nand  (iii)  increasing  environmental  damage  in  Jiaozhou  Bay.  While \nflooding was relatively rare in the 1990s, it has subsequently increased \nto about once in every 3 years, with average damage valued in excess \nof  CNY200  million  per  flood.  As  the  economy  continues  to  develop \nrapidly,  the  extent  and  value  of  this  damage  is  expected  to  further \nincrease.  The  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  particularly  stomach-\nrelated  diseases,  is  estimated  to  be  well  above  the  national  average \nand  is  expected  to  increase  in  the  future  if  attention  is  not  paid  to \nwastewater collection and treatment and increased public awareness of \npersonal hygiene. In addition, the extent and quality of the wetlands in \nJiaozhou  Bay  has  seriously  deteriorated  over  recent  years  and  the \nannual  rate  of  loss  is  currently  estimated  at  about  0.9%.  All  of  these \nfactors  are  having  a  serious  impact  on  continued  local  development, \nand together contribute to a strong demand for remedial action.   \n  \nWhile  Jiaozhou  City  has  implemented  various  water  conservation  and \nmanagement  projects,  including  notably  the  development  of  Shaohai \nLake (serving both as a flood retention zone and artificial wetland at the \nconfluence  with  the  Dagu  River)  and  the  first  phase  of  the  centralized \nwastewater treatment facilities, there are still significant opportunities to \nimprove environmental management in relation to (i) the collection and \ninterception  of  industrial  and  domestic  wastewater  discharge  directly \ninto  water  courses;  (ii)  the  expansion  and  enhancement  of  the \ncentralized  treatment  facilities  to  protect  the  Dagu  River/Jiaozhou  Bay \nwetlands;  (iii)  the  improvement  of  urban  rivers  and  storm-water \nnetworks  in  the  old  urban  area;  (iv)  the  development  of  an  integrated \napproach  to  flood  management,  incorporating  the  different  structural \nand  nonstructural  measures  currently  operated  separately  by  different \nentities;  and \nfinancial \ninstitutional  and \nsustainable  environmental \nfacilitate \nmanagement \nmanagement. The initial results and lessons learned from these efforts \nto  improve  environmental  management  will  be  a  good  model  for  other \ncounty governments in the PRC. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  Project  will  be  improved  quality  of  life,  a \nsustainable ecosystem, and biodiversity conservation in Jiaozhou Bay. \n \nThe project outcome will be improved condition of water resources and \nthe environment in Jiaozhou City and the downstream wetlands. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $105.8  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.1 million.  \n \nA loan of $45.0 million from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian \n\nthe  continuation  of \n\n(v) \nreforms \n\nto \n\niii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility.

The project leading group will provide overall \npolicy  guidance,  facilitate  interagency  coordination,  and  resolve  any \nimplementation.  A  project \ninstitutional  problems  affecting  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  has  been  established,  comprising  10  staff \nfrom  Jiaozhou  City  Construction  Bureau,  which  includes  the  project \nmanager  and  staff  for  undertaking  activities  related  to  procurement, \ndisbursement,  engineering,  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  and \ninterpreting.     \n \nAll procurement of goods and works shall be carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  Contracts  for  goods  estimated  to  exceed  $1.0  million  and \ncontracts for works estimated to exceed $10.0 million shall be procured \n\n \nProcurement \n\n\fusing international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods \nand works estimated to be equal to or less than the above international \ncompetitive  bidding  values  but  more  than  $100,000  shall  be  procured \nthrough national competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the \nPRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999),  subject  to  modifications \nagreed  upon  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to \ncost  $100,000  or  less  shall  be  procured  using  shopping  procedures. \nThe  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and \ncontracts. \n \n\n \nConsulting Services  About  31  person-months  of  international  and  100  person-months  of \nnational  consulting  services,  to  be  funded  under  the  Project,  will  be \nrequired  for  project  management  support  and  implementation  of \nnonstructural  measures.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  in  the \nfollowing  specific  areas:  (i)  development  of  an  integrated  information \nsystem  for  management  of  drainage  and  wastewater  assets  in \nJiaozhou,  (ii)  ecological  upgrading  of  the  Shaohai  Lake  wetlands,  (iii) \nconstruction  supervision  and  quality  control,  (iv)  financial  management \nand  corporate  governance,  and  (v)  operation  and  maintenance \nimprovements.  The  international  consultants  will  also  provide  training \nand  capacity  building  in  wastewater  management  and  treatment \nplanning, industrial pollution control, hydrological and hydraulic analysis, \nstorm-water  source  control,  financial  management,  and  environmental \nfor  consulting  services \nmonitoring  and  management.  Contracts \nestimated  at  $200,000  and  above  will  be  awarded  to  consulting  firms \nusing  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  (80:20),  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time).  \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  about  370,000  people  living  in  the \nproject area, of whom about 1.5% are poor, and indirectly benefit about \n3 million people in the Jiaozhou Bay area. All residents in Jiaozhou City \nwill  benefit,  as  their  living  conditions  will  improve  as  a  result  of  (i) \nreduced  pollution  of  Jiaozhou  Bay\u2019s  surface  water,  with  water  quality \nimproving  to  at  least  class  V  by  2014,  with  longer-term  potential  to  be \nupgraded  to  class  IV;  (ii)  protection  from  flooding  and  elimination  of \nhazards  resulting  from  poor  drainage;  and  (iii)  40%  reduction  in  the \nincidence  of  waterborne  diseases \nlevels,  with  a \ncorresponding  decline  in  the  number  of  sick  days  and  expenses  for \nmedical treatment. Residents in the broader Jiaozhou Bay area will also \nbenefit  from  (i)  reduced  pollution  of  Jiaozhou  Bay,  improved  amenity \nvalues,  reduced  health  risks  from  the  consumption  of  shellfish  and \nreduced  algal  growths  in  the  bay  and  surrounding  areas;  and  (ii) \nraising  of  environmental \nimproved  urban  planning \nsustainability at the early stages of project conception.   \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nfrom  2008 \n\nthrough \n\nthe \n\nThe Project will create about 3,400 full-time jobs during construction, of \nwhich  about  75%  will  be  for  the  unemployed.

The  Project  will  generate  direct  economic  benefits  from \nimproved \nimproved  health,  and \nreductions  in  the  extent  of  environmental  degradation  in  the  coastal \nwetlands  from  both  the  structural  and  nonstructural  investments.  For \nflood  management,  the  annualized  economic  benefit  in  constant  2008 \nvalues is estimated at CNY90.8 million in 2011, increasing to CNY120.1 \nmillion in 2021; health benefits are expected to increase from CNY0.75 \nmillion in 2010 to CNY12.35 million in 2033; finally, the value of wetland \nbenefits  was  projected  to  increase  from  CNY0.04  million  (from  1.1 \nhectare [ha] saved) in 2011 to CNY6.97 million (from 196.1 ha saved) in \n2033. The overall project economic internal rate of return is 14.7%. The \nproject design is technically sound, economically efficient, affordable to \nbeneficiaries, and financially and economically viable. \n\nto \n\ntimely  extensions  and  enhancement \n\nPotential  risks  to  the  Project  include  (i)  failure  of  the  Government  to \nimplement \nthe  Jiaozhou \nwastewater treatment plant (WWTP), (ii) insufficient capacity to ensure \nthe proper operation and maintenance of project facilities, (iii) ineffective \norganizational  structures  and  inadequate  capacity  of  the  PMO,  (iv) \ndelays  in  the  provision  of  counterpart  funding,  (v)  failure  of  JCG  to \nincrease wastewater tariffs to meet cost recovery targets, and (vi) delay \nin  implementation  of  the  proposed  SEA.  These  risks  have  been \nmitigated  by  (i)  obtaining  assurances  from  the  JCG  on  the  timely \nimplementation of the WWTP; (ii) capacity building for the PMO through \nthe  Project;  (iii)  assurances  from  JCG  on  the  provision  of  counterpart \nfunding, and regular tariff reviews and increases; and (iv) provision of a \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant by ADB to the Government.  \n \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Standard \nengineering  designs  will  be  adopted  for  flood  control  and  wastewater \nmanagement.  During  project  implementation,  consultants  will  help \nundertake proper survey and design prior to construction.   \n \nAn  advisory  TA  grant  of  $750,000  is  requested  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity of QMG in strategic environmental planning and management \nto  support  SEA  on  Jiaozhou  Bay  development.  QMG  will  provide \n$250,000  for  in-kind  costs.  The  TA  will  address  three  priority  issues \nidentified  by \nthe \nimplementation  of  integrated  water  and  environmental  management \nscheme:  (i) \nintegrated  planning  and  analysis,  (ii)  an  effective \nmanagement  scheme,  and  (iii)  an  appropriate  mechanism  to  monitor \nand ensure the effective implementation. \n \nThe proposed TA includes three components: (i) supporting the creation \nof an effective management mechanism for strategic environmental and \nplanning  process,  (ii)  SEA  of  further  development  of  Jiaozhou  Bay  for \nintegrated  planning,  and  (iii)  operational  guidelines  and  a  monitoring \nsystem for implementation.  \n\nthe  sector  analysis  and \n\nlessons \n\nlearned \n\nin \n\n\f \n\n \n\nMap 1 \n\n   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Qingdao  Water  Resources  and  Wetland \nProtection Project.1 The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Enabling \nthe  Protection  of  Jiaozhou  Bay  Water  Quality  and  Wetland  Ecosystem,  and  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will \napprove the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nA. \n \n2. \nSince  the  opening  up  of  the  PRC  in  1978,  spearheaded  by  the  coastal  provinces,  the \nPRC  has  achieved  unprecedented  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  rates.  Over  this \nperiod, the rate of urbanization has increased from 17.9% in 1978 to 36% in 2000, and 40.5% in \n2005. Thus, the urban population has tripled over a period of 25 years, reaching a total of about \n500 million city dwellers by 2005. By 2030, the urban population is expected to reach about 870 \nmillion, representing around 60% of the total population. The increasing urban population is (i) \nfuelling  further  industrialization,  economic  development,  and  intensification  of  agriculture;  (ii) \nstraining the already overloaded infrastructure; and (iii) contributing to widespread pollution and \nenvironmental  threats  to  the  PRC\u2019s  rivers,  lakes,  and  coastal  waters.  Urbanization  pressures \nare particularly intense in the PRC\u2019s coastal provinces; various activities (settlements, ports, and \nindustrial facilities) are increasingly competing for land in the narrow coastal zones. Increasing \npollution loads, more frequent floods, and droughts (exacerbated by climate change and rising \nsea  levels)  impose  threats  to  sustainable  water  resources  management  in  these  coastal \nregions. A review of the sector is in Appendix 2.   \n \nCombined  with  the  declining  availability  of  base  flows,  the  river  courses,  streams,  and \n3. \nlakes have seen a progressive increase in the quantity of wastewater discharged into them. The \ntotal volume of wastewater discharged in the PRC has been increasing since 1991, with about \n54  billion  tons  of  wastewater  discharged  in  2006.  The  combined  effects  of  overuse  of  water, \nwater pollution, and water-related developments are destroying aquatic ecosystems in the PRC. \nHowever, due to a lack of regular and systematic monitoring, it is difficult to quantify the effects. \nThe  most  vulnerable  among  these  aquatic  systems  are  lakes  and  wetlands  because  of  their \nlower assimilative capacity and vulnerability due to the adverse effects of sudden changes. \n \n4. \nThe Government\u2019s plans to address water pollution have not kept pace with the rate of \neconomic  growth.  During  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP,  2001\u20132005),  environmental  protection \nwas the only area of the plan that failed to fully achieve its targets, and as a result, eight of the \n20  environmental  targets  remained  unattained.  In  particular,  emissions  of  chemical  oxygen \ndemand  showed  only  a  2%  decrease,  compared  with  the  planned  10%  reduction.  Treated \nsewage short of the envisaged target of 45% by about 8%. Only about 60% of the targets for \npollution  control  for  the  major  rivers  and  lakes  were  accomplished;  about  41%  of  the  water  in \nthe  seven  major  river  basins  do  not  meet  the  class  III  national  water  quality  standard  and \nthereby is unacceptable as a source of drinking water. Marine ecosystems are also increasingly \nunder  stress,  with  significant  rises  in  the  number  of  harmful  algal  blooms  over  the  last  few \ndecades; during the 10th FYP period, the number of harmful algal blooms increased to over 100 \nevents per year in coastal waters, from around 20 in previous years. The recent occurrence of \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Qingdao Water Resources \n\nManagement Project. Manila.  \n\n\f 2 \n\nto \n\nthe \n\nissue.  Several \n\nfactors  contributed \n\nan  algal  bloom  prior  to  the  staging  of  the  sailing  regatta  as  part  of  the  29th  Olympiad  has \nsignificantly  raised  awareness  of \nthe  poor \nenvironmental  performance  during  the  10th  FYP,  the  most  significant  being  (i)  inadequate \nattention of local governments to environmental protection, (ii) high economic growth and rapid \nurbanization with low resource-use efficiency, (iii) weak regulatory supervision and enforcement, \n(iv)  weak  cross-sectoral  and  transboundary  coordination,  and  (v)  ineffective  financing \nmechanisms.  \n \nAs  part  of  the  11th  FYP  (2006\u20132010),  the  Government  has  given  priority  to  several \n5. \nenvironmental  and  natural  resource  concerns,  which  include  (i)  land  degradation,  (ii)  water \nshortage and pollution, (iii) poor urban environmental infrastructure, (iv) degradation of marine \necosystems  and  wetlands,  (v)  increasing  frequency  and  intensity  of  environmental  accidents, \nand  (vi)  global  environmental  issues  such  as  climate  change  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions. \nThe  Government  issued  a  series  of  policy  directives  on  environmental  protection  for  the  11th \nFYP  period.  These  policy  directions  are  incorporated  into  the  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment  Master  Plan  of  March  2006.  This  plan  gives  priority  to  (i)  protecting  and \nrehabilitating valued ecosystems, (ii) increasing efforts in pollution control, (iii) improving natural \nresources  management,  and  (iv)  sustainably  utilizing  marine/water  resources.  As  a  guiding \npolicy for the 11th FYP, the State Council directive sets forth two broad environmental objectives \nfor  the  next  5\u201315  years.  By  2010,  the  environmental  quality  of  key  regions  and  cities  will  be \nimproved, and the trend of ecological degradation will be arrested. By 2020, the quality of the \nenvironment  and  the  state  of  the  country\u2019s  ecosystems  will  have  improved  significantly.  There \nare many other specific targets set under the 11th FYP, but the reduction in energy intensity by \n20% and total pollution load by 10% are the two most prominent. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nMost of the water management problems in the PRC, particularly for the coastal cities, \nare  the  result  of  a  fragmented  approach  to  development.  There  is  a  need  to  move  towards  a \nmore  integrated  management  approach  whereby  the  different  responsibilities  associated  with \nwater  management  (water  supply,  wastewater  management,  and  drainage)  and  ecosystem \nrehabilitation are managed together in close coordination with land-use planning, coastal zone \nmanagement and water resource management, and pollution control at the river basin level. To \nreduce  pollution  in  the  country\u2019s  coastal  waters and  sustain  ecosystems,  a  number  of  specific \nactions  are  needed,  including  (i)  adopting  a  holistic  approach  to  water  management  in  river \nbasins and coastal zones; (ii) reducing land-based pollution sources, particularly industrial and \nurban  sources;  and  (iii)  continuing  institutional  and  financial  management  reforms  to  facilitate \nsustainable environment management.   \n \n7. \nThe  coastal  wetlands  of  Jiaozhou  Bay,  surrounded  by  the  Qingdao  Municipality \n(including the city of Jiaozhou situated at the head of the bay), are vital, as they are the most \nimportant marine ecosystem of the Qingdao coastal region and the Shandong Peninsula. They \nprovide breeding grounds for many types of fish and shellfish, a resting place for migratory birds, \nas well as maintaining coastal biological diversity. In addition, they play a key role in absorbing \nexcessive nutrients from land-based activities, before the nutrients enter the waters of the bay \nproper,  thereby  helping  to  prevent  eutrophication  in  the  bay.  The  wetlands  are  also  a  key  to \nflood management and coastal protection, which will become increasingly significant to coastal \ncities as sea levels continue to rise as a result of global warming. Since the 1950s, the coastal \nwetlands  around  Jiaozhou  Bay  have  been  severely  affected  by  human  activities,  notably  in \nrelation to excessive pollution generation. It is estimated that since the 1950s, the wetland area \nhas shrunk by 30%. As a result, the area of natural wetlands has decreased, while the artificial \nwetlands, such as salt and aquaculture ponds, have doubled in area. Whereas the water quality \n\n\fconditions appear not to be eutrophic in the bay (with generally high levels of oxygen and low \nlevels  of  biomass),  the  frequency  of  algal  blooms  has  been  increasing  and  nutrient  levels  are \nconsidered to be sufficiently high to favor eutrophication should wetlands continue to degrade. \nThese  observations  indicate  that  effective  upstream  environmental  and  water  resources \nmanagement  (reducing  pollution  loads  and  preserving  river  regimes)  together  with  effective \ncoastal zone management zoning is required to reduce further wetlands loss and degradation, \nand thereby ensure the preservation of the Jiaozhou Bay environment.   \n \nJiaozhou  City,  one  of  the  county-level  cities  under  the  administration  of  Qingdao \n8. \nMunicipality,  is  on  the  northwest  coast  of  Jiaozhou  Bay.  In  2007,  the  city  had  a  total  area  of \n1,210  square  kilometers  and  a  population  of  891,800.  The  population  is  estimated  to  be \nincreasing  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  1.12%.  Economic  growth  in  the  project  area  has \naveraged  about  20%  per  annum  in  real  terms  over  the  since  2004,  which  is  well  above  the \nnational  average,  and  this  rapid  growth  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  intermediate  term. \nImmediate impacts of this rapid development have included (i) an increase in the incidence of \nflooding in the expanding urban areas, (ii) a high rate of waterborne disease incidence, and (iii) \nincreasing  environmental  damage  to  Jiaozhou  Bay.  While  flooding  was  relatively  rare  in  the \n1990s, the incidence has subsequently increased to about once in every 3 years, with average \ndamage  valued  in  excess  of  CNY200  million  per  flood.  As  the  economy  continues  to  develop \nrapidly,  the  extent  and  value  of  this  damage  is  expected  to  further  increase.  The  incidence  of \nwaterborne  diseases,  particularly  stomach-related  diseases,  is  estimated  to  be  well  above  the \nnational  average  and  is  expected  to  increase  in  the  future.  Its  attention  is  not  given  to \nwastewater  collection  and  treatment  and  increased  public  awareness  of  personal  hygiene.  In \naddition, the extent and quality of the wetlands in Jiaozhou Bay has seriously deteriorated over \nrecent years and the annual rate of loss is currently estimated at about 0.9%. All of these factors \nare having a serious impact on continued local development and together contribute to a strong \ndemand for remedial action. A problem tree analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \nIn  the  past,  too  many  water  conservation  programs  in  the  PRC  have  failed  due  to  the \n9. \ninability of county governments to raise adequate counterpart funds, or have been distorted due \nto the need to focus on activities that create short- and medium-term revenues. There is a need \nfor  international  financing  institutions  to  fund  those  areas  not  supported  by  private  funding \nsources.  The  wastewater  treatment  system  is  a  good  example  where  the  establishment  of \nsewerage  networks  is  not  attractive  to  private  funding  sources  and  is  underfinanced  by  local \ngovernments. \n\n \n\n10.  While  Jiaozhou  City  has  implemented  various  water  conservation  and  management \nprojects, including notably the development of Shaohai Lake (serving both as a flood retention \nzone  and  artificial  wetland  at  the  confluence  with  the  Dagu  River)  and  the  first  phase  of  the \ncentralized  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  there  are  still  significant  opportunities  to  improve \nenvironmental  management  in  relation  to  (i)  the  collection  and  interception  of  industrial  and \ndomestic wastewater discharge directly into water courses, (ii) the expansion and enhancement \nof the centralized treatment facilities to protect the Dagu River and Jiaozhou Bay wetlands, (iii) \nimprovement of rivers and storm-water networks in the old urban area, (iv) the development of \nan  integrated  approach  to  flood  management  incorporating  the  different  structural  and \nnonstructural  measures  currently  operated  separately  by  different  entities,  and  (v)  continuing \nfacilitate  sustainable  environmental \ninstitutional  and \nmanagement.  The \nimprove \nlessons \nenvironmental management will be a good model for other county governments in the PRC.  \n  \n\nfinancial  management  reforms \n\ninitial  results  and \n\nthese  efforts \n\nlearned \n\nfrom \n\nto \n\nto \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nThe Qingdao municipal government (QMG) and the Jiaozhou city government (JCG) are \n11. \nrequesting  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  assistance  to  reduce  flooding  and  pollution \nimpacts,  and  improve  environmental  management  upstream  from  the  Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands. \nThis Project will serve as demonstration for further development of other districts around the bay \narea.  This  is  particularly  consistent  with  QMG\u2019s  master  plan  for  Jiaozhou  Bay,  which  aims  for \nbalanced development along the western and eastern parts of the bay. It also supports ADB\u2019s \nstrategic  priority  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),2 which  aims  to  promote  inclusive \ngrowth and environmental sustainability. \n \n12. \nGovernment  Policies  and  Plans.  The  Government  recognizes  the  urgent  need  to \naddress the prevailing pollution and water management issues of its marine ecosystems. In the \nwhite  paper  Environmental  Protection  in  China3 ,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  attached  great \nimportance  to  the  appropriate  development  and  protection  of  marine  resources  and  the \nprevention of marine pollution and ecological damage to facilitate sustainable development. The \nGovernment is a signatory to the RAMSAR Convention4 on Wetlands, and has issued protection \norders  for  many  national  and  provincial  wetlands  including  the  Jiaozhou  Bay/Dagu  River \nwetlands.  These  actions  are  complemented  by  the  issuance  of  legislation  related  to  wetlands \nprotection  by  QMG,  proposing  definite  and  strict  requirements  for  wetland  protection.  The \ndevelopment  of  Shaohai  Lake  is  a  core  subproject  in  \u201cProject  of  wetlands  protection  and \nrestoration in Shandong Jiaozhou Bay Nature Reserves\u201d (Jiaozhou section) and an integral part \nof the \u201cShandong Province ecological construction planning\u201d.  \n\n13. \nQMG  started  preparation  of  the  new  development  strategy  of  \u201cembracing  bay \ndevelopment, surrounding bay protection\u201d in March 2008. The strategy was to involve the whole \nJiaozhou Bay development and address the future population of an extra 3\u20133.5 million in 2020 \nin the Qingdao urban area. One of the key issues for the new planning is to focus on detailed \nplanning  of several  regions,  including  the  Shaohai  new  area  in  Jiaozhou  City.  The  features  of \nthe  new  bay  development  will  highlight  environment  protection,  new  technology  development, \nand ecotourism. QMG is aware of the need for a comprehensive and integrated water resource \nand  environmental  management  approach  to  address  the  complex  and  interrelated  problems \nassociated  with  such  development.  It  is  for  this  purpose  that  QMG  is  seeking  effective \napproaches  for  managing  its  water  resources  and  environment  which,  in  turn,  may  serve  as \nbasis for further development of other economic/industrial zones in the bay area.  \n  \n14. \nADB\u2019s  Country  Partnership  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  CPS  emphasizes  inclusive  growth \nthrough balanced development and environmental sustainability. There will be increased focus \non  ecosystem  conservation,  and  increased  investment  in  natural  resources  management, \nagriculture,  and  rural  development.  The  proposed  Project  supports  ADB\u2019s  strategic  priorities. \nThe  Project  will  also  support  and  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  and  initiatives  with \nQMG/JCG in several key areas including (i) nonstructural measures for flood management, (ii) \nintegrated  approaches  to  river  basin  management  and  ecosystem  restoration,  (iii)  wastewater \nand storm-water management, (iv) cost recovery and tariff reform for wastewater management, \n(v)  strengthening  corporate  governance  and  private  sector  participation,  and  (vi)  strategic \nenvironmental assessment (SEA).  \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2008.

The Government of the PRC is an active participant in the Global \n15. \nProgramme  for  Action  for  the  Marine  Environment  for  land-based  activities  organized  by  the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), taking part in regional programs such as the \nNorth  West  Pacific  Action  Plan,  the  UNEP  Global  Environmental  Facility  (GEF)  project  on  the \nSouth China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, and the UNEP GEF Yellow Sea Marine Ecosystem \nProject.  To  gain  from  international  experience,  the  Government  has  entered  into  strategic \npartnerships with the GEF and other international partners to develop comprehensive resource \nmanagement  approaches  that  integrate  ecological,  economic,  and  social  dimensions  of \nbiodiversity  management.  ADB  and  other  international  agencies  have  provided  a  number  of \ntechnical  assistance  and  loan  projects  to  assist  the  PRC  in  environmental  and  wetland \nprotection, flood management, and pollution control management (Appendix 4).    \n\nLessons.  ADB\u2019s  water  supply  and  wastewater  loan  projects  in  the  PRC  have  been \n16. \ngenerally  well  implemented. 5  Lessons  from  previous  projects  in  the  Songhua  and  Nanjing \nQinghuai rivers, Sanjiang Plain, and Baiyangdian Lake were considered in policy dialogue with \nthe  Government,  engineering  designs  of  the  project  facilities,  and  capacity-development \nprograms.  Lessons  identified  from  ADB\u2019s  post-evaluation  experience  in  water  infrastructure \nprojects  also  highlights  the  importance  of  nonstructural  measures:  (i)  encouraging  broad \nreforms,  such  as  autonomous  management,  and  introducing  private  sector  participation  for \nefficient  and  responsive  delivery  of  water  and  wastewater  services;  (ii)  appropriate  pricing \npolicies  to  encourage  sustainable  water  and  sanitation  services;  (iii)  the  use  of  management \ntools  such  as  management  and  geographic  information  systems  and  performance  grading  to \nmore appropriately manage water service assets; and (iv) educating, consulting, and involving \nthe  public  in  environmental  improvement.  In  the  project  design,  specific  actions  have  been \ndefined  to  reinforce  the  nonstructural  element  of  this  Project,  notably  taking  into  account  the \nfeasibility report recommendations.6  \n\n17.  Where  projects  have  had  difficulty,  it  has  rarely  been  in  the  construction  process  itself \nbut rather in relation to (i) inadequate or late treatment of resettlement issues leading to serious \ndelays in construction start-up, (ii) inadequate or poor project design, (iii) inadequate knowledge \nof  procurement  procedures  and  complex  procurement  plans,  and  (iv)  low  proportion  of  civil \nworks  financing  resulting  in  loan  savings  and  cancellation  of  surplus  loan  amounts.  These \nissues  have  been  reviewed  in  detail  during  project  processing  and  the  relevant  lessons  have \nbeen  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  A  more  detailed  discussion  of  lessons  learned  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix Q.  \n\nRecent  reviews7 on  reviving  Tai  Lake,  Baiyangdian  Wetland,  Sanjiang  Plain  Wetland, \n18. \nand West Lake have identified a series of features common to effective restoration of lakes and \nwetlands:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nStrong  and  consistent  leadership  and  action.  Restoration  takes  time  and \nresources  often  beyond  the  rather  narrow  focus  of  the  typical  FYP,  and  also \nrequires  effective  cross-sector  and  transjurisdictional  coordination.  Catchment \nboundaries are rarely the same as jurisdictional boundaries, and thus there is a \n\n                                                 \n5   In  the  project  completion  reports,  the  Dalian  Water  Supply  Project  was  rated  \"generally  successful\";  the  Anhui \nEnvironmental Improvement Project, Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project, and Suzhou Creek \nRehabilitation Project were all rated \"highly successful\".

Planning  needs  to  integrate  many  sectors \nincluding land use, and should serve as a strategy that will be acceptable to all \nsectors  for  future  development. 8  The  development  of  an  integrated  planning \nframework  has  often  led  to  particularly  notable  long-term  and  successful \npartnerships  between  the  PRC  and  the  major  development  agencies  and \ncommercial banks.  \nEffective  financial  engineering.  Too  many  programs  have  failed  due  to  the \ninability of county governments to raise counterpart funds and focus spending on \nactivities that create short- and medium-term revenue-raising possibilities.9 There \nis a need for international financing institutions to fund those areas not supported \nby  traditional  and/or  private  funding  sources.  Domestic  wastewater  treatment \nsystems are a good example where one of the major deficiencies is with respect \nto the funding of networks which are not attractive to private funding sources.  \n\n \nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nIII. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe impact of the proposed Project is improved quality of life, a sustainable ecosystem, \n19. \nand  biodiversity  conservation  in  the  Jiaozhou  Bay  area.  The  project  outcome  is  improved \ncondition of water resources and environment in Jiaozhou City and the downstream wetlands.  \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n20. \nThe Project will adopt an integrated approach to address the current constraints in flood \nmanagement,  wastewater,  environmental  management,  and  ecosystem  conservation.  The \nproject  outputs  will  comprise  improved  water  resources  and  flood  management,  strengthened \nwastewater  management  and  pollution  control,  integrated  water  and  ecosystem  management, \nand strengthened project management capacity. A detailed description of these components is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013C. \n \n21. \nImproved  Water  Resources  and  Flood  Management.  This  component  will  help  (i) \nundertake  river  dredging,  embankment  works,  and  greening  over  of  a  total  length  of  19.5 \nkilometers  (km)  for  four  river  courses;  (ii)  upgrade  the  Erli\u2019he  flood  retention  facilities;  and  (iii) \nconstruct 11.4 km of storm sewerage facilities in Jiaozhou City.   \n \n22. \nStrengthened  Wastewater  Management  and  Pollution  Control. This component will \nhelp  (i)  construct  15.9  km  of  interceptor  sewer  along  river  embankments  in  Jiaozhou  City  to \ncollect  and  transport  sewerage  to  the  existing  wastewater  trunk  sewerage  system;  and  (ii) \nsupplement the existing trunk sewerage system with an additional network of 11.8 km.  \n\n23. \nTo  expand  the  wastewater  treatment  plant,  a  partnership  with  the  private  sector  has \nbeen established. The expanded treatment capacity of 50,000 cubic meters (m3) per day will be \n\n                                                 \n8 The proposed strategic environmental assessment on the Jiaozhou Bay development, in parallel with the proposed \nProject,  will  strengthen  QMG\u2019s  integrated  planning  capabilities  through  streamlining  environmental  consideration \nand ecosystem conservation into its plan for further embracing Jiaozhou Bay. \n\n9 The  Project  is  designed  to  use  ADB  financing  to  support  the  construction  and  upgrading  of  the  storm-water  and \nwastewater interceptor and sewerage system as well as the development of nonstructural measures which could \nnot directly generate revenue but are crucial to ensuring the sustainability of the water infrastructure investments. \nAt the same time, the private sector partnership to build a wastewater treatment plant has been established. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nadded  to  the  existing  wastewater  treatment  plant  through  a  build-operate-transfer  (BOT) \ncontract between Jiaozhou authorities and a private company. As a result, the treatment level of \nthe  plant  will  be  enhanced  from  the  existing  class  II10 to  class  IB,  and  will  be  adapted  to  treat \nlimited storm-water flows during high rainfall periods. The Project will provide safeguards due-\ndiligence  support  to  the  Jiaozhou  authorities  with  respect  to  wastewater  treatment  process \ndesign and environmental assessment.  \n \n24. \nIntegrated Water and Ecosystem Management. This component will complement the \nstructural investments with a series of nonstructural measures to ensure effective utilization of \nthe  new  infrastructure  and  facilities.  Activities  are  clustered  into  three  key  tasks,  namely  (i) \ncapacity  building  for  flood  and  water  resources  management,  (ii)  environmental  management \nand pollution control, and (iii) support for sustaining Shaohai artificial lake ecology.  \n \n25. \nTo enhance  JCG\u2019s capacity in flood and water resources management, the Project will \nhelp  JCG  develop  an  integrated  information  system  for  flood,  water,  and  wastewater \nmanagement.  This  system  aims  to  gather  data  on  hydrology,  flood  facilities,  engineering, \ndrainage and wastewater collection network, and water quality information and integrate it into \none data system, rather than it being scattered across various line agencies, in order to promote \nholistic  management.  In  addition  to  capacity  building  on  the  integrated  information  system, \ntraining on emergency response measures, flood zone mapping, storm-water control at source, \nand improved regulation for control structures will be provided under this component.  \n \n26. \nThe following activities have been designed to improve JCG\u2019s capacity in environmental \nmanagement and pollution control: (i) strengthening the participation of the local community and \nindustries in the environmental management and pollution control via training, workshops, and \nimproved compliance awareness; (ii) corporatization and strengthening of wastewater services \nin Jiaozhou City;11 (iii) wastewater tariff reform to ensure sustainable operations and to adopt a \npro-poor  approach;  and  (iv)  enforcement  of  the  environmental  monitoring  plan  under  the \nenvironmental management plan.  \n \n27. \nTo support the ecology of Shaohai Lake and its ecosystem management, the Project will \nconstruct  artificial  wetlands  and  enhance  habitats  to  reduce  nutrient  loads  into  the  lake.  The \nmanagement  of  Shaohai  Lake  will  be  improved  by  strengthening  capacity  for  monitoring  of \nbiodiversity,  surface  water  flow,  water  quality,  and  other  ecosystem  parameters,  and \nestablishing a hydraulic and water quality simulation tool. Further details of this component are \nin Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n28. \nThe goal of protecting environmental conditions in Jiaozhou Bay and preserving wetland \nareas  will  be  reinforced  by  strengthening  both  Qingdao\u2019s  and  Jiaozhou\u2019s  integrated  planning \ncapabilities  through  the  preparation/formulation  of  an  SEA  aimed  at  providing  guidance  for \nsustainable environmental management to ensure \u201cQingdao embraces the bay\u201d (as described in \nparas. 56\u201358). \n \n29.   Strengthened Project Management Capacity. The existing project management office \n(PMO) of the Jiaozhou City Construction Bureau will be strengthened through staff training and \nthe provision of vehicles and equipment. Relevant staff from the PMO will receive training at the \n\n                                                 \n10  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration.  2006.  Amended  Urban  Wastewater  Treatment  Discharge \n\nStandards (GB18918-2002), the 21st Notice. Beijing. \n\n11 This includes strengthening the institutional capacity of the intended wastewater service company, particularly for \nfinancial  management,  improved  accountability,  and  increased  transparency.  The  design  of  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment will incorporate the best international practices for wastewater service companies.  \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nstart  of  the  Project  in  financial  management  and  reporting,  and  ADB  disbursement  and \nprocurement  procedures.  The  PMO  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project  performance \nmanagement  system  (PPMS)  to  monitor  project  implementation  and  performance  in  meeting \nproject  targets.  An  international  project  implementation  specialist  will  be  recruited  to  provide \ntechnical advice to the PMO in technical design review, procurement, and project supervision. \nInternational  and  national  experts  in  the  following  disciplines  will  also  be  provided  to  support \nproject management: (i) procurement; (ii) hydraulic, structural, and wastewater engineering; (iii) \nproject  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (iv)  resettlement  supervision;  and  (v)  environmental \nmonitoring. The terms of reference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nStrategic  Environmental  Assessment.  The  proposed  SEA  on  the  Jiaozhou  Bay \n30. \ndevelopment, in parallel with the proposed Project in Jiaozhou City, will enable the initial results \nand  lessons  learned  from  the  Jiaozhou  project  development  to  be  incorporated  into  improved \nenvironmental planning over the whole bay area. The SEA will reinforce the institutional set-up \nby  encouraging  the  development  of  a  bay-wide  environmental  protection  authority  from  the \nexisting  leading  group  structure,  and  thereby  contribute  significantly  to  the  coordination  and \nintegration of the existing fragmented pollution control and water resources planning with urban \ndevelopment  and  marine  ecosystem  planning.  The  development  of  the  SEA  as  a  statutory \nplanning  document  guiding  future  detailed  planning,  and  the  implementation  will  reinforce  the \nproject  outcome,  enabling  the  Project  to  be  replicated  throughout  the  bay  area,  thereby \nsignificantly enhancing the project impact.   \n  \nIntegrated Water and Ecosystem Management. Increased wastewater collection from \n31. \nabout  55%  to  over  80%  will  significantly  reduce  the  pollution  loads  currently  discharged  to \nJiaozhou\u2019s rivers and Shaohai Lake. As a result, the risk of increasing eutrophication of the lake \ncan be mitigated. However, to reduce and further improve the existing conditions, a number of \nin situ measures involving the development of wetland areas at the point of entry of the rivers to \nthe  lakes  have  been  developed,  together  with  studies  to  monitor  and  further  investigate \nimprovements to water quality in the lake.  \n\nThe  Project  will  complement  the  structural  measures  with  the  designed  nonstructural \n32. \nmeasures,  which  were  well  accepted  by  the  Government.  During  project  design,  hydraulic \nsimulation  techniques  were  developed  to  diagnose  current  flooding  behavior  and  test  the \nadequacy  of  proposed  structural  measures.  These  simulation  approaches  will  be  continued \nduring  project  implementation  to  develop  operational  rules  to  cater  for  events  rarer  than  the \ndesign  events  through  flood  mapping  and  emergency  warning  systems,  and  test  the \neffectiveness  of  storm-water  source  control.  In  addition  to  these  measures,  the  Project  will \ncontribute  to  the  corporatization  of  wastewater  services  and  strengthening  of  tariff  reform.  An \nintegrated information system for flood, water, and wastewater management will be developed \nand operated during the project implementation.  \n\n33. \nPublic\u2013Private  Partnership.  Due  to  the  underdevelopment  of  the  sewage  network, \ninadequate  wastewater  is  being  captured  for  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP).  In  this \nProject,  ADB  financing  will  support  the  construction  and  upgrading  of  the  storm-water  and \nwastewater  interceptor  and  sewerage  system  as  well  as  the  development  of  nonstructural \nmeasures,  which  may  not  directly  generate  revenues  but  are  crucial  to  ensuring  the \nsustainability  of  the  water  infrastructure  investments.  In  addition,  to  expand  the  WWTP,  a \npartnership  with  the  private  sector  has  been  established.  An  expanded  treatment  capacity  of \n50,000  m3/day  will  be  added  to  the  existing  WWTP  through  a  BOT  contract  between  the \nJiaozhou  authorities  and  a  private  company.  The  Project  will  (i)  provide  safeguards  and  due-\n\n\f \n\n9\n\ndiligence  support  to  Jiaozhou  authorities  with  respect  to  wastewater  treatment  process  design \nand environmental assessment, and (ii) promote wastewater tariff reform in Jiaozhou City.  \n \n34. \nThis WWTP will be constructed and operated under a 20-year BOT arrangement by the \nZhongkecheng  Environmental  Company  using  the  A2O12 treatment  process.  The  agreement \nwith the Zhongkecheng Environmental Company has been signed. The WWTP is expected to \nbe  operational  by  the  end  of  2009.  In  addition  to  being  responsible  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  the  ADB-financed  project,  the  public  utility  division  under  the  Jiaozhou \nConstruction  Bureau  will  also  be  responsible  for  the  supervision  and  management  of  the \nproposed WWTP.  \n \n35. \nOptimization  of  Design.  Significant  design  optimizations  were  undertaken  to  improve \nboth  the  efficiency  of  the  overall  Project  and  to  reduce  resettlement  and  associated  social \ndisruptions.  The  Erli\u2019he  Reservoir  subcomponent  investment  was  significantly  reduced  while \npreserving  its  overall  function  and  reducing  significantly  the  amount  of  resettlement  and  land \nacquisition  required.  Initially,  it  was  proposed  to  separate  the  sewerage  system  in  the  older \nparts  of  Jiaozhou,  thereby  creating  two  sewerage  systems.  Experience  has  shown  that  this \nsolution  is  both  costly  and  difficult  to  achieve  in  practice.  As  a  result,  an  alternative  solution \nbased  on  the  use  of  an  interceptor  system  (associated  with  separation  of  the  secondary \nsewerage)  has  been  developed,  enabling  reduction  in  both  investment  costs  and  social \ndisruption.  \n \n36. \nPollution  Control  Enforcement.  A  major  percentage  of  industries  in  Jiaozhou  are \nconnected to the exiting sewerage system, parts of which discharge directly to water courses. \nConnection  of  these  sewerage  systems  to  the  centralized  wastewater  treatment  facilities  can \ncreate  risks  in  relation  to  the  efficiency  of  the  treatment  process  without  industrial  wastewater \npre-treatment. The Project will consider these risks and strengthen pollution control enforcement \nby  implementing  the  following  activities:  (i)  strengthen  the  enforcement  capacity 13  of  local \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs)  through  the  proposed  SEA,  (ii)  train  the  wastewater \nentity  to  undertake  effective  monitoring  of  these  industries,  (iii)  establish  a  community-based \nmonitoring  team  to  help  promote  compliance,  and  (iv)  design  an  appropriate  industrial \nwastewater tariff (as part of the wastewater tariff reform) based upon pollution loads rather than \nsimply water use. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $105.8  million  equivalent,  including  taxes \n37. \nand  duties  ($3.1  million),  contingencies  ($17.7  million),  and  interest  and  other  charges  ($5.8 \nmillion). A summary of cost estimates is shown in Table 1 and details are provided in Appendix \n5. \n\n                                                 \n12  Anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (A2O) is a process to treat domestic wastewater. The A2O process is proven to be effective \nin  removing  the  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  in  the  wastewater,  which  are  key  contributors  to  the  eutrophication  of \nlakes and wetlands.    \n\n13Both the Qingdao EPB and Jiaozhou EPB have established environmental inspection offices which are responsible \nfor  checking  the  level  of  compliance  by  enterprises  with  pollution  standards,  permits,  and  payment  of  charges. \nPrivate  enterprises  are  inspected  by  Jiaozhou  EPB.  State-owned  enterprises  which  are  assigned  a  special \nadministrative  status  are  inspected  by  Qingdao  EPB.  When  noncompliance  is  established,  inspectors  can  issue \nwarning letters, impose fines, or withdraw the permit for a part of or the whole installation. Compliance schedules \n(called \u201cpollution control  within deadlines\u201d) are also frequently used. In August 2007, Jiaozhou EPB carried out a \nthorough inspection of 42 key polluting enterprises across seven sectors, and required these enterprises to reduce \ntheir pollution discharges to acceptable levels by June 2008.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  on  undisbursed \nfunds, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreements. The Government \nhas  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB.

The remaining costs will be \nfinanced  by  JCG  covering  base  costs,  financing  charges  during  implementation,  and  physical \nand price contingencies. The local costs of JCG will be financed from land-use fees and urban \nconstruction  and  maintenance  taxes.  JCG  has  issued  a  commitment  letter  confirming  the \navailability of counterpart funds.14   \n\n40. \nLoan Funds Flow. The Qingdao Municipality is one of the few special cases in the PRC \nthat report directly to the central Government in terms of fiscal revenues and outlays. Therefore, \nin terms of loan disbursement, ADB loan proceeds will be disbursed directly from the Ministry of \nFinance to the QMG. The imprest fund account will be set up in the Qingdao Financial Bureau, \nwhich has prior experience in dealing with loans from international institutions such as the World \nBank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  ADB.  QMG  will  then  onlend  the  loan \nproceeds to JCG with the same loan terms and conditions. JCG will disburse the loan funds to \nthe  contractors  for  project  implementation.  In  terms  of  loan  repayment,  JCG  will  pay  QMG, \nQMG will repay the Ministry of Finance, which will then repay ADB. JCG will assume the foreign \nexchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  of  the  ADB  loan.  The  flow  of  funds  and  onlending \narrangements are in Appendix 6. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n41. \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  is  JCG.  A  project  leading  group  has  been \nestablished,  headed  by  the  vice  mayor  of  JCG  and  comprising  representatives  from  Jiaozhou \nCity  Construction  Bureau,  City  Development  and  Reform  Bureau,  Finance  Bureau, \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau,  Planning  Bureau,  Shaohai  Artificial  Lake  Management \nBureau, Land Resources Bureau, and Water Resources Bureau. The leading group will provide \noverall  policy  guidance,  facilitate  interagency  coordination,  and  resolve  any  institutional \nproblems  affecting  project  implementation.  A  PMO  has  been  established,  comprising  10  staff \nfrom  Jiaozhou  City  Construction  Bureau,  which  include  the  project  manager  and  staff  for \nundertaking  activities \nto  procurement,  disbursement,  engineering,  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards, and interpreting.   \n \n42. \nDuring  project  implementation,  the  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  with  the \ndesign  institutes,  specialists,  and  contractors  procured  under  the  Project.  Upon  completion  of \nthe  Project,  the  Public  Utility  Division  of  the  Jiaozhou  Construction  Bureau  will  be  responsible \nfor the O&M of the completed facilities including wastewater networks, drainage, river courses \nmanagement, and supervision and management of the WWTP, which will be built by the private \nsector through the BOT modality.  \n\nrelated \n\n                                                 \n14 Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  are  estimated  at  about  CNY2.8  million,  and  will  be  financed  by  local \n\ncounterpart funds. \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nThe  capacities  of  water-related  agencies  in  Qingdao  and  Jiaozhou  were  assessed.  It \n43. \nwas concluded that there is a need for assistance to strengthen water resources management \nand  conservation,  such  as  (i)  the  introduction  of  an  integrated  information  system,  which  will \napply  real-time  data  acquisition,  geographic  information  system  platform,  river  courses  and \ndrainage/sewer  system  simulation  software,  and  a  decision  support  system  for  real-time  flood \nmanagement;  (ii)  training  for  the  corporatization  of  wastewater  services;  and  (iii)  planning  for \nwastewater tariff reform. The detailed analysis are provided in Appendix 3 and Supplementary \nAppendixes C\u2013L.   \n\n44. \nThe  PMO\u2019s  financial,  technical,  and  institutional  capacity  was  assessed.  Based  on  the \nassessment,  the  Jiaozhou  PMO  will  need  training  in  relevant  ADB  procedures  during  project \nimplementation. The detailed discussion is in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n45. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  April  2009  to  March  2014.  An \nimplementation  schedule  is  presented  in  Appendix  7.  The  implementation  period  is  estimated \nbased  on  the  project  scope  and  construction  technology  requirements  and  ADB\u2019s  successful \nexperience  with  similar  projects  in  the  PRC,  combined  with  the  knowledge  and  experience  of \nJCG/QMG  and  the  PMO  in  wastewater  management  and  other  urban  environmental \nimprovement projects. The implementation schedule is realistic and achievable. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \n46. \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated \nto  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  shall  be \nprocured  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Contracts  for  goods  and \nworks estimated to be equal to or less than the above ICB values but more than $100,000 shall \nbe  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC \nTendering and Bidding Law (1999), subject to modifications agreed to with ADB. Contracts for \ngoods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  shall  be  procured  using  shopping \nprocedures. A procurement plan setting out the indicative list of all procurement packages and \nthe  procurement  methods  is  provided  in  Appendix  8.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents \nand contracts. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe Project will finance about 31 person-months of international and 100 person-months \n47. \nfor  project  management  support  and \nfunded) \nof  national  consulting  services  (to  be \nimplementation of nonstructural measures. Consulting services will be provided in the following \nspecific areas: (i) development of an integrated information system for management of drainage \nand wastewater assets in Jiaozhou City, (ii) ecological upgrading of the Shaohai Lake wetlands, \n(iii)  construction  supervision  and  quality  control,  (iv)  financial  management  and  corporate \ngovernance,  and  (v)  O&M.  The  international  consultants  will  specifically  provide  training  and \ncapacity building in wastewater management and treatment planning, industrial pollution control, \nhydrological  and  hydraulic  analysis,  storm-water  source  control  financial  management,  and \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  management.  Contracts  for  consulting  services  estimated  at \n$200,000  and  above  will  be  awarded  to  consulting  firms  using  the  quality-and  cost-based \nselection procedures (80:20), in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n\n\f(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consultant\u2019s  terms  of  reference  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Procurement and Retroactive Financing \n\n48. \nJCG  has  requested  for  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  to  enable  early \ncommencement  of  procurement  of  goods  and  services  including  consultant  services,  training, \ndesign, preliminary construction, and small equipment procurement for river courses (i.e., Erli\u2019he \nRiver and Sanlihe) rehabilitation due to the deterioration of downstream wetlands. The details of \nactivities  to  be  financed  will  be  set  out  in  a  written  request  to  ADB.  ADB  has  advised  the \nGovernment that retroactive financing could only apply up to 20% of the ADB loan in respect for \nexpenditures incurred not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. All \ncontracts  for  advance  action  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  Procurement  Guidelines.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that \napproval of the advance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the \nProject.  \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n49. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  QMG,  JCG,  and  the \nPMO.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand  accounts  of  JCG,  the  PMO,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  project  design  and  implementation  arrangements \nprovide  for  mitigating  corruption  risks.  Risks  associated  with  project  management,  including \nprocurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by (i) engaging an international consultant and \na  national  consultant  to  advise  and  assist  in  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  and  the \nengagement of other consultants; (ii) introducing a dual signing system in which the civil works \ncontractor awarded the contract will also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; and \n(iii)  periodical  inspection  by  the  PMO  of  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals \nand  settlements.  In  furtherance  of  the  principles  of  transparency  and  accountability,  JCG  will \ncause  the  PMO  to  set  and  develop  a  project  website  that  describes  the  Project  in  order  to \nprovide  the  public  with  information  on  the  Project,  including  (i)  a  summary  of  the  audited \nfinancial statements of the Project, and (ii) tracking of contract awards in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  JCG  will  ensure  that  the  PMO  establishes  financial  control  and \nmanagement  arrangements  compatible  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management \nand  Analysis  of  Projects  and  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n50. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. Since many of the payments will be made for large contracts, direct \npayment, reimbursement, and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw funds from the \nloan account. To expedite the flow of funds and simplify document processing, the statement of \nexpenditure  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual \npayment not exceeding $100,000. Payments exceeding this ceiling will be reimbursed based on \nthe full documentation process.  \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nA  project  imprest  account  will  be  set  up  by  the  Qingdao  Financial  Bureau  in  a \n51. \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB. Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported \nby an appropriate withdrawal application and required documentation. The initial amounts to be \ndeposited to the imprest account shall not exceed the estimated expenditures for the following 6 \nmonths or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower, to be financed from the imprest account. \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe PMO will maintain records and accounts that identify goods and services from loan \n52. \nproceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures  incurred,  and  use  of  local  funds.  These \naccounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles \nand internationally accepted accounting standards. The PMO will review and consolidate these \naccounts and have them audited annually in accordance with sound accounting practices by the \nsovereign  audit  agency  of  the  Government  or  other  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audit \nreport will include a statement verifying whether or not the funds disbursed by ADB were used \nfor the purposes for which they were provided, as well as the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the \nimprest account and statement of expenditures procedures. Copies of the audited accounts and \nauditor\u2019s  report  will  be submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  consolidated  quarterly  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered  during  the  period,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  proposed \nprogram  of activities,  and  progress  expected  for  the  next quarter.  Within  3  months  of  physical \ncompletion  of  the  Project,  the  PMO  will  submit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  that  describes  the \nachievements in relation to the Project\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs.  \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n53. \nTo  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Project  in  achieving  the  planned  outcome  and  outputs, \nthe  PMO  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS),  which \nwill be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, \nschedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  The  PPMS  will  adopt  the  following  agreed \nindicators:  (i)  physical  progress  of  subproject  implementation;  (ii)  results  of  the  capacity-\ndevelopment  program;  (iii)  water  quality  and  quantity  improvements  in  the  rivers  and  Shaohai \nLake, Dagu River, and Jiaozhou Bay; (iv) improvement in biodiversity conservation in Shaohai \nLake and Jiaozhou Bay; and (v) social development. At project inception, the PMO will develop \ncomprehensive PPMS procedures to systematically generate data on inputs and outputs of the \nproject  activities,  and  the  socioeconomic,  health,  and  environmental  indicators  to  measure \nproject impacts.  \n\n54. \nThe  PMO  will  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm  achievable  targets  and  monitoring \nand  recording  arrangements,  and  establish  systems  and  procedures  no  later  than  6  months \nafter project implementation begins. Baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime intervals by the PMO, including annual reporting on the environmental management plan. \nThe  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  reported  data  through  its \nmanagement  information  system,  and  for  reporting  outcomes  to  ADB  and  QMG  through \nquarterly progress reports.  \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nIn  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  project  performance  will  be  reviewed  at  least  once  a \n55. \nyear  jointly  by  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  review  will  assess implementation  performance \nand  achievement  of  progress  towards  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  financial  progress,  and \nissues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan for their \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nresolution. ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review to assess implementation \nstatus  and  take  appropriate  measures,  including  modification  of  scope  and  implementation \narrangements,  and  reallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  as  appropriate,  to  achieve  the  Project\u2019s \nexpected outcomes and impact.  \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nAn  advisory  TA  grant  of  $750,00015 is  requested  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  QMG  in \n56. \nintegrated  environmental  planning  and  management  to  support  the  SEA  on  the  Jiaozhou  Bay \ndevelopment.  QMG,  through  the  Qingdao  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  as  the  Executing \nAgency  (EA),  will provide  $250,000 for  in-kind  costs.  The  TA  will  address  three  priority  issues \nidentified by the sector analysis and the lessons learned from previous interventions that need \nto  be  improved  in  the  implementation  of  an  ecosystem-based  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement  scheme:  (i)  integrated  planning  and  analysis,  (ii)  an  effective  management \nscheme, and (iii) an appropriate mechanism to monitor and ensure effective implementation. \n\nThe  advisory  TA  comprises  three  components  to  support  the  SEA:  (i)  support  the \n57. \ncreation  of  an  effective  management  mechanism  for  strategic  environmental  and  planning \nprocesses, (ii) the SEA of Jiaozhou Bay\u2019s further development for integrated planning, and (iii) \noperational guidelines and a monitoring system for implementation. \n \n58. \nAn  international  firm  will  be  engaged  through  the  quality-  and-cost-based  selection \nmethod (80:20) using simplified technical proposals in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants.  Fifteen  person-months  of  international  and  60  person-months  of  national \nconsulting  services  will  be  required.  The  indicative  consultant  needs  and  outline  terms  of \nreference are provided in Appendix 9. Implementation of the TA will commence in the first year \nof the Project (2009).  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\nThe Project will benefit directly about 370,000 people living in the project area, of whom \n59. \nabout 1.5% are poor, and indirectly benefit about 3 million people in the Jiaozhou Bay area. All \nthe residents in Jiaozhou City will benefit and their living conditions will improve as a result of (i) \nreduced pollution of Jiaozhou\u2019s surface water, with water quality improving to at least class V by \n2014,  with  longer-term  potential  to  be  upgraded  to  class  IV;  (ii)  protection  from  flooding  and \nelimination of hazards resulting from poor drainage; and (iii) 40% reduction in the incidence of \nwaterborne diseases from 2008 levels, with a corresponding decline in the number of sick days \nand expenses for medical treatment. Approximately 3 million residents in the broader Jiaozhou \nBay  area  will  benefit  from  (i)  reduced  pollution  of  Jiaozhou  Bay,  improved  amenity  values, \nreduced  health  risks  from  the  consumption  of  shellfish,  and  reduced  algal  growths  in  the  bay \nand  surrounding  areas;  and  (ii)  improved  urban  planning  through  the  raising  of  environmental \nsustainability in the early stages of project conception.  \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\n60. \nThe Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. The Government does not \ncharge  beneficiaries  directly  for  its  flood  protection  services  and  other  project-related \nenvironmental  services.  The  interventions  will  not  directly  generate  any  revenues.  Therefore, \n\n                                                 \n15 About $400,000 will be cofinanced from the Water Financing Partnership Facility.   \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nthe project financial analysis only focuses on three aspects: (i) funds flow and Jiaozhou City\u2019s \nfiscal  capacity,  (ii)  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  EA  and  the  PMO,  and  (iii)  the \nProject\u2019s cost recovery and financial sustainability. These are discussed in detail in Appendix 10 \nand Supplementary Appendix J. \n\n61. \nJiaozhou City\u2019s Fiscal Capacity. Jiaozhou has adequate experience in servicing loans \nfrom international financial institutions such as the World Bank and ADB. The Jiaozhou revenue \nsituation indicates that adequate funds are available for the project counterpart contribution and \ndebt servicing. The major source where such funds can be drawn from is the land-use fees and \nurban  construction  and  maintenance  taxes,  which  are  estimated  at  an  annual  average  of \nCNY655 million, and have been stable in the past.  \n\nAccording  to  the  projection  of  fiscal  status  of  Jiaozhou  City  by  2020,  the  total  debt \n62. \nservice  will  be  about  3%  of  the  city\u2019s  total  fiscal  revenue  in  the  first  year  of  the  project \nimplementation in 2009, decreasing to about 2% in 2014, the last year of implementation. As a \npercentage  of  annual  GDP,  total  debt  service  is  estimated  at  about  0.2%  in  2009  and  is \nprojected  to  decrease  to  about  0.1%  in  2013.  Total  counterpart  funds  and  debt  service  as  a \npercentage  of  total  potential  sources  of  funds  range  from  13%  to  15%  during  2009\u20132014,  the \nperiod  of  project  implementation.  This  is  projected  to  decrease  to  about  5%  and  even  4% \nthereafter. As debt service accounts for only a small proportion, it is safe to indicate that JCG \nwill more than adequately cover the required repayments under the loan. \n\n63. \nProject  Financial  Management  Assessment.  Financial  management  assessment \n(FMA)  has  been  undertaken  to  determine  the  institutional  capacity  of  each  implementing \nagency,  funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  internal  and \nexternal auditing arrangements, reporting and monitoring aspects, and information system. JCG \nis  the  EA  of  the  proposed  Project.  A  PMO  was  set  up  within  the  EA  in  May  2008.  An  FMA \nquestionnaire  was  adapted  to  the  subprojects\u2019  conditions.  Issues  or  risks  associated  with  the \nfinancial  management  systems  were  identified  and  the  most  appropriate  risk  mitigation \nmeasures  were  determined  as  part  of  project  design  and/or  project \nimplementation \narrangements.   \n\nThe  results  of  the  FMA  questionnaire  were  analyzed,  with  particular  focus  on  the \n64. \naccounting  and  auditing  procedures  and  staff  expertise.  In  terms  of  accounting  and  auditing \nprocedures,  the  existing  financial  information  system  (i.e.,  accounting,  reporting,  and  internal \ncontrol  system)  is  complete  and  applicable  for  domestic  construction  entities.  In  terms  of  staff \nexpertise,  the  PMO  under  the  Jiaozhou  Construction  Bureau  has  broad  experience  in \ninfrastructure  construction  financed  by  domestic  funds,  but  has  not  implemented  any  ADB \nprojects. Training on ADB procedures and advanced financial management will be necessary to \nensure success of implementation of the proposed Project. \n\nProject  Financial  Sustainability  Analysis.  Project \n\n65. \nfinancial  sustainability  was \nconducted by comparing the O&M costs of each project component with their financing sources. \nSuch  analysis  was  done  separately  for  the  flood  management  component  and  environmental \nthe  environmental  components, \nthe  Project.  Under \nmanagement  components  under \nconsideration  was  given  not  only  to  the  O&M  of  the  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  but \nalso the O&M of the downstream wetlands. \n\n In terms of financial sustainability of the flood management component, the incremental \n66. \nannual O&M cost is CNY4.32 million per year, which is to be financed through a flood control \nmanagement fee. Analysis shows that by 2020, the flood management fee could reach CNY178 \nmillion  per  year,  providing  sufficient  funds  for  the  flood  management  O&M.  In  order  to  assess \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nthe  financial  sustainability  of  the  wastewater  network  subcomponent,  the  existing  wastewater \ncollection  and  treatment  facilities  were  examined.  Analysis  shows  that  the  annual  O&M  costs \nare  about  CNY16  million  for  the  WWTP.  JCG  will  pay  the  WWTP  about  CNY18  million  per \nannum at a BOT price for wastewater treatment services. Therefore, the WWTP has adequate \nrevenue to cover the O&M costs of wastewater treatment. The Government collects wastewater \ntreatment  fees  from  households,  institutions,  and  industries  at  different  rates.  Tariff  analysis \nshows  that current  tariffs  are  lower than  the  BOT  price,  resulting  in  a  fiscal subsidy  of  around \nCNY2  million  per  year  for  wastewater  treatment.  The  subsidy  comes  from  the  Government\u2019s \ngeneral  budget,  especially  from  the  urban  construction  and  maintenance  tax,  which  is  around \nCNY46  million  per  annum.  In  the  long  run,  it  is  advisable  for  the  Government  to  increase  the \nwastewater  treatment  fees  in  order  to  reduce  such  subsidies,  but  in  the  short-  and  medium- \nterm  the  Government  has  sufficient  resources  to  cover  the  O&M.  The  annual  O&M  costs  of \nwastewater network are CNY2.3 million and of the pumping stations CNY0.5 million, and these \nare generally financed by the fiscal budgets. \n\nAnalysis shows that a tariff level of CNY1.35/m3 (as compared to the current tariff of an \n67. \naverage  of  CNY0.88/m3)  would  allow  the  wastewater  treatment  work  to  be  self-financed,  and \neven  show  a  small  profit.  A  willingness-to-pay  survey  and  an  affordability  analysis  were \nconducted  to  assess  households\u2019  acceptance  of  potential  tariff  increases  in  the  future.  Ninety \npercent  of  the  interviewees,  except  the  extreme  poor,  find  the  current  water  tariff  acceptable. \nOther  things  being  equal,  an  increase  of  the  wastewater  treatment  fee  from  the  current \nCNY0.88/m3  to  CNY1.35/m3  would  increase  the  total  water  expenditure  as  a  percentage  of \nhousehold  total  income  from  0.6%  in  2008  to  0.75%  in  2013.  JCG  has  submitted  to  ADB  a \nwastewater  reform  plan  which  aims  to  gradually  increase  the  wastewater  tariff  to  CNY1.40/m3 \nby 2014. The economic analysis is in Appendix 11.  \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nThe  economic  analysis  provides  a  rationale  and  justification  for  the  Project  based  on \n68. \npolicy and sector analysis. It considers the Project directly contributing to pollution reduction and \nflood control. These will in turn decrease health costs and increase the overall quality of urban \nlife. The economic analysis includes the rationale for the Project through demand analysis, the \nselection  of  the  optimal  design  through  least-cost  analysis  design  of  the  plan,  and  the \ndetermination of economic benefits.  \n\n69. \nThe  Project  will  generate  direct  economic  benefits  from  improved  flood  control  and \nmanagement, improved health, and reductions in the extent of environmental degradation in the \ncoastal  wetlands  from  both  the  structural  and  nonstructural  investments.  Currently,  in  the \nwithout-project  situation,  Jiaozhou  experiences  frequent  flood  damage  caused  by  severe \nsiltation and poor flood-discharge capability of the Yunxi and Hucheng rivers. This mainly affects \nindustrial/commercial  and  private  properties  within  the  city  proper,  and  from  various  Jiaozhou \ndocuments, it is estimated to occur once every 3 years. Based on these data, the 2001 flood, \nwhich caused CNY298 million of damage, was estimated to represent the 30-year flood return \nperiod. An estimate of the impact of the 50-year flood return period was obtained from the flood \nsimulation  model.16 With  this  information,  the  annualized  economic  benefit,  in  constant  2008 \nvalues, was estimated at CNY90.8 million in 2011, increasing to CNY120.1 million in 2021.  \n\n70. \nEconomic benefits from reduced disease incidence were estimated based on statistical \ndata  from  JCG  and  information  collected  in  the  socioeconomic  survey.  The  main  diseases \n\n                                                 \n16 The  flood  simulation  model  was  developed  specifically  for  this  Project,  This  represents  a  special  feature  as \n\ndiscussed previously. See Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nincluded in the analysis are diarrhea, dysentery, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A. Due to lack of \ndata, stomach and intestinal cancers and pollution-related diseases were excluded. Without the \nProject, the incidence of stomach-related illnesses was projected to increase from about 11,400 \nin  2009  to  50,200  in  2033.  A  40%  reduction  in  these  diseases  is  expected  following  project \ncompletion,  and  the  benefits  are  expected  for  both  urban  and  rural  populations.  With  an \neconomic cost of these diseases valued at CNY613.80 per person per year, the health benefits \nare expected to increase from CNY0.75 million in 2010 to about CNY12.35 million in 2033. \n\nThe  premise  underlying  the  estimation  of  benefits  derived  from  strengthened  water \n71. \nresources  and  environmental  management  is  that  pollution  will  be  effectively  regulated  and \ncontrolled, thereby significantly reducing wetland degradation. In addition, implementation of the \nSEA for Jiaozhou Bay is expected to have a significant longer-term impact on the wetlands as it \nincreases  awareness  of  degradation  and  provides  a  legal  basis  for  further  preservation  and \npollution  control  in  the  bay  as  a  whole.  Direct  and  quantifiable  environmental  benefits  are \nidentified  as  both  direct  uses  (food  production,  raw  materials,  recreation,  and  cultural)  and \nindirect uses (disturbance regulation, nutrient cycling, biological control, and habitat and refuge). \nOf these, the main benefit is through nutrient cycling, for which direct estimate of the benefit was \nmade  based  on  the  cost  of  treating  the  total  amount  of  wastewater  currently  produced  to \nremove nitrogen and phosphorus, since this is the major source of pollution in the bay proper. \nThis  was  expressed  in  terms  of  the  cost  per  hectare  (ha)  of  wetlands.  The  value  of  wetland \nbenefits  was  projected  to  increase  from  CNY0.04  million  (from  1.1  ha  saved)  in  2011  to \nCNY6.97 million (from 196.1 ha saved) in 2033. \n\n72. \nThe  project  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  at  14.7%.  The  result \nindicates that the Project as a whole is economically viable. Sensitivity analysis shows that the \nproject  EIRR  will  fall  (i)  to  13.0%  if  economic  benefits  fall  by  10%,  (ii)  to  13.3%  if  investment \ncosts  increase  by  10%,  (iii)  to  12.6%  if  commissioning  is  delayed  for  1  year  and  11.1%  if \ndelayed  for  2  years,  and  (iv)  to  11.7%  if  (i)  and  (ii)  occur  together.  Sensitivity  analysis  is  also \ntested  for  each  benefit  and  indicated  that  flood  benefits  had  the  greatest  impact  on  economic \nviability. Sensitivity tests indicate that the returns to the overall Project are generally robust. The \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 11. Detailed economic analysis is presented in Supplementary \nAppendix K. \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Benefits and Impacts \n\n73. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n(2002). An environmental assessment for the Project has been carried out in accordance with \nthe PRC regulatory framework and ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines. The analysis \nindicates  that  the  Project  will  bring  significant  environmental  improvements  for  the  Jiaozhou \nurban area, the downstream Shaohai Lake, and the parts of the wetlands of the Jiaozhou Bay. \nThese include better public health in Jiaozhou City, improved water quality of urban rivers, and \nreduced  pollution  loads  in  the  downstream  Shaohai  Lake  and  Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands.  The \nproposed  SEA  will  enable  QMG  to  introduce  sustainable  approaches  to  urban  development, \nthus protecting and maintaining the functions of the coastal wetlands and ecosystems.  \n \n74. \nPotential  negative  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  Project  have  been \nidentified, and adequate mitigation and monitoring arrangements have been incorporated in the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). Potential adverse impacts during the construction and \noperation phase include unsafe disposal of dredged sediments and WWTP sludge, and limited \nstandard  construction  impacts.  An  associated  requirement  for  adequate  treatment  of  collected \nwastewater  has  been  mitigated  through  project  assurances.  Extensive  public  consultations \n\n\finvolving  meetings  with  stakeholders,  focus  group  discussions,  and  surveys  were  undertaken \ntwice during preparation of the environmental impact report. \n \n75. \nThe  possible  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  subprojects  will  be \nprevented,  or  minimized  to  an  acceptable  level,  if  the  EMP,  set  out  in  the  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination (SIEE) (Supplementary Appendix P), is effectively implemented. The \nenvironmental analysis is provided in Appendix 12.  \n\nE. \n\nHealth Impact \n\nthe  average  population \n\nflooding,  will  gain  more \n\n76. \nThe improved environmental situation will reduce the population exposed to waterborne \ndiseases from various sources such as direct contact through washing, pollution of water supply \nresources,  and  consumption  of  polluted  shellfish.  This  will  lead  to  a  corresponding  decline  in \nmedical costs and the number of workdays lost due to sickness. The medical cost savings for \nthe  elderly,  women,  children,  and  the  poor  would  be  greater,  as  they  are  most  vulnerable  to \nsuch  diseases.  Women  will  benefit  from  the  improvements  in  sanitation,  water  quality,  and \nurban  environment  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  The  poor,  who  are  exposed  to  unsanitary \nconditions  and \nimproved \nthan \nenvironmental and living conditions. To realize the full health benefits, parallel improvements in \nwater supply, public health education, higher standards of personal hygiene, disease prevention \nand  control,  and  improved  housing  and  living  conditions  will  be  required.  The  health  impact \nassessment is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nF. \n \n77. \nThe  Project  supports  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  for \nenvironmental  sustainability  (goal  7),  which  aims  to  halve  the  proportion  of  people  without \nsustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic  sanitation  by  2015  (target  10),  through \nimproved  urban  environmental  management.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  an  urban \npopulation of 370,000 by improving environmental conditions and enhancing sanitation through \nwastewater  treatment,  flood  prevention,  and  control.  Of  the  beneficiary  population,  1.5%  are \nclassified as poor, living below the standard poverty line of CNY1,500 per capita per annum in \nJiaozhou City.  \n\nPoverty Impact \n\nfrom \n\n78. \nThe Project has incorporated two key features to benefit the poor. First, to mitigate the \nfinancial burden of the poor from increased wastewater tariffs, the Project has negotiated with \nthe  Government  that  subsidies  will  be  provided  to  poorer  families.  Second,  the  Project  will \nprovide 75% of the jobs generated in the Project to vulnerable groups, including the poor and \nwomen.  It  is  expected  that  the  Project  will  generate  about  3,400  jobs  during  construction.  To \nmaximize  the  project  benefits,  women  will  be  given  priority  in  the  employment  and  training \nopportunities generated in the Project\u2019s construction and operation phases. \n\n79. \nThe  Project  is  also  expected  to  have  the  following  positive  effects  on  the  poor:  (i) \nimprovement of the living environment by providing better wastewater collection and cleaning up \nthe  polluted  rivers;  (ii)  reduction  of  waterborne  diseases  by  improving  environmental  and \ndrinking  water  problems;  and  (iii)  reduction  of  natural  disaster  (flooding)  associated  damages, \nmitigating possible loss of shelter and assets. \n\nPublic  consultation  and  participation,  which  have  been  key  elements  of  the  project \n80. \ndesign,  will  continue  during  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  Ongoing \nconsultations  also  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PMO  to  (i)  meet  the  evolving  needs  and \nexpectations  of  the  users,  (ii)  increase  the  awareness  of  the  public  about  the  benefits  of  the \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\nProject, (iii) encourage the active involvement of local communities to maximize their support for \nthe Project, (iv) promote environmental protection, and (v)  raise the social acceptance of tariff \nincreases.  \n\nThe social and poverty assessment conducted during the TA implementation suggested \n81. \nthat no indigenous people or ethnic minorities will be adversely affected. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. Details are in Supplementary Appendix O.  \n\nG. \n\nResettlement \n\n82. \nResettlement impacts have been identified and a resettlement plan has been prepared \nin  accordance  with  the  PRC  land  law  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  All \nsubcomponents  were  planned  to  minimize  disruption  of  residential  areas  and  communities. \nImpacts  will  include:  (i)  acquisition  of  42.1  mu 17  collective  land  is  required,  affecting  15 \nhouseholds  with  51  persons;  (ii)  loss  of  use  of  48.7  mu  of  informal  farmland  along  the  river \nbanks or inside the current reservoirs/ponds, affecting 60 households with 212 persons; and (iii) \ntemporary  use  of  149  mu  of  state-owned  land.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  are \nestimated  at  CNY2.8  million,  or  $0.4  million  (representing  less  than  1%  of  total  project  base \ncosts). The summary resettlement plan is provided in Appendix 14. \n\nA due-diligence review (Supplementary Appendix N) of the resettlement associated with \n83. \nthe  implementation  of  the  Shaohai  Lake  development  was  undertaken.  The  resettlement \ndocumentation  has  been  reviewed  and  the  implementation  of  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  has  been  undertaken  satisfactorily  in  compliance  with  the  PRC  regulations  and \nlaws.  It  is  considered  that  resettlement  issues  were  addressed  and  mitigated  adequately.  The \nproposed extension of the existing WWTP will not involve any land acquisition or resettlement \nas  land  was  previously  acquired  during  the  development  of  the  first  phase  of  the  WWTP  in \n2004.  \n\n84. \nADB  requires  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement \nimplementation.  The  PMO  will  report  progress  regularly  to  the  EA,  which  will  summarize  the \nland acquisition and resettlement progress in the quarterly progress reports to ADB. The PMO \nwill retain the services of a domestic monitor for external monitoring and evaluation. The monitor \nwill visit the subcomponents every 6 months to (i) review resettlement progress and the general \nwelfare  of  those  affected,  (ii)  recommend  ways  to  resolve  any  issues  or  problems,  and  (iii) \nprovide  advice  to  PMO  and  local  officials.  The  monitor  will  pay  special  attention  to  women,  to \nassess  whether  they  have  fully  regained  their  standard  of  living.  Monitoring  and  evaluation \nreports will be prepared every 6 months during implementation, followed by an annual report 1 \nyear  after  the  completion  of  resettlement.  These  reports  will  be  submitted  simultaneously  to \nADB and the EA. They also will be uploaded onto the ADB website. \n \nH. \n \n85. \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Standard  engineering  designs \nwill  be  adopted  for  flood  control  and  wastewater  management.  During  project  implementation, \nconsultants  will  support  the  PMO  by  undertaking  design  review  and  ensuring  that  constructed \nworks, goods, and equipment comply with bidding documents and associated quality standards. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n                                                 \n17  1 mu =  0.067 hectares. \n \n\n\fThe following risks could affect timely implementation and economic viability, and reduce \n86. \nthe available benefits of the Project: (i) the WWTP extension and process enhancement is not \nundertaken in parallel by JCG during the implementation of the Project; (ii) insufficient capacity \nto  ensure  proper  O&M  of  project  facilities;  (iii)  ineffective  organizational  structures  and \ninadequate  capacity  of  the  PMO,  which  could  result  in  inefficient  project  development  and \nimplementation delays; (iv) delays in the provision of counterpart funding; (v) failure of JCG to \nincrease  wastewater  tariffs  to  meet  cost  recovery  targets;  and  (vi)  the  proposed  SEA \nimplementation delayed and not in parallel with the development of planning proposals for urban \ndevelopment around Jiaozhou Bay.   \n\n87. \nRisk  (i)  will  be  mitigated  by  synchronizing  the  implementation  of  the  WWTP  extension \nwith that of the interceptor network. JCG will provide specific assurances that are covenanted in \nthe  Loan  Agreement  to  this  effect.  Risks  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  through  provision  of \ntargeted capacity building for the PMO with the support of consultants. Risks (iv) and (v) will be \nmitigated  through  covenanted  assurances  from  JCG  on  the  provision  of  counterpart  funding, \nand  regular tariff  reviews  and increases.  Risk  (vi)  will  be  mitigated  by  the  provision  of  specific \ntechnical assistance by ADB to the Government. \n  \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n88. \nthe following assurances which are incorporated in the Loan and Project Agreements:   \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  QMG,  and  JCG  have  agreed \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimpact  of \n\nthe  project  activities  and  carrying  out  of \n\nJCG  will  ensure  that  capacity  of  Jiaozhou\u2019s  private  sector  funded  WWTP  is \nextended  by  50,000  m3/day  nominally,  in  a  phased  manner,  and  the  discharge \ncontent is raised from class II to class IB in parallel with the wastewater network \nextensions  to  be  undertaken  under  the  Project,  but  in  any  case  no  later  than \n2014.  \nJCG will ensure that (a) the regulations for industrial pollution control and water \nconservation are enforced strictly; (b) a comprehensive plan for reusing the storm \nwater  and  treated  wastewater  is  developed,  adopted,  and  implemented  in  a \ntimely manner; (c) the water savings master plan adopted under the 11th FYP for \nJiaozhou is carried out effectively; and (d) a community-based monitoring team, \nacceptable  to  ADB,  is  set  up  to  assist  with  independent  monitoring  of  the \nenvironmental \nthe \nenvironmental protection awareness education. \nJCG  will  ensure  that  (a)  all  local  and  foreign  currency  counterpart  financing \nnecessary  for  the  Project,  including  cash  advances,  are  provided  as  and  when \ndue to enable completion of the project activities in the scheduled implementation \nperiod;  (b)  additional  counterpart  funding  will  be  promptly  provided  for  any \nshortfall of funds or cost overruns; and (c) the wastewater entity to be established \nby  JCG  adopts  and  maintains  an  appropriate  financial  management  system \nacceptable to ADB. \nJCG will ensure that the wastewater fees charged are gradually brought, by 2014, \nto  a  level  that  ensures  full  cost  recovery  of  O&M,  depreciation,  and  financial \ncosts  including  debt  service  obligations,  and  a  reasonable  profit  margin  for \nwastewater treatment.  \nJCG will ensure that prior to the implementation of any tariff increases, the City \nPrice Bureau will (a) conduct a comprehensive review to determine the number \nof poor people, including those living at or below the poverty line, who would be \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n\f 22 \n\naffected by such tariff increase, and the impact of such wastewater adjustments \non the poor; (b) prepare a scheme acceptable to ADB, which may include price \nsubsidies or other measures such as lifeline tariffs, to ensure that the livelihood \nor  standard  of  living  of  the  affected  poor  is  at  least  as  good  after  the  tariff \nincrease as it was in the period preceding such increase; (c) hold public hearing \nto consult with the affected people; (d) issue a decree before the tariff increase \ntakes  effect  to  ensure  that  all  those  affected  are  provided  with  subsidy  or  other \nappropriate measures are taken; and (e) monitor the effectiveness of the subsidy \nprovided or other measures taken.  \nJCG  shall  ensure  that  (a)  the  resettlement  plan  is  implemented  promptly  and \nefficiently in accordance with its terms; (b) all land and rights-of-way required by \nthe  Project  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner;  (c)  the  resettlement  plan \nprovisions, including compensation and entitlements for affected persons, will be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  PRC  laws  and  regulations,  and \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy;  (d)  all  affected  persons  are  given \nadequate opportunity to participate in resettlement planning and implementation; \n(e) compensation and resettlement assistance are given to the affected persons \nprior to dispossession and displacement; (f) the affected persons will be at least \nas well off as they would have been in the absence of the Project; (g) counterpart \nfunds  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are  provided  in  a  timely \nmanner;  and  (h)  any  financial  obligations  in  excess  of  the  resettlement  plan \nbudget estimates are promptly met.

\n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\n1. \nThe proposed Qingdao Water Resources and Wetland Protection is located in Jiaozhou \ncounty-level city, Qingdao municipality, in the southeast of Shandong Peninsula. Qingdao, the \nso-called  Eastern  Switzerland,  surrounds  Jiaozhou  Bay  in  the  Yellow  Sea  and  faces  the \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic of Korea, Republic of Korea, and Japan. As an important coastal \ncity  with  an  increasingly  open  economy,  Qingdao\u2019s  annual  gross  domestic  product  has \nincreased  at  an  average  of  more  than  10%  per  year  since  1990.  Its  major  industries  include \ntourism, electrical appliances, and petrochemicals. Qingdao is also a major city for finance and \nforeign  trade  in  Shandong  Province.  Seven  districts  and  five  county-level  cities  are  under  the \nadministration  of  Qingdao  with  a  total  area  of  10,654  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  a  total \npopulation of 7 million people. In addition, Qingdao was the host city for the sailing regatta of the \n29th Olympiad which was held in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in August 2008.  \n \n2. \nQingdao,  including  Jiaozhou  City,  has  experienced  rapid  economic  development  over \nthe  past  three  decades  through  intensive  public  investments  and  by  encouraging  foreign  and \nprivate investors to participate in its development plans and activities. This has resulted in rapid \nurban  and  industrial  development,  along  with  the  associated  problems  which  have  had \ndetrimental  effects  on  the  water  resources  and  on  the  overall  condition  of  the  municipality\u2019s \nenvironment. The Qingdao municipal government (QMG) is aware of the need to address these \nproblems  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  institutions  that  are  mandated  to  manage  water \nresources  and  the  environment  in  order  to  meet  its  development  objectives  and  targets.  It  is \nalso aware of the need for a comprehensive and integrated water resource and environmental \nmanagement  approach  to  address  the  complex  and  interrelated  problems  as  a  requisite  for \nsustainable economic development and improved quality of life within the Jiaozhou Bay area. \n \n3. \nIt  is  for  this  purpose  that  QMG  is  requesting  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  in  designing  a  project  that  will  effectively  address  these  problems  which,  in  turn, \nmay  serve  as  a  pilot  for  further  replication  to  other  economic/industrial zones  in  the  bay  area. \nThis is particularly relevant to, and consistent with, QMG\u2019s master plan for Jiaozhou Bay, which \naims for balanced development along the western and eastern parts of the bay. \n \n4. \n \n\nThe Project incorporates the following plans: \n\nIn 2006, the Shandong  Peninsula City Cluster  Development Strategy  Plan1 was \napproved  by  the  Shandong  provincial  government  and  has  been  implemented \nsince the end of 2006. The general objective of the plan is to develop Shandong \nPeninsula  cluster  cities  to  be  one  of  the  essential  advanced  manufacturing  and \nservice centers in the PRC and even in the economic region around the Yellow \nSea. Qingdao is one of the eight core cities and will be developed into the largest \ncity in Shandong. The population of Qingdao is expected to be about 12 million \nby  2020,  and  the  population  of  Jiaozhou  about  1  million.  As  a  leading  city  in \nShandong  Province  and  middle-to-downstream  Yellow  River  area,  Qingdao  will \nbe  developed  into  an  international  seaport  and  a  developed  and  coastal  tourist \ncity  with  modern  manufacturing  and  service  industries  with  an  urban  population \nof 5 to 5.5 million. \n\nIn  order  to  incorporate  Shandong  Peninsula  City  Cluster  Development  Strategy \nPlan,  QMG  started  to  adjust  the  Qingdao  Master  Plan  in  March  2008.  The \n\n                                                 \n1 Shangdong Provincial Government. 2006. Shandong Peninsula City Cluster Development Strategy Plan. Jinan.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nprincipal  concept  was  to  involve  the  whole  Jiaozhou  Bay  development  and \naddress the issue of an extra 3 to 3.5 million in 2020 in Qingdao urban area. One \nof  the  key  issues  for  the  new  planning  is  to  focus  on  the  detailed  planning  of \nseveral  regions,  including  Shaohai  New  Area  in  Jiaozhou  City.  The  features  of \nthe  new  bay  development  will  highlight  environment  priority,  industry,  tourism, \nand ecological conservation eco-supporting in planning new urban areas. \n\n \n(iii)  Water  resources  and  environmental  management  are  always  critical \n\nin \ndevelopment. Qingdao has set as its goal to improve the integrity of its ecological \nand  environmental  position  in  its  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP).  In  line  with  these \npolicy statements and consistent with its 11th FYP and overall plan for economic \ndevelopment,  QMG  intends  to  improve  its  capacity  for  water  resources  and \nenvironmental  management  by  focusing  on  Jiaozhou  City,  which  suffers  from  a \nvariety  of  interrelated  problems  related  to  severe  flooding,  and  consequently, \npollution  of \nits  watercourses  and  overall  environment.  Structural  and \nnonstructural measures will be considered simultaneously to effectively address \nthe problem of environmental degradation. \n\n \n5. \nJiaozhou  is  situated  at  the  head  of  the  Jiaozhou  Bay  area,  encompassing  the  lower \nestuarine  reaches  of  the  Dagu  River  (the  largest  river  basin  in  Qingdao  Municipality).  The \ncoastal  wetlands  of  Jiaozhou  Bay  are  vital,  representing  the  most  important  coastal  wetland \necosystem  in  Qingdao  coastal  region,  providing  breeding  grounds  for  many  types  of  fish  and \nshellfish, a resting place for migratory birds, as well as maintaining coastal biological diversity. \nIn addition, the wetlands absorb excessive nutrients in the river flow before it reaches the sea, \nthereby reducing eutrophication in Jiaozhou Bay. \n \n6. \nSince  the  1950s,  the  coastal  wetlands  around  Jiaozhou  Bay  have  been  severely \nimpacted by human activities including urbanization,  industrialization, and the intensification of \nagriculture. From 1950 to 2000, it is estimated that the wetland area has been reduced by 30%; \nmoreover,  natural  wetland  has  been  replaced  by  artificial  wetland  such  as  salt  and  fishery \n(shellfish/shrimp) ponds. The water environment in Jiaozhou City has deteriorated significantly. \nAs the same time, urbanization has changed the population structure and water consumption in \nthis  area.  Both  existing  natural  environmental  resources  and  management  systems  are  facing \nbig  challenges  to  prevent  further  degradation  in  wetland  areas  and  the  water  environment,  as \nwell as to maintain fast economic and social development in this area.   \n \nA.  \n \n7. \nQingdao  is  a  coastal  city  located  at  the  tip  of  the  Shandong  Peninsula  between  the \nYellow  Sea  to  its  east  and  southeast,  and  Jiaozhou  Bay  to  its  west  and  southwest.  The  total \narea of Qingdao Municipality is 10,654 km2, including cultivated land of approximately 484,600 \nhectares (ha). Annual rainfall is only 689.2 millimeters (mm) on average, but large water surface \nevaporative losses (about 1,000\u20131,100 mm annually), compounded by uneven geographic and \nseasonal  distributions,  present  particular  challenges  for  water  resource  management.  Total \nannual water resources are only 313\u2013342 cubic meters (m3 ) per capita, only about 14% of the \nnational  average  and  far  less  than  500  m3  per  capita  which  is  recognized  as  the  international \nstandard  for  water  scarcity.  Due  to  the  serious  water  shortage,  the  Yellow  River  has  been \ndiverted  since  1990  for  municipal  and  industrial  use  in  Qingdao  City  and  southern  Laoshan \nDistrict,  with  51\u2013130  million  m3/year  being  diverted.  The  current  domestic  water  tariff  is \nCNY2.5/m3 (including CNY0.7/m3 for wastewater treatment charge) and is considered low as it \ndoes not reflect the actual production costs, which are estimated at about CNY3\u20134/ m3.  \n\nOverview of Water Resources and Environment in Qingdao and Jiaozhou  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\n \n\n \nAccording to the Qingdao Environmental Report 20062, the water quality in 40.4% of 31 \n8. \nriver  courses  was  found  to  meet  class  III  national  surface  water  standard  or  better;  the  water \nquality in 42.9% of 47 river courses was found to be worse than class V standard. There were \naround  75,000  wells  supplying  water  from  underground  in  Qingdao  Municipality  in  2004.  In \ngeneral,  groundwater  quality  is  poor  in  shallow  aquifers,  as  reported  in  the  Qingdao  Water \nResources Report 2006. Poor water quality was reported in more than 65% of monitored wells.  \n \nJiaozhou is in the southwest of Jiaodong Peninsula and in western Qingdao Municipality, \n9. \nalong  the  northwestern  side  of  Jiaozhou  Bay.  The  area  of  the  city  is  1,210  km2.  The  central \nregion  of  the  city    consists  of  hills  and  plains  while  the  northeast  region  consists  of  alluvial \nplains.  The  eastern  region  has  the  estuary  where  the  land  and  the  sea  join.  Jiaozhou  has  a \ntemperate  monsoon  climate,  with  high  humidity,  high  rainfall,  and  moderate  temperatures;  the \nannual average temperature in Jiaozhou is 12\u00b0 centigrade. The average annual wind speed is \nestimated  at  5.3  meters  per  second,  and  is  predominantly  from  the  southeast.  The  city\u2019s \naverage annual rainfall is estimated at 776 mm, and annual water evaporation rate is 1,100 mm. \nMost of the rainfall occurs from June to September. Rainfall can be heavy in July and August \nand lead to flooding.   \n \n10. \nThere  are  27  rivers  in  Jiaozhou  City,  and  these  are  mainly  tributaries  to  three  water \nsystems\u2014the Dagu, South Jiaolai, and Yanghe rivers. These rivers are characterized by rapid \nflow  and  short  river  courses  and  brief  riverhead.  During  the  high-water  season,  flash  floods \nfrequently occur, while during the low-water season, run-off is so low that the rivers usually dry \nup.  In  urban  areas,  the  Yunxi  River  from  the  west  and  the  Danzi  (Sanli)  River  from  the  west-\nsouthwest  join  and  flow  into  Dagu  River  in  eastern  Jiaozhou  City.  Water  quality  in  both  the \nYunxi  and  Danzi  rivers  is  poor.  In  2005,  there  were  50  reservoirs  operating  in  Jiaozhou  City. \nThese included two medium-sized reservoirs and 48 small reservoirs, with a total water storage \ncapacity of 62 million m3.  \n \n11. \nThere  are  two  operating  water  supply  factories  owned  by  the  Jiaozhou  City  Water \nCompany  with  a  capacity  of  about  60,000  m3/day,  a  service  area  of  50  km2,  and  servicing  a \npopulation  of  about  300,000  including  Jiaozhou  urban  area,  Jiaodong  town,  and  Yinhai  town. \nThe Qianhan water factory, with a design capacity of 35,000 m3/day, obtains groundwater from \nthe Dagu River basin. The Zhuanglitou water factory, with a design capacity of 20,000 m3/day, \nobtains surface water from the Sanzhou and Qingnien reservoirs. Due to the aging water supply \nfacilities (which were built nearly 40 years ago) and poor maintenance of distribution networks, \nthe  water  loss  ratio  is  estimated  to  be  25%  including  leakage,  billing  errors,  and  unmetered \nwater  use.  Jiaozhou  wastewater  treatment  plant  (phase  I)  was  constructed  in  2003  with  a \ndesign  capacity  of  50,000  m3/day.  The  other  wastewater  treatment  plant,  with  a  capacity  of \n20,000 m3/day, was built in the industry park for textile factories.  \n \n12. \nA wetland area is located in the eastern part of Jiaozhou. The Jiaozhou Bay and Dagu \nEstuary wetland, the only wetland in Qingdao Municipality, is included in the national wetlands \nprotection list. The wetland covers the mudflat and beach from the freshwater zone of the Dagu \nEstuary to the low-saltwater zone of Jiaozhou Bay, and has a total area of about 50,000 ha. The \nwetlands  are  home  to  156  species  of  waterfowl  and  miscellaneous  fish,  and  habitat  for  post-\nhouse to many migratory birds. However, due to the adverse impacts of industrial development \nand  agricultural  activities,  the  wetlands  have  suffered  from  severe  pollution  and  destruction  in \nrecent years. The number of wildlife species is declining and ecosystem functions are impaired, \n\n                                                 \n2 Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau. 2006. Qingdao Environmental Report. Qingdao. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nProblems Affecting Water Resources and Environment in Qingdao and Jiaozhou \n\nespecially in some areas along the eastern bank of Jiaozhou Bay which are already degraded \nand consequently can no longer function as natural wildlife habitats.  \n \nB. \n \n13.  With  rapid  urban  development  and  population  growth,  water  shortages  as  well  as \nfrequent  flooding  have  become  key  constraints  to  sustainable  development  in  Qingdao \nMunicipality  and  Jiaozhou  City.  The  latter  has  implemented  various  water  conservation  and \nmanagement  projects  in  recent  years.  However,  it  is  constrained  by  inadequate  funds  for \ninvesting in new (and incomplete) water resources management infrastructures as well as poor \nmaintenance  and  management.  Key  problems  affecting  the  Jiaozhou  environment  sector  are \nsummarized as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\nFrequent  destructive  floods.  Jiaozhou  City  suffers  from  frequent  destructive \nfloods  due  to  the  natural  topography  and  ineffective  river  flood  control  system. \nThere are three main kinds of floods. First, high water level in the main stream of \nthe  Dagu  River  outside  the  Ccity  combined  with  high  tide  level  restricts  the \ndischarge  of  the  Yunxi  and  Sanli  rivers  from  Jiaozhou  City  area;  furthermore, \nstorm surges from the Dagu River go back to Jiaozhou City through these rivers \nin some situations. Within the city, floods are induced by either problems with the \ndrainage  system  or  local  river  flooding  from  the  Yunxi  and  Sanli  rivers.  The \nJiaozhou  municipal  government  constructed  a  proper  flood  gate  in  the  Yunxi \nRiver in 2003 to prevent the storm surges from the Dagu River and has started to \nbuild  a  floodplain  (named  Shaohai  Lake)  to  contain  the  floodwaters  from \nJiaozhou  City.  There  is  still  the  need  for  improved  drainage  facilities  in  flood-\nprone areas to prevent waterlogging, and upgrade watercourses in local rivers. \n\n \n(ii)  Water  pollution  and  subsequent  impact  on  environment.  Severe  water \npollution  has  become  an  increasing  problem  in  the  city.  In  2006,  the  Jiaozhou \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau carried out wastewater discharge investigation. \nThe survey shows that, within Jiaozhou City, about 48,500 m3/day of wastewater \nis discharged into the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP); an additional 31,000 \nm3/day  is  discharged  directly  into  rivers.  A  significant  portion  of  the  untreated \neffluent  is  industrial  wastewater.  Effluent  from  the  Textile  Industrial  Park  is \ncurrently  treated  at  a  specialized  WWTP  for  the  park;  other  industrial  area \nwastewater is discharged directly into the rivers or the sewers, many of which are \ncurrently  not  connected  to  the  centralized  WWTP.  As  a  result,  based  on  water \nquality surveys by Jiaozhou Environmental Monitoring Station in 2005, the water \nquality in the rivers through the main urban area is poor and classified as class V; \ntotal phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand exceed acceptable standards. \n\n \n(iii)  Water  loss  and  soil  erosion. Jiaozhou experiences severe water loss and soil \nerosion  every  year  with  significant  adverse  impact  on  production,  living \nconditions,  and  integrity  of  the  environment  in  the  affected  drainage  basins. \nfor \nContributing \ncontrolling/preventing water losses and soil erosion for the city. Moreover, there \nis  need  to  raise  public  awareness  of  water  conservation  as  well  as  to  establish \nmeasures  for  curbing  and  monitoring  activities  that  contribute  to  this  problem. \nInstitutional capacities for supervising and monitoring soil and water conservation \nand management also need to be strengthened. \n\nlack  of  a  comprehensive  plan \n\nthis  situation \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nis \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\n \n\n(iv)  Weak  institutional  capacity  and  nonstructural  measures  for  water  resource \nmanagement.  The  capacity  of  relevant  institutions  involved  in  water  resources \nmanagement  in  Jiaozhou  City  cannot  match  the  requirement  for  developing  and \nimplementing  projects/programs/strategies  concerning \nintegrated  water  resources \nplanning and management. There is a need for assistance for developing mechanisms \nand  strengthening  capacities  for  monitoring  of  water-related  activities  and  the  required \nenforcement of regulations for ensuring that the water quality from scarce resources is \nmaintained  properly  for  drinking  purposes.  This  requires  a  complete  human  resource \ndevelopment  plan  for  improving  institutional  capacities,  as  well  as  the  provision  of \nincentives to limit the rapid turnover of staff. Furthermore, plans and policies related to \nwater  resources  management  need  further  clarification  and  be  actually  integrated  into \nthe  district  overall  development  plan.  Emphasis  should  be  made  on  nonstructural \nmeasures  for  improving  water  resources  management  and  conservation  such  as  (a) \nintroduction  of  an  integrated  information  system,  which  will  apply  real-time  data \nacquisition, a geographic information system platform, river courses and drainage/sewer \nsystem  simulation  software,  and  a  decision  support  system  for  real-time  flood \nmanagement; (b) training for the corporatization of wastewater services; (c) planning for \nwastewater tariff reform; and (d) strict enforcement of regulations for water conservation \nand environmental protection (those measures which have already been installed need \nto  be  reviewed  and  strengthened).  This  should  be  complemented  by  exploring \nalternative improved  management practices and technology for flood control and water \nresources  conservation.  The  detailed  discussions  are  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  C \nand L. \n\n \nIn  addition,  water  shortage,  low  awareness  of  water  conservation,  and  high  potable \n14. \nwater  leakage,  are  existing  constraints.  Jiaozhou  City  is  currently  exploring  opportunities  for \nmaximizing  its  surface  water  retention  capacity  through  improvements  to  existing  reservoirs \n(particularly the Guanlu reservoir) and water diversion projects. There is also need to maximize \nutilization  of  existing  storage  capacity  of  flood  retention  areas  in  conjunction  with  new \nconstruction  of  flood  control  infrastructure  in  urban  areas.  This  will  ensure  availability  of  safe \ndrinking water in urban and rural areas. \n \n15.  While  Jiaozhou  City  has  implemented  various  water  conservation  and  management \nprojects, including notably the development of Shaohai Lake (serving both as a flood retention \nzone  and  artificial  wetland  at  the  confluence  with  the  Dagu  River)  and  the  first  phase  of  the \ncentralized  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  there  are  still  significant  opportunities  to  improve \nenvironmental  management  in  relation  to  (i)  the  collection  and  interception  of  industrial  and \ndomestic  wastewater  discharge  directly  into  watercourses,  (ii)  expansion  and  enhancement  of \nthe  centralized  treatment  facilities  to  protect  the  Dagu  River/Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands,  (iii) \nimprovement of rivers and storm-water networks in the old urban area, (iv) development of an \nthe  different  structural  and \nintegrated  approach \nnonstructural  measures  currently  operated  separately  by  different  entities,  and  (v)  continuing

The expected outcome of \nthe  TA  is  the  increased  protection  of  Jiaozhou  Bay  water  quality  and  wetland  ecosystem \nthrough the development of a strategic environmental assessment (SEA).   \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe advisory TA has three outputs: (i) support the creation of an effective management \nmechanism  for  strategic  environmental  and  planning  process,  (ii)  strategic  environmental \nassessment, and (iii) operational guidelines and monitoring system for implementation.  \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nSupport the Creation of an Effective Management Mechanism for Strategic \nEnvironmental and Planning Process  \n\n \n4. \nThis component comprises the following activities: (i) development of a work plan for the \nSEA process through a participatory approach involving the key stakeholders in the \u201cembracing \nbay  development\u201d  strategy;  (ii)  establishment  of  an  effective  mechanism  for  information,  data \nand  documents  collection,  including  data/information  on  planning,  economic  development, \necological  zoning,  land  resources,  water,  soil  erosion,  and  meteorology;  (iii)  strengthening  of \ninformation exchange for all stakeholders involved in the SEA process; and (iv) establishment of \na distribution network to inform the SEA progress.  \n \n\n2. \n\nStrategic Environmental Assessment of the \u201cEmbracing Bay Development, \nSurrounding Bay Protection\u201d Strategy \n\n \n5. \nThrough  the  SEA  process,  the  TA  aims  to  map  out  an  integrated  water  resources  and \nenvironmental plan for further developing the other parts of Jiaozhou Bay. The \u201cembracing bay \ndevelopment\u201d strategy formulation and SEA practice will be an interactive process. The outline \nterms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  as  follows:  (i)  review  the  existing  international  and \nnational experiences in SEA, in consideration of coastal zone management, a bay development \nstrategy,  and  a  regional  development  plan;  (ii)  carry  out  a  baseline  survey  on  water  quality, \nwater and land resources availability, and marine biodiversity types in Jiaozhou Bay; (iii) identify \nthe environmentally and ecologically sensitive areas in the bay area, and formulate an inventory \nof  environmental  limitation  factors,  which  will  provide  the  basis  for  the  strategy,  particularly  in \nterms  of  land-use  planning  and  industrial  sector  distributions;  (iv)  utilize  necessary  modeling \ntechniques to assess the potential impacts caused by the proposed strategy and related action \nplans,  including  direct,  indirect,  and  cumulative  impacts;  and  (v)  recommend  measures  to \nimprove  the  strategy  formulation  process,  and  propose  necessary  safeguards  measures \n(institutional,  legal,  instrumental,  and  investment)  to  ensure  the  sustainable  development  of \nJiaozhou Bay. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nOperational Guidelines and Monitoring System for Implementation  \n\nImplementation Arrangement \n\n6. \nThe  TA  will  support  QMG  to  further  develop  operational  guidelines  and  a  monitoring \nsystem for SEA implementation. It will help the Executing Agency (EA) prepare an operational \nmanual for strengthening QMG\u2019s capacity to develop a sustainable regional development plan \naround the bay area. In view of the large number of natural resources involved and associated \nlarge number of long-term activities to be executed, the TA will assist the EA in establishing a \ncomputer-based information and monitoring system to monitor the changes in natural resources \naround the bay and maintain the record of SEA implementation. The outline terms of references \nare  as  follows:  (i)  review  and  analyze  the  necessary  techniques  for  regional  integrated \nenvironmental management and planning (or regional environmental assessment); (ii) based on \nthe findings of component 2, help the EA prepare an operational manual for rapid environmental \nassessment,  covering  detailed  guidelines  on  a  baseline  survey,  valuation  of  the  ecosystem, \nimpact  assessment  of  specific  regional  development  plans,  the  interactive  process  between \nrapid environmental assessment and regional plan formulation, an integrated marine ecosystem \nmanagement  approach,  and  related  safeguards  measures;  and  (iii)  help  the  EA  develop  a \ncomputer-based monitoring system to monitor the environmental impacts and natural resources \nchanges during the strategy implementation. This monitoring system will also provide the basis \nto examine if the SEA is effectively implemented, and, if necessary, suggest  improvements to \nthe safeguards measures. It is necessary to ensure the SEA is a continuous process and leads \ntowards the social and economic development of Jiaozhou Bay being sustainable.   \n \nD. \n \n7. \nQMG  is  the  EA  for  the  TA.  QMG  has  established  the  Leading  Group  for  Qingdao \nEmbracing Bay Development Strategy Formulation. This group is headed by the vice-mayor of \nQMG,  and  consists  of  senior  officials  (at  deputy  director  general  level)  from  various  line \nagencies. 1 The leading group will provide overall guidance to the formulation of an \u201cembracing \nbay development\u201d document and the related SEA process.  \n \n8. \nin  Qingdao \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau  (EPB),  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  the  Qingdao  EPB \nand  comprising  senior  officials  of  the  Water  Resources  Bureau,  Ocean  Bureau,  Planning \nBureau, Land Resources Bureau, and environmental monitoring stations, and the divisions for \ninternational  cooperation,  pollution  control,  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  ecological \nconservation  in  the  Qingdao  EPB.

The interventions will not directly generate any \nrevenues. Therefore, the project financial analysis only focuses on three aspects: (i) fund flow \nand  Jiaozhou  City\u2019s  fiscal  capacity,  (ii)  the  project  management  office\u2019s  (PMO)  financial \nmanagement capacity, and (iii) the Project\u2019s financial sustainability.  \n \nB. \n\nFund Flow and Jiaozhou City\u2019s Fiscal Capacity  \n\n2. \nQingdao municipality is one of the few special cases in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC)  which  reports  directly  to  the  central  Government  in  terms  of  its  fiscal  revenues  and \noutlays.  Therefore,  in  terms  of  loan  disbursement,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed directly from the Ministry of Finance to the Qingdao Financial Bureau \n(QFB) which is under the Qingdao municipal government (QMG). The imprest fund account will \nbe set up in QFB, which has prior experience in dealing with loans from international institutions \nsuch as the World Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and ADB. QFB then onlends \nthe  loan  proceeds  to  the  Jiaozhou  Finance  Bureau  (JFB)  with  the  same  loan  terms.  JFB \ndisburses  the  funds  to  the  contractors  for  project  implementation.  In  terms  of  loan  repayment, \nJFB pays QMG on behalf of the Jiaozhou city government (JCG). QMG then repays the Ministry \nof  Finance,  which  in  turn  repays  ADB.  The  fund  flow  of  the  proposed  project  is  shown  in \nAppendix 6. \n \nBy a comprehensive evaluation on GDP value, growth rate and development potential, \n3. \nJiaozhou  City  was  ranked  fourth  among  county-level  cities  in  Shandong  Province  and  26th \namong top 100 county-level cities in all of the PRC in 2005. In 2007, its gross domestic product \n(GDP) was estimated at CNY42 billion and GDP per capita was about CNY50,000. The internal \nfiscal  revenue  of  Jiaozhou  City  was  about  CNY1.5  billion.  Total  revenues,  including  transfers \nfrom the upper-level governments (i.e., Qingdao Municipality, Shandong provincial government, \nand central Government), are estimated at about CNY1.7 billion.  \n\nBy the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2010), Jiaozhou City sets the fiscal target of \n4. \n\u201c3211\u201d, which means (i) the internal fiscal revenue of the city proper should reach CNY3 billion, \n(ii)  the  disposable  income  for  urban  inhabitants  should  be  CNY20,000  per  capita,  (iii)  the  net \nincome  of  rural  inhabitants  should  be  CNY10,000,  and  (iv)  the  GDP  per  capita  should  be \nCNY10,000. Projections of GDP and aggregate fiscal revenue were conducted according to the \n11th  FYP  based  on  historical  data  provided  by  Jiaozhou\u2019s  project  implementation  office  (PIO) \n(Table A10). \n\nThe Jiaozhou fiscal revenue situation indicates that adequate funds are available for the \n5. \nproject counterpart contribution and debt servicing. Although there are multiple sources where \nsuch  funds  can  be  drawn  from,  such  as  land-use  fees,  urban  construction  and  maintenance \ntaxes, and wastewater tariffs, the major source is the land-use fees and urban construction and \nmaintenance  taxes.  These  are  estimated  at  an  annual  average  of  CNY655  million  and  have \nbeen stable in the past (Table A10).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n45 \n\nTable A10: Projections of GDP and Aggregate Fiscal Revenue  \n2014\n\n2010\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\nItem\nFunds required for counterpart contribution and debt servicing (CNY million)a\n\n93\n\n98\n\n103\n\n104\n\n18\n\n36\n\n2015\n\n35\n\n2016\n\n35\n\nGDP (CNY million)\nFunds required for counterpart contribution  \n    and debt servicing as a percentage of GDP (%)\nFiscal revenue (CNY million)\n Funds required for counterpart contribution  \n      and debt servicing as a percentage of fiscal revenue \nPotential sources of funds: land-use fee and urban construction \n      and maintenance fee (CNY million)\nFunds required for counterpart contribution and debt servicing as a percentage\n       of land-user fee and urban construction and maintenance fee (%)\na Including the outstanding debt service of the World Bank loan of CNY0.5 million\u2013CNY0.8 million per year.\nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n60,236 72,284 86,018 102,361\n\n121,809 144,953 172,494\n\n205,268\n\n0.15\n2,803\n\n0.14\n3,476\n\n0.12\n4,170\n\n0.10\n5,014\n\n0.01\n6,012\n\n0.02\n7,220\n\n0.02\n8,660\n\n0.02\n10,394\n\n3.32\n\n2.82\n\n2.47\n\n2.07\n\n0.30\n\n0.50\n\n0.40\n\n0.34\n\n655\n\n664\n\n675\n\n687\n\n702\n\n720\n\n741\n\n766\n\n14.20\n\n14.75\n\n15.27\n\n15.13\n\n2.56\n\n5.00\n\n4.73\n\n4.57\n\n \n6. \nWith the Project, the total counterpart contribution and debt service for Jiaozhou ranges \nfrom CNY93 million to CNY104 million during the project implementation period of 2009 to 2012, \nthen decreases to CNY18 million to CNY36 million per year after 2012. This is about 0.15% of \nthe projected GDP of Jiaozhou in 2009, and is projected to decrease to 0.02% of GDP in 2016. \nAccording  to  the  projection  of  the  fiscal  status  of  Jiaozhou  City  to  2020,  the  total  counterpart \ncontribution and debt service account for 3% of the city\u2019s total fiscal revenue in the first year of \nproject  implementation  in  2009  and  decrease  to  about  2%  in  2012,  the  last  year  of \nimplementation.  Total  counterpart  funds  and  debt  service  as  a  percentage  of  total  potential \nsources  of  funds  range  from  14%  to  15%  during  2009\u20132014,  the  period  of  project \nimplementation.  This  is  projected  to  decrease  to  about  3%\u20135%  thereafter.  As  counterpart \ncontribution and debt service accounts for only a small proportion of funds available, it is safe to \nconclude  that  JCG  will  more  than  adequately  cover  the  required  repayments  under  the  loan \n(Table A10). \n \n7. \nJiaozhou  City  has  experience  in  servicing  loans  from  international  financial  institutions \nsuch as the World Bank and ADB. A subproject of Jiaozhou Carbon Black Group, with an ADB \nloan  amount  of  $25  million,  was  included  in  the  Qingdao  Tyre  Project 1 in  1989.  The  loan \nmaturity was 20 years with a 4-year grace period. The debt service has been fulfilled according \nto the loan agreement and there is no outstanding loan amount for this Project. A World Bank-\nfinanced subproject of the Qingdao Irrigation, with the loan amount of $1.43 million, started from \nfiscal year 2001 with a loan period of 20 years and a grace period of 5 years. The outstanding \ndebt service is shown in Table A10. \n \nC.  \n\nProject Financial Management Assessment  \n\n8. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  has  been  undertaken  to  assess  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  each  implementing  agency,  funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing, \naccounting policies and procedures, internal and external auditing arrangements, reporting and \nmonitoring aspects, and information system. JCG is the Executing Agency (EA) of the proposed \nProject.  A  project  management  office  (PMO)  was  set  up  within  the  Jiaozhou  Construction \nBureau in May 2008. An FMA questionnaire was adapted to the subprojects\u2019 conditions and is \nshown in Supplementary Appendix J. Issues or risks associated with the financial management \nsystems are identified and the most appropriate risk mitigation measures are determined as part \nof project design and/or project implementation arrangements.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  1989.

Manila  (Loan  0987-PRC,  $138.1  million, \neffective in June 1989) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nin \n\nimplementing/constructing \n\ninfrastructure  projects  and \n\n9. \nThe  results  of  the  FMA  questionnaire  were  analyzed  with  particular  focus  on  the \naccounting  and  auditing  procedures  and  staff  expertise.  In  terms  of  accounting  and  auditing \nprocedures,  the  existing  financial  information  system  (i.e.,  accounting,  reporting,  and  internal \ncontrol  system)  is  complete  and  applicable  for  domestic  construction  entities.  The  PMO  has \nextensive  experience \nis  very \nknowledgeable in carrying out these works following the Accounting Standards for State-owned \nConstruction  Entities  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  in  1995.  The  financial  statements \nprepared  regularly  according  to  the  standards  are  (i)  a  balance  sheet,  (ii)  an  infrastructure \ninvestment statement, (iii) a statement of investment to be deferred, (iv) a statement of loans for \ninfrastructure, and (v) a statement of lump-sum investment. The statements are reported to JFB \non a monthly basis. The PMO uses accounting software (User Friend), from which all required \nfinancial  statements  are  automatically  produced.  The  PMO  has  also  established  budgeting \nsystems for internal control and a sound auditing system, both internally and externally. There is \nan internal auditor in Jiaozhou Construction Bureau (JCB) who performs auditing regularly. As a \ngovernment agency, it is audited annually by the Jiaozhou Auditing Bureau. It is also subject to \nexternal auditing each year and the auditing reports are usually produced by accounting firms \nbefore the end of the first quarter.  \n \n10. \nIn terms of staff expertise, the PMO has broad experience in infrastructure construction \nfinanced  by  domestic  funds,  but  has  not  implemented  any  ADB  projects.  Training  on  ADB \nprocedures  and  advanced  financial  management  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of the proposed Project. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nProject  financial  sustainability  was  conducted  by  comparing  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  each  project  component  with  their  financing  sources.  Such \nanalysis  was  done  separately  for  the  flood  management  component  and  wastewater \nmanagement  component  of  the  Project.  Under  the  wastewater  management  component, \nconsideration was not only paid to the O&M of the wastewater collection and treatment but also \nto the O&M of the downstream wetlands.  \n\nProject Financial Sustainability Analysis \n\nFinancial  Sustainability  of  the  Flood  Management  Component.  The  rivers  are  not \n12. \nwell  maintained  in  Jiaozhou  City  and  240,000  square  meters  (m2)  river  courses  are  currently \nmaintained  only  once  a  year.  The  annual  O&M  cost  is  only  CNY480,000.  With  the  Project, \n720,000  m2  of  river  course  will  be  maintained  three  times  a  year,  resulting  in  the  increase  of \nannual O&M costs to CNY4.32 million.  \n \n13. \nThe river course O&M cost is financed through the flood control management fee. Since \n2000,  JCG  has  been  collecting  the  flood  control  management  fee  for  the  river  course \nimprovement  and  flood  control.  It  is  levied  at  0.1%  of  the  turnover  of  enterprises  in  Jiaozhou \nCity.  During  2003\u20132006,  this  turnover  has  increased  from  CNY20  to  CNY55  billion,  with  an \nannual  growth  rate  of  over  30%.  Using  conservative  figures,  the  turnover  is  projected  to \nincrease at 10% per annum from 2007 to 2020. The flood management fee should be CNY55 \nmillion  in  2006,  but  the  collection  performance  before  2008  was  not  satisfactory,  with  the \ncollection rate of 10% or even less. Since May 2008, a new directive published by JCG stated \nthat  the  flood  management  fee  should  be  levied  together  with  other  mandatory  taxes  or \nsubtaxes,  such  as  urban  construction  and  maintenance  tax  and  education  sub-tax.  The \ncollection  rate  could  be  improved  significantly  from  10%  in  2007  to  50%  in  2008,  and  later  in \n2020 could reach 85%. By year 2020, the flood management fee could reach CNY178 million. \nAnalysis shows that the O&M cost as a percentage of the total flood management fee revenue \nof the Government will decrease from 10% in 2006 to 2% in 2020. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\n \nFinancial  Sustainability  of  the  Wastewater  Management  Component.  In  order  to \n14. \nassess  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  wastewater  network  subcomponent,  the  existing \nwastewater  collection  and  treatment  facilities  were  examined.  Analysis  shows  that  the  annual \nO&M  costs  are  about  CNY16  million  for  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP),  CNY2.3 \nmillion for the wastewater network, and CNY0.5 million for the pumping station.   \n \n15. \nIn  terms  of  wastewater  treatment,  JCG  pays  the  private  sector  operated  WWTP  at  a \nbuild-operate-transfer  (BOT)  price  of  CNY0.998  per  cubic  meter  (m3)  and  CNY18  million  per \nannum.  Therefore,  the  WWTP  has  adequate  revenue  to  cover  the  O&M  costs  of  wastewater \ntreatment.  The  Government  collects  wastewater  treatment  fees  from  households,  institutions, \nand  industries  at  different  tariffs.  Tariff  analysis  was  conducted  and  the  weighted  average  of \ntariff  is  CNY0.88/m3,  CNY0.11  lower  than  the  BOT  price.  This  results  in  a  fiscal  subsidy  of \naround  CNY2  million  per  year  for  wastewater  treatment.  The  subsidy  comes  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s  general  budget,  especially  from  the  urban  construction  and  maintenance  tax, \nwhich  is  around  CNY46  million  per  annum.  In  the  longer  term,  it  is  advisable  to  increase  the \nwastewater  treatment  fees  in  order  to  reduce  such  subsidies,2 but  in  the  short-  and  medium- \nterm, the Government has sufficient resources to cover the O&M for wastewater treatment.  \n \n16. \nAs  far  as  the  wastewater  network  is  concerned,  it  is  owned  by  JCG  and  operated  and \nmaintained by the Municipal Engineering Division under JCB. An annual O&M cost of CNY2.3 \nmillion  is  partially  financed  by  JCG  (CNY1  million)  and  partially  by  profits  of  other engineering \nprojects operated by the Municipal Engineering Division (CNY1.3 million). The O&M cost of the \npumping  station  is  around  CNY500,000  per  year,  including  CNY100,000  for  electricity  and \nCNY400,000  for  eight  management  staff  and  three  workers.  While  salaries  are  paid  by  the \nGovernment from budgetary recurrent expenditures, the electricity expenditure comes from the \nurban construction and maintenance tax. \n \nRiver  course  management  and  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  will  improve  the \n17. \necological environment of Jiaozhou wetlands located at the downstream end of the Erli\u2019he River. \nHowever,  the  benefits  of  the  wetlands  will  not  be  fully  obtained  unless  there  is  an  additional \nO&M  work  in  the  area.  The  wetland  in  Shaohai  will  be  managed  by  a  major  real  estate \ndeveloper  in  the  area,  Guangdong  Liantai  Real  Estate  Group  Corporation,  with  the  BOT \ncontract price of CNY3 billion including infrastructure construction and preparation, environment \nimprovement, and wetland protection. Wetlands in other areas will be maintained by the Water \nResource Bureau and the source of funds is the flood management fee which, according to the \nPMO,  is  sufficient  for  both  river  course  and  wetland.  However,  due  to  data  limitations,  such \ncosts cannot be accurately quantified at this stage.   \n\n                                                 \n2  Analysis shows that a tariff level of CNY1.35/m3 (as compared to the current tariff of an average of CNY0.88/m3) \nwould allow the wastewater treatment work to be self-financed, even with a small profit. A willingness-to-pay survey \nand  an  affordability  analysis  were  conducted  to  assess  households\u2019  acceptance  of  potential  tariff  increase  in  the \nfuture. Ninety percent of the interviewees, except the extreme poor, find the current water tariff acceptable. Other \nthings  being  equal,  an  increase  of  wastewater  treatment  fee  from  the  current  CNY0.70/m3  to  CNY1.35/m3  would \nincrease  the  total  water  expenditure  as  a  percentage  of  household  total  income  from  0.6%  in  2008  to  0.75%  in \n2013.  More detailed analysis is included in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nflood  prevention,  wastewater  collection  and \n\nThe proposed Qingdao Water Resources and Wetland Protection Project provides public \n1. \ngoods \ntreatment,  and  wetland \nincluding \npreservation  for  the  relatively  densely  populated  county  of  Jiaozhou  in  Shandong  Province. \nThere exists a clear and strong rationale for public interventions. The proposed Project includes \nboth  structural  and  nonstructural  components  including:  (i)  water  resources  and  flood \nmanagement,  (ii)  wastewater  management  and  pollution  control,  (iii)  integrated  water  and \necosystem  management,  and  (iv)  project  management  support.  In  addition,  a  strategic \nenvironmental assessment is proposed to be financed by an advisory technical assistance (TA) \nproject.  Economic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  overall  Project,  including  the  TA,  since  the \nproposed  interventions  to  improve  flood  control  and  management  and  to  upgrade  wastewater \ncollection and treatment are interrelated, and to some extent, strengthen each other. Similarly, \nno separation of the costs and benefits of structural and nonstructural benefits was attempted \nsince  the  nonstructural  interventions  were  considered  necessary  to  sustain  the  impact  of  the \nstructural  ones.  Achievement  of  the  full  benefits  from  wastewater  activities  will  also  require \ninvestment  in  an  extension  of  the  existing  wastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP)  by  2010,  an \ninvestment  that  is  being  implemented  by  the  Government  through  a  build-operate-transfer \n(BOT) model. Completion of structural investments is expected to take 3 years and the final two \nproject  years  will  be  required  to  complete  all  nonstructural  investments  as  well  as  for  full \ncommissioning of the structural investments.  \n \nThe project life is assumed to be 25 years, including the 5-year implementation period. \n2. \nFlood  control  benefits  are  assumed  to  be  fully  achieved  on  completion  of  the  infrastructure. \nBenefits  from  improved  health  and  environment  are  staged  over  3  and  5  years  respectively, \nfollowing  completion  of  investments,  to  reflect  the  build-up  of  impact  from  the  nonstructural \ninvestments. For the economic analysis, economic costs and benefits have been valued using \nthe world price numeraire. Financial costs of nontraded goods are adjusted to their respective \neconomic values using a standard conversion factor of 0.93.1 The shadow wage rate factor for \nsurplus  labor  was  estimated  at  0.90  of  the  prevailing  wage  rate,  reflecting  the  high  level  of \nactivity  in  the  project  area,  and  the  shadow  wage  rate  for  scarce  labor  was  estimated  at  1.0. \nThese  were  adjusted  by  the  standard  conversion  factor  to  derive  economic  values.  All  traded \ninputs  and  outputs  were  valued  at  their  market  prices.  Financial  investment  costs,  including \nphysical contingencies, have been converted to economic values by deducting taxes and duties \nand  applying  relevant  conversion  factors  to  the  various  investment  components  including \nforeign  exchange  costs,  local  currency  costs,  unskilled  labor,  and  skilled  labor.2 The  resulting \nvalues  represent  the  economic  investment  costs  of  the  Project  according  to  the  world  price \nnumeraire.  The  analysis  is  based  on  constant  2008  prices.  The  economic  analysis  has  been \nconducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects of the Asian \n\n                                                 \n1  The  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.93  is  based  on  the  economic  analysis  in  recent  ADB  reports  and \nrecommendations of the President, e.g., (i) ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region \nEnvironment Improvement Project. Manila; and (ii) ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Integrated  Ecosystem  and  Water \nResources Management in the Baiyangdian Basin Project. Manila. \n\n2  Costs of the proposed extension to the WWTP were estimated based on a unit cost of CNY2,500 per cubic meter, \nwhich is in line with similar projects in the People's Republic of China. Taxes were assumed to account for 5% of \ncosts while the breakdown into foreign exchange, local currency, and unskilled labor was assumed to be the same \nas for the Project.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The detailed methodology and supporting tables for the analysis are \navailable in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \nB.  \n\nDemand Analysis \n\nThe population of Jiaozhou City was estimated to be about 891,800 in 2007,3 of which \n3. \nabout  230,000  lived  in  the  project  area.  The  population  is  estimated  to  be  increasing  at  an \naverage  annual  rate  of  1.12%.  Based  on  local  data,  economic  growth  in  the  project  area  has \naveraged  about  20%  per  annum  in  real  terms  since  2004over  the  past  3  years,  which  is  well \nabove  the  national  average,  and  this  rapid  growth  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  intermediate \nterm,  albeit  with  some  gradual  slowing  as  the  economy  develops.  Immediate  impacts  of  this \nrapid  development  have  included  (i)  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  flooding  in  the  expanding \nurban areas, (ii) a high rate of waterborne disease incidence, and (iii) increasing environmental \ndamage  to  Jiaozhou  Bay.  While  flooding  was  relatively  rare  in  the  1990s,  the  incidence  has \nsubsequently increased to about once in every 3 years with average damages valued in excess \nof CNY200 million per flood. As the economy continues to develop rapidly, the extent and value \nof  this  damage  is  expected  to  further  increase.  The  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases, \nparticularly stomach-related diseases, is estimated to be well above the national average and is \nexpected  to  increase  in  the  future  if  attention  is  not  given  to  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment,  and  increased  public  awareness  of  personal  hygiene.  The  current  situation,  where \nmuch  wastewater  is  drained  into  open  channels  and  the  river  network  which  traverses  the \nproject area and permeates into the groundwater, is not conducive to overall development and \nreduced incidence of stomach and intestinal illnesses. In addition, the extent and quality of the \nwetlands  in  Jiaozhou  Bay  has  seriously  deteriorated  over  recent  years  and  the  annual  rate  of \nloss  is  currently  estimated  at  about  0.9%.  All  of  these  factors  are  having  a  serious  impact  on \ncontinued local development and together contribute to a strong demand for remedial action. \n\nC.  \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis  \n\n4. \nLeast-cost analysis was conducted to determine whether cost-effective water resources \nand  environmental  management  measures  have  been  proposed  to  achieve  overall  intended \ntargets of (i) improving flood retention facilities, (ii) upgrading the urban storm drainage network, \n(iii) rehabilitating river courses, and (iv) improving wastewater drainage facilities. Based on the \nfindings,  further  revisions  of  the  preliminary  design  were  investigated.  The  resulting  proposed \ninvestments entail the least cost compared with alternative investment. Moreover, the proposed \ninvestments can be completed within the 5-year project implementation period. \n\nD. \n\nProject Cost and Benefit Analysis   \n\n5. \nEconomic  Costs.  Financial  capital  costs,  including  physical  contingencies,  are \nconverted  to  economic  capital  costs  by  deducting  taxes  and  duties,  and  then  applying  the \nrelevant conversion factors to the shares of local costs, unskilled labor, skilled labor, and other \ncosts.  The  resulting  values  represent  the  economic  capital  costs  of  the  Project  in  world  price \nnumeraire.  Annual  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  include  (i)  operating  costs  for \nproject investments in flood control, storm-water collection, river improvement, and wastewater \ncollection;  and  (ii)  operating  and  maintenance  costs  for  the  WWTP  extension  to  be  financed \nfrom Government sources. \n\nEconomic  Benefits. The Project will generate direct economic benefits from improved \n6. \nflood control and management, improved health, and reductions in the extent of environmental \n                                                 \n3  Jiaozhou City Government. 2007. Jiaozhou Statistical Yearbook. Jiaozhou. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\ndegradation in the coastal wetlands from both the structural and nonstructural investments. Due \nto the extent of road and pavement repair, as well as greening of the urban environment, there \nare  expected  significant  direct  and  indirect  benefits  that  can  be  attributed  to  these  activities. \nHowever, no attempt is made to quantify these benefits due to the lack of data. \n\n7. \nCurrently,  in  the  without-project  situation,  Jiaozhou  City  experiences  frequent  flood \ndamage  caused  by  severe  siltation  and  poor  flood-discharge  capability  of  the  Yunxi  and \nHucheng rivers. This mainly affects industrial/commercial and private properties within the city \nproper, and from various Jiaozhou documents is estimated to occur once in 3 years. Based on \nthese data, the 2001 flood which caused CNY298 million of damage was estimated to represent \nthe 30-year return period flood. For the economic analysis, the damage caused to urban areas \n(the  benefiting  area)  was  extracted  from  the  detailed  flood  information  and  adjusted  to  2008 \nvalues. A further adjustment was made to reflect economic growth in the area since 2001, and \nalso economic growth that is expected to occur in future years. An estimate of the impact of the \n50-year return period flood was obtained from the flood simulation model, assuming a constant \nrelationship between flood depth and area flooded, and hence caused the damage. With point \nestimates of the expected financial value of flood damage for the 3-year, 30-year, and 50-year \nreturn  period  floods,4 the  annualized  financial  benefit,  in  constant  2008  values,  was  estimated \nthrough  a  triangulation  process  at  CNY96.6  million  in  2011,  increasing  to  CNY127.5  million  in \n2021. The financial values were converted to economic values by applying a group conversion \nfactor of 0.94, which reflects the foreign exchange, local currency, labor, and tax composition of \nthe  damage.  The  resultant  economic  values  were  CNY90.8  million  in  2011  and  CNY120.1 \nmillion in 2021. \n\nEconomic benefits from reduced disease incidence were estimated based on statistical \n8. \ndata from Jiaozhou and information collected in the socioeconomic survey. The main diseases \nincluded in the analysis are diarrhea, dysentery, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A. Due to lack of \ndata,  stomach  and  intestinal  cancers  and  pollution-related  diseases  were  excluded.  The \nfinancial  cost  of  disease  incidence  was  estimated  as  the  total  of  the  cost  of  medical \nconsultations and treatment, including lost workdays of care providers who attend particularly to \nchildren and the elderly. Without the Project, the incidence of stomach illnesses was projected \nto increase from about 11,400 in 2009 to 50,200 in 2033. A 40% reduction in these diseases is \nexpected  following  project  completion  and  the  benefits  are  expected  for  both  urban  and  rural \npopulations. With an economic cost for medical treatment of CNY613.80 per person per year,5 \nthe  benefits  are  expected  to  increase  from  CNY0.75  million  in  2010  to  CNY12.35  million  in \n2033. Economic benefits are also derived from the reduced losses in income either by the sick \npersons or those having to provide care particularly to the young and aged. This is estimated at \nabout CNY0.94 million in 2010 increasing to CNY15.5 million in 2033. Total health benefits are \nestimated at CNY1.7 million in 2010 increasing to CNY27.9 million in 2033. \n\nThe  premise  underlying  the  estimation  of  benefits  derived  from  strengthened  water \n9. \nresources  and  environmental  management  is  that  wastewater  production  and  disposal  in \nindustrial,  rural,  and  urban  communities  will  be  effectively  regulated  and  controlled,  thereby \nsignificantly reducing exploitation of wetland resources and pollution loads being deposited into \nthe wetlands. This, in turn, is expected to reduce the continuing threat of human activities on the \nintegrity of the wetlands in the downstream Dagu River, and thereby save the natural wetlands \nfrom further degradation. In addition, implementation of the strategic environmental assessment \n\n                                                 \n4  The  flood  management  structures  were  proposed  to  be  designed  up  to  the  50-year  flood.  Overdesign  probably \nensures that they will protect against the 100-year flood but this additional benefit was not included in the analysis. \n5  Based on a financial cost of CNY660 converted to economic values using the standard conversion factor of 0.93. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\n(SEA) for Jiaozhou Bay is expected to have a significant longer-term impact on the wetlands as \nit  increases  awareness  of  degradation  and  provides  a  legal  basis  for  reduction.  Direct  and \nquantifiable  environmental  benefits  are  both  identified  as  direct  uses  (food  production,  raw \nmaterials,  recreation,  and  cultural)  and  indirect  uses  (disturbance  regulation,  nutrient  cycling, \nbiological  control,  and  habitat/refuge).  Of  these,  the  main  benefit  is  nutrient  cycling  for  which \ndirect  estimate  of  the  benefit  was  made  based  on  the  cost  of  treating  the  total  amount  of \nwastewater  currently  produced  to  remove  nitrogen  and  phosphorus,  since  this  is  the  major \nsource of pollution of the wetlands. This was expressed in terms of the cost per hectare (ha) of \nwetlands. The values of other benefits were estimated using a benefit transfer approach based \non similar wetlands around Shanghai. The value of wetland benefits was projected to increase \nfrom CNY0.04 million (from 1.1 ha saved) in 2011 to CNY6.97 million (from 196.1 ha saved) in \n2033.  There  may  be  additional  benefits  from  the  improved  status  of  the  wetlands  that  are  not \nlost, but these have not been included. \n\n10. \nEconomic  Internal  Rates  of  Return.  Based  on  the  identified  benefits  and  costs,  the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is estimated at 14.7%. The result indicates \nthat the Project as a whole is economically viable. \n\nTable A11: Economic Analysis \n(CNY million) \n\nEconomic Benefits\n\nProject

(i) to 13.0% if economic benefits \nfall by 10%, (ii) to 13.3% if investment costs increase by 10%, (iii) to 12.6% if commissioning is \ndelayed  for  1  year  and  11.1%  if  delayed  for  2  years,  and  (iv)  to  11.7%  if  (i)  and  (ii)  occur \ntogether. Sensitivity analysis is also tested for each benefit and indicated that flood benefits had \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nthe greatest impact on economic viability. Sensitivity tests indicate that the returns to the overall \nProject are generally robust. Switching values indicated that the investment cost would have to \nincrease by 19.9% or overall benefits decrease by 15.0% for the Project to become nonviable. \nConsidered  together,  the  change  would  have  to  be  9.1%.  Even  in  the  absence  of  any  health \nbenefits or wetland environmental benefits, the Project would remain economically viable. \n\nF. \n\nDistribution Analysis  \n\nDistribution  analysis  involves  the  allocation  of  net  economic  benefits  among  the  poor \n12. \nand non-poor in both rural and urban areas. The analysis shows that urban communities receive \nabout CNY11.1 million while rural communities receive CNY22.6 million. The economic cost to \nthe  Jiaozhou  city  government  is  CNY54.7  million.  Based  on  a  poverty  rate  of  0.58%  in  urban \nareas  and  4.80%  in  rural  areas,  the  benefits  to  the  poor  are  estimated  at  CNY0.06  million  in \nurban  areas  and  CNY1.09  million  in  rural  areas,  and  the  poverty  impact  ratio  is  estimated  at \n0.06. \n\nG. \n\nFinancial Sustainability Analysis \n\n13. \nincluded in Appendix 10.  \n \n\nFinancial  sustainability  analysis  was  conducted  for  each  project  component  and  is \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\n                              Appendix 12 \n\n53\n\n \n\nENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n\nto \n\nThis  environmental  analysis  summarizes  the  findings  and  recommendations  from  the \n1. \nenvironmental  assessment  carried  out  for  the  Qingdao  Water  Resources  and  Wetland \nProtection  Project.  The  Qingdao  municipal  government  (QMG)  and  the  Jiaozhou  city \ngovernment  (JCG)  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance \nimprove \nenvironmental  conditions  in  Jiaozhou  City,  the  newly  developed  Shaohai  Lake,  and  the \ndownstream  area  of  Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands.  The  Project  aims  to  reduce  flooding  risks  and \npollution  loads,  and  to  further  strengthen  the  JCG  environmental  management  capacity.  The \nProject  will  also  serve  as  a  demonstration  project  for  sustainable  development  in  other \neconomic/industrial zones around the bay area.  \n \n2. \nIn accordance with the environmental assessment regulatory framework of the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC),  an  environmental  assessment  was  carried  out  for  the  proposed \nProject  by  the  Jiaozhou  Development  and  Reform  Bureau.1 A  first  draft  of  the  environmental \nassessment  report  was  completed \nthe  Qingdao \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau (EPB) for appraisal on 18 March 2008. In the EPB appraisal \nmeeting,  representatives  and  leaders  from  Qingdao  EPB,  Jiaozhou  EPB,  and  Jiaozhou \nConstruction  Bureau  presented  their  comments  on  the  environmental  assessment  report.  The \npanel regarded the report as satisfactory to be used as a reference document for further project \nprocessing  and  approval.  JCG  updated  the  environmental  assessment  report  based  on  EPB \ncomments  in  April,  continued  improvement  works  in  May  based  on  ADB  comments,  and \nfinished the second version of the report in May 2008.  \n \n3. \nDuring  the  technical  assistance  implementation,  a  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination (SIEE) was prepared in accordance with the environmental assessment guidelines \nof  ADB.  The  SIEE  is  based  on  the  environmental  assessment  report  for  the  Jiaozhou  project \nand  includes  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  summarizing  the  main  mitigation \nmeasures,  institutional  responsibilities,  and  monitoring  arrangements.  The  first  version  was \nfinished  in  April  2008.  The  SIEE  was  revised  and  finalized  in  July  2008  based  on  comments \nreceived from the Jiaozhou and Qingdao governments and key stakeholders, including ADB. \n \nB. \n\nin  February  2008  and  submitted \n\nProject Description \n\nto \n\nThe  proposed  Project  will  introduce  an  integrated  approach  to  pollution  control,  water \n4. \nresources,  and  environmental  management.  The  approach  comprises  an  investment  program \nand technical assistance2 to address key problems/constraints hindering effective management \nof  water  resources  and  the  environment  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  be  implemented \nover a period of 5 years from March 2009 to February 2014. The total project cost is estimated \nat $105.8 million. ADB will finance $45.0 million (42.5% of the total project cost). A summary of \nthe Project\u2019s four components is given below. \n\n \n\n \n                                                 \n1   The  environmental  assessment  was  carried  out  by  the  Ocean  University  of  China,  an  Environmental  Impact \n\nAssessment institute with class A certification. \n\n2   The  proposed  technical  assistance  aims  to  reinforce  the  goal  of  protecting  environmental  conditions  in  Jiaozhou \nBay and preserving wetland areas by strengthening both Qingdao\u2019s and Jiaozhou\u2019s integrated planning capabilities \nthrough the preparation/formulation of a strategic environmental assessment.   \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12: Project Summary Matrix \n\nProject Components \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators \n\nComponent I: Improving Water Resources and Flood Management \n\nFlood retention facilities \nimproved. \n\nUrban storm drainage network \ninstalled/upgraded. \n\nMajor river courses \nrehabilitated/upgraded. \n\nExisting Erli\u2019he flood retention facilities upgraded from 0.2 million m3 to 0.8 \nmillion m3 by 2011. \nA total of 11.4 km of storm drainage pipelines installed by 2011. \n\nA total of 19.5 km of riverbanks upgraded/rehabilitated in four major rivers by \n2011.

It  is  an  important \nindustrial  processing  and  warehousing  logistics  center  based  in  the  economic  zone  around \nJiaozhou Bay. \n \n6. \nRapid  urban  and  industrial  development  in  Qingdao  and  Jiaozhou  City  has  had \ndetrimental  effects  on  its  water  resources  and  on  the  overall  condition  of  the  environment.  In \nJiaozhou City, based on water quality surveys by Jiaozhou Environmental Monitoring Stations in \n2005,  the  water  quality  in  the  rivers  passing  through  the  main  urban  area  are  poor  and  are \nclassified as class V, with total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand above the standards. \nMoreover,  during  the  high-water  season,  flash  floods  frequently  occur,  while  during  the  low-\nwater season, run-off is low with rivers often dry. In order to meet its sustainable development \nobjectives  and  targets,  JCG  and  QMG  are  aware  of  the  need  to  address  these  problems  and \nstrengthen the capacity of the institutions that are mandated to manage water resources and the \nenvironment.  They  are  also  aware  of  the  need  for  a  comprehensive  and  integrated  water \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                              Appendix 12 \n\n55\n\n \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nresource  and  environmental  management  approach  to  address  the  complex  and  interrelated \nproblems  as  a  requisite  for  sustainable  economic  development  and  improved  quality  of  life \nwithin the Jiaozhou Bay area.  \n \nD. \n \n7. \nEnvironmental  Benefits.  The  Project  will  mainly  have  environmental  benefits  and \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Jiaozhou  government  to  implement  improved  environmental \nmanagement  practices.  The  river  rehabilitation  projects  will  reduce  flooding  risk,  and  thereby \nsignificantly improving public health. The wastewater interception and collection subcomponents \nwill significantly reduce direct pollution discharges to the rivers in Jiaozhou City. Water quality is \nanticipated to improve urban rivers, the newly constructed Shaohai Lake, the Dagu River, and \nthe downstream Jiaozhou Bay wetlands. As part of the nonstructural measures, the Project will \nalso provide technical assistance to the Jiaozhou government to improve its capacity to monitor \nand  control  pollution  in  the  entire  county.  Through  the  establishment  of  a  management \ninformation  system,  support  for  a  \"wastewater  group\"  in  the  city  government,  and  effective \ncoordination and guidance of the Project\u2019s leading group, it is anticipated that compliance with \nenvironmental standards will be increased and pollution loads will be reduced. \n \n8. \nImpacts  During  Construction  Phase.  The  Project  will  cause  limited  environmental \nimpacts during the construction phase. An estimated 1.8 million cubic meters of dredged sludge \nfrom the Erli\u2019he River Reservoir and the Yunxi, Hucheng, Wushui, and Sanli rivers will have to \nbe  disposed  of.  Sediment  sampling  was  undertaken  during  the  environmental  assessment  for \nregular  tests  on  heavy  metal  concentrations.3 The  results  showed  that  all  monitored  items  are \nbelow  the  maximum  permissible  concentrations  for  neutral  and  alkaline  soil  of  the  Pollution \nControl  Standards  of  Sludge  Used  in  Agriculture  (GB4284-84).  Based  on  the  sludge \ncharacteristics,  field  utilization  is  proposed,  which  has  been  applied  for  years  in  Jiaozhou  City \nfor  river  sludge  disposal.  In  this  Project,  sludge  excavation  will  be  undertaken  during  the  dry \nseason  to  reduce  water  contents  and  minimize  environment  impacts.  Sludge  from  different \nrivers  will  be  disposed  separatelyarrange  disposal  specifically.    The  sediment  from  the  Yunxi \nRiver  (east  of  Haier  Avenue),  the  Erli\u2019he  River,  and  the  Sanli  River  can  be  used  for  farmland \naround Shaohai Lake. Sludge from the Yunxi River (west of Haier Avenue), the Hucheng River, \nand the Wushui River will be used in forest fields or for greening lands inside urban districts. \n \n9. \nLimited  negative  impacts  on  soil,  air,  water,  the  acoustic  environment,  flora/fauna,  and \nsurrounding communities are also expected during standard construction activities. The impacts \nwill be temporary and localized, and if proper mitigation measures are implemented during the \nconstruction  period,  the  impacts  can  be  minimized  or  eliminated.  The  residual  impacts  are \njudged to be insignificant. Similarly, construction activities have the potential to disturb cultural \nand/or  historical  sites,  although  none  has  yet  been  identified.  A  2007  survey  in  Jiaozhou  City \nindicates  that  cultural  relics\u2014which  are  from  Neolithic  Age,  Han  Dynasty  and  Qing  Dynasty\u2014\nare  located  outside  the  Jiaozhou  urban  city,  mostly  in  rural  towns  surrounding  the  city.  The \nimpacts  from  project  construction  and  implementation  on  the  cultural  relics  is  small  and \nnegligible,  if  any  existed.  To  mitigate  possible  risks,  contractors  will  protect  relevant  sites \nimmediately  and  report  to  local  culture  administration  agency  if  some  cultural  relics  are \nencountered, as described in article 32 of the Culture Relic Protection Law. \n \n                                                 \n3   Compared with Soil Environment Quality Standards (GB15618-1995), basically all the sludge samples can satisfy \nclass II standard, which is the level for guaranteed agriculture production and healthy growth of crops. Mercury in \nthe Wushui River and arsenic in the Yunxi River are higher than class II of GB15618. Sludge of Erli\u2019he River and \nSanli River is around class I standard of GB15618, which is the quality level for basic natural conditions. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nImpacts  During  the  Operation  Phase.  Environmental  impacts  during  the  operation \n10. \nphase  have  been  identified  and  addressed  in  the  project  design.  As  major  parts  of  the \nwastewater  collection,  infrastructure  will  be  combined  with  storm-water,consist  of  a  combined \nsystem,  sewer  overflows  will  occur  during  heavy  rainfall.  While  diluted  sewage  may  be \ndischarged  directly  to  the  river  systems,  impacts  are  minimized  by  the  higher  dilution  in  the \nrivers  during  the  wet  season.  The  noise  impact  from  the  operation  of  two  pump  stations  is \nnegligible. The collected wastewater will require adequate treatment. Although the wastewater \ntreatment plant (WWTP) is not financed through the Project, JCG has ensured that the capacity \nof the existing Jiaozhou WWTP will be expanded and that all wastewater will be treated to a 1B \nlevel4 prior to discharge into the Dagu River.  \n \n11. \nDue Diligence. The development of the Shaohai Lake and the required expansion of the \nWWTP have been identified as \u201cassociated impacts to be assessed\u201d with the Project and a due-\ndiligence  review  has  been  carried  out.  The  development  of  the  Shaohai  Lake,  the  key  to \nimproved  flood  and  water  quality  management,  was  started  in  2004.  The  approved \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  report  has  been  reviewed  and  it  is  considered  that \nenvironmental impacts were addressed adequately.  For the wastewater to be collected by the \nProject, proper treatment has been assured by JCG through its commitment (project covenant) \nto expand the capacity of the existing WWTP and improve the quality of the treatment process \n(to 1B level). Moreover, JCG will monitor and ensure, through the support of the Project, that all \nindustrial establishments will apply pre-treatment to comply with national regulations. Similarly, \nJCG has provided proof that the sludge from Jiaozhou WWTP is safely disposed of. Since 2008, \nthe sludge has been sent to the Qingdao Diendi Biological Technical Company and processed \ninto plant fertilizers through biological degradation and harmless treatment. \n \n12. \nproject activities. \n \nEnvironmental  Management  Plan.  An  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  has \n13. \nbeen prepared to (i) agree on appropriate mitigation measures, and (ii) guide the establishment \nof institutions or mechanisms to monitor and ensure compliance with environmental regulations \nand implementation of the proposed mitigation measures. The EMP describes (i) objectives, (ii) \na  summary  of  potential  impacts,  (iii)  mitigation  measures,  (iv)  environmental  monitoring,  (v) \nplanned  public  consultation,  (vi)  responsibilities  and  authorities  for  implementation,  (vii) \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  training,  (viii)  reporting  and  supervision,  (ix)  a  work  plan,  (x) \nprocurement and cost estimation, and (xi) a mechanism for feedback and adjustment. The EMP \nwill be reviewed and updated at the end of the detailed design in order to be consistent with the \nfinal detailed design. \n \nE. \n\nCumulative  Impacts.  No  cumulative  impacts  have  been  identified  for  the  proposed \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n\n14. \nExecuting Agency. JCG, being the Executing Agency, will be responsible for the overall \nimplementation and compliance with the EMP and monitoring plan. JCG will ensure that, as part \nof standard project monitoring arrangements, environmental monitoring reports will be submitted \nto ADB on a semi-annual basis. JCG will also be responsible for handling any disputes arising \nfrom noncompliance with the EMP.  \n \n15.  Project Management Office. A project management office (PMO) has been established, \ncomprising 10 staff from the Jiaozhou City Construction Bureau, including the project manager, \n\n                                                 \n4 Discharge standard of pollutants from municipal wastewater treatment plant (GB18918-2002). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                              Appendix 12 \n\n57\n\n \n\nstaff  for  procurement,  disbursement,  engineering,  and  social  and  environmental  safeguards, \nand  interpreting.  The  PMO  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  supervising  implementation  of \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  and  reporting  to  ADB.  It  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-\nday  implementation  and  compliance  with  the  EMP  and  ensuring  that  mitigation  measures  are \nimplemented as described in the EMP, and will support the Executing Agency in handling any \ndisputes  arising  from  noncompliance  with  the  EMP.  The  PMO  will  provide  the  periodic \nenvironmental  monitoring  reports  to  JCG  and  ADB.  On  completion  of  the  Project,  the \nwastewater entity under the Jiaozhou City Construction Bureau will be responsible for the O&M \nof the wastewater networks, drainage, and river courses management. \n \n16. \nProject  Leading  Group.  To  increase  project  effectiveness,  a  project  leading  group, \nestablished by the Jiaozhou Government, will provide general oversight and coordination over \nthe  project  implementation.  The  leading  group  is  headed  by  the  vice-mayor  of  Jiaozhou  City, \nand includes members from the Jiaozhou Development and Reform Bureau, Jiaozhou Finance \nBureau, Jiaozhou Water Resource Bureau, Jiaozhou Environment Protection Bureau, Jiaozhou \nLand  Resource  Bureau,  Jiaozhou  Construction  Bureau,  Jiaozhou  Planning  Bureau,  and \nJiaozhou People Bank.  \n\n \n17. \nEnvironmental  Monitoring  Arrangements.  The  PMO  will  nominate  at  least  one \nqualified  full-time  environmental  management  staff  member  to  undertake  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring activities. The PMO will further engage a construction supervision \nconsultant  to  assist  in  carrying  out  environmental  management  monitoring  activities,  prepare \nsemi-annual progress reports, report to ADB, and conduct necessary training. On behalf of the \nGovernment,  the  Qingdao  EPB/Jiaozhou  EPB  will  delegate  environmental  monitoring  to  the \nQingdao Environment Monitoring Center/Jiaozhou Environment Monitoring Centers.  \n \n18. \nReporting Schedule. The PMO, with the assistance of project consultants, will monitor \nand  assess  overall  project  activities  under  the  project  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nincluding  environmental  targets.  The  PMO  will  submit  to  ADB  the  EMP  progress  reports  and \ninformation  on  project  implementation  and  the  environmental  performance  of  the  contactors. \nThese  reports  will  include  (i)  semi-annual  environmental  reports  on  EMP  implementation,  and \n(ii) environmental compliance monitoring and audit report of the completion of each subproject.  \n \n19.  Monitoring  Costs.  The  costs  for  the  implementation  of  the  monitoring  plan  during  the \nconstruction phase is minimal, estimated at CNY120,000 over a period of 4 years. The annual \ncosts for monitoring during the operation phase will be approximately  CNY40,000/year. These \ncosts have been included in the project cost tables. \n \nF. \n\nPublic Consultations and Disclosure \n\nPublic  Consultations.  Two  rounds  of  public  consultations  and  information  disclosure \n20. \nwere  conducted  in January  and  February  2008.  The  consultations  focused  on  project-affected \npeople in Shinan Community, Yunxi New Village, Yunxi Street Administration Office, Zhongyun \nStreet Administration Office, and Fuan Street Administration Office. A questionnaire survey was \nin  Dongguan  Street,  Lanzhou  Street, \nconducted  among  project-affected  people \nShimenshou Street, Longzhou Street, and Lanzhou West Street. More than 87% of interviewed \npeople  live  within  2  kilometers  of  the  proposed  Project.  Being  dissatisfied  with  current  water \nquality, and eager to solve the existing problems of environmental pollution, 98.2% of the total \ninterviewed people agreed with the construction of the Project, and expressed their expectations \nthat  the  Project  will  bring  significant  environmental  benefits.  During  the  consultation,  local \ncommunities  also  expressed  concerns  regarding  possible  adverse  impacts  during  the \n\nliving \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nconstruction phase, and would like construction agencies to take suitable measures to mitigate \nthe impacts. \n \n21. \nDisclosure. Disclosure of project information was carried out in two rounds on 14 March \n2008 and early April 2008. The project scope, environmental impacts, and mitigation measures \nwere  posted  on  the  Jiaozhou  government's  website5 www.jiaozhou.gov.cn.  In  addition,  (i)  the \nSIEE will be made available for review on ADB's website before consideration of the Project by \nthe ADB Board; (ii) copies of the full environmental assessment report will be made available on \nrequest; (iii) all environmental monitoring reports will be provided to the Qingdao EPB/Jiaozhou \nEPB  and  ADB;  and  (iv)  a  formal  grievance  redress  committee  will  be  established  to  answer \npublic complaints as discussed in former sections. \n \nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n22. \nThe  Project  will  have  positive  environmental  impacts  by  reducing  flooding  and \nassociated  pollution  and  health  hazards  in  Jiaozhou  urban  city.  The  Project  will  significantly \nimprove  water  quality  in  the  urban  rivers  and  Shaohai  Lake.  By  assuring  that  all  wastewater \ncollected by the Project will be treated to a class IB level through an expansion of the existing \nJiaozhou WWTP, JCG will reduce overall pollution loads on the Dagu River and Jiaozhou Bay. \nComplemented  by  improved  environmental  management  capacity,  the  Project  is  expected  to \ninitiate sustainable planning process, contribute to halting the degradation of the wetland areas \nin Jiaozhou Bay, and contribute significantly to improved water quality in the bay. \n \n23. \nPotential adverse environmental impacts during both construction and operation periods \ninclude  unsafe  disposal  of  dredged  sediments  and  WWTP  sludge,  and  limited  standard \nconstruction  impacts.  All  these  impacts  have  been  analyzed  in  the  project  environmental \nassessment report and SIEE. Specific environmental mitigation measures will be undertaken to \nminimize the adverse impact. No further studies are considered to be necessary. \n \n24. \nExtensive  community  consultation  indicated  that  most  of  the  affected  people  have  a \npositive  attitude  towards  the  Project  and  that  they  believe  it  will  benefit the  local  environment, \nliving  standards,  and  economic  development.  Negative  opinions  on  the  Project  focused  on \nlocalized  noise,  odor,  and  air  pollution  associated  with  the  construction  phase.  The \nenvironmental mitigation measures have been developed to address these specific concerns. \n \nH. \n\nConclusion \n\n25. \nThe proposed Project will have significant positive environmental impacts in the project \narea, including enhanced urban flood prevention in Jiaozhou City and improved water quality of \nurban  water  bodies,  the  Shaohai  Lake,  and  the  downstream  Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands.  The \nproposed  strategic  environmental  assessment  will  enable  JCG  and  QMG  to  introduce \nsustainable approaches to urban development, thus protecting and maintaining the functions of \nthe  coastal  wetlands  and  ecosystems.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  SIEE,  the  Project  will  not \ngenerate significant environmental impacts, provided the mitigation measures are implemented \nappropriately. \n \n\n                                                 \n5 Available: http://www.jiaozhou.gov.cn/jzoa/jiaozhou/zwgg/zwgg/200804/5753.html.  \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                          Appendix 13 \n\n                \n59\n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY   \n\n \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nCountry/Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China/Qingdao Water Resources and Wetland Protection Project \n\nProject Loan \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nEast Asia Department/ \nAgriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources Division \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\n \nThe  goal  of  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP  2006\u20132010)  is  to  build  a \nharmonious society. To achieve the goal, the Government aims for a balanced development strategy that builds a harmonious \nsociety  and  a  socialist  market  economy  that  is  energy-efficient  and  environmentally  friendly.  In  the  FYP,  a  number  of \nenvironmental and natural resources concerns are given priority, which include, among others (i) land degradation, (ii) water \nshortage and pollution, (iii) poor urban environmental infrastructure, (iv) degradation of marine ecosystems and wetlands, (v) \nincreasing frequency and intensity of environmental accidents, and (vi) global environmental issues such as climate change \nand greenhouse gas emissions. The Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued a series of policy directives on \nenvironmental  protection  for  the  11th  FYP  period.  These  policy  directions  are  incorporated  into  the  National  Economic  and \nSocial  Development  Master  Plan  which  was  developed  in  March  2006.  This  plan  gives  priority  to  (i)  protection  and \nrehabilitation  of  valued  ecosystems;  (ii)  increasing  efforts  in  pollution  control;  (iii)  improving  natural  resource  management; \nand (iv) sustainable utilization of marine/water resources. As a guiding policy for the 11th FYP, the State Council directive sets \nforth two broad environmental objectives for the next 5\u201315 years. By 2010, the environmental quality of key regions and cities \nwill  be  improved,  and  the  trend  of  ecological  degradation  will  be  arrested.  By  2020,  the  quality  of  the  environment  and  the \nstate of the country\u2019s ecosystems will have improved significantly. There are many other specific targets set under 11th FYP \nbut the reduction in energy intensity by 20% and total pollution loading by 10% are the two most prominent. \n\nIn accordance with the PRC\u2019s FYP, the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) country partnership strategy for PRC 2008\u20132010 \nemphasizes  inclusive  growth  through  balanced  development  and  environmental  sustainability.  ADB,  as  per  its  long-term \nstrategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020),  will  pay  greater  attention  to  poverty  reduction,  management  of  natural \nresources  and  ecosystems,  and  increasing  its  investment  in  natural  resources  management,  agriculture,  and  rural \ndevelopment.  \n\nThe  proposed  Qingdao  Water  Resources  and  Wetland  Protection  Project  (the  Project)  supports  ADB\u2019s  strategic  priorities. \nWith rapid urban development and population growth, severe pollution of water resources as well as frequent flooding have \nbecome  key  constraints  to  sustainable  development  in  Qingdao  Municipality  and  Jiaozhou  City.  While  various  water \nconservation  and  management  projects  have  been  implemented  by  the  Government  in  recent  years,  there  are  still \nopportunities  to  improve  environmental  management  in  the  area.  The  Project  aims  to  bring  tangible  benefits  to  the \nenvironment  of  Jiaozhou  Bay  area  by  (i)  reducing  water  pollution;  (ii)  protecting  water  resources;  (iii)  reducing  economic \nlosses and disruption to livelihoods from frequent localized flooding; (iv) enhancing wetland ecosystems in both Shaohai Lake \nand  the  Dagu  Estuary/Jiaozhou  Bay  wetlands;  (v)  promoting  sustainable  economic  development;  (vi)  improving  the \nenvironment, living conditions, and public health standards; and (vii) improving public service delivery through corporatization \nand  improved  financial  sustainability.  The  poverty  and  social  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  will  contribute  to  (i)  reduced \nsurface and groundwater pollution; (ii) reduced risks of exposure to  waterborne and vector-borne diseases,  with associated \nreduction  in  medical  costs  and  number  of  workdays  lost;  (iii)  increased  employment  opportunities  and  income-generation \nactivities from temporary job creation during the construction period and permanent job creation during the operation period; \nand  (iv)  decreased  flood-associated  damages  and  economic  losses.  The  expected  outcome  is  improved  condition  of  water \nresources  and  environment  in  Jiaozhou  and  the  downstream  wetlands.  Its  impact  is  improved  quality  of  life,  a  sustainable \necosystem, and biodiversity conservation in Jiaozhou Bay. The project impact will be enhanced by the replication of project \nlessons to other newly developed zones within Qingdao municipal government territory by the implementation of a strategic \nenvironmental assessment as an integral part of strategic planning of future economic development in the Jiaozhou Bay area. \nThe Project will benefit directly about 370,000 people living in the project area, of whom about 1.5% are poor.  \n\nThe Project will also assist the PRC\u2019s progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goal 7, target 10, to halve by 2015 \nthe  proportion  of  people  without  access  to  basic  sanitation,  by  increasing  coverage  of  the  Jiaozhou  public  service  systems \nincluding urban drainage to serve an estimated 370,000 people by 2010 and 450,000 by 2015. \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \n\n \n\n1.    Key Issues  \n \nCurrently, 34 poor counties  and more than  2.3 million  people in Shandong province are living below  the rural  poverty line of \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nCNY1,000 per  capita per annum. Qingdao City in Shandong Province, however, is a rapidly urbanizing municipality,  and the \nper capita annual net income of urban and rural residents is greater than that of both the PRC and Shandong Province. The \nQingdao 2006 Statistics Yearbook shows that per capita annual net income of rural residents was CNY6,546, and per capita \nannual  disposable  income  of  urban  residents  was  CNY15,328.  The  poor  population  who  had  been  supported  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s livelihood subsidy program\u2014those living on CNY1,500 per capita per annum in rural areas and CNY3,600 per \ncapita per annum in urban areas\u2014 numbered 106,637, or 1.42% of the total population in the city. In Jiaozhou City, the rural \nand urban minimum livelihood subsidy standards are set at CNY1,500 per capita per annum for rural areas and CNY2,880 per \ncapita per annum for urban areas. Those who were entitled to this subsidy totaled 10,493, or 1.5% of the total population in the \ncity.  \n \nThe socioeconomic survey showed that most of the urban poor are unemployed workers, part-time workers, the disabled, the \nelderly,  and  retirees.  The  cause  of  urban  relative  poverty  groups  are  low  income  from  employment  (68.1%),  illness  (12.1%), \nlack of knowledge or skills (12.1%), insufficient labor (4.3%), and others (3.4%). This unemployment is usually due to lack of \nemployment opportunities and income resources. \n \n2.     Design Features  \n \nThe  Project  has  incorporated  two  key  features  to  benefit  the  poor.  First,  to  mitigate  the  financial  burden  of  the  poor  from \nincreased  wastewater  collection  tariffs  due  to  service  improvement,  the  Project  has  negotiated  with  the  Government  that \nsubsidies  will  be  provided  to  poorer  families.  Second,  the  Project  will  provide  75%  of  the  jobs  generated  in  the  Project  to \nvulnerable  groups  including  the  poor  and  women.  It  is  expected  that  the  Project  will  generate  about  3,400  jobs  during  the \nconstruction period. To maximize the project benefits, women will be given priority in the employment and training opportunities \ngenerated in the Project\u2019s construction and operation phases. \n \nThe Project is also expected to have the following positive effects on the poor: \n\n(i) \n\nImproving the living environment. The Project can improve the living environment of poor families by providing better \nwastewater collection and cleaning up the polluted rivers.  \n\n(ii)  Reducing  incidences  of  waterborne  diseases.  The  Project  will  improve  hygiene  and  drinking  water  problems, \nthereby  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases.  Poor  families  often  ignore  minor  illnesses,  at  times  even  the \nmajor ones, due to financial constraints. The Project can reduce incidences of waterborne diseases and guarantee the \nbasic living standard of poor families. \n\n(iii)  Poverty-relief  effect.  The  Project  is  expected  to  reduce  natural  disaster  (flooding)  associated  damages,  providing  a \n\nguarantee to the poor population\u2019s housing and finance. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.   Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nA  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  in  line  with  ADB  guidelines  to  collect  detailed  social  information  necessary  to \ninform project design, and identify poverty reduction and social development objectives, outcomes, and indicators. The poverty \nand  social  analysis  identified  vulnerable  groups,  opportunities  for  pro-poor  interventions  and  recommended  social  action \nmeasures, and participation and mitigation plans to achieve positive social benefits. \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  improved  public  services  to  residents  in  Jiaozhou.  The  direct  social  benefits  include  improved \ncleanliness and health, reduction in incidence of disease, increased job opportunities, and flooding control. However, the main \nsocial risks are identified, such as poor families being unable to afford the service of basic infrastructure and facilities such as \nwastewater services, and less ability to cope with pollution and a degraded environment. They often suffer from wastewater \npollution and poor urban environmental sanitation, which in turn increase their exposure to water pollution. This may put them \nat high risk of diseases related to water pollution such as diarrhea, hepatitis, and respiratory diseases. Thus, the Project will \nprovide equal benefits to poor people through reduced (or free) wastewater treatment charges. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.     Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe  poverty  and  social  assessment  utilized  a  number  of  participation  processes  to  solicit  the  input  of  a  cross  section  of \nstakeholders.  Stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  during  the  poverty  and  social  assessment.  Various  methods  and \napproaches  have  been  conducted,  including  400  households  sampling  socioeconomic  survey,  stakeholder  consultation \nmeetings and workshops, eight focus group discussions, and 103 key informant interviews. The main stakeholder groups are \nurban residents, women, poor people, enterprise owners, and local decision makers including relevant government agencies at \ncounty/committee levels, project management office, project implementation agencies, and the  private  sector. Formulation  of \nthe  short  resettlement  plan  utilized  separate  socioeconomic  surveys,  community  meetings,  opinion  surveys,  and  specific \nimpact studies in May 2008. \n \nAdditionally,  three  rounds  of  public  consultations  in  the  project  areas  were  carried  out  to  prepare  the  environmental  impact \nassessment, social assessment, and the short resettlement plan. The public consultations and information disclosure included \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                          Appendix 13 \n\n                \n61\n\n(i) introducing the project components to the stakeholders; (ii) collecting ideas, suggestions, comments, concerns, and critiques \non  the  potential  environmental  implications  of  the  Project;  and  (iii)  presenting  the  findings  of  the  environmental  impact \nassessment,  social  assessment,  and  short  resettlement  plan,  summarizing  potential  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation \nmeasure,  and  providing  answers  raised  by  workshop  participants.  The  participation  will  be  carried  out  throughout  the  whole \nprocess of the resettlement plan, environmental impact assessment, and environmental management plan implementation. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n\nPublic  consultation  and  participation,  which  have  been  key  elements  of  the  project  design,  will  continue  during  project \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Ongoing consultations will be carried out by the implementing agencies to (i) meet \nthe evolving needs and expectations of the users, (ii) increase the awareness of the public about the benefits of the Project, (iii) \nencourage  the  active  involvement  of  local  communities  to  maximize  their  support  for  the  Project,  (iv)  promote  environmental \nprotection,  and  (v)  raise  the  social  acceptance  of  tariff  increases.  Moreover,  measures  to  actively  involve  communities  have \nbeen  established  in  the  design.  Community-based  monitoring  team  is  planned  to  be  set  up  to  help  project  construction \nlaborers\u2019 selection, environmental protection awareness education, coordination with other stakeholders, reflect their views on \nthe project implementation, etc. The Project will provide CNY20,000 for the local residents to establish and conduct monitoring \nactivities.  \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, consultant \ninput, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nIt is expected that the following results will be achieved through the C&P: (i) increased participation of local population in the \nproject  implementation  and  monitoring,  (ii)  increased  awareness  of  project  benefits  and  acceptance  of  the  Project,  (iii) \nincreased hygiene knowledge and reduced incidence of waterborne and vector-borne diseases, and (iv) increased participation \nof beneficiaries affected by this Project. Furthermore, stakeholder consultation and disclosure of information will be conducted \nthrough  environment  management  plan,  resettlement  plan,  and  social  development  action  plan  during  the  project \nimplementation and operation.   \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \n\n \nWomen are often the ones who are more negatively impacted by water than men, as they take care of household chores and \nchildren.  The  health  benefit  would  be  greater  to  women,  the  elderly,  children,  and  the  poor  as  they  are  most  vulnerable  to \nstomachache  such    diseases.  Women,  with  more  chances  of  contact  with  water  from  domestic  chores,  will  benefit \ndisproportionately from the improvement of urban drainage faculties.  \n\n \nA target of 30% for women\u2019s employment in operation and maintenance of infrastructure has been set, plus an assurance from \nthe project managements office to encourage contractors to hire as much female construction labor as possible. Men stand to \nbenefit more than women from the unskilled construction jobs that will be created through the Project, due to the requirement \nfor  physically  demanding  labor.  However,  there  is  no  constraint  to  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  skilled  operation  and \nmaintenance work which will be created, as evidenced by the number of women already working in these sectors and the equal \nnumbers of male and female graduates with technical qualifications. There are also requirements for consultation with women \nin the resettlement plans. \n\n \n2.  Key  Actions.  Measures included in the design to promote  gender equality  and  women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nSummarize key  design features of the gender plan or other gender-related actions/measures, including performance targets, \nmonitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n\n \nAppropriate  participation  and  consultation  is  appreciated  by  women,  and  is  more  likely  to  lead  to  longer-term  support  and \nsuccess  of  the  technical  inputs.  Women  in  the  community  will  be  actively  engaged  for  the  public  education  and  awareness \nprogram to promote hygiene education, a garbage recycling program, and social acceptance of tariff increase. For the public \neducation and awareness program, the Project will work closely with local women\u2019s organization such as women association \nand  women\u2019s  street  committee.  The  short  resettlement  plan  and  environmental  management  plan  will  include  gender \ndisaggregated data, where relevant. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n62 \n\n \n \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\n \nLimited \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\n \nNo Impact \n\nLabor \n\nNo Impact \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\nAffordability \n\nLimited \n\nLimited \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict, political \n\ninstability, etc), please \nspecify \n\nIII.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n       Appendix 14 \n\n \n63\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\n1. \nThe  Qingdao  Water  Resources  and  Wetland  Protection  Project  consists  of  three  physical \nsubprojects: (i) Improvement of Flood Retention Project in Erli\u2019he Reservoir, (ii) Upgrading of Urban \nStorm-water and Wastewater Drainage Project, and (iii) River Course Rehabilitation Project. These \nsubprojects  will  not  only  increase  the  storage  capacity  of  reservoirs  and  enhance  the  flood \ndischarge  capacity  of  watercourses,  but  will  also  improve  the  drainage  system  and  control  the \nwatercourse pollution.  \n\n2. \nAccording  to  the  resettlement  investigation,  impacts  related  to  the  project  resettlement \ninclude (i) people affected by the permanent acquisition of land, (ii) people affected by permanent \noccupation  of  informal  farmland  along  the  river  banks,  and  (iii)  people  affected  by  the  temporary \noccupation of state-owned land. A total of 2.80 hectares (ha) of collective land will be acquired, of \nwhich 0.75 ha (26.8%) is farmland and 2.05 ha (73.2%) is pond; 15 households with 51 persons \nare  affected.  About  3.25  ha  of  informal  farmland  along  the  river  banks  or  inside  the  existing \nreservoirs/ponds  used  for  seasonal  crops  are  affected,  which  involves  60  households  with  212 \npersons.  Also,  9.93  ha  of  state  land  (i.e.,  roads,  sidewalks,  or  boulevards)  will  be  temporarily \noccupied  for  laying  wastewater  and  storm-water  pipelines.  There  is  no  demolition  of  residential \nhouses or shops, and there is no vulnerable or ethnic minority group involved in this Project (Table \nA14.1). Local officials, leaders from subdistricts and villages, and the affected persons were closely \nconsulted  during  the  feasibility  study  stage  in  order  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. \n \n\nTable A14.1: Summary of Resettlement Impacts \n\n \n\nName of \nSubproject \n\n \nName of \nSubproject \n\nPermanent \nLand \nAcquisition \n(mu)a \n\nTemporary \nCrops \nOccupation \n(mu) \n\nTemporary \nLand \nOccupation \n(m2) \n\n \nHousehold \nAffected \n\n \nPopulation \nAffected \n\nErli\u2019he Water \nRetention \nReservoir \nProject \n\nRiver Course \nRehabilitation \nProject \n\nThe pond of Area \n1 \nThe pond of Area \n2 \nThe pond of Area \n3 \n\nErli\u2019he River \n\nYunxi River \n\nHucheng River \n\nWushui River \n\nSanli River \n\n11.3 \n\nUrban \nSewage and \nDrainage \nProject \n\nWastewater \npipeline \nStormwater \npipeline \n\n30.8 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n5 \n\n0 \n\n41 \n\n0.2 \n\n1.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n63,889 \n\n35,419 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\n3 \n\n11 \n\n0 \n\n38 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\n11 \n\n42 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n73 \n\n  133 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n42.1 \n\n \n\n48.7 \n\n99,308 \n\n75 \n\n  263 \n\na   Fifteen Chinese \u201cmu\u201d equals 1 hectare. \n Source: Resettlement Plan by Jiaozhou city government, 2008. \n\n \n\n \n\nAs  the  resettlement  impacts  are  not  significant,  a  short  resettlement  plan  has  been \n3. \nprepared  on  the  basis  of  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB). All affected persons will be eligible for compensation and assistance. The cut-off date \nfor eligibility for compensation and assistance under the Project will be the date that the Jiaozhou \nmunicipal  government  approves  the  resettlement  plan,  and  will  be  announced  to  all  affected \n \n\n\f64 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\npersons  immediately  afterward.  Once  the  detailed  designs  of  the  subprojects  are  finalized,  the \nresettlement plan will be updated and submitted to ADB for approval. \n \n4. \nDue  diligence  was  required  for  the  previous  resettlement  impacts  caused  by  the \nconstruction of East Lake (Shaohai), since this is a part of the Project which was constructed prior \nto  ADB  involvement.  The  due-diligence  report  has  been  prepared  to  evaluate  the  resettlement \nresults, compensation and rehabilitation measures, and present conditions of the affected persons. \nThe due-diligence report shows that the compensation and rehabilitation measures are in line with \nnational and local policies on resettlement, and affected persons are satisfied with the resettlement \nactivities. There are no remaining issues on resettlement in the Shaohai East Lake Development \nProject. \n\n5. \nFor people who will be unavoidably affected by the Project, the resettlement objective is to \nachieve  equal  or  better  income  and  living  standards,  in  line  with  the  national  laws  and  local \nregulations, as well as ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Consulting with local governments \nand affected persons, the Jiaozhou city government (JCG) as the Executing Agency (EA) adopted \na set of compensation standards based on the replacement cost and general practice in the project \ndistricts  and  counties.  The  resettlement  principles  established  for  the  Project  are:  (i)  wherever \nfeasible,  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided  or  minimized  through  the \ndevelopment  of  design  alternatives  and  the  choice  of  the  best  alternative;  (ii)  compensation  and \nentitlements provided will be based on market value or replacement value and must be adequate \nto  allow  those  affected  to  maintain  or  improve  their  pre-project  standard  of  living;  (iii)  temporary \nland  occupancy  and  the  period  of  disruption  are  to  be  kept  to  a  minimum;  (iv)  all  the  people \naffected,  whether  legal  or  non-legal  residents,  are  to  be  taken  into  consideration  and  accounted \nfor;  (v)  where  the  landholding  per  capita  is  not  enough  to  maintain  the  previous  livelihood \nstandards,  other  income-generating  activities  will  be  provided  for;  (vi)  vulnerable  groups  will  be \ngiven preference in matters such as compensation and employment; (vii) all those affected will be \nadequately  informed  about  eligibility,  compensation  rates  and  standards,  livelihood  and  income \nrestoration plans,  and project  timing;  and  (viii) close  monitoring  and  timely  actions  will  be carried \nout to identify and resolve problems as they arise. The affected persons will be compensated and \nresettled  in a  timely  and  adequate manner  in  accordance with  the  resettlement  plan  so  that  they \nwill be made better off, or at least not worse off, than they would have been without the Project. \n\n6. \nWith regard to land acquisition, the compensation standard is determined by consulting with \nthe affected villages whose land will be acquired. Land compensation for farmland is 10 times of \nthe average annual output value,1 and resettlement subsidy for farmland is 14 times the average \nannual  output  value.  A  land  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidy  will  be  paid  to  the  affected \nvillage  committees,  while  young  crops  compensation  will  be  paid  to  individuals.  To  restore  the \nincome losses, the following measures will be implemented during the resettlement process: (i) the \nvillage  committee  will  adjust  the  remaining  land  within  the  whole  villages;  (ii)  the  land \ncompensation and resettlement subsidy will be deposited in banks for income earnings or welfare \nfrom interest, such as distributing rice, flour, and  edible oil to all villagers; (iii) land compensation \nwill  be  used  for  basic  social  insurance  for  the  land-lost  farmers;  (iv)  secondary  and  tertiary \nindustries  will  be  developed  or  expanded  to  generate  employment  opportunities  and  recover  the \nincome of the affected persons, and technical training will be provided to the affected persons to \nteach them nonagricultural skills; and (v) the project EA will give the affected persons priority to be \nemployed in the activities during the project construction and operation. \n\nWith  regard  to  the  loss  of  access  to  informal  farmland  which  does  not  legally  belong  to \n7. \nfarmers,  the  affected  persons  will  be  informed  6  months  prior  to  civil  works  to  stop  planting \ntemporary crops along the river banks, or paid one-season young crops compensation. Moreover, \n                                                 \n1 The average annual output value of 2005, 2006, and 2007 is CNY1,600/mu in the affected areas, as per the Jiaozhou \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStatistical Bureau. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n       Appendix 14 \n\n \n65\n\nskill training programs and employment will be provided for family laborers to help integrate these \naffected persons into urban society. \n \n8. \nFor  businesses  or  residents  that  may  be  temporarily  affected  or  inconvenienced  by  the \nconstruction of the wastewater and storm-water network, mitigation measures are also provided to \navoid or minimize the potential impacts during the construction period. Most construction impacts \nwill last less than 1 month; if impacts last longer, compensation will be negotiated between the EA \nand  the  affected  businesses  or  residents.  Other  mitigation  measures,  such  as  disclosing \nconstruction  information,  setting  warning  signs,  and  prohibiting  construction  schedules,  will  be \nimplemented. \n\n9. \nThe JCG, as the EA, will assume the overall responsibility for resettlement. The Jiaozhou \nproject  management  office  (PMO)  will  take  charge  of  resettlement  compensation  payment  and \nsupervision. The PMO will also coordinate the planning, implementation, financing, and reporting of \nland acquisition and resettlement progress to ADB. \n \n10. \nThe cost of land acquisition and resettlement is included in the overall budget of the Project, \nwhich is estimated to be CNY2.8 million. The project owners will pay compensation and other fees \nto  the  affected  villages  and  individuals  through  the  PMO  with  domestic  counterpart  capital.  To \nensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  can  be  finished  successfully,  the  PMO  has  set  up \nvarious financial and supervising organizations for funds management at different levels. \n\n11. \nThe  affected  persons  were  fully  consulted  and  informed  during  the  preparation  of  the \nresettlement plan. Local representatives participated in planning meetings, interviews, focus group \ndiscussions, public consultation workshops, and community consultations, and their comments and \nconcerns are integrated into the resettlement plan. The draft resettlement plan was distributed to \nthe  affected  subdistricts  and  villages  in  July  2008,  and  resettlement  information  booklets  were \ndisseminated  to  the  affected  villages  and  affected  persons  on  3  September  2008.  The  grievance \nredress procedures are well established; they are explained in the resettlement plan and referred \nto in the resettlement information booklets. \n \n12. \nThe resettlement plan implementation will be subject to internal and external monitoring, as \ndescribed  in  the  resettlement  plan.  The  EA  will  supervise  the  implementation  and  monitor  the \nprogress  quarterly  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plan.  Each \nresettlement  agency  within  the  EA  will  undergo  capacity  building  during  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement; the resettlement staff training programs and budgets are included in the resettlement \nplan.  The  PMO  will  entrust  an  independent  agency  with  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  activities  twice  a  year,  and  external  monitoring  reports  will  be \nforwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n\nThe resettlement implementation schedule is based on the overall project preparation and \n13. \nconstruction timetable. The process of land acquisition is scheduled to begin in the second half of \n2009  and  be  completed  by  the  end  of  the  year.  Before  land  acquisition,  the  detailed  land \nacquisition plan and agreements required under the PRC regulations will be approved by Jiaozhou \nLand  Resources  Bureau,  after  negotiation  with  and  acceptance  by  the  affected  persons.  If  there \nare  any  significant  changes  in  land  acquisition,  resettlement  impacts,  or  entitlement,  the \nresettlement  plan  for  this  Project  will  be  updated  to  reflect  the  changes,  and  the  changes  will  be \ndisclosed to the affected persons and submitted to ADB for approval before land is acquired or civil \nworks commence. The PMO and EA have agreed on a set of supervision milestones with ADB for \ntimely and effective resettlement (Table A14.2).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nDisclosure \n\nTable A14.2: Resettlement Supervision Milestones \n\nNo. \n\nResettlement Tasks \n\nTarget \n\nResponsible Agency \n\nDeadline \n\nStatus  \n\nInformation booklet to APs \n\n75 households PMO \n\nResettlement plan distribution  \n\n30 copies \n\nSubdistrict Office \n\nRP placed on ADB website \n\nRP \n\nADB \n\nB. \n\nResettlement Plan and Budget \n\nApproval of feasibility study  \n\nall \nsubprojects \n\nQingdao City Gov\u2019t, \ndesign institutes \n\nApproval of RP and budget \n\nCNY2.8million  Jiaozhou Government \n\n3 Sept 2008  complete\n\nJuly\u2013Sept \n2008 \n\ncomplete\n\n5 Sept 2008  complete\n\n27 Aug \n2008 \n14 July \n2008 \n\ncomplete\n\ncomplete\n\nApproval of compensation rates \n\nJiaozhou Government \n\nJuly 2008 \n\ncomplete\n\nC. \n\nDetailed Rehabilitation Plans \n\nVillage rehabilitation plans  \n\n2 villages  \n\nVillages, Subdistrict \nOffice, PMO \n\nMay 2009 \n\nFarmland adjustment agreements \n\n1 village  \n\nAffected village \n\nMay 2009 \n\nTechnical training plan for APs \n\nall APs \n\nSubdistrict Office \n\nMay 2009 \n\nDetailed Design and RP Updating \n\nDetailed design for components \n\nDesign institute \n\nMay 2009 \n\nStaking survey and Detailed \nMeasurement Survey (DMS) \n\nUpdated RP based on DMS, including \nplans in item 3 above  \n\nLand use approval \n\n41.2 mu \n\nCompensation Agreements \n\nJiaozhou Land Resources \nBureau, towns and \nvillages \n\nPMO, EA \n\nQingdao Land and \nResources Bureau \n\nVillage agreements \n\n2 villages \n\nSubdistrict Office \n\nHousehold agreements \n\n15 HHs \n\nSubdistrict Office \n\nImplementation Capacity \n\nJune 2009 \n\n30 June \n2009 \n\nJuly 2009 \n\nJuly 2009 \n\nJuly 2009 \n\nSubdistrict Office resettlement staff \n\n2 villages \n\nSubdistrict Office \n\nApril 2009 \n\nDesignate village representatives \n\n20 persons \n\nSubdistrict Office \n\nApril 2009 \n\nTraining of staff \n\nPMO, subdistrict office \n\nApril 2009 \n\nSetting up grievance redress \n\nPMO, Subdistricts \n\nApril 2009 \n\nall staff \n\n15 staff \n\nG.
