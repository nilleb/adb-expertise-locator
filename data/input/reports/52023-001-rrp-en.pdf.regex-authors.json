THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Henan Dengzhou Integrated River Restoration and \nEcological Protection Project. \n \n2.  The project will help the Dengzhou City Government (DCG) restore the Tuan River \necosystem and improve water services with a well-balanced mix of structural and nonstructural \ninterventions, leading to environmental sustainability and improved livelihoods. The project will \nadopt an integrated approach to enhance rural and urban water links that addresses a complex \nenvironmental problem in rapidly developing societies therefore serves as a demonstration model \nfor the PRC and beyond. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) is one of the three key economic growth \nengines in the PRC. Its nine provinces and two specially administered municipalities account for \nmore than 40% of the PRC\u2019s population, 40% of its freshwater resources, and about 45% of \neconomic output. While the YREB has benefited from extensive development since the 1980s, \neconomic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin lags that of the \ncoastal areas. These parts of the YREB still face significant challenges as a result of (i) weak \ninstitutional coordination for strategic planning; (ii) increasing pollution and pressure on natural \nresources; (iii) slow transformation to green development; and (iv) limited integration of waterways, \nports, and intermodal logistics. To manage these challenges, the Government of the PRC \nformulated  the  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt  Development  Plan,  2016\u20132030.1 The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the government have agreed to adopt a framework approach to \nstrategically program ADB\u2019s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB.2 Priority is \ngiven to (i) institutional strengthening and policy reform; (ii) ecosystem restoration, environmental \nprotection, and management of water resources; (iii) inclusive green industrial transformation; \nand (iv) construction of an integrated multimodal transport corridor. \n \n4.  Rural livelihoods in the YREB have lagged industrial production and urban livelihoods. As \na result, income inequality and poverty persist in rural areas of the less-developed middle and \nupper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin. Most rural wastewater and solid waste is discharged \ndirectly to the water system without treatment and proper disposal.3 As the rural economy \nexpands, increasing regulatory, administrative, and environmental management challenges will \nrequire stronger institutional capacity. Against this background, the government formulated the \nNational Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022 to promote poverty reduction, rural \ndevelopment,  and  green  and  inclusive  growth.4 The  rural  vitalization  strategy  focuses  on \ngovernance  reform,  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management,  rural\u2013urban  integration, \n \n1  Government of the PRC. 2016.

Manila. \n3  In 2017, only 25% of villages had appropriate sanitation facilities and only 60% had solid waste collection and \ndisposal services, contributing to poor environmental conditions. In 2015, the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 \nmandated the installation of sanitation systems in at least 70% of the rural villages in the country by 2020 \n(Government of the PRC. 2016. Outline of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132020. Beijing). \n4  Government of the PRC. 2018. National Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022. Beijing. \n ", "2 \necosystem protection, and rural development. The strategy prioritizes managing climate change \nand the environment to support ecological civilization and rural vitalization. \n \n5.  Project area. Dengzhou, a county-level city in Nanyang City, Henan Province, is poor and \nrelatively rural. It has weak institutional capacity in environmental management and is strategically \nlocated at the sources of South\u2013North Water Diversion Project.5 As part of the Han River \nwatershed in the Yangtze River Basin, Dengzhou City is a national key ecological function zone, \nas designated by the government. With 28 townships and 606 villages, the city has an area of \n2,369 square kilometers and had a population of 1.78 million people in 2018, of which 60% are \nrural. The project area covers the townships and villages along the Tuan River, a tributary of the \nHan River in Dengzhou City. In 2018, most of the city\u2019s 32,465 poor people (with an annual per \ncapita income of less than CNY3,208) were low-paid women. The Tuan River Basin has (i) a per \ncapita freshwater availability of only 345 cubic meters (m3) per year (less than 13% of the national \naverage), (ii) the lowest water supply coverage that relies on polluted groundwater, and (iii) the \nhighest disposal rate of untreated wastewater and solid wastes. Located in Henan Province, an \necological red-line area, Dengzhou City is part of a cluster of cities and counties surrounding the \nYREB that significantly contribute to the YREB\u2019s development goals.6 \n \n6.  Poor water quality. Almost 100% of Dengzhou City\u2019s rural population and 30% of its \nurban  population  lacks proper  access to  water,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste management \nfacilities. This results in poor health and creates heavy burden particularly for women, who play a \nmajor role in household water and waste management in the city. Despite experiencing an acute \nwater scarcity, the city, as a source of water diversion project, helps resolve the water scarcity \nproblems in the water-deprived northern region of the PRC. About 143,000 of the city\u2019s rural \npopulation relies for their drinking water supply on shallow groundwater that is contaminated by \nthe heavily polluted Tuan River, untreated wastes, and chemical fertilizers used extensively on \nfarmland. The city\u2019s groundwater quality is far below national standards.7 From 2008 to 2018, \nthere were 300,000 cases of waterborne diseases, affecting mainly women and children.8 The \nTuan River is heavily polluted from point sources, including 6 million m3 of wastewater, and \n300,000 tons of garbage directly disposed into the river annually; and nonpoint sources, mainly \nfrom farmlands; and water quality exceeds class V (the worst on the scale) in almost every section \nof the lower Tuan River.9 \n \n7.  Impaired water ecosystem services. The untreated wastewater and accumulated solid \nwaste in the Tuan River have severely impacted the aquatic life and impaired the entire water \necosystem.  The river\u2019s hydrology,  water  environment,  and  geomorphology  have  also  been \nsubstantially altered by water operation, urbanization, and climate change impacts, resulting in a \ndegraded river corridor environment. Serious riverbank erosion has progressively damaged the \nproductive farmlands. The undercutting of the riverbank and accumulation of construction wastes \nin various sections of the river have also exacerbated the degradation of the water environment \nand damaged the riverfront design in the urban area. Further, several of the city\u2019s natural wetlands \nand drainage channels, including small creeks of hydrological, environmental, and historical \nsignificance, have disappeared since 2010. The frequency of floods is on the rise because of \nmorphological changes, urbanization on the floodplain, and climatic variability, therefore likely to \n \n5  South\u2013North Water Diversion Project. http://www.china.org.cn/waterdiversion/index.htm. \n6  In 2015, PRC formulated a national policy, mandating local governments to establish ecosystems services \nassessments in land use planning, which is known as ecological redline policy. \n7  Government of the PRC. 2007. National Drinking Water Quality Standard (GB 5749-2006). Beijing. \n8  Dengzhou City Government. 2018. Statistical Yearbook. Dengzhou City. \n9  Above class III water is unfit for drinking according to the PRC\u2019s Environmental Water Quality Standard (GB 3838-2002). \n \n ", "3 \npose a serious problem for the city. The 30-kilometer (km) river profile in the city is fully eutrophic, \nand the resulting persistent foul odor has impaired the living environment along the river reach.10 \n \n8.  Weak institution and capacity to manage water resources. Since beginning operations \nin late 2014, the water diversion project has allocated 692 million m3 of free of charge water to \nDengzhou City each year, of which only about 15% has been used because of a lack of proper \nplanning and limited water resource management capacity. The DCG adopted various measures \nto protect the river environment and improve the livelihood of the people, but it could not deliver \nthe expected results because of inadequate problem analysis, fragmented management of water \nand ecosystem services, and poor planning and design without proper stakeholder participation. \nLack of asset management in the DCG has substantially increased the risk of poor public services \nand unforeseen costs in development investments. Located at the headstream of the water \ndiversion project, the city faces restrictions on development mainly because water quality and \nquantity in the Danjiangkou Reservoir is being degraded.11 To ensure sound environmental \nmanagement and protection of the reservoir, the DCG receives eco-compensation annually from \nthe Beijing Municipal Government as an incentive, but this has not been used properly.12  \n9.  Given the competing needs for soil and water conservation and rural livelihood development \nin this unique ecosystem, an integrated watershed management is required with strong database. \nTo  establish  a  fair  compensation  mechanism,  a  performance-based  approach  with  proper \nmonitoring and evaluation of outcomes and financial rewards or penalty provisions also needs to \nbe developed with the involvement of the DCG and the cities that benefit from the water diversion \nproject. To do this, the DCG needs to strengthen its institutional and operational capacities. \n \n10.  Rural\u2013urban water links. Complex and poorly managed rural\u2013urban water links have \ndirect implications on rural and urban livelihoods, and the Tuan River environment. For example, \nuntreated sewage from the urban area on the right bank of the river is discharged directly into the \nTuan River, where it recharges the groundwater that is the only source of drinking water in the \nrural area on the left bank. Similarly, poor sanitation and solid waste management in the rural \nvillages, and the use of chemical fertilizer and pesticides on the farmlands, contaminate the \ngroundwater and damage the river environment and the river front design of the urban area. Urban \nencroachment into the river corridor and disposal of construction wastes into the river have \nresulted in river sedimentation leading to the water contamination and frequent flooding in rural \nvillages 30 km downstream.  \n11.  The DCG urgently needs to address these links by improving its water management \nstrategy and plan and strengthening its institutional and technical capacities to achieve the goals. \nLocated in a less-developed region in the middle of Yangtze River Basin, the city can demonstrate \nan environmentally sustainable growth model for addressing the rural\u2013urban water links that can \nbe replicated in other parts of the river basin and the PRC. \n \n10 Eutrophication is the process by which excessive nutrients accumulate in a water body causing dense plant growth \nand animal death from lack of dissolved oxygen. \n11 The reservoir of the water diversion project, constructed in the 1950s, has a surface area of 1,050 square kilometers; \nstorage capacity of 29.05 cubic kilometers; and a watershed area of 95,200 square kilometers. Besides irrigation, \nflood control, and hydropower generation, it also supplies water through a 1,274 km stretch of canal to 14 cities in \nthe northern PRC, benefiting more than 50 million people in the water-deprived cities of Beijing and Tianjin, and the \nprovinces of Hebei and Henan under the water diversion project. \n12 The eco-compensation includes CNY278 million in direct cash payments, CNY340 million for capacity building in \nenvironmental protection, medical coverage and education for affected populations, and free use of 692 million m3 \nof water from the water diversion project for various uses. The amount is part of the city government\u2019s annual budget \nand there is no proper accounting provision for the compensation fund by source and area. \n \n ", "4 \n12.  Strategic  fit.  Under  the  rural  vitalization  plan  (footnote  4),  local  governments  will \nimplement their own plans to improve rural public services and the environment. The DCG has \nformulated its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, consistent with the national Thirteenth Five-\nYear Plan, 2016\u20132020.13 In addition to local development plans, the project is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030, especially the operational priority areas of tackling climate change, building \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; promoting rural development and \nfood security; and making cities more livable.14 It is also closely aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, particularly the three major principles of managing \nclimate change and environment, supporting inclusive economic growth, and fostering knowledge \ncooperation.15 It is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, which emphasizes \nintegrated water resources management (IWRM) with a focus on rural water management;16 and \nSustainable Development Goals 6, 11, and 13.17 The project also supports ADB\u2019s new action plan \nfor healthy oceans by reducing the amount of solid waste discharged into the Yangtze River and \neventually the sea.18 The project will contribute to the fulfillment of the Paris Agreement that the \nPRC signed in 2015, and is aligned with the PRC\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions \nto limit carbon emissions by 2030.19 \n \n13.  Lessons learned. The project will implement IWRM focusing on rural\u2013urban integration \nto improve rural livelihoods and the Tuan River environment in Dengzhou City. The project design \nhas incorporated lessons from previous ADB-financed projects and policy-oriented studies on \nIWRM, environmental and ecosystem improvement, wetland and lake management, and rural\u2013\nurban integration in the PRC and other developing member countries. Past and ongoing ADB \nsupport in the PRC underscore the importance of (i) strengthening nature-based solutions and \ncommunity engagement; (ii) ensuring operation and maintenance (O&M) provisions include \nsustainable sources of finance; (iii) using high-level technologies in IWRM, including in decision-\nmaking;  (iv)  introducing  institutional  and  financial  management  reforms  that  contribute  to \nsustainable water resources management; (v) developing capacity for project implementation and \nO&M; and (vi) instituting an effective project monitoring and evaluation system.20 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: quality of life along YREB improved.21 The \nproject  will  have  the  following  outcome:  water  security  and  environmental  sustainability  in \nDengzhou City improved.22 \n \n \n13 Government of the PRC. 2016.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The implementing agencies\u2019 domestic feasibility studies are technically sound, meet \ninternational standards, and provide sufficient information on the design\u2019s feasibility. Licensed \ndomestic  design  institutes  prepared  all  project  components,  considering  local  geophysical, \nsocioeconomic, and hydrometeorological conditions, as well as anticipated climate change risks \n(rated medium), in accordance with PRC design guidelines and local regulations. The project \nconsidered technical alternatives, such as (i) a centralized or decentralized water supply system, \n(ii) a general inspection or automatic acoustic system to detect water leakage in the water supply \ndistribution network, (iii) centralized or distributed wastewater treatment plants, (iv) mechanical or \necological river dredging, (v) concrete lining or gabion wall for erosion control, and (vi) continuous \nor discontinuous dike for flood control, and their technical and economic viability. It also (i) \ndeliberated ways to promote rural\u2013urban water links to improve the water quality and hydrological \ncycle, (ii) carried out a demand projection to determine the size and scale of each project \ncomponent, (iii) promoted the use of information and communication technology in IWRM, and \n(iv) optimized the timescales for project implementation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 13.2% and an economic net present value of CNY1,008.0 \nmillion. The analysis also confirmed the economic viability of all subprojects.26 Sensitivity analysis \nindicated that the project is robust to the negative scenarios examined, such as an increase in \ninvestment costs, a reduction in benefits, and an increase in O&M costs. The full economic \nbenefits of the project are expected to be significantly higher, as some effects, such as ecological \nbenefits, are not easily quantifiable.  \n26.  The financial analysis included financial viability assessments for revenue-generating \ncomponents, an assessment of the project\u2019s financial sustainability, and an assessment of the \nfinancial  capacity  of  the  DCG.  For  revenue-generating  components,  project  revenues  are \nsufficient to cover all recurrent costs. Financial sustainability considered the fiscal impact of \ncounterpart funding for the project; incremental recurrent costs, including O&M expenditures; and \ndebt service for the project. The DCG derives on average 70% of funding from the provincial \ngovernment. While the analysis confirmed the financial sustainability of the project, the DCG\u2019s \nreliance on provincial government budgetary allocations poses a substantial risk to financial \nsustainability because of possible changes in budgetary allocations by the upper government. \nThe project includes adequate mitigation measures, including assurances for continued O&M \nsupport and for increases in water and wastewater tariffs for full O&M cost recovery, as well as \noperational efficiency enhancements through improvements to asset management systems. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  The assessed financial management risk is moderate mainly because of the DCG\u2019s lack \nof familiarity with ADB\u2019s financial management policies and procedures. The executing agency\u2019s \nfinancial  staff  capacity,  accounting,  reporting  systems,  and  internal  and  external  audit \narrangements  are  adequate.  Further,  the  DCG\u2019s  financial  management  capacity  under  the \n \n26 The subprojects\u2019 economic internal rates of return range from 9.1% to 15.6%. \n \n ", "9 \nguidance of the Henan Provincial Government, which is familiar with development partner funded \nproject management, will be adequate for effective financial management of the project.27 The \nassessment recommended a time-bound action plan, which the DCG will implement during the \nproject period, to mitigate the identified financial management risks.  \n28.  The procurement risk assessment confirmed that the DCG, supported by the project \nmanagement office, has adequate capacity to implement the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time), despite its lack of experience with internationally financed projects. All \nprocurement will be organized through an experienced procurement agent and the project \nmanagement  and  capacity  development  consultants  will  provide  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement support to project management office throughout the project implementation.  \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Dengzhou City Government. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  The project is classified general intervention for poverty reduction. The project preparation \nteam in close coordination with DCG undertook the poverty and social analysis based on intensive \nstakeholder  consultations  and  socioeconomic  surveys.  It  indicated  that  a  total  of  746,000 \nresidents in 11 project towns, including 13,137 poor people, will directly benefit from the project \nthrough reduced water pollution, improved drinking water supply system, and better environment \nand ecological protection in the Tuan River watershed. Other residents in Dengzhou City will also \nbenefit indirectly from improved environment and ecology. The project will create 3,000 jobs \nduring project implementation and 150 jobs during operation.  The DCG prepared a social \ndevelopment action plan based on the poverty and social analysis, with specific targets for the \npoor and low-income people. The DCG consulted with local residents and other stakeholders \nduring the project preparation. The PAM includes a consultation and participation plan for the \nproject implementation stage (footnote 25). \n \n31.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nGender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.28 The project will ensure that women will \nparticipate in and benefit equitably from the project. Women are expected to benefit from \nincreased employment, piped water supply in rural areas, improved living environment, and better \nquality of life. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared based on gender analyses to ensure \ngender equality. The GAP includes the following key measures and targets for women: (i) \nequitable participation of women in decision-making, with women making up at least 40% of \nparticipants; (ii) capacity building of staff of the DCG to implement the GAP and related measures; \n(iii) priority employment opportunities for women, with women making up at least 30% employees \nduring construction and at least 40% during operation; (iv) participation of women in awareness-\nraising activities and public hearings, with participants comprising at least 40% women; (v) \nparticipation of women in decision-making for the pilot community-based solid waste management \nprogram, with at least 40% female membership of community groups; and (vi) ensuring women \nemployees\u2019 equitable access to sanitation and health education (such as HIV/AIDS awareness) \nduring construction. Gender targets are included in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n27 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) was conducted in \nJanuary 2019. \n28 ADB. 2012.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.29 \n \n33.  Environment (category B). The project preparation team in close coordination with DCG \nundertook an initial environmental examination, including an environmental management plan \n(EMP) and grievance redress mechanism, following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \ndisclosed it on ADB\u2019s website. The initial environmental examination is based on the approved \ndomestic  feasibility  studies,  environmental  assessment  reports,  site  visits,  and  stakeholder \nconsultations. The outcomes of the stakeholder consultations have been integrated in the project \ndesign, including works for heritage preservation. The project team conducted due diligence for \nan associated facility, a small shallow reservoir, for which operational and safety plans have been \nprepared consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements for dams. The DCG, \nthrough the project management office, will be responsible for implementation and compliance \nwith the EMP, including for mitigation measures, monitoring, and reporting. Loan implementation \nconsultants and a capacity-building program are included in the project design. \n \n34.  The project will contribute to municipal targets for environmental improvement, including \nimproved flood control, reduced siltation, and improved solid waste management. Construction \nrisks include the potential release of contaminants from polluted sediments during dredging or \ndisposal, and short-term impacts such as dust and noise. Operational risks include altered river \nhydrology, river pollution from treated wastewater, and inadequate O&M of the project facilities. \nMitigation measures are described in the EMP. The project will contribute to climate change \nadaptation and mitigation by (i) increasing the resilience of the flood defense and environmental \nprotection infrastructure in accordance with anticipated climate impacts through careful selection \nof materials and locations, and (ii) sequestering carbon through the revegetation components. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project will permanently occupy 479.43 \nhectares (ha) of land, of which 346.03 ha is existing state-owned land and 133.4 ha is collective \nland that will be acquired. A total of 793 households with 3,023 persons will be affected by the \nproject\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement impacts; 525 households with 1,841 persons will be \nphysically relocated; and 196.87 ha of land will be used temporarily during construction. The DCG \nhas prepared a resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nrelevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  PRC.  The  plan  includes  adequate  measures  for \ncompensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation of affected people. The plan is based on surveys \nand consultations with affected people during project preparation and will be further updated \nthrough additional surveys and consultations during project implementation. A grievance redress \nmechanism has been established and incorporated into the resettlement plan. The DCG has the \ncapacity to implement domestically funded projects, and its capacity will be strengthened by the \nproject consultants to implement the resettlement plan in compliance with ADB requirements. An \nexternal monitoring agency will be engaged to monitor the implementation of the resettlement \nplan and will submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Eight villages in the project area include members of \nthe Hui ethnic minority group. While the ethnic minorities are integrated into mainstream society \nin terms of socioeconomic and livelihood systems, they have distinct religious and cultural beliefs \nand practices. Therefore,  indigenous peoples\u2019 safeguards are triggered; and the DCG has \nprepared an ethnic minority development plan to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit equitably \n \n29 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "11 \nand in a culturally appropriate manner from the project. The plan was prepared based on social \nanalysis and consultations during project preparation. The project executing and implementing \nagencies have experience in working on ethnic minority affairs, and necessary measures for \nstrengthening their capacity for implementation and monitoring the plan have been included in \nthe project design. \n \nF.
