THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Henan Sustainable Livestock Farming and \nProduct Safety Demonstration Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  aims  to  demonstrate  model  livestock  production  and  processing  with \nimproved environmental sustainability and product safety in nine project counties in Henan \nProvince.2 The project will help (i) the Henan Provincial Government (HPG) upgrade livestock \nproduct safety monitoring and inspection facilities; and (ii) nine medium- and large-sized private \nlivestock production and/or processing enterprises, or project participating enterprises (PPEs),3 \nimprove food safety control and implement environmentally sustainable livestock production and \nprocessing.4 Henan is suitable for the demonstration given the province\u2019s strategic importance \nin food security and agriculture in the PRC. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Henan Province covers a large part of the fertile North China Plain, with a population of \n104.89 million; 62.34 million people (59.4%) live in rural areas, where the poverty rate is 13.1%. \nAgriculture has traditionally been an important part of Henan Province\u2019s economy, contributing \n12.7% of the provincial gross domestic product and 41.8% of the total labor force in 2012. \nHenan Province is also known for its significant contribution to national food security, with the \nPRC\u2019s highest output of wheat, second-highest output of rice, and second-highest livestock \nproduction in value in 2012. \n \n4.  With  economic  growth  and  increasing  household  incomes,  consumption  of  animal \nprotein-based food, particularly meat products, has also increased in the PRC. During 1978\u2013\n2012, per capita meat consumption doubled in urban and more than tripled in rural areas,5 with \nfurther growth in consumption expected. Food safety awareness is rising, and consumers are \ndemanding  properly  processed  meat  products  with  adequate  labeling.  Livestock  sector \ndevelopment in the PRC is necessitated by fast-growing domestic demand for high-quality meat \nproducts that are trusted by food safety-conscious consumers. \n \n5.  The Government of the PRC faces tremendous pressure in ensuring sufficient supply of \nhigh-quality meat products to meet the domestic demand; this is complicated by increasingly \nchallenging  resource  constraints,  including  a  decline  in  the  active  rural  labor  force;  and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The nine project counties comprise (i) Gushi County, (ii) Lainyuan County of Shanqiu Municipality, (iii) Luoning \nCounty of Luoyang Municipality, (iv)\u2013(v) Neixiang and Xinye counties of Nanyang Municipality, (vi) Shanxian \nCounty of Sanmenxia Municipality, (vii)\u2013(viii) Xuchang and Yanling counties of Xuchang Municipality, and (ix) \nZhengyang County of Zhumadian Municipality. \n3  Those PPEs were selected based on criteria chosen by HPG. The selection criteria and process are summarized \nin Annex 4 of the project administration manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The \nnine PPEs comprise (i) four cattle farming enterprises, two of which have processing capacity; (ii) three pig farming \nenterprises, two of which have processing capacity; and (iii) two poultry farming enterprises, both of which have \nprocessing capacity. \n4  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Henan Value Chain \nand Products Safety Demonstration Project (TA 8352-PRC). \n5  G. Zhou, et al. 2012. China\u2019s meat industry revolution: Challenges and opportunities for the future. Meat Science. \n92 (3), pp.188\u2013196. Elsevier. \n ", "2 \ndegradation and reduction in the quantity of arable land and water. The national government \nproposes to address these challenges by upgrading to intensive and modernized livestock \nproduction and processing systems; but this faces two major challenges: (i) ensuring the safety \nof livestock and meat products, and (ii) addressing pollution from livestock waste. \n \n6.  During the Twelfth Five-Year Plan period (2011\u20132015), the national government has \nmade  significant  progress  in  food  safety  management  to  control  recurrent  food  safety \nincidents\u2014by increasing cohesion in government food safety supervision, unifying food safety \nstandards, and increasing noncompliance penalties.6 The national government issued the first \ncomprehensive Food Safety Law (FSL) in 2009, which is being further revised. The FSL and \nrelevant  regulations  stipulate  that  (i)  local  governments  have  overall  responsibility  for  the \nsupervision and management of food safety in their jurisdiction; and (ii) food producers and \ntraders are responsible for strict compliance with the FSL, relevant regulations, and food safety \nstandards. \n \n7.  Although  HPG  has  been  upgrading  its  food  safety  infrastructure,  procedures,  and \nenforcement  capacity,  the  substantial  improvements  needed  for  full  compliance  with  the \nstrengthened food safety regulations have yet to be made. Provincial governments are required \nto  improve  hazard  risk  assessment  as  part  of  their  existing  monitoring  and  inspection \nresponsibility, while lower-level government administrations are required to be equipped with \nrapid screening and testing capacity to enhance their sampling and inspection efficiency. Food \nproducers, particularly agro-enterprises, are required to have adequate quality control and self-\ntesting capacity. As a major food producer for the PRC, Henan Province needs to further \nimprove  food  safety  management\u2014particularly  of  meat  and  other  livestock  products\u2014\nundertaken by HPG, local governments, and food producers, which poses challenges because \nof the complex supply chain. \n \n8.  The  expansion  of  the  intensive  livestock  production  has  significant  negative \nenvironmental impacts. The waste produced by the livestock farms and enterprises contains \nhigh concentrations of pollutants, and is often discharged without proper treatment, resulting in \nserious land and water pollution; and threats to public safety. In 2010, only 36.5% of the large-\nscale livestock farms in Henan Province met the PRC\u2019s environmental standards for waste \ndischarge and control.7 Livestock waste also causes significant greenhouse gas emissions. The \nnational  government  has  promoted  production  of  renewable  energy  using  livestock  waste, \nparticularly for medium- and large-scale livestock farms and enterprises; but many lack proper \nwaste treatment facilities. The reluctance of livestock enterprises to invest in waste treatment \nfacilities and the national government\u2019s weak enforcement  of environmental laws  makes it \ndifficult to address this negative environmental impact. \n \n9.  The  project  supports  the  long-term  goal  of  building  a  harmonious  and  moderately \nprosperous  society  through  livelihood  improvement,  and  regionally  balanced  and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth in the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015).8 It also \nsupports the national government\u2019s renewed commitment to food safety system improvement \nand sustainable environmental and natural resources management in the third plenum of the \n                                                \n6  S.

The project will also complement ADB\u2019s technical assistance on National Food Safety \nRegulatory and Strategic Framework and build upon lessons learned from previous projects in \nHenan Province, which include the effectiveness of medium-term financing for agro-enterprises \nand  farmers,  cooperation  mechanisms  between  agro-enterprises  and  farmers,  and  the \nimportance of capacity building.12 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be (i) upgraded agricultural industrialization and large-scale operation, (ii) \nenhanced  capacity  in  ensuring  agro-product  quality  and  safety,  and  (iii)  strengthened \nconservation of agricultural resources and ecosystems. The outcome will be demonstration of \nmodel  livestock  production  and  processing  with  improved  environmental  sustainability  and \nproduct safety. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The outputs will be (i) upgraded livestock product safety monitoring and inspection \nfacilities, (ii) establishment of environmentally sustainable livestock production facilities, and (iii) \nstrengthened capacity and project management. \n \n13.  Output 1: Upgraded livestock product safety monitoring and inspection facilities. \nThis output will support HPG\u2019s effort to improve the livestock and feed product safety monitoring \nand inspection system by (i) helping the Henan Animal Husbandry Bureau (HAHB), five project \nmunicipal animal husbandry bureaus (MAHBs),13 and nine project county animal husbandry \nbureaus (CAHBs) upgrade and/or establish laboratories and provide testing equipment;14 (ii) \nhelping  PPEs  upgrade  and/or  establish  in-house  testing  facilities  for  livestock  and  feed \nproducts; and (iii) providing information technology equipment and software for HAHB, MAHBs, \nCAHBs, and the PPEs to establish a laboratory information management system, which will \ncomplement the comprehensive livestock information platform and traceability system being \nfinanced by HPG. This output, together with relevant training activities of output 3, will help HPG \n                                                \n9  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2013.

Output  2:  Establishment  of  environmentally  sustainable  livestock  production \nfacilities. This output will promote environmental sustainability and energy conservation in \nlivestock  production  and  processing.  The  project  will  help  the  PPEs  establish  (i)  livestock \nproduction and meat processing facilities; (ii) feed processing facilities; and (iii) in-house animal \nwaste and wastewater treatment and/or processing facilities, including biogas generators and \norganic fertilizer processing facilities. These facilities will be equipped with energy- and water-\nsaving technologies. The output is expected to generate significant environmental benefits, \nincluding  avoided  greenhouse  gas  emissions;  and  employment  and  income-generating \nopportunities at the PPEs for local people and farmers who supply livestock, raw materials, and \nother inputs to the PPEs, and/or receive organic fertilizer from the PPEs. \n \n15.  Output 3: Strengthened capacity and project management. This output will comprise \ncapacity-development activities and project management. The project will provide (i) training on \nlivestock  product  safety  for  HAHB  and  the  MAHBs,  CAHBs,  and  PPEs;  (ii)  training  on \nenvironmentally sustainable livestock production and processing for the PPEs and associated \nfarmers from which the PPEs source their livestock;15 (iii) training on project management for \nproject management offices (PMOs) of five project municipal governments and nine county \ngovernments, HAHB, the PPEs, and other relevant government agencies; and (iv) oversea and \ndomestic study tours and training.16 Under this output, the project will help the PPEs establish \nhazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) and/or HACCP-based food quality control \nsystems, such as the China Good Agricultural Practices. The training will also cover animal \nwelfare  and  health,  such  as  appropriate  use  of  animal  medicines  as  part  of  International \nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 requirements. The project will also provide office \nequipment for project management. A project implementation consultant team, which will be \nfinanced by HPG, will assist (i) the provincial PMO in managing project implementation and \norganizing  training  on  project  management  and  environmentally  sustainable  livestock \nproduction and processing; and (ii) HAHB in organizing training on livestock product safety. \nTraining of trainers will be introduced to maximize the impact of capacity development. \n \n16.  Multilevel approach to food safety control. One of the two key project features is a \nmultilevel  approach  to  food  safety  control:  (i)  under  output  1,  the  project  will  assist  three \nadministrative levels (HAHB, MAHBs, and CAHBs) of food safety regulators and producers \n(PPEs) in upgrading their quality-testing capacity to meet the PRC\u2019s food safety regulations. \nThe strengthened food safety control will not only improve the safety of livestock products and \nfeed; (ii) under output 3, the project will provide capacity building to help the PPEs adopt \nHACCP and/or HACCP-based food quality control systems; and (iii) under output 1, the project \nwill help establish the laboratory information management system through which HAHB will \naccess livestock product quality-testing results provided by the PPEs. The resultant livestock \nproduct  safety  monitoring  and  inspection  system  is  expected  to  enable  the  food  safety \nregulators to monitor the PPEs\u2019 up-to-date information on livestock and its products to mitigate \nthe risk of distribution of contaminated food and animal disease outbreaks. Establishment of the \nsystem  is  an  important  element  in  HPG\u2019s  efforts  to  build  the  comprehensive  livestock \n                                                \n15 The areas to be covered by the training include market-based production system certification standards (e.g., \nhazard analysis and critical control point and China Good Agricultural Practices); animal welfare; biosecurity, \nincluding animal disease control; and waste management. Further details are included in Annex 1 of the Project \nAdministration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 A list of training planned under the project is provided in Annex 1 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \ninformation platform and traceability system. The resulting food safety improvements will benefit \na number of consumers. \n \n17.  Environmentally sustainable livestock production. A second key project feature is \nthe  demonstration  of  environmentally  sustainable  livestock  production  and  processing.  For \nsustainable sector growth, environmental impacts need to be mitigated as much as possible \nthrough efficient resource use. Despite their significant production activities, most PPEs still rely \non conventional waste management, involving the drying of waste and its application to crops. \nThis project will help all PPEs invest in facilities to enable proper waste treatment. Six PPEs will \nprocess solid waste for organic fertilizer, while five PPEs will process liquid waste through \nbiogas digesters to generate gas for power generation and residues for organic fertilizer. As a \nresult,  the  project  is  expected  to  avoid  more  than  1,000  tons  per  year  of  carbon  dioxide \nequivalent greenhouse gas emissions; and provide 56,000 tons per year of organic fertilizer. \nThree PPEs will use part of the organic fertilizer to grow feed and other crops which will promote \nfeed  safety  and  environmental  sustainability  in  feed  material  production  at  the  PPEs  and \nelsewhere. Although production of feed materials that are sourced by PPEs from markets are \nbeyond  the  project  scope,  the  PPEs  will  be  encouraged to  use certified feed  with  quality \nassurance standards, such as the China Good Agricultural Practices, to promote food safety. \n \n18.  The project will also establish a mechanism to monitor and promote water- and energy-\nsaving technologies through an environmental sustainability monitoring program, which was \ndeveloped and pilot-tested by the PMO and the PPEs during project preparation and will be \nimplemented under the project.17 The program will record quarterly water and energy use in new \nand existing PPE facilities of the same livestock type and in the same counties. The program is \nanticipated  to  enable  the  PPEs  to  increase  efficiency,  which  may  have  financial  and \nenvironmental benefits. An added value is the inclusion of existing facilities and expansion of \nthe  program\u2019s  benefits  beyond  the  project.  This  appears  to  be  among  the  first  long-term \nmonitoring programs for water and energy use by agricultural enterprises in Henan Province. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $148.70 million (Table 1).

The national government has requested a loan of $69 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.19 The \nnational government will be the borrower of the loan and relend the loan to HPG. HPG will in \nturn onlend a majority of the loan proceeds to project municipal and county governments, which \nwill make the loan proceeds available to nine PPEs on the same terms and conditions as those \nof the ADB loan to the national government. HPG will make the remaining loan proceeds \navailable for output 3 activities and for HAHB to implement relevant part of output 1 activities. \nHAHB and the PPEs will assume foreign exchange and interest rate risks for their portions of \nthe ADB loan proceeds. The PPEs will finance part of the civil work cost; part of the equipment \ncost; whole of the survey, design, and inspection cost; and whole of working capital.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  Livestock waste and wastewater treatment facilities were designed to meet the post-\ntreatment quality specifications for water and solid wastes. Measures were added to ensure \noptimal  operation,  such  as  biogas  digesters  with  wind  insulation,  heating  systems,  and \noverhead glasshouses to minimize the reduced functionality of biogas digesters during the cold \nseason. Support by the project implementation consultants and training will ensure the effective \noperation of the facilities by the PPEs. Testing equipment specifications for HAHB, MAHBs, and \nCAHBs; and in-house testing equipment for PPEs were assessed for compliance with the \nnational standards. Training on biosecurity, animal welfare, and introduction of the HACCP and \nISO certification standards for operation procedures will promote safer livestock production and \nprocessing systems. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The  economic  analysis  confirmed  economic  viability  of  the  project,  with  an  overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 18.5% and an economic net present value of CNY303.0 \nmillion. The economic internal rates of return for the individual subprojects vary (14.1%\u201330.5%). \nThe financial analysis confirmed the overall financial viability of output 2, the only revenue-\ngenerating output in the project, as well as for each individual subproject under output 2. The \noverall financial internal rate of return was 16.9%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of \n ", "8 \ncapital of 6.6%. The financial internal rate of return for the individual subprojects ranges from \n11.4% to 24.9% versus the respective weighted average cost of capital, which ranges from 4.2% \nto 7.7%. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the project\u2019s robustness in response to increases in \ninvestment costs, but sensitivity to revenue reduction and operation and maintenance cost \nincreases. On the basis of their financial statements, the financial performance of each of the \nPPEs was found to be acceptable in terms of liquidity, profitability, capital structure, and debt \nmanagement. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  The executing and implementing agencies were trained on procurement and financial \nmanagement  during  project  preparation.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  assisted  by \nprocurement agencies authorized by the national government. Further training on procurement \nwill be provided to the executing and implementing agencies, with a focus on practical aspects. \nThe financial management assessment confirmed HPG\u2019s sufficient capacity, while most PPEs \nmeet only the minimum requirements. HPG will ensure that (i) additional training on ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement procedures is provided, and (ii) every PPE assigns adequate finance staff to \nmanage its project account. Due diligence on corporate governance of PPEs was conducted for \nanticorruption and integrity during the project preparation. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to the national government and HPG. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  Improved food safety will benefit millions of people in the PRC, as well as consumers \noverseas. The project will benefit the livelihoods of 12,000 households in nine counties in Henan \nProvince through employment generation from PPEs\u2019 value chains (e.g., for suppliers of young \nstock, and fodder and feed crops). Among those beneficiaries, 1,400 employees (40% of which \nare female), will be hired directly by the PPEs. About half of those beneficiaries are expected \nfrom  poor  and  vulnerable  households.  The  project  is  designated  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming, anticipating to benefit about 10,800 women through involvement in on-farm \nactivities and off-farm waged employment opportunities provided by the increased production \nand processing of the PPEs. There will be little impact on smallholder livestock producers, \nbecause the PPE target markets do not overlap with local markets where smallholders sell their \nlivestock  and  meat  products.  The  project  assumes  a  supply  shortage  of  livestock  and  its \nproducts exists at the local and national levels; hence, the project activities will neither crowd \nout smallholder livestock producers nor widen income inequality. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), including an environmental management plan (EMP) was \nprepared according to the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009). The \nIEE  is  consistent  with  the  domestic  environmental  assessment  reports  for  the  PPEs. \nConsultations involved key stakeholders, including local communities and government agencies \nin the nine project counties, and the outcomes are integrated in the project design. HPG, \nthrough the PMO, will be responsible for implementation of and compliance with the EMP, \nincluding inspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or measures. The \nPMO will implement and have final responsibility for a grievance redress mechanism to handle \ndisputes. The PPEs will be responsible for site-based implementation of the EMP and grievance \nredress mechanism. The IEE was disclosed on the ADB website on 4 August 2015. \n ", "9 \n27.  Environmental benefits will be achieved through (i) improved management and recycling \nof livestock solid waste and wastewater, (ii) increased efficiency of water and energy use, (iii) \nstrengthened compliance with water resource regulations, (iv) improved health and safety of \nworkers  and  consumers  of  livestock  products,  (v)  improved  monitoring  of  environmental \nresource  use,  and  (vi) reduced greenhouse gas  emissions  due  to the  inclusion  of  biogas \ngenerators in project design. Potential project impacts include (i) overextraction of groundwater, \n(ii) soil and groundwater pollution from inadequate waste disposal, (iii) operational odor and \nnoise,  and  (iv)  localized  and  temporary  construction  impacts.  Measures  to  address  these \ninclude (i) strict compliance with groundwater extraction permits, (ii) long-term monitoring of \ngroundwater extraction and energy use, (iii) water-saving measures incorporated in project \ndesign  and  operations,  (iv)  reuse  of  treated  wastewater  and  biogas  slurry,  (v)  waste \ncontainment measures, (vi) recycling of solid waste to organic fertilizer, (vii) 500-meter buffer \nzones to offset noise and odor, and (viii) construction-mitigation measures. The PPEs\u2019 capacity \nto implement the EMP was assessed and requires strengthening. A capacity development \nprogram that includes EMP implementation is part of the project design. Full implementation of \nthe EMP, together with training, is expected to result in minor residual impacts that are within \nthe limits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. \n \n28.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. A resettlement \nplan  has  been  prepared  for  the  resettlement  of  three  households  for  the  Henan  Sangao \nAgriculture and Animal Husbandry Co., Ltd.21 Those households need to be physically relocated \nas required by the PRC environmental regulations because they are situated within 500 meters \nof the agroprocessing plant of one of the PPEs. The households will retain access to the land on \nwhich  their  existing  houses  are  located.  Negotiated  settlements  in  the  form  of  land  lease \ncontracts for the PPEs\u2019 project sites were reviewed and revised to ensure compliance with the \nrelevant national regulations and SPS. For house demolition impacts, these three households \npreferred cash compensation. A due diligence report was prepared on all land leases under the \nproject.22 The leases cover a total area of 215.6 hectares and involve at least 548 farming \nhouseholds. Some of the subproject land is state-owned land directly leased by the national \ngovernment to the PPEs or their parent companies; some is collectively owned land assigned to \nrural households that have subleased their allocated land to the PPEs. Most of the subleases \nprovide clear standards for determining or adjusting rent over the term of the project. In some \ncases, the term of the sublease extends beyond the term of the current household\u2019s use right. \nDue diligence was conducted that confirmed these agreements were voluntarily signed by the \nparticipating households after they were fully informed and consulted. Implementation of the \nresettlement plan and land lease agreements will be monitored and reported. The failure of \nnegotiated settlement (leasing) would not result in expropriation, and therefore the involuntary \nresettlement safeguard provisions of SPS are not triggered. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  The overall project risk rating is moderate. The integrated project benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n                                                \n21 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Due Diligence Report on Land Lease Contracts (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProject  The executing agency will monitor the PPEs\u2019 financial situation to ensure timely remedial measures \nimplementation  are taken if needed. ADB and the executing agency will carefully monitor and assess the financial \nby PPEs is  position of the PPEs during the midterm review. \nhampered due \nFor animal diseases: The project will provide the PPEs with training on prevention and handling of \nto poor \nanimal diseases, including improved management to minimize risk (herd health, use of veterinary \nfinancial \ndrugs and welfare) and proper handling procedures in case of a disease event (biosecurity). The \nperformance \nexecuting agency will monitor PPE animal disease prevention to minimize such risks. \ncaused by \n \nadverse market \nFor land lease contracts: The executing agency will monitor execution of land contract agreements \nsituations, \nbetween the PPEs and village collectives.

The lease terms extend beyond the term of the current household\u2019s use right \ndiseases, \n(currently 13\u201315 years from 2014), and it is not clear as a matter of the law of the People\u2019s \nand/or difficulty \nRepublic of China that these leases will continue or be unilaterally renewable by the relevant PPEs \nmaintaining \nfrom that point. Managing their land use rights may be a continuing operational issue for some of \nland lease \nthe PPEs, and is beyond their control. \ncontracts. \nUnsustainable  (i) Water use by the PPEs will be measured throughout the life of operations as part of a \nextraction of  sustainability monitoring program developed for the project. (ii) Water meters will be installed by the \ngroundwater  PPEs to measure all water use. (iii) Extraction permits issued to all PPEs will be strictly complied \nfor PPE  with. (iv) The project management office, the PPEs, and water resource bureaus will annually \noperations  review extraction volumes and permits. (v) Water-saving measures will be integrated in project \ndesign and operations. (vi) Use of raw water will be reduced because the PPE wastewater will be \ntreated and reused on crops around the PPEs. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PPE = project participating enterprise. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n30.  The national government and HPG have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents (footnote 18). \n \n31.  The national government and HPG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$69,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Henan Sustainable Livestock Farming \nand Product Safety Demonstration Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest \nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n7 September 2015\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with: \n(i)  Agricultural industrialization and large-scale operation upgraded,  \n(ii)  Capacity in ensuring agro-product quality and safety enhanced, and \n(iii) Conservation of agricultural resources and ecosystems strengthened. \n(National Modern Agriculture Development Plan, 2011\u20132015a) \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Indicators with Targets and  and Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020:   \nModel livestock  a.
