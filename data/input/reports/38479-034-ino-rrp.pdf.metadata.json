The  roads  are  in  less  developed  and  poorer  areas  of  the \nprovinces.  Roads were selected through project preparatory technical assistance 3 based on \ncorridor development and regional connectivity criteria to maximize development impacts and \nbenefits. The project is consistent with the strategic priorities of the Indonesia country strategy \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), 4  through  supporting  investment  in  transport \ninfrastructure to promote inclusive growth and reduce disparities across less-developed areas \nof the country. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nStrategic  context.  Indonesia  is  a  middle-income  country  with  varied  development \nacross its provinces and islands. The Government of Indonesia plans to promote sustainable \neconomic  growth  by  significantly  increasing  infrastructure  investment  over  the  next  5  years. \nTo  achieve  more  equitable  development  across  the  country,  the  government  recognizes  the \nurgent  need  to  (i)  improve  transport  accessibility  in  less-developed  areas,  which  will  also \nreduce  poverty  in  local  communities;  and  (ii)  expand  long-term  growth  opportunities  and \nattract investment through the development of stronger trade ties under regional cooperation \ninitiatives. \n \n4. \nThe  proposed  project  will  improve  strategic  and  national  road  corridors  in  northern \nKalimantan and southern Java to support economic growth in these two less developed and \npoorer  areas  of  the  country.  The  rehabilitation  and  capacity  expansion  of  road  corridors  will \nstrengthen  national  and  regional  connectivity,  and \njob \nopportunities, and social services. The national road network in southern Java is incomplete, \nwith some road sections of the southern Trans Java Highway not yet constructed, resulting in \ngaps in network coverage; other sections are constructed below national standards and are in \npoor condition. Improved road infrastructure in southern Java is necessary to remove existing \nconstraints  to  economic  growth  and  investment  in  this  isolated  area.  Similarly,  road  network \nimprovements  are  needed  to  support  economic  development  in  less-developed  and  remote \ndistricts  in  northern  Kalimantan.  Improved  road  connections  in  Kalimantan  to  the  Malaysian \nborder  will  support  the  Brunei  Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines\u2013East  ASEAN \nGrowth Area (BIMP-EAGA) transport initiatives to develop two land-based transport corridors \nfor  greater  connectivity  and  reduced  transport  costs 5,  as  well  as  complement  other  BIMP-\nEAGA  programs  to  reduce  nonphysical  barriers  to  trade  by  improving  customs,  immigration, \nquarantine, and security. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   East Java, Central Java, East Kalimantan, and West Kalimantan provinces.  \n3   Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2008.

Roads are the dominant mode of transport in Indonesia, meeting \n5. \n83%  of  passenger  and  70%  of  freight  demand.  Although  Indonesia  has  a  vast  network  of \nroads  with  37,500  kilometers  (km)  of  national  roads,  41,100  km  of  provincial  roads,  and \n249,000 km of district (kabupaten) roads, the density of the national road network is relatively \nlow  at  about  0.4  km  per  1,000  square  kilometers  (km2),  and  is  significantly  lower  in  less-\ndeveloped areas. 6 Road transport demand in the country has been growing significantly faster \nthan  the  gross  domestic  product  for  nearly  a  decade,  and  congestion  on  the  arterial  road \nnetwork is becoming a widespread problem, especially in Java.  \n \n6. \nRoads are a key enabler for the country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, as they improve \npeople\u2019s  access  to  education,  health  services,  and  job  opportunities.  In  recent  years,  the \ngovernment  has  concentrated  on  eliminating  the  large  maintenance  backlog  for  the  national \nhighway network, rather than expand the road network. This has limited funding for improving \naccess  to  areas  away  from  primary  traffic  corridors.  In  addition  to  persistent  maintenance \nrequirements,  ongoing  challenges  include  poor  interdepartmental  coordination,  inadequate \ninstitutional capacity, poor control of vehicle overloading, and insufficient focus on road safety. \nThe  government\u2019s  2010\u20132014  strategy  for  national  highways 7 is  to  ensure  that  roads  are \nimproved and constructed to enhance connectivity between major towns in order to increase \naccess  to  markets  and  other  centers  of  economic  activity,  including  (i)  expansion  of  road \ncapacity to meet traffic demand; and (ii) extension of the road network to serve poor, isolated \ncommunities and to promote regional cooperation with neighboring countries. \n \n7. \nRoad  financing  and  sustainability.  National  road  budgets  have more than  doubled \nfrom $1.0 billion in 2002 to almost $2.1 billion in 2009, equivalent to average annual growth of \n7%\u20138%  in  real  terms  but  lower  than  the  average  growth  in  vehicles  and  transport  demand. \nDespite this increase in funding, improper maintenance planning, inadequate standards, and \npoor  implementation  have  contributed  to  unsustainable  outcomes.  Variable  quality  of  work, \nshort-life  design  standards,  and \nfor  maintenance  and  new \nconstruction  works  reduce  the  life  of  road  assets,  which  subsequently  require  higher \nmaintenance  expenditure. \nthe \ndeterioration  of  roads.  The  government  has  come  to  recognize  that  new  and  more  cost-\neffective  road  maintenance  practices  are  essential  to  improve  overall  road  conditions  and to \nreduce  transport  and  logistics  costs.  Sustainability  of  the  road  subsector  also  requires \ninstitutional  capacities  to  be  strengthened,  especially  at  the  provincial  level  given  the \ndecentralization of responsibilities, particularly for road maintenance.  \n \nRelevance. The government\u2019s medium-term development goals commit to increasing \n8. \nsustainable  economic  growth,  creating  jobs,  and  accelerating  achievement  of  its  millennium \ndevelopment  goals. 8 Infrastructure  development  and  investment\u2014including  that  related  to \nroad transport\u2014is critical to meeting these objectives. Improvement of road infrastructure is a \nkey  priority  under  the  government's  2010\u20132014  5-year  medium-term  strategy,  and  is \nconsistent with the Indonesia transport sector assessment, strategy, and road map of the ADB \n(footnote 4). \n \nLessons.  Lessons  from  previous  ADB  transport  loans  and  sector  assessments  are \n9. \nincorporated in the project design. The focus on corridor development addresses the relatively \nlow  impacts  of  recent  loans  for  roads  that  were  spread  widely  throughout  the  country.  The \n\nIn  addition,  endemic  vehicle  overloading  accelerates \n\ninconsistent  supervision \n\n                                                \n6  The road density for Kalimantan is only 0.19 km per 1,000 km2, compared with 0.90 km per 1,000 km2 in Java. \n7  Ministry of Public Works. 2009.

The  outcome  will  be \nimproved capacity and safety of national and strategic roads. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  outputs  will  consist  of  two  components:  (i)  development  of  national  and \n\n11. \nstrategic roads, and (ii) road sector development program. \n \nThe  component  to  develop  national  and  strategic  roads  includes  rehabilitation  and \n12. \nimprovement  of  approximately  476  km  of  existing  roads,  mainly  within  the  existing  right-of-\nway, in the four provinces of East and West Kalimantan, and East and Central Java. ADB will \nfinance approximately 400 km of roads and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) will finance \napproximately  76  km  of  roads.  This  component  includes  consulting  services  for  project \nmanagement, environment and social safeguards, and construction supervision. \n \n13. \n  \n\nThe road sector development program component will include two subprograms: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nRoad  safety  strengthening  subprogram  (RSSP).  The  RSSP  will  adopt  an \nintegrated multiagency approach to road safety to support implementation of the \nnew road traffic law enacted in June 2009. The RSSP will include (a) road safety \nengineering  and  audits; (b) a road  safety  awareness  campaign for communities \nin  the  project  districts,  which  will  also  address  gender  issues  related  to  road \nsafety;  (c)  road  safety  training;  and  (d)  strengthening  capacity  for  overloading \nand speed enforcement. \n \nRoad  sector  subprogram  (RSP).  The  RSP  will  address  key  road  issues  and \nbuild  capacity  in  road  agencies  by  (a)  developing  an  integrated  capacity \ndevelopment  program  for  national,  provincial,  and  district  road  agencies;  (b) \ndeveloping an anti HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program for project districts; \n(c) a study to develop an overall strategic approach to transport sector planning \nto  prioritize  investments;  and  (d)  designing  and  implementing  an  effective \napproach for an integrated vehicle overloading control strategy. \n\n \nD. \n \n14. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $380.5 million (Table 1).    \n\n \n\n15. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $180  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \n\n \n\n\ffacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n16. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. The IDB will provide parallel cofinancing of $65.0 million \nequivalent  under  Istisna  loan  terms,  9  which  was  approved  by  IDB  on  1  May  2011.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart financing of $135.5 million equivalent. \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nLand acquisition and resettlement \n\nItem \nA.

Chaired  by  the  National  Development  Planning \nAgency  (BAPPENAS),  a  project  steering  committee  representing  BAPPENAS,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance,  MPW,  and  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  will  monitor  and  coordinate  project \nimplementation. DGH will be the main implementing agency and provide support for civil works \nand  road  safety  engineering.  The  three  other  implementing  agencies  are  (i)  the  Directorate \nGeneral  of  Land  Transportation  for  road  safety  awareness,  road  safety  training,  and  the \noverloading control program; (ii) the Directorate of Traffic Police for the overloading and speed \nenforcement  program;  and  (iii)  the  BAPPENAS  Directorate  of  Transportation  for  the  transport \nsector  development  strategy  and  policy  study.  DGH  will  establish  a  project  management  unit \n(PMU) headed by a manager with experience in externally financed projects. The PMU staff will \nbe  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation,  technical  and  financial  reporting,  and  ensuring \ncompliance with ADB procurement and consulting guidelines and safeguard policies. The PMU \nwill include experienced engineers, accountants, and other staff as required and be supported \nby  a  core  team  of  consultants.  Based  on  successful  implementation  of  previous  ADB  loans, \nDGH has sufficient capacity to implement the project.  \n \nOf  the  11  civil  works  contracts,  3  are  in  Central  Java,  1  in  East  Java,  3  in  West \n18. \nKalimantan, and 4 in East Kalimantan.

The \nproject  roads  will  follow  existing  alignments,  with  some  minor  deviations  from  the  right-of-way \nand realignment to comply with national highway standards. The civil works will strengthen the \nexisting  road  pavement  and  improve  road  alignments  to  meet  forecast  traffic  demand.  The \nimproved  roads  will  increase  capacity  and  safety  of  existing  highways  and  provide  new  all-\nweather links to the border with Malaysia at Aruk and Simanggaris in West and East Kalimantan \nprovinces, respectively. The detailed design for all road sections is complete. DGH has verified \nthe cost estimates for the civil works for the project. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  project  will  benefit  road  users  and  communities  in  four  provinces  and  indirectly \n21. \nbenefit adjoining provinces and neighboring countries. The main benefits derived from improved \naccessibility  are  better,  safer,  cheaper,  and  faster  transportation.  The  better  connectivity  will \nprovide social benefits that include improved access to health, education, and other government \nservices. The  project  is economically  viable  with  an  economic  internal rate  of return (EIRR) of \n13.0%. The sensitivity and switching value analyses shows that the EIRR is marginal and risks \nfalling  below  the  12%  threshold.  With  a  20%  change  in  user  benefits  and  project  costs,  the \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nEIRR will decrease to 10%, which is considered acceptable as the project areas will experience \nsubstantive  social  benefits  due  to  the  improved  road  conditions.  However,  as  conservative \nvalues  are  used  for  diverted  and  generated  traffic,  and  cost  increases  should  be  low  since \ndetailed  design  is  complete, the  probability  of the  EIRR falling  below  12%  is  considered to  be \nvery low. \n \n22. \nThe  low  project  EIRR  values  are  due  to  the  large  number  of  road  projects  that  will \nimprove road links that connect with the border and presently have low traffic volume; benefits \nare mainly derived in later years as traffic volume and trade increase. Benefits from increased \ntrade  traffic  have  been  conservatively  estimated,  but  potential  for  improved  benefits  is  high, \nespecially  if  the  current  nonphysical  constraints  to  trade  are  lowered;  expected  regional \ncooperation  measures  under  BIMP-EAGA  initiatives  are  successfully  implemented;  and \nsustainable development is expanded, including proposed ecotourism measures in Kalimantan. \n \n23. \nThe project will be a public sector investment, as low traffic volume will not attract private \nsector participation. DGH currently allocates about $1.2 billion of the annual budget for routine, \nperiodic,  and  major  road  maintenance,  or  about  70%  of  the  annual  budget  for  national \nhighways. The maintenance budget is expected to increase over the next 5 years to fully meet \nneeds, and sufficient funding will be allocated for maintenance of project roads. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nThe governance assessment, undertaken as part of the due diligence process, focuses \non  DGH\u2019s  capacity  in  financial  management,  procurement,  enforcement  of  regulations,  and \nother  institutional  issues  including  risk  of  corruption  during  procurement.  The  governance \nperformance of DGH has improved steadily in recent years. From 2007, DGH has incorporated \nan  anticorruption  action  plan  for  all  loan-funded  projects,  with  specific  measures  adopted  to \nmeet specific financier requirements. These measures include information disclosure, oversight \nand monitoring, mitigation of fraud and collusion risks, complaints handling, and sanctions and \nremedies. \n \n25. \nThe country's performance on national and local governance has been lacking in some \nareas,  but  progress  is  being  made  on  several  fronts.  The  establishment  in  December  2007  of \nthe  National  Public  Procurement  Agency  and  the  Anti-Corruption  Commission  has  resulted  in \npositive changes in terms of monitoring and enforcement of good governance. A major problem \nis lack of transparency in the public procurement process, and difficulties in validating prices for \ninternational \nforeign-funded  contracts  and  contract  variations.  The  project  will \ncompetitive  bidding,  which  improves  oversight  and  helps  mitigate  corrupt  practices.  This \nvalidation  process  improves  governance  but  can  also  cause  implementation  delays  if \ninformation is not readily shared. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  DGH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM, including the proposed anticorruption action plan (footnote \n10). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\ninclude \n\nThe  project  is  a  general  intervention  with  indirect  poverty  reduction  impacts.  For  the \n27. \ncoastal  highway  in  Southern  Java,  road  transportation  is  still  constrained  by  poor  road \nconditions  and  much  of  the  traffic  flow  is  for  the  transport  of  agricultural  commodities  from \n\n \n\n\fpoorer  areas  to  larger  northern  cities.  Local  economies  are  expected  to  benefit  from  lower \ntransport costs to major centers and better access to lateral markets where current connections \nare  poor  or  nonexistent.  With  improved  east\u2013west  access  and  easier  access  to  the  southern \nbeaches,  tourism  opportunities  will  increase  and  improve  prospects  for  local  businesses.  In \nKalimantan,  upgrading  two  international  border  corridors  will  promote  interregional  and \ninternational  linkages,  and  provide  alternate  markets  and  opportunities  for  local  communities. \nAccess to alternative sources of goods will reduce costs, promote all-year access, and increase \nthe  potential  for  small  and  medium-scale  entrepreneurs  to  develop  sustainable  businesses.  In \nall areas, the improved road access will facilitate government administration and social service \ndelivery, which will also promote women\u2019s empowerment through access to and use of relevant \nservices, resources, assets, and opportunities. \n\nfrom \n\ntemporary  construction \n\nLocal  communities  will  benefit \n\njobs,  and  routine \n28. \nmaintenance will employ unskilled and semiskilled workers. The employment and fair treatment \nof  women  in  construction  and  maintenance  will  be  encouraged.  DGH  will  ensure  that \nemployment opportunities are announced to local communities and will ensure that contractors \nconform with appropriate labor laws and standards. \n \n29. \nThe potential adverse social impacts from the project are increased risk of exposure to \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking of women and children during construction and operation due \nto the influx of construction workers, improved border connections, and increased transit traffic. \nSafety risks will increase for communities along the road because of increased traffic and higher \nvehicle  speeds  along  the  improved  road.  These  risks  will  be  addressed  through  the  anti \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention  program  (AHHTAPP)  and  RSP. \nFocus  will  be  placed  on  supporting  local  communities  in  designing,  implementing,  and \nmonitoring  community-based,  gender  responsive,  and  culturally  appropriate  AHHTAPP  and \nRSP awareness activities. All civil works contracts under the project incorporate provisions and \nbudgets to the effect that contractors carry out the AHHTAPP in the construction campsites in \ncoordination with the government's programs and other initiatives. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  project  is  classified  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  B  for \n30. \nenvironment  and  indigenous  people.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  land \nacquisition and resettlement action plans (LARAPs) for project districts were prepared to meet \nthe  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  LARAPs,  based  on  preliminary \ndesign of the roads, will be updated during project implementation.   \n \n31. \nThe  IEE  covers  a  general  environmental  profile  of  all  subprojects  and  includes  an \nassessment  of  potential  environmental  impacts  during  various  project  phases.  It  includes  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  with  a  set  of  mitigation  and  management  measures  to  be \ntaken  during  project  implementation  to  avoid,  reduce,  mitigate,  or  compensate  for  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts. The  subprojects  could  have  some  adverse  environmental  impacts,  but \nthey  would  be  short-term,  temporary,  and  reversible;  the  impacts  can  be  minimized  and \nmanaged by implementing mitigation measures.  \n \n32. \nNo subprojects will pass through conservation forests. One subproject in Java and six in \nKalimantan  will  pass  through  forests  that  are  protected  or  used  for  production,  but  no  tree \ncutting and land acquisition in such forests will be needed. No rare, threatened, or endangered \nspecies of flora and fauna are in or close to the subproject areas. No heritage sites of national \nand international importance, or sites that are historically or archaeologically sensitive, are in or \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fnear the subproject areas. Consultations were conducted from September 2008 to August 2011 \ninvolving  about  275  people  including  affected  people,  community  leaders,  nongovernment \norganizations,  and  national  and  provincial  government  officials.  The  IEE  is  available  to  the \npublic through the DGH office and ADB\u2019s website. \n \n33. \nThe Tambakmulyo\u2014Wawar road (38.5 km) is one of the three sections in Central Java.  \nThe land acquisition for the first 24 km of Tambakmulyo\u2014Wawar road was completed, 11 for the \nremaining 14.5 km, a LARAP was prepared. As the resettlement impacts will be significant, this \nsubproject road is classified category A for involuntary resettlement.  About 145 households will \nbe  severely  affected;  106  households  will  lose  at  least  10%  of  their  productive  land,  while  31 \nhouses  and  8  shops  will  be  physical  displaced.  A  total  of1,400  households  will  be  marginally \naffected by this subproject.  Land acquisition for the other two subprojects in Central Java, has \nbeen completed (footnote 11). The 10 subprojects in East Java, and East and West Kalimantan \nprovinces  are  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts will not be significant. LARAPs for East Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, and \nEast  Java  were  prepared.  About  530  households  will  be  marginally  affected  by  these  10 \nsubprojects.   \n \n34. \nDuring the preparation of the LARAPs for all subproject roads, meetings were held with \npotentially affected households and other stakeholders to determine potential impacts on land, \nnon-land  assets,  and  income  of  households  along  the  subproject  roads.  The  aim  was  to  elicit \nconcerns  and  suggestions  from  the  stakeholders  to  mitigate,  if  not  avoid,  these  impacts.  Key \ninformation  in the  LARAPs  was  disclosed  to the  affected  people.  No site  clearing  will  be  done \nuntil  after  DGH  and  ADB  have  agreed  upon  the  updated  LARAPs  and  the  provisions  in  the \nupdated LARAPs have been implemented satisfactorily. \n \n35. \nEthnic  groups,  such  as  Melayu,  Chinese,  and  Dayak,  live  along  the  roads  in  West \nKalimantan. They have been integrated into the wider socio-economic and cultural community, \nwhile  retaining  many  aspects  of  their  culture.  Specific  actions  related  to  ethnic  groups  are \nincluded  in  the  LARAPs,  such  as  consultation  measures  that  use  local  leaders  and  the \ntraditional grievance redress process for Dayak people.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36. \nThe  project  will  involve  standard  road  design  and  construction  techniques;  the  risks \nassociated with project design and construction are minimal. However, the greatest risks during \nproject implementation will be related to public financial management, procurement, corruption, \nand  due  diligence.  Risks  to  sustainability  and  policy  reform  require  the  application  and \nenforcement  of  appropriate  mitigation  measures.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan. 12 Benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh any mitigation costs. \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n11 For  completed  land  acquisition,  land  owners  are  still  allowed  to  use  the  land  for  farming  and  will  be  provided \n\nsufficient time to clear the land through socialization during project implementation. \n\n12 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLack of an effective policy for road \nsafety and inadequate control of \noverloaded vehicles \n\nDGH fails to maintain the project \nroads once improved \n \n\nThe government will expedite approval of the road safety \nimplementing regulations in 2012. \nThe government will complete the overloading assessment \nstudy in 2012 then implement the recommended measures. \nThe Traffic Police Corps will implement speeding and \noverloading enforcement program. \nConsultants will be appointed to help strengthen maintenance \nplanning, funding, and implementation. \nThe government will assure availability of adequate funds and \nselected use of performance-based maintenance contracting. \nDGH and ADB will implement annual project monitoring through \nthe anticorruption action plan and through two full review \nmissions, and make information available through the MPW and \nADB websites. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DGH = Directorate General of Highways, MPW = Ministry of Public Works. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nCorruption \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n37. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents.  \n \n38. \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \n \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  of  $180,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Regional  Roads \nDevelopment  Project  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n\nUrsula Schaefer-Preuss \nVice-President \n\n \n \n2 November 2011\n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n11 \n\n \nDesign Summary \nImpact \nIncreased efficiency of \nroad transport \nsupporting integrated \nand sustainable \neconomic growth along \nproject corridors \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms  \n \nProvincial yearbook  \n \nProject benefit monitoring \nand postevaluation reports \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n \nBy 2020, per capita gross \ndomestic product growth of \nproject districts increased \nby 10% from the \nprovince\u2019s average trend in \n2010 \n \nCross-border transport \ncosts per ton decreased by \n20% and volume of trade \nincreased by 50% from \n2010 to 2020 in \nKalimantan \n\n \nVolume\u2013capacity ratio in \nboth southern Java \nhighway corridors reduced \nfrom 0.8 to less than 0.5 \nby the end of 2016 \n \nBy the end of 2016, traffic \nvolume of northern \nKalimantan roads doubled \nfrom 2010  \n \nAverage number of road \naccidents in project \ncorridors decreased from \n15 deaths per 10,000 \nvehicles in 2009 to less \nthan 10 by the end of 2016 \n \nRehabilitation and  \nwidening of 476 kilometer \nof road in West and East \nKalimantan, and East and \nCentral Java provinces by \n2015 \n \nRoad safety engineering \nand audit completed and \nmeasures implemented for \nall project links by 2015 \n \nAll communities participate \nin road safety awareness \nprogram by December \n2015, with 80% \nparticipation of transport \nproviders and school \nchildren \n\nOutcome \nImproved capacity and \nsafety of national and \nstrategic roads  \n\nOutputs \n1.
