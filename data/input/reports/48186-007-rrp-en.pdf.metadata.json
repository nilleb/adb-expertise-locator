THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the additional financing of the Regional Road Development and Maintenance \nProject. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nHigh-Level  Technology  Fund  (HLTF)1 for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Regional  Road \nDevelopment and Maintenance Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n  The additional financing and the administration of the HLTF grant will scale up and extend \nthe socioeconomic benefits of the current project by further enhancing the road condition and \nsafety of the major national highway sections connecting the capital city of Ulaanbaatar with the \nnorthern and western aimags.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n  The current project aims to rehabilitate and enhance the safety of important regional road \ncorridor sections from Ulaanbaatar to Altanbulag and help the government improve the road asset \nmanagement and road safety capacity.3 The current project has been performing according to \nschedule since it became effective on 21 August 2018. The proposed project has been confirmed \nto meet the eligibility criteria for additional financing, as the current project meets all the criteria: \n(i)  project performance is rated on track. (No contract awards or disbursements have \nbeen made yet, which is in line with the current projection, and preparation \nactivities for consultant selection and procurement are on track.);4 \n(ii)  each safeguard covenant item is being complied with;5  \n(iii)  delivery of expected outputs is rated successful, as initial actions (such as the \npreparation of detailed design) are progressing as planned; and  \n(iv)  management of risks is rated successful, as all the risks in the current report and \nrecommendation of the President have been managed successfully.6 \n \n  The additional financing is proposed to (i) scale up the road rehabilitation and safety \nenhancement works to a deteriorated trunk road section from the capital city to the western \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n2  Provincial administrative unit in Mongolia. \n3  The current project\u2019s outputs comprise (i) road asset management capacity improved, (ii) road condition improved \n(for the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan and Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag sections), and (iii) road safety improved. The report and \nrecommendation of the President for the current project is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n4  The current project expected to recruit a design and construction supervision consultant in the third quarter of 2019 \nand award the first civil works contract in 2020 because the current procurement law does not allow advance \ncontracting (an amendment to this law is under consideration). However, the government secured its own financing \nsources in 2018 to conduct the detailed design of the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan section without waiting to use the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) loan and expedited the initial project actions. The loan-funded consulting service was \nadvertised on 29 October 2018, and a bidding document for the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan section was issued in March \n2019. \n5  The Ministry of Road and Transport Development (MRTD) has committed that the environmental management plan \n(EMP) will be included in the bidding documents, required safeguard staff members will continued to be engaged in \nthe project implementation unit (PIU), and a project-specific grievance redress mechanism will be established. \n6  One financial management action item included in the project administration manual (PAM) of the current project \nwas not completed by March 2019, but ADB and the government will complete the item soon after consultants are \nmobilized in the second quarter of 2019. \n \n ", "2 \nprovinces (Khuiten Valley\u2013Arvaikheer); (ii) further enhance the safety and flood resilience of the \ncurrent project section (Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan), some of which was severely damaged by floods \nin 2018; and (iii) conduct due diligence on the proposed new road improvement to connect to the \nplanned  Chinggis  Khaan  Tourism  Complex.  The  Khuiten  Valley\u2013Arvaikheer  section  is  a \nbottleneck  to  the  road  traffic  from  the  capital  city  to  the  western  aimags  because  of  the \ndeteriorated  and  unsafe  road  conditions,  and  its  improvement  will  enhance  the  economic \ndevelopment and the regional link. The government has initiated the National Program on Tourism \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132030,7 which aims to establish Mongolia as a global destination for nomadic \nculture. Chinggis Khaan tourism complex is planned in the documented birthplace of Chinggis \nKhaan.8 The additional scope is strongly linked to the current project\u2019s scope and can be efficiently \nimplemented under similar implementation arrangements. The overall project impact continues to \nbe aligned with the government\u2019s priorities under the Action Program of the Government of \nMongolia for 2016\u20132020 and the country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).9 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n  The project is aligned with the following impact: inclusive economic growth promoted by \nenhanced local, regional, and international connectivity in Mongolia.10 The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: efficiency and safety of road transport within the project area and between \ncountries improved.11 \n \n  The overall aggregate impact and outcome of the project remains unchanged from the \ncurrent project. The outcome indicators changed as a result of the additional financing to reflect \nthe newly added section of Khuiten Valley\u2013Arvaikheer. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n  The proposed additional financing will further enhance the road condition and safety of \nthe  Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan  (204  kilometers  [km])  section  and  improve  the  Khuiten  Valley\u2013\nArvaikheer (58 km) section with climate change adaptation measures. The outputs of the overall \nproject will be (i) road asset management capacity improved, (ii) road condition improved, (iii) road \nsafety improved, and (iv) due diligence reports prepared, as described in paras. 8\u201311. The outputs \nof the additional financing will contribute to the overall project outputs through (i) road condition \nand flood resilience improved for the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan (204 km)12 and Khuiten Valley\u2013\nArvaikheer (58 km) sections (part of output 2); (ii) road safety improved for the above sections \n(part of output 3); and (iii) due diligence reports for project preparation prepared for the Chinggis\u2013\nNorovlin\u2013Dadal section (257 km), the so-called \u201cSecret History\u201d road (output 4). The Ulaanbaatar\u2013\nDarkhan section will be funded by both the current and additional financing projects as part of \n                                                \n7  Government of Mongolia. 2015.

The coverage of the section \nwas extended on both sides, and the total length increased from 193 km to 204 km. \n ", "3 \noutputs 2 and 3, and the additional financing project will enhance the current project by including \n(i)  an  expansion  of  the  embankment  formation  to  11 meters  for  the  entire  alignment, \n(ii) rehabilitation of all the bridges, (iii) an increase in the stabilized subbase and other climate \nchange adaptation measures, and (iv) enhancements of the road safety facility such as wire-rope \nmedian barriers. More descriptions of the outputs of the overall project are given below. \n \n  Output 1: Road asset management capacity improved. This output will strengthen \nsustainable road maintenance practices and build capacity for the implementation of maintenance \nprojects prepared and procured during the project. Capacity-building activities will be conducted \nthrough a participatory approach involving various stakeholders such as the Mongolian Road \nAssociation and road maintenance companies. These activities include (i) reestablishing and \nproviding training on the road asset management system to improve maintenance planning, \nimplementation, and prioritization;13 (ii) designing improvements in road funding to ensure the \nsustainability of maintenance activities, including measures to prevent vehicle overloading; and \n(iii)  supporting  pilot  performance-based  maintenance.14 This  output  will  be  delivered  partly \nthrough attached technical assistance (TA) and partly with output 2. \n \n  Output 2: Road condition improved. This output will preserve and improve important \nregional road sections that link the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation \nthrough  Mongolia\u2019s  capital,  and  comprises  part  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation Corridor 4b. The project will improve 380 km of existing national highway sections \ncomprising Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan (204 km), Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag (118 km), and Khuiten Valley\u2013\nArvaikheer (58 km). Improvement works will include (i) pavement treatment and (ii) widening of \ncarriageways  and  shoulders  within  the  existing  right-of-way  (ROW).  The  road  design  will \nincorporate climate change adaptation measures such as adding cross-drainage culverts at flood \nprone areas, raising the height of the embankment in low sections, and installing thick asphalt \nconcrete layers. These adaptation measures are estimated to cost $16 million. \n \n  Output 3: Road safety improved. This output will provide capacity development in road \nsafety  policies  and  implement  safety  features  in  the  road  condition  improvement  works \nundertaken with output 2. Safety features will include improvements in road markings, barriers, \nand guide posts. The HLTF will finance a demonstrative introduction of wire-rope median barriers \nfor the mitigation of head-on collisions in traffic safety blackspots of the country\u2019s most heavily \nused national highway section of Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan. Climbing lanes will also be constructed \nwithin the ROW at the blackspots, where overtaking of slow-moving vehicles often causes fatal \nhead-on collisions. Independent road safety audits will be conducted on detailed designs, as well \nas a post-construction stage. \n \n  Output 4: Due diligence reports prepared. This output will prepare due diligence reports \nas part of project preparation for the Chinggis\u2013Norovlin\u2013Dadal section (257 km), the so-called \n\u201cSecret History\u201d road. The section will connect Chinggis City and the planned Chinggis Khaan \ntourism complex. \n  \n                                                \n13 A team of experts under the TA attached to the current project (TA 9544-MON) will assess the use of equipment and \nplanning  tools  provided  in  2010  under  ADB.  2009.

Interest during construction for the OCR loan has been \ncomputed at the 5-year US dollar fixed-rate swap plus an effective contractual spread of 0.50% and \nmaturity premium of 0.20%. Commitment charges for the ordinary capital resources loan are 0.15% per \nyear to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  The government has requested (i) a regular loan of $58.5 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources and (ii) a grant of $1.5 million from the ADB HLTF to help finance the additional \nfinancing project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 16.75 years, and \nthe maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per year. The HLTF (footnote 1) will provide grant \ncofinancing equivalent to $1.5 million, to be administered by ADB. The preferred financing option \nis parallel, and the HLTF will be used for the costs required to build wire-rope median barriers. \n \n  The borrower, the Government of Mongolia, will help finance the project and will assume \nthe foreign exchange and interest variation risks of the ADB loan and grant. The ADB loan and \nthe HLTF will finance 99% of the additional financing project cost, including the expenditures in \nrelation to works and consulting services.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n  The  assessment  determined  the  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  needs,  including \nconstructing climbing lanes and widening carriageways and shoulders to Mongolian Class I-G \nstandard to increase road capacity and safety.17 The project components are expected to improve \nthe conditions and safety of the road sections from Ulaanbaatar to Altanbulag (the section with \nsome of the highest traffic, part of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridor 4b) \nand from Khuiten Valley to Arvaikheer (the section connecting the capital city to the western \naimags). \n \n  The proposed wire-rope median barrier technology was tested in research laboratories \nunder the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan; and the ministry \npublished a press release on its effectiveness and a plan for nationwide deployment in Japan.18 \nApplication of this technology will be the first in the country, but it is expected to be effective \nbecause head-on collisions in the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan section are posing serious traffic safety \nrisks, and the technology has been tested and proven to be effective in cold climate conditions. \n \n  The overall project will develop a strategy for engaging the private sector more effectively \nin road maintenance, and recommend ways to strengthen the road maintenance companies\u2019 \ncapacity and business processes. The routine and periodic maintenance is operated by the \n20 state-owned  and  eight  private  maintenance  companies  with  limited  funding.  The  full \nintroduction of standard performance-based contracts (PBCs) is not appropriate in the current \nsituation because the sector lacks the experience and capacity to fulfill longer-term service \ncommitments. However, a form of PBCs will be pilot tested in the civil works contracts by \nimplementing a 5-year PBC concurrently with the improvement works during the first 2 years. \nWhile the length of network in each PBC may be well below accepted good practice, it is a vital \nfirst step to modernizing road maintenance practices in Mongolia. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n  The economic viability of the road improvement packages was assessed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines.19 The economic viability of the project was assessed in terms of the \nestimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag, Khuiten \nValley\u2013Arvaikheer, and for both sections combined. The result incorporates an update of the \nassessment carried out under the current project and the assessment of the additional packages \n                                                \n17 The Mongolian Class I-G (main road) standard requires a two-lane carriageway with each lane 3.5 meters wide and \nan 8.5-meter pavement. \n18 Government  of  Japan,  Ministry  of  Land,  Infrastructure,  Transport  and  Tourism.  2018.

The  updated  EIRR  was \nestimated to be 24.1% for the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag section, 12.8% for the Khuiten \nValley\u2013Arvaikheer section, and 22.6% for both sections combined. Thus, it may be concluded \nthat the overall project, as well as both sections (Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag and Khuiten \nValley\u2013Arvaikheer) are economically viable with solid EIRRs. A sensitivity analysis of potential \ncost overruns and benefit reductions indicates that the overall project remains viable under all \nassumptions and is economically robust. \n \n  The financial analysis of the current project conducted in March 2018 remains valid. The \nreview team requested the updated government budget20 and actual expenditure,21 but they were \nnot available at the time of project appraisal in December 2018. Once such information becomes \navailable during the project implementation, it will be used to monitor the financial sustainability \nof the project facility\u2019s operation and maintenance. Insufficient budget allocation for maintenance \nof the country\u2019s growing paved road network is a high risk for the sustainability of the road facilities. \nThe 2012\u20132017 maintenance budget increased 7.5% per year, while the paved road length more \nthan doubled from 2,964 km to 6,621 km in the same period. The MRTD will take mitigation \nmeasures as described in Table 4. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n  The MRTD recruited staff and established a PIU. The updated financial management \nanalysis assessed the pre-mitigation risk of the project to be moderate. The remaining key \nconstraints are that the PIU\u2019s financial management staff perform below expectations or have \nlimited knowledge of ADB requirements and the accounting system installed for the project. \nMeasures to mitigate such constraints were conveyed to the MRTD and are in the financial \nmanagement assessment22 and PAM. The additional financing project will follow the financial \nmanagement action plan of the current project as detailed in the PAM. The MRTD confirmed that \nthis action plan would be completed in 2019.  \n \n  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MRTD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n  In preparation for the additional financing, the analysis and activities in the summary \npoverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  (SPRSS),  gender  action  plan  (GAP),  and  social \ndevelopment action plan (SDAP) of the current project have been updated and extended to cover \nthe additional aimag of Uvurkhangai in the Khuiten Valley\u2013Arvaikheer section. These updates \nand additions, and their corresponding staffing and budget implications, have been agreed with \nthe MRTD. The overall project has been designed to meet ADB\u2019s effective gender mainstreaming \ncategorization and will deliver tangible benefits to women, including (i) training in livelihood \ndevelopment and income generation for women along the road corridor, with support from \nnongovernment organizations; (ii) employment during construction; and (iii) training for female \nMRTD staff. \n                                                \n20 Forecasted budget of the MRTD starting 2019. \n21 The actual MRTD expenditure for 2018 and the detailed actual recurrent and capital expenditure for the same period. \n22 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n  \n  The SPRSS, GAP, and SDAP for the current project cover Darkhan-Uul and Selenge \naimags. The additional GAP and SDAP actions for Uvurkhangai aimag are coherent with those \nof the original GAP and SDAP to facilitate implementation, monitoring, and reporting. The \nupdating of the SPRSS, GAP, and SDAP have been informed by an additional socioeconomic \nsurvey  and  consultations  conducted  in  Uvurkhangai  aimag  in October  2018.  An  additional \n120 people have been surveyed and consulted to understand transmission channels and likely \npositive and negative impacts resulting from the additional financing project.23 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are detailed below. \n \n  Environment (category B). The initial environmental examination (IEE)24 of the current \nproject was updated to include the project components under the additional financing and \nassociated environmental impacts. The additional financing does not involve any new road \nconstruction, and limits project activities to road maintenance works of the existing regional road \ncorridor. The project road corridor and its vicinities do not involve any environmentally sensitive \nareas or physical cultural heritage. A small number of nomadic herders and residences living \nalong  the  project  road  corridor  were  identified  as  the  main  sensitive  receptors.  Additional \nmeaningful  consultation  was  carried  out.  During  the  construction  phase,  anticipated \nenvironmental  adverse  impacts  are  construction  noise  and  dust  associated  with  road \nmaintenance works, water quality impacts of maintenance works near the rivers crossed by the \nproject roads, air quality from asphalt processing, domestic waste and wastewater at workers\u2019 \ncamps, and associated occupational and community health and safety risks. Limited adverse \nimpacts are anticipated during operation as the road is already operational and no induced traffic \nis predicted. With improved road conditions, usual impacts associated with poor road conditions \nsuch as sudden stops and rapid speed reduction to avoid potholes and uneven road surface, \nassociated noise, emissions, and accident risks, will be reduced. As the environmental impacts \nare  site-specific  and  can  be  sufficiently  mitigated  through  the  updated  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), the category for the environment remains B. \n \n  The updated IEE contains a comprehensive EMP, environmental monitoring plan, and \nproject-specific grievance redress mechanism that can adequately address adverse impacts of \nthe current project and the additional financing project. The updated IEE was disclosed on the \nADB website on 18 February 2019. The MRTD has committed to set up appropriate institutional \narrangements, allocate sufficient environmental budget, and implement the EMP and grievance \nredress mechanism for both the current project and the additional financing project. Once the \ndomestic detailed environmental impact assessments are prepared and approved, the current \nIEE  will  be  updated  to  reflect  the  domestic  environmental  impact  assessments\u2019  approval \nconditions to avoid any discrepancy. \n \n  The climate risks for the current project and the additional financing project are classified \nmedium. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment report has been prepared and included in \nthe updated IEE. Possible climate-related risks in the project area are seasonal floods and snow \naccumulation on the project roads. Climate adaptation measures, such as adding culverts at \n                                                \n23 Agreed updated Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Gender Action Plan, and Social Development \nAction Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nflood-prone areas, raising the height of the embankment in some low spots, and installing \nenhanced asphalt concrete layers, are proposed with estimated costs of $16 million. \n \n  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Due diligence confirmed that the outputs under \nthe additional financing will not require any land acquisition or resettlement as the works are \nlimited to rehabilitation and maintenance within the existing ROW. \n \n  Indigenous peoples (category C). The social analysis and consultations confirmed that \nseparate ethnic minorities are not present in the project area of the additional financing project. \nAll people will benefit from safer, faster, and more comfortable transport as a result of the \nrehabilitated road. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks, and the \noverall risk after mitigation measures is low for the additional financing project. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.25 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nThe government faces political and financial  The government provided assurances to increase the O&M budget \npressures in the adoption of sustainable  provision from the current insufficient allocation and will take actions as \nroad maintenance and maintenance  indicated in the project administration manual.a \nfunding concepts.   \nADB will continue policy dialogue and long-term engagement of all \ndecision makers in policy reform, including discussions on the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s Extended Fund Facility program. \nThe government may start a four-lane  The government agreed on the assurance to ensure proper due \nexpansion project for the Ulaanbaatar\u2013 diligence and keep ADB informed of the progress. \nDarkhan section without proper due \ndiligence, which may cause reputational \nrisks to the ADB project. \nNewly recruited project implementation unit  The Ministry of Road and Transport Development will appoint suitable \nstaff with limited knowledge of ADB  staff. \nprocedures and O&M requirements may   \nlead to implementation delay.
