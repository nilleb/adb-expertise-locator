The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nHigh-Level  Technology  Fund  (HLTF) 1  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Regional  Road \nDevelopment and Maintenance Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n\n \n\nThe additional financing and the administration of the HLTF grant will scale up and extend \nthe  socioeconomic  benefits  of  the  current  project  by  further  enhancing  the  road  condition  and \nsafety of the major national highway sections connecting the capital city of Ulaanbaatar with the \nnorthern and western aimags.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nThe current project aims to rehabilitate and enhance the safety of important regional road \ncorridor sections from Ulaanbaatar to Altanbulag and help the government improve the road asset \nmanagement  and road safety  capacity.3 The  current  project  has  been  performing  according  to \nschedule since it became effective on 21 August 2018. The proposed project has been confirmed \nto meet the eligibility criteria for additional financing, as the current project meets all the criteria: \nproject performance is rated on track. (No contract awards or disbursements have \nbeen  made  yet,  which  is  in  line  with  the  current  projection,  and  preparation \nactivities for consultant selection and procurement are on track.);4 \neach safeguard covenant item is being complied with;5  \ndelivery  of  expected  outputs  is  rated  successful,  as  initial  actions  (such  as  the \npreparation of detailed design) are progressing as planned; and  \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(iv)  management of risks is rated successful, as all the risks in the current report and \n\nrecommendation of the President have been managed successfully.6 \n\n \n\nThe  additional  financing  is  proposed  to  (i)  scale  up  the  road  rehabilitation  and  safety \nenhancement  works  to  a  deteriorated  trunk  road  section  from  the  capital  city  to  the  western \n\n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n2  Provincial administrative unit in Mongolia. \n3  The current project\u2019s outputs comprise (i) road asset management capacity improved, (ii) road condition improved \n(for  the  Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan  and  Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag  sections),  and  (iii)  road  safety  improved.  The  report  and \nrecommendation of the President for the current project is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n4  The current project expected to recruit a design and construction supervision consultant in the third quarter of 2019 \nand  award  the  first  civil  works  contract  in  2020  because  the  current  procurement  law  does  not  allow  advance \ncontracting (an amendment to this law is under consideration). However, the government secured its own financing \nsources in 2018 to conduct the detailed design of the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan section without waiting to use the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  loan  and  expedited  the  initial  project  actions.  The  loan-funded  consulting  service  was \nadvertised on 29 October 2018, and a bidding document for the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan section was issued in March \n2019. \n\n5  The Ministry of Road and Transport Development (MRTD) has committed that the environmental management plan \n(EMP) will be included in the bidding documents, required safeguard staff members will continued to be engaged in \nthe project implementation unit (PIU), and a project-specific grievance redress mechanism will be established. \n\n6  One financial management action item included in the project administration manual  (PAM) of the current project \nwas not completed by March 2019, but ADB and the government will complete the item soon after consultants are \nmobilized in the second quarter of 2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fprovinces (Khuiten Valley\u2013Arvaikheer); (ii) further enhance the safety and flood resilience of the \ncurrent project section (Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan), some of which was severely damaged by floods \nin 2018; and (iii) conduct due diligence on the proposed new road improvement to connect to the \nplanned  Chinggis  Khaan  Tourism  Complex.  The  Khuiten  Valley\u2013Arvaikheer  section  is  a \nbottleneck  to  the  road  traffic  from  the  capital  city  to  the  western  aimags  because  of  the \ndeteriorated  and  unsafe  road  conditions,  and  its  improvement  will  enhance  the  economic \ndevelopment and the regional link. The government has initiated the National Program on Tourism \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132030,7 which aims to establish Mongolia as a global destination for nomadic \nculture.  Chinggis  Khaan  tourism  complex  is  planned  in the  documented birthplace  of Chinggis \nKhaan.8 The additional scope is strongly linked to the current project\u2019s scope and can be efficiently \nimplemented under similar implementation arrangements. The overall project impact continues to \nbe  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  priorities  under  the  Action  Program  of  the  Government  of \nMongolia for  2016\u20132020  and the  country  partnership strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).9 \n \nB. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nThe project is aligned with the following impact: inclusive economic growth promoted by \nenhanced local, regional, and international connectivity in Mongolia.10 The project will have the \nfollowing  outcome:  efficiency  and safety  of road transport  within the  project  area  and  between \ncountries improved.11 \n \n\n \n\nThe  overall  aggregate impact  and outcome of  the  project  remains unchanged from  the \ncurrent project. The outcome indicators changed as a result of the additional financing to reflect \nthe newly added section of Khuiten Valley\u2013Arvaikheer. \n \nC. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\nThe proposed additional financing will  further enhance the road condition and safety of \nthe  Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan  (204  kilometers  [km])  section  and  improve  the  Khuiten  Valley\u2013\nArvaikheer (58 km) section with climate change adaptation measures. The outputs of the overall \nproject will be (i) road asset management capacity improved, (ii) road condition improved, (iii) road \nsafety improved, and (iv) due diligence reports prepared, as described in paras. 8\u201311. The outputs \nof the additional financing will contribute to the overall project outputs through (i) road condition \nand  flood  resilience  improved  for  the  Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan  (204 km) 12 and  Khuiten  Valley\u2013\nArvaikheer (58 km) sections (part of output 2); (ii) road safety improved for the above sections \n(part of output 3); and (iii) due diligence reports for project preparation prepared for the Chinggis\u2013\nNorovlin\u2013Dadal section (257 km), the so-called \u201cSecret History\u201d road (output 4). The Ulaanbaatar\u2013\nDarkhan section will be funded by both the current and additional financing projects  as part of \n\n                                                \n7  Government of Mongolia. 2015.

The coverage of the section \nwas extended on both sides, and the total length increased from 193 km to 204 km. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\foutputs 2 and 3, and the additional financing project will enhance the current project by including \n(i)  an  expansion  of  the  embankment  formation  to  11 meters  for  the  entire  alignment, \n(ii) rehabilitation  of  all  the bridges,  (iii)  an  increase in the  stabilized  subbase  and  other  climate \nchange adaptation measures, and (iv) enhancements of the road safety facility such as wire-rope \nmedian barriers. More descriptions of the outputs of the overall project are given below. \n \n\n \n\nOutput  1:  Road  asset  management  capacity  improved.  This  output  will  strengthen \nsustainable road maintenance practices and build capacity for the implementation of maintenance \nprojects prepared and procured during the project. Capacity-building activities will be conducted \nthrough  a  participatory  approach  involving  various  stakeholders  such  as  the  Mongolian  Road \nAssociation  and  road  maintenance  companies.  These  activities  include  (i)  reestablishing  and \nproviding  training  on  the  road  asset  management  system  to  improve  maintenance  planning, \nimplementation,  and  prioritization;13 (ii)  designing  improvements  in  road  funding  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of maintenance activities, including measures to prevent vehicle overloading; and \n(iii)  supporting  pilot  performance-based  maintenance. 14  This  output  will  be  delivered  partly \nthrough attached technical assistance (TA) and partly with output 2. \n \n\n \n\nOutput 2: Road condition improved. This output will preserve and improve important \nregional  road  sections  that  link  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  Russian  Federation \nthrough  Mongolia\u2019s  capital,  and  comprises  part  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation Corridor 4b. The project will improve 380 km of existing national highway sections \ncomprising Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan (204 km), Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag (118 km), and Khuiten Valley\u2013\nArvaikheer (58 km). Improvement works will include (i) pavement treatment and (ii) widening of \ncarriageways  and  shoulders  within  the  existing  right-of-way  (ROW).  The  road  design  will \nincorporate climate change adaptation measures such as adding cross-drainage culverts at flood \nprone areas, raising the height of the embankment in low sections, and installing thick asphalt \nconcrete layers. These adaptation measures are estimated to cost $16 million. \n \n\n \n\nOutput 3: Road safety improved. This output will provide capacity development in road \nsafety  policies  and  implement  safety  features  in  the  road  condition  improvement  works \nundertaken with output 2. Safety features will include improvements in road markings, barriers, \nand guide posts. The HLTF will finance a demonstrative introduction of wire-rope median barriers \nfor the mitigation of head-on collisions in traffic safety blackspots of the country\u2019s most heavily \nused national highway section of Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan. Climbing lanes will also be constructed \nwithin the ROW at the blackspots, where overtaking of slow-moving vehicles often causes fatal \nhead-on collisions. Independent road safety audits will be conducted on detailed designs, as well \nas a post-construction stage. \n \n\n \n\nOutput 4: Due diligence reports prepared. This output will prepare due diligence reports \nas part  of  project  preparation for  the  Chinggis\u2013Norovlin\u2013Dadal  section (257 km),  the  so-called \n\u201cSecret History\u201d road. The section will connect Chinggis City and the planned Chinggis Khaan \ntourism complex. \n  \n\n                                                \n13 A team of experts under the TA attached to the current project (TA 9544-MON) will assess the use of equipment and \nplanning  tools  provided  in  2010  under  ADB.  2009.

The  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  is  operated  by  the \n20 state-owned  and  eight  private  maintenance  companies  with  limited  funding.  The  full \nintroduction  of  standard  performance-based  contracts  (PBCs)  is  not  appropriate  in  the  current \nsituation  because  the  sector  lacks  the  experience  and  capacity  to  fulfill  longer-term  service \ncommitments.  However,  a  form  of  PBCs  will  be  pilot  tested  in  the  civil  works  contracts  by \nimplementing  a  5-year  PBC  concurrently  with  the  improvement  works  during  the  first  2 years. \nWhile the length of network in each PBC may be well below accepted good practice, it is a vital \nfirst step to modernizing road maintenance practices in Mongolia. \n \nB. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\nThe economic viability of the road improvement packages was assessed in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  guidelines. 19 The  economic  viability  of  the  project  was  assessed  in  terms  of  the \nestimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag, Khuiten \nValley\u2013Arvaikheer,  and  for  both  sections  combined.  The  result  incorporates  an  update  of  the \nassessment carried out under the current project and the assessment of the additional packages \n\n                                                \n17 The Mongolian Class I-G (main road) standard requires a two-lane carriageway with each lane 3.5 meters wide and \n\nan 8.5-meter pavement. \n\n18 Government  of  Japan,  Ministry  of  Land, \n\nInfrastructure,  Transport  and  Tourism.  2018.

Manila. \n\n6 \n\n \nA. \n \n\n \n\n\fof  the  additional  financing  project.  Economic  benefits  of  the  project  include  savings  in  vehicle \noperating  costs,  time  savings,  and  road  safety  benefits,  although  the  overall  project  will  also \ngenerate  unquantifiable  benefits  related  to  improved  accessibility.  The  updated  EIRR  was \nestimated to be 24.1% for the Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag section, 12.8% for the Khuiten \nValley\u2013Arvaikheer  section,  and  22.6%  for  both  sections  combined.  Thus,  it  may  be  concluded \nthat the overall project, as well as both sections (Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag and Khuiten \nValley\u2013Arvaikheer)  are  economically  viable  with  solid EIRRs.  A  sensitivity  analysis  of  potential \ncost  overruns  and  benefit  reductions  indicates  that the  overall  project  remains viable under  all \nassumptions and is economically robust. \n \n\n \n\nThe financial analysis of the current project conducted in March 2018 remains valid. The \nreview team requested the updated government budget20 and actual expenditure,21 but they were \nnot available at the time of project appraisal in December 2018. Once such information becomes \navailable during the project implementation, it will be used to monitor the financial sustainability \nof the project facility\u2019s operation and maintenance. Insufficient budget allocation for maintenance \nof the country\u2019s growing paved road network is a high risk for the sustainability of the road facilities. \nThe 2012\u20132017 maintenance budget increased 7.5% per year, while the paved road length more \nthan  doubled  from  2,964  km  to  6,621  km  in  the  same  period.  The  MRTD  will  take  mitigation \nmeasures as described in Table 4. \n \nC. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\nThe  MRTD  recruited  staff  and  established  a  PIU.  The  updated  financial  management \nanalysis  assessed  the  pre-mitigation  risk  of  the  project  to  be  moderate.  The  remaining  key \nconstraints  are  that  the  PIU\u2019s  financial  management  staff  perform  below  expectations  or  have \nlimited  knowledge  of  ADB  requirements  and  the  accounting  system  installed  for  the  project. \nMeasures  to  mitigate  such  constraints  were  conveyed  to  the  MRTD  and  are  in  the  financial \nmanagement  assessment22 and  PAM.  The  additional  financing  project  will  follow  the  financial \nmanagement action plan of the current project as detailed in the PAM. The MRTD confirmed that \nthis action plan would be completed in 2019.  \n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MRTD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\nIn  preparation  for  the  additional  financing,  the  analysis  and  activities  in  the  summary \npoverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  (SPRSS),  gender  action  plan  (GAP),  and  social \ndevelopment action plan (SDAP) of the current project have been updated and extended to cover \nthe  additional  aimag  of  Uvurkhangai  in  the  Khuiten  Valley\u2013Arvaikheer  section.  These  updates \nand additions, and their corresponding staffing and budget implications, have been agreed with \nthe MRTD. The overall project has been designed to meet ADB\u2019s effective gender mainstreaming \ncategorization  and  will  deliver  tangible  benefits  to  women,  including  (i)  training  in  livelihood \ndevelopment  and  income  generation  for  women  along  the  road  corridor,  with  support  from \nnongovernment  organizations;  (ii)  employment  during  construction;  and  (iii)  training  for  female \nMRTD staff. \n\n                                                \n20 Forecasted budget of the MRTD starting 2019. \n21 The actual MRTD expenditure for 2018 and the detailed actual recurrent and capital expenditure for the same period. \n22 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  SPRSS,  GAP,  and  SDAP  for  the  current  project  cover  Darkhan-Uul  and  Selenge \naimags. The additional GAP and SDAP actions for Uvurkhangai aimag are coherent with those \nof  the  original  GAP  and  SDAP  to  facilitate  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  The \nupdating of the SPRSS, GAP, and SDAP have been informed by an additional socioeconomic \nsurvey  and  consultations  conducted  in  Uvurkhangai  aimag  in  October  2018.  An  additional \n120 people have been surveyed and consulted to understand transmission channels and likely \npositive and negative impacts resulting from the additional financing project.23 \n \nE. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\ncategories are detailed below. \n \n\n \n\nEnvironment (category B). The initial environmental examination (IEE)24 of the current \nproject  was  updated  to  include  the  project  components  under  the  additional  financing  and \nassociated  environmental  impacts.  The  additional  financing  does  not  involve  any  new  road \nconstruction, and limits project activities to road maintenance works of the existing regional road \ncorridor. The project road corridor and its vicinities do not involve any environmentally sensitive \nareas  or  physical  cultural  heritage.  A  small  number  of  nomadic  herders  and  residences  living \nalong  the  project  road  corridor  were  identified  as  the  main  sensitive  receptors.  Additional \nmeaningful  consultation  was  carried  out.  During \nthe  construction  phase,  anticipated \nenvironmental  adverse  impacts  are  construction  noise  and  dust  associated  with  road \nmaintenance works, water quality impacts of maintenance works near the rivers crossed by the \nproject roads,  air quality from  asphalt  processing,  domestic  waste  and wastewater  at  workers\u2019 \ncamps,  and  associated  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  risks.  Limited  adverse \nimpacts are anticipated during operation as the road is already operational and no induced traffic \nis predicted. With improved road conditions, usual impacts associated with poor road conditions \nsuch  as  sudden stops  and  rapid  speed  reduction  to  avoid  potholes  and  uneven  road  surface, \nassociated noise, emissions, and accident risks, will be reduced. As the environmental impacts \nare  site-specific  and  can  be  sufficiently  mitigated  through  the  updated  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), the category for the environment remains B. \n \n\n \n\nThe  updated  IEE  contains  a  comprehensive  EMP,  environmental  monitoring  plan,  and \nproject-specific grievance redress mechanism that can adequately address adverse impacts of \nthe current project and the additional financing project. The updated IEE was disclosed  on the \nADB website on 18 February 2019. The MRTD has committed to set up appropriate institutional \narrangements, allocate sufficient environmental budget, and implement the EMP and grievance \nredress  mechanism  for  both  the  current  project  and  the  additional  financing  project.  Once  the \ndomestic  detailed  environmental  impact  assessments  are  prepared  and  approved,  the  current \nIEE  will  be  updated  to  reflect  the  domestic  environmental  impact  assessments\u2019  approval \nconditions to avoid any discrepancy. \n \n\n \n\nThe climate risks for the current project and the additional financing project are classified \nmedium. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment report has been prepared and included in \nthe updated IEE. Possible climate-related risks in the project area are seasonal floods and snow \naccumulation  on  the  project  roads.  Climate  adaptation  measures,  such  as  adding  culverts  at \n\n                                                \n23 Agreed updated Summary Poverty Reduction and  Social Strategy, Gender Action Plan, and Social Development \n\nAction Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n24 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fflood-prone  areas,  raising  the  height  of  the  embankment  in  some  low  spots,  and  installing \nenhanced asphalt concrete layers, are proposed with estimated costs of $16 million. \n \n\n \n\nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). Due diligence confirmed that the outputs under \nthe  additional  financing  will  not  require  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  as  the  works  are \nlimited to rehabilitation and maintenance within the existing ROW. \n \n\n \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C). The social analysis and consultations confirmed that \nseparate ethnic minorities are not present in the project area of the additional financing project. \nAll  people  will  benefit  from  safer,  faster,  and  more  comfortable  transport  as  a  result  of  the \nrehabilitated road. \n \nF. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \n\nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks, and the \noverall risk after mitigation measures is low for the additional financing project. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.25 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nThe government faces political and financial \npressures in the adoption of sustainable \nroad maintenance and maintenance \nfunding concepts. \n\nThe government may start a four-lane \nexpansion project for the Ulaanbaatar\u2013\nDarkhan section without proper due \ndiligence, which may cause reputational \nrisks to the ADB project. \nNewly recruited project implementation unit \nstaff with limited knowledge of ADB \nprocedures and O&M requirements may \nlead to implementation delay. \n\nThe government provided assurances to increase the O&M budget \nprovision from the current insufficient allocation and will take actions as \nindicated in the project administration manual.a \n \nADB will continue policy dialogue and long-term engagement of all \ndecision makers in policy reform, including discussions on the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s Extended Fund Facility program. \nThe government agreed on the assurance to ensure proper due \ndiligence and keep ADB informed of the progress. \n\nThe Ministry of Road and Transport Development will appoint suitable \nstaff. \n \nADB and consultants will provide institutional development and \ncapacity-building support for O&M-related training on the road asset \nmanagement system and will improve maintenance planning, \nprioritization, and implementation. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, O&M = operation and maintenance. \na  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\n \n\nThe government and the MRTD have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n\n \n\nThe  government  and  the  MRTD  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and grant agreement. \n\n                                                \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $58,500,000 \nto  Mongolia  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Regional  Road  Development  and  Maintenance \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n25 April 2019 \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n \nCurrent project \nInclusive economic growth promoted by enhanced local, regional, and international connectivity in Mongolia (Action \nProgram of the Government of Mongolia for 2016\u20132020)a \n \nOverall project \nInclusive economic growth promoted by enhanced local, regional, and international connectivity in Mongolia (Action \nProgram of the Government of Mongolia for 2016\u20132020)a \n \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \n \nCurrent project \nEfficiency and safety of \nroad transport within \nthe project area and \nbetween countries \nimproved \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall project \nEfficiency and safety of \nroad transport within \nthe project area and \nbetween countries \nimproved \n\nOutputs \n \nOutput 1 \nCurrent project \n1.
