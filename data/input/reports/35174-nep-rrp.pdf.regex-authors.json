This will require comprehensive analysis of options for future \neducation reform and restructuring. The sociopolitical changes since \nApril 2006 are likely to influence future policy directions.  \n \nNepal Education for All, 2004\u20132009 (EFA) is a high-priority national \nprogram supported by a number of development partners. The EFA \n\u201ccore  document\u201d  serves  as  the  sole  policy,  strategy,  program  and \nfinancing  framework  for  basic  and  primary  education  for  the \nGovernment and development partners. However, there is a financing \ngap of about $55 million if EFA goals are to be met. There is strong \ncountry ownership of EFA, management of the program has improved, \nand there has been significant progress toward the desired outcomes. \nThe joint financing arrangement (JFA) for EFA is considered by the \nGovernment and development partners to be a model of the program-\nbased  approach  (PBA)  in  Nepal,  as  it  uses  country  systems  and \nharmonized procedures for development partner contributions. Joining \nthe JFA would be one of the most effective ways for ADB to help \ntoward the achievement of the EFA\u2019s policy objectives and goals. \n \nThe Government recognizes that 5 years of school are not enough \nand has long envisioned extending basic education to cover grades 1\u2013\n8 and secondary education to cover grades 9-12. Another long-term \ngoal  is  the  improvement  of  synergies  between  the  basic  and \nsecondary subsectors so there is a more holistic approach to school \neducation. \n \n  \n ", "iv   \n  The Government\u2019s ultimate goal is to restructure school education into \nan  integrated  1\u201312  school  system.  Since  this  would  require  a \nsystematic and sustained period of analysis and planning, in 2004 the \nGovernment requested technical assistance from ADB to develop a \nholistic, programmatic approach for grades 1\u201312.  \n \n  The current international commitments to EFA and other programs will \nend by financial year (FY) 2009. A new 5-year planning cycle will \nbegin in 2007 with the Eleven Five Year Plan. Following the changes \nin the political context since April 2006, including a possible end to the \n10-year  armed  conflict,  Nepal  is  poised  to  enter  a  period  of \ndevelopment that will include education restructuring. As the causes of \nthe conflict were rooted in social, economic, and political disparities, \npost-conflict development policies and priorities will affect the direction \nfor education reform. The restructuring and reform of the education \nsystem  will  need  to  be  integrated  and  egalitarian,  rather  than \nfragmented and elitist. The timing is opportune for the Government to \nstart  preparing  for  inclusive  and  holistic  school  sector  reform. \nPreparation of the 1\u201312 school system reform and restructuring plan \nhas begun and it is proposed that ADB should continue to support the \npreparation  of  and  transition  to  the  1\u201312  school  system  through \neducation  policy  capacity  development  and  sector-wide  program \ndevelopment.  \n \nProgram Cluster  The  proposed  program  cluster  for  the  Education  Sector  Program \n  (ESP)  will  offer  phased  support  for  the  Government  of  Nepal\u2019s \n  medium- to long-term education sector reform and restructuring. The \nexpected outcome will be a more equitable, inclusive, effective, and \nholistic education system. Three subprograms will be developed and \nimplemented in accordance with the timeframe and progress of the \neducation sector reform and restructuring from 2007 to 2012.   \n \nSubprogram I (ESP I) will help implement policy interventions in basic \nand  primary  education  by  supporting  EFA,  2004-2009.  It  will  help \nprepare an education reform and restructuring program that aims to \nintegrate  the  current  primary  and  secondary  subsectors  into  an \nintegrated grade 1\u201312 school system.  \n \nSubprogram II will support initial implementation of the 1\u201312 school \nsystem reform and restructuring, particularly an early implementation \nof 1\u20138 basic education restructuring in a few districts.  \n \nSubprogram  III  will  support  the  phased  implementation  of  the \nrestructured 1\u201312 school system. \n \n ", "  v\n \n \nProgram Loan     \n \n  Impact and         The  program  loan  will  support  Nepal  EFA,  2004\u20132009  and  the \nOutcome  achievement of the six EFA goals: (i) early childhood development \n(ECD) expanded; (ii) access to education for all children increased; \n(iii) learning  needs  of  all  children  met;  (iv)  adult  literacy  improved; \n(v) gender and social disparities eliminated; and (vi) all aspects of \nquality education improved. The program loan will provide budgetary \nsupport  to  the  EFA  through  the  JFA.  It  will  help  finance  the  3 \nremaining years of EFA, and to monitor, assess and improve EFA \nimplementation  with  other  development  partners.  It  will  support  a \nrange  of  policy  interventions  to  (i)  increase  equity  of  access  to \neducation and social inclusion; (ii) improve quality and relevance; and \n(iii) enhance efficiency and institutional capacity.        \n \n  Financing Plan     A loan equivalent to $30 million in special drawing rights from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  will  be  provided.  The  loan  will  have  an \namortization period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an \ninterest  rate  of  1%  per  year  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \nLoan Agreement.  \n \nSubprogram II, which will be presented separately for consideration \nand  approval  by  the  Board,  and  will  depend  on  progress  with \nsubprogram I, is expected to require a grant of $8 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources.  \n \nSubprogram III, which will be presented separately for consideration \nand  approval  by  the  Board,  and  will  depend  on  progress  with \nSubprograms I and II, is expected to require a loan and grant of \n$25 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n \n  Program Period   The Program period will be from January 2007 to July 2009. The loan \nand Tranching  closing date will be January 2010.The loan will be released in two \nequal tranches of $15 million each. The first tranche will be released \nupon loan effectiveness. All the first tranche conditions have been \nmet. The second tranche is expected to be released within 18 months \nof  the  release  of  the  first  tranche,  subject  to  compliance  with  the \nsecond tranche release conditions. \n \n \n ", "vi   \n  Procurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nand  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nDisbursement  procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoan, the proceeds of the Loan will be disbursed to the Government \nas the Borrower. The Borrower will certify that the value of the eligible \nimports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under \nthe loan for the given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use of \nloan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower\u2019s \ncertification. \n \n     \n  Executing   The Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) will be the Executing \nAgency and  Agency  and  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  will  be  the \nImplementation  Implementing  Agency.  ESP  I  will  follow  program  management \nArrangements  arrangements  in  the  JFA,  which  details  the  goals  of  EFA;  the \nresponsibilities of the Government and the development partners; the \nfunding  mechanism;  the  fiduciary  requirements,  including \nprocurement,  reporting,  monitoring  and  auditing;  and  other \nadministrative  requirements.  The  JFA  development  partners  meet \nregularly to review the financial and operational status and progress of \nthe EFA and to commit and disburse funds to the program. \n \n  Counterpart  ADB  funds  provided  through  the  JFA  will  be  strictly  devoted  to \nFunds  implementing the EFA program. The local currency funds generated \nfrom the proceeds of the program loan will be used by the Government \nto supplement the cost associated with implementing existing policy \ninterventions in the education sector. \nGrant Project   \n  Impact and  A capacity development grant will support the preparation of and the \nOutcome   transition to a 1\u201312 school system. To prepare and to facilitate a \nsmooth  transition,  the  Government  has  established  a  high-level \neducation policy committee (EPC) and is preparing a \u201ccore document\u201d \nto  guide  the  transition.  The  capacity  development  grant  project \noutcomes  are  (i)  institutionalized  policy  review,  formulation, \ncoordination,  and  follow-up  functions;  (ii)  a  broadly  accepted  and \nfinanced  1\u201312  school  reform  and  restructuring  program,  for  initial \nimplementation by FY2010; and (iii) realigned legislative, governance, \nmanagement and financing structures appropriate for the 1\u201312 school \nsystem by FY2010.  \n \n  Financing Plan  The Project will have a total cost of $2.3 million equivalent. ADB will \nprovide a grant of $2 million from its Special Funds resources. The \nGovernment  will  provide  $300,000  equivalent.  The  grant  will  be \nsubject to conditions set forth in the Grant Agreement.  \n \n ", "  vii\n \n  Executing         MOES will be the Executing Agency for the Project, with the technical \nAgency and  secretariat of the EPC as the focal point. Within 1 month of grant \nImplementation  effectiveness,  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  the \nArrangements  Secretary  of  MOES,  will  be  established  comprising  senior  MOES \npersonnel and others. The PSC will be responsible for (a) approving \nthe annual work plan and budget; (b) conducting Project reviews on a \ntrimester basis (every 4 months); (c) preparing Project performance \nreports; (d) providing guidance to the technical secretariat on Project \nimplementation; and (e) coordinating inputs, in particular consulting \nservices,  with  other  development  partners.  The  joint  secretary, \nPlanning Division, MOES will be the project director, in charge of the \nday-to-day  management  and  implementation  of  the  Project.  The \nproject director will report to the PSC, and will be assisted by the \ntechnical secretariat and consultants. \n \n  Implementation  The Project will be implemented over 3 years from 1 January 2007 to \nPeriod  31 December 2009. Grant closing date will be 30 June 2010. \n \n              Consultancy  The  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be \nServices,  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  Project  will  finance \nand        approximately  9  person-months  of  international  and  112  person-\nDisbursement   months  of  national  consulting  services.  The  consultants  will  be \nselected  by  ADB,  and  engaged  and  supervised  by  MOES.  The \nconsultants recruited under the Project (package B) will procure the IT-\nrelated equipment, and the goods required for the refurbishment of the \ntechnical secretariat and the policy resource room in accordance with \nthe ADB's Procurement Guidelines. The shopping method will be used \nfor procurement of goods of less than $100,000 for each package, and \nlimited international bidding will be used for procurement of goods over \n$100,000. All disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. To ensure the timely release of the \ngrant,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  in  the  Nepal  Rastra \nBank. \n \nBenefits and  ESP I will benefit children, youth and adults of Nepal, particularly those \nBeneficiaries  who have been denied a quality and affordable education. It will support \nthe achievement of the six EFA goals by meeting part of the financing \ngap and by providing technical advice and capacity development to \nimprove  EFA  implementation.  Education  policy  functions  will  be \nstrengthened,  and  policy  decisions  better  coordinated.  Based  on  a \nthorough  policy  framework,  a  technically  sound  and  financially \nsustainable  program  and  a  financing  framework  for  developing  the \nschool system will be drawn up. This will ensure that policy decisions, \nand restructuring of education governance, management,  and  finance, \nwill lead to a  holistic school  system  and improved sector performance. \n \n ", "viii   \n  The  overall  impact  of ESP  I  will  be  stable  progress  toward  a  more \nequitable and effective education system. The education benefits and \nimpacts of ESP I will generate social benefits among socioeconomically \ndisadvantaged  groups.  Better  access  to  an  affordable  and  quality \neducation, and better learning achievements will ensure that such groups \nwill be able to generate the necessary education and social capital to \nbuild  economically  and  socially  responsible  lives.  An  egalitarian  and \ninclusive education system can help to relieve the root causes of conflict \nand social tension, build social cohesion and bring social stability. Better \naccess to  post-primary and  basic education  of girls  and  women  will \nenhance  women\u2019s  political,  economic,  and  social  roles.  As  EFA \nemphasizes inclusion, conflict mitigation, and post-conflict reconstruction, \nESP  I  will  contribute  immediately  to  implementation  of  the  inclusion \nstrategy and will intensify the role of education in peace building.    \n \nRisks and Assumptions  EFA is a high Government priority and a well-established program, so \nthe implementation risks of this program loan are low. Operating in the \nconflict-affected areas used to be a major issue, but as security has \nimproved  EFA  will  be  able  to  reach  poor  and  disadvantaged \ncommunities in those areas. A potential financial risk is that an existing \ndevelopment partner may decide not to continue. However, this risk is \nconsidered  small  because  the  current  development  partners  have \nbeen consistent in their support for Nepal\u2019s education sector. Should \nany financing gap emerge in the final years of the program, stricter \nfinancial planning and more modest annual program targets will be \nneeded. MOES can manage such risk through contingency planning. \nThe preparation of and transition to a 1\u201312 school system entails risks \nthat are typical of an innovative reform process: (i) difficulties and \ndelays in reaching a broad consensus among stakeholders and the \ndevelopment partners about the reform and restructuring agenda; and \n(ii) the risk that the reform process may be disrupted by the emerging \nsociopolitical  issues  or  changes  in  senior  personnel.  Strong \nconceptual leadership will be required from MOES. \n \nESP I will have a positive impact on socially disadvantaged groups, \nincluding girls, indigenous people, and members of ethnic minorities. \nThe  Government  has  endorsed  a  vulnerable  communities \ndevelopment  framework,  which  supports  implementation  and \nmonitoring of the current EFA vulnerable communities development \nplan. As part of the EFA, additional classrooms are being constructed \nto  accommodate  increasing  enrollment  and  prevent  overcrowding. \nNormally school sites are located in areas already approved for such \npurposes  and  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are \nanticipated.  ESP  I  will  include  new  construction  and  upgrading  of \nexisting  facilities,  but  since  these  activities  will  be  conducted  at \nexisting school sites, ESP I is unlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s involuntary \nresettlement policy. \n ", "82o  00'E 88o  00'E\nNEPAL\nEDUCATION SECTOR PROGRAM I\n30 o 00'N 30 o 00'N\nFARWESTERN\nDEVELOPMENT Simikot MIDWESTERN\nREGION HUMLA DEVELOPMENT\nREGION N\nDARCHULA\nDarchula PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nMAHAKALI OF  CHINA\nBAJHANG Gamgadhi\nBAITADI Chainpur BAJURA MUGU 0 20 40 60 80 100\nPatan SETI Martadi\nDadeldhura KARNALI Kilometers\nJumla\nDADELBDhaHtkUaRndAa DipSayilagarhi Mangalsen KALIKOT JUMLA DOLPA Jomsom DEWVEELSOTPEMRNENT\nDOTI ACHHAM Manma MUSTANG REGION\nDunai\nBanbasaMahendranagar\nDAILEKH JAJARKOT\nKANCHANPUR GodawarMiasuliya Babiyachour DBailHekEhRJIajarkot RUKUJMumlikhalanga DHAWALAGIRI ChMamAeNANG DEVCEELNOTPRMALENT\nDhangadhi MYAGDI REGION \nKAILALI BARDIYA SUBRireKnHdEraTnSagittaarlSpaAtLiYSAaNlyanLRiwAanPgTRIOLPA BAGLUNBaGgluBnegnPiARBAT KPAoSkhKaIra GLAANMDJBUAeNsKiGsIaharGORKHA Dhunche RASUWA DEVEREAELSGOTIEPORMNNENT\nGulariya Kohalpur PYUTHAN Kushma BAGMATI\nBANKE Tulsipur Pyuthan GULMI Gorkha SINDHUPALCHOK\nGorahi SYANJA TANAHU Bidur Chautara\nTamghas NUWAKOT\nNepalganj DANGLamahiSaAndRikGhHarAkKaHANCHITansen LUPMABLPIANISyanja Mugling DHADINNGaubiseKaKkaaKnthiAmTaHnMdBAuaNrhDaUbise CDhaOrLikAoKtHA SANKHUWASABHA TAPLEJUNG\nKAPILBASTU Butwal NAWALPARASI Bharatpur Thankot BHBAhKaTkAtaPpuUrR Jiri SOLUKHUMBU Phungling\n27 o 00'N KrishnanagaTraulihawaLumBbhinaiiRraUhPiwAaNSDuEnaHuIli Parasi BaruwMaeghCaHulIiTWNAANLRohAPPaaYHAththeARaltraSaNiuyAIdaBahimBMpLAeAAdRKLiDAWIaTkAPPsNhaUitPnRakUnaDPRliAhKuLAlSAikBiNhnHedCBlhRJHhuAEiOmlimNKeRsaAaRhdmwAiKaeMPrcEhUhCSaRIHpNHDAHPOUKOLHkIhAaLlSdDhAHuGUngNAaKGSRHaAOMlleTDrAAiikTNteHGlABBHhOoDjpJhPuBaraUnsRkaKunthtapTaunErdRbTHearrPAhiATaHNntUChuMHmMTAERPChidHimIIlam27 o 00'N\nNational Capital Birganj Kalaiya SARLAHI Dhalkebar UDAYAPUR DHANKUTA ILAM\nDTNoiaswttironicnta Hl Heaigdhqwuaayrters I   N   D   I   A Raxaul RAUTAHGAauTr MMAaHlaOnTgaTwAaRDIHANJaUnSakHpAurSLSiarIhaRahAnaHA SGAPaiTgAhaRtI DIShtaUahrNaarSniARIKMOOSMRHaAikINhoGlaChaJnHKdAraaPkgaAarbdhhitita\nJaleswar Rajbiraj Rangeli\nNational Road Biratnagar\nRiver Jogbani\nDistrict Boundary\nZonal Boundary\nRegional Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n6\n-3\n7\n7\n5 H 82o  00'E 88o  00'E\nR", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the Education \nSector Program (ESP) in Nepal, comprising (i) a proposed program cluster for education sector \nreforms in Nepal, (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram I of ESP (ESP I) and (iii) a proposed grant \nfor capacity development.   \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \n2.  Nepal\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was less than $200 during the three \ndecades prior to 1990, and remained about $280 in financial year (FY) 2005. The Government \nundertook various economic reforms after the mid-1980s and the economy grew steadily at an \naverage of 4.7% a year during the 1990s. However, the accelerating internal conflict after 2001 \nhurt tourism and other industries. Export growth has declined sharply in 2002\u20132006, as the \nglobal economy has slowed down. As a result, the GDP growth rate has been erratic, averaging \nabout 2% a year since FY2002.  \n \n3.   The stable economic growth in the 1990s brought significant improvements in access to \nbasic social services, which reduced child mortality, increased primary school enrollment, and \nled to more gender parity in education. Incidence of income poverty decreased from 42% in \nFY1996 to 31% in FY2004, and the country\u2019s human development index rose from 0.45 in 1995 \nto  0.52  in 2003.  However,  although  overall poverty  incidence  has decreased, the  level  of \nimprovement was inequitable, exacerbating gender, ethnic and geographic disparities.  \n \n4.  The Tenth Five-Year Plan, 2002-07 (the Tenth Plan), which is also the national poverty \nreduction strategy paper, was prepared in the midst of accelerated conflict in 2002. During the \nfirst 3 years of the Tenth Plan, the Government limited expenditure to about 19% of the GDP. \nWithout more rapid GDP growth, the Government will not be able to spend significantly more on \neducation unless expenditures in other sectors, such as security, can be reduced.  \n \n5.  The ADB country operations business plan, 2007\u201320091 for Nepal predicts that recent \npolitical breakthroughs and the improvement in the security situation2 could yield significant \npeace  dividends  for  the  economy  over  the  next  few  years.  With  sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement, an expansion in development expenditures, reviving local government bodies, a \nstrong focus on improving governance, and continuity in the reform process, the economy \nshould rebound. GDP growth could reach 4% in FY2007 and then quicken to over 6% in the \nmedium term.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n \n6.  The education system of Nepal consists of pre-school and early childhood development, \n5 years (grades 1\u20135) of primary education, 3 years (grades 6\u20138) of lower secondary education, \n2 years (grades 9\u201310) of secondary education, 2 years (grades 11\u201312) of higher secondary \neducation,  technical  education  and  vocational  training,  tertiary  education,  and  non-formal \neducation, including  adult literacy programs. A school leaving certificate (SLC) is awarded \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Operation Business Plan: Nepal 2007\u20132009. Manila. \n2  A mass uprising throughout the country\u2014led by the seven-party alliance (SPA) and backed by the Communist \nParty of Nepal, Maoist (CPN/M)\u2014compelled King Gyanendra to relinquish the state powers, and reinstate the \ndissolved Lower House of Parliament on 24 April 2006. On 18 May 2006, the Parliament declared itself to be \nNepal\u2019s sovereign authority. Furthermore, on 7 November 2006, SPA and CPN/M reached a historic peace \nagreement after two days of negotiations, putting an end to the decade-old insurgency.  \n  \n ", "2           \nfollowing national examinations at the end of grade 10. Under the overall policy direction of the \nMinistry of Education and Sport (MOES), school education is administered by the Department of \nEducation  (DOE),  through  regional  education  directorates  and  district  education  offices. \nAppendix 1 contains a sector analysis. \n \n7.  Nepal continues to expand participation in education at all levels. Between 2001 and \n2005, the net enrollment rate (NER) for primary education rose from 81.0% to 86.8%. Lower \nsecondary NER grew from 42.9% to 46.5% and secondary NER from 29.5% to 32.4%. Gender \nparity  has  improved,  with  girls  representing  47.0%  of  primary  enrollment,  45.0%  of  lower \nsecondary  enrollment,  and  46.0%  of  secondary  enrollment  in  2005.  Another  trend  is  the \nincrease in demand for post-primary education. The average annual growth rates in the number \nof schools during the 1995\u20132005 period were 2.5% for primary, 5.3% for lower secondary, and \n6.6% for secondary.  \n  \n8.  School performance has also improved. At the primary level, performance is monitored \nby  end-of-level  survival  rates  (the  share  of  children  who  complete  one  school  grade  and \ncontinue on to the next) and end-of-year exam results. Survival rates for grades 5 and 8 are \nimproving. Between 2003 and 2005, survival rates to grade 5 grew from 59.7% to 79.1%, while \nsurvival  rates  to  grade  8  grew  from  55.0%  to  64.1%.  At  the  secondary  level,  the  SLC \nexamination  is  used  as  a  performance  indicator.  In  2004,  SLC  pass  rates  were  46.0%, \ncompared with 32.0% in 2003. However, while 82.0% of private school students pass SLC \nexaminations, only 34.6% of public school students do so. \n \n9.  Government commitment to education is high. Expenditure on education has averaged \nabout 3.0% of GDP in the last 5 years and was 4% in FY2005. The sector receives 16.0% of the \ntotal budget in FY 2007, up from 15.0% in FY 2002. The budget allocates 56.3% to primary \neducation, 24.1% to secondary, 1.4% to technical and vocational, 10.4% to tertiary, and the \nbalance  to  administration  and  development.  Donor  support  for  the  sector  in  FY  2007  is \nestimated at $89 million, or 29.0% of total planned expenditure. Despite its commitment to \neducational development, the Government will not be able to provide sufficient resources on its \nown, as primary enrollment has rapidly increased, and, consequently, secondary enrollment will \nfurther increase. Nepal will probably need considerable financial support from development \npartners in the next 5\u201310 years, particularly given the current slow economic growth rate. Sector \nfinancing is discussed in Appendix 2.  \n \n10.  Despite remarkable steps toward achieving the Tenth Plan\u2019s goals and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDG) for primary education enrollment and gender parity, Nepal needs to \n(i) reduce the wide disparity in access to quality education among disadvantaged groups, and \n(ii) improve the quality and efficiency of public education at all levels. It needs to reexamine the \nsector as a whole and to embark on a systematic policy analysis and formulation process for \nfuture education reform and restructuring. The sociopolitical changes since April 2006 will also \nprobably influence future policy directions.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities  \n \n11.  Equity of Access and Social Inclusion. Although many aggregate education statistics \nshow improvement, low participation, high drop out rates, and poor performance continue to \ncharacterize students from poor households, marginalized ethnic groups, and remote areas. \nSimilarly, girls\u2019 participation remains low within these groups. Poverty is the major economic \nbarrier, as poor parents cannot afford the direct and indirect costs of sending children to school. \nParents often accord relatively low importance to girls\u2019 education, while deep-rooted gender and \n ", "          3 \nethnic inequities are major social and cultural barriers hindering equitable access to education. \nReaching the unreached has been a long overdue undertaking in Nepal.  \n \n12.  Quality and Efficiency. Disparity is apparent between public and private schools, and \nby geographical region. Private schools offer higher quality education and have better SLC \nresults  than  the  public  schools,  which  suffer  from  relatively  poor  learning  environments, \ninadequate teaching facilities and materials, and weak performance of teachers, especially in \nremote areas. Public school students tend to come from lower-income groups, while private \nschools cater to those who can afford to pay. To achieve long-run poverty reduction in Nepal, \nthe quality and efficiency of public education must be improved.         \n \n13.  Education and the Conflict. Even at the height of the insurgency, children in affected \nareas continued to be educated. Despite the insecurity, the Government and communities \nmaintained  the  education  system,  providing  a  certain  amount  of  stability  for  children. \nNevertheless, the conflict has had discernable impacts on education, one of the most visible \nbeing the migration of internally displaced people from the hills to the Terai region. This has \ncaused severe overcrowding of schools in the Terai. Urgent action is required to assist these \novercrowded schools and to provide scholarships, counseling, and financial support to pupils \nand teachers affected by the insurgency. \n    \n1.  Government Policies and Programs    \n \n14.  Policy Trends and Shifts. For several decades, Nepal has anchored education policy on \nthe principle that expanding human capital is the key to economic progress. The goal of education \nwas to expand schooling through higher enrollment, a greater budget share, higher teacher \nqualifications, and more teacher training. This policy was successful in expanding the supply of \nschools.  However,  a  large  gap  has  persisted  in  education  opportunities  among  children  of \ndisadvantaged groups. In addition, increasing the number of schools and providing more teacher \ntraining have not, in themselves, improved students\u2019 performance.  \n  \n15.  The Government introduced fundamental policy changes after 2000: (i) it promoted \nequity  of  access  and  social  inclusion  as  a  national  priority,  and  (ii)  it  emphasized \ndecentralization and community involvement in education. The Tenth Plan reflects these policy \nchanges. For the first time, the 5-year plan has social inclusion as one of its four pillars and \nemphasizes inclusive education as a central approach to reducing disparities related to gender, \ncaste, and ethnicity. The Tenth Plan also defines decentralization as the centerpiece of its \nschool improvement strategy. It promotes decentralization of school governance by proposing to \nprovide  school  management  responsibilities  to  school  management  committees  (SMCs)  at \nindividual schools. Furthermore, the seventh amendment to the Education Act, 2001 provides \ncommunities, through the SMCs, formal rights in the management of primary schools. In 2000, \nNepal joined the global movement Education for All (EFA). The National Plan of Action for EFA \n2015 was drawn up with the vision of achieving quality basic and primary education for all by \n2015. The National Plan of Action also set a long-term vision for extending basic education to \ngrade 8 and ultimately to develop a holistic school education system covering grades 1\u201312. \n \n16.  Future Policies and Reforms. Given the changes in the political context since April \n2006 and the possibility of ending the 10-year armed conflict, Nepal is poised to enter a new \nperiod of development that will include education restructuring. Although it would be premature \nto predict how the sociopolitical situation will evolve, it is likely that post-conflict reform will be \nstrongly oriented to addressing the social, economic, and political disparities that caused the \nconflict. It is also likely that the current policy of decentralization will be strengthened, and that \nparticipation,  equity,  and  inclusion will  remain  fundamental  goals  so  the  education  system \n ", "4           \nprovides economic and social opportunities to all. The strategic intent of restructuring and \nreforming the education system will be to make it more integrated, inclusive, and egalitarian.  \n \n17.  The Tenth Plan\u2019s policies are prioritized at the sector level and resources are allocated \nthrough the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), the annual business plan for the \neducation sector, and the annual work plan and budget (AWPB). At the subsector level, the EFA \nprogram for primary and basic education, financed by a number of development partners, and \nthe Secondary Education Support Project (SESP) supported by ADB and the Government of \nDenmark,3 reflect Tenth Plan policies and specify goals, operational policies, strategies and \nprogram components for each subsector.  \n \n18.  Education for All, 2004\u20132009. EFA started as a follow-up to the Basic and Primary \nEducation Project II from 1999 to 2004,4 which was also financed by a number of development \npartners, and the adoption of the EFA National Plan of Action 2015. EFA is a high-priority \nprogram supported by more than 11 development partners. Guided by the international EFA \nmovement and the Tenth Plan\u2019s policy direction, the EFA \u201ccore document\u201d is the sole policy, \nstrategy, program, and financing framework for the Government and development partners in \nbasic and primary education. EFA, 2004-2009 is estimated to cost over $800 million, with over \n70% provided by the Government. It has six goals: (i) early childhood development (ECD) \nexpanded; (ii) access to education for all children increased; (iii) learning needs of all children \nmet; (iv) adult literacy improved; (v) gender and social disparities eliminated; and (vi) all aspects \nof quality education improved. EFA is Nepal\u2019s first truly program-based approach (PBA)5 and \ninvolves full development partner harmonization. Under a joint financing arrangement (JFA), five \ndevelopment  partners6  pool  funds  for  earmarked  activities  through  an  annual  strategic \nimplementation plan (ASIP) and the AWPB. These are agreed by the Government and the \ndevelopment partners before the beginning of each fiscal year. Other development partners \nprovide parallel financing to EFA. A development coordination matrix is in Appendix 3.   \n \n19.  Next Phase. While EFA and SESP implementation are key priorities, Nepal is also \npreparing for its next development phase in education. Recognizing that 5 years of schooling \nare not enough to meet Nepal\u2019s long-term human resource needs, the Government has long \nenvisioned extending basic education to cover grades 1\u20138 and secondary education to cover \ngrades 9\u201312. It has also long considered creating better synergies between the basic and \nsecondary subsectors through a more holistic approach to school education. The ultimate goal \nis to restructure the sector into an integrated 1\u201312 school system. Since it would require a \nsystematic and sustained period of analysis and planning to formulate a policy framework for an \nintegrated school system, the Government requested technical assistance (TA) from ADB in \n2004  to  assist  in  the  preparation  of  its  education  sector  development  policy  and  strategy \n(ESDPS).7 A team of MOES officers undertook analysis of current policies and provided input to \npolicy makers on school system policy, strategy and functioning options.  \n  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002.

UNICEF intends \nto join the JFA.  \n7  ADB. 2004 Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Preparation of Education Sector Development \nPolicy and Strategy. Manila.  \n ", "          5 \n20.  This exercise highlighted the importance of making education policies well coordinated \nand consistent to ensure accountability and to strengthen the system (para. 66). MOES needs a \nstrong policy-making and coordinating mechanism if it is to prepare a technically sound and \nfinancially sustainable plan for school system development. Therefore, at MOES\u2019 initiative, an \ninter-ministerial education policy committee (EPC) was established by the Cabinet in June 2006 \nto  coordinate  and  recommend  education  policies.  EPC  is  a  permanent  education  policy \nformulation and coordination structure at leadership levels. One of the EPC\u2019s first tasks was to \ndevelop a Concept Paper that recommends a policy direction for the 1\u201312 school system, then \nto provide guidance on the preparation of the new 1\u201312 core document. The EPC will advise the \nGovernment on adjustments to education governance and on the management and financing \nstructures needed to support an equitable and effective 1\u201312 school system. \n  \n   2.  ADB\u2019s Assistance and Lessons Learned \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s assistance in the primary and secondary subsectors in Nepal has evolved from a \nproject approach to a policy-oriented program approach. This is in line with the ADB\u2019s education \nsector  policy,8  which  emphasizes  the  changing  role  of  ADB  from  a  project  financier  to  a \ndevelopment partner assisting in formulation of sector policies and capacity development. This \nmeans  lending  should be  integrated  into  a  sector-wide  policy  framework  backed  by  many \nstakeholders. At the secondary school level, the SESP, although designed as a project, was the \nresult of extensive sector analysis and policy dialogue, and is built upon a shared long-term \nvision for secondary education reform and institutional development. The SESP core document \nis guided by the Tenth Plan and the MTEF. At the primary school level, ADB has not yet joined \nthe JFA, but supports EFA through the Teacher Education Project9 (TEP), which provides pre-\nservice and in-service primary teacher training. Through ESDPS, ADB continues to provide TA \nin capacity development in policy analysis and sector-wide program development in preparation \nfor the 1\u201312 school system reform and restructuring.         \n \n22.  MOES has significantly increased its capacity and leadership under EFA and SESP \nduring the first 2 years of implementation: Central planning and management, reporting, the \neducation  management  information  system  (EMIS),  and  decentralized  planning  have  all \nimproved. So has the quality of ASIP, AWPB, and the semi-annual EFA progress reports. \nHowever, (i) monitoring of the targeted programs, such as scholarships for girls and Dalits,10 \nneeds to be improved through a sound tracking system; and (ii) strengthening monitoring and \nreporting at the district and school levels, especially in regard to quality improvement. In the \ncourse of preparing the proposed ADB program, the JFA fund flow and reporting mechanisms \nwere carefully assessed. They were found to be efficient and to provide an acceptable fiduciary \nenvironment, although scope for further strengthening of financial reporting was noted (para. \n53). Recommendations based on assessment of EFA implementation are in Appendix 4, while \nJFA  financial  management  is  assessed  in  Appendix  5.  Overall,  EFA  and  SESP  have \ndemonstrated positive progress, although there have been some implementation delays, partly \ndue to the security situation.11 \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003.

Implementation has improved since the Mid Term Review conducted in March 2006 that resolved the \nmajor issues. \n ", "6           \n3.  Rationale for the Proposed Education Sector Program Cluster Approach \nand Subprogram I (ESP I) \n \n23.  ADB will continue to support the Government\u2019s commitment to improve equity of access, \nand the quality and efficiency of education. The proposed program cluster will complement the \nongoing assistance provided by SESP and TEP to primary and secondary education, and will \nassist the Government in moving toward a holistic approach to school education. The Nepal \ncountry strategy and program, 2005\u20132009,12 emphasizes the role of ADB in supporting policy-\nbased interventions and sector-wide approaches (and PBA) to foster comprehensive sector \ndevelopment. This is in line with the shift in development assistance to education in Nepal from \nindividual projects to a PBA led by the Government and supported by development partners \n(footnote 6).  \n \n24.  The restructuring of education into an integrated 1\u201312 system will be the main focus of \nNepal\u2019s  medium-  to  long-term  agenda  for  the  education  sector.  The  preparation  of  a \ncomprehensive, internally consistent development plan must be the starting point. However, it \nneeds to be recognized that full implementation of the 1\u201312 system at the district or individual \nschool level will not take place until many years beyond the planning and piloting phases. The \nfinalization of a 1\u201312 core document and restructuring plan does not mean that Nepal will \nquickly  achieve  universal  education  at  grades  1\u201312,  or  even  1\u20138.  Considerable  capacity, \nunderstanding, and commitment will be needed, and physical facilities must be built. In a \ncountry with Nepal\u2019s uncertain political situation, and budgetary, geographic, and socioeconomic \nconstraints, this process will take many years, and will doubtless benefit from considerable \nlearning-by-doing along the way. \n \n25.  The Program Cluster and Lending Modality. Given the challenges facing Nepal and \nthe envisaged timeframe, preparation and implementation of the 1\u201312 reforms will have to be \nphased. However, there is an urgent need for resources to keep flowing to primary schools to \nmaintain EFA delivery (see para. 29). Considering the need for a phase approach to education \nreforms, ADB\u2019s program cluster modality is the most appropriate form of assistance.13 This \napproach is in line with ADB\u2019s education sector policy, which advocates using a greater variety \nof  lending  modalities,  especially  those  best  suited  to  supporting  policy  reform.  Three \nsubprograms  will  be  developed  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  timeframe  and \nprogress  of  the  education  sector  reform  and  restructuring  between  2007  and  2012.14 \nSubprogram I (ESP I) will be ADB\u2019s financial contribution to the ongoing EFA through the JFA. \nADB will also support policy interventions under the EFA, and preparation for the 1\u201312 school \nsystem reform and restructuring, including the new core document. Subprogram II (ESP II) will \nsupport extension of basic education to grades 1\u20138 in a few districts, once a broadly accepted \ncore document has been developed. Lessons learned from ESP II will help the Government to \ninitiate a country-wide 1\u20138 restructuring. Subprogram III (ESP III) will support implementation of \n1\u201312 school system reform and restructuring once the core document has been finalized and \nfinanced, and the legal, governance, and financing framework has been adjusted to the new \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Nepal 2005\u20132009. Manila. \n13 No existing ADB lending modality neatly fits the characteristics and requirements of a PBA. There is a danger that \ntraditional project loans could impede the Government\u2019s leadership and significantly increase its transaction costs \n(through the need to comply with many and varied donor administrative and reporting procedures). In addition, \nADB\u2019s project loans and sector loans do not allow ADB to use country systems and pool funds with those of other \ndevelopment partners. \n14 Government\u2019s timeframe for the reform goes until 2015, or beyond ESP, in accordance with the National Plan of \nAction for EFA 2015. ADB\u2019s assistance in the sector will need to take this into account when preparing the next \nCountry Partnership Strategy for Nepal.       \n ", "          7 \nsystem\u2019s requirements.15 Within the 1\u201312 school system framework, ESP III will continue to \nsupport the initial 1\u20138 restructuring, as this process will take several years to fully implement.  \n \n26.  The development partners\u2019 annual commitments to PBA in Nepal\u2019s EFA are based on \nprogram  performance  using  EFA  indicators  rather  than  policy  milestones.  ESP  I  and  the \nassociated  capacity  development  grant  will  guide,  support,  and  monitor  progress  in  policy \ndevelopment under EFA and preparations for 1\u201312 school system development. However, \ntranche releases will be contingent mainly on progress in EFA program outcomes. \n \n27.  The  design  of  ESP  I  takes  into  account  the  complex  development  context  of  the \neducation sector. It aims to meet the immediate financing needs of the current system, and will \ntherefore contribute to the full achievement of EFA goals. It will support policy making and \npreparation for longer-term education reform and restructuring aimed at making the school \nsystem more equitable and effective. It will lessen the Government\u2019s transaction costs by using \nits  established  systems,  avoiding  parallel  financing,  and  ensuring  alignment  with  other \ndevelopment  partners\u2019  programs.  In  addition  to  enhancing  EFA\u2019s  short-term  programmatic \noutcomes, ADB\u2019s involvement through the proposed cluster program and associated capacity \ndevelopment grant will add value by (i) strengthening the monitoring and assessment of primary \nschools,  particularly  with  regard  to  impacts  on  the  poor,  girls,  and  disadvantaged  groups; \n(ii) catalyzing  the  analysis,  planning,  and  initial  implementation  of  Nepal\u2019s  long-term  1\u201312 \neducation system development; and (iii) promoting development effectiveness by harmonizing \nADB  assistance  with  that  of  its  partners  and  with  country  priorities  and  systems,  and  by \nstrengthening ADB\u2019s commitment to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.  \n \n28.  Nepal\u2019s EFA and PBA. The common features of PBAs16 are: (i) leadership by the host \ncountry; (ii) a single comprehensive program and budget framework; (iii) a formalized process \nfor partner coordination and harmonization of procedures for reporting, budgeting, financial \nmanagement and procurement; and (iv) efforts to increase use of local systems for program \ndesign  and  implementation,  financial  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  The \nGovernment and development partners consider Nepal\u2019s EFA and JFA to be a model PBA. The \nEFA core document is the sole policy, program, and financing framework and all development \npartners have subscribed to it. The Government and the development partners\u2019 budgets are \npooled into a single budget framework, divided into capital and recurrent budget. EFA is a \nGovernment owned and led program. The JFA describes harmonized procedures for reporting, \nbudgeting, financial management and procurement for the development partners. A code of \nconduct  for  partner  harmonization  was  developed  and  agreed  to  by  all  EFA  development \npartners.  Finally,  through  the  JFA,  some  of  the  development  partners  provide  earmarked \nbudgetary  support  to  EFA  and  make  annual  funding  commitments  based  on  agreed \nperformance targets.  \n \n29.  The Government has had a longstanding invitation for ADB to join the JFA. This is in \npart because of an urgent financing gap, estimated at $55 million for the years 2007\u20132009, but \nmore importantly because EFA is a high-priority national program and a model PBA for the next \nphase of education development. The Government would like all major development partners to \nbe  fully  aligned  with  its  system.  The  difficulties  in  disbursement  experienced  under  SESP \n(footnote  11)  show  that  in  the  future  parallel  financing  through  project  lending  should  be \n                                                 \n15 ESP II and ESP III are included in the country operations business plan for an amount of $8 million from ADF \ngrant, and $25 million from ADF loan and grant, respectively. The time frame II for ESP II is expected to be 2008\u2013\n2009 and for ESP III from 2010\u20132012. The total amount for the program cluster (all three subprograms) is \nestimated at $65 million.  \n16 In the High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, Paris, 2 March 2005, PBA was defined as a way of engaging in \ndevelopment  cooperation  based  on  the  principles  of  coordinated  support  for  a  locally  owned  program  of \ndevelopment, such as a national development strategy or a sector program. \n ", "8           \navoided, as DOE has limited capacity to absorb and manage new projects. Efforts should be \nmade to align donor procedures and lessen the Government\u2019s transaction costs for procurement \nand disbursement. ADB\u2019s work program and budget framework, 2006\u20132008, and the Nepal \ncountry operations business plan also emphasize the importance of commitments under the \nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, including the enhanced use of country systems and \nharmonization of donor procedures. As EFA implementation is progressing well, joining the JFA \nwill be the most effective way for ADB to contribute to achievement of EFA goals. The EFA joint \nreview mission in June 2006 welcomed ADB\u2019s intention to join the EFA\u2019s JFA through ESP I. \n \n30.  Supporting the Next PBA Phase. Building on experience with EFA and SESP, and \nwith a new education policy formulation structure in place under the EPC, Nepal is ready to \napply holistic planning to the long-term integrated development of the primary and secondary \nschool system. The current international commitments to EFA and SESP will end at the end of  \nFY2009. The Government intends to integrate EFA and SESP core documents into a 1\u201312 core \ndocument, and to begin implementation of the 1\u201312 school system in FY2010, an approach \nendorsed by the development partners participating in the EFA and SESP joint review mission \nin June 2006. ADB\u2019s support for capacity development in policy making and preparation for the \n1\u201312 school system will continue through ESP I. The key task will be preparation of the core \ndocument covering the policy, program and investment framework for the integrated 1\u201312 \nschool system.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n31.  The overall objective of ESP I is to contribute to poverty reduction in Nepal by increasing \nthe level of education attainment, particularly for girls and disadvantaged groups. ESP I aims to \nachieve  (i)  improved  policy  interventions  in  primary  and  basic  education  and  performance \ntargets under the Nepal EFA 2004\u20132009; and (ii) a broadly accepted and financed 1\u201312 school \nsystem reform and restructuring framework, for implementation by FY2010. ADB will support \nEFA by joining the JFA. It will help finance the 3 remaining years of EFA, and to monitor, assess \nand improve policy implementation under EFA with the other agencies. ESP I will support the \nGovernment\u2019s ongoing process of preparing a policy, governance, management, and financing \nframework appropriate for an integrated 1\u201312 school system. This support will be provided in a \njoint and harmonized manner with the other development partners. A development policy letter \nand a program policy matrix are in Appendix 6. A design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 7. \n \nB.  Important Features \n \n32.  Program-Based Approaches in the Nepal Education Context. Each PBA is unique \nand depends on the country and sector context in which it evolves. The PBA approach to \neducation in Nepal has been nurtured through long efforts to maximize multi-partner assistance \nin a country with a limited absorptive capacity. It allows development partners to ensure that \ntheir budgetary support is fully aligned with the Government system and ensures the budget is \nearmarked for specific areas and types of activities mutually agreed by the Government and the \npartners. This arrangement builds Government ownership, while at the same time allowing \npartners to monitor the use of funds regularly and to participate in planning and monitoring. It \nhelps the Government to build a stronger fiduciary environment. Another feature is the absence \nof a lead donor, which helps to strengthen Government leadership and establishes a collegial \nrelationship among the partners.  \n \n ", "          9 \n33.  In  the  past,  ADB  has  not  participated  in  any  multi-funded  projects,  including  EFA. \nHowever,  EFA  and  its  JFA  represent  a  promising,  pragmatic  and  responsive  PBA.  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement will be in accordance with its commitment to the Paris Declaration. The next step \nwill be the harmonization of technical assistance, and a shift from earmarked budgetary support \nto full sector budgetary support when sufficient capacity has been built within the Government.   \n \nC.  The Program Loan  \n \n1.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n34.  The program loan will support the Nepal EFA 2004\u20132009 to achieve the six EFA goals \n(para. 18). It will contribute to increased educational achievement and, ultimately, improved \nlivelihoods for all children, particularly girls and the disadvantaged. Outcomes of the program \nloan will include increased primary education access, quality, and efficiency. \n \n2.  Outputs   \n \na.  Medium-Term Policy Objectives and Outputs  \n \n35.  Under the Tenth Plan\u2019s overall policy direction, the EFA core document introduces a \nrange of policy interventions to improve (i) social inclusion and equity of access to education; \n(ii) the quality and relevance of education; and (iii) efficiency and institutional capacity. ESP I\u2019s \nprogram loan will support the continued implementation of these policy interventions. \n \n36.  Social Inclusion and Increased Equity of Access to Education. The policy objective \nis to remove economic, social and cultural barriers to participation in primary education through \ntargeted interventions. An expected policy output is wider access to free primary education. \nAlthough primary education is free as mandated in the Education Act, in practice, direct and \nindirect costs of education are a major economic barrier for poor households. Key interventions \ninclude (i) scholarships17 targeted at the poor, girls, Dalits, vulnerable communities, and children \nwith disabilities; and (ii) prioritized recruitment of female teachers to achieve the target of one \nfemale teacher per primary school. Gender and social equity awareness is included in teacher \ntraining. EFA promotes a more conducive learning environment through the construction and/or \nimprovement of school facilities.    \n \n37.  Improved Quality and Relevance of Education. The policy objective is to improve \nteacher  qualifications,  training  and  deployment;  textbook  and  educational  materials;  and \ncurricula. The expected outputs are improved availability of qualified and trained teachers, more \navailability of relevant educational materials, curricula that meet the learning needs of all, and \nthe introduction of school-based assessment. The Government has made 10 months of in-\nservice teacher training mandatory for all primary teachers. This certificate-based training is \nprovided  through  TEP.  In  addition,  teachers  receive  follow-up  in-service  training.  The \nGovernment is currently reviewing a proposal to secure timely distribution of textbooks. It has \nintroduced a policy that 20% of the curricula should be local content in order to introduce life \nskills and to reflect local needs and culture.   \n \n38.  Improved Efficiency and Institutional Capacity. A major policy shift introduced under \nEFA is the decentralization of school governance. Responsibility for school management has \nbeen gradually transferred to SMCs, with a view to improving quality, efficiency, and institutional \ncapacity. The expected outputs are that SMCs and communities will be better able to plan, \n                                                 \n17 The scholarship covers direct costs such as educational materials, school costs related to hiring additional \nteachers, and indirect costs such as school uniforms.     \n ", "10           \nmanage, and use resources to improve the relevance, quality, and efficiency of education. \nSMCs will be able to take the initiative to improve schools in partnership with the community. \nEmphasis is placed on setting minimum standards for school inputs (both human and physical) \nand outcomes (such as academic achievement and cycle completion rates). These standards \nprovide the basis for school accreditation and performance grants. School development is \nguided  by  school  improvement  plans  (SIP)  that  establish  the  performance  indicators,  and \naccess and quality targets. Schools manage their own resources, including teachers, under an \nelected SMC. SIPs are supported through various types of formula-based school block grants. \nTraining is provided for SMC members, head teachers and community organizations to enable \nthem to access and use resources effectively.  \n \n39.  The formula-based school grant system is a key element of the decentralization policy. \nThe Government intends to transfer 60% of non-salary budget to SMCs as grants by 2009. SIP \nand school grants provide the financial basis for SMCs to plan and manage school affairs. The \nearmarked grants are intended for teacher salaries, free textbooks, and scholarships. Three \ntypes of block grants are provided. General block grants cover administrative costs, basic \nlearning  materials,  and  incentive  grants  to  community-managed  schools.  SIP  grants  are \nallocated to implement SIPs and can cover quality and physical improvement needs, non-salary \nrecurrent costs, capacity development needs, and support for children\u2019s access to and retention \nin  schools.  SIP  grants  are  allocated  according  to  the  number  of  students,  with  additional \nallowance made for Nepal\u2019s relatively backward regions. Performance grants are rewards to \nschools based on performance indicators such as 85% Grade 5 survival rates and 30% of \nfemale or Dalit teachers.   \n \n40.  Another  policy  shift  is  the  provision  of  school  management  responsibility  to  the \ncommunity. Nepal has experimented with community-owned and managed schools (1950\u2013\n1970), state-managed schools (1970\u20132001), and privatized schools (1990\u2013present). In 2001, \nthe  Government  decided  to  return  schools  to  decentralized  community  management  on  a \ngradual and voluntary basis in the hope this would improve quality and help to share costs. \nCommunity-managed  schools  still  receive  grants  for  teacher  salaries  and  other  costs,  but \nmanagement responsibility, including local recruitment of teachers, has been transferred to the \nSMCs. Currently, all permanent and temporary teachers are certified and appointed nationwide \nthrough the Teacher Service Commission. Recently, the Government has taken steps to permit \nteachers to be appointed locally by the SMC. As of December 2005, local school management \nhas been transferred to about 1,700 communities. \n \nb.  EFA Outcome Progress \n \n41.  EFA\u2019s ASIP for FY2007 reports on progress from pre-EFA period to the end of FY 2006 \n(Table 1). There has been significant progress in early childhood development and primary \nschool enrollment, the percentage of qualified teachers, the adult literacy rate, and the literacy \ngender  parity  index.  Efficiency  has  also improved,  demonstrated  by a  net  increase  in the \nsurvival rate to grade 5. A new challenge will be the increase in the intake of over-aged and \nunder-aged children, which is in part due to the massive enrollment campaign begun in 2005. \nThere is room for improvement in the pupil\u2013teacher ratio, although Table 1 does not reveal the \nwide regional disparities. Repetition rates are still high.  \n ", "          11 \nTable 1: EFA Outcomes: Progress and Bottlenecks \nPerformance Indicator   2003  2005  2009 Target \nA.

Expanded Early Childhood Development. EFA addresses the problem of under-age \nenrollment in grade 1. This has led to high repetition rates and has had a significant negative \nimpact on both learning outcomes and system efficiency. EFA aims to increase the percentage \nof new entrants to grade 1 with ECD experience from 8% in 2001 to 60% in 2009. EFA has \nbeen establishing ECD centers in poor areas, developing ECD programs, training facilitators, \nand  building  partnerships  with  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  To  date,  the  gross \nenrollment rate for ECD has increased from 20% to 47%.  \n \n43.  Increased Access to Education for All Children. The second thrust of the EFA is to \nensure that all children, particularly girls, children in difficult circumstances and children from \nethnic minorities, have access to and complete good primary education. A specific objective is \nto increase the NER from 81% in 2001 to 96% in 2009. Enrollment opportunities can be \nimproved through construction and rehabilitation and furnishing of new classrooms. Schools that \nhave not qualified for new permanent classrooms but face high demand are being provided with \ntemporary classrooms. Additional teachers are being deployed to schools with high student-\nteacher ratios. The EFA also finances maintenance of district education offices and resource \ncenters. EFA supports special needs education that caters to children with learning difficulties, \nas part of the inclusive education strategy. Alternative and flexible schooling are provided to \nchildren in remote areas and those who could not join regular school. Social mobilization and \nnetworking with NGOs are conducted to enhance enrollment opportunities for children in difficult \ncircumstances. As result, primary level NER has increased from 84% in 2003 to 87% in 2005.  \n \n44.  Learning Needs of All Children Met. Home-to-school transition support to non-Nepali- \nspeaking children, who constitute about 50% of the children in Nepal, is being piloted in schools \nserving predominantly non-Nepali speaking populations in five districts. In addition, the EFA \nsupports activities that (i) promote primary education in the mother tongue, and (ii) incorporate \nlife skills and local content into the school curriculum. To date, textbooks have been prepared in \nfive major local languages. Furthermore, scholarships, extracurricular activities, and special \nclasses are provided to children with disabilities. EFA also support children who were affected \nby the insurgency through scholarships and counseling, in collaboration with NGOs. \n \n ", "12           \n45.   Improved Adult Literacy. A primary EFA goal is to increase the adult literacy rate (15+ \nyears) from 48% in 2001 to 66% in 2009. At the same time, the goal is to increase the literacy \ngender parity index from 0.6 in 2001 to 0.9 in 2009. To achieve these goals, EFA supports the \nongoing  Women\u2019s  Literacy  Program  and  National  Literacy  Campaign.  It  also  supports \ncommunity learning centers that cater to out-of-school children and neo-literates.18 This includes \nout of school programs targeted at school dropouts with the primary purpose of redirecting them \nto schools. At the end of the EFA, 250,000 children will have benefited from these programs. \nBetween 2003 and 2005, the adult literacy rate has increased from 48% to 55%, and literacy \ngender parity index has increased from 0.6 to 0.72.     \n \n46.   Gender Disparity Eliminated. The gender audit19 of 2002 guides the design of EFA \nactions to eliminate gender disparity. Recruitment of female teachers is being enhanced through \naffirmative action to achieve the target of one female teacher per primary school. Scholarships \nare provided to girls, Dalits, and children from other disadvantaged groups. These scholarships \nbenefit about 650,000 students per year. The EFA has also supported production of a gender-\nsensitive curriculum and teacher training package. A \u201cgirl-friendly\u201d physical environment is being \nenhanced by construction of separate toilets for girls. The NER for girls has increased from 78% \nin 2003 to 84% in 2005 and is increasing more quickly than that for boys. The grade 5 survival \nrate for girls increased from 60% in 2003 to 81% in 2004, but decreased to 76% in 2005. \nHowever,  despite  the  policy  of  prioritizing  female  teacher  recruitment,  there  has  been  no \nsignificant increase in the proportion of female teachers, so further effort is needed.   \n \n47.  All Aspects of Quality Education Improved. Based on the SIP, SMCs in partnership \nwith the community undertake various school improvement activities through earmarked and \nblock grants. The grants cover quality and physical improvement, non-salary recurrent costs, \ncapacity development, and support for children\u2019s access to and retention in schools. Capacity \ndevelopment for SMC members, head teachers and community organizations is being provided. \nIn  addition,  support  is  being  provided  for  the  purchase  of  materials  for  book  corners  in \nclassrooms; research and development activities at the center and in districts, including school-\nbased action research; and piloting of computer education. Teachers are being trained to make \ntheir lessons more relevant to local contexts. The education management information system \n(EMIS) has been strengthened and streamlined to enable rapid monitoring of key outputs and \noutcomes at school and district levels. To date, about 51% of schools (11,920) report that they \nhave  prepared  and  implemented  their  own  SIPs.  The  proportion  of  trained  and  qualified \nteachers has increased from 17% in 2003 to 45% in 2005.   \n \nc.  EFA Review, Monitoring, and Expenditures     \n \n48.  While the EFA core document sets the policy framework and overall strategy for EFA, \nthe ASIP describes progress and sets annual implementation strategies and actions within the \ncontext  of  the  MTEF  and  the  education  sector  business  plan.  The  ASIP  is  based  on  an \nassessment of the past year\u2019s program implementation, emerging issues, and new priorities and \ndirectives. For instance, ASIP FY2007 provides an analysis of implementation status based on \nthe semiannual progress report for 2005 and presents the implementation strategies for the \nforthcoming fiscal year: (i) decentralization; (ii) inclusion; (iii) capacity building; and (iv) conflict \nmitigation and post-conflict reconstruction. The AWPB provides the budgetary framework for the \nimplementation of ASIP. The release of funds is based on the approval of the ASIP, which in \nturn takes into account performance during the previous fiscal year. The ASIP is approved at an \n                                                 \n18 Individuals who have completed a literacy training program and have demonstrated the ability to continue to learn \non their own.   \n19 Koirala, C., Basnet, N. and McCAffery, J. 2002. A Gender Audit of the Basic and Primary Education Programme \u2013 \nII, Nepal. Sanothimi, Bhaktapur: Ministry of Education and Sports, Department of Education. \n ", "          13 \nannual review meeting, during which all EFA development partners conduct a joint review of \nprogress in EFA implementation. Based on the outcomes of the review, the JFA development \npartners agree and commit on the share of funding for the next fiscal year. The joint review \nmission in June 2006 endorsed the ASIP FY 2007, including an annual maximum budgetary \ncontribution of $40 million from the JFA development partners. The ASIP and AWPB for FY2008 \nwill be presented in April/May 2007 and those for FY2009 in April/May 2008. In addition to the \nannual  review,  a  consultative  meeting  is  held  in  December  of  each  year  to  review  the \npreliminary consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year as well as the output \nreports for the first trimester of the current fiscal year.     \n         \n49.  EFA progress is monitored through the regular EMIS at central, district, and school level, \nas well as a system of semi annual progress reports called the Flash Reports that convey \ninformation on progress in key EFA indicators. Flash Report I is based on a survey conducted at \nthe beginning of the school year, while Flash Report II provides information collected at the end \nof  the  school  year.  In  addition,  an  independent  Technical  Review  of  School  Education  is \nconducted annually based on sample of 1,000 schools. Capacity development in EMIS, and \ndata collection for the Flash Reports has been provided through technical assistance from EFA \ndevelopment partners. Measures for expenditure tracking have been also introduced. At school \nlevel, the use of school grants is monitored through internal audits, as well as social audits that \nare conducted by the SMCs. The Government also introduced a public expenditure tracking \nsystem in FY2001.  \n \n50.  Overall, EFA financial progress is satisfactory. However, some activities have been slow, \npartly due to the insurgency. According to the EFA financial monitoring of FY2005, 93.9% of the \ntotal EFA allocation was spent in FY2005, but progress with some activities at district level were \nmuch lower. For instance, 62.1% of the budget allocated for new classroom construction and \nfurniture, and  68.5% of the budget allocated to scholarships for out-of-school children were \nspent.  The  Government  has  explained  that  a  great  deal  of  local  construction  work  was \npostponed  because  of  unrest  and  insecurity.  For  the  same  reason,  the  Government  has \ndiscouraged the purchase of vehicles, despite the budgetary allocation. \n \n    d.  EFA and its Challenges  \n \n51.  The EFA has demonstrated progress and there is confidence among the Government \nand development partners about its future outcomes and impact in the subsector. However, the \nEFA is also a continuously evolving program. The Government and development partners \nrecognize that performance needs to be further improved. During the preparation of ESP I, an \nassessment of EFA implementation was conducted, focusing on equity, social inclusion, and \nfinancial management (Appendix 4).  \n \n52.  The provision of targeted scholarships to the poor, girls, and Dalits is important if equity \nof access is to be increased under EFA. However, the scholarships have been affected by \n(i) delays in the distribution of scholarships to recipients; (ii) an inadequate budget for the \nnumber of eligible children; (iii) scholarships that are too small to cover the cost of schooling; \n(iv) inequities in scholarship application criteria and process, which mean there is a risk that the \nmost needy children are not selected; and (v) the lack of a tracking system to ensure that \nchildren receive scholarships and remain in school. Despite efforts to increase the numbers of \nfemale and Dalit teachers, progress is still slow.           \n \n53.  The  JFA\u2019s  disbursement,  reporting,  monitoring  and  audit  requirements  provide  a \nfinancial control framework that has been in place long enough for the completion of one full \nfiscal year and subsequent audit cycle. Performance over that period by the MOES has been \n ", "14           \ngenerally satisfactory, but areas for improvement were noted . During the joint review mission of \nJune  2006,  a  number  of  issues  were  highlighted  including:  (i)  timeliness  and  accuracy  of \nfinancial monitoring reports (FMR); (ii) the accuracy of the annual report; (iii) school level \nfinancial management, including internal audit and social audit; and (iv) internal controls on \ndisbursement of teacher\u2019s salaries. \n \n54.  To  address  these  weaknesses  in  implementation,  the  capacity  development  grant \ncomponent of ESP I is designed to build capacity at central, district, community, and SMC \nlevels. The midterm review of EFA will reach an understanding on key strategies to strengthen \ncapacity development and ensure that TA from all development partners is well coordinated.  \n \n3.  Important Features  \n \n55.  EFA\u2019s JFA is earmarked budgetary support that is controlled by an agreed reporting \nmechanism. ADB funds provided through the JFA will be strictly devoted to implementing the \nEFA program. In general, the EFA follows government accounting systems. However, the JFA \nalso requires accounting, reporting, and auditing requirements that are acceptable to ADB. It \nrequires annual and semi-annual progress reports detailing expenditures, outputs, outcomes, \nand processes for the period to be produced and submitted to the funding partners. The funding \npartners, including ADB, will review these reports during regular meetings and joint review \nmissions. The JFA is in Supplementary Appendix 1. The main reports are as follows.   \n  \n(i)  The ASIP and AWPB are prepared annually and submitted to the JFA development \npartners at the beginning of each fiscal year. After reviewing this report, the partners \ncommit to their annual contributions. \n \n(ii)  The FMR are a set of financial reports detailing actual expenditures, cash balances \nand cash requirements prepared and submitted to the JFA development partners \nwithin 45 days of the end of each trimester (every 4 months). After reviewing this \nreport,  the  funding  agencies  disburse  funds  based  on  actual  expenditures  and \nforecasted cash requirements. \n \n(iii)  An unaudited annual financial statement is prepared and certified by the financial \ncomptroller general and submitted to the JFA development partners no later than 6 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year. \n \n(iv)  An annual audit of the annual FMR is performed by the Office of the Auditor General \nof Nepal (OAG/N) and submitted to the JFA development partners no later than \n8 months after the end of the fiscal year. \n   \n  4.  Financing Plan  \n \n56.  The Government has requested a program loan of $30 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to support the Government\u2019s policy reforms. The Borrower will be Nepal. The loan will \nhave an amortization period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of \n1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. The program loan amount was determined by factors such \nas: (i) the relative importance of EFA in the education sector in Nepal, and (ii) the financing gap \nwhich impedes achievement of EFA goals. The loan amount meets part of the financing gap.     \n \n \n \n ", "          15 \n5.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n57.  Program Management. MOES is the Executing Agency and DOE is the Implementing \nAgency. ESP I will follow the program management arrangements specified in the JFA. The JFA \ndetails the goals of the EFA; the responsibilities of the Government and the development \npartners;  the  funding  mechanism;  fiduciary  requirements,  including  procurement,  reporting, \nmonitoring and auditing; and other administrative requirements. The JFA development partners \nmeet regularly to review the financial and operational status and progress of the EFA and to \ncommit and disburse funds.  \n \n58.  Implementation Period. ESP I will support the EFA for the remaining 3 fiscal years from \nFY2007 to FY2009. The program period will be from January 2007 to July 2009. Loan closing \ndate will be January 2010. The first tranche will support the last trimester of the ASIP FY2007 \nand the ASIP FY2008. The second tranche will support ASIP FY2009. \n \n59.  Procurement  and  Disbursement.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,20  the \nproceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to Nepal as the Borrower. The loan proceeds \nwill be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items (Appendix 8) and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. No supporting import documentation \nwill be required, if during each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value \nof  total  imports  minus  imports  from  non-member  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of \nthe loan expected to be disbursed during that year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation under existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify \nthe accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. The pooled foreign exchange account (FEA) \njointly held by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MOES will function as the deposit account into \nwhich all withdrawals from the loan account will be deposited. The deposit account will be \nestablished, managed, and liquidated in accordance with terms and conditions satisfactory to \nADB. \n \n60.  Counterpart Funds. The local currency funds generated from the proceeds of the \nprogram  loan  will  be  used  by  the  Government  to  supplement  the  costs  associated  with \nimplementation of existing policy interventions in the education sector.  \n \n61.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to ESP I. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy have been included in the loan regulations for \nthe program loan. As detailed in the EFA's JFA, any JFA development partner, including ADB, \nmay  request  a  performance-related  audit  of  EFA  to  be  carried  out  by  OAG/N  in  close \nconsultation with other JFA development partners. Under the EFA JFA, the JFA development \npartners have agreed to use the existing Government system for disbursement and accounting \nof pooled Government and donor funds. At the time of program preparation, a collective risk \nassessment was conducted by the World Bank in collaboration with the other JFA development \npartners.  Overall  program  risk  was  rated  medium  in  terms  of  financial  management  and \nprogram implementation and the following risk mitigation measures were taken by the MOES. \n \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 1995. Project Administration Instructions. Manila. \n ", "16           \n(i)  To maintain financial management capacity, the Government did not transfer \ncore staff members of the MOF and MOES during the first 2 years. These staff \nmembers had experience working for the EFA\u2019s predecessor project, BPEP II, \nwhich had a similar financial management system, and were well trained.  \n(ii)  The  funds  flow  was  well  defined,  and  a  close  monitoring  mechanism  was \nintroduced to monitor usage and prevent any misuse of funds.   \n(iii)  The  Government  reporting  mechanisms  and  formats  were  assessed  and \nconsidered  adequate.  Government  financial  and  procurement  reports  will \ntherefore be used for financial monitoring and reporting, and semi-annual reports \nwill be used to measure outputs.   \n(iv)  While external audit arrangements by OAG/N were assessed as satisfactory, \ninternal audits were assessed as inadequate in respect of timeliness and quality \nin general. Therefore, the program will strengthen internal audit. \n \n62.  In addition to the measures detailed above, to address other weaknesses identified in \nthe  financial  management  assessment  and  to  further  strengthen  capacity  of  MOES,  the \nGovernment and JFA development partners agreed on the financial management improvement \nplan detailed in Table 2.  \n \n \nTable 2: Financial Management and Anticorruption Measures \n \n     \n \nArea    Measures \n \nStrengthen financial  -  Financial  consultants  to  support  DOE  in  maintaining  computerized \nmanagement capacity at  accounts information      \nthe DOE  -  Training on financial management and procurement twice a year for cost   \ncenter staff (including FCGO, DTCO and other agency staff)    \n \n \nDevelop a financial  -  Agreement with OAG/N on TOR for the audit for the Program \nmanagement framework  -  Auditors\u2019 training on key elements of subsector program   \nat the subsector Level   \n   \nStrengthen financial  -  Establish  a  combined  EFA  Program  Monitoring  Committee  and  Audit \n \nmanagement capacity at  Follow-Up Committee chaired by the Secretary, MOES.

The TA for the Education Sector Development Policy and Strategy (ESDPS, para.19) \nidentified two critical areas requiring capacity development: (i) policy formulation, coordination, \nreview and follow-up; and (ii) preparation of a core document to guide 1\u201312 school restructuring \nand  reform.  Following  this  TA,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  continue  to  provide \nassistance in these areas under the proposed Capacity Development Project (the Project). In \naddition, the proposed Project will include capacity development in EFA implementation in \nspecific areas identified during ESP I preparation. \n \n65.  Over 3 years, the Project will develop the capacity of MOES and other key stakeholders \nat central, regional, and district level to prepare for 1\u201312 school reform and restructuring. To \nprepare and facilitate a smooth transition to the integrated 1\u201312 school system, the Government \nhas  established  a  structure  for  education  policy  functions  through  the  education  policy \ncommittee (EPC) and has developed a concept paper that broadly describes the 1-12 school \nsector reform agenda. Based on the concept paper, a core document to guide the transition to \nthe  1\u201312  school  system  will  be  prepared.  The  expected  Project  outcomes  are:  (i) \ninstitutionalized  policy  review,  formulation,  coordination and  follow-up  functions;  (ii)  broadly \naccepted  and  financed  1\u201312  school  system  reform  and  restructuring  program,  for \nimplementation by FY2010; (iii) a realigned legislative, governance, management, and financing \nstructure  appropriate  for  1\u201312  school  system  by  FY2010;  and  (iv)  further  improved \nimplementation of policy interventions under EFA.    \n  \n2.  Project Component and Outputs   \n \na.  Capacity Development in Policy Functions \n \n66.  The ESDPS TA found that, as of 2004, Nepal had 215 inconsistent policy statements on \nschool  education.  For  example,  school  improvement  functions  were  allocated  to  school \nmanagement committees by statute, while decision-making authority and resources for quality \ninputs  were  allocated  to  central  level  institutions  by  executive  order.  This  abundance  of \neducation policy statements is a result of policy formulation functions being allocated to 15 \ncentral level committees, each dealing with specific areas. MOES is aware that, for policy-led \nreform and restructuring of the education sector, a strong policy analysis, formulation, and \nfollow-up  function  within  the  Government  is  essential.  MOES  has  therefore  formed  the \neducation policy committee (EPC), chaired by the Minister of Education and Sports.  \n \n67.  The functions of the EPC include: (i) formulation of education policies; (ii) coordination of \npolicies in education and other related sectors; (iii) follow up on the implementation and impact \nof policies and feedback from the stakeholders; and (iv) policy review based on findings of \nresearch, study, and stakeholder consultations. EPC membership includes key partners in the \neducational policy and program development process, including the MOF, the Ministry of Local \nDevelopment, the National Planning Commission, and the Ministry of Women, Children and \nSocial Welfare. Representation from the Women and Dalit Commissions will ensure that social \ninclusion remains a key aspect of education policy formulation. Academic and other professional \norganizations are also represented.  \n \n68.  The Project will support the EPC to facilitate the decision-making process. A core group \nof senior officials from MOES and DOE will be formed to identify emerging issues resulting out \nof policy actions, analyze possible responses, and organize stakeholder consultations. The core \n ", "18           \ngroup will be assisted by a resource pool of educational experts to prepare briefing notes for the \nEPC meetings. The policy analysis and programming section (PAPS) of the MOES will serve as \nthe technical secretariat of the EPC. Terms of references of the technical secretariat have been \napproved by the EPC in August 2006. \n \n69.  The  Project  will  support  the  EPC,  the  technical  secretariat,  and  PAPS  through \nconsultancy services, staff development, procurement of equipment, studies, and stakeholder \nconsultations. A refurbished policy resource room with information technology (IT) equipment \nwill be established to make research materials and other documents easily available to the core \ngroup, the pool of experts, and EPC members. A policy database and electronic library will be \nestablished and  technical personnel will be deployed. Three full-time members of staff will be \nseconded to the PAPS. Long-term international and domestic education policy experts (the \npolicy advisers) will be provided on an intermittent basis, as well as domestic experts. The EPC \nwill be provided with resources to commission policy research and analysis.   \n  \n70.  The Project will support staff development programs, including three regional visits to \nshare experiences with counterparts in the Asia region, an attachment program in Asia for three \ntechnical secretariat officials to upgrade their knowledge and skills, and three in-country training \ncourses in areas such as policy analysis, research, and computer skills. A peer review program \nfor core group members will enable them to share experiences with counterparts in the region. \nThe Project will also support consultations between EPC and stakeholders, including parents, \nSMC members, and civil society representatives. Seminars and round tables will allow policy \nmakers an opportunity to look at the policy issues from several angles and perspectives. A \nparticipatory democratic process for policy formulation will enhance the prospects of wider \npublic  acceptance.  It  will  also  help  ensure  relatively  smooth  transition  to  full-scale \nimplementation of the policy decisions. \n \n71.  The expected outputs of this subcomponent are: (i) the EPC is institutionalized within the \nMOES system; (ii) an effective technical support structure is in place within MOES to facilitate \nthe  task  of  the  EPC;  (iii)  a  participatory  democratic  process  and  environment  for  policy \ndevelopment is established; and (iv) skilled and knowledgeable human resources are built up \nfor policy functions within MOES.  \n \n    b.  Preparation of Core Document for the 1\u201312 School System  \n \n72.  The concept paper for the 1\u201312 school system developed by MOES was approved by \nthe EPC in October 2006. The concept paper provides policy directions on structural and \nfunctional adjustments for grades 1-8 basic education and grades 9-12 secondary education, \nand a basis for the preparation of the core document for the 1\u201312 system. The purposes of the \ncore document are to: (i) create a foundation document that will guide education reform and \nrestructuring,  beginning  in  FY2010;  (ii)  translate  policy  directions  into  operational  program \nactivities with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities for implementers at each level; \n(iii) propose strategic choices for reforms that address persistent challenges, such as increasing \naccess to good-quality education, particularly for girls, the poor, and marginalized children, and \nimproving  the  relevance  of  primary  and  secondary  education  for  economic  and  social \ndevelopment; (iv) suggest specific measures for school system restructuring to improve system-\nwide  efficiency  of  governance,  management,  and  financing,  and  assure  accountability  for \nfulfilling responsibilities at all levels; (v) propose a sector development strategy with an in-built \nmechanism for incorporating emerging issues into the reform and restructuring program; and \n(vi) provide development partners with options for partnership. Appendix 9 describes the 1-12 \nschool sector reform agenda based on the approved concept paper and tentative policy actions \nfor ESP II and ESP III.  \n ", "          19 \n73.  The core document will serve as a policy and planning guide for gradual introduction of \nthe  1\u201312  integrated  system.  It  will  clarify  Government  commitments  with  respect  to  the \nprovision, promotion, and appraisal of educational services within the framework of the 1\u201312 \nsystem.  Major  strategies  relating  to  standards  of  services  and  performance  (such  as \nmanagement, financing, legal and the regulatory framework) will be detailed in the document. \nThe core document will describe operational procedures for delivering school education of an \nacceptable quality, in partnership with the community and civil society. It will contain details of \nprograms, the financing framework, and implementation. \n \n74.  The  core  document  will  contain  a  proposal  to  implement  phased  reform  and \nrestructuring.  At  each  phase,  implementation  will  be  carefully  monitored  and  lessons \nincorporated into implementation plans for subsequent phases. A financing plan will include \nproposed  financing  strategies  and  will  provide  the  economic  rationale  for  reforms  and \nrestructuring and financing options. It will also propose changes to the financing framework. The \nCore  Document  will  identify  changes  needed  to  governance,  financing,  planning  and \nmanagement systems.  Adjustments needed that go beyond the purview of the MOES will be \nidentified and a timetable prepared for making proposed changes.   \n \n75.  By the end of FY2007, the draft core document should have been widely disseminated. \nBy  the  end  of  FY2008,  it  should  have  been  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  the  development \npartners,  including  ADB.  A  draft  amendment  to  the  Education  Law  will  be  finalized  and \nsubmitted to the Ministry of Law for approval, and executive and financial guidelines will be \ndrafted by FY2009. By end of FY2009, the adjustments that have been made to the legislative, \nexecutive, and financial structure should allow the Government to begin implementation of a 1\u2013\n12 school system in FY2010.     \n \n76.  The major activities in the preparation of the core document are briefly described below. \n \n(i)  Directional  policy  framework.  The  EPC  will  provide  directions  for  the \npreparation of the core document. The core group will organize round table \ndiscussions internally at MOES and externally with stakeholders. On the basis of \na technical note prepared by the core group, the EPC will finalize the policy \ndirections for the core document and guide its preparation. \n(ii)  Core  document  preparation  terms  of  reference  (TOR).  The  technical \nsecretariat will coordinate and organize the preparation of the core document. \nWithin  the  directional  policy  framework  provided  by  the  EPC,  the  technical \nsecretariat will prepare terms of reference. \n(iii)   Appointment  of  core  document  preparation  team.  EPC  will  appoint  the \ncoordinator and members of the core document preparation team. The team will \ninclude seven thematic working groups: governance and management, gender \nand  social  inclusion,  quality  and  relevance,  financing,  regulatory  framework, \nsupervision and monitoring, and evaluation and examination. \n(iv)  Support  from  development  partners.  The  technical  secretariat  will  enable \ndevelopment partners to cooperate in and to support preparation of the core \ndocument. \n(v)  Core  document  preparation  process.  The  process  of  preparing  the  core \ndocument  will  include:  (a)  wide  consultation  with  stakeholders  in  different \ncontexts;  (b)  a  public  hearing;  (c)  small  thematic  studies  on  such  areas  as \nmanagement, financing, legal, programmatic and implementation concerns; (d) a \nround  table  discussion  on  the  design  and  details  of  the  core  document; \n(e) technical and professional consultations at various stages of core document \n ", "20           \npreparation; and (f) peer review of the core document by counterparts in the \nregion. \n \n77.  The Project will support preparation of the core document through consultancy services, \nsupport for stakeholder consultations at regional, district, and school cluster levels, in-country \ntraining, and peer review from elsewhere in the region. The policy advisers and other national \nconsultants working in thematic areas will help the MOES to plan, prepare for, and implement \nthe major steps. Activities will include writing background papers and conducting field visits on \nspecific thematic areas such as governance, management, quality assurance, gender and social \ninclusion, school restructuring, and school financing. In preparation for the phased implementation \nof the 1\u201312 program, the consultants will assist MOES to undertake a needs assessment and to \nhold capacity development workshops and seminars in at least three districts.  \n \n78.  The Project will support school and teacher mapping in at least 30 districts. Studies will \nbe commissioned on minimum standards, examination reform, and local curriculum content. \nThe Project will support teacher workshops and training packages to increase local content in \nthe curriculum, improve teaching, and reform the examination system.  \n \nc.  Capacity Development in EFA Implementation \n \n79.  National consultants will be provided to DOE through the EPC\u2019s technical secretariat to \naddress  weaknesses  identified  during  ESP  I  preparation.  Their  areas  of  specialization  will \ninclude: gender and social inclusion, and financial management and reporting. To maximize \nconsultant inputs and harmonize technical assistance with other development partners, the \ngender specialist will work with the EFA vulnerable communities development working group \nand the financial management specialist will work with the financial management task force, \nboth of which are composed of DOE and development partner representatives. Consultants will \nalso help to prepare the EFA midterm review and follow up on its key recommendations.  \n \n  3.  Important Features  \n \n80.   While prolonging the basic school cycle from 5 to 8 years helps to prepare children for \nmore productive and socially responsible lives, it carries with it serious financial, technical and \ninstitutional risks. Problems with providing equitable access to quality education still plague the \ncurrent system. A rush into 1\u201312 school sector reform and restructuring without a systematic \nanalysis of the fundamental sector issues, broad stakeholder consultations and reflection, and an \nin-depth analysis of the country\u2019s financial capacity to undertake and to sustain such a reform runs \nthe risk of committing the Government to a course of action that it cannot sustain, or worse, that \noffers most children 8 or 12 years of sub-standard public education. Hence, ESP I and the grant \nProject  will  continue  to  develop  the  capacity  of  key  stakeholders  in  policy  analysis  and \nformulation, stakeholder consultation, and sector-wide program development, including financial \nplanning. ESP I will pay particular attention to the need for a phased approach to the reform and \nrestructuring process.  \n \n  4.  ADF IX Grant Financing  \n \n81.  Under an ADF IX resolution,21 Nepal is eligible for ADF grant financing of up to 50% of \nthe total assistance program under category B of the ADF IX grants allocation framework. The \ngrant will be used to: (i) establish and strengthen education policy formulation and coordination \nfunctions; (ii) prepare an integrated 1\u201312 school system reform and restructuring plan; and \n                                                 \n21  Eighth Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund and Third Regularized Replenishment of the Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (ADF IX Resolution). \n ", "          21 \n(iii) develop stakeholder capacity to improve implementation of EFA. Grant effectiveness will be \nassessed within the context of the overall program and project performance. The Project has a \nclear milestone: a broadly accepted and financed 1\u201312 school system reform and restructuring \nprogram ready for implementation by FY2010.    \n   \n5.  Financing Plan  \n \n82.  The Project will have a total cost of $2.3 million equivalent. It is proposed that ADB \nprovide a grant of $2.0 million in various currencies equivalent in special drawing rights (SDR) \nfrom its Special Funds resources. The beneficiary of the grant will be Nepal. ADB financing will \nbe used to finance the costs relating to consulting services, training, workshops and meetings, \nand a portion of project operation and maintenance. Procurement of equipment, and goods, and \nstudies will be financed through consulting services. The Government\u2019s contribution of $300,000 \nincludes counterpart staff salaries and other costs, and office expenses. Project cost estimates \nare presented in Table 3 and the financing plan is in Table 4.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n83.  Project Management. MOES will be the Executing Agency for the Project, and the \ntechnical secretariat of the EPC will be the focal point. Within 1 month of grant effectiveness, a \nproject steering committee (PSC) chaired by the Secretary MOES, will be established. The PSC \nwill comprise: Joint Secretary, Planning Division, MOES; Joint Secretary, School Administration \nDivision,  MOES;  the  heads  of  the  Department  of  Education,  the  Curriculum  Development \nCenter, the Non-formal Education Center, the Office of the Controller of Examinations, and the \nNational Center for Educational Development; and the Under Secretary of the Foreign Aid \nCoordination Section of MOES. The Under Secretary of the PAPS will act as the member-\nsecretary. Other members, including the donor contact point, can be invited as observers. The \nPSC will be responsible for (i) approving the annual work plan and budget; (ii) conducting \nproject reviews on a trimester basis; (iii) preparing project performance reports; (iv) providing \nguidance to the technical secretariat on project implementation; and (v) coordinating inputs, in \nparticular consulting services, with other development partners. The Joint Secretary, Planning \n ", "22           \nDivision, MOES will be the Project Director, and will be in charge of the day-to-day management \nand implementation of the Project. The Project Director will report to the PSC, and will be \nassisted by the technical secretariat and consultants. \n \n84.  Implementation Period. The Project will be implemented over 3 years from January \n2007  to  December  2009.  The  grant  closing  date  will  be  June  2010.  The  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 11.   \n \n85.  Consulting Services. The selection and engagement of all consulting services to be \nfinanced  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. The Project will finance 9 person-months of international and 112 person-months \nof national consulting services. The consultants will be selected by ADB, and engaged and \nsupervised by MOES. To retain some flexibility in the timing of the consultants\u2019 mobilization, up \nto  five  consultants  at  central  level  may  be  selected  and  contracted  as  individuals.  One \ninternational education policy analyst (9 person-months), a domestic education chief policy \nadviser  (12  person-months),  and  a  domestic  education  policy  and  program  specialist  (36 \nperson-months) who have been previously working with MOES core group in policy analysis \nand formulation under the ESDPS TA, will be recruited through single source selection to serve \nas policy advisers. Single source selection takes in account the experience the consultants have \nacquired  in  the  complex  education  policy  formulation  process  in  Nepal  and  the  continued \ntransfer of knowledge to MOES counterparts. As medium- to long-term education reform is a \ndifficult task, it is essential to ensure continuity in the technical approach to the Project. These \nexperts were engaged under the ESDPS TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  have  accumulated  considerable  practical  knowledge  of  these  areas.  Two \nindividual domestic experts in thematic areas will be engaged. The timeframe and the specific \nthematic area will be decided jointly by MOES and ADB.    \n \n86.   Three packages of consultancy services, estimated to cost no more than $600,000 \neach, will be engaged. Package A supports activities at the central level and aims to (i) develop \nthe capacity of the MOES in formulating and coordinating policy and strategy; (ii) support the \ndevelopment  of  a  core  document  for  the  1\u201312  school  system;  and  (iii)  support  capacity \ndevelopment for EFA implementation in key areas. It includes provision of approximately 50 \nperson-months of national consultants, approximately 50 stakeholder consultations, four study \nvisits, three short-term training courses in the Asia region, three in-country training sessions, \nand 20 policy research studies. The package includes also 36 person-months equivalent of \nproject administration and accounting support. Package B provides IT support to EPC, the \ntechnical secretariat, and the regional education directorates and includes an IT network, a \nmulti-media system, computers, servers for the technical secretariat and the policy resource \nroom, and an IT network for the regional education directorates to prepare for decentralization \nof examination functions. Package B includes refurbishment of the technical secretariat and the \npolicy resource room, about 14 person months of domestic IT professionals, and training and \nmaintenance. Package A and B consultants will be engaged through a firm using the quality and \ncost-based selection method. Package C will undertake school and teacher mapping in about \n30 districts. Single source selection will be used for this package as Tribhuvan University has \nbeen identified as the only institution specifically qualified for the task. Immediate engagement \nafter the project approval is essential for the entire successful implementation of the project. The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 12 and indicative terms of reference for consultants are in \nSupplementary Appendix 2.    \n \n87.  Procurement The consultants recruited under the Project (package B) will procure the \nIT-related equipment, and the goods required for the refurbishment of the technical secretariat \nand the policy resource room in accordance with the ADB's Procurement Guidelines. The \n ", "          23 \nshopping  method  will  be  used  for  procurement  of  goods  of  less  than  $100,000  for  each \npackage, and limited international bidding will be used for procurement of goods over $100,000. \n \n88.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to and discussed with \nthe  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  have  been  included  in  the  grant \nregulations. During regular review missions, governance and anticorruption risk assessments \nwill be updated as necessary. \n \n89.  The Project has specific elements to reduce vulnerability to corruption.  \n \n(i)  Consultants, while contracted and managed by the MOES, will be selected by \nADB using its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n(ii)  Consulting package A contains a provision for project administration support to \nassist MOES to administer the project. This includes qualified accounting staff to \nmonitor disbursements, help prepare project accounts, and report to the auditors \nas well as ADB. MOES counterparts will receive training at ADB\u2019s procurement \nand disbursement seminars conducted by the Resident Mission.  \n(iii)  To  promote  good  governance,  transparency,  and  participation,  MOES  will \nprovide public information on project implementation, including information on \nprocurement, through stakeholder consultations and public information services. \nStakeholders will be periodically informed of project\u2019s progress and the use of \nfunds.  \n(iv)  Periodical  project  reviews  conducted  by  MOES  and  ADB  will  include  an \nexamination of budgetary allocations for the Project, operation and maintenance \ncosts,  staffing  and  other  incremental  recurrent  costs,  implementation \narrangements and achievements under the Project.  The review shall include \nassessing  Project  progress,  identifying  difficulties  and  constraints,  and \ndetermining ways to overcome them.         \n \n90.  Advance  Contracting  Action.  Given  the  need  for  the  Project  to  begin  operating \nimmediately after grant effectiveness, MOES has asked to take advance action to expedite \nproject implementation, particularly by short-listing firms to provide consultancy services and to \nrecruit  individual  consultants.  This  advance  action  will  apply  only  until  evaluation  of  bids. \nContract awards and signing of agreements will take place only after grant effectiveness. ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence with advance actions does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n91.  Disbursement Arrangements. MOES will be responsible for preparing disbursement \nprojections and for requesting budgetary allocations for counterpart funds. All disbursements will \nbe made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. To ensure the timely release \nof the grant, an imprest account will be established at the Nepal Rastra Bank. The initial amount \nwill be no more than 6-months\u2019 projected disbursements or 10% of the total grant, whichever is \nless. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest account in accordance with its \nloan disbursement guidelines. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the \nSOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $10,000. MOES will coordinate the timely \nrelease of funds. It is expected that MOES will use the imprest account to conduct activities \nsuch as stakeholder consultations, teacher workshops, development of training packages, and \nother activities. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit the use of the imprest account and SOE \n ", "24           \nprocedures. A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures \nwill be included in the annual audit report. \n   \n92.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. The Government, acting through MOES, will \nmaintain records and accounts adequate to identify goods and services financed from the grant. \nMOES will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project, and ensure that accounts \nand financial statements are audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. In addition to the \nyearly financial audit, performance audit(s) will be conducted by auditors acceptable to ADB to \nreview the effectiveness of the outputs and activities, including procurements made under this \nProject.  The  auditor\u2019s  report  and  copies  of  the  certified  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements, including the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the grant, will be submitted to ADB in \nEnglish not later than 6 months after the close of the Government\u2019s fiscal year. MOES will \nprepare reports on the status and progress of project implementation and submit them to ADB \nwithin 30 days of the end of each trimester. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB \nand will indicate (i) progress made against established targets, (ii) progress made against \nperformance indicators, (iii) problems encountered and actions taken to address them, and \n(iv) a proposed program of activities for the following quarter. Within 3 months of the Project\u2019s \nphysical  completion,  MOES  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report \ndescribing project implementation, accomplishments, benefits, impacts, and costs. \n  \n93.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. To harmonize with EFA reporting, \nthe Government will include an operational plan in every ASIP which will include: (i) project \nactivities with cost estimates proposed for each project subcomponent and performance targets; \n(ii) a breakdown of financial requirements; and (iii) details of how project activities are to be \nintegrated into other ongoing programs. \n \n94.  Project Review. MOES and ADB will periodically review project implementation. The \nreviews will include evaluation of progress in the preparing the core document for the 1\u201312 \nschool system, implementation arrangements, progress in legislative, executive and financial \nactions, use of funds under the project, and capacity development measures. A midterm review \nwill be conducted not later than 18 months after grant effectiveness, and a project completion \nreview will be conducted not later than 12 months after the end of the Project.  \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Program Benefits and Impacts  \n \n  95.  Sectoral Benefits and Impacts. ESP I will benefit children, youth, and adults of Nepal, \nparticularly those groups which have been denied a quality and affordable education in the past. \nIt will help achieve the six EFA goals by meeting part of the financing gap and by providing \ntechnical advice and capacity development to improve EFA implementation. Education policy \nfunctions will be strengthened, and policy decisions will be better coordinated. Based on a \nthorough  policy  framework,  a  technically  sound  and  financially  sustainable  program  and \nfinancing framework for developing the school system will be prepared. That will ensure that \nfuture policy decisions and restructuring in education governance, management, and finance \nwill bring the appropriate outcomes desired for a holistic school system and improved sector \nperformance. The overall expected impact of ESP I interventions is sound and stable progress \ntoward a more equitable and effective education system is anticipated.          \n \n96.  Economic  Benefits.  ESP  I  will  contribute  to  improved  sector  performance.  Lower \nschool repetition and drop out rates, and better SLC results will reduce education wastage, and \nimprove  internal  and  external  efficiency.  As  the  Government  cannot  afford  to  increase  its \n ", "          25 \neducation expenditure significantly, there is need for continued external support for the sector \nfor at least the medium term. Investment in primary and secondary education is crucial to \nreduce persistent poverty and inequality, and will help bring social and political stability, which \nincreases the economic returns from such an investment in the long run. \n        \n97.  Social Benefits and Poverty Impact. The education benefits and impacts of ESP I will \nalso generate social benefits among socially and economically disadvantaged groups. Better \naccess to an affordable and quality education, and better learning achievements will ensure that \nthese groups are able to generate the necessary human and social capital to build economically \nand socially responsible lives. A shift to an egalitarian and inclusive education system will help \nto relieve the root causes of conflict and social tension, build social cohesion, and contribute to \nsocial stability. Improved access to post-primary and basic education for girls and women will \nenhance  women\u2019s  roles  in  the  political,  economic,  and  social  spheres.  The  ASIP  FY2006 \nemphasizes inclusion, conflict mitigation and post-conflict reconstruction, ESP I will contribute \nimmediately to intensifying the role of education in peace building. \n   \n98.  Institutional  Benefits.  As  ESP  I  adopts  the  PBA,  transaction  costs  will  be  lower, \nbenefiting MOES and DOE. The institutional capacity for program implementation, financial \nmanagement, and donor coordination at MOES and DOE will increase. The use of PBA in \neducation will have a demonstration effect on other sectors. Policy making at MOES will be \nstrengthened. By joining the JFA, ADB will maximize its contribution to the education sector and \nincrease its leverage in policy dialogue and technical matters.  \n \nB.  Program Risks  \n \n99.  Overall Program Readiness and Risks. EFA is a high Government priority and a well-\nestablished program, so the implementation risk is low. As the security situation has improved, \nthe EFA will be able to reach the poor and disadvantaged communities in the former conflict-\naffected areas. A potential financial risk is that an existing development partner may decide not \nto continue. However, this risk is considered small because the current development partners \nhave been consistent in their support for Nepal\u2019s education sector. Should any financing gap \nemerge in the final years of the program, stricter financial planning and more modest annual \nprogram targets will be needed. MOES can manage such risk through contingency planning. \nThe preparation of and transition to a 1\u201312 school system entails risks that are typical of an \ninnovative reform process: (i) difficulties and delays in reaching a broad consensus among \nstakeholders and the development partners about the reform and restructuring agenda; and (ii) \nthe risk that the reform process may be disrupted by the emerging sociopolitical issues or \nchanges in senior personnel. Strong conceptual leadership will be required from MOES.  \n \n100.  Political and Social Risks. The political environment could affect ESP I by distracting \nprogram implementation. Overall, however, the historic peace agreement of November 2006 \nprovides  grounds  for  considerable  optimism.  If,  as  the  country  operations  business  plan \npredicts, the economy can grow more rapidly and spending on security can be reduced, the \nGovernment should be able to increase expenditure on education. However, peace building and \nreconstruction will be a potentially fragile process that entails political risk. \n \n101.  Fiduciary Risks. The most recent update of Nepal\u2019s country financial accountability \nassessment (CFAA), carried out in May 2005 by the World Bank and the Department for \nInternational Development (DFID) of the UK,22 concluded that, despite some progress since the \nlast full CFAA in 2002, significant issues remain and Nepal\u2019s overall fiduciary risk is still high. \nHowever, while EFA uses the Government system, JFA provides an alternative framework with \n                                                 \n22 DFID and World Bank. 2005.  Nepal\u2019s Country Financial Accountability Assessment. Katmandu (May).  \n ", "26           \nappropriate fiscal controls. While the performance by the MOES can be improved (para. 53), \nregular monitoring by the JFA development partners will ensure that MOES performance is in \nline with the conditions of the EFA\u2019s JFA. During the preparation of ESP I, MOF and the \ndevelopment  partners  reaffirmed  the  Government  commitment  to  take  steps  to  improve \nperformance. Overall, ESP I has appropriate fiscal controls to ensure that funds are spent for \ntheir intended purpose.    \n \n102.  Safeguard  Measures.  ESP  I  will  have  positive  impacts  on  socially  disadvantaged \ngroups, including girls, indigenous people, and ethnic minorities. A summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 13. A vulnerable communities development framework is in \nSupplementary Appendix 4. The framework supports implementation and monitoring of the \ncurrent EFA vulnerable community development plan. In the EFA, additional classrooms are \nbeing  constructed  to  accommodate  increasing  enrollment  and  prevent  overcrowding  within \nexisting  primary  school  compounds.  Normally,  school  sites  are  located  in  areas  already \napproved for such purposes. No significant adverse environmental impacts are anticipated in \nthis program. An environmental impact assessment is in Supplementary Appendix 5. ESP I will \ninclude  new  construction  and  upgrading  of  existing  facilities.  Since  these  activities  will  be \nconducted at existing school sites, ESP I is unlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement \npolicy. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n103.  The Program Loan. In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given \nthe following specific assurances, which have been incorporated in the draft Loan Agreement: \n \n(i)  the Government will ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken prior to \nthe date of the Loan Agreement, as described in the Development Policy Letter, \nwill continue in effect for the duration of the Program; \n(ii)  the  Government  will  promptly  adopt  the  other  policies  and  take  the  actions \ncontained in the policy matrix and Loan Agreement, ensure that such policies \nand actions continue in effect for the duration of the ESP I, and ensure the \nsustainability of the reforms beyond the program period; \n(iii)  MOES and DOE will implement, manage, coordinate and monitor the Program in \naccordance  with  the  goals,  responsibilities,  funding  mechanism,  fiduciary \nrequirements, and other Program management arrangements as set out in the \nEFA core document and agreed in the EFA JFA; \n(iv)  MOES  will  implement  and  manage  the  Program  in  accordance  with  the \nvulnerable communities development framework agreed upon between MOES \nand ADB;  \n(v)  no activities under the Program will entail land acquisition or other resettlement \nactivities under ADB\u2019s Resettlement Policy; and  \n(vi)  throughout the Program Period, the budget allocations for education shall remain \nat least at the level of FY2007, while all efforts will be made to increase the \nbudget allocation. \n \n104.  The Grant. In addition, the Government has given the following assurances in relation to \nthe implementation of the Project, which have been incorporated in the draft Grant Agreement. \n \n ", "          27 \n(i)  MOES  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart  staff  and  financing,  needed  to \nimplement the Project, will be provided, as well as sufficient office space for the \nconsultants; \n(ii)  in carrying out the measures and activities included in the policy matrix for the \nProgram, MOES will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations \nprovided under the Project; \n(iii)  MOES will take all appropriate and necessary measures in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s rules and regulations to ensure that all staff that have received \ntraining under the Project shall stay in their position throughout the duration of \nthe Project and work full-time on policy formulation, coordination and follow-up; \nand \n(iv)  within  one  month  of  Grant  effectiveness  MOES  will  identify  the  staff  to  be \nassigned fulltime for Project implementation. Such staff will be in place within \nthree months of Grant effectiveness. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n105.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the program cluster of $65,000,000 for the Education Sector Program in Nepal; \n \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 20,432,000 to \nNepal  for  the  Education  Sector  Program  Subprogram  1  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard; and \n \n(iii)  the grant of $2,000,000 to Nepal for the Capacity Development Project from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, in accordance with the terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda  \nPresident \n \n7 November 2006 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "28          Appendix 1 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Nepal Education System and its Outcomes   \n \n1.  In 1951, there was space in Nepal primary and secondary schools for only 10,000 \nchildren.  By  2005  about  6  million  children  were  enrolled  in  public  primary  and  secondary \nschools and about 430,000 children were in private schools. About 87% of the school age \npopulation now attends primary school (grades 1\u20135), 46.5% at lower secondary (grades 6\u20138), \n32% at secondary (grades 9\u201310), and 13% at higher secondary (grades 11\u201312). There is an \nincreasing demand for post-primary education. The average annual growth rate for the number \nof primary schools during 1995\u20132005 was 2.5%, for lower secondary it was 5.3%, and for \nsecondary it was 6.6%. However, despite these remarkable achievements, access to education \nvaries greatly by region, income, gender, ethnicity, and caste, and there is a lack of quality and \nefficiency at all levels of public education.   \n \n2.  About 15% of students enrolled in grade 1 are under-age, and 24% of the grade repeats \nthe  year.  Although  survival  rates  have  improved  over  the  years,  20%  of  students  do  not \ncomplete primary school. Less than 50% of the students who begin primary school enter lower \nsecondary school and even fewer enter higher secondary school. Gender, caste, and ethnic \ndisparities in enrollments increase with the level of education, and poverty plays a key role. Only \n5% of secondary students and less than 1% of university students are from the lowest income \nquintile. Dalit girls have the poorest performance at all levels. \n \n3.  The  public  education  system  is  ineffective.  Students  answer  less  than  one-half  of \nanswers correctly in grade 3 and grade 5 achievement tests. The pass rate for students from \npublic schools in the grade 10 school leaving certificate (SLC) exam have ranged from 25% to \n35% over the past decade. In 2004, SLC pass rates improved to 46%. However, while 82% of \nprivate school students pass SLC examinations only 34.6% of public school students do so. The \nlow achievement of public school students is generally attributed to lack of inputs: inadequately \ntrained teachers, long delays in the delivery of textbooks and learning materials, shortages of \nteachers in some areas, inadequate funding, and delayed provision of funding to schools. \n \nB.  Education Governance and Management  \n \n4.  Nepal has experimented with community-owned and managed schools (1950\u20131970), \nstate-managed  schools  (1970\u20132001),  and  privatized  schools  (1990\u2013present).  In  2001  the \nGovernment decided to return schools to community management on a gradual and voluntary \nbasis, in the hope this would improve their quality and help to share costs. In 2005, there were \nabout 1,700 community-managed schools. There are three types of schools in Nepal: aided \ncommunity  schools,  un-aided  community  schools,  and  institutional  (private)  schools.  While \naided community schools receive government funds for teachers\u2019 salaries and other operational \ncosts, until recently un-aided community schools received funds only for operational costs. \nHowever, they now receive grants to enable them to hire two teachers per school. Aided \ncommunity schools still receive grants for teachers\u2019 salaries, but management responsibility, \nincluding recruitment of teachers, has been transferred to the school management committee \n(SMC).  \n \n5.  Most governance functions (policy, finance, strategy, and standards) are carried out at \nthe national level. Resources are transferred from the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) \ndirectly to schools. MOES also monitors school performance and performs fiduciary functions. \nThere is no independent assessment of school governance unless communities are able to \n ", "Appendix 1          29 \nmobilize social audits. Schools are managed by the district education offices (DEOs) who report \nto the central level; by district education committees (DECs) and village or municipal education \ncommittees  (VECs)  that  report  to  local  governments;  and  by  SMCs  that  report  to  their \ncommunities. The school system is managed by the Department of Education (DOE), through \nthe DEOs. DEOs work through resource persons in resource centers, which provide monitoring \nand professional support to a cluster of 10\u201325 primary schools. DEOs are responsible for \nensuring the flow of funds to schools for salaries as well as for the distribution of provisions such \nas textbooks and teacher training activities. They are also responsible for preparing expenditure \nand output reports every 4 months and education management information system (EMIS) \nreports twice a year. DEOs also prepare an annual district education plan (DEP) and a budget \nthat is reviewed in the MOES.   \n \n6.  In  2005,  there  were  about  125,700  teachers  in  grades  1\u201312.  All  permanent  and \ntemporary teachers are certified and appointed nationwide by the Teacher Service Commission. \nRecently, the MOES has taken steps to permit teachers to be appointed locally by the SMC. \nInterventions to improve the effectiveness and management of the teaching service have been \ncarried out since the 1990s and have led to improvements. Teacher absenteeism, a major \nproblem in the past, was reduced. In 2005, the percentage of fully trained primary teachers was \n44.8% at the primary level (versus 11.8% in 2000), 41.9% at lower secondary (versus 22.6% in \n2000), and 65.4% at secondary (versus 43.1% in 2000).  \n \nC.  Policy Trends  \n \n7.  For the past 50 years Nepal has anchored its education policy on the principle that \nexpanding human capital is the key to economic progress and raising living standards. Because \nschooling plays an important role in the expansion of human capital, each national development \nplan has set explicit expansion targets, such as higher enrollment, a greater budget share for \neducation, higher teacher qualifications, and more teacher training. This model was successful \nin  expanding  the  supply  of  schools.  However,  increases  in  student  attendance  have  not \nnecessarily  improved  Nepal\u2019s  human  capital  stock.  The  persistent  problem  has  been  that, \ndespite significant growth in access to and demand for education, many public schools are not \neffective.   \n \n8.  Fundamental Reform Model.  After 2000, Nepal\u2019s education policies shifted toward a \nrenewed emphasis on decentralization and community involvement in education. These reforms \nsought to change the relationships of authority and accountability among stakeholders.  Within \nthe broad spectrum of education for poverty reduction as reflected in the Tenth Five-Year Plan, \n2002-07, the national educational goal is to develop an effective and equitable public education \nsystem for grades 1-12. The major strategy adopted by the Tenth Plan is the decentralization of \nschool governance by providing school management responsibility to SMCs and, accordingly, to \nchange the role of district and central level agencies from controller to facilitator.   \n \nD.  Policy Issues  \n \n9.  Despite policies, programs and projects based on local and international best practices, \nmany of the ambitious targets for the education sector are unlikely to be met, according to the \nNepal  Business  Plan  for  the  Education  Sector.1  Ongoing  systemic  challenges  include \ninefficiencies that drain resources and the absence of a holistic approach to the entire school \neducation  sector.  At  the  school  level,  policies  aimed  at  improving  efficiency  are  often  not \n                                                 \n1 National Planning Commission. 2005. Nepal Business Plan for the Education Sector. Kathmandu. \n ", "30          Appendix 1 \nenforced and coordination of quality improvement programs remains weak. Although part of the \nlack of achievement is attributable to financing shortfalls, if education in Nepal is to improve, \nfundamental policy issues and implementation inefficiencies need to be resolved. There needs \nto  be:  (i)  a  focus  on  effective  schools;  (ii)  a  stress  on  accountability;  (iii) a  structure  and \nprocesses for formulating and coordinating sector-wide policies, programs and investments; and \n(iv) responsiveness to emerging sociopolitical developments.  \n \n10.  Effective Schools. Quality improvement has been a concern in Nepal for the past 20 \nyears. During the 1980s and 1990s several large projects were launched to improve the inputs \nto  and  performance  of  public  schools.  These  efforts,  although  successful  in  meeting  their \ntargets, have been less effective in creating an effective school system in the long term. In \n2005, many schools were still unable to provide a minimum standard of service. Standards of \nlearning  and  minimum  expected  learning  outcomes  need  to  be  defined  in  terms  that  are \npractical and realistic for Nepal\u2019s resource constraints and needs.  \n \n11.  Accountability.  The  defined  obligations  of  government,  teachers,  schools,  and \ncommunities are not enforced and there are no consequences for failure to perform to minimum \nstandards.  This lack of accountability undermines efforts to improve school quality.  \n \n12.  Sectorwide  Policy  Framework.  The  Tenth  Plan  articulates  a  human  resources \ndevelopment plan that includes an integrated 1\u201312 school system with many exit points. At \npresent, MOES does not have a policy framework that addresses the 1\u201312 school sector as an \nintegrated  whole.  As  a  result,  differences  of  interpretation  at  lower  levels  combine  with \nambiguity at the national level to send confusing messages to stakeholders. This hampers \nimplementation and prevents efficient use of resources. Examples of policy areas that warrant \nattention include teacher management, setting of minimum standards, school finance, and the \nneed for a clear assignment of school governance and management functions.    \n \n13.  Emerging  Policy  Directions.  Education  is  not  only  a  technical  and  administrative \nprocess, but a political and social one. Changes in the broad socio-cultural, economic, or public \nadministration contexts impact deeply on policies, programs, and implementation. After the  \nchange in the political landscape in April 2006, it is likely that fundamental challenges to the \ncurrent model of education provision will be raised. There will be an opportunity to reexamine \nthe sector as a whole and to construct a responsive education policy framework that is aligned \nwith a new Constitution. New governance, finance, and education laws will need to be drafted \nand  passed.  The  Government  will  have  to  shape  a  governance  and  finance  structure  for \neducation that is appropriate for a restructured, reformed, and more inclusive school system.   \n \nE.  Crosscutting Themes \n14.  Decentralization. Nepal is decentralizing education through community management of \nschools, block and earmarked grants for school financing, and school recruitment of teachers. \nHowever, there are several unresolved issues affecting school governance and management \nunder decentralization: (i) some functions, such as teacher management, have been assigned \nto  both  schools  and  districts;  (ii) some  functions  are  unclear,  e.g.,  the  responsibility  for \nmonitoring  schools  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  communities  or  supervisors; \n(iii) responsibility,  but  not  authority  or  resources,  has  been  assigned  to  making  SMCs \nresponsible  for  school  improvement  planning;  and  (iv)  there  are  no  consequences  for  not \nfulfilling functions, e.g., teachers who do not attend school regularly are not disciplined. \n \n ", "Appendix 1          31 \n15.  School Financing. At the school level, financing of operational costs has shifted to a \nformula-based block and earmarked grant mechanism. The allocation of grants is based on the \nsubmission of a school improvement plan (SIP) by the SMC to the DEO and follows criteria set \nout in the school grant operation guidelines of the DOE. For instance, while all schools that \nsubmit the SIP receive a basic grant, some are allocated  a larger grant, based on the number \nof students and the geographical area. There are also detailed allocation criteria based on \nperformance. The challenge in implementing the guidelines is the complexity of some criteria, \nsuch as the numerous types of scholarships, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to fully \nunderstand or apply them. Some criteria for performance grants are difficult to attain, such as \nthose based on survival rates, which means very few schools can take advantage of such \ngrants.   \n \n16.  The notion of formula funding is to provide schools with funds rather than inputs and to \nbase allocations on a formula rather than on an ad hoc, incremental, or school budget basis. \nAlthough there are many advantages to this approach, there are also conceptual and practical \nproblems. In practical terms, formula-based grants introduce schools to two new ideas at the \nsame time: the formula part and the cash transfer part. Because formulas are not transparent, \nhead teachers and SMCs do not know how much they are supposed to receive and they often \ndraw up school budgets based on needs rather than anticipated cash transfers. Schools are \naccustomed to being provisioned rather than financed, and purchasing goods such as textbooks \nand services such as teacher training can be difficult for them. Finally, formula-based block \ngrants place the responsibility for accounting, bookkeeping and auditing on the schools, and \nmany are unaccustomed to this administrative burden. \n \nF.  Sector Financing Plan for 1\u201312 School Sector  \n \n17.  Current long-term national and subsector financing plans do not address some of the \nkey issues related to the transition to a 1\u201312 school system, nor have they taken into account \nthe fact that financing for grades 6\u201312 is inadequate to support anticipated demand for post-\nprimary education. Expansion is not planned; the current practice is for schools to grow one \ngrade at a time as local resources permit, then to request assistance from the Government after \nthe  fact.  The  planned  restructuring  of  school  education  from  the  current  primary,  lower \nsecondary, secondary, higher secondary subsectors to an integrated 1\u20138 (basic) and 9\u201312 \n(secondary) structure will require systemic changes in governance, management and financing \nstructures and has serious implications for investment and management of human and physical \nresources.  \n \n18.  As part of preparations for the Education Sector Program I (ESP I), the DOE projected \nnational level student enrollment and teacher requirements for primary, lower secondary and \nsecondary levels for 2006-2012. The projection involved making assumptions on population \ngrowth rates, grade 1 intake rates, transition rates, and the proportion of public schools. As the \nGovernment plans to fully implement the policy of automatic promotion of grade 1 to 2 in 2007, \nand as it is estimated that gross intake rates (GIR) will decrease gradually, the number of grade \n1 students should gradually decrease. The primary gross enrollment rate (GER) will go down \nsharply after 2010, and, in turn, the lower secondary GER will go up when students in the \ncurrent grade 2 cohort move from the primary to the lower secondary level.  \n \n19.  Teacher Requirements. It is estimated that there are at least 13,000 teacher vacancies \nat the primary level. Teacher vacancies at lower secondary level are estimated to be 2,000\u2013\n6,400, and at the secondary level to be 1,200\u20133,900. There are regional imbalances: while \nabout half of the mountain and hill districts suffer from severe teacher shortages, the rest have \n ", "32          Appendix 1 \nvacancy levels of 10% or less, or even surpluses. Many valley districts have surpluses. On the \nother hand, almost all districts in Terai have 40-60% vacancy levels. Even within a district, there \nare imbalances between urban and rural schools. The recruitment of new teachers must take \ninto account the expected changes in total requirements for primary and secondary levels, as \nthe current large cohorts at the primary level will gradually move to lower secondary and \nsecondary levels. \n \n20.  Physical Requirements. Classroom shortages are another serious problem in many \nparts of the country. The DOE has estimated that about 40,000 additional primary classrooms \nare required, which would cost $198 million at the current prices. There are no hard data for \nclassroom requirements for lower secondary and secondary levels. While an absolute shortage \nof classrooms is evident, the current estimates for classroom requirements have not taken into \naccount the consequences of a 1-8, 9-12 system. Any new investment in classrooms must be \nbased on a thorough school mapping exercise and district- and village-level planning for school \nreorganization.  \n \n21.  Demand Side. Private costs of education affect household\u2019s decisions on whether or not \nto send their children to school. Table A1 shows the findings of a survey conducted among \npeople who have never attended school in the 6\u201324 age bracket. The highest percentage of \nfemale, urban, rural and total respondents answered that \u201cparents did not want\u201d them to attend \nschool. This can be the result of other more explicit reasons such as \u201chad to help at home\u201d, or \n\u201ctoo  expensive\u201d.  By  contrast,  \u201cparents  did  not  want\u201d  was  ranked  only  third  by  the  male \nrespondents, with \u201ctoo expensive\u201d being the first and \u201cnot willing to attend\u201d being the second. \nHence, parents seem to have stronger reservations about enrolling their daughters than their \nsons in school. \u201cAbsence of a nearby school\u201d is a factor for only 1.4% of people who never \nattended school. These survey results indicate that the main causes for non-enrollment are \nsocioeconomic rather than the lack of supply. \n \nTable A1: Reasons for Never Having Attended School, 6\u201324 years \n(%) \n \nReason for Not Attending School  Male  Female  Urban  Rural  Nepal \nParents did not want  17.8  38.4  33.8  32.8  32.8 \nHad to help at home  15.1  22.2  15.8  20.5  20.3 \n Too expensive  26.6  16.5  27.6  18.8  19.3 \n Not willing to attend  19.4  10.5  10.0  13.1  12.9 \n Too far  3.5  2.4  0.0  2.9  2.7 \n Absence of nearby school  1.8  1.2  0.0  1.5  1.4 \n Other reasons  15.9  8.7  12.7  10.6  10.7 \nTotal  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0 \nSource: Nepal Living Standard Survey 2003/04. \n \n22.  Taking  into  account  enrollment  trends,  and  considering  the  supply  and  demand \nimplications, a comprehensive, holistic and sustainable financing plan for the 1-12 school sector \nneeds to be developed.

Education Budget and Financial Sustainability \n \n1.  The Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) is the primary source of the education \nbudget in Nepal and typically finances about 80% of public school budgets.1 Allocations to the \neducation sector, particularly to primary education, have increased significantly. Expenditure on \neducation was only 1.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 9.6% of the total budget in \nfinancial year (FY) 1990. It has fluctuated between 2.9% and 3.1% of GDP in FY2001- FY2005, \nand was 3.9% in FY2006. The sector has been allocated 16% of the total budget in FY 2007, up \nfrom  15%  in  FY  2003.  This  is  higher  than  the  South  Asia  average  of  11%.  The  budget \nallocations are 56.3% to primary, 24.1% to secondary, 1.4% to technical and vocational, 10.4% \nto tertiary, and the balance to administration and development.  \n \n2.  The Government is committed to gradually increasing the level of investment. Table \nA2.1  compares  the  forecasted  education  budget  for  FY2008\u2013FY2009  in  the  most  recent \nmedium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) V for FY2007\u2013FY2009 and projections based on \nvarious assumptions on GDP growth rates (4\u20136%) and percentage of total government budget \nto the education sector (17\u201319%). In the lowest case (GDP growth rate of 4%, 17% of total \nbudget to education, and 58% of education budget to primary and 24% to secondary), it is \nestimated  that  $190.2  million  will  be  allocated  to  primary  education  and  $78.7  million  to \nsecondary in FY2008, and $197.8 million to primary and $81.9 million to secondary in FY2009. \nIn the highest case (GDP growth rate of 6%, 19% of total budget to education, and 62% of \neducation budget to primary and 28% to secondary), $219.4 million will be allocated to primary \neducation and $99.1 million to secondary in FY2008, and $245.5 million to primary and $110.9 \nmillion to secondary in FY2009. A comparison of these projections with the forecasts in the \nMTEF  V  suggests  that  the  Government  intends  to  allocate  16.9%  of  the  total  budget  to \neducation in FY2008, and to increase it to 18.0% in FY 2009.  \n \nTable A2.1: Primary and Secondary Education Financing ($ million) \n  Total Allocation to Education Sector (percentage of total budget) \nAllocation to Primary and   Baseline (MTEF V) Case A: High  Case B: Medium  Case C: Low \nSecondary Education   FY2008  FY2009  FY2008  FY2009  FY2008  FY2009  FY2008  FY2009 \n      18.0% 19.0% 17.5% 18.0%  17.0% 17.0%\n    GDP Growth at 4% \nCase 1: High2   293.3  329.6 312.5 343.1 303.8 325.0  295.1 307.0\nCase 2: Medium   280.3  314.9 299.5 329.7 291.2 312.4  282.9 295.0\nCase 3: Low   267.2  300.3 284.7 312.6 276.8 296.1  268.9 279.7\n                                   \n    GDP Growth at 5% \nCase 1: High   293.3  329.6 315.5 349.7 306.8 331.3  298.0 312.9\nCase 2: Medium   280.3  314.9 301.5 334.2 293.1 316.6  284.7 299.0\nCase 3: Low   267.2  300.3 287.5 318.6 279.5 301.8  271.5 285.1\n       \n    GDP Growth at 6% \nCase 1: High   293.3  329.6 318.5 356.4 309.7 337.6  300.8 318.9\nCase 2: Medium   280.3  314.9 304.4 340.5 295.9 322.6  287.5 304.7\nCase 3: Low   267.2  300.3 290.2 324.7 282.1 307.6  274.1 290.5\nFY = financial year, GDP = gross domestic product, MTEF = Medium-Term Expenditure Framework.  \nSource: MTEF V (FY2007\u2013FY2009). \n                                                 \n1 A technical review of 1,000 schools by the Department of Education (DOE) in December 2005 found that an \naverage of 18% of school budgets came from non-MOES sources such as District Development Committees \n(DDC), Village Development Committees (VDC), and Nongovernment Organizations (NGOs). \n2  The High, Medium, and Low cases refer, respectively, to education budget shares of 62%, 60%, and 58% going to \nprimary education, while 28%, 26%, and 24% go to secondary education. The first two columns use the MTEF V \nbaseline GDP growth rate. \n ", "34          Appendix 2 \n3.  There are two major reasons for the recent increase in the education budget. First, the \nGovernment  has  substantially  increased  its  contribution  to  education,  from  $84.6  million  in \nFY2005 to $111.4 million in FY2006, primarily to respond to the 20% teacher salary increase in \nFY2005. Second, development partners have increased their contributions to primary education \nthrough the Education For All (EFA) program, which accounted for 40% of the total primary \neducation budget in FY2005 and 35.8% in FY2006. ADB and Denmark also increased their \ncontribution to secondary education through the Secondary Education Support Project (SESP), \nwhich accounted for 26.3% of the total secondary education budget in FY2005 and 23.3% in \nFY2006.  \n \nB.  Education for All (EFA) Financing  \n \n4.  Despite  the  highest priority given to basic and primary education, and a  substantial \nincrease in the education budget, Nepal still faces a considerable funding gap in EFA, 2004\u2013\n2009.  Table  A2.2  shows  that,  when  EFA  began  in  FY2005,  the  total  program  cost  was \nestimated at $814.5 million. Only $789.5 million was committed from the Government and \ndevelopment partners, which included $535.5 million from the Government, $150 million from \nthe JFA development partners,3 and $104 million from other partners, leaving a $25 million \nfunding  gap.  In  April  2006,  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  re-estimated  the  gap  at \n$55.4 million in total for the next three years (FY2007\u2013FY2009), without changing the originally \nagreed EFA activities and targets (Table A2.3). This re-estimate was due to the significant \nincrease in the overall Government contribution in FY2005, because of the teacher salary \nincrease.  As  a  result,  the  Government  asked  the  development  partners  for  a  proportional \nincrease in their contribution from the original $30 million per annum to $38.8 million in FY2006 \nand to $40 million in FY2007. As the Government needs to implement additional activities such \nas those related to mitigating the impact of the conflict and new emerging priorities in the sector, \nDOE estimates that actual needs are higher. Development partner contributions have been and \nwill be spent at a much faster rate than originally planned, leaving almost no development  \npartner funds for the last year of the program. \n \nTable A2.2: Original Cost Estimates in the EFA Core Document \n($ million) \n \n2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08  2008/09  Total \nJFA Development Partners     \nGovernment  89.8  90.6  98.6  99.5  100.5  479.1 \nAid Partners  30.0  30.0  30.0  30.0  30.0  150.0 \nOther Partners             \nGovernment  13.5  13.8  10.2  9.8  9.2  56.5 \nAid Partners  24.9  25.3  18.8  18.0  16.8  104.0 \nTotal Funds Available  158.3  159.6  157.7  157.3  156.5  789.5 \nTotal Funds Required  149.7  160.5  165.5  171.2  167.7  814.5 \nFunding Gap  8.64  (0.80)  (7.79)  (13.90)  (11.15)  (25.00)\n( ) = negative, EFA = education for all, JFA = joint financing arrangement. \nSource: Education for All 2004\u20132009 Core Document (17 November 2003). \n \n                                                 \n3 The share of each JFA development partner is as follows: Denmark ($28 million), United Kingdom ($35 million), \nFinland ($14 million), Norway ($23 million), and the World Bank ($50 million).    \n ", "Appendix 2          35 \nTable A2.3: Actual Expenditures and Resources Required \n($ million) \n \n  2004/05  2005/06 2006/07  2007/08  2008/09  Total \nJFA Development Partners   \nGovernment  92.4  120.0  123.7  136.7  143.5  616.3 \nAid Partners  29.9  38.8  40.0  40.0  1.3  150.0 \nOther Partners             \nGovernment  5.0  6.2  5.7  5.3  3.8  26.0 \nAid Partners  19.2  29.9  19.8  15.2  11.0  95.1 \nTotal Funds Available  146.5  194.9  189.1  197.2  159.6  887.3 \nTotal Funds Required (est.)  146.5  194.9  198.5  201.6  201.2  942.7 \nFunding Gap (Baseline)  0  0  -9.4  -4.4  -41.6  -55.4 \nFunding Gap (Additional)  0  0  -36.6  -45.2  -50.4  -132.2 \nJFA = joint financing arrangement. \nSource: Estimated by Department of Education (in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank) in \nApril 2006.   \n \n5.  Table A2.4 summarizes the proposed EFA budget allocation by item in FY2007. The \ntable is limited to the JFA development partners\u2019 budget. A large amount is allocated to school \nblock  grants  for  both  capital  and  recurrent  expenditure,  earmarked  block  grants,  and \nscholarships. This reflects the EFA policy objective of transferring a large share of non-salary \nbudget to schools as grants. A separate analysis on the allocation of the budget by component \nshows that almost 42% is allocated to activities for improving quality of education, while 26% is \nallocated for activities aiming at increasing access to education, and 14% to eliminating gender \ndisparities.  \n \nTable: A2.4: \nSummary of budget allocation by line items, 2006\u20132007 \n(NRs \u2018000 and $ million) \n \nLine            % of \nItems  Headings  Centre  District  Total  $  EFA \n(NRs  (NRs  (NRs  million  Total \n\u2018000)  \u2018000)  \u2018000)  Budget \nA.

EFA Financial Sustainability  \n \n6.   During EFA appraisal in 2003, the program was assessed to be financially sustainable, \non the assumption that the Government will gradually increase total expenditure on education \nfrom 15% of the total budget to 18% by FY2009 and that it would increase its share to basic \neducation from 55% to 60%. The MTEF V forecast suggests that the Government will increase \neducation\u2019s share of the total budget to 18%. Based on the assumption that the Government will \nincrease its share, the EFA appraisal included an overall program plan, based on two scenarios \nfor development partner contributions: (i) a low case of $145 million, and (ii) a high case of \n$175 million. In both cases, most recurrent expenditures are met by the Government. However, \nthe activities under development expenditures in the low case scenario are smaller scale.           \n \n7.  The EFA core document recognizes the risk to financial sustainability posed by the weak \nfiscal  balance  and  the  uncertain  sociopolitical  situation.  The  commitment  by  existing \ndevelopment partners to EFA is high, and provided the sociopolitical situation continues to \nimprove, the Government expects more partners to join the Program. ESP I will close some of \nthe immediate funding gap. However, more robust financial planning will be required to ensure \neffective implementation during the last year of the EFA.                   \n \nD.  Beyond EFA   \n \n8.  The EFA appraisal made an assessment of EFA\u2019s financial sustainability beyond the \nprogram period based on an enrollment projection (without an extension to grade 8).4 According \nto the appraisal, the EFA will be financially sustainable beyond FY2009, on a base case scenario \nof 4.5% annual GDP growth, education expenditure at 3.5% of GDP, and 55% of expenditure \nallocated to basic and primary education.   \n \n9.  In the absence of a comprehensive sector financing plan, it is difficult to assess the \nfinancing shortfall of the total school sector. However, from the broad estimate made by DOE of \nthe sector from FY2006 to FY2009, it is unlikely that Government alone can meet all the \nfinancial  requirements.  The  ESP  I  feasibility  study  made  a  projection  of  requirements  for \nteachers, based on an enrollment projection from 2006 to 2012. This suggested there would be \nserious teacher shortages at the primary level in the next few years, but the problem will expand \nand shift towards the lower secondary and secondary levels as the present cohorts in primary \nschools move to the higher grades. The Government needs to thoroughly review the present \nteacher deployment situation across regions, schools, and education levels, and to make a \nrealistic action plan for teacher redeployment that maximizes the use of its limited resources.  \n \n10.  The Government has substantially increased its investment in education, particularly in \nprimary education, since the early 1990s. Primary enrollment has rapidly increased to achieve \nEFA, and, consequently, secondary enrollment has increased and will increase further. Given \nthe  rapid  expansion  of  primary  and  secondary  education,  it  is  likely  that  Nepal  will  need \nconsiderable financial support from its development partners over the next 5\u201310 years for EFA \nand beyond EFA, particularly if the current slow economic growth rate continues. At the same \ntime, the Government needs to develop strategies to help schools and communities to mobilize \nfunds at the school level, and to encourage the development and involvement of the private \nsector wherever possible. The EFA core document rightly recognizes the need for continued \nexternal support in the sector in the medium to long term. It reiterates that investment in primary \nand secondary education is crucial to reduce persistent poverty and inequality, and that such \ninvestment will help bring social and political stability, increasing the economic returns of such \ninvestment in the long term. \n                                                 \n4 World Bank. 2003.

Although there has been progress toward EFA outcomes and the improved security \nmeans that expenditures are likely to increase, both the Department of Education (DOE) and \nNepal\u2019s  development  partners  recognize  the  need  to  continue  to  improve  program \nimplementation if the six EFA goals are to be achieved (see para. 18 in the main text). The \nfeasibility study for the preparation of the Education Sector Program I made an assessment of \nEFA implementation through an analysis of the semi-annual reports (the Flash Reports), the \nindependent technical review of school education, the joint review mission\u2019s aides-memoire, and \ninterviews  with  the  JFA  development  partners.  The  recommendations  based  on  that \nassessment summarized in Table A4 indicated that the program could improve in a number of \nkey ways. It is expected that recommendations that require major adjustments to program \nimplementation will be addressed during the EFA midterm review planned for 2007.      \n \nTable A4: Summary of Recommendations based on Implementation and Lessons Learned  \n \nArea  Recommended Actions \nA.  Equity and Social Inclusion  \nEstablishment of  \u2022  The education policy committee should consider establishing a gender, equity and social \na gender, equity  inclusion thematic working group to ensure the effective coordination of policies. The \nand social  working group should identify barriers to access for women, Dalits, Janajatis, and other \ninclusion thematic  vulnerable groups in the EFA program and future proposed policies and make specific \nworking group  recommendations to overcome them. It has been suggested that locally-elected bodies and \ncommunity-based organizations should be involved in planning the increased enrollment of \nexcluded groups.  \nHigh Pupil  \u2022  Reduce overcrowding in schools caused by the conflict and economic migration, and \nTeacher Ratio   prioritize the districts and schools most badly affected.   \nInequities in  \u2022  Address delays in the distribution of scholarship funds from NPC to MOES, from MOES to \nscholarship  districts, and from DEOs to schools. \nallocation and  \u2022  Ensure DEOs have sufficient budget to meet scholarship requirements (so schools no \ndistribution  longer have to reduce the number of eligible students or reduce scholarship amounts). \n\u2022  Explore mechanisms to ensure schools submit scholarship requirements on time for the \nbudget and cross-check schools\u2019 scholarship requirements to prevent inflated requests from \nschools. \n\u2022  Consider establishing a classification of marginalized Janajati groups in order to allocate \nscholarships to groups that are currently excluded. \n\u2022  Consider increasing the role of PTA in identifying eligible scholarship candidates. \n\u2022  Identify inequities and solutions in the student scholarship application process, e.g., the \nproblems some Dalit students have in completing student data forms which require birth \nregistration. The current classification for Dalits should be extended to cover all Dalits, in \nconsultation with all DEOs. \nRecruitment and  \u2022  Propose targets, strong policy directives and incentives to ensure an increase in the \ndistribution of  recruitment of multilingual Dalits, marginalized Janajatis, and female teachers.  \nfemale, Dalit and \nmarginalized \nJanajati teachers \nCodes of Conduct   \u2022  Consider revising codes of conduct for head teachers, teachers, students, SMCs and PTAs \nto end discriminatory behaviour and practice on grounds of gender, caste, ethnicity, and \ndisability. Consider mechanisms to hold people practicing such behaviour accountable. \nStakeholders (including teachers\u2019 unions, head teachers, teachers, SMCs, PTAs, and legal \nforums) should be involved in such a review to ensure codes of conduct and processes are \nagreed, not imposed, and are practical to implement, monitor, and evaluate.  \nAdvocacy and  \u2022  Initiate dialogue with the Faculty of Education to develop gender and social inclusion \nawareness - sensitivity training and related skills for all pre-service teacher training) courses. Incorporate \nraising for  revised codes of conduct and related revised regulations into future training courses. \ninclusive school  \u2022  Liaise with NCED to ensure that in-service teacher and head teacher training, as well as \nand classroom \n ", "40          Appendix 4 \nArea  Recommended Actions \nenvironments  training for DEOs and SMCs, addresses discriminatory behaviour and practice in schools \nand promotes girl-friendly environments in all districts.  \n\u2022  Review the training packages already implemented. Under the TEP, NCED has already \nconducted training to stakeholders in 12 districts. The Inclusive Education Section also runs \nan  innovative  but  small-scale  training  program  under  EFA  for  primary  schools  and \nstakeholders with training materials which it developed in close consultation with the gender \nequity and development unit. Demand for this training package is growing and distribution \ncould be significantly scaled up to cover many more schools and districts. Future training \ncontent could include the dissemination of revised codes of conduct and any related revised \nregulations.  \n\u2022  With NCED, consider developing a 2-day awareness training course to be delivered to staff \nin MOES and DOE\u2019s six central departments. \n\u2022  Consider impact evaluation of the training on all groups. \nCommittee  \u2022  Consider how SMC membership could become more representative of school communities \nrepresentation by  by gender, caste and ethnicity. Review the roles and responsibilities (from a social and \ngender, caste and  economic  inclusion  perspective)  and  capacity-building  needs  of  SMCs  and  PTAs  in \nethnicity  consultation with them  \n\u2022  Consider  how  DEO  scholarship  committees  could  become  more  transparent  and \nrepresentative by gender, caste and ethnicity. Consider how stakeholders could help to \nmake the equitable allocation and distribution of scholarships more inclusive. Coordinate \nwith district NGOs to reduce duplication. Disseminate case studies of districts that show \ngood practice. \nRational  \u2022  Review budget support, distribution, and the impacts of ECDs on poor families, targeting \ndistribution of  conflict-affected, poor, and deprived areas. Improve access by marginalized Janajati, Dalit, \nECDs  and other disadvantaged groups to (i) relieve overcrowding by under-age children in grade \n1, (ii) provide vital child care support for poor families, and (iii) release girls from child-\nminding to enable them to attend school. \nEquity issues in  \u2022  Initiate  a  dialogue  with  OCE  on  the  findings  of  the  2005  SLC  study  and  with  all \nthe examination  representative groups on gender, poverty and equity issues relating to examination failure in \nsystem  schools.  Consider  taking  strong  affirmative  action  to  implement  the  SLC  study \nrecommendations to reduce disparities and increase equitable outcomes. \nRespecting  \u2022  Ensure curriculum is revised to reflect the diverse cultures of Nepal. \ncultural diversity  \u2022  Through involvement of stakeholders, ensure the current process of translating the existing \nin curriculum  curriculum into indigenous languages places equal emphasis on amending the curriculum \ndevelopment  content to reflect the culture of the language.   \nInclusion of  \u2022  Review the current program and budgetary gaps in providing access to education for the \nchildren in  groups  identified  in  this  category  (e.g.,  disabled  and  street  children)  and  propose \nespecially difficult  improvements.  \ncircumstances  \u2022  In the event of an end to the armed conflict, reintegrate child and youth soldiers back into \nmainstream education. Scholarships should be provided to such over-age children and \nyouths wishing to re-enter mainstream education and to acquire skills for employment.  \n\u2022  Consider how teachers could assess and address the psycho-social impacts of armed \nconflict,  natural  disasters,  family  bereavement  and  other  trauma  inflicted  on  children. \nConsider integrating basic training for teachers in existing pre-service and in-service training \ncourses to enable them to identify trauma in children and develop listening and counselling \nskills.  \nSafe drinking  \u2022  Consider liaising with DWSS and other agencies, such as UNICEF, to conduct up-to-date \nwater and  district level assessments and to prioritize which schools should receive safe drinking water \nseparate toilets  and separate toilets for girls and boys, and for male and female teachers. This would \nfor girls and boys  reduce lost school days, particularly for girls. Rural and poor schools should also be \n  prioritized for sanitation and hygiene.  \nB.  Education Financing \nPlanning  \u2022  DOE, in collaboration with DEOs, should conduct a school mapping exercise and prepare \ncomprehensive enrollment projections by district for each subsector of the school sector. \nThis would form the basis for estimating human and physical resource requirements for the \nnext 3-5 years. \nImplementation  \u2022  DOE should use the findings from reports such as Support to Development of Financial \nManagement in the Education Sector, PETS, and Technical Review of School Education \nwhich identify causes for weak implementation at MOES and DOE, and at district and \nschool  levels.  DOE  should  provide  training  on  project  implementation  and  financial \n ", "Appendix 4          41 \nArea  Recommended Actions \nmanagement. \n\u2022  The PETS noted that schools often do not receive the full amount of budget allocated to \nthem. Even if the budget arrives, it is often not on time. To accelerate disbursement and \nreduce the leaks between DEO and schools, the DOE needs to establish clear norms for \nbudget allocation and to require DEOs to disclose disbursement procedures and the amount \nof school budget. \nFinancial  \u2022  In order for the MOES, DOE, and DEOs to produce FMRs on time and in a way that \nmanagement  provides a more precise and detailed picture of the implementation of various activities, the \ncapacity  planning, financing, and monitoring sections of DOE need to be better coordinated.   \n  \u2022  For districts where DTCOs are not electronically linked with FCGO, an alternative reporting \nmechanism and schedule must be defined so FMRs can be submitted on time. \n\u2022  Training in financial management and monitoring and evaluation is necessary for both DOE \nand DEOs.  External audits by the OAG/N will be more effective if its findings are made use \nof to take strict action against intended misappropriation. Training programs should be \nrequired for people who commit unintended misappropriations through ignorance.   \n\u2022  School financial management, including the preparation of school budgets and account \nkeeping, must be improved through training and active participation of SMC members.  In \nparticular, as schools now manage much larger amounts of school budget than ever before, \ninternal audits and social audits at school level must be implemented more rigorously. \nEquitable and  \u2022  The MOES and DOE need to develop more effective measures to identify the most needy \neffective  children. A monitoring mechanism is needed to ensure that the intended recipients receive \ndistribution of  the full amount of the scholarship. The role of VDCs and SMCs in identifying \u2018needy\u2019 \nscholarships  students should be emphasized. \nEquitable and  \u2022  The Government should establish more detailed norms for teacher deployment. DEOs \neffective  should use school census data to identify the actual and required number of teachers in \ndistribution of  each school and district. They should facilitate a more even distribution of teachers.   \nteachers  \u2022  Unless the Government has a clear exit policy for hiring temporary teachers, there is a risk \nof employing them beyond the intended period. Before recruiting any new teachers, the \nGovernment  needs  to  address  teacher  deployment  and  management  to  improve  the \ndistribution and performance of the existing teaching force. \nInternal efficiency  \u2022  The  liberal  promotion  policy  cannot  be  a  fundamental  solution  to  improving  internal \nefficiency. Solid policies on assessment are also needed to ensure children learn. \nSchool financing  \u2022  The  introduction  of  SIPs  has  allowed  local  stakeholders  to  be  involved  in  designing, \nand governance  implementing,  and  monitoring  school  improvement  programs.  The  mobilization  of \ncommunities to support schools through financial and labor contributions to, for instance, \nclassroom construction and school environment improvement is crucial to fill the funding \ngap. Community involvement in school management should be continued and strengthened. \nThe Government needs to provide more training in planning and financial management for \nheadteachers, teachers, SMCs, and PTAs. Training for SMCs should include monitoring \nand supervision of the teaching-learning process, an area where SMCs are perceived to be \nweak. Membership by ethnic minorities should be encouraged so that they will have a \nstronger voice in decisions on education matters. \nDEO =  district education office,  DOE = Department of Education,  DTCO = District Treasury Control Office,  \nDWSS = Department of Welfare and Social Services, ECD = early childhood development, EFA = education for all, \nFCGO = Financial Comptroller General Office, FMR = financial management report, MOES = Ministry of Education \nand Sports, NCED = National Center for Educational Development, NGO = nongovernment organization, NPC = \nNational Planning Commission, OAG/N = Office of the Auditor General of Nepal, OCE = Office of the Controller of \nExaminations, PETS = public expenditure tracking survey, PTA = parent  teacher  association,  SIP = school \nimprovement plan, SLC = school leaving certificate, SMC = school management committee, TEP = teacher \neducation project, UNICEF = United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, VDC = village development committee.  \nSource: ADB. 2006.

The most recent update of Nepal\u2019s country financial accountability assessment (CFAA), \ncompleted in June 2005 by the World Bank and the Department for International Development \n(DFID) of the United Kingdom, concluded that, despite some progress since the last full CFAA \nin 2002, substantial issues remain. Nepal\u2019s fiduciary risk is still considered high. Full sector \nbudgetary support by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the education sector in Nepal \nwould therefore be premature.  \n \n2.  The proposed Education Sector Program I (ESP I) loan intends to adopt a program-\nbased approach (PBA). The program lending modality is preferred for the $30 million loan for \nESP  I  and  the  Education  for  All  (EFA)  Program,  as  ADB  will  join  an  existing  group  of \ndevelopment partners and no additional conditions will be added to the already established joint \nfinancing arrangement (JFA).  \n \n3.  The program loan will support the existing JFA, which was finalized and signed in \nSeptember 2004. The first funds were disbursed in July 2005. The JFA, reviewed and evaluated \nregularly  by  the  members,  has  specific  disbursement,  reporting,  monitoring,  and  audit \nrequirements which provide appropriate fiscal controls to ensure that funds are spent for their \nintended purpose.   \n \nB.  Overview  of  the  Joint  Financing  Arrangement:  Eligible  Accounts,  Budgeting, \nProcurement, Reporting and Auditing \n \n4.  The JFA was established on 24 September 2004 between the Government of Nepal (the \nGovernment) and five JFA development partners: DFID; the governments of Denmark, Finland, \nand Norway; and the World Bank. Each JFA development partner has signed an agreement \nwith the Government specifying the amount of its contribution to the EFA pool and its agreement \nwith the terms of the JFA. The responsibility for implementing the program lies with the Ministry \nof Education and Sports (MOES). Accounts eligible for funding are detailed in Table A5.1. \n \nTable A5.1: Joint Financing Arrangement Budget Head Accounts \n \nBudget Head Number  Description \n65-3-140  Primary teacher\u2019s salary \n65-3-167  Nonformal education \n65-3-169  Teacher Documentation \n65-3-170  Special Education Program \n65-3-176  Teacher Pension \n65-4-167  Nonformal Education (capital expenditure) \n65-3-417  Education for All (center, recurrent) \n65-4-417  Education for All (center, capital) \n65-3-804  Education for All (district, recurrent) \n65-4-804  Education for All (district, capital) \n  Source: Joint Financing Arrangement for Education for All 2004-2009. \n \n5.  Each year the MOES prepares an annual strategic implementation plan (ASIP) and an \nannual  work  plan  and  budget  (AWPB)  for  the  EFA  program.  These  are  reviewed  by  all \ndevelopment partners at the annual joint review mission each April. Based on the outcome of \n ", "Appendix 5          43 \nthe review, the JFA development partners commit resources and agree on the share of funding \nfor the coming fiscal year. Once the budget is approved, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) releases \nspending authorization to the MOES.   \n \n6.  The  MOES  undertakes  all  procurement  of  works,  goods  and  services  for  the  EFA \nprogram and is responsible for signing contracts. Procedures and regulations follow those in the \nGovernment\u2019s Financial Administration Regulations 2056 (FAR). The implementing rules of the \nFAR are given in the Public Works Directives (PWDs).1 The PWDs are based on a combination \nof (i) existing procedures and rules contained in government laws and regulations; (ii) actual \npractices in Nepal; (iii) selected procedures from development partner guidelines, including \nADB; and (iv) international best practices. The objective is to provide a set of understandable, \neffective, efficient and practical directives. The procurement arrangements have been assessed \nand deemed acceptable by the JFA development partners. \n \n7.  As an annex to the AWPB, the MOES will provide the JFA development partners with a \ndraft annual procurement plan for their review. The procurement plan will include only those \nactivities to be financed under the EFA Program. During implementation of the procurement \nplan, the MOES will provide the JFA development partners with procurement monitoring reports \nevery fiscal year trimester (every 4 months).   \n \n8.  MOES will use the Government\u2019s reporting system to prepare and submit a financial \nmonitoring report (FMR) every trimester. The FMR, which provides the basis for disbursement \nby the JFA development partners each trimester, is certified by the MOF within 45 days of the \nend of each trimester and submitted to the JFA development partners for review. The FMR will \nconsist of the following reports:  \n \n(i)  for each trimester and year-to-date, a report on the transfers to and withdrawals \nfrom the foreign exchange account (FEA), with a copy of the bank statement for \nthe account; \n(ii)  a consolidated financial report for allocations and expenditures from the MOF for \nthe eligible accounts, comparing actual and budgeted figures by budget line item, \nfor the trimester and cumulatively for the fiscal year-to-date; \n(iii)  an output-based progress report relating EFA expenditures to outputs for the first \nand second trimesters; \n(iv)  a cash forecast statement for the following two trimesters accounting for the \ncurrent balance in the foreign exchange account; and \n(v)  an update of the procurement plan. \n \n9.  The FMR has to be timely and accurate because it is the basis for the Government\u2019s \nrequest for replenishment of the FEA. If the FMR is delayed and/or is not accurate, the JFA \ndevelopment partners may not accept it until revisions, satisfactory to them, are made.   \n \n10.  The EFA program is audited by the Office of the Auditor General of Nepal (OAG/N) and \naudit reports are due within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year (on or before 16 January). \nThe  audit  shall  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  and  under  terms  of \nreference agreed by the OAG/N and the JFA development partners. A grace period of 2 months \nwill be allowed for submission (i.e., until or before 16 March) because of the remoteness of \nmany cost centers.  \n                                                 \n1 Consultant services for the development of the PWD were provided under ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the \nKingdom of Nepal for Strengthening Project Implementation Practices. Manila (TA 3306-NEP). \n ", "44          Appendix 5 \n11.  In addition to the annual audit by the OAG/N, a Technical Review of School Education \n(TRSE) is conducted by an external consultant engaged by the members of the JFA twice a \nyear to assess past performance and future financial needs. The TRSE is reviewed by the JFA \ndevelopment partners at a consultative meeting each December and at the joint review mission \neach April. The TRSE surveys2 1,000 schools in 20 districts from different development and \necological regions and evaluates the overall effectiveness of the program. It focuses on: (i) \nteacher  inclusiveness,  qualifications,  funding,  absenteeism  and  training;  (ii)  Government \ncommitment  to  students  (scholarships  and  distribution  of  free  textbooks);  (iii)  school \nmanagement and accountability; and, (iv) public expenditure and fiscal discipline.   \n \nC.  Disbursement Arrangements and Pooling Mechanism \n \n12.  Disbursements are made in two steps. First, JFA development partners advance funds3 \nbased on expected cash requirements into the FEA4 held jointly by the MOES and the MOF. \nWhile the funds are pooled, each pooling aid partner\u2019s amounts are recorded and reconciled \nseparately by the MOES. Balances and reconciliations are reported in the FMR. No direct \npayments for any transaction can be made from this fund. In the second step, funds are \nreleased  from  the  FEA  to  the  Government\u2019s  consolidated  fund  based  on  submission  and \napproval of actual expenditures by the MOES (as reported in the FMR). Funds are not released \nuntil the MOF receives the approval of the FMR from the JFA development partners. Figure \nA5.1 shows the disbursement arrangement. \n                                                 \n2 The survey questionnaire includes sections on basic school identification data, enrollment, transfer of students, \nscholarships, textbook distribution, basic teacher information, physical facilities, budget information, sources and \nuses of funds, classroom construction, financial reporting and monitoring, and accountability. \n3 The initial contribution by the JFA development partners to the FEA was based on a forecast of two trimester cash \nrequirements deposited in advance. However, the transfer to the consolidated fund will be on a trimester basis. \nReplenishment of the fund in the FEA is on a trimester basis. Hence there will always be about two trimesters \nestimated cash requirements of the EFA program in the FEA. This arrangement ensures that there will be no \nshortage of funds, if the FMR is produced on time and is acceptable to the JFA development partners. \n4 The timing of disbursement to the FEA is dependent on the JFA development partner\u2019s financial calendar and is \nseparate from the releases to the consolidated fund. There is an informal agreement between the partners that the \nInternational Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank will temporarily advance the trimester contribution \nof any other partner that is unable to contribute on time. This advance will later be covered by the partner whose \ncontribution was delayed. \n ", "Appendix 5          45 \n \nFigure A5.1: Education for All Funding Mechanism \n   \n   \n    MOF/MOES GoN\n  JFA Development  Foreign Exchange  Consolidated \n  Partners  Account  Fund \n \nTransfer of \n \nDisbursement of  funds each \n  funds each  trimester upon \n  trimester upon  MOES/DOE \n  development  request and \npartner approval  upon \n \nof MOES FMR  certification of \n \nactual \n  expenditures in \n  FMR\n  DOE = Department of Education, FMR = financial monitoring report, GoN = Government of Nepal, JFA = \n  joint financing arrangement, MOES = Ministry of Education and Sports, MOF = Ministry of Finance. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n13.  The current funding mechanism requires the JFA development partners to disburse \nfunds three times a year upon submission and development partner approval of the FMR report. \nThe EFA program lasts until 2009, so the JFA development partners have nine remaining \ndisbursements  under  the  program.  Disbursements  under  ADB\u2019s  program  lending  modality \ngenerally  have  two  or  three  tranches,  so  every  year  ADB  will  pre-fund  its  disbursement \nrequirement with each tranche release (Figure A5.2). This arrangement, although not exactly \nthe same as those of other JFA development partners, is in line with requirements.  Depositing \nfunds directly into the FEA account will strengthen the financial management of the project, as \nthis account is under the JFA and subject to regular reporting, monitoring and auditing. \n \n \nFigure A5.2: Program Loan Funding Mechanism \u2013 ADB \n \n    Foreign Exchange  Government of \n  JFA Development  Account  Nepal \nPartners  Consolidated \n \nFund \n \n  Disbursement of  Transfer of  \nfunds each trimester  funds each  \n \nupon development  trimester upon MOES/ \n  partner approval  of  DOE request and upon \n  MOES FMR  First tranche  certification of actual \n  release upon loan  expenditures in FMR \nsigning and \n  withdrawal \n \n  application; \nADB  \n  second  tranche \nreleases based on \n \nannual budget \n \n \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, JFA = joint financing arrangement, FMR = financial monitoring report,  \n  MOES = Ministry of Education and Sports. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "46          Appendix 5 \nD.  Assessment of the EFA JFA \n \n14.  The  JFA\u2019s  disbursement,  reporting,  monitoring  and  audit  requirements  provide  a \nframework of fiscal controls that extend beyond those already in place at the government level.  At \nthe time the JFA was prepared, a risk assessment of the program was conducted by the World \nBank  in  collaboration  with  the  other  JFA  development  partners.  Under  the  JFA,  the  JFA \ndevelopment  partners  agreed  to  use  the  existing  government  system  for  disbursement  and \naccounting  of  pooled  government  and  development  partner  funds.  This  means  that  the \nassessment of fiduciary risk of investing in the EFA program required an assessment of the \nfinancial management and program implementation systems of the implementing agencies: MOF \n(responsible for financial management) and MOES (responsible for program implementation and \nreporting).  While the overall country risk is rated high (see para.1), the overall program risk was \nrated  medium  in  terms  of  financial  management  and  program  implementation.  Several  risk \nmitigation measures were suggested and implemented by the MOES.  \n \n15.  To  address  weaknesses  in  the  financial  management  assessment  and  to  further \nstrengthen the capacity of the MOES, the Government and JFA development partners agreed \non a time-bound financial management improvement plan in addition to the measures detailed \nabove. A review of the plan\u2019s progress shows that the Government has met most of the \nrequirements on time, with the exception of recruiting financial consultants to maintain accounts \ninformation in a computer system. This requirement is only in its initial phase.   \n \n16.  While the JFA framework been in place for 1 full fiscal year (16 July 2005 to 15 July \n2006), the most current FMR covers the period through to the second trimester (15 March \n2006). This report indicates that 51.8% of the JFA\u2019s total annual budget has been spent.  \nAccording to the MOES\u2019s historical spending pattern of 30% in the first and second trimesters, \nand 40% in the last trimester, 60% of the budget should have been spent by now. The delay is \nprimarily due to capital expenditures that have been delayed and are expected to be completed \nby the end of the fiscal year. Details of JFA expenditures through the second trimester are \nprovided in Table A5.2. \n \nTable A5.2: EFA JFA Expenditure, Budget Allocation and Actual, Through the Second Trimester \n(NRs) \n \nBudget  Description  Annual Allocation  Up to Second  Progress \nHead No.  Trimester  (%) \n65-3-140  Primary Teachers\u2019 Salary  7,093,769,000 4,794,702,577  67.59 \n65-3-167  Non-formal Education  4,503,000 3,160,737  70.19 \n65-3-169  Teacher Documentation  224,770,000 95,272,370  42.43 \n65-3-170  Special Education Program  33,600,000 17,677,564  52.61 \n65-3-176  Teacher Pension  650,000,000 260,000,000  40.00 \n65-4-167  Non-formal Education  0 0  0.00 \n65-3-417  Education for All (center,   51,700,000 15,768,325  30.50 \nrecurrent) \n65-4-417  Education for All (center,  28,300,000 20,707,326  73.17 \ncapital) \n  Subtotal  8,086,642,00 5,207,288,899  64.39 \n65-3-804  Education for All (district,  2,624,989,000 581,212,453  22.14 \nrecurrent) \n65-4-804  Education for All (district,  553,600,000 42,810,522  7.73 \ncapital) \n  Subtotal  3,178,589,000 624,022,975  19.63 \n    Total  11,265,231,000 5,831,411,876  51.76 \nSource: Education for All 2nd Trimester Financial Monitoring Report.  \n ", "Appendix 5          47 \n17.  In addition to the FMR, a TRSE was completed in March 2006.  While the review noted \nsome progress from the previous TRSE conducted in September 2005, several issues were \nraised about the JFA\u2019s effectiveness, in particular the completeness and accuracy of records at \nthe schools and compliance and enforcement of audit requirements at schools.5 While audit \ncompliance had improved since the last survey, the results were still below expectations.  This \nwas due to the poor accuracy or lack of records maintained at the schools.  These issues are \ndirectly related to low financial management capacity at the schools.   \n \n18.  The results of both the FMR and TRSE were reviewed by the JFA development partners \nat the joint review meeting in June 2006.  While the partners were generally satisfied with the \nfinancial progress of the EFA and accepted the MOES\u2019s explanation for the delays, they were \nconcerned with the timeliness and accuracy of the FMR, the accuracy of the annual report, the \ncompleteness of school audits, and the internal controls for disbursement of teacher\u2019s salaries.  \nThe MOES is aware of these issues and responded to the JFA development partners on each \npoint.  It has formed a financial task force working group to improve the timeliness and accuracy \nof financial reporting. The MOES also acknowledged the weaknesses in school audit and \ninternal controls and is taking steps to improve in these areas. In addition, the MOES committed \nto: \n \n(i)  developing a program to improve technical and management capacity at both the \nschool and district level; and  \n(ii)  institutionalizing  the  monitoring  and  reporting  process  so  that  the  issues  of \n(a) timeliness,  (b)  comprehensiveness,  (c)  accuracy,  and  (d)  analysis,  are \naddressed.   \n \nE.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n \n19.  In  conclusion,  the  JFA  has  appropriate  fiscal  controls.  While  financial  management \nperformance through the first two trimesters by the MOES needs further improvement, regular \nmonitoring by the JFA development partners ensures accountability. This was demonstrated by \nthe MOES response to the issues raised at the joint review mission and the steps it took to \nimprove performance.  Overall, the JFA provides an environment with appropriate fiscal control \nto ensure that funds are spent for their intended purpose. \n \n20.  However, to address the weaknesses identified, the following are recommended, which \ncould be developed via a capacity development grant to the MOES: \n \n(i)  training in financial management to enhance the collecting, compiling, reviewing \nand reporting of financial information between the schools, district and MOES \nlevels; and  \n(ii)  for  districts  where  offices  are  not  electronically  linked  with  the  MOF,  an \nalternative reporting mechanism and schedule must be defined to facilitate the \nsubmission of FMRs on time.  \n                                                 \n5 While OAG/N is responsible for auditing the EFA Program, audits of individual schools are the responsibility of the \nschools themselves and are expected to be carried out by private audit firms. \n ", " \nPROGRAM POLICY MATRIX AND DEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER  4\n8\n   \n \nTable A6: Program Policy Matrixa     \n \n \n    \n \nA\nPROGRAM ACTIONS UNDER ESP I  p\np\ne\nPolicy Reform Area and  Policy Actions and First Tranche Release  Policy Actions and Second Tranche Release  n\nd\nObjectives  Conditions of Subprogram 1  Conditions of Subprogram 1  ix\n 6\nNepal Education for All, 2004- First Tranche Release Conditions  Second Tranche Release Conditions     \n2009      \n  \u2022  MOES to endorse the EFA core document and to  \u2022  MOES to prepare the EFA ASIP FY 2009 in accordance \nimplement the program in accordance with its policy  with EFA policy objectives and performance target, and \nobjectives and performance targets.   have it endorsed by JFA development partners, \n  including ADB.   \n\u2022  MOES to prepare the EFA annual strategic   \nimplementation plan (ASIP) for FY2007 in accordance  \u2022  MOES to achieve, in a manner acceptable to ADB the \nwith EFA policy objectives and performance targets, and  performance targets set in the ASIP for FY 2007.  \nhave it endorsed by JFA development partners,   \nincluding ADB.    \u2022  MOES to prepare a timebound action plan with resource \n  allocation on the implementation of the \n\u2022  NPC and MOF to approve the annual workplan and  recommendations of the EFA midterm review. \nbudget for FY2007.  \n \n\u2022  MOES to achieve, in a manner acceptable to ADB, the \nperformance targets set in the ASIP for FY 2006. \n   \n \nMEDIUM-TERM EFA POLICIES AND GOALS \nPolicy Objectives      Policy Actions   \n   \n1.

The School Sector Approach (SSA)b  \n \n1. Rationale. The development rationale of the 1\u201312 school sector reform and restructuring basic education is that the \npresent 10 years of schooling, including 5 years of primary education, is inadequate. 8 years of basic education is \nconsidered the minimum to perform civic duties diligently and to engage productively in occupations. Secondary \neducation prepares candidates for the job market as members of a skilled workforce. An equitable and strong 9\u201312 \nsecondary education is required to minimize the restricted access to secondary education caused by systemic \nbottlenecks. A combined 9\u201312 system will enable more candidates to complete grade 12. The structural integration of \ngrades  1\u20135  with  6\u20138  will  enable  curricular  integration,  leading  to  a  competency-based  learning  program. \nConsolidation will make teachers, head teachers, and SMC training more efficient.  A 1\u20138 basic education structure \nwill have a positive impact on teacher management and development. An integrated 1\u201312 school sector will help the \nGovernment and its development partners determine Nepal\u2019s human development goals, needs and resource \nrequirements in a holistic manner. The Education For All NPA, 2001\u20132015 emphasises the need to harmonize school \neducation by integrating the 1\u201312 school system. The Tenth Five-Year Development Plan, 2002-07 (the Tenth Plan) \nstresses the need to adopt a holistic approach to the school sector.  \n2. Assumptions. The Government will be able to initiate reforms under the following assumptions.  \n(i)  Political stability: a stable representative system of government will emerge from the current political situation. \n(ii)  Peace: there will be lasting peace in the country. \n(iii)  Degree of decentralization: the clear demarcation between the functions, authorities, and responsibilities of \ncentral and local bodies will be determined in a timely manner. \n(iv)  Economic growth: there  will be sufficient economic growth to support and sustain education reform and \nrestructuring. \n(v)  System capacity: there is sufficient infrastructure and human capacity at each level to support preparation and \nimplementation.   \n(vi)  Inter-ministerial and inter-institutional synergy: there is a consensus on the vision, goals, and strategies for \nattaining national educational objectives. \n3. Objectives. The objective of school sector reform and restructuring is to make school education effective, \ninclusive, equitable, pro-poor, and rights-based. The objectives of the school sector approach (SSA) are to: (i) provide \na policy framework to facilitate the reform process for an integrated school sector; (ii) enhance all aspects of quality \neducation to meet the needs and aspirations of the people; and (iii) hold the Government, local bodies, schools, and \nstakeholders (e.g., SMC, teachers, parents, and local body) accountable for student learning. \n4. Policy Directions  \n \n  a. School Structure   \nSchool education will comprise grades 1\u201312. Basic education will be grades 1 to 8, and secondary 9 to 12.  The \nvocational education stream will begin at grade 9. After completing their 3 years of education, vocational stream \nstudents will be given opportunities to enter tertiary education by completing an additional 1-year bridging course. \nStudents who are enrolled in non-formal education programs can obtain certificates through school equivalency tests. \nFormal and non formal education will be made compatible to permit students to complete their education through \neither system.  \n \n  b. Management Structure   \nWithin the education sector, the relationships of authority, accountability, and responsibility between the national, \nsub-national, and local levels will be fully aligned with any restructuring of the overall governance systems.  \n \n   c. School Operation   \nSchools for basic education and secondary education will be encouraged to operate as separate entities in terms of \ntheir management, administration, and financing. Schools will teach either primary or secondary grades. Provisions of \nalternative programs\u2014such as out-of-school, flexible learning, and open or distance learning\u2014will cater to the needs \nof a diverse population of learners. These alternatives will provide access to school education to a wider population \nwith special needs, such as street children and children from migrant communities.  \n \n  d. Entitlements   \nThe basic education will be free and compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14. Children currently \nenrolled in schools will continue to receive the entitlement. Free education will cover basics such as admission, \ntextbooks, tuition, and examinations. Secondary education will be provided on a cost-sharing basis. However, \narrangements will be made to ensure free secondary education to children from disadvantaged communities.  \n   ", "60          Appendix 9 \n  e. Decentralization  \nSchools will be managed in a decentralized way. The emphasis will be placed on school-based management, which \nwill be accountable to a local body. The schools\u2019 accountability and autonomy will be ensured in terms of school \ngovernance, management, resourcing, and quality assurance.  Schools will follow a transparent model of operation \nand will adopt a mechanism for social auditing for financial transactions and programme performance. Local bodies, \nsuch as VDCs and municipalities will be responsible for the planning and management of basic education. DDCs and \nmunicipalities will be responsible for the planning and management of secondary education. DDC planning and \nmanagement activities will include school clustering, coordination, resourcing, and developing operational guidelines, \nincluding setting their own targets for quality education. The SMC will be responsible for the management and \noperation of the school.  \n \n  f. Social Inclusion  \nThe overarching strategy for the SSA will be social inclusion. Special attention will be paid to increasing participation \nof women, Dalits, members of ethnic minorities, disabled, and marginalized groups in the management of schools, \nand to increasing the number of teachers from these populations. \n \n  g. Instructional Arrangement  \nTeaching modalities, such as grade and multi-grade teaching, will be determined by the school management in \nconsultation with the local body and within nationally defined guidelines.  \n  \n  h. Medium of Instruction  \nA child\u2019s mother tongue will be employed as the medium of instruction up to grade 3. To ensure that children learn in \ntheir mother tongue, the SMC will determine the language(s) of instruction in consultation with the local bodies such \nas DDCs and VDCs. Grades 4 and 5 can follow a transition from the mother-tongue medium of instruction to the \nNepali medium of instruction. From grades 6 to 8, the medium of instruction will be fully in Nepali.  English will be \ntaught as a subject from grade 4. In secondary education the medium of instruction will be determined by the SMC in \nconsultation with the DDC or  municipality through the DEO.   \n \n  i. Teachers   \nSMCs will recruit teachers from among those who obtained teaching licenses, based on guidelines provided by the \nMOES. SMCs will adopt competitive and transparent selection procedures to recruit teachers. The MOES will issue \ndirectives for teachers\u2019 service conditions. Priority will be given to recruiting females, Dalits, and other disadvantaged \ngroups when filling teacher positions, particularly in basic education. The minimum qualification for teachers of basic \neducation will be graduation from the Higher Secondary Education or Intermediate Level. During the interim phase, \ncandidates with SLCs will be considered on a case-by-case basis. New entrants in secondary education must have \nattained a master\u2019s degree, or an equivalent qualification. During the interim phase, candidates with bachelor\u2019s \ndegrees will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Teachers currently working in the primary schools with SLC \nqualifications and in secondary schools with a bachelor's degree will be provided with training opportunities to enable \nthem to meet the minimum requirements. After the interim phase, incentive packages for voluntary retirement will be \nprovided for teachers who do not meet the new minimum requirements. Provisions will be made to prepare a \nseparate cadre of teachers specializing in multi-grade teaching. Specific terms and conditions for multi-grade \nteachers will be developed. Two separate professional career development paths will be offered: one for basic and \none for secondary teachers. Teachers\u2019 qualifications and performance will be linked with their career development, \nincluding their salary structure. \n \n  j. Head Teacher  \nA separate position for head teacher will be created in full-fledged 1-8 and 9-12 schools. In 1-12 schools, there will be \none head teacher and a separate level from among the teachers will be designated in-charge of basic and secondary \neducation. The head teacher's job will be technical, managerial, and administrative in nature. SMCs will appoint head \nteachers on a contractual basis. The terms and conditions of the head teacher will be determined by the MOES.   \n \n  k. Private-Public Partnerships  \nBasic education provisions will be the responsibility of the state. The role of private schools in basic education will be \ngradually reduced. The role of the private sector will be encouraged in ECD and secondary education. Attention will \nbe given to ensuring adequate access to disadvantaged populations. Community-operated institutional schools (trust \nschools) will be encouraged to provide free education. Again, attention will be given to ensuring adequate access to \ndisadvantaged populations. Partnerships between public and private institutions in secondary education will be \nencouraged.  \n \n  l. Quality and Accountability  \nThe Government will develop a national framework of norms and standards for quality education. The school will, \nwithin the national framework, define its own targets in response to local needs and conditions. For basic education, \n   ", "Appendix 9          61 \nschools will be accountable for a child\u2019s learning, parents and guardians will be accountable for their child\u2019s regular \nattendance,  and  the  state  will  be  accountable  for  providing  the  minimum  enabling  conditions  (including  an \nenvironment for equitable participation, appropriate classrooms, instructional materials, and teachers).  \n \n  m. Student Evaluation  \nA liberal promotion policy up to grade 7 will be adopted. This policy will be implemented in a phased manner. Schools \nwill be supported to develop and adopt a continuous assessment system to ensure students achieve minimum \nlearning competencies. Remedial support will be offered if required. District level examinations will be held at grade 8 \nand will be managed at the district level. Technical support for the examination systems will be provided in each \ndistrict. The present SLC board and the Higher Secondary Education Board will be transformed into the NEB, which \nwill be autonomous. Grade 10 examinations will be conducted at the regional level with certification through NEB. \nGrade 12 examinations will be managed and conducted by the NEB itself.   \n \n  n. Linkage  \nSchool education will be linked with ECD programs, non-formal and open learning, technical education, vocational \ntraining, and university education. The Government will encourage international and national NGOs and private \nsector partnerships to expand provisions of ECD, non-formal and open learning, technical education, and vocational \ntraining. \n \n  o. School Financing   \nFinancing policy will be aimed at increasing school autonomy. Various financing methods, including block and \nearmarked grants and needs- and results-based financing, will be employed to ensure flexibility and accountability. \nThere will be a gradual increase in funding or support targeted at disadvantaged areas and groups to redress past \nimbalances. The state will not reduce its current level of funding to schools. School finances will be provided by \ncentral and local agencies. The share and contribution of local bodies, including VDC, municipality, and DDC, will be \ndefined by the state. Mechanisms will be installed for the effective use of resources in schools. School financing will \nbe accountable and transparent.  \n \n  p. Funding Agency Financing  \nThe Government will adopt a policy to encourage a program-based approach (PBA) supported by development \npartners through pooling arrangements and the use of country\u2019s system.   \n \n  q. Monitoring and Supervision \nTo continuously improve quality, MOES will develop a system of monitoring and supervision based on national \nstandards and targeted at school performance.  School performance will be evaluated and support will be provided \nfor improving quality. \n5. Structural and Functional Adjustment  \n \n  a. Function Allocation and Accountability   \nMOES will be accountable for policy formulation, follow-up, coordination, and review and monitoring. The central level \nMinistries and agencies will be responsible for facilitating program implementation and coordination. The regional \neducation directorates will be made responsible for the conduct of the regional level grade 10 examinations and will \nprovide support for the grade 12 school leaving examinations. They will also be coordinating with the Teacher Service \nCommission activities. The district education offices will be responsible for making logistical arrangements for school \ngovernance,  management, planning, financing, quality  assurance, and the education management information \nsystem (EMIS). A sub-district level mechanism will be established and will be  responsible for teacher support and \nquality enhancement. The SMC will be responsible for teacher management, financing, planning, target setting, and \nfor ensuring student learning. The parent teacher association (PTA) will be responsible for providing feedback to \nteachers. Parents will be responsible for providing support and a home environment conducive to their child\u2019s \nlearning. \n \n  b. School Performance Review Mechanism   \nTo enhance the quality of learning in schools, their performance must be regularly reviewed. There should be regular \nfeedback and rewards. Such reviews will help to establish a system of accountability and transparency and to \nencourage the school system to adopt more targeted and needs-based interventions. The review office will be an \nindependent body under the EPC of the MOES. As an extension of the review office, district level review panels will \nwork in collaboration with teacher unions, SMCs, PTAs, teachers, and other professionals. The resource centre \nsystem will support schools that need special attention in terms of technical support and resources. \n \n \n   ", "62          Appendix 9 \n \n  c. Changes to Laws and Regulations  \nA legislative and regulatory framework will be developed to govern the structural and functional adjustments in the \nMOES system. Provisions for free and compulsory basic education will be made in the law. Amendments will be \nmade to the Education Act, its regulations and by-laws. Guidelines will be issued to harmonize SSA implementation. \n \n  d. Resourcing  \nThe Government of Nepal is committed to implementing a 1 to 12 school sector program. The Tenth Five-Year \nDevelopment Plan, 2002-07; the NPA; the medium-term expenditure framework; and the education sector business \nplan stipulate that the 1 to 12 school sector will receive the resources it needs. Commitments from the development \npartner community were reflected in the Nepal Development Forum 2004. The aides-memoire of the EFA and SESP \nmissions in June 2006 clearly demonstrated the interest and strong support from development partners for school \nsector program implementation. Local bodies, including DDCs, municipalities, and VDC, have made provisions for \nschool education development. \n \n  e.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national priority    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national    Yes \nin country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n    No  agreement?        No \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \nThe Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy (PRSP) is the Tenth Five-Year Development Plan, 2002-07 (the Tenth \nPlan). It recognizes the critical role of education in poverty reduction and aims to reduce the overall poverty incidence \nto 30% by 2007, and to significantly improve the living conditions of the poor. The PRSP is built on four pillars: (i) \nbroad-based economic growth; (ii) human development; (iii) targeted programs to foster social inclusion of the very \npoor, vulnerable, and historically deprived groups; and (iv) good governance. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \n(CSP) 2005\u20132009 for Nepal is based on the Government\u2019s strategic priorities as set out in the Tenth Plan and focuses \non promoting broad-based economic growth, inclusive social development, and good governance.  \nThe biggest problem facing education in Nepal is the lack of universal access to effective education.  Some schools \nare disadvantaged because they are affected by: (i) the internal conflict; (ii) the income level of the parents; \n(iii) disparity in gender, ethnic and caste participation; (iv) shortages of teachers; and (v) regional disparity. There are \ndisparities in infrastructure, basic services, libraries, teaching and learning materials, level of teacher training, lack of \nqualified teachers, and ability to raise funds for school development.   \n \nPrivate schools perform better and their results at the school leaving certificate (SLC) examination are better. Public schools \nsuffer from poor learning environments, inadequate teaching facilities, and weak performance of teachers, especially in \nremote areas. These schools lag behind in term of performance. Public school students come from low- income families, \nwhile private schools cater to those who can afford to pay. To achieve poverty reduction in Nepal, the key challenge is to \nimprove the quality and efficiency of public education. The quality of education is low in most rural areas. Schools in these \nareas often do not possess basic requirements, such as water, sanitation, and libraries. Although education is free, poor \nparents are often unable to meet other expenses, such as uniforms, writing materials, transportation costs, and the \nopportunity costs of sending children to school. Poor students have limited access to quality education in public schools, \nwhich results in significant inequity between the poor and the better off who attend private schools. \n \nESP I will increase social benefits among socially and economically disadvantaged groups. Better access to an \naffordable quality education will ensure that such groups will be able to generate the education and social capital \nneeded to build economically and socially responsible lives. A shift to an egalitarian and inclusive education system \nwill mitigate the root causes of conflict and social tension, build social cohesion, and bring social stability. Improved \naccess to post-primary and basic education for girls and women will enhance women\u2019s role in political, economic, and \nsocial spheres. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                       Proposed Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nNepal\u2019s per capita income is $280 per annum. Human development indicators are poor. A large section of the \npopulation has little access to basic social services. Nepal has, however, made significant progress in human \ndevelopment and in reducing poverty in the past decade. Poverty incidence is estimated to have declined to 31% in \n2004. In the Kathmandu Valley, the poverty rate is only 4%, but in rural Nepal it is 10 times higher. It is even more \nsevere in the most remote regions (72% in the mid and far western regions). Similarly, social and human development \nindicators, such as life expectancy, infant and maternal mortality rates, the adult literacy rate, and primary school \nenrollment have all improved significantly in the past decade. \nThe 59 recognized indigenous ethnic groups, identified on the basis of linguistic and socio-cultural characteristics from \nthe dominant Hindu caste population, comprise about 37% of the population. \u201cDalit\u201d is a collective term for so-called \ndisadvantaged castes (about 15% of Nepal\u2019s population). There are large income disparities related to gender, caste, \nand ethnicity. Generally, households headed by women have lower incomes than those headed by men. On average, \nthe earnings of Dalits are less than half of those of members of upper caste groups. Indigenous ethnic groups earn \nonly slightly more. Such disparities are not confined to economic factors, as there are significant regional inequalities. \nHuman development indicators (HDIs) for rural areas are 30-40% lower than for urban areas. HDIs for Dalits are only \nabout half of those of the upper caste groups and HDIs for ethnic groups are only slightly better. Almost two thirds of \nNepalese women cannot read or write, compared with one third of men. Females receive only half the number of \nyears of schooling received by males.  \n \n   ", "Appendix 13          69 \nPoverty and inequality, and inadequate employment opportunities have fuelled frustrations. The insurgency has \nexacerbated poverty in the affected areas and at the national level. It has greatly reduced development activities, \ncaused considerable damage and destruction to public and private property, and forced many to migrate. At the \nnational level, per-capita income growth was negative for 2001/02. Conflict-related budgetary pressures reduced \noverall development spending in 2002/03 to the lowest level in real terms in the past 10 years. However, a new \nGovernment was formed in April 2006 and appears committed to tackling problems of social injustice.  \n \nThe Education Sector  Program I (ESP I) supports the country\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion.  \nThe Government\u2019s EFA program is directly contributing to the achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nand thus ESP I will be directly supporting achievement of the MDG targets in education. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nDuring project preparation, stakeholder consultations were conducted at the central level, but because of the security \nsituation consultations at district and school levels were more limited. Views were sought on various issues, including \ndecentralization, teacher management, and social inclusion.   \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe transition to an integrated 1\u201312 school sector will require a demand analysis. Stakeholder participation will be a \nkey strategy for the sector reform. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nADB\u2019s CSP is committed to helping the Government address gender, ethnic, and other forms of discrimination by \n(i) encouraging inclusive public policies; (ii) mainstreaming antidiscrimination measures in ADB-supported education \nand civil service reform initiatives; (iii) building institutional capacity to foster inclusion and promote gender equality; \nand  (iv)  providing  targeted  interventions  to  empower  poor  women.  ADB  will  strongly  support  inclusive  social \ndevelopment, particularly human resource development that aims to (i) empower the poor and excluded through social \nmobilization  and  awareness,  and  (ii)  promote  the  skills  needed  for  remunerative  employment  and  for  raising \nproductivity. Key priorities will be to improve vocational training and the quality of primary and secondary education. \n \nExtensive evidence from South Asia shows that female education generally promotes labour force participation and \nhigher wages for women, especially if women reach secondary and higher levels of education. It also encourages \nsmaller, healthier and better educated families and enhances women\u2019s own wellbeing. Studies have shown that \nincreasing the proportion of girls with secondary level education corresponds with fewer early marriages, reduced infant \nmortality rates, and greater participation of women in family decisions.  Because female education helps slow population \ngrowth while raising the productivity of the present and future generations, higher female enrollment at the primary level \nand longer schooling will promote faster growth of per capita income. Given the enormous returns to female education, it \nis essential that the Government of Nepal maintains a strong focus on increasing access for women and for retaining girls \nin primary and secondary schools, particularly those from poor and disadvantaged families.a  \n \nNational policies in Nepal promote gender equality and guarantee women\u2019s human and fundamental rights. However, \nNepal\u2019s state laws, as well as traditional values, still relegate women to inferior status. The gender development index \n(GDI), which covers life expectancy, literacy and education, shows that Nepal\u2019s achievement was 0.452 overall in 2004. \nThe GDI for rural areas was 0.430 while for urban areas it was 0.562.  The gender empowerment measure index was \n0.391 in 2004.   Women\u2019s labor force participation was 70% in 2004, mostly in the low wage informal sector. Only 8-10% \nare engaged in the formal sector. The mean years of schooling for females is 1.95 compared with 3.56 for males in 2004. \nThe enrollment of girls in primary education in 2005 is about 47% and with the gap with boys is closing. Poverty, gender \ndisparities, early marriages, and lack of mobility, deprive girls of the benefit of primary and particularly secondary \neducation. The overall primary student enrollment growth from 2003 to 2005 was 5.8% (8.1% for girls and 3.8% for boys). \nThese positive growth rates are attributed to the provision of EFA scholarships for girls and to school enrollment \ncampaigns. In 2005, 25% of government primary teachers were female, for lower secondary it was 12% and for \nsecondary it was 7%. About 3.5% of head teachers are women. The ESP I will support the following EFA strategies: \n \n(i)  implementation of the Government\u2019s girls\u2019 education strategy and action plan;  \n(ii)  a scholarship program for 50% of poor girl students; \n \n   ", "70          Appendix 13 \n(iii)  improvements to basic facilities in schools, including building separate toilets for girls and boys; and \n(iv)  increasing the female teacher ratio and the rational distribution of female teachers.                                       \n \nHas an output been prepared?
