This  has  resulted  in  rapid \ndeterioration  of  the  state  road  network,  quickly  increased \nroad transport capacity bottlenecks, unreliable road transport \nservices  for  the  state  economy  and  the  poor,  who  comprise \n38%  of  the  total  population  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  This,  in \ncombination with inefficient use of scarce financial resources \nfor  road  maintenance,  has  become  one  of  the  major \nconstraints to the state\u2019s social and economic development.  \n \nTo  rectify  the  situation  and  enable  the  Madhya  Pradesh \nGovernment  (MPG)  to  manage  the  state  road  network  more \neffectively  and  efficiently,  and  ensure  reliable  road  transport \nservices \nthe  state\u2019s  economic  and  social \ndevelopment, institutional reform has become crucial.  \n \nThe  reform  is  expected  to  help  establish  a  transparent  and \nconducive environment for private sector participation that will \nimprove  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  road  sector \nmanagement, and foster competition. This will in turn ensure \nbetter infrastructure facilities and decrease recurrent costs for \nroad maintenance over the medium- and long-terms to allow \nhigher  capital  and  expenditure  for  priority  social  sectors  and \npoverty  reduction.  Furthermore,  the  investment  component \nwill  generate  employment  opportunities  and  benefit  other \nsectors, thereby contributing to poverty reduction.  \n \nMadhya Pradesh is a focal state for ADB\u2019s lending activities.  \nThus,  two  loans  were  approved,  one  for  public  sector \nresource management and the other for power sector reform. \nThe  SDP  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  loan  to  the  state  road  sector. \n\nto  support \n\n\fii \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n \nObjectives \n\n \nComponents and Outputs \n\nADB  has,  together  with  the  Government  of  India  (the \nGovernment),  developed  a  holistic  approach  to  guide  ADB\u2019s \ninterventions in the state road sector. \n \nThe medium- to long-term objectives of ADB\u2019s operations are \nto  (i)  improve  governance  and  accountability  of  the  sector \nmanagement  by  reengineering  the  current  Public  Works \nDepartment  structure  and  building  capacity,  (ii)  initiate  an \nenabling environment for better private sector participation in \ndevelopment of the sector, and (iii) establish a more effective \nasset  management  mechanism  and  sustainable  funding  of \nroad  maintenance.  The  SDP  focuses  on  the  institutional \nreengineering  of  PWDGoMP  and  capacity  building  for  a \nreliable institutional framework for more effective and efficient \nstate road sector management. \n \n \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Program  is  to  enable  MPG  to \nestablish  a  more  effective  and  efficient  state  road  sector \nmanagement  system  and  ensure  reliable  road  transport \nservices  to  support  Madhya  Pradesh  economic  and  social \ndevelopment, and thus reduce poverty. \n \nThe objectives of the Program are  to be achieved through (i) \ninstituting  measures  for  good  governance  in  administration \nand  management  of  the  sector,  (ii)  improving  capability  and \nbuilding  capacity  for  effective  road  asset  management,  (iii) \nbuilding  capacity  to  improve  institutional  effectiveness  and \nefficiency,  and  (iv)  initiating  steps  to  identify  pilot  cases  for \noutsourcing and better private sector participation.  \n \nThe \nto \nundertake a number of policy actions, including (i) setting up \na state highway zone (SHZ) within PWDGoMP as an interim \nmeasure with necessary staffing and institutional authority to \nintegrate  key  responsibilities  and  functions  to  manage  state \nroads, implement the SDP, and prepare for transforming the \nSHZ into the SHA; (ii) transforming  the SHZ into the SHA as \na self-contained and fully functional agency to take over state \nroad management; (iii) staffing the SHA, at headquarters and \nregional  levels,  with  the  right  skills    to  make  it  a  lean  and \nefficient  organization  responsible  for  road  sector  policy, \nresource  management,  development  planning  and  asset \nmanagement; \nimplementing  modern  planning  and \ndecision-making tools and preparing 5 year and annual road \nsector  development  and  maintenance  plans  based  on \neconomic  and  other  clearly-defined  sector  performance \ncriteria; (v) improving internal business processes to enhance \nefficiency,  management \noperational \n\nthe  Program  requires  MPG \n\nimplementation  of \n\nfinancial \n\nand \n\n(iv) \n\n\fiii \n\ntraffic  growth \n\ntransparency,  and  service  quality; \n\n(vi) \naccountability, \nimplementing  a  staff  rationalization  program  as  approved  by \nMPG  through  implementing  a  labor  rationalization  program  \nfollowing  the  Government\u2019s  \u2013Voluntary  Retirement  Scheme \nfor  government  employees  and  statutory  reduction  of \nnonpermanent employees following the Industrial Dispute Act \n1947  to  free    more  funds  for  road  maintenance  works;  (vii) \nsecuring  adequate  budget  allocation  to  ensure  sustainable \nfunding  of  road  maintenance  in  the  near  term  until  further \neconomic  development  and \nsupport \nestablishment  of  a  road  maintenance \nfund;  and  (viii) \nintroducing effective vehicle overloading controls to preserve \nroads  and  road  safety  programs  to  reduce  road  deaths  and \ninjuries. \n \nA  loan  of  $30  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nwill be provided under ADB\u2019s London Interbank Offered Rate- \nbased  (LIBOR-based)  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a \nterm  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility and other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft Loan Agreements. \n \nThe  Program  will  be  implemented  over  30  months.  The \nprogram loan of $30 million will be released in two tranches. \nThe first tranche of $12 million is anticipated to be released in \nDecember  2002.  The  second  tranche  of  $18  million  is \nexpected to be released by June 2005. \n \nThe  Executing  Agency \nthe \nDepartment  of  Finance  of  the  Government  of  Madhya \nPradesh (FDGoMP). \n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  eligible \nitems  produced \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  member \ncountries, other than items specified in the negative list in the \nprogram loan agreement, and imports to be financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. \n \nCounterpart  funds  generated  by  the  program  loan  proceeds \nwill be transferred by the Government of India to MPG and be \nused  by  MPG  under  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to \nsupport the reform and meet the adjustment costs associated \nwith the Program as agreed upon by the Borrower, including \nimplementation  of  labor  rationalization,    road  safety,    and  \noverloading control programs. \n \n \n \nThe project will rehabilitate the dramatically deteriorated and \n\nin  and  procured \n\nthe  program \n\nloan \n\nfor \n\nis \n\n \nFinancing  Plan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nThe Project Loan \n \nObjectives \n\n\f \nComponents and Outputs \n\n \nCost Estimates and \nFinancing Plan \n\niv \n\n \n \n\n \nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n \n \n \n \nProcurement  and  Consulting \nServices \n\nincluding  $180.1  million  of \n\ndamaged  state  road  corridors  to  provide  reliable  road \ntransport  services  and  support  social  and  economic \ndevelopment programs, and thus reduce poverty. \n \n \nThe Project is designed to rehabilitate about 1,750 kilometers \nof  state  roads  identified  from  important  state  road  corridors, \nincluding  (i)  state  roads  linking  with  the  north-south  national \nhighway  corridor,  important  industrial  centers,  and  major \ndistrict  roads;  (ii)  state  roads  with  relatively  high  traffic \nvolumes  providing  transport  services  for  the  predominant \nagricultural production; (iii) rural connectivity roads to benefit \nthe rural poor with better access to the mainstream economy \nand  business  opportunities;  (iv)  equipment  necessary  for \nPWDGoMP  to  ensure  quality  control,  improve  operational \nefficiency,  and  provide  emergency  relief;  and  (v)  consulting \nservices for construction supervision. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  in  2002  prices  is  estimated  at  $261.2 \nmillion  equivalent, \nforeign \nexchange cost representing 69% of the total project cost. The \nlocal  currency  cost,  including  taxes  and  duties,  is  estimated \nat  $81.1  million  equivalent  representing  31%  of  the  total \nproject  cost.  The  cost  estimate  includes  contingencies,  a \nfront-end  fee  of  1%  of  the  total  project  loan  amount,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum and interest charge \nduring construction period, and a repayment of $350,000 for \nthe  portion  of  the  project  processing  TA  fund  exceeding \n$250,000.  \n \n \nA  loan  of  $150  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources to finance 81% of the foreign exchange cost \nand  2%  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  the  Project,  or  57%  of \nthe  total  Project  cost.  MPG  will  finance,  from  its  own \nresources,  the  remaining  19%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost \nand  entire  local  currency  cost,  including  taxes,  duties,  and \nother  associated  costs, \ninterest  during \nconstruction, and commitment charges. \n \nPWDGoMP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project. \nWithin PWDGoMP, the state highway zone (SHZ) will be the \nImplementing Agency until the state highway authority (SHA) \nand its regional offices are fully functional and responsible for \nthe day-to-day implementation of the Project. The Project will \nbe implemented over a period of 5 years from January 2003 \nto December 2007. \n \nADB  has  approved  advance  procurement  for  phase  I  civil \nworks  (about  350  km  of  state  highways)  and  consulting \nservices  for  construction  supervision.  All  procurement  to  be \n\nfront  end \n\nfee, \n\n\fv \n\nto  markets  and  social  services \n\nfinanced  under  the  project  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nfor  Procurement. \nConsulting services to be financed under the project loan will \nbe  recruited  using  quality  and  cost-based  selection    in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other procedures satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment \nof domestic consultants. \n \nThe  social  and  poverty  assessments  show  that  the  main \nbeneficiaries of the SDP are people living in the predominant \nagricultural,  rural,  and  economically  backward  areas.  The \nSDP is expected to benefit 10 million people in a 30 km zone \nof influence around the state roads to be improved. Of these, \nan estimated 5 million poor people will be direct beneficiaries, \nor about 50% of the total direct beneficiaries. \n \nThe main quantifiable benefits of the Project are (i) savings in \nvehicle  operating  costs,  which  will  be  passed  on  to  the  rural \npoor through service providers; and (ii) savings in travel time.  \nNonquantifiable  benefits  will  be  realized  through  improved \nfor  agricultural \naccess \npopulation and rural poor, which reflects higher profit for poor \nfarmers,  and  lower  cost  and  more  timely  access  to  schools, \nmedical clinics, and employment centers. \n \nThe  Project  will  help  reduce  poverty  by  lowering  transport \ncosts  for  the  poor  farmers  and  lower  cost  and  more  timely \naccess to schools, medical clinics, and employment centers.  \nThe  lower  transport  costs  will  also  increase  mobility  among \nthe poor, especially poor women going to social centers, and \nallow them to become more politically active, thus increasing \ntheir empowerment.  \n \nThe reform is expected to involve reduction of approximately \n7,800  permanent  and  8,000  nonpermanent  employees.  To \nensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  social  protection  framework, \nMPG has adopted a social safety net program to provide job \ncounseling, information services, and training. \n \nThe Project is classified as environment category B. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken \nand  the  summary  IEE  is  a  supplementary  appendix.  Social \nimpacts of the SDP will be mitigated through implementation \nof  a  social  safety  net  program  under  the  Program.  The \nProject  will  have  minimal  social  impacts  on  the  project  area, \nwhich can be mitigated.  \n\n \nTA  for  Institutional  Strengthening  and  Capacity  Building  for \nMadhya  Pradesh  State  Road  Sector  has  been  designed  to \nassist MPG to implement the institutional reform. Specifically, \n\n \nBenefits and Beneficiaries \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nEnvironmental Assessment \nand Social Measures \n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n\f \nRisks and Safeguards \n\nvi \n\n \n \n\nrequired \n\nfinancing  and \n\nthe TA will (i) help MPG build institutional capacity to support \nrecovery  and  development  of  the  state  road  network;  (ii) \nstrengthen  PWDGoMP\u2019s  capabilities  in  transport  planning, \nproject \ninvestment  management,  and \nenvironmental  management  by  introducing  internationally \nrecognized  principles;  (iii)  provide  training  programs  to \ndisseminate  findings  and  recommendations  on  the  reform \nand improvement of the state road sector management; and \n(iv)  assist  PWDGoMP  to  implement  the  labor  rationalization  \nand    social  safety  net  programs  for  the  employees  to  be \nretrenched. The TA will be financed by the Government of the \nUnited  Kingdom  for  $1.5  million  and  MPG  for  $0.4  million \nequivalent  in  kind  and  administered  by  ADB.  About  84 \nperson-months  of \ninternational  and  domestic  consulting \nservices will be required. \n \nRisks  to  the  sector  reform  relate  to  MPG\u2019s  political  will  and \nimplementation  abilities \nin  making  policy  changes  and \nmitigating adverse impacts because it focuses on governance \nand  staff  rationalization.  MPG  has  successfully  implemented \nsimilar  reforms  in  the  power  sector  and  public  resource \nmanagement  with  ADB  assistance.  MPG  has  developed  the \ncapacity \nthrough \nimplementing a voluntary retirement scheme for public sector \nundertakings,  although  this  is  the  first  time  that  government \nemployees will be involved in a labor rationalization program. \nAdditionally,  ADB  will  conduct  frequent  policy  dialogue  with \nMPG  and  strengthen  supervision  and  review  of  program \nimplementation  to  ensure  that  the  reform  objectives  are  well \nunderstood,  the  long-term  reform  agenda  is  kept  on  track, \nand  policy  actions  are  taken  as  stated  in  the  policy  matrix. \nThe  tranching  and  monitoring  of  compliance  with  tranche \nrelease  conditions  have  incorporated  time-bound  reform \nmeasures to ensure successful implementation of the reform. \nThe  associated  TA  will  further  strengthen  PWDGoMP\u2019s \nimplementation capacity and help it implement the reform. \n \nRisks  for  the  Project  are  limited  to  ensuring  quality  control \ndue  to  PWDGoMP\u2019s  limited  capacity  to  carry  out  effective \ncontract  management  and  supervision  of  works.  However, \nthis  can  be  mitigated  by  hiring  consulting  services  for \nconstruction  supervision  and  capacity  building  programs  for \nPWDGoMP  on  contract  management  and  quality  control. \nContracts have been divided into relatively large packages to \nattract  international  and  large  qualified  domestic  contractors \nto  ensure  good  performance  by  contractors  and  high  quality \nconstruction. \n\nfor  handling \n\nissues \n\nlabor \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n \n\n \n \nA. \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) two proposed \nloans  to  India  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Roads  Sector  Development  Program  (SDP)  that \ncomprises  a  Program  Loan  and  a  Project  Loan;  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for Madhya Pradesh State \nRoad Sector. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nRecent Macroeconomic Performance and Prospects \n\n2. \nMadhya Pradesh was one of the poorest states in India. It was the largest state in land \narea and fourth in population until it was bifurcated into Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on 1 \nNovember  2000  in  accordance  with  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Reorganization  Act  2000.  The \nbifurcation made Madhya Pradesh lose its rich coal, iron ore, limestone, and forest resources, \nwhich  were  prime  sources  of  industrial  growth  in  Madhya  Pradesh  before  the  bifurcation.  The \nstate economy had shown robust growth averaging 4.4% since 1980, accelerating to 5% during \n1990\u20131996.  While  contribution  of  the  primary  sector  in  state  domestic  product  declined \ngradually from 43.4 % in 1993 to 39.6% in 1999, the contribution of services and industry rose \nconsistently from 21.4% to 23% % during the same period.  \n \n3. \nAfter bifurcation, Madhya Pradesh retained about two thirds of its former land area and \npopulation, but has lost most of its natural resources to Chhattisgarh. Agriculture dominates the \neconomy,  with  small  manufacturing  and  service  sectors.  The  economy  has  been  performing \npoorly since 1996 with a weakening revenue base, as shown by the recent budget review under \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank(ADB)-financed  Public  Sector  Resource  Management  Program1, \nand fiscal deficit increasing from 5.4% in 1999 to 8% in 2001.   \n \nStructural  impediments  have  prevented  the  economy  from  reaching  its  potential  given \n4. \nthe  liberalized  policy  environment.  In  particular,  the  deteriorating  fiscal  health  of  the  state \ngovernment has significantly undermined the economy\u2019s long-term growth potential because of \ninadequate public investment. Industrial recession, acute power shortages and fast deterioration \nof  transport  infrastructure  facilities  led  to  a  sharp  decline  in  industrial  growth  in  Madhya \nPradesh.  The  growth  rate  of  the  state\u2019s  real  net  domestic  product  of  registered  manufacturing \ndeclined from 7.1% in 1994 to 4.4% in 1996, and to 1.1% in 1997. Many industrial units were \nforced to shut down, leading to large-scale unemployment. Many designated economic growth \ncenters  in  Madhya  Pradesh  failed  to  promote  industrialization  due  to  the  lack  of  basic \ninfrastructure such as roads. A recent survey by the Public Works Department of the Goernment \nof  Madhya  Pradesh  (PWDGoMP)  has  shown  that  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s  economy  is  severely \nconstrained  by  poor  road  infrastructure.  State  roads  are  generally  in  very  poor  condition.  The \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB, 1999.

Road  traffic  in \n2001  and  early  2002  on  most  of  the  state  road  sections  fell  into  the  very  low  range  of  500  to \n1,500 vehicles a day. This was partly due to the dramatic deterioration of the state roads, which \nforced almost all through traffic to use alternative routes in neighboring states. \n \n5. \nAlong with development of new strategies for stimulating industrial growth, the plans for \nindustrialization  in  Madhya  Pradesh  focus  primarily  on  promoting  industries  not  tied  to  natural \nresources, which will mostly depend on adequate infrastructure facilities, mainly inter and intra-\nstate road transport services. \n \n\nTransport Sector \n\n2. \n \nRailways  connecting  north-south  and  east-west  regions  of  India  pass  through  Madhya \n6. \nPradesh with a total length of about 5,900 km. However, due to Madhya Pradesh's vast area, \nthe  railway  services  cannot  provide  the  desired  connectivity  to  major  economic  zones  and \ncenters.  The  railway  network  traversing  Madhya  Pradesh  serves  the  needs  of  cross-country \ntraffic more than those of Madhya Pradesh. In total, 11 major districts in Madhya Pradesh  have \nlittle  rail  service.  Civil  aviation,  port,  and  inland  waterway  have  very  limited  role  in  the  state\u2019s \noverall  economy  and  transport  services.    As  a  result,  roads  are  the  predominant  mode  of \ntransport services. \n \n7. \nMadhya  Pradesh  has  202,240  kilometers  (km)  of  roads,  of  which  57,205  km  are \nsurfaced. State has 7,923 km of state highways, 4,717 km of national highways, 30,070 km of \ndistrict roads, and 159,530 of rural roads. Of the rural roads, 25,033 km are under PWDGoMP\u2019s \njurisdiction  while  the  remaining  134,497  km  are  under  the  responsibility  of  Madhya  Pradesh \nRural Road Development Authority (MPRRDA) and local village authorities (panchayats). \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Sector Institutions and Responsibilities \n\n \n8. \nThe  public  works  department  (PWD)  system  dates  back  to  the  mid-1850s,  and  is \noutmoded. Since then, the system has monopolized engineering, construction supervision, and \nmaintenance  services  for  all  infrastructure  facilities.  Because  of  the  monopoly,  the  system \ngenerates no incentive to adopt modern managerial mechanisms or to operate more efficiently. \nThe  system  does  not  provide  local  consultants  and  contractors  with  a  transparent  and \ncompetitive environment or opportunities to develop their capacity and competitiveness. This, in \ncombination  with  the  outdated  knowledge  and  skills  and  management  system,  has  made  the \nPWD system inefficient and ineffective. Its implementation capabilities are also very limited due \nto the slow turnover of staff and little opportunity for promotion and career development. \n\n \n9. \nPWDGoMP oversees planning, design, construction, and maintenance of all state roads, \nmajor  bridges,  and  government  and  public  services  buildings.  Jointly  with  local  district \ngovernments,  it  is  responsible  for  district  roads,  some  village  roads,  small  bridges,  and  other \nbuildings.  It  is  also  responsible  for  maintenance  of  national  highways  under  the  delegated \nauthority  and  responsibility  by  the  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways  (MORTH). \nResponsibility  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  most  village  roads  rests  with  Madhya \nPradesh\u2019s  rural  engineering  services  and  MPRRDA.  PWDGoMP\u2019s  poor  capability  in  effective \nplanning  and  programming,  low  capacity  for  management  and  quality  control  for  construction \nand  maintenance,  serious  shortage  of  financial  resources,  and  ineffective  management  of \nfinancial resources has resulted in substantive investment deficiencies in the state\u2019s road sector, \nand gross lack of maintenance of the road network. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\nLicensing,  registration,  and  regulation  of  motor  vehicles,  drivers,  and  passenger  and \n10. \nfreight transport is with the Madhya Pradesh Transport Department (MPTD). In 2001, over 2.9 \nmillion motor vehicles were registered of which 74% were motorcycles, 5% were cars and jeeps, \n3%  commercial  trucks,  2%  buses  and  minibuses,  2%  two-  and  three-wheeler  public  transport \nvehicles, 9% tractors, and 5% others. The state-owned Madhya Pradesh State Road Transport \nCorporation (MPSRTC) operates only 3% of the state\u2019s buses. Private sector operators provide \nmost of the services for passenger and freight transport. MPTD is also responsible for  enforcing \naxle  load  regulations.  It  has  a  system  of  39  weigh  stations  at  entry  points  into  the  state,  and \nmobile squads to carry out its responsibilities. Traffic police are responsible for enforcing traffic \nand road safety regulations. The traffic police are under the Police Department. \n \n\n4. \n\nSector Performance  \n\n \n11. \nPWDGoMP  performs  inadequately  in  its  responsibility  and  accountability  for  managing \nstate  roads,  mainly  due  to  a  lack  of  clear  objectives,  technical  capability,  and  institutional \ncapacity in sector policy formulation, investment planning and programming, project formulation, \nproject execution, and management of road maintenance.  \n\n \nPWDGoMP has too many personnel2 who account for more than 67% of the nonplanned \n12. \nbudget (for recurrent expenditures) or 29% of the total budget allocated to PWDGoMP for salary \npayment, thus reducing the available budget for materials and equipment essential for effective \nroad  maintenance.  The  skills  mix  is  inadequate  for  contemporary  needs.  A  hiring  freeze \nintended  to  limit  numbers  has  meant  that  engineers  with  up-to-date  skills  have  not  been \nrecruited. Training is only provided in administrative procedures, and professional staff have no \nmeans  of  upgrading  their  technical  skills.  Opportunities  for  promotion  are  limited.  As  a  result, \nPWDGoMP cannot maintain standards. Professional staff are discouraged and accountability is \nnot enforced.  The result is poor governance and poor sector management. \n\n \n\n13.  Management of state roads is linked to a very general development strategy and is not \nbased  on  performance.  Procedural  delays  in  administrative  processes  have  resulted  in \ninefficient  use  of  funds.  Financial  accounting  and  financial  management  systems  are  simple \nbookkeeping  system  performed  manually  and  recorded  in  a  loose  archive  system.  Road \nplanning is inadequate and suffers from a lack of reliable data. There is no ongoing process for \nidentifying  needs  and  planning  responses  based  on  a  development  strategy  and  applying \neconomic  criteria.  Data  required  for  strategic  planning  such  as  road  and  bridge  inventories, \ncondition,  traffic,  and  accident  locations  are  limited  and  not  updated  (the  last  official  traffic \nupdate was in 1995). \n \n14. \nIn-house  technical  design  capacity  is  limited  and  used  only  for  minor  works.    Road \nconstruction  methods  are  generally  outdated,  inefficient,  and  low  quality.  Construction \nsupervision by staff is mainly process-oriented without effective mechanisms to control quality, \nprogress,  and  costs.  Routine  maintenance  is  ineffective  because  there  is  insufficient \nnonplanedn  budget  for  materials,  plant,  and  equipment.  Plant  and  equipment  are  obsolete.3 \nGang labor is unproductive. There is no system of maintenance planning and accountability for \nperformance.  Periodic  maintenance  is  carried  out  mainly  through  contracting  but  supervision \nand quality control are inadequate.  A detailed analysis is provided in Appendix 1. \n                                                 \n2  PWDGOMP  has  18,616  comprising  18,616  permanent  employees  comprising  2,338  engineering  staff,  10,763 \nsupport  personnel,  and  5,515  tradesmen.  More  than  20,000  nonpermanent  laborers  are  employed  nominally  in \nmaintenance of roads and buildings. \n\n3  Road maintenance equipment and workshops are in a dilapidated condition. PWDGOMP is scrapping or auctioning \n\ndisused equipment and will hire equipment and transport in future. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n15. \nDue to a lack of management information and financial accounting systems, there are no \nreliable statistics and performance measures of previous programs and activities. Particularly, it \nis  difficult  for  PWDGoMP  to  extrapolate  detailed  information  on  budget  use  and  personnel \nmanagement to support its planning process and decisions on sector policies and reforms.  \n \n16. \nOverloading  of  vehicles  is  widespread,  magnifying  poor  road  conditions  created  by \ninadequate maintenance. MPTD data show that over 90% of the trucks passing through weigh \nstations are overloaded. This is also a national problem as most of the trucks are on interstate \njourneys. MPTD needs to strengthen enforcement of vehicle weight regulations.  Road safety is \na serious problem, and death4 and injury rates are high in comparison to developed countries.  \nThe  Police  Department  collects  accident  data  and  has  a  road  safety  education  program  but \nPWDGoMP does not appear to consider road safety as a part of its mandate. There is a need to \nestablish a road safety program in PWDGoMP to eliminate road safety hazards.  \n \n17. \nPrivate  sector  operators  provide  most  road  transport  services.  Services  are  generally \nadequate but travel is arduous and time-consuming due to the poor road conditions. The private \nsector does not provide services to many outlying districts and services to these districts have to \nbe provided by the state-owned MPRTC. The maximum fare that can be charged are regulated \nby MPTD and is presently set at Rs0.40 /km, which is one of the highest rates in India. Better \nroads will reduce vehicle-operating costs and lead to lower fares.  \n \nB. \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges to the Sector \n\n \n18. \nIn August 2001, MPG formulated a policy on road development for the Period 2001-2010 \n(PRD) aiming to improve the road network and maintenance and encourage private participation \nin the sector. The PRD recognized that improved road transport services is critical for the state\u2019s \neconomic and social development, and that road network built at huge costs have deteriorated \ndramatically,  largely  due  to:  (i)  continued  shortfalls  in  road  maintenance  investment,  (ii)  poor \nsector  management,  (iii)  non-performing  road  maintenance  system,  and  (iv)  an  increasing \nvolume of traffic and overloading. \n \n19. \nThe PRD identified creation of a state road maintenance fund (SRMF) as a priority. The \nSRMF is expected to help available resources to optimize road maintenance and leverage the \nresources  through  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  and  other  modalities  to  attract  private  sector \nfunding. \n \n20. \nHowever,  this  will  be  a  long-term  objective  because  road  users  can  not  afford  to  pay \nmuch, traffic volumes are moderate on most of the state roads, and technical and institutional \nsupport for identifying road user charges is lacking. Tolling on roads has been a well-accepted \npractice but it does not generate much revenue due to the low traffic volumes. Other revenue \nsources identified for the SRMF include assistance from the Central Road Fund, Mandi Cess,5 \nand  additional  fuel  levies  and  taxes  on  vehicles,  which  are  all  earmarked  for  specific  types  of \n\n                                                 \n4   In 2001, 3,860 deaths and 27,564 injuries were reported. The death rate of 124 per 100,000 vehicles is 5-8 times \n\nhigher than that in Europe or North America. \n\n5  A user charge on the use of market facilities developed by local governments for improvement of market access \n\nroads.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\n2. \n\nto \n\nincrease \n\nDevelopment Program \n\nretrenchment  program  and  measures \n\nprojects. In the near term of 5 years, the main source for funding road maintenance will largely \nbe the state budget. \n \n21.  MPG  has  recognized  the  significant  impact  of  overstaffing  its  state  departments  and \nintroduced a staff reduction scheme (SRS) in February 2000.  The SRS requires all government \ndepartments  to  reduce  their  staff  by  30%  through  natural  attrition,  reduction  in  sanctioned \npositions,  and  rationalization  programs.    This  has  entailed  identifying  surplus  staff,  freezing  of \nnew  hiring,  developing  voluntary  retirement  schemes  (VRS),  and  initiating  a  significant  and \nlabor  productivity.  The \nsensitive \nimplementation  of  the  SRS  follows  the  Government\u2019s  VRS  for  compensation  to  permanent \nemployees  and  the  Industrial  Dispute  Act  1947  (IDAct)  for  compensation  to  nonpermanent \nemployees.  The  MPG  also  developed  eligibility  criteria  and  administrative  procedures  for  the \nlabor rationalization. \n \n22. \nTo implement the PRD, PWDGoMP has prepared a master plan for 2001-2010, and the \n10th Five-Year Plan for 2002-2007, which covers the first 5 years of the master plan. Both plans \nhave  been  approved  by  MPG  in  October  2002.  The  master  plan  aims  to  remove  physical \nconstraints  on  15,000  km  of  state  roads  and  major  district  roads  by  rehabilitating  of  priority \ncorridors  connecting  to  national  highways,  rural  and  economically  backward  areas,  and \neconomic  development  zones.  For \nroad  maintenance,  a  computer-based  pavement \nmanagement  system  is  to  be  developed  so  PWDGoMP  can  evaluate  the  economic  effects  of \nroad maintenance alternatives and optimize road maintenance strategies. \n \n \n \n23. \nUnder  the  master  plan,  MPG  has  estimated  it  needs  about  $1  billion,  including  $430 \nmillion for road maintenance and $570 million for road rehabilitation and reconstruction. To meet \nthis demand, MPG, under its 10th Five-Year Plan, identified a total budget requirement of $655 \nmillion  including  the  $570  million  to  rehabilitate  about  4,770  km  of  state  highways  and  district \nroads, and $85 million for maintenance. \n \n \n \n24. \nBudget  allocated  to  the  road  sector  is  inadequate.    In  FY2002,  the  total  allocation  to \nPWDGoMP  amounted  to  $119  million  equivalent  comprising  $71  million  equivalent  for  capital \ninvestment and $48 million equivalent for recurrent cost. This is equivalent to 3.5% of the total \nstate  budget  of  $3.4  billion.    Especially  under  the  capital  investment  for  FY2002,  about  $43 \nmillion  equivalent  had  been  earmarked  to  repay  the  bonds  issued  for  roads  under  BOT \narrangement,  leaving  $23  million  for  rehabilitation  of  roads.  Under  the  recurrent  costs,  $32 \nmillion  equivalent  (or  67%)  was  spent  on  emoluments  for  labors  assigned  for  routine \nmaintenance.  This  left  a  small  budget  of  $16  million  equivalent  for  road  maintenance    and \nmaterials.  This could only meet the costs of routine maintenance for about 1,600 km of roads \nper year, or only 11% of the state road network. Based on information available, a preliminary \naudit  of  road  expenditures  and  financing  revealed  that  there  was  no  (i)  development  planning \nand  programming  for  investment  projects,  (ii)  internal  budgeting  principles  and  monitoring \nsystem  for  spending,  or  (iii)  financial  management  and  financial  accounting  systems.  Actual \nbudget  utilization  use  depended  highly  on  preference  of  PWDGoMP  management,  which  may \ndiffer every year.  \n \n25. \nPWDGoMP has been force account unit of MPG to implement infrastructure construction \nworks.  Its  performance  is  monitored  and  evaluated  by  total  spending  against  the  total  budget \n\nExpenditure and Financing \n\n3. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nPublic-Private Partnership (PPP) and BOT \n\nallocated.  A  detailed  review6  of  PWDGoMP\u2019s  budget  allocation  and  use  has  shown  that  its \nbudget  proposals  and  investment  plans  lack  technical  support  in  project  identification  and \nevaluation. \n \n \n \n26.  MPG  has  amended  the  Indian  Tolls  (Madhya  Pradesh)  Act  to  facilitate  private  sector \nparticipation in road projects. It has completed 17 major bridges under BOT and maintenance of \ntwo  roads,  the  Bhopal-Dewas  and  Mhow-Neemuch  roads  under  maintain-operate-transfer \n(MOT)  arrangements.  Construction  of  Mandsaur  and  Shivpur  bypasses  has  been  completed \nunder  BOT  while  bypasses  to  Katni  and  Satna  towns  are  in  progress  under  BOT.  MPG  has \npassed  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Infrastructure  Fund  Board  Act  (MPIFBA)  to  encourage  public-\nprivate  partnership  (PPP)  in  Madhya  Pradesh's  road  sector.  MPG  is  currently  reviewing  the \noperation modalities of BOT and MOT through bond roads and government subsidy schemes to \ndraw  lessons  and  experiences  to  improve  its  second  phase  operation.  Findings  and \nrecommendations  of  the  review  will  be  inputs  for  further  updating  and  improving  of  MPG\u2019s \ninitiatives for promoting private sector participation in its road sector. \n \n27. \nThe  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Bridge  Development  Corporation  (MPSBDC)  is  a  statutory \ncorporation  under  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Minister  of  Public  Works  and  is  responsible  for \nimplementing  road  projects  involving  private  sector  participation,  including  BOT  and  MOT \nprojects, financed through bonds raised in the capital markets with government guarantee and \ngrants  from  PWDGoMP's  capital  investment.  Under    MPIFBA,  approximately  $23  million \nequivalent has been reallocated from PWDGoMP's road maintenance budget to MPSBDC in FY \n2003  to  repay  bonds.  MPSBDC  was  revived  in  2001  following  the  recommendation  of  the \nongoing  ADB  loan  for  public  resource  management.  MPSBDC  has  been  given  the  task  of \nimproving 15 state highways and one national highway through a public-private partnership form \nof  BOT.  MPSBDC  specifies  design  criteria,  detailed  engineering  design,  bill  of  quantities, \napplicable  toll  rates  (Rs0.25/km),  a  concession  period  of  15  years,  and  invites  proposals  from \nprequalified  firms  in  the  private  sector.  These  firms  compete  on  the  amount  of  construction \nsubsidy to be required from MPG. MPSBDC has concluded agreements for 15 contracts.  The \naverage MPG's grant contribution is 48% of the total construction cost. MPSBDC conducts its \noperation  transparently  and  is  a  very  lean  organization,  outsourcing  most  of  the  professional \nexpertise and services to the private sector. \n \n28. \nHowever, the application of this model to other state and major district roads is limited by \ntheir low traffic volumes. The 15 state highway and 1 national highway under this scheme total \nabout 2,200 km and carry, together with the national highways in Madhya Pradesh, about 85% \nof the state\u2019s total traffic. The rest is unlikely attractive to private sector participation. Therefore, \nthe  main  challenge  faced  by  MPG  is  to  improve  substantially  state  road  management  and \noverall  performance  of  PWDGoMP  by  improving  governance  and  building  basic  technical \ncapability  and  institutional  capacity  to  ensure  delivery  of  reliable  road  transport  services  to \nsupport its economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n \n \n29. \nThe  roads  in  India  can  be  grouped  into  four  segments,  i.e.,  key  national  highway  links \nunder  the  jurisdiction  of  the  National  Road  Authority  of  India  (NHAI),  other  national  highway \nlinks  under  the  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways,  state  and  district  roads  under  state \n                                                 \n6   PPTA Consultants\u2019 draft final report for TA No. 3751-IND. \n\nADB Sector Strategy \n\n5. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\nPWDs,  and  rural  roads  under  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development.  Given  the  potential  scale  of \nlending,  ADB  developed  a  holistic  approach  under  the  Western  Transport  Corridor  Project  in \n20017, whereby projects should be developed in a sequential and progressive manner to fulfill \nADB\u2019s long-term policy objectives of enabling efficient and sustainable development of roads to \nmeet  the  needs  of  the  public  for  increased  mobility  and  efficient  freight  movement.  Specific \ninterventions  in  the  road  sector  will  differ  since  each  of  the  four  segments  faces  different \nchallenges. \n \nFollowing the above model, a sector reform plan for reforming and developing the state \n30. \nroad sector in the next 5-10 years has been prepared to achieve the following policy objectives: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nfull transition of state road sector management from the outdated PWD system to \na  more  effective  and  efficient  system,  the  proposed  State  Highway  Authority \n(SHA), with improved governance and accountability; \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building to improve business process and \nenhance effectiveness and efficiency of the state road sector management, \noutsourcing  of  professional  services  to  bring  about  better  private  sector \nparticipation in road development projects and road maintenance; and \nestablishment of a road asset management mechanism and sustainable funding \nof road maintenance. \n\nThe Rationale \n\nADB  operations  in  India  and  coordination  with  other  major  donors  are  discussed  in \n\n \n31. \nAppendix 2.  The proposed SDP is the first state-level ADB intervention in the road sector. \n \nC. \n \n32. \nThe current PWD system in Madhya Pradesh, constrained by the identified institutional \nand  policy  constraints  can  not  perform  responsibly  and  be  accountable  for  effective  sector \nmanagement. It has resulted not only in rapid and dramatic deterioration of state road network \nbut  also  substantial  decrease  in  road  use  because  of  unreliable  road  transport  services,  and \nalmost no transport services to the rural poor. This, in combination with inefficient management \nand  scarce  financial  resources,  has  constrained  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s  social  and  economic \nprogress. Serious overstaffing of PWDGoMP exhausts about 67% of the total annual recurred \nexpenditures,8  or  about  29%  of  the  total  budget,  reducing  the  amount  of  funding  for  road \nmaintenance. This also contributes to substantially reduced incentive of PWDGoMP staff, poor \ngovernance, and an almost nonperforming infrastructure management. \n \n33. \nSector reform is crucial to rectify this situation, and enable MPG to manage state roads \nbetter,  and  ensure  reliable  road  transport  services  to  support  the  state\u2019s  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.    The  reform  will  help  foster  good  governance  in  public  administration  and \naccountability in public resource and asset management for the state road sector. Improving the \nsector  capability  and  capacity  will  enable  a  transparent  and  conducive  environment  for  more \ncompetition,  which  in  turn  will  ensure  better  infrastructure  facilities  and  decrease  in  recurrent \ncosts  for  road  maintenance  over  the  medium-  and  long-term.  The  reform  will  also  initiate \nestablishment of an enabling environment which will encourage more private sector participation \nin  road  projects  by  outsourcing  professional  services  for  road  development  and  maintenance \nprojects  through  competition  and  use  of  performance-based  contracts.  These  together  will \n\n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2001.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the Proposed Loan to India \n\non Western Transport Corridor Project. \n\n8  Non-planned budget is for recurrent expenditures. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe \n\nfurther offset the financial burden of MPG by reducing demand on public sector resources and \nenabling  higher  expenditures  and  capital  investment  on  priority  social  sectors  and  poverty \nreduction.  Besides, \ninvestment  component  will  generate  constructive  employment \nopportunities and benefit other sectors, thereby contributing to poverty reduction. \n \n34. \nThe  main  reform  objective  of  the  SDP  can  be  achieved  in  about  3  years.  Once  this \nobjective is achieved, further interventions will be implemented to achieve the remaining policy \nobjectives, of the sector reform plan to make the SHA an autonomous road agency, sustain the \nasset base through more active private sector participation, and ensure reliable road transport \nservices.  In  support  of  the  reform  objective,  a  project  loan  will  be  provided  to  rehabilitate \ndramatically  deteriorated  state  road  corridors  to  defer  huge  reconstruction  cost  until  Madhya \nPradesh\u2019s economic growth and traffic justify financing major reconstruction projects. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\n \n \nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nThe main objective of the SDP is to enable MPG to establish more effective and efficient \n35. \nmanagement  of  state  roads  and  ensure  reliable  road  transport  services  to  support  Madhya \nPradesh\u2019s  social  and  economic  development,  and  thus  reduce  poverty.  The  objective  is \nexpected  to  be  achieved  by  (i)  instituting  measures  for  good  governance  in  the  administration \nand  management  of  the  sector,  improving  capability  and  building  capacity  for  effective  road \nasset  management,  improving  road  transport  services  and  road  safety,  and  initiating  steps  for \nbetter  private  sector  participation;  and  (ii)  rehabilitating  priority  state  road  corridors  that  have \ndeteriorated significantly. The program and project frameworks are given in Appendix 3. \n \nB. \n\nImportant Features \n\nin  public  administration  and  accountability \n\n36. \nFigure  1  of  Appendix  9  illustrates  the  macroeconomic  linkages  of  the  proposed  sector \nreform.  Reforming  the  state  road  sector  will  enable  MPG  to  manage  more  effectively  manage \nstate roads and ensure reliable road transport services to support Madhya Pradesh\u2019s economic \nand  social  development  through  two  main  channels.  The  first  channel  includes  improving \ngovernance \nin  public  resource  and  asset \nmanagement  for  state  roads.  Improving  the  sector  capability  and  capacity  will  create  a \ntransparent  environment  conducive  for  increased  efficiency  and  competition.  This  in  turn  will \npromote  higher  quality  construction  and  road  maintenance  and  more  sustainable  road \ninfrastructure,  and  decrease  recurrent  costs  of  road  maintenance  over  the  medium  and  long \nterm.  The  second  channel  includes  identifying  sources  of  road  sector  revenue  to  establish  a \nsustainable  road  maintenance  funding  mechanism.  The  sector  reform  will  encourage  private \nsector  participation  in  road  projects,  which  will  offset  the  financial  burden  to  MPG  and  enable \nmore  funding  of  priority  social  sectors  such  as  health  and  education  to  support  poverty \nreduction. Further, the reform will generate employment opportunities in other sectors, thereby \ncontributing indirectly to poverty reduction.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 9\n\nC. \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Program  is  to  enable  MPG  to  establish  a  strong  institutional \n\n37. \nframework for more effective and efficient state road management.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\ninstitutional  authority \n\n38. \nA policy matrix for the Program (Appendix 4) reflects the commitment of the Government \nand  MPG  to  reorganizing  PWDGoMP.  The  Program  builds  on  the  following  policy  themes:  (i) \ngood  governance  in  road  sector  management  and  administration  and  road  sector  resource \nmanagement, (ii) preservation and management of road asset, (iii) capacity building to improve \ninstitutional  effectiveness  and  efficiency,  and  (iv)  establishment  of  a  favorable  regulatory \nframework  for  private  sector  participation.  Improvements  in  good  governance  and  resource \nmanagement will be key intervention focusing on efforts for more transparent and accountable \nbudget  allocation  and  use,  and  generation  of  more  sustainable  sector  revenues  for  state  road \ndevelopment and maintenance. \n \n39. \nThe program will require MPG to undertake a number of policy actions, that are tranche \nrelease  conditions.  MPG  will  (i)  set  up  a  state  highway  zone  (SHZ)  within  PWDGoMP  as  an \ninterim  measure,  with  necessary  staffing  and \nintegrate  key \nresponsibilities and functions for state road management, implement the SDP, and prepare for \ntransforming the SHZ into the SHA; (ii) transform of the SHZ into the SHA as a self-contained \nand  fully  functional  agency  to  take  over  state  highway  management;  (iii)  staff  the  SHA,  at \nheadquarters and regional levels, with the right skills mix to make the SHA a lean and efficient \norganization  responsible  for  road  sector  policy,  resource  management,  development  planning \nand  asset  management  (Supplementary  Appendix  A);  (iv)  implement  modern  planning  and \ndecision-making  tools  and  prepare  five-year  and  annual  road  sector  development  and \nmaintenance plans based on economic and other clearly-defined sector performance criteria; (v) \nfinancial  efficiency, \nimprove \nmanagement  accountability, \nimplement  a  staff \nrationalization  program  as  approved  by  MPG  through  a  labor  rationalization  program  (LRP) \n(Supplementary Appendix B), following the Government\u2019s VRS for government employees and \nstatutory reduction of labor following the Industrial Dispute Act 1947 to free more funds for road \nmaintenance  works;  (vii)  secure  adequate  budget  to  ensure  sustainable  funding  of  road \nmaintenance  in  the  near  term  until  a  road  maintenance  fund  can  be  established  ,  and  (viii) \nintroduce  effective  vehicle  overloading  controls  to  preserve  road  assets  and  road  safety \nprograms to reduce road deaths and injuries. The policy matrix in Appendix 4 gives the detailed \ntime-bound policy actions and reform measures to be undertaken by MPG and major outputs of \nthe Program. \n \n\nto  enhance  operational  and \ntransparency,  and  service  quality;  (vi) \n\ninternal  business  processes \n\nto \n\n3. \n\nAdjustment Costs and Financing Plan \n\nTo implement the reform measures, MPG is expected to incur a total adjustment cost of \n40. \n$80.2 million, including (i) $26 million for staff rationalization, (ii) $7.7 million for establishing and \ncommissioning the SHA, (iii) $40 million for road maintenance for 5 years, from FY 2004\u20132008 \nin addition to the already allocated road maintenance budget of $85 million for the same period, \n(iv) $2 million for the overloading control program, (v) $3 million for a road safety program, (vi) \n$0.5  million  for  a  study  of  road  revenue  and  road  user  charges  for  a  sustainable  funding \nmechanism  of  road  maintenance  financing,  and  (vii)  $1  million  for  statewide  stakeholder \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nconsultation  by  SHZ-SHA  on  the  implementation  of  the  SDP,  road  transport  services,  road \nmaintenance, and socioeconomic impacts of road projects. \n \n41. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  program  loan  of  $30  million  from  ADB's  ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance 37% of the adjustment costs of the SDP. The loan will have a \n15 year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75%  per  annum;  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0%,  (the  front-end  fee  and  commitment  charge  will  be \npaid  by  the  Borrower  from  its  own  resources),  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in \naccordance with terms of the draft program Loan Agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB's \nconversion  guidelines;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Program  Loan \nAgreement.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow \nunder  ADB's  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii) \nstatement that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent decision and not made \nin reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  program  loan  will  be  the  Finance  Department  of  the \n42. \nGovernment  of  Madhya  Pradesh  (FDGoMP).  FDGoMP  will  be  responsible  for  providing \nadequate  counterpart  funds  and  other  resources  required  for  implementing  the  Program, \ncoordinate  and  monitor  implementation  of  the  Program,  and  administer  the  program  loan \nproceeds.  PWDGoMP  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  and  implementing  the  reform \nmeasures on a day-to-day basis as the implementing agency to ensure that all loan conditions \nare met for timely tranche releases. \n \n\nb. \n\nProcurement and Disbursements \n\n43. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  goods  and  services  produced  and  procured  from \nADB  member  countries  other  than  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  (Appendix  5)  in  the \nProgram  Loan  Agreement,  and  imports  to  be  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources. The Borrower will be required to submit with each withdrawal application a certification \nthat  the  value  of  the  country's  total  eligible  imports  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of \nADB's  projected  disbursements  under  the  program  loan  in  a  given  period.  ADB  will  have  the \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Borrower's certification. \n \n\nc. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n44. \nCounterpart funds generated by the program loan will be transferred by the Government \nto MPG and be used by it under arrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support the reform and \nmeet  the  adjustment  costs  associated  with  the  SDP,  as  agreed  upon  by  the  Borrower.  The \ncounterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  from  the \nGovernment  to  MPG  under  normal  arrangements  for  the  transfer  of  external  assistance  in \naddition  to  the  funds  transferred  to  MPG  by  the  Government\u2019s  transfers  allocated  annually  to \nMPG.  The  Government  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  under  the  program  loan  in \naccordance with its policy. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 11\n\nd. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\nThe program loan of $30 million will be released by two tranches. The first tranche has \n\n45. \nbeen designed to achieve the following objectives:  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nestablish  effective  and  transparent  business  processes  to  improve \ngovernance in financial management, public procurement and road sector \nresource management;  \nInitiate institutional reengineering including the implementation of the LRP \nand capacity building for MP\u2019s state road sector; \nImprove road transport services and traffic safety management; and \nInitiate a regulatory framework favorable for private sector participation. \n\n \nThe  release  of  the  first  tranche  of  $12  million  (anticipated  in  December  2002)  is  subject  to \nfulfillment of the first tranche conditions stated in the policy matrix. \n \n46. \n \n\nThe second tranche has been designed to achieve the following objectives: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nestablish  a  reliable  and  sustainable  road  asset  management  system  by \nimproving  the  road  maintenance  system,  and  identifying  sustainable \nfunding sources and a mechanism for funding road maintenance. \nreorganize  PWDGoMP  and  transform  the  SHZ  into  the  SHA  by  March \n2005; and \ncomplete the road safety and overloading control programs.  \nComplete implementation of the LRP. \n\n \nRelease of the second tranche of $18 million (anticipated in June 2005) is subject to fulfillment \nof the second tranche conditions, in particular, and satisfying the other policy measures stated \nin the policy matrix. \n \nD. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n47. \nThe  project  loan  will  rehabilitate  the  priority  state  road  corridors  that  have  deteriorated \ndramatically.    This  will  defer  huge  reconstruction  costs  that  will  result  if  rehabilitation  is  not \nundertaken immediately. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  is  design  to  rehabilitate  about  1,750  km  of  state  highways  and  rural \n48. \nconnector  roads  identified  from  important  state  road  corridors.  It  will  cover  (i)  state  highways \nlinking  with  the  north-south  national  highway  corridor,  important  industrial  centers,  and  major \ndistrict  roads;  (ii)  state  highways  with  relatively  high  traffic  volume  providing  transport  for  the \npredominate  agricultural  production;  (iii)  other  state  highways  in  zones  that  could  enhance \neconomic performance if they had better roads; (iv) connector roads in rural and economically \nbackward  areas,  to  benefit  the  rural  poor;  (v)  equipment  necessary  for  PWDGoMP  to  ensure \nquality control, improve operational efficiency, and emergency relief; and (vi) consulting services \nfor  construction  supervision.  Project  roads  will  be  selected  based  on  (i)  social  and  economic \ndevelopment requirements, (ii) geographical distribution for poverty reduction, (iii) traffic volume, \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nand (iv) environmental requirements and engineering alternatives. Detailed selection criteria are \nin Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nCost estimates and Financing Plan \n\n49. \nThe total project cost in 2002 prices is estimated at $261.2 million equivalent, including \n$180.1  million  of  foreign  exchange  cost  (69%  of  the  total  cost).  The  local  currency  cost, \nincluding taxes and duties, is estimated at $81.1 million equivalent (31 % of the total cost). The \ncost estimate includes contingencies, a front-end fee of 1% of the total project loan amount, a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  interest  during  construction,  and  a  repayment  of \n$350,000 for the portion of the project processing technical assistance (PPTA) fund exceeding \n$250,000. Details are summarized in Appendix 6. \n \n50. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of  $150  million  equivalent  from \nADB's  ordinary  capital  resources  to  finance  81%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the  Project, \nand 2% of total currency cost (57% of the total cost). MPG will finance from its own resources \nthe  remaining  45%  of  the  total  Project  cost  including  taxes,  duties,  the  front  end  fee,  interest \nduring construction, and commitment charges, and other associated costs. The financing plan is \nalso  summarized  in  Appendix  6.  MPG  has  assured  ADB  that  it  will  ensure  timely  provision  of \nadequate counterpart funds for the Project implementation. \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n51. \nPWDGoMP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency    for  the  Project.  Within  PWDGoMP,  the  SHZ \nwill  be  the  Implementing  Agency  during  the  transition  period  until  the  SHA  and  its  regional \noffices are fully functional to be responsible for the day-to-day project implementation. \n  \n\nb. \n\nManagement and Organization \n\n52. \nIn  August  2002,  PWDGoMP  established  a  project  implementing  unit  (PIU)  for  the  SDP \nand appointed a director of the PIU and a director of the SHZ. A Director of the PIU has been \nappointed,  with  one  full-time  engineer,  two  part-time  engineers  and  a  part-time  accountant. \nPWDGoMP  has  agreed  to  fully  staff  the  SHZ  and  the  PIU  along  with  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation,  with  delegated  authority  and  financial  and  other  resources  required  for \nsuccessful implementation of the Project.  \n \n\nc. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nDetailed  engineering  designs  for  phase  I  civil  works  have  been  completed  and \n53. \nprocurement documents are ready for submission to ADB for review and approval by October \n2002 (para. 55). Prequalification is expected to start in November 2002. Tendering is expected \nto start by January 2003. Rehabilitation works are expected to commence in June 2003. Project \nimplementation, including preconstruction activities, is expected to be completed in  five years, \nfrom January 2003 to December 2007(Appendix 7). \n \n\nd. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\n54. \nADB approved advance procurement for phase I civil works and consulting services for \nconstruction  supervision.  All  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts will be procured using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  (ICB)  for  contracts  estimated  to  be  equal  to  or \nabove $1.0 million equivalent. Phase I civil works have been divided into six contract packages \nto  be  tendered  through  ICB.  Packaging  of  the  remaining  works  will  be  finalized  during  Project \nimplementation with ADB\u2019s concurrence prior to bidding process. \n \n55. \nProcurement  of  equipment  includes  that  for  (i)  laboratory  and  material  testing;  (ii)    a \npavement management system; (iii) design computerization; and (iv) operation of the proposed \nSHA,  including  a  financial  accounting  system,  management  information  system  (MIS)  and \ncommunication  system.  The  equipment  to  be  financed  under  the  project  loan  will  be  procured \nusing  ICB  procedures  if  the  estimated  contract  amount  is  equal  to  or  above  $500,000,  or \ninternational  shopping  if  the  amount  is  less  than  $500,000.  The  contract  packaging  for \nequipment supply contracts will be based on technical features of equipment to be required and \ntimed when it is required and will be finalized during project implementation (Appendix 8). \n \n56. \nTerms of reference for construction supervision services are provided in Supplementary \nAppendix C. Construction supervision will be contracted to a team of international consultants in \nassociation with domestic consultants. The international consultants will provide senior resident \nengineers. The domestic consultants will include resident engineers for each contract package \nsupported by technical and administrative personnel. Most of the person-months will be used for \nconstruction  supervision  to  ensure  quality,  and  help  PWDGoMP  certify  works  and  authorize \npayments.    The  remaining  person-month  will  be  for  an  implementation  consultant  to  assist \nPWDGoMP  in  contract  management,  dispute  resolution,  and  other  elements  of  contracting \nprocess,  and  to    train  the  counterpart  staff.  International  consultants  will  also  help  establish  a \nmonitoring and evaluation system, including a household survey and data analysis, and monitor \nthe  implementation  of  social  and  environmental  mitigation  measures  under  the  environmental \nmonitoring  and  management  plan  (EMMP)  of  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE).  To \nsupport  the  monitoring  and  evaluation,  a  domestic  consultant  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the \ninternational  consultants  to  carry  out  household  surveys  and  data  analyses  under  the  project \nperformance management system (PPMS). International consultants financed under the project \nloan  will  be  recruited  through  quality  and  cost-based  selection  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  PWDGoMP  has  agreed  to  incorporate  in  all  invitation \ndocuments  and  contracts  for  consultants  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anti  corruption  policy.  The \ndomestic consultants will be recruited in accordance with procedures satisfactory to ADB. \n \n57. \nUnder  the  consulting  services  for  supervision,  training  will  be  organized  for  staff  of  the \nSHZ  and  the  SHA  on  bridge  maintenance,  pavement  management  system,  quality  control, \nmaintenance  planning  and  depot  management,  and  social  and  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement. The training program and the proposed candidates will be submitted to ADB for \nprior review and approval. \n \n\ne. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n58. \nFor civil works, procurement of equipment, and consulting services contracts, loan funds \nwill  be  disbursed  using  direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures,  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan disbursement Handbook. \n \n\nf. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n59. \nPWDGoMP  will  make  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  reporting  the  progress  of \nproject implementation. PWDGoMP will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports in such form \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nand  detail  as  ADB  may  reasonably  require  on  the  project  implementation.  The  results  of \nmonitoring  the  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  should  be  incorporated  in  the \nquarterly  progress  reports.  PWDGoMP  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  within  six  months  of \ncompletion  of  the  Project  Government\u2019s  project  completion  report  (PCR)  with  detailed \nassessment  and  evaluation  of  the  design;  implementation;  project  costs;  the  performance  of \nPWDGoMP, ADB, consultants, and contractors; attainment of benefits; economic reevaluation; \nsocioeconomic and environmental impacts; and other details that ADB may require. \n \nPWDGoMP  will  maintain  for  the  Project  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \n60. \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources \nreceived, the expenditures incurred for the Project, and use of local funds. The accounts will be \nset  up  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  and  will  be  audited  by  independent \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  accounts  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  9 \nmonths  from  the  end  of  the  previous  fiscal  year.  MPG  and  PWDGoMP  have  been  advised  of \nADB\u2019s requirements for improving the compliance with timely submission of the audited project \naccounts,  and  the  possibility  of  suspending  disbursements  if  there  is  any  delay  in  the \nsubmission. \n \n\ng. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nA set of indicators for estimating project effects in relation to the project goals, purposes, \n61. \noutputs, and conditions is in Supplementary Appendix D. Baseline indicators and target values \nwill  be  established  by  PWDGoMP  at  commencement  of  the  rehabilitation.  Subsequently, \nindicator  values  will  be  observed  during  project  implementation,  at  project  completion,  1  year \nafter project completion, and 5 years after project completion. MPG will recruit an international \nconsultant to help establish the PPMS, and train PWDGoMP staff and implementing agencies \nfor monitoring and evaluation (para. 57). \n \n\nh. \n\nProject Review \n\n62. \nIn addition to ADB\u2019s regular and special reviews of the project implementation, MPG and \nADB will carry out a midterm review by the end of 2004. At that time they will review in detail the \nproject  design  and  implementation  progress  to  identify  critical  areas  for  strengthening  and \nimprovement to ensure smooth implementation and achievement of the project objectives. The \nreview  will  focus  on  specific  measures  agreed  with  PWDGoMP  on  quality  control.  The \nmeasures  include  ADB's  prior  review  and  approval  of  the  detailed  engineering  designs  and \ntender  documents,  bid  evaluations,  and  contracts;  and  project  review  missions  and  progress \nreports  to  review  the  performance  of  supervision  consultants  and  contractors  to  ensure  their \ndiligent performance. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n \nCapacity building for the Madhya Pradesh road sector needs to start from basic levels of \n63. \ndefining  new  structures  and  procedures,  updating  technology  and  skills,  and  improving \nmanagement. \n  \nThe objective of the technical assistance (TA) is to support road sector reform in Madhya \n64. \nPradesh.  Consultants  under  the  TA  will  also  identify  policy  areas  that  need  to  be  improved  in \nline with the overall objectives of the SDP. It will also help MPG build the institutional capacity to \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 15\n\nstrengthen and develop state roads, and strengthen PWDGoMP's abilities in transport planning, \nproject  financing,  investment  management,  and  social  and  environmental  monitoring  by \nintroducing  internationally  recognized  principles  of  engineering;  technical,  financial,  and \neconomic  analysis;  and  social  and  environmental  impact  assessment.  The  TA  will  provide  a \nseries  of  training  programs  through  seminars  and  workshops  to  disseminate  findings  of  and \nrecommendations  on  program  implementation  and  improvement  of  the  state  road  sector \nmanagement. Overseas training programs may also be organized to expose senior government \nofficials  and  key  management  staff  of  PWDGoMP  to  road  sector  management,  alternative \ntechniques  for  financial  and  economic  analysis,  and  resource  mobilization,  especially  in  road \nmaintenance financing. \n \n65. \nThe  TA  will  require  about  84  person-months  of  international  and  domestic  consulting \nservices  with  expertise  in  governance  and  policy,  transport  economics,  road  engineering, \nfinancial  analysis,  project  costing  and  financing,  financial  accounting  and  management,  and \nsocial and environmental management. The TA will provide training in these areas.  In addition, \nthe  TA  will  provide  equipment  necessary  for  TA  implementation.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is \nestimated  at  $1.9  million:  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  will  finance  $1.5  million  and \nMPG  will  finance  the  rest  in  kind  from  its  own  resources.  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  the \nadministration of the TA. The cost estimate and the outline terms of reference for the TA are in \nSupplementary  Appendix  E.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengagement of domestic consultants. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS \n\n1. \n\nExpected benefits \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \n \nA. \n \n \n \n66. \nEconomic  analysis  indicates  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the \nProject  as  a  whole  is  25%,  while  EIRRs  by  road  sections  for  phase  I  project  corridors  range \nfrom  18.7%  to  34.3%.  EIRRs  for  specific  road  types  are  also  higher  than  12%.9    Thus,  the \nProject  is  viable  as  a  whole  and  when  disaggregated  into  individual  lane  configurations. \nSensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  for  six  scenarios  (i)  capital  costs  increasing  by  20%,  (ii) \nbenefits  decreasing  by  20%,  (iii)  capital  costs  increasing  by  20%  and  benefits  decreasing  by \n20%, (iv) time saving not counted, (v) capital costs increasing by 20% and benefits decreasing \nby  20%  and  time  saving  not  counted,  and  (vi)  start  of  construction  delayed  by  1  year.  The \nresults of the sensitivity test for each corridor of the phase I civil works are given in Table 9 of \nthe  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  Under  the  worst  scenario,  (v),  the  EIRR  for  the  Project  as  a \nwhole is 15.6%, while the EIRRs for two corridors go down to 11.6% and 10.4%. However, this \nsituation  is  unlikely  to  happen  because  the  cost  of  rehabilitation  is  controllable  due  to  the \nstraightforward  engineering  measures  and  because  no  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement is involved. The current traffic levels are already the lowest possible. If construction \nstart is delayed by a year, the Project will lose economic benefits slightly because of a moderate \ndrop  in  the  net  present  value  (NPV).    Supplementary  Appendix  F  provides  detailed  economic \nanalysis of the Project. \n \n                                                 \n9   32.1% for single lane roads, 26.3% for intermediate lane roads, and 22.8% for two-lane roads. \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  using  the  Highway  Development  and \n67. \nMaintenance Tools (HDM). The HDM in principle evaluates investments on projects in the form \nof  capital  and  recurrent  costs  against  benefits  derived  from  the  savings  of  road  user  costs  for \nsituations  of  \u201cwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  project.  The  rapidly  deteriorating  road  network,  the  current \ntraffic  volumes,  and  future  traffic  forecast  justify  a  rehabilitation  program  instead  of  upgrading \nand reconstruction. The rehabilitation will enable the road asset base to be preserved and thus \navoid the need to reconstruct the roads in the near future. It will also reduce requirements for \nperiodic  maintenance.  The  improved  road  conditions  are  expected  to  attract  more  traffic  and \neconomically  justify  further  the  improvement.  In  the  economic  analysis,  the  project  life  was \ntaken to be 20 years. \n \n68. \nThe analysis was carried out using generic traffic categories and road condition classes. \nBased on the current traffic mix, the overall traffic growth rate will be 6% per annum in the early \nyears, from the completion of the Phase I rehabilitation works in 2005, to 2012, 5 years after the \ncompletion  of  the  whole  Project.  The  traffic  growth  rate  after  2012  will  fall  to  around  5%  per \nannum. The annual traffic growth is slightly lower than the average national traffic growth rate of \n7%  because  of  the  slower  economic  growth  in  net  state  domestic  products  at  5%  per  annum \ncompared  to  the  6%  of  the  national  average.  Three  rehabilitation  options  were  considered \nbased  on  traffic  level  and  road  condition  categories.  The  main  quantifiable  benefits  of  the \ninvestment are (i) savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) for existing traffic, (ii) VOC savings \nto  generated  traffic,  and  (iii)  time  saving.  A  minor  component  is  the  savings  in  maintenance \ncosts  to  be  incurred  by  PWDGoMP.  The  VOC  savings  are  generated  through  better  road \nsurface  conditions.  As  the  access  to  markets,  which  reflects  agricultural  benefits,  becomes \nbetter, increased economic activities will generate more traffic. \n \n69. \nThe  HDM  will  enable  PWDGoMP  to  plan  and  program  the  state  road  maintenance \nbudget  so  that  resources  are  allocated  according  to  where  they  will  have  the  most  economic \nimpact.  This  will  improve  resource  allocation.  The  labor  rationalization  program  will  reduce \nredundant  staff  and  increase  financial  resources  for  road  maintenance  works.  The  modern \nfinancial  management  systems  and  improved  business  processes  will  increase  use  of \ncompetitive bidding to obtain better prices and outputs in maintenance services.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n70.  Madhya  Pradesh  is  one  of  the  largest  and  most  populated  states  in  India,  and    one  of \nthe poorest.  About 38% of the 77 million people in the state live below the official poverty line, \ncompare to the national poverty incidence of about 35%.   \n \n71. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  poverty  intervention  and  will  directly  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction  by  lowering  the  costs  of  transport  for  the  poor  traveling  to  labor  markets,  farmers\u2019 \nmarkets,  and  health  and  education  centers.  It  will  have  a  large  effect  on  reducing  poverty, \ndirectly benefiting 10 million people in a 30 kilometer zone of influence around the state roads to \nbe improved. Of these, an estimated 5 million poor people will be direct beneficiaries, or about \n50% of the total direct beneficiaries.10 A detailed project beneficiary count and distribution of net \neconomic benefits of the Project are provided in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n72. \nThe  benefits  will  become  evident  in  higher  agricultural  product  profit  margins  for  poor \nfarmers,  and  lower  cost  and  more  timely  access  to  schools,  medical  clinics,  and  employment \n\n                                                 \n10  Consultant  final  report    -  Poverty  Impact  Assessment  for  the  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  under  ADB  TA \n\n3751-IND. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17\n\ncenters.  The  lower  transport  costs  will  increase  mobility  among  the  poor,  especially  poor \nwomen, who will be more easily able to reach social centers and become more politically active, \nthus increasing the empowerment of the poor.  \n \nThe estimates do not include the expected benefits to the poor of improving the tertiary \n73. \nrural  connectivity  roads,  which  is  a  project  component.  These  additional  benefits  will  likely  be \nsubstantial,  because  they  link  poor  farmers  and  their  villages  with  the  state  roads,  which  are \ncurrently impassable during monsoon season. The rural connector roads to be included in the \nProject will be selected based primarily on poverty reduction criteria.   \n \n74. \nThe surveys reveal that 90% of the poor in the zone of influence use the Project roads, \nand  that  33%  of  passengers  on  motorized  vehicles,  are  poor.  The  surveys  and  focus  groups \nshow that the degree of competition in the transport services market, including passenger and \nfreight services, varies depending on the condition of roads. On roads in better condition, there \nis  more  competition,  while  on  roads  in  very  worn  condition,  traffic  is  low  and  competition  is \nweak. This suggests competition will become much stronger as the roads are improved during \nthe Project. With such heavy use of the roads by the poor, and competition hindered by weak \nroad  conditions,  the  Project  will  catalyze  competition  and  greater  service  frequency,  thus \nreducing passenger fares and freight rates and leading to even greater use of the Project roads \nby  the  poor.  These  findings  underpin  the  estimates  of  the  Project\u2019s  estimated  effects  on  the \npoor.    Appendix  9  provides  a  summary  of  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Development \nStrategy \n \nSocial and Environment Impacts \n\nB. \n\n1. \n\nSocial Issues \n\n \n75. \nThe  reform  is  expected  to  involve  reduction  of  approximately  7,800  permanent  and \n8,000  non-permanent  employees.  Among  the  permanent  employees,  about  26%  (2,000 \nemployees) would normally retire or leave within a 5 year period. A detailed workforce analysis \nand  number  of  staff  to  be  affected  by  the  reform  is  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  To \nensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Framework, MPG has adopted a social safety \nnet  program  to  provide  job  counseling,  information  services,  and  training.  The  counseling  on \nother employment opportunities, and for safe and attractive investment of funds provided under \nthe  labor  rationalization  program    for  PWDGoMP,  will  be  provided  to  all  affected  employees \nregardless  of  their  employment  status.  Training  programs  will  mainly  target  the  nonpermanent \nemployees. \n\nthe  Project.  ADB  reviewed \n\n \n76. \nConsultants  under  a  World-Bank-financed  TA  loan  carried  out  an  initial  social \nassessment (ISA) for a road sector investment program in Madhya Pradesh.11  The ISA covered \nfindings  and \nthe  scope  of \nrecommendations  through  community  consultations  and  further  social  assessment,  which \nindicated  unanimous  support  for  road  improvement.  Poor  road  conditions,  resultant  traffic \naccidents,  and  road  congestion  particularly  in  urban  locations  are  key  reasons  for  public \nenthusiasm  for  improvement  of  the  road  network.  In  addition,  small  businesses  by  the  roads \noffer  a  valuable  source  of  income.  The  improvement  of  the  corridor  from  Susner  to  Kilchipur, \nconnecting to the new bridge presently under construction, is expected to reduce travel distance \nby 128 km in western Madhya Pradesh. \n \n\nISA  and  confirmed \n\nthe \n\nits \n\n                                                 \n11  The TA loan did not result in an investment loan as envisaged. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nBased  on  community  consultations  and  the  social  assessment,  detailed  engineering \n77. \ndesign  of  selected  state  highways  will  incorporate  improvements  to  shoulders  to  enable  safe \nroad access for pedestrians and slow moving traffic, bus stops with seating, wayside amenities, \nand truck stops to minimize road congestion. Such amenities will be included to the extent that \nthey do  not entail  land acquisition  and resettlement. The design will include information signs, \nand speed break near schools, hospitals, and congested areas. The social and poverty impact \nassessment has provided the basis for integrating social concerns and is part of the criteria for \nselecting the road sections (Appendix 8 and Supplementary Appendix G). \n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement \n\n \n78. \nThe selection criteria and technical design have recommended road improvements that \nwill  not  entail  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.    No  encroachments  or  other \nstructures will be dismantled. MPG and PWDGoMP have ensured ADB that, prior to the award \nof  civil  works  contracts,  each  road  package  will  be  screened  to  exclude  such  involuntary \nresettlement  effects.  MPG  and  PWDGoMP  will  monitor  compliance  with  this  condition  fully \nduring  project implementation.  \n \n\n3.  Indigenous People \n\n \nAbout  20%  of  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s  population  are  \u201cscheduled  tribes  and  scheduled \n79. \ncastes\u201d.12  As the Project is confined to existing roads, such groups within the project area will \nnot be affected or disadvantaged by the Project. The improved road network will improve their \naccess  to  services  and  economic  opportunities  as  well  as  for  all  segments  of  the  state \npopulation.  \n\n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  a  B  project.  The  IEE  has  verified  that  the  limited \n80. \nenvironmental impacts during construction and operation can be mitigated by implementing the \nenvironmental  management  action  plan  as  recommended  by  the  IEE.  No  environmentally \nsensitive areas will be disrupted by the Project. (SIEE is in Supplementary Appendix H) \n \n81. \nThe IEE shows that environmental impacts associated with the Project are manageable \nand can be mitigated. Therefore, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is not required.  \n \nAlthough, no national park, natural reserve, or forest sanctuaries are within the Project \n82. \narea,  some  wild  animals  have  been  reported  in  the  Project  area.  Therefore,  a  rapid  wildlife \nmovement  study  has  been  undertaken  in  the  Project  area  connecting  Sagar  and  Bina.  The \nfindings show that the Project will not affect the movement and habitat of the wildlife identified. \nThe  study  recommended  fencing  and  underpasses  to  protect  wildlife  movement  and  ensure \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines \nthe \nGovernment/MPG policies and regulations.  \n  \nTo  support  the  sector  development  initiative,  a  social  and  environmental  management \n83. \nunit will be established within the SHZ\u2019s PIU for the SDP, following example of the Environment \n                                                 \n12  \u201cScheduled  Tribe\u201d  is  one  of  the  weaker  sections  of  Indian  population.    Article  342  of  India  Fundamental  Rights \nwhich are enshrined in the Constitution that \u201cScheduled Tribe\u201d is defined as specific tribes or tribal communities or \nparts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities. \"Scheduled Caste\u201d is defined as the lowest caste in the Hindu \ncaste system. \n\nfor  environmental  protection  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 19\n\nand  Social  Development  Unit  within  the  National  Highway  Authority  of  India.  The  unit  will  be \nresponsible  for  environmental  management,  including  monitoring  the  implementation  of \nmeasures to mitigate social and environmental impacts and capacity building in undertaking the \nresponsibilities for the SHZ and the SHA. \n \nC. \n\nProject Risks and Safeguards \n\n84. \nRisks  to  the  sector  reform  relate  to  MPG\u2019s  policy  commitment  and  abilities  in  making \npolicy changes and mitigating adverse impacts. This can be mitigated by MPG\u2019s strong reform \ninitiatives to resolve labor issues and to reengineer PWDGoMP.  Such commitments has been \npartly evident in the implementation of the VRS for the public sector enterprises, and the closure \nof some of them.  However, the road sector reform is the first time when government employees \nwill be offered a VRS. Additionally, ADB will continue policy dialogue with MPG to ensure that \nreform  objectives  are  well  understood  and  implementation  arrangements  are  well  in  place. \nMeanwhile,  the  tranching  and  monitoring  of  the  compliance  with  tranche  release  conditions \nhave  incorporated  time-bound  reform  action  plans  and  measures  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation  of  the  reform.  The  TA  associated  to  the  SDP  will  strengthen  PWDGoMP\u2019s \nimplementation capacity and assist PWDGoMP in implementing the reform. \n \n85. \nRisks  for  investment  are  limited  to  quality  control  due  to  PWDGoMP\u2019s  limited \nimplementation capacity for effective contract management and supervision of works. This can, \nhowever, be mitigated by consulting services for construction supervision and capacity building \nprograms  for  PWDGoMP  on  contract  management  and  quality  control.  Contracts  have  been \ndivided  into  relatively  large  packages  to  attract  international  and  large  qualified  domestic \ncontractors,  to  ensure  good  performance  and  high  quality  construction.  Lessons  learned  from \nsimilar  projects  showed  that  concerns  are  rising  on  quality  control  and  performance  of \nconsultants  and  contractors  during  project  implementation.  These  will  be  addressed  by \ndiscussing improving potential problems before project implementation starts so PWDGoMP is \nready to handle them should they occur, ensuring ADB's prior review and approval of scope of \nworks,  technical  specifications,  and  tender  documents.  MPG  has  agreed  with  ADB  to  have \nintensive reviews of implementation,  consultants, and contractors. The project selection criteria \nand technical design recommended road improvements that will not entail land acquisition and \ninvoluntary  resettlement.    Project  impacts  on  the  environment  will  be  limited  and  can  be \nmitigated (para. 80 to 83). \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n86. \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the Loan Agreements. \n\n \n(i) \n\nGeneral:    The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  policy  actions  described  in  the \nDevelopment  Policy  Letter  and  Policy  Matrix  (Appendix  4)  prior  to  the  date  of \nloan  effectiveness,  will  continue  to  be  in  effect  for  at  least  the  duration  of  the \nSDP. \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\nSector Reform: \n\n \n(iii) \n \n\nEnvironment: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\nMPG  will  ensure  that  the  responsibility  and  authority  for  state  highway \nmanagement are effectively integrated and vested in the SHZ to be later \ntransferred to the SHA to be established by MPG. \nMPG will have PWDGoMP ensure that the capacity building and training \nprograms for PWDGoMP staff and evaluation of the programs are carried \nout  diligently  to  the  satisfaction  of  MPG  and  ADB,  and  necessary \nmeasures are adopted to ensure that trainees will remain in service for at \nleast 2 years after the completion of the training. \n\nPWDGoMP  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  carried  out,  and  all  project \nfacilities are designed, constructed, operated, maintained, and monitored \nin compliance with the existing environmental laws and regulations of the \nBorrower  and  the  State,  and  the  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment \nrequirements  (1998)  and  the  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected \nInfrastructure Projects (1993). \nPWDGoMP  will  ensure  that  all  environmental  mitigation  measures \nidentified  in  the  summary  IEE,  IEE,  and  Environmental  Monitoring  and \nManagement Plan (EMMP) are incorporated in the project design and are \nfollowed  through  during  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the \nProject roads with the consultation with the stakeholders. \nLocal  communities  are  duly  consulted  during  the  Project  Implementation \nperiod on such measures. \nPWDGoMP  will  conduct  training  on  environmental  management  for  its \nstaff and contractors under the Project. \nMPG  and  PWDGoMP  will  ensure  that  the  social  and  environment \nmanagement  unit  within  the  SHZ  and  later  the  SHA  is  established  and \nresponsible  for  environmental  management,  including  monitoring  the \nimplementation of the EMMP. \nBefore  any  works  are  done  on  roads  that  pass  by  or  through  wildlife \nhabitat, an IEE that includes an assessment of wildlife movement should \nbe completed \nNo construction work can be undertaken on any project roads before the \nno-objection  clearance  has  been  obtained  from  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s \npollution  control  board,  forest  department  and  environmental  protection \ndepartment. \nCivil  works  contractors  will  provide  appropriate  traffic  signs,  fencing  and \nunderpasses, where required. \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nSocial  Measures:  MPG  will  have  PWDGoMP  ensure  that  technical  design  for \nthe road rehabilitation works under the Project does not require land acquisition, \nand that prior to award of civil works contracts, each road rehabilitation package \nwill  be  screened \ninvoluntary  resettlement  effects.  MPG  and \nto  exclude \nPWDGoMP will monitor compliance with this condition. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 21\n\n \nLabor Rationalization of PWDGoMP: \n\n(v) \n\n \nOthers: \n\n(vi) \n\na. \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\nd. \n\nlabor \n\nMPG  will  ensure  that  PWDGoMP  develops  and  implements  a  public \nawareness campaign and consultative process on labor rationalization to \ninform  the  stakeholders  on  the  voluntary  retirement  scheme  and  other \nbenefits offered under the LRP.  \nPrior  to  the  implementation  of  the  LRP,  PWDGoMP  establishes  a \nthe \nconsultative  working  committee  on \nimplementation  of  the  LRP  comprising  representatives  from  FDGoMP, \nPWDGoMP  and  Labor  Department  of  the  Government  of  Madhya \nPradesh  (LDGOMP)  in  accordance  with  each  Department\u2019s  mandate  as \nstipulated in the Government\u2019s Rules of Business.  \nPWDGoMP develops and implements the LRP with full participation of all \nthe  stakeholders, \nrelevant \ninformation and seeking feedback on the LRP from its employees. \nPursuant  to  its  Social  Safety  Net  Program,  the  State  provides  job \ncounseling  and  training  to  the  employees  affected  from  the  LRP,  and \nmakes  available \ninvestment \nopportunities for the funds provided to such employees under the LRP. \n\ninformation  on  safe  and  attractive \n\nincluding  effectively  disseminating \n\nrelated \n\nissues \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n(a)  Health  Risks:  MPG  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  employed  under \nthe Project are required to undertake an information and education campaign \non sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS13 for construction workers as \npart of the health and safety program at campsites during construction. \n\n \n(b)  Labor  Laws:  MPG  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws,  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and \nmaintenance  activities,  and  provide  appropriate  child-care  facilities  in \nconstruction campsites.  MPG will set employment targets for women for road \nconstruction  activities,  and  require  contractors  not  to  differentiate  wages \nbetween men and women for work of equal value.  A specific clause will be \nincluded  in  bidding  documents,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored \nduring project implementation. \n\n \n \n\n(c)  Monitoring:  MPG  will  have  Madhya  Pradesh  Department  of  Finance, \nMadhya  Pradesh  Department  of  Labor,  and  PWDGoMP  ensure  that  (i) \nadequate  staff  and  resources  are  committed  to  internal  monitoring  of  the \nimplementation  of  LRP  and  appropriate  measures, \ninternal \nmonitoring reviews, will be undertaken during LRP implementation; and (ii) an \nindependent  domestic  monitoring  agency  is  selected,  in  accordance  with \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  monitor,  evaluate,  and  regularly  review \nLRP implementation. \n\nincluding \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n13   human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n \n87. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $30,000,000  to  India  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Roads  Sector \nDevelopment Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  loan  facility;  a  term  of  15 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years, and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \n(Program) and Program Agreements presented to the Board; \n\nthe  loan  of  $150,000,000  to  India  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Roads  Sector \nDevelopment Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  loan  facility;  a  term  of  20 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan (Project) \nand Project Agreements presented to the Board; and  \n\nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent \nof  $1,500,000  to  the  Government  of  India  for  Institutional  Strengthening  and \nCapacity Building for Madhya Pradesh State Road Sector, to be provided by the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom on a grant basis. \n\n \n \n \n \n12 November 2002 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \n    President  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n \n \n1. \nThis sector analysis supplements the analysis in the main text and focuses on analysis \nof  the  current  road  maintenance  system.  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s  road  network  is  substantially \ndeteriorated  due  to  the  lack  of  funding  for  maintenance  and  poor  management  in  the  past \ndecade. Of a total 38,000 kilometers (km) of state and major district roads, 25% is in very poor \ncondition and only 10% in fair condition; the remaining 65% is in poor condition.  This is mainly \nattributable to three factors: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLack  of  funding  for  road  maintenance  and  lack  of  effective  overloading  control \nhave resulted in severe damage of most of the road network and part of the rural \nroads.  \nThe  road  maintenance  equipment  is  inadequate  and  obsolete,  and  Madhya \nPradesh  Government  (MPG)  can  not  finance  restoring  the  equipment  to  meet \nminimum requirements for road maintenance.  \nthe  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh \nThe  Public  Works  Department  of \n(PWDGoMP)  has  very  limited  expertise  and  technical  staff  qualified  for  road \nmaintenance.  \n\n \nExcept  on  the  high-traffic  state  road  sections  of  about  2,000  km,  contracted  through \n2. \nbuild-operate-transfer(BOT)  to  the  private  sector  for  rehabilitation,  no  periodic  maintenance  or \nmajor  repairs  have  been  carried  out  on  Madhya  Pradesh  roads  in  the  past  decade.  Routine \nmaintenance  has  been  carried  out  by  labor  without  any  technical  capacity  or  required  skills. \nPWDGoMP has a very poor maintenance planning and management system.  \n \nA. \n\nExisting Road Maintenance Activities \n\nThe  maintenance  system  based  on  the  standard  Public  Works  Department  (PWD) \n3. \nmanual was produced almost a century ago and modified from time to time. The manual lacks \ninstructions  for  financial  authority  and  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  indicators,  but \nprovides  guidelines  on  duties,  working  procedures  and  administration  procedures.  The  PWD \nmanual  specifies    (i)  establishment  of  the  department,  (ii)  works  to  be  carried  out,  (iii)  special \nrules for irrigation and navigation, and (iv) work accounts.  The manual defines the operations of \nthe  PWD  as  (i)  original  works,  new  works,  alterations,  additions;  and  (ii)  repairs  and \nmaintenance. \n \nB. \n\nOrganizational Arrangement for Road Maintenance \n\n4. \nThe  following  positions  form  a  management  tree  with  key  responsibilities  for  road \ndevelopment  and  maintenance.  They  cover  decisions  on  planning,  budget  preparation  and \nallocation,  assignment  of  tasks,  implementation  arrangements,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of \nperformance.  It comprises (i) principal secretary, (ii) secretary, (iii) engineer-in-chief, (iv) chief \nengineers  for  zones,  (v)  superintendent  engineers,  (vi)  executive  engineers,  (vii)  subdivisional \nengineers, and (viii) subengineer (technical assistants).  \n \n \n5. \nspecific road maintenance activities. \n \n\nDetailed  responsibilities  of  the  positions  are  provided  in  the  following  sections  with \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nC. \n\nWorking Procedures \n\n6. \nwith its own funds can commence: \n \n\nThree  steps  are  required  before  any  work  other  than  repair  can  be  executed  by  PWD \n\nadministrative approval (concurrence from the competent authority), \ntechnical  sanction  (sanction  based  on  detailed  estimates  by  competent \nauthority), and \nappropriation  and  reappropriation  of  funds  (allotment  or  rejection  of  funding \nrequirement). \n\nThe two types of maintenance activities are: \n\nroutine maintenance, which is performed by casual labor with minimum technical \nguidance  and  little  supervision,  and  has  no  clear  budget  allocation  except  for \nsalary for labor and materials; and \nperiodic  maintenance, which is carried out either on schedule or in response to \nneeds.  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n7. \n \n\n \nD. \n\nRoutine Maintenance Activities \n\n8. \nRoutine  maintenance  activities  are  normally  carried  out  by  the  labor.  Because  of  the \npoor governance and lack of transparency in the labor and financial management, the system \nno longer works. The labor crews have not been provided with appropriate tools and equipment \ndue to the scarcity of funds, or the tools provided are obsolete. \n \n9. \nThe  distance  covered  by  the  crews  is  more  than  they  can  handle  with  the  equipment \nprovided. The crews normally walk or bicycle to their work. All works under routine maintenance \nare arranged through direct engagement of local contractors who in turn hire the labor. Materials \nfor  the  routine  maintenance  are  provided  by  the  PWD,  or  locally  procured  by  the  PWD  local \nbranch offices. \n \nRoutine  maintenance  normally  includes  patching;  crack  sealing;  cleaning  of  ditches; \n10. \ndressing of slopes; trimming of tree branches; and white washing of safety posts, parapets, and \nhill cut slopes. \n \nE. \n\nPeriodic Maintenance \n\n11. \nFor  periodic  maintenance,  officers  in  charge  of  particular  sections  prepare  their \nproposals based on their inspections, which mostly visual without appropriate testing. They then \nprepare  assessment  reports  and  detailed  itemized  estimates  of  materials  needed.  Normally, \ndrawings are prepared manually for supplementary reference to the detailed estimates. \n \n12. \nThe estimates are mainly prepared for periodic maintenance activities scheduled over 6\u2013\n8 years. In most of the cases, the type of treatment is predetermined without any substantiating \ninvestigations on actual road conditions and performance indicators. \n \n13. \nTo  carry  out  periodic  maintenance  activities  generally  known  as  \u201crenewals,\u201d  PWD  has \ntrucks,  bitumen  boilers,  static  rollers  and  drum  mix  plants.  However,  due  to  the  ineffective \nrecovery of capitals, maintenance, and operational cost, the equipment has not been fully used \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n25 \n\nor maintained, and has become obsolete. No budget allocations have been made to operate or \nrefurbish the equipment. \n \n14. \nRates  for  manual  and  mechanized  works  normally  used  are  published  by  PWD.  The \nrates  are  estimates  based  on  approved  sources  of  material  and  established  average  lead \ndistances to the nearest sources. \n  \nF. \n\nBusiness Process for Periodic Maintenance \n\n15. \nThe  business  process  for  periodic  maintenance  is  initiated  at  the  section  level  by \ncollecting data on road conditions and updating the maintenance activity chart based on the last \nperiodic  maintenance.  The  estimates  are  then  forwarded  to  subdivisional  officers  for  scrutiny \nand  verification,  then  to  the  divisional  officer/executive  engineer.  The  engineer  compiles  the \ndata  at  the  divisional  level,  with  details  of  the  previous  year\u2019s  allocation  to  the  sections \nconcerned. \n \nThe zonal level details are further compiled from each division by the chief engineer. The \n16. \nchief  engineer  prepares  a  summary  estimate  detailing  the  total  number  of  kilometers  to  be \nmaintained, and number of structures to be repaired or replaced. These details are forwarded to \nthe  engineer-in-chief.  The  engineer-in-chief  compiles  the  data  with  the  assistance  of  the  chief \nengineer  (planning)  and  issues  job  orders  for  periodic  maintenance.  There  is  no  database  on \nany of the road sections for either long term or short term planning use at PWD headquarters. \n \n17. \nAs  part  of  preparing  estimates  for  periodic  maintenance,  and  to  rationalize  the \nmaintenance  program,  the  PWD  manual  specifies  the  following  data  collection  frequencies:  (i) \ntraffic count-twice a year, (ii) road condition-once a year, and (iii) condition of structure\u2014once a \nyear.  However, these are not being implemented due to lack of funding and expertise. \n \nG. \n\nBudget Approval \n\n18. \nThe estimates prepared by the engineer-in-chief are proposed to the principal secretary \nalong  with  other  requirements  for  budget  approval.  However,  funds  allocated  are  barely \nsufficient to meet even 50% of the proposals. Based on the approved budget, the engineer-in-\nchief consults with the zonal chief engineers and chief engineer (planning) about distributing the \nfunds. The PWD criteria for distributing funds are highlighted in the following: \n  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nreview of bar charts for the last 5 years on periodic renewal, \ncondition of the road and severity of the distress and the effect on delaying the \nplanned activity, \nintervention criteria based on road condition and the available grant, \nimplementation arrangements, and \nidentification of eligible contractors. \n\n \n19. \nContractors are registered according to their financial capability and equipment capacity. \nThe registrations are renewed or cancelled based on contractors\u2019 performance. The registration \nand classification of contractors have been revised following the provisions in the PWD manual. \nThe revised thresholds for the registration of contractor by class and person delegated authority \nto register these contractors are given in Table A. \n \n\n\fTABLE A: \n\nREGISTRATION THRESHOLDS \n\nfor \n\nAuthorized  Contact  Person \nContractor\u2019s Registration \n \nChief Engineer \nChief Engineer \nEngineer in Chief \nEngineer in Chief \nEngineer in Chief \n\n26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nClass \n\nFinancial Capability \n\n \nRs 1 Million \nRs 5 Million \nRs 10 Million \nRs 40 Million \nUnlimited \n\n \nA-I \nA-II \nA-III \nA-IV \n \nSource:  PPTA final report and loan processing missions. \n \n \n20. \nexecutive engineers. \n \nH. \n\nTendering \n\nAs  part  of  the  registration,  contractors  need  to  supply  the  certificates  certified  by  the \n\n21. \nPeriodic  maintenance  works  are  tendered  to  shortlisted  contractors  based  on  sealed \ntenders  invited  in  an  open  and  public  manner  by  advertising  in  local  or  national  newspapers. \nThe  criteria  for  advertising  are  (i)  up  to  Rs500,000  in  regional  or  local  newspapers  in  regional \nlanguage; (ii) Rs500,000 to Rs2,000,000 published at the district level in two newspapers and at \nthe  state  level  in  the  regional  language;  and  (iii)  above  Rs2,000,000,    published  in  English \nlanguage newspapers and two regional newspapers.  \n \nI. \n\nBid Evaluation \n\n22. \nBids are evaluated based on the guidelines provided in the PWD manual. The guidelines \nhave been updated recently, but have yet to be implemented. For bid evaluation, a committee is \nformed including staff from PWD and MPG. This is a recent development and the functions of \nthe committee are yet to be tested. \n \nBids are invited as open tenders from qualified and registered contractors. Based on the \n23. \nfinancial  proposals  and  bid  evaluation  guidelines  specified  in  the  PWD  manual,  the  PWD  is \nconsidering adopting bid evaluation procedures and applications for national highways projects. \nThe evaluated bids based on the financial quotes are negotiated for the award of bids. \n \nJ. \n\nQuality Control  \n\n24. \nCombined  teams  of  the  PWD  and  the  contractor\u2019s  representatives  normally  carry  out \nquality control. For small works, this mechanism is not practical. In most of the cases, this is not \nimplemented, resulting in no supervision and quality control. \n \nK. \n\nMonitoring System for the Performance of Contractor\u2019s \n\n25. \nContractors  that  perform  poorly  are  not  allowed  to  bid  for  future  contracts.  New \nguidelines  are  yet  to  be  implemented  with  special  conditions  to  address  nonperforming \ncontractors  or  irregularities  in  their  execution  of  contracts.  Payments  are  usually  late  due  to \nfunding constraints, and are made on a monthly basis. Contractors can not claim extra payment \nfor the delay or chose the mode of compensation. The superintending engineers arbitrate claims \nfor PWD. \n\n\f \n\n \nL. \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n27 \n\nRecording and Measurement \n\n26. \nSubengineers  record  measurements  to  be  agreed  by  contractors.  Subdivisional \nengineers  check  the  measurements.  The  agreed  and  verified  measurements  are  entered  into \nthe  measurement  book.  The  measurements  are  verified  by  divisional  accountants,  who \nrepresent  the  Madhya  Pradesh  accountant  general,  before  forwarding  them  to  the  executive \nengineers (payment officers) for final check and payment. The executive engineers check 10% \nof  the  total  payments  made.  The  measurement  books  are  not  used  in  current  projects  under \nAsian  Development  Bank  and  the  World  Bank  assistance  due  to  difficulties  in  reproducing  or \nretrieving the data from the books. \n \nThe current road maintenance system needs major reform and restructuring. The current \n27. \nguidelines need to be substantially revised and updated following international norms, and other \nmore effective models in India, such as that implemented by the National Highway Authority of \nIndia.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n\n1. \nInvestment  in  road  transport  at  present  and  for  the  next  decade  is  a  priority  for  India \nbecause  (i)  continued  economic  growth  is  essential  for  India\u2019s  efforts  to  fight  poverty;  (ii)  road \ntransport  infrastructure  can  deliver  major  benefits  to  the  poor,  both  directly  and  indirectly;  and \n(iii) the deficient road transport system is a key constraint for growth in India. \n \nThe  Government  of  India  has  recognized  this  key  constraint  and  has  placed  road \n2. \ntransport  as  one  of  the  major  priorities  in  its  current  investment  program.  In  addition  to \nmobilizing  its  own  resources  through  a  central  road  fund,  the  Government  has  sought  a  large \namount of financial and technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nthe World Bank, of about $2 billion per annum in the medium term. \n \n3. \nTo deliver the large program to India in an efficient manner given the limited resources \nfaced by both organizations, ADB and the World Bank have developed a coordinated strategy \nfor  the  road  sector  in  India.  Advantages  of  the  coordinated  strategy  include  (i)  consistency  in \npolicy advice, (ii) cost effectiveness and avoidance of duplication of effort, (iii) greater focus on \nresults through use of a common performance monitoring system, and (iv) operational synergy \nand complementary with each other in terms of sector knowledge and staff skill mix. \n \n4. \nFor the state road sector, a two-pronged strategy is being pursued. ADB and the World \nBank have separate focal states, and selectively support a number of nonfocus states that have \ngiven assurances that (i) the support will not be wasted due to corruption or poor governance, \nand (ii) that have an unusually high development or demonstration impact for a particular project \nbecause of its innovative nature, or  the issue of the reform being promoted is important. \n \n5. \nConsistent  with  state  governments\u2019  investment  priority  for  state  roads,  ADB  and  the \nWorld Bank focused on capacity expansion of high traffic and high priority state road corridors \nand rehabilitation of high priority state roads to reduce the maintenance backlog. \n \n6. \noperations in the focal states. \n \n\nTable  A9.1  shows  the  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  coordinated  policy  agenda  for \n\nTable A9.1:  Coordinated Development Matrix for State Roads \n\nGeneral Approach \n\n\u2022  During project preparation, \nundertake an institutional \ndevelopment study of the \nstate Public Works \nDepartment and formulate \ninstitutional development \naction plans.

The  World  Bank  and  the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) are also involved in the road sector. The World \nBank  has  provided  financing  for  9  projects  amounting  to  about  $1.9  million  to  construct  and \nrehabilitate  rural  roads,  improve  state  highways,  and  widen  national  highways  to  four  lanes. \nJBIC has provided 5 loans amounting to $263 million equivalent to upgrade national highways 2 \nand  5  to  four  lanes,  and  to  construct  a  bridge  across  the  Jamuna  River  at  Allahabad-Naini. \nADB\u2019s assistance to the road sector is well coordinated with that of the World Bank and JBIC \nthrough regular consultations. A coordinated assistance strategy for the road sector in India is \nbeing prepared in consultation with the Government, World Bank, and other financing agencies.  \n \n8. \nADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  is  to  reduce  road  infrastructure  bottlenecks  on  the  key  transport \ncorridors  to  support  India\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  higher  sustainable  economic  growth.  ADB\u2019s \napproach is to promote efficiency in the delivery and maintenance of road infrastructure through \nappropriate  policy  measures  and  maximizing,  where  feasible,  private  participation.  Within  this \nstrategy, ADB\u2019s involvement in the road sector will focus on projects that have significant direct \nand  indirect  impacts  on  poverty  reduction,  facilitate  subregional  economic  cooperation,  and \npromote private sector development. Under the overall thrust of the focal state approach, ADB\u2019s \nstrategy for the state road sector focuses on reorganizing the outdated public works department \nsystem to improve its responsibility and accountability in sector management through instituting \ngood  governance  measures,  modern  managerial  capabilities,  and  capacity  for  more  effective \nand efficient sector management and operation, thereby ensuring more efficient use of limited \nfinancial  resources  to  free  more  expenditures  and  capital  for  priority  social  sectors  for  poverty \nreduction. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nTable A9.2:  External Assistance to Road Sector \n \n \n\nA. \n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK \n\nTA No. \n\nTechnical Assistance Project Name \n\nType \n\nAmount \n\n \nRoad Improvement \nPavement Management  \nExpressway System Planning \nSecond Road \nVadodara-Bombay Expressway \nPavement Management for National Hihgways \nPrivate Sector Participation in Expressway \nFinancing, Construction and Operation \nRoad Construction Industry \nVadodara-Bombay Expressway (Supplementary) \nThird Road \nFaridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad Expressway \nBombay-Vadodara Expressway TA Project \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment \nRoad Safety \nEnvironmental Management of Road Projects \nTechnical Standards of Highway Concrete Structures \n\n \n0955 \n1058 \n1059 \n1164 \n1325 \n1402 \n1403 \n \n1404 \n1325 \n1678 \n1942 \n1951 \n \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2986  Western Transport Corridor-Facilitating Private Participation \nNorth-South Corridor Development in West Bengal \n3142 \nPreliminary Engineering for the WP Corridor Development \n3538 \nResettlement and Environmental Assessment for the WB \n3539 \nCorridor Development \n \nCapacity Building for Contract Supervision and  \n3361 \nManagement in the National Highways \n \nCapacity Building for Social Development \n3365 \nEconomic and Poverty Analysis for the WB corridor  \n3540 \nDevelopment \n \n\n3751  Madhya Pradesh State Roads \n3752 \n \n\nNational Highway Corridor & Public-Private  \nPartnership \n\n \nOrdinary Capital Resources Project \n\n3845  Madhya Pradesh State Roads Engineering Design \nLoan \nNo. \n \n0918 \n1041 \n1274 \n1747 \n \n\n \nRoad Improvement \nSecond Road \nNational Highways \nSurat-manor Tollway Project \n \n\nB.

It is also one \nof the poorest in the country. About 38%  of the 77 million people in Madhya Pradesh live below \nthe official poverty line,  compared to about 35%  of the population living below the poverty line \nfor India as a whole. \n \n2. \nThe  Program  is  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention  and  will  directly  reduce  poverty  by \nlowering  the  costs  of  transport  for  the  poor  traveling  to  labor  markets,  farmers\u2019  markets,  and \nhealth and education centers.  The Program will have a large effect on reducing poverty, directly \nbenefiting  10  million  people  in  a  30  kilometer  zone  of  influence  around  the  state  roads  to  be \nimproved.    Of  these,  an  estimated  5  million  poor  people  will  be  direct  beneficiaries,  or  about \n50% of the total direct beneficiaries.  \n The estimated distribution analysis draws the selected road section and reflects that the \n3. \npoor  and  very  poor  are  heavy  users  of  motorized  transit  on  the  project  roads  and  that  as  the \nroads  are  improved,  competition  in  passenger  and  freight  transport  markets  will  become \nstronger. Resultant lower transport costs will substantially be passed on to poor and very poor \npassenger and freight shippers. \n \n4. \nFor the baseline forecast, the estimated share of benefits accruing to poor and very poor \npassengers is the same as that in paragraph 3. For the net benefits accruing to freight shippers, \nthe fieldwork supports estimates that 60% of the net benefits will accrue to the poor and 50% to \nthe very poor,  who are included in the poor grouping. \n \n5. \nThese  benefits  will  become  evident  in  higher  agricultural  product  profit  margins  and \nlower cost and more timely access to schools, medical clinics, and employment centers.  The \nlower transport costs will increase mobility among the poor, especially poor women, facilitating \ntheir  access  to  social  centers  and  enabling  there  to  become  more  politically  active,  thus \nincreasing the empowerment of the poor. \n \n6. \nThe estimates do not include the expected benefits to the poor of improving the tertiary \nrural  connectivity  roads,  which  is  a  project  component.  These  additional  benefits  likely  will  be \nsubstantial, because they link poor farmers and their villages with the state road system, which \nare currently impassable during the monsoon season. The rural connector roads to be included \nin  the  Project  will  be  selected  based  primarily  on  poverty-reduction  criteria  during  the  design \nphase of the Project.  \n \n7. \nThese estimates are based on surveys of over 150 passengers, 150 drivers, 50 freight \nshippers, and 27 residents in the zone of influence, along with 19 focus group discussions and \ndirect field observations on a carefully selected representative sample of 525 kilometers of the \nstate  road  system  that  will  be  improved  by  the  Project.    This  fieldwork  was  completed  during \nMarch \u2013 April 2002.  The sample sizes and selected road segments are more than adequate to \nensure  that  the  results  can  be  generalized  to  the  entire  project.  Results  conform  to  available \nsecondary  data  and  the  results  from  key  informant  interviews.    Moreover,  from  a  classical \nstatistical viewpoint, the sample sizes are adequate based on the observed degree of variation \nin the estimated parameters of the target populations.       \n \n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nThe surveys reveal that 90% of the poor in the zone of influence use the project roads, \n8. \nand that a third of passengers on motorized vehicles are poor. The surveys and focus groups \nshow that the degree of competition in the transport services market, including passenger and \nfreight  services,  varies  depending  on  the  condition  of  the  road.  On  roads  in  better  condition, \nthere is more competition, while on roads in very worn condition, traffic is low and competition is \nweak. This suggests competition will become much stronger as the roads are improved during \nthe Project. With the poor being such heavy users of the roads now, and competition hindered \nby  weak  road  conditions,  the  Project  will  catalyze  competition  and  service  frequency,  thus \nreducing passenger fares and freight rates, and leading to even more intense use of the Project \nroads by the poor. The findings underpin the estimates of the Project\u2019s estimated effects on the \npoor. \n \nB. \n\nParticipatory Process \n\n9. \nCommunity  consultations  and  the  social  assessment  show  unanimous  support  for \nimproving  state and rural  roads.  According to the residents, poor road conditions increase the \ncost of access by the poor to health clinics, schools, labor markets, and farmers\u2019 markets.  By \nimproving  the  project  roads,  the  poor  residents  see  that  these  costs  will  decline  and  that  they \nwill  have  easier  access  to  the  key  institutions  that  determine  their  quality  of  life.  In  the  focus \ngroups,  improved  access  ranked  among  the  top  three  critical  needs  identified  by  participants.  \nOther  top  needs  include  improving  the  water  management  system,  increasing  the  supply  of \nelectricity,  and  lowering  the  cost  of  education.  The  consultations  also  showed  that  the  poor, \nespecially the poor women, are concerned about road safety, and the lack of bus stops in the \nvillages  and  hamlets.  Residents  are  aware  that  the  bad  road  conditions  and  lack  of  access \nincreases  the  cost  of  retrieving  farm  inputs  and  delivering  farm  products  to  market,  and  that \nthese high transport costs cut their farm incomes. \n \n10. \nBased  on  the  findings  and  recommendations  from  the  community  consultations,  the \ndesign  consultant  will  incorporate  improvements  to  shoulders,  to  improve  the  safety  for \npedestrians  and  nonmotorized  traffic;  covered  bus  stops  with  seating;  wayside  amenities;  and \ntruck stops, to reduce road congestion where necessary.  The improvements will be done if they \ndo  not  entail  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  To  address  concerns  about  road  safety,  the \ndesign will include information signs and speed break near schools, hospitals, and areas heavily \ntrafficked by pedestrians, such as towns and market. \n \n11. \nThe  design  consultant  and  Public  Works  Department  of  the  Government  of  Madhya \nPradesh (PWDGoMP) will create a consultative working group on labor relations, with stakeholder \nrepresentatives,  to  prepare,  implement,  and  monitor  a  labor  retrenchment  plan  for  PWDGoMP.  \nThe  working  group  will  provide  a  forum  for  counseling,  stakeholder  participation,  information \ndissemination,  and  coordination  with  other  government  agencies.    The  design  consultant  will \nprovide  a  participation  strategy  to  prepare,  implement,  and  monitor  the  labor  rationalization \nprogram (LRP). \n \nC. \n\nGender Issues \n\n12. \nResearch  elsewhere  in  South  Asia  has  shown  that  when  access  is  difficult,  men  more \nactively participate in society than women.  When access improves, as it will under the Project, \nwomen become more mobile and more socially active; they will gain political empowerment and \nbe better able to reach the centers of political activity. The Project will thus increase women\u2019s \nempowerment. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n61 \n\nThe  public  consultations  revealed  substantial  wage  differentials  between  men  and \n13. \nwomen  providing  the  same  labor.    The  differentials  favor  men.  The  program  will  encourage \nemployment  targets  for  women  to  participate  in  road  construction  activities  and  require \ncontractors  to  pay  the  same  wage  to  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  Targeting  and \nproviding a quota for women in road rehabilitation will provide employment opportunities where \nsuch  opportunities  are  scarce,  and  allow  women  to  increase  family  incomes.  During  the \nrehabilitation  phase  the  contractors  will  be  required  to  provide  service  stations  that  will  ease \nworking  conditions  for  women  who  do  take  on  the  road  works  jobs.    A  gender  strategy  is  not \nrequired as a component of the Program. \n \nD. \n\nResettlement \n\nThe  Program\u2019s  optimal  engineering  solutions  for  road  rehabilitation  do  not  entail  land \n14. \nacquisition  or  resettlement.  The  rehabilitation  works  will  be  within  the  existing  alignments, \nfocusing  on  improving  pavement,  drainage  and  shoulders.  The  program  will  not  entail \ndismantling of encroachments or land acquisition. Visual surveys along selected road sections \nindicated  few  exceptions.  The  existing  right-of-ways  are  adequate  to  accommodate  the \nproposed rehabilitation. \n \nE. \n\nIndigenous People \n\n15.  Madhya  Pradesh  has  about  20%  of  India\u2019s  scheduled  tribe  population,  with  the  Betul-\nParatwada corridor having a high tribal population of near 40%. The Project, however, will have \nno  significant  negative  impact  on  the  tribal  population.  Thus,  an  indigenous  people\u2019s \ndevelopment plan  is not needed.    \n \nF. \n\nLabor Issues \n\nThe  Project  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable  labor \n16. \nlaws  and  do  not  employ  children  for  construction  or  maintenance  jobs.  Contractors  will  be \nrequired to provide appropriate facilities for child dependants in construction campsites. \n \nPWDGoMP  employs  9,520  permanent  staff  and  20,000  casual  workers,  and  is  seriously \n17. \noverstaffed at the lower levels.  Institutional restructuring will require retrenching the labor force \nby about 30%.  Most layoffs likely will occur at the lower levels. To mitigate the social impact, \nthe Madhya Pradesh Government (MPG) will establish a social safety net mechanism following \nthe  example  of  the  program  established  under  the  previous  ADB  Madhya  Pradesh  Public \nResource Management Program.  The MPG will approve, with technical assistance, the LRP in \nOctober 2002. See Supplementary Appendix B for a summary of the LRP. \n \nG. \n\n Other Social Risks and Vulnerabilities \n\n18. \nThe  primary  risks  to  project  implementation  are  (i)  executing  agencies  and  other \nstakeholders  lacking  capacity  to  address  social  and  poverty  issues  (ii)  overlaps  between  the \nDepartment  of  Labor  and  PWDGoMP  could  impede  an  effective  retrenchment  plan  and  (iii) \ncounterpart funds may be inadequate to implement the LRP. \n \n19. \nthese  risks.  The \nconsultative group on labor relations will mitigate the risk of conflicts between the Department of \nLabor and PWDGoMP regarding the LRP. \n \n\nincorporates  countermeasures \n\nThe  project  design \n\nto  mitigate \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTo mitigate the remaining risks, the Project will: \n \n(i) \n\ndesign and implement the project performance management system that will provide \nfeedback for timely remedies \nprovide  institutional  support  to  PWDGoMP  and  Madhya  Pradesh  Department  of \nFinance during implementation \nprovide a long-term labor specialist to help implement the LRP  and \ninvolve  ADB  in  close  supervision  of  the  Project  to  correct  any  flaws  in  design  or \nimplementation. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \n20. \nA very specific risk is that the poor may not be enable to capture the expected benefits.  \nTo ensure that the poor are able to capture these benefits, the design consultant will develop a \nprogram based on strong public participation in a number of workshops. These workshops will \neducate: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\npoor farmers on to how to use commercial inputs and \npoor farmers on how to best market their surplus products; \npoor passengers on how to negotiate lower fares to reflect the cost savings going to \nthe bus and taxi drivers;  \npoor  shippers  products  on  how  to  negotiate  lower  freight  charges  reflecting  the \nimproved road conditions; and \npoor women on increasing their political and social involvement in the community. \n\n \n21. \nThe  design  consultant,  together  with  the  Executing  Agency  and  ADB,  will  develop  and \nimplement the project performance management system. The system will provide feedback on a \nnumber  of  indicators  to  show  that  the  benefits  are  being  passed  to  the  users  of  the  roads, \nparticularly  poor  users  of  the  roads  as  well  as  residents  in  the  zone  of  influence.  Some \nillustrative indicators that show the benefits being passed to the poor will include \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nimproved  construction  materials  being  used  by  residents,  and  poor  residents,  for \ntheir dwellings in the zone of influence; \nincreases in commercial sales of specific farm products, including rice, wheat, gram, \nand sorghum from the zone of influence; \nlower passenger fares on improved roads; and \nlower freight rates on improved roads. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFIGURE A9:  MACROECONOMIC LINKAGE OF ROAD SECTOR REFORM \n\nSTATE ROAD SECTOR REFORM\n\n \n\n \n\nImproved Governance \nIn Sector Management \n\nImproved Sector \nCapacity and \nCapability \n\nHigher Sector \nRevenue Growth\n\nMore Active Private Sector \nParticipation Outsourcing of \nProfessional Services to Market \n\nImproved \nInfrastructure/ \nRoad Transport \nServices \n\nReduced Fiscal \nBurden of MPG\n\nMore Efficient/Effective \nPublic Resource \nManagement Utilization \n\nTransparent, Conducive \nEnvironment for more \nEconomy, Efficiency and \nCompetition \n\nDecreased \nRecurrent Costs \nfor Road \nMaintenance \nthrough Higher \nQuality \nConstruction and \nMaintenance \n\nStable \nDemand for \nMassive \nConsumption \nItems \n\n \nMore \nConstructive \nEmployment \n\nBetter Access \nfor Real \nSectors to \nResources \nand Markets \n\nBetter Access \nfor the Poor \nto \nMainstream \nEconomy and \nOpportunities\n\nIncreased Credit \nto Encourage \nPrivate Sector \nParticipation \n\nHigher Public \nExpenditure \nCapital for \nPriority Social \nSector \n\n \n\n \nPoverty Reduction \n\n\f \n\n \nTable A9.1: Poverty Impact Analysis Corridors: Estimated Beneficiaries and Very Poor Beneficiaries \n \n \nProportion \nVery Poor \n\nDistricts  Population \n\nTotal \nBenefits \n\n2001 \n\nCorridor Number  \nand Name \n\nKm \n\nVery Poor \nBenefits \n\n1.
