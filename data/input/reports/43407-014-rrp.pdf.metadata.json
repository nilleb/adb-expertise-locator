The  current  project  has  four  outputs: \nsupport  for  the  national  household  poverty  targeting  system,  conditional  cash  grants,  capacity \ndevelopment,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  expected  outcome  is  increased  household \nconsumption  and  increased  use  of  education  and  health  services  by  Pantawid  families, \nespecially  mothers  and  children.  The  expected  impact  is  reduced  income  poverty  and  non-\nincome poverty. The proposed additional financing will finance cash grants under the program\u2019s \nnationwide  expansion,  which  as  of  2014  includes  high  school  students  aged  15\u201318  years  old. \nThe  proposed  TA  will  strengthen  operational  effectiveness.  The  current  project  has  a  strong \nimplementation record, and most of its performance targets have been achieved or exceeded. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nStrong  project  performance.  Project  performance  has  been  consistently  rated  on \ntrack. 3 Many  output  targets  have  been  surpassed  before  the  scheduled  closing  date  of  31 \nMarch 2016. The national poverty targeting system is used by the CCT and by 24 other national \nsocial programs, exceeding the target of  three programs. More than 637,700 poor households \nreceive ADB-financed cash grants, well above the target of 580,000. Among the grant recipients, \n92% are women, surpassing the 90% target. More than 93% of households regularly meet the \nCCT  program\u2019s  education,  health,  and  family  development  session  conditions,  exceeding  the \ntarget  of  80%.  Impact  evaluation  confirms  that  the  outcome  is  likely  to  be  achieved  (para.  7). \nBenefit incidence analysis shows that Pantawid\u2019s targeting accuracy to the poorest 20% of the \npopulation  is  among  the  best  in  the  world  and  compares  very  favorably  with  the  more \nestablished large-scale CCT programs in Latin America.4 \n \n4. \nAs  of  11  December  2015,  when  94.6%  of  the  scheduled  implementation  period  had \nelapsed,  cumulative  contract  awards  had  reached  $387.7  million,  or  97%  of  the  loan  amount, \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2010.

Manila. \n\n2   Building  Bridges  for  the  Filipino  Family.  Program  details  including  conditions  are  in  The  Design,  Expansion,  and \n\nImpact of Pantawid, available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n3  Performance  toward  these  output  targets  is  based  on  data  provided  by  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and \nDevelopment  (DSWD)  from  the  poverty  targeting  database  and  the  Pantawid  management  information  systems, \nincluding the beneficiary update system and the compliance verification system. \n\n4  World Bank. 2015. State of Social Safety Nets 2015. Washington, DC. \n\n\fand  disbursements  had  reached  $382.1  million,  or  96%.  Safeguard  compliance  has  been \nsatisfactory; there are many positive measures to include indigenous peoples, such as tailored \nfamily development sessions and a modified CCT program in remote areas. The current project \nhas no resettlement or environmental impacts. It has a gender equity theme, and a vast majority \nof  the  grantees  are  women.  Implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  has  been  satisfactory. \nThe  project  has  made  significant  efforts  to  manage  risks,  but  country  and  CCT  program  level \nrisks remain high. Risk mitigation measures are being strengthened (paras. 19\u201320 and 24). \n \nPantawid\u2019s  expansion.  Implemented  by  the  Department  for  Social  Welfare  and \n5. \nDevelopment  (DSWD),  the  Pantawid  program  has  expanded  rapidly  since  it  enrolled  about \n340,000  of  the  country\u2019s  poorest  households  (known  as  set  1)  in  2008.  ADB\u2019s  current  project \npartially finances grants to 637,700 households added in 2009 (set 2) and in 2010 (set 3).5 More \nthan 1.2 million households were added as set 4 in 2011. By the end of 2014, with the addition \nof sets 5\u20137 and the households covered under the modified CCT, it delivered benefits to more \nthan 4.4 million households nationwide and had become the world\u2019s third largest CCT program.  \n \nTechnical enhancements. Technical enhancements to the CCT program, supported in \n6. \npart  by  ADB  TA  under  the  current  project,  have  included  (i)  a modified  CCT  for  remote  areas \nand  homeless  street  families,  (ii)  a  higher  grant  amount  for  high  school  students  to  reduce \ndropouts,  (iii)  new  monthly  youth  development  sessions,  and  (iv)  an  expansion  of  eligibility  to \nchildren  aged  15\u201318  years  old.6 The  expanded  eligibility  introduced  in  2014  aims  to  support \nchildren through high school graduation and thus improve their future employment and earning \npotential. High school students must maintain a passing grade average and be promoted to the \nnext grade level to continue receiving benefits. The CCT program is a demand-side intervention \nthat  complements  the  Department  of  Education\u2019s  kindergarten-to-grade-12  reforms  supported \nby ADB\u2019s results-based Senior High School Support Program.7  \n \n7. \nImpact evaluation results. Two rounds of rigorous impact evaluation in 2011 and 2013 \ndemonstrate  that  Pantawid  is  achieving  its  objectives  of  beneficiaries\u2019  greater  use  of  health \nservices,  including  maternal  care,  and  higher  school  enrollment  and  attendance  rates. 8 \nPantawid  households  increased  their  spending  on  education  and  health.  The  cash  grants \nhelped raise the enrollment rate of children 6\u201311 years old to 98%. After the grant increase for \nhigh school students, the enrollment rate for children aged 12\u201315 in poor households receiving \nthe CCTs was 6 percentage points higher than for those in nonprogram households just above \nthe  poverty  line.  More  Pantawid  program  mothers  were  seeking  pre-  and  post-natal  care  and \ndelivering  babies  in  health  facilities  than  mothers  in  nonprogram  households.  Child  labor  in \nprogram  households  was  lower  than  in  nonprogram  households  by  an  average  of  7  days  per \nmonth. Another significant finding  was that the grants do not encourage dependency. There is \nno evidence that the CCTs are a work disincentive for the adults in program households. Self-\nrated  poverty  was  lower  by  7  percentage  points  among  Pantawid  households  than  non-\n                                                \n5  Sets are not equivalent to geographic areas. One municipality may have beneficiaries from different sets, added in \ndifferent  years.  Sets  are  an  indicator  of  length  of  participation  in  the  program.

The  additional  financing  will  scale  up  a \nsuccessful  national  flagship  social  assistance  program  that  has  strong  government  ownership \nand  robust  implementation  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  The  overall  project  is \nconsistent with the original development objective, and the outcome will remain the same. The \nproject  remains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially  sound.  The  project  is \naligned with the government\u2019s priority to expand social protection services, as reconfirmed in the \n2014  midterm  update of  the  Philippine  Development  Plan for  2011\u20132016.9 It  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Philippines for 2011\u20132016, under which ADB seeks \nto  support  high  economic  growth  that  is  both  sustainable  and  inclusive.  The  strategy  aims  to \ncomplement  interventions  to  improve  the  supply  of  social  services  with  other  interventions  to \nincrease the  demand for  those  services.  This  is  to  be  achieved  through  medium-term  support \nfor  social  protection.10 A  majority  of  CCT  program  beneficiaries  (59%)  are  in  the  Visayas  and \nMindanao regions of the Philippines, which aligns with ADB\u2019s geographic focus. Efficiency gains \nand strong links with the  original  project  design and implementation  arrangements  confirm  the \nsuitability of the additional financing modality. \n \n9. \nPolicy  and  operational  challenges.  The  proposed  additional  financing  and  TA  will \naddress a number of policy and operational challenges. While evaluation shows that the CCTs \ncontinue to add value, benefit levels have not been adjusted for inflation.11 When the CCT was \npiloted in 2007, the average transfer was about 23% of beneficiaries\u2019 average annual household \nincome. This was similar to the levels under successful Latin American CCT programs that set \nbenefits high enough to provide a sufficient incentive to access services but low enough to avoid \ndistorting the labor market. By 2013, average transfers\u2014about $16 per household per month\u2014\nrepresented about 7% of the average beneficiary household income.12 The additional financing \nand TA will support analytical work and policy dialogue to help determine new benefit levels and \nthe  timing  of  an  increase  that  will  ensure  achievement  of  the  program  objectives  and  avoid \npoliticization.  Other  policy  and  operational  challenges  identified  and  being  addressed  by  the \nDSWD include (i) unavailable or poor quality education and health services in some areas; (ii) \ncoordination  among  the  Pantawid  partner  agencies  that  deliver  social  services;  (iii)  targeting \nerrors of inclusion and exclusion (para. 11); (iv) possible local political capture or interference; \nand (v) payment delivery challenges, especially in remote areas (para. 24).13 \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe impact and outcome of the overall project remain the same, but with minor changes \nin wording and adjustment of some performance targets to reflect the CCT program\u2019s expanded \nscope  and  coverage. 14 The  additional  financing  will  sustain  the  current  project\u2019s  gains  and \nsupport a share of the education and health grants to all Pantawid families nationwide. \n                                                \n9  National Economic and Development Authority. 2014.

Based on the assessment of progress toward the \ncurrent  project\u2019s outcome  targets  (see  Table  1  in  the  Summary  of  Project  Performance,  available  from  the  list  of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2), the original baselines have been retained. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nOutput  1:  National  targeting  system  to  select  poor  families \n\nC. \n \n11. \nimplemented \nefficiently.  The  current  project  supported  the  implementation  of  the  national  household \ntargeting  system.  By  2011, the  system  had  assessed  10.9  million  households  and determined \n5.2 million to be poor. A 2010 presidential executive order requires all government agencies to \nuse  the  system\u2019s  database  to  target  poor  households.  As  of  September  2015,  25  national \nprograms use the database, as do 1,095 of the country\u2019s 1,715 local government units. Under \nthe second round of targeting, for completion by early 2016, the DSWD is assessing 15.3 million \nhouseholds  to  identify  poor  and  vulnerable  families  based  on  provincial  poverty  lines.15 The \nproxy  means  test  model  has  been  refined  to  reduce  the  targeting  errors  common  to  any \ntargeting system. The additional financing will provide TA support for DSWD\u2019s efforts to reduce \nexclusion  error\u2014which  occurs  when  poor  families  who  should  be  eligible  for  the  program  are \nexcluded\u2014  through  special  validation  of  inclusion  requests  submitted  through  the  program\u2019s \ngrievance  redress  system.

Households can receive (i) a health grant of P500 a month for 12 months of the \nyear, and (ii) an education grant for the 10 months of the school year for up to three children, \ncurrently set at P300 per month for preschool and elementary students and P500 per month for \nhigh school students. The health conditions include that children visit health centers for services \nincluding  growth  monitoring  and  immunizations;  that  pregnant  women  receive  prenatal  and \npostnatal care, and their deliveries are attended by skilled personnel; and that grantees attend \nmonthly  family  development  sessions.  Upon  verification  that  conditions  have  been  met, \ntransfers  are  paid  directly  into  grantees\u2019  Land  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (LBP)  accounts, \naccessible  via  ATMs.  In  areas  without  ATMs,  LBP  contracts  other  payment  service  providers. \nThese include  rural  banks,  cooperatives,  money  couriers  and postal  companies.17 Compliance \nwith  conditions  has  been  consistently  very  high  and  stood  at  93%  for  health,  96%  for  family \ndevelopment sessions, and 98% for education as of August 2015.18 The additional financing will \nfinance  a  share  of  the  conditional  health  and  education  grants  for  households  in  all  sets.  The \nconditions  are  the  same,  but  the  eligibility  age  has  been  raised  from  14  to  18  (para.  6),  and \nthere is no longer a 5-year limit on program participation. \n \n13. \ntransfer  program  operations \nstrengthened. The current project supported capacity development for the Pantawid program\u2019s \nnational and local management activities. These include household registration, organization of \ncommunity  assemblies,  compliance  verification,  and  payment  management.  The  additional \n                                                \n15 The national per capita poverty line was P1,756 per month in 2014. A new policy defines the near poor as those \nfamilies  with  income  less  than  10%  higher  than  the  poverty  line.  In  2016  DSWD  aims  to  switch  the  primary \nbeneficiary unit from household to family, since extended households often comprise multiple nuclear families.  \n16 Inclusion errors are a product of the statistical model that predicts household income based on the proxy means \ntest,  which  collects  easily  observable  household  characteristics  that  are  correlated  with  welfare  (e.g.  housing \nquality, ownership of assets, education levels).  \n\nfor  conditional  cash \n\nOutput  3:  Capacity \n\n17 DSWD  and  LBP  periodically  invite  institutions  involved  in  money  remittances  to  submit  proposals  to  serve  as \npayment conduits in the distribution of cash grants.

The loan will  have a  25-year  term,  including  a grace  period  of  5  years, an \nannuity method with 10% discount factor, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The \naverage loan maturity will be 18.31 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% \nper  annum.  The  cost  of  the  Pantawid  program  during  2016\u20132019  is  estimated  to  be  $6.16 \nbillion,  of  which  the  government  will  finance  86.2%  (including  taxes,  duties,  and  financing \ncharges).  ADB\u2019s  additional  financing  will  represent  6.5%.  The  government  has  requested  the \nWorld Bank to finance $450 million or 7.3% of the total. The $400 million ADB loan will finance \nconditional health and education cash grants to poor families under output 2, with TA support for \noutputs 1, 3, and 4.

The \nDSWD  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  implementation  unit  will  be  the  Pantawid  National \nProgram Management Office, which has 333 approved positions as of the third quarter of 2015. \nA  high-level  interagency  national  advisory  committee  (NAC)  guides  the  DSWD  and  its  17 \nregional  program  management  offices.  As  of  the  third  quarter  of  2015,  the  regional  program \nmanagement  offices  had  more  than  13,240  approved  positions,  most  of  which  are  for  the \nPantawid  program  field  facilitators  who  work  directly  with  the  4.4  million  CCT  households. \nParent  groups  of  25\u201330  families  are  coordinated  by  about  120,000  volunteer  parent  leaders. \nLocal  government  units  have  assigned  full-time  staff  members  to  the  program.

The  DSWD  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  2016\u20132019  implementation \nperiod  is  synchronized  with  the  additional  financing.  The  TA  will  provide  timely  and  demand-\ndriven advice in important policy and operational areas. The TA will deliver three outputs: (i) the \nidentification of social protection policy gaps and the development of options to address them, \n(ii)  the  identification  of  operational  gaps  and  governance  risks  in  social  protection  service \ndelivery  and  the  preparation  of  action  plans  to  deal  with  them,  and  (iii)  the  preparation  and \ndissemination  of  knowledge  products  on  best  practices  in  social  protection.  The  DSWD  has \nindicated a need for TA support in areas such as (i) adjusting the level of Pantawid benefits to \naccount  for  inflation;  (ii)  exploring  the  feasibility  of  using  CCT  and  community-driven \ndevelopment  mechanisms  in  disaster  response;  (iii)  redefining  staff  roles  under  the  DSWD\u2019s \nthree core programs to achieve greater efficiency in the delivery of services; and (iv) developing \nsocial  protection  interventions  for  the  near-poor,  for  former  combatants,  and  for  farming \ncommunities  affected  by  natural  calamities. 22  Operational  areas  for  TA  support  include \nindependent  audit,  special  validation  of  inclusion  requests,  capacity  development  for  parent \nleaders,  social  marketing,  and  internal  spot  checks.  The  TA  will  coordinate  closely  with  other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,200,000,  of  which  $1,000,000  will  be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-Others).  The \ngovernment counterpart contribution will account for the remaining 20% of the total TA cost.23 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nBased  on  the  2011  and  2013  impact  evaluation  results  (para.  7),  the  potential  private \n18. \nand  social  returns  from  investing  in  CCTs  remain  substantial.  Inclusive  growth  and  poverty \nreduction  in  the  Philippines  continue  to  be  constrained  by  inadequate  investment  in  human \ncapital.  The  gap  between  the  high  school  completion  rates  of  children  in  the  poorest  income \nquintile  and  those  in  the  richest  is  large.  The  potential  economic  yield  from  high  school \ngraduation is three times that from graduating from only the elementary level. CCTs are making \nchildren healthier, keeping them in school, and reducing child labor. Benefit incidence analysis \nhas  verified  that  benefits  reach  the  poorest  (para.  5).  The  payment  of  grants  to  women  is \nexpected to add to the multiplier effect of cash inflows on local economic activity, since women \ntypically  spend  more  on  locally  produced goods  and  services for  their  families  than  men.  The \npoverty targeting system, now adopted by 25 national programs, has increased the efficiency of \ngovernment  investments.  The  Pantawid  program  benefits  are  considered  financially  viable, \nefficient,  and  sustainable  due  to  (i)  strong  government  commitment  to  social  protection,  (ii)  a \nlikely continued expansion of the government\u2019s fiscal space, (iii) the reduction in inclusion and \nexclusion  errors  as  a  result  of  improved  targeting,  and  (iv)  the  positive  impact  of  improved \n                                                \n22 The DSWD\u2019s three core programs are Pantawid, the National Community-Driven Development Program, and the \n\nSustainable Livelihoods Program. \n\n23 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nhuman capital on returns to labor and taxable income that will raise future government revenues \nand further expand fiscal space for social spending.24 \n \nB. \n \n19. \nThe  government  has  demonstrated  a  commitment  to  improving  country  systems  for \npublic  financial  management  (PFM),  procurement,  and  good  governance.25 The  PFM  system \nhas  been  enhanced  at  the  national  level,  but  its  overall  performance  remains  relatively  weak. \nThe  associated  fiduciary  risks  are  substantial.  The  public  procurement  framework  is  well-\ndeveloped.  It  generally  functions  soundly  and  presents  only  moderate  risks.  Anticorruption \npolicies  are  in place,  and the government\u2019s resolve  to fight  corruption  has  helped improve  the \ninvestment  climate.  Despite  many  positive  developments,  however,  the  overall  governance \nenvironment  has  substantial  risks  at  the  technical  level,  weak  institutional  capacities,  and \ninadequate accountability mechanisms. \n \n20. \nAt the Pantawid program level, the pre-mitigation PFM fiduciary risk is high. The 2011\u2013\n2014 reports by the country\u2019s Commission on Audit find fairness in the presentation of financial \nstatements  but  indicate  systemic  weaknesses  in  internal  control.  Before  loan  disbursement, \nADB  and  the  DSWD  will  agree  on  a  time-bound  risk  management  action  plan  to  address  the \nrecurrent audit findings of duplicate names in the Pantawid payroll, unclaimed or unpaid grants, \nand  delayed  liquidation  of  payroll  advances  by  payment  service  providers.  DSWD  is \nimplementing  a  number  of  risk  mitigation  measures,  such  as  piloting  biometric  systems.  The \nDSWD  is  well-governed,  highly  competent,  and  has  many  years  of  experience  in  effectively \nmanaging the Pantawid program and other foreign-assisted programs. The DSWD leadership is \nconsidered  sincere  in  its  efforts  to  fight  corruption,  and  systems  are  in  place  to  minimize \ncorruption risks.26 The department engages with civil society, particularly through the Pantawid \nprogram\u2019s  family  development  sessions  and  grievance  redress  system.  The  DSWD  is \nimplementing  measures to address the  policy  and operational  challenges  identified  in  its  2013 \ngovernance and anticorruption risk review of the program (para. 9). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the \nDSWD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the \nPAM (footnote 21). \n \nC. \n \n21. \nPoverty  and  social  impacts.  CCTs  are  results-based  financing  at  the  household \nlevel.27 They provide financial support to poor households after the conditions for health center \nvisits, school enrollment and attendance, and participation in family development sessions have \nbeen  met.  Attaching  these  conditions  to  the  cash  grants  promotes  safe  motherhood  and \nguarantees  investments  in  the  human  capital  of  children  to  prevent  the  next  generation  from \ninheriting  its  parents\u2019  poverty.  The  financial  support  helps  poor  families  make  ends  meet  and \nalleviates  the  extent  of  their  impoverishment  in  the  short  term,  but  the  benefits  are  not \nnecessarily  enough  to  immediately  reduce  the  national  poverty  incidence.  The  real  poverty \nreduction  impact  is  expected  over  the  long  term  when  children  who  are  healthier  and  better \neducated as a result of the CCTs complete their schooling, join the labor force, and earn higher \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n24 Economic Analysis and Updated Financial Analysis (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n25 ADB. 2015.

The  overall  project  will  retain  the  original  gender  equity  theme. \nMothers and children are the main Pantawid program target groups, and more than 90% of the \nregistered  grant  recipients  are  women.  The  Pantawid  grants  will  continue  to  address    (i) \nwomen\u2019s  low  use  of  health  care  services,  particularly  reproductive  health  services;  (ii)  high \nmaternal  and  infant  mortality,  (iii)  intra-household  gender  inequalities,  and  (iv)  poor  women\u2019s \nlimited access economic resources. The program\u2019s family development sessions train mothers \non  issues  such  as  citizenship  and  rights,  leadership  and  teamwork,  responsible  parenthood, \nnutrition,  healthy  family  and  community  relationships,  and  disaster  preparedness.  A  2014 \nresolution by the program\u2019s NAC requires that men participate in a specially designed session \nthat covers reproductive rights and gender-based violence. Minor updates to the original gender \naction plan reflect recent program adjustments (footnote 20). \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe  overall  project  retains  the  original  safeguards  classification  of  category  B  for \nindigenous people and category C for environment and involuntary resettlement. The Pantawid \nprogram  aims  to  significantly  improve  the  health,  education,  and  income  status  of  indigenous \npeople,  who  currently  make  up  13.3%  of  the  4.4  million  beneficiary  households.  The  National \nCouncil  for  Indigenous  People  is  a member  of  the  NAC.  The  DSWD  designed  and  adopted  a \nmodified  CCT  in  geographically  isolated  and  disadvantaged  areas  in  2013  after  a  series  of \nregional  participatory  consultations  involving  indigenous  cultural  communities.  Tailored  family \ndevelopment session modules are delivered in indigenous areas. Implementation of the existing \nplan for indigenous peoples has been consistently satisfactory. It is supervised by the DSWD\u2019s \nmodified  conditional  cash  transfer  unit  with  the  support  of  regional  focal  points.  The  plan \nensures  that  indigenous  cultural  communities  continue  to  be  meaningfully  consulted  by  and \nparticipate in the program and has been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \nE. \n \nImplementation  risks  and  measures  to  mitigate  them  are  described  in  the  risk \n24. \nassessment  and  management  plan  and  summarized  in  Table  4.30 Overall  pre-mitigation  risks \nare high. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nWeaknesses in internal \ncontrol indicated by \nrecurrent audit findings \nmay increase fiduciary risk. \n\nThe DSWD and ADB will agree on a time-bound risk management action plan with \nclearly defined deliverables and responsibilities to address recurrent audit findings \nincluding duplicate entries in the payroll, unclaimed grants, and delays in payroll \nliquidation.  \n\nProgram integrity and \nsuccess could suffer from \npolitical capture or \ninterference. \n\nBeneficiary selection is based on an objective poverty targeting system with protocols \nfor public validation. Public information campaigns disseminate information, \nguidelines, entitlements, and GRS procedures.
