Thailand, which has a large and growing power requirement, has limited hydropower \npotential  and  is  dependent  on  natural  gas  which  is  depleting  over  time.  The  Lao  PDR,  on  the \nother hand, has the largest hydropower potential in the region at 20,000 MW, but the smallest \ndomestic  demand.  The  GMS  countries  are \nto  enable \ncomplementary  access  to  cost-efficient  energy  resources.  The  Lao  PDR  plans  to  export  up  to \n7,000 MW of hydropower to Thailand and up to 5,000 MW to Viet Nam. \n \n3. \nThe  Lao  PDR,  classified  by  the  United  Nations  as  a  least  developed  country,  has  a \ngross  domestic  product  per  capita  of  $1,330  in  2013.  The  country  aims  to  be  out  of  the  least \ndeveloped  country  category  by  2020.  The  energy  sector  is  critical  to  achieving  this  goal  as \nelectric  power  is  a  vital  source  of  export  earnings.3 As  of  2013,  only  3,222  MW  have  been \ndeveloped. The government\u2019s target is to install an additional 9,300 MW of capacity by 2022. To \nachieve this, it must mobilize capital and technical capacity through partnerships with the private \nsector. \n \n4. \nThe  project  is  one  such  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP),  to  be  implemented  with \ninvestment risks and capital shared with the private sector. After attempts by some international \npartners  to  develop  the  project  in  the  1990s,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \nthrough Nippon Koei conducted a feasibility study during 1998\u20132002. The study confirmed the \nfeasibility  of  the  project  on  a  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  basis  and  recommended  a  development \nplan based on optimal physical, economic, and safeguard considerations. The government and \nNippon  Koei  executed  an  agreement  in  May  2003  for  development  of  the  project.  Kansai \nElectric  Power  (Kansai)  joined  and  executed  the  project  development  agreement  with  the \ngovernment in April 2006. Subsequently, Nippon Koei sold its stake in the project and Electricity \nGenerating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) joined as the third developer. \n \n5. \nIn  January  2007,  Kansai,  EGAT,  and  the  government  (together,  the  sponsors) \napproached  ADB  for  assistance  with  the  project,  based  on  the  prominent  role  ADB  played  in \n\n                                                              \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  GMS  countries  are  Cambodia,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  Thailand,  and  Viet \n\nNam. \n\n3  Export of power generated around 21% of the Lao PDR\u2019s total export receipts in 2013. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nearlier  Lao  PDR  hydropower  projects. 4 The  sponsors  asked  ADB  to  provide  financing  and \nguidance  on  the  environment  and  social  preparation  to  ensure  that  the  project  would  be \nimplemented  sustainably  and  compliant  with  international  best  practices.  After  more  than  four \nyears of project development involving tariff negotiation with EGAT, as off-taker, and a search \nfor  credible  and  competitive  construction  contractors,  the  sponsors  executed  the  tariff \nagreement with EGAT on 12 July 2011 and the project was confirmed for start-up in 2019. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n6. \nThe project involves construction and operation, on a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer basis, of a \n290  MW  hydroelectric  power  generation  facility,  on  the  Nam  Ngiep  River,  in  the  provinces  of \nBolikhamxay and Xaysomboun. The dam site is 145 kilometers (km) northeast of Vientiane. 5 It \nhas three major components: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\na main power station (272 MW) with a concrete gravity dam (height 148 meters) \nand  a  reservoir  (surface  area  67  square  kilometers),  with  effective  storage \ncapacity  of  1.2  billion  cubic  meters;  electricity  produced  will  be  exported  to \nThailand; \na  reregulation  power  station  (18  MW)  with  a  concrete  gravity  dam  (height  \n21 meters) and a reregulating reservoir (surface area 1.3 square kilometers), with \neffective storage capacity of 4.6 million cubic meters; electricity produced will be \nsupplied within the Lao PDR;6 and \na 125 km 230-kilovolt (kV) transmission line to connect the main power station to \nthe Nabong substation near Vientiane. \n\n \nThe  Nabong  substation  is  already  connected  to  the  Udon-Thani  substation  in  Thailand \n7. \nby a double-circuit transmission line. The Nam Ngum 2 (NN2) hydropower project installed the \nLao  PDR  side  of  this  transmission  line  and  EGAT  installed  the  line  on  the  Thai  side.  It  is \ncurrently  energized  at  230  kV  and  transmits  NN2\u2019s  power  to  Thailand.  NN2  will  upgrade  the \nsubstation  by  the  time  of  NNP1PC\u2019s  interconnection,  and  the  transmission  line  will  then  be \nenergized  at  500  kV.  The  government  through  Electricit\u00e9  du  Laos  (EDL)  will  purchase  these \nfacilities from NN2 for integration into the national grid. After the transfer, NNP1PC and NN2 will \nenter  into  an  interconnection  agreement  with  EDL  and  pay  wheeling  charges  for  use  of  the \nfacilities. EDL will engage EGAT to operate and maintain the Nabong facilities. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\nThe  sponsors  established  NNP1PC  as  a  special-purpose  company  to  implement  the \n8. \nproject. The  shareholders  are  Kansai  through  KPIC  Netherlands  B.V. (KPIC)  with  45%,  EGAT \nthrough  EGAT  International  (EGATi)  30%,  and  the  government  through  Lao  Holding  State \nEnterprise (LHSE) 25%. \n \n9. \nKansai is the second largest of the nine major power utilities in Japan. The company has \n167  power  plants  with  a  total  generating  capacity  of  34,958  MW  (of  which  151  hydropower \nplants  provide  8,208  MW).  Outside  of  Japan,  Kansai  owns  1,106  MW  of  generating  capacity, \n                                                              \n4  ADB.  1994.

Manila. \n\n5  The Nam Ngiep River is a tributary of the Mekong River. \n6  The project will evacuate power for domestic supply through a 40 km 115 kV transmission line that will connect the \nreregulation power station to the existing 115 kV Pakxan substation. This transmission line will be installed by EDL \nand is not part of the project. \n\n\fincluding the 345 MW San Roque hydropower plant in the Philippines, the 218 MW Rojana gas-\nfired  power  plant  in  Thailand,  and  the  3,300  MW  Sonoko  gas-fired  power  plant  in  Singapore. \nKansai  is  coursing  its  investment  into  NNP1PC  through  its  wholly  owned  investment  vehicle \nKPIC. Kansai has a long-term debt rating of A3 from Moody\u2019s. KPIC is not rated. \n \n10. \nEGAT  is  Thailand\u2019s  largest  electricity  generator  with  installed  capacity  of  15,010  MW \n(including  3,436  MW  of  hydropower),  representing  46%  of  the  country\u2019s  installed  capacity. 7 \nEGAT  is  investing  in  the  project  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  EGATi,  established  to \nexpand  EGAT\u2019s  activities  in  neighboring  countries.  The  project  is  EGAT\u2019s  first  direct \ninternational investment and is part of its strategy to invest about $3 billion in Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, and Myanmar through EGATi and other channels. EGAT was rated BBB+ by Standard & \nPoor\u2019s until June 2013, but is currently not rated by any agency. EGATi is not rated. \n \n11. \nLHSE is the holding company established by the government to own and manage equity \ninvestments in power projects. Since Nam Theun 2 was commissioned in April 2010, LHSE has \nstarted receiving regular dividend revenue. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact  \n\n12. \nIncreased  regional  cooperation.  The  project  will  contribute  to  increased  regional \ncooperation  between  the  Lao  PDR  and  Thailand  through  the  trade  of  clean  energy.  The  Lao \nPDR has limited opportunities for trade and economic growth but has a very large hydropower \npotential that can be harnessed to generate foreign exchange revenues. Thailand, on the other \nhand, has a strong and growing economy, but this growth is at risk due to the country\u2019s heavy \nreliance on its dwindling natural gas reserves.  \n \nIncreased electrification rate. The project will provide 18 MW of capacity for domestic \n13. \nsupply and help the Lao PDR reach its target of increasing the electrification rate from 82% to \n92% by 2024. While electrification of 82% is not low among its GMS peers,8 provincial rates in \nthe Lao PDR range as low 33%. The country\u2019s power demand per capita is also low at 402 kWh \nper year.9 \n \n14. \nPromotion of environmentally and socially sustainable private sector investment. \nThe  Lao  PDR  does  not  have  the  financial  or  technical  resources  to  effectively  monetize  its \nhydropower potential and, hence, must partner with the private sector for financing and capacity \nbuilding. Following the success of earlier private sector hydropower projects, the Lao PDR has \nin recent years attracted significant new investments in hydropower. However, affected people \nand  civil  society  are  increasingly  raising  concerns  that  projects  are  implemented  without  due \nconsideration  of  environment  and  social  impacts.  By  contrast,  the  project,  under  ADB\u2019s \nguidance, has been prepared to reflect the best international practice in controlling impacts, in \nparticular  impacts  from  involuntary  resettlement.  The  success  of  the  project  will  demonstrate \nthat socially responsible investment is not incompatible with financially sound business and will \n\n                                                              \n7  EGAT also buys electricity from other generators: 12,742 MW from Thai independent power producers, 2,445 MW \nfrom  Thai  small  power  producers,  and  2,405  MW  from  neighboring  countries  (including  2,105  MW  from  the  Lao \nPDR). \n\n8  The  electrification  rates  in  neighboring  countries  (2011)  are  34%  in  Cambodia,  48%  in  Myanmar,  70%  in  the \n\nPhilippines, 96% in Viet Nam, and 99% in Thailand. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS \n\n9  Annual  per  capita  electricity  consumption  in  neighboring  countries  (2011)  is  164  kWh  in  Cambodia,  110  kWh  in \nMyanmar,  647  kWh  in  the  Philippines,  1,073  kWh  in  Viet  Nam,  and  2,316  kWh  in  Thailand.  http://www.gms-\neoc.org/gms-statistics/overview/electricity-consumption-per-capita \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nencourage  more  responsible  private  sector  investment  into  infrastructure  development  in  the \ncountry.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\nThe  outcome  will  be  increased  private  sector  provision  of  reliable  and  clean  power  to \n15. \nThailand  and  the  Lao  PDR.  The  outcome  will  be  measured,  among  others,  by  the  amount  of \nelectricity  delivered;  greenhouse  gas  emissions  avoided  in  Thailand;  and  cash  revenues \nreceived by the Government of the Lao PDR in dividends, royalties, and taxes from the project. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nThe  project\u2019s  outputs  will  be  (i)  a  290  MW  hydropower  plant  completed  in  an \nenvironmentally  and  socially  sustainable  manner,  (ii)  economic  benefits  to  the  Lao  PDR,  and  \n(iii) development of local government capacity in environment and social protection. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n17. \nStrategy  2020.  The  midterm  review  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  reaffirmed  infrastructure \ndevelopment, regional cooperation and integration, and private sector development as three of \nthe  strategic  priorities.10 As  a  PPP  cross-border  power  plant  to  provide  infrastructure  essential \nfor private sector development, the project is fully consistent with the midterm review of Strategy \n2020. \n \n18. \nRegional  strategy.  The regional cooperation strategy and program for the GMS has a \nvision  of  a  prosperous,  integrated,  and  harmonious  subregion  achieved  through  regional \ncooperation  that  promotes  economic  growth,  environmental  sustainability,  private  sector \ndevelopment,  and  capacity  development. 11 The  project  will  be  a  good  example  of  mutually \nbeneficial regional cooperation through EGAT\u2019s investment and through trading of power. \n \n19. \nCountry  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for  the  Lao  PDR \nfocuses  on  promoting  pro-poor  sustainable  growth  including  through  regional  power  trading.12 \nThe project will generate revenues for the country and employment, and improve workers\u2019 skills \nthrough the transfer of technical and safeguard knowledge. The project will provide community \ninfrastructure, which will have economic multiplier effects. \n \n20. \nSector strategy. ADB\u2019s Energy Policy emphasizes renewable energy, access to energy, \nand capacity building. 13 The project is consistent with the policy as it will provide Thailand with \nan additional renewable energy source, increase the power supply to the Lao PDR, and provide \nbest practice in the implementation of a hydropower plant. \n \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  A  key  finding  from  ADB\u2019s  2010  independent \n21. \nreview of the Lao PDR energy sector assistance indicates the government lacks the capacity to \nmanage  environmental  and  social  impacts. 14 Further  interventions  for  capacity  building  are \n                                                              \n10 ADB. 2014.

Substantial \nfinancing from the private sector is required to build these projects. However, the international \nbanking community perceives inherent risks in financing such projects without the involvement \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nof  development-focused  international  financial  institutions  such  as  ADB.  Through  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation,  these  banks  find  confidence  to  co-lend  because  the  project  will  be  financed  in  a \nstructurally  sound  manner  and  will  comply  with  high  environment  and  social  standards.  The \nnature of the project (i.e., long construction period, high up-front capital expenditure, competitive \ntariffs,  long  asset  life,  and  revenue  contracts)  requires  long-tenor  debt  to  match  its  cash  flow \nprofile. ADB will mobilize long-tenor debt from the commercial banks and will play a crucial role \nin ensuring the financial viability of the project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  project  is  categorized  A  for \n25. \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people;  and  as  highly  complex  and \nsensitive.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  risks  of  the  project  and  its \nassociated  facilities  were  identified,  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and \ncompensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard plans.  \n \n26. \nKey environmental impacts are associated with the inundation of 68 square kilometers of \nterrestrial  and  riverine  habitats.  Specialist  experts  conducted  biodiversity  studies  in  the \ninundation zone and surrounding areas in 2007, 2013, and 2014.15 Residual impacts will include \n(i) permanent loss of 3,944 hectares of natural habitat and 3,549 hectares of modified habitat; \n(ii)  alteration  of  aquatic  habitat;  and  (iii)  a  limited  loss  of  habitat  for  threatened  species. 16 \nAssessments  indicate,  however,  that  the  project  area  is  not  a  critical  habitat  for  any  species, \nand a comprehensive program of mitigation, management, and biodiversity offsets are planned. \nThe  biodiversity  offset  program  aims  to  ensure  no  net  loss  of  biodiversity  consistent  with  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement and will include establishment of watershed management program \nand conservation area for the forested and riverine areas of the Nam Ngiep River; and species \nspecific conservation measures in the Nam Ngiep watershed and other sites. Special attention \nwill  be  given  to  an  endangered  fish  species,  the  giant  pike  carp  (Lucioprynus  striolatus), \nincluding monitoring and protection of habitat and support for a species recovery program.  \n \nThe environmental management plan also provides measures for advanced warning for \n27. \ndownstream  hydrological  changes  and  management  of  riverbank  erosion  during  operations. \nNNP1PC\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to manage its environmental and social risks \nare  deemed  adequate.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  were \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements. NNP1PC has allocated a sufficient budget for \nimplementation  of  environmental  and  social  plans.  As  this  is  a  highly  complex  and  sensitive \nproject,  an  independent  advisory  panel  is  monitoring  the  project  and  NNP1PC  will  submit \nquarterly monitoring reports on the implementation of environmental management plan. \n \n28. \nNNP1PC  prepared  a  resettlement  and  ethnic  development  plan  to  address  direct \nimpacts  on  432  households  requiring  relocation  and  an  additional  estimated  561  households \nlosing  only  land  for  project facilities,  including  access  roads  and the  230  kV  transmission  line. \nThe Hmong ethnic communities living in five villages, which are among those directly affected, \n\n                                                              \n15  Surveys were supplemented by village interviews, desk reviews, and geospatial datasets. \n16  Threatened species directly or indirectly recorded in the project area include plant species: (1 critically endangered, \n7  endangered,    and  5  vulnerable);  mammal  species  (1  critically  endangered,  7  endangered);  bird  species  (1 \ncritically  endangered,  2  endangered);  reptile  species  (2  endangered);  amphibian  species  (none);  and  aquatic \nspecies (1 critically endangered, 5 endangered). \n\n\fhave provided broad community support for the project. Such support is documented in minutes \nof meetings and agreements authenticated by village leaders. \n29. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  having  some  gender  elements  with  measures  to  benefit \nwomen  incorporated  in  the  project  design  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment  (1998).17 Effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for \nother adverse social impacts and ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, are \nincorporated in the social development plan.18 NNP1PC will report regularly on compliance with \nnational labor laws and adherence to internationally recognized core labor standards. ADB will \nensure  that  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  requiring  NNP1PC  to \ncomply with national labor laws and, in addition, to take specific measures (including in relation \nto  contractors)  in  relation  to  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standard  for  the  ADB-\nfinanced portion of the project, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n30. \nThe  sponsors  and  NNP1PC  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best \ninternational  practice  relating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of \nterrorism. ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nAssurances \n\n31. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  of  the  Lao  PDR  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the \nproposed  assistance  to  NNP1PC.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form \nand substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board \nof Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n32. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe direct loan of up to $50,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nthe  B  loan  of  up  to  $77,000,000  funded  from  participating  international \ncommercial banks; and \nthe  local  currency  direct  loan  of  up  to  B3,040,000,000  (or  its  equivalent  in  US \ndollars if baht are not available) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; \n\nto Nam Ngiep 1 Power Company Limited for the Nam Ngiep 1 Hydropower Project in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n22 July 2014 \n\n                                                              \n17 Measures  include  compensation  payments, land  and  property  titles in  the names  of  husband  and  wife,  maternal \n\nand nutrition health programs, and women's adult literacy and financial literacy programs. \n\n18 ADB. 2003.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nThe  project  is  located  in  three  districts  classified  as  among  the  poorest  in  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic \n(Lao  PDR)  and  as  the  focus  of  poverty  reduction  efforts  under  the  National  Seventh  Five-Year  National  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. The project is aligned with the plan\u2019s designation of energy and mining \nas  a  strategic  sector.  Development  in  the  power  subsector  is  focused  on  using,  developing,  and  expanding \nhydropower sources for environment-friendly energy; and expansion of lines to meet the twin objectives of supplying \nelectricity  domestically  for  the  country\u2019s  development  and  export.a  The  development  of  the  energy  sector  will \ngenerate income for the government to spend on socioeconomic development. The country partnership strategy of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Lao PDR focuses on promoting pro-poor sustainable growth, including \nthrough power trading and rural electrification.  \n\nB. Results from the Poverty and Social Analysis during PPTA or Due Diligence  \n\n1. Key poverty and social issues. The Lao PDR\u2019s recent economic growth reduced poverty incidence from 46% in \n1992 to 27% in 2008. However, poverty remains high and is predominantly rural. In the districts where the project \nwill  be  implemented,  the  percentage  of  households  classified  as  poor  ranges  from  Thathom  with  55%,  Hom  with \n57%, and Bolikhan with 76%. This is due to accessibility difficulties and higher proportion of ethnic groups. Poverty \nincidence  among  ethnic  minorities  is  higher  (40%\u201355%)  than  among  the  majority  Lao-Tai  population  (29%).  The \nproject will generate about $600 million of government revenues, which may be used for socioeconomic programs. \nThus poor communities elsewhere will indirectly benefit from poverty reduction; expenditures in health, education, \nrural roads, and environment; and rural electrification.  \n2. Beneficiaries. The project will contribute to economic growth, poverty reduction, job creation, and improvement of \nelectricity  supply  in  the  project  impact  zones.  Construction will  directly  employ  about  1,800,  with  many  more  jobs \nexpected from support services and provision of food and agricultural products to construction workers.  \n3. Impact channels. The project has undertaken a comprehensive social analysis, and prepared a resettlement and \nethnic  development  plan  (REDP)  and  a  social  development  plan  (SDP)  comprising  (i)  a  public  health  action  plan \n(PHAP), (ii) a labor management plan (LMP), and (iii) a community development plan (CDP). Benefits of the project \nwill  be  directly  delivered  to  the  affected  people  through  these  plans.  In  addition,  the  project  will  generate \nemployment  opportunities  and  prioritize  local  labor.  At  the  macro  level,  the  project  will  contribute  about  \n$600 million income to the government, which will be useful in implementing national socioeconomic programs that \nare expected to benefit the whole population. \n4.  Other  social  and  poverty  issues.  Programs  jointly  implemented  by  government  line  agencies  and  civil  society \norganizations  (CSOs)  and  funded  by  international  development  partners  will  address  concerns  on  public  health, \neducation, human resource development, wildlife conservation, deforestation, and human trafficking. \n5. Design features. Measures in the REDP are designed to double the incomes of affected people in real terms and \nbring all directly  affected  poor  and  vulnerable  households above  the  poverty  line  within  10  years  of plant  startup. \nThe  PHAP  will  implement  programs  on  community  health  in  the  resettlement  area,  general  community  health \nimprovement  in  the  project  impact  zones,  capacity  building  for  village  health  volunteers  and  district  health  office \nstaff, water supply and sanitation program, and a special social management and mitigation plan for camp followers. \nConstruction-related  public  health  impacts  are  addressed  through  contractors\u2019  obligations  regarding  minimizing \ndust,  noise  and  air  pollutants,  and  traffic  safety.  The  LMP  comprises  measures  to  ensure  adherence  to  national \nlabor  laws  and  core  labor  standards,  policy  on  contractors  and  other  providers  of  goods  and  services,  policy  for \nlocal  labor  recruitment, skills  training  for  local  residents,  community management  and  infrastructure  development, \nhuman  trafficking  impacts  and  management,  conflict  resolution,  and  strategy  and  measures  for  employees  and \nworkers\u2019  health.  The  CDP  focuses  on  aspects  that  could  help  improve  the  community  as  a  whole,  and  lift  up the \nquality of life, living standards, and income of affected people, complementing other programs described here and in \nthe  REDP.  It  comprises  the  gender  action  plan,  programs  for  youth  and  children,  and  a  cultural  awareness  and \nheritage preservation program.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nII. \n\nPARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERING THE POOR \n\n1. Participatory approaches. During a feasibility study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, three national \nconsultations  were  conducted  during  1998\u20131999  and  six  local  consultations  in  1999.  Since  2008,  the  project \nconducted  at  least  50  consultations,  including  joint  site  visits  with  villagers  in  the  impact  zones  and  local \ngovernments. The perspectives of local residents and governments have been considered, resulting in changes to \nthe project design including the location of the resettlement site, alterations to livelihood programs, and reduction of \nthe maximum reservoir level. In May 2014, the project conducted consultations with CSOs, international agencies, \nprovincial and district government agencies, and affected people. Continued consultations will be undertaken by the \nproject.  A  grievance  mechanism  is  in  place  to  address  feedback  and  concerns  throughout  construction  and \noperation. \n2. Civil society\u2019s role. CSOs and international agencies were consulted on the safeguards mitigation plans.  \n3. Explain how the project ensures adequate participation of CSOs in project implementation? The project will work \nwith CSOs to implement the SDP and has identified CSOs dealing with health, HIV/AIDS, people with disabilities, \neducation,  environment,  programs  for  youth  and  children,  cultural  awareness,  and  heritage  preservation.  CSOs \nidentified include Handicap International, Action with Lao Children, Action for Women in Distressing Circumstances, \nPestalozzi Children's Foundation, World Wildlife Fund, Save the Children Norway, and World Education/Consortium \nin the Lao PDR. \n4. Civil society organization participation envisaged during the project: \nM \n\n  Information gathering and sharing    M Consultation     Collaboration   \n\n Partnership \n\n5.  Participation  plan.  Yes.  A  public  consultation  and  participation  program  is  included  in  the  REDP.  Poor  and \nvulnerable  households  have  been  identified,  and  special  measures  will  be  implemented  to  mitigate  impacts  and \nenhance their well-being. Key features include an adult literacy program, housing adaptation for disabled, and year-\nround  food  security.  Social  development  and  community  consultation  teams  have  been  formed  by  the  project  to \nimplement these measures. \n\nIII.  \n\nGENDER AND DEVELOPMENT \n\nGender mainstreaming category: Some gender elements  \nA.  Key  issues. Women head about 8% of households in affected villages. Key issues include (i) high illiteracy of \nethnic  minority  women;  (ii)  women\u2019s  and  girls\u2019  poor  health, particularly  due  to  heavy  physical  workloads, frequent \npregnancies, poor hygiene and sanitation, and limited health facilities; (iii) livelihoods, and different roles of men and \nwomen in the domestic economy of affected households; and (iv) low status given to girls, raising the  risk of girls \nbeing sold as domestic or sex workers by parents. Five villages and a hamlet affected by the reservoir are inhabited \nby Hmong ethnic minority. Hmong culture is patrilineal and patriarchal and does not permit women to inherit or co-\nown  land  and  property.  Moreover,  during  construction,  an  influx  of  migrant  workers  may  pose  potential  risks  of \nHIV/STDs and trafficking of children and women.  \n\nB.  Key  actions.  As  women  from  ethnic  groups  and  vulnerable  households  are  more  disadvantaged  and \noverburdened  than  others,  a  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  as  part  of  the  SDP.  It  provides  for  separate \nconsultations with women, compensation payments, land and property title in names of husband and wife, second \nwives  entitled  to  separate  titles  in  their  names,  maternal  and  nutrition  health  programs,  women's  adult  literacy \nprogram,  and  livelihood  and  skills  training  programs.  Examples  of  specific  targets  include  40%  of  scholarships \nreserved for girls; 100% of land titles to be issued in joint spousal names; for households with a husband and more \nthan one wife, 100% land titles for properties of second and third wives to be issued in wife's name and the name of \nanother family member, to be chosen by the wife; 100% of bank books to be opened in the names of both husband \nand wife; and at least one woman in every affected household to be involved in livelihood training activities. \n      \n\n Other actions or measures \n\n  Gender action plan      \n\n No action or measure \n\n    \n\nA. Involuntary Resettlement  \n\nIV.  \n\nADDRESSING SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES \nSafeguard Category:  \n\n A    \n\n B     \n\n C     \n\n FI \n\n1.  Key  impacts.  The  project  will  relocate  432  households  from  six  villages  and  one  hamlet,  which  will  all  be \ninundated. In addition, another 561 households from 31 villages will have other direct impacts, i.e. 163 households \nfrom three villages in the upper reservoir area will lose a considerable part of their low-lying agricultural land; 117 \nhouseholds from 2 villages will  share resources with the resettled community; and another 281 households from 26 \nvillages will lose a small portion of their arable lands or temporary access to lands due to the construction of the 230 \nkilovolt transmission line and access roads. \n2. Strategy to address the impacts. The project will provide replacement land and housing or cash compensation for \nall  affected  people.  Livelihood  restoration  support  will  be  implemented.  The  project\u2019s  social  management  office \nincludes  ethnic  Hmong  staff  responsible  for  resettlement  infrastructure  development,  social  preparation,  public \nhealth,  labor  management,  compensation,  livelihood  restoration,  and  monitoring  and  documentation.  The  project \nhas established a grievance redress mechanism, which allows affected people to raise concerns and grievances in  \na transparent manner. If the project\u2019s mediation and reaction do not lead to a successful conclusion, affected people \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\ncan file a grievance with the village, district, and/or provincial grievance redress committees.  \n3.

Affected households are mainly from Hmong and Lao ethnic groups. Five Hmong villages will be \n\n C     \n\n  A    \n\n B     \n\n FI \n\nrequired to relocate.  \n\nIs broad community support (BCS) triggered?  \n Yes. BCS has been obtained from the ethnic Hmong communities \nin  zone  2  lower  reservoir  and  zone  3  construction  area.  Meaningful  consultations  have  been  conducted  in  these \ncommunities  since  2008,  including  exploring  options  to  avoid  or  minimize  involuntary  resettlement  impacts; \nevaluating various resettlement sites; and discussing compensation and potential livelihood restoration measures, \nresettlement site lay-out, and house designs. In 2013 and 2014, the project conducted good faith negotiations with \nthe  Hmong  communities,  which  have  resulted  in  (i)  larger  land  allocation  in  Houay  Soup;  (ii)  culturally  sensitive \nvillage lay-out and house design, relocation timeline for graveyards, and development benefits such as scholarships \nand  community  development  fund;  and  (iii)  the  option  of  self-relocation  with  cash  compensation  plus  livelihood \nsupport  before  and  after  resettlement  for  those  relocating  within  the  project  influence  zones.  The  project  has \nimplemented  a  pilot  soil  improvement  program  at  Houay  Soup  in  cooperation  with  zone  3  affected  people,  to \nencourage  more  people  to  move  to  Houay  Soup  where  the  project  believes  there  is  higher  probability  for \nsustainable livelihoods, higher standards of living, better community infrastructure, and, therefore, better outcomes \nfor the affected people.  \n2. Strategy to address the impacts. Project activities and benefits have been structured in a culturally appropriate \nway, and good faith negotiations undertaken to address differing views of households in various villages. Male and \nfemale  Hmong  staff  have  been  employed  to  ensure  comprehensive  consultation.  The  REDP  addresses  the \nconcerns of all affected people, a significant number of which are Hmong. The SDP is intended to mitigate impacts \nand  promote  social  development  in  the  project  area.  These  plans  were  designed  in  consultation  with  the  ethnic \nHmong  communities  to  encourage  their  participation,  commitment,  and  ownership  to  ensure  their  sustainable \nimplementation. \n3.

Targets and indicators. The following indicators are included: standards of living of 100% of poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds affected by involuntary resettlement are brought to at least national minimum standards 10 years after \nthe  plant\u2019s  start-up,  issuance  of  100%  of  replacement  land  titles  in  joint  spousal  names,  40%  of  postsecondary \nscholarships reserved for ethnic Hmong girls, at least 500 Lao workers employed during construction, and about 80 \nLao workers employed during operation.   \n\n2. Required human resources. The project\u2019s social management office has about 35 staff to implement and monitor \nthe REDP and SDP.  \n3. Information in the project administration manual. Not applicable. \n4.  Monitoring  tools.  ADB  will  conduct  periodic  site  visits  and  review  monitoring  reports.  An  external  expert  will \nmonitor implementation of the REDP and SDP. The project is considered to be highly complex and sensitive, hence, \nan  independent  advisory  panel  has  been  appointed  to  monitor  management  of  the  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards and other social dimensions of the project during design and implementation.  \n\na  Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. 2011.
