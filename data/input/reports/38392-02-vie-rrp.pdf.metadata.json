Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no \nadverse environmental impacts identified. \n \nThe  program  loan  will  support  implementation  of  the  Poverty \nReduction  Program  III  outlined  under  the  development  partner-\nfunded Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 5), as part \nof  the  Government\u2019s  overall  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction \nand Growth Strategy (CPRGS).  The CPRGS provides a  medium-\nterm  framework  (2002\u20132006)  for  poverty  reduction  policies, \nprograms,  and  actions  in  Viet  Nam  with  specific  targets  for \ndevelopment  outcomes  by  2006.  This  annual  PRSC  is  the  last \ncredit  under  this  5-year  PRSC  cycle.  In  general,  targets  for  the \ndevelopment outcomes were well achieved. Several development \noutcomes have already outperformed their targets.   \n \nThe  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  community  in  Viet \nNam  considers  the  PRSC  to  be  an  important  instrument  for \nsupporting  CPRGS  implementation.  As  a  multisector  instrument \ncovering a range of issues related to poverty reduction, the PRSC \nframework provides  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) with an \nopportunity to (i) advance  and widen national policy dialogue in a \nwell-coordinated  and  comprehensive  manner,  (ii)  provide  lending \nand  nonlending  assistance  in  coordination  with  other  ODA \npartners,  and  (iii)  ensure  that  key  policy  issues  affecting  ADB \noperations  in  Viet  Nam  are  addressed  in  the  policy  dialogue \nbetween  the  Government  and  the  ODA  community  to  help \nachieve the common goal of poverty reduction and growth. \n \nIn addition to ADB, the World Bank and other major ODA partners \nintend  to  contribute  both  financial  and  intellectual  resources  to \nPRSC  5.  ODA  partners  include  Australia,  Canada,  Denmark, \nEuropean  Commission,  Germany,  Ireland,  Japan,  Netherlands, \nSpain, and United Kingdom. Switzerland, while not  a cofinancier, \nprovided  financial  support  for  coordinating  the  process.  The \nInternational  Monetary  Fund,  France,  and  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme participated in PRSC policy dialogue.   \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \nImpact and Outcome  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nlong-term  strategic \n\nADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  formulating  PRSC  5, and  has \npromoted  policy  dialogue  on  similar  issues  through  its  program \nlending activities and sector policy reforms. PRSC 5 complements \nADB support of Viet Nam\u2019s policy and institutional reforms.  \n \nThe  proposed  loan  adheres  to  ADB\u2019s  recent  endeavors  to  adopt \nprogram-based and sector approaches in its lending operations to \nreduce  transaction  costs  for  its  developing  member  countries  as \nwell  as  for  its  own  operations.  The  approach  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s  reform  agenda, \nframework,  and \nmedium-term strategies I and II, and will directly help fulfill ADB\u2019s \nobligations to the Rome Declaration on harmonizing procedures of \nmultilateral  development  banks  (2003)  and  the  recent  Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005). \n \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  proposed  loan  is  to  reduce  poverty \nand  sustain  high  economic  growth  in  Viet  Nam.  The  proposed \nloan  will  help  fund  PRSC  5  and  thereby  (i)  reduce  structural \nweaknesses  and  improve  the  business  environment,  (ii)  promote \nsocially  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  development, \nand (iii) modernize governance. \n \nSome  of  the  reforms  supported  by  the  PRSC  process  entail \nsubstantial cost to the budget.  Policy measures supported by the \nPRSC  operations,  such  as  the  safety  net  for  redundant  state-\nowned  enterprise  (SOE) workers,  recapitalization of  state-owned \ncommercial  banks,  provincial  health  care  for  the  poor,  and \nincreased  education  budget  allocation, \nrequire  additional \nspending.  These  are  costly  and  PRSC-specific  programs.  The \ncost of adjustment of  the PRSC is therefore greater than the cost \nof these four items, which is estimated  at US$400 million per year \non average for the past 4 years.  \n \nThe  estimated  cost  of  some  specific  PRSC-related programs for \nthe  2006  budget  is  approximately  US$601  million,  i.e.,  (i)  health \nfunds  for  the  poor\u2014about  US$44  million  due  to  expanded \ncoverage of beneficiaries according to the new poverty definition, \n(ii) \nthe \nGovernment  budget\u2014about  US$184  million, (iii) social safety net \nprogram for the retrenched SOE workers\u2014about US$219 million, \nand  (iv)  maintenance  cost  of  transport  infrastructure\u2014about \nUS$154 million.  \n \n\nincreased  spending  on  education  proportional \n\nto \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n         iii \n\nA total of more than US$210 million is expected to  be funded for \nPRSC 5 operations through ODA resources . The World Bank has \nalready  approved  a  US$100  million  credit  from  the  International \nDevelopment  Association  to  support  PRSC  5.  Cofinanciers \nproviding concessional loans include ADB (US$15 million), Japan \nBank  for  International  Cooperation  (to  be  determined),  and \nGermany  (\u20ac6  million).  Cofinanciers  providing  grants  include \nAgencia  Espa\u00f1ola  de  Cooperaci\u00f3n  Internacional  (\u20ac3  million), \nAustralian Agency for International Development (A$10 million [to \nbe  confirmed]),  Canadian  International  Development  Agency \n(Can$4  million),  Danish \nInternational  Development  Agency \n(DKr61  million),  European  Commission  (\u20ac10  million),  Ireland  (\u20ac3 \nmillion),  Netherlands  Ministry  of  Development  Cooperation  (\u20ac9 \nmillion\u2013\u20ac14  million),  and  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department \nfor \nInternational  Development  (\u00a320  million).  Swiss  Development \nCooperation, while not a cofinancier, provided financial support for \ncoordination of the process. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan  equivalent to  US$15 million in special drawing rights from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  be  provided.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  24-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an \ninterest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% during the \namortization period, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  loan  proceeds may be used  to \nfinance eligible imports incurred within 180 days prior to the date \nof  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan  reflects  ADB\u2019s  support  for \nimplementation  of  the  CPRGS  following  the  policy  framework  of \nthe  PRSC  5  program.  The  loan  will  contribute  to  financing \nadjustment  costs  resulting  from  implementation  of  the  policy \nmatrix, particularly prior actions for PRSC 5, and will support and \nfacilitate  the  Government\u2019s  continued  and  deepened  reform \nprogram for poverty reduction. \n \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n \nThe loan will be fully utilized by 31 December 2007. \n \nThe State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) will be the Executing Agency. \nSBV works in close collaboration with the World Bank to prepare \nand implement the PRSCs. \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nThree  main  arrangements  have  been  made  to  implement  this \nprogram.  First,  the  National  Steering  Committee,  established  in \nMay 2002 to implement the CPRGS and PRSCs, is chaired by the \ndeputy  prime  minister  in  charge  of  economic  reforms,  and \nconsists  of  representatives  from  24  relevant  line  ministries  and \ngovernment  agencies.  An  SBV  deputy  governor  acts  as  the \nstanding  vice  chairperson.  To  represent  PRSC  5\u2019s  policy reform \nareas,  the  steering  committee  has  several  representatives  from \nkey economic ministries, such as the ministries of agriculture and \nrural  development;  education  and  training;  finance;  justice;  labor, \ninvalids, and social affairs; and trade; as well as the Office of the \nGovernment; the Party's Economic Commission. \n \nSecond,  an  interministerial  working  group,  established  in  the \nMinistry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  comprises   representatives \nfrom  key  ministries  responsible  for  the  policy  reform  areas under \nthe  PRSCs.  Its  goal  is  to  help  implement  the  CPRGS  at \nsubnational levels. Third, the CPRGS Secretariat, established with \nthe  Ministry  of  Planning,  supports  provincial  governments  in \nadapting the CPRGS to their own context, and reformulating plans \nand  budgets  accordingly.  SBV  is  assigned  as  the  agency \nresponsible for preparing and implementing the PRSCs.  \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program \nloan will be disbursed to Viet Nam as the Borrower.  \n \nNo  supporting  import  documentation  will  be  required,  if  during \neach  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed, the \nvalue of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other \nofficial  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year. \nThe  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with this formula with \neach withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation under \nexisting  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \naudit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification. \n \n\n\f         v \n\nThe proposed loan will benefit Vietnamese people and businesses \non three fronts. First, through policy actions designed to facilitate \nViet Nam\u2019s transition to a  market economy, the loan will increase \nefficiency,  accelerate  economic  growth,  and  create  jobs.  These \npolicy  actions  will  help  improve  the  regulatory  framework  for \nprivate  sector  development,  and  enhance  transparency  and \naccountability in SOE operations and in banking. Second, through \npolicy  actions  addressing  social  inclusion  and  environmental \nsustainability,  the  benefits  include  improved  quality  of  education \n(especially in poor areas),  improved access of the poor to health \nservices,  and  help  for  securing  asset  ownership  through  the \nimplementation  of \nthe  Land  Law,  and  more  sustainable \nmanagement  of  natural  resources  including  through  strategic \nenvironment  assessments.  Third, \nthrough  policy  actions \naddressing  modern  governance,  the  benefits  are  increased \ntransparency  and  accountability  of  public  finances, and improved \nlegal  transparency  and  accessibility.  These  will  be  achieved \nthrough,  among  others,  better  coordination  plans  and  budgets, \nadoption of the  medium-term expenditure framework, and greater \naccountability in public finance and public administration.  \n \nThree  potential  risks  are  associated  with  the  proposed  loan: \ncontainment  of  contingent \ninclusion  and \nenvironmental  sustainability,  and  a  fiduciary  risk  related  to  public \nfinancial management.  \n \nFirst,  benefits  from  World  Trade  Organization  accession  will \naccrue  if  complementary  reforms  take  place  in  areas  such  as \ntrade logistics, infrastructure and financial services, taxes, and the \ninvestment climate. Through the PRSC process, the Government \nhas  already  decided  to  adopt  such  complementary  reforms \nincluding  a  classification  of \ninternational \nthe \naccounting  standards.  Through \nGovernment  has  continuously  strengthened  macroeconomic \nmanagement. \n \nSecond,  as  this  program  prepares  for  the  next  5-year  cycle  of \nPRSCs,  in  support  of  the  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan \n2006\u20132010,  a  potential  risk  of  income  disparities  exists  between \nurban  and  rural  as  well  as  Kinh  majority  and  ethnic  minorities. \nSuch disparities could increase over  the medium to long  term  as \nViet  Nam  strives  to  become  a  middle-income  country.  However, \nthis risk is mitigated by the strong commitment of the  Government \nto  keep  growth  inclusive  and  sustainable.  This  risk  could  be \nin  data  availability  and \naddressed \nanalytical  work  on  issues  arising  from  rural-urban  disparities \nincluded as part of the PRSC process.  \n \n\nthe  PRSC  process, \n\nloans  based  on \n\nliability,  social \n\nimprovements \n\nthrough \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nthe  Anticorruption  Law,  passed  by \n\nThird,  in  a  rapidly  growing  economy  the  opportunities  for  graft \ncould  outpace  improvements  in  anticorruption  policies  for  some \ntime.  While  considerable  progress  has  been  made  in enhancing \nbudget  transparency,  the  emerging  institutional  architecture  for \nmanaging  and  investing  state  capital  faces  governance  risks. \nHowever, \nthe  National \nAssembly  in  November  2005,  introduced  stronger  accountability \nrequirements  for  heads  of  agencies,  the  monitoring  of  assets  of \nsenior government officials and their families, and a more effective \nmechanism  to  support  individual  reporting  of  corruption.  The \nGovernment has encouraged the media to apply a more proactive \napproach to detecting and reporting corruption.  \n \nThe  Government  is  aware  of  the  potential  risks.  Through \nappropriate  measures  and  proactive  programs  during  program \nimplementation,  the  Government  will  undertake  risk-mitigating \nmeasures. ADB  and  the  other PRSC cofinanciers have provided \ntechnical  assistance  and  conducted  analytical  studies  to  help \npolicy  makers  formulate  and  execute  mitigating  and  corrective \nmeasures in anticipation of these potential risks. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Support  the  Implementation  of  the  Poverty \nReduction  Program  III  (SIPRP  III).  The  loan  follows  a  program-based  approach  and  is  part of \nthe Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 5), jointly processed by several development \npartners,  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth \nStrategy  (CPRGS).    The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  proposed  loan  is  in   \nAppendix 1.  \n \n \n\nI. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  is  committed  to  poverty  reduction  and  considers  poverty \n2. \nreduction  as  an  overarching  objective  in  its  national  socioeconomic  development  process. \nEvidence of the Government\u2019s commitment includes a series of strategic plans and documents, \nincluding the 5-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2001\u20132005, the CPRGS 2002\u2013\n2006,  and  the  10-Year  Socioeconomic  Development  Strategy  2001\u20132010.  The  CPRGS  is \nunique and widely recognized as a blueprint for development because it  is based on empirical \nanalysis and broad consultation with  the identification of clear development goals, specification \nof policies to attain the goals, and alignment of public resources to implement these policies.   \n\nA. \n\n \nDevelopment Objectives, Strategies, and Plans \n\n3. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  development  strategy  is  embodied  in  the  CPRGS.  The CPRGS embraces \nthree  broad  pillars:  Pillar  I:  high  growth  through  the  transition  to  a  market  economy,  requiring \nimplementation  of  an  ambitious  structural  reform  agenda;  Pillar  II:  equitable, socially inclusive \nand  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  requiring appropriate sectoral and social policies and \nprograms;  and  Pillar  III:  adoption  of  a  modern  public  administration,  legal,  and  governance \nsystem,  which  is  essential  for  attainment  of  the  first  two  goals.  The  CPRGS  pillars  are \nintertwined with cross-cutting themes such as employment generation for poverty reduction, and \nthe  link  between  public  financial  management  and  effective  delivery  of  social  services  to  the \npoor. Details on the CPRGS are given in Appendix 2.  \n \n4. \nIn  June  2006,  the  National  Assembly  endorsed  a  new  5-Year  SEDP  (2006\u20132010), \nfollowing the April 2006 endorsement by the 10th Party Congress. The SEDP is expected to be \nViet  Nam\u2019s  new  national  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  and  growth,  incorporating  the \ncommendable principles used in CPRGS formulation. Preparation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 involved \nbroad-based consultations at the grassroots, with the business sector, and with the international \nVietnamese community.  A  monitoring and evaluation framework  is being developed  under  the \nSEDP to track implementation progress. Equally important, the SEDP represents a move away \nfrom  material  production  targets  toward  development  objectives  with  a  strong  poverty  focus. \nThis  transformation  reflects  lessons  learned  in  the  process  of  preparing  the  CPRGS,  and \nsubsequently of \u201crolling it out\u201d 1 to the provinces. The financers of the PRSC process, as well as \nthe CPRGS roll out, actively support SEDP 2006\u20132010, which is seen as a defensible poverty \nreduction  strategy  for  the  coming  years.  Joint  work  on  translating  SEDP  2006\u20132010  into  a \nseries  of  strategic,  well-prioritized  policy  actions  to  be  supported  by  PRSCs  6\u201310  will  be \ndiscussed with the Government at the Consultative Group meeting of December 2006. \n\n                                                 \n1   \u201cRolling out\u201d refers to expanding the activity to provincial, district, and commune governments. \n\n\f2 \n\nRecent Economic Performance \n\nViet  Nam  is  making  good  progress  in  improving  its  policy  environment.  The  legislative \n5. \nprogram of the last  National  Assembly  focused  on  developing  a  legal  framework  to  facilitate \nWorld Trade Organization  (WTO) membership.  During  2005,  at  the  8th  session, the  National \nAssembly  approved  14  statues  including,  among  others,  Anticorruption  Law,  Bidding  Law, \nEnterprise  Law,  Investment  Law,  Law  on  Intellectual  Property,  and  Housing  Law,  Law  on \nEnvironmental  Protection  (revised),  Law  on  Thrift  Practice  and  Waste  Combat,  and  Law \nAmending  the  Complaint and  Denunciation  Law.  In  addition,  the  National  Assembly approved \namendments  for  the  Civil  Code.  This  code  will  clarify  rights  and  obligations  of  citizens  and \nfacilitate  private  sector  transactions.  At  its  9th  session  from  15  May  to  28  June  2006,  the \nNational  Assembly  passed  10  laws  including, among others,  Law  on  Information  Technology, \nLaw on Legal Aids,  Laws on Real Estate Business, Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, \nand  Law  on  Securities,2  and  Social  Insurance  Law.  Viet  Nam  recently  finalized  bilateral \nnegotiations  with  the  United  States  (US)  to  secure  its  planned  WTO  accession  at  the  end  of \n2006.3 In addition,  Viet Nam plays an important role in regional cooperation given its strategic \nlocation.  Viet  Nam  has  been  active  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Economic  Cooperation \nProgram activities. It is also actively pursuing implementation of the  Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development\u2019s Development Assistance Committee Paris Declaration 2005.  \n \nB. \n \nIn  the  past  decade,  Viet  Nam  experienced  both  high  economic  growth  and  impressive \n6. \npoverty reduction. This trend continues in spite of adverse shocks experienced in recent years \nincluding an avian influenza; flood and droughts; rising oil prices; a sharp rise in  prices of  key \nimported  inputs;  antidumping  suits;  and  other  market  barriers  to  exports  of  textiles,  garments, \nand other products. In spite of these adverse conditions, annual  GDP growth  averaged about \n7.5% over the last decade, with a high of 8.1% in 2005 (Table 1).4 This makes Viet Nam one of \nthe  fastest  growing  economies  in  Asia.  Robust  growth  in  domestic demand  and strong export \nperformance  has  fuelled  growth.  Growth  in  consumption  was  underpinned  by  higher  farm \nincomes reflecting rising prices for agricultural commodities, increases in the employment share \nof manufacturing and service sectors, and buoyant inward remittances. The investment to GDP \nratio has been increasing, and  was relatively high at 37.6% in 2005.5 The ownership pattern of \ninvestment has changed; the share of the domestic private sector in total investment  increased \nfrom 23% in 2001 to more than 32% in 2005, while the share of the state-owned sector declined \nfrom  60%  in  2001  to  52%  in  2005. Foreign direct investment commitments soared to  US$6.3 \nbillion in 2005 compared with US$4.2 billion in 2004.  \n \nFor the external sector, export growth accelerated during the past few years. Being a net \n7. \noil exporter, on balance  Viet Nam has benefited from higher crude oil prices. The trade deficit \nnarrowed  to  1.6%  of  GDP in 2005  from  5%  in  2004.  Remittance  inflows  and  tourist  receipts \nwere strong during the same period. As a result, the current account deficit has narrowed more \nthan  the  trade  deficit.  The  current  account  deficit  has  been  mainly  financed  by  foreign direct \ninvestment inflows and concessional lending. Consequently, external debt  was maintained at a \nmanageable 33% of GDP in 2005, with debt service at around  5% of exports. The August 2005 \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB technical assistance support helped with the drafting of key legislation and implementing regulations. \n3   Deputy  Minister  of  Trade  Luong  Van  Tu  and  US  Deputy  Trade  Representative  Karan  Bhatia  signed  a  bilateral \n\nmarket access agreement on 1 June 2006. \n\n4   Economic growth exceeded that in all other regional countries except the People\u2019s Republic of China. At the same \ntime,  Viet  Nam  recorded  unprecedented  reductions  in  poverty;  sustained  macroeconomic  development;  and \ncontinued improvements in key human development indicators such as education, health, and life expectancy. \n\n5   This is the second highest in the region after the People\u2019s Republic of China. While Viet Nam\u2019s savings ratio is also \n\nrelatively high, an increase in capital efficiency is urgently needed to sustain high growth.   \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\njoint  International Monetary Fund (IMF)-World Bank debt sustainability assessment placed Viet \nNam at low risk of external debt distress. External reserves rose to US$8.6 billion dollars (about \n11 weeks of imports of goods and services).6 Reserves have doubled in the past 3 years.  \n\nThe industry and service sectors continue to drive economic growth. Industry\u2019s share in \n8. \nGDP  has  consistently  increased,  reaching  40%  of  GDP  in  2005,  partly  reflecting  ongoing \nliberalization  and  promotion  of  the  private  sector,  a  relatively  inexpensive  labor  force,  and \nimproved  infrastructure.  The  two  sectors  together  account  for  nearly  80%  of  GDP.  Greater \ndiversification in industrial production and services is laying the foundation for sustained growth \nin output and employment.  The  services  sector  expanded  by  8.2%  in  2005,  the  highest  rate \nsince  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis,  reflecting  buoyant  performance  of  domestic  and  export \ntrade,  tourism,  transport  and  telecommunications,  and  financial  subsectors.  The  share  of \nagriculture in the economy continued to decline to about 21% of GDP in 2005, although it still \naccounts for the majority of employment. The consumer price index rose by 8.3% in December \n2005, partly reflecting a rise in food prices, which accounts for 47%  of the total price basket. A \nnumber of factors contributed to the rise in inflation, including higher international commodities \nprices, impact of avian Influenza, increase of salaries for professionals and skilled laborers, and \nsalary increases in the public sector. Financial sector development and robust economic growth \ncontributed  to  strong  growth  in  monetary  aggregates,  prompting  concerns  about  the  impact  of \ntoo rapid an expansion in credit on its quality and on inflationary pressures. The central bank, \nState  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV),  has  adopted  tighter  policies,  with  an  increase  in  the  required \nreserve ratio and discount rate.  Credit growth is estimated to have declined from nearly 40% in \n2004 to about 25% in 2005. Growth in broad money supply fell commensurately from 30.4% in \n2004 to 27% in 2005.  \n \n9. \nDuring the last 2 years, the Government\u2019s fiscal deficit has been limited to about 2% of \nGDP.  In  spite  of  falling  trade  tax  revenue  as  import  tariffs  are  cut  to  comply  with  ASEAN \n(Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations)  Free  Trade  Area  commitments,  total  revenues  have \nremained strong at around 22% of GDP largely because of  higher oil revenues, improvements \nin tax administration, and a growing number of businesses in the formal sector. GDP growth is \nprojected  at  around  7.8%  in  2006,  and  8.0%  in  2007, supported by strong domestic demand \nand export growth.7 The fiscal position is expected to remain expansionary but manageable to \ncover  the  cost  of  reforms  and  infrastructure.  Inflation  (average  for  the  period)  will  likely  be \nmoderate at 6.0% in 2005 and 5.2% in 2006.  \n \n10. \nThe fiscal deficit during the last 2 years, including official development assistance (ODA) \nonlending, was financed entirely through public debt. In both 2004 and 2005, revenue collection \nexceeded  budgeted  amounts  owing  to  buoyant  oil  revenues.  As  a  result,  the  deficit  remained \nbelow  budgeted  levels  despite  higher  expenditures.  Off-budget  investment  expenditures \nrepresented 1% of GDP in 2004 and  2% in 2005. Such expenditures, chiefly related to roads, \nirrigation,  and  upgrading  of  education  facilities,  were  presented  along  with  the  government \nbudget, and approved by the National Assembly. The expenditures include bonds issued mainly \nby  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  and  Hanoi  to  fund  municipal  infrastructure.  The  Development  Assistance \nFund  onlends  resources  raised  domestically  for  investment  purposes.  Such  onlending \namounted to 1.0% of GDP in 2004 and 0.5% in 2005. Public debt, including realized contingent \nliabilities from banking reforms, and off-budget and guaranteed items,  was around 43% of GDP \n\n                                                 \n6   World  Bank.  2006.

In  net  present  value terms, the debt \nincreases  from  28%  of  GDP  in  2004  to  about  29%  of  GDP  and  stabilizes  over  the  long-term. \nThe  main  risk  to  medium-term debt sustainability  stems from contingent  liabilities  associated \nwith reform of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). Given the uncertainty surrounding bank \nbalance sheets,  the  debt sustainability  assessment considers  two alternative reform scenarios \nassociated  with  contingent  liabilities  of  8%  and  20%  of  GDP. In these two scenarios, the  net \npresent value of public debt reaches peaks of 35% and 49 of GDP, before declining to 30% and \n33% over the long term. The  assessment will be updated in the third quarter of 2006 to reflect \nthe impact of the investment program contemplated in SEDP 2006\u20132010.  In addition, IMF has \nprovided a letter of assessment (Appendix 3).  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nProgress with Reducing Poverty \n\n12. \nViet Nam continued to make remarkable progress in social development.  Its success in \nreducing general poverty by almost two thirds over 11 years is unprecedented. Results from the \n2004  Viet  Nam  Household  Living  Standards  Survey  indicate  that  the  poverty  headcount \ndeclined substantially from 28.9% in 2002 to 19.5% in 2004. Progress toward attainment of the \ncountry\u2019s development goals and other key development outcomes has been sustained. Broad-\nbased and vigorous economic growth, greater macroeconomic stability, and targeted programs \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nto provide basic public infrastructure and services to vulnerable groups have  all helped reduce \npoverty. While income inequality has only increased marginally,8 significant pockets of poverty \nremain. Households whose consumption is presently just over the poverty line are vulnerable to \nany external shocks (e.g., low agriculture commodity prices and public health outbreaks). They \nremain at risk of returning to life below the poverty line.  \n \n13. \nPoverty  reduction  has  been  underpinned  by  rapid,  stable,  and  inclusive  economic \ngrowth,9  following  Viet  Nam\u2019s  steady  transition  from  central  planning  to  a  socialist-oriented \nmarket economic system. This transition has involved the  liberalization of markets, recognition \nof private property rights, and gradual opening up of the economy to  external markets for trade \nand  investment.  Political  stability,  prudent  macroeconomic  management,  relatively  equitable \ndistribution  of  the  factors  of  production,  and  relatively  high  and  equitable  human  resource \ndevelopment facilitated a strong response to reforms. Sustained agriculture sector growth, and \ngrowth  in  retail  trade  played  a  pivotal  role  in  reducing  poverty  in  the  early  stages  of  reforms. \nMore recently, rapid growth in private sector investment has generated many new employment \nopportunities in the industry and service sectors.  \n \n14. \nThe rate of poverty reduction has, however, slowed in recent years, i.e., 4.8 percentage \npoints  during  2002\u20132004  compared  with  9  percentage  points  during  1998\u20132002.10  Poverty \nreduction is slow or unchanged in the northern mountains and in pockets of  the Red River delta \nand  North  Coastal  regions,  contributing  to  regional  disparities.  Work  to  attain  the  Viet  Nam \nDevelopment  Goals  resulted  in  steady  improvement  in  social  indicators,  such  as  school \nenrollment, infant mortality, and other human development indicators. Viet Nam ranks 112 out of \n177 countries in terms of the  human  development  index,  i.e.,  0.691  in  2004,11 which is much \nlower  than  other  countries  in  the  regions;  but  ranks  much  higher  at  41  in  terms  of  the  human \npoverty index.  \n \n15. \nAlthough  Viet  Nam,  like  many  other  countries  in  the  region,  has  experienced  a  high \neconomic  growth  rate,  income  per  capita  is  still  low.  With  US$600 annual per capita income, \nViet Nam is considered one of the least income countries.12 With around 24% of the population \nstill living below the poverty line, poverty remains a major concern for the Government. Poverty \nis entrenched  in  some  regions,  such  as  the  east and  west  northern  regions,  and  the  north \ncoastal  and  central  highland  regions.  Social  tension,  lack  of  access  to  social  services, \ndemographic  reasons  like  migration,  land  ownership,  gender  and  ethnic  constraints,  and \nenvironment-affected risks are additional obstacles for economic growth and the main reasons \nfor people to fall back to poverty. Thus, a careful approach in terms of planning and delivery  is \nrequired to reduce poverty and to prevent the  return to poverty. This is, among others, reflected \nin CPRGS implementation.  \n \n \n \n16. \nIn  May  2002,  Viet  Nam  embarked  on  CPRGS  implementation.  The  CPRGS  was \nprepared  with  support  of  the  development  assistance  community,  including  ADB,  and  in \n\nThe Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy  \n\n2.  \n\n                                                 \n8   The estimated Gini coefficient for consumption increased from 0.34 in 1993 to 0.37 in 2002 and 2004. \n9   The  elasticity  of  poverty  reduction  has  been  higher  than  one\u2014e.g.,  a  per  capita  growth  rate  of  about  6%  was \n\nassociated with a reduction in poverty of about 7% from 1993 to 2002. \n\n10  ADB-Development Strategy Institute. 2005.

Implementation  of the  CPRGS \npolicy  reform  agenda  has  been  largely  through  pooling  of  ODA  resources,  both  grant  and \nlending,  under  the  PRSC  framework,  prepared  by  the  development  partners  in  close \nconsultation  with  government  agencies,  and  the  Government\u2019s  own  resources.  With  this \nsupport,  the  roll-out  of the  CPRGS  into  socioeconomic  development  plans  was conducted in \nmore  than  20  provinces  to  ensure  the  planning  process  captures  the  CPRGS  principles of \nincreased  focus  on  poverty  and  social  inclusion,  results-based  planning  and  monitoring,  and \nbroad  consultation.  This  planning  reform  is  important  to  ensure all policy actions are captured \ninto  the  long-  and  medium-term  strategies  at  all  levels  and  all  sectors.  The  development \npartners  must  align  their  country  strategic  plans  with  the  Government  plans,  while  moving \ntoward policy-based lending. Several development partners have jointly and actively conducted \nPRSC  formulation  and  review.  The  PRSC  framework  has  gradually  shifted  from  narrowly \ndefined  structural  reform,  such  as  the reform of  the  SOCB  and  state-owned enterprise  (SOE) \nsector  to  a  broader  and  deeper  policy  reform  agenda,  encompassing  the  three  pillars  of  the \nCPRGS: (i) transition to a market economy; (ii) social inclusion and environmental sustainability, \nand  (iii)  modern  governance,  as  well  as  embracing  many  sectors  and  issues  related  to \nsustainable poverty reduction and economic growth. \n \n17. \nThe  Government  has  well-established  coordinating,  monitoring,  and  oversight \narrangements for poverty reduction programs funded by various ODA resources. The National \nSteering Committee, established in September 2002, is chaired by a deputy prime minister, with \nan  SBV  deputy  governor  as  standing  deputy  chair.  Its  members  come  from  all  concerned \ngovernment  ministries  and  agencies.  The  steering  committee  guides  implementation  of  the \npoverty reduction programs under the CPRGS. The Government undertakes detailed reviews of \nimplementation progress of the CPRGS reform agenda, and discusses findings and emerging \nissues  with  its  development  assistance  partners,  usually  at  annual  Consultative  Group \nmeetings.  \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1.  \n\nProblem/Constraints Analysis \n\n \n \nOverall, CPRGS progress has been significant, but important structural issues and social \n18. \nchallenges  need  to  be  addressed.  Regarding  the  transition  to  a  market  economy,  the  reform \nagenda  has  relied  on  restructuring  the  state  sector,  and  not  on  massive  divestiture.  Important \nsteps have been undertaken, especially in terms of liberalizing trade and fostering competition. \nBut  addressing  hard  budget  constraints  faced  by  the  SOEs  has  proved  more  difficult.  On  the \nsocial side, regional disparities may widen as Viet Nam integrates with the world economy. Also, \nethnic minorities have benefited less from economic growth  than the majority of the population. \nThe  effective  delivery  of  social  services  to  the  poor,  especially  for  disadvantaged  regions  and \nethnic  minorities,  is  essential  to  keep  development  inclusive.  But  reform  in  the  social  sectors \nrequires changes in their financing, and needs to be carefully sequenced and aligned with the \ndecentralization  process.  As  for  governance,  institutional  reform  lags  the  rapid  economic \ntransition,  creating  opportunities  for  abuse.  The  Government  has  recently  taken  measures  to \nstrengthen  the  State  Inspectorate  and  State  Audit.  An  ambitious  initiative  to  strengthen  public \nfinancial  management  is  under  way.  But  considerable  weaknesses  persist  in  the  selection  of \npublic  investment  projects;  in  the  integration  of  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures;  and  in  the \nsupervision of project implementation, especially at the local level. Weak financial management \nsystems  and  insufficient  transparency  create  the  risk  of  inefficiency  in  the  allocation  of \nresources, mismanagement, and corruption. \n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nIn 2003, major movements and initiatives were undertaken on a broad range of reforms, \n19. \nespecially in relation to integrating with the world economy, permitting public investment in large \nSOEs  and  SOCBs,  and  designing  a  new  approach  to  fight  corruption.  The  Government  is \ncommitted  to  following  these  activities  through  as  they  promise  to  solidify  and  accelerate  the \nneeded  reforms.  The  Government  is  also  committed  to  adopting  a  more  decisive  stance  on \nbanking reform. As part of this, the Government will outline a clear separation of the functions of \nSBV  as  owner  of  commercial  banks  and  supervisor  of  the  system,  and  take  actions  to \nrestructure the SOCBs and improve their credit culture. The Government recognizes that for it to \nincrease lending from the ODA community, it will need to expedite implementation of its recent \ndecision on accession to WTO; increase private sector investment in large SOEs and SOCBs; \ntackle  directed  lending;  and  make  progress  on  governance  and  public  administration  reforms, \nthe anticorruption agenda, and financial sector reform.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCountry Strategy and Program of the Asian Development Bank \n\n \n20. \nADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is based on three pillars: (i) pro-poor economic growth, \n(ii) social development, and (iii) good governance. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Viet \nNam  2002-2004,13  emphasizes  (i)  generating  economic  growth  and  new  employment  through \nprivate  sector  development;  (ii)  improving  governance  and  public  administration;  and  (iii) \nfocusing on socially inclusive development especially in the central region, where the incidence \nof poverty remains high.  \n \n21. \nThe joint poverty assessment, completed in 2003 by the Government and a number of \ndevelopment  partners  including  ADB,14  confirms  that  economic  growth  continues  to  reduce \npoverty in Viet Nam, but that since the pace of poverty reduction is slowing, targeting of the poor \nis becoming more necessary.  In addition, a comprehensive poverty analysis in terms of poverty \nparticipatory  assessments  as  well  as  poverty  survey  data15  was  jointly  carried  out  as \nbackground  to  the  preparation  of  PRSC  5.16  ADB  also  prepared  the  country  poverty \nassessment17 to provide analytical inputs to the preparation of PRSC 5 and the country strategy \nand program 2007\u2013201018 (to be approved by the ADB Board of Directors in September 2006). \nTo deal successfully with the accelerating pace of international economic integration, Viet Nam \nneeds  to  modernize  its  economy  and  institutions,  and  accelerate  investment.  Faster  growth, \nwhich is likely to benefit the more advanced areas, will need to be accompanied by measures to \ndistribute the benefits of growth, including targeting of poor areas and groups.  \n \n \n \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n \n3. \n\na. \n\nMultiple -Tranche Program Loan \n\n22. \nA  special  evaluation  on  program  lending  by  the  Operations  Evaluation  Department \n(OED) reported that since 1987 program loans have generally been limited to two tranches.

Draft Country Strategy and Program: Viet Nam 2007-2010. Manila.                                                             \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nfloating  tranches  could  effectively  provide  flexibility  in  meeting  policy  change,  in  preserving  an \nincentive  for  policy  changes,  and  in  maintaining  continuous  engagement  with  a  longer  term \noutlook.19 The innovative lending modality  for the PRSCs is also referred to in the recent OED \nstudy Good Practices for the Evaluation of Policy-Based Lending by Multilateral Banks.20  \n\n23. \nThe proposed loan uses an innovative approach of a single-tranche program loan that is \nactually part of continuum of a multiple-tranche program loan. Since all of the  46 policy actions, \nincluding 15 tranche release conditions,  have already been achieved before loan approval, the \nloan proceeds will be disbursed as soon as the loan becomes effective. While this arrangement \nmay  seem  overly  flexible,  PRSC operations  are  outcomes oriented with ambitious but specific \noutcomes/targets set to be achieved in 5  years after the CPRGS is concluded. To identify the \nprior  conditions  for  each  annual  PRSC,  the  Government  and  cofinanciers  undergo  several \nrounds of policy dialogue to discuss and select effective but feasible prior actions from a pool of \nmany more policy measures.  Identification and sequencing of  a comprehensive reform agenda \nthat covers the medium term require strong analytical work. Lessons learned from similar World \nBank programs suggest that conducting joint analytical work between  development partners is \nimportant along  with  wide  consultation  with  academia,  civil  society,  and the Government. The \ndevelopment partners and academia can assist the Government in terms of analytical tools and \nsharing of international experience.  This arrangement of a multiple-tranche program loan could \ntherefore  be  effective  in  providing  flexibility  in  meeting  policy  change,  in  preserving  incentives \nfor policy changes, and  in maintaining continuous engagement with a longer term outlook than \nthe usual two-tranche program loan.  \n \n24. \nOver  time,  PRSC  operations  have  expanded  in  terms  of  reform  areas  and  number  of \ndevelopment  partners  involved.  The  increasingly  broader  scope  of  the  policy  dialogue  adds \nlogistical challenges to the process.  An effective coordination mechanism is required for PRSC \noperations  to  be  delivered  on  an  annual  basis.  Given the comprehensive nature of the PRSC \nreform process and the ever-growing number of cofinanciers, a unit responsible for coordination \nactivities is necessary. This unit would deal with the program agenda, including monitoring and \nreporting,  awareness  raising,  capacity  building,  and  reform  outcome  dissemination.  Another \nimportant  lesson  learned  from  implementing  previous  PRSCs  is  that  the  Government  is \nappreciative of the predictability of the financial assistance funds from various cofinanciers. The \ntiming of PRSC support is closely aligned with the Government\u2019s budget cycle. \n \n25. \nThe PRSCs complement, rather than replace, other initiatives of ADB, World Bank, and \nother  development  partners.  They  complement  other  analytical  studies,  policy  dialogue,  and \nprograms and projects, and vice versa.  ADB has confirmed its plan for continuing participation \nin the next 5-year PRSC cycle. The program loans to support PRSCs 6\u201310 are included in the \ncountry  strategy  and  program  for  2007\u20132010  (footnote  18).  The  coexistence  of  ADB  sector-\nspecific program loans and PRSCs is envisaged to leverage ADB\u2019s development efforts in Viet \nNam  with  other  stakeholders.  PRSC  operations  also  provide  a  complementary  forum  to  aid \nharmonization in the country\u2019s development agenda (Figure A2.2).  As a comprehensive reform \nprogram,  the  identification  and  sequencing of  a  comprehensive reform agenda for  the  PRSC \nrequires  strong  analytical  work.  In  October  2005,  a  workshop  on  stock  taking  of  the  PRSC \nprocess  was  organized  by  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  the  Government  to  identify  lessons  learned \nfor  improving  future  PRSC  operation.  The  upcoming  Vietnam  Development  Report  2007 will \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2001. Special Evaluation Study on Program Lending. Manila.  \n20 ADB. 2005.

Lessons confirm the importance of conducting joint analytical \nwork between development partners in a wide consultative manner.  \n \n \n \n26. \nLessons from the experience of previous program loans and postevaluation studies are \nthat  (i)  continued  government  ownership  and  commitment  are  fundamental  to  achieving \ndevelopment outcomes; (ii) monitoring and evaluation should be based on both process (inputs \nand outputs) and outcome indicators; (iii) outcome indicators will depend on successful follow-\non actions (as passage of a decree or law alone will not produce any meaningful results if the \nlaw  is  not  brought  into  effect  (requiring  regulations,  circulars,  etc.,)  with  proper enforcement \n(requiring  institutional  capabilities);  and  (iv)  sector  or  subsector-based  program  loans  have \nlimited scope to address economy-wide policy and institutional issues. \n \n\n4. \n\nJustification for the Poverty Reduction Support Credit 5 \n\nthe  business  environment,  (ii)  making  development  socially \n\n \n27. \nPRSC  5  addresses  three  key  areas  of  macro  policy  and  institutional  reforms  for  (i) \nsupporting  the  transition  to  a  market  economy  by  removing  structural  weaknesses  and \nimproving \ninclusive  and \nenvironment  friendly,  and  (iii)  modernizing  governance  and  the  public  administration  system. \nThe  46  policy  actions  identified in the  PRSC  5  policy matrix  are  built on  the  reform measures \nachieved under previous PRSCs (Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix A). The preparation \nof PRSC 5 was built on the strong ODA community\u2019s commitment to support Viet Nam\u2019s reform \nagenda through nationwide implementation of the CPRGS, and galvanize interest for the reform \nprogram among stakeholders. Increasingly development partners have united around the PRSC \nas  an  instrument  for  policy  dialogue.  They  have  been  actively  involved  in  supporting \nimplementation of the reform agenda, analytical work, technical assistance, project lending, and \nprogram lending or grant  support. The rationale for  providing financial  support  under  PRSC  5 \ncomes from the external financing needs to cover the cost of adjustments of the reforms. The \npolicy  actions  supported  by  the  PRSC  process  entail  a  substantial  additional  cost  to  the \nGovernment. Among these are recapitalization of SOCBs, operation of a safety net for workers \nwho become redundant as a result of SOE restructuring, expansion of budget appropriations for \nthe education sector, and creation of provincial health care funds for the poor.  \n \n28. \nJustification  for  PRSC  5  is  grounded  on  three  criteria:  (i)  prudent  macroeconomic \nmanagement to ensure that progress with the long-term reform agenda will not be undermined \nby  short-term  instability;  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  own  assessment  of  progress  accomplished  in \nCPRGS  implementation;  and  (iii)  the  reform  triggers  (measures  and  actions)  for  PRSC  5  that \nneed to be met, except for unforeseen circumstances.  \n \n29. \nIMF\u2019s  assessment  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  performance  confirms  the  country\u2019s  solid \nmacroeconomic performance in 2005, despite the adverse effects of droughts and the outbreak \nof  avian  influenza.  The  Government\u2019s  progress  report21  on  CPRGS  implementation  was \npresented  to  the  Consultative  Group  meeting  in  December  2005.  The  report  highlights  the \naccomplishments  in  reform  implementation  (e.g.,  opening  of  the  economy,  more  favorable \ninvestment  climate,  better  public  financial  management,  substantial  poverty  reduction,  and \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals), but it also points out bottlenecks in structural \n\n                                                 \n21  Government of Viet Nam. 2004. Progress Report of  the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. \n\nHanoi.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nreform  and  key  outstanding  social  issues  (e.g.,  growing  inequality,  poverty  among  ethnic \nminorities, rural\u2013urban migrants, and challenges in promoting good governance and combating \ncorruption).  The  joint  assessment  of  the  CPRGS  led  by  the  World  Bank  and  observations  by \nother  key  development  partners  acknowledges  the  frankness  in  reporting  and  notes  the \nchallenges.  The  assessment  indicates  that  the  progress  with  all  15  triggers  chosen  for  the \npreparation of PRSC 5 was satisfactory. These triggers were evenly distributed across all three \npillars of the reform program (Appendix 4).  \n \n\n5. \n\nRationale for the Proposed Program Loan \n\n \n30. \nThe  ODA  community  in  Viet  Nam  considers  the  PRSC  an  important  instrument  for \nsupporting  CPRGS  implementation.  As  a  multisector  instrument  covering  a  range  of  issues \nrelated  to  poverty  reduction,  the  PRSC  framework  provides  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  (i) \nadvance and widen national policy dialogue in a well-coordinated and comprehensive manner, \n(ii) provide lending and nonlending assistance in coordination with other ODA partners, and (iii) \nensure that key policy issues affecting ADB operations in Viet Nam are addressed in the policy \ndialogue between the Government and the ODA community to help achieve the common goal of \npoverty reduction and growth. \n \n31. \nIn  2006,  11  major  ODA  partners  plan  to  cofinance  PRSC  5  with  the  World  Bank \n(Appendix  5). All cofinanciers participated in  PRSC  5 preparation, and  are  actively  involved  in \npolicy areas where they are strong. Given the many active development partners in Viet Nam, \nseveral cofinanciers are involved in the same reform sec tors. However, certain cofinanciers may \nhave  more  comparative  advantage  in  a  subsector  than  others.  For  example,  for  the  financial \nsector,  while  the  World  Bank  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  specialize  in \nbanking  reforms,  ADB  specializes  in  nonbanking  reforms.  ADB  has  participated  in  policy \ndialogue related to many reform sectors in comparison to other development partners. PRSC 5, \nwhich has a national economy-wide reform agenda, complements these ADB-assisted activities \n(Appendix  2,  Figure  A2.2).  In  addition,  ADB  staff  have  actively  participated  in  PRSC  policy \ndialogue with other cofinanciers, thus ensuring synergy between  the PRSCs\u2019 multisector policy \nactions  and  ADB  sector-based  programs/projects.  This  allows  ADB  to  verify  that  PRSC  5 \nconditions  do  not  conflict  with  policy  conditions  under  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  sector  loans.  In  fact, \nADB\u2019s  participation  in  this  dialogue  enables  it  to  influence  the  reform  agenda  in  a  way  that \ncomplements ADB\u2019s ongoing sector loans, because the PRSC provides a clear picture of ADB\u2019s \nintervention as part of and in relation to the aggregated efforts of all  of Viet Nam\u2019s development \npartners.  \n \n32. \nThe proposed program is expected to lead to substantial improvements in development \noutcomes. The current PRSC cycle covers the same 5-year implementation period as that of the \nCPRGS. The targeted development outcomes under this PRSC cycle have been well attained \n(Appendix 6) as the PRSC process has been supported by a series of comprehensive analytical \nreports  covering  the three pillars of the CPRGS.  The  analytical  reports  have  helped  both  the \nGovernment  and  development  partners  strategically  identify  and  adjust  policy  actions  adopted \nunder  the  program.  Such major analytical reports are the  annual  VDRs,  which  provide  crucial \ninformation  and  analyses  on  focal  issues  relevant  to  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  VDR \n2004,  entitled  Poverty,  examined  issues  regarding  social  inclusion.  VDR  2005,  entitled \nGovernance,  focused  on  building  modern  institutions.  VDR  2006, entitled  Business, examined \nall types of businesses and structural reforms in the area of private sector development. And the \nforthcoming VDR 2007, entitled Aiming High, will include a review of the experience of the last 5 \nyears.  \n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nTo  reduce  transaction  costs  for  the  Government  and  the  participating  development \n33. \npartners in a rather complex operation, the proposed loan pursues a program-based approach. \nThis approach is in line with ADB\u2019s recent move and practices toward adopting program-based \nand  sector  approaches  in  its  lending  operations  to  reduce  transaction  costs  for  its  developing \nmember  countries  as  well  as  for  its  own  operations.  The  approach  is  not  only  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s reform agenda,22 Long-Term Strategic Framework,23 and Medium-Term Strategy II,24 but \nalso  will  directly  help  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  obligations  to  the  Rome  Declaration  on  harmonizing \nprocedures  of  multilateral  development  banks  (2003)  and  the  recent  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid \nEffectiveness (2005). \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM  \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\nthat \n\ntargets \n\nreduce  structural  weaknesses,  promote  socially \n\n34. \nThe program loan aims to provide support to Viet Nam\u2019s policy and institutional reforms \nto  maintain  high  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  The  outcomes  envisaged  include  numerous \ninclusive \ndevelopment \ndevelopment, and modernize governance and public administration (Appendix 1) by supporting \nthe  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Program  under  the  policy  framework  of  PRSC  5.  To \nreduce poverty and sustain rapid economic growth, the program loan will strengthen Viet Nam\u2019s \nreform program through 46 policy actions, of which 15 are a tranche release condition for the \nloan.  The  policy  matrix  is  presented  in  Appendix  4  and  the  development  policy  letter  in \nAppendix 7. Supplementary Appendix B provides detailed information demonstrating that all 46 \npolicy actions have already been complied with. The policy matrix comprises policy measures \nthat can be categorized into three reform pillars: \n \n\nPillar \nI:  Transition  to  market  economy.  Promote  growth  and  create \nemployment by increasing internal and external competition, improving efficiency \nand resource allocation in the economy,  strengthening the regulatory framework \nfor private sector development, and enhancing transparency and accountability in \nSOE operations and the financial sector; \nPillar  II:  Social  inclusion and  environmental  sustainability.  Advance human \ndevelopment  by  upgrading  the  quality  of  education  (especially  in  poor  zones); \npromoting  inclusive  education  for  children  with  disabilities;  improving access of \nthe  poor  to  health  services;  helping  secure  asset  ownership  through  the \nimplementation  of  the  new  Land  Law;  addressing  inequalities  in  health  and \neducation  outcomes  across  regions  and  population  groups;  and  encouraging \nimportant policy measures leading to more  sustainable  management  of  natural \nresources ; and \nPillar  III:  Modern  governance.  Increase  transparency  and  accountability  of \npublic  finances,  and  improve  legal  transparency  and  accessibility  by  promoting \ngreater  accountability  in  public  finance  and  public  administration  as  part  of  a \nbroader  effort  to  build  modern  governance;  improving  the  coordination  between \n5-year  plans  and  budget \nthe  Government\u2019s \ncomprehensive  and  ambitious  agenda  of  the  Legal  System  Development \nStrategy.  \n\nformulation;  and  supporting \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n22  President Chino\u2019s memo of 25 August 2004 entitled Today: Achieving Results Together.  \n23  ADB.  2001.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n35. \nThe program loan\u2019s outputs include (i) policy advisory services by all PRSC participants \nto  assist  the  Government  in  formulating  and  implementing  the  reform  policies;  (ii)  laws, \nregulations,  and  policies  that  are  conducive  to  reforms  under  the  program  framework;  (iii) \namendment  or  strengthening  of  laws,  regulations,  and  policies;  and  (iv)  action  plans  and \nstrategies that are strategically important  for attaining targeted development outcomes; and (v) \nself  assessments   and  sector  studies  that  are  of  strategic  importance.  These were achieved \nthrough 46 policy actions in the Program\u2019s policy matrix. The following paragraphs will elaborate \nin  detail  certain  outputs  achieved  under  the  reform  program  through  the  policy  actions \nconsidered strategic and critical under the program framework.  \n \n1. \n \n \n \n36. \nTrade Integration. The Law on Intellectual Property passed by the National Assembly is \nconsistent  with  requirements  of  WTO\u2019s  Trade-Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property.  A \nnumber of Viet Nam\u2019s trading partners have identified strengthening the protection of intellectual \nproperty as a key factor for enhancing trade and investment relations. Viet Nam states that it will \nbe in compliance with the agreement upon WTO accession. While the WTO requirements could \nhave been met  by  amending  existing  pieces  of  legislation,  this  approach  would  have  had  the \ndisadvantage  of  scattering  the  changes  over  many  legal  documents.  The  Government  is \ncurrently  taking  steps  to  remove  overlaps  between  the  responsibilities  of  different  agencies  in \norder  to  smooth  implementation  of  the  law  and  ensure  its  effective  enforcement.  It  has  also \neliminated quantitative restrictions on imports in accordance with WTO requirements. \n\nPillar I: Transition to a Market Economy  \n\n37. \nSOE  Reform.  Continuing SOE  reform  and  enhancing  SOE  operational  efficiency  are \nconsidered  priorities.  The  critical  policy  action  accomplished  under  the  Program  is  the \nrequirement for SOEs to be classified by performance according with Decision 271.25 Decision \n271  set  up  a  mechanism  to  monitor  SOE  performance  and  apply  sanctions  in  the  case  of \nconsistently poor performance. SOEs are to be classified into one of three groups (A, B, or C) \nbased  on  four  criteria:  turnover,  profitability,  solvency,  and  compliance  with  laws  and \nregulations. For the first three criteria, quantitative benchmarks are in place; SOEs with a strong \nperformance are classified as A whereas those with a weak performance are rated C. The four \ncriteria are combined  into  a  single  ranking.  Only  those  SOEs  with  a  strong  performance  in  all \nfour criteria are ranked as A, whereas weak performance on any single indicator leads to a C \nranking.  Enterprises  ranked  as  C  for  2  consecutive  years  are  in  principle  subject  to \nreorganization,  including changes in management. Until recently, few SOEs had complied with \nthe  reporting  requirements  under  Decision  271  and  government  agencies  in  charge  had not \nmade  serious  enforcement  efforts.  But  during  2005  and  early  2006,  the  Ministry of  Finance \n(MOF) compiled reports on the performance of most SOEs during 2004, and is now conducting \nan  in-depth  evaluation  of  the  reliability  of  the  reports.  Meanwhile,  an  application  of  the  three \nquantitative criteria of Decision 271 to individual SOE records from the enterprise census yields \na similar ranking. More SOEs are classified as B when using census data,  rather than Decision \n271.  But  few  large  SOEs  fall  in  the  C  category,  and  overall  solvency  appears  better  than  is \nusually  assumed,  in  spite  of  cautious  assumptions  regarding  the  valuation  of  assets.  While \nimplementation  of  Decision  271  needs  to  be  strengthened,  preliminary  results  for  2004  are \nencouraging. \n\n                                                 \n25 The Prime Minister issued Decision 271/2003/QD-TTg on 31 December  2003 with the main objection to set up a \nmechanism to monitor SOE performance and applying sanctions in the case of consistently poor performance.   \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nFinancial  Sector  Reform.  The  PRSC  includes  banking  reform  as  a  core  component. \n38. \nFollowing  the  announced  separation  of  SBV\u2019s  management  of  SOCBs  from  its  supervision \nfunction  during  the  previous  PRSC  operation,  a  comprehensive  road  map  for  banking  reform \nwas issued through the Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 112 of May 2006. The road map will lead to \nthe creation of a modern central bank focused on monetary policy, banking supervision, and the \nequitization  of  SOCBs  within  the  next  5  years.  The  reform  of  the  banking  system  entails \nfundamentally rewriting the laws on credit institutions and on SBV. The issuance of the revised \nlaws,  initially  planned  for  2010,  has  been  brought  forward  to  2008  or  earlier.  The  modernized \nSBV will be  charged  with  executing  monetary  policy  and  supervising  the  banking  system.  At \npresent, SBV is responsible for exercising  the  ownership  rights  of  the  state  in  the  SOCBs,  a \nfunction  that  conflicts  with  its  role  as  supervisor  of  the  same  banks.  Under  the  proposed \nchanges  to  the  legal  framework,  SBV\u2019s  ownership  role  is  to  be  eliminated.  Its  supervision \nfunctions  will  be  separated  from  its  management  functions  in  relation  to  SOCBs,  and  SOCB \noperation on a commercial basis will be ensured.  \n\n39. \nThe  reform  program  will  include  a  transformation  of  central  bank  governance  to  clarify \nand  enhance  management  and  accountability  structures.  The  strengthening  of  banking \nsupervision  is  expected  to  happen  in  two  phases.  In  the  first,  SBV\u2019s  banking  supervision \ndepartment will be upgraded. The focus of its activities will mainly be on banks as they are likely \nto remain dominant players in the financial sector in the medium term. In the second and longer \nterm  phase,  an  independent  financial  supervision  board  will  be  established.  SBV has already \nstarted  to  upgrade  its  supervision  functions.  In  October  2005,  it  initiated  an  assessment  of  its \nsupervision  practices  against  international  standards,  the  Basel  Core  Principles.  The  first  draft \nassessment was prepared and presented in a consultative workshop held in Hanoi in May 2006. \nThe  assessment  report  analyzes  current  status  and  weaknesses  pertaining to  the  institutional \nframework  of  the  supervisory  agency,  the  legal  framework,  supervision  methodology, \nsupervision  procedures,  and  prudential  regulations;  and  makes  recommendations  to  address \nthe weaknesses.  SBV reviewed the draft assessment and incorporated the suggested revisions \nto  the  first  draft.  The  assessment  report, including a comprehensive supervision development \nplan, was revised and finalized in June 2006.  The pace of reform will be tailored to the human \nresource capacities within SBV and the SOCBs. As the envisaged changes are fundamental in \nnature, they will need to be accompanied by an equally major development of human resources \nand a realignment of the incentives structure to the objectives of the institutions. \n\n40. \nThe  organizational  and  financial  restructuring  of  SOCBs  to  support  their  commercial \norientation  is  to  happen  alongside  the  opening  up  of  their  capital.  All  SOCBs  are  due  to be \nequitized  by  2010.  The  process  is  already  under  way  for  two  of  them. Vietcombank has sold \nconvertible bonds worth D1.36 trillion to boost its capital before equitization. Share sales are to \ntake place through auction at the securities exchange and will begin toward the end of 2006 or \nin  early  2007.  Mekong  Housing  Bank  will  be  equitized  with  the  participation  of  strategic \ninvestors. The state\u2019s shareholding in these two banks is to be gradually reduced to no less than \n70%  by  end-2006  and  eventually  to  51%  by  2010.  Under  current  regulations,  total  foreign \nholding  of  shares  will  be  limited  to  30%  with  a  single  institutional  investor  allowed  to  hold  a \nmaximum of 10%. But these limits, especially the latter is likely to be revised upward in line with \nWTO commitments.  The  valuation  of  both  banks  is  to  be  conducted  through  reputed  external \nadvisers  selected  through  a  competitive  process.  The  external  advisers  will  also  help  in \nselecting strategic investors. \n\nThe Program also supports the development of a well-balanced financial sector. In this \n41. \nregard, development of the securities market is essential to provide long-term capital in support \nof economic growth. The Law on Securities, approved by the National Assembly  in June 2006, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nprovides  a  comprehensive  framework  for  the  operation  and  development  of  the  securities \nmarket. It also provides a legal base for investor protection and market transparency, including \na  disclosure-based  approach.  Initial  emphasis  is  placed  on  disclosure  promptness  and  the \nquality  of  information  being  disclosed  and  available  to  public  investors.  The  disclosure-based \napproach  also  permits  a  free  market  to  function  within  limits  established  to  provide  a  fair \nmarketplace. Strong inspection, fact-finding, and enforcement powers are provided to the State \nSecurities  Commission  under  the  draft  law.  These  powers  are  essential  to  provide  the  tools \nrequired to oversee a market adequately and to protect public investors. Also related to investor \nprotection  is  the  issue  of  insider  trading,  which  is  clearly  defined  and  prohibited.  In  addition  to \nthe  improvement  of  the  legal  framework  for the securities market, the PRSC supports greater \nparticipation of foreign investors in the capital market. The  Prime Minister issued Decision 238, \nin  September  2005,  increasing  the  limit  of  foreign  holding  of  shares  in  local  listed companies \nfrom  30%  to  49%.  This  will  foster  demand  for  securities,  especially  from  foreign  investment \nfunds, thereby contributing to market stability.  \n \n42. \nPrivate  Sector  Development.  Improving  the  business  environment  for  the  private \nsector  presents  the  most  remarkable  and  persistent  achievement  of  Viet  Nam over the last  5 \nyears.  The new  unified  Enterprise Law  provides  for  equal  treatment  of  firms,  regardless  of \nownership.  Under  the  law,  approved  in  December  2005  and  effective  from  1  July  2006, \ndomestic  and  foreign  enterprises  are  governed  by  the  same  corporate  legislation.  Foreign \nenterprises are subject to the same registration procedures as domestic firms, and  are able to \nchoose the form of corporate entity that is most suitable to their business operations. At present, \nthey  are  only  allowed  to  operate  as  limited  liability  companies.  Foreign  enterprises  will  be \nallowed to restructure, expand, or diversify their business rather than be limited to the specific \nlines  in  which  their  business  was  initially  registered.  Alongside  the  Enterprise  Law,  the  new \nInvestment Law introduces a common investment regime for domestic and foreign investors. It \nopens the possibility of foreign investment into a wider range of sectors, and makes Viet Nam\u2019s \ninvestment policies consistent with current and prospective international commitments. \n\n43. \nThe  Enterprise  Law  also  requires  that  all  SOEs  be  transformed  into  limited  liability \ncompanies  or  joint  stock  companies  within  4  years.  Under  these  corporate  forms,  SOEs will \nmove  under  the  corporate  governance  models  of  the  new  law  alongside  private  enterprises, \nrather than be governed by a separate law as at present. The law also provides for principles to \nguide  the  exercise  of  ownership  rights  by  the  state.  These should provide significantly greater \nautonomy  to  the  transformed  enterprises  in  defining  their  business  strategies,  and  making \ninvestment  and  personnel-related  decisions.  At  present, business decisions are often directed \nby line ministries or provinces, often in inconsistent ways. \n\n44. \nSeven decrees are currently being drafted to provide guidelines for implementing the two \nlaws. The content of these decrees will greatly shape the investment climate in Viet Nam. For \nthe Enterprise Law, these include regulations governing business registration, licensing regime, \nreregistration  of  foreign  invested  enterprises,  as  well  as  SOE  transformation.  Under  the \nInvestment  Law,  one  of  the  decrees  being  drafted  governs  build-operate-transfer  projects, \nconsidered  crucial  for  attracting  private  participation  in  the  infrastructure  sector.  The \nGovernment has followed a consultative drafting process for these decrees involving domestic \nand foreign businesses, as well as development partners. \n\nPillar II: Social Inclusion and Environmental Sustainability \n\n2. \n \n45. \nEducation.  Regulations  for  inclusive  education  for  children  living  with  disabilities  have \nbeen  issued  to  ensure  equal  access  to  education  services.  The  regulations  apply  to  all \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\neducational institutions in the public education system. The preparation of these regulations is \nthe  result  of  effective  coordination  among  ministries  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Education  and \nTraining  (MOET);  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH);  and  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social \nAffairs; and agencies dealing with child protection. The regulations address the special needs of \nchildren  living  with  disabilities  in  terms  of  classrooms,  school  facilities,  equipment,  and \ntextbooks.  Individual  education  plans  will  be  prepared  with  materials  and  methodological \ndesigns tailored to their special requirements. The regulations allow for educational institutions \nto  hire  specialized  staff  and  helpers,  and  entitle  them  to  make  investments  in  facilities  and \nequipment  that  meet  the  special  needs  of  children  living  with disabilities.  Inclusive education \nstaff will be entitled to training and refresher courses and to reduced norms for teaching hours. \nEarly  intervention  is  promoted  by  the  regulations  to  minimize  disability-caused  constraints. \nPeople  living  with  disabilities  will  also  be  given  priority  in  entrance  exams  for  vocational \nsecondary schools and institutions providing continuing and higher education services. \n\n46. \nA sustained effort is under way to raise the quality of primary schools nationwide, with an \nemphasis on schools in poorer areas. A baseline assessment of compliance with  fundamental \nschool quality level (FSQL) standards nationwide was compiled at the end of the 2004 school \nyear. The annual audit conducted  1 year later assessed progress. The comparison, finalized  at \nthe  end  of  2005,  showed  that  the  average  FSQL  ratio,  across  all  the  quality  indicators \nconsidered, increased from 62.1 to 66.1, out of a maximum of 100. This represents an annual \n6.4% increase in the average FSQL index. A subsequent analysis, combining  the results of the \nFSQL audits with a poverty map, shows that gains are more important in poorer districts.  \n\n47. \nA larger, increasingly diversified and decentralized education system has made sector \ngovernance, planning, and budgeting more complex. The ongoing work on the education sector \nmedium-term  expenditure  framework  and  provincial  planning  is  aimed  at  rationalizing  the \nplanning  and  budgeting  processes .  These  tools  reinforce  the  roles  of  different  stakeholders  in \nsector  governance:  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  for  the  provision  of  a  clear \neconomic  framework  for  planning;  MOF  for  integrating  planning  and  deployment  of  resources, \nand  balancing  sectoral  spending;  MOET  for  sector  stewardship  in  setting  and  guaranteeing \nservice  quality,  and  helping  provinces  achieve  national  objectives;  and  the  provinces  for \nintegrating  investment  and  recurrent  funding  for  school  system  operations,  and  being \naccountable for sector output and outcomes. \n\n48. \nHealth. The financing of health care for the poor and near  poor has been considerably \nstrengthened.  Politburo  Resolution  46  of  February  2005  urged  the  Government  to  finance \ncurative care for the poor, children under the age of 6, and other social policy beneficiaries, as a \nfirst step in upgrading health care and to advance toward universal health insurance by 2010. \nThese  aspects  of  the  resolution  were  operationalized  by  Decree  63  on  health  insurance,  in \neffect from 1 July 2005.26 The decree represents a key step in shifting from the direct funding of \nhealth  care  providers  to  demand-side funding.  It  mandates  compulsory  health  insurance  for \nseveral  groups,  including  workers  on  fixed-term  contracts of  3  months and  more, pensioners, \nchildren under the age of  6,  and  beneficiaries  under  Decision  139  on  the  provision of health \ncare to the poor. Decision 139 replaced  Health services can be received from public or private \nproviders  as  long  as  they  are  contracted  by  Viet  Nam Social  Insurance.  Compulsory health \ninsurance  holders  will  be  entitled  to  both  in-patient  and  out-patient  services.  Transportation \n                                                 \n26  The  Government\u2019s  issuance  of  Decree  63  dated  16  May  2005  has  adopted  a  regime  of  compulsory  health \ninsurance for the poor. Compulsory health insurance\u2019s coverage expanded to cover more citizens, and supported \nby  increased  budget  allocation.  The  existing  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  139/2002/QD-TTg  on  the  health  care \nsystem  for  the  poor  was  proposed  to  be  revised  in  order  to  extend  the  coverage  to  the  poor  based  on  the  new \npoverty line as well as include provisions to protect the near-poor and all ethnic minorities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\ncosts  will  be  covered  in  case  of  referrals  for  the  poor  and  those  in  remote  areas.  Voluntary \nhealth insurance is available to all, including those under compulsory health insurance who wish \nto obtain higher coverage.  Viet Nam Social  Insurance is in charge of the implementation of the \nhealth  insurance  policy.  MOH  will  issue  technical  standards  against  which  Viet  Nam Social \nInsurance  will  assess  and  contract  providers.  MOH  and  MOF  will  provide  guidance  on  the \nmanagement  of  insurance  funds.  MOH  will  deal  with  complaints  relating  to  health  care,  while \nMOF will deal with complaints on fund management. \n\nDecision 139 is being revised to expand the number of households eligible  for benefits. \n49. \nThe  new,  substantially  higher  poverty  line  will  be  employed  to  define  poor  households.  Such \nhouseholds will be entitled to compulsory  health insurance with a premium of  D60,000 provided \nby  the  state  budget.  Near-poor households with an income of  up to  1.5  times  the  poverty  line \nwill  be  provided  a  subsidy  to  enroll  in  the  voluntary  health  insurance  scheme.  In  addition  to \nthese budgetary outlays, provincial  health care funds for the poor  will support treatment costs \nnot covered by compulsory  health insurance, up to a maximum of  D10 million per hospital stay. \nFor the near poor, these funds will provide support to cover catastrophic illnesses. \n\n50. \nSocial Protection. The Program for Socio-economic Development in Communes faced \nwith Extreme Difficulties, or so-called Program 135 was revised to more effectively support the \ndevelopment of communes facing extreme hardship in ethnic minority and mountainous areas.27  \nProgram 135 is one of the  national targeted programs (NTPs) that Viet Nam employs to ensure \nthat  national  goals  are  met  in  the  context  of  increasing  decentralization.  Under  Program  135, \ncommunes receive a resource allocation that is most often used to develop local infrastructure, \nsuch as roads, irrigation systems, schools, and health centers. Seven years of implementation \nhave resulted in successes and shortcomings. The revision of the program design, components, \nand procedures builds on the success and addresses the shortcomings. The main objective of \nProgram 135  is  to  eliminate  food  poverty  and  achieve  a  poverty  rate  of  less  than  30% in the \nselected  communes  by  2010,  thereby  also  reducing  the  widening  poverty  gap  between  ethnic \nminorities living in remote areas and the rest of the country. In its second phase, Program 135 is \nbetter  targeted.  In  the  past,  only  the  poorest  communes  were  targeted,  but  now  the  aim  is  to \nreach  the  poorest  and  most  remote  villages  within  the  poorest  and  less  poor  communes.  This \nshould  also  help  in  reaching  a  higher  proportion  of  remote  ethnic  minority  communities.  The \nbudget  allocation  for  agriculture  and  forestry  extension  and  support  has  been  considerably \nincreased,  from  around  3\u20134%  to  around  20%.  This  reflects  the  recognition  that  infrastructure \ninvestments alone  are  not  enough  to  reduce  poverty  among  ethnic  minorities  and  that  greater \neffort  is  needed  to  improve  their  livelihood  opportunities.  The  allocation  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure was increased to about 10%. This will reduce the burden of local \ncontributions borne by already poor communes. The revised  Program 135 will devolve greater \ncontrol  over  investment  decisions  to  communes  and  villages,  with  measures  to  increase \nparticipation and capacity in scheme selection, technical design, and construction supervision. \nIncreased  effort  will  be  devoted  to  promoting  public  access  to  information  as  a  key  tool  in \nachieving greater transparency and accountability. \n\n51. \nLand  and  Forest.  Land  registration  offices  have  been  set  up  in  nearly  all  provinces  in \ncompliance with the 2003 Land Law. A major shortcoming of land management in Viet Nam has \nbeen  the  lack  of  an  effective  land  registration  system.  The  law  requires  that  provincial  land \n                                                 \n27 Program 135, approved in July 1998, is implemented by the Committee for Ethnic Minorities. Several old existing \nprograms  with  broadly  similar  objectives  were  merged  into  Program  135  by  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision \n135/2000/QD-TTg.  These  included  the  infrastructure  components  of  the  fixed  cultivation  and  fixed  settlement \nprograms,  the  commune  cluster  program,  and  the  program  for  training  of  cadres  in  remote  and  ethnic  minority \nareas. \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nregistration offices be set up, and if deemed necessary on the basis of demand, district  offices \nas  well.  By  April  2006,  land  registration  offices  had  been  set  up  in  62  of  64  provinces,  and  in \n20% of the  high-demand  districts.  Fifty  of  the  62  offices  have  received  land  records  that  were \npreviously maintained by the  departments of  natural  resources and the  environment, and the \nprocess  of  transferring  the  records  is  to  be  completed  by  June  2006.  Land  registration  offices \nare responsible for registering all land transactions, managing land files, and carrying out land-\nrelated  administrative  formalities.  Decree 181 empowers the offices to  provide  information on \nland to any land user to promote transparency in land transactions. \n\n52.  Water.  The  second  NTP  (NTP  II)  on  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  (2006\u20132010) \nhas  been  submitted  for  approval,  assigning  clearer  responsibilities  for  its  implementation. \nPerhaps the only Millennium Development Goal where Viet Nam has not advanced well relates \nto  rural  water  and  sanitation,  with  weaker  progress  on  the  sanitation  front.  A  recent  joint \ngovernment-development  partner  review  pointed  to  fragmentation  and  lack  of  coordination \nbetween  different  ministries  involved  in  the  sector.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment (MARD) will perform the state management functions and be the main agency  in \ncharge  of  coordinating,  monitoring,  and  supervising  NTP  II  implementation.  Within  MARD,  the \nDepartment  of  Water  Resources  will  take  the  lead.  MOH  will  produce  guidelines  for  the \nprovision of clean water, construction of household sanitation facilities, and personal hygiene. It \nwill also be in charge of monitoring water quality in rural areas. MOET will monitor water supply, \nsanitation, and hygiene in schools. The Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment will \nbe  responsible  for  addressing  issues  related  to  the  pollution  of  water  resources,  including  in \ncraft  villages.  NTP  II  improves  upon  the  earlier  program  by  strengthening  community \nparticipation  and  upgrading  the  mechanisms  for  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Specific indicators \nhave  been  defined  and  responsibilities  allocated  for  commune,  district,  provincial, and central \ncollection and management of information. NTP  II also seeks to accelerate the decentralization \nprocess  to  ensure  a  more  active  role  for  provinces  in  planning,  implementation,  and \nmanagement of water supply and sanitation facilities. In addition, NTP II recognizes the weaker \nachievement on sanitation, and proposes both technological solutions as well as an enhanced \nrole for households and communities in the provision of sanitation facilities. \n\n53. \nEnvironment.  Economic  tools  for  environmental  protection  have  been  developed  and \nstrategic environmental assessments piloted. The Law on Environmental Protection took  effect \nfrom  1  July  2006.  The law  (i)  includes  provisions  for  adoption  of  polluter-pay  measures, for \ninstance,  for  waste  discharge  into  water  bodies, and  the  disposal  of  hazardous  wastes;  (ii) \nforesees payments for natural resources use and rehabilitation, and  reliance on environmental \nprotection funds; (iii) improves the requirements for environmental impact assessments; and (iv) \nintroduces  a  requirement  for  strategic  environmental  assessments  (SEAs)  of  sectoral  and \nregional development plans.  \n\nThe first decree to guide the implementation of the environmental protection law focuses \n54. \non  the  application  of  national  environmental  standards,  responsibilities  for  hazardous  waste \nmanagement, and procedures for  environmental impact assessment and SEA application. The \nMinistry  of  Natural  Resources  and  the  Environment  has  also  developed  regulations  to \nimplement Decree 67 on Environmental Protection Charges for Wastewater,28 which will enable \nimproved  control  of  water  pollution.  The draft  circular  on  Wastewater  Pollution  Coefficients, \nidentifying  the  volume  of  pollutants  in  industrial  wastewater  as  a  basis  for  fees  to  be  levied \nunder Decree 67, was submitted in August 2006.  \n\n                                                 \n28 This refers to Decree 67/2003/ND-CP. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nThe  Government  has  adopted  provisions  for  undertaking  SEAs  to  improve  the \n55. \nintegration of measures for environmental protection into strategies, plans, and programs. They \nrepresent  an  important  step  for  Viet  Nam,  at  a  stage  of  rapid  economic growth and massive \npublic  investment  in  infrastructure, when  large cumulative impacts  in  the  regions and  on the \nlandscape  can be expected.  Two SEA pilots were carried out on  socioeconomic development \nplans,  one  for  Ha  Tay  province  and  the  other  for  Dai  Tu  district,  to  promote  sustainable \ndevelopment  and  management  of  the  Tam  Dao  National  Park  and  its  buffer  zone.  Two \nadditional SEA pilots are under way, one for the Vung Tau port development plan and the other \nfor Electricity Viet Nam\u2019s hydropower master plan, focusing on biodiversity impacts and program \nlevel mitigation. \n\n3. \n\nPillar III: Modern Governance  \n\n \n \n56. \nPlanning Process. The Government issued its SEDP 2006\u20132010 with a poverty focus, \nand is developing a mechanism to monitor its implementation. The SEDP was built on extensive \nconsultations not only within government but also with a broad range of stakeholders (including \nmass  organizations,  academics,  private  sector,  civil  society,  and  development  partners).  The \nNational Assembly discussed the  draft SEDP  in its November 2005 session  and  adopted  it  in \nJune  2006.  The  SEDP  received  the  endorsement  of  the  Party  Congress  in  April  2006.  The \ndocument  represents  considerable  progress  in  developing  an  outcome-focused,  medium-term \nplan that combines the twin objectives of  economic growth and social inclusion, and describes \nthe reforms that will ensure sustainability in the long  term.  Importantly, the document explicitly \nrecognizes the institutional and regulatory challenges associated with completing the transition \nto a market economy.  It describes a large number of planned legislative actions that, together \nwith  the  reform  agenda  implied  in  the  accession  to  WTO,  will  strongly  support  this  transition. \nThe SEDP should thus serve as a framework to allocate public resources over the medium term \nand as a mechanism to align  development  partner  support  to  national  priorities.  A monitoring \nand evaluation system for SEDP implementation is being finalized.  \n\n57. \nPublic Financial Management. The circular guiding the preparation of the 2006 budget \ntook  an  important  step  toward  preparing  the  government  budget  within  a  medium-term \nframework.  While  the  submission  and  approval  of  the  budget  by  the  National  Assembly  will \ncontinue to be done on an annual basis, line ministries and provincial governments were asked \nto  prepare  a  budget  framework  for  2006\u20132010,  based  on  the  SEDP.  The  5-year  framework \nshould be conducive to better integration  of  the  capital  and  recurrent  budgets.  It  should also \nhelp ministries and provinces prepare more realistic plans, better prioritize their spending, and \nimprove overall efficiency of public expenditures. The draft circular for the 2007 budget includes \ninstructions to line ministries and provinces to align budget submissions to the SEDP over the \nnext 3 years. \n\nThe  Government  issued  new  regulations  to  strengthen  the  delivery  of  public  services \n58. \nthrough improved monitoring, introduction of user feedback, and limits on salary expenditure. By \nallowing public service delivery units to charge fees, the earlier Decree 10 29 introduced powerful \nincentives  to  improve  quality.  However  the  provision  of  basic  services  to  be  provided  free  of \ncharge,  or  at  low  prices  established  by  government  regulations,  appear  to  have suffered as a \nresult  of  such  incentives.  Moreover,  many  service  delivery  units face limited  local  competition. \nBecause  Decree  10  allowed  considerable  flexibility  to  use  revenue  from  fees  to  pay  higher \nsalaries,  it  provided  an  incentive  to  charge  excessively  high  prices  for  services.  The  new \n\n                                                 \n29  By  allowing  service  delivery  units  to  charge  fees,  Decree  10/2002/ND-CP  had  introduced  powerful  incentives  to \n\nimprove quality while substantially increasing the resources available to such units . \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nregulation, Decree 43,30 requires that service delivery units set aside 25% of their net revenues \nto improve service quality, thereby limiting the amount available for salary increments. Decree \n43  also  includes  salary  caps  that  are  inversely  related  to  the  amount  of  financial  support \nreceived from the government budget. The decree requires that performance standards be set \nfor service delivery units under guidelines provided by the responsible line ministry. The criteria \nto evaluate service delivery units will include workload, service quality, time taken to provide the \nservice, and compliance with relevant regulations. Monitoring and evaluation is to be conducted \nby  the  line  ministries  and  by  relevant  state  inspection  and  audit  agencies.  The  decree also \nintroduces mechanisms for eliciting feedback from service users that go beyond \u201cmailboxes\u201d31 to \npotentially include instruments such as \u201ccitizens\u2019 report card\u201d surveys. \n\n59. \nLegal Development. The Politburo has approved strategies for strengthening the legal \nand  judiciary  systems.  Both  strategies  have  been  made  public  and  shared  widely.  The  Legal \nSystem Development Strategy is a broad-ranging document that seeks to build legal institutions \nand  systems  that  will  ensure  the  rule  of  law.  The  Strategy  is  a  comprehensive  roadmap  to \nrenovate  the  country\u2019s  legal  system  to  build  the  rule  of  law  and  support  the  transition  to  a \nmarket-oriented  economy  and  rapid  international  integration.  An  important  complement  to  it  is \nthe  Judicial  Reform  Strategy  to  2020,  which  seeks  to  improve  criminal  and  civil  policy  and \nlegislation  in  line  with  the  transition  to  a  market  economy.  It  aims  to  reduce prison sentences \nconsidered excessively high, as well as increase the use of financial penalties and noncustodial \nmeasures rather than imprisonment. The categories of officials who have the authority to make \ndecisions on the application of detention measures will be narrowed. The court system will be \nreorganized to make courts jurisdiction-based rather than their existing geographic affiliations. \n\nPublic Administration. Several ministries and provinces are implementing action plans \n60. \nto  simplify  and  increase  transparency  of  administrative  procedures.  The  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nDirective  09  instructs  ministries,  government  agencies,  and  provinces  to  conduct  a  review  of \nexisting procedures with a view to  reducing bureaucracy and red tape.  By  the end of 2005, 17 \nministries,  five  government  agencies,  and  26  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  had  submitted \naction plans to implement new, simplified administrative procedures. Progress has been made \nin  areas  such  as   birth,  death,  and  marriage  records;  notary  services;  residential  registration \npermits; business registration and related licenses; land-use right certificates; and customs and \ntax  procedures.  In  the  case  of  business  registration,  investment  licenses,  and  construction \npermits, processing times have generally come down to 7\u201310 days and even 3\u20135 days in some \ncases. \n\nAnticorruption. A law on corruption prevention and control was passed by the National \n61. \nAssembly  in  November  2005,  and  will  take  effect  in  June  2006.  In  February  2006  the  Prime \nMinister  issued  an  action  plan  delineating  the  roles  of  various  ministries  and  agencies  in \nensuring effective implementation of the Anticorruption Law. The law was drafted in parallel with \npreparation  of  the  first  comprehensive  diagnostic  study  on  corruption  in  Viet  Nam.  It  includes \nchapters  on  corruption  prevention  and  detection,  handling  of  corruption,  organizations  and \nmechanisms for investigation, prosecution and judicial agencies in anticorruption, role of society \nand  media  in  anticorruption,  international  cooperation  in  anticorruption,  and  implementation \nprovisions.  The  law  is  thus  more  comprehensive  than  typical  anticorruption  legislation.  This \ncomprehensiveness also translates into implementation challenges.  \n\n                                                 \n30  The  Government issued  Decree  43/2006/N\u00d0-CP  on  25  April  2006  on  the  autonomy  of  public  service  delivery \n\nentities in organizational arrangement, human resources and finance (replacing Decree 10/2002/ND-CP). \n\n31 Each public service delivery unit posts a mailbox that accepts notes from service users who voluntarily comment or \n\ncomplain about the quality of the services.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nThe main initiatives  introduced  for  fighting  and  controlling  corruption  include  increased \n62. \npublic  disclosure  and  transparency  in  areas  such  as  public  procurement,  civil  works, \nmanagement  and  equitization  of  SOEs,  auditing of the state budget, management and use of \nland,  and  personnel  management.  The  law  specifies  the  contents  and  modalities  of  such \ndisclosure.  It  also  provides  individuals  with  the  right  to  request  information  from  specified \nbodies,  such  as  people\u2019s  committees.  The  law  strengthens  the  accountability  of  heads  of \norganizations  and  agencies  by  specifying  that  they  are  responsible  for  corruption  occurring \ninside the entities under their management and authority. Greater simplification of administrative \nprocedures, including increased reliance on electronic interfaces,  is another tool for preventing \ncorruption.  The  Government  will  also  specify  and  regulate  transactions  that  must  be  settled \nthrough the banking system. The law encourages exposure of corruption by the public and other \nagencies, and the rewarding of such actions. \n\n63. \nA key provision of the law relates to the compulsory declaration of assets and income  of \nstate employees. The broader definition of the \u201cdeclarer\u201d, so as to include \u201cspouses and children \nin the same residential certificate\u201d, is commendable. A separate decree will be prepared by the \nGovernment  Inspectorate  to  guide  implementation  of  this  provision.  Widespread application of \nasset declaration in the initial period could risk overwhelming the capacity of inspectors, thereby \ndiluting  its  efficacy.  To  ensure  its  effectiveness  a  phased  approach  could  be  employed,  for \ninstance, by piloting asset declaration in the most corruption-prone agencies or for high-ranking \npublic officials. The Ministry of Home Affairs, in coordination with MOF and SBV, is to prepare a \nplan for monitoring incomes of high-ranking officials or those holding a position of power.  \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n64. \nBased  on  the  mission\u2019s  initial  assessment,  the  SIPRP  III  is  categorized  as  C  under \nADB\u2019s  environment  classification  system.  An  environmental  assessment  of  the  potential \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  the  policy  matrix  of  the  SIPRP  III  is  available  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  C.  The  assessment  reveals  that  many  policy  actions  will  produce \npositive impacts on urban and rural environments. Some policy actions will likely  not have any \nimpact  on  the  environment.  A  few  policy  actions  that  promote  WTO  accession  have  unknown \nimpact.  The  assessment  offers  some  recommendations  on  environmental  enhancements  for \nfuture policy dialogue in subsequent program loans supporting PRSCs 6\u201310. \n \n65. \nThe  SIPRP  III  will  not  have  any  impact  on  involuntary  resettlement  impact  or  on \nindigenous people  as  it has no investment component.  None  of  the  policy actions associated \nwith  this  Program  will  trigger  any  activities  related  to  indigenous  people  during  the \nimplementation  period.  Activities  that  may  have  any  adverse  impact  on  indigenous peoples or \ninvolve involuntary resettlement may occur in the future under a separate government-initiated \nprogram  financed  by  other  development  partners.  Adequate  assessment  and  mitigation \nmeasures providing safeguards to indigenous people and resettlement will be carried out under \nthat  separate  program.  However,  as  the  SIPRP  III  paves  the  way  for  the  next  5-year cycle of \nPRSCs,  in  support  of  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010,  it has flagged potential risk  for  income  disparity \nbetween  urban  and  rural  as  well  as  Kinh  majority  and  ethnic  minorities.  Such  disparity could \nincrease over the medium to long term as Viet Nam strives to become a middle-income country. \nThe  Government  is  aware  of  this  potential  risk  and  commits  to  formulate  and  implement \npreventive and mitigation measures. This potential risk is not foreseen to noticeably occur and \ndamage  Viet  Nam\u2019s  track  record  on  this  front  during  the  short  span  of  this  Program\u2019s \nimplementation.  A  social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  was  undertaken  in  relation  to  the \nSIPRP  III  (a summary is in Appendix  8  and  additional  details  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D). \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\nThe  assessment  concludes  that  the  activities  will  have  no  adverse  impacts  on  indigenous \npeople or have gender implications.   \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n66. \nA  total  of  more  than  US$210  million  is  expected  to  be  funded  for  PRSC  5  operation \nthrough  ODA  resources.  The  World  Bank  has  already  approved  a  US$100  million  credit  from \nthe  International  Development  Association  to  support  PRSC  5.  Cofinanciers  providing \nconcessional  loans  include  ADB  (US$15  million),  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation \n(amount  to  be  determined), and  Germany  (\u20ac6 million).  Cofinanciers  providing  grants  include \nAgencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional (\u20ac3 million), Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment  (A$10  million  [to  be  confirmed]),  Canadian  International  Development  Agency \nInternational  Development  Agency  (DKr61  million),  European \n(Can$4  million),  Danish \nCommission  (\u20ac10  million), \nIreland  (\u20ac3  million),  Netherlands  Ministry  of  Development \nCooperation  (\u20ac9  million\u2013\u20ac14  million),  and  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International \nDevelopment  (\u00a320  million).  Swiss  Development  Cooperation,  while  not  cofinancing,  provided \nfinancial support for the coordination of the process. \n\n \n67. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  US$15  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources as ADB\u2019s support to  CPRGS implementation following the policy framework of PRSC \n5.  The  program  loan  would  contribute  to  financing  the  cost  of  adjustment  resulting  from \nimplementation of the policy matrix, particularly the prior actions for  PRSC 5, and to supporting \nand  facilitating  the  Government\u2019s  continued  and  deepened  reform  program  for  poverty \nreduction. The loan will be disbursed upon declaration of loan effectiveness. \n \n68. \nThe loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  The loan proceeds may be used to finance \neligible imports incurred within 180 days prior to the date of loan effectiveness. The loan closing \ndate will be 31 December 2007. \n \n69. \nSome of the reforms supported by PRSC 5 entail substantial cost to the budget.  Policy \nmeasures  supported  by  the  PRSC  operations,  such  as  the  safety  net  for  redundant  SOE \nworkers, recapitalization of SOCBs, provincial health care for the poor, and increased education \nbudget allocation, require additional spending. These are costly and specific to the PRSCs. The \ncost of adjustment of the PRSC is therefore greater than the cost of these clearly PRSC-specific \nitems, which is estimated at US$400 million per year on average during the past 4 years. The \nestimated cost of some specific PRSC-related  programs  for  the  2006  budget  is  approximately \nUS$601  million,  i.e.,  (i)  health  funds  for  the  poor\u2014about  US$44  million  due  to  expanded \ncoverage  of  beneficiaries  according  to  the  new  poverty  definition;  (ii)  increased  spending  on \neducation proportional to the Government budget\u2014about  US$184 million; and (iii) social safety \nnet program for retrenched SOE workers\u2014about US$219 million; and (iv) maintenance cost of \ntransport infrastructure\u2014about US$154 million.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\nSBV, as the Executing Agency, will  be responsible for overall program implementation, \n70. \nincluding  administration  and  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  maintenance  of  accounts,  and \npreparation of semiannual progress reports on program implementation. The Program is being \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nimplemented through 24 line ministries and government agencies in accordance with the Loan \nAgreement.  While  the  ODA  funds  raised  through  the  PRSC  process  provide  resources  to  the \nstate budget to implement the reforms, the PRSC operations have also served as an effective \ncoordination device between the Government and the many development partners. On behalf of \nthe  Government,  SBV  coordinated  the  overall  processing  of  PRSC  5.  The  World  Bank \ncoordinated  the  process  for the development partners. The  number of cofinanciers has been \ncontinuously increasing\u2014from four in the case of PRSC 1 approved in 2002, to 11 for PRSC 5. \nThe  development  partners  have  participated  in  the  PRSC  process  by  forming working groups \nwith the Government, which cover all economic policy areas.  Staff of ADB\u2019s Viet Nam Resident \nMission  are  actively  participating  in  several  other  working  groups  including  Partnership  to \nSupport  National  Target  Program,  Viet  Nam  Business  Forum,  People\u2019s  Participation  Working \nGroup,  SME  (Small-  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise) Development,  and  Public  Administrative \nReform  Partnership.  Given  the  comprehensive  nature  of  the  PRSC  reform  process  and  the \never-growing  number  of  cofinanciers,  in  January  2005  SBV  established  the  Program \nCoordination  Unit  comprising  competent  staff.  The  unit  deals  with  the  program  agenda, \nincluding  monitoring  and  reporting,  awareness  raising,  capacity  building, and reform outcome \ndissemination. It has frequently interacted with the World Bank and the cofinanciers of  PRSC 5, \nincluding ADB. \n \n71. \nThe  National  Steering  Committee  for  implementation  of  the  CPRGS  and  PRSCs  is \nheaded  by  a  deputy  prime  minister,  and  consists  of  representatives  from  24  relevant  line \nministries  and  government  agencies.  SBV  is  assigned  as  the  agency  responsible,  in  close \ncollaboration with the World Bank, for preparation and implementation of  the PRSCs. A  deputy \ngovernor  of  SBV  acts  as  standing  vice  chairperson  of  the  steering  committee.  This  quasi-\nadvisory  body  has  several  representatives  from  key  ministries,  such  as  MARD;  MOET;  MOF; \nMinistry  of  Justice  (MOJ),  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social  Affairs (MOLISA);  Ministry of \nTrade (MOT); Office of the Government; Party's Economic Commission; SBV; etc., representing \nthe policy reform areas under  the PRSCs. An interministerial working group and a secretariat to \nimplement  and  monitor  the  CPRGS  and  PRSCs  are functional at  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nInvestment.  The \nfrom \nabovementioned key ministries, representing the policy reform areas under  the PRSCs. Among \nthe goals of the interministerial working group is subnational implementation of the CPRGS and \nPRSCs. The CPRGS Secretariat at the Ministry of Planning and Investment supports provincial \ngovernments in adapting the CPRGS to their own context, and reformulating plans and budgets \naccordingly.  \n \n\ninterministerial  working  group  consists  of  representatives  also \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe program period will be from 30 June 2006 to 31 December 2007. \n\n72. \n \n\n3. \n\nDisbursement and Procurement  \n\n73. \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche, contingent upon loan effectiveness. The \nloan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  for  a  broad  range  of  imports,  subject  to  a  negative  list  of \nineligible  items  (Appendix  9).  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loan,32  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan \n\n                                                 \n32 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila \n\n\f \n\n23 \n\nwill  be  disbursed  to  Viet  Nam  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired, if during each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Viet \nNam\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of \nthe loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation under existing \nprocedures  will  be  required.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  to \nverify the accuracy of the Borrower's certification. As such, the procedures for procurement and \ndisbursement of funds, and the use of counterpart funds are felt to be satisfactory. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Accountability and Fiduciary Assessment \n\nVarious  measures  have  been  taken  to  ensure  that  the  overall  fiduciary  policies  and \n74. \ninstitutions  are  adequate  to  proceed  with  support  from  the  proposed  program  lending.  The \nanalytical underpinnings for the operation are largely complete: (i) the cross-cutting assessment \nof  the  country\u2019s  development  policies  (social,  structural,  and  sectoral)  covering  the  policy \nreforms and institutional development priorities for sustainable growth and poverty reduction has \nbeen discussed with the Government in a number of recent joint reports; and (ii) an assessment \nof  the  country\u2019s  financial  accountability  arrangements  has  been  made  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nfollowing assessments: Public Expenditure Review-Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA), \nCountry  Financial  Accountability  Assessment,  and  Country  Procurement  Assessment  Review. \nThe recent integrated PER-IFA, published in May 2005, reviewed the accounting and reporting \nprocesses  in  the  public  sector,  the  oversight  functions  in  the  public  sector,  and  financial \nreporting and auditing in SOEs. The fiduciary risks of the current public financial management \nbudgeting,  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing  systems  of  government  are  assessed  as \nmoderate. The PER-IFA identifies areas for continued improvement. Key areas to be addressed \ninclude  unifying  budget  classification  and  accounting  to  ensure  effective  and  consistent \nbudgeting, accounting and reporting across all sectors of government; streamlining the internal \nframework  and  public  expenditure  accounting  processes,  strengthening  asset \ncontrol \nmanagement,  establishing  public  sector  accounting  standards  in  line  with  international \nstandards,  improving  financial  management  reporting  and  use  of  reporting  for  management \ncontrol,  establishing  an  effective  internal  audit  review  function  as  part  of  the  internal  control \nregime, and strengthening the effectiveness of the State Audit of Viet Nam. The implementation \nof the PER-IFA recommendations is being supported by the PRSC program and grant funds.  \n \n75. \nThe  PER-IFA  also  recognizes  the  recent  changes  to  improve  transparency  and \naccountability.  Among  the  most  recent  are  the  audit  and  anticorruption  laws  passed  by  the \nNational  Assembly  in  2005.  The  Audit  Law  significantly  enhances  oversight  by  the  National \nAssembly and the provincial people\u2019s councils over public finances, and increases public access \nto  information  on  government  finances. The  Anticorruption  Law reflects strong commitment to \nimprove  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  in  using  budgetary  funds,  including  ODA.  The  World \nBank  is  preparing  the  Treasury  and  Budget  Management  Information  System  (TABMIS)  for \nimplementation during 2008\u20132009. This will improve public financial management and assist in \nestablishing an integrated financial management system in Viet Nam.  \n\n76. \nThe  Government  has  consistently  improved  the  transparency  of  public procurement. \nNationwide  open  competitive  bidding  in  public  procurement  was  introduced  in  1996.  This \nsystem  was  improved  in  1999,  with  the  introduction  of  the  concept  of  the  \u201cresponsive  lowest \nevaluated  bid.\u201d  Decree  66/2003/CP  of  June  2003,  adopted  under  PRSC  3,  established  a \ndepartment  of  public  procurement  and  strengthened  the  procurement  process  by  mandating \nstandard bidding documents and publication of bidding opportunities in the Public Procurement \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nBulletin. The standard bidding documents for procurement of goods, issued in September 2005, \nwill  promote  consistency  in  the  application  of  procurement  regulations.  In  April  2005,  the \nGovernment also  initiated the paper version of  the  Public Procurement Bulletin, which is now \nproposed to be upgraded to a  procurement newspaper, and an e-procurement bulletin/website \nhas  been  established.  The  Government  has  substantially  unified  and  elevated the legislative \nframework  for  public  procurement  by  passing  a  new  Bidding  Law  instead  of  the  originally \nexpected  procurement  ordinance.  A  decree  for  implementing  the  new  law  is  at  an  advanced \nstage  of  preparation  and  is  planned  to  be  issued  shortly.  The  Bidding  Law,  which  became \neffective on  1  April  2006,  retains  the  improvements  of  earlier  decrees  and  introduces  some \nimprovements,  most  notably  the  establishment  of  a  complaint  handling  mechanism,  albeit  not \nyet  fully  independent;  provisions  against  conflicts  of  interest; clearer remedies for dealing with \nfraud  and  corruption;  and  removing  the  previous  requirement  for  mandatory  joint  ventures \nbetween  foreign  and  local  firms  bidding  on  public  contracts.  However  restricting  the  use  of \nlesser competitive methods such as direct contracting and limited bidding will be important, as \nwell using merit point systems in the evaluation of bids for goods and works. Another area to be \naddressed is the  prevention  of  collusive  practices  in  public  procurement,  particularly  common \nplace at the local level. \n\n77. \nSince IMF does not currently have a program in Viet Nam, its assessment of the control \nenvironment of  SBV  is  not  available.  However,  the  enactment  of  the  Audit  Law  of  2005  will \nassist  in  addressing  issues  related  to  audit  and  accounting  arrangements.  The  Audit  Law \nestablished the State Audit of Viet Nam as an independent institution reporting to the National \nAssembly with the  auditor  general  being  appointed  and  dismissed  by  the  National  Assembly. \nAudit reports will be made public. SBV will be subject to annual auditing and disclosure of the \naudit reports. \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  Government  will  prepare  and  provide  progress  reports  on  the  program  loan.  ADB \n78. \nwill  participate  in  all  joint  assessments  by  the  Government  and  development  partners  on  the \noutcomes  of  PRSC  5  and  PRSC  5  triggers  (measures  and  actions).  Further  details  are \npresented the program framework in Appendix 1. \n \n\n6. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n79. \nViet  Nam  continues  to  make  good  use  of  information  and  analysis  in  its  policy  making \nand development of individual components of the PRSC program. PRSC 5 continues to build on \nthis  experience,  streamlining  the  numerous  ongoing  monitoring  and  evaluation  initiatives. Key \nsources  of  monitoring  information  for  poverty  and  program  outcomes  include  the  proposed \nbiannual  household  living  standard  survey,  periodic  participatory  poverty  assessments,  small \nbusiness registration survey, public expenditure tracking  survey, as well as quarterly progress \nreports from the relevant sector ministries and committees implementing the reform program.  \n \n80. \nEfforts for national and provincial implementation of the CPRGS rely on the development \nof  appropriate  monitoring  indicators.  Gradually,  the  number  of  indicators  for  monitoring  the \nCPRGS,  including  monitoring  development  outcomes  for  Viet  Nam  development  goals,  has \nbeen narrowed to around 140, of which  40 can be selected by the provinces. These narrower \nindicators  were  merged  with  285  indicators  of  the  national statistical system collected by  the \nGeneral Statistics Office, which are partly generated by the household living standard surveys. \nThe recent survey in 2004 by the General Statistics Office is a source of information for many \nindicators  in  the  system.  However,  despite  the  efforts  to  refine  the  indicator  system,  the  line \n\n\f \n\n25 \n\nministries  have  not  agreed  to  about  47  indicators,  and  16  are  considered  unknown  by  the \nGeneral Statistics Office.33 Indicators to monitor the coming SEDP have been in the process of \nbeing  identified.  For  monitoring  arrangements,  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme are doing some joint work on strengthening the monitoring system for \nthe CPRGS and SEDP, which will give definite results to monitor outcomes of the PRSCs.  \n \n\nIV.    PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nThe SIPRP  III will benefit the  Vietnamese people and businesses on three fronts. First, \n81. \nthrough policy actions designed to facilitate Viet Nam\u2019s transition to a market economy, the loan \nwill increase efficiency, accelerate economic growth, and create jobs. These policy actions will \nhelp  improve  the  regulatory  framework  for  private  sector  development,  and  enhance \ntransparency  and  accountability  in  SOE  operations  and  in  banking.  Second,  through  policy \nactions  addressing  social  inclusion  and  environmental  sustainability,  the  benefits  include \nimproved quality of education (especially in poor areas),  improving access of the poor to health \nservices, and helping secure asset ownership through the implementation of the Land Law, and \nmore  sustainable  management  of  natural  resources  including  through  strategic  environment \nassessments.  Third,  through  policy  actions  addressing  modern  governance,  the  benefits  are \nincreased transparency and accountability of public finances, and improved legal transparency \nand accessibility. These will be achieved through, among others,  better coordination plans and \nbudgets,  adoption  of  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework,  and  greater  accountability  in \npublic finance and public administration.  \n \n82. \nThree potential risks  are  associated with the  proposed  loan: containment of contingent \nliability,  social  inclusion  and  environmental  sustainability,  and  a  fiduciary  risk  related to public \nfinancial management. First, benefits from WTO accession will accrue if complementary reforms \ntake place in areas such as trade logistics, infrastructure and financial services, taxes, and the \ninvestment climate. Second, disparities between urban and rural areas, and between the Kinh \nmajority  and  ethnic  minorities,  could  widen.  Inequality  could  increase  and  new  forms  of  urban \npoverty  could  emerge.  Reaching  the  latest  group  of  out-of-school  children  is  proving  difficult. \nHealth care remains underfunded. The incentives given to service providers to charge fees have \nnot been matched by sufficient accountability on the delivery of basic services. And increasingly \nsophisticated  environmental  legislation  still  needs  to  translate  into  effective  tools  for  natural \nresource  management  and  pollution  control.  Third,  in  a  rapidly  growing  economy  the \nopportunities  for  graft  could  outpace  improvements  in  anticorruption  policies  for  some  time. \nWhile  progress  on  enhancing  budget  transparency  has  been  considerable,  the  emerging \ninstitutional  architecture  for  managing  and  investing  state  capital  faces  governance  risks. \nFurther,  rapidly  emerging  and  fast-growing provincial investment funds could contribute to the \ndevelopment of local infrastructure, but their transparency and accountability are still matters of \nconcern.  While the  Government  is  working  toward  effective  anticorruption  measures,  a  rapid \ngrowing  economy  and  the  opportunities  for  graft  could  outpace  improvements  and  efforts  in \nanticorruption policies. \n \n83. \nThrough appropriate measures and proactive programs during  program implementation, \nthe  Government  will  introduce  risk-mitigating  measures.  ADB  along  with  other  PRSC \ncofinanciers have provided technical assistance and conducted analytical studies to  help policy \nmakers  formulate  and  execute  mitigating  and  corrective  measures  in  anticipation  of  these \n\n                                                 \n33  ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of Viet Nam for  Results-Based Monitoring of Poverty \nReduction  and  Growth.  Manila  (TA  4612-VIE).  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  has  been \nimplementing a US$1.6-million project for strengthening capacity of the statistical system. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\npotential  risks.  The  risk  related  to  growing  contingent  liabilities  could  be  addressed  by \nenhancing \nloans,  and \nthe  credibility  of  government  policies  regarding  nonperforming \nstrengthening the commercial orientation and autonomy of SOCBs with decisive policy actions. \nThrough the PRSC process, the Government  has already decided to adopt the classification of \nloans  based  on  international  accounting  standards.  In  addition,  the  Government  has \ncontinuously  strengthened  macroeconomic  management.  The  second  risk  related  to  social \ninclusion and environmental sustainability could be  mitigated by the strong commitment of the \nGovernment  to  keep  growth  inclusive  and  sustainable.  This  risk  could  be  addressed  through \nimprovements  in  data  availability  and  analytical  work  on  issues  arising  from  rural-urban \ndisparities  included  as  part  of  the  PRSC  process.  Regarding  environmental sustainability, the \ncountry environmental assessment and PRSC policy actions on land, water, and environmental \nprotection  should  help  mitigate  risks.  Finally,  the  fiduciary  risk  related  to  public  financial \nmanagement caused by uncontrollable corruption could be addressed by initiatives that provide \neffective  counter  mechanisms. A comprehensive diagnostic of corruption and its modality  was \nfinalized  and  publicly  disclosed  in  December  2005.  The  Anticorruption  Law,  passed  by  the \nNational Assembly in November 2005, has introduced stronger accountability requirements for \nheads  of  agencies,  monitoring  of  assets  of  senior  government  officials  and  their  families,  and \nintroduction of a more effective mechanism for exposing corruption. The Government has also \nencouraged the media to apply a more proactive approach in detecting and reporting corruption. \n \n\nV.    ASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  SBV  have  given  the \n\n84. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSuch  measures  and  actions  will  continue  to  be  in  effect  for  the  sustainability  of \nthe poverty reduction program under the CPRGS and PRSC frameworks . \nAdequate and timely counterpart funds will be provided for the implementation of \nthe poverty reduction program under PRSC 5. \n\n \n\nVI.

Unlike previous planning documents, the CPRGS is focused and clearly \ndefines  development  targets,  identifies  appropriate  policies  to  attain  those  targets,  and  aligns \nresources to those policies. The country\u2019s development goals, which are a local version of the \nMillennium Development Goals, are among the key targets pursued in the CPRGS (Table A2). \nIn  2003,  the  CPRGS  was  expanded,  with  a  thorough  discussion  of  the  role  of  large \ninfrastructure  in  promoting  economic  and  social  development.  The  formulation  of  the  CPRGS \nwas  coordinated  by  the  CPRGS  Secretariat  based  in  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment \nand  supported  by  several  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  partners,  including  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n \n2. \nThe CPRGS provides a framework for poverty reduction policies, programs, and actions \nin  Viet  Nam  (Figure  A2.1).  The  ODA  community  has  adopted  the  CPRGS  as  the  reference \ndocument for planning and formulating external assistance.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\nTable A2.1: The

The PRSC policy actions are aimed at identifying a coherent sequence of key measures \nin  each  area  over  the  medium  term.  Identification  of  the  policy  actions  needed  to  attain  the \ndevelopment outcomes documented in the CPRGS has been strongly influenced by the CPRSG \nprogress reports, and analytical work carried out by the development partners in recent years. \nThe  annual  Viet  Nam  Development  Reports  have  played  a  very  important  role  in  this  respect. \nThese reports are prepared in partnership by the World Bank and other  development partners, \nincluding  ADB.  In  addition  to,  the  CPRGS/PRSC-related  studies  and  reports,  sector  work \nreports  and  assessments  done  under  sector-based  programs/projects  of  each  development \npartner  also  provide  input  to  ensure  the  complementarity  and  efficiency  of  the  PRSC  reform \nagenda. Figure A2.2 illustrates the timing and relation of the strategy, implementation, analyses, \nand sector work.   \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing \n\n \n4. \nThe  ODA  community  in  Viet  Nam  considers  the  PRSC  an  important  instrument  for \nsupporting  CPRGS  implementation.  In  addition  to  ADB,  other  major  ODA  partners  intend  to \ncontribute both financial and intellectual resources to PRSC 5 with the World Bank in 2006. The \nODA  partners  include  Australia,  Canada, Denmark, European Commission,  Germany, Ireland, \nJapan, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom. Switzerland, while not a cofinancier, partially \nfunds the  PRSC  Program  Coordination  Unit,  which  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  PRSC \nprocess between government agencies and development partners. The International Monetary \nFund  (IMF),  France,  and  United  Nations  Development  Programme  also  participate  in  policy \ndialogue to provide intellectual contributions to the PRSC process.   \n \n\n4. \n\nProgress with Implementation \n\n \n5. \nThe CPRGS, though approved by the Prime Minister, was formulated on the margins of \nmainstream  planning  processes  and  coexisted  with  the  5-year  SEDP  2001\u20132005, which was \ndiscussed by the Party Congress and approved by the National Assembly. But the process of \nformulating, implementing, and monitoring the outcomes of the CPRGS has initiated permanent \nchanges in the approaches to socioeconomic planning. In late 2004 the Government decided to \ndraft  SEDP  2006\u20132010  according  to  the  same  principles  that  governed  preparation  of  the \nCPRGS,  and  during  the  last  year  has  made  concerted  efforts  to  reform  the  planning  process \nand  incorporate  these  principles.  ADB  and  other  development  partners  expect  to  use  SEDP \n2006\u20132010  as  a  basis  for  their  development  assistance. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \n2007\u20132010 for Viet Nam was formulated in close alignment with the new SEDP.  \n \n6. \nImplementation  of  the  ambitious  reform  agenda  articulated  in  the  CPRGS  and  other \ngovernment strategies and plans has been supported through four PRSC operations so far. The \nfocus  of  PRSC  1  was  mainly  on  the  structural  reform  agenda,  with  policies  articulated  around \nfive main areas: liberalizing trade, reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs), strengthening the \nbanking  subsector,  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector,  and  improving \nmanagement  and  transparency  of  public  finances.  Under  PRSC  2,  the  range  of  economic \nreforms supported by  the  international  community  was  considerably  broadened.  In addition to \nthe  mainly  structural  reforms  covered  by  PRSC  1,  PRSC  2  included  various  policy  actions \naimed at keeping development inclusive and building modern governance. Measures related to \nthe  education  and   health   sectors,  environmental   sustainability,   land   management,  legal  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\n \n\nFigure A2.2 Timing and Relation of the Strategy,  \nImplementation, Analysis, and Sector Work \n\nGovernment \nStrategy \n\nSEDP \n(2001\u2013\n2005) \n\nCPRGS \n(2002\u2013\n2006) \n\nExpanded \nCPRGS \n(2002\u20132006) \n\nIntegration of \nCPRGS in to the  \nSEDP \n\nPreparation and  \nAdoption of SEDP \n(2006-2010) \n\nBudget Cycle \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\nImplementation \n \nGovernment  \nand development partners  \nNumber of cofinanciers  \n(including  the  World  Bank \nand ADB) \n\n \n\n \n \nPRSC 1 \n\n5 \nNo ADB \ncofinancing \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPRSC 2 \n\n \nPRSC 3 \n\n \nPRSC 4 \n\n \nPRSC 5 \n\n4 \nNo ADB \ncofinancing \n\n8 \nincluding ADB \n\n11 \nincluding ADB \n\n12 \nincluding ADB \n\n \n \nGovernment \n\nAnalysis \n\n \nCPRGS \nProgress \nReport \n\n \nCPRGS \nProgress Report \n\n \nCPRGS \nProgress \nReport \n\n \nVDR 2004: \nPoverty \n\n \nVDR 2005: \nGovernance \n\n \nVDR 2006: \nBusiness \n\n \nCPRGS \nProgress \nReport \n \n \nVDR 2007: \nAiming High \n\n \nVDR 2003: \nDelivering \nOn Its \nPromises  \n\nADB Sector Programs/Projects  \n2001:  Red  River  Basin  Sector;  Third  Provincial  Towns  Water  Supply;  Central  Region  Livelihood  Im provement; \nProvincial Road Improvement \n2002:  Financial  Sector  Development  II;  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Tourism  Development;  Agriculture  Sector \nDevelopment; Upper Second Education Development; and Housing Finance \n2003:  Public  Administration  Reform;  Phuoc  Hoa  Water  Resources;  and  Central  Region  Urban  Environment \nImprovement. \n2004:  Health Care in  the  Central  Highland;  Small and  Medium Sized  Enterprise  Development  Program ; Second \nLower Secondary Education Development; Financial Sector Development II; Support to Implementation of Poverty \nReduction Program; and Northern Power Transmission \n2005:  Preventive  Health  System  Support;  Central  Region  Transport  Network;  Northern  Power  Transmission \nExpansion;  Support  the Implementation of  the  Poverty  Reduction  Program  II;  Central Region Water Resources; \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  Kunming\u2013Haiphong  Transport  Corridor:  Noi  Bai\u2013Lao  Cai  Expressway  Technical \nAssistance \n2006:  Support  the  Implementation  of  the  Poverty  Reduction  Program   III;  Small  and  Medium  Sized  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Program  loan  II;  First  Song  Da,  Mong  Duong  Thermal  Power  Generation;  Forests  for  Livelihood \nImprovem ent in Central Highland; Agriculture Science and Technology; HIV/AIDS Prevention among Youth; Central \nRegion  Small-  and  Medium -Sized  Town  Development;  Upper  Secondary  and  Professional  Technology \nDevelopment; Song Bung 4 Hydropower \n \nOngoing Projects  (%) \n \n\nAgriculture = 18.0 \nEducation = 10.2 \nEnergy = 21.3 \nFinancial = 6.9 \nHealth = 5.6 \nIndustry and nonfuel mineral = 3.1 \nMultisector = 6.3 \nTransport and communications = 20.9 \nWater supply = 7.7 \n(as of 30 July 2006) \n \n\nCPRGS = Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy; GMS = Greater Mekong Subregion;  HIV/AIDS = \nhuman  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome;  PRSC  =  Poverty  Reduction  Support Credit; \nSEDP = Socioeconomic Development Plan; VDR = Vietnam Development Report. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \ndevelopment,  and  public  financial  management,  were  all  part  of  PRSC  2.  PRSC  3  and  4 \nbroadened  sectoral  coverage  from  PRSC  2  (Supplementary  Appendix  D  provides  detailed \npolicy actions undertaken in PRSCs 1\u20135). \n \n7. \nIn  addition  to  providing  resources  to  the  budget,  PRSC  operations  have  served  as  an \neffective  coordination  device,  supported  by  an  increasingly  large  number  of  development \npartners. The National Steering Committee for the PRSCs is led by the deputy prime minister in \ncharge  of  economic  reforms,  and  brings  together  representatives  from  more  than  20  line \nministries  and  government  agencies.  On  the  development  partners\u2019  side,  PRSC  operations \nhave  been  cofinanced  by  several  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies,  either  through  grants  or \nparallel  lending.  More importantly, the process saw a transition in the role of cofinanciers, from \nproviders  of  finance  to  partners  substantially  engaged  in  the  preparation  of  operations  and \npolicy  dialogue  with  government.  This  dialogue  is  organized  by  policy  areas,  in  which \ndevelopment partners engage selectively, based on their interests and technical capacity on the \nground. The number of development partners participating in this process has increased from 4 \nin PRSC 1 to  7  in PRSC 3 to  9  in PRSC 4 and possibly  to 11  in  PRSC 5.  All  development \npartners  who  seriously  consider  the  possibility  of  partnering  in  this  process  are  invited  to \nparticipate in the preparation of PRSC operations, even if they cannot commit to cofinance them \nin  the  short  term.  Nineteen  have  actively  contributed  to  preparation  of  PRSC  5.  The  PRSC \ngroup dominates the landscape of development assistance in Viet Nam.  \n \n8. \nThe  implementation  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  ambitious  reform  agenda  was  initially supported by \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  through  a  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility \n(PRGF)  credit  approved  at  the  same  time  as  PRSC  1.  However,  disbursements  were \nsuspended at the end of 2002 due to a disagreement between IMF and  the Government on the \nauditing of the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam.1  The  credit  expired  in  April  2004.  IMF  has  remained \nengaged in several policy areas, especially in the monitoring of macroeconomic policies. In the \nabsence  of  an  active  PRGF,  IMF  has  provided  an  assessment  of  the  macroeconomic \nframework as part of the preparation of each of the PRSC operations. \n \n\n \n\nToward PRSCs 6 to 10 \n\nB. \n \n9. \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 could be used as the document of reference for the implementation of \neconomic reforms and alignment of  development  partner support over the next  5  years. The \nadoption of the CPRGS principles in the preparation of the new SEDP signals a departure from \nthe  traditional  command  and  control  approach.  Broad-based  consultation,  a  strong  poverty \nfocus,  identification  of  the  most  appropriate  policies  to  attain  the  chosen  development \nobjectives, and application of a monitoring and evaluation framework make use of a government \nplanning document as the next poverty reduction strategy possible. Viet Nam would be one of \nthe  first  countries  to  make  this  move.  SEDP  2006\u20132010  was  approved  by  the  National \nAssembly  in  June  2006.  The  Joint  Staff  Advisory  Note  for  the  latest  CPRGS  annual  progress \nreport notes that staff of the  World Bank and IMF are supportive of government efforts to bring \nthese  positive  reforms  to  the  planning  process.  This  advisory  note  is  to  be  presented  to  the \nBoard at the same time as the current credit. The staff will also submit SEDP 2006\u20132010 to the \nboards of  the World Bank\u2019s  International  Development  Association  and  IMF  for  discussion  as \n\n                                                 \n1   Under the PRSC operations, efforts have been made to ensure that the State Bank of Viet Nam and all government \nagencies are annually and satisfactorily audited. The agency responsible for such auditing is the State Audit of Viet \nNam, which was made independent as a result of PRSC policy. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n41 \n\nViet Nam\u2019s next poverty reduction strategy following National  Assembly\u2019s approval of the SEDP \nin June 2006.  \n \n10. \nBecause of its broad coverage of policy areas and the multiplicity of decisions reflected \nin it, SEDP 2006\u20132010 needs to be translated into a workable action plan. This requires clearly \nassessing the level expected for key development outcomes in each of the policy areas, as of \n2011. It also requires that the key policy actions needed to attain those outcomes be identified, \nand their budgetary implications evaluated. Prioritization and sequencing will be essential in this \nrespect.  For  instance,  the  latest  version  of  the  SEDP  includes  three  main  pillars:  economic, \nsocial,  and  environmental;  but  the  cross-cutting  reforms  assoc iated  with  modern  governance \nare  somewhat  subsumed  in  each  of  these  pillars,  and  need  to  be  given  clear  prominence. \nWithout those cross-cutting reforms, progress in each of the three pillars is bound to be partial. \nFinally, the most appropriate indicators need to be selected from the monitoring and evaluation \nframework and possibly from the broader statistical system as well, in order to assess progress \nwith reform agenda implementation.  \n \nThe  translation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  into  a  workable  action  plan  should  serve  as  the \n11. \nbasis for discussion of the next PRSC cycle and its contents with the  Government. Indeed, the \nSEDP  will  only  be  approved  by  the  time  this  proposed  credit  is  negotiated.  And  even  then,  a \nconsiderable amount of analytical work will be needed to derive a broad policy matrix in each of \nthe main policy areas.  The translation of the SEDP into an outline of PRSCs 6\u201310 will be jointly \ndone  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  development  partners cofinancing  the  PRSCs  during  the \nsecond half of 2006.  Progress in improving development outcomes will be assessed to identify \nareas lagging. The major annual analytical report, Vietnam Development Report 2007 (prepared \nin partnership with PRSC cofinanciers, including ADB, with substantive inputs from Vietnamese \npolicy  makers  and  academics),  will  attempt  to  translate  the  new  SEDP,  which  is  also  the \nnational poverty reduction and growth strategy into concrete, properly sequenced policy actions \nfor  the  subsequent  5-year  cycle  of  the  PRSC.  This  exercise  will  be  conducted  in  close \ncollaboration with policy makers and academic researchers, and the outcome will be brought to \nthe  Consultative  Group  meeting  at  end-2006.  Agreement  on  the  possible  contents  of  the \nproposed  PRSCs  6\u201310  will  then  play  a  similar  role  to  that  of  assessing  triggers  under  the \ncurrent PRSC cycle. After PRSC 6, however, annual triggers may be used as the instrument of \nchoice to determine activities for the next operation. \n \n12. \nThe  design  of  the  next  cycle  of  PRSCs  will  also  be  informed  by  an  evaluation  of  the \ncurrent PRSC cycle. This evaluation is expected to be conducted by an independent party, and \nwill seek views from government as well as from all development partners involved in the PRSC \nprocess.  A  similar  evaluation  covering  the  previous  PRSCs  was  completed  in  2005  with \ndevelopment  partner  funding.  That  study  employed  the  standard  evaluation  criteria  of  the \nDevelopment  Assistance  Committee  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment:  relevance,  effectiveness,  efficiency,  impacts,  and  sustainability.  The  proposed \nevaluation could employ a similar methodology to update the findings of the previous study and \ncover the entire cycle from PRSC 1 to 5.   \n \n13.  While the contents of the next cycle of PRSCs have not yet been prepared, the benefits \nand risks identified for the current operation provide some guidance. In relation to the transition \nto  a  market  economy,  the  focus  should  be  on  implementation.  Viet  Nam  has  made  a  large \nnumber  of  commitments  in  the  context  of  World  Trade  Organization accession, and  needs to \nfollow  them  through.  Implementing  the  ambitious  banking  reform  road  map  will  be  an  equally \nimportant challenge. The announced transformation of the Development Assistance Fund into a \ndevelopment  bank  will  need  to  be  closely  monitored.  As  for  state-owned  enterprises,  the \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nestablishment of  the  State  Corporation  of  Investment  Capital  opens  the  prospect  of  a  more \nefficient and transparent management of state assets, with a clear separation of ownership and \nregulation  functions,  and  reliance  on  credible  performance  indicators  to  allocate  capital. \nHowever,  the  large  economic  groups  being  created  are  bound  to  be  powerful  global  players, \nand  achieving  an  unambiguous  delimitation  of  responsibilities  and  liabilities  between  these \ngroups and the Government is bound to be challenging. Meanwhile, the enormous infrastructure \nneeds  of  the  coming  period  call  for  effective  regulation  of  access  to  networks  and  pricing  of \nservices. Strong incentives for private participation and transparent regulation will be needed. \n \n14. \nOn the social front, enabling ethnic minorities to  move out of poverty will remain one of \nthe  most  important  objectives. Issues related to urban migration and the consequences of the \nregistration  system  in  relation  to  access  to  services  are  bound  to  become  increasingly \nimportant. In parallel, the foundations for more modern social protection systems will need to be \nbuilt,  combining  the  coverage  of  universal  programs  with  reliance  on  strong  economic \nincentives.  The  model  being  adopted  for  the  health  sector  is   promising  in  this  respect,  as  it \ninvolves  various  access  modalities  to  the  same  services,  from  compulsory  but  not  subsidized \ncoverage for the formal sector, to compulsory but fully subsidized for the poor, to voluntary for \nthe  rest  of  the  population,  with  partial  subsidies  for  the  near  poor.  A  similar  model  could  be \nadopted  in  relation  to  old-age,  survivor,  and  disability  pensions.  The  passage  of  the  first-ever \nlaw on  social  insurance  in  2006  offers  an  opportunity  to  establish  a  system  that  is  financially \nviable  and  does  not  distort  incentives.  But  implementing  and  designing  such  a  system will be \nchallenging.  Preventing  the  degradation  of  natural  resources  and  increasing  the  efficiency  of \ntools for pollution control will be the main challenge in relation to the environmental pillar. \n \nFinally,  the  governance  area  will  be  central  in  the  next  PRSC  cycle.  The  relationship \n15. \nbetween  planning  and  budgets  will  have  to  be  strengthened,  and  modernization  of  the \nmanagement  of  public  revenues  and  public  expenditures  completed.  Work against corruption \nwill involve better and more accountable systems to manage state assets, especially in relation \nto capital investments and land conversion. A reliable  system to monitor progress, building on \nthe  strengths  of  the  first  diagnostic  study  while  extending  its  coverage,  could  be  set  up. \nStreamlined  administrative  procedures,  increased  reliance  on  e-government,  and  more \ntransparent public procurement are bound to feature prominently in the next PRSC cycle. Some \nof the most difficult  challenges may be associated with judiciary reform, especially in relation to \nthe reorganization of courts by jurisdiction and the revamping of processes to enhance access. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n43 \n\nVIETNAM \u2013 IMF STAFF ASSESSMENT OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  \n\nContact Person: Carol Baker (cbaker@imf.org, 202-623-4041)  \n\nMacroeconomic performance and policy  \n\nOverall macroeconomic performance was strong in 2005 and has remained broadly \n\n1. \nfavorable so far in 2006. Real GDP growth picked up to 8.4 percent in 2005, led by strong \nconsumption and investment. Non-oil import growth slowed significantly and the resulting \nimprovement in the current account, together with strong ODA and FDI, helped increase gross \nofficial reserves by more than US$2.2 billion in 2005. While imports have rebounded somewhat \nin recent months, on the strength of robust exports, reserves have increased by another US$2.3 \nbillion in the first five months of 2006. The recently-approved Socioeconomic Development Plan \n(SEDP) for 2006\u201310 targets growth of 7\u00bd\u20138 percent, to be spurred by a sustained increase in \ninvestment, which would rise from 35\u00bd percent of GDP in 2005 to 40 percent of GDP by 2010. \nWhile rising FDI is envisioned to contribute to the achievement of these objectives, the \ngovernment and State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) would continue to account for about half of \nnew investment.  \n \n2. \n Inflation has shown some signs of moderation in recent months. The year-on-year \n(yoy) rate of inflation edged down from 8.7 percent in December 2005 to 7\u00bd percent in July. \nHowever, inflation has remained well above the rates prevailing in Vietnam\u2019s major trading \npartners and care needs to be taken to ensure that inflationary expectations do not become \nentrenched. The effects of the pass-through of the April and August hikes in domestic petroleum \nprices are likely to be compounded by necessary adjustments in key administered prices (e.g., \npower tariffs, cement and steel prices), and by a further large increase in public sector wages \nscheduled for October.  \n \n3. \nmonths of 2006, after having depreciated by less than 1 percent in 2005. No pre-announced \nmaximum depreciation has been set for 2006 (as against a limit of 1 percent in 2005). Vietnam\u2019s \ninflation differential relative to trading partners, together with movements in major currencies, \nhas resulted in significant fluctuations in the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the dong. \nThe REER appreciated by about 13 percent in 2005, but this appreciation was partly reversed in \nthe first seven months of 2006, as the Euro, the yen, and other major Asian currencies \nstrengthened vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar. At present, the ongoing increase in Vietnam\u2019s export \nmarket share, together with the comfortable balance of payments position, would seem to \nsuggest that the exchange rate is not misaligned to any significant extent.  \n \n4. \nneeds to remain vigilant. Credit growth has come down significantly since 2004 to near the \nState Bank of Vietnam\u2019s (SBV) revised 2006 target of 20 percent as a result of state-owned \ncommercial banks\u2019 (SOCB) efforts to improve loan quality. However, excess bank  \nliquidity has been boosted in recent months, largely as a result of a sharp increase in SBV \npurchases of foreign exchange, and credit growth could easily pick up again during the second \nhalf of the year, especially if the SOCBs were to step up the financing of a number of large SOE \n\nThe dong has remained broadly stable vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar during the first seven \n\nCredit growth has decelerated considerably over the last year, but monetary policy \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nprojects that are in the pipeline.   \n\nFiscal policy was eased in 2005, and looks set to remain expansionary in 2006. \n\n5. \nDespite the oil revenue windfall, the narrowly-defined official budget balance shifted from a \nsurplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2004 to a deficit of about 1 percent of GDP in 2005, spurred by \nincreasing public sector wages and oil subsidies. A surge in off-budget investment and net \nlending increased the overall deficit (as measured in accordance with the IMF\u2019s definition, which \nincludes broader coverage of the government\u2019s fiscal operations) from less than 3 percent of \nGDP in 2004 to almost 6 percent of GDP in 2005, with an even larger widening of the non-oil \ndeficit. The 2006 budget implies a further expansion of the overall deficit notwithstanding a \nsignificantly larger than expected increase in oil revenues, with the total stock of public debt \nprojected to rise from 43\u00bd percent of GDP in 2005 to 45\u00bd percent of GDP in 2006. \nImplementation of the large state sector investment program contained in the SEDP would keep \npublic sector debt on a rising path over the medium term. While debt service on the mostly-\nconcessional external debt would remain manageable, the debt burden would be increased by \ncontingent liabilities from the SOCB and SOE sectors that the government may eventually have \nto absorb. The amount of such liabilities depends critically on the progress of reforms in these \nsectors in coming years, but is potentially large, adding a degree of uncertainty to the outlook.  \n \nStructural Reforms  \n\nGood progress has been made over the last year in adopting legislation and market \n\n6. \nopening measures required for WTO compliance. The much-awaited Common Investment \nLaw (CIL) and Unified Enterprise Law (UEL), which were approved by the National Assembly \nin November 2005, are expected to take effect in  the near future. While it is difficult to assess the \neffectiveness of these measures pending the finalization of implementing regulations, the new \nlaws are intended to level the playing field between domestic and foreign firms, and introduce a \ncommon investment regime for domestic and foreign investors, consistent with Vietnam\u2019s \ninternational commitments. Vietnam has also completed all bilateral negotiations and hopes to \naccede to the WTO prior to hosting the APEC Summit in November. With the accession, \nVietnam is expected to lower its trade barriers to a wide range of industrial and agricultural \nproducts and services.   \n \n7. \nexpected to gather pace in the period ahead. The issuance of SBV\u2019s Decision 493 in April \n2005 has brought prudential regulations closer into line with international standards, and is likely \nto have contributed to the adoption of more cautious lending practices by SOCBs. However, \ndifficulties in the proper applicatio n of the Decision have delayed the development of NPL \nresolution and SOCB recapitalization plans, with reported discrepancies between  \nSOCBs\u2019 initial NPL estimates and those of international auditors leading to continuing \nuncertainty regarding the size of potential contingent liabilities. Progress on SOCB equitization \nhas also been slow and the existing equitization plans envisage the retention of a controlling \nownership share by the state. Faster financial restructuring, and an enlarged role for participation \nby strategic foreign investors, would be key to improving the SOCBs\u2019 governance, profit \norientation, and competitiveness ahead of Vietnam\u2019s planned liberalization of foreign entry into \nits banking system from April 2007. In this connection, the approva l of the long-awaited banking \n\nProgress in banking sector reform has been uneven in recent years, but it is \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n45 \n\nsector reform road map in May 2006 has been a welcome development. Under this road map, the \nrestructuring of commercial banks is to be accelerated, with all SOCBs to be gradually equitized \nand with international standards of loan classification, provisioning, and capital adequacy to be \napplied by 2010. In addition, the SBV is to be transformed into a modern central bank by 2010, \nwith more clearly-defined responsibilities and enhanced independence and autonomy in the \nconduct of monetary policy.    \n\n8. \nIn the SOE sector, progress towards restructuring larger enterprises has been slow, \nbut the government has recently taken some steps to speed up needed reforms. Despite over \n3,000 SOE transformations to date, equitized firms represented only 12 percent of SOE assets as \nof end-2005. A new directive was issued in 2005 to step up equitization, and a new State Capital \nInvestment Corporation (SCIC) was established to improve the management of government \nstakes in equitized SOEs. In addition, SOEs were instructed to submit to the Ministry of Finance \naudited financial reports to be used as the basis of a performance-based rating exercise. \nHowever, the recent formation of eight \u201ceconomic groups\u201d that are to remain wholly state-owned \ncould potentially strengthen state control over key industries and complicate efforts to reform \nlarger SOEs. In the meantime, the need to prepare SOEs for the challenges of WTO accession \nhas heightened the urgency of reform, and the need to provide incentives to SOE managers to \nmove operations onto a commercial basis. In this context, the recently completed first round of \nthe rating exercise is welcome and could be used as a basis for early equitization of larger SOEs. \n \nStatus of Fund Relations  \n\nA three-year arrangement supported by the IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility \n(PRGF) expired on April 12, 2004. Since then, the IMF has remained fully committed to an \neffective partnership with the government of Vietnam in support of its growth and poverty \nreduction goals, through its advisory role comprised of surveillance missions and the resident \nrepresentative office, coupled with focused technical assistance in areas of core Fund expertise.\n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nPOLICY MATRIX

The  objective  of  Doi  Moi  was  to  rely  more  systematically  on  market \nmechanisms,  while  maintaining  the  poverty  alleviation  focus  which  has  characterized  the \neconomic  policies  of  Viet  Nam  since  its  independence.    This  combination  of  economic \nincentives and social inclusion reflects Viet Nam\u2019s determination to build a market economy with \na  socialist  orientation.    While  much  remains  to  be  done,  economic  developments  have \nconfirmed the wisdom of the reform agenda initiated with  Doi Moi.  The economy has grown by \n7.7%  per  year  since  1991(1991-2005),  in  real  terms,  with  GDP  per  capita  attaining  $640  in \n2005,  compared  to  $143  in  1991.    The  poverty  rate,  measured  in  internationally  comparable \nterms,  declined  from  58%  of  the  population  in  1993  to  less  than  20%  in  2004.    Other  social \nindicators, like those monitored under the Millennium Development Goals, have also improved \nsteadily.  These accomplishments took place without the major turmoil experienced by several \ntransition economies in the initial stages of their reform process, in the early 1990s.  Viet Nam \nalso managed to avoid a recession during the East Asia crisis, in the late 1990s. \n \n\nThe  proposed  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Program  loan  (PRSC),  is  the  last  one  in  a \nseries  of  five  operations,  fully  aligned  with  our  own  planning  cycle.   The  Doi  Moi agenda for \neconomic renovation has been articulated through a series of Government strategies and plans.  \nIn  recent  times,  the  broadest  statement  was  provided  by  the  Ten-Year  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Strategy  2001-2010.    Key  planning  documents  for  the  period  covered  by  the \ncurrent cycle of PRSCs are the 5-year Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2001-2005, \nand  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS).    The  CPRGS, \napproved  by  the  Prime  Minister  in  May  2002,  was  presented  in  July  2002  to  the  Board  of \nExecutive Directors of the International Development Association, as the strategy to implement \nthe SEDP 2001-2005.  The policy actions supported by the proposed program loan reflect the \nreform directions set out in our planning documents and in the CPRGS in particular. \n \n\nImportant  developments  and  policy  breakthroughs  have  also  contributed  to  further \nshaping  the  reform  agenda  along  this  5-year  cycle.    In  2003,  the  CPRGS  was  \u201cexpanded\u201d  to \ninclude  a  development  policy  for  large-scale  infrastructure  and  review  its  role  in  promoting \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.    In  that  same  year,  the  decision  was  made  to \naccelerate Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and this, in turn, has \ninfluenced policy actions related to international trade and the legal framework.  There has also \nbeen  considerable  progress  regarding  public  financial  management.    The  Public  Expenditure \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n61 \n\nReview-Integrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  of  2005,  jointly  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance \nand  the  World  Bank  with  support  from  several  donors,  is  charting  the  way  to  increase  the \nefficiency  and  transparency  of  public  financial  management.    Since  2004,  the  Government \nInspectorate  has  been  leading  a  process  to  make  anti-corruption  policies  and  tools  more \neffective.    And  starting  in  early  2005,  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  prepared  a  strategy  to \nsubstantially accelerate the reform of the banking system. \n \n\nThe  proposed  program  loan  also  supports  some  of  the  policy  orientations  being \ndeveloped in view of the next planning cycle.  As Viet Nam emerges from massive poverty, the \nfocus  is  moving  in  the  direction  of  becoming  a  middle-income country towards the end of the \ndecade.  Without downplaying the importance of a continued and effective fight against poverty, \nthe  new  orientations  highlight  the  need  for  institutional  development,  with  more  appropriate \nmechanisms  to  support  an  increasingly  sophisticated  economy  and  modern  social  protection \narrangements to keep development inclusive.  These new orientations include the strengthening \nof  the  legal  foundations  for  business,  a  transparent  financing  and  efficient  regulation  of \ninfrastructure,  a  drive  towards  universal  systems  in  the  social  sectors,  a  much  stronger \nprotection of the environment, a more transparent  public administration and reduced corruption.  \nWhile  rapid  economic  growth  remains  a  priority,  the  next  planning  cycle  will  also  focus  on  the \nquality of growth. \n \nThe  preparation  of  the  SEDP  2006-2010  has  actually  built  on  the  strengths  of  the \n \nCPRGS.    The  decision  to  integrate  the  CPRGS  principles  and  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals  into  the  SEDP  was  made  in  late  2004.    Since  then,  there  has  been  a  large-scale \nconsultation process with stakeholders in and out of Government, and an active involvement of \nthe donor community.  The new SEDP discussed by the tenth Party Congress last month and \nsubmitted  to  the  National  Assembly  for  approval  this  month,  pays  greater  attention  to  the \nattainment  of  development  outcomes,  over  production  targets.    A  system  to  monitor  and \nevaluate  the  progress  in  attaining  those  outcomes  is  currently  being  set  up.    And  for  the  first \ntime,  forward-looking  exercises  are  being  conducted  at  aggregate  and  sectoral  levels  to \ntranslate  the  broad  orientations  of  the  SEDP  into  the  preparation  of  annual  budgets.    The \nintegration of the CPRGS approach into the SEDP removes the need for two separate planning \ndocuments.  \n \n\nOne of the main objectives of Viet Nam\u2019s development strategy under the current 5-year \ncycle is to complete the transition to a market economy, as reflected in Part III sections I and II, \nand Part IV of the CPRGS.  In this respect, over the last twelve months we have come close to \nconcluding WTO negotiations, and several important laws and regulations have been issued in \npreparation  for  accession.    A  level  playing  field  is  being  attained,  with  all  firms  and  investors \nbeing treated equally, regardless of whether they are privately owned, foreign-owned or state-\nowned.    After  having  equitized  a  large  number  of  State-Owned  Enterprises  (SOEs), including \nincreasingly  large  ones,  the  decision  has  been  made  to  transfer  the  management  of  state \nshareholder  rights  out  of  line  ministries  and  agencies,  so  as  to  avoid  a  conflict  between \nownership  and  regulation.    In  the  financial  sector,  an  ambitious  reform  roadmap  has  been \nadopted  at  the  highest  level  of  Government.    Its  objective  is  to  separate  the  management  of \nState-Owned  Commercial  Banks  (SOCBs)  from  their  supervision,  to  create  a  modern  central \nbank, and to strengthen the commercial orientation of SOCBs through their equitization. \n \n \nAnother important policy objective is to ensure that growth remains socially inclusive and \nenvironmentally sustainable.  In this respect, the proposed program loan is grounded on Part V \nsection I, Part III sections I and III, Part IV section IV and Part V section I of the CPRGS.  The \nprogram loan also builds on recent decisions to combine universal systems in the social sectors, \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nwith  contributions  by  beneficiaries  towards  defraying  the  cost  of  service  provision,  and \nmechanisms to finance the participation of the poor.  A sustained effort is under way to increase \nthe quality of education, with an emphasis on primary schools in poorer districts.  The financing \nof health care is being revamped, with the introduction of health insurance to separate funding \nfrom service provision.  Resources are allocated to cover the health insurance premium of the \npoor  and  to  improve  infrastructure  and  economic  opportunities  in  the  communes  facing  the \ngreatest  hardship.    An  effort  is  also  under  way  to  complete  the  issuance  of  land-use  right \ncertificates and to strengthen the management of water resources.  While not as fast as it could \nbe desired, economic and information tools to protect the environment are being developed.   \n \n\nSuccess in  promoting  economic  growth,  and  in  ensuring  the  social  and  environmental \nsustainability of development, crucially depends on building modern governance.  This area is \ncovered in Part VII section I, and Part III sections I and II and Part VII section I in the CPRGS.  \nThe much strengthened process followed to prepare the SEDP 2006-2010, with its emphasis on \nstakeholders\u2019 consultation and its reliance on development outcomes, is in itself an illustration of \nthe drive towards modern governance.  Equally important are the actions aimed at bridging the \ngap between planning and budgeting, through the preparation of medium-term frameworks, and \nbetween  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures,  through  the  development  of  budget  allocation \nnorms.    A  strategy  has  been  adopted  to  develop  the  legal  system  and  reform  the  judicial \nsystem.    Its  implementation  will  entail  a  substantial  change  in  the  way  courts  operate  and  will \nstrengthen  access  to  justice.    Among  the  policy  actions  supported  by  this  program  loan  is  the \nfirst-ever  anti-corruption  law  in  Viet  Nam,  including  a  mechanism  to  monitor  the  assets  of  civil \nservants and their close families. \n \n\nThe opening speech of Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to at the opening of the \nninth  session  of  the  National  Assembly,  on  May  16,  2006, articulated the same themes and \nreviewed  some  of  the  same  actions  covered  by  the  proposed  program  loan.    Deputy  Prime \nMinister  Nguyen  Tan  Dung  is  also  the  Chairman  of  the  Steering  Committee  for  the  PRSC \nprocess.  His speech to the National Assembly confirms that the proposed program loan is fully \naligned with the reform agenda of Viet Nam. \n \n \nOver  this  planning  cycle,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  regularly  assessed  the \nprogress accomplished, and identified the implementation challenges faced, sharing  its findings \nand views with the donor community.  The annual CPRGS Progress Reports, presented at the \nConsultative  Group  meetings  in  December  of  each  year,  have  been  one  of  the  main \ncommunication  channels  in  this  respect.    The  latest  of  these  reports,  produced in November \n2005,  is  currently  being  circulated  to  the  Executive  Directors  of  the  World  Bank  and  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund,  alongside  an  advisory  note  jointly  written  by  the  staff  of  the  two \norganizations. \n \nThe  proposed  program  loan  and  the  previous  program  loans  cofinancing  a  series  of \n \nPRSCs have also been an effective tool for harmonization.  In the spirit of the Paris Declaration \non  Aid  Effectiveness  and  the  associated  Hanoi  Core  Statement  on  Aid  Effectiveness: \nOwnership,  Harmonization,  Alignment,  Result,  PRSCs  have  allowed  a  coordinated  policy \ndialogue  between  line  ministries  and  Government  agencies  on  the  one  hand  and  an \nincreasingly  large  number  of  donors  on  the  other  hand.    The  Government  of  Viet  Nam \nappreciates this increased coherence of the policy dialogue, and the considerable reduction in \ntransactions costs resulting from the PRSC approach.    \n \n \nWe  have  noted  gratefully  the  increasing  number  of  cofinanciers,  which  has  increased \nfrom  four  in  the  case  of  PRSC  1  to  twelve,  including  ADB,  for  the  current  PRSC  5.  The \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n63 \n\nGovernment  recognizes  that  the  support  of  donors  goes  beyond  filling  the  gap  for  external \nfinancing  needs.  Donors  also  participate  in  partnership  groups  with  the  Government,  which \ncover  all  economic  policy  areas,  and  are  instrumental  in  providing  factual  information  and \nanalysis,  thus  contributing  to  the  monitoring  of  progress  in  reform  implementation,  sharing \ninternational good practices.  \n \n\nWe  have  been  committed  to  pursuing  the  PRSC  process  in  creating  momentum  to \npromote and sustain national growth and development. We assure you that the measures and \naction outlined in this Development Policy Letter and specified in the Policy Matrix of PRSC 5 \ndocument and subsequent ADB loan documents have been adopted in a timely and sustainable \nmanner.  With  PRSC  5  being  the  last  PRSC  operation  in  the  current  5-year  cycle,  we  look \nforward  to  ADB\u2019s  continued  support  alongside  with  other  cofinanciers  beyond  this  planning \ncycle. \n\n \n \n \nYours sincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLe Duc Thuy \nGovernor  \nState Bank of Viet Nam \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nA. \n \nA. \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY STRATEGY AND  ASSESSMENT \n \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy  \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam:  \n \nThe program loan will contribute to poverty reduction by supporting implementation of the Government\u2019s medium -term \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS),  covering  2002\u20132006. The  program  loan in the \nform of a poverty reduction support credit (PRSC) is a multis ector instrument covering a range of issues in a broad-\nbased  reform  agenda  related  to  poverty  reduction  through  three  main  reform  areas  (i)  for  the  transition  of  the \neconomy,  (ii)  on  social  inclusion  and  environmental  sustainability, and  (iii) on modern governance.  The  PRSCs and \nthe  program  loan  provide  an  opportunity  to  advance  restructuring  of  the  economy  to  achieve  equitable  economic \ngrowth and well-being. The CPRGS is an important vehicle to reduce poverty and improve social service delivery and \nother  social  indicators  in  a  sustainable,  equitable,  and  cost-effective manner.  The  program  loan, which follows the \nPRSC  5  policy  framework,  calls  for  accelerating  policy  changes  and  reforms  that  increase  efficiency,  transparency, \nand accountability; and stimulate growth, thereby reducing poverty and improving social services to poor people. The \nCPRGS and thus the program loan are consistent with the poverty reduction strategy, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  country  strategy and  program  update  for  Viet  Nam  2006\u20132008,1  the  final  draft  of  the  country  strategy and \nprogram for Viet Nam 2007\u20132010, and the attainment of the Viet Nam Development Goals (the country version of the \nMillennium Development Goals). \n \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA comprehensive poverty analysis in terms of poverty participatory assessments and poverty survey data 2 was jointly \ncarried  out  as  background  to  the  preparation  of  PRSC  5.3  ADB  also  prepared  the  country  poverty  assessment to \nprovide analytical inputs to the preparation of PRSC 5 and the country strategy and program  2007\u20132010. Viet Nam\u2019s \nachievements  in  terms  of  social  development  and  poverty  reduction  have  been  remarkable.  Almost  one  third  of  the \ntotal population was lifted out of poverty in less then 10 years. Poverty incidence was halved during 1993\u20132002, from \n28.9% in 2002 to 24.1% in 2004.4 Economic growth underpinned the rapid poverty reduction. The elasticity of poverty \nreduction  to  economic  growth  was  higher  than  one.  The  decline  in  poverty  was  widespread  as  the  increase  in \ninequality  was  modest.  Social  indicators  improved  markedly,  positioning  Viet  Nam  well  to  attain  key  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The country has  shown remarkable progress in access to education, health care for children and \nthe poor,  and  gender  equality.  The  last  decade  was  thus  characterized  by  undeniable  progress  in  the  lives  of  the \nVietnamese population. \n \nPoverty incidence is high in remote mountain and highland areas and in the pockets of densely populated deltas and \nriver  basins.  Living  standards  in  these  areas  are  much  lower  than  other  regions.  Ethnic  people  account  for  14%  of \npopulation, but 30% of the poor.  Ethnic minorities in remote mountainous areas  have  not  been  afforded the same \ndevelopment  pace  and  have  limited  access  to  resources,  infrastructure,  markets,  and  government  services .5  The \nshare of poverty in these regions increased during 2002\u20132004.6 Aware of this phenomenon, the Government prepared \nan explicit section on ethnic support in the draft SEDP 2006\u20132010, which means poverty reduction interventions are \nintegrated  in  the  overall  socioeconomic  development  strategy.  Also  the  Government  has  preferential  and  special \nprograms  for  the  poor  and  special  programs  for  ethnic  people  in  these  regions ,  e.g.,  the  comprehensive  Hunger \nEradication  and  Poverty  Reduction  Program   2001\u20132005 and other targeted programs, such as Program 135, which \nare in place and have generally benefited the poor. The two programs are under design for the new phase that would \nbe  further  decentralized,  focus  on  capacity  building,  and  include  participation of people in planning, monitoring, and \nevaluation to increase the programs\u2019 effectiveness.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Draft report of the Poverty Update 2005.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix   8      \n\n  65 \n\n \nWhile decentralization has many advantages, the trend to decentralized government could amplify disparities between \nrich and poor regions, because rich regions have higher local resources and revenues, and thus will be able to spend \nconsiderably  more  on  development  and  social  services  than  poorer  regions,  which  are  dependent  on  central \nGovernment  transfers.  However,  in  the  context  of  World  Trade  Organization accession and with the possible social \nimpact of economic integration, Government transfers and support to the provinces  can be seen as positive mitigation \nmeasures.7  \n \nThe comprehensive Vietnam Development Report 2005 involved seven major development agencies, including ADB. \nThe  Vietnam  Academy  of  Social  Science took a proactive role  in  studies  and  data  analysis  such  as  on  poverty  and \nsocial  impact  assessment  of  World  Trade  Organization  accession.  The  World  Bank,  in  collaboration  with  the \nDevelopment  Strategy  Institute  prepared  reports  on  regional  perspectives  on  poverty  and  growth  for  the  central, \nMekong delta, and northern mountainous regions. These reports provided inputs for PRSC 4 and this program loan \noutlined under the PRSC 5 framework.  \n \nTo  continue  to  reduce  poverty  and  sustain  the  high  economic  growth,  Viet  Nam  needs  to  remove  structural \nweaknesses, promote socially and environmentally inclusive development, and modernize governance and the public \nadministrative  system.  Viet  Nam  needs  to  develop  policy  solutions  for  poverty  reduction,  such  as  create  an \nenvironment for sustainable growth, successfully implement the social safety net, and socialize the poverty reduction \nprograms. \n \n \nC. \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nFormulation  of  the  CPRGS  and  PRSCs  (and  thus  the  program  loan)  involved  comprehensive  consultations  and \ndiscussions with a wide range of stakeholders. It included stakeholder consultations with beneficiaries, national and \nlocal  officials,  development  agencies,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  The  international  development  community \nhas  supported  this  process  by  financing  studies,  participatory  poverty  assessments,  surveys,  and  analysis  under  a \nnumber of activities. The participatory poverty assessment was widely conducted in 12 provinces in 7 regions and will \ncontribute significantly to monitoring of the CPRGS. The  annual  CPRGS  progress  reports  continue  to  provide  good \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  tools  for  the  Consultative  Group  meeting.  The  Government,  during  2005,  worked  to \nintegrate the CPRGS into SEDP 2006\u20132010 by organizing wide stakeholder consultation including the local grassroots \ncommunities,  local  government  officials,  nongovernment  organizations,  associations,  business  and  private  sector \ncommunities, researchers, etc.  With the commitment and proactive approach of the Government, official development \nassistance (ODA) partners and nongovernment organizations have provided support to the  Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment  in  technical  and  financial  matters.  The  results  of  this  process  will  be  very  useful  for  the  Government  to \nformulate the SEDP at both national and local levels and ODA partners to align their strategy with the Government\u2019s \nSEDP. ADB would also align its new country strategy and program 2007\u20132010 with SEDP 2006\u20132010. \n \nThe joint stocktaking workshop on the PRSC in October 2005, supported by ADB, was participated in by the various \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n                                                                                                                                                             \n3 ADB,  Australian  Government\u2019s  Overseas  Aid  Program,  DFID,  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation,  JICA, \nSave the Children UK, United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. 2003.

During  2005,  ODA  partners  and  nongovernment \norganizations committed to conduct participatory community consultation, together with a series of regional workshops \nwith local governments, workshops with ministries, and workshops with business groups and ODA communities on the \nSEDP. Development agencies , including ADB, financed the roll-out and the capacity building for local governments to \nconduct studies , such as participatory poverty assessments, and participatory planning and strategic planning of key \nprograms for the poor.9 This progress reflects effective CPRGS implementation in the context of the pillar III reforms, \nwhich aim to encourage greater participation of the poor, ethnic minorities , and other marginalized groups in commune \ndecision making. The SEDP, adopting the CPRGS principles,  serves as the national poverty reduction strategy. The \nGovernment  has  shared  its  experience  in  developing  more  participative  strategy  with  other  nations  (regional \nworkshop,  Vientiane,  April  2006).  The  new  approach  in  planning  is  also  envisaged  in  the  Budget  Law  and  the \nGrassroots  Democracy  Decree.  Training  support,  career  development,  and  mechanisms  to  increase  participation of \ngroups  (large  and  small)  in  local  authorities,  management  boards,  and  service  delivery  are  being  promoted  by  the \nGovernment working jointly with development agencies, including ADB.  \n \n \nD. \n\nGender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe CPRGS and PRSC 5 support actions to benefit women. The Government is committed to gender equality through \npolicies  and  actions  that  will  require  gender  sensitive  implementation  of  the  program  loan.  The  Government  has \nsigned the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The National Committee for \nthe  Advancement  of  Women  comprises  18  members  at  the  deputy-minister  level  from  key  ministries  and  central \norganizations. The National Strategy for the Advancement of Women in Viet Nam by 2010 includes discrete targets for \n2010,  which  relate  to  equal  rights  for  women  in  labor,  employment,  education,  and  health  care;  an  increase  in  the \nnumber  of  woman  candidates  for  leadership  positions  at  all  levels  and  in  all  sectors;  and  strengthening  of  the \nmechanisms for the advancement of women.  \n\n \nThe 2001\u20132005 National Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women guides the first 5 years of implementation of \nthe  national  strategy  and  has  recorded  good  progress  toward  five  objectives  (i)  women\u2019s  equality  in  labor  and \nemployment, (ii) women\u2019s equality in education, (iii) women\u2019s equality in health care, (iv) improvement of quality and \neffectiveness of women\u2019s participation in sociopolitical and economic activities, and (v) strengthened mechanisms for \nwomen\u2019s advancement. The midterm review of the action plan, organized in early May 2006, identified achievements \nover  the  last  5  years  and  recommended  attention  be  given  to  (i)  the  need  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  women  to \nensure  their  ability  to  take  up/influence  policies  for  women\u2019s  advancement,  and  (ii)  the  monitoring  system  and \ndatabase on women for all action plan components to improve plan implementation. \n \nThe draft gender equality law, drafted by the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union, was submitted to the National Assembly in \nsummer 2006. The Government asked ADB to provide advisory technical assistance to support preparation of this \nlaw. ADB has also supported gender mainstreaming in the agriculture sector. Gender mainstreaming has been \nimplemented in the national SEDP; ADB supported the Government in organizing the gender mainstreaming \nworkshop during August 2005. Gender mainstreaming was also conducted in several ministries, e.g., the ministries of \neducation and training; agriculture and rural development; and labor, invalids, and social affairs. ADB also supported \nmainstreaming of gender into the socioeconomic development planning manual being finalized by the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment. The manual requires that gender issues be integrated into all levels of planning cycles. \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2006.

ADB  has  completed  two  studies  on  the \npotential implications of the development of a land market; \nthe  World  Bank  and  Institute  of  Ethnicity  have  jointly \nconducted studies on resettlement, land and poverty, and \nland  law  practice  for  private  sector  development.  These \nstudies were used as inputs for the preparation of PRSC \n5.  ADB  and  the  Committee  for  Ethnic  Minorities   have \nprepared  a joint study on  a  northern mountainous areas \nsituational  analysis  that  reviews  resettlement  policies  in \nthe  region.  These  studies  help  to  ensure  any  policy \nactions needed under PRSC 5. \nTargeted programs are already in place to assist the poor \nin need of social services. Early in 2006, the Government \napproved a second phase for both the Hunger Eradication \nand Poverty Reduction Program and Program 135 for up \nto  2010.  However,  more  concrete  guidelines  and \nstrategies to implement these programs are needed. The \nUnited Nations Development Programme and some other \ndevelopment  partners are supporting the Government in \ndeveloping clearer guidelines that prepare the capacity of \nthe  Government  at  all  levels  to  better  undertake  these \ntargeted  programs.  The  action  to  improve  the  targeted \nprogram is set as one policy action in the PRSC 5 policy \nmatrix.  Development  partners  should  coordinate  as \nenvisaged  in  the  Hanoi  Core  Statement  (June  2005)  to \ndevelop  a  plan  to  ensure  readiness  and  synergy  of \nnumerous   projects supporting  the  Government\u2019s  targeted \nprograms.

Urban  labor \nand  the  labor  market  become  unstable  especially  when \nfaced  with  migrants.  Negative  labor  impacts  will  be \nminimized  by  some  Government  measures  such  as  the \ncreation  of  an  environment  and  market  for  labor  export, \npromotion  of  vocational  training,  and  development  of  a \nviable  voluntary social insurance system.  A  social safety \nnet  program  has  been  prepared  for  retrenched  SOE \nworkers ;  th e   program  will  comply  with  national  labor \nlegislation.

Thus,  the  program  loan  includes \ntwo policy measures to ensure that indigenous people are \nthe \nincluded  and  well-targeted  as  beneficiaries \nGovernment-initiated poverty targeting programs, such as \nHealth  Care  Funds  for  the  Poor  and  Program  135.  The \nimplementation  of  these  programs  will  be  carried  out  in \nparallel  outside  of  the  PRSC  operations.  No  adverse \nimpact  on  indigenous  people  associated  with  these  two \npolicy actions is foreseen. The Government is committed \nto  advancing  the  well-being  of  these  indigenous  groups, \npublic  awareness,  and \nincorporation  of  needs  and \ninterests  of  ethnic  minorities  in  plans  and  programs \nthrough their active involvement. Besides targeted support \nto  areas, \nthe \nadvancement  of  ethnic  minorities  and \nregional \nsocioeconomic  development  under  decisions  168,  173, \nand  186  for  the  central  highlands,  Mekong  delta,  and \nnorthern mountainous areas, the new land legislation and \nland  transfer  to  ethnic  people  is  likely  to  have  a  positive \nimpact.

First,  it  will  promote  growth  and  create \nemployment  through  greater  internal  and  external  competition,  accelerate  the  divestiture  of  SOEs  and  state-owned \ncommercial  banks,  establish  a  sound  regulatory  framework,  and  improve  transparency  and  accountability  in  SOE \noperations and in the financial sector. Second, it will advance human development and economic growth through an \nexpanded budget appropriation and higher quality standards for education, resources to cover the health care costs of \nthe poor, mechanisms to complete the transfer of land-use rights to households, more secure asset ownership in the \nform of a new land law especially in upland and ethnic minority areas , and measures to improve environmental and \nwater  resources  management.  Third,  the  program  loan  will  increase  transparency  and  accountability  of  public \nfinances , promote simplified administrative procedures , reduce corruption, and revamp the planning processes as part \nof a broader effort to build modern governance. The reforms will pursue the attainment of specified development goals \nbased on empirical analysis and wider consultations. \n \nThe reforms will result in increased private investment and exports, which will lead to additional job creation. Further \ndecentralization of public administration leading to better service delivery to the poor and increased local beneficiary \nparticipation are other expected benefits. Through appropriate measures and proactive programs, the Government will \nneed  to  mitigate  the  potential  adverse  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impacts  of  increased  trade  openness, \nreduction of state enterprises, and liberalization of land transactions. \n \nStrong  direct  and  indirect  benefits  are  expected  to  reach  the  poor  in  terms  of  increased  and  more  rewarding \nemployment  opportunities,  improved  service  delivery,  decentralized  planning,  and  promotion  of  beneficiary \nparticipation.  Any  increase  in  employment  opportunity  and  efficiency  gain  in  service  delivery will directly benefit the \npoor. The Government has special programs and policies in place to ensure that women and the poor have access to \njobs,  basic  health  services,  education,  and  infrastructure,  especially  in  the  mountainous  regions  and  in  poor  urban \nareas. Its commitment to enhancing the well-being of ethnic minorities is reflected in the country\u2019s constitution and the \ncreation in 1983 of the Committee for Ethnic Minorities with ministry equivalent status. \n \nGreater exposure to world markets and  WTO  accession  could  lead  to  higher  risk/variability  in  prices  and  hence  the \nincome  of  wage  earners  and  farmers,  but  its  overall  impact  is  likely  to  be  positive  for  the  rural  sector.  Further \ncommercialization of the economy may increase inequality, unless rectifying measures are taken early. Analytical work \nhas  been  done  for  24  sectors  under  an  assessment  of  the  poverty  and  social  impact  of  WTO  accession.  This  work \nincludes  a  combination  of  analyses  at  three  levels  (a  computable  general  equilibrium  model  to  predict chances in \nprices  of  goods  and  services;  regional  models  to  determine  changes  in  prices  of  factors  of  production  that  are  not \nmobile,  such  as  land  and  labor;  and  estimated  impact  on  household  consumption). Rural sectors  such as  livestock \nraising,  fisheries, rice,  and  sugar show positive economic impacts but some show negative social impacts (sugar, \nrice). The regions of  Danang City, Hai Phong, Hanoi,and Ho Chi Minh City  are expected to benefit most from WTO \naccession, while the poverty reduction effect for the mountainous areas could be more modest.  \n \nRestructuring and divesting of SOEs will cause labor retrenchment. To offset the adverse impact of retrenchment, the \nGovernment has established a fund for retrenched SOE workers. This fund has been in place since mid-2002 and an \nevaluation rates the fund as highly effective. \n \nReliance on market forces and private sector involvement in providing basic services could help expand the availability \nof services and create new employment opportunities, but prices of services may go up. To minimize such impacts, \nbasic services for low-income groups are provided free of charge or at reduced costs and as part of safety nets. These \nprograms already exist but may need to be expanded depending on the scope and pace of privatization/cost recovery. \nCareful  consideration  must  be  given  to  interregional  equity  when  reforming  service  delivery,  particularly  for  health, \neducation, transportation, and communication infrastructure. \n \nDecentralization should make local government  more  accountable  to  the  poorest  for  their  participation  in  decision \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nPossible \nChannels \nof Effect \n\nEffects on the Poor \n \n\nEffects on Other \nStakeholders \n \n\nMitigation or \nEnhancement \nMeasures \n \n\nmaking on development programs and delivery of services. The current participation of the poor in the planning and \ndecision-making  process  is  low,  but  ongoing  efforts  to  increase  the  participatory process will have positive impacts: \nCommunity consultations on SEDP 2006\u20132010, participatory small infrastructure planning in selected projects run by \nthe  Government  or  supported  by  ODA  funds,  better  harmonization  principles ,  and  enhanced  ownership  of  the \ngovernment through budget support,  will  strengthen  the  decentralization  through  budget transfer.  Experiences with \ncommunity  participation  will  provide  substantial  inputs  for  the  design  of  the  new  135  program.  Because  poor \nhouseholds  are  usually  physically  remote  and  socially  marginalized,   the  Government  has  programs  in  place  to \naccelerate access to social services and education for the poor and ethnic minorities in remote areas.  The recent Viet \nNam  Inequality  Report  2005  (funded  by  Department  for  International  Development,  United  Kingdome) provides \ninsights for better inclusion of the poor, thus ensuring access of the poor to basic social services. \n \nThe Land Law is expected to benefit poor and vulnerable people. As the land market develops in the medium term, \npotential adverse social impacts may have to be addressed. Two studies on the potential implications of a land market \nwere undertaken as part of the ongoing Making Markets Work Better for the Poor  Project being implemented by ADB \nto contribute to preparation of PRSC 5.  \n \nIncomplete structural reform could jeopardize growth and stability in the longer term. A fiduciary risk is associated with \ninadequate  progress  on  enhancing  budget  transparency  and  tackling  corruption.  Haphazard  introduction  of  market \nforces in the social sectors, and the trend toward decentralization have put service delivery under strain. At the same \ntime,  fast  integration  with  the  world  economy  may  lead  to  increased  inequality,  at  least  temporarily,  as  the  benefits \naccrue to specific regions. Growth in Viet Nam could become less inclusive in the years to come. These issues are \nwell understood and several programs are already well established to offset the adverse effects. \n \nFurther details are presented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n75 \n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n\nimported  goods  (excluding  any  duties  or \n\nThe proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance foreign exchange expenditures for the \n1. \nreasonable  cost  of \ntaxes)  required  during \nimplementation  of  the  program  loan  for  Support  the Implementation of  the  Poverty Reduction \nProgram.
