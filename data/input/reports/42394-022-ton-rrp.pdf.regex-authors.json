I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia, \nboth to the Kingdom of Tonga for Nuku\u2019alofa Urban Development Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will provide high priority urban infrastructure identified in the Nuku'alofa \nUrban Infrastructure Development Plan and strengthen the policy environment for delivery of \nurban services. The project will expand on infrastructure development being undertaken in \nNuku\u2019alofa  through  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  Reconstruction  Project  and  the  Integrated  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Project.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Urban growth. Nuku\u2019alofa, Tonga\u2019s capital, has a population of 34,058 (34% of the \nnational population) and is forecast to grow to 45,000 (or about 40% of Tonga's population) by \n2030. Migration to Nuku\u2019alofa from Tonga\u2019s outer islands is significant. Urban growth in Tonga \nhas not been matched by the provision of, or improvement in the delivery of, urban services. \nLiving conditions for many Nuku\u2019alofa residents are deteriorating, and demand for improved \nurban infrastructure is increasing. \n \n4.  Development pressure in Nuku\u2019alofa is increasing as a result of population growth. The \nexisting urban infrastructure is already insufficient to meet the demands of the current urban \npopulation. Upgrading of existing infrastructure is being undertaken through the Nuku\u2019alofa \nReconstruction Project and the Integrated Urban Development Sector Project. However, the \nscope of these projects is limited and they will not meet all immediate infrastructure needs. \nFurther investment in urban infrastructure is required. Land for urban expansion of Nuku\u2019alofa is \nlimited to peripheral agricultural and ecologically sensitive areas. \n \n5.  Government policy and strategy. The Government of Tonga\u2019s development aims and \nprogram are presented in the Tonga Strategic Development Framework (TSDF).3 The TSDF \nspecifically  targets  infrastructure  and  has  four  priority  themes  for  economic  infrastructure: \n(i) renewable energy and stable electricity prices, (ii) improved access to markets, (iii) improved \nmanagement  of  the  water  and  waste  cycle,  and  (iv)  improved  asset  management.  ADB\u2019s \nCountry Partnership Strategy, Tonga, 2007\u201320124 supports implementation of the TSDF. The \ndraft National Spatial Planning and Management Act 2011 (NSPM) pending in the legislature, \nwhen  enacted,  will  provide  the  framework  for  land  use  planning  and  development.  Urban \nplanning objectives articulated in the NSPM include the creation of an urban structure with \nequitable access to employment, transportation, recreational and other opportunities, and to \nprotect public utilities and other assets and enable the orderly provision and coordination of \npublic utilities and other facilities for the benefit of the community. \n \n6.  The government has prepared costed and prioritized infrastructure development plans \nfor Tonga, the Tonga National Infrastructure Investment Plan (TNIIP), and for Nuku\u2019alofa, the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Nuku\u2019alofa Reconstruction Project is funded through a CNY440 million loan from the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and was approved in 2007. The Integrated Urban Development Sector Project was approved by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in March 2008. (ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors: Proposed Asian Development Fund Grant, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Tonga \nfor the Integrated Urban Development Sector Project. Manila .) \n3  Government of Tonga. 2011. Tonga Strategic Development Framework 2011\u20132014. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n4  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: Tonga, 2007\u20132012. Manila. ", "2 \nUrban  Infrastructure  Development  Plan  (UIDP).  The  UIDP  will  guide  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment  for  Nuku\u2019alofa  in  the  short  term  (FY2011 FY2013),  medium-term \n(FY2014 FY2016), and long-term (FY2017 FY2031). The infrastructure investments identified \nin the UIDP are generally aligned with urban infrastructure investments identified in the TNIIP. \n \n7.  Further  assistance  is  required  to  improve  planning  and  the  sustainability  of  urban \nservices. The Planning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA) of the Ministry of Transport will \nbe responsible for implementing the NSPM. Capacity development will be required within PUMA \nto implement and enforce the NSPM and to establish the National Spatial Planning Authority \nadvisory committee. The policies for water supply and solid waste services tariffs are obsolete \nand require amendment to enable recovery of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs in the \nshort term and full cost recovery of O&M, depreciation, and financing costs in the medium- to \nlong-term. Planned and preventative maintenance for urban infrastructure are neither prepared \nnor implemented, with the exception of Tonga Power Limited, resulting in the rapid dilapidation \nof urban assets. \n \n8.  Water supply. About 98% of households in Nuku\u2019alofa have access to the piped water \nsupply provided by Tonga Water Board (TWB), a state-owned enterprise. Water for the TWB \nwater supply is pumped from the Mataki\u2019eua Tongamai well field and is chlorinated prior to \ndistribution. Currently, only 32 of the 40 production wells are operating. Water quality monitoring \ndata indicate increasing salinity of the Mataki\u2019eua Tongamai acquifer, particularly in the wells \nclosest to Faga\u2019uta Lagoon. The construction of additional production wells to the west of the \nexisting wells will reduce the risk of further saline intrusion. Diesel-powered pumps at the \nwellfield are a source of soil contamination and potential water contamination and have higher \nO&M costs than electric pumps. \n \n9.  Nonrevenue water (NRW) in the Nuku\u2019alofa water supply network is estimated to be \n30%\u201350%.  Unmetered  usage  from  fire  hydrants  and  leakage  from  consumer  service \nconnections are considered to be substantial. Current average daily production, estimated at \n7,000  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  day,  is  inadequate  to  meet  demand  and  the  system  losses. \nDemand is projected to increase from the current level of 4,800 m3 per day to 6,600 m3 per day \nby  2016.  Reduction  of  NRW  is  essential  to  reduce  the  required  production  rates  at  the \nMataki\u2019eua Tongamai well field and water production costs. \n \n10.  The  financial  performance  of  TWB  has  steadily  improved  since  FY2008,  with  the \noperating  loss  falling  from  T$820,000  in  FY2008  to  T$167,000  in  FY2010.  This  trend  is \nexpected to continue in FY2011. Preliminary results for the year to date in March FY2011 \nindicate an operating surplus of T$1.1 million. This improvement is attributed to increased water \nrevenue, which grew by 35%, and improved bill collection, which increased from 88% to 94%. \nTotal operating costs during the same period increased by 16%. TWB charges its customers \nT$2.97 per 1,000 liters. TWB does not receive subsidies from the government and relies on \nexternal grants to finance capital works. \n \n11.  Sanitation. Most households in Nuku\u2019alofa rely on individual septic tank systems for \nwastewater disposal. Many septic tanks are undersized, improperly constructed, and maintained \nonly when full or overflowing. Septic tanks are the main source of contaminants in aquifers \nwithin the Nuku\u2019alofa area. Contaminated groundwater discharging to the coastal fringe and \nlagoon areas causes excessive algal growth, and there are concerns about impacts on the \naquatic ecosystems. Monitoring wells to assess groundwater quality have been constructed, \nand a water quality monitoring program commenced in June 2010. \n \n12.  Solid waste management. In 2007, a new landfill was commissioned at Tapuhia; a \nhousehold  solid  waste  collection  system  was  implemented  on  Tongatapu;  and  the  Waste \n ", "3 \nAuthority Limited (WAL) was established to take control of solid waste collection and disposal. \nThis includes responsibility for disposal of septage at the Tapuhia facility. The performance of \nWAL over the past 3 years has been poor. In particular, billing and revenue collection are \nineffective. The replacement of the WAL board and chief executive officer in May 2011 is \nexpected  to  result  in  improved  management.  The  revenue  collection  rate  for  solid  waste \ncharges is about 27% of billings. A revenue collection rate of about 70% is required, based on \ncurrent solid waste charges, for recovery of O&M costs. WAL is not financially viable, and \ndespite a maintenance fund provided by Australian Agency for International Development, is \nunable to fund adequate maintenance and repairs, and has a growing maintenance backlog that \nplaces  the  provision  of  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal  services  at  risk.  Capacity \ndevelopment within WAL is urgently required to (i) provide robust financial management and for \ntariff  setting,  billing,  revenue  collection,  and  accounting;  (ii) provide  a  sustainable  asset \nmanagement system, including the preparation of a 5-year asset management plan; and (iii) \nstrengthen governance and management. \n \n13.  Roads. Traffic growth in Nuku\u2019alofa has resulted in congestion of the main approach \nroads to the urban area and roads in the town center. Limited traffic management at strategic \nlocations,  particularly  regarding  parking,  contributes  to  traffic  congestion.  The  absence  of \nadequate road drainage and the poor maintenance of existing drains result in frequent flooding \nof  roads.  The  surfaces  of  most  local  residential  access  roads  are  gravel,  and  they  are \nimpassable during wet weather. Limited provisions for pedestrians (i.e., footpaths) result in \npedestrian\u2013vehicular traffic conflicts, particularly after heavy rainfall, when roadside flooding \nforces pedestrians onto the main roadways. \n \n14.  Drainage. Tongatapu is flat and low-lying, the highest elevation being 70 meters above \nsea level. Most of the urban area of Nuku\u2019alofa is only 1\u20132 meters above sea level and is \nsubject to periodic flooding during heavy rain. Most floodwater eventually infiltrates into the \nlimestone substrata, but extensive low-lying areas within the urban area are frequently flooded \nand  provide  ideal  conditions  for  mosquitoes  and  transmission  of  waterborne  diseases. \nDevelopment of residential subdivisions on the fringes of Nuku\u2019alofa is constrained by large \nareas of undrained surface water, requiring substantial filling of properties and raising of roads. \nThe piecemeal raising of road levels and filling of properties has altered the natural drainage \npatterns, and created additional swamps and open water bodies, resulting in flood damage to \nproperty and a loss of access to unfilled properties. \n \n15.  Asset management. Management of existing and new urban infrastructure is a high \npriority. Government policy specifies that the cost of O&M of economic infrastructure must be \nfunded from user charges. The government intends to work closely with public enterprises, the \nprivate  sector,  and  development  partners  to  lift  the  overall  performance  of  the  economic \ninfrastructure sector, and, as a minimum, to achieve self-funding of sustainable O&M by the \ngovernment and public enterprises. \n \n16.  Sector  financing.  The  project  meets  the  criteria  for  sector  financing  as  (i)  the \ngovernment  has  prepared  a  prioritized  and  costed  urban  sector  development  plan  for \nNuku\u2019alofa,  the  UIDP,  and  the  TNIIP;  (ii)  Tonga  is  implementing  the  Integrated  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Project (IUDSP)5, which has a sector loan modality, and has the capacity \nto implement both the UIDP and the TNIIP; and (iii) the policies for development of Tonga\u2019s \nurban  sector  as  provided  in  the  IUDSP  are  appropriate,  are  supported  by  infrastructure \ndevelopment  polices  articulated  in  the  TNIIP  and  the  TSDP  and  will  undergo  further \nimprovement.  The  NSPM  will  provide  the  framework  for  planning  and  coordinating  urban \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Asian Development \nFund Grant, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Integrated Urban Development \nSector Project. Manila. \n ", "4 \ndevelopment.6 The estimated investment cost to implement the UIDP is $186 million comprising \n$87.5  million  for  short-term  (high  priority)  investments,  $48.5  million  for  medium-term \ninvestments, and $50 million for long-term investments. The project will assist the government in \nimplementing the UIDP and the NSPM and to reform tariff and asset management policies for \nTWB and WAL. Lessons from previous relevant ADB and development partner operations in \nTonga have been incorporated in the project design. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact of the project is improved living conditions for the population of Nuku\u2019alofa. \nThe outcome of the project will be Nuku\u2019alofa residents have access to improved municipal \nservices. \n \nC.  Outputs \n18.  Output 1: Strengthened policy environment for delivery of urban services. The \nproject  will  strengthen  the  policy  environment  for  delivery  of  urban  services  in  Tonga  by \n(i) building capacity within PUMA to develop urban planning and management policies and to \nimplement the NSPM for improved planning and coordination of urban services and urban \ninfrastructure development; (ii) reforming TWB and WAL tariffs for recovery of water supply and \nsolid waste services O&M costs, and (iii) building capacity to develop and implement urban \ninfrastructure asset management plans. \n \n19.  Output 2: Effective, efficient, and sustainable water supply services in Nuku\u2019alofa. \nThe core subproject will (i) increase the water production at the Mataki\u2019eua Tongamai well field; \n(ii) increase the raw water storage capacity; (iii) improve the management of the water supply \nnetwork through the creation of supply zones and improved bulk supply metering; (iv) reduce \nNRW from the current level, estimated at about 50%, to less than 25%; (v) develop consumer \nwater meter replacement policies and replace defective consumer meters; and (vi) improve \nrevenue collection, billing, and financial management capacity. \n \n20.  Output 3: Sustainable solid waste services in Nuku\u2019alofa. This core subproject will \nassist WAL to improve its service delivery to the residents of Nuku\u2019alofa by improving waste \ndisposal operations at the Tapuhia landfill, improving and expanding solid waste collection \nservices, and strengthening financial management capacity in WAL. \n \n21.  Output 4: Other municipal services within Nuku\u2019alofa improved. Other municipal \nservices  will  be  improved  through  the  implementation  of  selected  high-priority  urban \ninfrastructure  components  identified  in  the  UIDP  and  the  TNIPP  (candidate  subprojects), \nincluding at least one sanitation subcomponent such as a sanitation and wastewater master \nplan for Nuku\u2019alofa. Candidate subprojects will be selected in accordance with the  agreed \nselection criteria and due diligence requirements set out in the Project Administration Manual \n(PAM) and will be approved by the project steering committee and ADB. \n \n22.  Output 5: Raised community awareness of municipal services. The project will raise \ncommunity  awareness  of  municipal  services  issues  including  planning  and  development \nconsent requirements; household responsibilities for managing solid waste (reduce, recycle, \nreuse); and public health benefits of safe waste handling and disposal. The project will improve \ncustomer complaints mechanisms in the TWB and WAL, and conduct public consultation on \nservice standards, water conservation, and demand management.

The financial costs of the core \nsubprojects were used, including the recurrent replacement costs of capital equipment items, \nbut  excluding  price  contingencies  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction. \nResettlement and consulting costs were included in the analysis. The financial internal rate of \nreturn for the water supply core subproject is 13%, and the financial internal rate of return for the \nsolid waste core subproject is 20%. \n \n28.  Economic  analyses  were  undertaken  for  the  water  supply  and  solid  waste  core \nsubprojects by comparing the discounted costs and benefits under the with- and without-project \nscenarios over 2012\u20132032 in constant 2012 prices. The without-project case represents a \ncontinuation  of  the  existing  situation,  and  the  with-project  case  represents  the  project \ninvestment scenario. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the water supply core \nsubproject is estimated at 13%, slightly higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12%) and the \nEIRR for the solid waste core subproject is 31%. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken on the \neconomic results to examine the impacts of key assumptions and project risks as follows: \n(i) total costs increased by 10%, (ii) total revenue reduced by 10%, (iii) total costs increased by \n10% and total revenue reduced by 10%, and (iv) construction period lengthened by 1 year. \nUnder these scenarios, the viability of the water supply core subproject falls, with EIRRs of 9%\u2013\n11%.10 While Tonga is not a fragile state per se, ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach considers small \nisolated Pacific states, including Tonga, as fragile and elements of ADB\u2019s approach to fragile \nstates apply including relaxation of expected economic rates of return. The solid waste core \nsubproject  remains  economically  viable  under  these  adverse  scenarios,  with  EIRR  values \nremaining well above the opportunity cost of capital, the lowest value being 24%. \n \nB.  Governance \n29.  Financial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \nexecuting agency, the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP), will open an imprest \naccount for the ADB grant and an imprest account for the Government of Australia grant, \nimmediately after grant effectiveness to be used exclusively for the ADB and the Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  shares  of  eligible  expenditures.  A  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) performance assessment conducted in 2010 concluded that Tonga\u2019s PFM \nsystem is based on a solid legal and regulatory framework and underpinned by a set of well \nestablished expenditure control procedures covering wages and salaries, non-salary items and \nprocurement. 11 The  MFNP  is  administering  the  imprest  account  for  the  Integrated  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Project (footnote 5) using statement of expenditure procedures with a \nceiling of $100,000. Annual independent audits of the Integrated Urban Development Sector \nProject imprest account for FY2009 and FY2010 are satisfactory and show no anomalies in \nmanagement. Statements of expenditure will be prepared by the PMU and verified by the \nMFNP. \n \n30.  Procurement.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  MFNP  was  performed  and \nconcluded that Tonga\u2019s procurement regulations and procedures are comprehensive and that \nthe MFNP procurement unit is functioning well but has limited procurement experience and \nqualifications.12 Procurement of all goods and services under the project will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All \ncontracts  for  works  will  be  awarded  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2007.

Project consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using quality- and cost-based \nselection procedures. The government has requested ADB to assist in recruiting the project \nimplementation assistance consultants. ADB will assist by selecting the consultants on behalf of \nthe executing agency (MFNP). However, MFNP will be responsible for negotiating the contract \nwith the consultants and supervising their services. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MFNP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 7). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n32.  A  social  survey  conducted  in  April  2011  concluded  that  communities  in  Nuku\u2019alofa \nidentify the poor as those facing hardship.  Lack of employment and  other income-earning \nopportunities are the main causes of hardship. Other causes included too many dependents, \nlandlessness,  the  burden  of  family,  community  obligations,  poor  health,  and  poor  family \nbudgeting. Specific groups most vulnerable to hardship include children, youth, women, the \ndisabled, and the elderly. The project will address hardship by fostering equitable, reliable, and \nquality water and waste management services and other urban services. \n \n33.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, with the majority of project \noutputs having specific gender design features to facilitate and ensure women\u2019s participation \nand  access  to  project  benefits.  Significant  concerns  of  women  in  Nuku\u2019alofa  include \n(i) affordability  of  urban  services,  (ii)  improving  water  and  power  usage  (conservation), \n(iii) improving the health and well-being of households and the community, (iv) greater access to \ninformation  on  urban  services  and  urban  planning,  (v)  greater  involvement  in  developing \nsolutions  for  communities  through  women\u2019s  committee  support,  and  (vi)  involvement  in \nconsultation and decision making. The project gender action plan (GAP) will address these \nconcerns and ensure that any potential harmful effects on women are avoided. The GAP \nincludes specific actions that will allow women to benefit from the project.13 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n34.  Environment. The project is classified environmental category B. Initial environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) for the water supply and solid waste subprojects and an environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF) were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009).14 The water supply core subproject provides a positive environmental \nbenefit through sustainable water resource management. The solid waste core subproject will \nexpand the environmentally safe waste disposal capacity of the Tapuhia landfill, and will re-\nimplement  and  deliver  more  effective  waste  collection  services  and  landfill  operations.  No \nsignificant environmental impacts will result from the implementation of the solid waste core \nsubproject. \n \n35.  The EARF will guide the assessment of subsequent subprojects. PUMA will receive \nsupport  from  the  project  implementation  assistance  consultants  in  (i)  preparing  IEEs  for \nsubsequent subprojects, (ii) monitoring of contractor compliance and of ongoing impacts, and \n(iii) reporting on environmental monitoring. The EARF includes a reporting outline to guide the \n                                                \n13 ADB  Guidelines  for  Gender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  ADB  projects.  http://www.adb.org/gender/gender-\ncategories.asp.  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 IEE: Water Supply Subproject, IEE: Solid Waste Subproject, and  EARF (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nreporting on the main environmental effects. The government has endorsed the IEEs for the \nwater supply and solid waste subprojects and the EARF. \n \n36.  Climate change. A climate risk profile for Tonga, prepared by ADB in 2008, indicates \nthat the main impacts of climate change are expected to be high sea levels, extreme winds, and \nextreme high air and water temperatures. Best estimates of long-term, systematic changes in \nthe  average  climate  for  Tonga  indicate  that  sea  level  is  likely  to  have  increased  by  36 \ncentimeters  and  the  frequency  of  severe  short  sea  level  rise  resulting  from  storm  surge \n(2.2 meters above mean sea level) will increase from a one in 580-year event to a one in 5-year \nevent by 2050. The project will provide the Nuku\u2019alofa water supply with greater resilience to \nclimate change through the development of water supply wells located further from Faga\u2019uta \nLagoon and less likely to be subject to saline intrusion as a consequence of sea level rise. \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B.  A  resettlement \nframework (RF) was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and a \nresettlement plan (RP) was prepared for the water supply core subproject. The government has \nendorsed the RF and RP. The solid waste core subproject is not expected to require land \nacquisition and a resettlement plan was not prepared for the subproject. The water supply core \nsubproject will involve the construction of 12 new wells requiring long-term leases of small plots \nof land from three households and one farming enterprise. There will be no temporary impacts \non private or public assets as a result of construction or new easements, as all additional works \nare on existing rights-of-way. A total of 19 people will be affected by land acquisition for the \nproject. However, no relocation of dwellings or other structures will be required.  No acquisition \namounts to more than 10% of a household\u2019s total land holding. Therefore, none of the impacts \nare considered significant. \n \n38.  The solid waste core subproject consists of three components: (i) upgrading Tapuhia \nlandfill, (ii) a pilot community waste bin project in five peri-urban villages, and (iii) financial \nmanagement  and  accounting  support.  Components  1  and  3  have  no  land  acquisition \nrequirements or resettlement impacts. Component 2 will be implemented in select communities \nwhere  land  acquisition  for  community  waste  bins  is  not  required.  Selection  of  sites  for \ncomponent 2 activities will not occur until project implementation. Additional due diligence will \nthen  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  no  resettlement  impacts  result  from  component  2.  No \nconstruction activities under component 2 will be undertaken until ADB confirms it has no \nobjection to the proposed sites.15 \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified indigenous peoples as category C. The \npeople in Tonga are Polynesian and consider themselves indigenous in terms of ethnic origin. \nThe project is not expected to have a negative impact on any distinct and vulnerable group of \nindigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. . While a separate \nindigenous peoples plan is not needed, all project outputs will be delivered in a culturally \nappropriate and participatory manner to meet the needs of various beneficiaries. \n \n40.  All safeguard documents will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The project will support \ncapacity development within the executing and implementing agencies to manage safeguards. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n41.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n15 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCommunities within Nuku\u2019alofa do not  The project will build awareness within the Nuku\u2019alofa communities \ncomply with urban planning requirements.  of the need for urban planning, development, and management. \nDelay in land acquisition for core  Land requirements for core subprojects are minimal.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n42.  The government and the MFNP have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and grant documents. \n \n43.  The government and the MFNP have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the grant agreements. \n \n44.  As a condition to effectiveness of the grant from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, the \ncommitment of grant co-financing from the Government of Australia will have become final in \nform and substance to ADB and the grant agreement concerning the provision by ADB of grant \ncofinancing from the Government of Australia will have been signed and delivered in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n45.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the grant not exceeding $6,060,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources,  for  the  Nuku\u2019alofa  Urban  Development  Sector  Project,  on \nterms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft grant agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$6,440,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Nuku\u2019alofa Urban Development \nSector Project, to be provided by the Government of Australia. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n26 September 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and \nDesign Summary  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks  \nIndicators \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nThe living conditions  National human development  United Nations  Continued commitment by the \nfor the Nuku\u2019alofa  index is maintained at or  Development  government to maintain and improve \nurban population  increases from 0.677 (2009  Programme human  urban management and development \nhave improved.  baseline) by 2020.  development index   \nreports  Risk \nPolitical interference in urban sector \nplanning, development, and management \nOutcome      Assumptions \nNuku\u2019alofa residents  The reliability of Nuku\u2019alofa  TWB annual reports \nFunds are available for infrastructure \nhave access to  water supply (availability) at all   \nmaintenance. \nimproved municipal  locations increases to 99.9% at   \nservices.  the network extremities by    The government maintains commitment \n2017 (2011 baseline: less than    to managing urbanization in Tonga and \n50%).    growth of Nuku\u2019alofa. \n  WAL annual reports \nThe government maintains commitment \nConsumer access to solid    to full cost recovery for municipal services \nwaste management services in   \nNuku\u2019alofa increases to 80%     \nby 2017.   \n \n(2011 baseline: 40%) \n \n \nTWB and WAL \nTWB and WAL finance 100% \nannual reports \nof O&M, depreciation, and \nfinancing costs in the medium \nto long term. \n(2011 baseline: full cost \nrecovery is not achieved) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
