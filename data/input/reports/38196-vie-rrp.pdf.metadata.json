The  Project  covers  the  northern  part  of  Viet  Nam, \nwhich  is  relatively  poor.  The  Project  will  enable  power  to  be \nsupplied  to  the  planned  industrial  zones  in  the  region,  thereby \nincome-generating  opportunities. \nfacilitating  employment  and \nThus,  it  will  benefit  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities  living  in  the \nproject  area.  The  Project  will  also  create  the  potential  for  power \ninterconnection  between  Viet  Nam  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina. \n \nEconomic growth has been averaging about 7% per year over the \npast  decade.  This,  in  turn,  has  fueled  growth  in  demand  for \nelectricity by about 15% per year. This rapid economic expansion \nhas helped Viet Nam reduce the share of the population living in \npoverty from 58% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The Government\u2019s aim \nis  to  maintain  this  economic  growth  until  2010,  and  to  reduce \npoverty  incidence  to  19%.  Due  to  the  strong  economic  growth, \nViet  Nam\u2019s  electricity  supply  deficit  is  growing,  especially  during \nthe dry season, due to its heavy dependence on hydropower. To \nmeet the load growth, the Government plans to more than double \nthe current installed capacity to 22,600 megawatts (MW) by 2010. \nIf  not  addressed  quickly  and  effectively,  this  deficit  will  constrain \nthe  quality  and  reliability  of  electricity  supply  to  rural,  industrial, \ncommercial,  and  residential  consumers  in  northern  Viet  Nam. \nLoad  shedding  and  significant  voltage  fluctuations  are  prevalent, \nundermining  the  operating  cost  structures  of  businesses  across \nindustry, services, and trade. \n \nWith  increased  generation  capacity,  transmission  bottlenecks  will \nworsen,  increasing  transmission  losses,  unless  the  transmission \nsystem  in  the  north  is  strengthened  and  developed.  EVN \nenvisages an investment requirement of $17.5 billion up to 2010, \nwhich  will  not  materialize  without  long-term  finance.  While  local \nfinance is available, the terms are comparatively short. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  through  its  intervention,  can  be  a \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n \n \n \n \n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n  \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpacts and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\ncatalyst  for  additional  finance  for  EVN\u2019s  investment  program.  A \nrobust  and  reliable \ntransmission  network  with  an  enabling \nenvironment  will  attract  increased  private  sector  participation  in \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Policy  dialogue  on \nsafeguard  issues,  and  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  reviewing  and \nproviding  comments  to  refine  EVN\u2019s  environmental  and  social \npolicy  and  procedures,  will  contribute  to  EVN\u2019s  adoption  of  best \npractices  in  safeguard  policies  and  implementation  of  safeguard \nmeasures.  \n \nThrough  its  loan  covenants,  the  proposed  Project  will  further  the \nongoing  power  sector  reforms  to  restructure  EVN  and  create  a \nviable electricity supply industry in Viet Nam, as well as to improve \nconfidence  of  private  sector  investors  in  the  nascent  regulatory \nframework.  \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  northern  transmission  network  to \nimprove  system  reliability,  remove \ntransmission  bottlenecks, \nreduce  transmission  losses,  and  facilitate  efficient  utilization  of \nexisting  and  planned  power  plants.  ADB\u2019s  programmed \ninterventions  in  the  sector  for  2006\u20132010  will  support  power \nsector  reforms  aimed  at  establishing  a  \u201csingle-buyer\u201d  power \nmarket structure and transparent regulation of the sector by 2009. \n \nThe proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance subprojects \nunder  EVN\u2019s  transmission  expansion  program.  The  subprojects \nare  estimated  to  cost  $452.7 million,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, and interest and other charges during construction. \nThis  comprises  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $226.2 million  and  a \nlocal currency cost of $226.5 million equivalent. \n \n\nFinancing Source \n\nADB \nEVN  \n\n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n226.2 \n0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n133.8 \n92.7 \n\n \n\nTotal Project Cost \n\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EVN = Electricity of Viet Nam. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n226.2 \n\n226.5 \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\n360.0 \n92.7 \n\n79.5 \n20.5 \n\n452.7 \n\n100.0 \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $360  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility.

EVN  will  be \nresponsible  for  planning,  designing,  contracting,  testing,  and \ncommissioning the subprojects. For each subproject that has not \nbeen appraised, EVN will submit an appraisal report with an initial \nenvironmental examination report and a resettlement plan (RP) to \nADB  for  approval.  EVN  will  also  provide  ADB  with  half-yearly \nprogress reports for project monitoring. \n \nThe  Project  will  use  the  Northern  Power  Project  Management \nBoard  (NPPMB)  and  the  Central  Power  Project  Management \nBoard  (CPPMB)  as  the  implementing  agencies.  NPPMB  will  be \nresponsible for the upgrading and construction of the 500 kV and \n220 kV  substations  and  transmission  lines,  while  CPPMB  will  be \nresponsible for the 500 kV/220 kV Soc Son station. \n \nElectricity of Viet Nam \n \nEquipment  and  materials  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \nThe  following  consultants  services  are  required:  (i) international \nresettlement  consultants  to  assist  NPPMB  in  preparing  and \nimplementing  the  RPs,  (ii)  international  environmental  consultant \nto  assist  NPPMB  in  implementing  the  environment  management \nplan \nfor \nmonitoring  and  implementing  the  EMP,  and  (iv)  domestic  gender \nspecialist to implement the gender strategy.

The Project will remove \ntransmission  bottlenecks  and \nlosses, \nensuring availability of more electricity for rural electrification.  \n \nThe financial and economic viability of the Project depends on the \nimplementation  of  the  other  components  (ongoing  projects)  of \npower  system  expansion  in  northern  Viet  Nam.  These  include \nsignificant investments in new power generation capacity, as well \nas  transmission  capacity  outside  the  scope  of  the  proposed \nProject.  Mobilization  of  these  investments  requires  concerted \nefforts by EVN and other public sector investors, as well as private \nsector  financing.  EVN  and  the  Government  are  creating  the \nenabling environment by removing entry barriers for private sector \nparticipation  (domestic  and  foreign)  through  proposed  power \nsector  reforms,  as  required  by  the  2004  Electricity  Law.  To \nsupport  the  reforms,  the  Government  established  the  Electricity \nRegulatory Authority in October 2005. \n \nA  potential  concern  is  the  failure  of  the  economy  to  continue \nachieving  its  assumed  economic  growth  rate  of  7.5%.  A  slower \neconomic expansion would lower the growth in electricity demand. \nHowever, the analysis of risks shows that the economic viability of \nthe investment program can withstand extreme adverse changes \nin anticipated economic growth, and in other key risk factors and \nassumptions. \n \nImplementation  delays  and  resettlement  could  create  risks  of \ndelays in the commissioning of power projects under construction \nin northern Viet Nam. These delays would constrain the economic \ngrowth of the northern region. ADB has engaged the Government \nin  policy  dialogue  on  the  environment  and  social  safeguard \nrequirements  for  two  ongoing  hydropower  projects\u2014the  2,400 \nMW  Son  La  Hydropower  Project  (SLHPP)  and  560  MW  Huoi \nQuang  Hydropower  Project  (HQHPP).

To sustain economic growth \nand  continue  reducing  poverty,  Viet  Nam  needs  to  modernize  and  develop  its  physical \ninfrastructure by maintaining an investment level of at least 35% of GDP.  \n \nThe  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS),3  which  the \n3. \nPrime  Minister  approved  in  November  2003,  acknowledges  the  importance  of  large-scale \ninfrastructure  in  achieving  poverty  reduction  through  growth.  It  also  recognizes  the  financing \ngap, and the need for alternative resources, such as the use of ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n(OCR), for selective revenue-earning investment projects in the power and transport sectors. \n \n4. \nDeveloping  an  efficient  and  stable  power  sector  is  essential  to  achieving  the  7.5% \naverage  annual  growth  target  up  to  2010.  Electricity  demand  is  forecast  to  increase  by  15%\u2013\n16% per year between 2004 and 2010, and 12% per year thereafter, fueled by robust economic \ngrowth.  In  2004,  electricity  demand  was  8,283  megawatt  (MW),  while  electricity  consumption \nwas  39.9  terawatt-hours  (TWh).  During  1995\u20132004,  electricity  consumption  increased  more \nthan  threefold  (11.2  TWh  to  39.9  TWh),  and  system  losses  fell  from  21.7%  to  13.5%.  The \nrevised  Fifth  Power  Development  Master  Plan  (PDMP)  for  2001\u201320104  forecasts  electricity \ngeneration to reach 100\u2013112.7 TWh, with peak demand reaching 17,570\u201319,550 MW, in 2010. \n \n5. \nDespite  such  growth  in  electricity  demand,  end-use  consumption  totaled  about  500 \nkilowatt-hours  (kWh)  per  capita  for  2004,  compared  with  an  average  of  about  1,300  kWh  per \ncapita  per  year  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries.  Industrial  and  residential  sectors \naccounted for about 45% of electricity consumption in 2004. Even though the service sector has \nplayed  a  role  in  the  demand  growth,  industry  and  residential  consumption  primarily  are \nresponsible for the growth in electricity demand. Rapid growth in the manufacturing sector drove \nthe  increase  in  industrial  electricity  usage.  Industry\u2019s  share  of  GDP  increased  from  22.6%  in \n1995 to 30.8% in 2004. Industrial electricity demand growth rose by 18.5% during 2001\u20132004, \nand is expected to continue driving demand. \n                                                 \n1   This draft will be approved by the Prime Minister in April 2006. All development partners including ADB, will then \n\nalign their country strategies and program assistance with the approved SEDP. \n\n2   Household  living  standard  surveys  found  that  the  poverty  rate  was  around  58%  in  1993,  37%  in  1998,  29%  in \n\n2002, and is estimated to be 25% in 2005. \n\n3   Government of Viet Nam. November 2003. Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. Viet Nam.  \n4   Ministry of Industry, Government of Viet Nam, 2003. The Sixth Power Development Master Plan is being prepared, \n\nand the Government is expected to approve it in December 2005. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nAn  increase  in  household  access  and  the  addition  of  loads  other  than  basic  lighting \n6. \npushed up residential electricity demand. Between 1995 and 2004, about 30 million new people \nwere  connected,  representing  37%  of  the  population.  Viet  Nam  started  from  a  very  low \nresidential  consumption  level,  which  helped  explain  the  high  growth  rates.  As  disposable \nincomes rose since the mid-1990s, electrical household appliances have increased. The current \naverage consumption of about 20 kWh/month per person among residential electricity users is \nlow, and is likely to increase. \n \nTo meet the electricity demand growth, Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) expects to increase \n7. \nits installed generating capacity from 10,871 MW in 2004 to 22,600 MW by 2010. This means \nadding  about  2,000  MW  per  year  between  2005  and  2010.  This  is  more  than  a  threefold \nincrease  over  the  average  capacity  increase  each  year  during  the  1990s.  In  addition,  high-\nvoltage  and  medium-voltage  transmission  and  distribution  systems  need  to  be  improved \ncommensurately  to  address  transmission  bottlenecks  and  reduce  system  losses.  The  sector \nanalysis is in Appendix 1. \n \nThe  key  challenges  facing  the  power  sector  are  maintaining  adequate  investments  in \n8. \nnew  generating  capacity,  and  expanding  transmission  networks  to  meet  the  rapid  growth  in \nelectricity  demand.  These  are  critical  to  maintaining  the  growth,  competitiveness,  and \nindustrialization of Viet Nam\u2019s economy. The Fifth PDMP, revised in March 2003, states that the \npower sector will require $17.5 billion in investment for 2004\u20132010, comprising $13.0 billion for \ngeneration and $4.5 billion for transmission and distribution. EVN\u2019s internal cash generation can \nprovide only half of the funding requirement. Therefore, official development assistance, private \nsector  investment,  and  domestic  commercial  banks  will  have  to  fill  the  financing  gap.  The \noperational and financial performance of EVN has improved consistently over the past 5 years. \nAlthough the average tariff at around $0.052/kWh is below the long-run marginal cost, the self-\nfinancing ratio and debt service coverage ratio have been maintained. EVN\u2019s financial accounts \nare  strictly  separate  from  the  Government  budget,  and  EVN  receives  no  Government  budget \nsubsidy  support  for  investment  with  the  exception  of  funds  for  resettlement.  The  increased \nborrowing of the sector to finance the large capital investment program will require improvement \nin the sector\u2019s internal cash generation.   \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Policies \n\n \nThe Government recognizes the need to continue sector reforms to meet the challenges \n9. \nfacing the power sector, especially the financing challenge. In recent years, EVN has developed \na  much  greater  commercial  orientation,  and  has  signed  power  purchase  agreements  with  the \nprivate sector for two power generation projects5 with a combined capacity of 1,435 MW under \nthe build, operate, and transfer scheme. The Government\u2019s power sector policy, as stated in the \nnew  Electricity  Law,6  is  to  (i)  develop  a  power  market  on  the  principles  of  transparency  and \ncompetition  to  achieve  economic  efficiency,  (ii)  attract  investments  from  state  and  non\u2013state \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2002.

Manila  (Loan  1923-VIE,  for  $40  million  [loan]  and  $35 \nmillion [partial risk guarantee], approved on 18 October 2003). \n\n6   The new Electricity Law was approved on 3 December 2004 and became effective on 1 July 2005. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\nsectors,  (iii)  encourage  foreign  private  sector  investments,  and  (iv)  ensure  the  rights  of  the \nconsumers and the investors in the sector. To achieve these objectives, the Ministry of Industry \n(MOI) is responsible for establishing a competitive power market for Viet Nam.    \n \n10.  MOI  prepared  the  road  map  for  Electricity  Market  Establishment  and  Development  in \nViet  Nam,  which  envisages  corporate  restructuring  of  EVN  to  establish  the  first  stage  of  the \npower market. The first stage (2005\u20132008) of the power market is to establish an internal pilot \nmarket  for  EVN-owned  power  plants  and  plants  in  which  EVN  holds  a  dominant  share.  The \nexisting  independent  power  producers  (IPP),  and  the  three  strategic  multipurpose  hydropower \nplants, will not take part in the internal power market. The IPPs will dispatch power according to \ntheir  power  purchase  agreements.  During  the  first  stage,  the  following  will  be  developed  and \npiloted: (i) market rules; (ii) regulatory, technical, and commercial institutions; and (iii) capacity \nrequired for operating the second phase (2008\u20132010) of the proposed power market (i.e., single \nbuyer-based competitive generation market with the participation of non-EVN power plants).  \n \n11. \nThe  Government  policy  is  also  to  encourage  the  development  of  independent  power \ngeneration outside of EVN systems. The IPPs\u2019 generating capacity has increased from 620 MW \nin  2002  to  over  2,400  MW  in  2004,  accounting  for  almost  22%  of  the  installed  generating \ncapacity.  Vinacoal  and  PetroVietnam  are  developing  IPPs,  both  wholly  owned  or  as  joint \nventures  with  EVN.  Small  hydropower  plants  are  also  being  development  by  local  firms,  for \nconnection to the grid through power purchase agreements with EVN. \n \n12. \nEVN  will  complete  its  corporate  restructuring  program  by  2008.  EVN\u2019s  internal  power \nmarket is scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2006, with the competitive generation market \nbeginning  in  2009.  The  Electricity  Regulatory  Authority  (ERA)  for  the  power  sector  will  be \nestablished  within  the  MOI  as  a  separate  institution  by  the  end  of  2005  (para.  20).  The \nGovernment is aware of the concern over the degree of independence of the single buyer and \nthe  system  operator  if  EVN  continues  to  own  and  control  a  significant  stake  in  the  equitized7 \npower plants. To mitigate these concerns, transparent rules for market operation, dispatching of \npower  plants,  settlement  of  payments  and  appropriate  regulatory  oversight  will  be  required.  If \nthese conditions cannot be guaranteed, the single buyer and the system operator will have to be \nseparated  from  EVN.  To  address  these  concerns,  the  Government  asked  ADB  to  provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) for designing appropriate market rules and regulatory instruments to \nmake the emerging power market attractive to potential investors.  \n \n13. \nAs  an  active  member  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Power  Sector \nCooperation Program, Viet Nam is financing a 220 kV transmission line linking with Cambodia \nand  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Further,  Viet  Nam  is  planning  power  transmission \ninterconnections  with  other  GMS  countries.  Viet  Nam  has  ratified  the  Inter-Governmental \nAgreement on GMS Power trading, and is a signatory to the memorandum of understanding on \nInitiating Power Trading among GMS countries, which was signed at the Second GMS Summit \nin July 2005. \n \n\n2. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n \n14. \nADB  has  approved  $306.3 million  in  loans  to  the  power  sector  of  Viet  Nam. The  loans \nwere  primarily  for  the  extension  and  rehabilitation  of  high-voltage  transmission  networks  and \nsubstations,  medium-  and  low-voltage  substations,  and  distribution  networks  in  the  northern, \n\n                                                 \n7   Equitized means partial privatization with less than 50% divestization of assets. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\ncentral, and southern regions of the country. In addition, ADB has provided $9.78 million in TA, \ncomprising six project preparatory TAs and 11 advisory TAs (Appendix 2). The recent advisory \nTA  on  the  road  map8  for  power  sector  reform  has  contributed  significantly  to  the  recently \nenacted Electricity Law, and established the framework for a wholesale electricity market. ADB \nalso  has  supported  private  sector  investment  in  power  generation  through  its  private  sector \noperations.  \n \n15. \nThe  other  major  funding  agencies  are  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD), \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  World  Bank,  and  Swedish  International \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida).  AFD  has  cofinanced  Loan  2128-VIE9  with  ADB  for \n\u20ac40  million,  and  will  cofinance  the  proposed  Project.  JBIC,  the  biggest  lender  to  the  power \nsector in Viet Nam, has committed since 1993 approximately $3 billion, or 33.7% of its official \ndevelopment aid (ODA) budget, to Viet Nam. These funds were mainly for gas- and coal-fired \nthermal power plants, hydropower plants, and 500 kV transmission lines. The World Bank has \ncommitted $1.35 billion in loans to the sector for generation, transmission, distribution, and rural \nelectrification.  In  addition,  it  has  provided  TA  in  (i)  power  sector  policy  and  strategy,  (ii) \ninstitutional strengthening, (iii) private sector participation in infrastructure, (iv) gas master plan, \n(v)  petroleum  product  pricing,  (vi)  development  of  the  Electricity  Law,  and  (vii)  promotion  of \nrenewable and rural electrification. \n \nSida, which began supporting the power sector in the 1980s, has committed $103 million \n16. \nin ODA funds (loans and TAs). Its assistance includes the recently equitized (partially privatized) \nSong Hinh (70 MW) multipurpose hydropower project. Sida is financing the rehabilitation of rural \ndistribution  systems  in  selected  provinces.  With  the  Norwegian  Development  Cooperation \nAgency,  Sida  also  is supporting  Viet  Nam\u2019s  preparation  of a  hydroelectric  power  development \nplan. Other bilateral sources of assistance to the sector include Canada, France, Germany, and \nUnited Kingdom. ADB coordinates closely with AFD, JBIC, World Bank, and bilateral donors to \nensure that actions are complementary and policy advice on the sector is consistent.  \n \n \n \n17. \nIn line with the CPRGS, ADB\u2019s strategy for the power sector is to develop infrastructure \nneeded  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the    sector  has  six \nmain  priorities:  (i) supporting  sector  reform,  including  market  restructuring,  and  sector  and \ncorporate governance; (ii) providing institutional strengthening to implement reforms required by \nthe 2004 Electricity Law; (iii) creating an enabling environment for private sector participation in \na  competitive  power  market;  (iv) expanding  and  optimizing  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems; (v) encouraging power interconnections in the GMS by helping Viet Nam to improve its \nhigh-voltage  power  transmission  network;  and  (vi)  encouraging  energy  conservation,  and \nensuring environmental and social sustainability. The Private Sector Operations Department, in \ncoordination  with  Mekong  Department  and  Office  of  Cofinancing  Operations,  is  promoting \npublic-private  partnership  projects  for  mobilizing  private  sector  investments  to  complement \nADB\u2019s investments transparently.  \n \nGiven  the  high  electrification  ratio  of  about  88%,  as well  as the availability of financing \n18. \nfrom  the  World  Bank  for  rural  electrification,  the  financing  gap  in  the  power  distribution \n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy for the Power Sector \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

Further,  the  financial  return  of  remaining  rural  electrification  investments \ndoes not justify financing through OCR. Hence, future ADB investments in the power sector will \nfocus on power generation and transmission.10 ADB has a comparative advantage in expanding \nthe  scope  of  engagement  to  financing  environmentally  sustainable  power  generation  projects, \nand high-voltage transmission lines linking Viet Nam with other GMS countries. The institutional \ncapacity  building  program  under  the  GMS  Regional  Power  Trading  Coordination  Committee \nprovides further opportunities for Viet Nam to participate in the GMS Power Grid. \n \nThe  investment  loans  to  be  financed  with  OCR  will  be  coupled  with  policy  dialogue  to \n19. \nimprove  technical,  financial,  and  economic  viability,  as  well  as  the  social  and  environmental \nsustainability,  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  generation  expansion  programs.  TAs  will  be  targeted  to \nsector  entities,  and  national  and  provincial  enforcement  agencies,  to  improve  their  capacity  to \ndeal with adverse impacts of some of these power generation projects.  \n \n \n \nSince  1995,  ADB  has  engaged  the  Government  and  EVN  in  policy  dialogue  on  power \n20. \nsector  reform  under  its  previous  loans  and  TAs.  The  sector  reform  covenants  have  included \n(i) promulgating  the  Electricity  Law,  (ii) preparing  secondary  laws  or  decrees  to  facilitate \nimplementation  of \nindependent  regulator,  and \n(iv) ensuring  that  EVN  and  its  power  companies11  undertake  steps  to  commercialize  their \noperations  in  line  with  the  recommendations  of  TA  2345-VIE.12  However,  due  to  high-profile \nfailures  of  restructured and  competitive  power markets worldwide,  the Government  proceeded \ncautiously. It spent time examining the most appropriate structure and strategy for power sector \nreform. As a result, the Electricity Law was approved in November 2004 and became effective \non  1  July  2005.  The  Prime  Minister  on  19  October  2005  approved  MOI\u2019s  decision  on  the \nestablishment  of  an  Electricity  Regulatory  Authority  within  MOI.  The  Government  has  directed \nEVN  to  continue  corporatizing13  and  equitizing  (i.e.,  partially  privatizing)  some  of  its  operating \nunits.  \n \n21. \nDespite  the  ambitious  plans  to  divest  a  large  portion  of  EVN-owned  power  plants \nthrough an equitization program, EVN will continue to own fully or partly a large proportion of the \ngeneration capacity during the first and second stages of the power market development. The \ndominant market share of EVN would create apprehensions among new investors. To make the \nemerging  power  market  attractive  to  potential  investors,  these  fears  would  have  to  be \naddressed through appropriately designed market rules and regulatory instruments. The power \nmarket  reform  program  in  Viet  Nam  during  2006\u20132010  comprises  (i) setting  up  the  power \nmarket and developing the market rules for a single buyer market, (ii) establishing the regulatory \nagency  for  the  sector,  (iii)  cooperate  restructuring  of  EVN  to  meet  the  requirement  of  a  single \nbuyer  market,  and  (iv)  procuring  new  generation  capacity consistent with  the  least-cost  power \ndevelopment  plan.  A  proposed  ADB  TA  on  Power  Market  Design  would  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  road  map.  Policy  dialogue  aimed  at  establishing  a  transparent  and \ncompetitive power market in Viet Nam is closely coordinated with AFD, JBIC, and World Bank to \nguide MOI in implementing the road map. AFD is financing a resident advisor to assist MOI in \n\n                                                 \n10  A power sector road map will be prepared in early 2006 based on the updated Sixth PDMP. \n11  Power Company 1, Power Company 2, Power Company 3, Power Company Hanoi, Power Company Ho Chi Minh, \n\nPower Company Haiphong, and Power Company Dong Nai. \n\n12 ADB.  1995.

Decree  197/2004/ND-CP  on  Compensation  Assistance  and  Resettlement  when \nthe  State  Recovers  Land  was  issued  on  3  December  2004.14  In  addition,  EVN  has  taken \nconcrete measures to strengthen its appraisal capacity and construct management departments \nwith full-time staff to handle resettlement issues. The Government has prepared a Master Plan \nfor Hydropower Development with assistance from Sida and Norway. Given the need to ensure \nsuch hydropower development is sustainable, environmentally sound, and sensitive to impacts \nand risks, the Government requested ADB assistance to build the capacity of Ministry of Natural \nResources  and  Environment  (MONRE)  and  EVN  to  undertake  cumulative  impact  assessment \nand strategic environment assessment. The Government also requested assistance to address \nsector-wide  environmental  and  social  issues,  and  to  take  an  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement approach for hydropower projects.  \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \nLoans 135815 and 158516 were closed in 2002 and 2005, respectively. These two loans \n23. \nhad  to  be  extended  due  to  delays  in  procurement,  resettlement,  and  compensation.  However, \nthe  overall  implementation  was  satisfactory  in  terms  of  outputs,  and  most  of  the  financial  and \nsafeguard-related  covenants  were  complied  with.  The  key  lessons  learned  from  these  loans \nwere  the  need  to  ensure  that  (i)  technical  designs  are  completed  before  procurement  of \nequipment and material to match design requirements; (ii) delegation of procurement approval \nto  the  project  management  board  is  obtained;  (iii)  the  process  for  bid  document  approval  and \ncontract award applicable to ADB-financed contracts under the loan is clarified at the outset; (iv) \na satisfactory resettlement plan and framework is in place before loan approval; and (v) specific \nenvironmental requirements (including documentation and reporting) for testing and disposal of \ntransformers are included in loan covenant and bidding documents.   \n \nThe  loan  covenants  on  tariff  reforms  and  sector  reforms  were  not  complied  with  fully. \n24. \nTariff covenants were set at a level above the financial cost recovery tariff, and the Government \ncould not justify increasing tariffs as EVN was meeting the financial ratio covenants. As a result, \nADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  agreed  that  financial  ratios  would  be  used  to  set  the  average \ntariff. These ratios would be based on audited financial statements, which focus on internal cash \ngeneration, such as debt service coverage and self-financing ratios that also indirectly capture \nprofitability.  These  ratios  also  would  capture  the  financing  requirement  of  the  large  capital \nexpenditure program, and the increased returns expected by private investors in the sector. The \nfinancial performance and projections of EVN are in Appendix 3. \n \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB.  2004.

As  a  result,  the  corporate  governance  of  the \nsector has improved. The more recent TA on the road map for power sector reform contributed \nsignificantly to the new Electricity Law, and laid the foundation for the proposed sector reforms \naimed at establishing a wholesale electricity market. ADB is processing an advisory TA to guide \nthe Government in making strategic decisions regarding the (i) market structure; (ii) role of EVN \nand  its  subsidiaries,  and  the  relationship  among  these  entities;  (iii)  nature  of  the  regulatory \nregime and key regulatory mechanisms; and (iv) the terms of power purchase arrangements for \nnew and equitized power plants. \n \nThe Government\u2019s approval process, particularly for project procurement, remains time \n26. \nconsuming,  which  has  led  to  project  implementation  delays.  To  compensate,  the  Project  has \nundertaken  advance  procurement  action.  Moreover,  project  management  responsibilities  have \nbeen delegated to the Northern Power Project Management Board (NPPMB) and Central Power \nManagement  Board  (CPPMB)  to  ensure  smooth  implementation.  As  these  agencies  are \ndependent  units  of  EVN,  EVN\u2014as  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project\u2014will  monitor  and \noversee  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  follow  the  sector  loan  approach,  and  the \nGovernment  has  delegated  the  approval  for  project  procurement  to  EVN  to  expedite \nimplementation.  These  measures  are  expected  to  reduce  procurement  time  greatly  and  avoid \nthe delays experienced in the previous two projects. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n27. \nThe  Project  is  to  (i)  strengthen  the  northern  transmission  network  to  improve  system \nreliability  and  quality  of  supply,  (ii)  facilitate  power  transfers  by  removing  transmission \nbottlenecks, (iii) reduce transmission losses, and (iv) facilitate efficient utilization of existing and \nplanned power plants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 4. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n28. \nThe Project has two major components. Part A focuses on the construction, expansion \nand upgrading of the 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines, enabling the transfer of additional \npower  to  improve  system  reliability  and  enhance  the  efficient  utilization  of  existing  and  new \npower plants in the north. Part B entails the construction, upgrading, and expansion of 500 kV \nand  220  kV  substations.  The  construction  of  a  new  500  kV/220  kV  substation  at  Soc  Son \nprovides  a  strategic  link  between  generation  plants  in  eastern  (thermal)  and  western  (hydro) \nparts of northern Viet Nam and industrial load centers in Hanoi and Haiphong. It also offers the \npotential  for  subsequent  interconnection  with  the  PRC.  This  will  simplify  load  dispatch,  and \nimprove  system  performance  and  system  reliability.  The  candidate  subprojects  are  described \nbriefly in Appendix 5. \n \n29. \nTechnical Justification and Criteria for Subproject Selection. The Institute of Energy \n(IOE)  carried  out  least-cost  generation  expansion  and  long-term  planning  studies  for  the \ncountry,  using  the  integrated  resource  planning  approach  to  ensure  optimum  use  of  the  Viet \nNam\u2019s  resources.  Based  on  these  studies,  EVN  and  IOE  formulated  the  power  transmission \nexpansion network through exhaustive engineering design calculation. EVN and IOE employed \nstate-of-the\u2013art, commercially available power system simulation software packages to perform \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\ndetailed  power  flow  studies,  short-circuit  calculations,  and  dynamic  and  transient  stability \nanalyses.  The  aim  was  to  ensure  a  robust,  yet  optimal,  transmission  network  based  on \ninternationally proven extra-high voltage alternating current transmission technology. \n \nSubproject Selection. To be eligible for selection, a subproject should (i) be technically \n30. \nfeasible,  (ii)  be  part  of  EVN's  revised  Fifth  PDMP  (or  subsequent  revision  thereof),  (iii)  not  be \nclassified  as  category  A,17  and  (iv)  not  include  transmission  lines  emanating  from  power \ngeneration  stations.  Based  on  available  data  and  the  eligibility  criteria,  ADB  and  EVN  jointly \nappraised  the  three  core  subprojects  in  northern  Viet  Nam:  (i)  269  kilometers  (km)  of  double \ncircuit 500 kV transmission lines covering Son  La\u2013Hoa Binh\u2013Nho Quan, (ii) 152 km of double \ncircuit 220 kV transmission lines covering Thanh Hoa\u2013Nghi Son\u2013Vinh, and (iii) expansion of the \nVan Tri 220 kV substation.  \n \n31. \nSelection of addition subprojects after loan approval should satisfy the eligibility criteria \n(para.  30).  Further,  EVN  will  follow  procedures  that  include  (i)  a  technical  feasibility  study  for \neach  subproject,  (ii)  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  that  meets  the  requirements  of  the  resettlement \nframework  (RF),  and  (iii)  an  environmental  assessment  that  follows  the  environmental \nassessment and review procedures specified in the initial environmental examination (IEE). The \ntechnical feasibility study will include a detailed engineering design of the subproject, including \nan  indication  that  this  is  the  least-cost  solution  among  the  alternatives,  cost  estimates, \nprocurement packaging, and an implementation schedule. For each subproject to be appraised, \nEVN will submit an appraisal report to ADB for approval. Appendix 6 provides the format for the \nsubproject appraisal report.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nthe  potential \n\nfor  completion  by  2009.  This  would  create \n\n32. \nSubregional  Context.  Although  not  a  GMS  initiative,  the  Project  will  promote \ncooperation  in  the  subregion.  The  220  kV  transmission  line  from  Tuyen  Quang  to  Yen  Bai, \nscheduled  for  completion  in  2009,  would  link  with  the  Soc  Son  500  kV/220  kV  substation, \nplanned \nfor  robust  power \ninterconnection between Viet Nam and PRC in the future.  \n \nCapacity Building. Based on policy dialogue with the Government (para. 22), EVN will \n33. \nstrengthen the environmental unit to work on resettlement issues. In addition, ADB has engaged \nthe Government in policy dialogue on the environment and social safeguard requirements of the \n2,600 MW Son La Hydropower Project (SLHPP) and 560 MW Huoi Quang Hydropower Project \n(HQHPP), which the Government and EVN are financing.18 The Government welcomed ADB\u2019s \nassistance  in  strengthening  the  capacity  of  MONRE  and  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment  (MARD)  to  address  environmental  and  resettlement  matters  under  the  two \nprojects, as well as sector-wide issues. In this context, three stand-alone advisory TAs are being \nformulated.  The  first  is  to  assist  EVN  in  strengthening  and  improving  the  Environmental \nManagement Plan (EMP) of the proposed SLHPP and HQHPP, and to build EVN\u2019s capacity for \nenvironmental management and watershed management through the implementation of EMPs \ninvolving multiple stakeholders. The second TA, with broader capacity building input, focuses on \nimpact  assessment  and  strategic \nin  cumulative \nstrengthening  MONRE's  capability \n\n                                                 \n17  Category  A  are  projects  with  potential  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  An  environmental  impact \n\nassessment (EIA) is required to address significant impacts. \n\n18  These  two  hydropower  projects  are  estimated  to  cost  $3  billion.  The  first  unit  (600  MW)  of  SLHPP  will  be \ncommissioned in late 2010, second unit in 2011, third and fourth units in 2012. HQHPP will be commissioned in \n2011. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\nenvironmental assessment, mainly for the hydropower subsector. The third TA is to strengthen \nthe  institutional  capacity  for  formulating  and  implementing  a  comprehensive  resettlement  plan \nand livelihood programs for SLHPP. The capacity building will target (i) MARD; (ii) the provinces \nof  Son  La,  Lai  Chau,  and  Dien  Bien;  (iii)  SLHPP;  and  (iv)  local  stakeholders.  The  enhanced \ncapacity  will  help  the  Government  implement  resettlement  plans  and  livelihood  programs  for \nother power projects.  \n \n34. \nSector  Loan.  EVN\u2019s  successful  implementation  of  three  World  Bank  projects  and  two \nADB projects, which supported Power Company 1, Power Company 2, and Power Company 3, \ndemonstrated  its  competence  as  an  executing  agency.  A  sector  loan,  therefore,  is considered \nappropriate  to  finance  a  portion  of  EVN\u2019s  investments  over  the  next  5  years.  With  the  sector \nloan  approach,  ADB  can  support  EVN\u2019s  initiatives  to  improve  power  system  performance  and \nfacilitate  further  sector  reform.  A  sector  loan  approach  will  internalize  the  selection  of \nsubprojects  that  meet  technical,  financial,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  criteria \nappropriate  to  modernizing  the  power  sector.  The  sector  loan  approach  also  will  provide  EVN \nwith sufficient flexibility to utilize ADB financing optimally. \n \nD. \n \n35. \nThe  Project  consists  of  two  main  components:  Part  A,  with  investments  in  500 kV  and \n220 kV transmission lines; and Part B, with investments in 220 kV and 500 kV substations. The \ncost  estimates  of  the  three  core  subprojects  and  additional  subprojects  to  be  implemented \nduring 2006\u20132010 are summarized in Table 1.

The  loan  will  have  (i)  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  (ii)  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility;  (iii)  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  year;  and  (iv)  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement and Project Agreement. EVN has provided \nADB with the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility based \non  these  terms  and  conditions.  Further,  EVN  demonstrated  that  it  made  its  decision \nindependently, without relying on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n37. \nADB  will  finance  79.5%  of  the  estimated  project  cost,  including  100%  of  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  (Table  2).  EVN  will  provide  $92.7 million  equivalent  in  local  currency  as \ncounterpart  financing,  which  accounts  for  20.5%  of  total  costs.  This  will  finance  civil  works, \nresettlement, consultancy, and taxes and duties.  \n \nAlthough  commercial  cofinancing  is  not  envisioned,  cofinancing  from  commercial \n38. \nsources  might  be  mobilized  in  the  future  to  complement  ADB  financing  for  this  sector.  Such \ncofinancing  could  benefit \nincluding  ADB\u2019s  guarantee \nfrom  ADB  credit  enhancements, \ninstruments. These would be presented separately for Board consideration as they arise. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nFinancing Source \nADB \nEVN Counterpart Funding \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n226.2\n0.0\n226.2\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n133.8\n92.7\n226.5\n\nTotal \n\n% \n\n360.0 \n92.7 \n452.7 \n\n79.5 \n20.5 \n100.0 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EVN = Electricity of Viet Nam. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nEVN will be the executing agency responsible for overall implementation of the Project. \n39. \nThe Project will be implemented as a sector loan, and additional subprojects will be introduced \nduring  implementation.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  delegate  the  authority  for  approving \nsubprojects  to  EVN.  Once  approved,  these  subprojects will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  financing \nunder the Project. NPPMB and CPPMB, as the implementing agencies, will be responsible for \nthe  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  500 kV  and  220 kV  project  substations  and  transmission \nlines.  Adequately  staffed  project  offices  have  been  established  in  the  Hanoi  headquarters  of \nNPPMB and CPPMB to supervise the Project. International consultants, working with qualified \ndomestic consultants, will assist NPPMB and CPPMB with environment management planning \nand implementation of resettlement plans.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n40. \nProject  implementation  will  start  in  2006  with  the  recruitment  of  consultants.  Bid \ndocuments  for  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  packages  will  be  prepared  concurrently \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n\nwith technical designs to allow bid documents to be approved quickly. Delivery of equipment will \nbe  phased  to  suit  NPPMB\u2019s  and  CPPMB\u2019s  storage  capacities  and  capability  of  erection \ncontractors.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  June  2010.  The  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n41. \nEquipment and materials to be financed under the loan will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. ICB will be used for supply contracts estimated at more \nthan  $1  million,  while  international  shopping  will  be  used  for  contracts  below  $1  million.  Civil \nworks will be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB) for contract values of up to $3 \nmillion; ICB will be used for contract values more than $3 million (Appendix 9). ADB will review \nand  approve  all  subprojects,  including  those  that  have  not  been  appraised  yet.  The  relevant \nsections  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  will  be  included  in  all  ADB-financed  contracts  during \nbidding. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n42. \nEVN  will  engage  and  finance  about  300  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  for  (i) \ndetailed technical design; (ii) bid preparation and procurement; (iii) construction supervision; (iv) \nimplementing  the  EMPs;  (v)  preparing  and  implementing  the  RPs;  and  (vii)  socioeconomic \nimpact assessment, and project performance monitoring. \n \n43. \nThe ADB loan will finance two international consultants for a total of 10 person-months. \nThe  international  consultants  will  (i)  prepare  subproject  RPs;  (ii)  guide  and  supervise \nresettlement  committees  (RC);  (iii)  train  staff  of  NPPMB,  CPPMB,  and  RCs;  and  (iv)  assist \nNPPMB in the preparation of IEE and environmental management. In addition, ADB will finance \n14  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  to  (i) periodically  monitor  compliance  with  the \napproved  RPs  by  meeting  with  project-affected  people,  RCs,  NPPMB,  and  other  agencies  as \nappropriate,  including  independent  domestic  resettlement  monitoring  consultants;  (ii)  monitor \ncompliance  with  approved  EMP  for  the  subprojects;  and  (iii)  implement  the  gender  strategy. \nNPPMB will recruit the international and domestic consultants as individuals in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The outline terms of reference for the consultants \nare in Appendix 10. The Government requested advance action for recruitment of consultants to \nminimize  front-end  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB  approved  early  recruitment,  and \ninformed the Government that this would not commit ADB to financing the consultants. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n44. \nADB  approved  advance  procurement  for  civil  works  on  18  August  2005  up  to  the \napproval  of  contract  award,  which  covers  the  prequalification  of  contractors,  bidding,  and  bid \nevaluation  for  the  civil  works  contract  packages.  It  does  not  include  awarding  of  contracts, \nhowever.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  procurement  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n45. \nAll disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (January  2001)  and  ADB\u2019s  Interim  Guideline  for  Disbursement \nOperations,  LIBOR-Based  Loan  Products  (July  2002),  both  as  amended  from  time  to  time. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nSince most of the payments will be made for large contracts, direct payment and commitment \nprocedures will be used to withdraw the loan funds.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n46. \nEVN  will  prepare  regular  progress  reports  for  the  Project  and  submit  them  to  ADB \nquarterly.  The  reports  will  include  a  description  of  physical  progress,  difficulties  encountered, \nand a summary of financial accounts for the Project (i.e., project expenditures during the period, \nyear to date, and total to date). EVN will submit the progress reports to ADB within 1 month of \nthe end of the semiannual period. EVN will maintain separate accounts for the Project. Within 6 \nmonths of the close of the financial year, EVN will submit annual audited project accounts and \nannual  audited  financial  statements  of  EVN.  The  annual  financial  statements  will  be \nconsolidated for all of EVN\u2019s operations. The financial management systems and procedures of \nEVN were assessed and found to meet ADB\u2019s requirements (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n47. \nEVN  will  continue  to  engage  independent  auditors  to  audit  its  annual  financial \nstatements and annual project accounts, with the memorandum on issues identified during the \naudit process. These will be submitted with the respective reports. As part of the harmonization \nof  procedures  of  external  funding  agencies,  the  standards  to  be  followed  in  auditing  and \nfinancial  statements  have  been  agreed  upon  with  the  World  Bank.  For  future  contracts  and \nrevisions,  the  auditors\u2019  terms  of  reference  will  be  provided  to  ADB.  The  accounts  will  be \nprepared  using  International  Accounting  Standards,  and  the  audit  will  be  carried  out  using \nInternational Standards of Auditing. The auditors will be required to provide an opinion on EVN\u2019s \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  covenants,  and  indicate  the  details  of  the  calculation  for \nfinancial  ratios  in  the  covenants,  in  conformity  with  the  definitions  contained  in  the  Loan  and \nProject Agreements. \n \n\n8. \n\nAnticorruption  \n\n48. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with, the Government and \nEVN.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and \nbidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  ADB-financed  contracts  for  the  Project  shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nEVN and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the \nProject. To prevent corruption, EVN will establish a supervisory body to prevent interference in \nthe  bidding  processes.  EVN  also  will  hold  regular  briefings  between  NPPMB  and  CPPMB \nmanagement and the local prosecutor\u2019s office, where warnings about, or information on, corrupt \npractices can be assembled and discussed, and appropriate actions taken. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nEVN  will  prepare  progress  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  semiannually.  The  reports \n49. \nwill  provide  a  narrative  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  changes  in  the  implementation \nschedule,  problems  encountered,  performance  of  the  project  implementation  consultants,  and \nthe work to be carried out in the next period. EVN will handle the performance monitoring, which \nwill  be  based  on  performance  indicators/targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework. \n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n50. \nADB  will  field  a  project  inception  mission  soon  after  loan  approval  to  initiate \nimplementation. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on the \nquarterly reports, and will meet with EVN, NPPMB, CPPMB, and the Government semiannually \nto  discuss  project  progress.  A  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  2\u20133  years  after  loan \neffectiveness.  Representatives  of  ADB  and  EVN  will  take  part  in  the  review,  allowing  for  any \nnecessary midcourse corrections to ensure successful project implementation and achievement \nof  objectives.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n51. \nThe  proposed  Project  comprises  individual  subprojects,  including  500 kV  and  220  kV \ntransmission  lines  and  a  series  of  220  kV/500  kV  substations.  These  are  included  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s power sector investment program to meet growing electricity demand in northern \nViet  Nam.  As  these  subprojects  are  not  stand-alone  investments,  the  economic  and  financial \nanalyses  were  based  on  the  least  cost  investment  program  in  power  generation  and \ntransmission  for  the  northern  region  during  2007\u20132015.  The  economic  and  financial  analyses \nare in Appendix 11. \n \n52. \nThe financial and economic viability was examined by comparing the costs and benefits \nof  meeting  demand  growth  from  2007  to  2030  under  the  \u201cwith\u201d  investment  program  scenario \nand  the  \u201cwithout\u201d  investment  program  scenario.  The  \u201cwithout\u201d  investment  program  scenario \nassumes no investments in the north beyond 2007, but accounts for the possibility of meeting \ndemand until 2010 using the spare capacity of the system in 2007. The investment program for \nthe central and southern regions is assumed to continue. The point at which the demand would \nbe  curtailed  on  the  north\u2013south  500  kV  line  is  reached  when  the  incremental  demand  in  the \nnorth is met by power flows from the south in the absence of additional investments in the north \nunder the \u201cwithout case\u201d. \n \n53. \nThe  \u201cwith\u201d  case  assumes  the  planned  investments  will  be  made  during  the  time-slice \n(2007\u20132015).  It  also  assumes  that  any  incremental  sales  at  the  end  of  the  time  slice  would \nrequire additional investments. Hence, financial and economic benefits due to incremental sales \nafter  2015  are  considered  in  the  analysis.  The  economic  and  financial  benefits,  derived  from \ncomparing  the  performance  of  the  power  sector  under  the  \u201cwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  investment \nscenarios, are mainly due to (i) higher sales; (ii) lower transmission losses; and (iii) lower fuel \ncost per unit as the generation and transmission system will be based on the least-cost planning \ncriteria under the \u201cwith\u201d scenario, creating an optimal plant mix. Incremental costs of the \u201cwith\u201d \ncase were evaluated in terms of capital expenditures in generation, load dispatch, transmission, \ndistribution to consumers, and the cost of energy purchased from IPPs. \n \nA. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nThe analysis was conducted for 2005\u20132030, when power plants built during 2004\u20132010 \n54. \nwould  end  their  useful  economic  life.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  investment  program  was \nundertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant  2004  prices.  The  cost  estimates  and  financial \nprojections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects \nof  foreign  and  domestic  inflation,  as  well  as  for  currency  fluctuations.  Incremental  costs  and \nbenefits  attributable  to  the  investment  program  during  2007\u20132015  were  derived  by  comparing \nEVN under \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  investment  program,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  14.1%.  This  compares  favorably \nwith EVN\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for this period, which is 6.9% computed on \nan  after-tax  basis.  When  discounted  at  WACC,  the  proposed  investment  program  has  a  net \npresent  value  (NPV) of  D52.5  trillion.  The  investment  program  is  considered  financially  viable \nand sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRR for each component and \nthe  investment  program  overall  are  robust  with  (i)  reduced  sales  growth  of  12%\u20136%,  (ii)  20% \nincrease in capital costs, (iii) 20% reduction in willingness to pay, (iv) no tariff increase in 2007, \nand (v) 20% increase in operational and maintenance cost.   \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n55. \nThe  economic  viability  of  the  investment  program  was  analyzed  based  on  incremental \ncosts and benefits, as compared with the \u201cwithout\u201d investment scenario. The economic benefits \nof meeting incremental electricity demands were valued based on willingness to pay and tariffs \nfor  each  consumer  category.  A  domestic  price  numeraire  was  used  in  the  economic  analysis, \nand a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 was applied to all costs and benefits valued at border \nprices.  This  shows  that  the  investment  program  yields  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) of more than 23.1%. A sensitivity analysis was conducted with respect to key risks and \nassumptions. The result showed that the investment program is economically worthwhile even \nunder combined extreme adverse conditions. The risk analysis showed that the risk of project \nfailure  is  negligible  (Appendix  11).  In  addition,  a  distribution  analysis  was  carried  out  by \nallocating  the  difference  between  economic  and  financial  benefits  and  costs  to  different \nstakeholders to identify the economic impacts or distortions in the sector. The tariffs for different \nconsumer categories were compared with the relevant long-run marginal cost of supplying these \nconsumers to identify further the cross-subsidies and other distortions in the sector.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nThe poverty analysis for the Project identified issues and assessed impacts at the sector \n56. \nlevel, since identifying specific consumers was difficult. The share of households connected to \nthe grid was 88%, and the majority of the poor are connected. Connection rates in the project \nareas  ranged  from  75%  to  95%.  These  high  connection  rates  imply  that  investments  in \ntransmission  will  benefit  poor  consumers  directly  across  the  economy  by  improving  quality  of \nsupply  and  electricity  services.  Improved  quality  of  services  will  reduce  the  cost  of  repair  and \nrepurchase  of  appliances,  as  well  as  improve  the  quality  of  lighting.  Higher  quality  of  supply \nimplies  substantial  welfare  impacts  for  poor  households.  From  the  household  perspective, \nhowever,  a  reduction  in  electricity  expenditure  and  increased  value  of  leisure  are  significant. \nLower  electricity  expenditure  releases  household  funds  for  food,  health,  and  education.  Most \nnew  residential  consumers  are  expected  to  be  poor.  The  majority  of  benefits  to  the  poor  are \nexpected  to  come  from  increasing  demand  for  labor,  resulting  from  improved  services  to \nindustrial  and  commercial  sectors  in  urban  and  semi-urban  areas.  The  analysis  indicates  that \nthese  sectors  will  grow  substantially  in  the  medium  term.  Remittances  from  migrant  labor  will \nincrease welfare and reduce vulnerability of rural households.  \n \nD. \n \n57. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  two  RPs  prepared  for  the  core  subprojects \nwere based on a preliminary technical design. The transmission routes were realigned to avoid \ndensely  populated  areas  and  minimize  resettlement  impacts.  The  40-meter  wide  transmission \nline corridor will require relocation of about 254 households, of which 43 do not have sufficient \nresidential  land  to  rebuild  their  houses.  Therefore,  these  households  will  be  provided  with \n\nImpacts \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\nanother plot of residential land  within the commune.  For the tower foundations, the  number  of \naffected households and level of impacts are not known, as the locations of the towers will not \nbe determined until the detailed design stage. The Summary Resettlement Framework and Plan \nis in Appendix 12. The full resettlement framework and resettlement plans are in Supplementary \nAppendixes B and C, respectively. \n \n58. \nSatisfactory  resettlement  planning  and  implementation  will  mitigate  adverse  impacts. \nThis will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, as well as \nthe  RPs  and  the  RF  adopted  for  the  Project.  The  objective  is  to  improve,  or  at  least  restore, \nliving  standards,  income-earning  capacity,  and  production  levels  of  affected  people.  Special \nassistance will be provided to the severely affected and vulnerable people to help them improve \ntheir  socioeconomic  status.  A  gender  analysis  for  the  affected  household  is  included  in  the \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy in Appendix 13. \n \nEnvironment.  The  Project  is  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  sensitive.19  A  summary  IEE  was \n59. \nprepared, circulated to the Board, and uploaded to the ADB Web site on 10 August 2005. The \nIEE  includes  a  section  on  the  candidate  subproject  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework, with the environmental selection criteria. The sample substations and transmission \nline  will  not  be  in  or  traverse  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Land  acquisition  will  create \nsome  unavoidable  impacts  along  the  route  of  the  two  transmission  lines,  though  anticipated \nimpacts are considered manageable with adequate mitigation measures. The IEE provides an \nEMP  to  reflect  best  practices,  which  will  ensure  that  the  contractors  adequately  monitor  and \nmitigate  the  impacts.  The  contractors,  under  the  supervision  of  EVN  during  construction,  will \nimplement  the  EMP,  which  will  be  developed  during  the  detailed  design  phase.  Institutional \narrangements  for  conducting  and  monitoring  the  EMP  also  are  provided  in  detail  in  the  IEE. \nPublic  consultations  on  project-related  environmental  issues  have  been  carried  out  in  each \nprovince,  and  will  continue  into  the  implementation  phase  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  not \nconsider category A subprojects.  \n \n60. \nSocial and Gender. The Project will address capacity building at the grassroots level to \nincrease  the  role  of  the  community  in  resettlement  monitoring  and  implementation.  The  social \nand gender strategy in the Summary of Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix  13) \nincludes capacity building for commune and villages leaders (men and women), leaders of mass \norganizations, and members of affected households. The increased community participation will \nfacilitate  implementation  of  Government  decrees,20  which  aim  to  increase  the  role  of  the \ncommunity  in  supervising  and  monitoring  investments  made  in  the  interest  of  the  community. \nIncreased  capacity  at  the  community  level  will  ensure  its  role  in  commune  investment \nsupervisory  groups  and  grassroots  democracy  board.  Decree  80  specially  provides  the \ncommunity  with  opportunities  to  monitor  the  implementation  and  evaluate  the  results  of  the \ninvestment  decision, \nimpacts,  and  resettlement  activities.  The \nincreased  capacity  of  the  commune  leaders  and  mass  organizations  will  enable  effective \nimplementation of the RP\u2019s socioeconomic support program. The sexually transmitted disease \n\nincluding  environmental \n\n                                                 \n19  Projects judged to have some advance environmental impacts, but of lesser degree of significance than those for \ncategory A projects. An initial environmental examination (IEE) is required to determine whether or not significant \nenvironmental  impacts  warranting  an  EIA  are  likely.  If  an  EIA  is  not  needed,  the  IEE  is  regarded  as  the  final \nenvironmental assessment report. \n\n20  Decree  No.  79/2003/ND\u2013CP,  issued  on  7  July  2003,  relates  to  Promulgating  the  Regulation  on  the  Exercise  of \nDemocracy  in  Communes.  Decree  No.  80/2005/ND-CP,  issued  on  22  June  2005,  relates  to  Assignment,  Sale, \nBusiness Contracting and Lease of State Companies. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n(STD)/HIV/AIDS21  and  trafficking  awareness  campaign  will  be  included  in  the  civil  works \ncontracts.  \n \n61. \nEthnic Minority. Ethnic minorities make up between 26% and 66% of the population in \nthe subproject areas. The majority lives in the area of the Son La\u2013Nho Quan transmission line. \nThe largest ethnic groups in the project area are the Muong and Thai, with smaller populations \nof H\u2019mong, Dao, Kho Mu, and Sinh Mun. The ethnic minorities live in mixed villages with Kinh \nhouseholds.  Like  the  Kinh,  they  work  in  wetland  agriculture.  Social  analysis  shows  that  these \nethnic minorities are not any more vulnerable to the risks associated with resettlement and the \nspread  of  HIV/AIDS  than  Kinh  households.  Resettlement  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through \nspecific measures in the RF, RP, and gender strategy prepared for the Project. The STD/HIV/ \nAIDS  prevention  and  awareness  programs  in  the  civil  works  contracts  will  mitigate  the  health \nrisks. \n \nE. \n\nRisks \n\nCompensation,  resettlement,  and  income  restoration  measures  might  not  be  delivered \n62. \nas agreed, thereby impoverishing affected people and delaying the start of civil works. NPPMB \nand  CPPMB  will  have  specialists  to  assist  in  implementing  the  RPs,  and  they  will  engage  an \nindependent monitoring organization. \n \n63. \nThe  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the  proposed  Project  depends  on  the \nimplementation of the other components of the power system\u2019s expansion in northern Viet Nam. \nThese include significant investments in new power generation capacity, as well as transmission \ncapacity outside the scope of the proposed Project. EVN and other public sector investors, as \nwell  as  the  private  sector,  must  make  concerted  efforts  to  mobilize  financing  and  successfully \nimplement  these  projects.  EVN  and  the  Government  are  expected  to  create  the  enabling \nenvironment through proposed power sector reforms that remove entry barriers for third parties. \n \n64. \nThe  financial  projections  for  EVN  have  been  prepared  on  the  assumption  that \noperational efficiency gains, proceeds from equitization, and tariff increases will be implemented \nin  a  timely  manner  to  ensure  EVN\u2019s  compliance  with  financial  covenants.  If  the  underlying \nassumptions  on  fuel  cost,  cost  of  power  purchased  from  IPPs,  and  shift  in  the  consumer  mix \ndeteriorate  from  the  assumed  values,  the  required  tariff  increases  would  need  to  be  adjusted. \nThe  sensitivity  of  financial  ratios  used  as  financial  covenants  to  the  adverse  movements  of \nthese  assumptions  was  assessed.  This  is  especially  important  in  the  context  of  proposed \nreforms  that  would  introduce  limited  competition  in  power  generation  under  a  single-buyer \nmarket structure. Establishing a regulatory body under the proposed Electricity Law with powers \nto  set  tariffs  transparently  on  sound  economic  and  financial  grounds  will  mitigate  this  risk \nsignificantly. \n \n65. \nSignificant  private  investments  in  new  projects,  as  well  as  in  acquiring  EVN-owned \npower plants (i.e., equitization), has been assumed. The financial proceeds from selling equity \nstakes  also  will  make  a  significant  contribution  to  EVN\u2019s  cash  flows.  The  assumption  that  the \neconomy  will  continue  to  grow  at  7.5%  is  a  potential  concern.  Slower  economic  growth  would \nreduce  the  rate  of  growth  in  electricity  demand. However,  the  analysis  of  risks  shows  that  the \neconomic  viability  of  the  investment  program  would  withstand  extreme  adverse  changes  in \nanticipated economic growth, and in other key risk factors and assumptions. \n\n                                                 \n21  HIV/AIDS means human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\nThe  risks  to  ADB  are  that  the  environment  and  social  mitigation  measures  for  the \n66. \nSLHPP and HQHPP will not be implemented effectively. Environmental and social due diligence \nfor  the  SLHPP  and  HQHPP  was  conducted.  Its  direct  and  cumulative  impacts  have  been \nexamined to understand more fully the risks associated with the proposed Project. Summaries \nof the findings are in Appendix 14 and Appendix 15, while the full due diligence reports are in \nSupplementary Appendixes D and E.  \n  \n67. \nThe EMP for the SLHPP needs to be strengthened. ADB will provide assistance to EVN \nto  improve  and  implement  the  EMP.  EVN  is  committed  to  completing  the  environment  impact \nassessments  (EIA)  process  of  the  SLHPP  and  implementing  its  EMP,  with  monitoring  reports \nregularly  submitted  to  ADB  for  review.  TA  will  be  provided  to  EVN  and  MONRE  to  build  their \ncapacity for cumulative and strategic environmental assessments to address sector-wide issues \nin  the  longer  term.  In  addition,  the  resettlement  planning  and  implementation  of  livelihood \nprograms for 95,000 people to be displaced by the Project is weak. A capacity building TA will \nhelp  MARD  and  provincial  RCs  improve  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the  sustainable \nlivelihood program for resettlers. \n \n68. \nHealth  Risks.  The  Project  will  increase  the  potential  for  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDs  and \nother STDs due to the influx of workers during construction. This potential will be mitigated or \nminimized through a program to increase awareness and provide preventive measures for the \nlocal communities and the workforce. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n69. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\nSector  restructuring.

EVN,  through  NPPMB  and  CPPMB,  will \nengage and mobilize (a) resettlement specialist consultants to assist in preparing \nand implementing the RPs, and (b) an independent monitoring organization prior \nto commencement of any land acquisition activities. The Government will cause \nEVN and NPPMB to ensure that (a) the resettlement plan is carried out promptly \nand  efficiently  in  accordance  with  all  Government  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement, and the approved RF; (b) all affected people \nare  given  adequate  opportunity  to  participate  in  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation;  (c)  the  affected  people  are  compensated  and  assisted  prior  to \ndisplacement from their houses, land, and assets such that they will be at least \nas  well  off  as  they  would  have  been  in  the  absence  of  the  Project;  (d) \nimplementation  of  the  RP  is  monitored  by  NPPMB  and  CPPMB,  and  provincial \npeople\u2019s  committee,  and  by  the  independent  monitor,  and  related  reports  are \nsubmitted  to  ADB  and  EVN  as  stipulated  in  the  resettlement  plan;  and  (e)  the \nRPs  for  nonappraised  subprojects  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nagreed  RF,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  being \ndisclosed to the affected people. EVN will ensure that (a) funds needed for land \nacquisition and resettlement are allocated and disbursed in a timely manner; (b) \nthe  RP  is  updated  and  submitted  to  ADB  within  3  months  of  completing  the \ndetailed  measurement  surveys;  and  (c)  ADB  is  promptly  advised  of  any \nsubstantial changes in the resettlement impacts and, if necessary, a revised RP \nis submitted to ADB for concurrence. \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  SLHPP  and  HQHPP.  For  these \nhydropower  projects,  the  Government  will  cause  MARD  and  the  provincial \nresettlement  committees  to  carry  out  the  resettlement  plans  and  sustainable \nlivelihood  programs  in  compliance  with  Special  Decision  459/2004  of  the  Prime \nMinister.  \n\nSocial  unit.  EVN  will  strengthen  its  Appraisal  and  Construction  Management \nDepartment  with  additional  staff  to  handle  resettlement  matters  on  a  full-time \nbasis within 3 months of the date of project approval. The unit will be responsible \nfor  social  and  environmental  issues,  particularly  resettlement  planning  and \nmanagement,  ethnic  minority  development  planning  and  management, \nSTD/HIV/AIDS  awareness  program,  and,  poverty  and  social \nimpact \nassessments.  \n\nEnvironment.  EVN  will  ensure \nthe  subprojects  are  designed, \nthat  (a) \nconstructed,  operated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  the  environmental \nlaws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and  the  Environmental  Policy  of  ADB; \n(b)  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  is  applied  for  each \nfuture candidate subproject prepared for submission to ADB for approval prior to \nsubproject approval; (c) the EMP and the mitigation measures included therein, \nas specified in the IEE prepared for the Project, are implemented properly; (d) for \na \u201cB\u201d sensitive subproject, a summary IEE will be prepared and made available \nto the general public at least 120 days before the subproject is approved; (e) no \ncategory \u201cA\u201d subprojects will be included in the Project for consideration; (f) any \nenvironmental permits, licenses, and clearances are obtained in a timely manner; \n(g)  any  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  that  may  arise  from  the  project \nimplementation  activities  is  mitigated  promptly  or  minimized  in  accordance  with \nthe  EMP;  and  (h)  implementation  of  the  EMP,  including  any  safety  breaches, \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\nviolation  of  environmental  standards,  and  corrective  measures  taken  thereto,  is \nreported semiannually to ADB. \n\n \n(viii)  EMP  for  SLHPP  and  HQHPP.  EVN  will  ensure  that  these  hydropower  projects \nare  constructed  and  commissioned  in  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations  of \nthe  Government.  EVN  will  implement  the  EMPs  for  SLHPP  and  HQHPP, \nincluding the downstream impacts management programs.    \n\nPoverty reduction. EVN, through NPPMB, will ensure that civil works contracts \nwith  contractors  will  have  provision  to  maximize  employment  of  local  poor \npersons  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements  for  construction  of  the \ntransmission lines and substations. Such workers will be provided adequate on-\nthe-job training.  \n\nOther  social  issues.  EVN  will  ensure  that  all  contracts  under  the  Project \nincorporate provisions to the effect that contractors (i) comply with all applicable \nlabor  laws  and  related  international  treaty  obligations,  and  so  not  employ  child \nlabor;  (ii)  provide  safe  working  conditions  for  male  and  female  workers;  (iv) \nimplement  the  provisions  set  forth  in  the  project-specific  Gender  Strategy \nreferred to in Section D of the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy  \n(Appendix 13); and (v) carry out the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking education and \nawareness campaign in the campsites and corridors of influence, in coordination \nwith international and national agencies working on this issue. \n\n \n(xii)  Counterpart  funds.  EVN  will  ensure  the  provision  of  adequate  counterpart \n\nfunding, including actual costs of resettlement. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n70. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $360,000,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof  Viet  Nam  for  the  Northern  Power  Transmission  Expansion  Sector  Project  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nand Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n29 November 2005 \n \n\n      Haruhiko Kuroda \n            President \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \nA. \n\nSector Overview \n\nSECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nViet Nam is well endowed with energy resources, comprising hydropower, natural gas, \n1. \npetroleum,  coal,  and  biomass.  The  hydropower  potential  of  the  country  is  estimated  to  be \nbetween 50,000 and 70,000 megawatt (MW), though only 4,198 MW has been developed. An \nadditional 8,000 MW of hydropower is expected to be developed during 2005\u20132012. Viet Nam is \na net exporter of petroleum products, amounting to 150,000 barrels per day (bbl/day). Viet Nam \nalso  has  415  billion  cubic  meters  (cm3)  of  proven  reserves  of  natural  gas,  with  current \nproduction  of  5  billion\u20137  billion  cm3  per  year.  Proven  coal  reserves  total  3.8  billion  tons,  with \ncurrent output of about 27 million tons per annum.  Power generation uses more than 90% of \nViet Nam\u2019s natural gas production and 4 million tons of coal per annum.  \n \n2. \nElectricity  of  Viet  Nam  (EVN),  formed  in  1995,  is  a  vertically  integrated  state-owned \ncorporation responsible for Viet Nam\u2019s power sector. EVN is organized as a strategic business \nunit  with  generation  units  (i.e.,  plants  with  a  capacity  of  more  than  60  MW)  and  power \ntransmission  (i.e.,  the  transmission  facilities  of  at  least  110  kilovolt  (kV))  as  dependent \naccounting  units  (i.e.,  cost  centers),  and  power  distribution  as  independent  accounting  units \n(i.e.,  profit  centers).  Three  power  companies  (PC1,  PC2,  and  PC3)  are  responsible  for  power \ndistribution  in  northern,  southern,  and  central  parts  of  the  country.  Four  power  distribution \ncompanies operate in four major cities: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, and Dong Nai. The \nBoard  of  Management  of  EVN  is  responsible  for  overall  business  management,  and  has  the \nauthority  to  approve  the  business  plan  of  EVN,  approve  new  investments,  and  procure  items \nbelow  limits  set  by  the  Prime  Minister.  The  Ministry  of  Industry  (MOI)  is  responsible  for  policy \nand oversight of the power sector. A separate regulatory body for the sector does not exist.  \n \n3. \n \n\nThe power generation mix in Viet Nam is summarized in the Table A1.1.  \n\nTable A1.1: Power Generation Mix in Viet Nam \n\nType of Plant \n\nAvailable Capacity \n(MW) \n\nOf which IPP  \n(MW) \n\nHydro \nCoal \nNatural Gas  \nFurnace Oil   \nDiesel \n \n\nTotal \n\n         4,228 \n         1,255 \n         4,460 \n            682 \n            246 \n       10,871 \n\n0   \n\n \n100   Vina Coal \n\n1,435   Phu My 2.2 and Phu My3 \n497   Hiep Phuoc and Nomura \n\n0 \n2,032 \n\n \n \n\n        IPP = independent power producer, MW = megawatt. \n \n  \n\n   Source: Institute of Energy, Viet Nam. \n\n4. \nEVN\u2019s  transmission  network  consists  of  a  500  kilovolt  (kV)  single  circuit  backbone  line \nfrom north to south, and 220 kV and 110 kV network connecting the load centers and most of \nthe  power  plants.  The  larger  power  complexes  are  directly  connected  to  the  500  kV  network. \nThe north\u2013south 500 kV transmission link is being converted to double circuit, while two 500 kV \nrings are planned in the north and south to connect the proposed large power plants to the load \ncenters. The ongoing transmission augmentation aims mainly to complete the 500 kV and 220 \nkV  ring,  and  upgrade  the  220  kV/500  kV  substations  around  Hanoi,  Hai  Phong,  and  Ho  Chi \nMinh City to meet the rising demand.   \n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nThe  power  companies  purchase  bulk  power  from  EVN  at  administratively  fixed  bulk \n5. \npower tariffs at the 110 kV level or at medium voltage (i.e., 35 kV and 22 kV). EVN sets the bulk \nprice tariffs to enable each power company to achieve a reasonable profit irrespective of its cost \nstructure.  The  power  companies  directly  supply  electricity  to  industrial,  commercial,  and  other \nconsumers  and  the  residential  consumers  in  urban  areas.  By  the  end  of  2004,  95%  of \ncommunes and 88% of households had access to electricity, compared with 62% of communes \nand 50% of households in 1995. Under Viet Nam\u2019s unique approach to rural electrification, EVN \nprovides  a  medium-voltage  connection  to  the  commune  center,  and  the  local  community  and \nthe households mobilize funds to install and operate the low-voltage grid. The low-voltage grids \nare  designed  poorly  and  have  high  distribution  losses  (up  to  20%\u201330%),  which  the  national \nsystem loss figures do not capture. The end-user tariffs in rural areas, which are not regulated \nnationally, range from D700 to D900 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) (i.e., $0.044\u2500$0.056/kWh)\u2014two to \nthree times the urban residential tariffs.  \n \n6. \nElectricity  generation  in  Viet  Nam  has  grown  at  annual  compounded  rate  of  13.7% \nduring  1995\u20132004.  Since  2000,  the  annual  growth  rate  has  exceeded  14.9%.  Electricity \ngeneration  doubled  from  23.7  terawatt-hours  (TWh)  in  1999  to  46.2  TWh  in  2004.  With  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  forecasted  to  grow  faster  than  7.5%  a  year  for  2005\u20132010,  and \nindustrial  output\u2019s  share  of  GDP  increasing,  the  rise  in  electricity  demand  is  expected  to \ncontinue. Electricity use in Viet Nam is growing from a very low base for a country of its size. In \n1995, power sales of 11,185 gigawatt-hour (GWH) amounted to only 156 kWh per person per \nyear.  Even  after  electricity  use  grew  more  than  threefold  during  1996\u20132004,  total  end-use \nconsumption amounted to only about 500 kWh per capita per year.   \n\n \n\nThe  operational  and  financial  performance  of  EVN  has  improved  consistently  over  the \n7. \npast  5  years.  The  transmission  and  distribution  losses  were  reduced  to  12.2%  in  2005, \ncompared with more than 21% in 1995, and the receivables are maintained at around 20 days. \nThe average tariff at around $0.052/kWh is below the long-run marginal cost (LRMC), which is \nestimated to be around 7.5 cents/kWh. Still, the self-financing ratio and debt service coverage \nratio  have  been  maintained  within  the  prudential  limits  without  explicit  fiscal  subsidies.  The \nincreased borrowing requirement of the sector to finance the large capital investment program \nwill require further improvements in internal cash generation of the sector. The average tariff will \nhave  to  be  increased  to  $0.06/kWh  by  2010.  The  Government  also  intends  to  mobilize  a \nsignificant portion of the resources required for new investments by divesting (i.e., equitization) \npower assets. The proposed power market is expected to provide investors in divested power \nplants,  as  well  as  in  greenfield  power  plants,  adequate  comfort  without  resorting  to  explicit \nGovernment guarantees.  \n \nB. \n\nSector Reforms  \n\nThe power sector policy, as enunciated in the new Electricity Law, is to develop a power \n8. \nmarket on the principles of transparency and competition to (i) achieve economic efficiency, (ii) \nattract  state  and  nonstate  investors  to  the  sector,  and  (iii)  ensure  the  legitimate  rights  of  the \nconsumers  and  investors  in  the  sector.  Further,  the  new  law  states  that  the  Government\u2019s \nmonopoly  in  the  sector  would  be  limited  to  power  transmission,  national  load  dispatch,  and \nstrategically important large power plants. Power distribution and nonstrategic power generation \nwill  be  open  to  private  investors.  The  law  specifically  encourages  foreign  private  investments, \nand joint ventures between foreign investors and domestic enterprises in the power sector. To \nachieve  these  objectives,  MOI  is  responsible  for  establishing  a  competitive  power  market  for \nViet Nam.    \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nThe  Road  Map  for  Electricity  Market  Establishment  and  Development,  which  MOI \n9. \nprepared,  envisages  the  corporate  restructuring  of  EVN  to  establish  the  necessary  conditions \nfor initiating the first stage of the power market. The first stage entails establishing an internal \npilot market for EVN-owned power plants and the power plants in which EVN holds a dominant \nshare.  The  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  and  three  strategic  multipurpose  hydropower \nplants  will  not  take  part  in  the  internal  market.  The  IPPs  will  be  dispatched  according  to  the \npower purchase agreements (PPA). During the first stage, the following will be developed and \npiloted: (i) market rules; (ii) regulatory, technical, and commercial institutions; and (iii) capacity \nrequired for operating the second phase (2008\u20132010) of the proposed power market (i.e., single \nbuyer-based  competitive  generation  market  with  the  participation  of  non-EVN  power  plants). \nThe  EVN  internal  power  market  is  expected  to  start  in  late  2005,  with  competitive  generation \nmarket beginning in 2009.  \n \n10. \nEVN-owned  power  plants  would  be  converted  into  independent  accounting  units  (i.e., \nprofit centers), and some would be equitized (i.e., partially privatized). However, the three large \nmultipurpose  hydropower  projects  with  a  combined  capacity  of  3,000  MW  (30%  of  installed \ncapacity)  would  be  retained  as  dependent  units  of  EVN.  As  the  first  step  in  the  equitization \nprogram,  a  135  MW  hydropower  plant  and  a  provincial  distribution  utility  were  equitized  (i.e., \npartially privatized with more than 51% equity stake retained by EVN). Two other power plants, \nincluding the 1,000 MW Pha Lai coal power plant, are expected to be equitized by the end of \n2005. The equitization of five more power plants and 15 provincial distribution utilities has been \nproposed  for  2006,  and  EVN\u2019s  ownership  in  the  equitized  entities  would  be  reduced  to  51%\u2013\n60%.  \n\nThe four transmission units, which are structured as dependent units of EVN, would be \n11. \nmerged to form a wholly owned EVN subsidiary to own and operate the transmission network. \nEVN\u2019s  stakes  in  the  equitized  provincial  distribution  utilities  would  be  held  through  the  seven \nregional  power  companies.  These  regional  power  companies  would  be  converted  from \nindependent  accounting  units  to  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  of  EVN.  The  provincial  distribution \nutilities will be equitized, with the regional power companies holding EVN\u2019s equity stake in the \nutilities.  A  market-based  transfer  pricing  mechanism  will  replace  the  administratively  fixed \ntransfer  pricing  between  EVN\u2019s  transmission  unit  and  the  regional  power  companies.  The \nprovincial  power  utilities  supplying  rural  and  mountainous  provinces  will  be  provided  with  an \nexplicit  and  transparent  subsidy  funded  through  a  universal  service  charge.  EVN\u2019s  corporate \nrestructuring program is expected to be completed by 2008. \n \nThe Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) for the power sector would be established as \n12. \na  separate  institution  within  the  MOI.  The  key  functions  of  ERA  during  the  first  and  second \nstages include (i) issuing and enforcing licenses to sector entities; (ii) advising the minister on \nmarket  structure  and  industry  restructuring  policy;  (iii)  establishing  the  principals  for  setting \ntariffs,  including  transfer  pricing  between  sector  entities;  (iv)  developing  tariffs  for  regulated \nactivities;  (v)  approving  power  purchase  agreements  of  the  single  buyer;  (vi)  ensuring  the \nprocurement  of  adequate  new  generation  and  transmission  capacity;  (vii)  monitoring  the \nprogress  of  implementation  of  new  generation  and  transmission  projects;  and  (viii) monitoring \nthe functioning of power market. The law does not clearly define the enforcement mechanism of \nregulatory  actions,  though  the  official  decision  establishing  the  regulator  would  clarify  the \nenforcement powers of ERA. \n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\nSector Focus  \n\nC. \n \n13. \nSocially  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  economic  growth  is  a  pillar  of  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB\u2019s)  country  strategy  for  Viet  Nam.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  success  is \nreducing poverty and improving the living conditions of its population was based on rapid and \nequitable economic growth, underpinned by a transition to a market-based economy with strong \nlinks  to  global  markets.  The  competitiveness  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy,  especially  the  industrial \nsector,  depends  on  the  availability  of  cheap  and  reliable  electricity.  In  this  context,  the \nGovernment has indicated its desire to borrow from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) for \nrevenue-earning  investment  projects.  The  first  OCR-funded  project  was  approved  in  2004. \nSimilarly, future ADB investments in the power sector would be financed by OCR. Viet Nam has \nnot  indicated  interest  in  obtaining  public  sector ADB  financing  or  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nnon-power  energy  subsectors,  such  as  coal,  natural  gas,  and  oil.  However,  the  proposed \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Energy Sector Strategy would provide an opening for ADB to \nengage the Government on policy dialogue aimed at shared development and regional trading \nof Viet Nam\u2019s fossil fuel resources.   \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s involvement in the power sector has been limited to financing power transmission \nand  distribution  projects,  and  providing  TA  for  power  reforms  and  commercialization  of  power \nentities.  Given  the  high  electrification  rate  of  Viet  Nam  and  the  availability  of  $450  million  in \nfinancing  from  World  Bank\u2019s  Rural  Energy  I  and  II  Projects,  the  financing  gap  in  the  power \ndistribution  sector  is  small.  Further,  the  financial  return  from  the  remaining  rural  electrification \ninvestments  does  not  justify  financing  through  OCR.  Hence,  future  ADB  investments  in  the \npower  sector  will  be  focused  on  power  generation  and  transmission.  ADB  has  a  comparative \nadvantage  in  expanding  the  scope  of  engagement  to  financing  environmentally  sustainable \npower  generation,  and  high-voltage  transmission  lines  linking  Viet  Nam  with  other  GMS \ncountries. The institutional capacity building program envisaged under the GMS Regional Power \nTrading  Coordination  Committee  would  offer  additional  opportunities  to  assist  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  GMS  power  grid.  As  ADB  has  committed  substantial  resources  to  the \nexpansion  of  the  500  kV  transmission  network  in  Viet  Nam  through  Loan  2128-VIE1  and  the \nproposed  Northern  Power  Transmission  Expansion  Sector  Project,  future  ADB  investments  in \nthe transmission will concentrate on establishing the critical transmission links in the proposed \nGMS power network. This includes the proposed Viet Nam\u2013Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\u2013\nThailand  500  kV  transmission  line,  and  the  Viet  Nam\u2013People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  500  kV \ntransmission  line.  TA  for  the  former  is  being  implemented,  while  the  latter  is  being \nconceptualized.  \n \n15. \nADB  financing  for  the  national  projects  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector  during  2007\u20132010 \nprobably will be focused on power generation, which requires large investments. The first would \nbe the 155 MW Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project, which is being prepared. The Government\u2019s \nstrategy in power generation is to undertake large hydropower projects with storage (i.e., more \nthan  100  MW)  as  public  sector  projects.  Small  hydropower  projects  are  offered  to  domestic \ninvestors to be implemented as IPPs. The medium-size thermal power projects (i.e., less than \n300 MW) are implemented as IPPs by domestic investors, mainly state-owned enterprises such \nas Vina Coal or joint ventures between EVN and other domestic enterprises. The Government is \nalso keen to develop large thermal complexes with installed capacity of more than 1,500 MW as \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2004.

EVN  has \nfinanced  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  Viet  Nam\u2019s  electricity  sector  without  significant  fiscal \nsubsidies.  The  key  financial  performance  indicators,  such  as  debt  service  cover  ratio,  self- \nfinancing  ratio,  and  receivables,  have  been  maintained  at  prudential  limits.  Meanwhile,  the \naverage end-user tariff has been maintained at around D794/kilowatt-hour (kWh) ($0.051/kWh). \nAlthough  the  average  tariff  level  is  less  than  the  estimated  long-run  marginal  cost  (LRMC)  of \nD1,142/kWh ($0.071/kWh), the prevailing tariffs are adequate to maintain the financial viability \nof the sector. However, to satisfy future demand resulting from rapid economic growth, EVN will \nneed  to  make  considerable  investments  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  As  a \nsubstantial  portion  of  these  investments  will  be  debt  financed,  sustained  tariff  increases  are \nrequired to maintain adequate levels of debt service and self-financing of new investments.       \n \nB. \n \n2. \nEVN's  electricity  sales  (Table  A3.1)  doubled  between  1999  and  2004,  representing  an \nannual  growth  rate  of  15.2%.  Although  the  average  tariffs,  net  of  sales  taxes,  increased  only \nmarginally  from  D660/kWh  ($0.0475/kWh)  in  1999  to  D794/kWh  ($0.051/kWh)  by  2004,  the \ncash  flow  from  operating  activities  rose  from  D5,882  billion  ($427  million)  to  D13,454  billion \n($857  million)  in  that  same  period.  Further,  EVN\u2019s  net  profit  reached  D3,576  billion  ($227 \nmillion) in 2004, compared with D1,088 billion ($79 million) in 1999. EVN\u2019s cumulative financial \nperformance during 1999\u20132004 and the key financial ratios are summarized in Table A3.1. \n \n\nHistorical Performance  \n\nTable A3.1:  Financial Performance of EVN 1999\u20132004  \n(D billion) \n\nItem \nTotal Revenue \nRevenue From Electricity Sales \nElectricity Sales (GWh) \nAverage Tariff D/kWh \nProfit Before Interest and Tax \nNet Profit \n\n \n\n1999 \n14,124 \n12,934 \n19,592 \n660 \n2,618 \n1,088 \n \n5,882 \n6,201 \n(287) \n11,666 \n1,254 \n \n22.7% \n4.8 \n41:59 \n\n2000 \n16,513 \n15,135 \n22,405 \n675 \n2,100 \n883 \n \n7,311 \n8,866 \n371 \n13,697 \n2,036 \n \n32.9% \n3.0 \n47:53 \n\n2001 \n19,209 \n17,540 \n25,752 \n681 \n2,127 \n999 \n \n6,739 \n6,131 \n518 \n9,218 \n3,811 \n \n36.0% \n1.8 \n50:50 \n\n2002 \n23,566 \n21,474 \n30,228 \n710 \n3,110 \n1,650 \n \n8,412 \n6,507 \n174 \n9,923 \n2,823 \n \n60.4% \n3.5 \n50:50 \n\n2003 \n30,245 \n27,480 \n34,841 \n789 \n2,881 \n1,828 \n \n10,904 \n6,337 \n31 \n13,347 \n2,719 \n \n83.4% \n5.7 \n53:47 \n\n2004 \n34,530 \n31,504 \n39,200 \n794 \n4,942 \n3,331 \n \n10,654 \n8,185 \n(40) \n16,298 \n4,503 \n \n37.9% \n3.1 \n55:45 \n\nCash Flow From Operations \nNew Borrowings \nNet Capital Injections \nInvestments \nDebt Service \n \nSelf-Financing Ratio \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio \nDebt-Equity Ratio \nEVN = Electricity of Viet Nam, GWh = gigawatt hour, kWh = kilowatt hour. \nSource: Electricity of Viet Nam. \n\n \n3. \nDuring  1999\u20132004,  EVN\u2019s  cumulative  capital  investments  totaled  D74.1  trillion  ($4.9 \nbillion),  and  its  debt  service  was  D17.1  trillion  ($1.1  billion).  These  investments  were  financed \nthrough  cash  flows  from  operations,  totaling  D49.9  trillion  ($3.3  billion);  borrowings  of  D42.2 \ntrillion  ($2.8  billion);  and  capital  injections  of  D1.3  trillion  ($90  million).  The  heavier  borrowing \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nHistorical Covenant Compliance \n\nincreased  EVN\u2019s  debt-equity  ratio  from  41:59  in  1999  to  55:45  in  2004,  and  reduced  the  debt \nservice cover ratio from 4.8 to 3.1. Still, with its strong growth in future cash flows and low initial \ngearing, EVN retains the capacity to absorb further borrowings to finance its investments.       \n \nC. \n \nIn the two recent ADB loans to EVN (Loans 1358-VIE and 1585-VIE),1 EVN committed \n4. \nthat  three  of  its  power  distribution  companies  (PC1,  PC2,  and  PC3)  would  maintain  certain \nfinancial  ratios  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  ADB's  investments.  These  included  a  minimum \nself-financing  ratio  (SFR)  of  30%,  a  debt  service  coverage  ratio  (DSCR)  of  1.5,  and  a  rate  of \nreturn (ROR) on net fixed assets of 12%. In addition, EVN committed to ADB to (i) increase its \naverage retail tariffs in phases, reaching the equivalent of $0.07/kWh by 1999; (ii) maintain the \nratio of the average residential tariff to the average retail tariff; and (iii) maintain the bulk tariffs \nthat EVN charges the PCs, and not allow them to decline as a percentage of retail tariffs. While \nthe PCs generally complied with the SFR and DSCR ratios, they regularly fell short on the ROR \ncovenant.  As  the  PCs  were  generally  profitable,  although  below  the  12%  threshold,  this \ncovenant was not enforced strictly.     \n \n5. \nEVN generally complied with the covenants on the average level of residential tariffs and \nbulk tariffs compared with average retail tariffs. However, EVN was unable to get Government \napproval to raise its average retail tariffs to $0.07/kWh level, as EVN had been complying with \nthe  financial  ratio  covenants.  In  2001,  the  World  Bank,  ADB,  and  the  Government  met  and \nagreed  on  a  new  schedule  of  tariff  increases  to  raise  retail  tariffs  to  $0.07/kWh  by  July  2005.  \nWhile  the  first  step  of  the  tariff  increases  was  implemented  in  October  2002  to  improve  the \naverage tariff to D789/kWh ($0.051/kWh), the schedule was not maintained after that.    \n \n6. \nFor  these  reasons,  World  Bank,  ADB,  and  the  Government  have  agreed  to  move \nforward in implementing the new financial covenants based on EVN\u2019s consolidated results (not \nwith  the  PCs);  and  EVN's  overall  financial  viability  and  performance,  rather  than  arbitrarily \nsetting  tariff  levels  in  foreign  currency.  The  covenants  included  in  the  recently  approved  Loan \nVIE - 21282 are (i) self-financing ratio of 25%, (ii) debt service ratio of 1.5, and (iii) debt-equity \nratio of 70:30. EVN has complied with these ratios for 2004, as shown in Table A3.1. \n \nD. \n \n \n \n7. \nAlthough EVN\u2019s  corporate  structure  is  envisaged  to  change  under  the  proposed  power \nreforms, EVN is likely to remain a holding company with significant ownership of the operating \nsubsidiaries.  Electricity  sales  are  assumed  to  reach  88\u201399  terawatt-hours  (TWh)  in  2010, \ncompared with 39.2 TWh in 2004. That represents an annual growth rate of 15%\u201316% during \n2005\u20132010.  The  energy  losses  are  expected  to  be  maintained  around  the  current  levels  of \n\nFinancial Projections (2004\u20132010)  \n\nSales Growth \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  1995.

EVN  also  is  expected  to  purchase  35  TWh  from  third  parties  (i.e.,  private  power \nproducers and joint venture companies) out of the total generation of 100\u2013112 TWh in 2010.  \n \n8. \nThe  aggregate  financial  projections  of  EVN  and  key  financial  ratios  for  2005\u20132010  are \nshown in Table A3.2. These projections do not capture the cost of power shortages (i.e., loss of \nsales and use of expensive emergency measures to meet the demand) from May to July 2005 \nin  northern Viet Nam.  As  a  result,  the  actual  financial  performance  of EVN in  2005  might  turn \nout to be worse than the projected figures. The shortages are expected to continue in 2006 and \n2007 due to higher-than-expected growth in demand, as well as delays in commissioning power \nplants now under construction.  \n\n \nTable A3.2:  Financial Performance of EVN 2005\u20132010 \n(D billion) \n\nItem \nTotal Revenue \nRevenue From Electricity Sales \nElectricity Sales GWh \nAverage Tariff D/kWh \nProfit Before Interest and Tax \nNet Profit \n\n \n\n2007 \n58,290 \n53,106 \n57,864 \n918 \n10,719 \n5,547 \n \n22,335 \n31,313 \n1,427 \n45,010 \n9,914 \n1,629 \n \n34.5% \n2.5 \n66:34 \n\n2008 \n66,189 \n60,294 \n64,831 \n930 \n12,071 \n6,028 \n \n26,840 \n36,676 \n1,317 \n44,587 \n12,772 \n2,369 \n \n32.8% \n2.1 \n69:31 \n\n2009 \n75,058 \n68,361 \n72,564 \n942 \n14,534 \n6,538 \n \n31,784 \n39,016 \n960 \n45,291 \n18,036 \n2,426 \n \n33.3% \n1.8 \n70:30 \n\n2010 \n85,103 \n77,493 \n81,201 \n954 \n9,465 \n2,458 \n \n31,363 \n42,053 \n1,026 \n49,662 \n22,084 \n \n \n36.4% \n1.6 \n73:27 \n\n2005 \n40,913 \n37,243 \n45,944 \n811 \n4,582 \n1,956 \n \n14,193 \n17,680 \n831 \n30,455 \n5,263 \n \n \n32.0% \n2.9 \n60:40 \n\n2006 \n46,524 \n42,346 \n51,568 \n821 \n6,939 \n3,441 \n \n17,991 \n21,840 \n1,072 \n37,258 \n6,923 \n2,297 \n \n32.2% \n2.8 \n63:37 \n\n \n\nCash flow From Operations \nNew Borrowings  \nCapital Injections \nInvestments  \nDebt Service \nEquitization  Proceeds \n \nSelf-Financing Ratio \nDebt Service Cover Ratio \nDebt-Equity Ratio \nEVN = Electricity of Viet Nam, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Electricity of Viet Nam. \n\n2. \n\nTariffs \n\n \n \n9. \nThe  financial  projections  assume  that  EVN\u2019s  average  tariff  would  increase  to  ensure \ncompliance  with  the  financial  covenants  (para.  6).  This  would  be  1.3%  per  year  due  to  the \nchange  in  the  consumer  mix  (i.e.,  increase  in  the  share  of  consumption  by  commercial  and \nindustrial consumers at the expense of residential consumers). This assumption is based on the \ndemand forecast for different consumer categories, and higher industrial and commercial tariffs \nrelative  to  residential  tariffs.  The  Government  also  is  assumed  to  approve  an  average  tariff \nincrease of 10.5% (i.e., in addition to the increase in average tariff due to shift in the consumer \nmix)  in  2006  to  meet  minimum  debt  service  coverage  and  self-financing  ratios.3  This  would \nresult  in  an  average  tariff  of  D918/kWh  ($0.056/kWh)  by  2007,  compared  with  D794/kWh \n($0.051/kWh) in 2004. Given the rapid demand growth, and the investment required to maintain \nthe  growth  momentum  of  the  economy,  the  Government  has  indicated  that  reasonable  tariff \nincreases will be allowed during 2005\u20132010. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   In light of the power shortages in early 2005, the Government has asked EVN to submit a tariff increase schedule \n\nin early 2006 for consideration. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\n3. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nEVN  does  not  receive  any  explicit  financial  fiscal  subsidies  from  the  Government.  The \n10. \ncoal  prices  are  administratively  fixed  by  the  government,  and  the  financial  projections  were \nmade  based  on  coal  prices  staying  at  about  $22  per  ton  during  2005\u20132010.  Although  these \nprices  are  below  international  coal  prices,  EVN\u2019s  uses  poor  quality  coal  that  is  not  directly \ncomparable with the international prices. The absence of data on the production cost of different \ntypes  of  coal,  and  the  lack  of  transparency  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  coal  market,  makes  identifying  any \nimplicit subsidy to EVN through coal prices difficult.  \n \n \n \n11. \nEVN  is  to  make  cumulative  capital  investments  totaling  to  D252  trillion  ($16  billion) \nduring  2005\u20132010  period,  compared  with  D74  trillion  ($4.9  billion)  during  1999\u20132004\u2014a \nthreefold  increase  in  capital  investment.  The  debt  service  commitment  during  2005\u20132010  will \nalso  increased  to  D75  trillion  ($4.5  billion),  compared  with  D17  trillion  ($1.1  billion)  in  the \nprevious 6-year period. In addition to the direct investments, EVN also is planning to form joint \nventure  companies  to  implement  some  of  the  power  generation  projects  in  2005\u201320010,  and \nplans to invest D7.6 trillion ($465.0 million) in these companies. These joint ventures also would \nmobilize  debt  financing  of  approximately  D31,000  billion  ($2.0  billion).  Investments  mainly  in \npower  generation  by  non-EVN  entities,  including  the  private  sector,  would  complement  EVN\u2019s \ndirect investments and investments through the joint ventures. \n  \n12.     Although  EVN\u2019s  internal  cash  generation  is  projected  to  reach  D144.5  trillion  ($8.6 \nbillion) during 2005\u20132010, D188.6 trillion ($11.2 billion) in borrowings would finance the bulk of \nthe investments. This indicates significantly heavier borrowing compared with 1999\u20132004, when \nEVN  borrowed  D42.2  trillion  ($2.8  billion).  Without  significant  equity  injections,  this  investment \nplan would substantially increase EVN\u2019s debt and its debt service requirements. The debt-equity \nratio would increase to 73:27 in 2010 from 55:45 in 2004, while the debt service requirements \nwould rise to D22.1 trillion ($1.4 billion) in 2010 from D4,503 trillion ($285 million) in 2004. As a \nresult,  the  DSCR  would  drop  to  1.6  by  2010  from  3.1  in  2004.  This  trend  reflects  EVN\u2019s \ntransition from a lightly geared utility, due to its lack of access to debt financing before 1995, to \na more typical utility in a fast-growing economy.       \n \nThe  Government  has  approved  the  plan  for  EVN  to  equitize  (i.e.,  partially  privatize) \n13. \nminority  stakes  in  some  power  generation  plants.  The  proceeds  from  these  sales  are  not \nincluded  in  the  cash  flow  projections,  and  are  not  used  in  the  computation  of  the  SFR  and \nDSCR ratios. As of June 2005, the 130 megawatt (MW) Vinh Son\u2013Song Hinh hydropower plant, \na  provincial  power  distribution  utility,  and  15  noncore  businesses  had  been  equitized.  By  the \nend of 2006, seven power plants and 15 power distribution utilities are expected to be equitized. \nThe liabilities of the equitized entities are transferred to the equitized entity, and the par value is \ncomputed  net  of  the  liabilities.  The  cash  proceeds  from  the  equitization  will  improve  the  cash \nflow-based financial ratio. However, the debt-equity ratio of EVN as a consolidated entity will not \nbe  affected  as  EVN  intends  to  hold  a  majority  stake  in  the  equitized  entities.  The  liabilities  of \nnew  power  plants  to  be  developed  as  joint  ventures  between  EVN  and  other  parties  are  not \nconsolidated in the financial projections (Table A3.2), as the ownership structures of these joint \nventures have not been finalized.    \n \n\n4. \n\nProposed Covenants \n\n \nGiven the increasing indebtedness, a maximum long-term debt-equity ratio of 70:30 and \n14. \na minimum DSCR of 1.5 are proposed as financial covenants to ensure EVN\u2019s debt level and its \ndebt  service  capacity  remains  within  prudential  limits.  Although  the  debt-equity  position  is \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n5.  \n\nConclusion \n\nsteadily  increasing  and  DCSR  is  decreasing,  they  will  remain  within  these  limits  during  the \nforecast  period,  except  in  2010  when  debt-equity  ratio  will  exceed  70:30.  A  minimum  SFR  of \n25% also must be included to ensure that EVN is generating adequate cash flows to finance a \nreasonable portion of the capital investments to keep the company's leverage within prudential \nlimits.  These  covenants  were  included  in  Loan  2128-VIE,  approved  in  2004,  and  EVN \ncomfortably  complied  with  them  in  2004.  However,  in  the  absence  of  the  10%  increase  in \naverage tariffs in 2006, EVN is unlikely to meet the covenant on a minimum SFR of 25%.   \n \n \n \n15. \nDespite its ambitious capital expansion program and relatively low tariffs, EVN appears \ncapable of maintaining its financial viability in the medium term with a modest tariff increase in \n2006.  The  financial  projections  assume  EVN  will  continue  to  purchase  coal  at  $22\u2013$25  per \nmetric ton, and that natural gas prices will increase at 2% per year. Any moves to link natural \ngas  prices  to  crude  oil  prices  would  affect  the  financial  viability  of  the  sector  significantly. \nFinancial performance covenants have been set on this basis to ensure financial viability, while \nalso providing EVN with enough financial flexibility to adjust in the short term as necessary. As \nshown  in  Table  A3.2,  compliance  with  the  financial  covenants  is  projected  over  the  forecast \nperiod. However, if revenue stops growing in line with these assumptions, or the subsidies on \nfuel prices are removed, further increases in retail tariffs will be required to maintain compliance \nwith the covenants. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \n \nThe livelihood of \npeople in the \nnorthern Viet Nam \nhas been improved \nin a sustainable \nmanner \n \n\nOutcome \n

Supported  by  buoyant  consumption  and  investment,  economic  growth  remained  rapid \nrate in 2004, reaching 7.5%. Industry and services accounted for nearly 80% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), and were the main sources of growth. These two sectors grew 10.2% and 7.4%, \nrespectively, while agricultural expanded by 2.8%. The average inflation for 2004 was 7.7%, up \nfrom  3.2%  in  2003.  Broad-based  economic  growth  has  increased  broad  money  supply  and \ncredit  by  28%  and  36%,  respectively.  The  fiscal  deficit  was  maintained  at  3.8%,  below  the \nGovernment\u2019s target of 5%. The fiscal position is expected to continue to expand, though within \nmanageable limits, to cover the investments in infrastructure and adjustment costs of structural \nreforms. The average economic growth for 2005\u20132007 is expected to be 7.5%\u20138.0%. The key \ndevelopment challenges for Viet Nam are to sustain the economic growth and reduce inequality \nthrough targeted poverty reduction. To increase the competitiveness and maintain GDP growth \nof  at  least  7.5%,  Viet  Nam  needs  to  maintain  an  investment  level  of  35%  of  GDP,  mainly  to \ndevelop the physical infrastructure. \n \n2. \nThe key challenge facing Viet Nam\u2019s power sector is maintaining adequate investments \nto meet the rapid growth in demand for electricity. The Fifth Master Plan, revised in March 2003, \nstates  that  the  total  investment  requirement  of  the  power  sector  needs  an  estimated  $17.5 \nbillion for 2004\u20132010, consisting of $13.0 billion for generation and $4.5 billion for transmission \nand  distribution.  The  internal  cash  generation  of  the  sector  will  provide  half  of  the  funding \nrequirement with borrowings (i.e., overseas development assistance, as well as export credit), \nwith  investments  from  non-sector  entities,  including  private  sector,  filling  the  balance.  The \noperational  and  financial  performance  of  EVN  has  improved  consistently  during  the  past  5 \nyears.  The  average  tariff  at  around  $0.052/kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  is  below  the  long-run  marginal \ncost (LRMC), which is estimated at around $0.075/kWh). However, the self-financing ratio and \ndebt  service  coverage  ratio  have  been  maintained  within  the  prudential  limits  without  explicit \nfiscal  subsidies.  The  heavier  borrowing  required  by  the  sector  to  finance  the  large  capital \ninvestment program will require improvement in the internal cash generation of the sector.  \n\n3. \nViet Nam\u2019s demand for electricity has grown 14.2% per annum during 1990\u20132003. The \ngrowth rate increased to 15.2% during 1999\u20132004, with electricity sales rising to 39.7 terawatt-\nhour (TWh) in 2004 from 19.5 TWh in 1999. The demand growth was driven by (i) rapid broad-\nbased growth in industrial and commercial sectors, (ii) increase in electrification from less than \n40% in 1990 to more than 80% in 2004, (iii) urbanization, and (iv) higher living standards with \ndomestic demand growing at 19%. The demand has grown in all three regions of the country at \nroughly  similar  rates.  However,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  per  capita  consumption,  at  around  500  kWh,  is \nrelatively  low  compared  with  neighboring  countries,  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC)  and  Thailand.  The  electricity  demand  elasticity  to  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  be \nmaintained  at  1.9  due  to  the  energy-intensive  nature  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  industry-led  economic \ngrowth. Given forecasted economic growth of 7% for 2005\u20132015, this translates into electricity \ndemand  growth  of  13%,  which  is  lower  than  the  growth  rate  in  recent  times.  The  electricity \ndemand and the peak demand are expected to rise from 39.7 TWh and 8,400 megawatt (MW), \nrespectively, in 2004 to 84.5 TWh and 17,000 MW in 2010, and 139.2 TWh and 26,900 MW in \n2015. The system losses would be reduced from 14.7% in 2004 to 13.8% in 2010 and 12.3 % in \n\n \n\nB. \n\nDemand Analysis \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nEconomic Rationale \n\n2015,  while  the  load  factor  will  improve  from  65.7%  in  2004  to  68.4%  in  2010  and  69.1%  in \n2015.    \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe Government is committed to establishing a wholesale electricity market in Viet Nam \nwith competition in power generation. Except for the few multipurpose power plants, all the other \npublic  sector  power  plants  will  be  equitized  (i.e.,  partially  privatized)  and  will  take  part  in  the \nproposed power market. However, power transmission will remain within the public sector due \nto  its  monopolistic  nature,  the  strategic  importance  of  maintaining  the  security  of  the  power \nsupply,  and  the  necessity  to  ensure  comparable  conditions  for  competing  power  plants.  The \ntransmission  business  of  Electricity  of  Viet  Nam  (EVN)  will  be  consolidated  as  a  separate \nbusiness unit, which will be regulated economically under the proposed electricity regulator. The \ncontinued public sector investments in power transmission is justified based on the importance \nof  power  transmission  to  meet  the  power  demand  and  its  high  economic  return,  though  the \nfinancial return is moderate due to the difficulties of pricing network services.  \n \nD. \n\nLeast Cost Analysis \n\n5. \nThe locations of new power plants and the high growth load centers drive the expansion \nof the power transmission system. The power generation expansion program for Viet Nam was \ndeveloped  using  a  least-cost  expansion  planning  algorithm  (WASP  III)  under  the  Fifth  Master \nPlan  in  2000,  which  was  updated  in  2003  to  account  for  the  increase  in  projected  demand \ngrowth. The algorithm minimizes the discounted sum of capital and operating cost by selecting \nthe optimum generation plant mix. The underlying assumptions in the optimization program for \nfuel  cost  and  capital  cost  of  candidate  power  plants,  and  types  of  candidate  power  plants \nconsidered,  are  reviewed  and  found  to  be  reasonable.  The  transmission  planning  aims  to \nconnect  the  selected  power  plants  in  the  least-cost  generation  expansion  plan  with  the  load \ncenters  at  the  least  cost  (taking  into  account  transmission  losses  and  capital  cost)  subject  to \npower  system  security  and  stability  constraints.  The  operating  voltage  and  the  capacity  of \ntransmission  lines  are  selected  using  least-cost  planning  criteria,  while  the  locations  and \ncapacities of substations are selected to deliver the power to load centers at the least cost. The \nanalysis  has  shown  that  500  kilovolt  (kV)  is  the  least-cost  voltage  for  transmitting  power  from \nproposed large hydropower projects in northern Viet Nam to the load centers in Hanoi.  \n \nE. \n\nEconomic Benefit- Cost Analysis \n\n6. \nThe  proposed  sector  loan  comprises  individual  subprojects,  including  a  500 kV \ntransmission  line  and  a  series  of  substations,  included  in  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector \ninvestment  program,  to  meet  growing  electricity  demand  in  the  northern  region.  As  these \nindividual  subprojects  are  not  stand-alone  investments,  the  economic  and  financial  analyses \nwere conducted using a macro time-slice approach for the northern region investment program. \nThe investment program, which analyzed the period from 2007 to 2015, is based on the least-\ncost expansion plan for generation and transmission.     \n \n7. \nThe financial and economic viability was examined by comparing the costs and benefits \nof  meeting  demand  growth  from  2007  to  2030  under  the  \u201cwith\u201d  investment  program  scenario \nand  a  \u201cwithout\u201d  investment  program  scenario.  The  \u201cwithout\u201d  scenario  assumes  that  no \ninvestments  will  be  made  in  the  north  beyond  2007,  though  it  accounts  for  the  possibility  of \nmeeting demand until 2010 utilizing the spare capacity of the system in 2007. This will be at a \nlower  reliability  due  to  the  probable  increased  loss  of  load  and  transmission  losses.  The \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n45 \n\ninvestment program for the central and southern regions is assumed to continue. The point at \nwhich  the  demand  would  be  curtailed  was  determined  by  undertaking  power  system  studies \nuntil  the  transmission  capacity  on  the  north\u2013south  500  kV  line  is  exceeded.  The  incremental \ndemand in the north would be met by power flows from the south in the absence of additional \ninvestments  in  the  north  under  the  \u201cwithout\u201d  case.  This  was  found  to  be  the  point  when \nmaximum demand in northern power system reaches 5,447 MW in 2010.  \n \n8. \nThe \u201cwith\u201d case assumes that the planned investments will be made during the time slice \n(i.e.,  2007\u20132015).  Further,  it  assumes  that  at  the  end  of  the  time  slice,  any  incremental  sales \nwould  require  further  investments.  Hence,  financial  and  economic  benefits  due  to  incremental \nsales  after 2015  (i.e.,  at  this  point  the  maximum  demand  in  the  northern  power  system  would \nhave reached 8,540 MW) would not be considered in the analysis. \n\n \n \nFigure A11.1: Time Slice Analysis \n\n \n\nDue \n\n3,631\n\n2010 \n\n2007 \n\n8,540 \n\n5,447 \n\nLoad Forecast \n\nDemand \nMW \n\nNo Investment Case \n\nWith Investment Case \n\nLosses \nto \nCapacity  Constraints \nand  sales  lost  due  to \nLack of Generation \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe economic and financial benefits are derived from comparing the performance of the \n9. \npower  sector  in  Viet  Nam  under  the  \u201cwith\u201d  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  investment  scenarios  during  2007\u2013\n2030. These are due to (i) higher sales; (ii) lower transmission losses; and (iii) lower fuel cost \nper unit due to optimal plant mix, as the generation and transmission system will be based on \nthe  least-cost  planning  criteria  under  the  \u201cwith\u201d  case.  This  is  illustrated  in  Tables  A11.1  and \nTable A11.2. The total generation is maintained at the same level as the \u201cwith\u201d case until 2010 \nusing the surplus generation available in the south. This increases transmission losses and fuel \ncost, and lowers sales due to increased losses. After 2010, the total generation under \u201cwithout\u201d \ncase falls below the total generation under the \u201cwith\u201d case, as transmission constraints become \nbinding.  As  a  result,  transmission  losses  as  a  percentage  drop  below  the  levels  reached  in \n2010.

To  derive  the  \u201cwithout\u201d  case  investment \nprogram,  the  investments  in  the  power  plants  committed  but  scheduled  for  commissioning \nduring  2007\u20132015  in  northern  Viet  Nam  and  the  uncommitted  investments  in  transmission  in \nnorthern Viet Nam during 2007\u20132015 are excluded from the \u201cwith\u201d case scenario. The difference \nbetween  the  two  scenarios  (i.e.,  incremental  capital  investment)  is  used  in  the  benefit-cost \nanalysis. The operation and maintenance cost of the two scenarios is estimated separately for \nthe two scenarios as a percentage (i.e., 3%) of the capital investment in different plants types \nunder the two scenarios. The economic analysis uses the domestic price numeraire by adjusting \nfor  capital  and  operational  costs  valued  at  border  prices,  and  multiplying  by  the  shadow \nexchange rate factor (SERF). \n \n18. \nSERF is estimated to be 1.1 for Viet Nam. The fuel cost and the power purchase cost \nfrom independent power producers (IPP) is higher in the \u201cwith\u201d case than in the \u201cwithout\u201d case \ndue to the higher electricity sales in the \u201cwith\u201d case. The analysis shows that economic benefits \nexceed  the  costs  when  discounted  at  a  rate  of  12%.  Further,  the  investment  program  has  a \npositive net present value of D72,829 trillion and an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of \n23.1% based on the net benefits shown in Table A11.7, which exceeds the hurdle rate of 12%.   \n \n\nTable A11.7: Economic Benefit-Cost Analysis \n(D billion) \n\nYear \n\nCapex \n\nO &M \n\nFuel Cost \n\nIPP Cost \n\nEconomic \nBenefits \n0 \n2,012 \n4,539 \n8,737 \n12,010 \n17,820 \n25,256 \n30,986 \n41,028 \n\n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015\u20132030 \nIPP = independent power producer, O & M = operations and manual. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n  5,002 \n15,384 \n27,066 \n34,045 \n21,484 \n  9,812 \n  2,670 \n    771 \n \n\n0 \n  137 \n  465 \n1,463 \n3,083 \n3,531 \n3,743 \n4,005 \n4,190 \n\n0 \n (37) \n(283) \n (63) \n (77) \n(243) \n(338) \n(182) \n  62 \n\nEconomic \nCost \n\n 5,002 \n15,377 \n26,930 \n36,092 \n24,419 \n11,860 \n 4,533 \n 3,288 \n 3,876 \n\nNet \nBenefits \n(5,002) \n(13,365) \n(22,391) \n(27,355) \n(12,409) \n  5,960 \n20,724 \n27,699 \n37,152 \n\n0 \n(108) \n(319) \n 648 \n   (71) \n(1,241) \n(1,543) \n(1,306) \n   (376) \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\nG. \n\nFinancial Benefit- Cost Analysis \n\n19. \nThe  financial  benefit-cost  analysis  was  consistent  with  the  economic  benefit-cost \nanalysis.

The  other \nassumptions  are  a  domestic  inflation  rate  of  3%,  international  interest  rate  of  1%,  tax  rate  of \n32%, and a minimum interest rate of 2.5% in view of the prevailing low interest rates.  As shown \nin Table A11.9, the WACC for the investment program in northern Viet Nam during 2004\u20132010 \nis  6.86%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  14.1%,  and  the  financial  net  present \nvalue (NPV) calculated at WACC (i.e., 6.86%) is D52,538 billion.   \n \nH. \n \n22. \nThe  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  (Table  A11.10)  to  several  adverse  movements  in  key \nvariables was analyzed. As the economic analysis was carried out in the incremental basis by \ncomparing the \u201cwith\u201d case and \u201cwithout\u201d case, (i) decrease in the  electricity sales, (ii) reduced \nwillingness  to  pay,  (iii)  increased  capital  expenditure,  (iv)  increased  operation  and  manual \n(O&M) expenses, and (v) reduced fuel cost.  The sensitivity of FIRR also was computed for the \nadverse movements in the same variables, except the change in willingness to pay, which was \nreplaced by reduced electricity tariffs.  \n \n23. \nThe reduction in fuel cost and IPP cost tends to reduce the EIRR and FIRR, as it lowers \nthe  economic  benefits  attributable  to  the  investment  program  by  lowering  the  savings  in  fuel \ncost due to investment program. However, the sensitivity analysis shows that the economic and \nfinancial  rate  of  return  of  the  investment  program  is  sufficiently  robust  to  withstand  adverse \nmovements  in  key  variables.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  are  summarized  in  Table \nA11.10. \n\n \nTable A11.10: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nScenario \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n20% increase in capital expenses \n20% reduction in benefits/revenues \n20% increase in capex \n20% decrease in fuel costs \n20% decrease in IPP cost \n20%  increase in capex and O&M \nFIRR  =  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  IPP  =  independent  power  producer,  NPV  =  net  present  value,  O&M  = \noperation and manual. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nFinancial Analysis \nNPV \n 28,237 \n 41,842 \n 49,612 \n 52,425 \n 52,162 \n 38,315 \n\nFIRR (%) \n10.9 \n11.8 \n13.7 \n14.0 \n14.0 \n11.4 \n\nEIRR (%) \n  15.4 \n  19.6 \n  22.5 \n  23.1 \n  23.0 \n  19.1 \n\nNPV \n 24,240 \n 57,567 \n 68,842 \n 72,731 \n 72,528 \n 53,580 \n\n \nA risk analysis was carried out using the @RISK software by probabilistically simulating \n24. \nthe  key  variables  to  determine  the  mean  value  and  the  95%  confidence  interval  of  EIRR  and \nFIRR.

It was built upon the laws of the Government of Viet Nam, principally the \nrevised  2003  Land  Law,  and  Decrees  197  and  188;  as  well  as  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).    Provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  this \nRF,  and  the  resettlement  plans  (RP)  that  were  prepared  subsequently,  will  supersede  the \nprovisions of relevant decrees in force in Viet Nam wherever a gap exists, as per Decree 17.   \n\n2. \nFor the three core subprojects, two RPs for the 240 kilometer (km) 500 kilovolt (kV) Son \nLa\u2013Nho  Quan  transmission  line  and  the  151.9  km  220  kV  Thanh  Hoa\u2013Vinh  transmission  line \nwere prepared based on the objectives, policies, screening, and planning procedures adopted in \nthe RF. An RP is not required for the 220 kV Van Tri substation, because it will not require any \nland acquisition and will not have any resettlement impacts as the transformer will be installed \nwithin the existing substation area.   \n\nB. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n3. \nThe  two  core  subproject  RPs  were  prepared  based  on  a  preliminary  design.  The \ntransmission routes were realigned to avoid densely populated areas to minimize resettlement \nimpacts.  For  the  500  kV  Son  La\u2013Nho  Quan  transmission  line,  no  houses  and  structures  are \npermitted  along  the  transmission line  corridor. Of  the  172 people who  will  be  have  to  relocate \noutside  the  transmission  line  corridor,  153  have  residual  land  to  rebuild  their  houses.  The \nremaining  19  people  who  do  not  have  sufficient  land  will  be  provided  with  another  plot  of \nresidential land within the commune. The subproject will require the acquisition of 1.95 hectare \n(ha) of residential land, and 29.3 ha of residential land will be affected due to a change in land \nuse (i.e., residential land will be converted into other purposes), for which an easement fee will \nbe paid. For the tower foundations,1 14.5 ha of land will be acquired, while 189.65 ha of land will \nbe affected temporarily. Secondary structures (sheds, toilets), crops (28.6 ha), and 5,965 trees \nalso will be affected. Most of the people affected by the Son La\u2013Nho Quan transmission line are \nethnic  minorities  (Muong  and  Thai).  Social  analysis  shows  that  ethnic  minorities  are  not  any \nmore vulnerable than Kinh households to the risks associated with resettlement, since they live \nmostly in mixed communities with Kinh households.   \n\n4. \nFor the 220 kV Thanh Hoa\u2013Vinh transmission line, houses and structures not taller than \n5 meters are permitted along the transmission line corridor. However, if more than 70% of the \nresidential land will be traversed by the transmission line corridor, the entire residential area will \nbe acquired. Of the 82 affected persons (AP) identified along the transmission line corridor, 24 \nwill lose more than 70% of their residential land (14.5 ha) and will have to relocate to another \nplot  of  residential  land  within  the  commune.  The  affected  trees  (3,519)  identified  along  the \ntransmission line corridor will be cut or trimmed due to height restrictions, and about 3.67 ha of \ncrops also will be affected. For the tower foundations, 6.8 ha of land will be acquired, while 60.7 \nha of land will be affected temporarily.   \n\n                                                 \n1   For  the  tower  foundations  (applicable  to  the  two  subprojects),  most  of  the  land  identified  is  forest  or  agricultural. \nThe locations of the towers will be known once the detailed design has been completed. Therefore, the names and \nnumber of APs and level of impact are not known.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\nProject Principles and Entitlements Policy \n\nC. \n\n5. \n\nThe following resettlement principles adopted for the Project are as follows:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  loss  of  land,  structures  and  other  assets  and \nincomes will be avoided or minimized by exploring all viable options.  \nAPs  are  entitled  to  compensation  for  all  lost  and  affected  assets,  incomes,  and \nbusinesses  at  replacement  cost,  and  provided  with  rehabilitation  measures \nsufficient  to  assist  them  to  improve  or  at  least  maintain  their  pre-project  living \nstandards, incomes, and productive capacity.  \nLack of legal rights to the assets lost or adversely affected will not bar APs from \nentitlement  to  such  compensation  and  rehabilitation  measures.  Those  without \nlegal  title  to  land  and/or  structures  occupied  or  used  by  them  (e.g.,  non-titled \nAPs)  will  be  entitled  to  various  kinds  of  resettlement  assistance,  provided  they \ncultivated  and  occupied  the  land  before  the  eligibility  cutoff  date.  Resettlement \nassistance  to  non-titled  APs  will  include  compensation  for  lost  assets  and \nrestoration of income and living standards.    \nCompensation  for  affected  assets  will  be  provided  at  replacement  cost.  Where \nrelocation or displacement is required, efforts will be made to maintain the social \nand cultural institutions of the people being resettled and host community to the \nextent possible.  \nPreparation of RPs (as part of subproject preparation) and their implementation \nis to be carried out with participation and consultation of affected people.  \nImplementation  schedule  and  budget  for  resettlement  planning  (including \nsocioeconomic survey and census) and implementation will be incorporated into \neach subproject and the overall project. \nElectricity  of  Viet  Nam  (EVN)  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  are  not \nissued a notice of possession of site for any section of construction works unless \nNorthern  Power  Project  Management  Board  (NPPMB)  has  (a)  satisfactorily \ncompleted,  in  accordance  with  the  approved  relevant  RP  for  that  subproject, \ncompensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new  sites,  and  (b)  ensured  that  the \nrehabilitation assistance is in place and the area required for civil works is free of \nall encumbrances.  \n\n(viii)  Compensation  for  vulnerable  households  (female-headed  households  with \ndependents,  disabled  household  heads,  poor  households,  landless  elderly \nhouseholds with no means of support, households without security of tenure, and \nethnic  minorities  living  in  remote,  isolated  areas  or  in  communes  with  special \ndifficulties  as  classified  under  Government  Programme  135)  will  be  carried  out \nwith  respect  for  their  cultural  values  and  specific  needs.  Assistance  will  include \nmeasures to help them improve their socioeconomic status. \n\n \nThe  project  entitlements  (Table  A12.1)  are  designed \n\n6. \nto  cover  compensation, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation for lost assets; and to restore or enhance the livelihoods of all \nAPs. APs will receive compensation in cash or in-kind (e.g., replacement land) at replacement \ncost for affected assets, as well as various rehabilitation measures. Special assistance will be \nprovided  to  the  severely  affected  and  vulnerable  people  to  help  them  improve  their \nsocioeconomic status.     \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nTable A12.1: Summary Entitlement Matrix \n\nEntitlements \n\nTypes of Losses \nLoss of Land, Structures, Crops, and Trees \nAll land temporarily affected (<1 year)  Rent for period of disruption, compensation for loss of crops or \ntrees, compensation for loss of income for period of disruption \nfor subsequent crops that can not be planted, land restored to \npre-project condition. \nFull title to replacement land as a priority, or cash compensation \nat full replacement cost at market value. \nPayment of easement fee on residential land, houses, and \nstructures.    \nAssistance for livelihood stabilization and socioeconomic \nprograms. \n\nAll land permanently affected  \n\nEasement for transmission line \ncorridor \nSevere effects (10% or more loss of \ntotal productive assets, requiring \nrelocation) \nShops, houses, and secondary \nstructures \nStanding crops and trees \n\nCompensation in cash or in-kind at full replacement cost with no \ndeduction for depreciation or salvaged materials. \nCash compensation for loss of crops and trees at replacement \ncost. \n\nAssistance for Livelihood Stabilization and Socioeconomic Programs \nTransportation (relocating APs) \n\nAPs relocating within province: D3 million/household. \nAPs relocating to another province: D5 million/household. \nAllowance of 30 kg of rice/person/month for 6\u201312 months. \n\nTransition subsistence (relocating & \nseverely affected APs) \nAssistance for agricultural land in \nurban areas \n\nTraining for occupational change \n\nAgricultural extension \n\nSpecial allowance for poor and \nvulnerable APs \n\nOther measures \n\nIn addition to compensation, cash assistance for agricultural land \nin urban, peri-urban, or rural residential areas of 20\u201350% of the \nmarket value of agricultural land. \nThe training will be of a value up to a pre-agreed sum of \n$200/trainee, given directly to the training institution involved. \nTrainees entitled to a subsistence allowance during training \nperiod (to a maximum of 6 months), or to a maximum value of \n$100/trainee.

In early 2005, NPPMB and project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA) consultants consulted further with commune leaders and APs to discuss the resettlement \nimpacts, availability of replacement land, and the required measures and assistance to ensure \nthat  APs  can  restore,  if  not  improve,  their  livelihoods.  Further  consultation  will  be  carried  out \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\nGender, Ethnicity, and Poverty Issues \n\nbefore  the  design  is  finalized,  and  will  continue  throughout  the  Project.  A  four-step  procedure \nhas  been  established  to  deal  with  any  resettlement-related  issues,  concerns,  or  grievances \nraised  during  project  implementation.  APs  will  be  exempted  from  administrative  and  legal  fees \nassociated with resolving the grievance. \n \n8. \nBefore ADB\u2019s Management Review Meeting (MRM), the RF and RPs will be translated \ninto  the  Vietnamese  language.  Copies  of  the  RF  and  RPs,  in  English  and  Vietnamese \nlanguages,  will  be  distributed  to  the  respective  provinces.  The  public  information  booklets \nprepared  for  the  two  subprojects  will  be  translated  into  Vietnamese  language  (and  ethnic \nminority  language,  as  required),  and  will  be  distributed  to  all  APs.  Copies  of  the  RPs  will  be \nplaced  in  the  respective  district  and  commune  offices.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  new  Public \nCommunications  Policy,  the  RF  and  RPs  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  will  be \nimmediately uploaded on ADB\u2019s resettlement Web site. The final versions of these documents \nwill be uploaded upon Board approval.   \n \nE. \n \n9. \nWomen,  ethnic  minorities  who  live  in  remote  and  isolated  areas,  and  poor  households \nare  among  the  most  vulnerable  groups  affected  by  resettlement.  In  many  of  the  core  project \nareas,  the  number  and  proportion  of  poor  households  is  significantly  higher  than  the  national \naverage  in  Viet Nam.  In  accordance  with  the RF,  RP  preparation  and  implementation  will  pay \nspecial attention to (i) the role of women\u2019s economic activities in restoring living standards; (ii) \naccess  to  existing  credit  and  agricultural  extension  for  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor \nhouseholds;  (iii)  joint  registration  of  land  use  rights  in  the  names  of  husband  and  wife  where \nhouseholds  are  allocated  alternative  agricultural  and/or  residential  land;  (iv)  participation  and \nconsultation  strategies  that  encourage  the  involvement  of  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor \nhouseholds in resettlement planning and implementation; (v) complaints and grievances lodged \nby  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor  households;  and  (vi)  disaggregated  data  collection  on \ngender and ethnic minorities to support resettlement planning and monitoring. A project-specific \ngender strategy has been developed and is included in Section D (Gender and Development) of \nthe Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 13). \n \nF. \n \n10. \nEVN,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  appoint  a  full-time  resettlement  staff  to  effectively \nliaise and coordinate closely with the involved ministries and other agencies, as well as with the \ncompensation  and  resettlement  boards  (CARB)  and  NPPMB.  Its  project  management  unit \n(PMU),  NPPMB,  has  been  established  in  Hanoi.  In  coordination  with  relevant  agencies,  the \nPMU will manage and supervise the Project. NPPMB will create a social and environment unit \n(SEU),  and  will  assign  full-time  and  qualified  resettlement  staff  responsible  for  social  issues, \nparticularly  (i)  resettlement  planning  and  management,  (ii)  ethnic  minority  development \nplanning,  (iii)  HIV/AIDS  awareness  program,  (iv)  poverty  and  social  impact  assessments,  and \n(v) labor practices.   \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  starting  in  2006.  Implementation  of \n11. \nresettlement and related activities will take place after the mobilization of the project supervision \nconsultant,  who  will  work  closely  with,  and  assist,  the  NPPMB  in  all  resettlement-related \nactivities. Civil works contractors will not be issued a notice of possession of site for any section \nof  construction  works  unless  NPPMB  has  (i)  completed,  in  accordance  with  the  approved \nrelevant  RP  for  that  subproject,  compensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new  sites;  and  (ii) \nensured that the rehabilitation assistance is in place, and the area required for civil works is free \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Schedule \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nof  encumbrances.

NPPMB will submit quarterly monitoring reports to ADB.  \nNPPMB  will  engage  an  independent  monitoring  agency  to  conduct  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation, focusing on the social impacts of the Project and whether APs are able to improve or \nat least restore their pre-project living standards, incomes, and productive capacity.     \n \nH. \n \n13. \nThe  Project  has  budgeted  $15.0  million  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  This \nincludes  compensation  payments  and  allowances  to  APs,  operational  and  administration \nexpenses, internal and external monitoring, and contingencies. \n \n14. \nNPPMB will be responsible for channeling funds to the CARBs for compensation for land \nacquisition and resettlement. NPPMB and CARB will be responsible for paying APs directly for \nland, crops, trees, houses, other structures, and any allowances.   \n \n\nResettlement Budget and Flow of Funds \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to poverty reduction in Viet Nam: \n\nViet Nam has made remarkable progress in providing electricity services to the population. This is a key objective in \nthe  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  reduce  poverty  and  vulnerability.  The  share  of  households  with  access  to  electricity \nincreased from 49% in 1992 to 86% in 2002. Demand for electricity has increased substantially in the past decade as \nincomes  have  increased  and  poverty  has  declined.  This  has  increased  household  affordability  of  appliances  and \nelectricity  services.  However,  annual  per  capita  consumption  remains  among  the  lowest  in  Asia  at  about  500 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh). Utilization of rural households is even lower, about 180 kWh per year or 15 kWh per month. \n \nA  reliable  and  good  quality  electricity  supply  is  important  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Electricity \nsupply  promotes  alternative  sources  of  income  that  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  households  to  falling  into  poverty. \nAccess to electricity has expenditure-reducing effects, which is particularly important for poor households. Reduced \nexpenditure  on  electricity  allows  households  to  use  more  expenditure  for  food,  education,  and  health  services. \nAccess  to  electricity  also  reduces  the  workload  of  women  in  food  processing  and  collecting  water.  Irrigation  using \nelectricity reduces input cost for farmers and increases agricultural productivity.  \n \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB. \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe 2002 Viet Nam Living Standard survey shows that the national incidence of poverty has fallen from 37% in 1998 \nto 29% in 2002. Even though the economic growth and pro-poor development approach has progressed substantially \nover the decade, the benefit of poverty reduction and rate of decline and incidence of poverty varies greatly across \nthe country. Some regions and some population groups have gained more than the others. The northern region is \nthe poorest among the nine regions in Viet Nam. The project provinces are in the northern region. Son La province \nwas the third poorest provinces in the northern region with a poverty head count of 71.4%. The decline in poverty in \nurban areas has been greater, declining at nearly twice the rate of rural areas. The Government is now preparing a \nnew  cycle  of  targeted  poverty  reduction  programs.  The  Government  also  has  increased  budget  allocations  to \ntargeted programs associated with poverty reduction in the poorest provinces. \n \nThe high share of households reported to use electricity as a main source of lighting suggests that poor households \nare connected. The share of poor households reported to use electricity as a main source of lighting in the project \nareas ranges from 75% to 95%. The cost of connection is a barrier for many poor households to use electricity. The \nratio of rural to urban beneficiaries is about 1:4. This means that the majority of project benefits will accrue to urban \nareas,  where  poverty  incidences  are  generally  lower.  However,  with  strong  rural-urban  links,  increasing  urban \nmigration  (particularly  of  females  who  make  up  an  increasing  proportion  of  migrants),  and  remittances,  indirect \nimpacts in terms of employment and income of the project are expected to benefit some households in rural areas.    \n \nThe level of electricity consumption is normally strongly correlated with income. This is mainly because as household \nincomes rise, affordability of appliances increases. Poor households, thus, consume smaller amounts than nonpoor. \nThe very poor often are limited to using one or two light bulbs, and sometimes an electric fan. Among the poorest \nhouseholds in Viet Nam with access to electricity, electricity accounts for less than 2% of their total spending. This is \nlow compared with other countries in the region. Consumption levels range from 2 kWh per month for the very poor \nto  around  20\u201330  kWh  for  the  poor  just  below  and  above  the  poverty  line.  The  near-poor  and  poor  just  below  the \npoverty line have some affordability of appliances, and might even have a TV. Of the poorest income quintile, 17% \nreported having a color TV. However, these appliances, while cheap in terms of capital costs, are secondhand and \ninefficient in electricity usage, and thus are more expensive to run. Despite these low consumption levels, electricity \nis  a  priority  for  poor  households.  This  is  reflected  in  the  fact  that  they  are  willing  to  sell  an  animal,  depleting  their \nsavings, to pay for up front connection charges. Thus, the value of just a few kWh of electricity consumption in terms \nof enhancing the quality of life is large from the household perspective. Most households use electricity for domestic \nactivities such as lighting, water pump, TV, and radio. Very few of the poor use electricity for own-business activities. \nAccess to the grid also has large expenditure-reducing effects for poor households, and allows them to become more \nenergy efficient, using fewer kWh. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \nHowever,  in  rural  areas  electricity  services  are  not  always  reliable  and  of  good  quality.  This  is  due  to  the  rapid \nexpansion of the electricity network, poor local network management, and poor and long wiring from the pole to the \nhouse  in  rural  areas.  High  losses  and  inadequate  power  supply  remain  a  burden  for  many  of  the  connected  rural \nconsumers.  Unreliable  services  and  voltage  fluctuations  reduce  some  of  the  benefits  of  electricity.  First,  electricity \nusage for income-earning activities in agriculture and small-scale commercial activities are adversely affected with a \nconsequent loss in income. Second, voltage fluctuations reduce the lifespan of appliances and increase the cost of \nusing electricity. This will deter consumers from purchasing appliances and using electricity optimally.  \n \nIn  urban  areas,  the  requirement  of  formal  registration  cards  is  a  key  barrier  for  poor  informal  migrants,  often  from \nrural areas, to connect directly to Electricity of Viet Nam\u2019s (EVN\u2019s) services. This has created a market for \u201cmiddle-\nmen\u201d, or meter landlords, who buy electricity from EVN and onsell to end-consumers at higher prices. This depletes \nthe intention of the substantial subsidies on the lowest tariff category. Subsidies in the sector are better able to reach \nthe  poor  in  Viet  Nam  than  in  most  other  countries  in  the  region.  This  is  because  of  the  high  connection  rates.  In \nurban areas, the poor do not receive the full benefit of subsidies due to the existence of meter landlords. The design \nof the tariff structure and the overall subsidy level is not particularly pro-poor. Reducing subsidies in the sector and \ntargeting the subsidy to the poor would be important. Affordability of up front charges and monthly charges among \nthe  ethnic  minorities  living  in  the  project  area  remains  an  issue.  The  poverty  analysis  has  been  summarized  in  a \nPoverty Impact Matrix (Table A13.1). \n \nC. \n \nIs  there  a  stakeholder  analysis?  Yes.  Consultations  regarding  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues  were \nundertaken  with  key  government  officials  and  the  affected  people,  and  will  continue  during  preparation  of \nsubprojects. During project implementation, stakeholders and the affected people will participate extensively.      \n \nIs  there  a  participation  strategy?  Yes.  The  Government\u2019s  Decree  80  (Regulation  for  Participatory  Investment \nSupervision) and Decree 79 (Grassroots Democracy) encourage community empowerment to undertake supervision \nand  monitoring  of  investment  made  in  the  interest  of  the  community.  The  gender  strategy  will  facilitate  effective \nimplementation  of  the  decrees  at  the  commune  level  to  monitor  resettlement  activities,  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking \nawareness campaign, and condition of labor camp under construction contract.  \n \nD. \n\nGender and Development \n\nParticipation Process \n\n  \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe gender analysis includes households affected by land acquisition. In Viet Nam, while the Land Law provides for \nequal land use and ownership, in reality a number of social and cultural traditions influence access to land by making \na distinction between social recognition and legal rights. For the Project, all data collected during the inventory of loss \nand socioeconomic survey for resettlement planning were gender disaggregated. The socioeconomic survey for the \nproject indicates that male and female households are engaged equally in Government services. However, a higher \npercentage of women is engaged in trade and sales. More men are engaged in daily labor than women. However, \nalong the Thanh Hoa\u2013Vinh transmission line, a relatively higher portion of women are engaged in construction work. \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  of  the  project  shows  that  high  proportions  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  including \nfemale-headed  households,  live  within  the  subproject  areas.  In  Viet  Nam,  female-headed  households  account  for \n26% of all households. In rural areas, women-headed households constitute 17% of all households, and the female-\nheaded households are vulnerable to shocks. In Son La\u2013Nho Quan and Son La-Soc Son 500 kV transmission line \nproject  areas,  16%  and  13%  of  the  households  are  headed  by  females,  respectively.  The  resettlement  plan  (RP) \nindicates  that  the  only  permanent  land  acquisition  associated  with  clearance  of  the  right-of-way  is  the  area  of \nresidential  and  garden  land  associated  with  the  house  or  structure  to  be  removed,  or  if  the  entire  plot  is  affected \nbecause  the  remaining  area  is  not  sufficient  to  rebuild  the  house  or  structure.  The  inventory  of  loss  (IOL)  has \nidentified  these  effects  on  an  individual  household  level.  The  locations  of  the  tower  foundations  will  not  be  known \nuntil the detailed design is complete. Therefore, only the approximate area of agricultural and forest land likely to be \nneeded temporarily, and that to be acquired permanently, is known at this stage. The IOL has aggregated district-\nlevel  data,  and  identifies  these  effects  at  a  provincial  level  in  terms  of  the  amount  of  agricultural,  forest,  rural \nresidential, and other land to be affected temporarily or permanently. During the updating of the plan, and once the \neffects  on  productive  land  are  known,  the  measures  to  support  and  restore  the  livelihoods  of  all  severely  affected  \nhouseholds can be identified in consultation with them. Field observation on the RP on Son LA Hydropower suggests \nthat  women  often  were  not  consulted on preparation  and  implementation  of the RP. Leaders of  the Women Union \nparticipated  little  in  the  District  Resettlement  Compensation  Management  Committee  (DRCMC).  A  separate \ngrievance  process  on  resettlement  issues  in  the  commune  and  district  level  does  not  exist.  Risks  associated  with \ntrafficking and HIV/AIDS among the migrant workers in the project areas are identifiable. To ensure participation of \nwomen in project activities during implementation of the RP and social support program, the following measures are \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n61 \n\nincluded in the gender strategy. Budget required to implement the gender strategy is included in the project costs.  \n \nGender Strategy: \n \n\n\u2022  At  the  inception  of  the  Project,  a  capacity  building  training  program  will  be  designed  for  the  women \ncommune  leaders  from  the  affected  commune,  with  priority  given  to  the  women  from  ethnic  minority \nhouseholds.  The  training  also  will  include  male  commune  leaders  and  representatives  of  the  mass \norganizations.  The  training  will  include  information  and  awareness  on  the  resettlement  activities  of  the \nProject.  The  awareness  and  leadership  skill  training  will  enhance  women\u2019s  participation  at  the  commune \nlevel  in  resettlement-related  discussions  and  commune  investment  supervisory  groups  under  Decree  80 \n(Regulation on the assignment of sale, business contracting, and lease of state companies) and Decree 79 \n(Regulation on the exercise of democracy in communes). Capacity building training also will be provided to \nthe leaders of the Women\u2019s Union to increase their participation in DRCMC; \nThe DRCMC will include women representatives from the District Women\u2019s Union to represent the interest \nof  women  and  women-headed  households  from  the  affected  households.  At  the  commune  level,  specific \nresettlement  committees  will  be  formed  to  discuss  the  RP  of  the  Project.  Specific  strategies  will  be \ndeveloped  to  encourage  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor  households  to  participate  in  resettlement \nplanning and implementation;  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  During  the  IOL,  men  and  women  from  the  households  will  participate  in  the  discussion  of  IOL.  At  the  \nvillage,  hamlet,  and  commune-level  discussion  for  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  RP,  separate \nmeetings  will  be  held  with  the  women  from  the  affected  households  and  female-headed  households  to \ndetermine  (i)  the  impacts  on  the  productive  land,  (ii)  problems  related  to  relocation  and  temporary \nrelocation of house, and (iii) the additional measures or specific assistance that are required to address the \nneeds of the women-headed households and women from the affected households;  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  DRCMC  and  commune  leaders  will  consult  separately  with  the  women-headed  households  and  women \nfrom  the  households  losing  more  than  10%  of  their  productive  land  to  identify  the  assistance  required  in \nterms of selection of sites for productive land, extension services, training, and capital support required to \nrestore their livelihood;  \nThe  RP  of  the  Project  includes  a  socioeconomic  support  program  with  a  focus  on  women,  specifically \nwomen-headed  households,  women  and  men  from  poor  households,  and  vulnerable  groups.    Specific \nattention  will  be  paid  to  (i)  restoring  economic  activities  of  the  women  from  garden  land;  (ii)  providing \nwomen  in  the  new  settlement  area  access  to  existing  agriculture  extension  and  microcredit  and  financial \nservices; and (iii) establishing links with a marketing facility and relevant technical assistance, as required;  \n\u2022  RP  will  include  joint  registration  of  land  use  rights  in  the  names  of  husband  and  wife  in  instances  where \n\nhouseholds are allocated alternative agriculture and/or residential land;  \n\n\u2022  Attention to complaints and grievances made by women, ethnic minorities, and poor households; \n\u2022 \n\nThe  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  awareness  campaign  will  involve  women\u2019s  union,  youth  union,  health \nworkers, and women community leaders; \n\n\u2022  Women as well as men from severely affected poor households will be prioritized for employment-related \n\ncivil works for the transmission lines; \n\n\u2022  As per the Labor Code (as amended in 2002), all employment for the subproject will respect Government \ncommitments to gender equity including (i) employment targets for women, as relevant to ethnic minorities; \n(ii)  ensure  that  no  child  labor  will  be  used;  (iii)  no  discrimination  against  the  employment  of  qualified \nwomen; and (iv) no differential wages paid to men and women for work of equal value; \n\n\u2022  Disaggregated  monitoring  indicators  by  gender  and  ethnic  groups  will  be  developed  for  management \n\ninformation system; \n\n \n\n\u2022  Gender sensitization training for relevant staff from EVN and Northern Power Project Management Board \n\n(NPPMB), members of the Provincial Resettlement Steering Committee, DRCMC, and commune leaders.  \n\nHas an output been prepared?  \nYes, a gender strategy has been prepared (see above). \nA national consultant on gender and development will be included in the consulting services for turning the gender \nissues  into  an  implementation  plan.

The  construction  began  in  2004  with \naccess  roads,  diversion  channels,  and  coffer  dams.  The  Prime  Minister  granted  special \napproval  to  start  the  works,  even  though  the  refinements  to  the  feasibility  study  (FS)  and  the \nfinal  EIA  are  not  done.  The  EIA  is  to  be  completed  and  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources and Environment (MONRE) by the end of 2005. \n \n3. \nThe HQHPP is on one of the two cascades on the Nam Mu River, a first level tributary \non the right bank of the Da River. It has been studied as part of the Master Plan for Da River \nHydropower Cascades, and was approved by the Prime Minister in 2002. HQHPP\u2019s FS-phase \nEIA was submitted to MONRE\u2019s in February 2005. It was granted conditional approval subject to \na list of revisions to be made before construction. Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) is making these \nrevisions.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nSeveral versions of the EIA prepared for SLHPP did not include an EMP as defined by \nthe  Government\u2019s  EIA  guidelines  for  hydropower  projects.  Six  technical  annexes  have  been \nprepared  for  individual  environmental  factors,  such  as  water  resources,  soil  environment, \ngeology  and  topography,  biodiversity,  and  socioeconomic  environment.  These  annexes \ndescribe  baseline  conditions,  predict  impacts,  and  recommend  mitigation  and  monitoring \nmeasures. Although the measures in these individual studies cover most of the relevant topics \nfor hydropower projects, they lack information on institutional arrangements and cost estimates. \nBefore completing that main EIA report, the mitigation and monitoring measures recommended \nin  the  individual  technical  annexes  need  to  be  consolidated  into  a  single  set  of  discrete \nmeasures for the Project to avoid, or minimize, the significant environmental impacts in the most \ncost-effective way. Ideally, these measures will be incorporated into a formal EMP with specific \nschedule, budget, and institutional arrangements.   \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan of SLHPP  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n65\n\nfor \n\nthat  EVN  will  begin  preparing  an  EMP \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan of HQHPP \n\nIn the absence of a formal EMP, as the final EIA report of SLHPP is still being prepared, \n5. \nimmediate \nan  agreement  was  reached \nimplementation.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  reviewed \nthe  EMP,  and  made \nrecommendations  to  improve  as  well  as  suggestions  on  the  institutional  arrangements  for  its \nimplementation. EVN has allocated staff and a budget of $200,000 for the implementation of the \nEMP  in  the  first  year.  EVN  also  requested  ADB  assistance  in  building  its  capacity  to  prepare, \nmonitor,  implement,  and  update  the  EMP  regularly  as  construction  progresses.  The  capacity \nbuilding also will include upstream and downstream impact mitigation measures. ADB technical \nassistance (TA) for $800,000 is being formulated to assist EVN in these matters. \n \nC. \n \nChapter VI of the FS EIA focuses on EMP, presenting budget information on mitigation \n6. \nand  monitoring  measures  for  (i)  reservoir  cleanup,  (ii)  demining  operations,  (iii)  restoration  of \nland  use,  (iv)  climate  and  hydrology  monitoring,  (v)  air  monitoring,  and  (vi)  fish  and  aquatic \norganism monitoring. A budget of $725,500 has been allocated for these items. In general, the \nmitigation  measures  proposed  in  the  EIA  for  HQHPP  cover  the  relevant  topics,  although  they \nare relatively vague and would need to be more site-specific. The institutional arrangements and \nresponsible agencies for the implementation of mitigation measures also need to be spelled out \nclearly.  Although  this  does  not  meet  the  ADB\u2019s  requirement,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  guidelines  on \nhydropower EIA do not specifically require such information.   \n \n7. \nThe  monitoring  activities  given  in  the  EIA  are  considered  adequate,  detailed,  and \nspecific in terms of the parameters required, number of monitoring points, frequency, and cost \nestimates,  as  well  as  the  institutional  arrangement  for  implementation.  This  section  could  be \nimproved by providing maps that show the monitoring points for each parameter. Suggestions \nhave been given to EVN for incorporation when finalizing the EIA. The monitoring program can \nbe considered adequate in meeting ADB\u2019s and Viet Nam\u2019s requirements.  \n \nD. \n\nField  Observations  of  Environmental  Impacts  and  Mitigation  and  Monitoring \nMeasures for SLHPP and HQHPP \n\nThe  SLHPP  dam  construction  has  not  started.  The  dam  will  be  135  meters  (m)  high, \n8. \ntopping  out  at  228  m  above  mean  sea  level.  The  construction  has  begun  on  the  diversion \nchannel,  which  will  be  90  m  wide,  857  m  long,  and  12  m  below  current  (dry  season)  river \nsurface level. The main channel is excavated mostly to design depth, with construction focusing \non leveling the rocky bottom to accommodate a concrete base and excavating a deeper channel \nto  take  dry  season  flow.  Dikes  are  being  built  across  the  river  at  the  site  of  the  future  power \nstation.  The  diversion  channel  and  dikes  will  be  finished  by  the  end  of  2005,  and  the  power \nstation will be completed in 2008. \n \n9. \nSeveral roads have been constructed, traversing very steep mountainsides. As such, the \nconstruction  involves  removing  large  volumes  of  earth  and  rock  to  make  way  for  the  road,  as \nwell as to create stable embankment faces in the hillsides above the roads. It was possible to \ntraverse only a sampling of the site and vicinity roads. In general, the roads appear to be well \ndesigned in terms of grade and slope of cut faces, though they could be improved through basic \nforms  of  drainage,  erosion  control  during  and  after  construction,  and  revegetation.  A  two-lane \nbridge has been built across the river below the dam. Two more bridges are planned within 2\u20133 \nkilometer (km) downstream of the dam. \n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n \n\n66 \n \n\nThe  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  (DONRE)  in  Son  La  Province \n10. \nstated that construction of a biological wastewater treatment plant for domestic sewage, and a \nlandfill  for  domestic  solid  waste  disposal,  started  recently  at  the  campsite  that  houses  5,000 \nworkers. In the interim, pit latrines have been built for the construction workers.  \n \nAbout 4 million cubic meters (m3) of material has been excavated, including 1 million m3 \n11. \nfor the diversion channel. As expected for so much earth removal in the river channel, siltation \nwas apparent in the river. However, in the absence of baseline data or documents in English, \ncomparing the sediment load of the Da River downstream of the dam with upstream sections, or \nwith  the  river  before  the  construction  began,  is  difficult.  Road  construction  and  especially \nswidden  agriculture  (slash  and  burn  on  steep  slopes),  which  are  prevalent  in  the  region, \ncontribute significantly to runoff, erosion, and sedimentation of the rivers. \n \n12. \nConstruction  has  not  started  for  the  proposed  HQHPP  site,  although  it  is  envisaged  to \nbegin in 2006. Similar to the Son La construction site, the reservoir area can be described as a \nsteep-walled valley with limestone pinnacles protruding from earthen hills. The natural mountain \nhas subtropical vegetation, and has been removed or impacted significantly throughout the area \nby slash-and-burn agriculture on the steep upper slopes, and rice paddies on the lower slopes \nand  in  the  valley  bottoms.  A  few  small  Thai  villages  are  along  the  road.  As  in  Son  La  and \nelsewhere  in  the  region,  road  construction  in  and  near  the  towns  appears  almost  continuous, \nwith extensive disturbed area left unpaved and  unvegetated. Streams appear to be carrying a \nhigh  sediment  load,  though  samples  were  not  taken.  Very  little,  if  any,  wild  animal  life  was \nobserved,  though  domesticated  animals  were  omnipresent.  Nonetheless,  the  valley  is \naesthetically very appealing. \n \nE. \n\nRecommendations  \n\n13. \nEIAs of the hydropower plants should be consolidated with environmental assessments \nfor  associated  actions,  including  roads,  and  resettlement  actions  to  provide  comprehensive \nresults to the Government for better policy decisions.    \n \n14. \nA  cumulative  EIA  should  be  performed.  SLHPP  and  HQHPP  projects  meet  the  criteria \nfor  a  cumulative  assessment  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.  The \nSLHPP  project  would  benefit  from  a  full-scale,  basin-wide,  cumulative  assessment.  This  was \ndiscussed  with  EVN  and  MONRE,  while  the  Government  requested  ADB  assistance  to \nundertake a cumulative assessment to follow the current project EIA. An ADB TA for $900,000 \nis  being  formulated  to  assist  MONRE  and  EVN  in  building  its  capacity  to  undertake  such \nassessments. \n\n \n15. \n\nAdditional recommendations include \n \n(i) \n\nPrepare and implement an EMP for SLHPP and HQHPP based on Government\u2019s \nEIA guidelines on hydropower projects.  \nAppoint a full-time environmental monitor in the field for SLHPP. \nInvolve  MONRE  in  the  implementation  of  hydropower  project  EMPs,  with \noversight responsibility beyond EIA approval and into the EMP implementation. \nDevelop  laws  requiring  preparation  and  implementation  of  EMPs  for  all  HPP \nprojects, irrespective of financing source.  \nBuild institutional capacity of DONREs to oversee EMP implementation.  \nBuild  capacity  of  River  Basin  Organizations  to  oversee  EMP  implementation. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n67\n\nSUMMARY SOCIAL DUE DILIGENCE OF SON LA AND HUOI QUANG  \nHYDROPOWER PROJECTS \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA.  \n \n1. \nThe Government of Viet Nam is financing the 2,400 megawatt (MW) Son La Hydropower \nProject (SLHPP) and 560 MW Huoi Quang Hydropower Project (HQHPP). About 96,000 people \nwill have to be relocated as a result of these two hydropower projects. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) engaged the Government in policy dialogue on resettlement and compensation in \nthe  context  of  processing  the  Northern  Power  Expansion  Sector  Project.  The  Government \nagreed to have ADB undertake due diligence with several objectives: (i) determine the status of \nresettlement  planning  and  implementation  of  the  two  hydropower  projects,  (ii)  determine  if \nresettlement planning and implementation complies with Government laws and regulations, (iii) \nidentify outstanding issues and gaps between planning and implementation and Government\u2019s \npolicies,  (iv)  assess  any  gaps  between  implementation  and  international  best  practices  in \nsafeguard  policies,  and  (v)  recommend  ways \nimprove  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation to meet Government\u2019s standards.   \n\nto \n\nLegal and Policy Framework \n\n2. \nIn this context, meetings were held with representatives of Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN); \nmembers of Son La Hydropower Project Management Board (SLHPPMB); Huoi Quang Project \nManagement  Board  (HQPPMB);  officials  from  the  provincial,  district,  and  commune  people\u2019s \ncommittees (PPC, DPC, and CPC, respectively) of Son La, Lai Chau, and Dien Bien provinces; \nrepresentatives  from  the  provincial  and  district  resettlement  committees  (DRC);  party  cells; \nNational Institute of Agricultural Production and Projection (NIAPP); and Ministry of Agriculture \nand Rural Development (MARD). \n \n3. \nField visits, observations, interviews, and discussions with commune and village officials, \naffected  households,  and  host  communities  at  the  pilot  resettlement  sites  and  proposed \nresettlement  sites  were  carried  out.  Semi-structured  questionnaires  also  were  utilized  in \ngathering information.  Details of the due diligence are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nPrime Minister Special Decision 459/QD-TTg. For SLHPP, the Prime Minister issued \nDecision  No  92/QD-TTg,  dated  15  January  2004,  approving  $686  million  for  the  resettlement \nand compensation associated with SLHPP. In 12 May 2004, the Prime Minister issued Special \nDecision  459/QD-TTg,  based  on  the  Decree  22/1998/CP,  which  provides  policies  on \nresettlement and compensation, as well as lessons learned from the resettlement pilot sites in \nTan Lap and Muong Chum communes (Son La Province) and Siphaphin commune (Dien Bien \nProvince). The general principles of special decision are to ensure that (i) the standard of living \nof the affected population is restored and improved, and housing and income is better than at \nthe  former  site;  (ii)  equal  benefits  of  relocatees  and  host  communities  to  maintain  social \nharmony; (iii) relocation sites provide adequate production land for affected population, and that \nproviding  production  land  is  prioritized;  and  (iv)  compensation  and  assistance  are  carried  out \ndemocratically, transparently, and effectively. \n \n5. \nSpecial Decision 459/QD-TTg presents advancement in terms of compensation payment \nfor  various  losses,  as  it  is  based  on  replacement  cost  or  current  market  value  at  the  time  of \ncompensation  payment.  Unlike  Decree  22/1998,  which  provides  land  for  nonlegal  users  on  a \ncase-by-case  basis,  Special  Decision  459/QD-TTg  provides  replacement  land  and  assistance \nregardless  of  legal  status.  Furthermore,  the  affected  population  will  not  only  receive \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n \n\n68 \n \n\nreplacement  land  and  houses;  but  also  will  be  entitled  to  transition  allowances  (e.g.,  rice \nsubsidy,  moving  allowance,  health,  education,  cooking  fuel,  electricity  fees  assistance), \nlivelihood and economic programs, and basic services and community infrastructures.   \n \nFollowing  Special  Decision  459,  the  provinces  of  Son  La,  Lai  Chau,  and  Dien  Bien \n6. \nissued  their  respective  PPC  decisions  for  preparing  and  implementing  detailed  plans  for \nSLHPP. For HQHPP, resettlement planning is continuing, and Lai Chau province also will adopt \nSpecial Decision 459 in their issuance of a PPC decision.   \n \n7. \nMaster  Plan  on  Resettlement  and  Compensation  and  Detailed  Resettlement \nPlans.1 In addition to the Special Decision 459/QD-TTg, the Prime Minister approved the Master \nPlan on Resettlement and Compensation in November 2004. The master plan was revised and \nfinalized in February 2005, and is now used as a basis for preparing detailed RPs.  The master \nplan  provides  information  about  the  resettlement  areas,  as  well  as  general  guidelines  on  the \nproper  and  timely  preparation  and  implementation  of  detailed  RPs.  The  document  also  stated \nthat  further  in-depth  studies  would  have  to  be  undertaken,  and  that  the  programs  need  to  be \nadjusted accordingly during detailed planning and implementation to reflect the situations in the \nresettlement sites, which might require further approval of MARD and PPC. \n \n8. \nThe  master  plan  envisages  about  14,993  households  will  be  affected  by  the  SLHPP. \nHowever, taking into account 4% population growth to 2010, an estimated 18,897 households \n(about  90,000  people)  will  have  to  be  relocated  by  2010.  The  host  communities  from  83 \ncommunes affected by land recovery are estimated at 12,000 households.   \n \nThe  master  plan  noted  a  number  of  difficulties  and  limitations  in  implementing \n9. \nresettlement programs in the three provinces (Son La, Dien Bien, and Lai Chau): (i) almost all \nrelocatees are ethnic minorities; (ii) the terrain is complex and divided, and land and water are \nlimited;  (iii)  the  area  is  beset  by  low  productivity  of  land  and  absence  of  markets;  (iv) \ninfrastructure is lacking; and (v) training and change of occupations are needed. Nonetheless, \nthe report also presents potential development opportunities from agriculture and silviculture. It \nindicates  that  socioeconomic  programs  of  the  three  provinces  are  being  maintained;  that  the \npeople have a positive perception of resettlement, as it is conceived as part of the development \nproject that will provide benefits; and that local authorities and host communities are supporting \nthem. \n \n10. \nThe master plan also mentioned the respective roles and responsibilities of MARD and \nthe PPCs in preparing and implementing detailed RPs. The budget indicated in the master plan \nis $686.3 million. EVN will finance 45% ($308.9 million), while the Government will finance 49% \n($333.3  million).  The  remaining  6%  ($44.1  million),  specifically  for  investment  in  livelihood \nprograms  (agriculture,  animal  breeding,  and  forest  plantation  programs),  will  be  sourced  from \nthe  Government\u2019s  People\u2019s  Credit  Fund.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  was  tasked  to  manage  the \ninvestment and prepare annual allocation plan to provincial investors.     \n \n\n                                                 \n1 The Government\u2019s Son La Master Plan is equivalent to ADB\u2019s Resettlement Framework, while detailed resettlement \n\nplans are similar to those of ADB\u2019s resettlement plans. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n69\n\nSon  La  Hydropower  Project:  Summary  of  Gaps  Between  Government\u2019s  Policies \nand Implementation at the Pilot Resettlement Sites \n\nC. \n \n \n11. \nBefore Special Decision  459/Qd-TTg was issued,  PPC\u2019s  issued  decisions  pertaining  to \nthe relocation of households to the pilot resettlement sites. From 2000 to 2003, 675 relocatees, \nmostly  Thai  ethnic  minorities,  were  moved  to  the  three  pilot  resettlement  sites.  Some  200 \nrelocatees went  to  the Siphaphin  pilot  resettlement  site, while  475  relocatees  went  to  the  Tan \nLap  and  Muong  Chum  pilot  resettlement  sites.  Host  communities  affected  by  land  recovery \ncomprised 143 households from Siphaphin commune, and 770 households from Tan Lap and \nMuong Chum communes. \n \n12. \nDue  diligence  in  the  three  pilot  resettlement  sites  produced  common  findings.  For \nexample, not all provisions as stipulated in the PPC decisions were provided to relocatees and \nhost communities. Some outstanding issues and problems remain at the resettlement sites:   \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nLiving  conditions.  Their  living  conditions  did  not  improve,  and  in  some \ninstances  were  worse  than  the  relocatees\u2019  former  living  standards.  In  the  Tan \nLap resettlement site, 50 households went back to the reservoir areas to cultivate \ntheir  former  land.  Almost  all  relocatees  cannot  access  land  allocated  to  them, \nbecause the land had belonged to host communities that were not compensated \nfor  the  recovered  land.  Host  communities  in  Siphaphin  commune,  whose  land \nwas  recovered,  are  experiencing  5\u20136  months  food  shortage.  Further,  the  non-\ncompensation  to  host  communities created  hostilities  and  social  tensions  at  the \nsite. Houses of relocatees reportedly were hit at night, and children were bullied \nin school.   \nInformation  disclosure  and  participation.  The  relocatees  were  not  properly \ninformed and not consulted adequately. The host communities were notified only \nonce  before  land  recovery.  Details  on  pricing  and  timing  of  the  inventory  of \nlosses  (IOL)  and  land  recovery  were  not  provided  to  them.  Clearing  of  land  by \ncontractors  without  prior  knowledge  of  host  communities  led  to  serious  loss  of \nland  and  crops.  In  addition,  the  relocatees  or  host  communities  were  not \nrepresented on the resettlement committees.  \nLand  recovered  from  host  communities.  Land  recovered  and  affected  crops \nand  trees  from  host  communities  were  not  recorded  properly.  As  a  result,  they \nwere  not  compensated.  Host  communities  in  the  Siphaphin  commune  received \ncompensation  2  years  after  land  was  recovered.  Not  all  host  communities \nreceived full payment due to them. \nCash  payment  for  land  and  other  assets.  Some  land,  crops,  and  trees  were \nnot  inventoried  because  the  areas  were  not  accessible.  The  age  of  trees  also \nwas  downgraded.  Not  all  garden  land  and  fishponds  included  in  the  inventory \nwere  compensated.  Unit  prices  applied  for  crops  and  trees  were  lower  than \naverage market prices. \nProduction land. In Tan Lap, land allocated to relocatees is smaller than what \nthey  had  before.  The  productivity  of  land  is  also  low  (one  harvest  season).  An \nirrigation system is lacking. The affected population finds it difficult to improve the \nsituation and make the land productive. Some relocatees received less land than \nothers due to a shortage at the resettlement sites. In Siphaphin, irrigation that will \nbe  operational  in  June  2005  will  benefit  only  30%  of  relocatees.  Provincial \ngovernments admitted that land is insufficient to allocate for relocatees and host \ncommunities. \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n \n\n70 \n \n\n(vi) \n\nResidential  land,  housing,  and  other  facilities  at  the  resettlement  sites.  \nQuality of house construction was poor. Although houses built were patterned on \ntraditional  houses,  they  did  not  fully  incorporate  ethnic  customs  and  beliefs. \nWater supply is also inadequate to meet the demands of the village.   \n\n(vii)  Resettlement  allowances.  The  rice  subsidy  provided  was  insufficient  and  the \nlivelihood  programs  implemented  was  not  successful.  The  land  allocated  for \nrelocation is small and its productivity low. The cash equivalent of rice subsidy is \nlower than the local market prices. In Tan Lap, an education allowance was not \nprovided. Cash assistance for moving graves was lower than what was stipulated \nin the PPC decision. \n\n(viii)  Livelihood and economic programs. The livelihood programs carried out were \nnot successful. Cows that were imported from New Zealand died due to different \nweather  conditions  and  environment.  Relocatees  have  no  experience  in  cow \nbreeding,  and  training  and  supervision  from  the  company  responsible  for  the \nprogram  was  lacking.  For  tea  growing,  tea  will  take  more  than  3  years  before \nhouseholds  can  start  harvesting  produce.  Tea  land  for  allocation  to  relocatees \nwho  wanted  to  join  the  program  was  inadequate.  For  bamboo  and  sugarcane \ngrowing, technical know-how on selling the produce was missing, and the market \nis  40  kilometer  (km)  away  from  resettlement  site.  Relocatees  have  no  other \nsources of income. \nGrievance  redress.  Complaints  or  grievances  filed  by  relocatees  and  host \ncommunities since 2001 have not been resolved. \nEthnic  minorities.  Ethnic  norms  and  practices  were  not  given  adequate \nconsideration.  Changes  and  livelihood  programs  were  imposed  on  them.  Thus, \nthey are facing difficulties reestablishing their lives. \nImplementation  arrangements.  The  resettlement  committees  have  a  limited \nnumber of qualified field staff. Son La Provincial Resettlement Committee alone \nhas 60 staff, though most are involved in administration and finance. Most of the \nfieldwork  is  done  at  the  district  level.  The  district  level  staff  also  do  not  have \nexperience in implementing resettlement and compensation activities.   \n\n(xi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nHuoi  Quang  Hydropower  Project:  Status  of  Resettlement  Planning  and \nImplementation \n\n \nD. \n \n \n13. \nResettlement  planning  is  continuing.  IOL  activities  are  being  carried  out  based  on  the \nfeasibility study prepared for HQHPP in 2003. Once the IOL is approved, detailed resettlement \nplanning  will  be  carried  out.  As  per  feasibility  study  schedule,  construction  works  will  start  in \nJanuary 2006 and will be completed in 2009. \n \n14. \nThe  feasibility  study  (FS)  reported  that  891  households,  mostly  Thai  ethnic  minorities \nfrom  four  communes  and  two  districts,  will  have  to  relocate  to  two  resettlement  sites  in  Than \nUyen District. Due diligence findings show that the relocatees from Muong Kim commune will be \nrelocated  within  the  same  commune.  However,  the  proposed  site  is  12  km  away  from  the \naffected  area  (reservoir),  on  top  of a  mountain (950  meter high),  and inhabited  by  the Hmong \nethnic minorities.  Further, the site lacks a water supply system. The Mission was informed that \nthe plan is to develop the water supply and irrigation systems in the area, though the timing of \nthis  plan  still  is  being  discussed  at  the  DPC  and  PPC  levels.  Interviews  with  affected  village \nleaders and households show that they were informed about the Project and impacts in general, \nthough the details on when and where they will relocate are not known. When the due diligence \nteam discussed the proposed site in Muong Kim, village leaders and affected households stated \nthat  they  cannot  survive  in  the  mountains,  because  of  the  cold  weather  and  the  absence  of  a \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n71\n\nwetland  in  the  area.  They  also  suggested  that  they  cannot  live  together  with  Hmong  ethnic \nminorities at the proposed site. The Hmong ethnic minorities (host communities in Muong Kim) \nalso were interviewed, and they also stated that Thai ethnic minorities cannot live in their area \ndue  to  the  cold  climate  and  the  land  in  their  area  is  not  productive.  Hmong  ethnic  minorities \nstated that they already have a food shortage for 6 months per year.   \n \n15. \nThe  second  resettlement  site  is  at  Moung  Than  Commune,  45  km  away  from  the \nreservoir along National Road 32. Under the proposal, the relocatees from Moung Kim and Ta \nGia communes will be relocated in the site. Hmong and Thai ethnic minorities inhabit the area. \nAgain, the area lacks an irrigation system, and appears not to have any unutilized or unclaimed \nland.  Initial  interviews  with  the  host  communities  stated  that  they  were  not  consulted  on  any \nresettlement  planning.  They  added  that  they  are  unwilling  to  share  their  land,  because  they \nhave invested so much in it over the years. The commune chairman from the host communities \nalso  reported  that  the  resettlement  planning  has  not  been  carried  out  properly,  because  the \nresettlement sites selected did not take into consideration the current land use of the area. The \nsites were selected, the chairman said, solely based from an old land use map.    \n\nOngoing Activities, Concerns, and Issues Raised \n\nE. \n \n16. \nFor  SLHPP,  the  PPC  and  resettlement  committees  at  all  levels  acknowledged  the \noutstanding issues and problems at the pilot resettlement sites. They said that the resettlement \nimplementation activities were carried out before the issuance of Special Decision 459/QD-TTg.  \nThey added that resettlement is very complex, and they learned a lot from their shortcomings.  \nSon  La  PPC  stated  that  they  are  trying  to  address  the  problems  by  convening  an  appraisal \ngroup to assess the problems at the pilot resettlement sites directly. Dien Bien PPC stated that \nthey do not have any plans to address these issues. \n \nFor  the  remaining  population  that  will  be  relocated,2  the  following  concerns  also  were \n17. \nraised: (i) not enough information and lack of detailed studies on land and water availability and \nsustainability;  (ii)  poor  preparation  of  the  master  plan,  and  inaccurate  and  inadequate \npreparation  of  detailed  RPs;  (iii)  lack  of  capacity  of  assigned  staff  to  carry  out  such  complex \ntasks  involving  resettlement  of  thousands  of  households;  (iv)  inadequate  information  on  the \nimpacts on host communities that will be affected by land recovery; (iv) Thai ethnic minorities, \nwho  are  dependent  on  wetlands  and  who  need  to  adjust  to  the  new  environment;  and  (v) \ninsufficient  information  dissemination  and  consultation.  They  also  recognize  that  the  risk  of \nimpoverishment is very high if income restoration and economic programs are not put in place \nat  the  resettlement  sites.  They  stated  that  these  programs  are  crucial  for  the  survival  of \nrelocatees and host communities. They added that relocatees are provided with rice subsidies \nfor only 2 years, and that they need to have successful livelihood programs to ensure that they \nwill be able to sustain themselves.   \n \n18. \nIn  discussions  on  the  plight  of  the  affected  population  at  the  pilot  resettlement  sites, \nSLHPPMB and EVN indicated that they have no role in resettlement implementation, other than \nproviding  46%  of  the  funds.  The  responsibility  lied  with  the  provinces  concerned.  They  also \nrecognized the limitations of the resettlement committees at all levels due to the complexity of \nresettlement activities. Further, they noted, the resettlement committees have limited staff and \n\n                                                 \n2  By  the  end  of  2005,  Son  La  Province  will  start  relocating  2,000  households,  while  Dien  Bien  Province  also  is \n\nscheduled to relocate 300 households. Relocation activities are expected to be completed by 2009.   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n \n\n72 \n \n\nConclusion and Recommendations \n\nGaps Between ADB\u2019s Social Safeguard Policies and Government Implementation \n\nexperience  on  resettlement.  They  added  that  capacity  building  is  needed,  and  suggested  that \nADB provide assistance to the resettlement committees for the implementation activities. \n \n19. \nFor  HQHPP,  the  PPC  and  DRC  concurred  with  the  due  diligence  findings  that  the \nproposed  sites  are  unacceptable  and  require  careful  and  detailed  studies.  The  quality  of  the \ndraft IOL report is poor. It lacks consultation with relocatees and host communities, and requires \nproper identification and assessment of impacts and planning of proposed sites. The DRC also \nemphasized  the  need  for  sustainable  livelihood  programs.  The  DRC  also  mentioned  that  they \ndo not have enough qualified staff to carry out resettlement planning and implementation, and \nthat training and capacity building are required.   \n \nF. \n \n20. \nExcept  on  gender  issues  and  monitoring,  the  Special  Decision  459/QD-TTg  and  PPC \ndecisions  adopted  for  the  remaining  affected  population  are  very  close  to  ADB\u2019s  social \nsafeguard policies and requirements. However, due diligence findings show that the main issue \nis the need to ensure proper implementation of Government policies and regulations. Additional \nqualified staff clearly are needed. Further, resettlement committees lack the capacity to prepare \nand  implement  detailed  plans,  as  well  as  the  Government\u2019s  plan  to  accelerate  resettlement \nactivities to meet the overall project schedule.   \n \nG. \n \n21. \nAlthough the Government did not comply fully with their own policy, and did not meet the \nobjectives of improving the lives of the relocatees and host communities at the pilot resettlement \nsites, the Government acknowledges these outstanding issues under the SLHPP. For example, \nSon La recently took up measures to address the land shortage issue. Resettlement planning \nand  implementation  activities  are  continuing.  Thus,  the  situation  still  can  be  improved  and \nrectified.   \n \n22. \nFor  the  pilot  resettlement  sites,  the  failure  to  address  the  immediate  need  for  a \ncompatible  and  culturally  appropriate  livelihood  programs  poses  the  risk  that  people  would  be \nled  into  more  hardships  and  dire  poverty.  It  would  also  continue  to  create  hostilities, \nundermining  social  cohesion  in  the  area,  unless  the  impacts  on  host  communities  are \naddressed properly.   \n \nFor  the  remaining  affected  population  in  Son  La  and  Huoi  Quang  HPPs,  a  similar \n23. \nsituation  might  occur  if  these  issues  are  not  addressed  in  a  timely  and  effective  manner.  As \nsuch,  the  Government  agreed  to  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  for  $1  million  to  build  the \ncapacity of the provincial and district officials in the planning and implementation of RPs, as well \nas  in  defining  the  livelihood  programs  based  on  the  available  resources  in  resettlement  sites. \nSuch a TA is being proposed from the Poverty Reduction Fund to engage international and local \nexperts to assist the Government in addressing the specific recommendations: \n \n\n(i) \n\nFor the Pilot Resettlement Sites (Son La HPP) \n\n(a) \n\ninvestigations \n\nUndertake  detailed \nlosses, \ncompensation  received,  and  additional  compensation  payment  and \nassistance due to relocatees and host communities to be able to address \ngrievances  and  rectify  inadequate  compensation  for  host  communities \nand relocatees. \n\nto  determine  actual \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n73\n\n(b) \n\nto \nUndertake  consultations  with  relocatees  and  host  communities \ndetermine  the  extent  of  additional  allowances  required,  such  as  the \nprovision of additional rice subsidies and provision of fertilizers and seeds \nto increase productivity of land.  \n\n(ii) \n\nFor the Remaining Affected Population (Son La and Huoi Quang HPPs)  \n\n(a) \n\nCarefully  prepare  socioeconomic  baseline  survey  and  assessment  of \nimpacts, including downstream impacts. \n\n(iii) \n\nFor  the  Pilot  Resettlement  Sites  (Son  La  HPP)  and  Remaining  Affected \nPopulation (Son La and Huoi Quang HPPs) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nDesign  and  implement  an  effective  and  culturally  appropriate  livelihood \nprogram with full participation of the relocatees and host communities, so \nthat their income and standard of living improve. \nSet  up  an  effective  and  culturally  appropriate  grievance  mechanism  by \nestablishing  permanent  grievance  offices  at  the  resettlement  sites  to \nensure that people know where to make complaints, and that they will be \nheard and addressed fairly. Grievance officers must be knowledgeable in \ndealing  with  complaints  and  make  all  reasonable  attempts  to  resolve \nissues  and  complaints  at  the  commune  level  in  a  timely  and  efficient \nmanner  through  community  consultation.  As  required,  nongovernment \norganizations,  mediators,  and \nfacilitators,  as  well  as  social  and \nresettlement experts will be involved. \nMake  information  dissemination,  consultation,  and  participation  fully \ninformative,  transparent,  culturally  appropriate,  and  gender  sensitive  to \nrelocatees and host communities throughout the life of the Project. \nCarry  out  further  studies  on  land  availability  and  capability,  and  water \nresources  availability  and  development  of  irrigation  systems  to  ensure \nadequate  production  land,  so  that  all  relocatees  and  host  communities \ncan improve their income and standard of living.   \nEstablish  a  mechanism  to  assist  relocatees  who  might  wish  to  group \nthemselves  together  and  opt  to  find  their  own  resettlement  sites.  For \nexample,  a  small  group  of  five  to  10  households  might  purchase \ncollectively  a  suitable  piece  of  land,  which  they  have  full  knowledge  of \nand where the social support system is already in place (i.e., relatives and \nfriends living within the identified area of preference).   \nSet  up  an  effective  monitoring  system \nimpacts  and \nimplementation issues, so that changes and improvements can be made \nto meet overall objectives. \n\nto  monitor \n\nIncrease  the  number  of  provincial  and  district  resettlement  committee \nmembers, as required, and ensure that the affected population is properly \nrepresented in the committees. \nUndertake  training  and  capacity  building  to  strengthen  institutional \ncapability  for  managing  the  resettlement,  compensation,  and  economic \nand livelihood programs. \n\n \n\nFor Resettlement Committees \n\n \n(iv) \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2005) \n", "Currency Unit \u2013 dong (D) \nD1.00 = $0.00006291 \n$1.00 = D15,895 \n \nFor the purpose of calculations in this report, the exchange rates of $1.00 = D16,000   \n.  \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAIDS \nCARB \nCPPMB \nCPRGS \nDRC \nDSCR \nEIRR \nEMP \nERA \nEVN \nFIRR \nGDP \nGMS \nHIV \nHQHPP \nICB \nIEE \nIOE \nIPP \nJBIC \nLCB \nLIBOR \nMARD \nMOI \nMONRE \nNPPMB \nNPV \nOCR \nPDMP \nPPC \nPRC \nRAP \nRF \nRP \nSERF \nSida \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome \nCompensation and Resettlement Board \nCentral Power Project Management Board \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy \ndistrict resettlement committee \ndebt service coverage ratio \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironment management plan \nElectricity Regulatory Authority \nElectricity of Viet Nam \nfinancial internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nGreater Mekong Subregion \nhuman immunodeficiency virus \nHuoi Quang Hydropower Project \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nInstitute of Energy \nindependent power producer \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nlocal competitive bidding \nLondon interbank offered rate \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n\u2013  Ministry of Industry \n\u2013  Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment \nNorthern Power Project Management Board \n\u2013 \nnet present value \n\u2013 \nordinary capital resources \n\u2013 \nPower Development Master Plan \n\u2013 \nprovincial people\u2019s committee \n\u2013 \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \n\u2013 \nresettlement action plan \n\u2013 \nresettlement framework  \n\u2013 \nresettlement plan \n\u2013 \nshadow exchange rate factor \n\u2013 \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency  \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "SLHP \nSOE \nSTD \nTA \nWACC \n", "GWh \nkV \nkm \nkW \nkWh \nMVA \nMW \nTWh \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", "Son La Hydropower Project \nstate-owned enterprise \nsexually transmitted disease \ntechnical assistance \nweighted average cost of capital \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "gigawatt-hour (1,000 kWh) \nkilovolt (1,000 volts) \nkilometer \nkilowatt (1,000 watts) \nkilowatt-hour (1,000 watt-hours) \nmegavolt-ampere (1,000 kilovolt amperes) \nmegawatt (1,000 watts) \nterawatt-hours \n", " \n \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, $ refers to US dollars. \n", "Director General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", "R.
