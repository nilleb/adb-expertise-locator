THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand a proposed grant, both to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Resilient Community \nDevelopment Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of two grants: one \nto be provided by the Asia Investment Facility financed by the European Union and the other by \nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), and if the Board approves the proposed loan and \ngrant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of \nboth grants.1  \n \n2.  The project will target areas that are vulnerable to climate and disaster risk (CDR) and will \nfollow a phased, cluster approach, grouping vulnerable townships in the same area. The project \nhas identified clusters of 17 poor townships in regions exposed to CDR using climate projections \nand 2014 census data.2 It will benefit about 1.8 million people in 2,942 villages in Ayeyarwady, \nChin, Sagaing, and Tanintharyi Regions. The project will support the Government of Myanmar in \nstrengthening its community-based development (CBD) policies and procedures. It will strengthen \ncommunity  resilience  and  reduce  the  food  insecurity  and  poverty  of  rural  people  living \nin vulnerable areas, by building their capacity and providing resources to invest sustainably in \nclimate- and disaster-resilient and market-oriented infrastructure and livelihoods.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country context. Myanmar is undergoing rapid change. Since 2011, the government has \nbeen pursuing wide-ranging economic, social, political, and governance reforms. New policies \nand  strategies  are  being  implemented  to  address  development  challenges,  including  rural \ndevelopment, education reform, and food security and nutrition. Myanmar\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct grew by 6.2% in 2018 and is projected to continue growing rapidly, reaching 6.6% in \n2019.4  \n \n4.  Poverty remains high in rural areas. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in \nSoutheast Asia. Poverty was estimated at 32.1% in 2015, down from 48.2% in 2004, with 84% of \nthe poor living in rural areas. 5 Malnutrition rates are among the highest in the region. Twenty-nine \npercent of children under the age of five are stunted and 18.9% are underweight.6 The poor have \nlow levels of human capital and tend to be highly exposed to various CDR-related shocks and \nstresses. 7 The rural poor rely on agriculture and casual labor for their livelihood.  \n \n5.  Rural development. Myanmar\u2019s rural areas are underdeveloped: (i) only 16% of rural \npeople have access to electricity through the public grid, (ii) nearly three out of 10 lack access to \nyear-round improved drinking water, (iii) one out of four lacks access to improved sanitation, and \n                                                           \n1  The Asia Investment Facility grant is financed by the European Union. The JFPR grant is financed by the Government \nof Japan. Both grants will be fully administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2   Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

New York. \n \n ", "2   \n(iv) a fourth of the rural population is not connected by any road. Agriculture, which accounts for \n25.7% of the gross domestic product and about 49% of employment, is the main source of rural \nlivelihoods.8 Key agriculture sector constraints include (i) limited public spending, resulting in gaps \nin rural infrastructure and human development; (ii) limited access to finance, inputs, and better \ntechnologies; (iii) high exposure and vulnerability to CDR; and (iv) limited institutional capacity. \n \n6.  High risk to disasters and climate change. Myanmar ranks among the highest in the \n2017 Global Climate Risk Index. 9  Almost the entire country is prone to a range of natural hazards. \nHigh exposure in hazard-prone areas, livelihood dependency on climate-sensitive sectors, and \nlow capacity to identify and reduce risks negatively impact the poor. Resilience-building measures \ncan support communities, including women, in resisting, absorbing, adapting to, and recovering \nfrom climate- and disaster-related shocks and stresses, thereby reducing the risk of CDR-induced \nintergenerational transfer of poverty. Climate conditions are projected to change dramatically, and \nvulnerability in agriculture, water resources, public health, forestry, and coastal systems is \nexpected to increase (footnote 2).  \n \n7.  Limited institutional capacity. Myanmar has a legacy of centralized decision-making \nand administrative processes. Limited technical and administrative capacity is an issue, especially \nin townships. Myanmar\u2019s development paradigm, however, recognizes the important role of \ncommunities, as evidenced by the recent formalization of participatory village development plan \n(VDP) processes.10   \n \n8.  Community-based development effectively strengthens resilience. CBD approaches \nare  an  effective  tool  for  bringing  communities  to  the  forefront  of  poverty  reduction  and \ndevelopment, allowing them to manage resources directly through block grants to identify, design, \nand implement solutions that address their infrastructure and livelihood needs. Evidence from \nCBD projects indicates an improvement in incomes and well-being, including increases in per \ncapita consumption, greater use of basic services, and higher school participation. Indonesia\u2019s \nexperience showed a 9.2% increase in the likelihood of poor households moving out of poverty \ncompared with areas without CBD.11 The costs of works are generally lower than those of works \nbuilt by contractors for the same type and quality, with cost savings ranging from 8.0% to 76.0% \ndepending on the project type.12 A recent study of CBD projects in Myanmar also indicates that \ntheir economic benefits significantly exceed the costs.13 With CDR impacts felt most locally, CBD\u2019s \nparticipatory approaches allow the identification of localized risks, their historical patterns, and \nobserved changes; and assessment of the exposure of people, assets, and livelihoods. Since \n2011, the Department of Rural Development (DRD) has led the implementation of CBD projects \nfor a total amount of $685 million, supporting 8.8 million people in 237 townships.14 \n \n                                                           \n8  World Bank. 2018.

Value  added  by  ADB  assistance  and  lessons.  The  experience  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in CBD in Myanmar and in the region, especially in the Philippines, and \nlearning from the CBD projects of other development partners informed the project design \n(footnote 11). Key lessons include (i) aligning with government community planning systems; \n(ii) applying  an  integrated  mix  of  rural  infrastructure,  livelihoods,  and  capacity  building; \n(iii) allocating  sufficient  resources  and  time  for  community  engagement  and  mobilization; \n(iv) timely provision of information on CDR and market opportunities for community planning; \n(v) improving the participation and empowerment of women and the poor through increased \nfacilitation support; (vi) ensuring that community infrastructure subprojects are built to higher \nstandards of resilience, include a sustainable operations and maintenance plan, and are of a \nscale that improves economic outcomes; and (vii) promoting livelihood resilience by diversifying \nsources of income, building technical and vocational skills, and linking communities to markets \nand  service  providers.  The  project  will  follow  a  conflict-sensitive  approach  and  will  create \nsynergies and links with ongoing and planned ADB operations to generate greater impact.15 The \ntechnical assistance for Strengthening Climate and Disaster Resilience of Myanmar Communities \nwill provide CDR modeling information and climate forecasts (footnote 15).  \n \n10.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan, \n2018\u20132030; the Agriculture Development Strategy and Investment Plan, 2018\u20132023; the Climate \nSmart Agriculture Strategy; the National Framework for Community Disaster Resilience; the Rural \nDevelopment Strategic Framework; and ADB\u2019s Myanmar country partnership strategy, 2017\u2013\n2021. The project directly supports four of the seven operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \n(Table 1).16  \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priority  Project Interventions \nAddressing remaining  Community empowerment to prioritize and implement climate- and disaster-resilient \npoverty and reducing  infrastructure investments will reduce risks and stressors that can tip households into \ninequalities  poverty.

The project will have the following outcome: \nstandard of living and resilience of targeted communities improved.17 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output 1: Climate- and disaster-resilient community infrastructure developed. Three \nthousand climate- and disaster-resilient community infrastructure subprojects will be identified \nthrough a participatory VDP and funded through block grants.18 Climate risk and vulnerability \nassessments and market opportunity analysis will be made available to communities for their local \nassessment in prioritizing infrastructure investments. Criteria for selection include the contribution \nto resilience and public and economic good benefits.19 Village women will be empowered through \ndedicated meetings, and quotas for representation on committees (50%) and in labor (40%). \nSubprojects with the highest benefit to women will receive a weighting value up to 20% out of \n100%  during  the  selection  of  eligible  subprojects  to  influence  community  infrastructure \nprioritization. Typical community infrastructures will include village access or farm roads, small \nbridges, water supply, electric grid connection, and multipurpose centers. The project will finance \nthree multi-phased cycles of community planning and subproject implementation.20 The first cycle \nwill cover all villages in each of the 17 target townships. Subsequent cycles will be performance-\nbased and open to village tracts21 that have achieved a minimum social and infrastructure quality \nassessment review score.22 Each infrastructure investment cycle will amount to MK10 million per \nvillage or a per capita investment of MK30,000 per village person, whichever is higher.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Resilient livelihood activities for poor men and women developed. At least \n15,000 resilient livelihood subprojects will be funded through block grants. As part of the VDP \nprocess, communities will identify the lowest four deciles of poor and vulnerable households in \ntheir villages using a participatory wealth and vulnerability ranking methodology.23 That cohort will \nbe eligible to apply for livelihood subprojects, valued at up to MK300,000 per household. Targeted \nhouseholds will be enabled to form groups with a common livelihood interest and to submit a \nlivelihood subproject proposal. Livelihood subprojects could include new or improved climate-\nsmart agriculture, livestock, fisheries activities, value addition to farm and nonfarm products, \nmarketing, and the acquisition of new skills for employment. The project will assist interested \ngroups, particularly women and youth, to source vocational training through the Equipping Youth \nfor Employment Project (footnote 15). To ensure sustainability and scale-up, the project will also \nfacilitate,  but  not  fund,  group  access  to  credit  by  linking  to  financial  services,  particularly \nmicrofinance institutions. This output will also provide training to poor households that are above \nthe lowest four deciles of the wealth ranking to adapt to CDR. The project will assist livelihood \ngroups to evaluate the benefit of being associated at township or township cluster level, to \nincrease their market power or add scale to their production.  \n \n14.

A DRD training unit will be established, along with associated \ntraining  curricula,  in  the  areas  of  community-based  planning,  resilience  building,  gender, \nleadership, and livelihood development, among others. This unit will train communities and \ngovernment departments, paying particular attention to the development of information and \ncommunication technology training programs. Knowledge centers to promote CDR in agriculture, \nlivestock, fishery, and rural development will also be supported. Support service providers will \nfacilitate implementation at communities\u2019 level. The upgrade of DRD training center will also be \nsupported under this output. \n \n15.  The project will include a disaster contingency feature. In the event of a disaster affecting \nan entire township, funds from the subsequent cycle of community subproject implementation \nmay be advanced for the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure and the recovery of livelihoods, \nbased on the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, and approval by \nADB. The selection of infrastructure and livelihood subprojects will follow similar participatory \nprocesses and criteria as for outputs 1 and 2. \n    \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $243.00 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).24 \nThe government has requested (i) a concessional loan in the amount of $185.00 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) a grant not exceeding $10.00 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The \ngovernment will finance the equivalent of $17.42 million for the salaries of counterpart staff, and \noffice space. The loan proceeds will mostly be used to provide block grants to communities to \nimplement infrastructure and livelihood subprojects. In addition, the Asia Investment Facility \n(\u20ac24.25 million  [$27.58  million  equivalent])  and  the  JFPR  ($3.00 million),  will  provide  grant \ncofinancing to be administered by ADB mainly to finance consultants, capacity building and block \ngrants. The summary financing plan is in Table 3. Climate adaptation is estimated to cost about \n$59.54 million. ADB will finance 100% of adaptation costs. Sector lending is proposed to provide \nflexibility and adequate project preparation.25  \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.    Base Costa   \n       1.

DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  Project preparation considered (i) the economic viability of different infrastructure and \nlivelihood investment options and their fit in terms of vulnerability and CDR reduction; (ii) ways to \ndiversify farm and nonfarm livelihood activities and increase productivity; (iii) ways to strengthen \nlinkages to markets; (iv) measures to minimize adverse environmental  and climate change \nimpacts;  and  (v) ways  to  integrate  project  activities  into  existing  and  planned  government \nsystems.  Due  diligence  was  conducted  for  a  wide  range  of  infrastructure  and  livelihood \nsubprojects.26 The project team also used the existing subprojects under the Enhancing Rural \nLivelihoods and Incomes Project as a reference in developing standard drawings (footnote 14).  \n \n19.  The project outputs were designed based on a robust understanding of the climate change \nand disaster risks of the township clusters. The site planning and design specifications for \ninfrastructure to be supported under output 1 were designed to reduce the potential impact of \nCDR on the said infrastructure and the wider community (e.g. embankments above flood levels, \ndrainage structures to provide safe passage, and public buildings built to provide safe refuge in \ndisaster situations). Further, output 2 comprises the dissemination of crop, livestock, and fisheries \ntechnologies, incorporating climate-resilient varieties and good husbandry practices. The uptake \nof new technologies will be strengthened through improved access to technical advice.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  The economic and financial analysis was undertaken at the subproject and overall project \nlevels. At the subproject level, the analysis covered four community infrastructure subprojects \nunder output 1: lowland and upland roads, water supply, and primary schools. Under output 2, \nthe project will either introduce new livelihood activities or expand their current scale. Thirteen \nlivelihood  activities  were  analyzed,  covering  crop  and  livestock  production,  and  primary \nprocessing. These subprojects were selected as they were the most commonly proposed by \nvillagers during consultations. For all subprojects, the economic internal rates of return exceed \nthe required 9% threshold and are robust against downside risks. At the overall project level, the \neconomic internal rate of return is estimated to be 17.8% (footnote 26).  \n \n21.  Financial and sustainability analysis was conducted to determine the financial viability of \nthe  subprojects.  For  the  community  infrastructure  subprojects,  the  annual  operation  and \nmaintenance costs are about 3.0% of the construction costs. The project will support training in \noperations and maintenance planning and execution in townships, village tracts, and villages. \nWhile most of these infrastructure subprojects do not generate direct revenue, they will stimulate \nmarket activities that will generate incremental financial resources for the beneficiaries to finance \nthe infrastructure\u2019s upkeep. For the livelihood subprojects, preliminary market assessments \nindicate sufficient demand for the produce.27 The analysis indicates that the livelihood subprojects \nwill significantly increase farm incomes, and that the returns to family labor are multiples of the \nprevailing daily wage rate. \n \nC.  Governance  \n22.  All procurement and recruitment of project-financed consultants will be in accordance with \nthe ADB Procurement Policy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \n                                                           \n26  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 During implementation, the proposed livelihood subprojects will be subjected to further market assessments before \napproval. \n ", "8   \namended from time to time). The overall procurement classification is moderate. The DRD has \nsubstantial experience in procuring goods and services under ADB projects, and international and \nnational  procurement  specialists  will  support  it  for  more  efficient  delivery.  The  financial \nmanagement risk is substantial given the limited capacity in financial reporting. The project will \nput in place accounting systems to ensure adequate financial records. Consolidated project \nfinancial  statements  prepared  by  DRD  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The project will disclose the implementation progress and bid notifications \nand their results on the DRD website, and establish a grievance redress mechanism. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM.  \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n23.  The project is classified targeted intervention\u2014geographic. It will increase the standard of \nliving  of  at  least  80%  of  target  communities  by  20%,  and  raise  the  resilience  of  project \ncommunities  above  the  baseline.28  This  will  be  achieved  by  institutionalizing  community \nparticipation, strengthening the availability and resilience of community infrastructure, improving \naccess to markets, raising household incomes through livelihood investments, and building skills \nand knowledge to address CDR. The project will promote inclusive economic growth, reduce \npoverty, provide rural employment opportunities, and improve market opportunities and access. \nCommunity infrastructure construction will provide  on-the-job skills training, and skilled and \nunskilled work opportunities for communities. Groups of poor households, particularly women-\nheaded households, will be enabled to improve their livelihoods through access to skills training \nand livelihood grants. \n \n24.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Twenty-three percent \nof rural households in the project area are women-headed. The project will support women by \nensuring their meaningful participation and building their capacity to invest sustainably in climate- \nand disaster-resilient infrastructure and livelihoods. A gender equity and social inclusion action \nplan  includes  measures  such  as  (i) empowerment  of  women  in  their  households  and \ncommunities;  (ii) separate  meetings  for  women  during  community  investment  prioritization; \n(iii) targets  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  committees,  meetings,  training,  and  construction; \n(iv) equal pay for women and men for equal work; and (v) training for all participating communities \nand implementing agencies in gender and development.29 The project will pilot test the household \nmethodologies approach to women\u2019s empowerment in their households in 3,000 households.30 \nKey gender targets include (i) at least 50% women\u2019s participation in village committees; (ii) at \nleast 40% of unskilled paid works for women in community infrastructure construction; (iii) at least \n40% of meeting participants are from poor, women-headed, and vulnerable households; and           \n(iv) fifty percent of women\u2019s infrastructure subproject priorities implemented. \n \n25.  Conflict-sensitive  approach.  The  project  adopts  a  conflict-sensitive  approach  that \npromotes  a  good  understanding  of  the  local  context,  builds  in  flexibility  in  design  and \nimplementation, and establishes strong local ownership. The project will ensure: (i) robust social \npreparation  and  awareness  raising  activities  that  reach  out  to  all  villagers,  especially  the \nvulnerable, women and ethnic groups and secure their participation; (ii) informed decision making \non community infrastructure and livelihood investments based on a good understanding of all \n                                                           \n28  Standard of living will be proxied by the asset index which is based on the valuation of household mobile and immobile \nassets and net income. \n29  Gender Equity and Social Inclusion Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n30  International Fund for Agricultural Development. 2018.

Safeguards \n \n26.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.31 \n \n27.  Environment (category B). The project is expected to achieve significant socioeconomic \nbenefits  through  the  provision  of  climate-resilient  basic  infrastructure  and  livelihood \nimprovements. The small-scale community infrastructure subprojects are anticipated to have \nminimal or minor adverse environmental impacts. These impacts will be limited to the construction \nperiod, will be localized and reversible, and can be mitigated through good construction practices \nand standard mitigation measures. An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) \nprepared  for  the  project  identifies  subproject  eligibility  criteria;  defines  procedures  and \nresponsibilities for environmental screening and assessment of subprojects, grievance redress \nmechanism, and meaningful public consultation; and specifies the supervision, monitoring, and \nreporting requirements.32 The EARF also includes Environmental Codes of Practice and a generic \nenvironmental management plan to mitigate the anticipated environmental impacts. The DRD will \nhave the main responsibility for EARF implementation and will assign qualified staff in the Project \nManagement Unit, which will be supported by international and national environmental safeguard \nconsultants. The DRD will submit semiannual environmental safeguard reports to ADB for \ndisclosure.   \n \n28.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A community participation framework (CPF) has \nbeen developed. Subproject screening and selection criteria will identify and reject any subproject \nrequiring involuntary resettlement and compulsory acquisition.33 Investments in village roads and \nwater supply schemes may require minor land use reallocation. In these cases, the project will \npursue voluntary donation. The CPF includes a due diligence procedure to verify voluntary \ndonation bona fides through a third party, and this will be used to screen and select subprojects \nduring implementation.34 The CPF will be used to conduct social safeguards assessments of all \nsubprojects.  \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Ethnic groups live in most project townships.35 In \nsome areas, ethnic groups reside within or outside ancestral domains. The project is assessed \ncategory B  and  an  ethnic  group  development  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the \nscreening of each subproject for possible ethnic group impacts and to ensure inclusiveness, \nconsultation, and participation as needed. Subprojects with negative impacts on ethnic groups \nwill not be funded.36  \n \n30.  Grievance redress mechanism. Within 6 months of project effectiveness, a safeguards \ngrievance redress mechanism acceptable to ADB will be established by the government in \naccordance with the EARF, the ethnic group development framework, and the CPF. Adequate \nresources  will  be  allocated  to  the  screening,  preparation,  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nreporting of social and environmental safeguards; and associated capacity development.  \n                                                           \n31  ADB.
