The  proposed  project \nintends  to  establish  a  credit  facility  of  $50  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  at  Bangladesh \nBank (central bank) for relending to participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) for the purpose \nof constructing more energy-efficient and environmentally superior brick kilns. The credit facility \nhas  two  components:  (i)  to  upgrade  existing  polluting  brick  kilns  to  a  transitional  design  to \npreserve  sector  welfare  while  immediately  reducing  pollution,  and  (ii)  to  promote  the  most \nadvanced  brick  kiln  pilots  to  demonstrate  their  operational  and  commercial  viabilities  in \nBangladesh.  The  combined  efforts  will  help  build  more  energy-efficient  brick  manufacturing \ncapacities in Bangladesh to transform the sector to a modern and efficient industry. 1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nPromoting  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  is  a  part  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  National \nStrategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction  II  2009\u20132011.  From  1990  to  2011,  Bangladesh\u2019s \nreal  gross  domestic  product  grew  consistently  at  around  5%  per  annum. 2 During  the  same \nperiod,  the  population  grew  from  109  million  to  159  million.  As  a  result,  the  country\u2019s  primary \nenergy  consumption  rose  from  0.25  quad  (1015  British  thermal  units)  in  1990  to  0.87  quad  in \n2008. 3 With  increased  consumption  of  carbon-based  fuels,  the  country\u2019s  carbon  dioxide  (CO2) \nemissions  per  capita  doubled  from  40  tons  in  1990  to  80  tons  in  2008. 4 High  energy  intensity \nfrom growing inefficient industrial operations is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions \nand fine particulate pollution in Bangladesh. Brickfields are among the largest industrial polluters. \n \nBrick-making  contributes  to  about  1%  of gross  domestic  product. 5 However,  due  to the \n4. \nlack  of  relevant  policy  and  legislations,  the  brick  sector  is  poorly  regulated.  Instead  of  a  small \nnumber  of  highly  efficient  modern  brickfields,  a  large  number  of  unqualified  small  businesses \noperate  on  the  back  of  outmoded  technologies,  severe  industrial  pollution,  and  poor  labor \nstandards.  With  the  current  rate  of  economic  growth,  the  brick  sector  continues  to  expand  at \nabout 8% per annum, 6 and burn about 6.0 million tons of coal and emit about 9.8 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide (CO2). 7 In the capital city of Dhaka, the brick sector contributed most to the fine \nparticulate pollution during the operating season (from November to April). There are additional \nland-use  change  emissions  from  (i)  deforestation  by  burning  firewood  (as  a  cheaper \nreplacement  to  coal),  (ii)  loss  of farmlands  and  other  natural  habitats  (to construct  brick kilns), \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2011.

From (i) to (vi), bull\u2019s trench kiln is the least energy-efficient and most \npolluting,  and  tunnel  kiln  is  the  most  energy-efficient  and  the  least  polluting.  In  addition,  there \nare  modified  (or  improved)  zigzag  kiln 8 and  hybrid  Hoffman  kiln  (HHK),  which  are  based  on \ntraditional  designs  but  are  more  energy-efficient.  FCKs  can  be  upgraded  to  improved  zigzag \nkilns  because  of  the  similar  technical  designs.  Currently,  92%  of  the  4,880  brickfields  in \nBangladesh  are  using  the  highly  polluting  FCK  design.  Improved  zigzag  kilns,  VSBKs,  HHKs, \nand tunnel kilns  are rare  because  of the general  lack  of  awareness  of these technologies  and \nthe inadequate market funding support. \n\n6. \nTo  improve  environmental  conditions,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  (MOEF) \nissued a directive on 15 July 2010, requiring that (i) no annual FCK licenses be renewed after \nSeptember 2012; (ii) environmental clearance favor more energy-efficient improved zigzag kilns, \nVSBKs and HHKs; and (iii) all FCKs cease to exist from September 2013. 9 \n \n7. \nThe project is designed as a financial intermediary loan to complement the Government \nof Bangladesh directive (para. 6) by catalyzing domestic capital and providing targeted finance \nto  build  energy-efficient  brick  kiln  replacement  capacity,  thereby  enabling  the  eventual  phase-\nout of FCKs. The proposed credit facility will establish two revolving funds of (i) up to 25 years of \n$30  million  equivalent  local  currency  from  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for upgrading FCKs to improved zigzag kilns and (ii) up to 32 years of \n$20 million equivalent local currency from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for constructing more \nadvanced VSBKs, HHKs, and tunnel kilns. 10 \n \n8. \nADB\u2019s  support  is  catalytic.  It  will  support  the  government\u2019s  effort  to  adjust  to  more \nenvironmentally friendly production techniques and, through the dissemination of commercially \nviable  technologies  and  close  monitoring  of  safeguard  policies,  ensure  a  smooth  and  orderly \ntransformation  of  the  brick  sector.  ADB  has  undertaken  extensive  stakeholder  consultation \nincluding  relevant  government  agencies,  brick  manufacturing  association  members,  brickfield \nworkers (including female workers), and potential investors in the course of project preparation \nto ensure design viability. \n \n9. \nThe  project  will  be  supported  by  a  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA) \n(under  processing) 11 that  addresses  the  brick  sector  development  constraints  in  policy  and \nregulatory formulation, technology awareness-raising, technical and business support, research \nand development, and emerging alternative livelihood needs. The TA is designed to coordinate \nwith development partners and complement the lending assistance to effectively support a more \ncomprehensive and environmentally sustainable brick sector development program. \n  \n                                                \n8  The  existing  zigzag  kiln  is  not  standardized  and  energy  efficiency  improvement  is  uneven.  The  World  Bank  is \n\ndeveloping improved zigzag kiln technical standard with energy efficiency improvement greater than 30%. \n\n9  Government Directive to Phase Out Fixed Chimney Kilns (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n10 Because  the  improved  zigzag  kiln  is  only  a  transitional  and  intermediary  technology,  at  a  future  point  when  the \ngovernment phases out support for such a technology, the project steering committee will determine how to utilize \nthe revolving credit facility to exclusively support other more efficient brick kilns. \n\n11 The ADB Clean Energy Working Group has provided in-principle approval of the $750,000 funding allocation (draft \nCapacity  Development  Technical  Assistance  Concept  Paper  is  accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). \n\n2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nThe  demand  for  ADB  funds  is  strong.  Due  to  the  government\u2019s  strong  commitment  to \n10. \nuphold  its  directive  to  phase  out  FCKs  (para.  6),  Bangladesh  Brick  Manufacturing  Owners \nAssociation  (BBMOA)  members  are  compelled  to  upgrade  their  FCKs  to  improved  zigzag \nkilns. 12 Although  there  is  a  general  lack  of  awareness  of  more  advanced  VSBK,  HHK,  and \ntunnel  kiln  technologies  in  Bangladesh,  the  local  market  for  energy-efficient  brick  kilns  is \ndeveloping, as evidenced by the increasing number of HHK pipeline projects. The TA will also \nprovide technical workshops and media campaigns to disseminate the successful pilot projects\u2019 \ntechnical and commercial viabilities and create continuous demand for ADB funds. 13 \n \n11. \nThe  project  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy for  Bangladesh,  2011\u20132015 \nby supporting the environmentally sustainable development. 14 The country partnership strategy \nis programmed to support more inclusive and greener economic growth by deepening financial \nmarkets  and  boosting  energy  efficiency,  with  a  significant  emphasis  on  climate  change \nmitigation and adaptation. The project also aligns with ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan \nby  competitively  mobilizing  domestic  finance  for  the  target  sector  development. 15 The  project \nsupports  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  which  is  one  of  the  three  strategic  agendas  of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020. 16 As a financial intermediary loan, the project also supports private sector \ndevelopment  by  providing  sustainable  growth  potential  for  brick  manufacturers  and,  hence, \ndevelopment of small and medium-sized enterprises. \n \nThe project design has been closely coordinated with the related brick sector initiatives. \n12. \nThe  project  complements  the  industrial  energy  efficiency  finance  program  of  ADB\u2019s  Private \nSector Operations Department. 17 The joint ADB direct funding support harmonizes with the TA \nprojects  and  carbon  finance  scheme  from  the  World  Bank  and  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme and other initiatives from Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit \n(GIZ International Services).  \n  \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe impact will be improved environmental conditions in Bangladesh. The outcome will \nbe  the  replacement  of  polluting  FCKs  with  more  energy-efficient  kilns  in  Bangladesh\u2019s  brick \nsector. \n \nC. \n\nOutput \n\n14. \n\nThe  outputs  are  (i)  a  designated  credit  facility,  by  catalyzing  domestic  resources,  to \n\n                                                \n12 BBMOA represents a majority of FCK owners.

In terms of coal consumption per million bricks produced, VSBKs, \nHHKs, and tunnel kilns are the most energy-efficient, using about 100\u2013130 tons of coal. This is \nmore  efficient  than  for  FCKs  (240  tons)  and  improved  zigzag  kilns  (180\u2013200  tons).  For  fine \nparticulate  pollution  per  100,000  bricks  produced,  HHKs  and  tunnel  kilns  (less  than  50 \nmilligrams  per  cubic  meter  [mg/m3])  are  better  than  VSBKs  (78\u2013187  mg/m3),  and  significantly \nbetter than improved zigzag kilns (more than 500 mg/m3) and FCKs (more than 1,000 mg/m3). \nCO2 emissions for manufacturing 1 million bricks from VSBKs and tunnel kilns (291 tons of CO2 \n[tCO2])  are  lower  than  from  HHKs  (315  tCO2),  which  is  lower  than  from  improved  zigzag  kilns \n(440  tCO2)  and  FCKs  (582  tCO2).  HHKs  and  tunnel  kilns  produce  the  best-quality  bricks, \nmeasured by the level of pressure resistance of more than 4,500 pounds per square inch (psi) \n(up to 6,000 psi); improved zigzag kilns and VSBKs cannot produce bricks of similar quality.  \n \n23. \nIn summary, tunnel kiln is the best available technology for producing the highest quality \nbricks  with  the  lowest  environmental  impact.  HHK  is  the  second  best  option.  VSBK  is \nenvironmentally friendly but has a lower commercial viability because of the lower brick quality \nand the smaller production volume. Improved zigzag kiln is more energy-efficient than FCK, but \ninferior in all technical aspects compared to VSBK, HHK, and tunnel kiln. 22 \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nThe project\u2019s economic benefits include the positive externalities produced by the more \nenergy-efficient  brick  kilns  from  (i)  coal  cost  savings,  (ii)  quantified  health  benefits  from \nimproved  environmental  condition,  (iii)  clay  cost  savings  from  moving  towards  perforated  and \nhollow bricks, (iv) income generated from returning phased-out FCK sites to agricultural use, (v) \nimproved  revenue,  and  (vi)  potential  carbon  credit.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is \ncalculated  at  38.5%  without  factoring  in  the  potential  carbon  credit  benefits.  By  factoring  the \ncarbon  credit  benefits,  the  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  85.3%. 23  Sensitivity \nanalysis  for  10%  increase  in  capital  cost  and  10% reduction  in  incremental  benefits  would  still \nresult to acceptable project economic internal rate of return and economic net present value.  \n \n25. \nThe financial analysis indicates favorable financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) on an \naverage-sized improved zigzag kiln, VSBK, HHK, and tunnel kiln over a project life cycle of 10 \nyears.  The  calculation  is  based  on  70:30  debt\u2013equity  ratio.  The  cost  of  debt  is  11%  per  year \n(pro rata  ADB\u2019s funding cost  of  9%  per  annum  and  market  relending  cost  of  16%  per  annum) \nand cost of equity is estimated at 15%. The project FIRR for an average improved zigzag kiln is \n34.0%, for a VSBK it is 33.6%, for an HHK it is 37.5%, and for a tunnel kiln it is 35.1%. 24 The \npayback periods are 3.7 years for an average improved zigzag kiln, 6.1 years for a VSBK, 5.6 \nyears for an HHK, and 5.4 years for a tunnel kiln. Although the upgrade to an improved zigzag \nkiln  has  a  high  investment return,  ADB OCR fund  is restricted to existing  FCK  owners  and  no \nconstruction  of  greenfield  improved  zigzag  kilns  will  be  financed.  All  project  FIRRs  compare \nfavorably to the weighted average cost of capital of 12.2%. \n \n\n                                                \n22 The  design  standards  of  FCKs  will  be  developed  by  the  World  Bank,  and  work  is  ongoing.  Verification  of  the \ntechnology design standard, including VSBK, HHK, and tunnel kiln, will be provided by DOE, through the support \nfrom proposed capacity development TA, to meet the international best practices. \n\n23 Financial and Economic Analyses (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 The  project  FIRR  does  not  factor  in  the  financing  cost  and  is  higher  than  the  equity  FIRR  that  factors  in  the \n\nfinancing cost. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n26. \nPFIs shall submit quarterly reports to Bangladesh Bank ACFID on ADB\u2019s fund utilization, \nincluding detailed subloan information: types of technology funded (with certification from DOE), \nsubloan  amounts,  tenors,  interest  rates,  repayment  terms,  amortization  schedules,  repayment \nrecords,  and  compliance  records  (e.g.,  with  PFI  participation  agreement  and  ADB  eligibility \ncriteria).  In  turn,  ACFID  will  amalgamate  the  collected  information  and  provide  ADB  with  a \nquarterly  report  on  the  overall  performance  of  the  credit  facility.  Bangladesh  Bank  will  ensure \nthat  all  PFIs  comply  with  the  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations  and  will  apply  the  ADB \nprohibited  investment  activities  list  to  all  subprojects  that  are  financed  by  ADB.  The  ADB \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) has been explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and Bangladesh Bank, and will be explained to PFIs to ensure compliance at sub-\nborrower level. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM (footnote 20). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n27. \nAbout  750,000  people  work  in  the  brick  sector  in  Bangladesh.  On  average,  about  150 \nworkers  are  employed  at  each  FCK,  about  10%\u201320%  of  whom  are  women  and  sometimes \nillegal  child  laborers. The  work  is  seasonal,  occurring  during  the  6  months  of  dry  season from \nNovember  to  April.  Working  conditions  are  harsh.  Because  of  the  low  level  of  mechanical \nautomation,  workers  endure  a  high  level  of  manual  labor  and  occupational  hazards.  Workers\u2019 \nliving  conditions  are  also  poor.  Living  near  the  polluting  kilns  aggravates  already  worsening \npersonal health. \n \n28. \nUnder the participation agreements with Bangladesh Bank, all PFIs will undertake not to \nfinance any brickfield that violates the core labor standards. A gender action plan will safeguard \nthe well-being of female workers in ADB-funded brickfields. 25 The capital investments required \nto  fund  energy-efficient  brick  kilns  will  also  improve  their  mechanical  automations  and  reduce \noccupational hazards. The increased skill sets to operate more advanced HHKs and tunnel kilns \ncould lead to improved labor productivity and higher wage.  \n \nThe phase-out of FCKs will however result in the loss of livelihood for some FCK owners \n29. \nand  workers.  To  minimize  such  a  negative  social  impact,  the  project  supports  the  upgrade  of \nFCKs  to  an  intermediate  technology  of  improved  zigzag  kilns  as  a  transitional  measure  to \nmodernize  the  brick  sector  in  Bangladesh.  The  proposed  capacity  development  TA  will  help \nfinance the retraining of the affected businesspersons and workers to improve their chances of \nsecuring alternative livelihoods (footnote 11). \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nAccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified  as  FI \n(financial  intermediary)  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. \nSafeguards-related eligibility criteria will eliminate any subproject that is classified as category A \nfor  environment  or  that  involves  resettlement  or  affects  indigenous  peoples. 26 Furthermore, \nsubprojects cannot involve in any activity on the prohibited investment activities list indicated in \nthe  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  An  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS) \n                                                \n25 See gender action plan in PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 A safeguard categorization practice will be established at the Bangladesh Bank and PFI level in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Any lack of capacity will be supplemented initially by ongoing TA (footnote 13) \nand subsequently the proposed capacity development TA when it is approved. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\narrangement  consistent  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  was  developed  to  guide  the \nproject implementation. 27 PFIs will monitor sub-borrowers\u2019 compliances to the developed ESMS \nand  submit  annual  environmental  and  social  performance  reports  to  Bangladesh  Bank,  which \nwill submit a compiled report to ADB. \n \n31. \nAn assessment of the capacities of Bangladesh Bank and a potential PFI to manage the \nenvironmental and social issues was conducted as a part of the project due diligence. The result \nshows  that  potential  PFIs  may  have  to  strengthen  their  capacities  to  monitor  sub-borrowers\u2019 \ncompliance  to  the  ADB  ESMS  requirements.  The  proposed  capacity  development  TA  will \nsupport  Bangladesh  Bank  and  PFIs  to  manage  and  implement  the  developed  ESMS \narrangement.  \n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n32. \nThe project design is based on strong government commitment to enforce the phase-out \nof  the  polluting  FCKs.  The  technical  design  specification  for  improved  zigzag  kiln  is  being \nfinalized. ADB plans to provide capacity building to Bangladesh Bank and PFIs to monitor and \nmanage  sub-borrowers\u2019  compliance  with  required  ESMS,  core  labor  standards,  gender  action \nplan, and procurement practices acceptable to ADB. This will also ease ADB\u2019s reputational risk \nworking  in  the  brick  sector  that  has  to  improve  its  compliance  record  on  basic  safeguard \nstandards. More detailed risk and mitigating measures are provided in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan. 28   \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nGovernment\u2019s inability to uphold its directive to \nphase out the existing fixed chimney kilns (FCKs). \n \n\nLack of standard design specifications in improved \nzigzag kiln, VSBK, HHK, and tunnel kiln in \nBangladesh. \n\nLack of participating financial intermediaries (PFIs)\u2019 \ncompliance with required environmental and social \nmanagement system, core labor standards, gender \naction plan, and procurement practices acceptable \nto ADB, raising potential ADB reputational risk. \n\nMitigating Measures \nADB has obtained strong government commitment \nto maintain its policy direction. The government has \ncommitted not to repeal, suspend or substantially \namend the relevant government directive (para. 6) \nwithout ADB approval. \nThe World Bank is developing the technical \n(design) standard for improved zigzag kiln. A \nsubproject for upgrading to improved zigzag kiln is \neligible for financing only after DOE has approved \nand published such general design standard and \ncertified that the proposed subproject meets the \npublished design standard. If DOE is unable to \napprove and publish general design standards for \nVSBK, HHK, or tunnel kiln, these types of \nsubprojects are eligible for financing only after DOE \nhas certified that the subproject design meets \ninternational best practices. \nAll PFIs must sign a participation agreement with \nBangladesh Bank to meet the stated compliance \nrequirements. Through the proposed capacity \ndevelopment TA, ADB will support Bangladesh \nBank\u2019s regular monitoring of compliance conditions \nat PFIs and sub-borrowers. In addition, PFIs\u2019 \ncompliance systems will need to be in place, and \n\n                                                \n27 Financial  Intermediary:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n28  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nsatisfactory to ADB, before first disbursement. \nFurthermore, ADB will design commercial \nincentives, such as carbon credit, to reward sub-\nborrowers who demonstrated satisfactory \ncompliance records. Finally, the project is designed \nto finance creditworthy, larger, model brickfields \nthat could demonstrate exemplary compliances in \nenvironmental, social, labor, and gender standards, \nthereby minimizing ADB\u2019s reputational risk.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n34. \nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \nset  forth  in  the  loan  agreements  and  project  agreement.
