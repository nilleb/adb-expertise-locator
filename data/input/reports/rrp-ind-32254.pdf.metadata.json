An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  address  citywide  deficiencies  in  basic  urban \nservices for six of the largest urban centers in Madhya Pradesh. \nDirect social benefits will be sustained improvements in water \nsupply,  sanitation,  garbage  collection,  and  disposal within the \nproject cities. Indirect benefits will accrue through improved living \nconditions,  healthier  living  environments,  and  the  prospect  of \nimproved health status of the population.  The Project will also \nassist the participating cities in undertaking participatory planning \nexercises  that  meet  the  needs  of  the  urban  poor.  Based on \nsuccessful experience in other states in India, two community-\nlevel funds will be provided to support the integrated upgrading of \npoor settlements for improved water supply, sanitation, drains, \nand social services. \n   \nRationale  Madhya Pradesh is the third poorest state in India (after Orissa \nand  Bihar).  Its  urban  population  below  the  poverty  line  was \nestimated as 38% in 2000, much higher than the national average \nof 24%. The baseline socioeconomic survey has shown that there \nare widespread deficiencies in basic urban services across the six \nproject cities. On average, 42.3% of households do not have in-\nhouse water supplies and 15.1% do not have access to piped \nwater; over 40% of households receive water only on alternate \ndays;  18.8%  of  households  do  not  have  a  private  toilet  and \nmembers of one in eight households defecate outdoors; 32% \nreport  flooding  problems;  and  40%  report  no  solid  waste \ncollection. As a result the potential for waterborne and bacterial \ndiseases is high, particularly among children.  Poor infrastructure \nand  inadequate  urban  services  also  hamper  the  economic \npotential of the project cities as major local service centers for \ntrading and commercial activities for their districts. The business \ncommunity indicated that improvements in basic urban services, \nsuch as water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management, \nare prerequisite for any improvement in business performance \nand the prospect for future economic growth. \n \nObjectives  The Project comprises three parts.  Part A\u2014urban water supply \nand  environmental  improvement\u2014covers the improvement and \nexpansion of the following municipal infrastructure and services: \n(i) urban water supply, (ii) sewerage and sanitation, (iii) storm \nwater drainage, and (iv) solid waste management.  Part B\u2014public \nparticipation and awareness  program\u2014is  designed to strengthen ", "iv   \n  the capacities of the project cities to plan and manage urban \ndevelopment in a more effective, transparent, and sustainable \nmanner. Part B consists of (i) two community-level funds that will \nbe  the  basis  for  participatory  planning  between  the  municipal \nauthorities  and  the  poor  communities  of  the  neighborhood  to \nintegrate slum improvements with citywide infrastructure; and (ii) \nWater for Asian Cities Program in India covering urban water \nconservation and demand management to be financed through \nparallel  cofinancing  by  UN-HABITAT.    Part  C\u2014project \nimplementation assistance\u2014will consist of support to the state \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  and  the  city  project \nimplementation units (PIUs) with activities immediately related to \nthe implementation of the Project. \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost (including parallel grant cofinancing by \nUN-HABITAT)  is  $303.5  million equivalent, comprising foreign \nexchange of $72.9 million (24.0%) and local currency of $230.6 \nmillion equivalent (76.0%). \n   \n  ($ million) \nFinancing Plan  Source  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development \n  55.0  145.0  200.0  65.9 \nBank \n  UN-HABITAT  0.5  0.0  0.5  0.1 \n  Government of \n17.4  33.2  50.6  16.7 \nMadhya Pradesha \n  Project Cities  0.0  52.4  52.4  17.3 \n  Total  72.9  230.6  303.5  100.0 \n  UN-HABITAT = United Nations Human Settlements Programme \n  a Including taxes and duties, front-end fees, interests during construction, and \ncommitment charges. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $200.0  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank's \n(ADB) ordinary capital resources will be provided. The loan will \nhave a term of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a 0.5% front-end fee \nand such other terms  and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nand  Project  Agreements.  UN-HABITAT  will  administer  their \nrespective contributions as parallel cofinancing to the project cost. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  In accordance with the prevailing practice for externally financed \nTerms  projects in India, the Government will relend 70% of the ADB loan \nproceeds  in  rupees  equivalent  at  10.5%  per  annum  with \nrepayments over 25 years including a grace period of 5 years. \nThe remaining 30% will be provided as a grant to the government  \nof  Madhya Pradesh which will onlend the total proceeds from the \nGovernment,  on  the  same  terms,  to  the  six  project  city \ncorporations. \n   \n ", "    v \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Urban Administration and Development Department (UADD) \nof the government of Madhya Pradesh. \n   \nImplementation  UADD will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The PMU, to \nArrangements  be set up within UADD at the state-level and led by a full-time \nproject director, will coordinate and manage all activities for the \nProject. A state-level Empowered Committee with full powers to \ndecide  on  all  matters  relating  to  the  Project  will  also  be \nestablished. In each of the six project cities, a PIU will be set up to \ncarry out daily implementation activities. A city steering committee \nwill be set up to provide overall monitoring and guidance to the \nrespective PIUs. \n   \nProcurement  Goods, works, and services financed by ADB will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  The PIUs \nwill generally carry out procurement under the guidance of the \nPMU, except for equipment and vehicles common to all cities, \nwhich  will  be  directly  procured  by  the  PMU.  To  the  extent \npossible,  goods  will  be  grouped  into  packages  larger  than \n$500,000 to be suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB) \nprocedures. Miscellaneous goods for immediate use that cannot \nbe grouped under a larger contract and that cost  $500,000 or less \nper contract will be procured through international shopping or \nlocal competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. Equipment, materials, \nor civil works costing $100,000 or less will be procured following \nthe state\u2019s applicable procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \nGiven the project areas\u2019 remoteness and the nature of works, civil \nworks contracts that are relatively small in value ($5 million or less \nper contract) would not be attractive to international bidders, and \ntherefore, will use LCB procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nConsulting Services  All  consulting  services  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. Overall, 3,882 person-months of consulting services \n(102 international and 3,780 domestic) will be required. A team of \ninternational and domestic project management consultants will \nbe engaged for the project management consultancy (PMC) to \nhelp implement, manage, and monitor overall project activities. A \ntotal of 372 person-months of PMC consulting services will be \nrequired  (102  international  and  270  domestic).  Two  teams  of \ndomestic design and supervision consultants will be engaged for \nthe  design  and  supervision  consultancy  (DSC)  to  assist  the \nproject city PIUs in daily implementation activities. A total of 1,624 \nperson-months of DSC consulting services will be required for the \n ", "vi   \n  east  region,  and  1,721  person-months  for  the  west  region.  A \ndomestic  firm  can  be  selected  for  one  of  the  two  DSCs.  In \naddition,  a  total  of  120  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices will be provided for a public relations and awareness \nprogram and 45 person-months of domestic consulting services \nfor benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) of the Project in all \nthe project cities.    \n   \nProject Benefits and  The baseline socioeconomic survey under the project preparatory \nBeneficiaries  technical assistance (TA) identified lack of access to a reliable in-\nhouse water supply as the foremost deficiency.  Although the \ncoverage  of  the  existing  water  distribution  network  in  the  six \nproject cities is as high as 85%, water pressure, and frequency \nand duration of supply are extremely low.  Therefore the benefits \nof improved efficiency of the water supply system will accrue to all \npresent users. In addition, almost one million new consumers will \ngain  access  to  piped  water  supply  by  2010.  While  the  poor \nhouseholds (estimated to be 25% of the total urban population) \noutside  slum  settlements  will  be  fully  integrated  into  the  new \nexpanded  water  supply  system,  an  indirect  benefit  to  slum \nsettlements is improved supply at the slum boundaries. For the \nslum  dwellers  to  directly  benefit  from  the  Project,  additional \ninvestments  are  required  to  improve  tertiary  distribution  within \nslum settlements. For instance, the water schemes under the \nArea Improvement Fund (AIF) will benefit up to 100,000 slum \ndwellers, or about 7% of the total slum population. From the \nsanitation  component,  direct  benefits  will  be  obtained  by \nhouseholds that will be able to connect to the sewerage network. \nThe network will be in the densely built-up and developing areas \nof the city center. The percentage of the poor households in this \narea  is  slightly  below  the  citywide  average  of  25%.  An \nunderground  sewerage  network  will  however,  reach  the \nboundaries of slum areas within the scheme areas and will permit \nthe provision of sewered community latrines that will benefit an \nestimated  4%  of  poor  households.  The solid waste  component \nwill operate citywide with little difference in the standard of service \nwithin cities. The proportion of the poor beneficiaries is therefore \nthe same for each city as a whole. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The potential risks concern (i) sustainability of the facilities and \nservices provided under the project; (ii) lack of suitably qualified \npersonnel  in   the   PIUs,  which  may   eventually  lead  to   weak \nimplementation of individual investment components in each city; \n(iii)  implementation  delays  due  to  slow  progress  with  start-up \nactivities  (recruiting  consultants  and  setting  up  the  project \nmanagement  structure);  (iv)  timely  availability  of  counterpart \nfunding from the participating municipalities; and (v) inappropriate \nmanagement  and  accounting  system  of  the  Water  Works \nDepartment. To mitigate most of these risks, sufficient measures \nhave been incorporated in the Project in the form of the financial \n ", "    vii  \n  improvement  action  plan,  sufficient  amounts  allotted  in  each \nmunicipal budget to cover the municipal corporation\u2019s share of the \nannual project investment requirement, and a plan to improve \nwater supply management. \n   \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement in Madhya Pradesh \nProject. The project framework (Appendix 1), summarizes the objectives, scope, and approach \nof the Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  The previous operational strategy for India, launched in 1996, introduced state-level \noperations in a few reform-minded states to fully exploit complementarities and synergies \nbetween interventions and maximize the development impact in those states. Typically, the \nAsian Development Bank's (ADB) state-level operations have consisted of a public resource \nmanagement program to support fiscal consolidation with programs of sectoral reforms and \ninvestment in infrastructure sectors like power, transportation, and urban social infrastructure. \nMadhya Pradesh was the second focal state1 selected for such state-level assistance, with a \nloan for the Public Resource Management Program approved in December 1999 and followed \nby  Power  Sector  Development  Program  in  December  2000  and  State  Roads  Sector \nDevelopment Program in December 2002. Recognizing the deteriorating quality of municipal \nservices and environmental degradation in urban centers, the government of the state of \nMadhya Pradesh requested ADB to provide financial assistance to six of the largest cities of the \nstate.  \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n1.  The Urban Sector in Madhya Pradesh \n \n3.  Madhya Pradesh geographically is the heartland of India; its very name means central \nstate. It is largely a rural state with more than 70% of its 60 million population in villages and \nworking in agriculture or agriculture-related activities (Census 2001).  There are 26 towns with a \npopulation over 100,000 including the capital city, Bhopal. The total urban population is currently \n16.1 million or 27% of the total population. During the last 10 years (1991-2001), population \ngrowth in the urban areas was slightly higher at 2.8% per year compared with the overall \npopulation growth of 2.2%. Even at a modest growth rate of 2% per year, the urban population \nis expected to reach 25 million by the end of the design period of the Project, 2021.  \n  \n4.  The bifurcation of the state into Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh in November 2000 \nmeant a considerable downsizing of Madhya Pradesh in demography and economic activity as \nwell as geography. Estimates indicate that 31% of the geographic area, 26% of the population, \n30% of mineral-rich land area, and 148 large and medium-scale enterprises were \"lost\" to \nChhattisgarh with the split. Much of the urban areas, however, remained and the role of the \nurban sector in the economy has increased with reduced dependence on natural resources.  \n \n5.  Madhya Pradesh is the third poorest state in India (after Orissa and Bihar) in terms of \nthe percentage of people below the poverty line. The estimated urban population below the \npoverty line was 38.4% in 2000, much higher than the national average of 23.6%.  Urban \npoverty, however, increased faster than rural poverty between 19942 and 2000 and, as a result, \nthe incidence of poverty is now more or less the same between urban areas and rural villages. \nAmong the urban poor, the slum population, counted for the first time during the 2001 Census, \n                                                 \n1   ADB\u2019s focal states include Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, and northeastern states.  \n2  The incidence of poverty was 48.4% in urban areas and 40.6% in rural villages in 1994. ", "2  \nrepresented about 24.3% of the urban population, which is slightly higher than the national \naverage of 22.6%. Other than these primary data published by the Central Government, there is \nvery little state-level data that can support an analysis of vulnerability among the urban poor. \nAlmost no secondary data exist to permit an analysis of other dimensions of urban poverty, \nparticularly  health,  social  capital,  and  gender  disparity.  To  fill  such  data  gap,  a  baseline \nsocioeconomic  survey  covering  9,600  households,  was  undertaken  during  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).  The  survey  was  complemented  by  a  series  of \nparticipatory exercises including participatory rapid appraisal, focus group discussions, and \nmunicipal workshops. \n \n2.  Project Cities: Performance and Challenges \n \n    a.  Socioeconomic Context \n \n6.  The project cities represent six of the largest municipal corporations in Madhya Pradesh. \nBhopal and Indore have a population of around 1.5 million each. Gwalior and Jabalpur have \nbetween 800,000 and 1 million, and the remaining two cities, Ratlam and Ujjain have less than \n500,000 each. The total population of the six cities is 5.46 million (2001 Census), representing \nabout a third of the state\u2019s urban population. Using a modest annual growth rate of 2.5% (for \n2006-2011) and 2.25% (for 2011-2021), which are slightly lower than all-India projections, the \ntotal population for the six project cities is estimated to be 6.9 million in 2010 and 9.1 million in \n2021.  \n \n7.    Each  city  has  a  very  different  historical  origin,  role,  and  function  within  the  state \n(Appendix 2). The economic base and level of development are equally diverse, as are their \nprospects for future growth and expansion. Indore and Bhopal are thriving\u2014Indore because of \nits position as the largest city in the state, and its trading and industrial base; and Bhopal \nbecause of its education and position as state capital and trading and commercial center. The \nother cities are much smaller and would not be expected to have the dynamism and diversity of \nthe larger cities. All cities, however, suffered in recent years from the closure or downsizing of \nthe textile and other traditional industries. Many of the changes were a result of changes a shift \nin the fortunes of the sector, rather than location difficulties in Madhya Pradesh. \n \n8.  While  industrial  estates  in  the  urban  areas  suffer  from  poor  quality  infrastructure, \ninadequate planning, and diminishing financial resources, all the project cities have potential in \nthe services sector, as all are the major local service center for trading and commercial activity \nfor their districts. Tourism represents another bright prospect in some project cities, as well as \nfor the state as a whole. The business community, however, pointed out the factors that they \nconsider as prerequisite for any improvement in business performance and prospects for future \neconomic growth. Access to finance was almost universally the most important factor. However, \ninfrastructure facilities, including power, urban transport, water supply, sanitation and solid \nwaste management, were also high on the list. While power lies outside the scope of the \nProject, most businesses considered that improvements in basic urban services were absolutely \nnecessary and that there would be direct and indirect positive outcomes from improvements in \nproviding the service.  \n \n    b.  Urban Environmental Infrastructure and Services \n \n9.  In most of the project cities, water supply does not meet basic human requirements, \nbeing provided only a few hours a day in the wet season and less than an hour every other day \nin the dry season.  Nonrevenue water is more than 50% in all the project cities and, without an \nurgent intervention it will continue to get worse, exacerbating water shortages and increasing \n ", "    3 \nthe cost of supply.  In three project cities, the average water supplied will be less than 40 liters \nper capita per day (lpcd) by 2010, which is well below the minimum standard (70 lpcd) set by \nthe Government of India.  By 2021, the average water supplied in all project cities except \nBhopal, will be less than 50 lpcd, and less than 25 lpcd in Indore, Jabalpur, and Ratlam.  \n \n10.  Sanitation is also grossly inadequate in all project cities, with resulting unhygienic living \nconditions and public health problems. Only 10% of households reported satisfaction with \nwastewater  management  in  the  city.    In  Bhopal,  Gwalior,  and  Indore,  the  existing  small \nreticulated sewerage systems cover less than 10% of the population.  Except in Bhopal, these \nsystems do not function properly. Estimates of the proportion of households with septic tanks \ndiffer across cities, from 30% in Bhopal and Gwalior to 80% in Ujjain. Of households with septic \ntanks, more than half report that the tanks are never cleaned and only 6% report cleaning them \nat the recommended frequency of every 2 years. Thus, even for households with septic tank \nfacilities, very few are working properly.  \n \n11.  Inadequate solid waste management is evident in all project cities.  Streets, drainage \nchannels, and open areas are littered with wastes.  Residents and business perceive the \nsituation as intolerable, affecting public health and indirectly affecting economic development, \nbut there is little motivation to initiate change. Without the Project, none of the increasing \nquantity of solid waste will be adequately disposed of and at least 40% will remain on streets \nand  in  public  places.    The  current  unhygienic  conditions  will  prevail,  with  associated \nenvironmental degradation and public health problems. \n \nB.  Urban Water Supply: Issues and Challenges \n \n1.  Core Issues of Urban Water Supply Sector in Madhya Pradesh \n \n12.  In all project cities, water from existing surface water and groundwater sources is \ntheoretically adequate for the present population.  However, the water produced does not reach \nthe target beneficiaries largely because of operational deficiencies. In fact, all cities suffer from \nhigh levels of nonrevenue water. Although there is no accurate information, nonrevenue water is \nestimated at more than 50% in all cities.  In particular, technical losses in the distribution \nnetwork are estimated to be in excess of 20%; nontechnical losses, through illegal connections, \nare also estimated to be in the same range. The losses from stand posts are thought to be very \nhigh as many do not work properly and large quantities of water are wasted. The design of the \nProject is therefore based on the principle that any capital investment to expand the distribution \nnetwork or augment the source should be preceded by system optimization to make the existing \nwater supply system more efficient and economical.  \n \n13.  Water charges for household connections are based on fixed rates and metering is \nundertaken in some cities only for commercial and industrial units. Except in Bhopal, the present \nmonthly charges for unmetered water connections are too low compared with the cost of \nproviding services. Although the consumers are willing to pay higher prices for better services, \nthe socioeconomic survey carried out under the TA showed that the record on tariff collection is \npoor as many consumers are not properly charged. The result is a chronic shortage of funds \neven for basic maintenance. To make up the shortfalls in revenues, the state government in the \npast had to provide direct and indirect fiscal support for operation and maintenance (O&M). In \nline with ADB's water policy,3 the Project will promote cost recovery principles and tariff reforms \nfor water conservation and its sustainable use. Consumers are expected to meet the full O&M \ncosts of water facilities and service provision through modified tariff structures and rates.

Manila.  \n ", "4  \nwater policy also highlights the importance of wide-ranging public awareness and community \neducation programs to broadcast the message that water is no longer a gift from the gods, but a \nresource that requires prudent management. For this purpose, the Project will introduce a \nfocused demand-side management program.   \n \n14.  The prevalence of high nonrevenue water and inadequate water charges below the cost \nindicate poor management. With the passage of the 74th constitutional amendment in Madhya \nPradesh in 1992, the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) was directed in 1995 to \ntransfer  assets  in  the  water  supply  sector  to  the  respective  city  corporations  for  O&M. \nConcurrently, PHED staff working on O&M were also placed under the functional control of the \ncity corporations, although administrative control over them remains with PHED at the state-\nlevel. For sector planning, design, and construction of new projects, PHED continued to assume \nresponsibility on behalf of the city corporations. In the long term, however, it is important that \nmanagement of water supply operations, from planning and development to service provision \nand O&M, be undertaken by a fully responsible and autonomous Water Supply and Sanitation \nDepartment.  Clearly, the current arrangement between the city corporation and PHED is \nneither sustainable nor cost-effective. To overcome present problems, several options have \nbeen reviewed and recommendations are made for implementation under the Project.   \n \n  2.  Lessons Learned from ADB-Assisted Urban Projects \n \n15.  There are at present six ongoing ADB-assisted urban sector projects in India. The total \nfinancial commitment of ADB in these projects is close to $900 million (external assistance to \nthe urban sector is summarized in Appendix 3). Of the six projects, two are lending to financial \ninstitutions  at  the  national  level  for  onlending  to  eligible  borrowers  in  the  housing  and \ncommercial urban infrastructure sectors. The remaining four are integrated urban development \nprojects for selected state and local governments to improve basic urban infrastructure.4 The \ncomponents in the integrated projects are multiple and range from water supply and sanitation, \nurban roads, and slum improvement to providing public toilets, vegetable markets, and fire-\nfighting equipment.  \n \n16.  It is generally recognized that integrated urban development projects are inherently \ncomplex as they typically include multiple sector investments for more than one urban area, \nalong  with  policy  reform,  capacity  building,  governance,  and  community  participation \ncomponents. Besides, the urban sector has traditionally been considered a difficult sector for \nproject  implementation  due  to  the  weak  capacities  of  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs),  the \nmultidisciplinary and interconnected nature of the works in the urban subsectors, and the \nreforms that are required to make the projects institutionally and financially sustainable. In \naddition, executing agencies (EAs) and participating municipalities that are new to ADB-assisted \nprojects need time as well as patience to fully familiarize themselves with ADB\u2019s technical and \nprocurement  requirements.  As  most  urban  projects  have  a  component  for  urban  poverty \nreduction at the community level, EAs and participating municipalities are also required to learn \nhow to deal with the urban poor through nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and local slum \nleaders\u2014a  time-consuming  process.  All  these  contributed  to  initial  delays  in  project \nimplementation and less than satisfactory performance of the ADB-assisted urban projects.   \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n ", "    5 \n \n17.  A number of lessons were learned from the design stage to project implementation. \nSome key lessons follow: (i) project design can be made simpler by focusing on large capital \ninvestments  for  basic  services,  while  the  smaller  revenue-generating  schemes  such  as \nmarketplaces, sites and services, and commercial complexes can be supported by local bodies \nout of their own funds; (ii) since the sustainability of the assets created under the project \ndepends on the level of ownership and commitment to reform displayed by local bodies, \nextensive interaction with local bodies is required in planning, design, and implementation; (iii) \nstate governments should have a dedicated project management structure in place from the TA \nstage and complete advance actions for recruiting of consultants before loan effectiveness; (iv) \nstandard bid documents should be made mandatory across procedures, which will save several \nmonths of time taken for their review and approval; (v) the project management unit (PMU) must \nbe staffed with competent and experienced personnel, who should be allowed a reasonable \ntenure of 3-4 years; (vi) an operational manual should be prepared at the preparatory stage \nitself, defining the role of each entity in the implementation framework and delegating suitable \npowers, which should be followed strictly so as to avoid delays in decision making; and (vii) an \nattempt should be made to integrate the poverty reduction components more closely with \nongoing  government  programs  and  traditional  delivery  mechanisms  at  the  local  level,  to \nmaximize impact and improve sustainability.  \n \n18.  The Project is designed to reflect all these lessons learned.  The scope of the Project is \nmade simpler by focusing on a few high-priority urban subsectors, which were identified through \na comprehensive socioeconomic survey and participatory consultations in each project city.  In \nterms  of  ownership,  state  and  local  governments  are  already  closely  involved  in  project \npreparation through a newly established project cell.  Dynamic and experienced staff are \nidentified and nominated to head the project cell, while the project implementation staff at the \nlocal level will be given full training before the loan becomes effective. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n19.  The primary objective is to promote sustainable growth and poverty reduction in the six \nproject cities in Madhya Pradesh, and thereafter in the other cities in the state. Specifically, the \nProject will (i) provide sustainable basic urban infrastructure and services to all citizens of the \nsix project cities; and (ii) strengthen the capacities of the project cities to plan and manage \nurban water supply and sanitation system in a more effective, transparent, and sustainable \nmanner.  While the Project will benefit the entire urban community in general, some components \nwill focus on upgrading the conditions of the poorest and most needy groups in the slum areas \nin particular.  The Project will also promote active participation of women citizens in municipal \nmanagement and project implementation as both beneficiaries and agents. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n20.  The Project comprises three parts.  Part A\u2014the urban water supply and environmental \nimprovement\u2014covers the improvement and expansion of the following municipal infrastructure \nand services: (i) urban water supply, (ii) sewerage and sanitation, (iii) storm water drainage, and \n(iv) solid waste management.  Part B\u2014is designed to increase the awareness and participation \nof the project beneficiaries in project implementation through (i) two community-level funds that \nwill  provide  for  participatory  planning  between  the  municipal  authorities  and  the  poor \ncommunities  at  the  neighborhood  level,  for  integrating  slum  improvements  with  citywide \ninfrastructure;  and  (ii)  the  Water  for  Asian  Cities  Program  in  India  covering  urban  water \n ", "6  \nconservation and demand management, to be financed through parallel cofinancing by United \nNations  Human  Settlements  Programme  (UN-HABITAT).    Part C\u2014project implementation \nassistance\u2014will be support to the PMU at state-level and project implementation unit (PIUs) at \ncity level, with activities immediately related to implementation of the Project.  \n \n1.  Part A: Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement \n \na.  Water Supply \n \n21.  This component will include (i) optimizing of the present system, including reducing \nnonrevenue  water  by  legitimizing  unauthorized  connections  and  stopping  leakages;  (ii) \nexpanding  the  distribution  system  into  unserved areas; and (iii) augmenting surface water \nproduction (intake and treatment) as required.   \n \nb.  Sewerage and Sanitation \n \n22.  The sewerage component is proposed for high-density city center areas where on-site or \nlocal wastewater treatment is not appropriate due to insufficient space.  Sewage treatment will \nbe  using  low-cost  maintenance/waste  stabilization  ponds.    In  lower  density  areas,  on-site \nsanitation will continue to be used, with the Project supplying equipment for emptying septic \ntanks.  Sewerage schemes are included for all project cities except Ratlam. In all cities, \ncommunity sanitation blocks will be provided for urban poor settlements where on-plot latrines \nare not possible. \n \nc.  Storm Water Drainage \n \n23.  This component will improve the storm water flow in urban drainage networks, based on \ncitywide drainage master plans and designs. Roadside drains will be improved to reduce major \ninundation from rainfall and waterlogging problems within the core urban areas.  Schemes are \nproposed for Gwalior, Jabalpur, and Ratlam.   \n \nd.  Solid Waste Management \n \n24.  This component will increase the efficiency of the collection and disposal service and \nextend coverage.  The targets are 85% of households in urban centers and 60% in peripheral \nareas.  The program for each project city includes (i) the supply of community waste collection \ncontainers, (ii) the supply of compactor trucks and dumper placer vehicles, and (iii) civil works to \nconstruct sanitary landfill sites with provision of equipment and other facilities for handling \nrefuse.  \n \n2.  Part B: Public Participation and Awareness Program \n \na.  Funds for Municipal Action Planning for Poverty Reduction (MAPP) \n \n25.  The objective of the MAPP process is to integrate the provision of tertiary urban services \nfor urban poor settlements into citywide development, and to build capacity within the municipal \ncorporations  for  participatory  planning  with  community  groups,  using  social  and  poverty \nanalysis.  For this purpose, two specific funds are provided under the Project based on the \nsuccessful experience in the state of Andra Pradesh.5 The Area Improvement Fund (AIF) will be \n                                                 \n5 The MAPP process was developed in 2000 and implemented under the Andhra Pradesh Urban Services for the \nPoor (APUSP) collaboration between the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) and \nthe government of Andhra Pradesh. \n ", "    7 \navailable to municipal corporations annually within the framework of the MAPP, which will be \nprepared by each project city corporation within 1 year of loan effectiveness and updated \nannually.  Eligible schemes include integrated upgrading of slum and poor settlements for \nimproved water supply, sanitation, drains, roads, and street lighting. The total value of the AIF is \n$5 million.  The Community Initiatives Fund (CIF) will be available to communities within slums \nidentified through the MAPP process to finance social sector and nonphysical initiatives. The \nparticipatory appraisal exercise during the TA identified a priority need for community centers, \neducation, income-generating schemes, and local health care support facilities. Local NGOs will \nbe engaged to assist in the MAPP process in each project city.  The participating NGOs will \nhave experience working with government agencies and communities in participatory planning \nand implementing environmental and slum improvement projects.  \n \n    b.  Water for Asian Cities Program in India   \n \n26.  During  the  loan  Fact-Finding  Mission,  ADB  and  UN-HABITAT jointly developed a \ncollaborative  framework  for  the  Water  for  Asian  Cities  Program  in  India  (Supplementary \nAppendix A) based on the broader memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between the \ntwo agencies on 18 March 2003.  According to this collaborative framework, the Water for Asian \nCities Program will cover capacity building, awareness, advocacy, and education activities in \nurban water conservation and demand management, among others. A detailed implementation \nstrategy and plan will be developed and formalized with the Ministry of Urban Development and \nPoverty Reduction.    \n \n3.  Part C: Implementation Assistance \n \na.  Consulting Services \n \n27.  Consulting services will be provided (i) to assist the PMU and PIUs in developing \nworking procedures and quality control to smoothly implement the Project; and (ii) to prepare \ndetailed designs of the various investment components for each project city, and assist in \nconstruction supervision and quality control of the works. \n \nb.  Public Relations and Awareness Program  \n \n28.  An awareness campaign through various media will be undertaken to make the public \naware of the short-term inconveniences and long-term benefits of the Project to gain the full \nsupport of the beneficiaries.  Beneficiaries will be also made aware of preventive care to avoid \nenvironmental  health-related  hazards  and  of  their  responsibilities  to  avoid  wasting  water, \nincluding issues such as water rates, user charges, property tax reform, etc. for achieving the \ngoals of the Project.  In addition, the campaign will provide feedback to the PMU to adjust the \nwork program based on the impact of the campaign and concerns raised by the beneficiaries. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n \n29.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $303.5 million equivalent (including taxes \nand duties of  $11.9 million equivalent), of which $72.9  million (24.0%) is foreign exchange \nincluding $17.4 million in interest during construction and other charges, and $230.6 million \nequivalent (76.0%) is local currency.

Financing Plan   \n \n30.  To meet the estimated project cost of $303.5 million equivalent, the Government has \nrequested ADB to provide a loan in the amount of $200.0 million from its ordinary capital \nresources, which will represent 65.9% of the total cost of the Project. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate  determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a 0.75% per annum commitment charge, a 0.5% front-end \nfee, conversion options in accordance with ADB's Conversion Guidelines, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Borrower will be India. \nThe foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government of India.  The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere  the  Government\u2019s  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n \n31.  The ADB loan of $200.0 million is proposed to finance 75.4% of the foreign exchange \ncost excluding the front-end fee, interest and other charges on the loan during construction, and \n62.9% or $145.0 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The local cost financing covers \npart of the costs relating to civil works, equipment, consulting services, and project management \nsupport, but excludes land, and duties and taxes estimated at $11.9 million. ADB\u2019s financing of \nthe local currency cost is considered justified given that financing for basic urban infrastructure \nis severely constrained. The state government and the project cities are taking steps to raise tax \nand nontax revenues, rationalize expenditures, and enhance the creditworthiness of ULBs. UN-\nHABITAT will provide and administer parallel grant cofinancing of $0.5 million. The government \nof the state will provide local currency financing of $33.2 million equivalent to cover part of the \ncost of consulting services and the cost of counterpart staff required for the proposed PMU, \ntaxes and duties, and a grant equivalent to 20% of the investment for the water supply scheme \nto Indore Corporation. The six cities will provide the remaining local currency cost of $52.4 \n ", "    9 \nmillion  equivalent  or  17.3%  of  the  total  project  cost  to  cover  civil  works,  equipment  and \nmaterials, consulting services, and the cost of counterpart staff required for the proposed PIUs \n(Table 2).  \n \n  Table 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   % \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank  55.0  145.0  200.0  65.9 \nUN-HABITAT  0.5  0.0  0.5  0.1 \nGovernment of Madhya  17.4 a  33.2b  50.6  16.7 \nPradesh  \nProject Cities   0.0  52.4  52.4  17.3 \nTotal    72.9  230.6  303.5  100.0 \na \nIncluding front-end fees, interests during construction, and commitment charges. \nb Including taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n32.  It is expected that in accordance with the prevailing practice for externally financed \nprojects  in  India,  the  Government  will  relend  70%  of  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  in  rupees \nequivalent at 10.5% per annum with repayments over 25 years including a grace period of 5 \nyears; the remaining 30% will be provided as a grant to the state government. The state \ngovernment  will  onlend  the  total  proceeds  from  the  Government  to  the  six  project  city \ncorporations on the same terms. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n33.  The Urban Administration and Development Department (UADD) of the government of \nMadhya Pradesh will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the Project and will be responsible for \noverall  strategic  guidance,  technical  supervision,  execution  of  the  Project,  and  ensuring \ncompliance with the loan covenants. UADD will set up a state-level PMU, led by a full-time \nproject director. The project director will be charged exclusively with executing the Project and \nwill  have  no  other  duties  within  UADD.  The  project  director,  supported  by  the  PMU  and \nconsultants, will coordinate all activities under the Project; will be responsible for overall project \nimplementation, monitoring, and supervision; and will directly report to the secretary of UADD \nunder the overall supervision of the principal secretary of UADD. The project director will be \nsupported by at least one deputy project director for (i) managing and implementing urban \ninfrastructure and services, and for (ii) overseeing and guiding the public participation and \nawareness  activities  and  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  covenants.  An  accounting  and \nadministrative unit will be set up to manage procurement and loan account administration. The \nPMU will be properly staffed and assisted by consultants with expertise in engineering, finance \nand  accounting,  social  and  gender  development,  institutional  development,  community \ndevelopment, procurement, finance, resettlement and urban planning. Overall implementation \narrangements are in Appendix 5.  \n \n34.  A state-level Empowered Committee (EC) will be set up with full powers to decide on \nmatters related to the Project.  The Empowered Committee will consist of the project director as \nmember secretary, the Chief Secretary (chair person), UADD, Finance Department, Public \nHealth and Engineering Department, and commissioner of UADD. Other relevant officials may \n ", "10  \nbe invited as necessary. Once the Project is made effective, the EC will meet regularly (at least \nonce every 3 months) to review project performance and decide on major issues, such as \ncounterpart  funding,  implementation bottlenecks, land disputes, special procurement, policy \nreforms, etc. \n \n35.  The PMU will be responsible for (i) appointing project management consultants, detailed \ndesign  and  construction  supervision  consultants,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME) \nconsultants, public relations and community awareness consultants, and NGOs;  (ii) approving \nthe design of the investment components in consultation with the project city corporations; (iii) \nprequalifying  contractors;  (iv)  implementing  public  relations  and  community  awareness \nprograms; (v) preparing standard bid documents; (vi) monitoring the tendering process and \nguiding the project cities in bid evaluation and preparing bid evaluation reports for approval by \nADB;  (vii)  procuring  equipment  at  the  state-level  including  those  related  to  solid  waste \nmanagement;  (viii)  coordinating  with  ADB  on  matters  related  to  disbursements;  and  (ix) \nmaintaining project documents and submitting timely reports6 to ADB.   \n \n36.  In each project city, a PIU will be established, headed by the municipal commissioner \nsupported by a full-time senior technical person experienced in public health and environmental \nengineering. 7  The PIU will comprise three sections: (i) urban infrastructure and services, (ii) \ncommunity awareness and participation, and (iii) finance and administration.  The number of \nPIU staff will range from 10 in Ratlam to 17 in Indore, placed on the basis of the volume of work \nto handle. \n \n37.  The responsibilities of the PIU will include carrying out detailed surveys, investigations \nand engineering designs of the individual city components; tendering, evaluating bids and \nawarding  works,  contract  administration,  supervision  and  quality  control;  measuring  works \ncarried out by the contractors, certifying payments, conducting public awareness campaigns \nand  participation  programs,  BME  studies,  environmental  assessment,  complying  with  loan \ncovenants, and preparing monthly reports.  \n \n38.  The performance of the PIU will be monitored and guided by a city steering committee \nchaired by each city mayor.  For each city, the committee will comprise the collector of the \nrelevant district or his/her nominee, representatives from the state\u2019s Public Health Engineering \nDepartment, Pollution Control Board, the State Electricity Board and four elected municipal \ncounselors (including one woman and one from a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe). Once the \nProject is made effective, each city steering committee will meet regularly to review progress \nand sort out local issues and policy matters, at least once every 3 months.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period and Start-Up Activities \n \n39.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from the date of loan effectiveness. \nAppendix 6 presents the implementation schedule.  To minimize start-up delays observed from \nsimilar  ADB-assisted  urban  projects  in  India,  ADB  will  help  the  state  and  municipal \ngovernments8  establish  tendering  procedures  and  prepare  prequalification  documents, \nprequalify  contractors  for  civil  works,  and  prepare  standard  bid  documents  for  contract \npackages.  Advance action for recruiting consultants (project management consultancy [PMC] \nand  design  and  supervision  consultancy  [DSC])  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  loan \n                                                 \n6 Including monthly project performance reports, quarterly progress reports, BME reports.  \n7 Terms of reference for the PMU and PIUs are in Supplementary Appendices  B and C. \n8  ADB.  2003.

The Government and the EA were advised that advance action does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n40.  Goods, works, and services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement.  Procurement will generally be carried out by the PIUs under the \nguidance of the PMU, except for equipment and vehicles common to all cities, which will be \ndirectly procured by the PMU.  Equipment and selected materials will be acquired using \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB), international shopping (IS), and local competitive bidding \n(LCB) procedures as appropriate. To the extent possible, goods to be procured will be grouped \ninto packages larger than $500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous goods for \nimmediate use that cannot be grouped into a larger contract and that cost less than $500,000 \nper  contract  will  be  procured  through  IS  or  LCB  procedures.  Off-the-shelf  items  and \nstandardized products costing $100,000 or less will be procured following the state\u2019s applicable \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n41.  Given the project areas\u2019 remoteness and the nature of works, civil works contracts \nvalued at less than $5 million each would not be attractive to international bidders, and therefore \nwill be carried out using LCB procedures acceptable to ADB.  Some civil works such as water \ntreatment plants, sewage treatment plants, pumping stations, and solid waste management \nsanitary landfill disposal sites will be undertaken on a turnkey basis.9  To expedite project \nimplementation, advance action in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement, will be \nundertaken  for  (i)  prequalifying  contractors,  and  (ii)  preparing  tender  documents.  The \nGovernment and the EA were advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinance the Project. Equipment, materials or civil works costing $100,000 or less including for \nuse by community organizations or NGOs for the slum improvement activities related to AIF and \nCIF will be procured following the state\u2019s applicable procurement procedures acceptable to \nADB. The indicative procurement packages are given in Appendix 7. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n42.  Consulting  services  are  required  for  project  management,  engineering  design, \nconstruction supervision, procurement of goods and services, public relations and awareness, \nand BME.  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging \ndomestic consultants. \n \n43.  Five  packages  of  consulting  services  will  be  provided.    An  international  firm  in \nassociation with domestic firms will be engaged using the quality and cost based method of \nselection for the PMC to assist the PMU in overall administration  and management of the \nProject.  The  estimated  staffing  requirement  for  the  PMC  is  372  person-months  (102 \ninternational and 270 domestic). There will be two DSCs, which will be domestic firms. The \nDSCs  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  project  city  PIUs  in  survey,  investigation,  detailed \nengineering  designs,  preparing  contract  documents,  tendering,  supervision,  quality  control, \nproject reporting, and preparing municipal action plans for poverty reduction.  DSC (east) will \nassist the PIUs in Bhopal, Gwalior, and Jabalpur and require an estimated staffing of 1,624 \nperson-months.  DSC (west) will assist the PIUs in Indore, Ratlam, and Ujjain with an estimated \nstaffing of 1,721 person-months.  Domestic firms bidding for the DSCs will not be eligible to \n                                                 \n9 Where the cost, insurance, and freight or ex-factory cost of goods and supplies for permanent works of one \npackage is estimated to equal or exceed 60%, such procurement package should not be treated as a civil works \npackage. \n ", "12  \nassociate with an international firm bidding for the PMC.  The same domestic firms cannot be \nselected for both DSCs. In addition, domestic firms will be engaged for the public relations and \nawareness program, and BME of the Project in the project cities (Supplementary Appendix D).   \n \n5.  Financing of Community-Based Activities \n \n44.  To complement the capacity building and to promote the necessary reforms, the MAPP \nprocess will be adopted (Supplementary Appendix E).  Local community committees will be \nestablished for the participatory planning and implementation of the AIF and CIF, which will be \nheld by the PMU.  The PMU will allocate the indicative budget planning figures (IPF) to the city \ncorporations. The first IPF will be calculated for each city in a proportion equal to the slum \npopulation. Subsequent allocations may be adjusted on an incentive basis to allow for bonuses \nto the corporations that perform well.  The details of individual and group assistance under the \nCIF  will  be  decided  during  the  planning  process.  The provided microcredit facility will be \nrepayable in over 24 bimonthly installments carrying interest not exceeding 9%. The funds will \nbe disbursed to the city corporations or directly to contractors and suppliers on a reimbursable \nbasis following approved completion of specified stages.  Financial accounting and reporting will \nbe the responsibility of the city commissioner who will submit quarterly progress reports and \naccounts to the PMU. The PMU will make quarterly monitoring visits to each city and will \nannually evaluate the AIF and CIF. \n   \n6.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n45.  Land acquisition problems have frequently been a major source of implementation delay \nin urban projects in India.  Under the Project, the land acquisition requirements have been \nminimized.  Most of the proposed improvement and construction work will be carried out on \navailable government land, except for the solid waste disposal site in Indore and the sewage \ntreatment  plant  in  Jabalpur  (para.  46).    However,  activities  of  roadside  vendors  will  be \ntemporarily displaced when water pipelines and sewers are laid.  The total number of people \naffected  by  the  Project  can  only  be  estimated  after  the  detailed  design  of  the  individual \ncomponents, which will try to minimize resettlement and loss or disruption of income-generating \nassets.  If, during detailed design, involuntary resettlement arises from land acquisition or \ntemporary  disruption  of  income  generation,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented in accordance with government laws and procedures, ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement,  and  the  Project\u2019s  agreed-upon  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework \n(Supplementary Appendix F).  The overall land acquisition and resettlement requirements under \nthe Project are summarized in Appendix 8.  \n \n46.  In Indore, land for the new solid waste disposal site was provisionally identified, but not \nconfirmed  by  the  municipal  corporation.  No  government-owned  land  is  available  within  a \nreasonable distance, so purchasing privately owned land is being considered.  The 25-hectare \n(ha) site being considered is about 10 kilometers (km) from the city center and 1 km away from \nhabitation.  In Jabalpur, construction of a sewage treatment plant will require 55 ha, but only 25 \nha of  government land is available.  Acquisition of the additional 30 ha of privately owned \nunirrigated land would affect 12 agricultural plots.  Fourteen households (77 persons) will suffer \nfull or partial loss of property.  Most of the landowners have their own businesses or are \nemployed professionals who hire local labor to cultivate their plots.  Four households will require \nrelocation and will be accommodated within the same village.  A total of 64 persons will be \nindirectly affected and suffer income/wage losses.  A short resettlement plan (Supplementary \nAppendix G) has been prepared and the affected households will receive cash for land and \nimmovable assets at replacement prices.  Compensation will be provided for loss of livelihood, \nand shifting of structures and goods.   \n ", "    13 \n7.  Operation and Maintenance  \n \n47.  O&M of the assets provided under the Project will be the responsibility of the six project \ncity corporations.  The municipal corporation presently maintains water supply and sewerage \nwith assistance from PHED staff who are administratively responsible to the state government.  \nIt is recommended that the present system of PHED/municipal corporation dual authority be \ndiscontinued  and  that  water  and  sanitation  departments  autonomous  within  the  municipal \nstructure be established.  Where experienced PHED staff need to be retained for undertaking \nO&M, PHED should make them available on a contract basis to the project city corporations.  \nWith the introduction of better demand side management and domestic water metering, the \nwater  works  department  should  be  responsible  for  water  meter  reading,  billing,  and \nmaintenance.  This leads to a process of increased financial accountability and the option for \ncontracting  out  of  the  municipal  water  works  departments  or  introducing  private  sector \nparticipation.  A water supply management plan for improving O&M in the project cities is in \nAppendix 9. \n \n48.  Solid waste management operations are presently under the control of the chief health \nofficer, but guidelines by the Supreme Court in 2000 require that each city establish a dedicated \nDepartment of Solid Waste and Industrial Pollution headed by a technically trained director.  \nPrimary and secondary collection and transportation services already contracted out to the \nprivate sector in some of the project cities, should be expanded.  But maximum efficiency and \ncost savings in waste recycling and disposal will occur only if collection, transportation, and final \ndisposal are under the same organization. \n \n8.  Disbursement and Second Generation Imprest Account (SGIA) \n \n49.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook and Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Products. \nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  and  to  expedite \nimplementation of the Project through the timely release of loan proceeds, a second generation \nimprest account (SGIA)10 will be opened if the state government commits to fully adhere to the \nprescribed procedures as agreed-upon by the Government and ADB. Under the SGIA, the \ncontroller of aid accounts and audit (CAAA) will pass on the rupee equivalent of ADB\u2019s imprest \nadvance to the EA through the budgetary mechanism. The EA will maintain the advance in a \nseparate commercial bank account and withdraw from it only the eligible portion of expenditure. \nIn  the  event  a  SGIA  is  established,  it  will  be  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook and the detailed arrangements agreed to by \nthe Borrower and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed \nthe lesser of the equivalent of six months expenditures or 10% of loan amount. The initial and \nsubsequent amounts to be deposited in the SGIA will be determined by ADB in consultation with \nthe Borrower. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be adopted for reimbursing \nand liquidating SGIA for eligible expenditures not exceeding $50,000, except as ADB may \notherwise agree during project implementation. \n \n9.   Accounts, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n50.  The  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  obtaining  and  consolidating  relevant \ninformation from the respective PIUs. The progress reports will describe physical progress, \n                                                 \n10 In India, second generation imprest accounts have been allowed for Gujarat Emergency Earthquake Rehabilitation \nProject (Loan 1826-IND) (1999) and Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project (Loan 1647-IND) (2001).  \nSupplementary Appendix H gives the detailed arrangements for SGIA. \n ", "14  \ndetails  of  any  modification  required  to  the  project  implementation  schedule,  problems \nencountered, use of AIF and CIF, and an outline of the work for the next quarter. The report will \nalso provide summary financial accounts of the Project: expenditure during the quarter, year-to-\ndate expenditure during the quarter, year-to-date expenditure, and expenditure to date. The \nPMU will also submit to ADB, within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, a project \ncompletion report that will cover the details of implementation, costs, monitoring and evaluation \nactivities, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n51.  The PMU and the PIUs will establish and maintain separate accounts and records  \nadequate to identify the incomes and expenditures related to the Project. They will be assisted \nby an adequate number of suitably qualified accounting staff including an accounts officer. \nDetailed consolidated annual project accounts, as maintained by the PMU, will be audited by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB and will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the \nclose of the fiscal year. The annual audit report will include the audit of the imprest account, \nSGIA, and SOE procedure, and a separate audit opinion on the use of the SGIA and SOE \nprocedures. UADD and the six project city corporations have been made aware of ADB\u2019s policy \non delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the \naudited accounts. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n52.  The responsibility for ensuring that the project performance monitoring system (PPMS) \nis established and undertaken rests with the PMU.  The PPMS has numerous categories of \nmonitoring, corresponding to development activities and representing the direct and indirect \noutcomes expected from the Project.  The PPMS also defines the responsibility for monitoring, \nrecording, and reporting.  Certain tasks will be outsourced to external contractors; others form \npart of the routine reporting from the PIUs at the city level to the central PMU.  The indicators to \nbe monitored have been formulated and discussed with the state and municipal governments; \nthey include (i) physical progress of infrastructure works, (ii) institutional development and \ncapacity building, and (iii) impact assessment indicators (Supplementary Appendix I). The PMU \nwill  conduct  initial  baseline  physical  and  socioeconomic  surveys  and  submit  a  detailed \nimplementation plan for monitoring performance and for preparing benchmarking information for \nADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness.  Thereafter, the PMU will \nsubmit annual monitoring and evaluation reports to ADB throughout project implementation. \n \n11.  Project Review \n \n53.  Project performance will be reviewed in a three-tier system.  First, the PMC will review \nprogress on each component and the performance of each city PIU. The review will take place \nin the first 10 days of the month for the previous month\u2019s performance.  Monthly performance \nreports will be prepared for each project city by the DSC and submitted to the PMU.  Based on \nthe reviews, the PMC will suggest changes in the project design and implementation, or refer \nthe issues to the EC through the PMU.  The review report will be sent to ADB, the EC, and the \ncity steering committees for necessary action.   \n \n54.  The EC will conduct the second tier review during its quarterly meetings.  The monthly \nproject performance reviews and major policy issues will be reviewed and actions to be taken by \nthe respective authorities will be recorded.  The results of the review will be circulated to ADB, \nUADD, and the project city corporations.  The third tier review will be conducted by ADB every 6 \nmonths, with the ADB Review Mission visiting project cities, to discuss major issues with UADD \nand the project city corporations and forward their opinion for action at the state government \nlevel.  \n ", "    15 \n \n55.  The project review will be supplemented by a formal comprehensive midterm review\u2014 \nwith the participation of senior Central Government and state officials as well as ADB staff\u2014\nwhen detailed design is completed and major contracts have been awarded and started. The \nreview will be held about 24 months after the loan effectiveness date.  It will critically evaluate \nactual project progress, implementation procedures, procurement methods, public relations and \ncommunity awareness, BME activities, and the performance of the design and supervision \nconsultants.  Following the review, corrective measures, as appropriate, will be introduced to \nremedy any identified weaknesses. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Major Benefits and Impacts \n \n1.  Social and Poverty Impact \n \n56.  The Project will address in an integrated manner citywide deficiencies in basic needs. \nDirect social benefits will be sustained improvements in water supply, sanitation, and garbage \ncollection and disposal within the project cities. Indirect benefits will be through improved living \nconditions, a healthier living environment, and the prospect of improved health status of the \npopulation. The social and poverty impact of the Project was assessed from the TA baseline \nsocioeconomic survey of benefits and costs, which apply to different groups of the population \nwithin the six cities.  Overall, the survey respondents identified lack of access to a reliable in-\nhouse water supply as the foremost deficiency.  Although the coverage of the existing water \ndistribution network in the project cities is as high as 85%, water pressure, and frequency and \nduration of supply are extremely low.  Therefore benefits from improved efficiency of the existing \nwater  supply  system  will  accrue  to  all  present  users.  In  addition,  almost  1  million  new \nconsumers will gain access to piped water supply by 2010. Poor households (estimated to be \n25% of the total urban population) outside slum settlements will be fully integrated into the new \nexpanded water supply system. Improved supply at slum boundaries is also an indirect benefit \nto  slum  settlements.  For  slum  dwellers  to  directly  benefit  from  the  Project,  additional \ninvestments are required to improve tertiary distribution within the settlements. For this purpose, \nalternative water supply services run by community groups will be considered. Small-scale \nwater providers can play an important role in helping the poor in slum settlements connect to the \nedge of the expanded municipal grid system. For instance, the water schemes under the AIF \nwill benefit up to 100,000 slum dwellers with the construction of tertiary distribution network \ninside the slum settlements. \n \n57.  From the sanitation component, direct benefits will be obtained by households that will \nbe able to connect to the sewerage network. The network will be located in the densely built-up \nand developing areas of the city center. The percentage of the poor households in this area is \nslightly below the citywide average of 25%. An underground sewerage network will, however, \nreach the boundaries of slum areas within the scheme area and will allow the construction of \nsewered community latrines that will benefit an estimated 4% of the poor households. The solid \nwaste component will operate on a citywide basis, with little difference in the standard of service \nwithin cities. The proportion of the poor beneficiaries is therefore the same as for each city as a \nwhole.  A summary of the poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. Since the \nProject will focus on the urban area, it will not adversely affect indigenous peoples or ethnic \nminorities. \n \n \n ", "16  \n2.  Gender Impact \n \n58.  A fundamental direct benefit of the water supply component will be the reduction of \nwomen's work in fetching, storing, and using water.  The improved levels of water delivery and \naccessibility will reduce the overall time for collecting water and the need for storage.  During \nthe participatory rapid appraisal exercise, poor women cited fetching and storing water for \ndomestic use as their second priority for improvement.  The topmost priority was toilets because \nnearly half of poor women defacate outdoors, one quarter use public toilets, and the rest use \npay toilets.  Thus the provision of underground sewerage and community sanitation blocks will \nreduce the practice of defecating outdoors, which is not only inconvenient but a cause for \ninsecurity  especially  in  unlit  and  marginal  communities.    Drainage  facilities  and  improved \ngarbage collection citywide will bring indirect benefits of a healthier environment for women and  \na reduced work burden in the household.  During project implementation, a gender action plan \n(Supplementary Appendix J) will be carried out to promote active participation of women in \nmunicipal management and project implementation as both beneficiaries and agents. \n \n3.  Economic Analysis  \n \n59.  All  the  project  components  have  a  strong  economic  rationale  since  they  provide \nminimum  acceptable  standards  for  basic  living  conditions  and  assist  in  removing  existing \nconstraints  on  social  development  and  economic  growth.    Similarly,  all  components  were \ndesigned along sound principles of priority need, consultation and targeting, and demand \nmanagement and rehabilitation before new investment. They represent technically feasible \noptions at the least cost. \n \n60.  All six investments for the water supply component are shown to be viable although the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) in the Indore scheme is lower at 13.3% than that in the \nother cities (ranging from 28.6% in Ujjain to 56.5% in Bhopal) because of the high capital and \noperating costs of pumping the treated water to a height of 550 meters from the river source for \ndelivery to the city over a distance of 70 km. In Indore, which is a commercial center and a \nthriving city, the without-the-Project situation could not be fully reflected in the valuation of \nbenefits11(economic analysis is in Appendix 11). For sewerage/sanitation, the base EIRRs are \nhigher than the economic cost of capital in the project cities except Gwalior and Jabalpur. Solid \nwaste projects have a strong economic justification and, although the EIRR for Gwalior is shown \nto be marginal, the environmental benefits outweigh the risks of undertaking the project.  \n \n4.  Cost Recovery and Affordability  \n \n61.  The current financial positions of the project cities is  inadequate to continue system \nimprovement and increase service coverage, and also meet their share of counterpart funding \nand debt servicing. Currently applicable taxes and fees are low as also is their collection \nefficiency. A critical issue for the project cities in meeting financial commitments is their ability to \nraise resources. The Project aims to help the city corporations improve revenue generation from \nown sources, and ensure that the administration and O&M costs of both existing and project \nassets  are  adequately  covered.  The  financial  improvement  action  plan (Appendix 12) is \ndesigned to enable the project city corporations to raise resources under a time-bound program. \n                                                 \n11 The contingent valuation method based on willingness to pay fails to quantify the benefit of providing necessary \nwater to avoid crisis and ensure economic survival of the city. Without the proposed optimization under the Project, \nthe nonrevenue water rate will go up as high as 70% by 2010 and the water supply will fall below 40 lpcd. This \nimplies water crisis and Indore will no longer be able to function as the trading and industrial capital of the state. \nThe economic, social, and poverty impact would be very severe indeed. Other benefits of piped water include \nenhanced health, which is not quantified in the EIRR calculation. \n ", "    17 \n \n62.  The  socioeconomic  survey  shows  a  willingness  to  pay  for  municipal  services.  An \naffordability analysis, based on proposed tariffs and household income data from the social \nsurvey, shows that the proposed tariffs for water supply and sewerage surcharge are within the \ngenerally acceptable limit of 4-5% of average household income. In the lower 20% households, \nthe tariffs are below 2%. The risk that the proposed tariffs are not affordable is minimal since the \ntariffs are within the affordability limit by a sufficient margin.  In addition, to enable the low-\nincome  households  (income  limit  to  be  fixed  in  consultation  with  ADB)  to  have  private \nconnections to the piped water supply and sewerage, the project city corporations will provide \nthese households with interest-free loans repayable over 12 months. \n \n63.  Financial  analysis  (Appendix  13)  assessed  the  viability  of  the  revenue-generating \ncomponents of the Project.  The financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) for water supply \nschemes vary between 18.5% and 5.2% and, combined with sewerage schemes, between \n13.4% and 4.9%, which compares favorably with the 4.0% weighted average cost of capital in \nreal terms. Sensitivity tests indicate that the FIRR is more sensitive to decreased revenues and \ndelaying project benefits by 1 year.  \n \n5.  Environmental Aspects  \n \n64.  The Project is an environmental category B project. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE) was carried out for each project city. The examinations show that adverse environmental \neffects will be limited and can be mitigated through integrated corrective measures. A detailed \nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. The examinations indicate that a safe, clean, \nreliable water supply and improved sewage and waste disposal systems in urban areas will \nsignificantly  improve  public  health  and  environmental  conditions  in  the  project  cities.  The \nexisting problems of polluted pools of standing water, unpleasant odors, and health risks \nassociated with increased quantities of wastewater and haphazard garbage disposal will be \nmitigated  or  eliminated  by  integrating  water  supply  with improved drainage and sanitation \nsystems, improved waste collection, and sanitary disposal as well as heightened public health \nawareness. The quality of life and community health profiles of the project cities will improve. \nThe disposal of sludge in the project water treatment plants will be improved by providing \nsettlement basins. \n \n65.  There are no known endangered varieties of flora or species of fauna, or sites of \nhistorical or cultural significance in the project areas that are likely to be affected. Land areas for \nthe  proposed  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management  have  been  developed  or \ndisturbed previously and have no forest or unusual vegetation cover. The major impacts of the \nproject will be temporary, including those on health  and safety in the communities during \nconstruction, turbidity, dust, and noise generated by construction equipment. Environmental \ntraining will be offered to staff of the PMU and the PIUs to strengthen their capacities to address \nenvironmental  concerns  during  the  design  and  construction  phases  of  the  Project.  The \ncontractors will be required to prepare and implement their own management plans, and carry \nout construction in line with international standards. Another measure to be implemented as part \nof the Project is enforcement of regulations for treatment and discharge of industrial wastewater.  \nThe summary IEE is given in Appendix 14. \n \nB.  Major Risks and Safeguards \n \n66.  While no unusual risks are foreseen during implementation, the potential risks concern \n(i) sustainability of the facilities and services provided under the Project; (ii) lack of suitably \nqualified personnel in the PIUs, which may eventually lead to weak implementation of individual \n ", "18  \ninvestment components in each city; (iii) implementation delays due to slow progress in start-up \nactivities (recruiting consultants and setting up the project management structure); (iv) timely \navailability of counterpart funding from the participating municipalities; and (v) inappropriate \nmanagement and accounting system of water works departments. \n \n67.  Financial sustainability of the project investments will be ensured by implementing the \nfinancial improvement action plan.  Some project cities (Bhopal and Ratlam) have already \nraised water charges and others are also required to pass a resolution to implement the plan \nwithin 1 month from loan effectiveness.  The issues related with project implementation will be \nfully reviewed and dealt with through the Capacity Building TA.  To avoid delays caused by \nshortage of counterpart funds, it must be ensured that each municipal budget includes sufficient \namounts  to  cover  the  municipal  corporation\u2019s  share  of  the  annual  project  investment \nrequirement. Finally, the sustainability of water supply systems will depend to a large extent on \nthe establishment of an autonomous and accountable water and sanitation department in each \nmunicipality. For this purpose, project city corporations gave assurances that the water supply \nmanagement improvement plan (Appendix 9) will be implemented in accordance with the \nagreed-upon timetable.      \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n68.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Central Government, the state government, \nand  the  six  project  city  corporations  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  are \nincorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The state will ensure that the six project city corporations execute the financial \nimprovement actions in accordance with the agreed-upon timetable (Appendix \n12), including (a) revising water charges and introducing a progressive block rate \nwater  tariff;  (b)  reassessing  properties  and  revising  taxes;  (c)  introducing  a \nsewerage surcharge; and (d) improving collection efficiency. There will be no \namendments to the timetable without the prior consent of ADB.  \n(ii)  The state will ensure that the six project city corporations undertake actions to \nmeet the long-term objective of improving urban water supply management in \naccordance with the agreed-upon timetable (Appendix 9).   \n(iii)  The state will ensure that  (a) each of the six project corporations prepares an \ninitial MAPP within 1 year after loan effectiveness and annually thereafter for \nsubmission to the PMU in accordance with the agreed-upon MAPP framework \n(Supplementary Appendix E);  (b) adequate allocations are made from the AIF to \nthe project city corporations, and from the CIF to the PIUs for community-based \nactivities, in each case only for approved schemes under the MAPP; (c) the \nquarterly reports prepared by the PMU include progress made and statements on \nthe use of funds under AIF and CIF; and (d) the PMU appraises each MAPP, \nincluding the schemes funded from the AIF and the CIF, annually in the third \nquarter of each MAPP cycle. \n(iv)  The state will ensure that the gender action plan as set out in Supplementary \nAppendix  J  is  implemented  and  that  the  PMU  prepares  field  manuals  and \nconducts training on the gender action plan for PMU and PIU staff.   \n(v)  The state and the six project city corporations will ensure that (a) the Project is \ncarried out in accordance with the existing environmental laws and regulations of \nIndia and the  Environment Policy of the Asian Development Bank  (2002) and \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003);  (b)  all  monitoring  and \n ", "    19 \nmitigation  measures  indicated  in  the  IEE  and  provided  for  under  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  are  undertaken  for  the  Project;  (c)  project \nimplementation will include consultation with local communities on environmental \nissues;  (d)  ULBs  will  take  a  proactive  role  in  environmental  planning, \nmanagement, and monitoring; (e) State Pollution Control Board clearance will be \nobtained for all applicable project components before starting work on those \ncomponents; and (f) existing waste disposal sites that have reached full capacity \nwill be properly sealed after 3 months of operation of the new sanitary landfills. \n(vi)   The state will ensure that (a) project components are designed so as to minimize \nresettlement; and (b) if, during detailed design of project components, involuntary \nresettlement  arises  from  land  acquisition  or  temporary  disruption  of  income \ngeneration, a resettlement plan will be prepared and implemented in accordance \nwith government laws and procedures, ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, \nand  the  Project\u2019s  agreed-upon  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework \n(Supplementary Appendix F). Based on the final engineering designs, the state \nwill update and revise the resettlement plan and submit this for ADB\u2019s review and \napproval  before  civil  works  contracts  are  awarded.  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the \nresettlement plan will be a condition for awarding civil works contracts. All land \nrequired  for  a  project  component,  including  any  that  may  entail  involuntary \nresettlement, will be acquired not later than 12 months after loan effectiveness; if \nnot,  the  component  will  be  eliminated  from  the  Project  unless  ADB  agrees \notherwise. The state will cause the short resettlement plan relating to the sewage \ntreatment plant in Jabalpur to be implemented. \n(vii)  The state will cause the EC to be established and the first meeting held within 3 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. \n(viii)  The state will ensure that each project city corporation establishes a city steering \ncommittee and that the first meeting is held within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \n (ix)  The state will ensure that the route of the proposed water supply transmission \npipeline from Narmada River to Indore is within the existing right-of-way, with no \nnew acquisition of forest or other land, unless identified as necessary during \ndetailed project design.  \n(x)  The state will ensure that Indore and Ujjain city corporations are allowed to  \ndischarge and treat sewage in the sewage treatment plants constructed under \nthe  centrally  sponsored  schemes  before  awarding  the  sewerage  network \ncontracts.  \n(xi)  The state will ensure that Ratlam obtains permission from the Water Resources \nDepartment (WRD) for drawing an additional 9 million litres per day (Mld) of raw \nwater from Dhulawad Dam for the water supply augmentation scheme before \nawarding the contract for the scheme.   \n(xii)  The state will ensure that the project city corporations adopt ADB's approved \nstandard bidding documents, evaluation criteria and procedures for awarding \ncontracts  for  all  procurement  contracts  under  the  Project  and  before  any \nprocurement.  \n(xiii)  The state will ensure that project city corporations maintain a facility for providing \nfinancial  assistance  to  low-income  households  (income  limit  will  be  fixed  in \nconsultation with ADB) to ensure connection to the water and sewer systems.  \n(xiv)  The state will endeavor that the project city corporations regularly pay their \nelectricity  bills  to  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board  and  will  not \naccumulate any new arrears starting FY2005. \n(xv)  The state will ensure that a system for audit of accounts by external auditors is \nintroduced for the six project cities.  The external auditors will complete the audit \nof FY2004 accounts of the project city corporations by 31 December 2004. \n ", "20  \nThereafter, the audits will be completed annually within 9 months of each year-\nend. \n(xvi)  The state will allocate, and will ensure that the project city corporations allocate, \nadequate amounts in their annual budget to meet their respective investment \nrequirements in accordance with the disbursement schedule in each project city. \n(xvii)  The state will cause each project city corporations to prepare and submit a \nresolution to its municipal council to execute the Financial Improvement Action \nPlan in accordance with the agreed-upon timetable, within 1 month from loan \neffectiveness. \n \nB.

Bhopal  is  the  state  capital  and  the  second  largest  city  in  the  state.    Before \nindependence, Bhopal was just a small town but it grew very quickly after 1956, largely due to \nits designation as the state's capital city.  Located roughly in the middle of the state and in the \nEast-West corridor, connectivity by rail, road, and air is reasonably good. The city is situated \nbeside two lakes and is divided into two distinct parts, old Bhopal and new Bhopal.  In addition \nto its public sector role, Bhopal is a center of education and engineering among other industries \nand is also developing as a center for trade. The city became known internationally in 1984 as a \nresult of the Union Carbide industrial accident.  Aftermath of the incident, new Bhopal has been \ndeveloped with the support of the state government.  \n \n2.  Gwalior the fourth largest city, has its origin as a princely state. It was previously the \ncapital of Scindia State and is located north of the state on the Agra-Mumbai highway.  It is a \nhistoric  city  and  boasts  a  dramatic  hilltop  fort,  built  more  than  1,000  years  ago.    It  has \ntraditionally been an important seat of learning and culture.  As with many cities, recent years \nhave seen the decline of traditional industries\u2014mainly cotton manufacture\u2014and the closure of \nhalf of the city\u2019s large industrial units and many smaller units within the city boundaries. Two \nnew industrial estates developed outside the city have been reasonably successful.  The city \nhas  been  declared  a  counter  balance  city  of  the  National  Capital  Region  (NCR)  and  is \ndeveloping plans to capitalize on this, but the counter balance function has yet to develop.  On \nthe other side of the city, the Indian Air Force base limits expansion to the northwest.   \n \n3.  Indore is the largest city in the state and is the business and trading capital.  Located at \nthe crossroads of western and central India, Indore has relatively good connectivity by road, rail, \nand air.  Historically, Indore was always a trading center, particularly for foodstuffs, and has \nbeen the hub of trade and commerce, not only for the state, but also for western India. Since the \ndecline of its traditional industries including textiles, the economic base of Indore has changed \nconsiderably.  The city holds a dominant position in wholesale trading and as a transshipment \ncenter for the surrounding regions.  Trade and commerce, the financial sector, and new higher \ntech companies have come to replace the older industries. \n \n4.  Jabalpur is the third largest city in the state.  Located east of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur \nlies within the East-West corridor.  It is on the main rail route from Allahabad to Mumbai and the \ndivisional headquarters of the central railway are located here.  Jabalpur has a public-sector-\ndominated economic base.  Four large defense industries and many state capital type functions \nincluding  the  High  Court,  State  Electricity  Board,  and  Department  of  Telecommunications \ntraining institute are located in the city.  The Jabalpur region boasts large mineral reserves and \nmining  is  a  well-established  activity.    The  area  is  also  one  of  natural  beauty  with  many \necotourism type attractions within reach of the city. \n \n5.  Ratlam is the smallest of the project cities and still retains its rural character.  Like \nGwalior, it originated as the capital of a princely state.  Ratlam is located in the East-West \ncorridor, on the main Delhi-Mumbai highway and railroad.  The city has grown as an important \nrailway junction on the Delhi-Mumbai line and as a service city for the surrounding hinterland for \nwholesale trading in agriculture commodities and other agriculture-related activities.  Railway \nemployees  constitute  the  majority  of  the  workforce  (around  19,000)  and,  together  with \ngovernment employees and their families, account for about half the city population.  Recent \nyears have seen the closure of an estimated 80% of industry, including the only large factory \n(soya bean), and most medium-size units in the city.  In contrast to the fortunes of agriculture-\nrelated activity, Ratlam is famous for its manufacture of golden ornaments and jewelry and \n ", "  Appendix 3  27 \nthese activities appear to be thriving.  Service-related activities for the local population and \ntransport-related activity are the mainstays of the city\u2019s economy. \n \n6.  Ujjain, once the seat of the ancient kingdom of Vikramaditya, is an important religious, \neducational, and cultural center and a destination of millions of Hindu pilgrims.  Besides regular \nvisitors (about 200,000-300,000 per year), once every 12 years there is a flood of devotees to \nthe city (an estimated 5 million in 2004).  About an hour by road from Indore, the city, once \nimportant for cotton manufacture, has suffered considerable decline.  All four of the cotton mills \nclosed over 10 years ago and there is little alternative for the 7,000 strong workforce retrenched.  \nReligious tourism, services for the local population, and some small-scale industries including \npower and hand looms and packaging are the mainstays of the city\u2019s economy. \n \n \n \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN SECTOR \n \nProject  Year  Source   Amount  \nApproved   ($ million) \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a National Priority  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in  Not \nin Country Poverty Analysis?    Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?    available \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Madhya Pradesh:  \nThe Asian Development Bank's (ADB) poverty reduction strategy defines poverty as a deprivation of essential assets to \nwhich every human is entitled. The strategy includes access to water, sanitation, and other basic services, as well as \nemployment income and wages, as measures of poverty.  The assessment of the prevailing situation in India, Madhya \nPradesh, and the project cities has revealed the poor quality of the urban environment infrastructure and a demonstrable \ngap in the provision of basic services, to the poor in particular. \n \nThe Project will address deficiencies of basic needs citywide in an integrated manner. Direct benefits will be sustained \nimprovements in water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management six project cities. Indirect benefits will be \nthrough improved living conditions, a healthier living environment, and the prospect of improved health status of the \npopulation. The poverty impact of the Project  was assessed from the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) \nbaseline socioeconomic survey in terms of benefits and costs, which apply to different groups of the population the six \ncities.  Overall, the survey respondents identified lack of access to a reliable in-house water supply as the foremost \ndeficiency. Although the coverage of the existing water distribution network in the six cities is as high as 85%, water \npressure, and the frequency and duration of supply are extremely poor.  Therefore, benefits of improved efficiency of the \nexisting water supply system will accrue to all existing users, including the poor. In addition, almost 1 million new \nconsumers will gain access to piped water supply by 2010. While the poor households (estimated to be 25% of the total \nurban population) outside slum settlements will be fully integrated into the new expanded water supply system, the \nbenefits to slum settlements will be initially indirect in terms of improved supply at the slum boundaries. For the slum \ndwellers to directly benefit from the Project, additional investments are required to improve tertiary distribution within the \nslum settlements. For instance, the water schemes under the AIF will benefit up to 100,000 slum dwellers, which is \nabout 7% of the total slum population.  \n \nDirect benefits from the sanitation component will be obtained by households that will be able to connect to the \nsewerage network. The network will be in the densely built-up and developing areas of the city center. The percentage of \npoor households in this area is slightly below the citywide average of the poor households (25%). The underground \nsewerage network will, however, reach the boundaries of slum areas within the scheme area and this will enable the \nprovision of sewered community latrines that will benefit an estimated 4% of the poor households. The solid waste \ncomponent will operate citywide with little difference in the standard of service within cities. The proportion of the poor \nbeneficiaries is therefore the same for each city as a whole.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nIndia\u2019s urban population of about 285 million is expected to almost double to 550 million over the next 20 years, an \naverage addition of more than 11 million new urban residents each year. The incidence of poverty in India remains high \nalthough both the absolute numbers and proportion of people living below the poverty line are falling. The proportion of \nthe total population living below the poverty line in 2001 is estimated at 26% or a population of 268 million. In urban \nareas, the population below the poverty line is estimated at 24%, or about 67 million, slightly better than in rural areas. \n \nIn Madhya Pradesh, the estimated urban population below the poverty line was 38% in 2000, much higher than the \nnational average of 24%.  Urban poverty, however, dropped faster than rural poverty between 1994 (44%) and 2000 \nand, as a result, the incidence of poverty is now lower in urban areas than in rural villages, where 44% of the population \nstill live below the poverty line. Among the urban poor, the slum population, counted for the first time during the 2001 \nCensus, totaled more than 2.3 million, representing 24% of the urban population, which is slightly higher than the \nnational average of 21%.  \n \nOther than these primary data published by the Central Government, there is very little state-level data that can support \nan analysis of vulnerability among the urban poor. Almost no secondary data exist, which can permit an analysis of other \ndimensions of urban poverty, particularly health, social capital, and gender disparity. To fill up such data gap, a baseline \nsocioeconomic  survey  covering  a  total  of  9,600  households  was  undertaken  during  the  TA.  The  survey  was \ncomplemented by a series of participatory exercises including participatory rapid appraisal, focus group discussions, and \nmunicipal workshops. \nThe social and poverty analysis using the survey data has shown widespread deficiencies in basic urban services \nacross the six cities. On average, 42.3% of households do not have an in-house water connection and 15.1% do not \nhave access to piped water; over 40% receive water only on alternate days; 18.8% do not have a private toilet and \nmembers of one in eight households defecate outdoors; 32% report flooding problems and 40% are not served by \ncollection of solid waste. As a result, the potential for waterborne and bacterial diseases is high, particularly among \nchildren. Last year,14.6% of the households reported an incidence of diarrhea in the family.  \n ", "40  Appendix 10 \nchildren. Last year,14.6% of the households reported an incidence of diarrhea in the family.  \nOn almost all measures, poor households in the six cities fare less well than average. Furthermore core poor \nhouseholds (those living much below the poverty level) fare very much worse. For example, the percentage of poor \nhouseholds whose members defecate outdoors rose from 30% to over 50% of core poor households. The incidence of \ndiarrhea is generally higher among the poor, rising to one third of core poor households in Bhopal and one half in \nJabalpur. Income levels of households below the poverty level are between one fifth and a third of nonpoor incomes. \nNonpoor households spend around 75% of their monthly incomes, households below the poverty level around 90%, and \ncore poor households over 100%. Common contributory factors are high dependency, informal employment, poor health \nleading to low incomes, low savings, high indebtedness, poor living conditions with low access to good shelter and basic \nurban services. \nBenefits to poor  Gender benefits \nPhysical Infrastructure \nPoor people will have better access to quality urban  Women's  role  in  project  design  and  implementation  will \nservices  (water  supply,  sewage  and  sanitation,  increase as indicated in Gender Action Plan. \ngarbage  collection  and  drainage  system)  in   \nunderserved and previously unserved areas.

Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared  Yes \nThe consultative process covered three main stakeholder groups: governments, residential communities, and business \ncommunity.  Governments  include  the  city  governments,  state  departments,  and  political  leaders.  Residential \ncommunities were consulted through rapid participatory appraisal and a socioeconomic survey. The survey was \nundertaken in two parts: the first covered 10,000 households in the six project cities and collected baseline information \nincluding perceptions and delivery of urban services; the second covered 2,400 households in the six cities and focused \non consumer behavior and attitudes to ward the proposed projects and willingness to pay. Focus group discussions \nwere also held with citywide stakeholders.  The business community was consulted through chambers of trade and \nleading representatives of businesses, relevant government departments including the District Industry Department and \nAKVN (the government agency for industrial parks and economic zones). Visits to cities and out-of-city industrial sites \nwere also made. With the help of the Chamber of Indian Industry (CII), a business consultation survey was undertaken \nincluding group consultations. Finally, individual surveys of 300 enterprises were carried out covering private and public \nsector services. \nParticipation Strategy  Yes \nPublic consultation/participation has been a feature of the project design thus far, and this will continue through detailed \ndesign, and, where possible, planning, implementation, operation, and maintenance. A major feature of the capacity-\nbuilding components is to enable the corporations to adopt a more participatory approach to urban development. This \nwill commence with detailed planning, design, and implementation of the Project. Support to the implementation \narrangements  includes  provision  for  social  and  community  development  experts  within  the  PMO  and  project \nimplementation units and for nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to conduct community awareness programs (i) to \nexplain the project activities; (ii) to serve as ongoing consultation mechanism, particularly with regard to service charges \nand fees; (iii) to launch community education programs on health and hygiene and water use management; and (iv) \n ", "  Appendix 10  41   \nand fees; (iii) to launch community education programs on health and hygiene and water use management; and (iv) \nprovide a liaison channel allowing communication on concerns and complaints on any issues arising during construction, \nsuch as disruption or damage.  Ongoing consultation and participatory monitoring will help ensure that project elements \nmeet the needs of the community, contributing to their sustainability. The consultations can take the form of annual \nsurveys by consumer category, combined with community forums or focus group discussions. Media for public \ninformation mechanisms will include local television, radio, newsletters, web sites, and community meetings.  \nD.

Introduction \n \n1.  The economic analysis1 examines the economic viability of the Project, following the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines:  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial \nAppraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects,  Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of \nProjects, and Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. The analysis also \ndraws  on  the  socioeconomic  survey  carried  out  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (TA) and other available secondary data. The basic assumptions follow: (i) capital \nand operation and maintenance (O&M) costs were apportioned into traded and nontraded \ncomponents and labor; (ii) using the domestic price numeraire, financial prices as reduced by \nduties and taxes were converted to economic prices by a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 for \nthe traded-cost component and 1.0 for the nontraded cost component; (iii) a conversion factor of \n0.75 is used for the cost of unskilled labor to reflect the real market value of labor, based on the \nrelationship between the regulatory minimum wage and reported actual rates received by \nunskilled workers; (iv) the conversion factor for power is assumed to be 1.7, based on the \nestimated economic price of high tension power in Madhya Pradesh\u2014Rs5.0/kilowatt (kW)\u2014  \nand the unit price of Rs2.9/kW assumed in the financial cost estimation; and (v) O&M costs are \nsplit into fixed and variable costs.   \n \n2.  Consideration of alternatives and preference for least-cost solutions are one of the main \ndesign  principles  of  the  Project.  Assessment  covered  a  mix  of  technical,  social,  and \nenvironmental as well as financial considerations.  For the water supply component, alternatives \nincluded (i) groundwater versus surface water\u2014surface water is preferred as Madhya Pradesh \nis semiarid and recharge is not assured; (ii) different water sources\u2014considerations included \ndistance, yield, sustainability, and transmission cost; and (iii) water treatment processes\u2014rapid \nsand filter is preferred to slow sand filtration. In all cases the most technically appropriate and \nleast-cost solution was selected.  \n \n3.  For  the  sewerage/sanitation  component,  alternatives  considered  for  the  proposed \nreticulated systems included combined versus separate systems; network choices of pumping \nversus gravity, size of pipe and routing; and larger geographic areas.  Separate systems and \nnetwork choices of gravity were selected primarily due to lower cost.  For sewage treatment \nplants,  alternative  processes  and  sites  were  considered.    Waste  stabilization  ponds  were \nchosen on grounds of the least capital requirement and operational costs although the land \nrequirement is higher.  \n \n4.  Alternative  processes  for  municipal  waste  disposal  were  considered  based  on  the \nanalysis of composition in each city. The processes included incineration, turning waste to \nenergy, composting, and sanitary landfill.  The composition of the waste stream in the project \ncities is not appropriate for direct incineration or waste-to-energy schemes as it has a low \ncarbon and combustible quality and the moisture content is too high, especially in the monsoon \nseason.  Composting is feasible but requires the segregation of appropriate organic sources of \nwaste material, preferably at source, plus the development of a market for the final product.  As \nwaste collection processes improve under the Project, composition is likely to change, but a \nsanitary landfill is the only technical and economically viable option in the near future. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 Further details are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n ", "  Appendix 11  43 \nB.  Water Supply \n \n1.  Demand for Water \n \n5.  In the cities of Madhya Pradesh, as in many other cities in India, the very concept of \ndemand is not well understood because consumption is determined through supply constraints \nand not by demand management.  Most of all, water supply is available for at best a few hours a \nday, and at worst, less than once a day on alternate days during the dry season.  There is no \nresidential metering, users pay a fixed charge and a very high proportion of them do not pay. \nWhat is worse, there are thousands of illegal connections for which no charge is levied, but \nthere is no information about the actual number of those connections. Unfortunately, no cities in \nIndia, have recently undergone improvements to the water supply system similar to those \nproposed under the Project.  Data from other large cities show rather high water consumption:  \nCalcutta (202 liters per capita per day [lpcd]), Delhi (209 lpcd), and Mumbai (178 lpcd).  \n \n6.  The Government\u2019s guidelines on minimum standards for the design of water supply \nnetworks includes 135 lpcd in large cities where sewerage is planned and 70 lpcd without a \nsewerage network. While these figures are obviously not an estimate of demand, they reflect an \nunderstanding of consumption patterns in India, as well as guidelines on health and sanitation \nstandards.  For  economic  analysis,  the  following  assumptions  were  made  based  on  the \nsocioeconomic survey carried out under the TA2 and the volume of water required for health and \nsanitation purposes: (i) for 2003, 100 lpcd for in-house connections and 75 lpcd for stand posts; \n(ii) for those with no piped water supply, a minimum of 40 lpcd throughout the project period; (iii) \nincome elasticity of 0.5 and price elasticity of \u20130.23; and (iii) real income increases of 2% per \nyear. Under these assumptions, the demand for water by 2021 is estimated at 147 lpcd.  \n \n  2.  Economic Benefits and Valuation \n \n7.  Contingent  valuation  was  used  in  assessing  economic  benefits.  It  involves  asking \nrespondents how much they would be willing to pay for a set of circumstances. The main \ndrawback of this technique is that, for the results to be meaningful, respondents need to have a \ngood perception of the without-Project situation so that their responses address the actual \nimpact of the Project. The reality is that this method may seriously underestimate economic \nbenefits since it uses unit rate for incremental water that does not fully take into account the \nwithout-Project situation.  The incremental benefit of providing enough water to avoid a water \ncrisis and ensure economic survival is much higher than is reflected by the simple willingness to \npay revealed by individual households.   \n \n8.  The main difficulty associated with economic analysis was lack of data as to how much \nwater actually reaches consumers or even how much is produced. There is no concept of \nmetering or water volumes at the household level. Notwithstanding these difficulties, economic \nanalysis considers the period 2003\u20132021 for without-Project, optimization only, and with-Project \nsituations. It gives estimates of incremental and nonincremental water based on engineering \ninformation  as  well  as  the  socioeconomic  survey,  and  calculates  incremental  and \nnonincremental volumes for new and current customers.    \n                                                 \n2 The survey covered current consumption, consumer behavior with respect to water consumption, and attitudes \ntoward the proposed Project. For water consumption, households were asked to estimate their consumption for 12 \ndifferent water use activities. The results show a relatively low level of current consumption\u2014around 60 lpcd. \nSatisfaction with the current supply is surprisingly high, given the poor availability of water; this may reflect the low \nexpectation and general acceptance that current service is as good as can be expected. \n3  Given that during the early years of the Project, the majority of the consumers will be switching to either a metered \nsupply from a stand post or a fixed charge, price elasticity is not incorporated until after 2010. \n ", "44  Appendix 11 \n \n9.  Table A11.1 summarizes the economic internal rate o return (EIRRs) for the water \nsupply component.  For the Project to be viable, the EIRR should exceed the Economic \nOpportunity Cost of Capital.  All six water projects are shown to be viable.  Five of the EIRRs \nare particularly robust.  Under sensitivity tests, the EIRR in Indore slips below the 12% hurdle \nrate.  Unlike in other cities, the EIRR in Indore is sensitive to increase in O&M costs. This is due \nto the high cost of electricity to pump raw water from the intake to almost 600 meters to the \ntreatment plant. Reducing in nontechnical losses is also essential to make the project viable in \nIndore.  \n \n10.  In interpreting the outcomes of economic analysis for Indore, it is worth noting that the \nwithout-Project situation is not fully reflected in the valuation of benefits; as a result the benefits, \nparticularly the indirect benefits, are likely to be undervalued.  In particular, the contingent \nvaluation method based on the measure of willingness to pay does not quantify the benefit of \nproviding necessary water to avoid a crisis and ensure the economic survival of the city. Without \nthe proposed optimization under the Project, however, the nonrevenue water rate will go up to \nas high as 70% by 2010 and the water supply will fall below 40 lpcd. This signals the onset of a \nwater crisis and Indore will no longer be able to function as a trading and industrial capital of the \nstate. The economic, social, and poverty impact would be very severe indeed. For this reason, \nunder sensitivity tests, the EIRR of the Indore water supply scheme is estimated to be as high \nas 16.5% if the benefit of avoiding a water crisis is taken into account4.  \n \nTable A11.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return for Water Supply (%) \n \nCity  EIRR/SV  Base Case  Capital  O&M  No Reduction in    Benefits \nCost  Cost  Nontechnical Losses  Delayed         \n(+10%)  (+10%)  by 1 Year \nEIRR    51.2  56.3 \nBhopal  56.5  31.6  39.2 \nSV  84.0  >100 \nEIRR    28.3  30.6 \nGwalior  30.6  25.4  24.8 \nSV  80.0  >100 \nEIRR    11.7  11.5 \nIndore  13.3  11.8  8.3 \nSV  8.0  7.2 \nEIRR    60.7  66.1 \nJabalpur  66.4  59.8  45.7 \nSV  95.0  >100 \nEIRR    36.2  39.6 \nRatlam  39.8  36.3  30.0 \nSV  77.0  >100 \nEIRR    26.9  28.4 \nUjjain  28.6  21.4  23.7 \nSV  97.0  >100 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; O&M = operation and maintenance; SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.  Sewerage and Sanitation \n \n11.  The benefits of the sewerage and sanitation components are primarily public health and \nenvironmental improvement.  There are direct impacts through improvements in providing the \nservice provision but, as with water, there are considerable indirect impacts that result from \nimprovement  in  the  living  conditions  of  the  population  and  the  overall  urban  environment. \nSewerage  and  sanitation  components  have  been  valued  using  the  willingness  to  pay  of \nresidential households and businesses.  \n \n                                                 \n4 A multiplication factor of 1.2 is applied to quantify the benefit of avoiding a water crisis. \n ", "  Appendix 11  45 \n12.  The  estimated  EIRRs  (Table  A11.2)  of  the  sewerage/sanitation  component  are \nacceptable except in Gwalior and Jabalpur. However, the EIRR calculation does not quantify \nconsiderable indirect benefits. Furthermore, the proposed sewerage/sanitation component can \nbe justified on the least-cost basis, and lack of technically feasible alternatives. \n \nTable A11.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return for Sewerage and Sanitation (%) \nCity  EIRR/SV  Base  Capital Cost  O&M Cost  Willingness to  Benefits \nCase  (+10%)  (+10%)  Pay (-10%)  Delayed         \nby 1 Year \nBhopal  EIRR    18.8  17.3  18.3  16.6  15.2 \nSV   55  60  28 \nGwalior  EIRR    7.9  6.8  7.7  6.4  6.2 \nSV  (28)   >(100)  (30) \nIndore  EIRR    27.8  25.8  27.6  25.4  22.9 \nSV  >100  >100  56 \nJabalpur  EIRR    9.1  7.9  8.8  7.6  7.2 \nSV  (20)  >(100)  (22) \nRatlam  EIRR    31.8  29.5  31.7  29.2  25.9 \nSV  >100  >100  58 \nUjjain  EIRR    13.9  12.6  13.0  11.6  10.6 \nSV  15  21  8 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; O&M = operation and maintenance; SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Solid Waste Management \n \n13.  Contingent valuation (or willingness to pay) was used to provide an economic value to a \nnonquantifiable set of environmental and public health benefits.  Residential  and  business \nsurveys  showed  that  people  were  concerned  about  the  quality  of  the  urban  environment \nresulting from poor solid waste management.   Across all cities, 71% of the respondents said \nthey were willing to pay for improvements to solid waste management.  Results also showed \nthat the willingness to pay of the poorest 20% was often higher than that of the higher income \ncategories.  This reflects what the poor expressed during the focus group discussions. The poor \nrated solid waste management high in their priority needs, most likely because they are the \nones that suffer the direct consequences of lack of good service. \n \n14.  For  most  of  the  solid  waste  components,  the  EIRR  exceeds  the  12%  economic \nopportunity cost of capital (Table A11.3).

Introduction \n \n1.  Financial internal rates of return (FIRR) were determined in accordance with ADB's \nFramework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. \nFinancial analysis was conducted to assess the financial viability of the revenue-generating \ncomponents of the Project, water supply, sewerage, and solid waste management\u2014following \nADB's Guidelines for the Financial Analysis of Projects. The main objective of evaluation was to \ndetermine the financial feasibility of the selected components in the project city corporations, \nincluding cost recovery.      \n \nB.  Assumptions Used in Financial Projections  \n \n2.  Financial projections prepared for the project cities comprise projected receipts and \nexpenditures in rupees, expressed in current prices incorporating the projected general inflation \nover the forecast period. The financial projections, presented based on a fiscal year ending 31 \nMarch, include receipts generated from all locally applied taxes, such as the property tax, all \nnontax receipts such as water charges and income from municipal properties, and all regular \ntransfers from the state government of Madhya Pradesh. Expenditures include all recurrent \nexpenditures.  \n \n1.  Property Tax \n \n3.  Under a new method of levying property tax introduced in 1997, all urban local bodies \nswitched to a zonal area-linked system involving self-assessment of annual rental values by the \nassessees. In general, all project cities had set the zonal rates at a very low level. A large \nnumber of properties are still out of the tax net and the current collection efficiency, except in \nBhopal, is low. Under part B of the Project, the project cities in conjunction with the state \ngovernment will implement property tax reforms that will build on the expected improvements \nwith computerization of the master files and collection procedures. The cities are committed to \nrationalize the tax rate structure and simultaneously increase tax collection efficiency. \n \n4.  The measures implicit in the assumptions used for the financial analysis follow: (i) up to \n75% of the properties will be subjected to a property tax by FY2008; (ii) effective 1 April 2004, \nthe current low property tax rates will be increased by 100% in Bhopal, 200% in Gwalior, 50% in \nIndore, 150% in Jabalpur, 75% in Ratlam, and 200% in Ujjain; (iii) the property tax rates will be \nreviewed every 4 years and increased by a minimum of 20%; and (iv) by FY2009, overall \ncollection efficiency (current and arrear demands) will have been 75%.  \n \n2.  Compensation, Tax Sharing, and Subsidy \n \n5.  A significant portion of revenues consists of devolution and transfers from the state \ngovernment. They include compensation for abolishing octroi and assigned revenue under the \nState Finance Commission (SFC) recommendations. In the past, the government did not fully \naccept the SFC recommendations but shared a part of the state\u2019s tax and nontax revenue with \nthe municipalities. A second SFC has been constituted and its report will be available soon.  \n \n3.  Direct Cost Recovery  \n \n6.  The essence of the Government policies and plans for the urban sector is to aim at full \ncost  recovery  for  urban  water  supply  through  direct  user  charges,  and  for  solid  waste \n ", "  Appendix 13  49 \nmanagement through an indirect tax such as the property tax. The current financial position of \nthe project cities is inadequate to continue system improvement and increase service coverage. \nOne of the important objectives of the Project is to assist project cities to improve generation of \nrevenues  from  own  sources  and  to  ensure  that  the  administration  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of both existing and project assets can be adequately covered.  \n \na.  Water Charges \n \n7.  Under the Project all existing unmetered water connections will be metered, the cost for \nwhich is included in the cost estimates. In the future, only metered water connections will be \nprovided. The cost of the water meter and connecting to the main supply line will be borne by \nthe beneficiaries, which, depending upon the distance, would be less than Rs2,000. \n \n8.  As part of the financial improvement action plan, the present low monthly charges for un-\nmetered  water  connections  will  be  raised  in  FY2004  (Appendix  12).  Concurrent  with  the \nmetering, a volumetric charge based on a block tariff will be introduced so that consumers can \npay according to their water use. As an incentive for metering and to save water that may be \ndirected to other needy consumers, and considering affordability to the consumers, a three-tier \ndomestic  tariff  has  been  proposed  under  which  the  first  block  representing  the  lifeline \nconsumption of up to 10 cubic meters (m3) will be charged an affordable rate for all income \ngroups. The next block of 10 m3 will be charged one and half times over the lifeline tariff, \nrepresenting ordinary tariff. All consumption over 20 m3 will be charged twice the lifeline tariff. \nThe commercial and industrial tariff will be set at two and three times of the domestic lifeline \ntariff. Households that may not be able to realize the benefit of in-house connections and use \nstand posts to meet their water demands will be charged a concessional tariff restricted to 60% \nof the domestic lifeline tariff. The cross-subsidization among the users is evident. \n \n9.  Upon full implementation of the water supply schemes, a capital recovery charge will be \nintroduced to supplement the funds required to meet the debt service obligations on the project \nloans. All tariffs will increase yearly in real terms by 1% over local inflation.  \n \nb.  Wastewater (Sewerage) Surcharge  \n \n10.  Upon the completion of the sewerage schemes, a wastewater (sewerage) surcharge will \nbe introduced for households that are connected to the sewerage system. The surcharge \nincluded in the water bill will be 30% in Bhopal, 40% in Gwalior, 25% in Indore, 40% in Jabalpur, \nand 25% in Ujjain. The Project will provide the main sewerage collection system including \nroadside inspection chambers for house laterals and connections. The households will meet the \ncost of connecting to the nearest inspection chamber, which, depending on the location of the \nhouse,  will  be  about  Rs2,000.  No  affordability  problems  are  foreseen  for  most  of  the \nhouseholds. However, in the case of low-income households desiring to connect to the system, \nthe project cities will initially shoulder this cost and recover it over 12 months. \n \n \nc.  Solid Waste Management Fees \n \n11.  Presently, no direct charges are levied for solid waste collection and disposal. Beginning \nApril 2006 when the waste collection and disposal system will become operative, a monthly \ncharge  of  Rs10  will  be  recovered  from  all  households  assessed  for  property  taxation. \nCommercial  establishments  will  be  charged  twice  the  domestic  rate.  Under  current  laws, \nundertakings generating hazardous waste are required to ensure treatment and disposal of the \nwaste as per the prescribed guidelines. The State Pollution Control Board monitors compliance.  \n ", "50  Appendix 13 \n \nC.  Financial Internal Rates of Return \n \n12.  Financial  analysis  was  undertaken  for  revenue-generating  components,  i.e.,  water \nsupply, sewerage and solid waste management. Basic assumptions in computing the FIRR \nfollow: (i) all revenues and costs are expressed in constant prices on an incremental basis; (ii) \ncapital expenditures include all costs, less taxes and duties and price contingencies; (iii) capital \nexpenditures are recorded at the time they are incurred, while interest and finance charges are \nexcluded; (iv) equipment replacement costs are estimated every 15 years in the water supply \nand sewerage schemes, and 5 and 10 years in the solid waste management schemes; and (v) \nincremental operating costs are calculated by subtracting the existing system\u2019s operating costs \nfrom the projected operating costs for the whole system at project completion. The value of \nbenefits arising from water sales was calculated by multiplying the volume of water sold each \nyear by the proposed tariffs used for each year in constant prices, with an annual increase of \n1% in real terms. For sewerage, the estimated cash flows were based on the proposed \nwastewater surcharge on water bills. Benefits and costs were kept constant after FY2021 when \nall facilities would be operating at near full capacity and present design demands would be fully \nsatisfied. \n \n13.  The FIRRs, which are the discount rates that equalize the present value of costs and \nrevenues over the project life, were calculated and sensitivity analyses carried out using the \nfollowing key variables: (i) 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) 10% increase in O&M costs, (iii) \n10% decrease in revenue, and (iv) benefits delayed by 1-year. For discounting the net financial \nbenefits to arrive at the net present value, the weighted average cost of capital was adjusted for \nthe inflation rate. The weighted average cost of capital assumed was 4%. \n \n14.  The FIRRs for water supply schemes vary between 18.5% and 5.2%. The wide variation \nis due to the nature of the scheme, distance from source, service coverage, and O&M costs. \nThe FIRRs for sewerage schemes are low due to high investment and O&M costs. Combined \nFIRRs for water supply and sewerage are all above the weighted average cost of capital. The \nFIRRs for solid waste management is between 15.3% and 0.4%. Sensitivity tests indicate that \nthe FIRRs are sensitive to decrease in revenues and delaying project benefits by 1 year. The \nFIRRs with the associated sensitivity tests are summarized in Table A13.1. An additional \nsensitivity analysis was conducted for water supply (Table A13.2) to analyze the impact of the \nnonrevenue water rate. Under the assumption that the original targets for nonrevenue water are \nmissed by 20% for 2009 and 25% for 2021, the FIRRs remain sound except for Ratlam. \n \nTable A13.1: Financial Internal Rates of Return (%) \n \n    Base  Capital  O&M  Benefits  Benefits \n    Case  Costs  Costs  -10%  Delayed \nCity  Component  +10%  +10%  by 1 year \nBhopal  Water Supply  11.3  11.0  11.0  9.9  9.8 \n  Sewerage  5.2  4.4  4.6  3.7  4.2 \nWater Supply and \n  Sewerage  10.2  9.7  9.9  8.8  8.8 \nSolid Waste \n  Management  4.7  2.9  3.1  0.8  2.6 \nGwalior  Water Supply  17.7  16.3  17.5  16.0  15.2 \n  Sewerage  1.6  0.9  1.0  (Neg.)  0.8 \nWater Supply and \n  Sewerage  11.3  10.3  11.0  9.8  9.7 \nSolid Waste \n  Management  6.8  5.5  5.6  4.4  5.1 \n ", "  Appendix 13  51 \n    Base  Capital  O&M  Benefits  Benefits \n    Case  Costs  Costs  -10%  Delayed \nCity  Component  +10%  +10%  by 1 year \nIndore  Water Supply  5.6  4.5  3.7  2.4  3.5 \n  Sewerage  1.2  0.6  0.7  0.0  0.5 \nWater Supply and \n  Sewerage  4.9  4.0  3.2  2.0  3.1 \nSolid Waste \n  Management  15.3  13.9  14.3  12.5  12.0 \nJabalpur  Water Supply  18.5  17.1  18.1  16.6  15.7 \n  Sewerage  4.8  4.1  4.6  3.8  4.0 \nWater Supply and \n  Sewerage  13.4  12.3  13.1  11.9  11.6 \nSolid Waste \n  Management  2.8  0.9  1.0  (1.5)  0.9 \nRatlam  Water Supply  5.2  4.4  4.9  4.0  4.3 \nSolid Waste \n  Management  4.7  3.3  3.3  1.5  2.9 \nUjjain  Water Supply  6.6  5.9  6.5  5.7  5.9 \n  Sewerage  1.5  0.9  0.6  (0.1)  0.6 \nWater Supply and \n  Sewerage  5.7  5.1  5.5  4.7  5.0 \nSolid Waste \n  Management  0.4  (1.1)  (1.0)  (0.1)  (0.8) \nO&M = operation & maintenance \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nTable A13.2: Additional Sensitivity Analysis for Water Supply \n \n  Nonrevenue Water Rate (%) \n  Base Case  Sensitivity Analysis \nCity  2003  2009  2021  FIRR (%)  2009  2021  FIRR (%) \nBhopal  59.7  25  20  11.3  30  25  10.0 \nGwalior  54.4  25  20  17.7  30  25  15.5 \nIndore  52.0  25  20  5.6  30  25  4.2 \nJabalpur  39.3  25  20  18.5  30  25  16.3 \nRatlam  37.5  25  20  5.2  30  25  3.0 \nUjjain  49.2  25  20  6.6  30  25  4.9 \nFIRR = financial internal rates of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Average Incremental Financial Cost  \n \n15.  The average incremental cost of water supply was calculated to determine the financial \ntariffs to be set for full cost recovery over the assumed project life. Discounting is done at the \nweighted average cost of capital of 4%, which is used as a proxy for Financial Opportunity Cost \nof Capital. The average Incremental financial cost vary between Rs6.5/m3 and Rs12.7/m3. The \naverage recovery from domestic users is between 46% and 80%. Cost recovery is between \n38% and 67% in the lifeline consumption block, between 57% and 100% in the next block, and \nbetween 76% and 133% in the final block. Cost recovery from commercial users is between \n87% and 164%, and that from industrial users between 128% and 205%. The stand post users, \nhowever, are expected to pay only between 23% and 40%.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nE.  Affordability to Beneficiaries \n \n1.  Willingness to Pay \n \n16.  The socioeconomic survey results show that there was willingness both to have piped \nwater connections and to pay for them. However, the willingness to pay for the piped water \nsupply was generally low among the households. Perhaps this is the result of the present low \nlevel of water supply and low water tariffs. Nearly 80% of the households were willing to pay a \nmonthly fixed charge of Rs100 for improved water supply, while 13% were willing to spend up to \nRs200; the remaining households were willing to spend only below Rs100. Similarly, when \nasked about their willingness to pay for an improved in-house metered water connection, 78% \nwere ready to pay Rs100 per month. Willingness to pay Rs200 was recorded for 18%. Only 2% \nwere willing to pay Rs300. The mean average for all the cities was Rs125 per month.  \n \n2.  Affordability Analysis \n \n17.  Applying the proposed water charges and wastewater surcharge with expected water \nconsumption, the percentage of average monthly expenditure on water and sewerage was \nassessed with reference to household incomes. Water tariffs are observed to be within the \ngenerally accepted expenditure level of 3-4% of the median monthly household income.  In \ncombination with sewerage charges, the average monthly household expenditure is 4-5%. No \naffordability problems are foreseen for the 20% households as they are likely to consume less \nthan the average town water consumption, or will alternatively be dependent on the stand post \nsupplies. However, as most of the households lie above the median income level, affordability is \nnot a constraint.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  53 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION1 \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken as part of the Urban Water \nSupply and Environmental Improvement Project in Madhya Pradesh to ascertain the Project's \nimpact  on  the  environment  and  to  identify  measures  to  prevent  or  mitigate  any  adverse \nenvironmental impacts that could arise from its implementation.  \n \n2.  The Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d Project in accordance with Asian Development \nBank's (ADB) Guidelines on Environmental Assessment. All subcomponents aim to improve the \nquality and security of water supply, sanitation, and waste  disposal. IEEs carried out for all \nsubcomponents showed no significant environmental effect. Project activities that may have a \nmarginally significant effect, and the main mitigation measures proposed are summarized here.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n3.  The major cities of Madhya Pradesh are lagging behind comparable cities elsewhere in \nIndia, in the level and quality of basic infrastructure and services. Fundamental needs such as a \nreliable water supply, adequate sewerage and sanitation, and effective means for collecting and \ndisposing of solid waste are not satisfied. The Project is designed to enhance the minimum \nprerequisites for economic development and contribute urban poverty reduction and improved \nhealth and hygiene. The details of the Project are in the main text of the report. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n4.  The Project covers the six larger urban centers (Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, \nRatlam, and Ujain) of the state of Madhya Pradesh, with populations from 250,000 to 1.5 million. \nThe cities are centers of administration, commerce, and industry, with environmental problems \nsimilar to those affecting most large cities in the subcontinent: (i) lack of continuous and reliable \nwater supply; (ii) lack of an adequate network for disposing of storm water or wastewater; and \n(iii)  general  widespread  pollution  caused  by  improper  disposal  of  human,  domestic,  and \nindustrial waste. Provision of basic services is particularly deficient in the slum areas, and other \ninformal residential areas without planned essential infrastructure throughout the project cities.  \n \n5.  The state of Madhya Pradesh has many forests, especially in the Vindhya-Kaimar, the \nSatpura and Maikala ranges, and the Baghelkhand plateau. Wildlife sanctuaries are at Kanha, \nShivpuri,  Bandhavgarh  and  Rewa.  There  are  no  fisheries,  wildlife,  forest,  and  rare  or \nendangered species in or around the project cities. Land areas for the proposed water supply, \nsewage treatment facilities, and waste disposal facilities have been developed or disturbed \npreviously and have no forest or unusual vegetation cover.  \n \n6.  There are no known sites of historical or cultural significance in the areas that are likely \nto be affected during project implementation. In the detailed investigation and design of water \nand sanitation works, particular care will be taken to identify historical and cultural sites, and \nappropriate steps taken to protect them. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 Sample of IEE for Bhopal is in Supplementary Appendix L. \n ", "54  Appendix 14 \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n7.  The  IEEs  review  for  all  proposed  components  potential  environmental  problems \nassociated with location, design, construction stage, and operation. \n \n1.   Location \n \n8.  The  majority  of  the  project  civil  works  will  consist  of  environmental  infrastructure, \nessentially road-based  infrastructure  located  within  or  along  the  existing  road  right-of-way. \nPermission will be obtained from relevant authorities to dig up the roads and divert traffic \ntemporarily. New or expanded water treatment plants will be built on the same sites as the \nexisting plants, on the same plots. The location for new overhead reservoirs for local distribution \nwill be chosen in collaboration with the communities that will benefit from the reservoirs. These \nwill be accommodated on government land (about 1,000 square meters) used by institutions \nsuch as parks, schools, hospitals, and Government offices.  \n \n9.  Sewage treatment facilities (STF) (stabilization pond system) will require 50-70 hectares \n(ha). The STFs are located either on existing plant premises or on vacant and barren land \nowned  by  the  Government  and  passed  on  to  the  municipal  corporations.  The  nearest \nhabitations are 500-1,000 meters (m) away. In Jabalpur, the construction of the STF will involve \nthe acquisition of nonirrigated land and will also affect a few irrigation units and temporary \nstructures. A short resettlement plan has been prepared in consultation with the affected \nhouseholds.  \n \n10.  The existing landfills in the six cities are nearing capacity and will be decommissioned \nwithin the next year. New sites for sanitary landfills have been carefully identified, away from the \ncity centers and surface water sources. The land is barren and there are no scavengers. The \nland in most of the cities belongs to the corporation. Needed land that it belongs to the state \ngovernment is in the process of being transferred to the corporations. Groundwater pollution by \nleachate will be eliminated through proper leachate management. The sites are located 500-\n1000 m away from the nearest isolated households. Any settlement 500 m or less from the sites \nwill be shielded by vegetation. The location of the waste disposal containers (1 cubic meter [m3] \nand 4.5 m3) in the cities will be determined on a case-by-case basis during implementation, with \nthe involvement of communities and affected households and based on a detailed ward-by-ward \nstreet map and a solid waste management master plan. In the case of Indore, the site for a 25 \nha sanitary landfill has to be confirmed. The identified site is currently in private ownership. Land \nacquisition will be in accordance with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Handbook on \nResettlement (1998). \n \n2.  Design \n \n11.  Designs should aim at keeping all excavation and construction within existing rights-of-\nway to minimize nuisance and disruption to traffic and the adjacent population. The design for \nthe drinking water treatment plant renovation and expansion follows Central Public Health \nEngineering and Environmental Organization guidelines for traditional surface water treatment \nprocesses. An operating license will be obtained from the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) \nbefore operations start. \n \n12.   Wastewater, sullage, and polluted storm water will be carried from the residential areas \nthrough the drainage network, via the largely existing primary channels, to final disposal at the \n ", "  Appendix 14  55 \ntreatment plant or the stream. The proposed improvements will not result in new or intensified \ndrainage problems in other areas. A full combined master plan for sewerage and drainage, \nwhich will include all environmental mitigation measures, will be prepared at the start of the \nproject period as the basis of any design. \n  \n13.  The proposed sewage treatment process using stabilization ponds presents the simplest \nform of wastewater treatment available, especially for an area where barren land is available \nand power supply unreliable. National Environmental Legislation does not require that an \nenvironmental impact assessment be carried out for sewage treatment plants. Under SPCB \nregulations, an operating license will be obtained during detailed design. To ensure that all \nmitigation measures, and monitoring and evaluation systems are in place a comprehensive \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) will been drawn up before an operating license is \nissued. These detailed EMPs will also be submitted to ADB for review and approval. \n \n14.  The  sanitary  landfill  sites  will  be  designed  according  to  Indian  SWHR-2000. \nGroundwater  will  be  protected  from  pollution  by  leachate  through  the  construction  of  an \nimpermeable layer, with a drainage system designed to collect leachate water for treatment and \ndisposal. Under National Environmental Legislation, no environmental impact assessment is \nrequired for sanitary landfills that do not dispose of medical waste.  SPCB regulations require \nthat  an  operating  license  be  obtained  after  detailed  design  has  been  completed.  A \ncomprehensive EMP will be drawn up to ensure that all mitigation measures are in place before \nSPCB  issues  an  operating  license.  The  exhausted  landfills  will  be  properly  sealed  and \ndecommissioned within 3 months of the operation of the new sites. Hard-surface platforms for \nthe waste disposal containers will be designed to allow efficient and effective cleaning.  \n \n3.  Construction \n \n15.  During construction, there will be some temporary inconveniences and disruption to the \nsurroundings and the environment. Potential environmental issues are siltation and increase in \nrunoff, generation of waste and effluent from construction camps, noise pollution, air pollution \nfrom dust, disturbance of storm water drainage, disruption of access to residential areas, and \nincreased traffic congestion. These issues will be minimized through the development of a \ndetailed EMP for each subcomponent at the detailed design stage. Some mitigation measures \nfollow: (i) the construction area should be restricted to fenced compounds to minimize the area \ndisturbed; (ii) soil erosion control methods should be applied; (iii) construction sites must be \nwatered to reduce dust; (iv) waste management measures should be introduced at construction \nsites and camps; (v) hazardous materials, including chemicals, should be safely stored; (vi) \ngroundwater contact should be minimized during construction; (vii) vegetation disruption should \nbe limited at construction sites and removal of significant habitat vegetation avoided; and (viii) \ndisturbed areas should be returned to previous conditions or unimproved state. All mitigation \nrequirements will be part of the contract document for the contractor; for sensitive areas, a \nperformance  bond  system  might  be  included.  The  project  engineer  will  monitor  the \nenvironmental effects of the construction activities. It is suggested that a local community liaison \ncommittee to serve for the duration of the construction activity be established  \n \n4.  Operations \n \n16.  Operations  of  most  project  components  will  be  a  routine  continuation  of  existing \noperations  in  running  municipal  infrastructure  services.  Structured  and  planned  preventive \nmaintenance programs will be developed for all facilities under the Project. The following issues \nrelated to operations will be highlighted. \n \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \n17.  All sludge generated by the water treatment plants will be treated on site using drying \nbeds. There will be no off-site discharge. The dried sludge will be transferred to the sanitary \nlandfills. To ensure the integrity of the treated water quality, all water storage areas are roofed \nand ventilated, and the system operated to ensure that the distribution system is maintained \nunder pressure. To ensure the health and safety of workers and the public appropriate detailed \ndesign and EMPs will include a safe working environment to international standards, coupled \nwith appropriate training in chemical handling (especially with regard to handling chlorine) and \nmechanical, electrical, and system operations. To ensure safe water  is delivered, effective \nmonitoring of treatment processes, operation and maintenance of procedures, and daily chlorine \nresidual testing will be instituted. Periodic biological oxygen demand (BOD), microbiological, etc. \ntesting of treated water will also be undertaken.  \n \n18.  Wastewater collection, segregation of storm water and sewage treatment will reduce \nthe pollution load on surface waters. Currently, raw sewage is being discharged to surface \nwaters. The discharge of treated water will reduce deterioration in quality of the recipient waters. \nEffluent  from  the  waste  stabilization  ponds  will  be  better  than  the  Government  of  India \nrequirements of 20 BOD and 30 SS plus the added bonus of bacterial kill. It is estimated that the \naverage level of reduction in water pollution loading will be 90%. To monitor the quantity of \nwater of the natural water sources and ensure the sustainability of the catchment areas, \ninformation  will  be  exchanged  with  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Integrated  Water  Resource \nManagement  Strategy  Program.  Sludge  collected  from  septic  tanks  by  vacuum  cleaning \nmachines will be dumped into the receiving chamber located at the sewage treatment facility \nattached to the sludge drying bed together with sludge from the grit chambers for further drying. \nThe residues of the screen chambers will be transferred to the landfill sites. \n \n19.  The corporations will ensure effective operation of waste collection (containers are \nemptied, cleaned, and replaced regularly and reliably) and disposal. Controlling access to the \nsites to prevent unlicensed disposal, compacting and covering waste upon deposition, etc., and \nperiodic (monthly) groundwater quality and leachate quality monitoring at all waste disposal \nsites will be implemented.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n20.  Current  environmental  legislation  puts  the  responsibility  for  protecting  of  the  urban \nenvironment as well as planning and management, with the relevant urban local body (ULB). \nNevertheless under the current municipal acts, this still remains a discretionary function. Active \nenvironmental management of the urban area must remain the responsibility of the ULBs. \nHowever,  it  is  recognized  that  the  present  performance  of  the  ULBs  in  environmental \nmanagement is inadequate. The Project will support change in the municipal acts to ensure that \nULBs take on the responsibilities and exercise their function as environmental monitors for \nurban infrastructure. Adequate training for these competencies and strengthened capacity will \nbe provided.  \n \n21.  The ULBs, together with the respective corporations, will be required to commission a \ndetailed EMP for each project component. Implementing of mitigation measures to protect the \nenvironment before construction will be the responsibility of ULBs. A project environmental \nofficer will monitor implementation of these measures; liaise with local community groups, the \nSPCB, and other relevant agencies; gather baseline data; and provide technical support. The \ncontractor will be responsible for implementing of mitigation measures during the construction \nstage.  An  environmental  engineer,  who  will  be  hired  as  part  of  the  consultant  team  for \nimplementing  the  Project,  will  assist  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  in  preparing \n ", "  Appendix 14  57 \ncontractual documents so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other contractual \nobligations  of  the  contractor  clearly  identify  environmental  responsibilities  and  describe \npenalties for noncompliance. \n \n22.   Environmental monitoring reports from the corporations will be submitted to SPCB and \nthe ULBs according to the engineering phases of plant and site construction and pipe laying. \nThe  ULBs,  together  with  the  corporations,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  overall \nenvironmental monitoring and management. The PIUs will submit quarterly reports to the project \nmanagement unit, which will consolidate the data and send it on to ADB. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n23.  Public consultation was carried out throughout the project preparation phase in all six \ncities. Public  involvement and consultation activities have spread an understanding of the \nProject and its potential impacts and sought out suggestions for improve it. Issues raised in \nthese  consultations  have  been  incorporated  in  the  proposed  mitigation  measures.  The \nconsultative process covered three main stakeholder groups: (i) the government (state and \nmunicipal), (ii) residential communities, and (iii) the business community. All environmental \ndocuments are subject to public disclosure and will be made available to the public on request. \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n24.  SPCB clearance is being sought for a number of subcomponents where detailed and \ncomprehensive EMPs will need to be prepared. The Project has sufficient contingencies should \nthe SPCB require additional mitigation measures to be put in place. However, no work is to \nbegin until the appropriate operating licenses from SPCB and relevant authorities have been \ngranted.  \n \n \nH.  Conclusion \n \n25.  The Project will improve the health and sanitation of the communities in six cities and \nstrengthen the environmental planning, management, and monitoring functions of the ULBs. Full \nenvironmental benefits will be achieved only through effective operation and maintenance. The \nIEE concludes that an environmental impact assessment will not be necessary, as the Project \nwill  not  cause  significant  environmental  problems  and  the  potential  adverse  impacts  are \nmanageable  through  proper  policy,  planning,  public  relations,  and  good  construction  and \nsupervision practices.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)", "Author": "aj3", "ModDate": "D:20031215135046+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20031124190554+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 5.0 for Word"}}
