An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n \nThe  Project  will  address  citywide  deficiencies  in  basic  urban \nservices  for  six  of  the  largest  urban  centers  in  Madhya  Pradesh. \nDirect  social  benefits  will  be  sustained  improvements  in  water \nsupply,  sanitation,  garbage  collection,  and  disposal  within  the \nproject cities. Indirect benefits will accrue through improved living \nconditions,  healthier  living  environments,  and  the  prospect  of \nimproved  health  status  of  the  population.    The  Project  will  also \nassist the participating cities in undertaking participatory planning \nexercises  that  meet  the  needs  of  the  urban  poor.  Based  on \nsuccessful  experience  in  other  states  in  India,  two  community-\nlevel funds will be provided to support the  integrated upgrading of \npoor  settlements  for  improved  water  supply,  sanitation,  drains, \nand social services. \n \nMadhya  Pradesh  is  the  third  poorest  state  in  India  (after  Orissa \nand  Bihar).  Its  urban  population  below  the  poverty  line  was \nestimated as 38% in 2000, much higher than the national average \nof 24%. The baseline socioeconomic survey has shown that there \nare widespread deficiencies in basic urban services across the six \nproject  cities.  On  average,  42.3%  of  households  do  not  have  in-\nhouse  water  supplies  and  15.1%  do  not  have  access  to  piped \nwater;  over  40%  of  households  receive  water  only  on  alternate \ndays;  18.8%  of  households  do  not  have  a  private  toilet  and \nmembers  of  one  in  eight  households  defecate  outdoors;  32% \nreport  flooding  problems;  and  40%  report  no  solid  waste \ncollection.  As  a  result  the  potential  for  waterborne  and  bacterial \ndiseases is high, particularly among children.  Poor infrastructure \nand  inadequate  urban  services  also  hamper  the  economic \npotential  of  the  project  cities  as  major  local  service  centers  for \ntrading  and  commercial  activities  for their districts. The business \ncommunity  indicated  that  improvements  in  basic  urban  services, \nsuch  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management, \nare  prerequisite  for  any  improvement  in  business  performance \nand the prospect for future economic growth. \n \nThe  Project  comprises  three  parts.    Part  A\u2014urban water supply \nand  environmental  improvement\u2014covers  the  improvement  and \nexpansion  of  the  following  municipal  infrastructure  and  services: \n(i)  urban  water  supply,  (ii)  sewerage  and  sanitation,  (iii)  storm \nwater drainage, and (iv) solid waste management.  Part B\u2014public \nparticipation and awareness  program\u2014is  designed to strengthen \n\n\f \nCost Estimates \n\n \n \nFinancing Plan \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nthe  capacities  of  the  project  cities  to  plan  and  manage  urban \ndevelopment  in  a  more  effective,  transparent,  and  sustainable \nmanner. Part B consists of (i) two community-level funds that will \nbe  the  basis  for  participatory  planning  between  the  municipal \nauthorities  and  the  poor  communities  of  the  neighborhood  to \nintegrate  slum  improvements  with  citywide  infrastructure; and (ii) \nWater  for  Asian  Cities  Program  in  India  covering  urban  water \nconservation  and  demand  management  to  be  financed  through \nparallel  cofinancing  by  UN-HABITAT. \n  Part  C\u2014project \nimplementation  assistance\u2014will  consist  of  support  to  the  state \nproject  management  unit \nthe  city  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  with  activities  immediately  related  to \nthe implementation of the Project. \n \nThe estimated project cost (including parallel grant cofinancing by \nUN-HABITAT)  is  $303.5  million  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange  of  $72.9  million  (24.0%)  and  local  currency  of  $230.6 \nmillion equivalent (76.0%). \n\n(PMU)  and \n\n \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nPercent \n\n200.0 \n\n55.0 \n\n145.0 \n\nAsian Development \nBank \nUN-HABITAT \nGovernment of \nMadhya Pradesha \nProject Cities \nTotal \nUN-HABITAT = United Nations Human Settlements Programme \na \n\n52.4 \n230.6 \n\n0.0 \n72.9 \n\n17.4 \n\n33.2 \n\n0.5 \n\n0.0 \n\n52.4 \n303.5 \n\n0.5 \n\n50.6 \n\n65.9 \n\n0.1 \n\n16.7 \n\n17.3 \n100.0 \n\nIncluding  taxes  and  duties,  front-end  fees,  interests  during  construction,  and \n\ncommitment charges. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nrate \n\nlending \n\n(LIBOR)-based \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $200.0  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank's \n(ADB)  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  term  of  25  years  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered \nfacility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  0.5%  front-end  fee \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nand  Project  Agreements.  UN-HABITAT  will  administer  their \nrespective contributions as parallel cofinancing to the project cost. \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  prevailing  practice  for  externally financed \nprojects in India, the Government will relend 70% of the ADB loan \nproceeds \nin  rupees  equivalent  at  10.5%  per  annum  with \nrepayments  over  25  years  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years. \nThe remaining 30% will be provided as a grant to the government  \nof  Madhya Pradesh which will onlend the total proceeds from the \nGovernment,  on \nthe  six  project  city \ncorporations. \n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nthe  same \n\nterms, \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nv\n\nUntil 30 September 2009 \n \n31 March 2009 \n\n \nThe Urban Administration and Development Department (UADD) \nof the government of Madhya Pradesh. \n \nUADD will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The PMU, to \nbe  set  up  within  UADD  at  the  state-level  and  led  by  a  full-time \nproject  director,  will  coordinate  and  manage  all  activities  for  the \nProject.  A  state-level  Empowered  Committee  with  full  powers  to \ndecide  on  all  matters  relating  to  the  Project  will  also  be \nestablished. In each of the six project cities, a PIU will be set up to \ncarry out daily implementation activities. A city steering committee \nwill  be  set  up  to  provide  overall  monitoring  and  guidance  to  the \nrespective PIUs. \n \nGoods, works, and services financed by ADB will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.    The  PIUs \nwill  generally  carry  out  procurement  under  the  guidance  of  the \nPMU,  except  for  equipment  and  vehicles  common  to  all  cities, \nwhich  will  be  directly  procured  by  the  PMU.  To  the  extent \npossible,  goods  will  be  grouped  into  packages  larger  than \n$500,000 to be suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB) \nprocedures.  Miscellaneous  goods  for  immediate  use  that  cannot \nbe grouped under a larger contract and that cost  $500,000 or less \nper  contract  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping  or \nlocal competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. Equipment, materials, \nor  civil  works  costing  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  following \nthe state\u2019s applicable procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \nGiven the project areas\u2019 remoteness and the nature of works, civil \nworks contracts that are relatively small in value ($5 million or less \nper contract) would not be attractive to international bidders, and \ntherefore, will use LCB procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nin \nAll  consulting  services  will  be  selected  and  engaged \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  Overall,  3,882  person-months of consulting services \n(102 international and 3,780 domestic) will be required. A team of \ninternational  and  domestic  project  management  consultants  will \nbe  engaged  for  the  project  management  consultancy  (PMC)  to \nhelp implement, manage, and monitor overall project activities. A \ntotal  of  372  person-months  of  PMC  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired  (102  international  and  270  domestic).  Two  teams  of \ndomestic  design  and  supervision  consultants  will  be  engaged  for \nthe  design  and  supervision  consultancy  (DSC)  to  assist  the \nproject city PIUs in daily implementation activities. A total of 1,624 \nperson-months of DSC consulting services will be required for the \n\n \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\neast  region,  and  1,721  person-months  for  the  west  region.  A \ndomestic  firm  can  be  selected  for  one  of  the  two  DSCs.  In \naddition,  a  total  of  120  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  for  a  public  relations  and  awareness \nprogram  and  45  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services \nfor  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  of  the  Project  in  all \nthe project cities.    \n \nThe baseline socioeconomic survey under the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) identified lack of access to a reliable in-\nhouse  water  supply  as  the  foremost  deficiency.    Although  the \ncoverage  of  the  existing  water  distribution  network  in  the  six \nproject  cities  is  as  high  as  85%,  water  pressure,  and  frequency \nand duration of supply are extremely low.  Therefore the benefits \nof improved efficiency of the water supply system will accrue to all \npresent users. In addition, almost one million new consumers will \ngain  access  to  piped  water  supply  by  2010.  While  the  poor \nhouseholds  (estimated  to  be  25%  of  the  total  urban  population) \noutside  slum  settlements  will  be  fully  integrated  into  the  new \nexpanded  water  supply  system,  an  indirect  benefit  to  slum \nsettlements  is  improved  supply  at  the  slum  boundaries.  For  the \nslum  dwellers  to  directly  benefit  from  the  Project,  additional \ninvestments  are  required  to  improve  tertiary  distribution  within \nslum  settlements.  For  instance,  the  water  schemes  under  the \nArea  Improvement  Fund  (AIF)  will  benefit  up  to  100,000  slum \ndwellers,  or  about  7%  of  the  total  slum  population.  From  the \nsanitation  component,  direct  benefits  will  be  obtained  by \nhouseholds that will be able to connect to the sewerage network. \nThe network will be in the densely built-up and developing areas \nof  the  city  center.  The  percentage  of  the  poor  households  in  this \nthe  citywide  average  of  25%.  An \narea \nunderground  sewerage  network  will  however, \nthe \nboundaries of slum areas within the scheme areas and will permit \nthe  provision  of  sewered  community  latrines  that  will  benefit  an \nestimated  4%  of  poor  households.  The solid waste  component \nwill operate citywide with little difference in the standard of service \nwithin  cities.  The  proportion  of  the  poor  beneficiaries  is  therefore \nthe same for each city as a whole. \n \nThe  potential  risks  concern  (i)  sustainability  of  the  facilities  and \nservices  provided  under  the  project;  (ii)  lack  of  suitably  qualified \npersonnel  in   the   PIUs,  which  may   eventually  lead  to   weak \nimplementation of individual investment components in each city; \n(iii)  implementation  delays  due  to  slow  progress  with  start-up \nactivities  (recruiting  consultants  and  setting  up  the  project \nmanagement  structure);  (iv)  timely  availability  of  counterpart \nfunding from the participating municipalities; and (v) inappropriate \nmanagement  and  accounting  system  of \nthe  Water  Works \nDepartment.  To  mitigate  most  of  these  risks, sufficient measures \nhave been incorporated in the Project in the form of the financial \n\nis  slightly  below \n\nreach \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nvii \n\nimprovement  action  plan,  sufficient  amounts  allotted  in  each \nmunicipal budget to cover the municipal corporation\u2019s share of the \nannual  project  investment  requirement,  and  a  plan  to  improve \nwater supply management. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  India  for  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Environmental  Improvement  in  Madhya  Pradesh \nProject. The project framework (Appendix 1), summarizes the objectives, scope, and approach \nof the Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nThe  previous  operational  strategy  for  India,  launched  in  1996,  introduced  state-level \n2. \noperations  in  a  few  reform-minded  states  to  fully  exploit  complementarities  and  synergies \nbetween  interventions  and  maximize  the  development  impact  in  those  states.  Typically,  the \nAsian  Development  Bank's  (ADB)  state-level  operations  have  consisted  of  a  public  resource \nmanagement  program  to  support  fiscal  consolidation  with  programs  of  sectoral  reforms  and \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  sectors  like  power,  transportation,  and  urban  social  infrastructure. \nMadhya  Pradesh  was  the  second  focal  state1  selected  for  such  state-level assistance, with a \nloan for the Public Resource Management Program approved in December 1999 and followed \nby  Power  Sector  Development  Program  in  December  2000  and  State  Roads  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  in  December  2002.  Recognizing  the  deteriorating  quality  of  municipal \nservices  and  environmental  degradation  in  urban  centers,  the  government  of  the  state  of \nMadhya Pradesh requested ADB to provide financial assistance to six of the largest cities of the \nstate.  \n \nA. \n \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nThe Urban Sector in Madhya Pradesh \n\n \n3. \nMadhya  Pradesh  geographically  is  the  heartland  of  India;  its  very  name  means  central \nstate.  It  is  largely  a  rural  state  with  more  than  70%  of  its  60  million  population  in  villages  and \nworking in agriculture or agriculture-related activities (Census 2001).  There are 26 towns with a \npopulation over 100,000 including the capital city, Bhopal. The total urban population is currently \n16.1  million  or  27%  of  the  total  population.  During  the  last  10  years  (1991-2001), population \ngrowth  in  the  urban  areas  was  slightly  higher  at  2.8%  per  year  compared  with  the  overall \npopulation growth of 2.2%. Even at a modest growth rate of 2% per year, the urban population \nis expected to reach 25 million by the end of the design period of the Project, 2021.  \n  \nThe  bifurcation  of  the  state  into  Chhattisgarh  and  Madhya  Pradesh  in  November  2000 \n4. \nmeant a considerable downsizing of Madhya Pradesh in demography and economic activity as \nwell as geography. Estimates indicate that 31% of the geographic area, 26% of the population, \n30%  of  mineral-rich  land  area,  and  148  large  and  medium-scale  enterprises  were  \"lost\"  to \nChhattisgarh  with  the  split.  Much  of  the  urban  areas,  however,  remained  and  the  role  of  the \nurban sector in the economy has increased with reduced dependence on natural resources.  \n \n5. \nMadhya  Pradesh  is  the  third  poorest  state  in  India  (after  Orissa  and  Bihar)  in  terms  of \nthe  percentage  of  people  below  the  poverty  line.  The  estimated  urban  population  below  the \npoverty  line  was  38.4%  in  2000,  much  higher  than  the  national  average  of  23.6%.    Urban \npoverty, however, increased faster than rural poverty between 19942 and 2000 and, as a result, \nthe incidence of poverty is now more or less the same between urban areas and rural villages. \nAmong the urban poor, the slum population, counted for the first time during the 2001 Census, \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB\u2019s focal states include Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, and northeastern states.  \n2  The incidence of poverty was 48.4% in urban areas and 40.6% in rural villages in 1994. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\nrepresented  about  24.3%  of  the  urban  population,  which  is  slightly  higher  than  the  national \naverage of 22.6%. Other than these primary data published by the Central Government, there is \nvery  little  state-level  data  that  can  support  an  analysis  of  vulnerability  among  the  urban  poor. \nAlmost  no  secondary  data  exist  to  permit  an  analysis  of  other  dimensions  of  urban  poverty, \nparticularly  health,  social  capital,  and  gender  disparity.  To  fill  such  data  gap,  a  baseline \nsocioeconomic  survey  covering  9,600  households,  was  undertaken  during  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).  The  survey  was  complemented  by  a  series  of \nparticipatory  exercises  including  participatory  rapid  appraisal,  focus  group  discussions,  and \nmunicipal workshops. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Cities: Performance and Challenges \n\n \n\na. \n\nSocioeconomic Context \n\n \n \n \n6. \nThe project cities represent six of the largest municipal corporations in Madhya Pradesh. \nBhopal  and  Indore  have  a  population  of  around  1.5  million  each.  Gwalior  and  Jabalpur  have \nbetween 800,000 and 1 million, and the remaining two cities, Ratlam and Ujjain have less than \n500,000 each. The total population of the six cities is 5.46 million (2001 Census), representing \nabout  a  third  of  the  state\u2019s  urban  population.  Using  a  modest  annual  growth  rate  of  2.5%  (for \n2006-2011)  and  2.25%  (for  2011-2021),  which  are  slightly  lower  than  all-India projections, the \ntotal population for the six project cities is estimated to be 6.9 million in 2010 and 9.1 million in \n2021.  \n \n7. \n  Each  city  has  a  very  different  historical  origin,  role,  and  function  within  the  state \n(Appendix  2).  The  economic  base  and  level  of  development  are  equally  diverse,  as  are  their \nprospects for future growth and expansion. Indore and Bhopal are thriving\u2014Indore because of \nits  position  as  the  largest  city  in  the  state,  and  its  trading  and  industrial  base;  and  Bhopal \nbecause of its education and position as state capital and trading and commercial center. The \nother cities are much smaller and would not be expected to have the dynamism and diversity of \nthe larger cities. All cities, however, suffered in recent years from the closure or downsizing of \nthe textile and other traditional industries. Many of the changes were a result of changes a shift \nin the fortunes of the sector, rather than location difficulties in Madhya Pradesh. \n \n8. \nWhile  industrial  estates  in  the  urban  areas  suffer  from  poor  quality  infrastructure, \ninadequate planning, and diminishing financial resources, all the project cities have potential in \nthe services sector, as all are the major local service center for trading and commercial activity \nfor their districts. Tourism represents another bright prospect in some project cities, as well as \nfor  the  state  as  a  whole.  The  business  community,  however,  pointed  out  the  factors  that  they \nconsider as prerequisite for any improvement in business performance and prospects for future \neconomic growth. Access to finance was almost universally the most important factor. However, \ninfrastructure  facilities,  including  power,  urban  transport,  water  supply,  sanitation  and  solid \nwaste  management,  were  also  high  on  the  list.  While  power  lies  outside  the  scope  of  the \nProject, most businesses considered that improvements in basic urban services were absolutely \nnecessary and that there would be direct and indirect positive outcomes from improvements in \nproviding the service.  \n \n \n \nIn  most  of  the  project  cities,  water  supply  does  not  meet  basic  human  requirements, \n9. \nbeing provided only a few hours a day in the wet season and less than an hour every other day \nin the dry season.  Nonrevenue water is more than 50% in all the project cities and, without an \nurgent  intervention  it  will  continue  to  get  worse,  exacerbating  water  shortages  and  increasing \n\nUrban Environmental Infrastructure and Services \n\nb. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n3\n\nthe cost of supply.  In three project cities, the average water supplied will be less than 40 liters \nper capita per day (lpcd) by 2010, which is well below the minimum standard (70 lpcd) set by \nthe  Government  of  India.    By  2021,  the  average  water  supplied  in  all  project  cities  except \nBhopal, will be less than 50 lpcd, and less than 25 lpcd in Indore, Jabalpur, and Ratlam.  \n \nSanitation is also grossly inadequate in all project cities, with resulting unhygienic living \n10. \nconditions  and  public  health  problems.  Only  10%  of  households  reported  satisfaction  with \nwastewater  management  in  the  city.    In  Bhopal,  Gwalior,  and  Indore,  the  existing  small \nreticulated sewerage systems cover less than 10% of the population.  Except in Bhopal, these \nsystems  do  not  function  properly.  Estimates  of  the  proportion  of  households  with  septic  tanks \ndiffer across cities, from 30% in Bhopal and Gwalior to 80% in Ujjain. Of households with septic \ntanks, more than half report that the tanks are never cleaned and only 6% report cleaning them \nat  the  recommended  frequency  of  every  2  years.  Thus,  even  for  households  with  septic  tank \nfacilities, very few are working properly.  \n \n11. \nInadequate  solid  waste  management  is  evident  in  all  project  cities.    Streets,  drainage \nchannels,  and  open  areas  are  littered  with  wastes.    Residents  and  business  perceive  the \nsituation  as  intolerable,  affecting  public  health  and  indirectly  affecting  economic  development, \nbut  there  is  little  motivation  to  initiate  change.  Without  the  Project,  none  of  the  increasing \nquantity  of  solid  waste  will  be  adequately  disposed  of  and  at  least  40%  will  remain  on streets \nand  in  public  places.    The  current  unhygienic  conditions  will  prevail,  with  associated \nenvironmental degradation and public health problems. \n \nB. \n \n\nUrban Water Supply: Issues and Challenges \n\n1.  Core Issues of Urban Water Supply Sector in Madhya Pradesh \n\n \n12. \nIn  all  project  cities,  water  from  existing  surface  water  and  groundwater  sources  is \ntheoretically adequate for the present population.  However, the water produced does not reach \nthe target beneficiaries largely because of operational deficiencies. In fact, all cities suffer from \nhigh levels of nonrevenue water. Although there is no accurate information, nonrevenue water is \nestimated  at  more  than  50%  in  all  cities.    In  particular,  technical  losses  in  the  distribution \nnetwork are estimated to be in excess of 20%; nontechnical losses, through illegal connections, \nare also estimated to be in the same range. The losses from stand posts are thought to be very \nhigh as many do not work properly and large quantities of water are wasted.  The design of the \nProject is therefore based on the principle that any capital investment to expand the distribution \nnetwork or augment the source should be preceded by system optimization to make the existing \nwater supply system more efficient and economical.  \n \n13.  Water  charges  for  household  connections  are  based  on  fixed  rates  and  metering  is \nundertaken in some cities only for commercial and industrial units. Except in Bhopal, the present \nmonthly  charges  for  unmetered  water  connections  are  too  low  compared  with  the  cost  of \nproviding services. Although the consumers are willing to pay higher prices for better services, \nthe socioeconomic survey carried out under the TA showed that the record on tariff collection is \npoor  as  many  consumers  are  not  properly  charged.  The  result  is  a  chronic  shortage  of  funds \neven for basic maintenance. To make up the shortfalls in revenues, the state government in the \npast had to provide direct and indirect fiscal support for operation and maintenance (O&M). In \nline with ADB's water policy,3 the Project will promote cost recovery principles and tariff reforms \nfor water conservation and its sustainable use. Consumers are expected to meet the full O&M \ncosts of water facilities and service provision through modified tariff structures and rates. ADB's \n\n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2000.  Water for All. The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned from ADB-Assisted Urban Projects \n\nwater  policy  also  highlights  the  importance  of  wide-ranging public awareness and community \neducation programs to broadcast the message that water is no longer a gift from the gods, but a \nresource  that  requires  prudent  management.  For  this  purpose,  the  Project  will  introduce  a \nfocused demand-side management program.   \n \nThe prevalence of high nonrevenue water and inadequate water charges below the cost \n14. \nindicate poor management. With the passage of the 74th constitutional amendment in Ma dhya \nPradesh  in  1992,  the  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  (PHED)  was  directed  in  1995  to \ntransfer  assets  in  the  water  supply  sector  to  the  respective  city  corporations  for  O&M. \nConcurrently, PHED staff working on O&M were also placed under the functional control of the \ncity  corporations,  although  administrative  control  over  them  remains  with  PHED  at  the  state-\nlevel. For sector planning, design, and construction of new projects, PHED continued to assume \nresponsibility  on  behalf  of  the  city  corporations.  In  the  long  term,  however,  it  is  important  that \nmanagement  of  water  supply  operations,  from  planning  and  development  to  service  provision \nand O&M, be undertaken by a fully responsible and autonomous Water Supply and Sanitation \nDepartment.    Clearly,  the  current  arrangement  between  the  city  corporation  and  PHED  is \nneither  sustainable  nor  cost-effective.  To  overcome  present  problems,  several  options  have \nbeen reviewed and recommendations are made for implementation under the Project.   \n \n \n \n15. \nThere are at present six ongoing ADB-assisted urban sector projects in India. The total \nfinancial commitment of ADB in these projects is close to $900 million  (external assistance to \nthe urban sector is summarized in Appendix 3). Of the six projects, two are lending to financial \ninstitutions  at  the  national  level  for  onlending  to  eligible  borrowers  in  the  housing  and \ncommercial urban infrastructure sectors. The remaining four are integrated urban development \nprojects  for  selected  state  and  local  governments  to  improve  basic  urban  infrastructure.4  The \ncomponents in the integrated projects are multiple and range from water supply and sanitation, \nurban  roads,  and  slum  improvement  to  providing  public  toilets,  vegetable  markets,  and  fire-\nfighting equipment.  \n \n16. \nIt  is  generally  recognized  that  integrated  urban  development  projects  are  inherently \ncomplex  as  they  typically  include  multiple  sector  investments  for  more  than  one  urban  area, \nalong  with  policy  reform,  capacity  building,  governance,  and  community  participation \ncomponents.  Besides,  the  urban  sector  has  traditionally  been  considered  a  difficult  sector  for \nproject  implementation  due  to  the  weak  capacities  of  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs),  the \nmultidisciplinary  and  interconnected  nature  of  the  works  in  the  urban  subsectors,  and  the \nreforms  that  are  required  to  make  the  projects  institutionally  and  financially  sustainable.  In \naddition, executing agencies (EAs) and participating municipalities that are new to ADB-assisted \nprojects need time as well as patience to fully familiarize themselves with ADB\u2019s technical and \nprocurement  requirements.  As  most  urban  projects  have  a  component  for  urban  poverty \nreduction at the community level, EAs and participating municipalities are also required to learn \nhow to deal with the urban poor through nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and local slum \nleaders\u2014a \nin  project \nimplementation and less than satisfactory performance of the ADB-assisted urban projects.   \n\ntime-consuming  process.

The scope of the Project is \n18. \nmade simpler by focusing on a few high-priority urban subsectors, which were identified through \na comprehensive socioeconomic survey and participatory consultations in each project city.  In \nterms  of  ownership,  state  and  local  governments  are  already  closely  involved  in  project \npreparation  through  a  newly  established  project  cell.    Dynamic  and  experienced  staff  are \nidentified  and  nominated  to  head  the  project  cell,  while  the  project  implementation  staff  at  the \nlocal level will be given full training before the loan becomes effective. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \nThe primary objective is to promote sustainable growth and poverty reduction in the six \n19. \nproject cities in Madhya Pradesh, and thereafter in the other cities in the state. Specifically, the \nProject  will  (i)  provide sustainable basic urban infrastructure and services to all citizens of the \nsix  project  cities;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  capacities  of  the  project  cities  to  plan  and  manage \nurban  water  supply  and  sanitation  system  in  a  more  effective,  transparent,  and  sustainable \nmanner.  While the Project will benefit the entire urban community in general, some components \nwill focus on upgrading the conditions of the poorest and most needy groups in the slum areas \nin  particular.    The  Project  will  also  promote  active  participation of women citizens in municipal \nmanagement and project implementation as both beneficiaries and agents. \n \nB. \n \nThe Project comprises three parts.  Part A\u2014the urban water supply and environmental \n20. \nimprovement\u2014covers the improvement and expansion of the following municipal infrastructure \nand services: (i) urban water supply, (ii) sewerage and sanitation, (iii) storm water drainage, and \n(iv) solid waste management.  Part B\u2014is designed to increase the awareness and participation \nof the project beneficiaries in project implementation through (i)  two community-level funds that \nwill  provide  for  participatory  planning  between  the  municipal  authorities  and  the  poor \ncommunities  at  the  neighborhood  level,  for  integrating  slum  improvements  with  citywide \ninfrastructure;  and  (ii)  the  Water  for  Asian  Cities  Program  in  India  covering  urban  water \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nconservation  and  demand  management,  to  be  financed  through  parallel  cofinancing  by  United \nNations  Human  Settlements  Programme  (UN-HABITAT).      Part  C\u2014project  implementation \nassistance\u2014will be support to the PMU at state-level and project implementation unit (PIUs) at \ncity level, with activities immediately related to implementation of the Project.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Urban Water Supply and Environmental Improvement \n\na. \n\nWater Supply \n\n \nThis  component  will  include  (i)  optimizing  of  the  present  system,  including  reducing \n21. \nnonrevenue  water  by  legitimizing  unauthorized  connections  and  stopping  leakages;  (ii) \nexpanding  the  distribution  system  into  unserved  areas;  and  (iii)  augmenting  surface  water \nproduction (intake and treatment) as required.   \n \n\nb. \n\nSewerage and Sanitation \n\n \n22. \nThe sewerage component is proposed for high-density city center areas where on-site or \nlocal wastewater treatment is not appropriate due to insufficient space.  Sewage treatment will \nbe  using  low-cost  maintenance/waste  stabilization  ponds.    In  lower  density  areas,  on-site \nsanitation  will  continue  to  be  used,  with  the  Project  supplying  equipment  for  emptying  septic \ntanks.    Sewerage  schemes  are  included  for  all  project  cities  except  Ratlam.  In  all  cities, \ncommunity sanitation blocks will be provided for urban poor settlements where on-plot latrines \nare not possible. \n \n\nc. \n\nStorm Water Drainage \n\n \n23. \nThis component will improve the storm water flow in urban drainage networks, based on \ncitywide drainage master plans and designs. Roadside drains will be improved to reduce major \ninundation from rainfall and waterlogging problems within the core urban areas.  Schemes are \nproposed for Gwalior, Jabalpur, and Ratlam.   \n \n\nd. \n\nSolid Waste Management \n\n \n24. \nThis  component  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  the  collection  and  disposal  service  and \nextend coverage.  The targets are 85% of households in urban centers and 60% in peripheral \nareas.  The program for each project city includes (i) the supply of community waste collection \ncontainers, (ii) the supply of compactor trucks and dumper placer vehicles, and (iii) civil works to \nconstruct  sanitary  landfill  sites  with  provision  of  equipment  and  other  facilities  for  handling \nrefuse.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Public Participation and Awareness Program \n\na. \n\nFunds for Municipal Action Planning for Poverty Reduction (MAPP) \n\n \nThe objective of the MAPP process is to integrate the provision of tertiary urban services \n25. \nfor urban poor settlements into citywide development, and to build capacity within the municipal \ncorporations  for  participatory  planning  with  community  groups,  using  social  and  poverty \nanalysis.    For  this  purpose,  two  specific  funds  are  provided  under  the  Project  based  on  the \nsuccessful experience in the state of Andra Pradesh.5 The Area Improvement Fund (AIF) will be \n                                                 \n5  The  MAPP  process  was  developed  in  2000  and  implemented  under  the  Andhra  Pradesh  Urban  Services  for  the \nPoor (APUSP) collaboration between the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) and \nthe government of Andhra Pradesh. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n7\n\navailable to municipal corporations annually  within  the  framework  of  the  MAPP,  which  will  be \nprepared  by  each  project  city  corporation  within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness  and  updated \nannually.    Eligible  schemes  include  integrated  upgrading  of  slum  and  poor  settlements  for \nimproved water supply, sanitation, drains, roads, and street lighting. The total value of the AIF is \n$5 million.  The Community Initiatives Fund (CIF) will be available to communities within slums \nidentified  through  the  MAPP  process  to  finance  social  sector  and  nonphysical  initiatives.  The \nparticipatory  appraisal  exercise  during  the  TA  identified  a  priority  need  for community centers, \neducation, income-generating schemes, and local health care support facilities. Local NGOs will \nbe  engaged  to  assist  in  the  MAPP  process  in  each  project  city.    The  participating  NGOs  will \nhave experience working with government agencies and communities in participatory planning \nand implementing environmental and slum improvement projects.  \n \n \n \n26. \nDuring  the  loan  Fact-Finding  Mission,  ADB  and  UN-HABITAT  jointly  developed  a \ncollaborative  framework  for  the  Water  for  Asian  Cities  Program  in  India  (Supplementary \nAppendix A) based on the broader memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between the \ntwo agencies on 18 March 2003.  According to this collaborative framework, the Water for Asian \nCities  Program  will  cover  capacity  building,  awareness,  advocacy,  and  education  activities  in \nurban water conservation and demand management, among others. A detailed implementation \nstrategy and plan will be developed and formalized with the Ministry of Urban Development and \nPoverty Reduction.    \n \n\nWater for Asian Cities Program in India \n\nb. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Implementation Assistance \n\na. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n27. \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  (i)  to  assist  the  PMU  and  PIUs  in  developing \nworking  procedures  and  quality  control  to  smoothly  implement  the  Project;  and  (ii)  to  prepare \ndetailed  designs  of  the  various  investment  components  for  each  project  city,  and  assist  in \nconstruction supervision and quality control of the works. \n \n\nb. \n\nPublic Relations and Awareness Program  \n\n \n28. \nAn  awareness campaign through various media  will  be  undertaken  to  make  the  public \naware  of  the  short-term  inconveniences  and  long-term  benefits  of  the  Project  to  gain  the  full \nsupport of the beneficiaries.  Beneficiaries will be also made aware of preventive care to avoid \nenvironmental  health-related  hazards  and  of  their  responsibilities  to  avoid  wasting  water, \nincluding  issues  such  as  water  rates,  user  charges,  property  tax  reform,  etc.  for  achieving  the \ngoals of the Project.    In  addition,  the  campaign  will  provide  feedback to the PMU to adjust the \nwork program based on the impact of the campaign and concerns raised by the beneficiaries . \n \nC. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $303.5  million  equivalent  (including  taxes \n29. \nand  duties  of  $11.9  million  equivalent),  of  which  $72.9  million  (24.0%)  is  foreign  exchange \nincluding  $17.4  million  in  interest  during  construction  and  other  charges,  and  $230.6  million \nequivalent (76.0%) is local currency.

The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate  determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a 0.75% per annum commitment charge, a 0.5% front-end \nfee, conversion options in accordance with ADB's Conversion Guidelines, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Borrower will be India. \nThe  foreign  exchange  risk  will  be  borne  by  the  Government  of  India.    The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere  the  Government\u2019s  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n \n31. \nThe  ADB  loan  of  $200.0  million  is  proposed  to  finance  75.4%  of  the  foreign  exchange \ncost excluding the front-end fee, interest and other charges on the loan during construction, and \n62.9%  or  $145.0  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  local  cost  financing  covers \npart of the costs relating to civil works, equipment, consulting services, and project management \nsupport, but excludes land, and duties and taxes estimated at $11.9 million. ADB\u2019s financing of \nthe local currency cost is considered justified given that financing for basic urban infrastructure \nis severely constrained. The state government and the project cities are taking steps to raise tax \nand nontax revenues, rationalize expenditures, and enhance the creditworthiness of ULBs.  UN-\nHABITAT will provide and administer parallel grant cofinancing of $0.5 million. The  government \nof the state will provide local currency financing of $33.2 million equivalent to cover part of the \ncost  of  consulting  services  and  the  cost  of  counterpart  staff  required  for  the  proposed  PMU, \ntaxes and duties, and a grant equivalent to 20% of the investment for the water supply scheme \nto  Indore  Corporation.  The  six  cities  will  provide  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $52.4 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n9\n\nmillion  equivalent  or  17.3%  of  the  total  project  cost  to  cover  civil  works,  equipment  and \nmaterials, consulting services, and the cost of counterpart staff required for the proposed PIUs \n(Table 2).  \n \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n55.0 \n0.5 \n17.4 a \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nUN-HABITAT \nGovernment of Madhya \nPradesh  \nProject Cities  \nTotal \na \nb Including taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n0.0 \n72.9 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n145.0 \n0.0 \n33.2b \n\n52.4 \n230.6 \n\nTotal  \nCost \n200.0 \n0.5 \n50.6 \n\n52.4 \n303.5 \n\n% \n\n65.9 \n0.1 \n16.7 \n\n17.3 \n100.0 \n\nIncluding front-end fees, interests during construction, and commitment charges. \n\n \n \n32. \nIt  is  expected  that  in  accordance  with  the  prevailing  practice  for  externally  financed \nprojects  in  India,  the  Government  will  relend  70%  of  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  in  rupees \nequivalent  at  10.5%  per  annum  with  repayments  over  25  years  including  a  grace  period  of  5 \nyears;  the  remaining  30%  will  be  provided  as  a  grant  to  the  state  government.  The  state \ngovernment  will  onlend  the  total  proceeds  from  the  Government  to  the  six  project  city \ncorporations on the same terms. \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n33. \nThe  Urban  Administration  and  Development  Department  (UADD)  of  the  government  of \nMadhya  Pradesh  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  of  the  Project  and  will  be  responsible  for \noverall  strategic  guidance,  technical  supervision,  execution  of  the  Project,  and  ensuring \ncompliance  with  the  loan  covenants.  UADD  will  set  up  a  state-level  PMU,  led  by  a  full-time \nproject director. The project director will be charged exclusively with executing the Project and \nwill  have  no  other  duties  within  UADD.  The  project  director,  supported  by  the  PMU  and \nconsultants, will coordinate all activities under the Project; will be responsible for overall project \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  supervision;  and  will  directly  report  to  the  secretary  of  UADD \nunder  the  overall  supervision  of  the  principal  secretary  of  UADD.  The  project  director  will  be \nsupported  by  at  least  one  deputy  project  director  for  (i)  managing  and  implementing  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services,  and  for  (ii)  overseeing  and  guiding  the  public  participation  and \nawareness  activities  and  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  covenants.  An  accounting  and \nadministrative unit will be set up to manage procurement and loan account administration. The \nPMU will be properly staffed and assisted by consultants with expertise in engineering, finance \nand  accounting,  social  and  gender  development,  institutional  development,  community \ndevelopment,  procurement,  finance,  resettlement  and  urban  planning.  Overall  implementation \narrangements are in Appendix 5.  \n \nA  state-level  Empowered  Committee  (EC)  will  be  set  up  with  full  powers  to  decide  on \n34. \nmatters related to the Project.  The Empowered Committee will consist of the project director as \nmember  secretary,  the  Chief  Secretary  (chair  person),  UADD,  Finance  Department,  Public \nHealth and Engineering Department, and commissioner of UADD. Other relevant officials may \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\nbe invited as necessary. Once the Project is made effective, the EC will meet regularly (at least \nonce  every  3  months)  to  review  project  performance  and  decide  on  major  issues,  such  as \ncounterpart  funding,  implementation  bottlenecks,  land  disputes,  special  procurement,  policy \nreforms, etc. \n \nThe PMU will be responsible for (i) appointing project management consultants, detailed \n35. \ndesign  and  construction  supervision  consultants,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME) \nconsultants, public relations and community awareness consultants, and NGOs;  (ii) approving \nthe design of the investment components in consultation with the project city corporations; (iii) \nprequalifying  contractors;  (iv)  implementing  public  relations  and  community  awareness \nprograms;  (v)  preparing  standard  bid  documents;  (vi)  monitoring  the  tendering  process  and \nguiding the project cities in bid evaluation and preparing bid evaluation reports for approval by \nADB;  (vii)  procuring  equipment  at  the  state-level  including  those  related  to  solid  waste \nmanagement;  (viii)  coordinating  with  ADB  on  matters  related  to  disbursements;  and  (ix) \nmaintaining project documents and submitting timely reports6 to ADB.   \n \n36. \nIn  each  project  city,  a  PIU will be established, headed by the municipal commissioner \nsupported by a full-time senior technical person experienced in public health and environmental \nengineering.  7    The  PIU  will  comprise  three  sections:  (i)  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  (ii) \ncommunity  awareness  and  participation,  and  (iii)  finance  and  administration.    The  number  of \nPIU staff will range from 10 in Ratlam to 17 in Indore, placed on the basis of the volume of work \nto handle. \n \n37. \nThe  responsibilities  of  the  PIU  will  include  carrying  out  detailed  surveys,  investigations \nand  engineering  designs  of  the  individual  city  components;  tendering,  evaluating  bids  and \nawarding  works,  contract  administration,  supervision  and  quality  control;  measuring  works \ncarried  out  by  the  contractors,  certifying  payments,  conducting  public  awareness  campaigns \nand  participation  programs,  BME  studies,  environmental  assessment,  complying  with  loan \ncovenants, and preparing monthly reports.  \n \n38. \nThe performance of the PIU will be monitored and guided by a city steering committee \nchaired  by  each  city  mayor.    For  each  city,  the  committee  will  comprise  the  collector  of  the \nrelevant district or his/her nominee, representatives from the state\u2019s Public Health Engineering \nDepartment,  Pollution  Control  Board,  the  State  Electricity  Board  and  four  elected  municipal \ncounselors (including one woman and one from a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe). Once the \nProject  is  made  effective,  each  city  steering  committee  will  meet  regularly  to  review  progress \nand sort out local issues and policy matters, at least once every 3 months.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period and Start-Up Activities \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness. \n39. \nAppendix 6 presents the implementation schedule.  To minimize start-up delays observed from \nsimilar  ADB-assisted  urban  projects  in  India,  ADB  will  help  the  state  and  municipal \ngovernments8  establish \ntendering  procedures  and  prepare  prequalification  documents, \nprequalify  contractors  for  civil  works,  and  prepare  standard  bid  documents  for  contract \npackages.    Advance  action  for  recruiting  consultants  (project  management  consultancy  [PMC] \nand  design  and  supervision  consultancy  [DSC])  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  loan \n\n                                                 \n6 Including monthly project performance reports, quarterly progress reports, BME reports.  \n7 Terms of reference for the PMU and PIUs are in Supplementary Appendices  B and C. \n8  ADB.  2003.

The Government and the EA were advised that advance action does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nGoods, works, and services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n40. \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.    Procurement  will  generally  be  carried  out  by  the  PIUs  under  the \nguidance  of  the  PMU,  except  for  equipment  and  vehicles  common  to  all  cities,  which  will  be \ndirectly  procured  by  the  PMU.    Equipment  and  selected  materials  will  be  acquired  using \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB), international shopping (IS), and local competitive bidding \n(LCB) procedures as appropriate. To the extent possible, goods to be procured will be grouped \ninto packages larger than  $500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous goods for \nimmediate use that cannot be grouped into a larger contract and that cost less than $500,000 \nper  contract  will  be  procured  through  IS  or  LCB  procedures.  Off-the-shelf  items  and \nstandardized products costing $100,000 or less will be procured following the state\u2019s applicable \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nGiven  the  project  areas\u2019  remoteness  and  the  nature  of  works,  civil  works  contracts \n41. \nvalued at less than $5 million each would not be attractive to international bidders, and therefore \nwill be carried out using LCB procedures acceptable to ADB.  Some civil works such as water \ntreatment  plants,  sewage  treatment  plants,  pumping  stations,  and  solid  waste  management \nsanitary  landfill  disposal  sites  will  be  undertaken  on  a  turnkey  basis.9    To  expedite  project \nimplementation,  advance  action  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines for Procurement,  will be \nundertaken  for  (i)  prequalifying  contractors,  and  (ii)  preparing  tender  documents.  The \nGovernment and the EA were advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinance  the  Project.  Equipment,  materials  or  civil  works  costing  $100,000  or  less  including  for \nuse by community organizations or NGOs for the slum improvement activities related to AIF and \nCIF  will  be  procured  following  the  state\u2019s  applicable  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB. The indicative procurement packages are given in Appendix 7. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsulting  services  are  required \n\n \nfor  project  management,  engineering  design, \n42. \nconstruction  supervision,  procurement of goods and services, public relations and awareness, \nand BME.  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging \ndomestic consultants. \n \n43. \nFive  packages  of  consulting  services  will  be  provided.    An  international  firm  in \nassociation  with  domestic  firms  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality  and  cost  based  method  of \nselection  for  the  PMC  to  assist  the  PMU  in  overall  administration  and  management  of  the \nProject.  The  estimated  staffing  requirement  for  the  PMC  is  372  person-months  (102 \ninternational  and  270  domestic).  There  will  be  two  DSCs,  which  will  be  domestic  firms.  The \nDSCs  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  project  city  PIUs  in  survey,  investigation,  detailed \nengineering  designs,  preparing  contract  documents,  tendering,  supervision,  quality  control, \nproject  reporting,  and  preparing  municipal  action  plans  for  poverty  reduction.    DSC  (east)  will \nassist  the  PIUs  in  Bhopal,  Gwalior,  and  Jabalpur  and  require  an  estimated  staffing  of  1,624 \nperson-months.  DSC (west) will assist the PIUs in Indore, Ratlam, and Ujjain with an estimated \nstaffing  of  1,721  person-months.    Domestic  firms  bidding  for  the  DSCs  will  not  be  eligible  to \n                                                 \n9  Where  the  cost,  insurance,  and  freight  or  ex-factory  cost  of  goods  and  supplies  for  permanent  works  of  one \npackage is estimated to equal or exceed 60%, such procurement package should not be treated as a civil works \npackage. \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n\nassociate with an international firm bidding for the PMC.  The same domestic firms cannot be \nselected for both DSCs. In addition, domestic firms will be engaged for the public relations and \nawareness program, and BME of the Project in the project cities (Supplementary Appendix D).   \n \n\n5. \n\nFinancing of Community-Based Activities \n\n \n44. \nTo complement the capacity building and to promote the necessary reforms, the MAPP \nprocess  will  be  adopted  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  Local  community  committees  will  be \nestablished for the participatory planning and implementation of the AIF and CIF, which will be \nheld by the PMU.  The PMU will allocate the indicative budget planning figures (IPF) to the city \ncorporations.  The  first  IPF  will  be  calculated  for  each  city  in  a  proportion  equal  to  the  slum \npopulation. Subsequent allocations may be adjusted on an incentive  basis to allow for bonuses \nto the corporations that perform well.  The details of individual and group assistance under the \nCIF  will  be  decided  during  the  planning  process.  The  provided  microcredit  facility  will  be \nrepayable in over 24 bimonthly installments carrying interest not exceeding 9%. The funds will \nbe disbursed to the city corporations or directly to contractors and suppliers on a reimbursable \nbasis following approved completion of specified stages.  Financial accounting and reporting will \nbe  the  responsibility  of  the  city  commissioner  who  will  submit  quarterly  progress reports and \naccounts  to  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  make  quarterly  monitoring  visits  to  each  city  and  will \nannually evaluate the AIF and CIF. \n   \n\n6. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n45. \nLand acquisition problems have frequently been a major source of implementation delay \nin  urban  projects  in  India.    Under  the  Project,  the  land  acquisition  requirements  have  been \nminimized.    Most  of  the  proposed  improvement  and  construction  work  will  be  carried  out  on \navailable  government  land,  except  for  the  solid  waste  disposal  site  in  Indore  and  the  sewage \ntreatment  plant  in  Jabalpur  (para.  46).    However,  activities  of  roadside  vendors  will  be \ntemporarily  displaced  when  water  pipelines  and  sewers  are  laid.    The  total  number  of  people \naffected  by  the  Project  can  only  be  estimated  after  the  detailed  design  of  the  individual \ncomponents, which will try to minimize resettlement and loss or disruption of income-generating \nassets.    If,  during  detailed  design,  involuntary  resettlement  arises  from  land  acquisition  or \ntemporary  disruption  of  income  generation,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented in accordance with government laws and procedures, ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement,  and  the  Project\u2019s  agreed-upon  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework \n(Supplementary Appendix F).  The overall land acquisition and resettlement requirements under \nthe Project are summarized in Appendix 8.  \n \n46. \nIn Indore, land for the new solid waste disposal site was provisionally identified, but not \nconfirmed  by  the  municipal  corporation.  No  government-owned  land  is  available  within  a \nreasonable distance, so purchasing privately owned land is being considered.  The 25-hectare \n(ha) site being considered is about 10 kilometers (km) from the city center and 1 km away from \nhabitation.  In Jabalpur, construction of a sewage treatment plant will require 55 ha, but only 25 \nha of  government  land  is  available.    Acquisition  of  the  additional  30  ha  of  privately  owned \nunirrigated land would affect 12 agricultural plots.  Fourteen households (77 persons) will suffer \nfull  or  partial  loss  of  property.    Most  of  the  landowners  have  their  own  businesses  or  are \nemployed professionals who hire local labor to cultivate their plots.  Four households will require \nrelocation  and  will  be  accommodated  within  the  same  village.    A  total  of  64  persons  will  be \nindirectly  affected  and  suffer  income/wage  losses.    A  short  resettlement  plan  (Supplementary \nAppendix  G)  has  been  prepared  and  the  affected  households  will  receive  cash  for  land  and \nimmovable assets at replacement prices.  Compensation will be provided for loss of livelihood, \nand shifting of structures and goods.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n13\n\n7. \n\nOperation and Maintenance  \n\n \n47. \nO&M of the assets provided under the Project will be the responsibility of the six project \ncity  corporations.    The  municipal  corporation  presently  maintains  water  supply  and  sewerage \nwith assistance from PHED staff who are administratively responsible to the state government.  \nIt  is  recommended  that  the  present  system  of  PHED/municipal  corporation  dual  authority  be \ndiscontinued  and  that  water  and  sanitation  departments  autonomous  within  the  municipal \nstructure  be  established.    Where  experienced  PHED  staff  need  to  be  retained  for  undertaking \nO&M,  PHED  should  make  them  available  on  a  contract  basis  to  the  project  city  corporations.   \nWith  the  introduction  of  better  demand  side  management  and  domestic  water metering, the \nwater  works  department  should  be  responsible  for  water  meter  reading,  billing,  and \nmaintenance.    This  leads  to  a  process  of  increased  financial  accountability  and  the  option  for \ncontracting  out  of  the  municipal  water  works  departments  or  introducing  private  sector \nparticipation.    A  water  supply  management  plan  for  improving  O&M  in  the  project  cities  is  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n48. \nSolid waste management operations are presently under the control of the chief health \nofficer, but guidelines by the Supreme Court in 2000 require that each city establish a dedicated \nDepartment  of  Solid  Waste  and  Industrial  Pollution  headed  by  a  technically  trained  director.   \nPrimary  and  secondary  collection  and  transportation  services  already  contracted  out  to  the \nprivate sector in some of the project cities, should be expanded.  But maximum efficiency and \ncost savings in waste recycling and disposal will occur only if collection, transportation, and final \ndisposal are under the same organization. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement and Second Generation Imprest Account (SGIA)  \n\n \n49. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook and  Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations,  LIBOR-Based Loan Products. \nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  and  to  expedite \nimplementation of the Project through the timely release of loan proceeds, a second generation \nimprest account (SGIA)10 will be opened  if the state government commits to fully adhere to the \nprescribed  procedures  as  agreed-upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  Under  the  SGIA,  the \ncontroller of aid accounts and audit (CAAA) will pass on the rupee equivalent of ADB\u2019s imprest \nadvance  to  the  EA  through  the  budgetary  mechanism.  The  EA  will  maintain  the  advance  in  a \nseparate commercial bank account and withdraw from it only the  eligible portion of expenditure. \nIn  the  event  a  SGIA  is  established,  it  will  be  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook and the detailed arrangements agreed to by \nthe Borrower and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed \nthe lesser of the equivalent of six months expenditures or 10% of loan amount. The initial and \nsubsequent amounts to be deposited in the SGIA will be determined by ADB in consultation with \nthe Borrower. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be adopted for reimbursing \nand  liquidating  SGIA  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000,  except  as  ADB  may \notherwise agree during project implementation. \n \n\n9. \n\n Accounts, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n50. \nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  obtaining  and  consolidating  relevant \ninformation  from  the  respective  PIUs.  The  progress  reports  will  describe  physical  progress, \n                                                 \n10 In India, second generation imprest accounts have been allowed for Gujarat Emergency Earthquake Rehabilitation \nProject (Loan 1826-IND) (1999) and Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project (Loan 1647-IND) (2001).  \nSupplementary Appendix H gives the detailed arrangements for SGIA. \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\ndetails  of  any  modification  required  to  the  project  implementation  schedule,  problems \nencountered, use of AIF and CIF, and an outline of the work for the next quarter. The report will \nalso provide summary financial accounts of the Project: expenditure during the quarter, year-to-\ndate  expenditure  during  the  quarter,  year-to-date  expenditure,  and  expenditure  to  date.  The \nPMU will also submit to ADB, within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, a project \ncompletion report that will cover the details of implementation, costs, monitoring and evaluation \nactivities, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n51. \nThe  PMU  and  the  PIUs  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  accounts  and  records  \nadequate to identify the incomes and expenditures related to the Project. They will be assisted \nby  an  adequate  number  of  suitably  qualified  accounting  staff  including  an  accounts  officer. \nDetailed  consolidated  annual  project  accounts,  as  maintained  by  the  PMU,  will  be  audited  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  9  months  of  the \nclose  of  the  fiscal  year.  The  annual  audit  report  will  include  the  audit  of  the  imprest  account, \nSGIA,  and  SOE  procedure,  and  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  SGIA  and  SOE \nprocedures. UADD and the six project city corporations have been made aware of ADB\u2019s policy \non  delayed  submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the \naudited accounts. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nThe  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS) \n52. \nis  established  and  undertaken  rests  with  the  PMU.    The  PPMS  has  numerous  categories  of \nmonitoring,  corresponding  to  development  activities  and  representing  the  direct  and  indirect \noutcomes expected from the Project.  The PPMS also defines the responsibility for monitoring, \nrecording, and reporting.  Certain tasks will be outsourced to external contractors; others form \npart of the routine reporting from the PIUs at the city level to the central PMU.  The indicators to \nbe monitored have been formulated and discussed with the state and municipal governments; \nthey  include  (i)  physical  progress  of  infrastructure  works,  (ii)  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building, and (iii) impact assessment indicators (Supplementary Appendix I). The PMU \nwill  conduct  initial  baseline  physical  and  socioeconomic  surveys  and  submit  a  detailed \nimplementation plan for monitoring performance and for preparing benchmarking information for \nADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness.  Thereafter, the PMU will \nsubmit annual monitoring and evaluation reports to ADB throughout project implementation. \n\n \n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n53. \nProject performance will be reviewed in a three-tier system.  First, the PMC will review \nprogress on each component and the performance of each city PIU. The review will take place \nin  the  first  10  days  of  the  month  for  the  previous  month\u2019s  performance.    Monthly performance \nreports will be prepared for each project city by the DSC and submitted to the PMU.  Based on \nthe  reviews,  the  PMC  will  suggest  changes  in  the  project  design  and  implementation,  or  refer \nthe issues to the EC through the PMU.  The review report will be sent to ADB, the EC, and the \ncity steering committees for necessary action.   \n \n54. \nThe EC will conduct the second tier review during its quarterly meetings.  The monthly \nproject performance reviews and major policy issues will be reviewed and actions to be taken by \nthe respective authorities will be recorded.  The results of the review will be circulated to ADB, \nUADD, and the project city corporations.  The third tier review will be conducted by ADB every 6 \nmonths, with the ADB Review Mission visiting project cities, to discuss major issues with UADD \nand  the  project  city  corporations  and  forward  their  opinion  for  action  at  the  state  government \nlevel.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n15\n\n \nThe  project  review  will  be  supplemented  by  a  formal  comprehensive  midterm  review\u2014 \n55. \nwith  the  participation  of  senior  Central  Government  and  state  officials  as  well  as  ADB  staff\u2014\nwhen  detailed  design  is  completed  and  major  contracts  have  been  awarded  and  started.  The \nreview will be held about 24 months after the loan effectiveness date.  It will critically evaluate \nactual project progress, implementation procedures, procurement methods, public relations and \ncommunity  awareness,  BME  activities,  and  the  performance  of  the  design  and  supervision \nconsultants.    Following  the  review,  corrective  measures,  as  appropriate,  will  be  introduced  to \nremedy any identified weaknesses. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nMajor Benefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\n \n56. \nThe  Project  will  address  in  an  integrated  manner  citywide  deficiencies in basic needs. \nDirect social benefits will be sustained improvements in water supply, sanitation, and garbage \ncollection and disposal within the project cities. Indirect benefits will be through improved living \nconditions,  a  healthier  living  environment,  and  the  prospect  of  improved  health  status  of  the \npopulation.  The  social  and  poverty  impact  of  the  Project  was  assessed  from  the  TA  baseline \nsocioeconomic  survey  of  benefits  and  costs,  which  apply  to  different  groups  of  the  population \nwithin  the  six  cities.    Overall,  the  survey  respondents  identified  lack  of  access  to  a  reliable  in-\nhouse  water  supply  as  the  foremost  deficiency.    Although  the  coverage  of  the  existing  water \ndistribution network in the project cities is as high as 85%, water pressure, and frequency and \nduration of supply are extremely low.  Therefore benefits from improved efficiency of the existing \nwater  supply  system  will  accrue  to  all  present  users.  In  addition,  almost  1  million  new \nconsumers will gain access to piped water supply by 2010. Poor households (estimated to be \n25% of the total urban population) outside slum settlements will be fully integrated into the new \nexpanded water supply system. Improved supply at slum boundaries is also an indirect benefit \nto  slum  settlements.  For  slum  dwellers  to  directly  benefit  from  the  Project,  additional \ninvestments are required to improve tertiary distribution within the settlements. For this purpose, \nalternative  water  supply  services  run  by  community  groups  will  be  considered.  Small-scale \nwater providers can play an important role in helping the poor in slum settlements connect to the \nedge  of  the  expanded  municipal  grid  system.  For  instance,  the  water  schemes  under  the  AIF \nwill  benefit  up  to  100,000  slum  dwellers  with  the  construction  of  tertiary  distribution  network \ninside the slum settlements. \n \n57. \nFrom  the  sanitation  component,  direct  benefits  will  be  obtained  by  households  that  will \nbe able to connect to the sewerage network. The network will be located in the densely built-up \nand developing areas of the city center. The percentage of the poor households in this area is \nslightly  below  the  citywide  average  of  25%.  An  underground  sewerage  network  will,  however, \nreach  the  boundaries  of  slum  areas  within  the  scheme  area  and  will  allow the construction of \nsewered community latrines that will benefit an estimated 4% of the poor households. The solid \nwaste component will operate on a citywide basis, with little difference in the standard of service \nwithin cities. The proportion of the poor beneficiaries is therefore the same as for each city as a \nwhole.    A  summary  of  the  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  10.  Since  the \nProject  will  focus  on  the  urban  area,  it  will  not  adversely  affect  indigenous  peoples  or  ethnic \nminorities. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n2. \n\nGender Impact \n\n \n58. \nA  fundamental  direct  benefit  of  the  water  supply  component  will  be  the  reduction  of \nwomen's work in fetching, storing, and using water.  The improved levels of water delivery and \naccessibility  will  reduce  the  overall  time for collecting water and the need for storage.  During \nthe  participatory  rapid  appraisal  exercise,  poor  women  cited  fetching  and  storing  water  for \ndomestic use as their second priority for improvement.  The topmost priority was toilets because \nnearly  half  of  poor  women  defacate  outdoors,  one  quarter  use  public  toilets,  and  the  rest  use \npay toilets.  Thus the provision of underground sewerage and community sanitation blocks will \nreduce  the  practice  of  defecating  outdoors,  which  is  not  only  inconvenient  but  a  cause  for \ninsecurity  especially  in  unlit  and  marginal  communities.    Drainage  facilities  and  improved \ngarbage collection citywide will bring indirect benefits of a healthier environment for women and  \na reduced work burden in the household.  During project implementation, a gender action plan \n(Supplementary  Appendix  J)  will  be  carried  out  to  promote  active  participation  of  women  in \nmunicipal management and project implementation as both beneficiaries and agents. \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n \n59. \nAll  the  project  components  have  a  strong  economic  rationale  since  they  provide \nminimum  acceptable  standards  for  basic  living  conditions  and  assist  in  removing  existing \nconstraints  on  social  development  and  economic  growth.    Similarly,  all  components  were \ndesigned  along  sound  principles  of  priority  need,  consultation  and  targeting,  and  demand \nmanagement  and  rehabilitation  before  new  investment.  They  represent  technically  feasible \noptions at the least cost. \n \n60. \nAll six investments for the water supply component are shown to be viable although the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) in the Indore scheme is lower at 13.3% than that in the \nother cities (ranging from 28.6% in Ujjain to 56.5% in Bhopal) because of the high capital and \noperating costs of pumping the treated water to a height of 550 meters from the river source for \ndelivery  to  the  city  over  a  distance  of  70  km.  In  Indore,  which  is  a  commercial  center  and  a \nthriving  city,  the  without-the-Project  situation  could  not  be  fully  reflected  in  the  valuation  of \nbenefits11(economic  analysis  is  in  Appendix  11).  For  sewerage/sanitation,  the  base  EIRRs  are \nhigher than the economic cost of capital in the project cities except Gwalior and Jabalpur. Solid \nwaste projects have a strong economic justification and, although the EIRR for Gwalior is shown \nto be marginal, the environmental benefits outweigh the risks of undertaking the project.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCost Recovery and Affordability  \n\n \n61. \nThe  current  financial  positions  of  the  project  cities  is  inadequate  to  continue system \nimprovement and increase service coverage, and also meet their share of counterpart funding \nand  debt  servicing.  Currently  applicable  taxes  and  fees  are  low  as  also  is  their  collection \nefficiency. A critical issue for the project cities in meeting financial commitments is their ability to \nraise resources. The Project aims to help the city corporations improve revenue generation from \nown  sources,  and  ensure  that  the  administration  and  O&M  costs  of  both  existing  and  project \nassets  are  adequately  covered.  The  financial  improvement  action  plan  (Appendix  12)  is \ndesigned to enable the project city corporations to raise resources under a time-bound program. \n\n                                                 \n11  The  contingent  valuation  method  based  on  willingness  to  pay  fails  to  quantify  the  benefit  of  providing  necessary \nwater to avoid crisis and ensure economic survival of the city. Without the proposed optimization under the Project, \nthe  nonrevenue  water  rate  will  go  up  as  high  as  70%  by  2010  and  the  water  supply  will  fall  below  40  lpcd.  This \nimplies water crisis and Indore will no longer be able to function as the trading and industrial capital of the state. \nThe  economic,  social,  and  poverty  impact  would  be  very  severe  indeed.  Other  benefits  of  piped  water  include \nenhanced health, which is not quantified in the EIRR calculation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n17\n\n \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  shows  a  willingness  to  pay  for  municipal  services.  An \n62. \naffordability  analysis,  based  on  proposed  tariffs  and  household  income  data  from  the  social \nsurvey, shows that the proposed tariffs for water supply and sewerage surcharge are within the \ngenerally acceptable limit of 4-5% of average household income. In the lower 20% households, \nthe tariffs are below 2%. The risk that the proposed tariffs are not affordable is minimal since the \ntariffs  are  within  the  affordability  limit  by  a  sufficient  margin.    In  addition,  to  enable  the  low-\nincome  households  (income  limit  to  be  fixed  in  consultation  with  ADB)  to  have  private \nconnections to the piped water supply and sewerage, the project city corporations will provide \nthese households with interest-free loans repayable over 12 months. \n \n63. \nFinancial  analysis  (Appendix  13)  assessed  the  viability  of  the  revenue-generating \ncomponents  of  the  Project.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  for  water  supply \nschemes  vary  between  18.5%  and  5.2%  and,  combined  with  sewerage  schemes,  between \n13.4% and 4.9%, which compares favorably with the 4.0% weighted average cost of capital in \nreal terms. Sensitivity tests indicate that the FIRR is more sensitive to decreased revenues and \ndelaying project benefits by 1 year.  \n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects  \n\n \nThe Project is an environmental category B project. An initial environmental examination \n64. \n(IEE) was carried out for each project city. The examinations show that adverse environmental \neffects will be limited and can be mitigated through integrated corrective measures. A detailed \nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. The examinations indicate that a safe, clean, \nreliable  water  supply  and  improved  sewage  and  waste  disposal  systems  in  urban  areas  will \nsignificantly  improve  public  health  and  environmental  conditions  in  the  project  cities.  The \nexisting  problems  of  polluted  pools  of  standing  water,  unpleasant  odors,  and  health  risks \nassociated  with  increased  quantities  of  wastewater  and  haphazard  garbage  disposal  will  be \nmitigated  or  eliminated  by  integrating  water  supply  with  improved  drainage  and  sanitation \nsystems, improved waste collection, and sanitary disposal as well as heightened public health \nawareness.  The  quality  of  life  and  community  health  profiles  of  the  project  cities  will  improve. \nThe  disposal  of  sludge  in  the  project  water  treatment  plants  will  be  improved  by  providing \nsettlement basins. \n \n65. \nThere  are  no  known  endangered  varieties  of  flora  or  species  of  fauna,  or  sites  of \nhistorical or cultural significance in the project areas that are likely to be affected. Land areas for \nthe  proposed  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management  have  been  developed  or \ndisturbed previously and have no forest or unusual vegetation cover. The major impacts of the \nproject  will  be  temporary,  including  those  on  health  and  safety  in  the  communities  during \nconstruction,  turbidity,  dust,  and  noise  generated  by  construction  equipment.  Environmental \ntraining will be offered to staff of the PMU and the PIUs to strengthen their capacities to address \nenvironmental  concerns  during  the  design  and  construction  phases  of  the  Project.  The \ncontractors will be required to prepare and implement their own management plans, and carry \nout construction in line with international standards. Another measure to be implemented as part \nof the Project is enforcement of regulations for treatment and discharge of industrial wastewater.  \nThe summary IEE is given in Appendix 14. \n \nB. \n \n66.  While  no  unusual  risks  are  foreseen  during  implementation,  the  potential  risks  concern \n(i)  sustainability  of  the  facilities  and  services  provided  under  the  Project;  (ii)  lack  of  suitably \nqualified personnel in the PIUs, which may eventually lead to weak implementation of individual \n\nMajor Risks and Safeguards \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\ninvestment components in each city; (iii) implementation delays due to slow progress in start-up \nactivities  (recruiting  consultants  and  setting  up  the  project  management  structure);  (iv)  timely \navailability  of  counterpart  funding  from  the  participating  municipalities;  and  (v)  inappropriate \nmanagement and accounting system of water works departments. \n \nFinancial  sustainability  of  the  project  investments  will  be  ensured  by  implementing  the \n67. \nfinancial  improvement  action  plan.    Some  project  cities  (Bhopal  and  Ratlam)  have  already \nraised water charges  and  others  are  also  required  to  pass  a  resolution  to  implement  the  plan \nwithin 1 month from loan effectiveness.  The issues related with project implementation will be \nfully  reviewed  and  dealt  with  through  the  Capacity  Building  TA.    To  avoid  delays  caused  by \nshortage of counterpart funds, it must be ensured that each municipal budget includes sufficient \namounts  to  cover  the  municipal  corporation\u2019s  share  of  the  annual  project  investment \nrequirement. Finally, the sustainability of water supply systems will depend to a large extent on \nthe establishment of an autonomous and accountable water and sanitation department in each \nmunicipality. For this purpose, project city corporations gave assurances that the water supply \nmanagement  improvement  plan  (Appendix  9)  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \nagreed-upon timetable.      \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n68. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Central Government, the state government, \nand  the  six  project  city  corporations  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  are \nincorporated in the legal documents: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  state  will  ensure  that  the  six  project  city  corporations  execute  the  financial \nimprovement  actions  in  accordance  with  the  agreed-upon  timetable  (Appendix \n12), including (a) revising water charges and introducing a progressive block rate \nwater  tariff;  (b)  reassessing  properties  and  revising  taxes;  (c)  introducing  a \nsewerage  surcharge;  and  (d)  improving  collection  efficiency.  There  will  be  no \namendments to the timetable without the prior consent of ADB.  \nThe  state  will  ensure  that  the  six  project  city  corporations  undertake  actions  to \nmeet  the  long-term  objective  of  improving  urban  water  supply  management  in \naccordance with the agreed-upon timetable (Appendix 9).   \nThe  state  will  ensure  that    (a)  each  of  the  six  project  corporations  prepares  an \ninitial  MAPP  within  1  year  after  loan  effectiveness  and  annually  thereafter  for \nsubmission  to  the  PMU  in  accordance  with  the  agreed-upon MAPP framework \n(Supplementary Appendix E);  (b) adequate allocations are made from the AIF to \nthe project city corporations, and from the CIF to the PIUs for community-based \nactivities,  in  each  case  only  for  approved  schemes  under  the  MAPP;  (c)  the \nquarterly reports prepared by the PMU include progress made and statements on \nthe  use  of  funds  under  AIF  and  CIF;  and  (d)  the  PMU  appraises  each  MAPP, \nincluding  the  schemes  funded  from  the  AIF  and  the  CIF,  annually  in  the  third \nquarter of each MAPP cycle. \nThe  state  will  ensure  that  the  gender  action  plan  as  set  out  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  J  is  implemented  and  that  the  PMU  prepares  field  manuals  and \nconducts training on the gender action plan for PMU and PIU staff.   \nThe  state  and  the  six  project  city  corporations  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  Project  is \ncarried out in accordance with the existing environmental laws and regulations of \nIndia  and  the  Environment  Policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (2002) and \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003);  (b)  all  monitoring  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n19\n\nin \n\nindicated \n\nfor  under \n\nIEE  and  provided \n\ntake  a  proactive  role \n\nmitigation  measures \nthe \nthe \nenvironmental  management  plan  are  undertaken  for  the  Project;  (c)  project \nimplementation will include consultation with local communities on environmental \nissues;  (d)  ULBs  will \nin  environmental  planning, \nmanagement, and monitoring; (e) State Pollution Control Board clearance will be \nobtained  for  all  applicable  project  components  before  starting  work  on  those \ncomponents; and (f) existing waste disposal sites that have reached full capacity \nwill be properly sealed after 3 months of operation of the new sanitary landfills. \n The state will ensure that (a) project components are designed so as to minimize \nresettlement; and (b) if, during detailed design of project components, involuntary \nresettlement  arises  from  land  acquisition  or  temporary  disruption  of  income \ngeneration, a resettlement plan will be prepared and implemented in accordance \nwith government laws and procedures, ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, \nand  the  Project\u2019s  agreed-upon  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework \n(Supplementary  Appendix  F).  Based  on  the  final  engineering  designs,  the  state \nwill update and revise the resettlement plan and submit this for ADB\u2019s review and \napproval  before  civil  works  contracts  are  awarded.  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the \nresettlement  plan  will  be  a  condition  for  awarding  civil  works  contracts.  All  land \nrequired  for  a  project  component,  including  any  that  may  entail  involuntary \nresettlement, will be acquired not later than 12 months after loan effectiveness; if \nnot,  the  component  will  be  eliminated  from  the  Project  unless  ADB  agrees \notherwise. The state will cause the short resettlement plan relating to the sewage \ntreatment plant in Jabalpur to be implemented. \nThe state will cause the EC to be established and the first meeting held within 3 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(x) \n\n (ix) \n\n(viii)  The state will ensure that each project city corporation establishes a city steering \ncommittee and that the first meeting is held within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe  state  will  ensure  that  the  route  of  the  proposed  water  supply  transmission \npipeline from Narmada River to Indore is within the existing right-of-way, with no \nnew  acquisition  of  forest  or  other  land,  unless  identified  as  necessary  during \ndetailed project design.  \nThe  state  will  ensure  that  Indore  and  Ujjain  city  corporations  are  allowed  to  \ndischarge  and  treat  sewage  in  the  sewage  treatment  plants  constructed  under \nthe  centrally  sponsored  schemes  before  awarding  the  sewerage  network \ncontracts.  \nThe state will ensure that Ratlam obtains permission from the Water Resources \nDepartment (WRD) for drawing an additional 9 million litres per day (Mld) of raw \nwater  from  Dhulawad  Dam  for  the  water  supply  augmentation  scheme  before \nawarding the contract for the scheme.   \nThe  state  will  ensure  that  the  project  city  corporations  adopt  ADB's  approved \nstandard  bidding  documents,  evaluation  criteria  and  procedures  for  awarding \ncontracts  for  all  procurement  contracts  under  the  Project  and  before  any \nprocurement.  \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xiii)  The state will ensure that project city corporations maintain a facility for providing \nfinancial  assistance  to  low-income  households  (income  limit  will  be  fixed  in \nconsultation with ADB) to ensure connection to the water and sewer systems.  \n\n(xiv)  The  state  will  endeavor  that  the  project  city  corporations  regularly  pay  their \nelectricity  bills  to  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board  and  will  not \naccumulate any new arrears starting FY2005. \nThe state will ensure that a system for audit of accounts by external auditors is \nintroduced for the six project cities.  The external auditors will complete the audit \nof  FY2004  accounts  of  the  project  city  corporations  by  31  December  2004. \n\n(xv) \n\n \n\n\fThereafter,  the  audits  will  be  completed  annually  within  9  months  of  each  year-\nend. \n\n(xvi)  The state will allocate, and will ensure that the project city corporations allocate, \nadequate  amounts  in  their  annual  budget  to  meet  their  respective  investment \nrequirements in accordance with the disbursement schedule in each project city. \n\n(xvii)  The  state  will  cause  each  project  city  corporations  to  prepare  and  submit  a \nresolution  to  its  municipal  council  to  execute  the  Financial  Improvement  Action \nPlan  in  accordance  with  the  agreed-upon  timetable,  within  1  month  from  loan \neffectiveness. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n(i) \n\n \n\nThe onlending agreements between the state and each project city corporation \n(by which the state will onlend to the six project cities the proceeds of the loan), \nwill  have  been  executed  and  delivered  and  will  have  become  effective  and \nlegally binding upon the parties thereto in accordance with their terms. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n69. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $200,000,000  to  India  for  the  Urban \nWater Supply and Environmental Improvement in Madhya Pradesh Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nTadao Chino \n\n      President \n \n\n17 November 2003 \n \n\n20\n\n \n\n \nB. \n \n\n \n\n\fDesign Summary \n\nIndicators and Targets \n\nKey Assumptions \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n21 \n\nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n\n \n \nNational and state \nstatistics  \n \nMonitoring and \nevaluation reports \n(PMU) \n \nADB review \nmission reports  \n \nPCR \n \nSpecific surveys  \n \n \n \n\n \n \nMonitoring and \nevaluation reports \n(PMU) \n \nADB review \nmission reports  \n \nPCR \n \nQuarterly progress \nreports (PMU) \n \nMonitoring and \nevaluation reports \n(PMU) \n \nADB review \nmission reports  \n \nPCR \n \nQuarterly progress \nreports (PMU) \n \n\n \n \nVision: The project cities \ndevelop a long-term vision \non sustainable urban \ndevelopment through \nparticipatory consultation. \n \nImplementation of the \nrecommendations of the \nState Finance Commission: \nState government will \ncontinue to implement \ndecentralization and \ndevolution of authority and \nresources to local \ngovernments. \n \nDemocratic participation: \nEach city will be governed \nwith active participation of \nelected representatives and \nstakeholders. \n \n \nAvailability of adequate \ncounterpart funds to meet \nthe investment requirement \nfor basic urban \ninfrastructure \n \nWillingness of beneficiaries \nto pay for proper \nmanagement, maintenance \nand operation of \ninfrastructure facilities  \n \nPolitical will to devolve more \nfinancial resources and \ndecision-making authority \nfrom state to urban local \nbodies  \n \nAvailability of adequate \ntraining opportunities for \nelected officials and \nmunicipal staff \n\n \n\n \n\nGoal \n \nSustainable economic \ngrowth and poverty \nreduction in 6 largest \nmunicipal corporations \nof Madhya Pradesh \n  \n\n \n \nFaster and sustained economic \ngrowth \n \nReduced urban poverty  \n \nImproved urban environmental \nconditions  \n \nEnhanced human development \nopportunities  \n\nObjectives \n \n1.

Before \nindependence, Bhopal was just a small town but  it grew very quickly after 1956, largely due to \nits designation as the state's capital city.  Located roughly in the middle of the state and in the \nEast-West  corridor,  connectivity  by  rail,  road,  and  air  is  reasonably  good.  The  city  is  situated \nbeside two lakes and is divided into two distinct parts, old Bhopal and new Bhopal.  In addition \nto its public sector role, Bhopal is a center of education and engineering among other industries \nand is also developing as a center for trade. The city became known internationally in 1984 as a \nresult of the Union Carbide industrial accident.  Aftermath of the incident, new Bhopal has been \ndeveloped with the support of the state government.  \n \nGwalior  the  fourth  largest  city,  has  its  origin  as  a  princely  state.  It  was  previously the \n2. \ncapital of Scindia State and is located north of the state on the Agra-Mumbai highway.  It is a \nhistoric  city  and  boasts  a  dramatic  hilltop  fort,  built  more  than  1,000  years  ago.    It  has \ntraditionally been an important seat of learning and culture.  As with many cities, recent years \nhave seen the decline of traditional industries\u2014mainly cotton manufacture\u2014and the closure of \nhalf  of  the  city\u2019s  large  industrial  units  and  many  smaller  units  within  the  city  boundaries.  Two \nnew  industrial  estates  developed  outside  the  city  have  been  reasonably  successful.    The  city \nhas  been  declared  a  counter  balance  city  of  the  National  Capital  Region  (NCR)  and  is \ndeveloping plans to capitalize on this, but the counter balance function has yet to develop.  On \nthe other side of the city, the Indian Air Force base limits expansion to the northwest.   \n \n3. \nIndore is the largest city in the state and is the business and trading capital.  Located at \nthe crossroads of western and central India, Indore has relatively good connectivity by road, rail, \nand  air.    Historically,  Indore  was  always  a  trading  center,  particularly  for  foodstuffs,  and  has \nbeen the hub of trade and commerce, not only for the state, but also for western India. Since the \ndecline of its traditional industries including textiles, the economic base of Indore has changed \nconsiderably.  The city holds a dominant position in wholesale trading and as a transshipment \ncenter for the surrounding regions.  Trade and commerce, the financial sector, and new higher \ntech companies have come to replace the older industries. \n \nJabalpur is the third largest city in the state.  Located east of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur \n4. \nlies within the East-West corridor.  It is on the main rail route from Allahabad to Mumbai and the \ndivisional  headquarters  of  the  central  railway  are  located  here.    Jabalpur  has  a  public-sector-\ndominated economic base.  Four large defense industries and many state capital type functions \nincluding  the  High  Court,  State  Electricity  Board,  and  Department  of  Telecommunications \ntraining institute are located in the city.  The Jabalpur region boasts large mineral reserves and \nmining  is  a  well-established  activity.    The  area  is  also  one  of  natural  beauty  with  many \necotourism type attractions within reach of the city. \n \n5. \nRatlam  is  the  smallest  of  the  project  cities  and  still  retains  its  rural  character.    Like \nGwalior,  it  originated  as  the  capital  of  a  princely  state.    Ratlam  is  located  in  the  East-West \ncorridor, on the main Delhi-Mumbai highway and railroad.  The city has grown as an important \nrailway junction on the Delhi-Mumbai line and as a service city for the surrounding hinterland for \nwholesale  trading  in  agriculture  commodities  and  other  agriculture-related  activities.    Railway \nemployees  constitute  the  majority  of  the  workforce  (around  19,000)  and,  together  with \ngovernment  employees  and  their  families,  account  for  about  half  the  city  population.    Recent \nyears  have  seen  the  closure  of  an  estimated  80%  of  industry,  including  the  only  large  factory \n(soya bean), and most medium-size units in the city.  In contrast to the fortunes of agriculture-\nrelated  activity,  Ratlam  is  famous  for  its  manufacture  of  golden  ornaments  and  jewelry  and \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nthese  activities  appear  to  be  thriving.    Service-related  activities  for  the  local  population  and \ntransport-related activity are the mainstays of the city\u2019s economy. \n \n6. \nUjjain,  once  the  seat  of  the  ancient  kingdom  of  Vikramaditya,  is  an  important  religious, \neducational, and cultural center and a destination of millions of Hindu pilgrims.  Besides regular \nvisitors (about 200,000-300,000 per year), once every 12 years there is a flood of devotees to \nthe  city  (an  estimated  5  million  in  2004).    About  an  hour  by  road  from  Indore,  the  city,  once \nimportant for cotton manufacture, has suffered considerable decline.  All four of the cotton mills \nclosed over 10 years ago and there is little alternative for the 7,000 strong workforce retrenched.  \nReligious  tourism,  services  for  the  local  population,  and  some  small-scale industries including \npower and hand looms and packaging are the mainstays of the city\u2019s economy. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nProject \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN SECTOR \n \n\nYear \nApproved \n \n1992 \n1992 \n1994 \n1994 \n\nA.

Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a National Priority \nin Country Poverty Analysis?   \n\nYes \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Partnership Agreement?   \n\nNot \navailable \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Madhya Pradesh:  \n\nThe Asian Development Bank's (ADB) poverty reduction strategy defines poverty as a deprivation of essential assets to \nwhich  every  human  is  entitled.  The  strategy  includes  access to water, sanitation, and other basic services, as well as \nemployment income and wages, as measures of poverty.  The assessment of the prevailing situation in India, Madhya \nPradesh, and the project cities has revealed the poor quality of the urban environment infrastructure and a demonstrable \ngap in the provision of basic services, to the poor in particular. \n \nThe Project will address deficiencies of basic needs citywide in an integrated manner. Direct benefits will be sustained \nimprovements  in  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  six  project  cities.  Indirect  benefits  will  be \nthrough  improved  living  conditions,  a  healthier  living  environment,  and  the  prospect  of  improved  health  status  of  the \npopulation.  The  poverty  impact  of  the  Project  was  assessed  from  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA) \nbaseline socioeconomic survey in terms of benefits and costs, which apply to different groups of the population the six \ncities.    Overall,  the  survey  respondents  identified  lack  of  access  to  a  reliable  in-house water supply as the foremost \ndeficiency.  Although  the  coverage  of  the  existing  water  distribution  network  in  the  six  cities  is  as  high  as  85%,  water \npressure, and the frequency and duration of supply are extremely poor.  Therefore, benefits of improved efficiency of the \nexisting  water  supply  system  will  accrue  to  all  existing  users,  including  the  poor.  In  addition,  almost  1  million  new \nconsumers will gain access to piped water supply by 2010. While the poor households (estimated to be  25% of the total \nurban  population)  outside  slum  settlements  will  be  fully  integrated  into  the  new  expanded  water  supply  system,  the \nbenefits to slum settlements will be initially indirect in terms of improved supply at the slum boundaries. For the slum \ndwellers to directly benefit from the Project, additional investments are required to improve tertiary distribution within the \nslum  settlements.  For  instance,  the  water  schemes  under  the  AIF  will  benefit  up  to  100,000  slum  dwellers,  which  is \nabout 7% of the total slum population.  \n \nDirect  benefits  from  the  sanitation  component  will  be  obtained  by  households  that  will  be  able  to  connect  to  the \nsewerage network. The network will be in the densely built-up and developing areas of the city center. The percentage of \npoor  households  in  this  area  is  slightly  below  the  citywide  average  of  the  poor  households  (25%).  The  underground \nsewerage  network  will,  however,  reach  the  boundaries  of  slum  areas  within  the  scheme  area  and  this  will  enable  the \nprovision  of  sewered  community  latrines  that  will  benefit  an  estimated  4%  of  the  poor  households.  The  solid  waste \ncomponent will operate citywide with little difference in the standard of service within cities. The proportion of the poor \nbeneficiaries is therefore the same for each city as a whole.  \nB. \nIndia\u2019s  urban  population  of  about  285  million  is  expected  to  almost  double  to  550  million  over  the  next  20  years,  an \naverage addition of more than 11 million new urban residents each year. The incidence of poverty in India remains high \nalthough both the absolute numbers and proportion of people living below the poverty line are falling. The proportion of \nthe  total  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  in  2001  is  estimated at 26% or a population of 268 million. In urban \nareas, the population below the poverty line is estimated at 24%, or about 67 million, slightly better than in rural areas. \n \nIn  Madhya  Pradesh,  the  estimated  urban  population  below  the  poverty  line  was  38% in 2000, much higher than the \nnational  average  of  24%.    Urban  poverty,  however,  dropped  faster  than  rural  poverty  between  1994  (44%)  and  2000 \nand, as a result, the incidence of poverty is now lower in urban areas than in rural villages, where 44% of the population \nstill live below the poverty line. Among the urban poor, the slum population, counted for the first time during the 2001 \nCensus,  totaled  more  than  2.3  million,  representing  24%  of  the  urban  population,  which  is  slightly  higher  than  the \nnational average of 21%.  \n \nOther than these primary data published by the Central Government, there is very little state-level data that can support \nan analysis of vulnerability among the urban poor. Almost no secondary data exist, which can permit an analysis of other \ndimensions of urban poverty, particularly health, social capital, and gender disparity. To fill up such data gap, a baseline \nsocioeconomic  survey  covering  a  total  of  9,600  households  was  undertaken  during  the  TA.  The  survey  was \ncomplemented by a series of participatory exercises including participatory rapid appraisal, focus group discussions, and \nmunicipal workshops. \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nThe  social  and  poverty  analysis  using  the  survey  data  has  shown  widespread  deficiencies  in  basic  urban  services \nacross  the  six  cities.  On  average,  42.3%  of  households  do  not  have  an  in-house water connection and 15.1% do not \nhave  access  to  piped  water;  over  40%  receive  water  only  on  alternate  days;  18.8%  do  not  have  a  private  toilet  and \nmembers  of  one  in  eight  households  defecate  outdoors;  32%  report  flooding  problems  and  40%  are  not  served  by \ncollection  of  solid  waste.  As  a  result,  the  potential  for  waterborne  and  bacterial  diseases  is  high,  particularly  among \nchildren. Last year,14.6% of the households reported an incidence of diarrhea in the family.  \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nchildren. Last year,14.6% of the households reported an incidence of diarrhea in the family.  \n\nOn  almost  all  measures,  poor  households  in  the  six  cities  fare  less  well  than  average.  Furthermore  core  poor \nhouseholds  (those  living  much  below  the  poverty  level)  fare  very  much  worse.  For  example,  the  percentage  of  poor \nhouseholds whose members defecate outdoors rose from 30% to over 50% of core poor households. The incidence of \ndiarrhea  is  generally  higher  among  the  poor,  rising  to  one  third  of  core  poor  households  in  Bhopal  and  one  half  in \nJabalpur.  Income  levels  of  households  below  the  poverty  level  are  between  one  fifth  and  a  third  of  nonpoor  incomes. \nNonpoor households spend around 75% of their monthly incomes, households below the poverty level around 90%, and \ncore poor households over 100%. Common contributory factors are high dependency, informal employment, poor health \nleading to low incomes, low savings, high indebtedness, poor living conditions with low access to good shelter and basic \nurban services. \n\nBenefits to poor \n\nGender benefits  \n\nand \n\nsystem) \n\ndrainage \n\ninfrastructure \n\nPhysical Infrastructure \nPoor  people  will  have  better  access  to  quality  urban \n(water  supply,  sewage  and  sanitation, \nservices \ngarbage \nin \ncollection \nunderserved and previously unserved areas. \n \nProvision  of  physical \n(under  Area \nImprovement  Fund  [AIF]  and  Community  Initiatives \nFund [CIF]) in selected slums (82) will benefit 100,000 \npopulation, especially the poor living in them. \n \nDuring  the  construction  period,  the  project  investment \nfor  5,000 \nwill  generate  employment  opportunities \npersons over a period of 3 years across six cities. \nUrban Governance \nBuilding the capacity of the poor in participatory micro-\nplanning and area improvement is ensured through the \nMunicipal  Action  Plan  for  Poverty  Reduction  (MAPP) \nprogram supported by AIF in selected slums.  \n \nThe  poor  living  in  slums  selected  through  the  MAPP \nprocess  will  receive  funds  from  CIF  for  implementing \ncommunity-identified  social  sector  and  nonphysical \ninitiatives  aimed  at  poverty  reduction,  e.g.  community \nfacilities, education, and income-generating schemes.   \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder Analysis Prepared \n\nWomen's  role  in  project  design  and  implementation  will \nincrease as indicated in Gender Action Plan. \n \nWomen  will  experience  greater  convenience,  healthier \nenvironment, and reduced burden in collecting water, garbage \ncollection, and sanitation. \n \nEmployment  opportunities  in  construction  activity  during \nproject  implementation  will  give  equal  wages  to  men  and \nwomen. \n \nArea  improvement  schemes  will  be  implemented  using  30% \nwomen laborers. \n\nrepresentatives \n\nWomen \nfrom  communities,  community \ndevelopment societies (CDS), res ident community volunteers \n(RCVs)  in  the  project  areas  will  receive  training  in  urban \nplanning and management through the MAPP process. \n \nLocal  women \nincreasingly \nparticipate  in  planning  and  implementing  area  improvement \nschemes and CIF in priority slums. \n\nincluding  CDS/RCVs  will \n\nYes \n\nThe consultative process covered three main stakeholder groups: governments, residential communities, and business \ncommunity.  Governments  include  the  city  governments,  state  departments,  and  political  leaders.  Residential \ncommunities  were  consulted  through  rapid  participatory  appraisal  and  a  socioeconomic  survey.  The  survey  was \nundertaken in two parts: the first covered 10,000 households in the six project cities and collected baseline information \nincluding perceptions and delivery of urban services; the second covered 2,400 households in the six cities and focused \non  consumer  behavior  and  attitudes  to  ward  the  proposed  projects  and  willingness  to  pay.  Focus  group  discussions \nwere  also  held  with  citywide  stakeholders.    The  business  community  was  consulted  through  chambers  of  trade  and \nleading representatives of businesses, relevant government departments including the District Industry Department and \nAKVN (the government agency for industrial parks and economic zones). Visits to cities and out-of-city industrial sites \nwere also made. With the help of the Chamber of Indian Industry (CII), a business consultation survey was undertaken \nincluding group consultations. Finally, individual surveys of 300 enterprises were carried out covering private and public \nsector services. \n\nParticipation Strategy \n\nYes \n\nPublic consultation/participation has been a feature of the project design thus far, and this will continue through detailed \ndesign,  and,  where  possible,  planning,  implementation,  operation,  and  maintenance.  A  major  feature  of  the  capacity-\nbuilding components is to enable the corporations to adopt a more participatory approach to urban development. This \nwill  commence  with  detailed  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  the  Project.  Support  to  the  implementation \narrangements  includes  provision  for  social  and  community  development  experts  within  the  PMO  and  project \nimplementation  units  and  for  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to  conduct community awareness programs (i) to \nexplain the project activities; (ii) to serve as ongoing consultation mechanism, particularly with regard to service charges \nand  fees;  (iii)  to  launch  community  education  programs  on  health  and  hygiene  and  water  use  management; and (iv) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n41 \n\n \n\nand  fees;  (iii)  to  launch  community  education  programs  on  health  and  hygiene  and  water  use  management; and (iv) \nprovide a liaison channel allowing communication on concerns and complaints on any issues arising during construction, \nsuch as disruption or damage.  Ongoing consultation and participatory monitoring will help ensure that project elements \nmeet  the  needs  of  the  community,  contributing  to  their  sustainability.  The  consultations  can  take  the  form  of  annual \nsurveys  by  consumer  category,  combined  with  community  forums  or  focus  group  discussions.  Media  for  public \ninformation mechanisms will include local television, radio, newsletters, web sites, and community meetings.  \n\nPotential Issues \n\nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \nNonsignificant/ \nUncertain \n\nResettlement  \n  \n\nGender  \n \n \n\nAffordability  \n \n\nNonsignificant \n\nLabor \n \n\nIndigenous \nPeople \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nThe complete land acquisition and resettlement implications of \nthe project are not certain. In 5 of the 6 cities, the resettlement \neffects  are  insignificant  involving  mostly  unused  government \nland  and  requiring  temporary  relocation  of  roadside  vendors \nduring pipe laying in road corridors. The precise impact of this \nrelocation  will  not  be  known  until  the  detailed  design  stage. \nConstruction of sewage treatment plant in Jabalpur will require \nacquisition of 30 hectares of private land, but the resettlement \neffects  will  be  insignificant.  In  Indore,  the  site  for  solid  waste \ndisposal has not been identified and may involve the purchase \nof  private  land  and  possible  resettlement  of  households  or \nlivelihoods.  Since,  the  site  is  not  yet  determined,  it  is  not \npossible  to  prepare  a  resettlement  plan.  However,  provision \nhas  been  made  within \nsupport \narrangements (Part C) for a resettlement expert within the PSU \nand for NGOs to complete a full or short plan, if needed, and to \nwork with the persons affected by temporary relocation. \n\nimplementation \n\nthe \n\nstakeholders in project design and implementation. They are \nexpected to be target beneficiaries of the AIF and CIF and of \nthe capacity-building components. Monitoring and evaluation \nsystems will contain gender-disaggregated information to track \nthe gender impact of the project. \nThe  potential  negative  impact  of  water  tariff  increases  on  the \npoor  is  considered  acceptable  at  less  than  4-5% of household \nincome,  and  given  that  they  pay  a  higher  proportion  than \naverage  of  their  incomes  on  water  at  present.  Consumption-\nbased  tariffs  will  have  a  greater  charge  on  high-consuming, \nlikely higher-income, households. The same principle applies to \nthe sewerage component, which is surcharged on water bills.  \nConnection  charges  for  water  and  sewerage  will  require \nsubsidy  from  the  corporations  for  families  below  the  poverty \nline. \nNo  job  loss  will  occur.

The  basic  assumptions  follow: (i) capital \nand  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  were  apportioned  into  traded  and  nontraded \ncomponents  and  labor;  (ii)  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  financial  prices  as  reduced  by \nduties and taxes were converted to economic prices by a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 for \nthe traded-cost component and 1.0 for the nontraded cost component; (iii) a conversion factor of \n0.75 is used for the cost of unskilled labor to reflect the real market value of labor, based on the \nrelationship  between  the  regulatory  minimum  wage  and  reported  actual  rates  received  by \nunskilled  workers;  (iv)  the  conversion  factor  for  power  is  assumed  to  be  1.7,  based  on  the \nestimated  economic  price  of  high  tension  power  in  Madhya  Pradesh\u2014Rs5.0/kilowatt  (kW)\u2014  \nand the unit price of Rs2.9/kW assumed in the financial cost estimation; and (v) O&M costs are \nsplit into fixed and variable costs.   \n \n2. \nConsideration of alternatives and preference for least-cost solutions are one of the main \ndesign  principles  of  the  Project.  Assessment  covered  a  mix  of  technical,  social,  and \nenvironmental as well as financial considerations.  For the water supply component, alternatives \nincluded (i) groundwater versus surface water\u2014surface water is preferred as Madhya Pradesh \nis  semiarid  and  recharge  is  not  assured;  (ii)  different  water  sources\u2014considerations included \ndistance, yield, sustainability, and transmission cost; and (iii) water treatment processes \u2014rapid \nsand filter is preferred to slow sand filtration. In all cases the most technically appropriate and \nleast-cost solution was selected.  \n \n3. \nFor  the  sewerage/sanitation  component,  alternatives  considered  for  the  proposed \nreticulated systems included combined versus separate systems; network choices of pumping \nversus gravity, size of  pipe  and  routing;  and  larger  geographic  areas.    Separate  systems  and \nnetwork  choices  of  gravity  were  selected  primarily  due  to  lower  cost.    For  sewage  treatment \nplants,  alternative  processes  and  sites  were  considered.    Waste  stabilization  ponds  were \nchosen  on  grounds  of  the  least  capital  requirement  and  operational  costs  although  the  land \nrequirement is higher.  \n \n4. \nAlternative  processes  for  municipal  waste  disposal  were  considered  based  on  the \nanalysis  of  composition  in  each  city.  The  processes  included  incineration,  turning  waste  to \nenergy,  composting,  and  sanitary  landfill.    The  composition  of  the  waste  stream  in  the  project \ncities  is  not  appropriate  for  direct  incineration  or  waste-to-energy  schemes  as  it  has  a  low \ncarbon and combustible quality and the moisture content is too high, especially in the monsoon \nseason.  Composting is feasible but requires the segregation of appropriate organic sources of \nwaste material, preferably at source, plus the development of a market for the final product.  As \nwaste  collection  processes  improve  under  the  Project,  composition  is  likely  to  change,  but  a \nsanitary landfill is the only technical and economically viable option in the near future. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Further details are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nB. \n \n\nWater Supply \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n43 \n\nDemand for Water \n\n1. \n \nIn  the  cities  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  as  in  many  other  cities  in  India,  the  very  concept  of \n5. \ndemand is not well understood because consumption is determined through supply constraints \nand not by demand management.  Most of all, water supply is available for at best a few hours a \nday, and at worst, less than once a day on alternate days during the dry season.  There is no \nresidential  metering,  users  pay  a  fixed  charge  and  a  very  high  proportion  of  them  do  not  pay. \nWhat  is  worse,  there  are  thousands  of  illegal  connections  for  which  no  charge  is  levied,  but \nthere is no information about the actual number of those connections. Unfortunately, no cities in \nIndia,  have  recently  undergone  improvements  to  the  water  supply  system  similar  to  those \nproposed under the Project.  Data from other large cities show rather high water consumption:  \nCalcutta (202 liters per capita per day [lpcd]), Delhi (209 lpcd), and Mumbai (178 lpcd).  \n \n6. \nThe  Government\u2019s  guidelines  on  minimum  standards  for  the  design  of  water  supply \nnetworks  includes  135  lpcd  in  large  cities  where  sewerage  is  planned  and  70  lpcd  without  a \nsewerage network. While these figures are obviously not an estimate of demand, they reflect an \nunderstanding of consumption patterns in India, as well as guidelines on health and sanitation \nstandards.  For  economic  analysis,  the  following  assumptions  were  made  based  on  the \nsocioeconomic survey carried out under the TA2 and the volume of water required for health and \nsanitation purposes: (i) for 2003, 100 lpcd for in-house connections and 75 lpcd for stand posts; \n(ii) for those with no piped water supply, a minimum of 40 lpcd throughout the project period; (iii) \nincome  elasticity  of  0.5  and  price  elasticity  of  \u20130.23;  and  (iii) real income increases of 2% per \nyear. Under these assumptions, the demand for water by 2021 is estimated at 147 lpcd.  \n \n \n \nContingent  valuation  was  used  in  assessing  economic  benefits.  It  involves  asking \n7. \nrespondents  how  much  they  would  be  willing  to  pay  for  a  set  of  circumstances.  The  main \ndrawback of this technique is that, for the results to be meaningful, respondents need to have a \ngood  perception  of  the  without-Project  situation  so  that  their  responses  address  the  actual \nimpact  of  the  Project.  The  reality  is  that  this  method  may  seriously  underestimate  economic \nbenefits  since  it  uses  unit  rate  for  incremental  water  that  does  not  fully  take  into  account  the \nwithout-Project  situation.    The  incremental  benefit  of  providing  enough  water  to  avoid  a  water \ncrisis and ensure economic survival is much higher than is reflected by the simple willingness to \npay revealed by individual households.   \n \n8. \nThe main difficulty associated with economic analysis was lack of data as to how much \nwater  actually  reaches  consumers  or  even  how  much  is  produced.  There  is  no  concept  of \nmetering or water volumes at the household level. Notwithstanding these difficulties, economic \nanalysis considers the period 2003\u20132021 for without-Project, optimization only, and with-Project \nsituations.  It  gives  estimates  of  incremental  and  nonincremental  water  based  on  engineering \ninformation  as  well  as \nincremental  and \nnonincremental volumes for new and current customers.    \n\nthe  socioeconomic  survey,  and  calculates \n\nEconomic Benefits and Valuation \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n2  The  survey  covered  current  consumption,  consumer  behavior  with  respect  to  water  consumption,  and  attitudes \ntoward the proposed Project. For water consumption, households were asked to estimate their consumption for 12 \ndifferent  water  use  activities.  The  results  show  a  relatively  low  level  of  current  consumption\u2014around  60  lpcd. \nSatisfaction with the current supply is surprisingly high, given the poor availability of water; this may reflect the low \nexpectation and general acceptance that current service is as good as can be expected. \n\n3  Given that during the early years of the Project, the majority of the consumers will be switching to either a metered \n\nsupply from a stand post or a fixed charge, price elasticity is not incorporated until after 2010. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n9. \nTable  A11.1  summarizes  the  economic  internal  rate  o  return  (EIRRs)  for  the  water \nsupply  component.    For  the  Project  to  be  viable,  the  EIRR  should  exceed  the  Economic \nOpportunity Cost of Capital.  All six water projects are shown to be viable.  Five of the EIRRs \nare particularly robust.  Under sensitivity tests, the EIRR in Indore slips below the 12% hurdle \nrate.  Unlike in other cities, the EIRR in Indore is sensitive to increase in O&M costs. This is due \nto  the  high  cost  of  electricity  to  pump  raw  water  from  the  intake  to  almost  600  meters  to  the \ntreatment plant. Reducing in nontechnical losses is also essential to make the project viable in \nIndore.  \n \n10. \nIn  interpreting  the  outcomes  of  economic  analysis  for  Indore,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the \nwithout-Project situation is not fully reflected in the valuation of benefits; as a result the benefits, \nparticularly  the  indirect  benefits,  are  likely  to  be  undervalued.    In  particular,  the  contingent \nvaluation  method  based  on  the  measure  of  willingness  to  pay  does not quantify the benefit of \nproviding necessary water to avoid a crisis and ensure the economic survival of the city. Without \nthe proposed optimization under the Project, however, the nonrevenue water rate will go up to \nas high as 70% by 2010 and the water supply will fall below 40 lpcd. This signals the onset of a \nwater crisis and Indore will no longer be able to function as a trading and industrial capital of the \nstate. The economic, social, and poverty impact would be very severe indeed. For this reason, \nunder sensitivity tests, the EIRR of the Indore water supply scheme is estimated to be as high \nas 16.5% if the benefit of avoiding a water crisis is taken into account4.  \n \n\nTable A11.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return for Water Supply (%) \n \n\nCity \n\nEIRR/SV  Base Case  \n\nNo Reduction in   \nNontechnical Losses \n\nBenefits \nDelayed         \nby 1 Year \n\nBhopal \n\nGwalior \n\nIndore \n\nJabalpur \n\nRatlam \n\nUjjain \n\nEIRR   \nSV \nEIRR   \nSV \n\nEIRR   \nSV \n\nEIRR   \nSV \n\nEIRR   \nSV \n\nEIRR   \nSV \n\n56.5 \n\n30.6 \n\n13.3 \n\n66.4 \n\n39.8 \n\n28.6 \n\nCapital \nCost \n(+10%) \n51.2 \n84.0 \n28.3 \n80.0 \n\n11.7 \n8.0 \n\n60.7 \n95.0 \n\n36.2 \n77.0 \n\n26.9 \n97.0 \n\nO&M \nCost \n(+10%) \n56.3 \n>100 \n30.6 \n>100 \n\n11.5 \n7.2 \n\n66.1 \n>100 \n\n39.6 \n>100 \n\n28.4 \n>100 \n\n31.6 \n\n25.4 \n\n11.8 \n\n59.8 \n\n36.3 \n\n21.4 \n\n39.2 \n\n24.8 \n\n8.3 \n\n45.7 \n\n30.0 \n\n23.7 \n\nSewerage and Sanitation \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; O&M = operation and maintenance; SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC. \n \nThe benefits of the sewerage and sanitation components are primarily public health and \n11. \nenvironmental  improvement.

Residential  and  business \nsurveys  showed  that  people  were  concerned  about  the  quality  of  the  urban  environment \nresulting  from  poor  solid  waste  management.      Across  all  cities,  71%  of  the  respondents  said \nthey  were  willing  to  pay  for  improvements  to  solid  waste  management.  Results also showed \nthat the willingness to pay of the poorest 20% was often higher than that of the higher income \ncategories.  This reflects what the poor expressed during the focus group discussions. The poor \nrated  solid  waste  management  high  in  their  priority  needs,  most  likely  because  they  are  the \nones that suffer the direct consequences of lack of good service. \n \nFor  most  of  the  solid  waste  components,  the  EIRR  exceeds  the  12%  economic \n14. \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  (Table  A11.3).    Although  the  EIRR  for  Gwalior  is  marginal,  the \nunquantified  environmental  benefits  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  risks  of  undertaking  the \nproject. \n \n\nTable A11.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return for Solid Waste Management (%) \n\nCity \n\nEIRR/SV \n\nBase \nCase \n\nCapital Cost \n(+10%) \n\nO&M Cost \n(+10%)  \n\nWillingness to \nPay (-10%)  \n\n31.1 \n\n10.5 \n\n35.6 \n\nIndore \n\nBhopal \n\nGwalior \n\nJabalpur \n\n27.4 \n43 \n7.1 \n(5) \n31.3 \n49 \n15.2 \n19 \n22.1 \n35 \n27.1 \n44 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; O&M = operation and maintenance; SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\nEIRR   \nSV \nEIRR   \nSV \nEIRR   \nSV \nEIRR   \nSV \nEIRR   \nSV \nEIRR   \nSV \n\n30.6 \n>100 \n9.7 \n(19) \n34.7 \n>100 \n18.0 \n>100 \n24.9 \n>100 \n30.2 \n>100 \n\n28.2 \n98 \n8.2 \n(7) \n32.0 \n>100 \n16.1 \n29 \n22.8 \n70 \n27.8 \n>100 \n\nRatlam  \n\nUjjain \n\n30.6 \n\n18.6 \n\n25.4 \n\nBenefits \nDelayed by  \n1 Year \n22.8 \n\n5.8 \n\n25.8 \n\n12.7 \n\n18.6 \n\n22.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nFINANCIAL IMPROVEMENT ACTION PLAN  \n\nItem \n\nCurrent \n\nProject Implementation Period \n\nPost implementation \nFY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008  FY2009  FY2010  Remarks \n\n1.

The main objective of evaluation was to \ndetermine  the  financial  feasibility  of  the  selected  components  in  the  project  city  corporations, \nincluding cost recovery.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nFinancial  projections  prepared  for  the  project  cities  comprise  projected  receipts  and \nexpenditures in rupees, expressed in current prices incorporating the projected general inflation \nover the forecast period. The financial projections, presented based on a fiscal year ending 31 \nMarch,  include  receipts  generated  from  all  locally  applied  taxes,  such  as  the  property  tax,  all \nnontax  receipts  such  as  water  charges  and  income  from  municipal  properties,  and  all  regular \ntransfers  from  the  state  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh.  Expenditures  include  all  recurrent \nexpenditures.  \n \n\nAssumptions Used in Financial Projections  \n\n   \n\n1. \n\nProperty Tax \n\n \nUnder  a  new  method  of  levying  property  tax  introduced  in  1997,  all  urban  local  bodies \n3. \nswitched to a zonal area-linked system involving self-assessment of annual rental values by the \nassessees.  In  general,  all  project  cities  had  set  the  zonal  rates  at  a  very  low  level.  A  large \nnumber  of  properties  are  still  out  of  the  tax  net  and  the  current  collection  efficiency,  except  in \nBhopal,  is  low.  Under  part  B  of  the  Project,  the  project  cities  in  conjunction  with  the  state \ngovernment  will  implement  property  tax  reforms  that  will  build  on  the  expected  improvements \nwith computerization of the master files and collection procedures. The cities are committed to \nrationalize the tax rate structure and simultaneously increase tax collection efficiency. \n \n4. \nThe measures implicit in the assumptions used for the financial analysis follow: (i) up to \n75% of the properties will be subjected to a property tax by FY2008; (ii) effective 1 April 2004, \nthe current low property tax rates will be increased by 100% in Bhopal, 200% in Gwalior, 50% in \nIndore, 150% in Jabalpur, 75% in Ratlam, and 200% in Ujjain; (iii) the property tax rates will be \nreviewed  every  4  years  and  increased  by  a  minimum  of  20%;  and  (iv)  by  FY2009,  overall \ncollection efficiency (current and arrear demands) will have been 75%.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCompensation, Tax Sharing, and Subsidy \n\n \n5. \nA  significant  portion  of  revenues  consists  of  devolution  and  transfers  from  the  state \ngovernment. They include compensation for abolishing octroi and assigned revenue under the \nState  Finance  Commission  (SFC)  recommendations.  In  the  past,  the  government  did  not  fully \naccept the SFC recommendations but shared a part of the state\u2019s tax and nontax revenue with \nthe municipalities. A second SFC has been constituted and its report will be available soon.  \n \n\n3. \n\nDirect Cost Recovery  \n\n \n6. \nThe essence of the Government policies and plans for the urban sector is to aim at full \ncost  recovery  for  urban  water  supply  through  direct  user  charges,  and  for  solid  waste \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nmanagement through an indirect tax such as the property tax. The current financial position of \nthe project cities is inadequate to continue system improvement and increase service coverage. \nOne of the important objectives of the Project is to assist project cities to improve generation of \nrevenues  from  own  sources  and  to  ensure  that  the  administration  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of both existing and project assets can be adequately covered.  \n \n\na. \n\nWater Charges \n\n \nUnder the Project all existing unmetered water connections will be metered, the cost for \n7. \nwhich  is  included  in  the  cost  estimates.  In  the  future,  only  metered  water  connections  will  be \nprovided. The cost of the water meter and connecting to the main supply line will be borne by \nthe beneficiaries, which, depending upon the distance, would be less than Rs2,000. \n \n8. \nAs part of the financial improvement action plan, the present low monthly charges for un-\nmetered  water  connections  will  be  raised  in  FY2004  (Appendix  12).  Concurrent  with  the \nmetering, a volumetric charge based on a block tariff will be introduced so that consumers can \npay  according  to  their  water  use.  As  an  incentive  for  metering  and  to  save  water  that  may  be \ndirected to other needy consumers, and considering affordability to the consumers, a three-tier \ndomestic  tariff  has  been  proposed  under  which  the  first  block  representing  the  lifeline \nconsumption  of  up  to  10  cubic  meters  (m3)  will  be  charged  an  affordable  rate  for  all  income \ngroups.  The  next  block  of  10  m3  will  be  charged  one  and  half  times  over  the  lifeline  tariff, \nrepresenting  ordinary  tariff.  All  consumption  over  20  m3 will be charged twice the lifeline tariff. \nThe  commercial  and  industrial  tariff  will  be  set  at  two  and  three  times  of  the  domestic  lifeline \ntariff. Households that may not be  able  to  realize  the  benefit  of  in-house connections and use \nstand posts to meet their water demands will be charged a concessional tariff restricted to 60% \nof the domestic lifeline tariff. The cross-subsidization among the users is evident. \n \n9. \nUpon full implementation of the water supply schemes, a capital recovery charge will be \nintroduced to supplement the funds required to meet the debt service obligations on the project \nloans. All tariffs will increase yearly in real terms by 1% over local inflation.  \n \n\nb. \n\nWastewater (Sewerage) Surcharge  \n\n \n10. \nUpon the completion of the sewerage schemes, a wastewater (sewerage) surcharge will \nbe  introduced  for  households  that  are  connected  to  the  sewerage  system.  The  surcharge \nincluded in the water bill will be 30% in Bhopal, 40% in Gwalior, 25% in Indore, 40% in Jabalpur, \nand  25%  in  Ujjain.  The  Project  will  provide  the  main  sewerage  collection  system  including \nroadside inspection chambers for house laterals and connections. The households will meet the \ncost of connecting to the nearest inspection chamber, which, depending on the location of the \nhouse,  will  be  about  Rs2,000.  No  affordability  problems  are  foreseen  for  most  of  the \nhouseholds. However, in the case of low-income households desiring to connect to the system, \nthe project cities will initially shoulder this cost and recover it over 12 months. \n \n \n\nc. \n\nSolid Waste Management Fees \n\n \n11. \nPresently, no direct charges are levied for solid waste collection and disposal. Beginning \nApril  2006  when  the  waste  collection  and  disposal  system  will  become  operative,  a  monthly \ncharge  of  Rs10  will  be  recovered  from  all  households  assessed  for  property  taxation. \nCommercial  establishments  will  be  charged  twice  the  domestic  rate.  Under  current  laws, \nundertakings generating hazardous waste are required to ensure treatment and disposal of the \nwaste as per the prescribed guidelines. The State Pollution Control Board monitors compliance.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nFinancial Internal Rates of Return \n\n \nC. \n \n12. \nFinancial  analysis  was  undertaken  for  revenue-generating  components,  i.e.,  water \nsupply,  sewerage  and  solid  waste  management.  Basic  assumptions  in  computing  the  FIRR \nfollow: (i) all revenues and costs are expressed in constant prices on an incremental basis; (ii) \ncapital expenditures include all costs, less taxes and duties and price contingencies; (iii) capital \nexpenditures are recorded at the time they are incurred, while interest and finance charges are \nexcluded;  (iv)  equipment  replacement  costs  are  estimated  every  15  years  in  the  water  supply \nand sewerage schemes, and 5 and 10 years in the solid waste management schemes; and (v) \nincremental operating costs are calculated by subtracting the existing system\u2019s operating costs \nfrom  the  projected  operating  costs  for  the  whole  system  at  project  completion.  The  value  of \nbenefits  arising from water sales was calculated by multiplying the volume of water sold each \nyear  by  the  proposed  tariffs  used  for  each  year  in  constant  prices,  with  an  annual  increase  of \n1%  in  real  terms.  For  sewerage,  the  estimated  cash  flows  were  based  on  the  proposed \nwastewater surcharge on water bills. Benefits and costs were kept constant after FY2021 when \nall facilities would be operating at near full capacity and present design demands would be fully \nsatisfied. \n \n13. \nThe  FIRRs,  which  are  the  discount  rates  that  equalize the present value of costs and \nrevenues  over  the  project  life,  were  calculated  and  sensitivity  analyses  carried  out  using  the \nfollowing  key  variables:  (i)  10%  increase  in  capital  costs,  (ii)  10%  increase  in  O&M  costs,  (iii) \n10% decrease in revenue, and (iv) benefits delayed by 1-year. For discounting the net financial \nbenefits to arrive at the net present value, the weighted average cost of capital was adjusted for \nthe inflation rate. The weighted average cost of capital assumed was 4%. \n \n14. \nThe FIRRs for water supply schemes vary between 18.5% and 5.2%. The wide variation \nis due to the nature of the scheme, distance from source, service coverage, and O&M costs. \nThe FIRRs for sewerage schemes are low due to high investment and O&M costs. Combined \nFIRRs for water supply and sewerage are all above the weighted average cost of capital. The \nFIRRs for solid waste management is between 15.3% and 0.4%. Sensitivity tests indicate that \nthe  FIRRs  are  sensitive  to  decrease  in  revenues  and  delaying  project  benefits  by  1  year. The \nFIRRs  with  the  associated  sensitivity  tests  are  summarized  in  Table  A13.1.  An  additional \nsensitivity analysis was conducted for water supply (Table A13.2) to analyze the impact of the \nnonrevenue water rate. Under the assumption that the original targets for nonrevenue water are \nmissed by 20% for 2009 and 25% for 2021, the FIRRs remain sound except for Ratlam. \n \n\nTable A13.1: Financial Internal Rates of Return (%) \n \nCapital \nCosts \n+10% \n11.0 \n4.4 \n\nO&M \nCosts \n+10% \n11.0 \n4.6 \n\nBase \nCase \n\n11.3 \n5.2 \n\n \n \n\nBenefits \n-10% \n\nBenefits \nDelayed \nby 1 year \n9.8 \n4.2 \n\n10.2 \n\n4.7 \n17.7 \n1.6 \n\n11.3 \n\n6.8 \n\n9.7 \n\n2.9 \n16.3 \n0.9 \n\n10.3 \n\n5.5 \n\n9.9 \n\n3.1 \n17.5 \n1.0 \n\n11.0 \n\n5.6 \n\n9.9 \n3.7 \n\n8.8 \n\n0.8 \n16.0 \n(Neg.) \n\n9.8 \n\n4.4 \n\n8.8 \n\n2.6 \n15.2 \n0.8 \n\n9.7 \n\n5.1 \n\n \n \nCity \n\nComponent \nBhopal  Water Supply \n\n \n\n \n\nSewerage \nWater Supply and \nSewerage \nSolid Waste \nManagement \nGwalior  Water Supply \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSewerage \nWater Supply and \nSewerage \nSolid Waste \nManagement \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nBenefits \n-10% \n\nBenefits \nDelayed \nby 1 year \n3.5 \n0.5 \n\n2.4 \n0.0 \n\n2.0 \n\n12.5 \n16.6 \n3.8 \n\n11.9 \n\n(1.5) \n4.0 \n\n1.5 \n5.7 \n(0.1) \n\n4.7 \n\n3.1 \n\n12.0 \n15.7 \n4.0 \n\n11.6 \n\n0.9 \n4.3 \n\n2.9 \n5.9 \n0.6 \n\n5.0 \n\nCapital \nCosts \n+10% \n4.5 \n0.6 \n\n4.0 \n\n13.9 \n17.1 \n4.1 \n\n12.3 \n\n0.9 \n4.4 \n\n3.3 \n5.9 \n0.9 \n\n5.1 \n\nO&M \nCosts \n+10% \n3.7 \n0.7 \n\n3.2 \n\n14.3 \n18.1 \n4.6 \n\n13.1 \n\n1.0 \n4.9 \n\n3.3 \n6.5 \n0.6 \n\n5.5 \n\n(1.1) \n\n(1.0) \n\n(0.1) \n\n(0.8) \n\n \n \nCity \n\n \n \n\nComponent \nIndore  Water Supply \n\n \n\n \n\nSewerage \nWater Supply and \nSewerage \nSolid Waste \nManagement \nJabalpur  Water Supply \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSewerage \nWater Supply and \nSewerage \nSolid Waste \nManagement \nRatlam   Water Supply \n\n \n\nSolid Waste \nManagement \nUjjain  Water Supply \n\n \n\n  Sewerage \n\nWater Supply and \nSewerage \nSolid Waste \nManagement \n\n \n\n \n\nBase \nCase \n\n5.6 \n1.2 \n\n4.9 \n\n15.3 \n18.5 \n4.8 \n\n13.4 \n\n2.8 \n5.2 \n\n4.7 \n6.6 \n1.5 \n\n5.7 \n\n0.4 \n\nO&M = operation & maintenance \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n\nBase Case  \n\n \n \nCity \nBhopal \nGwalior \nIndore \nJabalpur \nRatlam \nUjjain \n\n2003 \n59.7 \n54.4 \n52.0 \n39.3 \n37.5 \n49.2 \nFIRR = financial internal rates of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2009 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n\n2021 \n20 \n20 \n20 \n20 \n20 \n20 \n\nTable A13.2: Additional Sensitivity Analysis for Water Supply \n \n\nNonrevenue Water Rate (%) \n\nFIRR (%) \n11.3 \n17.7 \n5.6 \n18.5 \n5.2 \n6.6 \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n2021 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n25 \n\nFIRR (%) \n10.0 \n15.5 \n4.2 \n16.3 \n3.0 \n4.9 \n\n2009 \n30 \n30 \n30 \n30 \n30 \n30 \n\nAverage Incremental Financial Cost  \n\n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe average incremental cost of  water supply was calculated to determine the financial \ntariffs to be set for full cost recovery over the assumed project life. Discounting is done at the \nweighted average cost of capital of 4%, which is used as a proxy for Financial Opportunity Cost \nof Capital. The average Incremental financial cost vary between Rs6.5/m3 and Rs12.7/m3. The \naverage  recovery  from  domestic  users  is  between  46%  and  80%.  Cost  recovery  is  between \n38% and 67% in the lifeline consumption block, between 57% and 100% in the next block, and \nbetween  76%  and  133%  in  the  final  block.  Cost  recovery  from  commercial  users  is  between \n87% and 164%, and that from industrial users between 128% and 205%. The stand post users, \nhowever, are expected to pay only between 23% and 40%.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nE. \n \n\nAffordability to Beneficiaries \n\n1. \n\nWillingness to Pay \n\n \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  results  show  that  there  was  willingness  both  to  have  piped \n16. \nwater  connections  and  to  pay  for  them.  However,  the  willingness  to  pay  for  the piped water \nsupply was generally low among the households. Perhaps this is the result of the present low \nlevel of water supply and low water tariffs. Nearly 80% of the households were willing to pay a \nmonthly fixed charge of Rs100 for improved water supply, while 13% were willing to spend up to \nRs200;  the  remaining  households  were  willing  to  spend  only  below  Rs100.  Similarly,  when \nasked about their willingness to pay for an improved in-house metered water connection, 78% \nwere ready to pay Rs100 per month. Willingness to pay Rs200 was recorded for 18%. Only 2% \nwere willing to pay Rs300. The mean average for all the cities was Rs125 per month.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAffordability Analysis \n\n \nApplying  the  proposed  water  charges  and  wastewater  surcharge  with  expected  water \n17. \nconsumption,  the  percentage  of  average  monthly  expenditure  on  water  and  sewerage  was \nassessed  with  reference  to  household  incomes.  Water  tariffs  are  observed  to  be  within  the \ngenerally  accepted  expenditure  level  of  3-4%  of  the  median  monthly  household  income.  In \ncombination  with  sewerage  charges,  the  average  monthly  household  expenditure  is  4-5%. No \naffordability problems are foreseen for the 20% households as they are likely to consume less \nthan the average town water consumption, or will alternatively be dependent on the stand post \nsupplies. However, as most of the households lie above the median income level, affordability is \nnot a constraint.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n53 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION1 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nA. \n \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken as part of the Urban Water \n1. \nSupply  and  Environmental  Improvement  Project  in  Madhya  Pradesh  to  ascertain  the  Project's \nimpact  on  the  environment  and  to  identify  measures  to  prevent  or  mitigate  any  adverse \nenvironmental impacts that could arise from its implementation.  \n \n2. \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  a  \u201cB\u201d  Project  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development \nBank's (ADB) Guidelines on Environmental Assessment. All subcomponents aim to improve the \nquality  and  security  of  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  disposal.  IEEs  carried  out  for  all \nsubcomponents  showed  no  significant  environmental  effect.  Project  activities  that  may  have  a \nmarginally significant effect, and the main mitigation measures proposed are summarized here.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe major cities of Madhya Pradesh are lagging behind comparable cities elsewhere in \nIndia, in the level and quality of basic infrastructure and services. Fundamental needs such as a \nreliable water supply, adequate sewerage and sanitation, and effective means for collecting and \ndisposing  of  solid  waste  are  not  satisfied.  The  Project  is  designed  to  enhance  the  minimum \nprerequisites  for  economic  development  and  contribute  urban  poverty  reduction  and  improved \nhealth and hygiene. The details of the Project are in the main text of the report. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  Project  covers  the  six  larger  urban  centers  (Bhopal,  Gwalior,  Indore,  Jabalpur, \nRatlam, and Ujain) of the state of Madhya Pradesh, with populations from 250,000 to 1.5 million. \nThe cities are centers of administration, commerce, and industry, with environmental problems \nsimilar to those affecting most large cities in the subcontinent: (i) lack of continuous and reliable \nwater supply; (ii) lack of an adequate network for disposing of storm water or wastewater; and \n(iii)  general  widespread  pollution  caused  by  improper  disposal  of  human,  domestic,  and \nindustrial waste. Provision of basic services is particularly deficient in the slum areas, and other \ninformal residential areas without planned essential infrastructure throughout the project cities.  \n \n5. \nThe  state  of  Madhya  Pradesh  has  many  forests,  especially  in  the  Vindhya-Kaimar, the \nSatpura and Maikala ranges, and the Baghelkhand plateau. Wildlife sanctuaries are at Kanha, \nShivpuri,  Bandhavgarh  and  Rewa.  There  are  no  fisheries,  wildlife,  forest,  and  rare  or \nendangered species in or around the project cities. Land areas for the proposed water supply, \nsewage  treatment  facilities,  and  waste  disposal  facilities  have  been  developed  or  disturbed \npreviously and have no forest or unusual vegetation cover.  \n \n6. \nThere are no known sites of historical or cultural significance in the areas that are likely \nto  be  affected  during  project  implementation.  In  the  detailed  investigation  and  design  of  water \nand  sanitation  works,  particular  care  will  be  taken  to  identify  historical  and  cultural  sites,  and \nappropriate steps taken to protect them. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n                                                 \n1 Sample of IEE for Bhopal is in Supplementary Appendix L. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nD. \n \n7. \nassociated with location, design, construction stage, and operation. \n \n\nThe  IEEs  review  for  all  proposed  components  potential  environmental  problems \n\n1.  \n\nLocation \n\n \n8. \nThe  majority  of  the  project  civil  works  will  consist  of  environmental  infrastructure, \nessentially  road-based  infrastructure  located  within  or  along  the  existing  road  right-of-way. \nPermission  will  be  obtained  from  relevant  authorities  to  dig  up  the  roads  and  divert  traffic \ntemporarily.  New  or  expanded  water  treatment  plants  will  be  built  on  the  same  sites  as  the \nexisting plants, on the same plots. The location for new overhead reservoirs for local distribution \nwill be chosen in collaboration with the communities that will benefit from the reservoirs. These \nwill  be  accommodated  on  government  land  (about  1,000  square  meters)  used  by  institutions \nsuch as parks, schools, hospitals, and Government offices.  \n \nSewage treatment facilities (STF) (stabilization pond system) will require 50-70 hectares \n9. \n(ha).  The  STFs  are  located  either  on  existing  plant  premises  or  on  vacant  and  barren  land \nowned  by  the  Government  and  passed  on  to  the  municipal  corporations.  The  nearest \nhabitations are 500-1,000 meters (m) away. In Jabalpur, the construction of the STF will involve \nthe  acquisition  of  nonirrigated  land  and  will  also  affect  a  few  irrigation  units  and  temporary \nstructures.  A  short  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  affected \nhouseholds.  \n \nThe  existing  landfills  in  the  six  cities  are  nearing  capacity  and  will  be  decommissioned \n10. \nwithin the next year. New sites for sanitary landfills have been carefully identified, away from the \ncity  centers  and  surface  water  sources.  The  land  is  barren  and  there  are  no  scavengers.  The \nland  in  most  of  the  cities  belongs  to  the  corporation.  Needed  land  that  it  belongs  to  the  state \ngovernment is in the process of being transferred to the corporations. Groundwater pollution by \nleachate  will  be  eliminated  through  proper  leachate  management.  The  sites  are  located  500-\n1000 m away from the nearest isolated households. Any settlement 500 m or less from the sites \nwill be shielded by vegetation. The location of the waste disposal containers (1 cubic meter [m3] \nand 4.5 m3) in the cities will be determined on a case-by-case basis during implementation, with \nthe involvement of communities and affected households and based on a detailed ward-by-ward \nstreet map and a solid waste management master plan. In the case of Indore, the site for a 25 \nha sanitary landfill has to be confirmed. The identified site is currently in private ownership. Land \nacquisition will be in accordance with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Handbook on \nResettlement (1998). \n \n\n2. \n\nDesign \n\n \n11. \nDesigns should aim at keeping all excavation and construction within existing rights-of-\nway to minimize nuisance and disruption to traffic and the adjacent population. The design for \nthe  drinking  water  treatment  plant  renovation  and  expansion  follows  Central  Public  Health \nEngineering  and  Environmental  Organization  guidelines  for  traditional  surface  water  treatment \nprocesses. An operating license will be obtained from the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) \nbefore operations start. \n \n\n12.   Wastewater, sullage, and polluted storm water will be carried from the residential areas \nthrough the drainage network, via the largely existing primary channels, to final disposal at the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\ntreatment plant or the stream. The proposed improvements will not result in new or intensified \ndrainage  problems  in  other  areas.  A  full  combined  master  plan  for  sewerage  and  drainage, \nwhich  will  include  all  environmental  mitigation  measures,  will  be  prepared  at  the  start  of  the \nproject period as the basis of any design. \n  \n13. \nThe proposed sewage treatment process using stabilization ponds presents the simplest \nform  of  wastewater  treatment  available,  especially  for  an  area  where  barren  land  is  available \nand  power  supply  unreliable.  National  Environmental  Legislation  does  not  require  that  an \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  be  carried  out  for  sewage  treatment  plants.  Under  SPCB \nregulations,  an  operating  license  will  be  obtained  during  detailed  design.  To  ensure  that  all \nmitigation  measures,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  are  in  place  a  comprehensive \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  will  been  drawn  up  before  an  operating  license  is \nissued. These detailed EMPs will also be submitted to ADB for review and approval. \n \n14. \nIndian  SWHR-2000. \nGroundwater  will  be  protected  from  pollution  by  leachate  through  the  construction  of  an \nimpermeable layer, with a drainage system designed to collect leachate water for treatment and \ndisposal.  Under  National  Environmental  Legislation,  no  environmental  impact  assessment  is \nrequired  for  sanitary  landfills  that  do  not  dispose  of  medical  waste.    SPCB  regulations  require \nthat  an  operating  license  be  obtained  after  detailed  design  has  been  completed.  A \ncomprehensive EMP will be drawn up to ensure that all mitigation measures are in place before \nSPCB  issues  an  operating  license.  The  exhausted  landfills  will  be  properly  sealed  and \ndecommissioned within 3 months of the operation of the new sites. Hard-surface platforms for \nthe waste disposal containers will be designed to allow efficient and effective cleaning.  \n \n\nlandfill  sites  will  be  designed  according \n\nThe  sanitary \n\nto \n\n3. \n\nConstruction \n\n \n15. \nDuring construction, there will be some temporary inconveniences and disruption to the \nsurroundings and the environment. Potential environmental issues are siltation and increase in \nrunoff,  generation  of  waste  and  effluent  from  construction  camps,  noise  pollution,  air  pollution \nfrom  dust,  disturbance  of  storm  water  drainage,  disruption  of  access to residential areas, and \nincreased  traffic  congestion.  These  issues  will  be  minimized  through  the  development  of  a \ndetailed EMP for each subcomponent at the detailed design stage. Some mitigation measures \nfollow: (i) the construction area should be restricted to fenced compounds to minimize the area \ndisturbed;  (ii)  soil  erosion  control  methods  should  be  applied;  (iii)  construction  sites  must  be \nwatered to reduce dust; (iv) waste management measures should be introduced at construction \nsites  and  camps;  (v)  hazardous  materials,  including  chemicals,  should  be  safely  stored;  (vi) \ngroundwater contact should be minimized during construction; (vii) vegetation disruption should \nbe limited at construction sites and removal of significant habitat vegetation avoided; and (viii) \ndisturbed  areas  should  be  returned  to  previous  conditions  or  unimproved  state.  All  mitigation \nrequirements  will  be  part  of  the  contract  document  for  the  contractor;  for  sensitive  areas,  a \nperformance  bond  system  might  be  included.  The  project  engineer  will  monitor  the \nenvironmental effects of the construction activities. It is suggested that a local community liaison \ncommittee to serve for the duration of the construction activity be established  \n\n \n4. \n \n\nOperations \n\n16. \nOperations  of  most  project  components  will  be  a  routine  continuation  of  existing \noperations  in  running  municipal  infrastructure  services.  Structured  and  planned  preventive \nmaintenance programs will be developed for all facilities under the Project. The following issues \nrelated to operations will be highlighted. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nAll sludge generated by the water treatment plants will be treated on site using drying \n17. \nbeds.  There  will  be  no  off-site  discharge.  The  dried  sludge  will  be  transferred  to  the  sanitary \nlandfills. To ensure the integrity of the treated water quality, all water storage areas are roofed \nand  ventilated,  and  the  system  operated  to  ensure  that  the  distribution  system  is  maintained \nunder pressure. To ensure the health and safety of workers and the public appropriate detailed \ndesign  and  EMPs  will  include  a  safe  working  environment  to  international  standards,  coupled \nwith appropriate training in chemical handling (especially with regard to handling chlorine) and \nmechanical,  electrical,  and  system  operations.  To  ensure  safe  water  is  delivered,  effective \nmonitoring of treatment processes, operation and maintenance of procedures, and daily chlorine \nresidual testing will be instituted. Periodic biological oxygen demand (BOD), microbiological, etc. \ntesting of treated water will also be undertaken.  \n \nWastewater collection, segregation of storm water and sewage treatment will reduce \n18. \nthe  pollution  load  on  surface  waters.  Currently,  raw  sewage  is  being  discharged  to  surface \nwaters. The discharge of treated water will reduce deterioration in quality of the recipient waters. \nEffluent  from  the  waste  stabilization  ponds  will  be  better  than  the  Government  of  India \nrequirements of 20 BOD and 30 SS plus the added bonus of bacterial kill. It is estimated that the \naverage  level  of  reduction  in  water  pollution  loading  will  be  90%.  To  monitor  the  quantity  of \nwater  of  the  natural  water  sources  and  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  catchment  areas, \ninformation  will  be  exchanged  with  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Integrated  Water  Resource \nManagement  Strategy  Program.  Sludge  collected  from  septic  tanks  by  vacuum  cleaning \nmachines  will  be  dumped  into  the  receiving  chamber  located  at  the  sewage  treatment  facility \nattached to the sludge drying bed together with sludge from the grit chambers for further drying. \nThe residues of the screen chambers will be transferred to the landfill sites. \n \n19. \nThe  corporations  will  ensure  effective  operation  of  waste  collection  (containers  are \nemptied,  cleaned,  and  replaced  regularly  and  reliably)  and  disposal.  Controlling  access  to  the \nsites to prevent unlicensed disposal, compacting and covering waste upon deposition, etc., and \nperiodic  (monthly)  groundwater  quality  and  leachate  quality  monitoring  at  all  waste  disposal \nsites will be implemented.  \n \nE. \n \n20. \nCurrent  environmental  legislation  puts  the  responsibility  for  protecting  of  the  urban \nenvironment  as  well  as  planning  and  management,  with  the  relevant  urban  local  body  (ULB). \nNevertheless under the current municipal acts, this still remains a discretionary function. Active \nenvironmental  management  of  the  urban  area  must  remain  the  responsibility  of  the  ULBs. \nHowever,  it  is  recognized  that  the  present  performance  of  the  ULBs  in  environmental \nmanagement is inadequate. The Project will support change in the municipal acts to ensure that \nULBs  take  on  the  responsibilities  and  exercise  their  function  as  environmental  monitors  for \nurban  infrastructure.  Adequate  training  for  these  competencies  and  strengthened  capacity  will \nbe provided.  \n \n21. \nThe  ULBs,  together  with  the  respective  corporations,  will  be  required  to  commission  a \ndetailed  EMP  for  each  project  component.  Implementing of mitigation measures to protect the \nenvironment  before  construction  will  be  the  responsibility  of  ULBs.  A  project  environmental \nofficer  will  monitor  implementation  of  these  measures;  liaise  with  local  community  groups,  the \nSPCB,  and  other  relevant  agencies;  gather  baseline  data;  and  provide  technical  support.  The \ncontractor will be responsible for implementing  of mitigation measures during the construction \nstage.  An  environmental  engineer,  who  will  be  hired  as  part  of  the  consultant  team  for \nimplementing  the  Project,  will  assist  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  in  preparing \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\ncontractual  documents  so  that  the  bidding  documents,  bills  of  quantity,  and  other  contractual \nobligations  of  the  contractor  clearly  identify  environmental  responsibilities  and  describe \npenalties for noncompliance. \n \n Environmental monitoring reports from the corporations will be submitted to SPCB and \n22. \nthe  ULBs  according  to  the  engineering  phases  of  plant  and  site  construction  and  pipe  laying. \nThe  ULBs,  together  with  the  corporations,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  overall \nenvironmental monitoring and management. The PIUs will submit quarterly reports to the project \nmanagement unit, which will consolidate the data and send it on to ADB. \n \nF. \n \nPublic  consultation  was  carried  out  throughout  the  project  preparation  phase  in  all  six \n23. \ncities.  Public  involvement  and  consultation  activities  have  spread  an  understanding  of  the \nProject  and  its  potential  impacts  and  sought  out  suggestions  for  improve  it.  Issues  raised  in \nthese  consultations  have  been  incorporated  in  the  proposed  mitigation  measures.  The \nconsultative  process  covered  three  main  stakeholder  groups:  (i)  the  government  (state  and \nmunicipal),  (ii)  residential  communities,  and  (iii)  the  business  community.  All  environmental \ndocuments are subject to public disclosure and will be made available to the public on request. \n \nG. \n \n24.    SPCB  clearance  is  being  sought  for  a  number  of  subcomponents  where  detailed  and \ncomprehensive EMPs will need to be prepared. The Project has sufficient contingencies should \nthe  SPCB  require  additional  mitigation  measures  to  be  put  in  place.  However,  no  work  is  to \nbegin  until  the  appropriate  operating  licenses  from  SPCB  and  relevant  authorities  have  been \ngranted.  \n \n \nH. \n \n25. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  health  and  sanitation  of  the  communities in six cities and \nstrengthen the environmental planning, management, and monitoring functions of the ULBs. Full \nenvironmental benefits will be achieved only through effective operation and maintenance. The \nIEE concludes that an environmental impact assessment will not be necessary, as the Project \nwill  not  cause  significant  environmental  problems  and  the  potential  adverse  impacts  are \nmanageable  through  proper  policy,  planning,  public  relations,  and  good  construction  and \nsupervision practices.  \n \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Currency Unit \nRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 11 November 2003) \n", " \n \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n$0.0221 \nRs45.17 \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nAIF \nBME \nBOD \nCIF \nDSC \nEA \nEC \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nGIS \nICB \nIEE \nLCB \nlpcd \nMAPP \nMC \nMOU \nNGO \nO&M \nPHED \nPIU \nPMC \nPMU \nPPMS \nSGIA \nSOE \nSPCB \nSTF \nSTP \nSWM \nTA \nUADD \nULB \nUN-HABITAT \nWSD \n", "Asian Development Bank \nArea Improvement Fund \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation \nbiological oxygen demand \nCommunity Initiatives Fund \ndesign and supervision consultancy \nexecuting agency \nEmpowered Committee \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rates of return \ngeographic information system \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nlocal competitive bidding \nliters per capita per day \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  municipal action planning for poverty reduction \n\u2013  municipal corporation \n\u2013  Memorandum of Understanding \nnongovernment organization \n\u2013 \noperation and maintenance \n\u2013 \nPublic Health Engineering Department \n\u2013 \nproject implementation unit \n\u2013 \nproject management consultancy \n\u2013 \nproject management unit \n\u2013 \nproject performance monitoring system \n\u2013 \nSecond Generation Imprest Account \n\u2013 \nstatement of expenditures \n\u2013 \nState Pollution Control Board \n\u2013 \nsewage treatment facilities \n\u2013 \nsewage treatment plant \n\u2013 \nsolid waste management \n\u2013 \ntechnical assistance \n\u2013 \nurban administration and development department \n\u2013 \nurban local body \n\u2013 \nUnited Nations Human Settlements Programme \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Water and Sanitation Department \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", " \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 March.
