The  project  will  improve  readiness  and quality  of  public \ninfrastructure projects, and strengthen the public investment management systems. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nAccelerating  infrastructure  investment.  In  line  with  the  Ten-Point  Socioeconomic \n3. \nAgenda, the government aims to ramp up public infrastructure projects such as national roads, \nexpressways,  bridges,  airports,  subways,  and  railways. 1 Public  spending  on  infrastructure  is \nexpected to reach 7% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2022, or approximately $14.5 billion \nannually,  from  3.4%  of  GDP  in  2016.  To  realize  the  goals  of  infrastructure  investment,  the \ngovernment requested the proposed project from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which will \nhelp  the  two  key  agencies  responsible  for  national  public  infrastructure  projects\u2014DPWH  and \nDOTr\u2014conduct  pre-investment  activities.  These  will,  in  turn,  help  accelerate  the  Investment \nCoordination  Committee\u2019s  review  and  approval  process  and  ensure  timely,  high-quality \nprocurement and implementation.2 \n \n4. \nCore development problem. Infrastructure enables access to work, markets, education, \nhealth care, housing, and other services that allow people to uplift their standards of living. Lack \nof or underdeveloped infrastructure has been identified as one of the most significant constraints \non the Philippines\u2019 growth prospects. While the country has improved consistently in the Global \nCompetitiveness Ranking, from 65th in 2012\u20132013 to 57th in 2016\u20132017, its overall infrastructure \nsignificantly lags that of other emerging Southeast Asian countries. In 2016\u20132017, the Philippines \nwas ranked 112th out of 138 countries on infrastructure quality, well below other Southeast Asian \ncountries  such  as  Malaysia  (19th),  Thailand  (72nd),  and  Indonesia  (80th).  The  impacts  of \nunderdeveloped public infrastructure are high costs of doing business, which in turn undermine \nbusiness  potential  and economic opportunities,  especially  in rapidly  growing  urban areas.  The \nPhilippines has to step up infrastructure development substantially if it wants to realize its potential \nand remain competitive. \n \nInfrastructure development constraints. Underdeveloped infrastructure is attributed to \n5. \nfive  factors:  (i)  insufficient  infrastructure  investment,  (ii)  lack  of  inter-agency  coordination, \n(iii)  inadequate  or  incomplete  infrastructure  plans  and  implementation  programs,  (iv)  limited \naccess  to  international  expertise  and  limited  technical  and  management  know-how  in  project \npreparation and implementation, and (v) inadequate sustainability of infrastructure. Coordination \nbetween  DPWH  and  DOTr  and  with  other  key  agencies  is  limited,  which  constrains  project \n\n                                                \n1  The Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda, as presented during the Sulong: Hakbang Tungo sa Kaunlaran consultative \n\nworkshop held on 20\u201321 June 2016. \n\n2  The government\u2019s official request for ADB\u2019s assistance was made on 8 February 2017. \n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npreparation  and  implementation.  Infrastructure  projects  are  often  not  delivered  as  planned \nbecause  of  dated  project  formulation  or  dated  project  implementation,  or  both. 3  Delays  in \nsafeguard  compliance,  procurement,  and  land  acquisition,  as  well  as  inadequate  project \nmanagement  systems  prevent  timely  project  delivery.  The  lack  of  project  management  and \nmonitoring  systems  also  means  that  infrastructure  is  often  delayed,  inefficiently  operated,  and \ninadequately maintained, which undermines the sustainability of project benefits. \n \n6. \nTackling  constraints  on  infrastructure  planning,  design,  and  implementation. \nStepping  up  national  capacity  begins  with  gaining  better  access  to  international  sources  of \ninnovation,  expertise,  advice,  and  best  practices,  which  would  enable  DPWH  and  DOTr  to \nincorporate expertise and innovation in project formulation and implementation. An ADB-funded \nproject and its international procurement systems would make it easier for DPWH and DOTr to \naccess the required technologies, international expertise, and innovation to complement and build \non nationally available know-how. The proposed loan will help DPWH and DOTr to execute and \nimplement public infrastructure projects more effectively by accelerating the due diligence stages, \ndetailed engineering designs, and bidding process preparations. \n \n7. \nA medium-term solution. The project offers a short- to medium-term solution to the near-\nterm  needs  of  DPWH  and  DOTr  to  boost  their  capacity  for  preparing  public  infrastructure \ninvestments. ADB has previously assisted government efforts to tackle the country\u2019s infrastructure \nconstraints with various project loans. The proposed project will supplement these interventions \nby providing DPWH and DOTr with access to international expertise and best practices that are \nnot currently available under locally funded development activities. They will allow the government \nto  act  on  its  Ten-Point  Socioeconomic  Agenda  to  support  the  increase  in  spending  on  public \nsector infrastructure. In addition, the project will provide support for the preparation of the long-\nterm  solution  to  the  problem  by  (i)  building  the  capacity  of  government  agencies  to  effectively \nplan, identify, design, manage, and implement projects; and (ii) set the groundwork for a holistic \nexamination  of  the  current  national  procurement  system  and  develop  options  for  additional \nefficiency  in  its  implementation.  A  separate TA  grant  for  Strengthening  Infrastructure  Capacity \nand  Innovation  for  Inclusive  Growth  was  provided  to  support  key  agencies  involved  in \ninfrastructure development\u2014National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), DPWH, and \nDOTr\u2014in the short-to-medium term.4 \n \n8. \nAlignment with ADB\u2019s strategic agenda. The project is included in the country operations \nand  business  plan  for  the  Philippines,  2017\u20132019. 5  It  contributes  to  the  agenda  of  inclusive \neconomic and environmentally sustainable growth of the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.6 \n \n9. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  project  will  build  upon  ADB\u2019s  successful \nexperience supporting the Public\u2013Private Partnership Center for the Philippines and enhance the \ngovernment  public  sector  agencies\u2019  institutional  set-up  and  capacity  to  identify,  finance,  and \nimplement public-financed projects. The project will also be supported by the separate TA grant \nwhich will develop a public infrastructure project system management procedure and strengthen \ncapacity of DPWH and DOTr staff to effectively implement and monitor projects. \n \n\n                                                \n3  ADB.  2008.

To \nensure  effective  oversight  and  institutional  coordination,  the  secretary  of  DOF  will  chair  the \nsteering  committee  established  for  the  project.  To  enable  adequate  disclosure  of  information, \nDPWH and DOTr, as the project implementing agencies, will set up a dedicated webpage for the \nproject. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  DPWH,  and  DOTr.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n25. \ninfrastructure investments prepared under the project will generate such impacts. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nThe project\u2019s focus is on improving public system management and providing consulting \nservices  to  DPWH  and  DOTr  for  the  preparation  of  infrastructure  projects.  As  such,  it  is  not \nexpected to have any direct social and environmental impacts or to  affect indigenous peoples. \nThe project\u2019s environmental and social safeguard categories are C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.14 \n \nF. \n \n27. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh its costs. \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nLimited availability of ODA \nfunding \n\nInsufficient qualified \ncounterpart staff \n\nThe size of the national infrastructure program is very large and the \nODA support might not be able to meet the level of finance being \nsought. The project will support packaging of projects for financing. \nThe scale of the Build Build Build program means that the key \nagencies, DPWH and DOTr, will not have enough staff. The project will \nprovide consultants to fill the gap in the short term. \nThe project will provide additional support to help meet the \nmanagement and reporting requirements. \n\nInsufficient experience to \nmanage the project \nADB = Asian Development Bank; DOTr = Department of Transportation; DPWH = Department of Public Works and \nHighways; ODA = official development assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe  government  and  DOF  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \n28. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n\n                                                \n14 ADB. 2010.
