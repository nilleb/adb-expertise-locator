The \nimproved road will become a backbone of the northeastern part of \nthe state, and connect it to National Highway 2 (NH2), the state\u2019s \nmain highway, and to the larger national highway network. \n \nThe Project will also enhance the project management skills of the \nofficials of the Road Construction Department (RCD) of the state \nin \ngovernment  of  Jharkhand  (GOJH) \nactivities that are central to project management, such as project \ndesign,  implementation  planning,  procurement,  land  acquisition, \nresettlement and rehabilitation, environmental management, utility \nshifting,  contract  management,  and  financial  management.  This \nwill be replicated by RCD for future road improvement projects.  \n \nJharkhand  is  one  of  four  states  in  India  with  a  poverty  incidence \nabove 40%. It was created in 2000 out of the southern half of the \nstate  of  Bihar,  and  a  high  proportion  of  its  population  is  tribal. \nSocioeconomic indicators reveal that significant improvements are \nneeded  in  terms  of  income,  literacy,  health,  and  access  to  basic \namenities.    \n \nJharkhand  has  prominent  industrial  cities,  due  to  its  abundant \nnatural  and  mineral  resources,  but  also  has  the  highest  rural \npoverty incidence in India. Industrial activities are concentrated in \nthe area south of NH2, which connects Delhi to Kolkata and forms \npart  of  the  core  national  transport  network  called  the  \u201cgolden \nquadrilateral.\u201d The area to the north of NH2 lacks major industrial \nactivities despite its rich mineral reserves. The poor quality of the \nroad  infrastructure  is  one  factor  constraining  the  development  of \nthis part of the state. \n \nThe Project proposes to address the disparities within Jharkhand \nby providing a good transportation network in a hitherto neglected \narea, and will contribute to reducing interstate disparities in India, \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nwhich is one of the key goals of the Government\u2019s 11th Five Year \nPlan for 2007\u20132012.  \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  transport  connectivity  in  the  state  of \nJharkhand through improvement of a key state road section in one \nof  the  state\u2019s  least  developed  but  resource-rich  areas.  This  will \ncontribute  to  expansion  of  economic  opportunities  and  poverty \nreduction  in  the  area  that  the  project  road  serves,  and  in  turn \nimprove  the  overall  economic  wellbeing  of  the  state.  Since \nJharkhand  is  one  of  the  least-developed  states  (as  measured  by \nsocial  and  economic  indicators),  this  development  is  expected  to \ncontribute to the overall reduction of interstate disparities in India. \nThe  Project\u2019s  immediate  outcome  will  be  improved  transport \nconnectivity in the project area resulting from reduction in vehicle \noperating costs and travel time on the project road.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $240.0  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of about $21 million.  \n \nA loan of $200,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n \nThe  Government  of  India  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  in  local \ncurrency to the state government of Jharkhand on the same terms \nand  conditions  as  received  from  ADB.  The  state  government  will \nbear the foreign exchange risk on the loan.  \n \nUntil 31 December 2014 \n \n30 June 2014 \n\nresponsible \n\n \nThe state government of Jharkhand, through RCD \n \nA  dedicated  project  implementation  cell  (PIC)  established  within \nRCD  will  be \nfor  overall  project  management \nthroughout the Project implementation period. The PIC is headed \nby a director reporting to the RCD secretary, and will have enough \nstaff  to  handle  duties  related  to  consulting  services,  civil  works, \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  environment,  and  financial \nmanagement  (disbursement,  accounting,  and  internal  auditing). \nThe PIC finance and accounts wing will handle project payments \nand  accounting.  For  each  civil  works  contract  package,  the  PIC \nwill  have  a  project  implementation  unit  headed  by  an  assistant \ndirector  (at  the  level  of  assistant  engineer)  to  interact  on  a  daily \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nfor  supply  contracts \n\nbasis with the civil works contractor and construction supervision \nconsultant (CSC). \n \nTwo  project-related  committees  were  established  in  December \n2008:  (i)  a  high-level  project  coordination  committee  (chaired  by \nthe  chief  secretary  of  GOJH),  which  will  facilitate  preconstruction \nactivities  concerning  different  GOJH  line  departments;  and  (ii)  a \nproject monitoring committee, chaired by the secretary of RCD, to \nmonitor project implementation.  \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the proposed ADB loan will \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive \nbidding will be used for all civil works contracts.  Shopping will be \nused \nthan  $100,000.  Advanced \nless \ncontracting and retroactive financing will be used to facilitate rapid \nimplementation. \n \nConsultants under the Project will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). RCD will hire a consulting firm as CSC, which \nwill assume the role of the \u201cEngineer\u201d for the civil works contracts. \nThe CSC will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedure with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  redress  the  sharp  urban\u2013rural  divide  by \nimproving  a  key  state  road  in  one  of  the  state\u2019s  underdeveloped \nareas.  The  improvement  to  the  road  infrastructure  will  contribute \nto  expansion  of  economic  activities  and  poverty  reduction  in  the \narea  that  the  road  serves,  and  in  turn  improve  the  overall \neconomic wellbeing of the state. \n \nThe direct beneficiaries will be the poor living in the project area, \nwho  are  primarily  farmers  engaged  in  subsistence  farming.  The \nexpected  reduction  in  transport  time  and  cost  will  generate \nopportunities  for  farmers  to  expand  production  and  market \nagriculture produce outside their own villages. They will also have \nbetter employment opportunities outside agriculture, both through \nimproved  access  to  economic  centers  and  increased  industrial \nactivities  in  the  project  area  resulting  from  improved  transport \nconnectivity. \n \nEnhancement  of  the  project  management  skills  of  RCD  officials \nwill  benefit  all  road  users  through  long-term  improvements  in  the \ncondition of the overall state road network. \n \nThe  risk  of  initial  delays  has  already  been  largely  mitigated \nthrough RCD\u2019s advance actions and support provided by ADB for \nvarious  preconstruction  activities.  District-level  task  forces  have \nbeen  formed  for  interdepartmental  coordination.  Training  on \nprocurement  and  safeguard  requirements  was  provided  to  RCD \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nto \n\ninitial  delays  due \n\nstaff and staff of other concerned departments to mitigate the risk \nof \nlack  of  coordination,  and  poor \nunderstanding of ADB requirements. \n \nThe  risks  related  to  obtaining  the  statutory  environmental  and \nforest clearance could also delay the civil works and could lead to \nincreased construction costs and delays in project completion. To \nmitigate these risks, RCD has taken advance actions to obtain the \nrequisite  clearances.  An  environmental  clearance  has  already \nbeen  obtained  from  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest. \nProposals  for  forest  clearance  have  also  been  submitted  to  the \ndistrict \nforest  offices.  The  high-level  project  coordination \ncommittee  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary  is  closely  monitoring \nprogress on the needed clearances. \n \nProject  roads  were  identified  in  accordance  with  the  state's  road \ndevelopment priorities. The Project will entail land acquisition due \nto proposed road widening and construction of bypasses to avoid \nbuilt-up  areas.  Detailed  planning  of \nland  acquisition  and \nresettlement  actions  has  been  carried  out  with  assistance  from \nADB and its consultants, and through extended consultations with \nthe project-affected communities.   \n \nThe risk of an unrealistic sector reform agenda has been mitigated \ninstitutional \nby  reflecting \nstrengthening,  which  takes  into  account  both  the  actions  already \ntaken by GOJH, and the availability of resources.  \n \nIn  Jharkhand,  the  road  maintenance  budget  allocation  almost \ntripled  from  FY2003  to  FY2007.  Actual  spending  has  also \nincreased  steadily,  but  is  still  well  below  the  allocated  budget. \nSecuring maintenance funds is not an immediate concern. Parallel \ncapacity development TA is to be provided under a TA cluster for \nAdvanced  Project  Preparedness  for  Poverty  Reduction  in  India. \nConsequently,  the  Project  will  focus  on  improving  RCD's  road \nasset  management  capability  for  better  and  more  efficient  usage \nof allocated funds.  \n \n\nthe  state  context \n\nthe  planned \n\nin \n\n\fo\n84  00'E\n\no\n87  00'E\n\nI N D I A\nJHARKHAND STATE ROADS PROJECT\n\n25  00'No\n\n25  00'No\n\nU T T A R\nP R A D E S H\n\nGarhwa\n\nDaltonganj\n\nChatra\n\nC H H A T T I S G A R H\n\nGumla\n\nSahebganj\n\nBarhet\n\nBarharwa\n\nGodda\n\nPakur\n\nG\n\na\n\nn\n\ng\n\na \n\nR\n\niv\ne\n\nr\n\nB I H A R\n\nKodarma\n\nBarhi\n\nGiridih\n\nAmrapara\n\nDumka\n\nDeoghar\n\nMadhupur\n\nHazaribagh\n\nGumia\n\nDhanbad\n\nJamtara\n\nGovindpur\n\nKumardhubi\n\nLohardaga\n\nSaunda\n\nBokaro\n\nRamgarh\n\nPatratu\n\nRANCHI\n\nGola\n\nSilli\n\nKhunti\n\nMango\n\nJamshedpur\n\nChakradharpur\n\nSimdega\n\nChaibasa\n\nGhatshila\n\nChakulia\n\nBahalda\n\nHat Gamaharia\n\nNoamundi\n\nO R I S S A\n\nW E S T\nB E N G A L\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nState Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nProject Road\n\nNational Highway\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nState Boundary\n\n22  00'No\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n84  00'E\n\no\n87  00'E\n\n22  00'No\n\n0\n9\n-\n0\n7\n8\n9\n \nH\nR\n\n\f \n\nI.  \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto India for the Jharkhand State Roads Project.  \n \n\nII.  \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nIndia's achievement in economic growth and poverty reduction in recent years has been \nremarkable. The reforms initiated in 1991 are widely considered to have resulted in more rapid \neconomic  growth.  India's  per  capita  income  grew  at  a  moderate  rate  of  3.8%  per  annum  in \nFY1992\u2013FY2002, and increased more rapidly at a rate of 7.0% per annum in FY2003\u2013FY2008. \nThe poverty incidence fell from 36% in FY1993 to 27.5% in FY2004.1 However more than 300 \nmillion  people  still  live  below  the  poverty  line.  Regional  imbalances  and  disparities  in  income \nand  poverty  persist.  While  the  poverty  incidence  is  less  than  15%  in  some  northwestern  and \nsouthern states, in many central eastern states more than 40% of the population remains below \nthe poverty line.  \n \nJharkhand  is  one  of  four  Indian  states  with  a  poverty  incidence  above  40%. 2  It  was \n3. \ncreated  in  2000  from  the  southern  half  of  the  state  of  Bihar.  Jharkhand\u2019s  population  is  about \n26.9 million (26% of which is tribal), with an area of 79,714 km2. Compared to the current state \nof Bihar, Jharkhand is less-densely populated, and its population is still highly rural.3 While the \nstate\u2019s  socioeconomic  indicators  are  generally  better  than  those  of  Bihar,  they  still  lag  behind \nthe average for India in terms of income, literacy, health, and access to basic amenities.   \n \n4. \nOn the other hand, the state is one of the richest in India in terms of natural and mineral \nresources.  Forest  cover  is  high  (about  30%),  and  the  state  has  extensive  mineral  resources, \nwith India\u2019s largest deposits of iron ore, copper ore, mica, and uranium; second-largest deposits \nof chrome; and third-largest deposits of coal and bauxite. This has produced a number of highly \nindustrialized cities, such as Jamshedpur, Bokaro, and Dhanbad.   \n \nThe  state\u2019s  recent  economic  development  has  been  impressive,  due  to  the  increasing \n5. \ndemand for raw materials. Per capita income increased by 85% from the creation of Jharkhand \nin  2000  to  2006,  compared  with  the  average  national  increase  of  54%  over  the  same  period. \nHowever,  in  absolute  terms,  the  state\u2019s  per  capita  income  is  still  27%  below  the  average  for \nIndia.  \n \n6. \nThe  state  is  along  the  main  transport  corridor  connecting  New  Delhi  (the  capital)  and \nKolkata  (India\u2019s  third  largest  city).  The  state's  industrial  areas  are  concentrated  in  the  central \nand  eastern  parts  of  Jharkhand,  and  are  fairly  well  served  by  both  the  railway  network  and \nnational highways. The state's two airports (at Ranchi and Jamshedpur) also serve these areas. \nRoads are the main means of transport in the rest of the rural areas, where 78% of the state's \npopulation lives.  \n \n7. \nJharkhand\u2019s  road  network  includes  1,844  kilometers  (km)  of  national  highways,  1,886 \nkm  of  state  highways,  4,155  km  of  major  district  roads,  and  about  6,300  km  of  rural  roads.4 \n                                                 \n1  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008.

Delhi. \n\n3   When Bihar was divided, Jharkhand received 46% of the state\u2019s land but just 25% of the population. \n4  Including other district roads and village roads. \n\n\f 2 \n\nJharkhand has 58 km of road per 100,000 population (compared to the average for India of 257 \nkm per 100,000 population), and a road density of 18 km per 100 square km (km2), (compared \nto the average for India of 75 km per 100 km2). The state\u2019s road penetration is inadequate, with \nsome 74% of communities not connected with all-weather roads.  \n \n8. \nThe condition of the roads in Jharkhand is very poor. In 2002, 60% of the state's national \nhighways  and  state  highways  were  in  bad  condition,  with  half  of  them  barely  drivable.  The \nsituation  has  improved  little  in  the  last  6  years,  and  can  be  attributed  to  longstanding \nunderinvestment in road construction and maintenance; this has contributed to the poor state of \nroad infrastructure in many other Indian states as well.    \n \n9. \nThree organizations are involved in the management of road infrastructure in Jharkhand. \nThe  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  is  entrusted  to  maintain  and  improve,  under  the \nNational Highway Development Program, key sections of national highways including a 190 km \nstretch  of  National  Highway  2  (NH2)  forming  part  of  the  Delhi\u2013Kolkata  link  of  the  \u201cGolden \nQuadrilateral.\u201d Other national highways, state highways, and district roads (totaling about 6,900 \nkm) are the responsibility of the Road Construction Department (RCD) of the state government \nof  Jharkhand  (GOJH).  Other  district  roads  and  village  roads  are  under  the  Rural  Works \nDepartment,  which  executes  the  rural  roads  improvement  scheme  under  the  Pradhan  Mantri \nGram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY).5  \n \n10. \nRCD is the nodal department in the state for overall development of road infrastructure. \nRecognizing  the  importance  of  road  infrastructure  for  the  state's  economic  development  and \nreduction  of  poverty,  GOJH  has  steadily  increased  the  budgetary  allocation  to  RCD  from  $65 \nmillion  in  FY2003  to  $187  million  in  FY2008.  The  share  of  the  budget  allocated  to  road \nmaintenance ranged from 10% to 15% of the overall budget during this period. Budget utilization \nfor capital investment improved significantly in FY2008, but has been stagnant for maintenance, \nat around 85%. Considering the relatively small size of its road network and the lean structure of \nRCD, the constraints on road maintenance appear to be related to RCD\u2019s institutional capacity \nto utilize allocated funds efficiently, rather than the size of the budget allocation. \n \n11. \nJharkhand in 2000.  A design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  \n\nThe Project will be the first major road infrastructure development since the creation of \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nMain Sector Issues  \n\n \n\na. \n\nIn-State Disparities \n\n \nJharkhand has a few prominent industrial centers, dense forest that covers 30% of the \n12. \nland  area,  and  mostly  unirrigated  agricultural  land.  The  incidence  of  urban  poverty  is  23%, \nwhich is much lower than neighboring Bihar and Orissa, but the rural poverty incidence is 49% \n(the highest in India), pointing to a sharp urban\u2013rural divide.  \n \n13. \nIndustrial activities in Jharkhand are concentrated in the area south of NH2, which links \nDelhi  to  Kolkata.  The  area  northeast  of  NH2  (called  Santhal  Parganas)  lacks  major  industrial \nactivities despite its rich mineral reserves. It is heavily forested, and its rural population is mainly \nengaged in subsistence farming. There are no major national highways or high-standard state \nhighways  connecting  Santhal  Parganas  to  NH2,  to  the  state  capital  (Ranchi)  or  to  outside \n                                                 \n5 Meaning \"Prime Minister's Rural Roads Program.\"  \n\n\f  3\n\neconomic  centers.  Rail  service  in  this  area  is  also  marginal.  Poor  transport  has  been  a  factor \nconstraining the development of this part of the state. Jharkhand needs to significantly improve \nits road network to reduce intrastate disparities and accelerate the pace of economic growth and \npoverty reduction. \n \n\nb. \n\nInstitutional Capacity \n\n \n14. \nJharkhand\u2019s  RCD  is  a  new  organization  created  out  of  the  old  (pre-Jharkhand)  Bihar \nRCD.  The  road  network  in  Jharkhand  comprises  about  one-third  (in  terms  of  length)  of  the \nnational and state highways and major district roads in the former undivided state of Bihar, but \nthe allocation of RCD staff to Jharkhand was not proportional. With the exception of executive \nengineers  for  works  implementation,  Jharkhand\u2019s  RCD  has  far  fewer  engineers  of  all  types.6 \nThe staff shortage is particularly acute at RCD headquarters, where planning and management \ntakes place. \n  \n15. \nThe  lean  structure  and  recent  formation  of  Jharkhand\u2019s  RCD  has  some  limited  but \nimportant positive impacts. RCD\u2019s staff outsources all works\u2014including maintenance works\u2014to \ncivil  works  contractors.  Supervision  consultants  are  used  for  larger  contracts.  RCD  has  been \nfreed of the financial burden and inefficiency of engaging laborers directly to carry out works on \nits own. Staff costs, which equaled 20.2% of RCD expenditures in FY2008, are declining, and \ndo not place a major burden on the budget.  \n \n16. \nSome  mid-level  RCD  staff  have  experience  in  externally  funded  projects  from  their \ninvolvement in the World Bank-financed Bihar Plateau Development Project in the 1990s. This \nexperience  has  facilitated  the  project  team's  policy  dialogue  with  GOJH.  Overall  Jharkhand\u2019s \nRCD  is  more  receptive  to  new  ideas  and  the  adoption  of  international  best  practices  than  its \nolder, better-staffed peer organizations in other states.     \n \n \n \n17. \nAddressing  regional  disparities  is  a  pillar  of  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  11th  Five  Year \nPlan  (FYP)  for  2007\u20132012. 7   Poor  infrastructure  is  widely  recognized  as  one  of  the  biggest \nconstraints to poverty reduction. The 11th FYP maintains the same emphasis on development \nof infrastructure and continues the national programs initiated in 10th FYP, such as the National \nHighway Development Program and Bharat Nirman,8 while introducing various fiscal incentives \nand directly targeted programs to remove infrastructure bottlenecks. \n \n18. \nState roads in India are the responsibility of the state governments, and the Government \nhas  historically  limited  its  involvement  to  transferring  financial  resources  to  the  state \ngovernments  for  general  road  maintenance  and  removal  of  specific  bottlenecks,  such  as \nbridges. However, these transfers have been insufficient, and additional problems have arisen \nincluding (i) financial resources thinly spread for too many projects; (ii) delays in preconstruction \nactivities;  (iii)  weak  management  by  contractors;  and  (iv)  poor  implementation  capacity,  as \nacknowledged by the Government in its 11th FYP. The result is the generally poor condition of \nstate highways found throughout India.  \n                                                 \n6   For  example,  Jharkhand  RCD  has  only  three  chief  engineers  and  11  superintending  engineers.  Bihar  RCD  has \nseven chief engineers and 28 superintending engineers. Jharkhand RCD has only seven executive engineers for \nsurvey, planning and design, whereas Bihar RCD has 21 for these functions.    \n\nStrategies of the Central Government and GOJH \n\n7  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008.

Since 2001 ADB \nhas extended assistance for state roads to Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, \nand West Bengal states. Jharkhand will be the sixth state to receive ADB assistance for its state \nroads.  \n \n20. \nGOJH  has  initiated  several  reforms,  based  on  lessons  from  other  states  in  India  that \nhave received external assistance. The Jharkhand Highway Act was enacted in 2006 to provide \na legal framework for overall highway corridor management by GOJH and future establishment \nof a highway authority. Rules under the act came into force in 2007. RCD has drafted its own \nPublic Works Department (PWD) code to replace the Bihar PWD code that is currently in use. \nRCD also entered into a project development agreement with Infrastructure Leasing & Financial \nServices  to  identify  highway  schemes  and  projects  that  could  be  undertaken  under  public\u2013\nprivate partnership options. A special-purpose vehicle has been formed for this purpose. GOJH \nhas been proactive in creating an enabling environment for private sector participation. \n \n \n \n21. \nSubstantial external assistance has been provided to India for roads. ADB has provided \nabout  $3.7  billion  in  loans  and  technical  assistance  (TA),  and  the  World  Bank  has  provided \nloans and grants totaling $5.6 billion for upgrading national highways, improving state highways, \nand  upgrading  rural  roads.  The  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  (currently \nknown as Japan International Cooperation Agency [JICA]) has provided five loans for a total of \n$0.33  billion  to  upgrade  national  highways  and  construct  bridges.  The  Department  for \nInternational Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom has provided TA to support the sector, \nincluding  financing  for  project  preparatory  TA  (PPTA)  for  the  Project. 9  A  TA  for  institutional \nstrengthening  is  being  processed  as  part  of  a  TA  cluster\u2014also  to  be  financed  by  DFID\u2014for \npoverty  reduction  in  India.  ADB  support  has  been  developed  in  close  collaboration  with  these \nkey  development  partners\u2014ADB  and  DFID  hold  regular  coordination  meetings,  and  active \ncoordination has been undertaken with the World Bank. Mini-retreats for transport operations in \nSouth  Asia  have  become  a  regular  practice  for  ADB  headquarters  staff,  while  a  broad-based \nsector  collaboration  mechanism  has  been  instituted  to  facilitate  the  exchange  of  information \nbetween  key  sector  coordinators  of  the  resident  missions  of  both  ADB  and  the  World  Bank. \nCooperation with the Government of Japan has also been active, particularly for the railway and \nurban subsectors.  \n \nSince 2001, ADB has provided six loans to improve India\u2019s state road network (to West \n22. \nBengal in 2001,10 Madhya Pradesh in 200211 and 2007,12 Chhattisgarh in 2003,13 Uttarakhand \n\n                                                 \n9   Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  State  Roads  Projects  in  Chhattisgarh  and  Jharkhand,  processed  in \n2007  as  a  component  technical  assistance  under  ADB.  2006.

The  Project  is  relevant  to  achieving  the  result  of  the  country  partnership  strategy.  An \nanalysis of India's state road subsector is in Appendix 2. A summary of external assistance to \nthe roads sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n \n \n24. \nKey  recommendations  of  ADB\u2019s  2007  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  (SAPE) \ninclude the following: (i) work closely with the EA to identify and resolve problems that lead to \nimplementation delay; (ii) give equal emphasis to good portfolio management and the volume of \nloan  approvals;  and  (iii)  take  into  account  local  variations  in  implementation  capabilities  and \nmake  better  use  of  past  experience  to  improve  the  design  of  future  projects. 18   These \nrecommendations were fully considered in designing and implementing PPTA for the Project. A \nsimple project design based on a project lending modality to focus on proper execution of core \nRCD  functions  has  been  adopted,  in  consideration  of  RCD's  relatively  low  staffing  level  and \nlimited exposure to externally  assisted projects. Detailed action plans have been drawn up for \npreconstruction  activities,  and  form  the  basis  for  ongoing  support  in  safeguard,  procurement, \nand  financial  management  by  ADB  consultants  and  missions.  A  unit  has  been  created  within \nRCD for project formulation and implementation, and key positions have been filled by officials \nwho  have  undergone  ADB  training  on  project  management.  ADB  will  provide  TA  to  continue \nproject management support and assist RCD in strengthening its core technical functions. \n  \n25. \nThe  2007  SAPE  also  recommends  further  support  for  private  sector  participation.  The \nimplementation  of  public\u2013private  partnership  projects  has  faced  roadblocks  in  Jharkhand  as  a \nresult of a lack of investor interest.19 This was considered in developing the Project's financing \nand  execution  modality.  The  Project  will  be  the  first  major  infrastructure  development  project \n\n                                                \n \n14 ADB.  2006.

To  attract \ninvestors to the highway portions, the National Highways Authority of India has recast these build\u2013operate\u2013transfer \nprojects on an annuity basis, in which contractors that are awarded projects would be paid a guaranteed amount in \ninstallments, thus eliminating the risk of investors recovering their investment through tolls. \n\n\f 6 \n\ninvolving  external  financiers  and  following  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  which \nare  themselves  new  challenges  for  the  state.  The  Project  will  showcase  the  adoption  of \ninternational best practices in a local context, and aim to instill confidence in the private sector in \nentering  into  a  longer-term  partnership  that  is  not  limited  to  project\u2019s  design  and  construction \nphases.  \n \n26. \nThe  2007  SAPE  further  recommends  that  policy  dialogue  be  strengthened  regarding \nroad safety, sector governance and corruption, and achieving socially inclusive objectives. Road \nsafety  has  been  addressed  by  adopting  a  wider  right-of-way  that  provides  adequate  space \noutside the roadway for pedestrians and nonmotorized traffic. The detailed design was reviewed \nfrom  a  road  safety  viewpoint  and  changes  made  to  improve  road  geometry.  A  full-fledged \nfinance  and  accounting  unit  for  project  implementation,  staffed  with  qualified  officials  and \nequipped  with  internal  audit  mechanisms,  has  been  largely  established,  with  rules  and \nprocedures  for  the  unit  already  in  place.  The  selection  of  the  project  location  is  in  itself  an \nexpression of GOJH's focus on socially inclusive development. In the course of social analysis \nand  resettlement  plan  preparation,  project  communities  were  consulted  on  the  project  design \nthrough intensive stakeholder consultation.20  \n \n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n27. \nThe  Project  will  improve  transport  connectivity  in  the  state  of  Jharkhand  through \nimprovement of a key state road section in one of the state\u2019s least developed but resource-rich \nareas. This will contribute to expansion of economic opportunities and poverty reduction in the \narea  that  the  project  road  serves,  and  in  turn  lead  to  balanced  development  and  overall \neconomic well-being of the state. Since Jharkhand is one of the least-developed states in terms \nof  social  and  economic  indicators,  this  development  is  expected  to  contribute  to  the  overall \nreduction of interstate disparities in India. \n \n28. \narea resulting from reduction in vehicle operating costs and travel time on the project road.       \n \nB. \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  immediate  outcome  will  be  improved  transport  connectivity  in  the  project \n\nOutputs \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  improve  a  311  km  state  road  from  Govindpur  to \nSahebganj  (via  Jamtara,  Dumka,  and  Barhet)  to  a  two-lane  standard.  The  improved  road  will \nbecome a backbone of the northeastern part of the state, and connect this part to NH2, and to \nthe larger national highway network. A description of the project roads and a summary of design \nstandards are in Appendix 4. \n \n30. \nThe Project will also enhance project management skills of the officials of RCD through \ninvolvement  under  the  Project  in  activities  that  are  central  to  project  implementation,  such  as \nproject  design,  implementation  planning,  procurement,  land  acquisition,  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation,  environmental  management,  utility  shifting,  contract  management,  and  financial \nmanagement.  Systems  to  enhance  project  management  skills\u2014such  as  a  management \ninformation system and a quality assurance system\u2014will be developed as part of this exercise. \nThis approach will be replicated by RCD for future road improvement projects.  \n\n                                                 \n20  During the course of social assessment, 14 focus group discussions were organized. Resettlement plans based on \na complete (100% coverage) census of affected persons are already in place. Preparation of the plans involved 17 \nblock-level meetings. \n\n\f  7\n\nSpecial Features \n\nC.  \n \n31. \nThis is the first ADB intervention in the transport sector in Jharkhand, which is a newly-\ncreated state. Jharkhand\u2019s RCD has had no experience with externally financed projects since \nseparating from Bihar\u2019s RCD. A simple design has therefore been adopted for the Project, which \nwill  allow  RCD  to  concentrate  on  its  core  mandate:  improving  and  maintaining  the  assets  it  is \nresponsible  for  in  a  good  state.  The  Project  will  adopt  international  best  practices  in \nprocurement  and  contract  management,  e.g.,  international  competitive  bidding,  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \nInternationale des Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseils (FIDIC)-based contracts, and outsourcing of construction \nsupervision.  It  is  expected  that  these  arrangements  will  facilitate  participation  of  qualified \ncontractors.  Contracts  will  be  provided  in  large  packages  to  experienced  and  qualified \ncontractors who will transfer the necessary technical and managerial skills to local contractors \nthrough  association-type  subcontracts.  RCD  officials  will  be  exposed  to  international  best \npractices  in  project  management  through  the  use  of  a  computerized  financial  management \nsystem  and  a  management  information  system,  which  will  be  linked  to  a  quality  assurance \nsystem to be established by the construction supervision consultant (CSC). \n  \n32. \nADB  will  continue  its  assistance  to  RCD  in  preconstruction  activities  under  a  newly \napproved TA for Capacity Development to Enhance Project Readiness and Results Monitoring \nfor Transport Projects, financed by the Government of Japan.21 Assistance will be provided for \nprocurement, social safeguard, and environmental impact management.  \n  \n33. \nTo  further  strengthen  its  project  management  capacity,  a  capacity  development  TA  for \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  Jharkhand  road  sector  has  been  developed  in  the  amount  of \n$750,000,  which  is  included  in  a  TA  cluster  for  Advanced  Project  Preparedness  for  Poverty \nReduction  in  India,  financed  by  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom.22  Consultants  to  be \nengaged  under  the  TA  will  assist  the  RCD  in  (i)  improving  its  business  procedure  for  project \nmanagement and asset management; (ii) adopting best practices and tools for project planning, \ndesign,  road  asset  management,  and  road  safety;  and  (iii)  enhancing  its  staff's  skills  through \ndedicated, structured training on these issues.  \n \n34. \nThe  scope  of  the  TA  may  also  include  assistance  in  (i)  establishing  Jharkhand\u2019s  state \nengineering  academy,  (ii)  strengthening  RCD\u2019s  central  design  office,  and  (iii) establishing  a \ncentral  testing  laboratory.  Advisory  assistance  will  be  provided  under  the  grant-financed  TA, \nwhile necessary equipment and facilities will be financed out of ADB loan proceeds.  \n \nD.  \n \n35. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $240.0 million, including taxes and duties of \nabout  $21  million.  The  total  cost  includes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and \nother charges during implementation (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are \nin Appendix 5. \n \n36. \nADB will finance the local taxes and duties, estimated at $21 million.

The construction part of the civil works contract \nwill be for 36 months (June 2010 to May 2013), followed by a 1-year defects notification period. \nThe  CSC  will  be  engaged  2  months  prior  to  commencement  of  civil  works  to  assist  RCD  in \npreparatory  activities,  and  continue  to  be  engaged  until  the  expiry  of  the  12-month  defects \nnotification period in May 2014. An indicative implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n43. \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  proposed  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational competitive bidding will be used for all civil works contracts. Shopping will be used \nfor  goods  with  supply  contracts  estimated  at  less  than  $100,000.  Advance  contracting  and \nretroactive  financing  will  be  used  to  facilitate  rapid  implementation.  A  procurement  plan  is  in \nAppendix 8. \n \n\n4.  \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsultants under the Project will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \n44. \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  RCD  will  select  and  engage  a \n\n                                                 \n23 The PIC was established in March 2008.  \n\n\f 10 \n\nconsulting firm as CSC, which will assume the role of the \u201cengineer\u201d for the civil works contracts. \nThe CSC will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection procedure with a quality\u2013cost \nratio of 80:20.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n45. \nADB  approved  advance  contracting  of  civil  works  in  July  2008.  An  EA  procurement \ncapacity  assessment  was  carried  out  during  loan  processing  with  positive  findings  on  both \norganizational and procedural aspects (Supplementary Appendix C). It is expected that RCD\u2019s \nprocurement  activities  for  works,  equipment,  and  consulting  services  will  progress  to  an \nadvanced  stage  in  which  contracts  may  be  ready  to  be  awarded  before  loan  effectiveness. \nBased on this, the Government and GOJH requested that the scope of advance contracting be \nenlarged to cover procurement of equipment and retroactive financing for works, equipment and \nconsulting  services.  Up  to  20%  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing, \nprovided  that  expenditures  are  incurred  on  works,  equipment,  and  consulting  services  for  the \nProject (i) prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months prior to signing of the loan \nagreement; and (ii) in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines, Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants,  and  safeguard  policies.  The  Government  and  GOJH  have  been  informed  that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to \nfinance the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n46. \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  GOJH.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  and  examine,  directly  or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. \nIn particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n47. \nGOJH  will  also  (i)  establish  a  separate  finance  and  accounts  wing  within  the  PIC; \n(ii) introduce a financial management system prior to commencement of project implementation, \nfor  which  a  firm  of  consultants  has  been  appointed  under  GOJH  financing;  (iii)  engage  an \ninternal auditor to be placed in PIC for verification of records and reports; (iv) post signboards at \nthe  worksites  furnishing  relevant  contract  details;  and  (v) provide  information  on  procurement \nand  progress  of  project  implementation  on  its  website.  In  addition,  GOJH  will  assign  a  senior \nfinance  and  accounts  officer  from  its  accountant  general's  office  to  the  PIC  to  ensure  proper \nrecording of financial matters. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n48. \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Reimbursement procedures will be used for civil works, \nconsulting  services,  and  equipment.  The  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to \nreimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 equivalent per individual payment. \n \n\n\f  11\n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49. \nRCD  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  expenditures  incurred,  and  the  use  of  local  funds \nunder the project components. The accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting \nprinciples.  Independent  auditors,  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  audit  the  accounts  and  related \nfinancial statements annually. The Government will submit consolidated annual audited reports \nand  related  financial  statements  to  ADB  within  6  months  from  the  end  of  the  previous  fiscal \nyear. The annual audit report will include an audit of the statement of  expenditure procedures \nand  will  include  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  compliance  with \nstatement of expenditure procedures. \n \nRCD will prepare and provide ADB with quarterly project progress reports, including any \n50. \nchanges  to  the  implementation  schedule,  problems  or  difficulties  encountered  and  remedial \nactions  taken,  anticipated  problems  and  the  proposed  remedial  measures,  and  work  to  be \nundertaken in the following period. RCD will submit the quarterly progress reports to ADB within \n45 days from the close of each quarter. These reports will include a summary financial account \nfor  each  contract,  expenditures  to  date,  reports  on  performance  monitoring,  and  results  of \nmonitoring of social and environmental impacts. \n \nRCD will prepare and provide ADB  with a project completion report within 3 months of \n51. \ncompletion of transactions under the Project. This report will provide a detailed evaluation of the \ndesign,  costs,  contractors\u2019  and  consultants\u2019  performance,  social  and  economic  impact, \neconomic rate of return, and other details relating to the Project as may be requested by ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n52. \nA project performance monitoring system for the Project has been developed under the \nPPTA in consultation with the RCD. Baseline data have also been collected under the PPTA, as \npart  of  social  assessment  and  traffic  survey  for  economic  analysis.  The  system  will  be  further \nrefined during the inception stage of the Project with the assistance of the CSC. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n53. \nADB and RCD will meet regularly as required to discuss the progress of the Project and \nany  changes  to  implementation  arrangements  or  remedial  measures  required  to  achieve  the \nproject  objectives.  They  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  focusing  on  issues  related  to \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  agree  on  changes,  if  needed,  to  achieve  the  project \nobjectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Economic and Financial Justification \n\nA. \n \nThe  approach  used  to  evaluate  the  Project  follows  the  standard  practice  of  comparing \n54. \ninvestment costs and road user costs with and without the Project, using net present value with \na  12%  discount  rate  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  decision  criterion.  The \nHighway  Development  and  Management  Model  (HDM-4)  was  used  for  the  analysis.  The \nanalysis  focuses  on  savings  in  direct  transport  costs  in  terms  of  vehicle  operating  costs  and \nvalue of passenger time. Value added from better transport links resulting in new industries and \nemployment  are  not  quantified  in  this  analysis  but  are  partially  captured  through  benefits  to \n\n\f 12 \n\ngenerated traffic. Other benefits such as flood mitigation, crop spoilage savings and safety are \nalso not quantified, so the results presented here can be considered conservative. \n \n55. \nThe  proposed  improvements  of  the  project  road  are  economically  viable  yielding  an \noverall EIRR of 21%. Among the four contract packages, three have EIRRs above 20% and one \nhas  an  EIRR  of  17.6%.  The  Project  is  very  robust  with  a  high  economic  rate  of  return  and \nsatisfies the economic efficiency criterion. \n \nThe sensitivity of the EIRR for the project road was analyzed with respect to changes in \n56. \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The \ntest  cases  were  examined: \nfollowing  sensitivity \n(i) construction costs increase by 15%; (ii) no time savings; (iii) benefits decrease by 15%; and \n(iv) costs increase by 15%, and benefits decrease by 15%. The results show that the quantified \neconomic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests and all road sections have an EIRR of \nmore than 12% in all sensitivity tests. In the worst case scenario, the EIRR for the Project as a \nwhole is 17% and the lowest EIRR of any individual contract package is 14%. More details of \nthe economic assessment are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n57. \n \nB. \n \n58. \nPoverty Reduction and Social Impact. According to the National Human Development \nReport 2001,  24 the state of Jharkhand, along with the neighboring states of Bihar, Orissa, and \nUttar  Pradesh,  consistently  ranks  among  the  poorest  performers  in  terms  of  nearly  all  of  21 \nindicators  (including  demographic,  health  care,  education,  unemployment,  poverty,  and  social \ndeprivation  indicators).  Although  Jharkhand  has  many  natural  resources  (e.g.,  coal,  iron,  and \nforests), 80% of the population is engaged in a combination of low-skilled occupations such as \nsubsistence  agriculture,  nonagricultural  labor  and  small  business  or  petty  trade.  Due  to  the \nsmall  size  of  average  landholdings  (0.4\u20130.8  hectares),  having  more  than  one  livelihood  is \nnecessary  to  supplement  the  basic  income  and  subsistence  harvests  generated  through  rain-\nfed agriculture.  \n\nAs the Project is non-revenue-generating, the FIRR was not calculated.  \n\nSocial Aspects \n\nJharkhand lags behind most other Indian states in terms of road connectivity, resulting in \n59. \nhigh  transportation  costs  and  long  travel  times  to  traverse  even  short  distances  within  the \nstate. 25   A  poverty  and  social  assessment  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation.  The \nassessment  indicated  that  by  rehabilitating  the  proposed  Govindpur\u2013Sahebganj  road,  travel \ntime  will  be  reduced  by  as  much  as  half.  Reduced  travel  times  and  costs  will  mean  better \naccess  for  local  communities  to  markets  and  social  services  such  as  education  and  health. \nThese improvements will lead to increased human, physical, financial, and social capital within \nthe  project  districts,  thereby  helping  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  inclusive  growth.  A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy report is in Appendix 9.  \n\n60. \nGender. In Jharkhand, the gender ratio of the population is 941 females for every 1,000 \nmales (2001 census). The literacy rate for females (38.9%) is low in comparison to the national \nlevel (53.7%, in the 2001 census). A gender analysis was undertaken during the social study to \nassess  the  impact  of  the  Project.  Six  focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  with  women \nbelonging  to  different  socioeconomic  groups,  such  as  the  scheduled  tribes  and  the  scheduled \ncastes.  The  discussions  revealed  that  women  in  the  project  area  are  engaged  mainly  in \n\n                                                 \n24  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2001. National Human Development Report 2001. New Delhi. \n25 It  currently  takes  6  hours  to  travel  by  4-wheel-drive  vehicle  along  the  project  road  from  Govindpur  to  Dumka,  a \n\ndistance of only 145 km. \n\n\f  13\n\nhousehold  chores  and  farming.  At  the  primary  level,  the  enrollment  ratio  of  male  and  female \nstudents is about equal, but as the school level increases female enrollment begins to decrease. \nThe dropout rate for girls is especially high after middle school due to (i) lack of higher education \nopportunities  within  the  villages  they  inhabit,  and  (ii)  difficulties  involved  in  traveling  back  and \nforth  to  such  schools  located  outside  the  villages.  Access  to  health  facilities  is  also  nearly \nimpossible for many women at night and during the rainy season, jeopardizing the lives of both \nmother and child in emergencies during childbirth. Women at the focus group discussions said \nthat the Project would considerably improve their access to higher education, better health care \nservices  outside  their  villages,  and  markets,  and  would  provide  access  to  better  employment \nopportunities for both women and men.   \n\n61. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement.  The  Project  was  developed  with  a  view  to  minimizing  the \nneed for land acquisition. A census survey based on the detailed design was undertaken from \nJanuary to August 2008 to assess the resettlement impacts. On average, the existing road will \nbe widened to 30\u201345 meters, and a total of 150 hectares of private land needs to be acquired. \nThe  census  identified  a  total  of  4,515  households  whose  assets  will  be  impacted,  including \n4,143  agricultural  plots,  1,489  residential  structures  and  680  commercial  or  commercial-cum-\nresidential structures. In 93% of all cases involving land, these impacts will affect less than 10% \nof  the  area  of  the  plot.  In  terms  of  structures,  56%  of  impacts  will  affect  only  boundary  walls, \ngates and gardens with little or no impacts on the main structures.  \n\n62. \nFour  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Government's  National \nRehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Policy  2007,  Land  Acquisition  Act  (1894),  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) to address the losses of people affected by the Project. \nDetails  of  compensation  rates  for  the  loss  of  land  and  structures  at  replacement  cost,  shifting \nassistance,  transitional  assistance,  and  income  restoration  assistance  are  provided  in  the \nentitlement  matrix  of  the  resettlement  plans.  Additional  support  provisions  for  affected  people \nbelonging  to  vulnerable  groups  are  also  included  in  the  resettlement  plans.  The  total  cost  for \nresettlement is estimated at $16.2 million. A summary of the resettlement plans is in Appendix \n10.   \n\n63. \nIndigenous  People.  The  project  road  runs  through  a  part  of  Jharkhand  known  as \nSanthal Parganas. All six project-affected districts have Santhal populations. The Santhals are \none of the largest tribal communities in India and are distributed widely throughout the states of \nWest  Bengal,  Bihar,  Jharkhand,  Assam,  and  Orissa.  Taking  into  account  the  significant \npresence of scheduled tribes in the project area, detailed social assessments were undertaken \nto study the potentially different impacts of the Project on tribal and nontribal households. The \nresults  clearly  showed  that  tribal  households  in  the  project  area  have  similar  socioeconomic \ncharacteristics to the overall population and are largely assimilated into the local communities. It \nis not expected that the Project will have any differential impacts on tribal population. However, \nspecific provisions have been incorporated in the entitlement matrix of the resettlement plans to \nmitigate project impacts on tribal households. \n\n64. \nHIV/AIDS  and  Human  Trafficking.  The state of Jharkhand has been categorized as a \n\u201clow  prevalence  state,\u201d  with  258  officially  reported  cases  of  HIV/AIDS  infection  as  of  August \n2006.26 Similarly, interactions with stakeholders at the district and block levels revealed that no \ncases  of  either  HIV/AIDS  or  human  trafficking  were  reported  during  the  course  of  the  social \nassessments.  Awareness  campaigns  and  programs  are  organized  in  villages  on  a  monthly \nbasis.  However,  RCD  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contractors  disseminate  information  at \nworksites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for those employed during \n\n                                                 \n26 National AIDS Control Organization, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 2007. HIV Fact Sheets. Delhi.  \n\n\f 14 \n\nconstruction.  All  civil  works  contracts  will  include  specific  clauses  on  these  undertakings,  and \nRCD, with support from the CSC, will strictly monitor compliance during project implementation. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects  \n\nC. \n \n65. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  Project  is  also  classified  as  a  category  B \nproject  in  accordance  with  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  environmental  impact  assessment \nrequirements.  However,  expansion  of  the  carriageway  requires  some  forest  land  to  be \nconverted as part of the right of way. The Forest Act requires that forest clearance be obtained \nfrom  the  regional  office  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest.  An  assistant  director  has \nbeen  added  to  the  PIC  to  deal  with  the  environmental  aspects  of  the  Project,  which  include \nobtaining the forest clearance, implementing any conditions attached to forest clearance, as well \nas  implementing  the  overall  environmental  management  plan,  and  conducting  environmental \nmonitoring.   \n \nBased on the project categorization, an environmental assessment study was carried out \n66. \nunder the PPTA. The findings of the environmental assessment study, which are presented in \nthe  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report,  indicate  that  the  Project  is  not  expected  to \npresent any major environmental and ecological concerns. Most impacts will be temporary, and \noccur  during  construction.  The  main  causes  are  land  clearing  for  widening  the  roadway, \nearthwork  involving  cut  and  fill,  and  quarrying  and  transportation  of  construction  materials  to \nsupport construction activities. After the opening of the improved roads, direct local impacts will \nbe  mostly  related  to  road  accidents.  The  IEE  report  details  mitigation  measures  to  minimize \nthese  adverse  impacts  presented  in  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  to  guide \nimplementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  by  civil  works  contractors,  CSC,  and  RCD.  To \nensure strict implementation of the EMP by the civil works contractors, the EMP will be included \nin  the  bidding  document.  The  PIC,  assisted  by  the  CSC,  will  supervise  and  monitor \nimplementation by the contractor of the mitigation measures stated in the EMP. In addition, the \nPIC,  in  close  coordination  with  relevant  state  agencies  (such  as  the  Forest  Department  and \nJharkhand Pollution Control Board) will be responsible for carrying out environmental monitoring \nand preparing an environmental monitoring report on behalf of RCD. A summary IEE report is in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  SAPE  identified  issues  relating  to  state  road  projects  in  India,  including  (i)  initial \n67. \nimplementation  delays,  (ii)  risk  of  incomplete  network  development  resulting  from  avoiding \nareas \n(iii) \nappropriateness of the sector development framework, and (iv) a need for government discipline \nto efficiently and effectively secure the maintenance budget.  \n \n68. \nThe  risk  of  initial  delays  has  already  been  largely  mitigated  through  RCD\u2019s  advance \nactions  and  support  provided  by  ADB  under  the  PPTA  (footnote  9)  and  the  newly  approved \ncapacity  development  TA  (footnote  21)  for  various  preconstruction  activities.  District-level  task \nforces  have  been  formed  for  interdepartmental  coordination.  Training  on  procurement  and \nsafeguard requirements was provided to RCD staff and staff of other concerned departments to \nmitigate  the  risk  of  initial  delays  due  to  lack  of  coordination,  and  poor  understanding  of  ADB \nrequirements. \n \n69. \nThe  risks  related  to  obtaining  the  statutory  environmental  and  forest  clearance  could \nalso delay the civil works and could lead to increased construction costs and delays in project \n\nresettlement  and  are  environmentally  sensitive, \n\ninvoluntary \n\nrequire \n\nRisks  \n\nthat \n\n\f  15\n\ncompletion.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  RCD  has  taken  advance  actions  to  obtain  the  requisite \nclearances.  An  environmental  clearance  has  already  been  obtained  from  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment and Forest. Proposals for forest clearance have also been submitted to the district \nforest  offices.  The  high-level  project  coordination  committee  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary  is \nclosely monitoring progress on the needed clearances. \n \n70. \nProject roads were identified in accordance with the state's road development priorities. \nThe  Project  will  entail  land  acquisition  due  to  proposed  road  widening  and  construction  of \nbypasses to avoid built-up areas. Detailed planning of land acquisition and resettlement actions \nhas  been  carried  out  with  assistance  from  ADB  and  its  consultants,  and  through  extended \nconsultations with the project-affected communities.   \n \nThe risk of an unrealistic sector reform agenda has been mitigated by reflecting the state \n71. \ncontext  in  the  planned  institutional  strengthening,  which  takes  into  account  both  the  actions \nalready taken by GOJH, and the availability of resources.  \n \nIn  Jharkhand,  the  road  maintenance  budget  allocation  almost  tripled  from  FY2003  to \n72. \nFY2008.  Actual  spending  has  also  increased  steadily,  but  is  still  well  below  the  allocated \nbudget.  Securing  maintenance \nimmediate  concern.  Parallel  capacity \nis  not  an \ndevelopment TA is to be provided under the TA cluster for Advanced Project Preparedness for \nPoverty Reduction in India. Consequently, the Project will focus on improving RCD's road asset \nmanagement capability for better and more efficient usage of allocated funds (footnote 22).  \n \n\nfunds \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  governments  of  India  and  Jharkhand  have \n\nThe Government will ensure that GOJH implements the recommendations of ADB\u2019s TA \n\n73. \ngiven the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nImplementation. The Government will ensure that GOJH provides timely and adequate \n74. \ncounterpart funds and facilities for the Project, including the funds needed for implementing the \nenvironmental management plans and resettlement plans. \n \n75. \nfor Institutional Strengthening of Jharkhand Road Sector during project implementation. \n \n76. \n GOJH will cause RCD to establish a dedicated PIC within RCD, throughout the Project \nimplementation period, headed by a director reporting to the secretary, RCD, to be responsible \nfor  Project  management.  The  PIC  shall  comprise  the  PIC  director,  deputy  director,  the  officer \nsupervising  the  implementation  of  the  EMP,  and  the  officer  supervising  the  implementation  of \nthe resettlement plans. GOJH will also cause RCD to appoint requisite staff in the PIC to handle \nconsulting  services,  civil  works,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  environment  and  financial \nmanagement, including disbursement, accounting and internal auditing. \n \n77. \nGOJH will cause RCD to establish four field PIUs as part of the PIC, each headed by an \nassistant  director  (at  the  level  of  assistant  engineer)  for  each  works  contract  to  interact  on  a \nday-to-day basis with the civil works contractor and CSC. \n \n78. \nGOJH will cause RCD to (i) create a separate finance and accounts wing within the PIC; \n(ii) introduce a financial management system prior to commencement of project implementation; \n(iii)  engage  an  internal  auditor  to  be  placed  in  PIC  for  verification  of  records  and  reports;  (iv) \npost  signboards  at  the  work  sites  furnishing  relevant  details  of  the  contract;  and  (v) provide \n\n\f 16 \n\ninformation on procurement and progress of project implementation on its website.

The total road length is estimated to be about 3.4 million km. The national \nhighways are high-density interstate linkages, which comprise just 2% of the network but carry \nabout  40%  of  the  traffic.  State  highways  link  national  highways  with  district  headquarters, \nimportant towns, and minor ports, while major district roads run within districts, connecting areas \nof  production  with  markets,  and  rural  areas  to  district  headquarters,  and  state  and  national \nhighways. The secondary system comprises about 18% of the network and carries about 40% \nof the traffic. Rural roads link rural communities with the highway network, providing access to \nhigher  agricultural  incomes,  employment  opportunities,  and  social  services.  They  represent \nabout 80% of the network and carry about 20% of traffic. \n \n2. \nSustained  underinvestment  in  road  infrastructure  in  India  has  affected  all  levels  of  the \nroad network.1 National highways and the secondary system have proven inadequate to meet \nthe rapid growth in traffic. In the last decade, road-based freight traffic increased at about 12% \nper year and passenger traffic at about 8% annually, leading to congestion, road deterioration, \nand high transport costs. Widespread overloading of freight vehicles damages the road surface, \nwhile mixed use of the roadway by both motorized and nonmotorized vehicles (bicycles, animal-\ndrawn  vehicles,  etc.)  causes  congestion  and  high  levels  of  traffic  accidents.  Rural  areas  are \nhome to 70% of India\u2019s population, and many villages continue to rely on (i) earthen tracks that \nare unsuitable for motorized traffic and become impassable during the rainy season due to the \npoorly  finished  road  surface;  (ii)  missing  bridges;  and  (iii)  an  inadequate,  defective,  or \nnonexistent  drainage  structure.  Even  where  all-weather  connections  have  been  provided,  the \nstandard of rural roads is low, maintenance is poor, and many roads are in need of rehabilitation. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Strategy and Asian Development Bank Involvement \n\n3. \nTwo  major  national  initiatives  for  road  infrastructure  development  were  initiated  at  the \nturn of the century. The National Highway Development Program (NHDP) was launched in 1998 \nfor the upgrading and widening of the national highway network. For rural roads, Pradhan Mantri \nGram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)2 was initiated in 2000 as a centrally-financed scheme. This was \nlater  subsumed  within  Bharat  Nirman. 3  To  meet  the  funding  requirements,  the  Government \nestablished the Central Road Fund under the Central Road Fund Act in 2000 as a mechanism \nfor using fuel tax proceeds exclusively for road development in the country.4 An explicit tax on \n                                                 \n1  Since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 1980\u20131985, annual investments in roads varied at 0.6%\u20131.5% of gross domestic \n\nproduct, with an average of 1.1%. \n\n2  Meaning \" Prime Minister's Rural Roads Program.\" \n3  Bharat Nirman (meaning \"build India\") is a comprehensive rural infrastructure development scheme begun in 2005, \nand  consisting  of  six  components  (irrigation,  rural  housing,  rural  drinking  water,  rural  electrification,  rural \ntelecommunication, and rural roads). \n\n4 The tax was initially set at Rs1 per liter, for both gasoline and diesel, and then increased to Rs1.50 per liter (about \n$0.03  per  liter)  in  2003.  In  2004,  $438  million  from  the  Central  Road  Fund  went  to  the  construction  and \nmaintenance of national highways, $222 million to state highways, and $511 million to rural roads (Source: Ministry \nof Finance). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n21 \n\nfuel  (gasoline  and  high-speed  diesel  oil)  provides  the  funds  for  the  Central  Road  Fund,  and \ncollects around $1.23 billion yearly. The tax is first deposited in the Consolidated Fund of India \nand is then transferred into the Central Road Fund with the approval of Parliament. The Central \nRoad  Fund  is  controlled  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  Its  funds  are  allocated  for  national,  state, \nand rural roads as defined in the act. Central Road Fund allocations for the national highways \nare  earmarked  for  implementing  the  NHDP.  This  assured  revenue  stream  has  enabled  the \nNational  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  to  raise  debt  funds  to  finance  its  program.  The \ncorresponding allocations for state highways and rural roads are significant additional resources \nfor these subsectors. \n \n4. \nIndia\u2019s  11th  Five  Year  Plan  (FYP)  for  2007\u20132012  continues  to  emphasize  the \ndevelopment of physical infrastructure as the key to promoting broad-based economic growth, \ndeveloping  agriculture  and  the  rural  economy,  and  enhancing  the  competitiveness  of  Indian \nindustry  and  services.  While  the  infrastructure  development  programs  initiated  during  the  9th \nand  10th  FYPs  (including  both  the  NHDP  and  Bharat  Nirman)  will  continue,  the  Government \nplans to supplement these by setting up special economic zones and special economic regions \nto  promote  focused  infrastructure  development. 5   The  public  sector  would  take  the  lead  in \nmaking  infrastructure  investment  in  the  lagging  parts  of  India.  In  tandem,  the  Government  is \nalso  promoting  the  use  of  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  in  areas  such  as  highways,  urban \ninfrastructure,  mass  rapid-transit  systems,  and  tourism  infrastructure.  To  mobilize  long-term \nfunds  for  infrastructure  development,  the  11th  FYP  will  aim  to  develop  and  tap  the  insurance \nand  pension  industry.  In  addition,  long-term  funding  from  development  partners  such  as  ADB \nwould continue to be important, especially in view of the current financial and economic crisis.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Government Strategy and ADB Assistance \n\nItem \n\nPrimary Network: \nNational Highways \n\nSecondary Network: State \nHighways and Major District \nRoads \n\nLength  (km) \n\n60,000 \n\n600,000 \n\nGovernment \nScheme and \nImmediate \nTarget  \n\nNHDP I (Golden \nQuadrilateral) by 2007   \n\nNHDP II (north\u2013south and \neast\u2013west corridors) by \n2009 \n\nNHDP III 1st phase by 2009 \n\nSpecial Accelerated Road \nDevelopment Program for the \nNorth-Eastern Region (SARDP-\nNE) to complete by 2012 \n\nFor other states, allocation of \nfinancial support to capital \ninvestment and maintenance \n\nTertiary Network: \nRural Roads \n\n2,700,000 \n\nPMGSY: connect all \nhabitations with population \nof 1,000 and above (500 in \nthe case of hilly or tribal \nareas) by 2009 \n\nLength \nTargeted for \nImprovement  \n(km) \n\nSARDP-NE phase A to \ncomplete by 2012 \n\n6,000 under NHDP I \n\n7,300 under NHDP II \n\n10,000 under NHDP III \n\n3,251 under SARDP-NE \n\n \n\n \n\nFunding \nRequirements \nto Meet \nImmediate \nTarget  \n\nNHDP I and II: $15.1 billion \nfor capital financing \n\nNHDP III: $12.5 billion \n\n$2.7 billion for SARDP-NE \n(including secondary roads) \n\n2,500 in the northeastern region \nunder SARDP-NE \n\n \n\n370,000 under PMGSY \n\n$2.7 billion for SARDP-NE \n\n$11 billion by 2009 \n\n(including national highway) \n\n                                                 \n5  Special economic regions differ from special economic zones in that they are not eligible for export tax benefits. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n \n\nAppendix  2 \n\nItem \n\nGovernment \nFunding \nStrategy  \n\nOngoing ADB \nAssistance \n\nFor NHDP II \n\nPrimary Network: \nNational Highways \n\nEarmarked cess on petrol \nand diesel \n\nTolls \n\n \n\nMultilateral funding  \n\nMarket borrowing \n\nEast\u2013West Corridor: \n$320 million (2002) \n\nNational Highway Corridor \n(Sector): $400 million (2003) \n\nNational Highway Sector II: \n$400 million (2004) \n\nNational Highway Corridor \n(Sector) \u2013 supplementary: \n$100 million (2009) \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\nSecondary Network: State \nHighways and Major District \nRoads \n\nEarmarked cess on petrol and \ndiesel and other budgetary \nsupport  \n\nState budgetary allocation \n\nTolls \n\nMultilateral funding \n\nMarket borrowing \n\nWest Bengal: $79.2 million \n(2001) \n\nMadhya Pradesh: $150 million \n(2002) \n\nChhattisgarh: $180 million \n(2003) \n\nUttaranchal: $550 million MFF \n(2006) \n\nMadhya Pradesh II: $320 million \n(2007) \n\nBihar: $420 million (2008) \n\nTertiary Network: \nRural Roads \n\nEarmarked cess on petrol \nand diesel \n\nMultilateral funding for \n10 core states \n\nMarket borrowing by states \n(proposed) \n\nRural Roads Sector I: \n$400 million (2003, \nChhattisgarh and Madhya \nPradesh) \n\nRural Roads Sector II \nInvestment Program: \n$750 million MFF (2005; \nAssam, Orissa, and West \nBengal) \n\nThe State Road Subsector\u2014Issues \n\nSources: Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008.

Upkeep  of  the \nstate  roads  and  districts  roads  are  normally  entrusted  to  state  government  public  works \ndepartments  (or  their  equivalent).  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  has  been  to  provide  financial \nsupport to the state governments from the earmarked tax on gasoline and diesel oil, or through \nbudgetary allocation. The 12th Finance Commission recommended additional grants of Rs150 \nbillion  for  maintenance  of  roads  and  bridges  from  FY2006  through  FY2009.  Despite  the \nsubstantial central assistance, funds have been inadequate and generally poorly managed. Half \nof the secondary network has a poor-quality road surface.  \n \nFollowing the launch of the NHDP and PMGSY, with strong central backing for funding \n6. \nand project management, the secondary network is now seen as the weakest link of the overall \nroad network in India. In addition to funding shortages, the 11th FYP lists the following as key \nconstraints in the state road subsector: \n \n\n(i) \n\nInadequate resources. More projects are sanctioned than can be undertaken using \navailable resources, leading to available funds being spread too thinly, and resulting \nin time and cost overruns. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nC. \n  \n\n(ii) \n\nPreconstruction  activity  delays.  Work  has  at  times  been  awarded  without \nacquisition  of  all  the  land  required  for  the  project,  affecting  acquisition  of  the \nenvironmental clearance and the shifting/removal of utilities. \n\n \n(iii)    Weak  management  by  contractors.  Several  measures  have  been  taken  by  the \ncontracting industry to acquire state-of-the-art equipment and procure good technical \nand  managerial  staff,  but  considerable  scope  exists \nimproving  project \nmanagement, and scheduling of human resources and equipment. \n\nfor \n\n(iv)     Poor implementation capacity. The state public works departments are required to \nbe capable of meeting current needs, in terms of modern technology and commercial \nmanagement principles. In many states there is a need to improve their capacity for \nplanning,  designing,  and  executing  works  to  meet  the  transport  demands  of  users. \nConsiderable  scope  also  exists  for  enhancing  the  training  arrangements  for \nengineering personnel. Improvement is also required in the contracting industry and \nconsultancy sector. \n\nJharkhand Road Sector\u2014Overview \n\nBackground \n\n1. \n \n\n7. \nThe  state  of  Jharkhand,  which  was  created  in  November  2000  by  dividing  the  state  of \nBihar, has an area of around 79,700 square km (km2). It is surrounded by Bihar (to the north), \nWest  Bengal  (to  the  east),  Orissa  (to  the  south),  Chhattisgarh  (to  the  southwest),  and  Uttar \nPradesh  (to  the  west).  The  2001  census  recorded  a  population  of  26.9  million,  26%  of  which \nwas tribal. \n \n8. \nThe main transport corridor connecting New Delhi (the capital) and Kolkata runs through \nthe state. Industry is concentrated in the central and eastern parts of the state, which are fairly \nwell-served  by  both  the  railway  network  and  national  highways.  The  state's  two  airports  (at \nRanchi  and  Jamshedpur)  also  primarily  serve  these  areas.  Roads  are  the  primary  form  of \ntransport in rural areas, where 78% of the state's population lives.  \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Road Network and Administration \n\n \n9. \nThe road network in Jharkhand in 2008 is described in Table A2.2. Jharkhand has 58 km \nof  road  per  100,000  population  (compared  to  the  average  for  India  of  257  km  per  100,000 \npopulation), and a road density of 18 km per 100 km2, (compared to the average for India of 75 \nkm per 100 km2). The state\u2019s road penetration is inadequate, with some 74% of habitations not \nconnected with all-weather roads. \n\n \n10. \nThere  are  three  organizations  involved  in  the  management  of  road  infrastructure  in \nJharkhand. NHAI  is  entrusted  to  maintain  and improve,  under  NHDP,  key  sections  of  national \nhighways including 190 km of National Highway 2 (NH2), which forms part of the Delhi\u2013Kolkata \nlink  of  the  \u201cgolden  quadrilateral\u201d.  Other  national  highways,  state  highways,  and  district  roads \ntotaling  about  6,900  km  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Road  Construction  Department  (RCD)  of \nthe state government of Jharkhand (GOJH). Other district roads and village roads are under the \nRural Works Department, which executes the rural roads improvement scheme under PMGSY. \n \n11. \nRCD is the primary state department involved in development of road infrastructure, and \nis responsible for construction and maintenance of roads on behalf of GOJH. Its organizational \n\n \n\n\f24 \n \n\nAppendix  2 \n\nstructure  is  typical  for  public  works  departments  in  Indian  states.  It  is  headed  by  a  politically \nappointed  minister.  A  secretary,  who  reports  to  the  minister,  is  responsible  for  assisting  with \nframing  and  implementing  state  policy,  monitoring  the  progress  of  road  works  and  overall \ndepartmental performance. The engineer-in-chief reports to the secretary and is in charge of the \nimplementation of works program. The engineer-in-chief is supported by three chief engineers\u2014\none  each  for  communication,  central  design  organization,  and  national  highways\u2014who  are  all \nbased in Ranchi. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Roads in Jharkhand \n\nNo. \n1. \n\nClass of Road \nNational Highways \n\n2. \n\nState Highways \n\nDistrict \n\n3.

Executive  engineers  are  the \nbasic  operations  units  and  are  responsible  for  management  of  works  including  contracts  and \npayment  for  works.  In  every  division,  subdivisions  are  headed  by  assistant  engineers  who \nmanage  and  supervise  works  within  their  subdivision.  This  involves  design  and  contract \nmanagement including quality control and testing. Assistant engineers are required to check the \nquality and quantity of works. Under every subdivision are sections headed by junior engineers \nwho are the basic field functionaries and responsible for managing actual construction activity in \nthe  field,  taking  measurements,  giving  day-to-day  guidance,  and  reporting  to  the  assistant \nengineer. The overall staff strength of RCD includes, in addition to the engineer-in-chief and the \nthree  chief  engineers,  16  superintending  engineers,  43  executive  engineers,  255  assistant \nengineers and approximately 800 junior engineers. These are sanctioned positions and actual \nstaffing levels are lower.  \n \nThe  chief  engineer  (communication)  is  responsible  for  all  state  highways  and  major \n13. \ndistrict roads, under five circles and 23 divisions across the state. In addition, a superintending \nengineer  (mechanical)  based  in  Ranchi  is  responsible  for  rollers,  hot-mix  plants,  and  other \ndepartmental  equipment,  which  was  reserved  for  use  on  departmental  works.  However,  the \ndepartment  currently  does  not  carry  out  its  own  works,  and  contractors  are  supposed  to \nmobilize  their  own  equipment,  meaning  this  wing  is  now  defunct.  The  chief  engineer  (national \nhighways)  is  supported  by  two  superintending  engineers,  one  each  at  Ranchi  and  Dhanbad. \nThese superintending engineers in turn supervise seven divisions across the state. \n \n14. \nThe  central  design  organization  prepares,  checks,  and  clears  the  design  of  roads  and \nbridges  under  the  state's  responsibility  and  has  been  outsourcing  the  detailed  project  report \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\npreparation to  consultants  since  2002.

Much of the underspending comes under the plan budget.7 Compared to the historically low \nspending ratio under plan budget, the maintenance budget is better utilized (about 85% of the \nbudget allocation for FY2007 was used).

However,  Jharkhand's  state  road  sector  has  several  unique \nfeatures  that  would  necessitate  adjustments  to  the  approach  adopted  by  ADB  in  designing \ninterventions in other states. \n \n\n1. \n\nUnderdeveloped Road Network \n\n  \n17. \nExcept for West Bengal, the states receiving ADB financial assistance for the state road \nsector are those which were divided in 2000: Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were created \nfrom the former Madhya Pradesh; Uttarakhand (formerly Uttaranchal) occupies the hilly portion \nof the former Uttar Pradesh; and the present-day Bihar occupies the plain areas of the former \nundivided  Bihar  (Jharkhand  was  created  by  dividing  Bihar).  Of  these  five  bifurcated  states, \n\n                                                 \n6  Recurrent expenditure includes expenditure for road maintenance and wages and salaries. \n7  A preliminary figure from FY2008 shows a significant improvement, with 94% of the allocated plan budget utilized. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n \n\nAppendix  2 \n\nUttarakhand is a hill state, and its road network differs from those of the four flatter plain states. \nComparison  of  the  four  plain  states  reveals  stark  differences  between  the  road  network  in \nJharkhand and the other three states.  \n \nJharkhand\u2019s road network is much smaller and less dense than those of the other three \n18. \nplain states. In 2002, the overall road length was less than one-third that of Chhattisgarh, which \nhad a smaller population, and an area not more than double that of Jharkhand. The total length \nof  surfaced  roads  was  approximately  one-tenth  that  of  Chhattisgarh.  In  terms  of  the  size  and \nquality  of  the  road  network,  Jharkhand  was  severely  underdeveloped.  Since  it  was  formed  in \n2000,  Jharkhand  has  not  implemented  any  major  road  investments  that  alter  the  nature  of  its \nroad  network.  Considering  the  relative  progress  made  in  the  other  three  states,  Jharkhand's \npresent standing among these states may have slipped even further since 2002. 8    \n \n\nTable A2.4: Comparison of Road Network in ADB-Financed States  \n\nMadhya Pradesh  Chhattisgarh \n\nItem \nPopulation (2001 census) \nLand Area (km2) \nRoad Length (km, in 2002) \nOf which sealed (km, in 2002) \nSealed Road Density (km/km2) \nSource: Road Lengths from Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways. \n\n60,348,023 \n308,252 \n160,968 \n78,191 \n0.254 \n\n20,833,803 \n135,237 \n35,372 \n24,476 \n0.181 \n\n82,998,509 \n94,164 \n76,065 \n32,858 \n0.348 \n\n26,945,829 \n79,714 \n11,486 \n2,840 \n0.036 \n\nBihar \n\nJharkhand \n\n \n19. \nA 2002 RCD study (Road Infrastructure in Jharkhand\u2014Vision 2010) identified five major \ncorridors  for  focused  investment,  including  the  Govindpur\u2013Sahebganj  road,  which  is  proposed \nfor improvement under the Project.  To expand the state's road network, four stretches of road \ntotaling  554  km  were  newly  declared  as  national  highways,  increasing  the  national  highway \nlength  in  Jharkhand  to  1,844  km.  These  attempts  have  not  yet  resulted  in  any  visible \nimprovement to the state's road network, however. RCD expects that the proposed Project will \nbecome a breakthrough for sustained improvement of its road network.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSmaller Organization \n\n  \n20. \n Jharkhand\u2019s RCD has a much smaller staff than the Bihar RCD, with just 43 sanctioned \nexecutive engineer positions, compared to 378 in Bihar. The Jharkhand RCD is responsible for \n6,900 km of road, and the Bihar RCD for 14,000 km, meaning the staff strength of Jharkhand \nRCD is not proportional to its responsibility.  \n  \nStaff  costs  in  Jharkhand  RCD  accounted  for  20.5%  of  the  RCD  budget  allocation  in \n21. \nFY2007  (a  decrease  from  24.7%  in  FY2003).  During  this  period  staff  costs  increased  by  1.4 \ntimes,  while  works  executed  by  Jharkhand  RCD  doubled.  RCD  suffers  less  from  the  financial \nburden  posed  by  the  staff  costs,  which  often  divert  non-plan  resources  away  from  road \nmaintenance in other public works departments.  \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Construction Department Receptive to New Ideas \n\n  \nRCD has been outsourcing construction works, in part because of its small staff size. It \n22. \nalso outsources detailed project report preparation and supervision of larger construction works. \nRCD  has  also  initiated  several  reforms,  based  on  lessons  from  other  states  in  India.  The \nJharkhand  Highway  Act  was  enacted  in  2006  and  provides  a  legal  framework  for  overall \n\n                                                 \n8   For consistency and ease of comparison, the data on road lengths was obtained from the website of the Ministry of \n\nRoad Transport and Highways (http://morth.nic.in/index2.asp?sublinkid=376&langid=2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nhighway corridor management by GOJH, and future establishment of a highway authority. Rules \nunder the act came into force in 2007. RCD has drafted its own public works department code \nto replace the public works department code of Bihar that is currently in use. RCD also entered \ninto  a  project  development  agreement  with  Infrastructure  Leasing  &  Financial  Services  to \nidentify  highway  schemes  and  projects  that  could  be  undertaken  under  public\u2013private \npartnership options. A special purpose vehicle has been formed for this purpose. \n \n23. \nRCD established a dedicated project implementation cell well in advance of the start of \nloan processing, and has increased its staff size. The required organizational setup for project \nimplementation  is  in  place,  including  the  high-level  project  coordination  committee  (chaired  by \nthe  chief  secretary)  and  district-level  task  forces  comprising  district-level  officers  from  all  the \nconcerned  state  departments.  These  are  functional  and  helping  RCD  meet  the  readiness \nrequirements listed in the checklist developed by the Government\u2019s Ministry of Finance. \n\n \n\nJharkhand Road Sector\u2014ADB Approach \n\nE. \n \nADB's  past  assistance  in  India's  state  road  subsector  was  designed  to  improve  the \n24. \nphysical  condition  of  road  infrastructure  while  introducing  various  reforms  to  state-level  road \nadministration.  The  results  are  mixed,  as  ADB\u2019s  2007  sector  assistance  program  evaluation \n(SAPE)  points  out.9  One  of  the  SAPE's  key  recommendations  was  to  take  into  account  local \nvariations in implementation capabilities and make better use of past experience to improve the \ndesign of future projects. In this regard, review of the two loans provided in 2002\u20132003 to the \nnewly bifurcated states is useful. \n \nThe  recently  completed  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Roads  Sector  Development  Program \n25. \nwas  generally  seen  as  a  successful  intervention.10  Under  the  program  loan,  Madhya  Pradesh \nRoad  Development  Corporation  was  created  out  of  the  Public  Works  Department  with  a  lean \norganizational  structure  and  many  features  of  a  modern  organization  for  road  infrastructure \nmanagement.  Under  the  Chhattisgarh  State  Roads  Development  Sector  Project,  similar \ninstitutional  changes  were  attempted  but  the  envisaged  creation  of  a  dedicated  road  authority \nhas  not  taken  place.11  The  policy  action  plan  for  institutional  reform  is  being  restructured  to \naddress the changed scenario under which a special purpose vehicle was created in 2007 that \ncan function as a dedicated road authority.  \n \n26. \nIn  the  case  of  Jharkhand,  policy  decisions  and  enabling  legislation  for  efficient \ndevelopment and management of road infrastructure and greater private sector participation are \nalready  in  place.  However,  other  factors\u2014notably  the  frequent  changes  in  the  state's \ngovernment12\u2014have  not  encouraged  or  been  conducive  to  the  commencement  of  major  road \nsector projects with private sector participation. NHAI invited tenders for the Ranchi\u2013Barhi road \n(one of the state\u2019s highest traffic corridors) three times on a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer basis with no \nresponse from the private sector. How the recently formed special purpose vehicle will interest \nthe private sector remains to be seen.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2007.

By  strictly  adhering  to  these  requirements,  all  the  necessary  institutional  changes \nare  expected  to  be  in  place  before  the  start  of  the  Project.  This  will  allow  RCD  to  focus  its \nscarce human resources on discharging its responsibility as the \u201cemployer\u201d of the FIDIC-based \ncivil works contracts, to effectively deliver the Project outputs and outcome.  \n\n                                                 \n13 Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  State  Roads  Projects  in  Chhattisgarh  and  Jharkhand,  processed  in \n2007  as  a  component  technical  assistance  under  ADB.  2006.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBetween 2002 and 2006, India\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of 8.6% (based on 1999 constant \nprices).  Transportation  and  communication  (including  trade),  agriculture,  and  manufacturing  were  particularly  strong, \nwith  transportation,  communication,  and  trade  combined  accounting  for  the  highest  share  of  the  country\u2019s  GDP \n(25.6%).  This  performance  is  largely  responsible  for  the  country\u2019s  impressive  economic  growth,  and  for  reducing \npoverty. Gains from economic growth  have  yet to  be  distributed  equitably in some poor areas, however, including  in \nthe state of Jharkhand. In December 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the 2009 country operations \nbusiness  plan,a  under  which  support  for  infrastructure  development  to  promote  inclusive  growth  will  remain  the  core \nfocus  of  ADB\u2019s  India  assistance  strategy.  The  Jharkhand  State  Roads  Project,  which  aims  to  improve  transport \nconnectivity within the state, will be the first support by ADB for Jharkhand\u2019s roads. The Project will augment transport \ncapacity in a financially sustainable manner. Jharkhand is one of the least-developed states in India, and the Project is \nexpected to have significant development impacts. Its short-term impacts on poverty reduction include employment of \npoor people in road construction and ensuing maintenance works. These opportunities will directly increase earnings, \nespecially  for  those  who  are  largely  dependent  on  occasional  and  uncertain  employment.  Over  the  long  term,  the \nProject  is  expected  to  have  a  significant  development  impact\u2014e.g.,  through  expanded  economic  activities  due  to \nimprovement  of  access  to  markets  and  other  economic  centers,  and  improved  health  and  education  caused  by \nimproved access to health and educational facilities\u2014and thereby contribute to poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues \n  \nThe  state  of  Jharkhand  (India\u2019s  28th  state)  was  created  in  November  2000  from  the  southern  portion  of  the  former \nundivided state of Bihar. It is bounded by five states: the (now smaller) state of Bihar to the north, West Bengal to the \neast, Orissa to the south and Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh to the west. Jharkhand covers an area of 79,714 square \nkilometers, with 22 districts, 32,616 revenue villages and a population of 27 million (according to the 2001 census). A \nsocioeconomic survey covering 20% of the affected population (1,243 household were interviewed) was conducted in \nAugust  2007,  as  well  as  community  consultations  and  a  focus  group  discussion.  In  addition,  poverty  analysis  using \nprimary and secondary data, and a review of government programs and schemes were conducted. The data revealed \nthat Jharkhand has one of the highest levels of poverty in India, with a sharp contrast between rural and urban poverty. \nThe  poverty  incidence  in  Jharkhand  is  44%,  compared  with  26%  for  India  as  a  whole.  Although  Jharkhand  has \nextensive  natural  resources  (mainly  minerals  and  forests),  the  majority  of  its  population  (80%)  resides  in  rural  areas \nand remains largely dependant on agriculture and allied activities for their livelihoods. Agricultural activities are usually \nundertaken  during  the  monsoon  period,  as  this  provides  the  only  source  of  irrigation  for  most  agricultural  land.  By \nrehabilitating  the  Govindpur\u2013Sahebganj  road,  the  Project  will  connect  regional  communities  to  the  district  and \ncommercial  centers.  Some  of  the  immediate  benefits  will  be  improved  access  to  socioeconomic  facilities,  safe  and \ncomfortable  journeys  with  reduced  fuel  consumption  and  vehicle  operating  costs,  and  development  of  the  rural \neconomy. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.   Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  August  2007  socioeconomic  survey  revealed  that  only  1.45%  of  interviewed  households  reported  agriculture  as \ntheir  main  source  of  livelihood.  Most  (80%)  reported  having  more  than  one  livelihood,  for  example  combining \nagriculture  with  nonagricultural  labor  and  business  or  trade.  The  average  landholding  is  small  (1\u20132  acres  or  0.4\u20130.8 \nhectares),  necessitating  multiple  livelihoods  to  supplement  the  basic  income  and  harvests  generated  through \nsubsistence  agriculture.  The  households  interviewed  felt  that  road  improvements  would  lead  to  more  frequent  and \nmore reliable bus services, thereby considerably reducing travel costs and times. Households engaged in wage labor \nviewed  improved  mobility  as  providing  the  opportunity  to  obtain  better-paying  jobs  outside  their  villages.  Labor \nopportunities  in  the  Project\u2019s  road  construction  work  were  seen  as  additional  immediate  project  benefits  for  wage \nlaborers.     \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n39 \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations  and  meetings  with  the  project  communities  were  organized  during  the  course  of  the  social  analysis  to \nascertain  their  response  to  the  construction  of  roads,  their  needs  and  demands  from  the  Project,  and  any  risks  or \nconcerns  emerging  from  the  Project.  A  total  of  14  focus  group  discussions  were  organized  during  the  course  of  the \nsocial assessment with local communities, and included men, women, farmers, indigenous people, Scheduled Castes, \nhigh-income  groups,  the  poor,  shopkeepers,  truckers,  etc.,  to  ensure  a  comprehensive  perspective  was  obtained  on \nthe Project and its impacts. Other key stakeholders, such as Panchayati Raj (local government) members (e.g., village \nhead, village health workers, block development officers, health workers, and school teachers) were also consulted by \nmeans  of  key  stakeholder  discussions.  In  addition,  consultations  were  also  undertaken  with  the  affected  households \nand  communities  during  the  course  of  the  resettlement  census  surveys  undertaken  for  each  of  the  Project\u2019s  four \n\u201cpackages\u201d. Details of these consultations are provided in the respective resettlement plans.  \n \n2.    What  level  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  envisaged  during  the  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?                     \n \nInformation  dissemination  material  such  as  brochures,  pamphlets  and  posters  detailing  resettlement  information \nincluding measurement of losses, detailed asset valuations, entitlements and special provisions, grievance procedures, \ntiming of payments and displacement schedules will be printed for distribution to affected people. This will be carried \nout during implementation of resettlement plans by local nongovernment organizations. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \nKey Issues. During the social study a gender analysis was undertaken to assess the Project\u2019s impact. Six focus group \ndiscussions were held with women belonging to different socioeconomic groups, such as scheduled tribes and castes. \nThe discussions revealed that the women in the project area are engaged primarily in household chores and farming. \nThe primary school enrollment ratio of males and females is about equal, but female enrollment decreases at higher \neducation levels, with a sharp drop in female enrolment after middle school. One reason quoted for the drop in female \nenrolment  was  the  lack  of  higher  schools  in  and  around  villages,  and  the  lack  of  access  to  higher  education. \nConsequently, many households declined to send their girls to schools outside the village, because of concerns about \nsecurity  and  the  lack  of  mobility.  It  is  also  nearly  impossible  for  many  women  to  access  health  facilities  at  night  and \nduring the rainy season, jeopardizing the lives of both mother and child in emergencies during childbirth. Women said \nthat the Project would considerably improve their access to better health care services outside their villages. They also \nvoiced  some  concerns  with  regard  to  the  safety  of  their  children,  as  they  were  of  the  opinion  that  the  widening  and \nrehabilitating the road would increase the number of the vehicles, thereby increasing hazards for children, the elderly, \nand women.   \n \n2.  Key  Actions.  Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \n \n\nThe Project will provide women with job opportunities and will offer men and women equal wages, particularly for work \nof equal value.  \n \n\nIII.  SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nLimited/ \nNo Impact \n \nSignificant \n\n \nA  census  of  all  affected  persons  was  undertaken  based \non  a  detailed  design  that  identifies  all  project-related \nimpacts. The survey found that the Project will impact the \nassets (e.g., agricultural land, residential and commercial \nassets,  and  trees)  of  4,516  households  Resettlement \nplans  have  been  prepared  to  mitigate  and  address  all \nlosses. \n\n \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures Included \nin Design \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n\n  \n\n  Resettlement \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n \n\n\f   Plan \n   Other Action \n \nPeoples \nFramework \n\n  \n\n \n\n   No Action \n\nIndigenous \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nDetailed  social  assessments  were  undertaken  as  part  of \nproject preparation in order to assess any adverse impact \non  the  tribal  groups  within  the  area  of  influence  of  the \nproject  road.  The  results  indicated  the  scheduled  tribe/ \nindigenous households have similar characteristics to the \noverall  population  and  are  largely  assimilated  into  the \nlocal communities. This can be attributed to the fact that \nthe  road  to  be  improved  under  the  Project  has  been  in \nexistence  for  many  years,  exposing  both  the  scheduled \ntribes and non-scheduled-tribe households to the outside \nworld.  Consequently,  the  Project  will  not  have  any \nadverse  or  differential  impacts  on  customary,  tribal, \nsocial,  cultural,  economic  or  political  behaviors  or \ninstitutions,  and  indigenous  peoples  will  benefit  equally \nfrom  the  socioeconomic  opportunities  created  by  the \nProject.  \n\nfor \n\nlocal \n\ncommunities  during \n\n \nThe  adverse  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  scheduled \ntribes  will  be  due  to  land  acquisition.  In  most  cases  the \nimpact would be on unirrigated agriculture land (generally \n1%\u20135%  of  total  household  landholdings);  in  some  cases \nthe  impact  will  be  on  structures.  Adequate  provisions \nhave been incorporated into the entitlement matrix of the \nresettlement plans to mitigate and compensate for these \nimpacts.   \n \nProject construction is expected to generate employment \nopportunities \nthe \nconstruction  phase.  The  Road  Construction  Department \n(RCD),  supported  by \nthe  construction  supervision \nconsultant,  will ensure that all civil  works comply  with all \napplicable labor laws, including equal pay for equal work \nand the effective abolition of child labor.  \n \nRoad  rehabilitation  will  reduce \ntransport  costs  and \nincrease the mobility of the local population in the project \nareas.  \nThe  social  assessments  undertaken  have  not  identified \nany  significant  risks  related  to  social  issues  such  as \ngender, HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. However, RCD \nwill  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contractors  disseminate \ninformation  at  worksites  on \nthe  risks  of  sexually \ntransmitted  diseases  and  HIV/AIDS  for  those  employed \nduring  construction.  Contracts  for  all  subprojects  will \ninclude  specific  clauses  on  these  undertakings,  and \nRCD,  supported  by \nthe  construction  supervision \nconsultant,  will strictly monitor compliance during project \nimplementation. \n\nIV.

The  state  of  Jharkhand,  formerly  part  of  southern \nBihar,  became  India\u2019s  28th  state  in  November  2000.  The  Project,  which  will  be  the  first  ADB \nintervention in Jharkhand\u2019s road sector, aims to improve transport connectivity within the state \nto  facilitate  balanced  development  and  reduce  regional  socioeconomic  disparities.  Under  the \nProject,  the  existing  road  will  be  widened  and  converted  into  a  two-lane  state  highway.1  The \nProject  has  been  subdivided  into  four  packages,  with  the  detailed  design  of  all  alignments \ncompleted for all packages. Resettlement plans for each of these packages have been prepared \nbased on these detailed designs. The details of the four road sections are listed in Table A10.1.  \n\nTable A10.1: Project Road Packages \n\nPackage No. \nI \n\nName  \nGovindpur\u2013Jamtara \nJamtara Bypass \nJamtara\u2013Dumka \nDumka Bypass \nDumka\u2013Barhet \n\nII \n\nIII \n\nDistricts Covered \n\nDhanbad, Jamtara \n\nJamtara, \nDeoghar \nSahebganj, \nPakur \nSahebganj \n\nDumka, \n\nDumka, \n\nLength \n(km) \n69.7 \n11.0 \n75.5  \n6.5 \n98.1 \n\n49.9  \n\nBarhet\u2013Sahebganj \n\nIV \nkm = kilometer  \nSource: Road Construction Department, State Government of Jharkhand \n\n \nB. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\nTo assess the Project\u2019s resettlement impacts, a census survey based on detailed road \n2. \ndesigns was undertaken from January to August 2008. The census revealed that despite having \nmade  considerable  efforts  to  minimize  resettlement  impacts,  a  total  of  150  hectares  of  private \nland will need to be acquired.2 The resettlement census found that 4,515 households will incur \nimpacts  on  the  following  assets:  4,143  agricultural  plots,  1,489  residential  structures,  and  680 \ncommercial or commercial-cum-residential structures. In 93% of all cases involving land, these \nimpacts  will  affect  less  than  10%  of  the  area  of  the  plot.  Over  half  (56%)  of  the  impacts  to \nstructures  will  affect  only  boundary  walls,  gates  and  gardens,  with  little  or  no  impacts  on  the \nmain structures. These project impacts are presented in Table A10.2. \n\n                                                 \n1   Jharkhand state highway technical specifications call for an average width of 30\u201340 meters. In the case of Jamtara \n\nand Dumka bypasses, technical specifications call for a total widening of up to 60 meters in some places.  \n\n2   To  minimize  resettlement  impacts  (i)  community  bypasses  will  be  constructed  in  several  village  areas,  (ii)  the \nproject  has  been  designed  to  largely  follow  the  existing  road  alignment  outside  of  developed  areas,  (iii) \u201ctoe\u201d \nretaining  walls  will  be  introduced  in  some  areas  of  high  fill  construction,  and  (iv)  traffic  will  be  managed  during \nconstruction.  \n\n\f42 \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nTable A10.2: Summary of Project Impacts \n\nNo. of \nAffected \nHouse-\nholds \n\nPackage \nNo. \n\nType of Losses by Category and Number of Affected Assets \n\nNo. of \nAffected \nPersons \n\nAgricul- \ntural \nPlots  \n\nResiden- \ntial \nStructures \n\nCommer- \ncial \nStructures \n\nResidential / \nCommercial \nStructures  Othera \n\nTotal \nLandb \n(acres) \n\nI \n\nII \n\nIII \n\nIV \n\n835 \n\n7,345 \n\n578 \n\n1,235 \n\n1,588 \n\n8,272 \n\n1,328 \n\n10,025 \n\n1,695 \n\n857 \n\n5,620 \n\n542 \n\n315 \n\n426 \n\n420 \n\n328 \n\n87 \n\n38 \n\n109 \n\n43 \n\n277 \n\n89 \n\n91 \n\n96 \n\n127 \n\n403 \n\n0 \n\n5 \n\n30 \n\n7 \n\n42 \n\n86.25 \n\n99.78 \n\n120.12 \n\n55.57 \n\n370.67 \n\nTotal \n\n4,515 \n\n31,262 \n\n4,143 \n\n1,489 \n\na Other losses include assets such as temples, cattle sheds, and garages.  \nb Total land affected includes agricultural, residential, commercial and residential-cum-commercial land. \n\n  \n\nSource: Census Survey, Jharkhand State Roads Project, 2008. \n \nC. \n\nResettlement Policy and Legal Framework \n\n3. \nIn accordance with the Jharkhand resettlement and rehabilitation norms for the Project, \nand  incorporating  the  ADB  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Operations  Manual \nsection on involuntary resettlement,3 all affected households will be entitled to a combination of \ncompensation  measures  and  resettlement  assistance,  depending  on  the  nature  of  their \nownership rights over the affected assets and the scope of the impact, including the social and \neconomic  vulnerability  of  the  affected  persons.  In  general  terms,  the  affected  persons  in  the \nproject will be entitled to six types of compensation and assistance:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\ncompensation for loss of land, trees, etc. at replacement value;  \ncompensation  for  structures  (residential/commercial)  and  other  immovable \nassets at replacement value;  \nassistance for loss of business/wage income;  \nassistance for shifting;  \nrebuilding and/or restoration of community resources/facilities; and \nspecial additional assistance for vulnerable households.  \n\nBased on the inventory of losses conducted during the resettlement census carried out \n4. \nin  consultation  with  affected  households,  an  entitlement  matrix  (Table  A10.3)  has  been \ndeveloped. The matrix provides the basic tools and guidelines for preparation of compensation \nand resettlement benefits. Compensation rates and assistances have been fixed in consultation \nwith state and local officials and other stakeholders.   \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2006.

Any \nunanticipated \nadverse impact due \nto project \nintervention \nBPL = below poverty line; EA = executing agency.  \na   Traditional  land  rights  refer  to  households  with  customary  rights  to  land  and  shall  be  treated  in  a  manner  equivalent  to \n\ntitleholders.  \n\nb   As per the Jharkhand Resettlement and Rehabilitation Norms for ADB Project \u2013 2009, once the registration cost of similar type of \nland  at  the  time  of  notification  is  derived,  50%  of  the  registration  cost  (of  similar  type  of  land)  will  be  added  to  this  cost.  In \naddition, the land shall be acquired after paying 30% solatium on the rates as fixed above but whenever the land owner agrees \nto give the land voluntarily in that case 60%solatium shall be paid.  \n\nc   Population groups considered socially \u201cvulnerable\u201d comprise (i) those below the poverty line; (ii) those who belong to scheduled \n\ncastes and scheduled tribes; (iii) female-headed households; (iv) elderly; and (v) disabled persons. \n\nd   The minimum wage rate in Jharkhand as per the March 2008 notification is Rs91 per day. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n46 \n \n\nD. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure of Information \n\n5. \nLocal stakeholders were consulted during the social and poverty assessment. Similarly, \ncommunity  consultations  were  conducted  during  preparation  of  the  resettlement  plans. \nSummaries of the resettlement plans will be translated into Hindi and Santhali and will be made \navailable for review and comments by means of four package-level disclosure workshops prior \nto loan negotiations. Copies of the summary resettlement plans will also be made available at \nlocal-level public offices (such as revenue offices and gram panchayat). The final resettlement \nplan  endorsed  by  the  executing  agency  (EA)  will  also  be  disclosed  on  the  RCD  and  ADB \nwebsites. Furthermore, experienced and well-qualified nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) \nor agencies will be engaged to assist the EA in the effective, timely and efficient implementation \nof  the  resettlement  plans  for  each  road  package.  The  NGOs  and/or  agencies  will  act  as \nfacilitators and serve to link the project implementation cell (PIC) within RCD and the affected \ncommunities.  The  NGOs  and/or  agencies  will  inform  the  affected  persons  regarding  project-\nrelated \nland  acquisition  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  measures  and  ensure  proper \ncompensation and assistance are extended to the affected persons under the resettlement and \nrehabilitation entitlement package.  \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Grievance Redress \n\nThe  Jharkhand  RCD  is  the  EA  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall  strategic  guidance, \n6. \ntechnical supervision, project execution, and ensuring compliance with loan covenants. The PIC \nwill be established in Ranchi (the state capital), headed by a full-time director who reports to the \nRCD  secretary.  The  PIC  will  ensure  internal  monitoring  and  report  any  changes  in  the  project \ndesign.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  if  design  changes  are  made  that  have \nresettlement impacts. The PIC will also ensure that resettlement budgets are delivered on time \nfor  resettlement  plan  implementation.  A  field-based  district  implementation  cell,  headed  by  an \nexecutive  engineer  and  assisted  by  a  dedicated  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  officer  will  be \nthe  resettlement  plan.  The  district \nresponsible \nimplementation  cell  will  be  assisted  by \nrehabilitation \nimplementation agencies.  \n\nlocal  NGOs/resettlement  and \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe  day-to-day \n\nfor \n\n7. \nA  grievance  redress  cell  comprising  the  executive  engineer,  local  NGO  representative, \ncommunity leaders (nonpolitical), and representatives of affected persons (including women and \nvulnerable  groups)  will  be  established  at  the  district  level  to  address  and  resolve  community \ngrievances.  To  facilitate  interdepartmental  coordination  and  ensure  speedy  resolution  of \ngrievances,  a  task  force  chaired  by  the  district  collector  and  comprising  the  district  land \nacquisition  officer,  district  forest  officer,  executive  engineer,  and  additional  district  magistrate \nand relief officer has been constituted at each district.  \n\nF. \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\n8. \nThe  cost  of  resettlement  plan  implementation  (including  all  costs  related  to  land \nacquisition,  compensation,  resettlement  assistance,  transport,  monitoring  and  evaluation)  is \n$17.09  million.  The  EA  will  make  the  required  funds  available  to  cover  all  compensation  and \nresettlement and rehabilitation costs.  \n\nG. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nThe  proposed  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  activities  are  divided  into  three  broad \n9. \ncategories\u2014the  project  preparation  phase,  resettlement  plan  implementation  phase,  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation\u2014based  on  the  stages  of  work  and  implementation  process.  The \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\nmajor  activities  to  be  performed  during  the  preparation  phase  include  establishment  of  PIC  at \nproject  and  subproject  levels,  submission  of  a  resettlement  plan  for  ADB\u2019s  approval, \nappointment  of  NGOs,  and  establishment  of  the  grievance  redress  cell.  An  orientation  and \ntraining in resettlement management will be provided under the Project by the ADB consultant \nto the NGOs/resettlement and rehabilitation implementing agencies. The information campaign \nand  community  consultation  will  be  initiated  at  this  stage  and  continue  until  the  end  of  the \nProject. Implementation of the resettlement plan will follow the preparatory phase and includes \n(i) issuing  of  compensation  and  awards  by  the  EA,  (ii)  payment  of  eligible  assistance, \n(iii) relocation  of  affected  persons,  and  (iv)  initiation  of  economic  rehabilitation  measures. \nSubsequent  activities  include  site  preparation  for  delivering  the  site  to  contractors  for \nconstruction, and commencement of civil works. \n\nH. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n10. \nThe resettlement plan will have both internal and external monitoring. Internal monitoring \nwill be a regular activity for the PIC, which will oversee the timely implementation of resettlement \nand  rehabilitation  activities.  Internal  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PIC  and  its  agents, \nsuch  as  the  NGOs/resettlement  and  rehabilitation  implementing  agencies  and  will  prepare \nmonthly reports on the progress of resettlement plan implementation. External (or independent) \nmonitors  will  be  hired  by  ADB  to  provide  an  independent  periodic  assessment  of  resettlement \nimplementation and impacts to verify internal monitoring, and to suggest adjustment of delivery \nmechanisms and procedures as required. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 3 November 2009) \n \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n", "Re1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.02118 \nRs47.205 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nCSC \nDFID \nEA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFYP \nGOJH \nIEE \nLIBOR \nNGO \nNHAI \nNHDP \nNH2 \nPIC \nPPTA \nRCD \nSAPE \nTA \n", "state government of Jharkhand \ninitial environmental examination \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  construction supervision consultant \n\u2013  Department for International Development of the United Kingdom \n\u2013  executing agency \n\u2013  economic internal rate of return \n\u2013  environmental management plan \n\u2013  Five Year Plan \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013  London interbank offered rate \n\u2013  nongovernment organization \n\u2013  National Highways Authority of India \n\u2013  National Highway Development Program \n\u2013  National Highway 2 \n\u2013  project implementation cell \n\u2013  project preparatory technical assistance \n\u2013  Road Construction Department  \n\u2013  sector assistance program evaluation \n\u2013 \n \n", "technical assistance \n \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  of  India  begins  on  1  April.
