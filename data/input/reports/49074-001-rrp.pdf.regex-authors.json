I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $30,000,000 to BRAC Bank for Sustainable Projects in Bangladesh.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  In Bangladesh, two-thirds of its 156.6 million population lives in rural areas and is directly \nor indirectly dependent on the agriculture sector, and 2.0 million people join the labor force \nevery year. Growth of manufacturing is hence needed to provide jobs to workers involved in \nlow-productivity informal economic activities. The textile and garment industry generated export \nearnings of $20 billion, which accounted for 16.6% of gross domestic product of the country in \nFY 2013.2 Bangladesh is the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of textiles and garments and the \nindustry accounted for 83% of its total merchandise exports in FY2014.3 The industry employs \n4.2 million workers, of which nearly 80% are women.  \n \n3.  After two major disasters\u2014the 2012 Tazreen factory fire and the 2013 Rana Plaza \nbuilding  collapse\u2014the  Government  of  Bangladesh  signed  the  Bangladesh  Sustainability \nCompact  with  the  European  Union,  the  United  States  (US),  and  the  International  Labour \nOrganization.  The  compact  is  built  on  short-  and  long-term  commitments  related  to  three \ninterlinked pillars: (i) respect for labor rights, (ii) structural integrity of buildings and occupational \nsafety and health, and (iii) responsible business conduct. A recent study by the European \nCommission found that Bangladesh has made much progress since the launch of the compact \nin terms of labor rights protection and building and workplace safety improvement.4 Under the \nsecond  and  the  third  pillars  of  the  compact,  the  innovative  responsible  business  conduct \ninitiatives through the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh and the Alliance for \nBangladesh Worker Safety have made a considerable positive difference. The accord is a 5-\nyear, independent, legally binding agreement signed by more than 200 apparel corporations \nfrom 20 countries, two global trade unions, and numerous Bangladeshi trade unions. It has four \nnongovernment organization (NGO) participants and the International Labour Organization as \nthe independent chair. The alliance is a similar 5-year initiative founded by a group of North \nAmerican apparel companies and whose members represent the overwhelming majority of the \nNorth American importers of ready-made garments (RMGs) from Bangladesh, produced at \nmore than 700 factories. Both the accord and the alliance are funded by contributions from their \nmembers. The accord has an annual budget of close to $10.0 million, while the alliance had \ncollected revenues of $13.6 million by 30 June 2014. \n \n4.  Under the accord and the alliance, qualified consultants have been engaged to carry out \ninspections of RMG factories for fire, electrical, and structural safety. By April 2015, under the \naccord and the alliance all 1,900 factories under their remit had been inspected, which resulted \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Socially sustainable projects include (i) the construction or \nexpansion of textile and garment factories that meet the high structural, fire, and electrical safety standards \nrequired by the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh or the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, \nand (ii) improvement of existing factories to meet any of the above standards. Environmentally sustainable \nprojects include the construction of wastewater treatment and effluent treatment plants in the industry sector, \nprimarily in textiles and garments. \n2   ADB. 2014.

Summary inspection \nreports are made public in a searchable database, thus bringing more transparency to the \ngarment  supply  chain.  A  corrective  action  plan  (CAP)  with  an  implementation  timeline  is \nprescribed based on the findings of the initial inspection, and for factories that need structural \nchanges a detailed engineering assessment has been carried out. Accord and alliance staff \nwere mobilized to carry out follow-up inspections to monitor the implementation progress of the \nCAPs.5 Under the accord and alliance, capacity building is provided in the form of health and \nsafety trainings to workers and establishment of occupational safety and health committees \ncomprising worker representatives and management. \n \n5.  Water pollution by textile and garment factories, tanneries, and paper and pulp factories \nis  a  serious  problem  in  Bangladesh.  Despite  being  legally  required  to  establish  effluent \ntreatment plants (ETPs), many factories in these industries still operate without one. An early \nstudy conducted by the Centre for Water Policy and Development estimated that less than 10% \nof industries in Bangladesh have an ETP.6 Experts estimate that only 30% of dyeing and \nprinting units have installed ETPs.7 The discharge of large amounts of untreated effluent has a \ndramatic impact not only on the aquatic environment but also on the country\u2019s rural population, \nthe majority of whom rely on surface water sources for washing, bathing, irrigation, and fishing.  \n \n6.  To transform these key industries in a sustainable manner, access to long-term funding \nis required for factories to invest in  remediation and water pollution control. However, the \nfinance sector in Bangladesh is underdeveloped, with long-term funding available to banks \nprimarily through international financial institutions.8 The total costs of implementing the CAPs \nprescribed by the accord or the alliance are $250,000\u2013$400,000 per factory. The costs are \nmuch higher if a factory needs to be relocated and a new building is required. Many of the \ncompliant factories  also  need financing for  expansion,  as  export-driven  demand  is  shifting \ntowards factories complying with the accord or alliance standards. With the construction of new \ngarment factories or expansion of existing ones, ETPs need to be built, modified, or expanded, \nwhich creates additional financing needs.  \n \n7.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) identified BRAC Bank as a strong candidate for \nfunding  because  of  its  good  corporate  governance  standards,  solid  financial  performance, \nsound safeguard capacity, and experience and commitment to support the development of \nsustainable projects in Bangladesh. [The rest of this paragraph has been redacted due to \ncommercially sensitive information.] \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  BRAC Bank was established in July 2001 as a private commercial bank focused on \nproviding funding to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It is the seventh-largest bank \nin terms of assets in Bangladesh ($2.52 billion as of the end of 2014). It has grown significantly \nin  a  highly  competitive  banking  market  by  establishing  its  niche  in  the  SME  space  while \n                                                \n5    The accord has more than 80 full-time staff, including 16 remediation complaints case handlers and 39 safety \nengineers. The alliance has 39 full-time staff including a remediation team, which is headed by a chief safety \nofficer and includes three safety case managers and 18 engineers.  \n6    Centre for Water Policy and Development. 2004.

BRAC Bank is a leading innovator \nin the banking industry in Bangladesh. Its mobile payment subsidiary, bKash, is the market \nleader in the mobile banking industry. BRAC Bank will continue to focus on its core segment of \nSME lending while expanding to the retail segment and medium-sized corporates.

BRAC Bank is controlled by BRAC NGO (BRAC), an NGO with operations \nin 11 other countries, and is headquartered in Bangladesh. As of 31 December 2014, BRAC \nheld 44.64% of BRAC Bank, while IFC, the second-largest shareholder, held a stake of 5.34%. \nThe remainder is held by a large number of institutional investors and the general public, each \nholding a stake of less than 5%.   \n \n10.  Management.  This  paragraph  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially  sensitive \ninformation. \n \n11.  Governance  structure.

ADB will provide a 5-year senior unsecured term loan to BRAC Bank of up to $30 million. \nThe proceeds will be used to finance socially and environmentally sustainable projects, which \ninclude (i) the construction or expansion of RMG factories that meet the high structural, fire, and \nelectrical safety standards  required by the accord or the alliance; and (ii) improvement of \nexisting factories to meet any of the above standards. The loan will also fund construction of \nwastewater and ETPs in the industry sector, primarily in the textile and garment industry.9  \n \n                                                \n9   The Government of Bangladesh classifies industries into four categories based on their environmental impacts: \nGreen, Orange A, Orange B, and Red. In addition to textile and garment industry, the borrower will also have the \nright to use the proceeds of the proposed loan for subprojects in industries in lower environmental risk categories \n(green to orange B). \n ", "4 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  Use of proceeds. BRAC Bank will exclusively use the proceeds of the proposed loan to \nfund sustainable projects as stipulated in the loan agreement.  \n \n18.  Monitoring.  Monitoring  of the  project  will  be carried  out  by  ADB.  BRAC  Bank  will \nprovide  ADB  with  financial  and  other  reports  at  predetermined  regular  intervals  and  as \nrequested. These reports will include (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis, (ii) \naudited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis,  (iii)  compliance  certificates  for  financial \ncovenants,  (iv)  semiannual  reporting  on  the  list  of  sustainable  projects  financed  by  ADB \nincluding details of project implementation progress, (v) annual reporting on the implementation \nstatus of the environmental and social management system (ESMS) and gender action plan \n(GAP), and (vi) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed on by ADB and the \nborrower.  \n \n19.  This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \n20.  Evaluation. Pursuant to ADB\u2019s operations manual, monitoring reports will be prepared \nand submitted to ADB\u2019s Office of Risk Management regularly and at least annually.10 The first \nsuch report will be submitted no later than 1 year after the first disbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s loan to BRAC Bank will add value by helping to achieve the following: \n(i)  Providing critical long-term finance in support of textile and garment industry \nupgrades. Currently, local banks have no access to longer-term dollar finance from \ncommercial sources, as international banks only provide short-term trade finance of \nup to 1 year to local banks in Bangladesh, and there is no access to international \ncapital markets because of the low country rating. The longer-term funding from \nADB will enable BRAC Bank to improve its asset liability profile and to offer longer-\nterm dollar financing to its clients in critical sectors of the Bangladeshi economy to \nupgrade environmental, social, and safety standards.  \n(ii)  Enhancing BRAC Bank\u2019s environmental and social management system. [This \nsentence has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.] ADB has \nproposed further enhancements to BRAC Bank\u2019s screening and monitoring process, \nincluding the expansion of the bank\u2019s due diligence checklist to include other labor \naspects. \n(iii)  Incorporating gender elements in financing the ready-made garment industry. \nThrough a GAP, ADB will incorporate a number of elements in the subprojects to \nimprove  facilities  and  working  conditions  for  women  in  the  RMG  industry  in \nBangladesh. The GAP has several substantive and sound gender design features \nincluding  day  care,  safety,  and  health  clinics,  which  will  be  incorporated  into \noperations by the RMG factory sub-borrowers.  \n \nD.  Risks \n \n22.  Key risks of the proposed project include the following: \n(i)  Country risk. This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive \ninformation. \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2013. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10/BP.

This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n24.  Impacts.  The  proposed  project  is  expected  to  have  strong  development  impacts, \nincluding the following:  \n(i)  Enhanced health and safety standards of garment industry in Bangladesh. \nDespite being critical to the national economy and internationally competitive, the \ntextile and garment industry in Bangladesh has a poor safety record. The proposed \nloan  will  support  the  joint  efforts  of the Government  of  Bangladesh  and  donor \ngovernments, international apparel companies and retailers, trade unions, United \nNations agencies, multilateral and bilateral development agencies, and domestic \nindustries to improve the health and safety of workers in the RMG industry. Since \nclose to 80% of the RMG workers are women, the project will have a direct impact \non improving the working conditions for women workers in Bangladesh. \n(ii)  Finance sector development. The proposed project will support BRAC Bank by \nproviding access to longer-term foreign currency funding, which will in turn increase \nits ability to provide attractive long-term foreign currency loans to clients in key \nsectors of the economy. \n(iii)  Enhanced environmental standards in the industry sector. By financing the \ndevelopment of wastewater and effluent treatment plants, the proposed project will \ncontribute to the improvement of the local industries\u2019 environmental standard and \nreduce the  adverse  impact  on  the  aquatic  environment  and the country\u2019s  rural \npopulation.   \n \n25.  Outcome. The outcome of the proposed project is sustainable growth of BRAC Bank\u2019s \nlending for social and environmental projects.  \n  \n26.  Output.  The  project\u2019s  output  is  expansion  of  BRAC  Bank\u2019s  lending  to  textile  and \ngarment factories meeting adequate social and environmental safeguard standards, as well as \nits lending for construction of wastewater and effluent treatment plants. As a result of BRAC \nBank\u2019s lending, at least 10 RMG factories are expected to be upgraded or expanded, and at \nleast five wastewater treatment plants are expected to be constructed or expanded. Facilities \nand working conditions for about 22,000 women workers will be improved. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n27.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Under the Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the finance sector by supporting the \n ", "6 \n \ndevelopment of financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services.11 The project \nsupports three priorities identified by the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: (i) poverty reduction \nand inclusive economic growth, (ii) environment and climate change, and (iii) private sector \ndevelopment and operations. The project is aligned with the country partnership strategy for \nBangladesh for 2011\u20132015,12 which prioritizes private sector development to accelerate growth \nby developing the finance sector with an emphasis on clean energy, infrastructure finance, and \ncredit for SMEs. The country partnership strategy also notes that environmental considerations \nshould be integrated into sector interventions.  \n \n28.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  By  financing \nwastewater treatment plants in the industry sector, the proposed project is in line with ADB\u2019s \nWater Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 which identified wastewater management services as one \nof the key elements of ADB\u2019s operations in the water sector.13 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), ADB\u2019s loan is classified \nas category FI, based on potential impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples. The borrower will be prohibited from using the proceeds of the ADB loan to \nfinance projects that are category A under the Safeguard Policy Statement. The investment's \npotential environmental and social impacts, the risks associated with the borrower's existing \nand/or likely future portfolio, and its commitment and capacity for environmental and social \nmanagement  have  been  assessed.14 The  borrower  will  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment \nactivities list, ensure that investments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and \nregulations, comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement, and update its existing ESMS to ADB \nsatisfaction before the first disbursement of the proposed loan.15 BRAC will review government \ncertification, screen and monitor subprojects to ensure compliance with the national legislations.  \n \n30.  BRAC Bank will be required to increase its existing staff capacity to effectively carry out \nboth the assessment and oversight of the progress of the safeguards and social monitoring, \nincluding aspects of labor conditions and fire safety, as part of its ESMS enhancement. The \nenhanced  screening  process  covers  (i)  fire  safety  aspects,  including  verification  of  accord \nand/or  alliance  corrective  action  plans,  and  screening  out  high  risk  factories;  and  (ii) \nenvironmental and social aspects, which include review of the social and labor audits conducted \nby  the  factories\u2019  buyers  and  compliance  with  local  environmental  regulations.  Subprojects \nhaving high risk environment and safety issues will be excluded from financing. ADB will closely \nmonitor BRAC Bank\u2019s ESMS implementation. Details of the safeguards and social dimensions \nand  recommended  improvements  to  the  ESMS  are  provided  in  the  ESMS  arrangements \n(footnote 12).  \n \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2014.

The  borrower  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy,16 will take measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor \nstandards. BRAC Bank will report regularly to ADB on its compliance with such laws, and the \nmeasures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be conducted \nin accordance with ADB requirements. BRAC Bank is an equal opportunity employer and has a \ngender-equal  human  resources  policy.  The  transaction  is  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming under ADB\u2019s guidelines. BRAC Bank will implement the measures outlined in the \nGAP to promote gender equality in its operations, which include integration of gender-sensitive \ndesign of RMG factories.17 BRAC Bank will assign capable staff to monitor labor issues and \nGAP implementation, and this monitoring will be reflected in the annual environmental and \nsocial monitoring report to ADB.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n32.  BRAC Bank was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance.  Bangladesh  is  a  jurisdiction  in  which  no  strategic  deficiencies  have  been \nidentified by the Financial Action Task Force, and no integrity red flag has been identified. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n33.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n34.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 18  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh has no objection to the proposed assistance to BRAC Bank. ADB \nwill enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$30,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to BRAC Bank for Sustainable Projects in \nBangladesh, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \n                    President \n \n25 August 2015 \n                                                \n16  ADB. 2003.
