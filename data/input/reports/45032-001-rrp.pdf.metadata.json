This  two-tranche  program  grant  totals  $4  million.  The \nfirst  tranche  of  $2  million  will  be  disbursed  upon  grant  effectiveness  as  all  first  tranche  policy \nactions  have  been  accomplished.  The  second  tranche  of  $2  million  will  be  available  after \naccomplishing the policy actions for the second tranche, projected to be achieved in 1 year.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nNauru  faces  many  serious development  challenges,  with  almost  no  private  sector,  no \n3. \nbanking  services,  little  arable  land,  limited  fresh  water  supply,  extremely  high  levels  of  debt, \nand  inadequate  sources  of  government  revenue. Education  outcomes  are  improving  but  are \nstill poor by international standards and have contributed to high rates of youth unemployment. \nThere  are  comparatively  few  experienced  persons  to  take  on  key  management  roles  in  the \npublic sector. Levels of noncommunicable diseases (i.e., diabetes and cancer) are among the \nhighest in the world. There is an urgent need to improve health and education service delivery, \nset  standards  and  targets,  and  measure  progress.  A  healthy  and  better  educated  population \nwill be able to take greater advantage of job opportunities locally and abroad. That Nauru has \nbeen  invited  to  join  Australia\u2019s2 and  New  Zealand\u2019s  seasonal  worker  schemes  could  have  a \npositive effect on household incomes and the standard of living of the population at large. \n \nNauru  remains  vulnerable  to  the  current  uncertainty  in  the  global  economy.  The \n4. \ngovernment  generates  budget  revenues  from  (i)  dividends  and  returns  from  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs), mainly from phosphate mining, processing, and export; (ii) customs duties; \n(iii) fishing license fees; (iv) petroleum sales; (v) other nontax revenues such as hotel taxes and \nairport charges; and (vi) budget support from development partners.3 Tax-based revenues are \nlimited  due  to  the  country\u2019s  narrow  economic  base.  Currently,  Nauru  has  no  legislation \nauthorizing taxation of businesses or households. Tax revenues are limited to customs duties \nand excises. Nauru\u2019s limited and volatile revenues, like fishing licenses and phosphate-related \npayments, continue to be difficult to forecast, and both are subject to forces beyond the control \nof  the  government.  The  country  is  highly  dependent  on  external  assistance  to  meet  essential \nneeds, with domestic revenue accounting for only 42% of total expenditure in FY 2011. \n\n \nSince phosphate mining and exports are the domain of SOEs,4 the Nauruan economy is \n5. \ndominated by the public sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity. \nRepublic  of  Nauru  Phosphate  Corporation  (RONPHOS),  responsible  for  the  processing  and \nexport  of  phosphate,  has  been  unable  to  pay  its  projected  dividends  to  the  government  and \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   On  20  June  2012,  Nauru  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  Australia  to  become  the  first  country  to \n\nparticipate in the formal Pacific Seasonal Worker Scheme. \n\n3   Domestic  revenues  are  approximately  A$27.2  million,  of  which  32%  are  customs  duties  and  excises,  30%  are \n\nphosphate revenues, and 20% are fishing license revenues. \n\n4  Nauru  Rehabilitation  Corporation  is  responsible  for  mining  phosphate  and  rehabilitating  previously  mined  areas \n\nwhereas RONPHOS is responsible for phosphate processing and export. \n\n\f2 \n\nwas without a chief executive officer since 2008. The supply of electricity, water, and fuel was \npreviously provided by the Nauru Phosphate Company and subsequently by the Nauru Utilities \nAuthority  (NUA),  an  unincorporated  government  entity.  NUA\u2019s  uncertain  legal  status  has \nhampered its ability to manage its staff resources effectively. Poor asset management has led \nto frequent power outages. NUA has also required large fuel subsidies. \n \n6. \nPrivate  sector  activity  is  minimal.  In  addition  to  phosphate,  other  possible  industries \ninclude  niche  tourism,  commercial  tuna  fishing,  and  the  manufacture  of  dolomite  tiles. 5 \nAustralia,  in  a  recent  review  of  its  development  assistance,  acknowledged  that  the  growth \nprospects of Pacific microstates such as Nauru were limited. The review also prioritized plans \nto  considerably  increase  development  assistance  to  microstates  to  offset  the  lack  of  private \nsector activity.6 Much of this assistance is to be delivered through program-based approaches, \nwhich  will  require  an  improvement  in  these  countries\u2019  public  financial  management  (PFM) \ncapabilities.7 \n \n7. \nA recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment, prepared \nunder an Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional technical assistance (TA),8 identified several \nshortcomings of Nauru\u2019s PFM system. Particular areas of concern are poor internal controls, an \ninadequate regulatory framework for procurements, and unsustainable debt levels.  \n\n \nThe  overall  standard  of  internal  controls  is  weak.  Although  expenditure  controls  are \n8. \nstrong, other internal controls prescribed in the accounting and budget manual, last revised in \n1979, are weak and inconsistent with current practices. There are no financial regulations that \ngovern internal controls. \n\n \n9. \nThe regulatory framework for procurements is not enforceable due to the lack of specific \nregulations. It  is  also  deficient  in  defining  procurement  procedures  for  SOEs  and  government \nagencies, and does not define minimum requirements for competitive tenders, quotes, or other \nprocurement processes. The framework is not transparent and lacks a complaints mechanism.  \n \n10. \nADB  categorizes  Nauru  at  high  risk  of  debt  distress.  Its  external  debt  level  is  high  at \nover 95% of gross domestic product. The overall level of indebtedness (including external and \ninternal debt) has been reduced by 14% over the past 5 years to A$549.0 million, largely due to \nwrite-downs  and  debt  relief.  Internal  debt  amounts  to  A$480.7  million  and  external  debt  to \nA$68.8 million of the outstanding balance. \n\n \nNauru\u2019s PFM system is still largely paper-based and makes use of Excel spreadsheets. \n11. \nThis  system  adds  considerable  time  and  complexity  to  budgeting  and  increases  the  risk  of \nbudget overspending. Public finance, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics are \neither unavailable or out of date. \n\n \n12. \nNauru has large social and economic infrastructure needs, not least for a new port and \na  hospital.  External  funding  for  these  projects  will  hinge  on  the  preparation  of  a  credible, \nbudgeted, and prioritized strategic infrastructure development plan.  \n\n \nNauru  has  no  national  women\u2019s  policy  and  until  June  2011,  had  been  one  of  the  last \n\n13. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fseven countries in the world not to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms  of  Discrimination  against  Women  (CEDAW).  There  is  little  awareness  of  gender-\nsensitive  budgeting  issues  in  Nauru  and  women  are  generally  underrepresented  in  economic \ndecision-making bodies. \n \n14. \nTo  correct  the  above  shortcomings,  the  government  has  embarked  on  a  major  PFM \nreform as expressed in a PFM action plan, prepared under ADB TA (footnote 8), and underpins \nthis  program.  The  proposed  program  will  support  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  (i)  improve  its \nfiscal  performance,  (ii)  strengthen  corporate  governance  and  performance  of  key  SOEs,  and \n(iii) bolster  the  legal  and  policy  framework  for  equitable  access  to  social  services.  Efficient \npublic  financial  and  fiscal  management  will  result  in  better  development  outcomes  in  Nauru, \nwhere dependence on official development assistance will persist in the medium-to-long term.  \n \n15. \nThe program will strengthen public sector effectiveness, a priority under ADB\u2019s Pacific \nApproach,  2010\u20132014. 9 The  program  also  supports  implementing  the  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Strategy, 10  which  emphasizes  sustainable  fiscal  management.  It  envisions \nestablishment  of  a  new  trust  fund,  which  ADB  has  assisted  in  the  design  of,  to  save  some \ncurrent revenues for future generations.11 The program was developed in consultation with the \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  which  is  Nauru\u2019s  largest  bilateral \ndevelopment  partner.  Ongoing  dialogue  with  the  government,  the  Pacific  Financial  Technical \nAssistance Center (PFTAC), and the Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Center (PIAC),12 has been \ncentral to the preparation of the program. ADB is providing TA to the government in the areas \nof  PEFA,  PFM  action  plan,  and  more  rigorous  corporate  governance  for  NUA  and \nRONPHOS. 13  PIAC  provided  assistance  to  formulate  the  Nauru  Economic  Infrastructure \nStrategy and Investment Plan. AusAID provides assistance through resident advisors and TA in \nthe  areas  of  (i)  financial  management  information  system  (FMIS),  (ii)  revenue  policy  and \nadministration, and (iii) reforms in the education and health sectors. PFTAC supports reforms \nof  financial  instructions  and  the  preparation  of  balance  of  payments  and  national  accounts \nstatistics. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be higher living standards of the population of Nauru. The outcome will \n16. \nbe the delivery of improved equitable social services by the government. Better social service \ndelivery  will  lead  to  better  health  and  education  outcomes,  which  will  promote  greater \nparticipation  of  Nauruans  in  income-generating  activities  both  domestically  and  abroad.  The \nprogram will be structured in two tranches with two sets of policy actions to be accomplished by \nthe end of July 2012 and the end of August 2013, respectively. All of the 12 policy actions, 5 of \nwhich are triggers for the first tranche release, have been completed. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2009.

These \noutputs  will  improve  the  delivery  of  social  services  by  increasing  the  resources  available  for \nthem as well as improving the equity and efficiency of their use.  \n \nOutput  1:  Stronger  public  financial  management  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance. The \n18. \nprogram  will  rectify  weaknesses  specified  in  the  2011  PEFA  assessment  for  Nauru.14 Policy \nactions under output 1 are in accordance with the government\u2019s PFM action plan and include \n(i) revenue  management,  (ii)  budget  and  planning  processes,  and  (iii)  overall  financial  and \nofficial development assistance management.  \n\n \n19. \nRevenue management. The 2011 PFM action plan recommended (i) the establishment \nof  a  national  revenue  office  to  improve  revenue  collection  and  administration,  and  (ii)  the \nbroadening of the tax base. Under tranche 1, a revenue office was established in September \n2011.  For  tranche  2,  the  government  will  adopt  a  new  taxation  policy  framework  including \nmeasures to broaden the tax base.  \n \nBudget  and  planning  processes.  A  key  recommendation  of  the  PFM  action  plan, \n20. \ndeveloped  under  ADB  regional  TA  (footnote  8),  is  the  replacement  of  the  current  financial \nmanagement  system  (based  on  paper  and  Excel  spreadsheets)  with  a  full  electronic  FMIS \n(computerized accounting system). Under tranche 1, the government established the FMIS with \nassistance  from  AusAID  in  September  2011.  The  FMIS\u2014Technology  One  Financials\u2014will \nensure stronger financial management and accounting capability. The system will reduce both \nthe  amount  of  paperwork  and  time  required  for  the  budget  and  expenditure  approvals.  In \naddition,  all expenditure  commitments  and  actual  payments  can  be  simultaneously taken  into \naccount when the assessment is done. If a particular line item has low payments against it but \nhas  high  commitments  that  result  in  insufficient  budget  being  available  for  a  proposed \npurchase,  the  system  will  not  allow  the  purchase  requisition  to  be  processed.  This  greatly \nreduces the risk of overspending against the approved budget. The FMIS has four modules: (i) \ngeneral  ledger,  (ii)  accounts  payable,  (iii)  accounts  receivable,  and  (iv) purchasing.  Since  the \nFMIS  went  live  on  7  September  2011,  progress  has  been  steady.  The  FMIS  was  initially \nintroduced in the finance, education, and health ministries, and the Chief Justice\u2019s Department.  \n \nSenior  government  officials  will  develop  awareness  and  understanding  of  gender-\n21. \nresponsive  budgeting  processes  and  requirements.  This  will  improve  equitable  budget \nallocations and  expenditures.  As  part  of  tranche  2,  all  members  of  the  National  Development \nCommittee will be accustomed to gender-sensitive budgeting through tabling and discussion of \nan  issues  paper  at  meetings  of  the  committee.  Such  heightened  awareness  will  complement \ngender-related  reforms  to  legal  and  policy  frameworks  and  increase  the  likelihood  of  their \neffective implementation. \n \nUnder  tranche  1,  the  government  adopted  the  National  Economic  Infrastructure \n22. \nStrategy  and  Investment  Plan  in  February  2012,  which  was  developed  with  the  assistance  of \nPIAC, and will implement this plan under tranche 2. \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2011.  Nauru:  Public  Financial  Management  Performance  Report.  Consultant\u2019s  report.  Manila  (TA  6507-\n\n \n\nREG). \n\n \n\n\fUnder tranche 1, the program supported the publication of historical national accounts \n23. \nand  balance  of  payments  statistics  for  2004\u20132009  in  February  2012.  Under  tranche  2,  the \nprogram  includes  (i) the  publication  of  national  accounts  and  balance  of  payments  data  for \n2010\u20132011, and (ii) the conduct of a census and a household income and expenditure survey. \n\n \n24. \nOverall  financial  and  aid  management.  PFTAC  drafted  a  revised  set  of  financial \ninstructions,  incorporating  more  effective  internal  controls.  Under  tranche  2,  the  program  will \nsupport the further development and adoption of these instructions taking into account changes \nfrom the introduction of the FMIS.  \n \n25. \nThe government developed and approved a new procurement policy under tranche 1 in \nMay 2012. This new policy and guidelines will require the centralization and outsourcing of all \ngovernment and SOE procurement above A$5,000 to an independent, external agency. Under \ntranche  2,  the  government  will  implement  the  new  procurement  policy  and  guidelines  by \ncontracting an external procurement agency. Dedicated Nauruan officials will be appointed to \nwork with the external agency and at the warehouse. AusAID will provide capacity development \nTA to assist the government in adequately overseeing the performance of the external agency \nin FY2013.15 \n \n26. \nThe  government  is  also  accelerating  the  outsourcing  of  the  bulk  procurement  of \npetroleum  for  the  country.  Potential  benefits  of  this  arrangement  include  (i)  cost  savings  and \nadditional  revenues  for  the  national  budget,  (ii)  better  security  and  quality  of  fuel  supply,  and \n(iii)  competitive  prices  for  the  local  market.  Prior  to  entering  into  such  an  arrangement,  the \ngovernment will conduct a detailed cost\u2013benefit analysis in which ADB will participate. \n \n27. \nAn updated debt strategy, developed with the assistance of ADB regional TA, provides \nrevised debt figures and recommendations for the government on managing internal debt. This \nincludes the liquidation of the Bank of Nauru, which accounts for 90% of internal debt. Under \ntranche 1, the government adopted an updated debt management strategy in February 2012. \nUnder  tranche 2,  the  government  will  advance  the  liquidation  of  the  Bank  of  Nauru  through \nagreement of a settlement with depositors.  \n\n \nOutput  2:  More  rigorous  corporate  governance  and  economic  performance  of \n28. \nselected  state-owned  enterprises.  The  program  will  support  the  government\u2019s  effort  to \nimprove the corporate governance and performance of two key SOEs\u2014NUA and RONPHOS\u2014\nassisted  by  ADB  TA  (footnote  13).  The  program  will  support  the  corporatization  and \ncommercialization  of  NUA  to  improve  its  corporate  governance  and  economic  performance. \nUnder tranche 1, NUA was corporatized through the passage of an act establishing the Nauru \nUtilities  Corporation  (NUC) \ntranche  2,  NUC  will  be  gradually \ncommercialized through the use of performance-based contracts for senior management.  \n\nin  July  2011.  Under \n\n \n A  recent  review 16  recommended  the  following  actions  to  improve  RONPHOS\u2019s \n29. \nperformance:  (i)  a  new  corporate  structure  with  an  executive  team  comprising  the  chief \nexecutive officer, an operations manager, and a corporate manager; and (ii) legislative changes \nto  separate  governance  from  management.  Under  tranche  1,  a  chief  executive  officer  was \nrecruited  to  focus  on  strategic  issues  in  September  2011,  including  the  preparation  of  a \nbusiness plan and the implementation of a performance management system. Under tranche 2, \n\n                                                 \n15 AusAID. 2012. Review of Government of Nauru\u2019s Procurement Policy Framework. Canberra. \n16 ADB.  2011.

Women  have  generally  been  underrepresented  on  SOE  boards  that  provide  essential \nservices  and  generate  much  of  the  country\u2019s  income.  Under  tranche  2,  the  government  will \nappoint at least one qualified woman each to the majority of SOE boards. \n\nlike \n\nNauruan  women, \n\ntheir  male  counterparts,  have \n\n \n31. \nOutput  3:  Enhanced  legal  and  policy  framework  for  equitable  social  service \ndelivery.  Equitable  social  service  delivery  will  be  improved  through  (i)  a  new  education  act \nrequiring  compulsory  secondary  education  for  males  and  females;  (ii) an  education  re-entry \nprogram  including  support  for  single  mothers;  (iii)  adoption  of  detailed  sector  strategies  for \nhealth  and  education;  and  (iv)  adoption  of  a  national  women\u2019s  policy  and  CEDAW  plan  of \naction.  \n \n32. \nUnder tranche 1, detailed sector strategies were introduced for health and education by \nJuly  2011,  which  include  numerical  targets  for  enrollments,  completion  rates,  infant  mortality \nrates,  and  maternal  health.  This  has  already  begun  to  pay  dividends  in  improving  education \nservice delivery. \n \n33. \nlow  secondary  education \ncompletion  rates  (less  than  20%).  This  limits  access  to  jobs  in  Nauru  and  abroad.  Under \ntranche  1,  the  Parliament  passed  the  Education  Act  in  July  2011,  which  makes  primary  and \nsecondary education compulsory for children aged 6\u201318 years. For tranche 2, the government \nis preparing a re-entry program for school dropouts that will enable single mothers to re-enter \nthe education system.   \n \n34. \nThe Constitution gives equal rights to women and men. Under tranche 1, Nauru ratified \nCEDAW in June 2011. For tranche 2, the government is preparing a legal review for CEDAW \ncompliance,  with  a  plan  to  finalize  the  review  report  in  2013.  A  national  women\u2019s  policy  and \nCEDAW implementation plan of action are also under preparation for tranche 2 by the Ministry \nof Home Affairs and are expected to be adopted by August 2013.  \n \nD. \n \n35. \nThe  government  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $4.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  grant  size  was  determined  based  on  the \nadjustment  costs  for  the  proposed  reforms,  which  include  implementation  of  the  FMIS, \noutsourcing  government  procurement,  more  spending  on  health  and  education  under  new \nsector  strategies,  establishment  of  a  revenue  office,  cost  of  corporatizing  NUA,  and \nestablishment  of  a  performance  management  system  for  key  SOEs.  The  government  has \nspecified that a portion of the tranche 2 grant proceeds may be put aside to fund future social \nservice delivery. \n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe program will be implemented over 34 months, from June 2011 to April 2014, with \n36. \npost-program  monitoring  continuing  to  September  2014.  Nauru  is  classified  as  at  high  risk  of \ndebt  distress  and  is  therefore  eligible  to  receive  100%  grant  assistance.  The  grant  will  be \nprovided  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $2  million  will  be  available  upon  grant \neffectiveness as all the policy actions for the first tranche have been accomplished. The second \ntranche of $2 million will be available upon as the government accomplishes the policy actions \nfor the second  tranche, projected to be achieved by August 2013. \n\n \n\n\fThe  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  to  Nauru  as  the  recipient  according  to \n37. \nADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures. 17  The  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries;  items  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources  are  excluded.18 Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the  government  stipulating  that  the \nvalue  of  the  total  imports  of  Nauru,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible \nimports, and imports financed under other official development assistance, is greater than the \namount of the grant to be disbursed during a particular year. Local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the grants will be used to support public expenditure objectives under the program. \n\n \n38. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  oversee  policy, \nlegal, and regulatory actions and ensure that the agreed policy actions are duly carried out. The \nMOF will also be responsible for the overall implementation of the program, including carrying \nout all policy actions, program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program \nrecords.  The  MOF  will  (i)  establish  and  maintain  a  performance  evaluation  system  for  the \nprogram,  which  will  be  derived  from  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  policy  letter,  and \npolicy matrix; and (ii) monitor and report to ADB, on an semiannual basis over the term of the \nprogram,  the  implementation  of  policy  actions  and  their  impact  on  program  outcome,  in  line \nwith the program impact and outcome indicators agreed upon. Specific policy actions will also \nbe  implemented  by  the  NUC,  RONPHOS,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services,  the \nMinistry of Education, and the Ministry of Home Affairs.  \n \n39. \nThe  government  will  continue  to  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  policy \ndiscussions  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for  program \nimplementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy \nproposals.  ADB,  in  collaboration  with  MOF  and  key  development  partners,  will  undertake \nregular reviews of program performance. The reviews will evaluate implementation of the policy \nreform measures and assess the impact, describe lessons learned during the program period, \nand  outline  policy  actions  and  any  assistance  needed  for  sustained  and  inclusive  economic \ngrowth.  The  program  design  has  drawn  on  dialogue  with  civil  society,  such  as  the  Nauru \nPrivate  Business  Sector  Organization  and  Nauru  Island  Association  of  Nongovernment \nOrganizations. During implementation, ADB will continue consultation with civil society. \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \nConsulting services \nDisbursement \n\nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements\nJune 2011\u2013April 2014 \n30 September 2014 \n\nNDC: Chief Secretary (chair), Secretaries for Finance, Home Affairs, Health, \nand Education, Chief Executive Officers for RONPHOS and NUC (members) \nMOF \nMOF, NUC, RONPHOS, and ministries of education; health; and home affairs \nn/a \nn/a \nn/a \nThe $4.0 million policy-based grant will be disbursed in two tranches: \nTranche 1: $2.0 million \nTranche 2: $2.0 million \n\nMOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance,  n/a  =  not  applicable,  NDC  =  National  Development  Committee,  NUC  =  Nauru  Utilities \nCorporation, RONPHOS = Republic of Nauru Phosphate Corporation, TBD = to be decided. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1998.

Since  the  resumption  of  phosphate  exports  in  2007, 19  phosphate  mining  and \nprocessing (included in manufacturing) has regained its prominence in the Nauru economy and \nin FY2009, accounted for almost 40% of gross domestic product. Primary phosphate reserves \nare estimated to be enough for 1\u20132 years of production, and deeper, secondary reserves are \nexpected to last 20 years. Some increase in phosphate exports is now taking place; phosphate \nexports of 385,000 tons were achieved for FY2011 compared with 17,200 tons in FY2006, the \nfirst  year  after  the  resumption  of  phosphate  exports,  and  319,000  tons  in  FY2010.  The  world \nphosphate  rock  market  has  improved  after  declining  in  FY2009.  The  long-term  outlook  is \nfavorable at present and demand is expected to continue to grow at an average rate of around \n3%  per  annum  during  the  10-year  period  2011\u20132020.  Recently  improved  phosphate-loading \nfacilities  and  stronger  management  of  RONPHOS  are  expected  to  lift  phosphate  exports  to \nover 500,000 tons in FY2012, taking economic growth to 4.8% in FY2012 and 4.2% in FY2013. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\nPublic financial management. The quality of PFM has improved in recent years. The \n41. \ngovernment\u2019s  recent  major  reform  initiative  has  been  the  adoption  and  maintenance  of  a \nprudent  fiscal  management  strategy,  first  initiated  in  2004.  The  government\u2019s  conservative \nfiscal  strategy  has  ended  a  long  period  of  fiscal  mismanagement  and  stabilized  its  financial \nposition.  This  strategy  has  included  achieving  a  balanced  budget,  directing  government \nexpenditure  to  the  provision  of  basic  services,  starting  to  widen  the  government\u2019s  revenue \nbase, stabilizing its very high debt position through debt write-offs and negotiated settlements \nwith creditors, and reducing the size of the public service and the value of subsidies provided to \npublic enterprises. Donors have contributed a high level of TA in several PFM areas since 2008 \ndue  to  weak  capacity  levels  within  the  government.  Weaknesses  remain,  however,  in  public \nsector financial management, which are adversely affecting public service delivery, threatening \naggregate  fiscal  discipline,  and  undermining  the  strategic  allocation  of  public  resources.  The \nlimited  medium-term  focus  in  budgeting,  weak  internal  control  systems  (especially  in \nprocurement and internal audit), and low accounting standards represent major constraints to \nthe delivery of basic services. The absence of government financial statements has prevented \nstakeholder scrutiny that would normally assist the review of sector budgetary allocations and \nservice delivery performance levels. The government has prepared a PFM action plan following \non from the PEFA assessment in 2011. \n \n42. \nAnticorruption  efforts.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOF  and  forms  part  of  the  legal \ndocuments.  Consistent  with \nto  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  program.  These  measures \nwill  complement  anticorruption  measures  and  actions  under  way  to  improve  financial \naccountability.  Key  actions  relate  to  the  revision  of  financial  management  systems,  the \nrefinement of financial instructions and the improvement of procurement practices. \n\nits  commitment \n\n                                                 \n19  Phosphate exports had ceased in the early  2000s due to poor infrastructure and lack of demand but resumed in \n2007 following an agreement between Nauru and the Australian fertilizer  company, Incitec Pivot, to refurbish the \nfacility. \n\n\f \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n43. \nThe  program  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  social  development  through  the \nfollowing  key  program  components.  More  rigorous  corporate  governance  and  economic \nperformance  of  SOEs  will  lead  to  (i)  more  phosphate  revenues,  which  will  provide  more \nresources  for  social  service  delivery  and  poverty  reduction;  (ii)  reduced  transfers  of  scarce \npublic  resources  to  SOEs,  which  will  free  revenues  for  use  in  more  activities  related  to \ndevelopment and poverty reduction; and (iii) more efficient and equitable service delivery from \nNUC.  Stronger  PFM  will  lead  to  (i)  better  value  for  money  in  procurement,  which  will  free  up \nmore  government  resources;  (ii) strengthened  tax  administration,  which  will  increase  revenue \navailable to the government for social service delivery; (iii) better tracking and accountability of \ngovernment funds through a new FMIS; and (iv) reduced debt burden on the country through a \ndebt management strategy and liquidation of the Bank of Nauru. \n \n44. \nThe program is anchored to the National Sustainable Development Strategy, which the \ngovernment developed through a consultative process. Priority services to be supported under \nthe  program  are  derived  from  consultation  with  the  ministries  of  commerce,  industries,  and \nenvironment; education; finance; health; and home affairs and reflect their respective priorities \nand budget positions.  \n\n \n45. \nThere will also be economic empowerment of women through greater representation on \nSOE boards and greater awareness of gender-sensitive budget issues. Social service delivery \nwill be made more equitable through (i) the Education Act that requires compulsory secondary \neducation  for  males  and  females;  (ii)  an  education  re-entry  program  that  includes  support  for \nsingle  mothers;  (iii)  implementation  of  detailed  sector  strategies  for  health  and  education  that \ninclude numerical targets for enrollments, completion rates, infant mortality rates, and maternal \nhealth; and (iv) adoption of a national women\u2019s policy and CEDAW plan of action.   \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nD. \n\n46. \nProgram  activities  will  be  confined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms  and  none  of  the \nactivities will result in or lead to involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples issues. Thus, \nthe program is category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nNo  adverse  environmental  impacts  have  been  identified.  Public  consultation  was  carried  out \nduring program preparation.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n47.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment and  risk  management  plan.20 Key  risks  in  the  program  revolve  around \nweak  local  capacity  and  political  instability.  This  grant  has  been  developed  under  three \nseparate  governments  in  Nauru.  ADB  has  maintained  a  high  level  of  consultation  with  the \ngovernment, the opposition, and other stakeholders during processing and this will continue to \nbe a feature of the grant during implementation.  \n\n                                                 \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nWeak capacity of government \nagencies to implement \nreforms \n\nPolitical instability weakens \nfiscal discipline and policy \ncommitment \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures\nTA will be provided in coordination with other development partners to assist the \ngovernment in implementing reforms. ADB is providing TA to the government in the \nareas of assessment of and plans for improving public financial management and \nstrengthening corporate governance of the Nauru Utilities Authority and the Republic \nof Nauru Phosphate Corporation. The Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Center \nprovided assistance to formulate the Nauru Economic Infrastructure Strategy and \nInvestment Plan. AusAID provides assistance through resident advisors and TA in \nthe areas of (i) a financial management information system, (ii) revenue policy and \nadministration, and (iii) reforms in the education and health sectors. The Pacific \nFinancial Technical Assistance Centre supports reforms to financial instructions and \nstatistics. \n\nReforms are anchored to the National Sustainable Development Strategy, which \nwas developed with extensive consultation and supported by both sides of \nParliament. The program has bipartisan support having been developed under three \nseparate governments in Nauru, and ADB maintains policy dialogue with both \ngovernment and opposition. Program targets are coordinated with AusAID's \nperformance-based payments mechanism under its Partnership for Development \nwith Nauru. ADB will maintain a high level of consultation throughout \nimplementation.  \n\nResults will be more \nperceptible on the fiscal front \nthan in long-term growth of \nproduction and productivity \n\nThe program includes measures which directly impact on growth such as reforms to \nstrengthen the phosphate export SOE, RONPHOS. Growth targets will be monitored \nvia ADB's ongoing economic monitoring through the Pacific Economic Monitor, \nsupported by strengthened statistical capability.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development; RONPHOS = Republic \nof Nauru Phosphate, SOE = State-owned enterprise, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB country team. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nThe government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program will \n48. \nconform  with  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the grant documents.
