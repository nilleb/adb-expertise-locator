An  environmental  assessment  will  be  an \nintegral  component  of  project  preparation  being  undertaken  in \nparallel  for  a  proposed  ensuing  project.  The  Government  of \nPakistan  (the  Government)  will  provide  an  assurance  that  any \nthe \nensuing  project  will  be  prepared \nEnvironment Policy (2002) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \nThe  TA  project  provides  a  key  intervention  for  the  long-term \npartnership  between  ADB  and  Pakistan  to  develop  Lahore\u2019s \ntransport sector. It supports recruitment of a transaction advisor to \nhelp  formulate,  structure,  and  take  to  the  market  a  public-private \npartnership  for  the  first  priority  line  of  a  proposed  rapid  mass \ntransit system (RMTS) in Lahore.  \n \nLahore  is  the  capital  of  Punjab  province  and  the  second  largest \ncity in Pakistan. Its population, just under 9 million, is growing at a \nrate of about 3.0% per year. Despite a number of initiatives over \nthe  years,  such  as  introducing  and  improving  fleets  of  buses, \ntraffic  gridlock  and  congestion  are  now  constraining  growth, \ncurtailing  investment,  and  reducing  the  city\u2019s  competitiveness. \nBased on feasibility studies and other analysis, the Lahore RMTS \nhas strong potential to provide an attractive and efficient option for \npublic  transportation,  an  alternative  to  private  vehicles,  and  a \ntransport \ncleaner \ntechnologies.  In  sum,  the  proposed  RMTS  will  help  reduce \nconstraints  on  growth,  investment,  and  city  competitiveness \ncurrently imposed by the state of Lahore\u2019s transport system. \n \nThe TA will improve the urban rapid mass transportation network \nin  Lahore.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  is  a  structured  design  for  the \nLahore RMTS Project feasible for ADB financing.  \n \nThe investment cost of the TA project, to finance the recruitment \nof  transaction  advisor,  is  estimated  at  $7.5  million  equivalent, \nincluding foreign exchange costs of $6.0 million and local currency \ncosts of $1.5 million equivalent. \n \n\nthan  existing  bus  and  other \n\ntechnology \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n($ million) \n\n6.00 \n0.00 \n6.00 \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n \n% \n 80 \n 20 \n100 \n\nTotal \nCost \n6.00 \n 1.50 \n7.50  \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.00 \n1.50 \n1.50 \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment  \nTotal \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  SDR  3,794,000  ($6.0  million  equivalent)  in  special \ndrawing  rights  and  various  currencies  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources  will  be  provided.  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  rate  of \n1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. \n \nUntil 31 December 2009 \n \n30 June 2009 \n\nthe \n\n \nThe  Planning  &  Development  Board  of  the  Punjab  provincial \ngovernment will be the Executing Agency.  \n \nThe  Planning  &  Development  Board  will  engage  the  transaction \nadvisor and oversee the TA. It has agreed to assign a team of full-\ntime staff to assist in implementing the TA. \n \nA project steering committee for the Lahore RMTS, chaired by the \nchairman,  Planning  &  Development,  Punjab  provincial \ngovernment,  was  formed  in  April  2005,  and  provides  policy \nsupport, oversees project progress and letting and supervision of \nfacilitates  coordination  and  cooperation  among \ncontracts, \nagencies  concerned,  and  supervises \nformulation  and \nimplementation of the transport integration strategy.   \n \nThe Transport Department (TD) will be the Implementing Agency \nfor  the  advisory  services,  and  the  TD  staff  and  executive  staff  of \nthe  utilities  agencies  will  provide  additional  help  as  and  when \nnecessary.  \n \nUnder the TA, a package of advisory services will be provided by \na  consultant  firm  with  expertise  and  experience  in  assessing, \nstructuring,  and  raising  finance  on  the  capital  markets  for  rapid \nmass transit systems in the Asia region.  \n \nInternational  and  national  consultants  financed  from  ADB  funds \nwill  be  recruited  as  firms  under  the  quality-based  selection \nmethod,  using  full  technical  proposals,  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time).  \n \nAn  urban  rapid  mass  transit  system  would  likely  impact  Lahore, \nand its large population of poor residents in a number of positive \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nto \n\nways.  It  would  allow  the  city  to  function  effectively  even  when \ncongestion is severe, and enable people to commute more easily \nto work. The additional capacity provided would allow the dynamic \ncity  center \nto \nthrive  economically,  and  over \nfundamentally shift the structure of the city, and guide and support \nfuture  development  in  a  more  balanced,  sustainable  manner. \nOther  road  users  would  benefit  from  reduced  congestion  and \npollution.  The  Government  would  benefit  from  policy  options  not \npreviously available that accelerate an understanding of the need \nto manage the urban transport system as an integrated whole.  \n \n\ntime  help \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  Major  risks  include  capacity  issues  related  to  the  ability  of  the \nGovernment  to  lead  and  implement  the  TA  in  a  timely  manner, \nand  the  maintenance  of  political  stability  and  security.  Due \ndiligence  will  assess  safeguards.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  could  be  substantial  under  an  ensuing  investment \nproject. \nto  ensure \ncooperation from civil society and nongovernment organizations. \n \nThe \ninternational \ninvestment bank, is expected to effectively attract sufficient private \nfor  concession \nsector \nstructures  is  assumed  to  be  appropriate  and  applicable  to  the \nPakistan context. \n \n\nIntensive  consultation  will  be \n\ntransaction  structure, \n\ninternational  practice \n\nled  by  a  credible \n\ninterest.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nIn \n\nframework, \n\nits  medium-term  development \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n2. \nthe  Government  of  Pakistan  (the \nGovernment) committed to enhancing the competitiveness of, and quality of life in, its large cities. \nA high-level committee led by the Planning Commission is coordinating urban development, with \nLahore  as  one  of  the  core  components  of  a  long-term  economic  development  strategy.  Vision \n2020  for  Pakistan  highlights  the  vital  role  to  be  played  by  the  urban  sector  in  realizing  national \ndevelopment goals. Urban centers such as Lahore are to be developed within the framework of \nstrategic  master  plans,  incorporating  economic  parameters  for  efficiency  gains  to  make  cities \ncompetitive  in  the  global  and  regional  context.  Lahore  is  seen  as  one  of  the  great  cities  of  the \nworld, a major entertainment, intellectual, and commercial hub imbued with rich cultural heritage. \n \nThe Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance to develop a \n3. \nrapid mass transit system (RMTS) for the city of Lahore, as part of ADB\u2019s growing engagement in \nthe country\u2019s urban infrastructure and services sector. The Punjab provincial government (PPG)  \nhas  undertaken  extensive  preparatory  work  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  the  proposed  system, \nutilizing  a  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  approach,  which  envisages  a  long-term  plan  to \nfinance,  construct,  and  operate  four  mass  rail  lines  interconnected  to  multimodal  transport.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB support to recruit a highly qualified international advisory team \nto design the transaction and take it to the market for private sector financing. Engagement of a \ntransaction  advisor  will  ensure  that  the  proposed  PPP  structure  is  sound,  based  on  best \ninternational practice, and attracts the best possible partners from the private sector.  \n \nA. \n \n4. \nEconomy.  Lahore,  the  capital  of  populous  Punjab  province,  and  second  largest  city  of \nPakistan, is the cultural, political, and educational center of Pakistan. Lahore\u2019s economic base is \nbroad and varied. A major industrial agglomeration with about 9,000 industrial units, it has shifted \nin  recent  decades  from  manufacturing  to  service  industries.  Some  42%  of  its  work  force  is \nemployed in finance, banking, real estate, community, cultural, and social services. The city is the \ncountry\u2019s  largest  software  producing  center,  and  hosts  a  growing  computer-assembly  industry. \nLahore has the second largest stock exchange in the country.  \n \n5. \nDemography.  Punjab  is  Pakistan\u2019s  most  urbanized  province,  with  roughly  36%  of  its \npopulation  living  in  urban  areas.  According  to  the  1998  census,  Lahore  had  a  population  of  \n4.5 million in 1998, up from 2.7 million in 1981. Based upon the intercensal (1981\u20131998) annual \ngrowth  rate,  the  current  population  of  Lahore  is  estimated  at  7  million.  The  population  in  the \nproject area covered by the Lahore RMTS was estimated to be around 8.7 million in 2006, and is \nforecast  to  increase  to  about  16.2  million  by  2025  at  an  annual  average  growth  rate  of  around \n3%. \n \n6. \nMegacity  Development  Trends.  The  geographic  location  and  economic  potential  of \nLahore  have  drawn  both  labor  and  capital  for  many  decades,  but  the  city  has  never  been  in  a \nposition  to  maximize  this  potential  for  its  own  benefit.  Little  investment  has  been  made  in  the \ncity\u2019s  infrastructure  over  the  past  two  decades;  traffic  congestion  is  now  unmanageable  and \nconstrains  economic  growth.  New  investments  and  new  additions  to  the  labor  force  are  not \noptimally located in the city, resulting in haphazard development, a polluted urban environment, \nand, for many households, poor quality of life.  \n \n \n\n\f 2 \n\n \n\nPoverty. Based on the 2001 poverty line1 and personal incomes for fiscal year 20022 for \n7. \nLahore,  30%  of  the  city\u2019s  total  population  is  poor.  The  incidence  of  poverty  varies  in  the  nine \ntowns  in  the  city.  The  highest  incidence  is  in  the  more  than  300  katchi  abadis,  which  are \ninformally developed and poor settlements and houses and home to about 35%\u201350% of the city\u2019s \ntotal population. The vast majority of the population in katchi abadis live below the poverty line.  \n\nUrban  Environment.  Lahore  faces  and  causes  significant  environmental  issues  and \n8. \npressures.  All  of  Lahore\u2019s  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater  is  untreated,  and  finds  its  way \ndirectly  or  indirectly  to  the  Ravi  River.  Many  of  Lahore\u2019s  industries  generate  a  mixture  of \nchemicals and toxic substances, the bulk of which is discharged into the river or creeks. Vehicle-\ngenerated  air  pollution  is  severe,  with  high  concentrations  of  suspended  particulate  matter \ncausing respiratory problems for a large number of Lahore\u2019s residents.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nUrban Transport: A Constraint to Growth  \n\n1. \n \n9. \nWith a current population of about 9 million, Lahore is growing at 3.32% per annum. The \nnumber  of  vehicles  has phenomenally  increased  in  recent  years,  resulting  in  heavy  congestion, \nslower  traffic,  increasing  road  accidents,  waste  of  fuel  and  person-hours,  and  environmental \ndegradation.  Despite  a  number  of  initiatives,  such  as  introducing  fleets  of  buses,  the  growing \nproblems  of  gridlock  and  congestion  now  constrain  growth,  curtail  investment,  and  reduce  the \ncity\u2019s competitiveness. \n \n10. \nThe  transport  network  has  been  inadequately  developed  and  maintained.  This  is \nexacerbated by the diversity of the traffic mix and lack of traffic and pedestrian discipline. In the \npast,  18-seater  minivans  dominated  public  transport  services;  however,  rising  incomes  of  the \ngrowing population have generated an increase in travel demand and the desire for higher quality \ntransport.  Properly  organized  routes  and  new  services  have  been  introduced,  increasing \nwillingness to pay premium fares and a desire for better services. \n \n11. \nOne potential solution, a proposed light rail transit system, was first studied as part of the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s Comprehensive Study of the Transportation System in \nLahore  in  1991.  This  was  reviewed  and  updated  under  the  1993  World  Bank-funded  Lahore \nTraffic and Transport Studies. In 2005, the concept was revisited, and the Government financed a \nfeasibility study, which was completed in July 2006. The next phase is a reference design study, \nnow  under  way,  which  will  take  the  RMTS  design  to  30%\u201335%  completion,  sufficient  for  the \nscheme to attract funding. \n \n12. \nearly implementation of an efficient and effective RMTS for Lahore. The system is expected to \n \n\nOn  19  October  2006,  the  Government  approved  concept  clearance  for  the  Project,  and \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nincrease commercial and residential development; \nminimize duplication and overlapping on public transport routes; \nmaximize ridership through an integrated multimodal system; \noffer better service in terms of speed, frequency, and easy accessibility to reduce \ncar and motorcycle dependency; \nprovide  safe,  secure,  environmentally  sustainable,  reliable,  and  dependable \ntransport that meets needs and aspirations of this growing city; and \n\n                                                 \n1  The  poverty  line  adopted  by  the  Government  is  based  on  a  caloric  norm  of  2,350  calories  per  adult  per  day  and \nminimum  nonfood  requirements.  This  poverty  line  approximates  PRs748.6  per  month  per  adult  in  FY2001 \n(Government of Pakistan. 2003. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Islamabad.)  \n\n2  The  income  calculations  are  based  on  (i)  figures  for  monthly  income  range  and  percentage  of  households  in  the \n\nHousehold Income and Expenditure Survey, 2001\u20132002; and (ii) Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n(vi) \n\nlink  the  center  of  Lahore  and  its  rapidly  developing  suburbs  with  fast  and \nconvenient access. \n\n \n13. \nThe  feasibility  study,  covering  5%  of  the  required  design  work,  outlines  an  integrated \nstrategic network of four lines of about 82 kilometers (km) long with 60 stations. The first phase \nwill address a 27 km priority line (the green line), which includes 11.6 km underground passing \nthrough  environmentally  sensitive  and  heritage  areas.  The  line  is  estimated  to  carry  about \n250,000\u2013300,000 passengers per day in the first year, 2013, providing direct walk-in access for \npassengers through 22 planned stations (12 underground and 10 elevated). The green line would \nprovide seamless connectivity to the city center for commuters from outside Lahore through two \nplanned  multimodal  terminals,  one  at  each  end.  Additionally,  the  line  is  planned  to  have  five \ninterchange stations with future lines. \n \nThe  ultimate  capacity  of  the  green  line  is  estimated  to  be  30,000  passengers  per  peak \n14. \nhour per direction. Initially, each train would comprise four cars, 48 meters long, doubling to a set \nof  eight-car  trains  in  later  years.  The  feasibility  study  estimates  the  cost  of  the  green  line  at  \n$2.4  billion;  this  estimate  is  being  confirmed  through  the  follow-on  reference  design  study,  and \nwill be further refined. A description of the proposed green line project is in Appendix 2. \n \n15. \nThe  Government  is  aware  that  passenger  fares  will  not  cover  the  full  cost  of  building, \nfinancing, operating, and maintaining the system; and that subsidies will be required to cover the \ndifference  between  project  costs  and  revenues  from  passenger  fares.  The  PPG,  building  on  its \npositive  experience  with  privately  operated  bus  services,  is  keen  to  use  PPP  arrangement  to \ndevelop the Lahore RMTS.  \n \nIn support of project development,  ADB retained a team of consultants to independently \n16. \nanalyze  the  economic  and  financial  feasibility  of  the  Lahore  RMTS,  and  to  identify  and  analyze \nvarious  PPP  arrangements  to  develop  this  system.3 The  results  from  the  options analysis study \nconfirm  that  the  Lahore  RMTS  is  economically  viable  according  to  ADB  standards,  at  an \neconomic internal rate of return of 11.40%, with a number of unquantified benefits. The economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  to  increase  to  12.34%  if  the  green  line  is  developed  with  an \nalternative  tunneling  technique,  and  with  a  few  other  less  significant  changes.  The  study  also \nfound that the green line would require a subsidy with a present value of $1.6 billion in order to be \nfinancially viable, with a total cost of $2.4 billion (since revised downward to $2.1 billion).  \n \n17. \nThe options analysis study team recommended a PPP structure in which the Government \nand a private concessionaire enter into two related contracts: (i) a design-build contract for civil \nworks,  and  (ii)  a  build-operate-transfer  contract  for  the  remainder  of  the  system.  Both  contracts \nwould be with the same private firm. In this structure, Government would raise the capital needed \nto pay for the civil works and the subsidy needed to cover the difference between the non-civil-\nwork cost of the RMTS and the revenue from passenger fares. The civil work payments would be \nmade  up-front,  but  the  subsidy  would  be  paid  over  time.  The  recommended  PPP  option \n(Appendix 3) optimizes the risks shared between the public and private sector. \n \n \n \n18. \nThe  TA  acknowledges  lessons  from  previous  ADB  and  other  development  partner \ninterventions in the urban sector in Pakistan, and aims to incorporate these into the transaction \ndesign, as well as any proposed follow-on investment. Since 1976, ADB has provided eight loans \nto  the  urban  sector,  totaling  about  $450  million.  Urban  loans  in  Pakistan  have  generally  been \nrated as unsatisfactory.   \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons from ADB Assistance  \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n3   Castalia. 2007. Lahore Rapid Mass Transit System\u2013Financial and Economic Analysis, and Analysis of Public-Private \n\nPartnership Options. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\n3. \n\nSummary of the Rationale \n\n19. \nADB\u2019s experience in Pakistan shows that successful implementation of inherently complex \nurban  sector  projects  demands  (i)  simple  project  design  and  execution  arrangements,  (ii)  close \ncoordination between the multiple agencies involved, (iii) development of institutional capacities, \nand  (iv)  generation  of  public  support  for  program  interventions  through  the  involvement  of \nstakeholders.  Urban  programs  also  need  to  address  (i)  delays  in  project  implementation, \nespecially at start-up; (ii) delays in land acquisition; (iii) the slow pace of government approvals; \n(iv) lack of timeliness and adequacy in the release of counterpart funds; (v) delays in selection of \nconsultants; and (vi) problems in achieving sustainability of project assets. \n \nThe TA design addresses these issues by (i) structuring the subsequent public investment \n20. \nprogram as  a multitranche financing facility; (ii) adopting a simple program design in one urban \nsubsector; (iii) linking physical projects to clear and well-focused sector reforms; and (iv) keeping \nexecution and implementation arrangements simple and embedded in existing institutions. \n \n21. \nOther  development  partners  have  been  active  in  the  urban  sector,  primarily  the  World \nBank.  Bilateral  assistance  has  been  provided  by  the  governments  of  Germany,  Kuwait, \nNetherlands,  Switzerland,  and  United  Kingdom.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme, \nUnited  Nations  Children's  Fund,  and  World  Health  Organization  have  also  provided  assistance, \nmostly  in  community  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects.  Details  on  external  assistance  in  the \nsector are provided in Appendix 4. \n \n \n \n22. \nThe  quality,  coverage,  and  reliability  of  infrastructure  and  services,  particularly  in  urban \ntransport, have not kept pace with the rapid growth of Lahore\u2019s economy and population in recent \nyears.  Insufficient  and  unreliable  infrastructure  and  services  are  (i)  adding  to  business  and \nhousehold costs, (ii) compromising Lahore\u2019s urban and natural environments, (iii) decreasing the \ncity\u2019s global competitiveness when compared with other South Asian cities, and (iv) diminishing \nthe quality of life of all of Lahore\u2019s citizens. \n \n23. \nTraditional  government  sources,  including  local  government  revenues,  subsidies,  and \ntransfers,  cannot  meet  the  growing  gap  between  urban  infrastructure  and  service  demand,  and \ncurrent  supply.  This  holds  particularly  true  for  development  of  a  major  mass  rail  transit  system. \nAlternative sources of financing and new ways of providing infrastructure and services, such as \nPPP,  are  required.  The  proposed  Lahore  RMTS,  to  be  developed  through  the  services  of  a \ntransaction advisor, would move the city squarely in this direction. \n \nThe TA and follow-on project processing will build on the work already undertaken by the \n24. \nPPG. PPG\u2019s urban unit has developed an urban sector road map, with the Lahore RMTS serving \nas  a  focus  for  investment.  The  road  map  (supplementary  appendixes)  provides  a  strategic \nframework for sector development, including a reform agenda and sector investment plan, from \nwhich an ADB-supported investment program is being derived. \n \n25. \nA  segregated  rapid  transit  system,  providing  fast  and  convenient  access  between  the \ncenter of Lahore and its rapidly developing suburbs, would offer numerous benefits. By providing \nan alternative to road-based transport, passengers will trade off the greater reliability and faster \njourney times offered against the premium fare charged. System benefits include \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nreduced road traffic and congestion,  \ndecreased pollution (by using electricity, which is cleaner and quieter),  \ntime savings to travelers, and  \nreduced bus and wagon flow at key points by 50% for certain segments.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n26. \nThe  Government  understands  that  developing  the  Lahore  RMTS  with  a  PPP  would \nprovide  an  opportunity  to  improve  the  overall  efficiency  of  the  system.  A  PPP  provides  the \nGovernment  with  an  opportunity  to  efficiently  allocate  risks  between  the  Government  and \nspecialized private firms. This means that risks will be controlled and influenced by the party that \nis best placed to control and influence these risks.  \n \n27. \nA  PPP,  however,  would  not  make  sense  for  the  Government  or  private  sector  if  either \nparty were bearing risks that are better handled by the other. This means that a well-structured \nPPP  is  essential  to  achieve  the  objectives  expected  from  a  PPP.  Examples  of  key  issues  that \nneed to be resolved as part of structuring a PPP transaction include the following: \n \n\nPublic  versus  private  funding. The passenger fares that the Government plans \nto  charge for  the  green line  will  not cover  the  full  cost  of  building, operating,  and \nmaintaining the line. The Government will need to subsidize a portion of the capital \ncosts. What portion would be funded by the Government, where would these funds \ncome from, and how would these funds be paid are key issues to be resolved. \n\nRidership  risk.  While  the  Government  should  bear  part  of  the  ridership  risk,  the \nprivate  operator  should  also  have  incentives  to  maximize  ridership.  Thus  the \nprivate operator should bear a portion of the ridership risk. What portion and under \nwhat terms are key issues to be resolved. \n\n \n28. \nTo  address  these  and  other  issues  that  will  emerge  during  implementation  of  the  green \nline,  the  Government  will  need  support  from  a  team  of  dedicated  and  specialized  consultants. \nMost of the consultants that the Government has recruited or plans to recruit are engineering or \nridership  forecasting  experts  who  will  provide  valuable  support  on  the  technical  aspects  of  the \nProject.  To  structure  a  successful  PPP  transaction,  however,  the  Government  will  need  the \nsupport  of  a  transaction  advisor  experienced  with  large-scale  and  complex  urban  transport \nprograms and international best practice in mass transit system financing and design. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n29. \nThe TA project will improve the urban rapid mass transportation network in Lahore. The \noutcome of the TA is a structured design for the Lahore RMTS Project feasible for ADB financing.  \n \nThe expected impact of the TA is the initiation of a long-term transport system investment \n30. \nprogram  that  will  enable  Lahore  to  make  a  greater  contribution  to  national  development,  while \nimproving the quality of life for city residents, including the poor. The RMTS is expected to \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nincrease commercial and residential development; \nminimize duplication and overlap on public transport routes; \nmaximize ridership through an integrated multimodal system; \noffer high service in terms of speed, frequency, and easy accessibility; \nreduce car and motorcycle dependency; \nprovide  safe,  secure,  environmentally  sustainable,  reliable,  and  dependable \ntransport that meets the needs and aspirations of this growing city; and \nlink the center of Lahore and its rapidly developing suburbs with fast, convenient \naccess. \n\n \n31. \nPrior  to  consideration  of  ADB  project  financing,  engagement  of  a  transaction  advisor  is \nrequired  to  formulate  financial  structuring,  undertake  detailed  due  diligence,  and  package  the \nLahore  RMTS  to  attract  private  capital  and  management.  The  transaction  advisor,  in  close \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nconsultation with ADB and the Government, will help prepare and launch a PPP transaction for \nthe green line. ADB is  willing, in principle, to partly finance the public-sector-financed portion of \nthe  Project  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  modality.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nthe transaction advisor are in Appendix 5. \n \nB. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nSequence of Major Tasks \n\n a. \n\nPhase I, Transaction Preparation  \n\n \n32. \nThe  transaction  advisory  work  will  be  carried  out  in  three  phases:  preparation, \nimplementation, and negotiation. During the preparation phase, the transaction advisor will carry \nout technical and legal due diligence, design the detailed structure and terms of the transaction, \nmarket  the  transaction  with  potential  investors,  and  develop  prequalification  and  bidding \ndocuments  as  well  as  the  necessary  contracts.  During  implementation,  the  transaction  advisor \nwill  assist  the  Government  in  obtaining  any  approvals  and  permits  required,  prequalifying \npotential investors, carrying out the bidding process, evaluating proposals, awarding the contract, \nand holding negotiations with lenders. During the negotiation, the transaction advisor will support \nthe Government and winning bidder reach financial closure.  \n \n \n \nThe  transaction  preparatory  work  will  include  technical,  legal,  regulatory,  financial,  and \n33. \nsafeguards due diligence in support of the proposed transaction. The transaction advisor will lead \nefforts  to  market  the  transaction,  including  tasks  such  as  (i)  preparation  of  initial  marketing \ndocument, an  information memorandum, and presentations; (ii) preparation of a list of investors \nthat  have  the  qualifications  and  experience  to  be  the  project  counterpart;  and  (iii)  consultations \nwith potential investors and lenders to share information about the Lahore RMTS. The transaction \nadvisor will also advise on progress made in preparing the transaction; and review feedback on \nthe design of the transaction. International road shows may be required. \n \n \n \n34. \nThe transaction advisor will assist the Government in obtaining or issuing the necessary \npermits or approvals needed for implementing the transaction for the Project. These might include \napproval  to  (i)  create  and  fund  a  subsidy  account,  (ii)  issue  a  government  guarantee,  and  \n(iii)  launch  prequalification  and  bidding  process.  The  transaction  advisor  will  assist  the \nGovernment in (i) issuing the request for prequalification, responding to questions from interested \nparties,  evaluating  the  expressions of  interest, and  selecting  a  short  list  of  firms;  (ii)  issuing  the \nrequest  for  proposals  and  responding  to  questions  from  bidders;  and  (iii)  assessing  the  legal \ncompliance  of \ntechnical  proposals  and \ncompetitiveness of the financial proposals, and making an award decision. \n \n\nPhase II, Transaction Implementation  \n\nthe  proposals,  evaluating \n\nthe  quality  of \n\nthe \n\n b. \n\nc. \n\nPhase III, Negotiations  \n\n \n35. \nFollowing  the  award  of  the  contract  to  a  bidder,  financial  closure  for  the  transaction  will \nrequire  several  months.  During  this  period,  the  transaction  advisor  will  assist  the  prospective \nlenders of the winning bidder in carrying out their credit analysis and, to the extent needed, assist \nthe Government in negotiating with these lenders. \n \nC. \n \n36. \nThe  TA  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $7.5  million  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange  costs  of  $6.0  million  and  local  currency  costs  of  $1.5  million  equivalent  (Table  1). \nDetailed costs estimates are in Appendix 6. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n\f7\n\nTable 1: Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \nA.

The loan will have a term of \n32 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft \nloan document. The Government will provide the remaining $1,500,000 equivalent, or 20% of the \ntotal  TA  cost,  to  cover  local  currency  costs.  As  most  of  these  funds  will  be  provided  in  kind  for \nprogram support in the form of workshops, surveys, office space, and related local support, the \navailability  of  counterpart  financing  should  not  be  an  issue.  The  Government  has  been  advised \nthat  approval  of  the  TA  loan  does  not  commit  ADB  to  financing  any  ensuing  project.  The \nGovernment  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  PPG  on  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to \nADB. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nPunjab Provincial Government \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n6.0 \n1.5 \n7.5 \n\nPercent \n80.0 \n20.0 \n100.0 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\n \nManagement  \n\n \n38. \nThe  Planning  &  Development  Board  (P&D  Board)  of  the  PPG  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency for the TA. With its capacity, mandate, and cadre of professional staff to provide strategic \nand  policy  guidance,  the  P&D  Board  will  be  a  powerful  champion  for  the  Lahore  RMTS.  It  will \nengage and oversee the transaction advice, and has agreed to assign a team of full-time staff to \nassist in implementing the TA. \n \n39. \nA project steering committee (PSC) for the Lahore RMTS, chaired by the PPG\u2019s chair of \nplanning  and  development,  was  formed  in  April  2005.  It  includes  the  secretaries  of  transport, \nfinance,  communication  and  works,  and  housing  and  urban  development;  nazim  (Lahore  city \nmayor); and district coordination officer of the city district government of Lahore. The secretary of \ntransport  acts  as  the  PSC  secretary.  The  PSC  provides  policy  support,  oversees  project \nprogress,  oversees  letting  and  supervision  of  contracts,  facilitates  coordination  and  cooperation \namong agencies concerned, and supervises the formulation and implementation of the integration \nstrategy.   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n40. \nThe  Transport  Department  (TD)  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  for  the  advisory \nservices, and the TD staff and executive staff of the utilities agencies will provide additional help \nas and when necessary. \n \n41. \nDuring the course of the TA, the Government will work on the institutional and regulatory \narrangements  required  to  implement  the  Lahore  RMTS,  including  integration  of  other  transport \nsystems.  Other  departments  will  have  key  roles;  effective  coordination  is  essential.  A  technical \ncoordinating  committee  will  coordinate  the  project  works,  traffic  and  access  arrangements,  and \nland requirements. A TA organization chart is in Appendix 7. \n \n\nThe TA is expected to be implemented over 1 year and 4 months, from April 2008 to July \n\n2.  \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n42. \n2009. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nA package of advisory services will be provided from a consulting firm with expertise and \n43. \nexperience in assessing, structuring, and raising finance on the capital markets for RMTSs in the \nAsia region. International and national consultants financed from ADB funds will be recruited as \nfirms under the quality-based selection method, using full technical proposals, in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The PSC will \nbe fully involved in the  selection process. Consulting services will include experts in the field  of \ntechnical  mass  transit  system  engineering,  design,  and  transport  mode  integration;  commercial \naspects; financial and economic analysis; legal and regulatory aspects; safeguards related to the \nenvironment,  resettlement,  and  social  development;  private  sector  participation  and  concession \nstructures; and institutional development and public finance. \n \n44. \nThe Government will take advance actions to expedite project implementation, particularly \nby short listing firms to provide consultancy services for transaction advice. The advance actions \nwill apply only until evaluation of bids. Contract award and signing of an agreement will take place \nonly  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  with \nadvance actions does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n4.  \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n \n45. \nTo  meet  its  accelerated  time  frame  for  implementing  the  Lahore  Rapid  Mass  Transit \nSystem Project, the Government is keen to commence recruitment of the transaction advisor as \nsoon  as  practicable.  The  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  approve,  in  principle,  advance \ncontracting  for  the  recruitment  of  consultant  advisory  services  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n\nAdvance  contracting  allows  the  Government  to  undertake  procurement  or  consultant \n46. \nselection  procedures  at  its  own  risk  prior  to  the  loan  becoming  effective.  The  Government  has \nopted for advance contracting without retroactive financing, in which case the consultant selection \nprocedures completed under advance contracting do not conclude with the award of contract until \nafter  the  loan  becomes  effective.  The  Government  and  PPG  acknowledge  that  they  undertake \nsuch  advance  contracting  at  their  own  risk,  and  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the \nprocedures, documentation, or proposal for award of contract does not commit ADB to approve \nthe TA loan or to finance recruitment costs.  \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n47. \nwith  the  Government  and  PPG.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the TA. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the TA shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine \nthe  records  and  accounts  of  the  PPG  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the TA. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n48. \nDisbursements under the TA loan will be made in the form of direct payments from ADB to \nthe international investment bank, based upon the payment schedule outlined in the final contract \nfor consultant services.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n49. \nTD will monitor TA progress to provide a basis for reporting to the Government and ADB, \nand  prepare  monthly  progress  reports  on  implementation.  The  reports  will  contain  sufficient \ninformation to enable the PSC to monitor progress, identify issues, and ensure compliance with \nthe TA objectives. The PSC will consolidate the monthly progress reports into quarterly reports for \nsubmission  to  ADB.  These  quarterly  reports  will  include  (i)  progress  made  against  established \ntargets, (ii) problems and issues encountered and remedial actions taken or proposed to resolve \nthe  issues,  and  (iii)  proposed  project  activities  to  be  undertaken  as  well  as  progress  expected \nduring  the  subsequent  implementation  period.  Each  report  will  also  contain  an  executive \nsummary with content and format that allows ADB to readily capture key information for use in TA \nperformance reports. The PSC will provide a TA completion report to ADB within 3 months of the \ncompleted  disbursement,  providing  details  about  project  implementation,  accomplishments, \ncosts, benefits, impacts, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n50. \nThe PSC and TD will monitor and evaluate TA project performance in accordance with the \nterms of reference and the design and monitoring framework. Primary monitoring targets for each \ncomponent will be agreed between the PSC and ADB;. The PSC and ADB will use these targets \nin accordance with the established reporting schedule. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n51. \nADB and the Government will jointly undertake inception, midterm, and final reviews of the \nTA project. The reviews will assess progress for each component, identify issues and constraints, \nand determine necessary remedial action and adjustments. The midterm review will (i) review the \nscope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  and  identify  adjustments  required;  (ii)  assess \nprogress of project implementation against performance indicators; and (iii) recommend changes \nin the design or implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n52. \nBeneficiaries.  The  Lahore  RMTS,  once  implemented,  would  benefit  large  numbers  of \npeople  day-in  and  day-out  in  Lahore.  Other  road  users  will  benefit  from  somewhat  reduced \ncongestion  and  pollution;  and  the  Government  will  benefit  from  policy  options  not  previously \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\navailable  that  will  accelerate  an  understanding  of  the  need  to  manage  public  transport  and  the \nurban transport system as a whole.  \n \n53. \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Social  Development  Impact. An urban rail system will impact \nLahore and its large population of poor residents in several positive ways. It will allow the city to \nfunction effectively even when congestion is severe, and allow people to commute to work. The \nadditional  capacity  provided  will  allow  the  dynamic  city  center  to  thrive  economically,  and  over \ntime  help  to  fundamentally  shift  the  structure  of  the  city,  and  guide  and  support  future \ndevelopment in a more balanced, sustainable manner. A summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 9. \n \n54. \nFinancial Benefits and Sustainability. The Lahore RMTS should be viewed in terms of \nits overall impacts\u2014on efficiency, city development, the environment (micro and macro), energy \nsavings, and cost to the Government. \n \n55. \nAssumptions. The transaction structure, led by a credible international investment bank, \nis  assumed  to  effectively  attract  sufficient  private  sector  interest.  Best  international  practice  for \nconcession structures is assumed to be appropriate and applicable to the Pakistan context. \n \n56. \nRisks. Major risks include capacity issues related to the ability of the Government to lead \nand implement the TA in a timely manner. Due diligence will assess safeguards, and both land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  could  be  substantial  under  the  larger  transaction.  Intensive \nconsultation  will  be  required  to  ensure  cooperation  from  civil  society  and  nongovernment \norganizations. The maintenance of political stability and security is assumed. \n    \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Safeguard  Issues.  The  TA  is  not  expected  to  have  any \n57. \nadverse  environmental  or  social  impacts.  It  will  ensure  development  of  an  environmentally  and \nsocially  viable  investment  program  through  an  intensive  due  diligence  process.  Any  follow-on \ninvestment  loan  will  be  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment \nrequirements,  social  safeguards  policies  (on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples), \nand  applicable  government  environment  laws  and  regulations.  The  establishment  of  the  overall \nRMTS will be compliant with the same requirements.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n58. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthat  adequate  environmental  measures \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure \nin \naccordance  with  ADB  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  applicable  government \nenvironment laws and regulations are incorporated into the design of the ensuing \nproject.  \nThe  Government  will  avoid  and  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \noccurring  under  any  follow-on  loans  and  the  establishment  of  the  RMTS.

The  total  length  of  the  line  will  be  27  kilometers,  15.4  of  which  are  elevated  and  11.6 \nunderground. The green line will have an underground section in the city center because of tight \ncurves and narrow streets, and restrictions and preservation considerations. This will also reduce \nthe environmental impact of the Project.  \n \n2. \nThe green line follows the Ferozepur Road corridor. In the south, it begins just north of the \nHudiara  drain  road  bridge.  The  southern-most  station  is  Hamza  Town.  The  alignment  reference \npoint (Chainage 0+000) is taken from the end of the lead track about 300 meters south of Hamza \nTown. The northern-most station is across Ravi River in Shahdara Town.  \n \nFrom  the  Hamza  Town  station,  the  alignment  follows  Ferozepur  Road  on  an  elevated \n3. \nviaduct structure (single track U girder) in the road\u2019s central median, up to the Pakistan Railway \nflyover. Here the green line is diverted on one side. It returns to the central median north of the \nrailway flyover up to the model town north, where it descends into a tunnel via a ramp and follows \nthe middle of Ferozepur Road; it is then diverted to the west. The bored tunnel alignment follows \nthe central median of Ferozepur Road, crossing the interchange with Gulberg Main Boulevard and \nthe canal. North of the canal, the alignment returns to the centerline of Ferozepur Road up to the \nQurtaba  junction,  where  a  sharp  right  turn  is  required  to  follow  Fatima  Jinnah  Road.  As  it \napproaches  the  assembly  building,  the  tunnel  alignment  turns  sharply  to  the  left  toward  Mall \nRoad. The tunnel alignment then proceeds along Mall Road to the junction close to Nasir Bagh. \nHere, the alignment turns sharply right onto the Lower Mall and proceeds to Circular Road (west \nsection). It then ascends back to the viaduct in the middle of Ravi Road after Data Darbar Station. \nFrom Ravi Road, the route crosses Bund Road and Ravi River to the northern end at Chainage \n26+721 about 500 meters north of the northern terminal station in Shahdara Town.  \n \n4. \nStations will be spaced approximately 1 kilometer apart throughout the central section of \nthe line. Stations are designed for compliance with National Fire Protection Association Code 130: \nStandard for Fixed Guideway Transit and Passenger Rail Systems (2007), with the forecast peak \nnumbers  of  passengers  boarding  and  alighting  at  each  location.  Station  platforms  are  provided \nwith platform screen doors. Underground stations are air-conditioned. Escalators are provided to \nimprove vertical circulation and user accessibility. The station entrances will be integrated with the \nbus  stops  located  on  the  roads  nearby.  Also,  a  link  (tunnel  or  footbridge)  will  be  provided  for \npedestrians to cross the road.   \n \nA  medium  capacity  mass  transit  train  is  proposed.  Ultimately,  the  train  will  comprise  six \n5. \ncars  articulated  and  connected.  For  the  early  stage,  the  trains  will  comprise  only  three  to  four \ncars.  As  demand  grows,  the  length  of  the  trains  will  be  doubled.  At  102  meters  long,  station \nplatforms  are  designed  to  accommodate  the  six-car  train  that  will  be  used  in  later  years.  The \nultimate capacity of the train will be 1,040 passengers. \n \n6. \nRound-trip time is estimated at about 86 minutes, and a minimum headway of 2 minutes is \nassumed for ultimate peak hour provision. This is calculated to require 46 trains to provide peak \nhour  service,  and  assumes  a  requirement  of  one  spare  train  for  operation  reserve  and  seven \nspare trains for maintenance reserve, giving a total ultimate requirement of 54 trains (324 cars). \n \n7. \nThe earliest that the green line can be open to the public is late 2012, providing that initial \nconstruction  begins  during  the  first  quarter  of  2008.  Ultimately,  demand  for  the  proposed  green \nline is estimated to be 30,000 passengers per peak hour per direction.  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRECOMMENDED PRIVATE-PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP OPTION \n\n \n \n1. \nThe options analysis study team reviewed international best practice, and developed the \nfollowing  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  options  for  consideration.  The  PPP  option  will  be \nadopted following assessment and validation by the transaction advisor. \n \n\nOption one. A build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract with a private firm. \n\nOption  two.  A  design-build  contract  for  civil  works  and  a  BOT  contract  for  the \nremainder of the Project with one private firm. In this option, the Punjab provincial \ngovernment (PPG) finances the cost of the civil works. \n\nOption  three.  A  design-build  contract  for  civil  works,  a  contract  to  supply  and \ncommission  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment,  and  an  operation  and \nmaintenance contract, with one private firm. In this option, the PPG finances all \ncapital costs. \n\nOption  four.  An  engineering  and  construction  contract  for  civil  works  with  one \nfirm,  and  a  contract  for  the  supply  and  commissioning  of  electrical  and \nmechanical equipment and an operation and maintenance contract with a second \nfirm. In this option, the PPG finances all capital costs. \n\nOption  five.  An  engineering  and  construction  contract  for  civil  works  with  one \nfirm,  and  a  concession  contract  for  the  remainder  of  the  Project  with  a  second \nfirm. In this option, the PPG finances the cost of the civil works. \n\n \n2. \nBased on current understandings as described in this report of the PPG\u2019s objectives and \ntheir relative importance, the PPG may be better off adopting a PPP structure similar to option \ntwo. In this option, the PPG and a private concessionaire enter into a design-build contract for \ncivil works and a BOT for the remainder of the Project. The PPG raises the capital needed to \npay for the civil works, as well as to pay for the subsidy needed to cover the difference between \nthe non-civil-work costs of the Project and the revenues from fares paid by passengers. The civil \nwork payments will be made up-front, but the subsidy will be paid over time. If the PPG wishes \nto, this option could be altered to have the subsidy paid upfront.  \n \n3. \nfor the Manila Light Rail Transit 1 extension. \n \n\nFigure A3 presents the structure of PPP option two.

The  PPG  secures  financing  for  the  civil  works  portion  of  the  Project. \nDuring  construction  of  civil  works,  the  PPG  pays  the  concessionaire  based  on  construction \nmilestones reached, as under a conventional construction contract.  \n \n5. \nThe  concessionaire  may  subcontract  this  work  to  a  specialized  firm  through  an \nengineering, procurement, and construction contract. The subcontract would contain the same \ntypes  of  provisions  described  in  option  one,  i.e.,  deadlines  with  corresponding  penalties  and \nspecifications  to  ensure  quality.  The  concessionaire  mitigates  construction  risk  through  this \nsubcontracting  arrangement  by  transferring  it  to  a  firm  with  specialized  knowledge  of  how  to \nbest manage it. \n \n6. \nA  BOT  contract  would  cover  all  aspects  of  the  Project:  civil  works,  supply  and \ncommissioning  of  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment  (including  rolling  stock),  and  operation \nand maintenance of the system. The contract scope is essentially the same as the BOT contract \nin  option  one,  without  the  civil  works  component.  The  concessionaire  will  secure  private \nfinancing  for  the  electrical  and  mechanical  (E&M)  and  rolling  stock  capital  costs.  Its \nshareholders will provide equity for approximately 20%\u201330% of the costs. To mitigate operating \nrisk and risks related to finishing construction of the system, the concessionaire may enter into a \nsubcontract  with  a  firm  to  supply  and  commission  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment,  and \noperate and maintain the system.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPassenger fares are not sufficient to cover the full cost of service. As discussed in the \n7. \ndescription of option one in the study, several mechanisms will be needed to make the Project \nattractive to the private sector and bankable: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\na subsidy per passenger (for options one, two, and five); \na minimum revenue or minimum ridership guarantee; and  \na  guarantee  of  the  PPG\u2019s  obligations  from  a  third  party,  or  a  fiduciary  fund  to \ncover the cost of its obligations. \n\n \nThe net present value of the PPG\u2019s subsidy in this case, including financing the capital costs of \nthe civil works, is approximately $1.6 billion. \n \nThe  allocation  of  risks  in  this  option  is  similar  to  their  allocation  in  option  one,  with  the \n8. \ndifference that the PPG bears risks related to financing of civil works. The PPG also bears risks \nrelated  to  obtaining  right-of-way.  The  concessionaire  bears  risks  related  to  construction, \nfinancing of electrical and mechanical equipment, and operation and maintenance. The parties \nshare ridership risk through the guarantee mechanism. \n \n9. \nThe PPG will retain the services of a transaction advisor to help the PPG move forward \nwith  selecting  an  appropriate  PPP  option,  and  with  preparing  the  documentation  for  procuring \nthis PPP option. The terms of reference of the transaction advisor include a set of tasks that will \nhelp the PPG to reach a decision on an appropriate PPP option. These tasks include \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nreviewing  and  prioritizing  with  the  PPG  the  importance  of  the  objectives  and \ndesign considerations set out in the Castalia report;1  \ncarrying out the technical and legal due diligence for the Project; \nreviewing the PPP options presented in this report, and suggesting any changes \nthat are necessary as a result of the due diligence findings; and \ndeveloping  a  financial  model  that  can  be  used  to  quantify  the  subsidy  required \nfrom  the  PPG,  as  well  as  the  value  of  the  contingent  liabilities  associated  with \nvarious forms of guarantees. \n\n                                                 \n1   Castalia.  2007.

Despite a number of initiatives, such as introducing fleets of buses, \nthe  problems  of  gridlock  and  congestion  have  grown  to  the  point  of  constraining  growth, \ncurtailing investment, and reducing the city\u2019s competitiveness. \n \nTo  resolve  this  serious  transport  issue,  during  the  early  1990s  the  Japanese \n2. \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency \nthe \ntransportation  system  in  Lahore.  The  study  identified  and  analyzed  several  mass  rapid  transit \nsolutions,  and  concluded  that  a  light  rail  train  system  along  the  Ferozepur  Road  would  be  a \nfeasible  solution.  Subsequently,  in  1993  the  World  Bank  funded  the  Lahore  Traffic  and \nTransport  Studies,  which  essentially  reviewed  and  updated  the  earlier  JICA-funded  work.  In \n2005,  the  Punjab  provincial  government  (PPG)  retained  MVA  Asia  Limited  to  analyze  in  more \ndetail the feasibility of the light rail train system along the priority corridor proposed by the JICA \nstudy (green line). This work was concluded in August 2006 and included1 \n \n\n(JICA)  sponsored  a  comprehensive  study  of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\na  review  of  available  data  and  conduct  of  citywide  travel  demand  surveys, \ngeotechnical investigations, and a topographic survey of the priority corridor; and \na design for the alignments, stations, systems, and operations for the green line \nto a 5% level of detail. \n\n \n3. \nIn  2006,  the  PPG  again  retained  MVA  Asia  Limited  to  analyze  the  feasibility  of  the \nsecond  priority  line  (orange  line).  This  report  is  complete.  The  green  and  orange  lines  will \noverlap  at  one  station,  therefore  the  future  development  of  the  orange  line  will  likely  have  a \nmaterial impact on ridership of the green line.  \n \n4. \nIn 2007, the PPG decided to take the green line feasibility study to a higher level of detail \nbe retaining Systra, the parent company of MVA Asia Limited, to carry out the reference design \nof the green line. The key output of this work is the design of alignments, stations, systems, and \noperations for the green line to a 35% level of detail.2  \n \n5. \nIn 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), as part of its due diligence for the green \nline  and  anticipating a  possible lending  operation,  commissioned  a  group  of  individual  experts \n(the  ADB  consultants)  to  review  the  MVA  Asia  Limited  ridership  forecasts  and  cost  estimates \nand  analyze  the  economic  and  financial  viability  of  the  line.  This  work  included  identifying \nvarious public-private partnership (PPP) options that the PPG could consider for developing the \ngreen line.3 \n \n5. \nThe development of the green line is a priority project for the PPG. The Government is \nwell aware that passenger fares will pay will not be sufficient to cover the cost of developing the \nProject, and in particular, the capital costs. Despite being financially unviable, the Government \nis  committed  to  implementing  the  Project  because  the  Government  expects  it  to  revolutionize \nthe  city  and  eventually  add  value  to  the  local  economy.  Evidence  of  this  commitment  is  the \n\n                                                 \n1   The final report prepared by MVA Asia Limited is available for consultation. \n2   The terms of reference for Systra\u2019s work are available for consultation. \n3   The results of this work are available for consultation. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n21 \n\nallocation in the province\u2019s development budget of around $500 million per year for the next 5 \nyears to cover the funds needed to make the Project financially viable. \n \n6. \nThe  Government  has  had  positive  experiences  with  PPPs  in  other  provincial  projects, \nand  in  particular,  with  intra-  and  intercity  bus  services.  As  a  result,  the  Government  wants  to \ndevelop the green line under a PPP arrangement. The Government agrees in principle with the \nPPP structure recommendations made by the ADB consultants.  \n \nTo  prepare  and  implement  the  PPP  transaction  for  developing  the  green  line,  the \n7. \nGovernment wishes to engage the services of a transaction advisor. This document outlines the \nterms of reference for this advisor. \n \nThe  work  of  the  transaction  advisor  will  be  facilitated  by  the  significant  work  already \n8. \ncompleted  on  the  feasibility  and  engineering  aspects  of  the  green  line,  as  well  as  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s strong commitment to implementing the green line. \n \nA. \n \n9. \nThe  transaction  advisory  work  will  be  carried  out  in  three  phases:  preparation, \nimplementation,  and  negotiation.  During  the  preparation  phase,  the  transaction  advisor  will  \n(i) carry out technical and legal due diligence, (ii) design the detailed structure and terms of the \ntransaction, (iii) market the transaction with potential investors, and (iv) develop prequalification \nand  bidding  documents  as  well  as  the  necessary  contracts.  During  implementation,  the \ntransaction  advisor  will  assist  the  PPG  in  obtaining  any  approvals  and  permits  required, \nprequalifying  potential  investors,  carrying  out  the  bidding  process,  evaluating  proposals, \nawarding  the  contract,  and  holding  negotiations  with  lenders.  During  negotiation  phase,  the \ntransaction advisor will support the PPG to reach financial closure.  \n \n\nScope of Work \n\n1. \n\nPhase I, Transaction Preparation  \n\nThe preparatory work will include technical, legal, regulatory, and financial inputs.  \n\na. \n\nTechnical \n\n \n10. \n \n\n \n11. \nfollowing areas. \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  services  to  be  provided  by  the  consultants  will  cover,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the \n\nCarry  out  technical  due  diligence.

This  involves  reviewing  experience  of  other \nmass  rapid  transit  systems  with  specific  commercial  services  or  activities  that \nhave generated revenue, assessing the extent to which commercial services and \nrevenue-generating  activities  can  be  replicated  in  Lahore,  and  forecasting  the \nrevenue that could be expected from those that can be replicated in Lahore. This \nwork  will  include  field  research  and  surveys  to  be  carried  out  by  a  commercial \nreal estate expert. \nReview and update the project implementation schedule, including expected time \nfor  obtaining  rights-of-way,  obtaining  permits,  completing  other  preconstruction \nwork, construction, testing, and commissioning.  \nReview  and  update  technical  inputs  needed  for  the  financial  model,  such  as \nbreakdown  of  capital  costs,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  passenger  and \nnonpassenger revenue, and other related items. \n\n(v)  Write the technical sections of the information memorandum.

Following the award of the contract to a bidder, financial closure \nfor the Project will require several months. During this period, the transaction advisor will assist \nthe  prospective  lenders  of  the  winning  bidder  in  carrying  out  their  credit  analysis,  and  to  the \nextent needed, assist the PPG in negotiating with these lenders. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe work in phase I will be carried out over 4 months from the date the contract with the \ntransaction advisor becomes effective. The work in phase II will be completed within 8 months \nfrom  the  date  the  contract  with  the  transaction  advisor  becomes  effective.  The  duration  of  the \nwork in phase III will depend on the duration of the negotiations.  \n \nC. \n \nThe remuneration of the transaction advisor will comprise a fixed fee and a success fee. \n18. \nThe  fixed  fee  will  have  two  components:  a  monthly  retainer  fee  and  a  total  milestone-based \npayment. \n \n19. \nThis fee will be calculated as \n \n\nIn  their  financial  proposals,  bidders  must  indicate  the  fixed  fee  they  intend  to  charge. \n\nRemuneration \n\nFixed fee = Monthly retainer x 12 + Total milestone-based payment \n\n \n20. \nThe total milestone-based payment will be equal or greater than two thirds of the fixed \nfee.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBased  on  the  country  poverty  assessment,  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  the  sector  analysis,  describe  how  the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of \nthe partner country. \n \nThe  proposed  follow-on  investment  program  in  urban  transport  for  the  Lahore  rapid  mass  transit  system  (RMTS)  and \ninstitutional  reform  of  public  service  provision  are  consistent  with  the  goals  and  strategies  of  the  poverty  reduction \napproach of the Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Povery Reduction Strategy Paper \nstresses, among others, access to public services, improved governance, job creation, and community participation as key \ndevelopment  needs  and  priorities  of  the  poor.  Insufficient  economic  growth  and  employment,  gender  disparities,  and \ninadequate  community  empowerment  are  observed  to  be  among  the  main  causes  of  poverty.  In  response,  aims  of  the \npoverty  reduction  strategy  include  the  development  of  supportive  infrastructure  for  accelerating  economic  growth,  civil \nservice  reforms,  as  well  as  improved  governance  and  public  service  delivery.  Social  mobilization  and  community \nparticipation  are  viewed  as  essential  for  improved  governance  and  ownership  of  poverty  reduction  programs  by \nbeneficiary communities. Sustainable pro-poor growth, devolution of power to local communities, development of public-\nprivate partnerships (PPP) in infrastructure provision including the development of transport systems, and mainstreaming \nof environmental issues are among the investment priorities of the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement between the \nGovernment and ADB. \nIn its medium-term development framework, the Government committed to enhance the competitiveness of, and quality of \nlife in, its large cities. The Government constituted a high-level committee led by the Planning Commission to coordinate \ndevelopment of its megacities, including Lahore. Vision 2020 for Pakistan highlights the vital role to be played by the urban \nsector  in  realizing  national  development  goals.  Improved  transport  through  the  Lahore  rapid  mass  transit  system  will \nenhance public safety and the quality of the urban environment, and specifically provide opportunities for women to travel \nfor  health,  education,  and  employment.  Women  are  socially  discouraged  from  traveling  on  the  existing  public  transport \nsystem  given  its  dilapidated  and  gender  insensitive  state.  The  Project  supports the  poverty  reduction  strategy  by \npromoting institutional reform and organizational development to encourage pro-poor development and fiscal responsibility \namong providers of public infrastructure services. It will improve governance and the participation of the poor by consulting \nstakeholders, including low income communities, on the Project through public awareness and outreach. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \nNational, Provincial, and Local Poverty Context: \nPoverty in Pakistan declined from 34.5% in 2001 to 23.9% in 2005 in the wake of overall economic growth and increased \npro-poor government spending. However, at the same time, the income and expenditure gaps between the poor and the \nwealthier, especially the urban rich, have widened considerably. Seventy percent of the population remains vulnerable to \npoverty  in  the  long  term.  The  poor  tend  to  have  larger  households  and  less  access  to  essential  assets  and  services, \nincluding electricity, water supply and sanitation, cooking gas, and telephones. The incidence of poverty is highest among \nthe employment groups of wage laborers, sharecroppers, and the self-employed; and among the occupational groups of \nunskilled  wage  laborers,  and  skilled  and  craft  workers.  It  is  highest  in  the  agriculture,  construction,  transport,  and \nmanufacturing sectors. Poverty is clearly associated with landlessness and smallness of landholdings; as well as lack of \nliteracy and educational attainment.  \n \nOnly scant disaggregated data is available on the status of poverty for the city district of Lahore. Approximately 30% of the \ntotal population of 7 million lives below or at the poverty line. And about 30% of the population live in the more than 300 \nkatchi  abadis  (informally  developed  and  poor  settlements  and  homes.  The  majority  of  katchi  abadis  inhabitants  receive \ninferior  public  services.  Generally,  poverty  in  the  city  is  characterized  by  a  lack  of  reliable  employment,  insufficient  and \nirregular  income,  limited  access  to  quality  and  higher  education  and  health  care,  deficient  basic  infrastructure  and \nservices, and a lack of secure ownership or tenure of housing.  \n \nSupport of a new rapid mass transit system that links a network of feeder busses, serving all of the city\u2019s townships and \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n31 \n\ninner  city,  will  facilitate  safer,  faster,  and  more  comfortable  transport  for  all  sectors  of  the  city  population,  including  the \nresidents of the katchi abadis, and reduce severe traffic jams and air pollution.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.   Findings of Social Analysis \n \nA stakeholder analysis is being carried out by the reference design team and will run in parallel to the proposed technical \nassistance  (TA)  loan.  This  effort  is  complemented  by  two  stakeholder  engagements  carried  out  as  part  of  the  ongoing \ncommunications  strategy  of  the  Punjab  provincial  government  (PPG).  Other  workshops  are  planned  over  the  near-term \nunder  the  reference  design  team.  These  workshops  target  beneficiaries,  the  private  sector,  the  executing  agency, \nimplementing  agencies,  concerned  government  departments,  civil  society  representatives,  and  nongovernment \norganizations. Following these activities, ADB project processing for the subsequent loan program  will undertake further \nstakeholder analysis and outreach.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.   Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nStakeholder  consultations  are  being  conducted  by  the  reference  design  team,  and  a  participation  strategy  is  being \ndesigned  as  part  of  its  outreach  component.  Key  stakeholders  include  government  and  civil  society  organizations,  user \ngroups,  nongovernment  organizations,  media,  academia,  and  representatives  of  program  beneficiaries  and  affected \npeople. The outcomes of these meetings are providing feedback to the project designers, and will be incorporated in the \nfinal project design. The meetings and outreach program are also facilitating public support for the Project through active \ninvolvement  of  stakeholders.  The  participation  strategy  will  be  elaborated  as  project  processing  for  the  follow-on  loan \nprogram is undertaken \n \n2.   What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.   Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nThe process is ongoing and will be addressed during project preparation of the ensuing multitranche financing facility loan. \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.   Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe  ensuing  investment  loan  will  directly  and  indirectly  benefit  women  through  better  access  to  reliable,  safe,  and \naccessible urban transport. The primary concerns of women need to be addressed in the program design (road map) and \nwill be part of the consultative process, which should specifically target women\u2019s participation in design and monitoring of \nimplementation of the Project. The severe shortage of adequate transport and harassment of women in public and private \nbuses will be addressed in the design and implementation of the RMTS and feeder bus system, with special attention to \naffordable  rates,  seats  for  women,  and  preventive  measures  to  deal  with  physical  harassment.  ADB\u2019s  investment  to \naddress these service delivery and infrastructure needs is critical to reducing women\u2019s time spent on such issues and thus \nfreeing time for engagement in income generating activities or leisure and family time. In the provision of project-generated \nemployment to the poor, women will be targeted and equal pay will be provided for work of equal value.  \n2.  Key  Actions.
