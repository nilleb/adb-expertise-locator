An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been \nundertaken and the summary IEE is a supplementary appendix. \n \nThe  project    activities  will  cover  four  components.  The  first  is \ncapacity  building  of  a  wheat-breeding  institute  and  crop  variety \ntesting  agency.  The  component  will  aim  at  accelerating  the \nrelease of new wheat varieties that are better suited for cultivation \nin Uzbekistan. The second will build the capacity of rural business \nadvisory  centers  (RBACs)  and  selected  research  institutes  to \npromote  adoption  of  new  wheat  varieties  and  improve  farming \npractices,  particularly  in  crop  rotation  and  on-farm  soil  and  water \nmanagement.  The  third  will  provide  credit  funds  and  capacity-\nbuilding assistance for private enterprises that will produce wheat \nseeds  and  provide  farm  support  services  (farm  input  retailing, \nmachinery  rental,  and  agroprocessing  services).  The  fourth  will \nsupport coordination of project activities and impact monitoring. \n \nThe first and second components will cover five wheat-producing \nprovinces  of  Tashkent,  Syrdarya,  Djizak,  Samarkand,  and \nKaskadarya in central Uzbekistan. Limited irrigation facility repairs \nunder  the  second  component  and  enterprise  development  under \nthe  third  component  will  be  carried  out  in  three  focus  districts  of \nKuyi-Chirchik,  Zamin,  and  Katakurgan  in  Tashkent,  Djizak,  and \nSamarkand provinces, respectively. \n \nThe  Project  will  also  facilitate  policy  dialogue  and  monitoring  to \ndeepen reforms in the agriculture sector, including reduction of the \nmandatory  volumes  of  wheat  and  wheat  seeds  that  farms  are \nrequired to sell to the state in the focus districts. Complementing \nthe reduction of the public sector\u2019s purchases of wheat and wheat \nseeds, the Project will facilitate private sector participation in seed \nproduction,  provision  of  farm  inputs,  and  product  processing  and \nmarketing.  Reforms  introduced  in  the  three  districts  will  be \nexpanded nationwide in a phased manner. \n \nTo  secure  wheat  supply,  Uzbekistan\u2014a  remote  landlocked \ncountry  with  limited  physical  access  to  international  markets\u2014\nraised  wheat  output  from  0.6  million  to  4.7  million  tons  in  1993\u2013\n2002.  With  a  domestic  requirement  of  about  4.5  million  tons,  the \ncountry is self-sufficient in wheat. Despite the gains in output, the \nwheat subsector and the agriculture sector, in general, are facing \nkey challenges. First, aggregate wheat output is prone to sudden \ndrops  because  the  wheat  varieties  cultivated  in  Uzbekistan  are \n\n\fiv \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nsusceptible  to  local  pests/diseases  and  not  adapted  to  the  local \nclimate.  Second,  the  increase  in  wheat  production  has  relied \nexcessively  on  wheat  planting  in  fertile  and  well-irrigated  lands, \nrestricting  the  available  land  for  cultivation  of  higher-value  crops. \nRigid state control over cropping patterns and marketing has also \nconstrained farm income growth.  \n \nTo  address  these  challenges,  and  increase  farm  income  and \nensure  food  security,  Uzbekistan  needs  to  rationalize  its  wheat \nproduction,  particularly  to  minimize  wheat  cultivation  where \nhigher-value  crops  can  be  grown.  Investments  should  also  be \nmade to stabilize and improve wheat yields, especially in the less \nirrigable  and  rain-fed  areas.  Three  critical  interventions  are \nneeded:  (i)  accelerate \nintroduction  of  wheat  varieties \nadaptable to local conditions, (ii) support agricultural extension to \nintroduce  sustainable  and  more  profitable  farm  practices  and \ntechnologies for wheat cultivation, and (iii) improve farm access to \nagricultural \nsupply  of \nagrochemicals, farm machinery, and agroprocessing services. \n \nThe  project  objective  is  to  promote  economical  and  sustainable \nsystems of wheat production. Achievement of the project objective \nwill contribute to the realization of the project goal to improve farm \nincome. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $40.0  million  equivalent, \ncomposed of $23.4 million in foreign exchange and $16.6  million \nequivalent in local currency. The cost estimates include taxes and \nduties amounting to $2.3 million. \n \n\nservices, \n\nincluding \n\nsupport \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n$ million equivalent\n\nSource  \n  \n\n Foreign \nExchange  Currency \n\n Local \n\nTotal   Percent \n Cost \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \n               Total \n \n \n\n23.4 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n23.4 \n\n2.6 \n10.6 \n3.4 \n16.6 \n\n26.0 \n10.6 \n3.4 \n40.0 \n\n65\n26 \n9 \n100 \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $26.0  million  from  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility; a commitment fee of 0.75% per annum; a front-end \nfee of 0.50% of the loan amount; conversion options that may be \nexercised  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Loan  Agreement, \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Regulations,  and  Conversion  Guidelines;  and  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nv \n\nFor  the  Project\u2019s  agricultural  enterprise  development  component, \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF), on behalf of the Borrower, will on-\nlend  $10.1  million  of  the  loan  proceeds  to  private  companies \nproviding diversified services to farms and producing wheat seed \nin  the  three  project  districts.  The  subsidiary  loans  will  be \nchanneled  through  a  maximum  of  two  participating  finance \ninstitutions  (PFIs)  to  be  identified  during  the  first  year  of  project \nimplementation,  based  on  criteria  agreed  on  between  ADB  and \nthe  Borrower.  Subsidiary  loans  from  MOF  to  PFIs  will  be  for  10 \nyears, including a 4-year grace period. Subloans from PFIs to the \nenterprises  will  be  for  10  years,  including  a  3-year  grace  period. \nReal  market  interest  will  be  applied  to  the  subloans,  taking  into \naccount  the  cost  of  administering  the  subloans,  credit  risk,  and \nreasonable amount of profit for PFIs. Commitment fees of ADB to \nMOF will be passed on to PFIs, which will bear the subloan credit \nrisks. Foreign exchange risk will be passed on to the enterprises. \n \n31 March 2009 \n \n31 December 2008 \n\n \nA project steering committee, headed by a deputy prime minister \nand  comprising  senior  government  staff,  will  be  established  to \nguide  project  implementation  and  monitor  project  development \nimpacts.  The  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  (RRA),  under  the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources,  will  execute  the \nProject. A project management office (PMO) has been established \nwithin RRA to manage the day-to-day project implementation, with \nproject  site  offices  (PSOs)  to  be  established  in  the  three  project \ndistricts  to  supervise  field  activities.  PMO,  PSOs,  and  district \ngovernments will work with the beneficiaries, wheat-breeding and \nagricultural research institutes, RBACs, and private enterprises. \n \nRural Restructuring Agency \n \nThe  Project  will  procure  farm  machinery,  research  and  office \nequipment,  vehicles,  materials,  and  civil  works  services.  All \nprocurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  under  Asian  Development  Bank \nLoans.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  subloans \nmade  out  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  carried  out  by  private \nenterprises.  The  subborrowers  need  to  demonstrate  that  their \nprocurement  procedures  are  transparent,  efficient,  and  conform \nwith ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. \n \nThe Project will provide 31 person-months of international and 42 \nperson-months of domestic consultant services. The international \nconsultants will help (i) administer the Project, (ii) evaluate project \nimpacts, (iii) upgrade wheat plant breeding and variety testing, (iv) \nthe \ndevelop  effective  extension  services,  and  (v)  evaluate \n\n\fvi \n\n \n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nsuitability  of  candidate  financial  institutions  to  take  part  in  the \nProject.  Domestic  consultants  will  help  organize  water  users \nassociations to strengthen irrigation operation and maintenance in \nthe project areas. Domestic consultants will also support capacity \nbuilding  in  extension  service,  project  impact  evaluation,  and \nevaluation of finance institutions. The engagement of consultants \nwill  conform  to  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers  and  other  arrangements \nacceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \nThe Project is expected to benefit 217,000 families in the project \narea,  most  of  whom  work  on  the  private  and  cooperative  farms \nand cultivate wheat on household plots. The Project is expected to \nincrease  average  wheat  yields  of  irrigated  farming  systems  from \n2.4 to 2.7 tons (t) per hectare (ha), and rain-fed wheat yield from \n0.6 to 1.0 t/ha in 7 years. In the three pilot districts, farm income is \nexpected to increase by 31-60% by 2008. Introduction of drought-\ntolerant  and  early  maturing  wheat  varieties,  combined  with \nenhanced soil fertility management in the dry areas, will increase \nyields, which, in turn, will increase demand for labor, particularly of \nwomen  and  young  adults.  Enhanced  farm  income  will  improve \ncommunities\u2019  access  to  social  and  health  services  and  improve \nliving  conditions.  In  the  project  districts,  crop  price  reforms, \nstrengthened rural business advisory services, and private sector \nentry  into  agricultural  support  services  will  yield  robust  and \nsustainable growth in farm profits. The Project\u2019s economic internal \nrate of return is estimated at 31%. \n \nAn advisory technical assistance (TA) grant will (i) support private \nsector  entry  and  operations  in  seed  production  and  provision  of \nagricultural  support  services  in  the  three  project  districts,  and  (ii) \nassist the Government in reviewing its food security strategy. The \nTA  will  help  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  competitive  private \nbusiness  operations  in  agriculture.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost \n$600,000  equivalent,  of  which  $400,000  equivalent  will  be \nfinanced  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund. \nThe TA will provide services of 12 person-months of international \nand 15 person-months of domestic consultant inputs. \n \n\n\fv\n\ni\ni\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Grain  Productivity  Improvement  Project.  The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for furthering reform in the grain sector, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA.1  \n \n\nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Performance, Indicators, and Analysis \n\nCrops  comprise  60%  of  the  value  of  agricultural  output  of  Uzbekistan,  with  cotton  and \n2. \nwheat  as  two  major  crop  commodities.  Cultivable  land  represents  about  10%  of  the  total  land \narea, or 4.4 million hectares (ha), of which 3.7 million ha are irrigated, and the remaining, rain-\nfed.  Some  16  million  ha  are  grassland,  which  supports  livestock  production.  Much  agricultural \nproduction is concentrated in the irrigated areas of the central and eastern parts of the country. \nCultivable rain-fed areas are mostly used for grain production. About 56% of the country\u2019s 25.6 \nmillion  people  live  in  rural  areas.  Agriculture  accounts  for  about  28%  of  the  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP), 44% of employment, and 60% of export revenues.  \n \n3. \nUnder the former Soviet Union (FSU), Uzbekistan was a designated producer of cotton, \nwith  70\u201380%  of  the  total  irrigated  land  devoted  to  the  crop.  Fodder  crops  (alfalfa,  rye,  barley, \nand  maize),  which  were  grown  in  rotation  with  cotton,  supported  limited  livestock  production. \nProduction  of  staple  crops,  such  as  wheat  and  potatoes,  was  discouraged.  Areas  planted  to \nfruits  and  vegetables  were  constantly  reduced.  Before  1991,  Uzbekistan  produced  less  than \n20% of the wheat it consumed, and the rural areas suffered food shortages. Wheat on average \naccounts  for  85%  of  household  consumption  of  staple  foods  in  Uzbekistan,2  which  comprise \nmostly of wheat, rice, and potatoes. \n \n4. \nAfter independence in 1991, Uzbekistan\u2019s access to wheat became less secure because \nof  the  cessation  of  the  centrally  administered  barter  system  under  the  FSU  and  a  growing \ninstability  of  the  region\u2019s  economies.  As  a  landlocked  country  with  limited  physical  access  to \ninternational  markets,  food  security  became  a  major  concern,  and  Uzbekistan  embarked  on  a \nwheat  self-sufficiency  program.  From  1993  to  2002,  aggregate  wheat  output  grew  from  0.6 \nmillion to 4.7 million tons. With domestic consumption estimated at 4.5 million tons, the country \nis becoming self-sufficient in wheat.3 An analysis of the agriculture sector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nSector Challenges \n\n5. \nDespite  impressive  gains  in  grain  output,  the  agriculture  sector  faces  key  challenges. \nFirst,  wheat  production  is  still  prone  to  sudden  drops  because  the  recent  output  growth  has \nrelied on imported high-yielding wheat varieties (mostly from Russia) that adapt poorly to local \nconditions. As a result, standing crops are prone to high summer temperature, unstable water \n\n                                                 \n1  The project design is summarized in a Project Framework presented in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry  of  Macroeconomic  and  Statistics,  1994\u20132000.  Per  capita  consumption  of  other  cereals  such  as  corn, \n\nbarley, and oats is negligible. Potatoes are the second largest source of carbohydrate after wheat. \n\n3  Uzbekistan imports about 100,000 tons of hard durum wheat per annum, which cannot be produced domestically in \n\nadequate quantity. \n\n\f2 \n\nsupply, drought, diseases, and pests (e.g., locusts). Second, production costs are still relatively \nhigh  due  to  inefficient  farm  input  use,  excessive  land  preparation,  and  untimely  application  of \nfertilizers. Third, wheat seed production has been overly concentrated in the eastern part of the \ncountry (Andijan province), resulting in expensive seed transport, mixing of varieties, and poor \nseed adaptability to other agroclimatic zones. Poor seed germination leads to costly re-sowing \nthat increases farm costs by an average of 16%. Fourth, intensive cultivation of wheat in rain-\nfed  areas  and  wheat  and  cotton  crop  rotation  in  irrigated  areas  are  harming  soil  fertility  and \nstructure. Fifth, the agriculture sector suffers from chronic shortages of fertilizers and machinery \nservices due to low farm profits and inefficient delivery of farm inputs. State-owned enterprises \nstill  play  a  dominant  role  in  the  supply  of  agrochemicals,  seeds,  machinery  services,  and \npreproduction  financing.  In  an  environment  of  predetermined  market  shares  and  prices,  the \nenterprises have  limited  incentives  to  upgrade  or  expand  services.  The  use  of  poorly  adapted \nwheat varieties and imbalanced application of fertilizers have lowered the quality of domestically \nproduced wheat flour, yielding bread with low protein content. \n \n6. \nNational  wheat  output  has  also  increased  largely  due  to  the  state  order  system,  which \nhas  regulated  cropping  patterns  (land  allocation  for  various  crops)  and  the  volumes  of  wheat \nand cotton farmers must sell to the state, known as the state procurement quotas.4 Although the \nsystem  has  helped  stabilize  crop  outputs,  it  has  limited  farmers\u2019  options  to  adjust  crop \nproduction in response to market conditions and to improve income. The national program for \nwheat  self-sufficiency  requires  the  allocation  of  an  estimated  0.8  million  ha  (25%)  of  well-\nirrigated  land  for  intensive  wheat  production,  thus,  foregoing  the  land\u2019s  full  economic  potential \nfor  growing  higher-value  crops  such  as  cotton,  vegetables,  fruits,  and  seeds  (including  wheat \nseeds).  A  comparative  crop  return  analysis  is  provided  in  para.  52.  Overall,  impediments  to \nimproving  farm  incomes  have  hampered  farmers\u2019  ability  to  reinvest  their  earnings  to  increase \nfarm productivity.   \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Policies and Programs \n\n7. \nThe  agricultural  development  strategy  of  Uzbekistan  is  guided  by  the  Program  for \nStrengthening  Reforms  in  Agriculture  of  March  1998.  Reflecting  major  sector  concerns,  the \nprogram pursued three goals: (i) generate robust foreign exchange earnings, mainly through the \nsale  of  cotton;  (ii)  improve  food  security;  and  (iii)  promote  rural  employment,  enhance  living \nstandards, and ensure social stability.  \n \n8. \nTo  stimulate  improvement  in  farm  income  and  productivity,  the  Government  has \nintroduced phased reforms in crop production and marketing. In connection with implementation \nof  the  Ak  Altin  Agricultural  Development  Project  (AADP),5  beginning  in  2002  the  Government \nabolished the production targets for wheat and cotton in the pilot district of Ak Altin and lowered \ntheir procurement quotas by more than 50% (Appendix 2). As of 2003, similar reforms are being \nadopted  in  5  other  pilot  districts  covered  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Rural  Enterprise  Support \nProject  (RESP).6  Nationally,  the  Government  has  also  abolished  the  system  of  joint \nresponsibility among farms or family groups to fulfill the procurement quotas.7 Since 1999, the \n\n                                                 \n4  Regulation  of  cropping  pattern  was  abolished  in  March  2003  (para.  9).  The  obligatory  state  procurement  quotas, \n\nhowever, remain, although they are being lowered in selected areas.  \n\n5   ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project. Manila. \nAk Altin is in the Syrdarya province (oblast). \n\n6  RESP was approved on 28 November 2001, for $36.14 million. \n7  Joint  responsibility  refers  to  the  system  where  the  failure  of  a  production  unit  (private  farmer  or  family  group)  to \n\nmeet its procurement quota results in an increase in quotas of other units.  \n\n\f \n \n\n3\n\n \n\nstate has progressively dissolved less productive large cooperative farms or shirkats (Glossary) \ninto private farms, which has increased farm incomes.8 In line with agreements with the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  World  Bank  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),9  starting \nfrom 2002 the procurement prices for cotton and wheat nationwide are aligned with international \nmarket  prices,  instead  of  the  state-estimated  production  costs,  as  practiced  in  the  past.  The \nprice  adjustment  led  to  a  72%  and  57%  rise  in  wheat  and  cotton  procurement  prices, \nrespectively, in 2002\u20132003.10 \n \nIn  line  with  IMF  conditions  and  the  intention  to  ease  the  state  monopoly  in  cotton \n9. \nmarketing,  the  Government  adopted  a  resolution  in  December  2002  to  allow  private  sector \nparticipation  in  cotton  wholesale  and  export.  Issuance  of  the  resolution  was  followed  by  the \nrelease  of  the  Presidential  Decree  on  Deepening  Reforms  in  the  Agricultural  Sector  in  March \n2003.  The  decree  directed  the  Government  to  accelerate  the  formation  of  private  farms  and \nextend the reforms advocated by ADB and World Bank to abolish cropping pattern restrictions \nnationwide.  To  improve  farm  receipts,  a  price  premium  has  been  introduced  for  state \nprocurement of cotton and cotton byproducts. \n \n10. \nAs a part of its food security strategy, Uzbekistan aims to stabilize wheat production and \nprices.  With  outputs  exceeding  domestic  consumption  in  2002,  the  Government  has \nimplemented a buffer stock management system to stabilize wheat price. The State also intends \nto lessen the aggregate state procurement of wheat in the coming years below the present level \nof 2.7 million tons. The abolition of prescribed cropping patterns nationwide (para. 9) is intended \nto allow wheat production to adjust more readily to market demand. \n  \nADB\u2019s operations in Uzbekistan is guided by the Country Operational Strategy (COS) for \n11. \nUzbekistan  of  March  2000  and  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (CSPU)  for  2003\u2013\n2005, which both support the Government\u2019s efforts to transform the country\u2019s centrally planned \nsystem  into  a  market  economy  to  promote  economic  efficiency,  generate  sustainable \nemployment, and reduce poverty. The COS emphasizes assistance to agriculture, infrastructure \nrehabilitation, and education. The CSPU particularly emphasizes assistance to agricultural and \nrural development as most of the poor reside in rural areas. \n\n3. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n12. \nTo  address  the  sector  challenges  and  meet  the  sector  goals  (paras.  5\u20137),  Uzbekistan \nshould  rationalize  its  wheat  production,  particularly  by  minimizing  wheat  cultivation  where \nhigher-value crops can be grown. Investments should be made to stabilize and increase wheat \nyields,  especially  in  the  less  irrigable  and  rain-fed  lands.  Farm  access  to  agrochemicals  and \nmachinery  must  likewise  be  improved  to  raise  the  quality  of  domestically  produced  wheat.  A \nrelatively  low-cost  project  should  be  carried  out  to  (i)  accelerate  the  introduction  of  wheat \nvarieties adaptable to local conditions; (ii) support agricultural extension to promote sustainable \nand  more  profitable  agricultural  practices  and  cropping  rotations  involving  wheat;  and  (iii) \nimprove  farm  access  to  support  services,  including  the  supply  of  agrochemicals,  farm \nmachinery, transport, and agroprocessing services, by promoting private sector participation in \nthese activities. To encourage investment in the farms and rural enterprises, the Project should \n\n                                                 \n8  Based on government and World Bank surveys. \n9  Agreements  with  the  IMF  were  in  connection  with  the  Staff  Monitored  Program  implemented  in  January\u2013August \n\n10 The assessment of reform progress is based on findings of the sector review missions fielded in October 2002 and \n\n2002. \n\nApril 2003. \n\n\f4 \n\nhelp deepen agriculture sector reforms and demonstrate, in selected areas, economically viable \nand sustainable systems of wheat production. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Area \n\n13. \nThe  Project  will  provide  assistance  to  5  wheat-producing  provinces  (oblasts),  covering \nwheat breeding, testing of new wheat varieties, dissemination of improved farming technologies, \nand strengthening of the state\u2019s pest-monitoring program. These oblasts were chosen based on \navailability of land suitable for wheat cultivation (i.e., rain-fed areas with precipitation in excess \nof 300 millimeters per annum and irrigable land not suitable for high-value crops). The project \narea  stretches  from  north  to  south  in  the  central  part  of  the  country,  covering  the  oblasts  of \nTashkent,  Syrdarya,  Djizak,  Samarkand,  and  Kashkadarya.  The  area  has  560,000  ha  and \n293,000 ha of irrigated and rain-fed wheat area, respectively, or 54% and 95% of the national \ntotals. Average yield of irrigated wheat in the oblasts is 2.4 tons (t)/ha, which is still lower than \nthe national average of 3.8 t/ha. Average rain-fed yields, which range from 0.6 to 1.0 t/ha can \nrealistically  be  doubled  over  the  coming  decade  by  introducing  drought-resistant  and  earlier-\nmaturing varieties.  \n \n14. \nThe  project  oblasts  account  for  26%  of  the  total  agricultural  land  and  44%  of  irrigated \nland. They produced 1.5 million tons of wheat (37% of the national total) and 1.0 million tons of \nraw cotton (33% of the total) in 2000. The project area population was 8.9 million (36% of the \ntotal) as of 2001, 6.2 million or 69% of whom live in rural areas, which is higher than the national \nfigure  of  63%.  Of  the  total  cultivated  area  of  1.9  million  ha,  72%  were  under  farm  enterprises \n(state or shirkat farms), 18% under private farms, and 10% under dehkan farms (Glossary). In \n2001 almost all farm enterprises and private farms planted wheat, occupying 42% and 40% of \ntheir  total  sown  areas,  respectively.  At  least  70%  of  rural  families  in  Kaskadarya,  Samarkand, \nand Djizak, and 40% in Tashkent and Syrdarya planted wheat in their backyard plots (average \n0.15 ha per household).  \n \n15. \nIntensive  and  integrated  assistance  will  be  provided  in  three  focus  districts  within  the \nproject oblasts. These will cover assistance provided to the oblasts as well as additional support \nfor  operations  of  private  seed  companies,  enterprises  providing  farm  support  services,  and \nfarmer-owned  advisory  extension  centers.  The  districts  are  selected  based  on  their  (i)  climate \nand  soil  suitability  to  support  rain-fed  wheat  (commercial  grain  and  seed  production),  (ii)  soil \nsuitability for irrigated wheat production, (iii) reliability of the irrigation system and availability of \nwell-irrigated  and  drained  land  for  wheat  seed  production,  and  (iv)  distance  and  access  to \nmarket  as  a  proxy  for  attractiveness  of  the  district  to  private  sector  investment.  Criteria  and \nmechanisms  used  to  select  focus  districts,  and  the  description  of  the  project  area  are  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  B.  The  three  districts  are:  Zamin  (286,000  ha)  in  Djizak  oblast, \nKatakurgan  (146,778  ha)  in  Samarkand  oblast,  and  Kuyi  Chirchik  (56,000  ha)  in  Tashkent \noblast.  Zamin  and  Katakurgan  have  been  selected  as  model  sites  for  rain-fed  and  irrigated \nwheat  seed  and  commercial  grain  farming.  Kuyi-Chirchick  was  chosen  as  a  potential  regional \ncenter of seed production for Tashkent and Syrdarya oblasts.    \n \n\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nThe  project  objective  is  to  promote  economical  and  sustainable  systems  of  wheat \n16. \nproduction. Achievement of the project objective will contribute to the realization of the project \ngoal to improve farm income. \n\n\f \n \n\n  \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n5\n\n \n\n17. \nThe  Project  has  the  following  components:  (i)  varietal  development  and  testing,  (ii) \nenhanced  farm  management,  (iii)  agricultural  enterprise  development,  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement. They are described below. \n \n\n1. \n\nVarietal Development and Testing \n\na. \n\nVarietal Development \n\n18. \nThe  component  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Andijan  and  Galla-Aral  Cereals  and \nLegumes  Research  Institute  (AGCLRI)  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources \n(MAWR)  to  efficiently  evaluate  and  identify,  among  hundreds  of  local  and  foreign  wheat \nvarieties  and  parent  materials,  varieties  suitable  for  the  local  growing  conditions.  Project \ninterventions will complement assistance already received by the institute in forms of breeding \nmaterials  and  training,  with  the  provision  of  laboratory  and  field  equipment;  refurbishment  of \nlaboratories,  greenhouses,  and  storage  facilities;  establishment  of  research  plots;  supply  of \nwork  materials;  and  domestic/overseas  staff  training.  The  assistance  to  AGCLRI  will  be \naccompanied by capacity building of the Plant Genetics Institute (PGI) of the MAWR to upgrade \nits  capability  to  evaluate  cereal  resistance  to  diseases.  Aside  from  support  for  wheat  varietal \ndevelopment,  the  Project  will  also  assist  the  legume  variety  development  by  AGCLRI  to  help \npromote wheat and legume crop rotation, particularly in the rain-fed areas. \n \nThe  outputs  expected  from  the  subcomponent  are  the  release  of  at  least  6  new wheat \n19. \nvarieties  that  are  well-suited  to  local  conditions,  and  the  doubling  of  the  AGCLRI  capacity  to \nmultiply  foundation  seeds  from  400  tons  to  900  tons  per  annum.  Desirable  characteristics  of \nnew wheat varieties include improved baking quality, early maturity and improved tolerance to \ndrought  for  rain-fed  varieties,  resistance  to  local  pests  and  diseases,11  reduced  grain  loss \nthrough shattering at maturity, and variable grain maturity period for irrigated wheat to lengthen \nthe  harvest  season  and  reduce  the  number  of  expensive  combine  harvesters  required  by \nfarmers.  The  Project  will  also  support  commercial  production  of  improved  seeds  through  the \nestablishment and capacity building of private seed companies in the project districts (para. 25). \n \n\nb. \n\nVarietal Testing \n\nCapacity building assistance will be provided under the Project to the State Commission \n20. \non  Varietal  Testing  (SCVT),  a  regulatory  agency  of  MAWR,  to  strengthen  and  expedite  the \nagency\u2019s  evaluation  of  promising  varieties  identified  by  AGCLRI  and  varieties  to  be  imported \ninto  Uzbekistan  by  private  seed  companies.  Aside  from  building  the  capacity  of  5  SCVT  test \nstations  in  the  5  project  oblasts,  the  Project  will  expand  the  geographical  coverage  of  varietal \ntesting to include 15 on-farm sites to ensure robust evaluation of varieties under different agro-\necological  conditions.  Under  the  component,  consultant  inputs  will  be  provided  to  (i)  upgrade \nSCVT\u2019s testing procedures, (ii) upgrade quality control in the seed multiplication, (iii) develop a \nplan for AGCLRI and SCVT to better recover the costs of varietal development, and (iv) promote \nfarmers\u2019 participation in the wheat breeding program.  \n \n\n                                                 \n11  Breeding  for  resistance  to  fungal  leaf  diseases  such  as  rust  is  a  continuing  process  as  rust  organisms  naturally \n\nmutate. \n\n\f6 \n\n2. \n\nEnhanced Farm Management \n\na. \n\nFarm Extension \n\nIn  the  three  focus  districts,  the  Project  will  support  operations  of  three  rural  business \n21. \nadvisory  centers  (RBACs)  established  under  the  Association  of  Dehkan  and  Private  Farmers \n(ADPF),  which  is  a  national  farmers  association.  The  RBACs  will  function  as  rural  consulting \nfirms,  particularly  to  provide  private  and  household  farms  with  technical  farming,  legal,  and \nfinancial  advisory  services.  Their  services  will  include  the  preparation  of  market  demand \nanalysis  and  feasibility  studies  for  farms  and  enterprises.  Based  on  feedback  from  farmers\u2019-\nneed  surveys,  RBACs  will  introduce  new  crop  varieties  and  organize  demonstrations  of \nalternative  crop  rotation  regimes  and  farm  management  practices.  With  funds  appropriated  to \nthem, RBACs will contract appropriate institutes and experts to facilitate on-farm demonstration \nand disseminate technologies that interest farmers. Experienced farmers from other regions will \nalso  be  invited  to  exchange  views  and  experiences  with  farmers  in  the  project  districts.  The \nsubcomponent will therefore promote consultative and demand-oriented rural extension service.  \n \n\nb. \n\nTechnology Development \n\n22. \nTo  introduce  new  and  appropriate  technologies,  selected  institutes  of  MAWR  will \norganize  field  demonstrations  and  prepare  manuals  for  farmers.  Priority  will  be  given  to \ntechnologies  that  have  been  pilot-tested  in  Uzbekistan  and  proven  promising  technically  and \nfinancially\u2014particularly  those  tested  under  ADB-funded  regional  technical  assistance  for  On-\nfarm  Soil  and  Water  Management  in  Central  Asia.12  For  water-short  and  rain-fed  areas,  the \nProject  will  promote  adoption  of  low-tillage  techniques  to  conserve  soil  moisture,  lessen \nmachinery costs, and allow early planting and maturity of wheat. Early maturity in these areas \nwill  reduce  yield  losses  due  to  exposure  of  crops  to  the  high  summer  temperature.  Other \ntechniques  for  water-short  areas  are  alternate  year  planting  and  wheat-legume  rotation  to \nimprove  soil  fertility  and  moisture  retention.  In  irrigated  lands,  the  subcomponent  will  promote \ncut-back  and  alternate  furrow  irrigation  methods  as  well  as  furrow-bed  planting  techniques  to \nreduce excessive water application and mitigate the adverse effect of soil salinity. Improved soil \nand water management techniques will be introduced by the Central Asian Institute for Irrigation \nResearch (CAIIR) in association with other institutes selected by the project working group. For \nfields  that  produce  wheat  seeds,  laser  field  leveling  will  be  tested  to  ensure  a  high  rate  of \ngermination  of  expensive  foundation  and  elite  seeds,  and  uniform  water  application  to  allow \nsubstantial  increase  in  yields.  Laser  land  leveling  technology  will  be  introduced  by  the \nAgricultural Institute for Mechanization and Electrification (AIME). \n \n23. \nThe  capacity  of  the  Plant  Protection  Institute  (PPI)  will  be  improved  under  the \nsubcomponent to monitor and forecast disease, pest and weed infestations, particularly locust \ninfestation, which has harmed wheat crops. The Project will provide equipment and support field \nmonitoring works to help MAWR recommend in a timely manner measures needed to prevent \ncostly pest and disease outbreaks. Support for PPI and MAWR will include financing information \ndissemination to farmers on the risks of pest infestation and implementation of critically needed \npest control interventions to prevent pest outbreaks. \n \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB.  1999.  Regional  Technical  Assistance  for  the  Fourth  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resource  Research  at  CGIAR \nCenters. Manila. Pertinent activities are carried out under the component for On-Farm Soil and Water Management \nfor Sustainable Agriculture in Central Asia, for $1.2 million.  \n\n\f \n \n\nc. \n\nIrrigation Facility Repair \n\n7\n\n \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nfarms \n\nThe Project will help improve irrigation and drainage facilities on about 6,000 ha of wheat \n24. \nseed-producing \nfocus  districts. \nto  help  ensure  robust  seed  production \nComplementing the on-farm rehabilitation works, minor repairs will be performed on the existing \ninter-farm  water  conveyance  and  collector  drainage  facilities.  Field  surveys  and  civil  works  for \nthe  subcomponent  will  be  funded  with  government  counterpart  resources.  The  rehabilitation \nplan,  and  costs  for  each  farm  will  be  agreed  between  farmers  and  the  district  agriculture  and \nwater resources department (DAWD) of MAWR and the project management office (PMO). The \ncost of facility repairs will be recovered in 25 years (para. 56).13 To sustain the operation of the \nrehabilitated  irrigation  facilities,  the  Project  will  support  the  formation  and  operations  of  water \nusers  associations  (WUAs).  The  Project  will  also  provide  critically  needed  equipment  to \nmaintain  primary  canals  and  drainage  collectors  in  the  project  districts  to  be  undertaken  by \nDAWDs. \n \n\n3. \n\nAgricultural Enterprise Development \n\ninput \n\nrental, \n\nfarmers  with  diversified  services  such  as  machinery \n\n25. \nThe shortage of machinery and agrochemicals are key causes for unstable crop yields \nand deteriorating quality of domestically produced wheat. In the project districts, the component \nwill  help  form  and  operate  privately  owned  agricultural  service  centers  (ASCs),  which  will \nretailing, \nprovide \nagroprocessing, marketing, and transportation. The Project will also help create and assist the \noperation of private companies that will produce high-quality wheat seeds in the three districts. \nThe  seed  companies  will  work  together  with  private  farms,  on  a  contractual  basis,  to  cultivate \nand multiply seeds from foundation seeds.  \n \n26. \nThe project loan funds of $10.1 million will be provided to enterprises under the Project \nthrough  selected  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs).  The  enterprises  will  use  the  project \nsubloans  to  procure  needed  equipment  and  other  capital  investment  requirements.  Details  of \nthe eligibility criteria of PFIs and subborrowers and the on-lending arrangements are in Appendix \n3. The Project will screen suitable private sector sponsors, including groups of private farmers, \nlocal  businesses,  and  foreign  joint  ventures,  and  assist  the  operations  of  the  ASCs  and  seed \ncompanies.  The  technical  assistance  for  furthering  reforms  in  the  grain  sector  (paras.  49\u201350) \nwill  also  assist  prospective  sponsors  to  refine  their  business  plans  and  provide  technical  and \nlegal assistance necessary for their business operations. To promote the development of ASCs \nand  seed  companies  and  ensure  the  affordability  of  goods  and  services  they  provide,  key \nreform initiatives will be introduced in the project districts, primarily to ease the state control of \nprices  and  obligatory  procurement  quotas  for  wheat  and  wheat  seeds  and  to  promote \ncompetition among the enterprises (paras. 29, 69, and 70). \n \nSuitable  PFIs,  such  as  Pahta  and  Asaka  Banks,  were  identified  during  project \n27. \npreparation in 2003. However, given the potential consolidation and privatization of the banks in \nanticipation of the full convertibility of the Sum, selection of PFIs to take part in the Project will \nbe carried out in 2004. This approach will prevent the need to repeat the PFI selection and will \nnot  hinder  project  implementation.  International  and  local  banking  experts  (3  person-months) \nwill be engaged to facilitate the selection process.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13 Repayment scheme for the on-farm works will follow a similar scheme being introduced under AADP. \n\n\f8 \n\n4. \n\nProject Management \n\n28. \n  The  Project  will  help  operate  the  PMO  and  three  project  site  offices  (PSOs)  in  the \nproject districts. The PMO will be provided with qualified staff, equipment, vehicles, and facilities \nnecessary  to  coordinate  and  supervise  project  activities,  and  will  be  headed  by  a  project \nmanager,  who  will  report  to  a  director  general  of  the  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  (RRA),  the \nproject  executing  agency.  The  director  general  will  be  the  project  director.  PMO  and  PSO \nactivities  will  focus  on  administrative  and  financial  management  tasks.  Technical  tasks  will  be \ncarried out by the line departments and institutes under MAWR with administrative and resource \nallocation support from the PMO to strengthen the capacity of MAWR to perform its duties. PMO \nand PSO operations will be supported by project management consultants, who will provide on-\nthe-job  training  in  project  administration,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  PMO  and  PSO  staff  will \nalso receive training in activity planning, budgeting, procurement procedures, and preparation of \nproject reports. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nSupport for Agricultural Sector Reforms \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  help  introduce  market-oriented  reforms  in  the  agriculture  sector.  In  the \nthree project districts, state procurement quotas for wheat\u2014a parameter that reflects the state\u2019s \ndirect involvement in farm production and marketing decisions\u2014will be reduced from over 50% \nto  25%  of  historical  output,  in  line  with  reforms  introduced  under  AADP  and  RESP.  The \nGovernment has further agreed to lower the procurement quotas for wheat seeds in the project \ndistricts as outlined in para. 69. Given the state\u2019s dominant role in wheat seed production and \nfarm input retailing, the reforms will be introduced to reduce the state\u2019s direct involvement and \npromote  private  sector  participation  in  these  business  activities.  The  Project  will  facilitate  the \nestablishment and operation of fully private ASCs and seed companies. This initiative will be a \nstep forward in the sector\u2019s transition process following the creation of a commercially-run state-\nowned farm equipment rental firm under AADP, and joint venture ASCs between the state and \nprivate sector under RESP.14  \n \n\n2. \n\nDemand-Oriented Agricultural Extension \n\n30. \nThe concentration of project resources on RBACs, instead of a higher-level apparatus, is \nintended to decentralize agricultural extension program of MAWR so that RBACs will be more \nresponsive  to  the  needs  of  farmers  and  local  communities.  The  project  design  to  gradually \nchange the RBACs\u2019 source of funding from state and project budgets to the collection of service \nfees  will  also  give  appropriate  incentives  for  RBACs  to  better  understand  their  clients\u2019  needs \nand  meet  them  in  a  cost  effective  manner.  The  initiative,  therefore,  will  help  institutionalize \nfarmers\u2019  feedback  mechanisms  and  participation  on  extension  services  provided  under  the \nProject. At national level, the Project will also help simplify information pamphlets and manuals \nto  enhance  the  dissemination  of  technical,  legal,  and  market  information  in  rural  areas. \nImproved  information  materials  will  be  distributed  by  RBACs  and  DAWDs  on  a  cost  recovery \nbasis. \n   \n\n                                                 \n14 Under RESP, the state may hold up to 40% equity stake in ASCs. \n\n\f \n \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n9\n\n \n\n31. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $40.0 million equivalent, comprising $23.4 million in \nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $16.6  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  estimates \ninclude provision for $2.3 million in taxes and duties, and $3.8 million in the physical and price \ncontingencies.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end  fee  of \n0.50%  of  the  loan  amount  (the  fee  will  be  capitalized  in  the  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government of Uzbekistan has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facilities \non the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n  \nThe  proposed  loan  will  finance  65%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  loan  will  cover  the \n33. \nentire foreign exchange cost of $23.4 million and $2.6 million equivalent in local currency cost. \nThe  beneficiaries  and  private  sector  will  contribute  about  $3.4  million  for  preparation  of \ndemonstration  plots,  maintenance  of  the  RBAC  facilities,  and  counterpart  investment  and \nworking  capital  for  ASCs  and  seed  enterprises.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining \n$10.6 million equivalent. For agricultural enterprise development, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nwill  enter  into  subsidiary  loan  agreements  for  $10.1  million  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower  and  two \n\n\f10 \n\nPFIs for on-lending to ASCs and seed enterprises.15 A summary of the proposed financing plan \nis in Table 2.

The PSC \nwill be headed by a deputy prime minister and comprise senior staff of the Cabinet of Ministers \n(COM), MAWR, Ministry of Economy (MOE), MOF, and other concerned agencies. To facilitate \ntechnical coordination and project resource allocation among agencies involved in the Project, a \nproject  working  group  (PWG)  will  be  formed,  chaired  by  MAWR.  The  group  will  comprise \ntechnical  staff  of  MAWR,  RRA,  COM,  MOE,  MOF,  State  Committee  for  Nature  Protection \n(SCNP),  State  Committee  for  Land  Resources  (SCLR),  State  Center  for  Seed  Quality  Control \nand  Certification,  concerned  agencies,  and  representatives  of  local  governments,  ADPF, \nfarmers\u2019 organizations, and PFIs. The PSC and PWG will be formed before loan effectiveness. \nProject implementation and fund flow charts are in Appendix 5. \n \n35. \nAs  the  executing  agency,  RRA  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  project  management \nand  coordination.  A  PMO  will  be  established  within  RRA  and  3  PSOs  will  coordinate  and \nmonitor activities in the project districts.  \n \n36. \nAGCLRI  and  the  Plant  Pathology  Department  of  PGI  will  implement  the  wheat  varietal \ndevelopment  subcomponent.  They  will  be  accountable  to  the  PWG  for  the  accomplishment  of \nproject  targets  and  resources  used.  SCVT  will  build  the  capacity  of  MAWR  to  regulate  crop \nvarietal  development.  SCVT  performance  will  be  monitored  by  PWG  through  the  Office  of  the \nMinister of Agriculture and Water Resources. \n \nExtension  services  in  the  project  districts  will  be  carried  out  by  RBACs.  Activities  and \n37. \nperformance  of  RBACs  will  be  evaluated  by  ADPF,  which,  in  turn,  will  be  accountable  to  the \nPWG.  The  CAIIR,  AIME,  and  PPI  will  implement  the  subcomponent  for  technological \ndevelopment  and  pest  monitoring.  These  institutes  will  be  accountable  to  the  PWG  through \nMAWR\u2019s  Scientific  Production  Center  for  Agriculture.  The  subcomponent  for  irrigation  and \ndrainage  system  repair  will  be  implemented  by  MAWR\u2019s  Water  Resources  Department,  and \nRBACs  will  support  operations  of  the  WUAs.  In  coordination  with  RRA  and  MOF,  PFIs  will \nimplement the component for agricultural enterprise development.  \n \n\n                                                 \n15 The terms of subsidiary loan agreement will not be softer than those of the ADB\u2019s loan to the Government. \n\n\f \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement \n\n11\n\n \n\n38. \nFarm  machinery,  field  and  laboratory  equipment,  minor  civil  works,  vehicles,  office \nequipment,  and  materials  required  for  project  implementation  and  monitoring  will  be  procured \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Equipment  and  material  procurement  contracts \nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  or  more  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts costing less than $500,000 will be awarded on \nthe basis of international shopping procedures acceptable to ADB. Small supply contracts and \ntraining  activities  costing  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  through  direct  purchase.  The \naward of all equipment contracts will be subject to approval by ADB. \n \n39. \nEach civil works contract estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,000,000 or more will be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  ICB  procedures  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nCivil  works  contracts  costing  less  than  $1,000,000  will  be  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. An indicative list of procurement packages \nis in Appendix 6. \n  \n40. \nFor procurement of goods and services financed by subloans made out of the proceeds \nof  the  loan,  subborrowers  will  need  to  demonstrate  that  the  procurement  procedures  adopted \nare \nfor  Procurement  and \nAnticorruption  Policy.  PFIs  will  certify  to  ADB  that  the  goods  and  services  financed  by  the \nsubloans  are  procured  from  ADB  member  countries.  Where  the  value  of  goods  financed  by  a \nsubloan  exceeds  $1  million,  a  preshipment  inspection  certificate  from  a  reputable  agency, \nacceptable to ADB, will be required. \n \n\ntransparent,  efficient,  and  conform  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n41. \nThe Project will provide for 31 person-months of international and 42 person-months of \ndomestic consultants. The international consultants will help administer the project, monitor and \nevaluate  project  impacts,  upgrade  wheat  breeding  and  varietal  selection,  develop  effective \nextension  services,  and  evaluate  the  suitability  of  PFIs  to  take  part  in  the  Project.    Domestic \nconsultants  will  help  organize  WUAs  to  improve  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  irrigation \nfacilities; and help build RBAC capacity in extension service delivery, project impact evaluation, \nand  PFI  evaluation.  Banking  experts  will  be  engaged  through  individual  contracts  to  evaluate \nthe  PFIs.  Other  consultants  will  be  provided  by  an  international  consulting  firm  in  association \nwith a domestic consulting firm to be engaged by RRA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of the \ndomestic consultants. An outline of the terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\n42. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  vehicles,  field  and  laboratory  equipment,  and \nconsultant  services  may  be  procured  in  advance.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that  (i) \nadvance action will cover actions up to, but not including, contract signing; and (ii) approval of \nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.   \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounts \n\nAfter  loan  effectiveness,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  Central  Bank  of \n43. \nUzbekistan  or  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  to  facilitate  the  timely  release  of  loan \nfunds.  Thereafter,  once  the  PMO  has  established  an  adequate  accounting  system  for  the \n\n\f12 \n\nProject,  the  ceiling  for  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  estimated  expenditures  in  six \nmonths.  The  use  of  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  considered  in  the  first \nyear  of  project  implementation,  assuming  the  establishment  of  RRA\u2019s  separate  accounting \nsystem and internal control procedures for the Project. For the subloans provided through PFIs, \nRRA  and  PFIs  will  collect  supporting  documents  and  prepare  withdrawal  applications  and \nfurnish them to ADB. The establishment of the imprest account and disbursement of subloans \nunder  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  other \nprocedures agreed upon by ADB and the Government.   \n \n\n6. \n\nAudit \n\n44. \nRRA will keep separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will be \naudited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to \nengage auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will be \nsubmitted to ADB within six months after the end of the fiscal year. ASCs and seed companies \nreceiving  subloans  under  the  Project  will  also  be  required  to  provide  audited  financial  reports \nacceptable to MOF, PFIs, and ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nReports \n\nRRA,  through  the  PMO,  will  submit  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  ADB,  indicating \n45. \nprogress  made  and  problems  encountered,  steps  taken  to  remedy  them,  and  a  proposed \nprogram  of  activities  and  outputs  for  the  next  reporting  period.  RRA  will  also  provide  other \nreports  and  information  relating  to  the  Project  as  ADB  may  reasonably  request,  including  the \nProject\u2019s  environmental  impacts,  dialogue  with  beneficiaries,  and  social  issues  relating  to  the \nProject.  Within  three  months  after  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  RRA  will  submit  to \nADB  a  project  completion  report  detailing,  among  other  things,  information  on  project \nimplementation,  use  of  project  funds,  and  the  extent  to  which  project  objectives  have  been \naccomplished.  \n \n\n8. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nTo monitor the Project\u2019s economic, social, and environmental impacts, a monitoring and \n46. \nevaluation (M&E) unit will be formed within the PMO. The unit will have two full-time staff with \nexpertise in economics and environmental monitoring, and will (i) monitor the delivery of project \nbenefits  to  targeted  recipients;  and  (ii)  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental  impacts.  With  assistance  of  the  M&E  consultants,  and  in  cooperation  with  the \nlocal  governments,  the  unit  will  develop  a  project  M&E  system  for  key  project  performance \nindicators such as household welfare (farm receipts, household incomes, household access to \nfood)  and  efficacy  of  policy  reforms  in  liberalizing  farm-level  decision  making,  enhancing  crop \nprices,  and  increasing  state  revenues.  M&E  should  also  evaluate  the  impacts  of  subloans \nprovided  to  ASCs  and  seed  enterprises.  Participation  of  women  in  the  project-sponsored \nresearch,  training,  and  farm  extension  will  also  be  monitored.  A  socioeconomic  profile  of  the \nbeneficiaries will be prepared at the start of project implementation. The profile will be updated \nat project completion, and a report will describe the project benefits and impacts. \n \n47. \nEnvironmental  monitoring  will  include  analysis  of  soil  and  water  samples  in  the  project \ndistricts to assess the impacts of increased application of agrochemicals and salt leaching. Field \ninspection  will  also  be  strengthened  to  ensure  that  expansion  of  rain-fed  wheat  farms  will  not \nencroach on grassland and marginal desert zones (para. 64). \n \n\n\f \n \n\n9. \n\nMidterm Review \n\n13\n\n \n\n48. \nThe Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review at the end of the third \nyear of project implementation. The review will assess, among others, (i) project implementation \nprogress;  (ii)  performance  of  project  stakeholders,  consultants,  and  contractors;  and  (iii) \ncompliance  with  assurances  stipulated  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  Project  impacts  will  also  be \nassessed covering aspects outlined in paras. 46\u201347. \n. \n\nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n49. \nAn associated grant-financed TA will be provided to complement the Project. The TA will \nsupport reforms in agriculture, particularly in the wheat subsector. TA activities will be grouped \ninto  two  components:  (i)  facilitating  private  sector  entry  into  seed  production  and  operation  of \nASCs in the focus districts, and (ii) supporting the government review of wheat production and \nmarketing  policies  (Appendix  8).  The  first  component  will  help  potential  investors  in  seed \ncompanies and ASCs (i) better formulate their business visions and strategies, and (ii) secure \ncommercial  financing  for  the  companies\u2019  operations.  The  component  will  also  help  (i)  build  an \nunderstanding in the central and local governments of how the private sector can help develop \nthe  agriculture  sector,  (ii)  identify  reforms  to  facilitate  private  sector  participation  in  the  sector, \n(iii) build the capacity of RBACs to deliver business advisory services to private entrepreneurs \nand  farmers,  and  (iv)  ASCs  and  seed  enterprises  develop  growing  contract  schemes  and \nextend preproduction credit to farmers. The second TA component will help MAWR, MOF, and \nMOE  identify  market  mechanism  by  which  grain  prices  and  output  can  be  stabilized  and  food \nsecurity  achieved  in  a  cost-effective  manner.  Viable  options  include  the  introduction  of  buffer \ngrain stock management, price and tax incentive schemes, and flexible trade policies. \n   \n50. \nThe total TA cost is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe  TA  will  provide  for  12  person-months  of  international  and  15  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants. The TA will commence in the first year of project implementation and be \ncompleted in 10 months. \n \n\nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses \n\n51. \nFinancial and economic analyses have been carried out to assess the attractiveness of \nwheat  cultivation  and  the  sustainability  of  project  investments  under  current  and  future\u2014more \nthe \nliberalized\u2014market  environments.  The  current \nimplementation  of  existing  policies  as  of  2003.  This  scenario  assumed  the  alignment  of  state \nprocurement prices for wheat and cotton to international prices and abolition of state control of \nthe  cropping  patterns  (para.  9).  The  financial  analysis  also  assumed  the  adoption  of  reduced \nprocurement quotas for wheat and wheat seeds as outlined in the project assurances (para. 69). \nFor  the  crop  budget  analysis,  as  of  October  2002  the  state  procurement  prices  for  wheat  and \ncotton were estimated at 30% and 52% below their economic parity prices, respectively, while \ntraded  agrochemicals  are  27-35%  below  their  economic  prices.  The  divergence  between  the \nfinancial  and  economic  prices  has  been  attributed  mainly  to  the  divergence  of  the  official  and \n\nregime  assumed \n\n(financial)  price \n\n\f14 \n\nmarket exchange rates. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.3 was used.16 In accordance with \nmarket  standards,  wheat  seed  prices  are  calculated  at  50\u2013200%  over  the  commercial  grain \nprices, depending on genetic purity. Market prices for wheat, for above-quota sales by farmers, \nwere  estimated  at  20%  over  the  state  procurement  prices  based  on  data  for  2001\u20132002.  A \nliberalized  policy  environment  assumes  the  convergence  of  financial  prices  toward  economic \nprices and termination of the procurement quota system.  \n \n\n1. \n\nComparative Analysis of Wheat Production \n\n52. \nFinancial and economic gross profits of 11 crops grown in Central Asia, including wheat, \nhave  been  estimated  to  assess  the  attractiveness  of  wheat  cultivation  under  the  current  and \nliberalized policy environment. Crop budget models were developed to assess crop profitability \nin  three  growing  areas:  well-irrigated,  irrigation-deficit  (Glossary),  and  rain-fed  areas.  The \nassessment  showed  that  wheat,  on  average,  generates  positive  farm  incomes  in  the  three \ngrowing  areas    (Appendix  9,  Table  A9.1).  In  the  irrigation-deficit  area,  wheat  provides  the \nhighest  financial  and  economic  returns  among  the  crops  evaluated.  In  the  rain-fed  system, \ncrops  with  limited  demand,  such  as  chickpeas  and  sesame  provide  higher  return  than  wheat. \nDue to their drought tolerance, chickpeas and safflower can be grown in rotation with wheat to \nmaximize and stabilize farm incomes. On well-irrigated land, wheat generates less income than \ncotton; vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, and onions); wheat seed; and fodder crops. Depending \non  farmers\u2019  preference,  irrigated  wheat  can  be  grown  in  rotation  with  cotton  to  stabilize  farm \nincomes.  However,  this  rotation  cannot  be  sustained  for  many  years  as  it  will  result  in  the \ndeterioration of soil and yields of both crops. Overall the assessment concluded that wheat is a \nfinancially  and  economically  attractive  crop,  particularly  for  the  irrigation-deficit  and  rain-fed \nareas.17 On well-irrigated land farmers may choose to grow wheat for food security and income \nstabilization.  \n   \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n53. \nFinancial  analyses  have  been  conducted  for  farms,  ASCs,  and  seed  companies.    For \nrepresentative  farms,  projected  income  is  expected  to  increase  over  the  next  decade.  For \nrepresentative rain-fed farms, annual income is projected to rise from SUM18,950 ($19) per ha \nto  SUM48,840  ($50)  as  a  result  of  project  interventions  (Appendix  9).  Incomes  from  irrigated \nfarms  were  estimated  to  rise  from  SUM100,300  ($102)  per  ha  to  SUM350,700  ($360).  For \nirrigated farms producing wheat seed, returns are expected to rise from SUM150,000 ($154) per \nha to SUM357,000 ($365) in year 10. \n \n54. \nFinancial analysis of ASCs was carried out over 25 years for the discounted cash flow \nanalysis,  and  15  years  for  financial  projections.  Based  on  models  of  existing  operations,  the \nproject  ASCs  are  expected  to  carry  out  diversified  lines  of  business  including  farm  machinery \nhire and repair services, flour milling, and cotton/safflower oil extraction. The analysis found that \nthe projected financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for ASC is 27.5%. Estimated performance \nand creditworthiness ratios are satisfactory, with the earnings-to-sales ratio rising from 17% to \n34%  over  15  years,  and  debt-to-equity  ratio  falling  from  3.3  to  1.6  in  four  years.    ASC \nperformance  is  sensitive  to  rising  fixed  and  variable  costs and  to  the  level  of  annual  turnover. \nShortfalls  in  turnover  as  a  result  of  poor  management,  excessive  machinery  downtime,  or \nproblems  with  service  marketing,  will  erode  projected  profits  (Appendix  9,  Tables  A9.2\u2013A9.3.) \n\n                                                 \n16 The price divergence on cotton is higher due to additional taxes on cotton ginning (processing). \n17 Estimated size of irrigation deficit areas in each oblast is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n\f \n \n\n15\n\n \n\nThe financial analysis of the representative seed companies also confirmed the financial viability \nof investment in seed processing, with an estimated FIRR of 34.3% over 15 years. \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n55. \nThe economic analysis was carried out using the domestic price numeraire method, with \nadjustments made to remove taxes and duties and to apply a shadow exchange rate factor of \n1.3  to  the  border  prices  of  traded  goods.  In  view  of  substantial  unemployment  and \nunderemployment  in  the  rural  sector,  a  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.8  was  also  applied. \nQuantification  of  incremental  benefits  arising  from  the  project  interventions  was  limited  to \nbenefits  resulting  from  improved  wheat  yields.  This  approach  excluded  project  benefits \nexpected from the shift of the cropping pattern in well-irrigated lands from wheat to higher-value \ncrops,  made  possible  by  the  increase  of  wheat  yields.  The  analysis  also  excluded  expected \nincrease  in  profits  from  crops  other  than  wheat  arising  from  better  crop  rotation  regimes.  The \nanalysis  therefore  relied  on  conservative  benefit  estimates.  Over  a  25-year  impact  period,  the \nProject is expected to yield an economic internal rate of return of 31%. The attractive return is \nattributed to the relatively low project investment costs and high incremental benefits expected \nfrom  the  support  of  agricultural  research  and  adoption  of  technologies  planned  under  the \nProject. A sensitivity analysis also showed the robustness of the projected returns in response \nto variations in the cost-and-benefit streams. Details of the economic analysis are in Appendix \n9. \n \nB. \n\nCost Recovery \n\nAn  estimated  65%  of  project  costs  will  be  recovered  through  users\u2019  fees  and  subloan \n56. \nrepayment. Seed farms will be required to repay the repair costs of on-farm irrigation/drainage \nfacilities  to  be  agreed  on  between  farmers  and  MAWR.18  The  repayments  will  be  collected \nthrough a 25-year betterment levy, the mechanism of which is being implemented under AADP. \nThe  state  will  shoulder  the  costs  of  (i)  minor  repairs  of  inter-farm  collector  drainage,  and  (ii) \ninstitutional  building  of  WUAs  and  introduction  of  irrigation  service  fees  in  the  three  project \ndistricts. ASCs and seed companies, to be established as private commercial entities, will repay \ntheir subloans.   \n \n57. \nBecause  of  low  farmers\u2019  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  new  technologies  and  the \nundeveloped  legal  framework  for  royalty  collection,  the  costs  of  wheat-breeding  research, \nvariety  testing,  and  initial  phase  of  technology  dissemination  under  the  Project  will  not  be \nrecovered through users\u2019 fees but, indirectly, through taxation of the more productive agriculture \nsector.  Similarly,  expenses  to  develop  and  adapt  improved  farming  practices  (laser  land \nleveling, reduced tillage, direct seed drilling, and alternative crop rotation) by AIME and CAIIR, \nand pest monitoring by PPI will not be directly recovered through users\u2019 fees. To help establish \nthe RBACs, the Project will pay for their operating costs in the first two years of their operation.  \n \nC. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\nThe  Project  will  help  improve  the  standard  of  living  in  the  project  area  by  reducing \n58. \nhousehold vulnerability to food shortages, creating jobs, and improving incomes. An estimated \n217,000  rural  people,  at  least  31%  poor,  are  estimated  to  directly  benefit  from  the  Project. \nPoverty incidence is highest in Kashkadarya, at 63%, or more than twice the national average of \n\n                                                 \n18  Comprehensive  repair  is  estimated  to  cost  $906  per  hectare.  Actual  cost,  however,  may  be  lower  depending  on \n\nfarmers\u2019 needs and willingness to pay.  \n\n\f16 \n\n28%.  Djizak  also  has  a  poverty  incidence  slightly  higher  than  national  average,  at  30%.  The \nmore  fertile  and  better  irrigated  Tashkent  and  Syrdarya  have  lower  poverty  incidence  rates  at \n17% and 8%, respectively.  \n \nA  participatory  rural  assessment  in  the  project  area  suggested  that  the  most \n59. \nimpoverished rural families are those that provide semiskilled and unskilled labor to shirkat and \nprivate farms. These families suffer from a lack of jobs; low wages; delayed wage payment; and \ndeclining  availability  of  rural  social services  (school,  clinics, and  water  supply)  that used  to  be \nprovided by their shirkats.19 On farms that are less productive and have difficulties meeting their \nwheat procurement quotas, workers are particularly vulnerable as they have little wheat for their \nown  consumption  or  for  sale  to  the  local  market  after  their  farms  meet  their  quotas.  The \nincidence  of  poverty  is  consequently  higher  where  land  is  less  productive,  such  as  in \nKaskadarya  and  Djizak.  Other  vulnerable  groups  are  households  with  one  income  earner,  no \noff-farm  employment  skills,20  and  those  with  handicapped  and  elderly  members.  Because  of \nlimited  alternative  livelihood  options,  low-income  families  are  ironically  the  most  dependent  on \ntheir household (backyard) plots, which were allocated by local governments. These households \ndevote more than half their income to food. Less impoverished households are those that have \naccess to nonagricultural employment or reside near urban areas, and thus are able to cultivate \nfruits and vegetables for cash income. \n \nImproved  wheat  production  in  the  project  area  will  benefit  farm  workers  in  the  private \n60. \nand  shirkat  farms  as  higher  production  will  result  in  higher  surpluses  over  and  above  state \nprocurement  quotas.  Incremental  yield  increases  of  0.30\u20130.40  t/ha  envisaged  by  2008  will, \nconservatively,  raise  calorie  supply  by  182\u2013505  calories  per  person  per  day,  or  9\u201324%  of  the \nfood-based  poverty  threshold  of  2,100  calories  per  person  per  day,  used  as  the  regional \nbenchmark. Envisaged incremental increase in calorie availability per person is greater for the \nrain-fed farms, at 346\u2013505 calories per person per day, compared to the irrigated shirkat farms, \nat  182\u2013386  calories  per  person  per  day,  suggesting  that  the  poorer  farms  and  households  in \nrain-fed and irrigation deficit areas will particularly benefit from the project interventions. \n  \n61. \nSome 30\u201370% of rural households in Kashkardya, Samarkand, and Djizak grow wheat \nin their backyard plots to ensure food supply. The urban and rural poor (e.g., retirees and the \nunemployed) not employed by the private and shirkat farms will likewise benefit from the use of \nimproved  wheat  varieties  grown  in  their  dekhan  and  backyard  plots.  Because  of  intensive \nmanagement, wheat yield in backyard plots is on average 60% higher than in shirkats. The main \nproject benefits to backyard farm operators will be wheat that is resistant to pests and diseases, \nand  provides  better  flour  quality.  Project  interventions  to  improve  wheat  yields  are  pro-poor \nbecause poor families derive most of their calorie intake from staple food.  \n \n62. \nThe  Project  will  also  increase  seasonal  farm  employment.  In  irrigated  areas,  higher \nwheat  yield  will  allow  substitution  of  wheat  for  cotton  and  vegetable,  which  cultivation  is  more \nlabor intensive. Improved resistance and enhanced soil fertility management for rain-fed wheat \nwill also stabilize wheat cultivation areas in the less irrigable and rain-fed lands. The Project is \nestimated to generate an additional 42,500 person-months of employment per annum by 2008. \nThe most significant gender impact of the Project will be increased demand for weeding in rain-\n\n                                                 \n19 Rural residents in the project area have poorer access to basic social services than urban inhabitants, with children \non average having longer (three years) schooling. Access to drinking water, sanitation, and heating gas is likewise \nsubstantially lower in rural areas \n\n20 Wage rates in the communications sector in 2000, for instance, were 185% of those in agriculture. In real terms an \nagricultural  worker  on  a  shirkat  farm  receives  the  equivalent  of  SUM3,500  per  month,  not  accounting  for  wage \narrears. While workers on private farms do not necessarily receive higher wages, they are usually paid on time. \n\n\f \n \n\n17\n\n \n\nfed  wheat  farms  and  for  cotton  harvesting  in  irrigated  areas  in  the  spring  and  summer\u2014tasks \nusually  performed  by  women  and  young  adults.  A  consultative  approach  to  extension  will  be \nadopted  to  ensure  that  women  participate  in  the  project  activities  such  as  farm  extension  and \ndemonstration. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n63. \nThe Project is expected to improve soil and water quality in the project area. Introduction \nof  sustainable  crop  rotation  regimes  such  as  combination  of  legumes  and  wheat,  balanced \nfertilizer  application,  and  minimum  soil  tillage  techniques  will  help  improve  soil  structure  and \nfertility,  and  conserve  moisture.  Improved  on-farm  drainage  will  reduce  soil  salinity.  Due  to \nfinancial  stringency  in  the  past  decade,  agrochemical  and  machinery  use  have  fallen \nconsiderably. Therefore, potential adverse impacts of having more fertilizer and farm machinery \nare expected to be negligible. The sales of fertilizers and agrochemicals by the project ASCs at \nmarket prices will not likely to result in an overuse of these farm inputs.  \n \nA potential adverse risk may arise from repairing drainage facilities in the seed-growing \n64. \nareas  in  the  project  districts.  To  reduce  salinity  level,  soil  will  be  leached  with  irrigation  water \nonce drainage is improved. Leaching could increase salt release to surrounding rivers and water \nbodies. The risk will be mitigated by helping the SCNP monitor the release of drainage water by \nfarmers  and  test  the  on-  and  off-farm  soil  and  water  quality.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental \nassessment  also  recognized  that  introducing  drought-resistant  wheat  varieties  may  result  in \nexpanding  wheat  cultivation  to  grassland  and  marginal  land  in  the  medium  and  long  term.  As \nUzbekistan  has  developed  zone  maps  that  satisfactorily  distinguish  cultivable,  grass,  and \nmarginal  lands,  the  Project  will  enhance  field  monitoring  of  farm  expansion.  This  task  will  be \nperformed by the State Committee for Land Resources. \n \n65. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  neutral  to  positive  environmental  impact  on  the \ndesertification and salinization of the Aral Sea region.  The Aral Sea, in Western Uzbekistan, is \nfed  by  the  Amudarya  and  Syrdariya  rivers.  Decreasing  stream  flows  because  of  excessive \ndiversion of the river water has resulted in the desiccation of the sea.  Project interventions, in \nthe upstream reaches of the two rivers, such as direct seeding, minimum tillage, alternate furrow \nirrigation, and land leveling, will help reduce water demand. The project interventions, combined \nwith  implementation  of  a  sustainable  and  enforceable  water  sharing  agreement  among  local \nadministrations  and  countries  in  the  region,  would  contribute  to  substantial  reduction  of  water \ndiversion in the Aral Sea basin. An initial environmental examination report for the Project is in \nSupplementary Appendix H. \n \nE. \n\nProject Risks \n\nA  number  of  factors  may  hamper  project  implementation  and  sustainability  of  benefit \n66. \nimpacts. Economic and agriculture policies remain deficient, including overvaluation of the local \ncurrency,  which  has  undervalued  agricultural  commodity  prices,  subsidized  farm  inputs,  and \nconstrained  enterprise  access  to  foreign  currencies  and  imported  goods.  The  project  financial \nanalysis shows that project investments will be sustainable under the current policy environment \nwith  reforms  in  the  wheat  and  wheat  seed  procurement  system  (para.  52).  The  project  crop \nbudget  analysis  showed  that  liberalizing  the  exchange  rate  restrictions,  which  will  devalue  the \nsum, will raise net farm incomes because the resulting increase in the cotton and wheat prices \nwill more than compensate for the rise in the farm input costs. To ensure that private ASCs and \nseed companies can operate competitively, the Government has agreed to ensure that they will \n\n\f18 \n\nhave  access  to  imported  goods  and  foreign  exchange  equal  to  that  given  to  state-owned  or  -\ncontrolled enterprises (para. 70).     \n \n67. \nThe  policy  to  maintain  high  wheat  outputs  could  weaken  the  domestic  market  price  of \nwheat  and  has  imposed  substantial  budgetary  costs  on  the  state.  The  Government  has  thus \nadopted measures to lower aggregate wheat production by lowering grain procurement quotas \n(para. 10). The Government is reviewing alternative mechanisms and policies to stabilize wheat \nprices  and output  in  a market  context.  To  this  end,  the  service  of  a  grain  policy  expert  will  be \nprovided under the TA associated with the Project to help analyze international best practices in \ngrain price stabilization policies (paras. 49\u201350).   \n \n68. \nAADP\u2019s experience suggests that implementation issues experienced during the earlier \nyears of ADB operation in Uzbekistan (1996\u20132000), such as shortage of counterpart funds and \ninadequate cooperation among agencies, have been addressed by the Government and are not \nlikely to hamper project implementation. To mitigate potential project implementation risks, the \nProject  will  provide  adequate  staff  training  and  consultant  inputs  to  RRA,  RBACs,  research \ninstitutes,  and  regulatory  agencies  to  ensure  that  these  entities  can  deliver  the  envisaged \nproject  outputs.  Activities  of  the  institutes  and  agencies  will  be  coordinated  by  sub-working \ngroups  under  the  PWG  to  ensure  accountability  for  project  resources.  The  project  institutional \narrangements were also developed to ensure that the tasks assigned to agencies coincide with \ntheir  mandates,  thus  ensuring  the  institutionalization  of  capacity  building  gained  under  the \nProject.  To  mitigate  delays  in  project  implementation,  training  in  ADB  operational  policies  and \nprocedures  has  been  and  will  be  provided  to  RRA  and  PMO  staff.  Job  descriptions  and \nqualification  requirements  have  also  been  developed,  and  RRA  gave  the  assurance  that \nqualified  staff  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  assigned  to  the  PMOs,  PSOs  and  PWG  to  support \nproject implementation. \n  \n\nVI.  ASSURANCES \n\nAs a condition of loan effectiveness, COM will adopt a resolution determining that: \n\n69. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCommencing from the cropping season of 2004, the obligatory state procurement \nquotas  for  wheat  will  not  exceed  8,900  tons  for  Kuyi  Chirchik,  7,000  tons  for \nZamin,  and  6,800  tons  for  Katakurgan.  Farms  and  individual  farmers  will  be \nentitled to sell their above-quota wheat to buyers at market prices or to the state \nat prices agreed on by farmers and the state.  \n\nCommencing from the cropping season of 2004, the obligatory state procurement \nquotas  for  wheat  seed  will  not  exceed  445  tons  for  Kuyi  Chirchik,  350  tons  for \nZamin, and 340 tons for Katakurgan. Farms and individual farmers will be entitled \nto sell their above-quota wheat seeds to buyers at market prices or to the state at \nprices agreed on by farmers and the state. \n\nEach agricultural enterprise or farm in the project districts shall be responsible on \nan individual basis to meet the procurement quotas assigned to the enterprise or \nfarm. \n\nExcept for the procurement quotas outlined in items (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, \nrestrictions will not be imposed with regard to the buyers and the terms of sale of \nwheat and wheat seeds to be sold by the agricultural enterprises and farms in the \nproject districts. \n\n\f19\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(v) \n\nA PSC will be established, and its composition determined. \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n \n70. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn procuring wheat and wheat seeds, the Government will ensure that farmers in \nthe project areas receive their advance preproduction financing on time, and final \npayments  for  wheat  and  wheat  seeds  will  be  remitted  within  three  months  after \ncrop delivery.    \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Government will review annually the state procurement prices for wheat and \nwheat  seeds  to  ensure  that  any  price  adjustments  fully  reflect,  for  each  quality \ngrade,  variations  in  international  prices,  changes  in  exchange  rates,  and \nreasonable  charges  for  processing  and  marketing  costs  of  wheat  and  wheat \nseeds.   \n\nThe  Government  will  promote  private  sector  participation  in  the  production  and \nmarketing  of  wheat  and  wheat  seeds  and  will  facilitate  the  establishment  of \nprivately  owned  ASCs  and  seed  companies.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \nlicenses  or  other  approvals  will  not  be  required  to  establish  and  operate  ASCs, \nexcept  to  certify  their  compliance  with  sanitary  and  environmental  regulations. \nThe Government will facilitate and streamline approvals and issuance of licenses \nto establish seed companies.  \n\nThe Government will ensure fair market competition between the privately owned \nASCs or seed companies and state- and local government-owned or -controlled \nenterprises. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  ASCs  and  seed  companies  in  the  project \ndistricts will be given equal access to supply of necessary materials on the same \nterms as any state-owned or -controlled enterprise. In particular, the Government \nwill  ensure  that  ASCs  and  seed  companies  will  have  access  to  agrochemicals, \nfuel,  spare  parts,  and  foreign  exchange  on  terms  not  less  favorable  than  those \napplicable to any state-owned or -controlled enterprises.   \n\nThe Government will not restrict where ASCs and seed companies may operate, \nor  their  ability  to  competitively  procure  their  inputs  and  sell  their  products  and \nservices  within  and  outside  their  districts.  In  marketing  wheat  seeds,  seed \ncompanies will give due consideration of MAWR\u2019s recommendations on the agro-\nclimatic suitability of wheat varieties. \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  abolish  by  31  December  2005  all  direct  and  indirect \nsubsidies to state-owned or -controlled machine and tractor parks in the project \ndistricts. \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  not  interfere  with  business  decisions  of  ASCs  and  seed \ncompanies.  The  Government  will  not  regulate  the  prices  of  farm  inputs  and \noutputs  and  preproduction  financing  terms  between  farmers  and  ASCs  and  the \nseed  companies,  and  will  allow  seed  companies  and  other  private  agricultural \nenterprises  to  determine  prices  freely  based  on  market  conditions.  State  seed \n\n\f20 \n\n \n \n\nprocurement prices will apply to seed quotas allocated to seed companies in the \nproject districts. Quotas are limited to those referred to in para. 69.  \n\nVII.

Of the total arable \n1. \narea  of  4  million  hectares  (ha),  3.7  million  ha  are  devoted  to  irrigated  agriculture,  and  the \nremaining to rain-fed production. A high proportion of agricultural production is concentrated in \nthe  fertile  irrigated  area in  the  central  and  eastern  regions of  the  country,  while  rain-fed  areas \nare mostly used for grain production. Crops comprise 60% of agriculture output, by value, with \ncotton  and  wheat  as  two  major  commodities;  and  livestock,  40%.  About  56%  of  the  country\u2019s \n25.6 million people live in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for about 28% of the gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), 44% of employment, and 60% of export revenues.  \n \n2. \nAgriculture development of independent Uzbekistan has centered around three strategic \nthrusts: (i) generate foreign exchange earnings\u2014mainly through the sale of cotton, (ii) improve \nfood security, and (iii) improve social stability and rural incomes. As a part of the former Soviet \nUnion (FSU), Uzbekistan was the largest producer of cotton, fruits, and vegetables. About 70% \nof its total irrigated land was allocated to cotton. Fodder crops (e.g., alfalfa and legumes) were \ngrown  in  rotation  with  cotton  and  supported  limited  livestock  production.  During  the  1990s \nUzbekistan  gradually  increased  wheat  production  while  maintaining  the  level  of  cotton \nproduction.  In  1993\u20132000  cotton-fodder  crop  rotation  was  slowly  replaced  by  cotton-wheat \nrotation.  Fodder  crop  area  fell  from  1.0  million  to  0.5  million  ha,  while  cotton  area  fell  slightly \nfrom  1.70  million  to  1.45  million  ha.  In  contrast,  the  area  under  wheat  rose  from  0.7  million  in \n1993 to a peak of 1.5 million ha in 1997, before declining to 1.3 million ha by 2002. Aside from \nfarmers\u2019 concern over food security, expansion of the wheat growing area was driven by (i) the \nimposition  of  rising  government  mandatory  production  targets  and  procurement  quotas  on \nwheat  (para.  7);  (ii)  weakening  cotton  prices;  and  (iii)  declining  irrigation  supply  during  the \nsummer  months,  which  has  made  cotton  production  increasingly  risky.  Accompanying  the \nexpansion  in  growing  area,  wheat  yield  rose  from  0.9  tons  (t)  per  ha  to  3.8  t/ha.  The  yield \nimprovement  was  largely  attributed  to  the  shift  of  cultivation  area  from  rain-fed  into  irrigated \nareas  and  improving  farmers\u2019  skills  in  grain  cultivation.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  total  wheat  output  rose \nfrom 0.6 million to 4.7 million tons in 1993\u20132002, and the country is self-sufficient in wheat.  \n \nB. \n\nStructure of Farms \n\nIn  the  early  1990s  Uzbekistan's  agriculture  was  still  dominated  by  collective  and  state \n3. \nfarms, 2,108 of which were in operation in 1991. Average farm size was more than 24,000 ha, \nand  average  number  of  workers  per  farm  was  more  than  1,100.  Urban  and  rural  households \noperated backyard plots, outputs of which were mainly for self-consumption and supplementary \ncash  incomes.  Reforms  in  the  farm  structure  began  in  the  early  1990s  with  the  creation  of \nadditional household plots on the collective farms assigned to the farm employees. Such plots \n(about a third of a hectare in size) are called dehkan farms (Glossary). Both existing backyard \nand  dehkan  plots  produce  most  of  the  country\u2019s  noncommodity  crops,1  and  account  for  about \n11% of cultivated area. \n \n4. \nIn 1998 four laws (the Land Code and laws on private, cooperative, and dehkan farms) \nwere  introduced.  The  new  laws  facilitated  restructuring  of  the  state  and  collective  farms  into \ncooperative  or  shirkat  farms  (Glossary).  A  shirkat  is  organized  by  assessing  assets  of  a \ncollective  farm  and  apportioning  shares  in  their  value  to  farm  members,  who  then  enter  into \n                                                \n \n1  Commodity crops are wheat and cotton. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n\u201cfamily  contracts\u201d  with  the  cooperative  to  produce  crops.  The  shirkat  is  responsible  for  input \nacquisition and sales of farm products. Shirkats\u2019 management structure and style of operations, \nhowever, did not undergone substantive change compared to collective farms. \n \nThe  1998  law  also  facilitated  formation  of  private  farms.  These  differ  from  dehkan  and \n5. \nshirkat  farms  in  scale  (typically  10\u2013100  ha  in  size).  Private  farms  can  either  be  family-  or \ncompany-owned  farms  and  operate  on  long-term  land  leases  (up  to  50-years).  Since  1999, \nshirkats  with  poor  financial  performance  have  been  dissolved  and  transformed  into  private \nfarms.  As of 2002, there were about 72,400 private farms occupying 991,000 ha or 28% of the \ntotal  irrigated  area.  The  various  types  of  farms  and  their  composition  in  irrigated  and  rain-fed \nareas are summarized in Table A2. \n \n\nArea \n \nIrrigated \nRain-feda \nTotal \n\nTable A2: Area, by Farm Type \n(area sown, \u2018000 ha) \nState and Shirkat \n\nAll Farms \n\nPrivate  \n\nDehkan  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n3,541 \n440 \n3,981  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n2,145 \n382 \n2,527  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n991 \n30 \n1,021  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n405 \n28 \n433 \n\n         a   Data as of 2001 \n         Source: Ministry of Economy. \n \n6. \nCreation of the dehkan and private farms has helped improve farm productivity. During \n1996\u20132001, virtually no output growth was observed in the shirkat farms, as a group, whereas \ndehkan and private farms experienced significant output growth.2 During the period, 30% of the \nagricultural  sector  output  growth  was  generated  by  private  farms  and  70%  by  dehkan  farms. \nCrop  yields  of  private  and  dehkan  farms  were  slightly  higher  than  those  of  shirkats,  but  their \nproduction costs were much lower leading to higher farm profitability. Also, labor productivity in \nthe private and dehkan farms were significantly higher. The achievements of private and dehkan \nfarms  have  been  attributed  to  increased  control  of  households  over  farm  resources,  input  use \nefficiency,  and  more  direct  linkage  between  farm  performance  and  household  income.    As  of \n2002,  private  farms  produced  27%  and  38%  of  the  country\u2019s  cotton  and  wheat  production, \nrespectively. \n \nC. \n\nState Order System \n\nThe main mechanism regulating agricultural production and marketing in Uzbekistan has \n7. \nbeen  the  state  order  system.  Up  to  2002,  the  system  had  regulated  cropping  pattern  and \nrequired  farms  to  meet  production  targets  for  cotton  and  wheat.  Production  targets  in  most \ncases,  had  been  set  at  high  levels  achieved  in  the  1980s,  when  the  irrigation  and  drainage \nsystems functioned well. The policy required that 50% of the wheat production targets to be sold \nto  the  state.  This  quantity  is  known  as  the  state  procurement  quota.  State-determined \nprocurement prices were applied to the first 25% of the production target (half of the quota), and \na  price  premium  of  20%  over  and  above  the  procurement  prices  was  paid  to  the  remaining \nvolume  purchased  by  the  state.  Although  farmers  were  free  to  sell  wheat  in  the  domestic \nmarkets  once  they  had  fulfilled  the  state  quotas,  only  about  30%  of  farm  actual  production  is \nusually left for free market sale because actual wheat production had been consistently below \nthe production targets. In the case of cotton. processing (ginning) of raw cotton is still dominated \n\n                                                 \n2  World Bank\u2019s Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) for 2002 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n \n \nby  the  state-owned  enterprises.  As  such,  virtually  all  cotton  is  procured  by  the  state.  Farmers \nreceive financial incentives in the form of additional value derived from cotton by-products.  \n \n8. \nIn  2001\u20132003,  reforms  were  introduced  to  the  state  order  system.  Presidential  Decree \non  Deepening  Reforms  in  the  Agricultural  Sector,  dated  24  March  2003,  directed  the \nGovernment to abolish the state control over cropping pattern.3  The state procurement quotas, \nhowever,  remain  in  place.  As  a  result  of  the  policy  dialogue  under  the  Ak  Altin  Agricultural \nDevelopment Project (AADP)4 and the World Bank\u2019s Rural Enterprise Support Project (RESP), \nprocurement  quotas  for  cotton  and  wheat  were  substantially  lowered  to  about  25%  of  the \nhistorical  production  levels  in  six  pilot  districts.  Based  on  the  agreement  with  the  International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), the Government has agreed in 2002 to reduce the procurement quotas \nfor cotton, nationwide, to 50% of actual, rather than the state-projected production level. In 2002 \nthe  Government  also  began  to  adjust  the  procurement  prices  for  cotton  and  wheat  to  their \ninternational  market  prices,  rather  than  state-estimated  production  costs,  as  practiced  in  the \npast.  The  price  adjustment  resulted  in  72%  and  57%  increases  in  the  wheat  and  cotton \nprocurement prices, respectively, between 2002 and 2003. In line with agreements with the IMF \nand an intention to end the state monopoly in cotton ginning and marketing, in December 2002 \nthe  Government  adopted  a  resolution  to  allow  private  sector  participation  in  cotton  wholesale \nand export. \n \nD. \n\nSector Challenges and Strategy \n\n9. \nDespite gains in wheat output and the reforms adopted, the agriculture sector still faces \nkey  challenges.  Wheat  yields  are  highly  variable,  even  in  identical  agro-ecological  zones. \nbecause  of  the  use  of  imported  varieties.  Wheat  crops  are  susceptible  to  local  pests  and \ndiseases  and  not  adapted  to  the  high  temperature  and  low  humidity  in  the  summer  months. \nBecause of low farm profitability and inefficient delivery of farm inputs, farms are suffering from \nshortages  of  machinery,  fertilizers,  pesticides,  and  other  production  inputs.  Irrigation  and \ndrainage  facilities  are  deteriorating  because  of  funding  shortage.  Further,  overly  centralized \nwheat  seed  production  has  contributed  to  high  transport  costs  and  poor  seed  quality.  Wheat \nfarmers need to be introduced to alternative farming practices, such as reduced tillage, selective \napplication  of  water  and  fertilizers,  reduced  water  application.  and  alternative  crop  rotation \nregimes, to reduce farming costs and improve soil fertility. Finally, the rapid increase in wheat \nproduction has required the allocation of an estimated 0.8 million ha (25%) of well-irrigated land \nfor  wheat  production.  This  approach  sacrifices  the  land\u2019s  economic  potential  for  cultivation  of \nhigher-value crops, such as cotton, vegetables, fruits, and seeds.  \n \nSector reforms adopted in recent years (paras. 4\u20138) have been appropriate to stimulate \n10. \nproductivity and improve farm income. Nonetheless, efforts are needed to ensure that reforms \nadopted  thus  far  are  well  implemented.  Additional  measures  are  required  to  widen  the \ngeographical  coverage  of  reforms  and  deepen  their  scope.  Given  the  dominance  of  state-\nenterprises in farm input supply and agroprocessing, the reduction of procurement quotas and \nincrease in procurement prices should be accompanied by an active facilitation of private sector \nparticipation  in  the  farm  support  services.  This effort  is  necessary  to  promote  competition  and \n\n                                                \n \n3  Crop production targets had been calculated based on the obligatory land allocation to a particular crop (cropping \npattern) and projected yields of crop. Abolition of control on cropping pattern, therefore, should result in abolition of \nthe production targets. \n\n4  ADB.  2001.

To  this  end,  the  sector  must  accelerate  the  introduction  of  wheat  varieties \nadaptable  to  local  conditions  and  support  technology  extension  to  introduce  alternative  wheat \nfarming practices. \n  \nE. \n\nSector Institutions \n\n12. \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR)  is  the  primary  agency \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  agricultural  policies.  Agricultural \nresearch  is  the  responsibility  of  MAWR  and  the  Academy  of  Agricultural  Sciences.  Both \nagencies  are  represented  through  the  Scientific  Production  Center  for  Agriculture  (SPCA), \nwhose director general is a deputy minister of MAWR for science and technology policy. SPCA \nhas  a  network  of  19  commodity-  or  subject-oriented  research  institutes  and  is  responsible  for \nscientific  activities  to  develop  new  wheat  varieties.  The  institutes  have  regional  research \nstations that also provide extension services. SPCA is represented in each province (oblast) by \na small unit that coordinates activities of stations within the oblast and assures communication \nwith the local administration. The main institutes involved in grain varieties development are the \nAndijan/Galla-Aral  Cereals  and  Legumes  Research  Institute  and  Plant  Genetics  Institute. \nTechnology improvements of crop production, covering water and soil management, agricultural \nmechanization, and plant protection are, respectively, undertaken by the Central Asian Institute \nfor  Irrigation  Research,5  Agricultural  Institute  for  Mechanization  and  Electrification,  and  Plant \nProtection Institute. MAWR also houses the State Commission on Varietal Testing which tests \nand approves plant varieties that can be commercially grown in the country. \n \n13.  MAWR\u2019s  Crop  Cultivation  Branch,  with  a  Grains  Production  Department  and  a  Seed \nProduction Department, is primarily responsible for overseeing grain production and facilitating \nthe  subsector  development.  The  branch  is  headed  by  the  first  deputy  minister  of  MAWR.  In \nsupport  of  crop  production,  the  State  Center  for  Seed  Quality  Control  and  Certification  under \nMAWR regulates seed production and marketing. MAWR\u2019s network of district offices, research \nstations,  and  affiliate  state-owned  enterprises  have  traditionally  carried  out  information \ndissemination on new technologies to the collective and shirkat farms. With the growing number \nof  private  and  dehkan  farms,  extension  services  will  increasingly  be  the  responsibility  of  the \nrural business advisory centers (RBACs) that has been established in each district. RBACs are \norganized  under  an  umbrella  national  farmers  association,  the  Association  of  Dehkan  and \nPrivate  Farmers.  Further,  in  line  with  the  agricultural  sector\u2019s  transformation  to  the  market \nsystem, farm extension approach should be transformed from one that is directive and supply-\ndriven to one that is demand-driven and supportive of more independent decision making at the \nfarm level. Under the Economic Branch of MAWR, the Rural Restructuring Agency (RRA) was \nestablished \nfarm  restructuring\u2014and \nfacilitate  agricultural  reform\u2014including \nmanagement of foreign-assisted loan projects. \n \n\nin  1998 \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n5  The  Central  Asian  Institute  for  Irrigation  Research  reports  directly  to  the  Minister  of  Agriculture  and  Water \n\nResources, not the SPCA. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \nF. \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons Learned \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\n14. \nThe  largest  loan  project  in  agriculture  thus  far  is  the  Cotton  Subsector  Improvement \nProject  of  the  World  Bank.6  The  project,  implemented  in  1995\u20132002,  helped  improve  cotton \nseed quality and marketing, and introduce integrated pest management techniques and   new \nirrigation  scheduling  methods  in  cotton  production.  A  series  of  advisory  technical  assistance \nwas provided by the European Union through its Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of \nIndependent  States  program  to  finance  (i)  a  pilot  integrated  area  development  project,  (ii) \nfarmers\u2019  training,  (iii)  establishment  of  a  food  and  agriculture  policy  unit,  (iv)  demonstration  of \nimproved  irrigation  and  soil  management,  (v)  land  registration  improvement,  (vi)  wholesale \nmarket  operations,  and  (vii)  rural  enterprise  development.  Credit  funds  and  capacity-building \nassistance  were  provided  for  agroprocessing  under  ADB\u2019s  Rural  Enterprise  Development \nProject. 7 This assistance was continued under the Small and Medium Enterprise Development \nProject.8 The ongoing AADP, approved in 2001, provides integrated assistance in irrigation and \ndrainage  system  rehabilitation,  capacity  building  of  stakeholders,  information  extension,  and \nestablishment  of  a  farm  machinery  rental  enterprise  in  the  Ak  Altin  district  of  the  Syrdarya \noblast.  RESP  supports  investments  in  irrigation  infrastructure  rehabilitation,  business  advisory \nservices, rural microfinance, and credit line for enterprises providing farm support services. The \nproject  covers \nin  Karakalpakstan,  Andijan,  Kashkadarya,  Tashkent,  and \nSurkhandarya. \n \n15. \nThe International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center under the Consultative Group \non  International  Agricultural  Research  (CGIAR)  has  also  provided  assistance  to  Uzbekistan  in \nwheat varietal improvement through supply of parent breeding materials and technical training. \nWith partial funding of the ADB, the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas \nof  CGIAR  has  also  supervised  pilot  trials  of  alternative  crop  rotations  and  irrigation  and  soil \nmanagement  techniques  that  will  enhance  crop  productivity  with  minimal  incremental  costs  to \nfarmers.  \n \n16. \nExperience  under  these  projects  suggests  that  RRA  and  MAWR  have  the  capacity  to \ncarry  out  integrated  research-  and  production-oriented  projects.  Implementation  of  the  Cotton \nSubsector Improvement Project has built the capacity of MAWR in seed quality control.9 For the \nwheat  subsector,  additional  investment  is  still  required  to  test  and  develop  promising  wheat \nvarieties adaptable for introduction to a wide range of agroclimatic zones and produce adequate \nsupply of foundation seeds. Likewise, improved soil and water management techniques tested \nunder the past and ongoing projects should be disseminated over a wider geographical area.  \n\nfive  districts \n\n                                                \n \n6  The Cotton Sub-sector Improvement Project was approved on 25 May 1995, for $66 million.  \n7  ADB.  1996.

PFI  selection  will  be  approved  by  MOF \nand  ADB.  Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  credit  guidelines  governing  the  detailed \narrangements of onlending from the PFI to the end subborrowers will be drafted and approved \nby  the  Government  and  ADB.  Within  eight  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOF  and  PFIs  will \nenter into subsidiary loan agreements.  \n\nC. \n\nSubborrowers \n\n4. \nApplications for subloans will be considered from private individuals (or groups of private \nindividuals)  and  existing  private  companies  (i)  to  establish  private  sector  ASCs  to  offer  farm \nsupport  services  within  the  project  districts  of  Kuyi-Chirchik,  Zamin,  or  Katakurgan;  or  (ii)  to \nestablish new or expand existing operations of a company producing wheat seeds in the three \ndistricts.  \n\n5. \nThe subborrower must satisfy the following criteria for the duration of the subloan: (i) a \nmaximum projected debt-equity ratio of 80:20, (ii) a projected debt service coverage ratio of not \nless  than  1.3,  and  (iii)  a  current  ratio  of  at  least  1.3.  Subborrowers  will  be  limited-liability \ncorporations  or  open  joint  stock  corporations  or  suitable  form  of  companies  owned  by  private \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31\n\n \n\nparties. Corporations with government equity will not be eligible to receive subloans under the \nProject. \n\n \nD. \n\nSize of Subloans \n\n6. \nFor ASCs, no subloan should be less than $100,000, or more than either $3 million or \n80%  of  the  estimated  subproject  costs  (whichever  is  less),  or  the  equivalent  thereof  in  other \ncurrencies,  calculated  on  the  basis  of  current  rates  of  exchange.  For  the  wheat  seed \ncompanies, no subloan should be less than $50,000, or more than either $1 million or 80% of \nthe estimated subproject costs (whichever is less), or the equivalent thereof in other currencies \ncalculated on the basis of current rates of exchange. \n\nE. \n\nDuration of the Loan \n\nSubsidiary  loans  from  MOF  to  PFIs  will  be  for  a  maximum  of  10  years,  including  a \n7. \nmaximum  4-year  grace  period  on  principal  repayments.  Subloans \nthe \nsubborrowers  will  be  for  a  maximum  period  of  10  years,  including  a  maximum  3-year  grace \nperiod on principal repayments.  \n\nfrom  PFIs \n\nto \n\nF. \n\nTerms of Onlending \n\n8. \nThe interest rate on subloans from MOF to the PFIs will be at no less than the London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus 2%. PFIs should on-lend subloans to subborrowers at real \nmarket interest rates to take into account the cost of funds, administrative costs of providing the \nsubloan, credit risk, and a reasonable amount of profit for the PFIs. Commitment and front-end \nfees of the ADB loan to MOF will be passed on to the PFIs. PFIs will shoulder the credit risk, \nand subborrowers, the foreign exchange rate risk.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A4.1: By Component Project Cost Summary \n\nLocal \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n \n(SUM  million) \nForeign \n \n \n \n1,006.1  \n448.5  \n1,454.7\n \n \n769.5  \n593.4\n \n7,351.8\n \n8,714.6\n \n\n494.1\n1,570.1\n2,060.1\n4,124.3\n\n1,604.5\n611.1\n2,215.6\n\n \n\n  \n\nTotal \n\n  \n% \n\n \n \n  % Total\n \n  Foreign    Base \nCosts\n \n \n \n \n2,610.6\n \n1,059.7\n \n3,670.3\n \n \n1,263.6\n \n2,163.5\n \n9,411.9\n \n12,839.0\n \n\nExchange  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n39\n73\n22\n32\n\n61\n58\n60\n\n4\n7\n31\n42\n\n9\n3\n12\n\n2,720.3\n \n986.2\n \n13,875.8\n \n1,444.4  \n8,663.4  \n23,983.5\n \n\u2014  \n\u2014  \n\u2014  \n\n9,847.5\n632.7\n16,820.1\n1,057.4\n2,618.5\n20,496.0\n4,894.5\n284.7\n149.0\n\n12,567.8\n1,618.9\n30,695.9\n2,501.8\n11,281.9\n44,479.6\n4,894.5\n284.7\n149.0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n78\n39\n55\n42\n23\n46\n100\n100\n100\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n41\n5\n100\n8\n37\n145\n16\n1\n\u2014\n\n2,790.0  \n1,011.5\n \n14,231.5  \n1,481.4\n \n898.5\n \n16,611.5  \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n\u2014\n \n\n3\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n  % Total\n  Base \nCosts \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\nLocal\n \n\n($\u2019000)\n \nForeign \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1,031.9\n460.0\n1,492.0\n\n789.2\n608.6\n7,540.3\n8,938.1\n\n2,677.6\n1,086.8\n3,764.4\n\n \n \n \n1,645.6\n \n626.8  \n2,272.4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1,296.0\n506.8\n2,218.9\n1,610.3\n2,113.0\n9,653.3\n4,230.1 13,168.2\n\n10,100.0 12,890.0\n \n1,660.4\n648.9  \n17,251.4 31,483.0\n \n2,565.9\n1,084.5\n \n1,173.4\n274.9  \n35,222.3\n18,610.8\n \n4,417.0\n4,417.0\n \n230.7\n230.7\n \n130.0\n130.0\n \n\n  \n% \nForeign \nExchange  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n39\n73\n22\n32\n\n61\n58\n60\n\n78\n39\n55\n42\n23\n53\n100\n100\n100\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n58\n\n \n\n9\n3\n12\n\n4\n7\n31\n42\n\n41\n5\n100\n8\n4\n112\n14\n1\n\u2014\n\n127\n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  Item \n \n \n \nA.

The quality-and cost-based selection method \nwill  be  used  in  engaging  the  consulting  firm.  The  banking  experts  will  be  engaged  through \nindividual  contracts  because  of  their  distinct  tasks  and  limited  person-month  inputs.  The \nconsultants will work closely with RRA and MAWR staff and interact frequently with the project \nbeneficiaries,  particularly  on  proposed  interventions  on  the  farms,  such  as  varietal  testing, \nwheat  breeding,  and  demonstration  plots.  The  consultants  may  be  required  to  perform  tasks \nother  than  those  specified  in  the  outline  terms  of  reference,  determined  as  necessary  by  the \nproject  management  office  (PMO)  to  comply  with  project  requirements.

The  current  financial  regime \nassumed continuing implementation of agricultural policies as of 2003, including adjustment of \nstate  procurement  prices  for  wheat  to  international  prices  and  abolition  of  state  control  of \ncropping pattern at the farm level. The financial analysis also assumed the adoption of reduced \nprocurement  quotas  for  wheat  and  wheat  seed  as  outlined  in  the  project  assurances.  For  the \ncrop  budget  analysis,  as  of  October  2002  the  state  procurement  prices  for  wheat  and  cotton \nwere estimated at 30% and 52% below their economic parity prices, respectively, while traded \nagrochemicals are 27\u201335% below their economic prices. The divergence between the financial \nand economic prices has been derived mainly from the estimated divergence of the official and \nmarket  exchange  rates.  A  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.3  was  used.1  Wheat  seed  prices \nare calculated at 50\u2013200% over the commercial grain prices, depending on genetic purity. Local \nmarket  prices  for  wheat,  for  above-quota  sales  by  farmers,  were  estimated  at  20%  over  the \nstate  procurement  prices  as  in  2001\u20132002.  Liberalized  policy  environment  assumes  the \nconvergence  of  financial  prices  toward  economic  prices  and  termination  of  the  procurement \nquota system.  \n\nB. \n\nComparative Analysis on Wheat Production \n\nTo assess the attractiveness of wheat cultivation under the current and liberalized policy \n2. \nenvironments, financial and economic gross profits of 11 crops grown in Central Asia, including \nwheat, have been estimated. Sustainable crop rotation schemes were also considered for crops \nin  three  main  cultivation  areas:  well-irrigated,  irrigation-deficit  (Glossary),  and  rain-fed  areas. \nThe  assessment  showed  that  wheat  on  average  generates  positive  farm  incomes  in  the  three \ngrowing  areas  (Table  A9.1).  In  the  irrigation-deficit  area,  wheat  provides  the  highest  financial \nand  economic  returns  among  the  crops  evaluated.  In  the  rain-fed  system,  crops  with  limited \ndemand,  such  as  chickpeas,  sesame,  and  safflower  provide  higher  return  than  wheat.  Due  to \ntheir  drought  tolerance,  chickpeas  and  safflower  can  be  grown  in  rotation  with  wheat  to \nmaximize and stabilize farm incomes. On well-irrigated land, wheat generates less income than \ncotton; vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, and onions); wheat seed; and fodder crops. Depending \non  farmers\u2019  preference,  irrigated  wheat  can  be  grown  in  rotation  with  cotton,  but  this  rotation \ncannot be sustained for many years as it will result in the deterioration of soil and yields of both \ncrops.  Overall  the  assessment  concluded  that  wheat  is  a  financially  and  economically  an \nattractive  crop,  particularly  for  irrigation-deficit  and  rain-fed  areas.2  Households  with  backyard \nplots  and  private  farms  with  good  irrigation  also  cultivate  wheat  for  food  security  and  income \nstabilization.  \n\nC. \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\n1.  Financial Analysis at Farm Level \n\n3. \nIn  Kuyi  Chirchik,  Zamin,  and  Katakurgan  districts,  irrigated  wheat  areas  in  2002  were \n13,455,  14,551  and  8,874  hectares  (ha),  respectively.  No  rain-fed  wheat  is  grown  in  Kuyi \n\n                                                 \n1  The price divergence on cotton is higher due to additional value added tax on cotton ginning (processing). \n2  Estimated size of irrigation-deficit areas in each oblast is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nChirchik,  while  rain-fed  wheat  in  Zamin  and  Katakurgan  covered  6,100  and  2,800  ha, \nrespectively.  The  area  planted  to  wheat  in  the  five  project  oblasts  of  Djizak,  Kashkadarya, \nSamarkand, Syrdarya, and Tashkent totaled 852,700 ha. In the oblasts, wheat production from \nirrigated areas (excluding backyard plots) was 1.40 million tons (t) from 559,700 ha, or 2.42 t/ha, \nand under rain-fed conditions, 175,800 t from 293,000 ha, or 0.6 t/ha. \n\nTable A9.1: Financial and Economic Crop Gross Margins  \n(constant 2002 prices) \n\nCrop \n \n  \n\nGrowing Area \n \n  \n\nIrrigation \nRequirement \n(\u2018000 m3) \n\nGross Margins per Hectare \nEconomic  \nFinancial  \n(SUM) \n(SUM) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \n3.5 \n2.5 \n2.5 \n1.5 \n2.5 \n3.5 \n4.0 \n5.0 \n8.0 \n10.2 \n\nRain-fed \nRain-fed \nRain-fed \nRain-fed \nRain-fed \nID \nID/WI \nID/WI \nID/WI \nWI \nWI \nWI \nWI \nWI \nWI \n\nWheat  \nChickpea \nSesame \nSafflower \nAlfalfa  \nCotton \nWheat  \nGrain Maize \nForage Maize \nWheat Seed  \nCotton \nAlfalfa  \nPotatoes \nTomatoes \nOnions \n\n44,437 \n60,080 \n162,427 \n53,135 \n19,012 \n(27,426) \n220,550 \n170,323 \n202,012 \n578,850 \n266,283 \n \n404,297 \n  1,362,416 \n \n767,226 \n  1,627,426 \n    ID = irrigation deficit, m3 = cubic meters, NA = not applicable, WI = well irrigated. \n    Source: Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates. \n \n4. \nFarm  structures  considered  from  the  financial  analysis  differ  markedly.  Farm  models \nhave  been  prepared  to  represent  small  and  large  private  farm  operations  under  rain-fed  and \nirrigated conditions. Representative small and large rain-fed farms are 100 and 1,000 ha in size, \nrespectively. Small and large irrigated farms are 10 and 300 ha, respectively.  \n\n21,930 \n44,079 \n124,118 \n(18,991) \n(21,396) \n (38,293) \n273,048 \n519,777 \n(5,179) \n998,848 \n510,122 \n240,675 \n583,096 \n \n634,729 \n  1,588,850 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n \n\n5. \nFor the financial analysis the following were assumed, irrespective of farm size: (i) with \nproject interventions, wheat yields will increase linearly to expected full development levels over \n10 years; (ii) besides annual crops, farms grow horticultural crops on 0.25 ha for small rain-fed \nfarms  and  1.00  ha  for  large  irrigated  farms;  (iii)  fixed  costs  (electricity,  building  maintenance, \ntaxes, and insurance) are part of farm costs. The costs of production credit have been built into \nthe crop budgets as part of the variable costs.  \n\n6. \nUnder  rain-fed  conditions,  adoption  of  improved  and  sustainable  cropping  systems  (a \nrotation  of  wheat  and  chickpea),  coupled  with  better  availability  of  fertilizers  and  progressive \nintroduction of minimum tillage techniques, will increase average wheat yield from 0.6 t/ha to 1.4 \nt/ha in 10 years (see Table A9.5). In the irrigation deficit areas, the rotation of wheat and cotton, \nwhich  is  recognized  as  unsustainable,  will  be  replaced  by  a  rotation  of  wheat,  alfalfa,  and \ncotton.3  Introduction  of  suitable  wheat  varieties  and  improved  crop  rotation  is  projected  to \nincrease  wheat  yield  from  2.4  t/ha  to  4.6  t/ha  in  a  decade.  This  assumption  is  conservative \nbecause incremental yield increase observed in selected farms have been higher.  \n\n                                                 \n3   Cotton will occupy 20% of the modeled farm area, which will receive adequate irrigation. \n\n\fAppendix 9            \n\n49\n\n \n\nDetails of farm returns for 11 crops are in Supplementary Appendix F. The farm analysis \n7. \nindicates that under rain-fed and irrigation-deficit conditions, farms devoting 71% of their area to \nwheat will realize substantial profit improvements. For the representative 100 ha rain-fed farm, \nnet income will increase from SUM18,940 ($19) to SUM48,830 ($50) per ha in project year 10. \nFor a smaller irrigation-deficit farm with 10 ha, farm income will rise from SUM100,300 ($102) to \nSUM350,700 ($360) per ha in a decade. Similarly, for a well-irrigated farm with 10 ha, incomes \nare projected to rise from SUM204,750 ($210) to SUM357,000 ($365) per ha.  \n\nThe  farms\u2019  gross  margin  increases  took  account  of  adjustments  in  seed  price  and  are \n8. \nadequate  to  cover  costs  of  cultivation  and  harvesting  services  to  be  provided  through  the \nproposed agricultural service centers (ASC) in the focus districts. Similarly, recovery of royalty \npayments  on  super-elite  seed,  sale  of  certified  seeds,  and  recovery  of  costs  for  extension \nmaterials are all considered affordable.  \n\n2.  Financial Analysis of Agricultural Service Centers \n\nASCs  will  be  established  to  provide  competitively  priced  services  to  private  farmers \n9. \ncultivating wheat as part of their crop rotation. ASCs are expected to provide a broad range of \nservices,  including  agricultural  machinery  hire;  workshop  repair  services;  input  supply;  small \nprocessing facilities (e.g., grain milling, oilseed expelling); and transportation services. ASCs will \nbe fully privately owned with equity held by entrepreneurs, farmers, foreign joint ventures, or a \ncombination  of  such  investors.  Subloans  to  approved  borrowers  will  pass  from  the  Ministry  of \nFinance through an approved participating financial institution. Criteria for eligible ASCs are in \nAppendix 3. Assuming diversification of business activities, the model of the pilot ASC analyzed \nfor  the  Project  was  based  on  an  initial  total  investment  of  $3.75  million.  ASCs,  however,  can \nstart as smaller units that will expand as profits accumulate.  \n\n10. \nThe  analysis  of  individual  service  shows  that  ASCs  can  provide  equipment  rental  at \nrates  comparable  with  those  charged  by  state-owned  Machine  and  Tractor  Parks.  The  model \nestimated  that  the  ASC  will  purchase  agricultural  machinery  and  equipment  for  $1.65  million \nequivalent.  The  equipment  rental  service  will  be  complemented  by  equipment  repair  services, \nretails of seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides, small-scale oilseed processing and flour milling, and \ntransport services.  \n\n11. \nFinancial  modeling  of  the  pilot  ACS  has  been  conducted  for  a  25-year  period  for  the \ndiscounted  cash-flow  analysis;  and  for  15  years  for  financial  projections  (i.e.,  balance  sheets, \nincome  statements,  and  source  and  application  of  funds  statements.  The  cash  flow  analysis \nshowed that investment in ASC has a financial internal rate of return of 27.5% and projected net \npresent  value  of  $2.92  million.  Table  A9.2  provides  the  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  results. \nThe  table  also  indicates  the  robustness  of  the  ASC  model.  Even  when  the  total  cost  stream \nincreases  by  10%  and  the  revenue  stream  declines  by  10%,  the  internal  rate  of  return  is  still \n18.71%. \n\n12. \nThe ASC model was also tested in terms of its performance and creditworthiness ratios. \nThe  preparation  of  financial  projections  (loan  repayment  schedule,  balance  sheets,  income \nstatements,  retained  earnings  statement,  source  and  use  of  funds  statement)  for  a  15-year \nperiod  illustrates  ASC\u2019s  ability  to  repay  a  $3.0  million  subloan  over  a  10-year  period  with  a  3-\nyear  grace  on  principal  repayments.  The  analysis  showed  that  ASC  will  satisfy  the  criteria \nestablished for subloans under the project.

Financial Analysis of Seed Companies \n\nThe project supports the establishment of private companies for the production of rain-\n13. \nfed and irrigated wheat seed. These companies would organize the growing and processing of \nsuper-elite,  elite  and  other  certified  wheat  seed  for  sale  to  the  State  or  private  farmers. \nDiscounted  cash  flow  analysis  was  undertaken  for  two  models;  representing  wheat  seed \nproduction  under  irrigated  and  rain-fed  conditions.  Both  models  assume  the  purchase  of  new \nseed  processing  units  with  an  hourly  capacity  of  2.5  tons  for  installation  within  an  existing \nbuilding. Other investment costs are for farm machinery purchases.  \n\nIn  the  case  of  the  irrigated  wheat  seed  company,  it  is  estimated  that  an  investment  of \n14. \n$720,000 will be required. Seeds will be grown on rented land totaling 400 ha. The company is \nexpected to process 2,700 tons of seeds each year with 1,800 tons originating from its rented \n\n\fAppendix 9            \n\n51\n\n \n\nland and balance supplied by other growers under contract. In the case of the rain-fed model, \nthe nucleus farm would total 200 ha, 71.4% of which is planted to wheat each year. Another 200 \nha of wheat land is rented. A total of 2,700 tons of seed will be processed each year with 550 \ntons originating from own and rented land and the balance to be supplied under contract.  \n\nInvestments  in  the  irrigated  and  rain-fed  wheat  seed  companies  is  projected  to  yield \n\n15. \nFIRRs of 34.3% and 20.8%, respectively, with NPVs of $666,100 and $97,970.  \n\nD. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nAssumptions \n\nThe  economic  analysis  has  been  carried  out  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire \n16. \napproach. Adjustments were made to remove transfer charges (i.e., taxes, duties, and interest \ncharges) and to account for a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.30 applied to prices of \ntraded  goods.  In  view  of  the  substantial  unemployment  and  under  employment  in  the  rural \nareas, an average shadow wage rate of 0.8 was also introduced. The economic analysis was \nconducted  over  a  25-year  period  in  2002  constant  prices.  The  economic  farm  gate  prices  of \nwheat were derived on an import parity basis, using Kazakhstan as location of the main wheat \nsource in the region and Russia as the dominant wheat importer/consumer.  \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n17. \nIncremental benefits of the Project were derived from two key components, namely the \nestimated increase in farm income per hectare and the potential expansion of wheat cultivation \narea arising from the project interventions. The increase in per hectare farm income is expected \nto come from the envisaged increase in wheat yields as well as improved farm efficiency in input \nutilization. The gains in farm efficiency will, in turn, come from more timely supply of production \ninputs and machineries, availability of better wheat varieties, and greater awareness of farmers \nof  improved  soil  and  water  management  practices.  Further,  introduction  of  drought  resistant \nwheat varieties and alternative crop rotation schemes will also allow sustainable farming on the \nrain-fed and irrigation deficit areas. \n\n18. \nAs  the  national  concern  over  food  security  eases  and  wheat  yield  per  hectare  rises, \nwheat  growing  area  under  irrigated  conditions  is  expected  to  decline.  To  further  improve \nincome, farmers would allocate more irrigated lands to higher value crops such as cotton, fruits, \nand seeds. Although such a shift in cropping pattern will be made possible only by the Project\u2019s \ntechnical  and  policy  assistance,  the  benefits  of  the  change  in  cropping  pattern  had  not  been \naccounted \nthe  project  benefits  have  been \nfor \nconservatively estimated. \n\nthe  economic  analysis.  Therefore, \n\nin \n\n19. \nSeven representative farm production models were used for the project analysis. Two for \nirrigated  and  rain-fed  areas  that  do  not  receive  project  assistance  (without-project  scenarios). \nFive  for  farms  benefiting  from  the  Project  assistance  (with-project  scenarios).  Among  the  five \nwith-project models, three are for irrigated conditions, for farms adopting (i) improved seeds, (ii) \nimproved  seeds  and  agronomic  practices,  and  (iii)  improved  seeds,  agronomic  practices,  and \nland  leveling  technology.  Two  models  are  for  rain-fed  farms  adopting  (i)  improved  seeds  and \nagronomic  practices  and  (ii)  improved  seeds,  agronomic  practices,  and  direct  seed  drilling \ntechnology. \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 9 \n\n3. \n\nImpact Area \n\n20. \nThe estimated rates of adoption of new technologies for the five with-project production \nscenarios  vary.  On  both  irrigated  and  rain-fed  areas,  it  has  been  conservatively  assumed  that \nadoption of the new technologies will begin in project year three. To simulate the expansion of \nthe project impact area, a two-weighting system was adopted. The first set of weights comprised \npercentages  of  the  wheat  cultivation  area  that  will  participate  or  adopt  the  technologies  to  be \nintroduced under the Project. The second weights estimate the proportions of participating area \nadopting  three  different  production  models,  outlined  in  Section  4.  Table  A9.4  summarizes  the \nbuild up in the area expected to participate in the Project. The speed at which the participating \n(project  impact)  area  expands  depends  mainly  on  the  estimated  dissemination  of  technology \nthrough the State and private extension services and availability of improved seeds. Given that \nthe total potential wheat growing areas in the five project oblasts of 560,000 and 330,000 ha., \nrespectively, for irrigated and rain-fed wheat, the slow rates of expansion in impact areas shown \nin Table A9.4 are considered conservative. \n\nTable A9.4: Participating Areas (ha) \n\nProject Year \n10 \n\n5 \n\nArea \n\n \n\n \nIrrigated Wheat \nKuyi-Chirchik District \nZamin District \nKatakurgan District \n \nTashkent Oblast \nDjizak Oblast \nSamarkand Oblast \nSyrdariya Oblast \nKashkadariya Oblast \n \nRain-fed Wheat \n                    Total  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n  29,300 \n3,500 \n \n3,500 \n \n2,500 \n \n\n \n\n4,300 \n3,450 \n4,300 \n4,300 \n3,450 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n4. \n\nAverage Yields \n\n  273,796 \n13,350 \n \n14,720 \n \n8,962 \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n46,075 \n37,480 \n46,890 \n45,519 \n60,800 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n107,800 \n    7,500 \n     7,500 \n     5,500 \n \n   16,800 \n   13,450 \n   16,800 \n   16,800 \n   23,450 \n\n \n\n25 \n\n273,796 \n13,350 \n14,720 \n8,962 \n\n \n46,075 \n37,480 \n46,890 \n45,519 \n60,800 \n \n329,966 \n603,762 \n\n           Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n5,000 \n  34,300 \n\n   35,000 \n 142,800 \n\n  293,000 \n  566,796 \n\n21. \nAs  noted  in  para.  20,  within  the  participating  area,  yields  are  expected  to  improve  as \nprogress  is  made  in  the  adoption  of  technologies.  This  will  be  reflected  in  the  envisaged \nimprovement  in  wheat  yields  as  shown  in  Table  A9.5.  The  projected  average  irrigated  wheat \nyields in the three project districts are expected to increase to modest levels of 3.2 to 3.8 tons \nper ha in a decade, while in the five project oblasts, average yield improvement in the coming \n10 years is modestly set at 14% over the present level. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9            \n\n53\n\n \n\nTable A9.5: Projected Average Wheat Yields \n\nArea \n\nProject Year \n\n \n \nIrrigated Wheat \nKuyi-Chirchik District \nZamin District \nKatakurgan District \n \nTashkent Oblast \nDjizak Oblast \nSamarkand Oblast \nSyrdarya Oblast \nKashkadarya Oblast \n \nRain-fed Wheat \nProject Area \n\nWithout \nProject \n\n \n \n\n1 \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.0 \n2.4 \n3.1 \n \n3.3 \n2.2 \n2.6 \n2.0 \n2.1 \n \n \n0.60 \n\n3.0 \n2.4 \n3.1 \n \n3.3 \n2.2 \n2.6 \n2.0 \n2.1 \n \n \n0.60 \n\n3.1 \n2.5 \n3.1 \n \n3.3 \n2.4 \n2.8 \n2.0 \n2.1 \n \n \n0.86 \n\n3.8 \n3.2 \n3.8 \n \n3.4 \n2.6 \n3.0 \n2.1 \n2.2 \n \n \n1.35 \n\n5.1 \n4.3 \n4.6 \n \n3.6 \n2.6 \n3.0 \n2.3 \n2.4 \n \n \n1.56 \n\n       Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and ADB estimates. \n\n5. \n\nWheat Production \n\n22. \nBased on the projected impact areas and yields, the projected wheat outputs are shown \nin Table A9.6. Although the project is likely to start during the latter half of 2003, the first benefits \nfrom  the  project  are  likely  to  materialize  beginning  in  2004.

The  estimated  project  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  over  the  25-year \nperiod,  was  estimated  to  be  30.8%.

The attractive EIRR for the \nProject is attributed to relatively low investment costs in relation to the substantial benefits that \nwould result from the use of improved wheat varieties and technologies.  \n\n24. \nThe  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  to  lower  yields,  prices  and  delayed  adoption  of  new \nagronomic  practices  and  technologies  and  increases  in  costs  is  presented  in  Table  A9.7.  The \nanalysis  showed  that  a  60%  increase  in  the  project  costs  would  still  yield  an  EIRR  above  the \n12% hurdle rate. Similarly, the Project will provide robust return even if the benefit streams are \nconfined  only  to  the  incremental  irrigated  wheat  production  from  the  three  focus  districts. \nFurther, the unlikely combination of 25% reduction in wheat gross revenues (either in price or \nyield) and a 25% increase in project costs, only lower the EIRR to 16.4%. The depreciation of \nthe local currency (SUM) as a result of currency convertibility will marginally increase the EIRR \nto 32.7%. \n\nThe  economic  gross  margin  analysis  has  shown  that  the  production  of  rain-fed  wheat \n25. \nunder  the  project  will  progressively  change  from  one  with  a  very  modest  economic  margin  to \none,  which  compares  favorably  with  other  rain-fed  crops  as  the  efficiency  of  production \nincreases. In general, the sensitivity analysis highlights the overall economic robustness of the \nProject.  \n\nScenario \n\nTable A9.7: Sensitivity Analysis on Economic Return \n \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\nBase Case \nSensitivity Analysis Scenario \nBenefits are confined to incremental irrigated wheat output from focus \ndistricts, combined with a 60% increase in project cost \nWheat prices or yield decline by 25%  \nCosts increase by 25% and project benefits decline of 25% \nTwo year delay in benefit realization \nConvertibility of the SUM (SERF lowered from 1.3 to 1.0)  \nSwitching Values \n% decline in project benefits needed to lower EIRR to 12% \n% increase in costs needed to lower EIRR to 12% \n\u2014 = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, SERF = shadow exchange rate \nfactor. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n30.8 \n \n \n12.9 \n17.6 \n16.4 \n27.4 \n32.7 \n \n  40.0 \n470.0 \n\nNPV \n(SUM \nmillion) \n  155,737 \n \n \n1,935 \n \n59,980 \n \n \n49,605 \n  135,488 \n  167,332 \n \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n\fAppendix 10  \n\n55\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nA.  \n \nSector Identified as a National Priority in Country Poverty Analysis: \n \nThe Government has yet to develop a poverty assessment and a national strategy for poverty reduction. \nThe  most  comprehensive  poverty  assessment  conducted  to  date,  Uzbekistan  Living  Standards \nAssessment:  Policies  to  Improve  Living  Standards  (May  2003),1  estimated  national  poverty  level  at \n27.5% (22.5% and 30.5% for urban and rural areas, respectively). The study estimated that 70% of the \npoor reside in the rural areas. Since the living standards assessment used a food-based poverty line,2 \nthe  study  suggested  that  about  4.8  million  rural  residents  are  unable  to  meet  their  basic  food \nrequirement. \n \nTherefore, efforts to improve food production, rural incomes, and access to food\u2014through interventions \nin  agriculture\u2014are  key  to  poverty  reduction.  The  national  strategy,  as  outlined  in  the  Program  for \nStrengthening Reforms in Agriculture of 1998, outlines the roles of agricultural sector to ensure (i) the \nnational food security and (ii) sustained economic growth and social stability. Farming is the dominant \neconomic activity. Since independence in 1991, the Government has placed a high priority on increasing \nwheat production, as the main initiative to ensure food security.  \n \n \nContribution of the Sector/Subsector to Reduce Poverty in Uzbekistan: \n \nThe  agricultural  sector  contributed  28%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  60%  export \nearnings,  and  44%  employment.  The  wheat  subsector  provides  23%  of  agriculture\u2019s  GDP  and  is  the \nmain staple of the country.  \n \nWheat is the second most widely produced crop in the country next to cotton, and provides more than \n50% of calorie intake of the average household. Remote and double landlocked, Uzbekistan needs an \nassured wheat supply to ensure social stability. Aside from land expansion devoted to wheat cultivation \nin the past decade, the Government allotted and encouraged the provision of garden plots from large-\nscale farms to rural farm households partly to enable households to ensure access to wheat production \nthrough  own  production  and  partly  to  compensate  for  the  low  incomes  and  limited  jobs  in  the \ncountryside.  However,  the  10-year  experience  of  increasing  wheat  production  largely  through  shifting \nland  use  from  cotton  and  fodder  crops  to  wheat  has  become  more  difficult  to  sustain  due  to  the \ndeleterious  effect  of  this  approach  on  soil  fertility.  The  Government  has  thus  decided  to  try  a  different \nroute  of  attaining  food  security.  Specifically,  current  wheat  production  levels  will  be  sustained  by \nimproving  productivity  levels  obtained  in  the  irrigation-deficit  (Glossary)  and  rain-fed  areas.  This  will \nsubsequently enable large farms as well as the private, dehkan, and garden plots to free the fertile well-\nirrigated lands from wheat cultivation for higher value crops, thereby ensuring more efficient utilization of \nscarce  land  and  water  resources.  This  approach  is  pro-poor  in  that  the  cultivation  of  cash  crops  in \nirrigated and fertile lands and wheat production in less irrigable and rain-fed areas will still address the \nfood  supply  needs  of  the  rural  poor  and,  more  important,  improve  their  chances  of  diversifying  their \nincome sources and job opportunities. In the medium term, as wheat varieties are improved to address \ndifferent  natural  environment  challenges,  institutional  capacity  will  be  built  to  ensure  more  efficient \nextension  service  delivery  and  to  enable  farmers  to  actively  participate  in  the  selection  of  appropriate \ntechnologies to be introduced in the sector. \n \nThrough the release of wheat varieties better adapted to production under irrigation deficit and rain-fed \nconditions,  the  risks  associated  with  wheat  yield  fluctuation  will  be  reduced,  so  helping  provide  more \nstable incomes for farmers, which is particularly important for the more vulnerable rural groups. Adoption \n                                                 \n1  Document of the World Bank. \n2  The poverty threshold used in the study was based on the required 2,100 calories per person per day used in many \ncountries. The food  poverty line  was estimated at SUM3,601 per month in 2000 constant prices. This  was about \n50% higher than the minimum wage in 2000. \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nof improved and sustainable cropping systems for wheat will also safeguard the fertility of the soil and \nlimit  the  risk  of  environmental  degradation.  New  technologies  for  raising  the  productivity  of  wheat \ncultivation will also lead to the creation of sustainable jobs in agriculture and the related service sector. \nThe  number  of  jobs  created  in  the  two-month  harvesting  period  in  the  project  areas  will  total  2,750 \npersons  for  irrigated  and  18,500  persons  for  rain-fed  wheat  areas.  There  will  also  be  additional  jobs \ncreated in relation to improved cotton production in irrigation-deficit areas following the adoption of new \ncrop rotations allowing the more efficient use of limited water resources. \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nProposed Classification: Pro-Poor Growth \n\n \nB. \n \nThe total number of rural poor beneficiaries in the project areas is estimated at 69,000, of whom 55% \nreside in Kashkadarya, 16% in Djizak, 14% in Samarkand, 9% in Tashkent, and 6% in Syrdariya (Table \nA10).  Poverty  incidence,  by  headcount,  is  highest  in  Kashkadarya  at  62.6%,  more  than  twice  the \nnational average of 27.5%. Djizak also recorded slightly higher than national average poverty incidence \nat  29.7%.  The  more  fertile  and  well-irrigated  areas  of  Tashkent  and  Syrdarya  have  lower  poverty \nincidence rates of 16.9% and 8.4%, respectively. Almost all poor rural households are shirkat (Glossary) \nemployees and dekhan (Glossary) plot operators, and less than 1% are private farmers. \n \n\nArea \n\nTashkent \n\nSyrdarya \n\nDjizak \n\nSamarkand \n\nKashkadariya \n\n            Total \n\nTable A10: Rural Poor Beneficiaries by Oblast \n\nFarm \nHouseholds \n\n          % \n\n        Rural Poor  \nHouseholds\n\n         % \n\n      HCR \n\n36,794 \n\n46,412 \n\n37,443 \n\n36,348 \n\n16.90\n\n21.32\n\n17.20\n\n16.70\n\n60,689 \n217,686 \n\n27.88\n100.00\n\n         6,218 \n\n          3,899 \n\n       11,121 \n\n         9,596 \n\n37,991\n68,825\n\n9.03 \n\n5.66 \n\n16.16 \n\n13.94 \n\n55.20 \n100.00 \n\n16.9 \n\n8.4 \n\n29.7 \n\n26.4 \n\n62.6 \n31.5 \n\n        HCR = head count ratio. \n \nOf  the  three  types  of  poor  farm  households,  households  employed  by  the  shirkats  are  the  most \nimpoverished while private households are the least. The Government\u2019s family budget survey conducted \nin 2000 revealed that the per capita expenditures of private and dehkan farms are higher than those of \nthe shirkats by about a factor of 1.4. Around two thirds of the shirkat households\u2019 expenditures are spent \nessentially  on  food  items,  in  contrast  to  53%  and  48%  for  dehkan  and  private  farm  households, \nrespectively.  \n \nLow profitability of shirkat farms and limited job opportunities in the countryside are the main causes of \nrural poverty in the project oblasts. In the case of shirkat employee households, inadequate and delayed \nsalary payment is the major source of income instability. The nationwide agricultural reforms have also \nreduced  public  sector  employment  in  farm  enterprises.  The  lack  of  employment  opportunities  in  rural \nareas will likely become more severe under the present population growth rate and progressive shirkat \nprivatization. In 1991\u20131999, agriculture output declined by 3.1% while the rural workforce expanded by \nalmost 25%. Assessments from participatory approaches have placed underemployment as high as 40\u2013\n70%  on  the  shirkat  farms.  It  was  estimated  that  14%  of  the  able-bodied  household  members  in  the \nsampled  dehkan  farms  are  unemployed;  in  the  shirkat  households,  unemployment  is  10%,  while \nunemployment in the private farm households is 5%. Private and shirkat farms are the major sources of \non-farm  employment;  in  the  latter,  permanent  workers  average  less  than  60%  of  their  workforce \nindicating the ready supply of casual workers. In the garden plots, farm works are mostly performed by \nhousehold members; the plots rarely generate additional jobs for non-household members. According to \nthe Family Budget Survey (2000), the labor force participation rate among men, using the International \nLabour Organization definition, is 60%, for women is only 31%. Cultural factors are likely to be important \nreasons  for  lower  female  participation  rates.  High  fertility  rates  are  also  important.  Women  with  very \n\n\fAppendix 10  \n\n57\n\nyoung children are much less likely to participate in the labor force. An additional child under 5 years old \nreduces  the  female  participation  rate  by  more  than  7  percentage  points.  The  likelihood  of  female \nparticipation  increases,  however,  with  more  members  in  the  household.  This  might  be  because  of  the \nchildcare  support  available  in  larger  families.  Women  usually  perform  multiple  roles  around  the  house \nand house plots\u2014doing housework, rearing children, tending garden plots, fetching water, and providing \nadditional  income  by  weeding  and  harvesting  on  other  farms,  spending  about  50%  of  their  daily  time \nbudget. \n \nIn face of hardships, poor households adopt a variety of coping strategies to enhance their standard of \nliving.  To  augment  their  inadequate  salaries,  shirkat  employees  intensively  farm  their  backyard  plots \n(average  of  0.17  hectare  [ha]).  The  number  of  households  with  plots  has  reached  2.5  million,  and  the \naverage size per family increased from 0.12 to 0.19 ha per family. Income from the garden plots, while \nbetter  than  their  wages,  is  generally  inadequate.  Additional  land  plots  allotted  in  recent  years  are \nsometimes of poor quality and less irrigable; households lack start-up capital to purchase the inputs or to \naccess credit from formal financial institutions; and dekhan and household plot operators in general have \nlimited technical know-how. To augment household income, household members (especially the women \nand  young  adults)  are  also  engaged  in  farm  work  (weeding  and  cotton  harvesting).  Families  residing \nnear urban centers are engaged in off-farm work, mainly trading and services. \n \nTo  reinvigorate  the  farming  sector  and  generate  rural  employment,  since  1998  the  Government  has \ninitiated  a  farm  restructuring  program  to  break  up  large  shirkats  into  household-owned  private  farms. \nKey  problems,  nonetheless,  remain  in  the  forms  of  deteriorating  irrigation  facilities,  shortage  of  farm \nmachinery,  insufficient  supply  of  good-quality  seeds  and  agro-chemicals,  poor-quality  land  (due  to \nsalinization),  and  limited  knowledge  of  more  cost  effective  farming  practices.  Private  farms,  as  in  the \ncase  of  shirkats,  encounter  challenge  to  productivity  improvement  because  of  rigid  controls  on  wheat \nand cotton prices and, up to 2003, state control on land allocations to various crops.  \n \n \nC. \n \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared \nA  participatory  rural  assessment  was  conducted  in  July  2000.  Issues  faced  by  rural  households  were \nverified  through  consultations  with  three  separate  household  groups:  household  employees  of  shirkat \nfarms, employees of private farms, and private farmers. Staff of concerned agencies, research institutes, \nlocal  governments,  and  private  business  people  were  involved  in  project  design.  Agencies  that  were \nconsulted  include  the  State  Committee  for  Nature  Protection  (SCNP);  State  Committee  for  Land \nResources; and agriculture and water resources departments at the central level and their branches in \nTashkent, Djizak, and Samarkand, and the three project districts.  \n \nIn February 2002 and July 2003, field consultations were made involving more than 80 people, mostly \nfarmers  in  three  project  districts,  including  heads  of  associations  of  private  and  dekhan  farmers, \nhousehold members, and private businesspeople. Awareness was raised on the project rationale and its \ncomponents. Concerns, particularly on types of technologies to be introduced, farm equipment needed, \nand  cost  recovery  mechanism,  were  raised  and  taken  into  account  in  the  project  design.  Farmers \ninterviewed  confirmed  that  project  interventions  are  in  line  with  their  priority  needs.  Farmers  also \nconcurred  that  project  support  to  introduce  balanced  cropping  patterns  and  improve  on-farm  soil  and \nwater management will raise farm sustainability and incomes.  \n \nParticipation Strategy \nAwareness  raising  of  project  activities  will  continue  during  project  implementation,  through  public \nconsultations  and  disclosures  by  the  project  site  offices  and  local  governments,  whose  activities  and \nfield visits will be supported by the Project.  Farmers will be consulted before design; repairs of on-farm \nirrigation  facilities;  and  selection  of  sites  for  technology  demonstration,  variety  testing,  and  seed \nproduction.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s most significant potential poverty impact is the development of institutional networks that \ntry out an array of different collaboration work of the public and private sector, research institutions and \n\nParticipation Process \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nrural  producers,  direct  involvement  of  local  governments,  and  private  sector  participation  in  supplying \nseed and farm inputs. The representation of poor farm households in the various institutional groupings \nenvisaged in the Project will enable the poor households, not merely to serve as passive recipients of \ntechnological  innovations  and  farm  management  practices,  but  also  to  become  active  participants  in \nplanning and  deciding  the  future  of  their communities.  The  establishment  of  institutional networks with \nparticipation  from  poor  farm  households  will  thus  provide  venues  for  the  poor  to  be  heard  and,  at  the \nsame, will increase their capacity to become change makers. This will require that institutional networks \nenvisioned for the Project ensure broad representation and participation of poor farm households at farm \nand community levels, ensuring a minimum 30% representation of different groups (critical mass). \n \nParticipation of poor rural household beneficiaries in the different institutional groupings will be ensured \nat the initial stages when establishing the institutions. The monitoring and evaluation system that will be \nbuilt  into  the  project  will  guarantee  periodic  assessment  of  participatory  mechanisms  of  all  project \nactivities.  Feedback  measures  will  also  be  instituted  to  give  poor  households  and  all  stakeholders \nvenues to ventilate their needs and evaluate the performance of project activities.  \n \nD.       Gender Development \n\n  \nStrategy  to  Maximize  Impacts  on  Women:  The  overall  gender  strategy  of  the  Project  is  to  (i)  raise \nawareness  within  the  project  agencies,  research  institutes,  and  among  beneficiaries  of  the  gender-\nrelated  issues  that  has  arisen  in  the  agricultural  sector;  (ii)  address  gender-disparity  in  access  to \nagricultural  services  in  the  project  area,  including  access  to  project  activities  (training,  jobs);  and  (iii) \nidentify  the  project  interventions  that  will  increase  women\u2019s  access  to  food  and  income  and  empower \nthem to participate in community groups and water users\u2019 associations (WUA). \n \nOutput Prepared: Gender Action Plan (see next section).  \n \nE. \n \nComponent \nVarietal \nDevelopment and \nTesting \n\nTarget \n(cid:131)  Awareness of female staff of the \n\nGender Action Plan: Component and Targets for Gender Strategy \n\nobjectives and project related work and \ntraining opportunities. \n\n(cid:131)  All female staff are aware of project \n\nVerifiable Indicators \n\nproject research institutes \n(Andijan/Galla Aral Cereals and \nLegumes Research Institute and \nPlant Genetics Institute) and \nregulatory agencies (State \nCommission on Varietal Testing \n[SCVT]) of the project objectives \nand activities \n\n(cid:131)  Female staff of project institutes \nand agencies participate in \nproject sponsored staff training  \n\n \n(cid:131)  Opportunities for female staff of \nthe institutes and agencies to \nwork on project activities \n\n \n(cid:131)  Conduct gender-sensitivity \n\ntraining workshop for counterpart \nstaff \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n(cid:131)  Percentage of women participating in \ndomestic/overseas training represents \nstaff gender ratio at the \ninstitutes/agencies. \n\n(cid:131)  Percentage of women participating in \nproject work represents staff gender \nratio at the institutes/agencies. \n\n \n(cid:131)  Number of gender sensitization \n\ntraining sessions. \n\n \nResponsibility: \nProject Management Office (PMO), \nresearch institutes, SCVT, Consultant \n(cid:131)  Women-headed farms will have priority \nin technical training on new farming \n\nEnhanced Farm \nManagement \n\n(cid:131)  Female farmers\u2019 access to \n\ntraining and demonstrations for \n\n\fadoption of new farming \npractices (on soil fertility \nmanagement, crop husbandry) \nprovided by rural business \nadvisory centers \n\n(cid:131)  Female farmers\u2019 participation in \n\nWUAs and farmers\u2019 associations \nin project areas \n\n \n \n \n(cid:131)  Participation of female staff of \n\nproject research institutes in \nproject-sponsored training and \nactivities \n\n(cid:131)  Monitoring gender issues and \n\nperformance indicators relevant \nto the Project \n\n(cid:131)  Equal opportunity and \n\ncompensation for women in \nproject hiring \n\n\u2022  Conduct of gender-sensitivity \n\ntraining workshop for counterpart \nstaff \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nProject \nManagement \n\nAppendix 10  \n\n59\n\npractices. \n\n \n \n \n \n(cid:131)  The percentage of women members of \nWUAs and farmers\u2019 associations will \nbe no less than shares of women-\nheaded households in the irrigation \ncommand areas or project \ncommunities. \n\n(cid:131)  Percentage of female staff participation \nin training and project activities reflects \nstaff gender ratio at the \ninstitutes/agencies.  \n\n \nResponsibility \nPMO, Ministry of Agriculture and Water \nResources, RBACs, local governments, \nAgricultural Institute for Mechanization and \nElectrification, Central Asian Institute for \nIrrigation Research \n(cid:131)  A gender action plan focal point is \n\nidentified from among the PMO staff. \n(cid:131)  Gender-disaggregated indicators are \nidentified (with assistance of the \nmonitoring and evaluation specialists) \nfor collection during project \nimplementation. \n\n(cid:131)  Gender-disaggregated indicators are \n\nmonitored. \n\n(cid:131)  Gender balance in PMO, Rural \n\nRestructuring Agency (RRA), and \nRBAC hiring is monitored. \n\n(cid:131)  Gender-sensitization training sessions \n\nare held. \n\n \nResponsibility: RRA, PMO, Association of \nDekhan and Private Farmers, RBACs, \nConsultant \n\nSocial Safeguard and Other Social Risks \n\n \nF. \n \n\nResettlement \n\nAffordability \n\nSignificant/ \nNon-\nsignificant/ \nNone \n\nNone \n \nNonsignificant \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan/Actions \nRequired \n\n \n\nFinancial analyses showed that target \nfarms will be able to afford improved \nseeds, farm machinery rental, and \nagrochemicals to be provided.
