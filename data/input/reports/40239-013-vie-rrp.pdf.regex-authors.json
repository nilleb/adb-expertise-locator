THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Development of the Northern Chu and Southern Ma \nRivers Irrigation System Project.1  \n \n2.  The project is part of the government\u2019s overall investment program for the Northern Chu \nand Southern Ma Rivers Irrigation System (NCSMRIS), which will increase water productivity, \nreduce rural energy use, and improve food security.2 The NCSMRIS command area is located \nin Thanh Hoa province in north central Viet Nam (see Map). Currently, irrigators within the \ncommand area draw water from the Chu and Ma rivers through one large and many small \nirrigation pumping stations. The completion of the Cua Dat multipurpose reservoir provides the \nopportunity to convert the NCSMRIS from an energy-dependent pumped scheme to a surface \ngravity  scheme,  reducing  energy  requirements  and  improving  the  reliability  of  irrigation \ndeliveries from the Cua Dat reservoir. The overall government investment program will develop \nnew main and distribution canals and rehabilitate existing irrigation and drainage facilities, \nimprove institutional capacity for water management, and enhance operation and maintenance \n(O&M) for NCSMRIS. It will contribute to efforts to adapt to climate change by increasing food \nproduction in an area less exposed than the main river deltas to the potential impact of sea level \nrise and projected yield reductions due to increased frequency of flood and drought events. This \nproject  investment,  covering  irrigation  and  water  management,  will  promote  rural \ninfrastructure\u2014one of the core areas of operations under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s transformation from a net importer of rice to one of the world\u2019s largest \nexporters began in 1991. However, population growth (currently about 1.4% per year) and \nimprovements in living standards are causing national rice consumption to increase by about \n2% per year. At current rice production levels, the present rice surplus of 4 million\u20135 million tons \nper year\u2014which is now exported\u2014will be absorbed by domestic consumption in just 10\u201312 \nyears. The consequences for regional food security will be considerable unless there is a \ncorresponding increase in production. The proportion of the national gross domestic product \ncontributed by agriculture is declining, but economic growth requires continued increases in the \nproduction of food, fiber, and raw materials for other sectors.  \n \n4.  Paddy is the dominant food crop, accounting for 82% of the irrigated area in Viet Nam in \n2009. However, the area of land under paddy cultivation has decreased in recent years due to \nurban expansion, diversification into aquaculture and other crops, and economic growth in \nnonagriculture sectors, with increasing demands on available water resources. While the net \navailable  land  for  agriculture  (especially  paddy)  is  limited  and  currently  declining,  the \ngovernment wishes to enhance the productivity of existing land  and food security through \nimprovements to irrigation and drainage. The government consequently places a high priority on \nirrigation modernization, dam safety, and improved water resources management. The project \nwill address these issues at the local level, and will contribute to ADB\u2019s broader policy dialogue \ninitiatives in the water and food sectors (paras. 6 and 8). \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (Northern  Chu  and \nSouthern Ma Rivers Irrigation System, TA 7480-VIE, approved 18 December 2009, $800,000, TASF). \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. ", "2 \n \n5.  One  of  the  major  objectives  of  the  government\u2019s  draft  5-year  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP, 2011\u20132015) is to accelerate agricultural and rural industrialization \nand  modernization  to  (i) facilitate  large-scale  agricultural  commodity  production  relevant  to \nmarket  demand  and  the  ecological  conditions  of  individual  regions;  and  (ii) increase  food \nsecurity. The modernization of irrigation and drainage systems will result in more reliable, \nefficient, and equitable water services, which are indispensable foundations for agricultural \nmodernization. In its National Water Resources Strategy, the government has defined the main \nobjectives for the water sector during 2006\u20132020 as the protection, efficient exploitation, and \nsustainable  development  of  water  resources  on  the  basis  of  integrated  and  unified  water \nresources  management,  with  the  continuous  development  and  improvement  of  institutions, \noperations, and human resource capacity as priorities. 4 \n \n6.  The  Viet  Nam Water  Sector  Review,  20095 lists many  issues facing  irrigation  (and \nparticularly the NCSMRIS), including the need to (i) balance tradeoffs between the economic \nefficiency  of  improving  existing  infrastructure  versus  expansion  of  new  irrigated  areas; \n(ii) rehabilitate  existing  infrastructure,  much  of  which  is  30\u201340  years  old  and  suffers  from \ninadequate expenditure on O&M; (iii) achieve sustainable financing for O&M and rehabilitation \nof irrigation facilities, given that central and provincial government budgets are insufficient for \nmajor refurbishment and the current government subsidy for irrigation service fees limits the \nability of irrigation management companies (IMCs) to fully cover O&M;6 (iv) improve irrigation \nservice  coverage,  with  an  average  of  only  about  68%  of  irrigation  design  areas  currently \nserviced; (v) manage water quality and reduce nonpoint source pollution from fertilizers and \npesticides,  which  pose  a  public  health  risk  in  many  areas;  and  (vi)  effectively  manage \nmultipurpose reservoirs for irrigation, hydropower, and water supply.7  \n \n7.  Lessons  learned  from  recent  ADB  and  other  development  partners\u2019  projects  in  the \nirrigation  subsector  indicate  that  a  comprehensive  approach  is  needed  to  achieve  full \ninvestment  potential,  including  interventions  to  (i)  build  the  capacity  of  key  agencies  and \nintroducing participatory irrigation management; (ii) eliminate physical impediments to efficient \nsystem operation; and (iii) provide support for project management. Although the irrigation \nservice fee subsidy aims to provide for IMC operations, additional resources must be raised by \nwater user associations to operate and maintain lower order canals and on-farm facilities. ADB \nis monitoring the effectiveness of the O&M policy under ongoing sector activities. \n \n8.  The SEDP sets out Viet Nam\u2019s goal of becoming an industrialized nation by 2020, with a \nfocus on poverty alleviation and food security. Good progress has been made in reducing \npoverty  (which  fell from  28.9%  in  2002  to  12.1%  in  2008),  but  the  northern  midland  and \nmountainous region (including Thanh Hoa province) remains the poorest in Viet Nam, with a \npoverty level of 25.1% (2009). In Thanh Hoa province, 17.6% of the population lives below the \npoverty line. The SEDP envisages that by 2020, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries will account \nfor around 19% of gross domestic product, and 41% of total national employment. The Ministry \nof Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) 5-year plan for agriculture development (2011\u2013\n2015) envisages a modernized and sustainable agriculture sector with a market orientation.  \n \n                                                \n4  Prime Minister decision 81/2006/QD-TTg, 14 April 2006. \n5  ADB. 2009. Water Sector Review. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 4903-VIE, cofinanced by the governments of \nAustralia, Denmark, and the Netherlands). \n6  In January 2009, the government introduced an irrigation fee subsidy for IMCs under which water users groups \nenter into contracts with IMCs to provide irrigation services at a communal level; IMCs are paid the subsidy upon \ncertified delivery of the contracted services. (Decree 154, October 2007 and Decree 115, November 2008). \n7  Guidance in addressing these issues is given in ADB\u2019s Water Policy. \n ", "3 \n9.  ADB\u2019s country program and the project are aligned with these poverty and food security \ninitiatives. The project is included in ADB\u2019s Viet Nam country strategy and program.8  ADB\u2019s \nassessment, strategy, and road map for the agriculture, natural resources and environment \nsector  promotes  (i)  improved  rural  productivity  and  (ii)  sustainable  natural  resources \nmanagement and climate change resilience, especially for land and water. ADB plays a lead \nrole  among  development  partners  in  supporting  sustainable  water  resources  management \nthrough financing physical infrastructure, strengthening government capacity and coordinating \ninstitutional development initiatives for legislative and policy development. 9  \n \n10.  The existing irrigated area within the NCSMRIS command area is about 15,700 hectares \n(ha), which is currently served by about 160 pumped irrigation and redistribution schemes, \ndrawing water from the Chu and Ma rivers and smaller tributaries. The government\u2019s investment \nprogram will expand the irrigation area to a total command area of about 31,084 ha through the \nprovision of gravity irrigation water from the Cua Dat reservoir, rehabilitation of existing facilities, \nand development of new facilities. The government\u2019s total investment program is divided into \nthree phases:10 \n \n(i)  Phase 1 (financed by the government). Construction of the main canal and \ncontrol structures (financed through the issuance of government bonds). The \nmain canal is required to conduct irrigation water from the Cua Dat reservoir, \nfrom Doc Cay Dam to the junction of the north and south main canals (see Map). \nPhase 1 is currently under construction, with completion expected by mid-2015. \n(ii)  Phase 2 (the proposed project to be financed by ADB and the government). \nConstruction of the new north (34.5 km) and south (23.5 km) main canals and \ndevelopment of lower-order canals and on-farm facilities, planned for physical \ncompletion by mid-2017. 11 \n(iii)  Phase 3 (financing to be identified). Construction of the extension of the north \nmain canal (km 34.5\u2013km 47.3) and south main canal (km 23.5\u2013km 46.5), and \nrehabilitation of the existing Southern Ma pumped irrigation scheme command \narea.  The  government  intends  to  finance  phase  3  from  internal  or  external \nresources starting in about 2014. ADB\u2019s investment is not contingent on the \nimplementation of phase 3. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be improved water and land productivity of irrigated cropping systems \nwithin the NCSMRIS command area, situated in Thanh Hoa province. The outcome will be the \ndelivery of effective and timely irrigation services within NCSMRIS.   \n \n \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2009.

The total area to be benefitted and provided with reliable gravity irrigation is 23,899 \nha. The project area presently comprises 15,758 ha of irrigated and 8,141 ha of partially irrigated or rainfed land \n(the irrigated areas are currently served by pumps). Phase 2 includes the provision of nonphysical investments.  \n ", "4 \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The  project will have four key outputs: \n \n(i)  Improved water resources management, delivery of irrigation services, and \nirrigation  system  operation  and  maintenance.  The  project  will  help  to \n(a) establish  financially  viable  service  providers  by  assisting  the  Thanh  Hoa \nDepartment of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) to  prepare business \nplans for and restructure the IMCs as autonomous and financially viable entities \nto operate and maintain irrigation systems; (b) train and enhance the capacity of \nMARD,  DARD,  and  the  IMCs  to  improve  water  resources management  and \nsustainable  irrigation  system  management,  modernize  the  NCSMRIS \nmanagement system, improve market opportunities for irrigated crop production, \naddress climate change adaptation within the system, and support institutional \nreforms  for  improved  irrigation  management;  (c) strengthen  the  capacity  and \nparticipation of water user groups (WUGs) and water user associations (WUAs) \nin  irrigation  management,  development  of  on-farm  infrastructure  and  O&M \ncapacity  building,  following  the  rural  development  support  model; 12  and                      \n(d) promote gender equality and provide support for affected persons and ethnic \nminorities.  \n(ii)  Improved irrigation infrastructure. Activities under this output will comprise \n(a) construction of the new north and south main canals, (b) provision of canal \ncontrol and electrical equipment, and (c) construction supervision. Construction \nof the new north (34.5 km) and south (23.5 km) main canals will include the \nrehabilitation of about 15,758 ha of existing irrigated areas and the development \nof about 8,141 ha of rainfed lands, for a total future irrigated area of 23,899 ha.  \n(iii)  Improved access to and use of rural support services, agricultural inputs \nand  information.  Activities  under  this  output  will  comprise  (a) assessment, \ntraining, and capacity building to support agricultural extension; (b) support for \ndemonstration plots; and (c) purchase of equipment and improvement of minor \ninfrastructure for seed farms. \n(iv)  Effective project management. This will include technical support for project \nmanagement,  implementation  and  monitoring,  and  include  training  for  staff \ninvolved in project management and implementation. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $143.05 million equivalent (Table 1).  \n \n14.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR69,587,000 ($110 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project, including (i) civil works, (ii) consulting services, (iii) equipment,13 (iv) resettlement \n                                                \n12 The rural development support model is being successfully implemented under Loan 1855-VIE: Second Red River \nBasin Sector Project and consists of establishing and supporting WUGs to undertake local irrigation management \nand gain legal status to enable them to enter into contracts for construction and O&M of the facilities within their \nservice areas. The project will implement this model through a participatory process, starting with design of tertiary \ncanal layouts based on the selected cropping patterns and topographical constraints, for which farmers\u2019 knowledge \nof local conditions is essential. WUGs will enter into direct contracts with the provincial project management unit to \nbuild the tertiary units (mainly earthworks), in order to use local labor and boost farmer incomes during the \ndevelopment period. The project will engage a suitable local institution (university, research institute, consulting \nfirm, or nongovernment organization) to help set up and support the WUGs. \n13 Procurement of goods will include related services such as transportation, insurance, installation, commissioning, \ntraining, and initial maintenance. \n ", "5 \ncompensation,14 (v) contingencies, and (vi) interest during construction. The interest during \nconstruction will be capitalized under the ADB loan. The loan will have a 32-year term, including \na grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe government will contribute $33.05 million equivalent to finance taxes and duties, land \nacquisition and the balance of the resettlement costs, recurrent and investment costs. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \nItem  Amounta ($ million) \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MARD  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  delegate  responsibility  for  project \nmanagement to a central project management unit (CPMU) within its central project office \n(CPO). The CPMU will (i) manage the overall project; (ii) award all international competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  procurement  packages;  and  (iii)  award  and  manage  all  consulting  services \ncontracts  (except  engineering  design  and  rural  development  support  consulting  packages, \nwhich will be engaged and managed by the Irrigation Construction and Management Board \nNo. 3 [ICMB3] and the provincial project management unit [PPMU], respectively).  \n \n17.  There will be two implementing agencies:  \n(i)  MARD\u2019s  ICMB3,  located  within  Thanh  Hoa  province,  will  (a)  manage  ICB \ncontracts,  and  (b)  award  and  manage  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB) \ncontracts for construction of the north main canal and lower-order canals. \n(ii)  The PPMU, established within Thanh Hoa DARD, will (a) manage ICB contracts; \n(b) award and manage NCB contracts for the south main canal and lower-order \n                                                \n14 ADB will finance resettlement compensation in accordance with ADB. 2008.

Recognizing that the scale and timing of civil works for irrigation system development \nmust take into account the seasonal nature of farming operations, NCB will be used for smaller \ncontract packages for new and rehabilitation works. Contract packages will be optimally sized to \nattract suitably qualified bidders and to facilitate contract management and project supervision. \nThe ceiling for NCB for ADB-financed civil works is $5 million, with the first package requiring \nprior review by ADB. In all cases, NCB packages larger than $2 million will also require prior \nreview by ADB.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The project was prepared in two phases from March 2010 to August 2011. Phase A of \nthe project preparatory TA (footnote 2) confirmed the overall hydrologic feasibility of NCSMRISP \nbased on an irrigated command area of 31,084 ha, with an allowance for additional future water \ndemands. Hydrological assessment of the Cua Dat reservoir indicated that the operating plan \nprovides adequate water for irrigation requirements in addition to other demands, and the \nengineering design provides adequate capacity to cope with future design flows. Construction \ncosts were considered realistic based on norms for Viet Nam. The phase A feasibility study \nreviewed the relatively high development cost of $7,200 per ha and considered various design \noptions to reduce the costs and resettlement requirements, but no significant opportunities for \ncost savings were found. No serious environmental issues were identified. Provisions for land \nacquisition, resettlement, and ethnic minorities were reviewed in relation to the guidelines of Viet \nNam and ADB. Overall, the NCSMRIS was assessed as technically and economically feasible. \n \n21.  Phase B of the project preparatory TA prepared the investment project and included \nstudies of the project context and rationale, description, resources and outputs; investment, \nfunding  structure  and  financing;  implementation  and  operational  management;  and  project \noutcomes and impacts. Detailed annexes were prepared on financial and economic analysis, \nproject  administration,  poverty  reduction  and  social  issues,  gender,  resettlement,  ethnic \nminorities,  environment,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  preparation  of  terms  of \nreference for consulting studies. In-depth studies were conducted to review the engineering \ndesigns,  resettlement,  agricultural  potential,  institutional  setting,  financial  management  and \nprocurement capacity, which provided the basis of the investment proposal.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The main benefits will be to agricultural production in the command area, and most of \nthe benefits will accrue as increases in crop production arising from the conversion of rainfed to \nirrigated  areas,  or  from  improvements  in  output  in  existing  irrigated  areas  resulting  from \nimproved, more reliable water supply. The economic internal rate of return for the project (phase \n2) is estimated at 22.4%.16 At a 12% discount rate, the net present value is $90.8 million \n(D1,902 billion). These results are robust across a range of sensitivity tests relating to changes \nin project cost and benefit assumptions. The project is expected to lead to a 48% increase in \naverage  household  incomes  (from  $567  to  $838  per  annum)  in  lowland  districts  (i.e., the \ndistricts of Tho Xuan, Yen Dinh, and Thieu Hoa) and a 100% increase (from $360 to $722 per \nannum) for households in upland districts (i.e., Ngoc Lac, Thuong Xuan, and Cam Thuy). The \nincrease in average upland farm income will be greater because the proportion of cultivated \nland that is rainfed (not irrigated) on upland farms is greater than that on lowland farms. \n \nC.  Governance  \n \n23.  The project has been prepared in accordance with current Viet Nam and ADB policies \nwith respect to financial management, anticorruption and procurement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \n                                                \n16  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  The economic analysis is \nundertaken in fourth quarter of 2011 constant prices. The exchange rate used is D20,953 = $1 (the rate as of the \nend of October 2011) and the discount rate for calculating the net present value is 12%. A project life of 25 years is \nadopted. The analysis uses the domestic price numeraire and for traded goods a shadow exchange factor of 1.1 is \napplied. Economic prices exclude taxes and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.85 has been applied to unskilled wage \nrates to reflect the relative abundance of unskilled labor in the project area. \n ", "8 \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and \nMARD. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the project \nadministration manual.17 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social18 \n \n24.  Beneficiaries. The  project covers 41 communes in six districts of Thanh Hoa province, \nin  which  78%\u201394%  of  the  population  is  involved  in  agricultural  production.  The  project  is \nexpected  to benefit  approximately  119,495  households (466,000  people) through  improved \nirrigation facilities and water supplies. The total cultivated area served by project is 23,899 ha, \nwith an average of 0.2 ha of cultivated land per household. Of this, 15,758 ha (66%) is fully \nirrigated and 8,141 ha (34%) rainfed or partially irrigated. With the project, 100% of the project \narea will be fully irrigated and all households will benefit.  \n \n25.  Poverty. The SEDP sets out Viet Nam\u2019s goal of becoming an industrialized nation by \n2020, highlighting the need for an increased focus on agricultural production, water resources \nmanagement,  food  security  and  poverty  reduction.  It  highlights  poverty  alleviation  as  an \nunderlying condition for achieving these goals, projecting the percentage of the population \ndependent on agriculture to decline from 85% to 50%. Poverty levels within the NCSMRIS area \nrange from a low of 11.7% to 45.9% in remote communities, with 41,427 poor households within \nthe six districts covered by the project. Poverty differs significantly between urban and rural \nareas and between lowland rural areas and the hillier, upland districts. In lowland districts 13.9% \nof the population lives below the poverty line, and in upland districts 33.3%. In the project area, \n18.6% of households are poor (weighted average based on the relative proportions of the \nproject area in lowland and upland districts). \n \n26.  Gender.  The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  II  (effective  gender \nmainstreaming). A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to promote the involvement of \nwomen in the project, and ensure they derive equal benefits. It includes specific actions to \npromote  the  participation  of  women  in  project  management,  training,  decision-making \nprocesses,  construction,  and  representation  in  WUAs  and  WUGs.  Specific  gender-related \ntargets include (i) women shall make up at least 40% of WUG and WUA representatives, \ntrainees in project technical training courses, and participants in non-agricultural, occupational \ntraining; (ii) at least 30% of CPO and PPMU staff shall be women; and (iii) gender-sensitive \ntraining shall be conducted for all staff. The results of the GAP will monitored and reported to \nADB quarterly until project completion, based on sex-disaggregated data. The estimated cost of \nthe GAP is included in the project financing. The GAP is in line with the government\u2019s gender \nequality law and ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998).19  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  While ADB will only finance phase 2 of the NCSMRIS development, the government has \nagreed to adopt the provisions of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for all three phases \nof  the  investment  program.  The  project  itself  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Full documentation is available on ADB\u2019s website.20 \n \n                                                \n17  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  ADB.

The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  A  with  respect  to \nresettlement.  The  government  has  prepared  (i)  a  resettlement  framework  for  the  entire \nNCSMRIS investment, (ii) a resettlement plan for the government-financed main canal, and              \n(iii) a resettlement plan for the north and south main canal construction, which have been \napproved by government, endorsed by ADB and posted on the ADB website. Loan-financed \nconsultants will prepare resettlement plans for the remaining works (such as lower-order canals) \nin accordance with the resettlement framework upon completion of detailed designs. ADB will \nfinance resettlement allowances for the project, and the government has agreed to finance all \nremaining land acquisition and resettlement costs. District-level resettlement units have been \nestablished by the provincial people\u2019s committee to undertake resettlement work, as described \nin the resettlement framework. The project will engage an independent resettlement monitor. A \ndue diligence study of resettlement activities on the main canal (initiated in December 2010) has \nbeen prepared and the government has agreed with the corrective action plan.21 \n \n29.  Under the NCSMRIS investment program, a total of approximately 5,218 households will \nbe affected as a result of land acquisition or resettlement associated with construction of the \nmain, north main, south main, and lower-order canals, based on social surveys and initial \nengineering designs. Of these, 1,343 households are considered vulnerable (about 381 are \nheaded by women), and 3,043 households are considered severely affected, losing more than \n10% of their total landholding, and 439 are ethnic minority households.22 \n \n30.  Within the project area (phase 2 of the NCSMRIS investment program), approximately \n3,856  households  will  be  affected,  including  945  vulnerable  and  2,426  severely  affected \nhouseholds. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples. The project has been classified as category A with respect to \nindigenous peoples. The project directly and indirectly affects the customary rights of use, \naccess  to  land  and  natural  resources,  and  livelihood  systems  of  ethnic  people  in  project \ncommunes. Of the 119,495 households benefited by the project, 11,448 households comprise \nThai and Muong ethnic minorities. There is broad ethnic minority community support for the \nproject, as documented in meetings with communities during project preparation. An indigenous \npeoples plan (locally termed an ethnic peoples\u2019 development plan) has been prepared covering \nthe entire NCSMRIS investment program to address ethnic minority impacts of the investment.23 \n \n32.  Environment.  The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  with  respect  to  the \nenvironment.  The  government  has  prepared  an  environmental  impact  assessment  for  the \nNCSMRIS investment program in accordance with its national guidelines,24 which was approved \nby MARD in June 2010. An initial environmental examination has been prepared in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  guidelines,  based  on  the  environmental  impact  assessment.25 Principal  issues \nidentified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  were  the  scale  of  land  acquisition  and \ndisplacement of affected households for main canal infrastructure, and the need to relocate \nabout 157 graves. Inter-commune and district roads will be severed, requiring new bridges, and \nsome 46 ha of forest land will cleared and an equivalent area of forest will be established within \nthe vicinity. During construction, air and water pollution, soil erosion, and traffic congestion will \n                                                \n21  Resettlement Framework; Resettlement Plans; Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2).  \n22  Of these ethnic minority households, 71 are poor households, comprising about 1,466 persons of Thai and Muong \nethnicity within 12 communes of four districts. \n23  Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. 2008.
