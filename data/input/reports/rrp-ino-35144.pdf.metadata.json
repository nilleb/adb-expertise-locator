In addition there will be \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  given  to  assist  in  the  implementation  of \nthe Program. \n\nthe \n\nfunction  provides  an \n\nAn  effective  state  audit  function  is  key  to  an  effective  and  well-\nfunctioning accountability framework for parliaments, the executive, \nthe judiciary, and civil society.. As part of the overall control of public \nindependent, \nsector  management, \nobjective,  and  professionally  conducted  assessment  on \nthe \nveracity,  accuracy,  credibility,  and  reliability  of  information  on  the \neconomy, effectiveness, and efficiency of government.  \n \nWhile Indonesia has had institutional arrangements for public sector \naudit  since  the  early  1940s  the  legal,  policy,  and  institutional \nframeworks have not significantly evolved to promote transparency \nand  accountability.  First,  a  weak  legal  framework  exacerbates  the \nlack  of  clarity  between  internal  and  external  audit  functions. \nSecond, the allocation of resources has not always been in line with \npolicy and legal mandates. Third, parliamentary oversight has been \ndeficient. Fourth, public awareness of the benefits of audit has been \nvery low, and fifth, capacity has been weak. Due to decentralization, \nthe enormous transfer of resources has necessitated strengthening \nthe regional audit institutions to effectively fulfill their internal control \nand audit functions. \n \nThe  STARSDP  will  support  selected  policy \ninterventions, \nadjustment  measures,  and  critical  investments  that  may  otherwise \nbe  hampered  by  resistance  to  change  or  adversely  affected  by \nbudgetary constraints. \n\nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Law: Economic Management and Public Policy \nThemes: Public Governance \n \n\nThe  goal  of  the  STARDSP  is  to  enhance  governance,  and  the \nefficiency,  economy,  and  effectiveness  of  public  sector  audit \nthrough  strengthened  audit  institutions  operating  to  internationally \naccepted  standards.  The  objectives  are  (i)  an  improved  policy  and \nlegal  framework  for  state  audit  institutions,  (ii)  a  strengthened  and \nefficiently  aligned  operating  framework  for  external  and  internal \naudit,  (iii)  enhanced  accountability  and  oversight  of  the  audit \nfunction  at  all  levels  of  government,  and  (iv)  increased  public \nawareness of the benefits of audit and what it can deliver. \n \n\n \n \nClassification \n \n\n \nThe Sector Development Program \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  program  loan  of  the  STARSDP  will  facilitate  critical  reforms \naffecting  the  entire  audit  sector,  while  the  project  loan  will  support \nkey investments to enhance capacity building and strengthen sector \nmanagement  practices.  Through  these  measures,  the  Program \naims  to  help  the  Government  achieve  the  milestones  stipulated  in \nthe  Government\u2019s  post-International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  reform \nagenda  as  outlined  in  the  Government\u2019s  2003  White  Paper, \nEconomic  Policy  Package,  Pre  and  Post  IMF.  The  medium-term \npolicy framework of the STARSDP is described in narrative terms in \nthe  development  policy  letter  (Appendix  5),  and  a  policy  matrix \n(Appendix  6)  outlines  the  specific  actions  agreed  on  with  the \nGovernment.  \n \nThe STARSDP includes several salient features. It will catalyze an \nexisting Government public expenditure management (PEM) reform \nagenda by providing the required focus on the audit function. While \nsupport  from  ADB  and  other  external  funding  agencies  has  been \ninstitution  specific  the  proposed  Program  takes  a  sector-wide \napproach to strengthen PEM. The reform agenda has resulted from \nan  integrated  consultative  process  involving  all  key  stakeholders, \nsupported  by  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA).  The \nagenda\u2019s  overall  design  has  benefited  from  an  in-depth  national \nsurvey done of regional audit capability in around 460 districts. The \nProgram  will  help  rationalize  the  legal  framework  for  State  audit \nfunctions.  The  Program  will  support  the  reorganization  of  external \nand  internal  audit  institutions  and  help  ensure  allocation  of \nadequate  resources  based  on  their  legal  mandates.  The  Program \nwill support Indonesia in modernizing its audit standards in line with \ninternational  practices,  and  help  the  external  and  internal  audit \ninstitutions adopt a strategic and risk-based approach. The Program \nwill strengthen technical support to central and regional parliaments \nto carry out their oversight function, and promote public awareness \nof the State audit functions at the central and regional levels. \n \n \n \nThe  objectives  of  the  program  loan  are  to  (i)  strengthen  the  legal \nand  regulatory  framework  for  public  sector  audit,  (ii)  initiate  the \nrealignment  of  national  auditing \nto  enable  audit \ninstitutions to fulfill their mandate, (iii) support measures to enhance \nthe  parliamentary  oversight  on  public  audit  institutions,  and  (iv) \nprovide  strategies  to  increase  public  awareness  of  audit  and  audit \ninstitutions.  \n \n\nresources \n\nIt is proposed that ADB support the STARSDP by providing a loan \nof $200 million from its ordinary capital resources. The Borrower will \nbe  the  Republic  of  Indonesia.  The  loan  will  have  an  amortization \nperiod of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with interest \nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based loan facility.  \n\n \n\nThe Program Loan \n \nObjectives \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProgram Monitoring \nand Tranching \n \n\n \nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement, \nDisbursement, and \nCounterpart Funds \n \n\n \nThe Project Loan \n \nObjectives and Scope  \n \n\n \n\nThe Government, through a STARSDP coordinating unit, made up \nof  program  loan  monitoring  unit  (PLMU)  and  investment  loan \nmonitoring  unit  (ILMU)  members,  will  provide  a  coordination \nfunction  with  the  units  in  the  executing  agencies  (EAs).  A  project \nperformance monitoring system will be developed. \n \nActivities under the program component will be carried out over 42 \nmonths from January 2004 to June 2007.  The program loan will be \nreleased  in  two  tranches.  To  obtain  their  release,  the  Government \nwill  be  required  to  carry  out  actions  specifically  identified  as \nconditions \nto \ndemonstrate satisfactory progress in implementing other actions in \nthe  policy  matrix.  The  first  tranche,  $100  million,  will  be  released \nupon  loan  effectiveness.  The  second  tranche,  $100  million,  is \nexpected to be released by June 2006. \n\nthe  policy  matrix,  and \n\ntranche  release \n\nfor \n\nin \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  EA  of  the  program  loan \nthrough  the  PLMU.  MOF  will  chair  a  program  interagency  steering \ncommittee to coordinate the program loan activities. \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of \neligible  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member \ncountries. Procurement of eligible items financed under the program \nloan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  standard  Government \nprocedures  or  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated \nfrom  the  loan  proceeds  to  finance  the  costs  of  implementing  the \naudit reform package. \n\nthat  will  allow \n\ntechniques  and  approaches \n\nThe  objectives  of  the  project  loan  are  to  enhance  the  capability  of \nthe  audit  institutions  by  building  upon  past  support,  and  by \nintroducing \nthe \ninstitutions  to  operate  effectively  and  efficiently  and  to  incorporate \ninternational  best  practices.  Investment  support  is  expected  to \nresult in a strengthened external auditor able to effectively operate \nat  the  national  level,  and  an  enhanced  internal  audit  function  and \ninstitutions  across  central  and  regional  governments.  The  Project \nwill  enhance  the  oversight  capability  of  central  and  regional \nparliaments as well as public awareness of the audit function. \n \nThe investment project comprises five main components:  \n \n\n(i)   project management; \n(ii)  introduction  of  new  systems  and  practices  for  effective \n\nexternal audit;  \n\n(iii)  institutional  enhancement  and  repositioning  through  new \nregulatory  structures  and  practices  for  effective  internal \naudit  covering,  as  applicable,  the  inspectorate  generals \n(IGs), BAWASDAs, and BPKP;  \n\n\f \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\n \n \nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n\n \nProcurement, \nDisbursement, and \nConsulting Services \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\n(iv)  establishment  of  a  formal  and  nonformal  education  and \n\ncertification program for internal auditors; and \n\n(v)  introduction  of  new  practices  for  parliamentary  oversight \nof  public  sector  audit  covering  national  and  regional \nparliaments.  \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 16,680,000 to the Republic of \nIndonesia  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  and  $5  million \nfrom a Government of the Netherlands cofinancing grant, as part of \nthe investment project under the STARSDP.

The 2004 elections for the Parliament (DPR) and regional \nparliaments  (DPRD)  including  the  regional  representative  bodies,  has  proceeded  smoothly.  In \nJuly  2004,  for  the  first  time  the  country  elected  its  President  through  direct  vote,  and  a  new \ngovernment  was  in  place  by  October  2004.  Democratization  is  gradually  maturing  and  the \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  is  now  keen  to  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  achieved,  and \nconsolidate the  decentralization  process so  that  benefits  from  democracy  and  decentralization \nare effectively shared by population at large.  \n \n3. \nfor \nmacroeconomic  management  in  Indonesia.  The  growth  potential  of  the  country  is,  among \nothers, dependent on how regionalization impacts economic development. Under Laws 32 and \n33  of  2004,1  which  underpin  decentralization,  all  functions  other  than  foreign  policy,  defense, \nsecurity,  judiciary,  monetary  and  fiscal  matters,  and  religious  affairs  have  been  devolved  to \nregional  governments.2  Law  32  gives  broad  autonomy  to  the  regions;  with  that  authority  goes \nresources.  The  regional  share  in  government  spending  is  soon  likely  to  exceed  40%,  a  sharp \ncontrast  with  the  average  15%  in  the  1990s.  Much  of  the  Government  apparatus  has  been \ntransferred to the regional governments: 250 provincial offices of the central Government, 4,000 \nlocal offices, and more than 16,000 service facilities. The regional governments and legislatures \nare now responsible for a wide range of political, economic, and social development policies as \nwell as exercising fiduciary controls. Their success will directly affect the lives and well being of \nmore than 220 million citizens. This enormous transfer of resources and authority underscores \nthe need to strengthen regional governance and capacities to ensure optimal use of resources. \n \n4. \nto  continue  sound  macroeconomic  policies  by \nintroducing measures, among others, to strengthen the fiduciary aspects of public expenditure \nmanagement  (PEM).  These  measures  are  reflected  in  the  medium-term  planning  document, \n(PROPENAS)  2000-2004.  Consistent  with  this  paper,  the  Government\u2019s  2003  White  Paper, \nwhich  consolidates  an  ambitious  agenda  to  achieve  high  and  sustainable  growth,3  recognizes \nthe  widespread  concern  about  poor  governance  and  weak  fiduciary  controls.  The  State  Audit \nReform Sector Development Program (STARSDP) will support these measures. \n \n                                                 \n1  Law 32/2004 on Regional Autonomy was previously Law 22/1999 on Regional Government, and Law 33/2004 on \nFiscal Balance between the Central Government and the Regional Governments was previously Law 25/1999 on \nFiscal Balance between the Center and the Regions.  \n\nThe  Government \n\nis  determined \n\n2   Regional government refers to provincial and district governments, which are either regencies or cities. \n3   The Presidential Instruction (Inpres No.5/2003) about the MOF paper, Economic Policy Package Pre and Post IMF \n(better  known  as  the  White  Paper),  was  issued  on  15  September  2003  as  a  presidential  instruction  (Inpres \nNo.5/2003) on 15 September 2003.  \n\n  \n\n\f5. \nThe  STARSDP  is  a  major  step  in  the  long-term  partnership  between  the  Government \nand  ADB.  Building  upon  its  collaboration  experience,  the  STARSDP  is  an  integral  part  of  a \ncluster  of  programs  being  formulated  by  ADB  to  support  aspects  of  budget  formulation  at \ndecentralized levels; strengthen intergovernmental fiscal relations; and the controls and checks \nrelated to budget execution, financial management, and public oversight. This Program is in part \nthe outcome of the intensive policy dialogue between ADB and the Government, which started \nin December 2002 and was maintained throughout the project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA), and the STARSDP preparation missions.4 \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Description \n\n \n6. \nEfficient and well-structured state audit institutions are integral to an effective and well-\nfunctioning  accountability  framework.  As  a  critical  check  on  public  sector  management,  audit \nprovides an independent, objective, and professionally conducted assessment on the veracity, \naccuracy, credibility, and reliability of information. State auditing arrangements need an external \naudit  function  (reporting  to  the  legislature)  and  an  internal  audit  function  (reporting  to  the \nexecutive).  The  external  audit  function  ensures  full  accountability  to  the  citizens,  and  the \nexternal auditor of government is traditionally the country\u2019s supreme audit institution (SAI)5. The \ninternal  audit  function  is  integral  to  the  internal control  system  under  the  executive  and  hence \ncomplements  and  facilitates  external  audit,  which  utilizes  its  findings.6  A  schematic  of  the \ninstitutional arrangement is shown in Figure 1.  \n \n7. \nThe  Audit  Board  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  (BPK),  established  by  the  1945 \nConstitution,  is  the  external  auditor  and  Indonesia\u2019s  SAI.7.  Throughout  the  world,  modern \ngovernments  depend  on  public  accountability  and  rely  heavily  on  their  SAIs  to  ascertain  that \npublic  funds  are  spent  judiciously;  that  public  programs  achieve  their  intended  goals;  and  that \nareas of waste, fraud, and inefficiency are identified and eliminated. SAIs has become important \ntools of good government and powerful agents of change. Following decentralization, the 2003 \nconstitutional  amendment  stipulated  BPK  as  the  only  external  auditor  of  central  and  regional \ngovernments.8 \n \n8. \nFor  internal  audit,  at  the  central  level  the  IG  in  each  ministry  reports  directly  to  the \nminister.9  At  the  regional  government  level,  regional  internal  audit  agencies  (BAWASDAs), \nformed  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  Laws  32  and  33,  report  to  the  respective  chief \nexecutive10.  In  addition,  at  the  central  level,  there  is  also  Badan  Pengawasan  Keuangan  dan \nPembangunan (BPKP), another internal audit institution established by Presidential Decree, and \nreporting directly to the President. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nPublic  sector  audit  institutions  require  a  number  of  key  attributes  to  make  the  audit \nsector  efficient  and  effective.  These  include:  a  strong  legal  and  institutional  framework, \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003. Preparing the Support to State Audit Reform Project. Manila (INO-TA 4107). \n5   SAIs  are  the  highest  level  of  public  sector  audit  in  a  country,  and  their  role  is  often  prescribed  in  law  and  the \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\nconstitution. The International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) guides them.  \n\n6   In particular, INTOSAI recommends that SAIs assess and, where reliable, use the work of internal audit. \n7   BPK is a member of INTOSAI and the Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (ASOSAI).  \n8   On  9  November  2001,  Indonesia  enacted  the  Third  Amendment  to  its  1945  Constitution.  Article  23  of  the  Third \n\nAmendment refers to BPK as the external auditor of the Government. \n\n9  Most nondepartmental government agencies maintain an internal audit function, and each state-owned enterprise \n\nmaintains an internal audit unit.  \n\n10 Under a recent decree issued by the State Ministry of Administrative Reform the BAWASDAs have been given the \noption  to  change  their  name  to  Inspectorates  in  line  with  the  central  government  ministries.  (MenPAN  decree \nB/2009/M.PAN/10/2004). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nadequate capacity in the institutions commensurate with their mandate, an efficient allocation of \nresources  between  the  institutions,  effective  oversight  by  parliament  and  follow  up  by  the \nexecutive, and full transparency of the audit process and its outputs11. A fully developed, well-\nfunctioning  public  audit  system  has  strong  external  auditing  capability,  is  constitutionally \nauthorized to audit the accountability of all levels of government, and has equally strong internal \naudit capability complementing the external auditor\u2019s.  \n \n10.  While Indonesia has had experience with public sector auditing for several decades, the \nsystem  suffers  from  a  clear  lack  of  accountability,  as  evident  from  issues  surrounding  the \nsubstance and quality of critical public sector institution audits. Domestically and internationally, \nIndonesia \nis  regarded  as  burdened  with  widespread  corruption12  and\u2014notwithstanding \ndemocracy,  growing  transparency,  and  serious  attempts  to  put  together  a  firm  accountability \nframework\u2014the  impact  of  that  accountability  remains  weak.  Corruption  occurs  at  all  levels  of \ngovernment,  and  is  largely  a  symptom  of  the  failure  of  accountability.  Responsibility  for  this \nfailure partly rests with the public audit sector function, which has been unable to deliver on its \nmandate.  Weak  accountability  at  the  regional  audit  institution  level  severely  hampers  the \neffective  implementation  of  decentralization.  With  a  BPK  that  has  weak  capacity  and  limited \npresence,  central  departmental  internal  audit  bodies  (IGs)  and  regional  internal  audit  bodies \n(BAWASDAs) that are generally weak, inexperienced regional executives and legislatures that \ncannot  fulfill  an  oversight  function,  and  the  presence  of  another  central  government  internal \nauditor (BPKP) with an overlapping mandate with the other internal audit institutions. Indonesia \nhas an audit sector that is costly, ill structured, ineffective, and inefficient. A sector analysis is in \nAppendix 1, and a problem-and-constraint matrix in Appendix 2.  \n \n11. \nUnclear  Legal  and  Institutional  Framework.  Traditionally,  countries  have  a  law \nrecognizing  the  audit  function  as  a  core  component  of  public  expenditure  accountability.  The \nconstitution  and  other  laws  elaborate  the  institutional  role  and  organization  of  the  SAI  as  the \nexternal auditor of government. In Indonesia, the audit function has until recently been defined \nonly  as  part  of  an  antiquated  law  concerning  the  overall  PEM  framework.13  For  more  than  30 \nyears, the legal and regulatory framework governing BPK\u2019s mandate and operations (Law 5/73) \nhas  remained  unchanged,  while  the  economic,  political,  and  social  environment  has  been \naltered  dramatically.  The  law  is  not  sufficiently  strong  for  BPK  to  operate  efficiently  and \neffectively in a decentralized environment (Appendix 1, Table A1.2).  \n \n12. \nIn  general,  executive  decrees  rather  than  laws  regulate  the  internal  audit  function. \nCountries traditionally have, at the central level, internal audit in each ministry reporting to the \nminister, and at the regional level, a regional internal audit reporting to the regional executive. A \nless  common  alternative  at  the  central  level  seen  in  countries  with  centralized  authoritarian \nregimes  is  an  internal  auditor  covering  all  ministries  and  reporting  directly  to  the  chief \nexecutive.14 In Indonesia, the institutional arrangement for internal audit is complex, as it has, at \nthe central level, the IG, which is an internal auditor in each central government ministry, as well \nas a BPKP, which is a centralized internal auditor outside a ministry but reporting directly to the \n\n                                                 \n11  These  attributes  are  reflected  in  the  Lima  Declaration  of  Guidelines  on  Auditing  Precepts,  INTOSAI, IX  INTOSAI \nCongress,  Lima,  Peru,  October  1977.  Derived  from  the  Lima  Declaration,  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation  and  Development  (OECD)  has,  in  cooperation  with  the  European  Commission,  developed  Public \nManagement System Baselines for Good Governance, which were used as the basis of the assessment in the TA. \n12  Partnership for Governance Reform in Indonesia released a national survey of corruption in December 2001: 75% \nof  respondents  felt  corruption  was  very  common  in  the  public  sector.  In  Transparency  International\u2019s  2003 \ncorruption perception index, Indonesia ranked near the bottom alongside the most corrupt countries in the world. \n13 Indische Compatibilitie Weit, enacted in 1925. The clauses were elaborated in the instruction and regulation for the \n\nGeneral Court of Accounts 1933. \n\n14 Most  countries  have  the  ministerial  version,  though  a  few  countries  have  centralized  arrangements,  such  as \n\nArgentina and Mongolia. Countries do not normally have both.  \n\n \n\n\fInadequate  Capacity,  and \n\nPresident, as chief executive. BPKP has a physical presence in almost every province. BPKP\u2019s \nrole has thus sometimes been misconstrued as an external as well as an internal auditor. BPKP \nwas the favored audit institution in the New Order administration, and a number of presidential \ndecrees assign BPKP mandates overlapping directly with those of BPK and other internal audit \nagencies.15 Under an authoritarian and centralized government, such a lack of clarity provided \ncontrol and flexibility to the central government, and allowed the audit process to be stalemated.  \n \n13. \nDemocratization  and  decentralization,  however,  have  strengthened  central  ministries \nand  given  independence  to  regional  governments,  emphasizing  the  roles  of  the  respective \ninternal  audit  institutions,  IGs,  and  BAWASDAs,  which  now  find  their  roles  overlapping  with \nthose  of  BPKP  in  their  audit  universe.  Consistent  with  the  decentralization  process,  recent \nregulations  and  decrees  have  significantly  reduced  BPKP\u2019s  mandate  to  undertake  central  and \nregional audits (Appendix 1, Table A1.3). The central and regional governments therefore need \nto work together to clearly elucidate the institutional arrangement for internal audit, and stipulate \nfurther the mandates and responsibilities through the requisite regulations and decrees. BPKP \nclearly  now  needs  a  new  role  with  an  appropriate  alignment  of  resources,  particularly  at  the \nregional  level,  commensurate  with  its  mandate.  At  the  same  time,  the  BAWASDAs  and  IGs \nneed  to  have  their  position,  structure,  and  responsibilities  clarified  through  decrees  and \nregulations  across  regional  governments  and  central  government  departments,  respectively. \nDoing so would allow for a clear institutional and regulatory framework for internal audit.  \n \nInefficient  Allocation  of  Resources  between  the \n14. \nInstitutions.  Under  the  New  Order,  BPK  was  perceived  a  threat  to  the  executive,  and  was \ndeprived  of \nlegal  mandate. \nDemocratization  and  decentralization  have  expanded  BPK\u2019s  audit  mandate,  and  the  2001 \nConstitutional  amendment  requires  BPK  to  have  field  presence  in  each  province.  The  State \nFinance Law (Law 17/03), passed in March 2003, details the entities over which BPK has audit \njurisdiction.  In  all,  about  10,000  auditable  entities  are  spread  across  the  country,  including \nParliament, the Supreme Court, 70 Government departments and agencies, some 480 regional \ngovernments and as many regional parliaments, and approximately 8,500 central and regional \nstate-owned  enterprises.16  Notwithstanding  some  direct  help  from  external  funding  agencies, \nBPK has an insufficient number of qualified auditing staff, particularly those required to carry out \nthe various specialized audits now considered integral to effective auditing. BPK can audit only \n12% of the entities from its estimated audit universe and, in particular, only 30% of the regional \ngovernments.17  A  weak  BPK,  particularly  one  with  little  regional  presence,  leaves  the  public \nsector  without  an  effective  external  auditor.  BPK  cannot  meet  the  State  Finances  Law \nrequirement  that,  by  2007,  the  financial  accountability  statements  of  some  480  regional \ngovernments  have  to  be  audited  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  the  financial  year.  Given  the \nsignificant resource transfers after decentralization, this weak fiduciary environment needs to be \naddressed urgently.  \n \nThe  ability  of  the  central  and  regional  governments  to  manage  their  internal  control \n15. \nsystems is severely hampered by weak and ineffective internal audit functions. This hinders the \nwork of the external auditor, which traditionally judges, and relies on, an effective internal audit \nfunction  to  reduce  the  extent  of  its  own  audit.  Under  the  New  Order,  BPKP  was  given \nsignificantly more resources compared to the IGs and BAWASDAs. \n\nresources  commensurate \n\nits  constitutional  and \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n15  The New Order refers to the administration under President Soeharto. \n16  BPK sources. \n17 BPK\u2019s own analysis as reflected in the project preparatory TA report. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fFigure 1: Schematic Representation of the Audit Institutions in 2004\n\n \n\n \n\nMPR\nMPR\n(People\u2019s Assembly)\n(People\u2019s Assembly)\n\nSupreme Court\nSupreme Court\n\nPresident \nPresident \nAnd\nAnd\nVice President\nVice President\n\nDPD\nDPD\n(Regional \n(Regional \nRepresentative \nRepresentative \nAssembly)\nAssembly)\n\nDPR\nDPR\n(Parliament)\n(Parliament)\n\nBPK\nBPK\n(Supreme Audit)\n(Supreme Audit)\n\nState Ministry for \nState Ministry for \nAdministrative Reform\nAdministrative Reform\n\nMinistry of Home \nMinistry of Home \nAffairs\nAffairs\n\nMinister\nMinister\n\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\n\nInspectorate \nInspectorate \nGeneral\nGeneral\n\nLine Units\nLine Units\nLine Units\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\n\nBPKP\nBPKP\n\nCentral\nCentral\nGovernment\nGovernment\n\nGovernor\nGovernor\n\nLine Units\nLine Units\nLine Units\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\n\nSecretary\nSecretary\n\nBAWASDA\nBAWASDA\n\nBupati/Mayor\nBupati/Mayor\n\nSecretary\nSecretary\n\nBAWASDA\nBAWASDA\n\nLine Units\nLine Units\nLine Units\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nEchelon 1\nGovernment Boundaries\nGovernment Boundaries\n\nRegional\nRegional\nGovernment\nGovernment\n\nGovernment Boundary \nGovernment Boundary \n\nBAWASDA = Regional Internal Auditor; BPK = Audit Board of Indonesia;  BPKP = Central Government Internal Auditor; MPR = People\u2019s Assembly;\nBAWASDA = Regional Internal Auditor; BPK = Audit Board of Indonesia;  BPKP = Central Government Internal Auditor; MPR = People\u2019s Assembly;\nDPD = Regional Representative Assembly; DPR = Parliament.\nDPD = Regional Representative Assembly; DPR = Parliament.\n\n5\n\nAudit institutions                 Audit mandate                 Audit reporting                   Command                     Coordination\nAudit institutions                 Audit mandate                 Audit reporting                   Command                     Coordination\nAudit institutions                 Audit mandate                 Audit reporting                   Command                     Coordination\n\n \n\n \n\n\f16. \nGiven their role in reporting to the executive, independence is always a problem for the \nIGs and BAWASDAs; but the more significant challenge is the inability to carry out financial and \noperational  audits,  as  most  staff  members  do  not  have  an  educational  or  professional \nbackground in accounting or auditing (only 38% of BAWASDA staff even have a degree), and \nturnover of  qualified staff is high. The IGs and  BAWASDAS thus have difficulty demonstrating \ntheir  relevance.  Table  A1.5  (Appendix  1)  summarizes  a  comprehensive  survey  undertaken  by \nthe TA of all the BAWASDAs, and clearly highlights capacity deficiencies in a number of areas. \nSimilar issues were highlighted for the IGs through a sample study of six IGs.  \n \nIn stark contrast to BPK and the IGs, BPKP has auditors who are more qualified (over \n17. \n65% have a degree) and able to carry out financial and specialized audits. Notwithstanding its \nreduced mandate, BPKP is still by far the best funded and equipped of all the audit institutions. \nBPKP  has  about  6,700  staff  members  in  25  provincial  offices,  including  an  overseas  office  in \nGermany, compared to BPK\u2019s 2,700 staff members in 7 regional offices. The fact that BPKP has \ncarried  out  some  audit  work  of  the  IGs  and  BAWASDAs  reflects  the  mismatch  between \nmandate and resources. More significant is that the BAWASDAs and IGs, given their increasing \nindependence, now consider the this method of undertaking audit work as suboptimal, as they \nperceive  a  clear  conflict  of  interest  given  that  BPKP  reports  to  the  central  executive  and  they \nreport to the regional executive.  \n \n18. \nIn  summary,  while  BPK,  IGs,  and  BAWASDAs  can  be  strengthened  notwithstanding \nBPKP\u2019s  resources,  the  general  consensus  is  that  efficiency  within  the  public  sector  audit \nuniverse  can  be  considerably  enhanced  by  reallocating  potentially  redundant  resources  within \nthe Government internal audit institutions to those audit institutions, internal or external, that can \nbetter  utilize  them.18.  However,  given  BPKP\u2019s  20-year  existence,  its  size  and  geographical \nspread, such a transition should be gradual. \n \n19. \nIneffective Oversight by Parliament and Follow-up by the Executive. After an audit, \nthe  executive  should  follow  up  on  the  external  auditor\u2019s  findings.  This  oversight  function  is \nnormally  performed  by  Parliament  and  regional  parliaments,  which  receive  the  audit  reports \nfrom  the  SAI.  At  the  central  level,  the  Parliament  (DPR)  reviews  BPK\u2019s  reports.  However,  the \nmembers lack the specific background or training in financial management, and need technical \nsupport from a skilled secretariat similar to what prevails in other democracies. Studies indicate, \nhowever, that the Parliamentary secretariat staff has inadequate training, and needs to develop \na better client-service ethos with members.19 Usage of secretariat services by the Parliament is \nlow, dependency on short-term consulting support is great, and concerted measures to upgrade \nthe  supporting  infrastructure  are  lacking.  Consequently,  BPK\u2019s  reports  are  considered  as \ninformation  only  and  are  neither  discussed  nor  followed  up  comprehensively.  Parliamentary \nmembers point to the clear lack of experience and technical skills required to interpret the audit \nfindings that are often hidden in voluminous reports. At the regional level, the lack of oversight \nby regional parliaments (DPRDs) is of particular concern, exacerbated by the fact that regional \nparliaments  and  their  members  are  new  to  their  responsibilities  under  a  decentralized  and \ndemocratic system. However, they have received no guidelines or technical support either from \nBPK  or  from  a  qualified  secretariat  on  how  to  review  such  reports.  Although  oversight \nresponsibilities  are  difficult  to  impose  on  a  politicized  legislature,  the  secretariats  should  be \nbrought  up  to  international  standards  of  operations  so  they  can  provide  analytic  support. \nInteraction with BPK needs to be enhanced. \n                                                 \n18 The Country Financial Accountability Assessment 2001 recognized this issue. The assessment was supported by \nin-depth sector study undertaken by the ADB STAR project preparatory TA, where alternatives were presented for \nBPKP,  and  supported  by  the  steering  group  of  the  project  preparatory  TA.  Figure  A1.1  (Appendix  1)  shows  the \nincreased cost of the audit sector. \n\n19  ADB\u2019s  sector  study  (February  2004)  highlighted  DPR  issues.  The  findings  were  confirmed  in  the  AusAID  and \n\nWorld Bank review (April 2004) in which ADB participated. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n \nLack  of  Transparency  and  Accountability  in  the  Audit  Process.  The  public  has  a \n20. \ncritical role in ensuring accountability of the government and legislature.20 However, legislative \nand  institutional  barriers,  together  with  the  general  lack  of  experience  in  transparency,  have \nmeant that the public, including civil society, has limited understanding of the role of the various \naudit  institutions,  the  information  that  audit  can  provide,  and  the  benefits  of  an  efficient  and \neffective  audit  function.  Without  this  information,  the  public  cannot  demand  accountability. \nInternal  audit  reports  from  BPKP,  IGs,  and  BAWASDA  s  are  not  normally  made  public,  and \neven BPK until recently did not disclose its reports to the public. Transparency in the institutions\u2019 \noperations  is  weak.  BPK  has  never  been  subject  to  an  external  audit  and  is  going  through  its \nfirst  peer  review  by  the  New  Zealand  Supreme  Audit  Institution.21  Internal  audit  has  not  been \nsubject to peer review, and international exposure of internal audit staff is limited.  \n \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \n21. \nThe Government has a clear agenda to improve PEM\u2019s fiduciary aspects (para. 4). Even \nbefore the 2003 White Paper, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) established, in 2000, the Financial \nManagement  Reform  Committee  to  initiate  and  supervise  a  series  of  financial  management \nreforms. The Government of Indonesia in 2001, introduced the state treasury, finance, and audit \nbills into Parliament, of which now have been enacted as Laws Given the long menu of items to \ntackle, the emphasis has primarily been on the issues covered by the state treasury and finance \nbills  rather  than  the  audit  function.  Because  of  the  considerable  support  provided  by  the \nSTARSDP  project  preparatory  TA,  and  after  substantial  amendments  to  the  original  draft,  the \nState  Audit  Law  was  recently  approved.22  Other  support  to  the  audit  institutions  has  been \nselective.  BPK\u2019s  budget  has  been  increased,  BPKP\u2019s  mandate  has  been  diminished  through \nother laws and regulations, and Parliament is now considering a revised BPK law (Appendix 1). \nHowever,  this  has  been  in  the  absence  of  an  overall  framework  or  long-term  vision,  thus \nimpacting  on  the  economy,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness  of  the  audit  sector.  The  STARSDP \nbrings in a comprehensive program that addresses these concerns.  \n \n22. \nStudies  such  as  the  joint  ADB\u2013World  Bank  2001  Country  Financial  Accountability \nAssessment  and  the  ADB  Country  Governance  Assessment  have  highlighted  the  poor \ncapability of the audit sector. However, external assistance to the audit sector has been modest, \nintermittent, and directed to capacity building in individual institutions of the central Government \nin the absence of a policy framework to deal with a decentralized Indonesia. BAWASDAs have \nbeen  given  virtually  no  support.  A  summary  of  support  by  the  international  community  to  the \naudit sector is in Appendix 3.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n \n23. \nGiven  the  scarce  number  of  projects  directly  focused  on  the  audit  sector,  lessons \nlearned have been drawn from a broad perspective of experiences in public sector management \nprojects  and  from  decentralization  initiatives.  The  STARSDP\u2019s  design  has  benefited  from  the \nlessons learned:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nGovernment commitment and the pace of reform. The Government\u2019s political \ncommitment  is  critical  for  comprehensive  reforms  but,  in  a  country  that  has \ndemocratized and decentralized almost simultaneously, the commitment must be \nconsistent with the pace of reforms. \n\n                                                 \n20 Asia Foundation. 2003. Indonesia Rapid Decentralization Appraisal, Third Report. Jakarta. \n21 This is an exercise supported by the World Bank under its Audit Modernization Project for BPK. \n22  The State Audit Law was approved on 19 June 2003. \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nHolistic  approach  to  the  sector.  Effective  audit  sector  reform  requires  a \nfocused,  holistic  approach  to  the  whole  sector,  rather  than  relying  on  the \nmarginal  impact  of  strengthening  individual  institutions,  which  excludes  a  legal \nand  institutional  framework,  interdependence  of  the  institutions,  the  important \nrole of oversight, and public participation. In a decentralized environment, focus \nshould not be just on the central Government if a sustainable reform agenda is to \nbe properly defined. Regional governments need to be included as well. \n\nComplementarity  with  other  initiatives.  Reforms  in  an  area  like  financial \nmanagement  in  general  and  audit  in  particular  should  complement  other \ninitiatives. \nIndonesia,  which  has  adopted  commendable  but  hastily \nimplemented  decentralization  reforms,  strengthening  systems  for  the  planning \nand budgeting and then also the accountability of expenditure need to go hand in \nhand to improve local governance. \n\nIn \n\nProper  sequencing.  Generating  a  sound  sequence  of  reform  measures  is  as \ncritical  as  the  reforms  themselves,  particularly  where  capacity  is  weak  and \nresources  limited.  Legal  and  regulatory  reforms  ought  to  precede  institutional \nchange,  which  has  to  happen  before  results  are  achieved.  In  the  absence  of  a \nproper  sequencing  of  reforms,  particularly  in  financial  management,  audit  and \nother public institutions have not been able to function efficiently.  \n\nComplexity  of  a  reform  program.  Given  weak  capacity  to  implement  program \ninitiatives,  the  complexity  of  programs  needs  to  be  thoroughly  examined  to \nensure that deliverables can be met. \n\nRole  of  the  public.  In  emerging  economies,  public  sector  accountability  is \nconstrained by  weak  capacity  of  oversight  institutions  and  lack  of  awareness  of \nthe  public  of  the  role  of  government  institutions  such  as  the  audit  institutions. \nComing  out  of  a  centralized  and  an  authoritarian  regime,  the  Parliament  and \nother public sector institutions are only now beginning to become transparent and \naccountable. \n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nThe goal of the STARSDP is to enhance governance, and the efficiency, economy, and \neffectiveness of public sector audit function through strengthened audit institutions operating to \ninternationally  generally  accepted  standards.  The  STARSDP  pulls  together  various  existing \ninitiatives,  together  with  new  ones,  to  catalyze  the  Government\u2019s  PEM  reform  agenda \nholistically. Appendix 4 summarizes the STARSDP logical framework. \n \n25. \nThe STARSDP establishes the foundations for a strong audit sector through a mixture of \npolicy  and  capacity-building  initiatives.  To  leverage  these  reforms,  the  combination  of  policy-\nbased and investment-lending support is considered appropriate and timely at the present stage \nof  public  expenditure  reform.  The  STARSDP  aims  to  support  the  strong  commitment  of  the \nGovernment  to  accelerate  policy  and  institutional  changes  in  public  sector  audit  functions;  the \nhigh  adjustment  costs  of,  and  compensatory  measures  for,  reforms;  and  the  high  level  of \ninvestments required to improve audit quality and expand audit coverage \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nImportant Features \n\n26. \nProgram  Loan.  The  objectives  of  the  program  loan  are  to    (i)  improve  the  policy  and \nlegal framework for state audit institutions, (ii) strengthen external and internal audit functions by \nproviding adequate resources to institutions in line with their legal mandate, (iii) put in the policy \nmeasures  to  enhance  accountability  and  oversight  of  the  audit  function  at  all  levels  of \ngovernment,  and  (iv)  put  in  strategies  to  increase  public  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  a  well-\nfunctioning state audit system and what it can deliver. The implementation of actions under the \npolicy matrix will be carefully phased, reflecting the preferred gradual approach to change, and \nacknowledging  the  constraints  and  risks  associated  with  implementing  adjustment  measures. \nThe  medium-term  policy  framework  is  in  the  development  policy  letter  (Appendix  5),  and  the \nrelated set of policy actions are listed in the policy matrix (Appendix 6).  \n \n27. \nInvestment Loan. The objectives of the project loan are to enhance the capability of the \naudit institutions by building upon past support and by introducing techniques and approaches \nthat  will  allow  the  institutions  to  meet  their  immediate  mandates  by  operating  effectively  and \nefficiently,  and  incorporating  international  best  practices.  Investment  support  is  expected  to; \nbuild  a  strong  external  auditor  able  to  effectively  operate  at  the  national  level,  enhance  the \ncapability  of  the  internal  audit  function  and  institutions,  enhance  the  oversight  capability  of \ncentral and regional parliaments, and increase the public awareness of the audit function. \n \nB. \n \nOwnership  and  Stakeholder  Consensus  on  the  STARSDP.  The  STARSDP  reform \n28. \nagenda  was  formulated  in  partnership  with  an  interagency  steering  committee  chaired  by \nBAPPENAS,  which  included  key  central  Government  departments  such  as  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  (MOF),  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA),  and  BAPPENAS,  all  the  central  and \nregional  audit  institutions  as  well  as  parliamentary  secretariat  staff.  A  key  feature  of  ADB\u2019s \nsupport  was  that  at  the  start  of  the  TA  four  fundamental  principles  were  agreed  upon  by  the \nsteering  committee,  as  criteria  for  resolving  some  contentious  audit  issues:  (i)  a  clear \ndelineation  between  internal  and  external  audit  institutions  and  functions,  (ii)  recognition  and \nrespect for the decentralization process, (iii) elimination of overlap in the mandates of the public \nsector  audit  institutions,  and  (iv)  achievement  of  overall  cost-efficiency.  The  ability  to  address \nreform issues can be credited to the upfront consensus on the above principles. \n \nConsensus-building  activities  included  not  only  the  Government  but  also  the  other  aid \n29. \nagencies.  The  STARSDP\u2019s  policy  dialogue  helped  evolve,  early  on  in  the  project  preparatory \nTA,  a  common  vision,  amongst  all  stakeholders,  on  the  policy  agenda,  and  a  focus  of  the \ncapacity  building  issues.  The  holistic  approach  was  extensively  discussed  as  a  part  of  the \ncoordination  with  external  funding  agencies,  and  a  number  of  these  agencies  have  shown \ninterest in cofinancing the capacity-building measures, particularly at the decentralized level.  \n \n30.  Modality  of  Assistance.  The  STARSDP  introduces  a  new  approach  to  the  sound \ndevelopment of the audit function by advocating the simultaneous packaging of policy reforms \nand  the  investment  component,  initially  on  a  pilot  basis  to  assess  their  efficacy,  and  then \nmodified before promulgation. Wherever possible, on issues such as audit standards, a national \nperspective is taken without allowing for regional versions; in areas such as the local regulations \nfor  internal  audit,  national  consistency  is  supported,  with  some  limited  regional  flexibility, \neconomies  of  scale  are  encouraged  through  the  use  of  umbrella  procurement  contracts;  and \ncapacity-building  activities  are  tailored  to  institutional  development  plans,  so  that  the  specific \nneeds of the institutions can be supported.  \n \n31. \nPublic  Accountability  of  the  Audit  System.  The  Program  recognizes  clearly  that  the \nsustainability of the reform agenda depends on the close interrelationship between demand and \nsupply on the audit sector\u2019s outputs. While the audit sector institutions can be provided with an \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nrefine \n\nfurther \n\nadequate legal and institutional framework, and capacity to deliver, the accountability framework \nrequires  other  partners  such  as  parliamentary  bodies,  the  executive,  the  judiciary,  and,  most \nimportant, the public, to be equally effective players. The key beneficiaries must be in a position \nto  appreciate  any  deficiencies,  demand  appropriate  action,  and \nthe \nresponsiveness of the sector to society\u2019s needs. This forms the basis of a solid partnership that \ncan allow institutions to develop together and respond to each other\u2019s changing requirements.  \n \n32. \nSelection Criteria for Regional Governments. The following principles will be used to \nselect regional governments for capacity building support: (i) selectivity and open competition, to \nensure  that  districts  committed  to  good  governance  are  chosen;  based  on  specific  actions \nundertaken  (ii)  strong  support  from  the  heads  of  the  regions  and  the  Bawasdas,  as \ndemonstrated  through  the  submission  of  a  letter  of  interest  expressing  the  region\u2019s  interest  to \nparticipate in the Program; (iii) lack of adequate human resource and infrastructure capacity to \nconduct effective audit \n \n33. \nPublic-Private  Partnership  Development  for  Public  Sector  Audit.  Public-private \nsector  partnerships  are  encouraged  where  appropriate  and  mutually  beneficial.  They  will \nenhance  quality  assurance  by  exposing  public  sector  institutions  to  the  latest  auditing \ntechniques,  and  allow  the  sector  to  increase  its  qualified  auditing  personnel.  Partnerships  will \nencourage private sector firms to compete for audit work as well as build the firms\u2019 capacity.  \n \nC. \n \n\nThe Program Loan  \n\n1. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nto \n\nfulfill \n\ninstitutions \n\n \nThe  program  loan  will  involve  the  following:  (i)  rationalization  of  the  policy,  legal,  and \n34. \nregulatory  framework  for  state  audit  institutions;  (ii)  alignment  and  provision  of  resources  to \nenable  audit \n(iii)  enhanced  oversight  of  audit \ntheir  mandate; \nrecommendations  and  of  the  central  and  regional  audit  function;  (iv)  and  enhanced \ntransparency and public awareness of the central and regional state audit function.  \n \n35. \nKey outputs of the program loan are (i) submissions of audit laws that will define the role \nof  audit  in  public  sector  financial  management,  and  the  organization  and  structure  of  the \nexternal  auditor;  (ii)  submissions  of  draft  central  and  regional  government  regulations  and \npresidential  decrees  to  reorganize  internal  audit  institutions;  (iii)  realignment  and  efficiency  in \nbudgetary resource use; (iv) a BPK regulation on adopting international auditing standards; (v) \nregulation  on  certification  for  internal  auditors  based  on  international  standards;  (vi)  a  clear \nvision statement for BPK as the SAI; (vii) Parliament and regional parliament (DPR and DPRDs) \naction plans to strengthen technical support to central and regional parliaments to carry out their \noversight function; and (viii) the adoption of a public awareness strategy for audit at central and \nregional levels.  \n \n\na. \n\nRationalization of the Policy, Legal, and Regulatory Frameworks for \nState Audit Institutions \n\n \n\nStrengthening  Regulatory  Framework \n\nthe \n36. \nmodernization of the legal framework for PEM, the Government in 2000 introduced bills on state \nfinance,  treasury,  and  audit  to  replace  the  century-old  Dutch  colonial  laws.  At  the  same  time, \nfollowing the 2002 constitutional amendment that expanded BPK\u2019s role, Parliament, through its \nCommission  IX,  reviewed  and  revised  the  BPK  Law  (Law  5/73)  to  clarify  BPK\u2019s  roles  and \n\nfor  External  Audit.  As  part  of \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nresponsibilities  and  take  into  account  the  impact  of  decentralization23.  The  TA  identified \ndeficiencies in the state audit and the BPK bills, and has underscored with the Government and \nBPK  that  these  laws  need  to  be  in  line  with  international  best  practices.  As  part  of  the \nSTARSDP,  the  Government  submitted  amendments  to  the  earlier  draft  state  audit  bill  in  early \n2004. The State Audit Law was recently approved on 19 June 2004, and enacted in July 2004.  \n \n37. \nUnder  the  Program,  BPK  will  submit,  through  the  Government,  to  Parliament \namendments  to  the  draft  BPK  bill.  The  agreed  amendments  were  discussed  in  detail  with  the \nproject preparatory TA team, which provided inputs based on international best practice. Among \nothers, these amendments relate to the scope of BPK\u2019s authority; use of auditing standards that \nare compatible and reconcilable to international standards; indemnity from court actions of SAI \nstaff  to  include  all  relevant  SAI  staff;  minimum  relevant  qualification  criteria  for  Board \ncandidates, appointment of Board members by Parliament; and length of tenure of  the Board or \nBoard members that should not end coinciding with an election year. To settle any duplication or \noverlaps  in  the  mandates,  BPK  will  review  clauses  in  existing  laws,  regulations,  and  decrees \nconcerning  the  audit  function  and  will  submit  to  Parliament  and  the  Government  a  report  on \ninconsistencies and conflicts with the state audit and proposed BPK laws. After these issues are \nresolved,  the  Government  will  review  this  report  as  the  basis  for  nullifying  the  conflicting \nclauses.  \n \n38. \nStrengthen  Internal  Control  Systems,  including  Realignment  of  Internal  Audit \nInstitutions.  Consistent  with  the  Treasury  Law,  the  Government  will  establish  the  institutional \nframework  for  internal  audit,  and  clarify  the  position  of  the  IGs  and  BAWASDA  s.  An \ninterministerial  committee  (IMC),  made  up  of  representative  branches  of  the  Government,  will \nbe  established  to  review  the  internal  control  systems  and  review  and  clarify  the  role  of  the \ninternal  audit  institutions.  The  IMC  will  review  the  role  of  all  internal  audit  institutions  to  avoid \noverlap and increase cost-efficiency, focusing on the more effective internal audit function in the \nregional level and, in parallel, the need to expand BPK\u2019s physical presence in the regions. The \nIMC  will  draft  a  Government  regulation  on  internal  control  systems,  and  recommend  a \npresidential decree on aspects of the internal control systems, including the role of internal audit \ninstitutions. An institutional development plan (IDP) will be developed for the restructured BPKP, \nto define its new role. Resources may be redeployed to other audit institutions, particularly BPK \nregional offices.  \n \n39. \nTo enhance the role of IGs and to mainstream the internal audit function into ministry or \ndepartment operations, an MOF circular will be promulgated for all line ministries to ensure that \nall IGs review the annual statements of accountability produced by the departments. As a first \nstep  to  improve  aid  effectiveness,  the  MOF-IG  will  review  all  annual  and  midterm  project \naccountability statements of ADB projects.24 The IG reports on ADB projects will be submitted to \nBPK  and  ADB.  Along  the  same  lines  and  consistent  with  the  State  Finances  Law,  MOF  will \nadopt  an  IDP  for  effective  internal  financial  management,  including  clear  definition  of  the \nposition of chief financial officer. This IDP is to be drafted as a model for other line ministries to \nadopt.  \n \n\n                                                 \n23 New  laws  can  be  originated  either  by  the  Government  or  by  the  legislature.  All  laws  are  passed  by  consensus \nbetween the two after discussion. The state audit bill was an initiative of MOF, whereas the BPK bill was initiated in \nParliament,  with  the  support  of  BPK.  Commission  IX  is  one  of  several  parliamentary  committees  established  for \noversight of and communication with government agencies. The portfolio of agencies reviewed by the commission \nincludes,  among  others,  BPKP,  MOF,  and  BAPPENAS.  Commission  IX  and  BPK  have  a  formal  process  of \ncommunication based on a written agreement \n\n24 Once the results of the ADB project audit reviews by the IGs are shared, other members of the lending community \n\nare expected to want their projects audited similarly. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n40. \nThe  central  Government  will,  through  MOHA,  help  local  governments  clarify  the  roles \nand  responsibilities  of  the  BAWASDA  s.  In  addition,  MOF  will  undertake  a  similar  activity  with \nrespect to the local chief financial officer. The chief financial officer is responsible for producing \nthe  accountability  statements  of  the  regional  government  for  BPK  to  audit,  and  is  thus  an \nimportant  part  of  the  internal  control  systems.  To  ensure  national  consistency  in  these \nstandards, MOHA  will  establish  an  intergovernmental  team  to  draft  model  regional  regulations \n(Perda or SK) to be adopted by the BAWASDAs. The regulations will, amongst others, require \nBAWASDAs  to  review  regional  governments\u2019  accountability  statements.  The  team  will  include \nrepresentatives  from  the  BAWASDAs,  academia,  professional  audit  bodies,  and  BPK.  MOHA \nwill  disseminate  the  draft  nationwide  as  the  basis  for  formal  adoption  by  the  regional \ngovernments, and will track its adoption. About 50 regional governments will be targeted, based \non  selection  criteria  (Appendix  14)  that  allow  for  selectivity  and  competition  among  regional \ngovernments willing to be part of the reform program.  \n \n41. \nPublic Sector Standards on Auditing and Certification Established. The STARSDP \npromotes the establishment of external  and internal public sector auditing standards. BPK has \ntraditionally  tried  to  follow  INTOSAI  standards  whereas  internal  audit,  through  BPKP,  has \nfollowed,  at  varying  times,  the  United  States  General  Accounting  Office  (GAO)  and  the \nAustralian Auditing Standards. Under the Program, external audit standards drafted by the SAI \n(BPK),  and  consistent  with  international  standards  will  be  introduced.  BPK  will  take \nresponsibility  for  this  exercise  by  involving  representatives  from  the  government,  professional \naudit  organizations,  and  academia  to  establish  these  standards.  BPK  will  replace  the  existing \nstandards  through  a  BPK  Board  resolution.  The  internal  audit  standards  will  be  introduced \nthrough the IMC draft regulation on internal control systems.  \n \n42.  MOF-IG will coordinate with selected IGs, BKN, BPKP, BPK officials and BAWASDAs to \n(a)  review  the  recommendations  of  the  IMC  concerning  the  certification  procedures  of  internal \nauditors  and  (b)  draft  the  necessary  revisions  or  a  new  Presidential  decree  which  adopts  the \nrecommendations regarding certification of internal auditors25 and submit the draft to the State \nSecretariat.  \n \n\nb. \n\nAlignment  and  Provision  of  Resources  to  Enable  Audit  Institutions \nto Fulfill their Mandate  \n\n \n43. \nThe  STARSDP  emphasizes  the  need  for  the  efficient  use  of  national  resources \ndedicated  to  audit,  consistent  with  the  mandates  of  the  various  audit  institutions  and  the \nsupportive rules and regulations. The efficient allocation of resources requires effective planning \nand prioritization. Given BPK\u2019s mandate to audit several thousand institutions and government \nprograms  at  the  central  and  regional  levels  of  government,  an  institutional  development  plan \n(IDP) will be developed. The plan will clearly define BPK\u2019s audit universe. This plan will be made \npublic and thus form the basis of BPK\u2019s annual budget submission and its resource allocation. \nBPK needs to take a risk-based approach in deciding which entities must be audited every year, \nwhich audited by outside firms, and which audited only periodically. This will strengthen BPK\u2019s \nbasis  for  annual  budget  allocation  irrespective  of  changes  in  the  administration.  MOF  has \nagreed  to  support  and  act  upon  the  annual  budgetary  allocation  to  reflect  and  effect  the \nnecessary  changes.  Of  particular  importance  are  the  extra-budgetary  resources  required  for \nBPK  to  expand  its  presence  in  the  regions.  BPK  will  incorporate  the  findings  of  the  IMC  on \ninternal control systems and, as an interim measure, will request supplementary funding to be \nable to carry out the 2006 deadline audit of all regional governments. As part of BPK\u2019s long-term \n\n                                                 \n25  This  will  give  certification  authority  to  a  body  outside  the  internal  audit  function  as  decided  by  the  IMC,  with  the \ncertification to be in line with international certification standards such as those provided by the Institute of Internal \nAuditors. \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nc. \n\n \n\nd. \n\n \n\nquality  assurance  program,  to  ensure  cost-efficiency,  and  to  encourage  public  private \npartnerships, BPK has agreed that a percentage of its audit work should regularly be carried out \nby private sector auditing firms. A BPK regulation will be passed to enable such contracting out.  \n \n44. \nThe  Program  will  review  the  effectiveness  and  relevance  of  the  financial  management \ntraining at the various training centers.26 MOF will establish a team of relevant stakeholders to \nreview  the  existing  training,  of  financial  management  and  auditing  staff  for  the  public  sector. \nThis  assessment  will  identify  measures  to  improve  the  effectiveness  and  relevance  of  the \nvarious  programs,  and  the  opportunities  for  economies  of  scale  in  the  use  of  the  physical \nassets.  \n \n\nEnhanced  Oversight  on  Audit  Recommendations,  and  Increased \nAccountability of the Audit Function Nationwide.  \n\n45. \nThe  STARSDP  supports  strengthening  of  oversight  of  audit  institutions  in  a  number  of \nways. For the external audit function, a Parliament secretariat committee will be established in \nthe DPR, comprising the elected DPR members (where possible), members of the secretariat, \nand  BPK  staff  members.  The  committee  will  review  the  capabilities  of  the  secretariat,  the \ninteraction  with  parliamentary  members  and  BPK,  and  the  follow-up  on  BPK\u2019s  audit  reports. \nBased  on  the  review,  DPR  will  prepare  and  adopt  an  action  plan,  which  the  ADB  project \ninvestment component will support. The long-term aim is to foster a closer working relationship \nbetween  the  secretariat,  members  of  parliament,  and  BPK.  The  audit  committee  will  be  a \npossible precursor to a public accounts committee, which exists in other democracies. BPK will \nharness  the  benefits  of information  technology  (IT)  to  give  the  DPR  access  to a  select  part  of \nBPK\u2019s management information system that contains the BPK reports and the follow-up actions. \nRegionally,  the  MOHA-IG  will  initiate  a  similar  DPRD  secretariat  committee  in  50  selected \nregional  governments  (para.  40)  made  up  of  BPK,  and  members  of  the  executive.  The  action \nplan adopted will be the basis of further ADB\u2019s investment support.  \n \nUnder  the  Program,  BPK  will  be  subject  to  an  annual  financial  audit.  An  operational \n46. \nreview, by a Parliament-appointed external SAI, will be conducted every 5 years. BPK will audit \ninternal audit institutions as part of its normal audit function, and will periodically review internal \naudit  at  the  central  and  regional  levels.  An  overseas  IG  performing  a  similar  function,  with  a \nreport  issued  to  the  finance  minister,  BPK,  and  ADB,  will  also  undertake  a  peer  review  of  the \nMOF-IG. This is to be the basis of similar peer reviews by other ministries. The MOHA-IG will \norganize a peer review of selected regional governments.  \n \n\nEnhanced  Transparency  and  Public  Awareness  of  the  State  Audit \nFunction at the Central and Regional Levels  \n\n47. \nThe  audit  sector  will  remain  relevant  to  public sector  accountability  only  through  public \ninterest and involvement. The community needs to understand the audit function and to work in \na  partnership  to  ensure  that  the  follow-up  actions  occur.  The  community  is  a  rich  source  of \ninformation  on  issues  such  as  corruption.  Under  the  Program,  BPK  will  develop  a  model \nprogram  for  public  awareness,  with  inputs  provided  from  academics,  private  sector,  media, \nNGOs,  and  professional  accounting  associations.  The  primary  objective  will  be  to  enhance \npublic  awareness  of  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  public  sector  audit  institutions  and  to \nunderstand  the  audit  reports  issued.  This  model  program  will  be  the  basis  of  further  action  to \ntrial  with  50  selected  regional  administrations  (para.  40)  a  public  awareness  campaign  on  the \nrole of external and internal audit using BPK\u2019s model program.  \n \n\n                                                 \n26 Sekolah Tinggi Akutansi Negara, a college of state accounting, BPK, BPKP, and IGs.  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n48. \nBPK  will  seek  expert  assistance  to  design  a  format  for  \u201cpublic-friendly\u201d  reports  that \nclearly identify the issues, and the follow-up actions required. These formats will be tested on a \npilot  basis  through  newspapers  in selected  regions  for  a  range  of  reports.  Public hearings  will \nobtain feedback from, among others, individuals, the private sector, NGOs, and the media. Pilot \nresults will be published on the BPK Web site and submitted to DPR, DPRDs, selected NGOs, \nand the media.  \n \n49. \nTo  obtain  feedback  on  the  audit  sector,  the  BPK  board  will  fund  a  series  of  annual \nsurveys to assess the public\u2019s understanding of the public sector audit role. The reports will be \nsubmitted to DPR and DPRDs and published on the BPK Web site with the first survey results \npublished in December 2005. These will establish the baseline for future surveys.  \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n50. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  state  audit  reform  program  by \nproviding  a  loan  of  $200  million  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  Borrower  will  be  the \nRepublic of Indonesia. The loan will have an amortization period of 15 years, including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loan  facility,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \nThe loan is expected to be utilized over 3 years and will be disbursed in two tranches of $100 \nmillion each.  \n \n51. \nFactors considered in determining the amount of the program loan are (i) the magnitude \nof  the  audit  sector  (in  public  spending  and  number  of  civil  servants)  and  the  impact  of \ndecentralization;  (ii)  the  scope  and  strength  of  the  reform  package  in  the  audit  sector, \nparticularly the acceleration of reforms in the past few years; and (iii) the estimated short- and \nmedium-term adjustment costs of the reforms.  \n \nThe  loan  amount  is  in  line  with  the  adjustment  costs  of  the  measures  included  in  the \n52. \npolicy matrix during the program period and not yet initiated by the Government. The breakdown \nof  the  estimated  adjustment  costs  of  the  principal  policy  measures  comprises  BPK\u2019s  regional \nexpansion from 7 to 33 provinces ($105.1 million); salary increases, allowances, and incentive \nschemes  for  reallocation  of  staff  between  institutions  ($33.7  million);  provision  for  the  use  of \nexternal  auditors  as  an  interim  measure  ($40.3  million);  adoption  and  enforcement  of  national \nauditing  standards  ($10.3  million);  establishment  of  regional  networks  ($5.0  million);  national \ncertification for internal auditors ($6.5 million); rationalization costs for the various audit training \ninstitutions  ($18.5  million);  and  nationwide  dissemination  of  draft  local  regulations  ($15.0 \nmillion).  The  Government  is  anticipated  to  incur  significant  additional  costs  for  leveraging \nreforms, including passage of laws and regulations, research, studies, and consultations related \nto the legal and institutional restructuring, audit quality monitoring, and audit report evaluation.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n53. \nProgram  Management.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  program  loan.  MOF \nwill initiate withdrawals under the loan, and allocate and monitor the use of counterpart funds. A \nprogram  loan-monitoring  unit  (PLMU)  will  be  established  in  the  Directorate  of  Information  and \nAccounting  in  MOF.  This  directorate  will  establish  an  interagency  steering  committee  (ISC) \nmade  up  of  echelon-1  staff  members  from  each  component  implementing  unit  to  oversee  the \nimplementation of the program components and to facilitate interagency coordination. The ISC \nwill  comprise  representatives  of  BPK,  DPR  secretariat,  MOHA,  BPKP,  and  MenPAN.  The \nSTARSDP coordination unit, established by MOF and BAPPENAS, will coordinate between the \nPLMU and ILMU. The overall STARSDP management structure is depicted in Appendix 7.  \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nthe \n\nimplementation, \n\n \nProcurement and Disbursement. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign \n54. \nexchange costs of items produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries. The loan will \nnot finance items specified in Appendix 8, or imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral \nsources. Disbursement of loan proceeds will be permitted based on a certification provided by \nthe Borrower. Procurement of eligible items financed under the program loan will be carried out \nin  accordance  with  standard  public  sector  procedures  of  the  Government  or  normal  private \nsector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. The proceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  standard  disbursement  procedures.  Before  submitting  the  first \napplication  to  ADB  for  withdrawal  from  the  loan  account,  the  Borrower  will  open  a  deposit \naccount at Bank Indonesia or another bank acceptable to ADB, into which all withdrawals from \nthe loan account will be deposited.  \n \nISC,  STARSDP \n55.  Monitoring  and  Tranching.  Throughout \ncoordinating unit, and PLMU will monitor quarterly the implementation of policy and institutional \nreforms  envisaged  under  the  STARSDP.  In  cooperation  with  the  PLMU,  ADB  will  carry  out \nsemiannual review missions to assess implementation of the policy agenda and discuss major \npolicy  developments  with  the  ISC  and  concerned  agencies.  Such  missions  will  be  fielded  to \nassess whether conditions for the release of the second loan tranche have been fulfilled.  \n \n56. \nThe first tranche will be released upon loan effectiveness, expected in December 2004. \nThe second tranche is expected to be released by June 2006 (or about 18 months after the first \ntranche).  To  obtain  the release  of  the  loan  tranches,  the  Government  will  be  required  to  carry \nout actions identified in the policy matrix as conditions for tranche release, and to demonstrate \nsatisfactory progress in implementing other actions listed and in the overall Program. \n \n57. \nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting. Separate accounts and records with respect to \nthe  deposit  account  will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with  consistently  maintained  sound \naccounting principles. Upon ADB\u2019s request, the Borrower will have the deposit account audited \nby independent auditors in accordance with appropriate auditing standards. Promptly after their \npreparation, certified copies of such audited accounts and records will be furnished to ADB.  \n \n58. \nThe  Government  will  use  the  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  to \nfinance  the  costs  of  implementing  the  state  audit  reform  program  under  the  STARSDP.  The \nPLMU will prepare and submit to ADB and the ISC, within 21 days after the quarter, quarterly \nprogress reports in a format acceptable to ADB. The reports will analyze institutional and legal \ndevelopments in the audit sector as well as the evolution of key indicators, emphasizing areas \nand measures outlined in the policy matrix. At the end of the Program, the PLMU will submit the \ncompletion  report  to  ADB  within  three  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  program  loan \nconditions.  \n \nD. \n \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n \n\n1. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe \n\ninvestment  project  of \n\n \nfive  main  components: \n59. \n(i) establishment of sector development project management in the form of an Investment Loan \nMonitoring  Unit  (ILMU)  in  BAPPENAS,  which  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  investment \ncomponent;  (ii) introduction  of  new  systems  and  practices  for  effective  external  audit; \n(iii) institutional enhancement and repositioning through new regulatory structures and practices \nfor effective internal audit covering, as applicable, the inspectorate generals (IGs), BAWASDAs, \nand  BPKP;  (iv)  assistance  to  a  professional  formal  education  and  nonformal  certification \n\nthe  STARSDP  comprises \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nfor \n\nintroduce  a  new  strategic  approach \n\nprogram for internal auditors; and (v) introduction of new practices for parliamentary oversight of \npublic sector audit. The major activities under each component are listed below.  \n \n60. \nEstablishment of an Investment Loan Monitoring Unit. This component will support \nthe implementation arrangements detailed below. In particular, expert staff will be provided for \nproject  accounting  and  reporting,  procurement,  project  monitoring,  and  financial  management. \nThis  unit  will  be  headed  by  an  senior  staff  member,  who  will  be  given  funds  to  consolidate \nquarterly  reporting  from  the  component  implementation  unit  (CIUs)  of  the  investment \ncomponent,  complete  midterm  reviews,  carry  out  surveys,  hire  external  auditors  for  annual \naudits, and prepare the project completion report.  \n \n61. \nIntroduction  New  Systems  and  Practices  for  Effective  External  Audit.  The  key \nactivities  will  be  to  establish  a  component  implementation  management  unit  in  BPK,  develop \nnew  systems  and  work  procedures  consistent  with  an  enhanced  legal  and  regulatory \nframework,  develop  a  strategic  approach  for  human  resource  management,  implement  a  staff \ndevelopment  program, \ninformation  resources \nmanagement, pilot new audit procedures for selected audits, and develop a program for public \nawareness and support for effective audit.  \n \n62. \nEstablishing new systems and work procedures will include helping the new BPK board \nlearn through a study tour how other SAIs operate; help BPK develop a new approach to audit \nplanning  and  management,  including  how  to  manage  the  decentralized  offices;  develop  a \nrevised  code  of  ethics  in  line  with  international  standards;  train  BPK  in  the  rudiments  of  risk-\nbased  auditing  procedures;  help  develop  and  train  staff  in  specialized  audits  such  as \nperformance, IT, military, and forensic audits; develop techniques for introducing recommended \nactions  for  audit  findings  into  audit  reports;  and  develop  new  techniques  for  presenting  audit \nreports.  When  new  techniques  are  introduced,  current  conditions  will  be  analyzed,  new \nprocedures  piloted,  and  a  workshop  held  to  validate  the  experiences  before  these  are \nincorporated into procedures and manuals.  \n \n63. \nA  strategic  human  resource  development  plan  will  provide  new  audit  manuals, \nguidelines,  and  training  programs  to  introduce  the  new  procedures  to  BPK  staff  as  well  as \ncareer development plans. Staff members will be selected to undertake specialized certification \noverseas or in Indonesia to obtain the necessary internationally recognized certification such as \nIT,  forensic,  military,  and  commercial  and  central  bank  audits.  Staff  members  will  be  sent  on \nselected secondment in comparable SAIs to acquire practical experience in a number of areas. \nAbout 200 BPK staff members will benefit from certification and secondment experience.  \n \n64. \nIT  management  will  establish  an  IT  policy  for  acquisition,  support,  replacement,  and \nasset  management.  Recognizing  that  the  considerable  capital  investment  in  IT  systems  that \nBPK  requires  will  need  to  be  managed,  the  policy  will  include  a  disaster  recovery  plan,  and  a \nsystem for electronic archiving of audit files and reports. To provide a basis for further use of IT, \npilots will be undertaken on the use of videoconferencing, distance-learning techniques, and the \nuse of electronic tools for audit team management. Computers will be provided to staff members \nin  a  staged  manner  so  they  can  use  IT-based  audit  techniques,  onsite  and  offsite,  in  field \nlocations.  \n \n65. \nThe new techniques will be piloted through supervised applications on selected audits to \ntest  their  practical  applicability  and  the  usefulness  of  the  manuals,  and  will  be  revised  where \nnecessary. This piloting is essential as it will mainstream techniques adopted into the standard \nwork  program,  and  avoid  the  risk  that  the  development  of  new  techniques  and  manuals  will \nsimply  be  a  theoretical  exercise.  Peer  reviews  will  be  funded  during  the  component\u2019s \nimplementation to assess the Project\u2019s progress.  \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\n \nThe  model  public  relations  program  will  be  developed  through  workshops  to  develop \n66. \nmodels  for  the  use  of  print,  television,  and  radio  media,  and  through  pilot  studies  to  publicize \nBPK reports and post the reports on the Internet, thus raising public awareness.  \n \nIntroduction  of  New  Regulatory  Structures  and  Practices  for  Effective  Internal \n67. \nAudit.  BAWASDA  support  will  be  coordinated  through  the  MOHA-IG,  where  a  CIU  will  be \nestablished. Under Articles 6 and 9 of Government Regulation 20/01, MOHA is responsible for \ncoordinating  regional  governments  and  fostering  their  development.  The  MOHA-IG  CIU  will \ncoordinate  the  work,  and  facilitate  the  development,  of  the  BAWASDAs  through  implementing \nunits  established  in  each  BAWASDA  and  staffed  by  secondment  from  the  BAWASDA.  The \nimplementing unit in turn will work with a regional government committee made up of members \nof  the  BAWASDA,  the  regional  chief  executive,  and  members  of  the  implementing  unit  The \nBAWASDA  function  in  approximately  50  regional  governments  will  be  supported  under  this \nproject.  Eligibility  criteria  for  selecting  districts  and  provinces  to  be  supported  are  in  Appendix \n14.  \n \nThis  component  will  also  support  the  development  of  the  draft  regulations  (SKs \n68. \n/PERDAs) for the BAWASDA function. In addition, this component will develop a model IDP that \nwill  help  the  BAWASDAs  assess  themselves  and  establish  a  long-term  perspective  on  their \ncapacity  needs.  The  draft  SK,  PERDAs,  and  IDP  will  be  disseminated  nationwide  through  the \nexisting BPK regional centers as templates for all regional government. The CIU will develop a \ndatabase to track the adoption of the regulations. The adoption of the regulations and IDP will \nbe supported, as a pilot project, in initially 16 regional governments that are willing to adopt the \nregulations.  The  lessons  learned  will  then  be  used  by  the  other  34  regional  governments \nsupported by the project.  \n \n69. \nLump-sum  capacity  building  grants,  disbursed  in  two  or  three  installments,  of  up  to  a \ntotal of $115,000 for each BAWASDA will be allocated to help regional governments strengthen \nthe  BAWASDA  function.  Conditions  for  disbursement  of  the  first  installment  will  be  a  Letter  of \nReadiness signed by the Bupati and verified by the MOHA IG CIU confirming that the following \nhas  been  undertaken,  (i)  adoption  of  the  local  regulation  (SK  or  PERDA)  on  the  BAWASDA \nfunction,  (ii) completion of an IDP drawn up by the MOHA-IG implementing unit and approved \nby a regional government committee, on the utilization of the lump sum grants, (iii) the signing of \nan implementation agreement between the chief  executive and the MOHA -IG implementation \nunit and (iv) confirmation that counterpart funds and facilities have been provided  by the local \ngovernment chief executive. The first installment request cannot exceed 50% of the total grant \nallocation.  In  addition,  the  second  and  third  installments  will  be  released  on  receipt  of  an \nunqualified annual audit report from the STARSDP auditor, and the commitment of at least 70% \nof  the  previous  installments.  An  additional  requirement  of  the  second  installment  will  be  the \nMOU  required  for  the  scholarship  component  as  detailed  in  para.  72  below.  Only  20%  of  the \ntotal value of this lump sum can be used to purchase equipment. Additional lump sums will be \ngiven  to  provide  educational  and  certification  support  for  the  BAWASDAs  through  local \neducation  providers.  These  scholarships  are  detailed  below  in  the  formal  education  and \nnonformal  certification  component.  Finally,  the  BAWASDAs  will  be  supported  through  the \ndevelopment  of  standardized  work  procedures  and  manuals,  which  will  be  disseminated \nnationwide and adopted through the utilization of the capacity building grants.  \n \n70. \nThe  IG  function  (approximately  16  ministries  have  been  identified)  will  be  similarly \nsupported through establishment of a CIU in the MOF-IG. Key activities will be to develop new \nfinancial  audit  work  procedures  consistent  with  the  IG  mandate,  develop  risk-based  audit \nprocedures;  develop  specialized  auditing  techniques,  pilot  the  use  of  peer  reviews,  develop \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nBPKP  will  be  supported  to  develop  an  IDP  reflecting  its  new  mandate.  Guidelines  and \n\nrelevant  audit  manuals  and  guidelines,  and  provide  computer  equipment  to  each  IG.27 \nEducational  and  certification  support  for  IG  staff  will  be  provided  through  local  universities,  as \ndetailed below in the professional education and certification component.  \n \n71. \nmanuals will be developed, and computer hardware and software provided.  \n \n72. \nDesigning a Professional Formal Education and Nonformal Certification Program \nfor  Internal  Auditors.  This  component  will  be  implemented  through  the  Ministry  of  Education \nIG  for  the  formal  education  program  and,  the  training  center  in  MOF  (BPPK),  for  nonformal \neducation  courses.  This  component\u2019s  key  output  will  be  to  design  education  and  certification \ncourses  that  IG  internal  audit  staff  and  BAWASDA  staff  can  take,  on  scholarship,  and  cost-\neffectively  at  local  educational  institutions.  This  component  recognizes  the  need  to  use  the \nexisting  local  education  infrastructure;  the  fact  that  BAWASDA  staff  need  education  ranging, \nfrom a tertiary degree to specialized audit and accounting certification; the need for courses to \nbe  affordable  and  sustainable  beyond  the  project;  and  the  fact  that  IG  and  BAWASDA  staff \ncannot  be  away  from  their  positions  for  long.  The  key  activities  will  be a  review  of  the  current \nfor  government  sector  accounting  and  auditing, \neducation  and  certification  programs \ndevelopment  of  new  curricula  for  public  sector  accounting  and  auditing  that  can  be \nmainstreamed  into  existing  degree  and  certification  courses,  development  of  non-formal \nvocational  education  courses,  promulgation  of  courses  to  various  educational  establishments, \nestablishment  of  mechanisms  to  select  the  institutions  to  deliver  education  support  as  well  as \neligible candidates to receive the support.  \n \n73. \nLump-sum  scholarships  (up  to  $50,000  for  each  of  the  50  BAWASDAs,  and  up  to \n$100,000 for each of the 16 IGs) will be allocated to the local universities providing the courses. \nOnce  the  suite  of  appropriate  courses  is  developed,  eligible  regional  universities,  as  identified \nby  the  Ministry  of  Education,  will  be  requested  to  present  a  plan,  developed  with  the  local \ngovernments and IGs, that will indicate how the courses can be used by the local governments \nand  IGs.  This  will  result  eventually  in  an  implementation  MOU  between  the  university  and  the \nlocal government/IG. These scholarship plans will include details of the courses to be provided, \nindicative  number  of  students,  student  eligibility  criteria  and  the  costing,  and  tracking  and \nreporting methodology on the scholarships provided. No funds will be given directly to the IG or \nBAWASDA for this component, as money will be transferred directly through direct payment to \nthe university. For each participating Bawasda the university will open a separate bank account \nto receive the scholarship funds. Each IG and BAWASDA will be required to certify that 80% of \nstaff benefiting from this support are existing staff of the internal audit function, and have been \nworking in that capacity for the prior two years. Up to 20% of the training costs can be allocated \nto  staff  from  outside  the  internal  audit  function  if  the  courses  are  certified  relevant  for  the  job \nfunction.  All  courses  have  to  be  completed  within  the  STARSDP  project  period.  A  schematic \ndiagram of how this component will operate is in Supplementary Appendix F. The objective is to \nbuild a strong base of individuals qualified in various aspects of financial management.  \n \n74. \nIntroduction of New Practices for Parliamentary Oversight of Public Sector Audit. \nThis  component  will  enhance  the  capability  of  the  Parliament  and  regional  parliaments\u2019 \nsecretariats  to  help  parliamentary  members  perform  their  oversight  function  effectively. \nParliament  support  will  be  coordinated  through  the  Parliament  secretariat,  and  regional \nparliament  support,  through  the  MOF-IG.  MOUs  will  be  established  between  the  Parliament \nsecretariat  and  BPK,  and  between  the  regional  parliament  secretariats  and  BPK.  This \n\n                                                 \n27 Reference will be made to the audit manual prepared under an ADB TA. ADB 2004.  Strengthening the Capacity of \n\nMinistry for Settlements and Regional Infrastructure to Control Fraud and Corruption. Manila (INO-3842-INO). \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\ncomponent  will  be  undertaken  in  a  consultative  manner  involving  the  Parliament  and  regional \nparliament secretariat staff, BPK, and select Parliament and regional parliament members.28  \n \n75. \nFor  DPR  support,  the  three  main  components  will  be  the  establishment  of  the  CIU, \ndevelopment of a plan for the submission of BPK audit findings and recommendations to DPR \nmembers, and development of client-friendly audit reporting formats for a range of BPK audits. \nThe  intention  is  to  develop  intelligible  summarized  audit  reporting  formats  that  can  be  readily \nused and understood by the Parliament\u2019s committees, thus ensuring that appropriate follow-up \naction  is  agreed  on  and  actions  monitored.  These  reports  will  be  published  in  the  Parliament \nand BPK Web site. \n \n76. \nFor the regional parliament secretariats, a similar approach will be taken. A plan will be \ndeveloped for the secretariats for the submission of BPK audit findings and recommendations to \nDPRD  members,  and  BPK  findings  will  be  produced  in  short  reports  for  regional  parliament \nmembers.  Regional  parliament  secretariats  in  50  eligible  local  governments  (based  on \nBAWASDA selection criteria) will receive up to $30,000 each to build capacity to help regional \nparliament  members  understand  and  identify  the  appropriate  follow-up  action  to  BPK\u2019s  audit \nreports.  The  MOHA-IG  will  be  helped  to  deploy  the  model  public  relations  and  awareness \nprogram  developed  under  the  BPK  component.  This  program  will  disseminate  information \nregionally  on  the  role  of  internal  and  external  audit  and  include  the  publication  of  BPK  audit \nreports in local media.  \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n77. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $42.7 million, consisting of $11.5 million (26.9%) in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $31.2  million  (73.1%)  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  Table  1 \nsummarizes the indicative financing plan for the Project, and Table 2, the cost estimates.  \n \n78. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special \nDrawing  Rights  16,680,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund \n(ADF).    The  Government  has  requested  grant  cofinancing  from  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands for $5 million. The ADB loan will have an amortization period of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years, with interest, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the Loan Agreement presented to the Board. ADB and the \nGovernment  of  the  Netherlands  will  finance  around  70.0%  of  the  Project,  including  100.0%  of \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost  and  54.7%  of  the  local  currency  cost.  Details  of  the  cost  estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\nthe  unit  will  be  given  external  consultants \n\n \n79. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years.  An  annual  project  implementation \nschedule  is  in  Appendix  10.  It  is  proposed  that  BAPPENAS  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the \ninvestment  Project,  and  that  this  component  supports  an  ILMU.  In  addition  to  having  full-time \nlocal  staff  for  project  management,  financial  management  accounting  and  procurement,  and \ntranslation, \nfinancial \nmanagement,  who  will  establish  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS).  The \ncomponent will support the midterm review, annual project audits, and surveys.  \n \n80. \nAn ILMU will be established in BAPPENAS to coordinate a number of CIUs established \nin  each  agency  implementing  all  or  part  of  a  component.  The  CIUs  are  detailed  in  Table  3. \n                                                 \n28 The  project  team  has  worked  closely  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Monitoring  Facility  of  Australian  Aid  Agency \n\nin  procurement  and \n\n(AusAid). \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nBAPPENAS will establish an interagency project steering committee (ISC) made up of echelon-\n1  staff  from  each  CIU  to  oversee  component  implementation  and  to  facilitate  interagency \ncoordination.  \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n($ \u2018000) \n\nItem\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nTotal\n\nPercent\n\n ADB-ADF\n Cofinanced\n Regional Government\n Central Government\n   Total\n\n7,905.6\n3,585.9\n0.0\n0.0\n11,491.6\n\n \n\n17,095.2\n1,415.4\n4,224.7\n8,503.6\n31,238.9\n\n25,000.8\n5,001.3\n4,224.7\n8,503.6\n42,730.4\n\n58.5\n11.7\n9.9\n19.9\n100.0\n\nADB=Asian Development Bank, ADF=Asian Development Fund. \nSources: ADB. 2003.

The  project  will  provide  96  person-months  of  international  and \n902  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The \ninternational and domestic consultants will be engaged through consulting firms in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \nThe  procurement  unit  under  the  ILMU  in  BAPPENAS  will  be  responsible  for  all  the \nadministrative  requirements  for  procurement.  All  master  contracts  will  be  maintained  by  the \nILMU. Procurement committees will be established for each procurement package and chaired \nby the project manager of the CIU to which the package belongs. The outline terms of reference \nare in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n82. \nComputer  Equipment.  The  Project  will  finance  the  computer  hardware  and  related  IT \nequipment  required.  Goods  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  procurement.  Items  of  similar  type  will  be  grouped  together  as  far  as \npossible  to  permit  bulk  procurement  and  to  encourage  international  competitive  bidding.  Prior \nADB approval of lists and specifications of equipment will be required. All computers and related \nIT equipment will be procured under an umbrella procurement contract negotiated by the ILMU \nunder international competitive bidding. The ILMU will notify the details of the umbrella contract \nto  the  respective  CIU,  which  will  ensure  that  all  computer  equipment  is  purchased  using  the \ncontract. Deliveries will be made directly to the beneficiary, who will acknowledge receipt of the \nitems.  BPK,  IG,  DPR,  and  BPKP  payments  to  the  contractor  will  be  by  direct  payment  from \nADB.  For  equipment  purchased  by  the  local  governments  and  DPRD,  payments  will  be  made \ndirectly from lump-sum contributions (para. 73 and para.74).  \n \n83. \nDisbursement  Arrangements.  To  facilitate  project  implementation,  BAPPENAS  will \nchannel part of the loan proceeds into an imprest account to finance eligible small expenditures. \nThe imprest account will be solely for the Project\u2019s purposes and will be established at the Bank \nIndonesia (BI). The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  January  2001,  and  with  detailed \narrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The ceiling of the imprest account will \nbe  $2.5  million.

The  Government  will  ensure  the  maintenance  of \nrecords  and  accounts  to  adequately  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan \nproceeds.  Separate  accounting  records  for  the  Project  will  be  maintained  by  each  CIU. \nIndependent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable \nto ADB will audit the imprest accounts and project financial statements annually. To assist the \nexternal  auditor  provided  to  the  ILMU,  BAPPENAS  will  enter  in  to  a  contract  with  an  external \nauditing firm to undertake the audit of the project, including the periodic audits of the grants to \nthe regional governments and the grants for the scholarship and to the DPRD. Certified copies \nof  audited  financial  statements,  and  the  auditors\u2019  observations  on  compliance  with  the  loan \ncovenants  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  six  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.

The  reports  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  progress  made  against  established \ntargets,  problems  encountered  during  the  quarter,  steps  taken  and  proposed  to  resolve  the \nproblems,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  proposed  project  activities  to  be  undertaken \nduring the following quarter. All reports will be in English. Each CIU will submit monthly reports, \nand  the  ILMUs  and  PLMUs  will  submit  quarterly  consolidated  reports  to  ADB  within  20  days \nfrom the end of each quarter, using formats detailed in the project administration manual. The \nPLMU  and  ILMU  will  prepare  a  project  completion  report  within  three  months  of  project \ncompletion.  \n \n86. \nProject Reviews. ADB and the Government will jointly undertake annual reviews of the \nProject  to  assess  progress  and  to  identify  constraints.  During  the  first  two  years  of \nimplementation,  semiannual  reviews  are  required.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive  midterm  review  of  the  Project  in  the  third  year  of  its  implementation.  The \nmidterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the \nProject; (ii) identify changes needed since the time of project appraisal; (iii) assess progress of \nthe  project  implementation  against  performance  indicators;  (iv)  review  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants;  and  (v)  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation \narrangements. The ILMU will collate the peer review and overseas study tour reports under the \nvarious  components  to  determine  lessons  learned.  These  will  be  consolidated  as  appropriate \ninto reports and submitted to the relevant agencies and to ADB.  \n \n87. \nInformation  System.  The  PLMU,  ILMU,  and  CIUs  will  develop,  with  the  assistance  of \nconsultants,  a  PPMS  to  assess  the  project  impact  and  its effectiveness.  The  ILMU  monitoring \nand evaluation officer will maintain the system and collect and analyze data in cooperation with \nthe project implementing agencies. Key system indicators will be used in the ILMU\u2019s quarterly \nprogress reports. The monitoring and evaluation system will endeavor to include participation by \n\n22 \n\n \nA \nB \nC \n\n \n \n \nD \n \n\nE \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f23 \n\nbeneficiary  communities  and  individuals.  An  indication  of  the  types  the  outcomes  for  each \ncomponent can be seen in Supplementary Appendix E, with specific outcomes highlighted in the \nlogical framework in Appendix 4.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n88. \nTechnical  assistance  (TA)  grants  will  be  provided  to  the  PLMU  to  help  ensure  that  the \ndeliverables  on  the  policy  matrix  are  achieved,  and  to  the  ILMU  to  provide  in-depth  project \nmonitoring  and  reporting  assistance,  as  well  as  additional  quality  assurance  through  the \nestablishment of regional monitoring teams. The TAs will be funded by the Government of the \nNetherlands up to $5.0 million, with $1.3 million going to the PLMU and $3.7 million to the ILMU. \nAppendix 13 has further details of the terms of reference and costing for the TAs.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n89. \nSocial Benefits. The STARSDP will reduce poverty in a sustainable way by improving \nthe public sector audit function, which is economic, efficient, effective, and in accordance with \ngood  institutional  practice  and  standards.  Transparency  in  financial  management,  and  public \nparticipation  in  the  process,  will  increase.  A  holistic  approach  will  increase  integration  and \ncomplementarity  between  the  audit  institutions,  and  interaction  between  the  audit  sector  and \ncivil society, thus strengthening the accountability framework in the public sector. This approach \nwill  provide  the  checks  and  balances  for  increased  public  confidence  and  participation  in  the \npublic sector. Appendix 12 highlights the summary poverty reduction and social analysis.  \n \n90. \nEconomic Benefits. The nature of the Project does not allow quantitative financial and \neconomic analyses to be carried out. However, the STARSDP will contribute significantly to the \noverall  reform  agenda  for  a  democratic  and  decentralized  Indonesia,  which  is  still in  transition \nfrom an autocratic, centralized form of government. Improved financial management will mean \nthat  scarce  government  resources  will  be  better  used  and  more  effectively  deployed  than \nbefore. General economic benefits will accrue from increased regional and central government \nincreased  public-private \nefficiency \npartnerships. Investor confidence will improve owing to strengthened governance.  \n \n91. \nTechnical  Benefits.  The  Program  provides  significant  technical  improvements  in \nauditing practices, including the use of IT-based systems and exposure to international systems \nand practices. The Indonesian audit sector will be better integrated with the international audit \ncommunity,  thus  allowing  it  to  meet  international  trends.  Through  the  scholarship  and  training \nprograms, the STARSDP will increase the number of qualified financial management staff at the \ncentral  and  regional  levels.  By  creating  uniform  certification  and  training  standards,  the \nSTARSDP will improve the mobility of individuals and thus their job opportunities. At the same \ntime,  the  educational  institutions  will  be  able  to  increase  their  focus  on  providing  the  requisite \ntraining for the public sector, thus ensuring the sustainability of the training programs developed.  \n \n92. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement,  Indigenous  People,  and  Environmental  Benefits.  The \nProject has no direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, and will not affect indigenous peoples. \nIt  does  not  require  an  initial  environmental  examination  or  environmental  impact  assessment \nunder Indonesian laws and regulations. The Program is expected to have no adverse impact on \nthe environment.  \n \n\nimproved  performance, \n\ntransparency,  and \n\nthrough \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\nB. \n \n93. \nLow  government  commitment  to  reform,  weak  ownership  of  the  policy  package, \ninsufficient  consultation  with  the  Government,  and  overly  complex  and  ambitious  policy \nconditionalities  are  considered  the  major  risks  of  policy-based  lending.  The  STARSDP \nformulation process attempted to minimize these risks in several ways: (i) the policy framework \nhas  been  well  articulated  with  the  Government,  and  has  received  political  commitment  at  the \ncentral and regional levels; (ii) the duration of the program loan activities, number of tranches, \nand  phasing  of  policy  actions  conform  with  the  gradual  approach  to  change  adopted  in \nIndonesia;  and  (iii)  consultation  on  a  detailed  policy  matrix  started  at  an  early  stage  of \nSTARSDP  preparation,  concentrated  on  a  few  core  reforms,  and  involved  a  wide  range  of \nGovernment  counterparts,  most  of  which  remained  involved  throughout  the  process.  The \narticulation  between  policy  actions  and  project  interventions  of  the  STARSDP  increases  the \nsafeguards  for  reform  implementation.  Institutional  or  legal  measures  indispensable  to \nimplement  the  Project  have  been  inserted  into  the  policy  matrix.  Conversely,  the  Project  will \nsupport activities to ensure that policy changes are appropriately designed and their feasibility \nfully  assessed  from  the  financial  and  institutional  perspectives.  The  policy  matrix  articulates \nSTARSDP reform actions with interventions supported by other ongoing ADB operations.  \n \n94. \nThe greatest threat of poor audit performance is in  regional government accountability. \nGiven limited funds, the investment program is designed to build up a critical mass of regional \ninternal  audit  institutions  supported  by  a  strengthened  external  audit.  The  design  of  the  local \nregulation template will be disseminated nationwide to establish a consistent national legal and \nregulatory  framework  for  internal  audit.  The  focus  on  50  BAWASDAs  will  clearly  identify  a \npackage of measures provided through lump-sum grants for institutional capacity and education \nthat can easily be duplicated by other aid agencies either through cofinancing of this project or \nseparately. This additional funding will benefit from the legal and institutional framework put in \nplace during the STARSDP.  \n \nThe risk of late provision of counterpart funds and staff has been minimized by requiring \n95. \nthe  Government  to  establish  the  project  management  and  monitoring  structure  (ISC,  PCMU, \nPLMU,  and  ILMU).  Qualified  personnel  will  fill  the  expert  positions,  already  endorsed  by  the \nGovernment,  so  that  the  additional  burden  on  the  Government  budget  will  be  minimal.  The \nGovernment has carefully identified and reviewed the STARSDP\u2019s recurrent cost implications.  \n \n96. \nTransparency  and  accuracy  of  data  for  monitoring  purposes  constitute  another  major \nproblem as poor quality and low policy relevance of indicators may lead to inaccurate analyses \nand  possible  mis-targeting  of  interventions.  In  the  STARSDP,  this  risk  is  considered  limited  in \nview of the assistance provided for auditing and monitoring. In addition, a self-check mechanism \nis  being  built  into  the  project  with  BPK  and  the  IGs,  besides  the  external  auditor,  auditing \naspects of the project. The aim is to induce Government ownership and better benchmarking of \nthe implementation and audit issues arising out of development projects rather than wait for an \nexternal auditor to highlight them in an annual audit.  \n \n97. \nIn  spite  of  recent  progress,  the  project  implementation  capacities  of  central  agencies \nremain  weak,  and  could  seriously  delay  implementation.  Staff  of  executing  agencies  needs  to \nbe adequately trained in all areas of project management, and particular guidance is required to \nensure  compliance  with  ADB  procedures.  The  upfront  appointment  and  training  of  PCMU, \nPLMU, and ILMU staff, and the engagement of international individual consultants to assist the \nPCMU in project administration, constitute essential safeguards of the STARSDP.  \n \n98. \nDeficient  intra-governmental  coordination  and  decision-making  processes  are  other \nnoted project implementation risks. The characteristics of the STARSDP management structure \n\n \n\n\f25 \n\nhelp  minimize  these  risks  by  facilitating  concerted  action  and  information  sharing  among \nagencies  while  respecting  the  existing  hierarchical  lines.  Implementation  arrangements  and \nresponsibilities are shared among several agencies and to avoid overloading any single agency. \nThe  ILMU  and  PCU  have  been  placed  under  BAPPENAS  through  a  consensus decision.  The \nISC,  composed  of  high-level  government  officials  representing  the  main  implementation \nagencies, will ensure interagency coordination and facilitate the resolution of important project \nand program implementation issues. Senior officials have been entrusted with the functions of \noverall STARSDP, ILMU, and PLMU directors.  \n \nThe  specific  risk  associated  with  the  possibility  that  the  BPKP\u2019s  position  will  not  be \n99. \nrealigned  has  been  addressed  in  a  number  of  ways.  The  risk  itself  has  been  mitigated  by \nensuring that the legal and institutional framework, and the capacity of the internal and external \ninstitutions that form the core of the state audit sector (BPK, IG, and BAWASDA) will be clearly \ndefined  and  strengthened.  Furthermore,  the  other  audit  institutions  have  begun  to  assert \nthemselves at the central or regional level. The Government has already initiated this process \nthrough various laws and regulations, but this project will clearly establish the end state for the \ninstitutional framework, leaving the lesser risk of BPKP remaining as an internal audit institution \nwith significant resources and overlapping mandates. This situation then becomes less easy to \ndefend  internally,  and  the  consensus  for  change  already  exists.  Even  BPKP  is  looking  at \ndifferent ways to realign itself. Significantly, BPKP has agreed to be part of the interministerial \ncommittee  that  the  policy  agenda  has  delineated.  The  concerns  over  any  potential  impact  on \nstaff within BPKP arising from the possible realignment have been mitigated by the ability and \nneeds  of  other  audit  institutions  to  absorb  any  displaced  BPKP  staff.  This  is  particularly \nimportant at the regional level. The demographics of the key audit organizations are such that \nretirements in the next few years will allow for a natural rationalization of size.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n100.  The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard \nassurances,  which  have  been  incorporated  into  the  legal  documents.  The  Government  will  (i) \nfulfill  conditions  agreed  upon  and  specified  in  the  policy  matrix  for  the  release  of  the  first  and \nsecond  tranches  of  the  program  loan,  and  will  promptly  adopt  other  policies  and  undertake \nactions as described in the development policy letter and the policy matrix; (ii) ensure that ISC \nand  PSC  meet  quarterly  throughout  the  STARSDP  implementation  period  for  the  purpose  of \nmonitoring,  and  that  ad  hoc  PSC  meetings  are  convened  promptly  to  settle  project \nimplementation  issues  requiring  high-level  decisions;  (iii)  ensure  that  timely  and  accurate \nquarterly  progress  reports  are  produced  and  that  adverse  audit  findings  are  followed  up \neffectively and on time; (iv) ensure that civil servants to be trained under the Project\u2014primarily \nBAWASDA and IG staff\u2014will be selected according to criteria agreed upon with ADB and will be \nreleased  from  regular  duties  to  permit  their  participation  in  training  activities;  (v)  implement  a \nbonding  system  to  ensure  that  staff  members  trained  overseas  under  the  Project  agree  to \nremain in the audit function of the Government for at least 2 full financial years as a condition for \nundertaking  the  study;  (vi)  bear  all  recurrent  costs,  during  and  after  implementation  of  the \nSTARSPD, incurred to establish the various audit activities, including staff salaries and related \npayments,  maintenance  of  equipment  and  facilities,  communications,  transportation,  supplies \nand  materials,  and  other  operating  expenses;  (vii)  take  reasonable  measure  to  ensure  that, \nthroughout  the  duration  of  the  STARSPD,  all  personnel  contributing  to  its  implementation \nreceive  remuneration  commensurate  with  their  responsibilities  and  workload;  (viii)  ensure  the \ntimely release of counterpart funds; and (ix) complete the establishment, within three months of \nloan effectiveness of a PPMS, for the STAR-SDP.  \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nConditions of Loan Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \n101. \nIn  addition  to  standard  conditions  for  effectiveness,  before  effectiveness  of  (i)  the \nprogram  loan,  (a)  the  Government  will  establish  the  deposit  account  at  the  BI;  and  (b)  the \nproject loan agreement will have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower, \nand  all  conditions  precedent  to  its  effectiveness  shall  have  been  fulfilled;  and  (ii)  the  project \nloan:  (a)  the  committee  for  the  recruitment  of  the  consultants  to  support  the  operations  of  the \nILMU  will  be  established;  and  (b)  the  program  Loan  Agreement  will  have  been  duly  executed \nand  delivered  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,  and  all  conditions  precedent  to  its  effectiveness \nfulfilled.  \n \nC. \n \n102.  Disbursement on the Program Loan will take place once the Government has carried out  \nactions  specifically  identified  as  conditions  for  tranche  release  in  the  policy  matrix,  and  has  \ndemonstrated satisfactory progress in implementing other actions in the policy matrix. For each \ntranche release the Government will submit, for ADB approval, a withdrawal application, in the \nformat  and  conditions  as  specified  in  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  June  2001. \nDisbursement  on  the  investment  loan  will  be  made  once  the  project  specific  imprest  account \nhas  been  established,  and  on  approval  of  withdrawal  applications  submitted  in  the  format \nspecified in the ADB  Loan Disbursement Handbook, June 2001. \n \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n103. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), and recommend that the Board approve:  \n \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\nthe  loan  of  $200,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Program \nComponent of the State Audit Reform Sector Development Program (STARSDP) \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loan \nfacility;  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  such  other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Program Loan Agreement presented to the Board;  \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 16,680,000 to \nthe  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Project  Component  of  the  STARSDP  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Project  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board, and \n\nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent \nof $5,000,000 to the Government of Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Government of the Netherlands for program and project monitoring.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n17 November 2004 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTadao Chino   \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n27\n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nThe sector analysis serves to illustrate through diagrams and tables some of the issues \n\n \n1. \nraised in the main text \n \nStaff  Allocation.

The  study  examined  five  representative  IGs  to \nglean the issues facing their role and mandates. These IGs were MSRI, MONE, MOF, Ministry \nof  Communication,  and  MOHA.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  conducted  a  nationwide \nsurvey of BAWASDAs through a standardized questionnaire. Over 76% of the 32 provincial and \n442  district  BAWASDAs  responded.  A  number  of  workshops  were  held  with  the  IGs  and \nrepresentative BAWASDAs to identify the main issues. \n \n\nTable A1.2: External Audit: Issues Related to BPK \n \n Emerging Issues \nThe primary issue concerning BPK, Indonesia\u2019s supreme audit agency, is whether or not it has \nthe staff, facilities, and other resources necessary to fulfill its expanded mandate under the \nrecently enacted Third Amendment to the 1945 Constitution, Law 17/03, and implementing \nregulations. An important addition is the requirement for BPK to audit the financial \naccountability statements of central and regional governments within 6 months of the end of \nthe financial year. Other laws such as the Clean Government Law (Law 28/99) and the \nAnticorruption Law (Law 31/1999) provide that BPK will carry out further investigations as \nrequired. \n \nLaw 5/73 is considered deficient as it fails to provide for \n\u2022  a clear definition on the scope of BPK\u2019s audits;  \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  BPK\u2019s administrative independence, and the use of auditing standards consistent with \n\nthe apolitical election process for the members of the board;  \nindemnity from prosecution for BPK staff members conducting audit;  \n\ninternational best practice;  \n\n\u2022  effective follow-up of recommendations;  \n\u2022  BPK\u2019s relationship to Parliament, and its freedom to release report findings to the public; \n\u2022  adequate authority to access information from those audited;  \n\u2022  BPK\u2019s relationship with internal auditors; and  \n\u2022  BPK\u2019s role in a decentralized Indonesia.  \n \n\u2022  Parliament does not usually receive or have regular access to individual BPK audit reports; \n\nParliament receives summaries of edited versions of individual reports.  \n\n\u2022  Ministries appear to have no legislated or policy-based obligation to address issues raised \n\nin reports.  \n\n\u2022  Reports are not generally made public.  \n\u2022  Regional Parliaments oversight authority has increased since the enactment of Law \n\n22/1999, and Article 18 gives DPRD the right to approve the audited annual accountability \nreport of the head of the local executive: the governor in the province, and the chief \nexecutive in the districts. However, they do not have the skills to carry out that oversight \nfunction. \n\n \n\u2022  BPK estimates total resources needed at about 5,000 staff members, about twice its \n\ncurrent staffing. \n\n\u2022  The executive branch, specifically the State Personnel Board, allocates staff resources, \n\nwhich are usually well below requested needs.  \n\n\u2022  Too few types of audits are conducted. Financial audits comprise most of them, and \n\nperformance audits make up some. Other types such as forensic, contract, compliance, \nprogram, computer, public debt, environmental, export/import, policy, and privatization \naudits are not being conducted. \n\n\u2022  Recruiting requirements that limit hiring to accountants and exclude multidisciplinary \ncandidates may be impeding expansion of the nature and types of audits that can be \nconducted.  \n\n Condition \nMandate  \n\nOversight \n\n \n\nOperational \nStaff Resources \n \n \n \n \nTypes of Audits \nConducted \n \n \nRecruiting \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f Condition \nComputerization \nand Enhanced \nInformation \nTechnology \n \n \n \n \n \nAudit Quality \nand Internal \nQuality \nAssurance  \n  \n \n \nReporting \nTraining \n \n\nInternational \nPractice \n(benchmarking) \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n29\n\n Emerging Issues \n\u2022  The system does not adequately track audit recommendations so they can be followed up. \n\nAudit follow-up may be limited because of an inadequate tracking system.  \n\n\u2022  Substantive follow-up on fraud audit cases referred to the Attorney General\u2019s Office are \nlacking and do not result in an affirmative prosecutorial action. An electronic system for \ntracking compliance with continuing professional education requirements is still under \ndevelopment, and responsibility for managing that system has yet to be decided.  \n\n\u2022  Some audits and the resultant audit reports lacked quality.  \n\u2022  Some audit reports did not comply with a model comprising best practices and related audit \nreport standards, reflecting on the internal systems in place to assure quality audits and \nquality audit reports.  \n\n\u2022  Audit managers and auditors in charge, rather than organization officials such as the chair \n\nor other officials, sign reports.  \n\n \n\u2022  Training has not been adequate to increase performance audits and/or the variety of types \n\n\u2022  Training has not kept pace with the movement to increase use of computerization and \n\n\u2022  Training has been unable to correct deficient audit and report quality or to strengthen the \n\nof audits that could be conducted.  \n\nenhanced information technology.  \n\ninternal quality assurance system.  \n\n\u2022  SAI audit results should be used to improve government. Ministries appear to have no \n\n\u2022 \n\nlegislated or policy-based obligation to address issues raised in reports.  \nIn line with concepts of accountability, transparency, and oversight, audit reports should be \nmade readily available to the public and widely distributed. Audit reports are not generally \nmade public.  \n\n\u2022  Audit organizations, to gauge the effectiveness of their impact on government activities, \n\nshould monitor the actions taken by those audited in connection with the conclusions and \nrecommendations stated in audit reports. The system does not adequately track audit \nrecommendations and thus audit follow-up may be limited.  \n\n\u2022  To help make certain that audit work is of an acceptable quality and competence, SAIs \n\nshould develop quality measures for their audit work, supported by policies and procedures \nthat help assure that audit standards are consistently and uniformly applied. Deficiencies in \naudit execution and reports demonstrate that the quality assurance system may not be \nadequate.  \n\nBPK State Audit Board of Indonesia, SAI Supreme Audit Agency. \nADB. 2003.

One IG recruits mostly accountants or person having \naccounting background; other IGs recruit staff with various backgrounds. This can impede \nsome IGs\u2019 ability to expand the nature and types of audits that can be conducted. \nIG staff may not possess the skills needed to conduct all types of audits. Many IGs require \nthe assistance of BPKP to conduct audits. Routine technical performance audits, as well \nas financial and special audits, are sometimes carried out with BPKP\u2019s assistance.  \n\n\u2022 \n\n Types of audits \n Standards \n \n \n \n \n Productivity \n\n\u2022  At least one IG did not conduct financial audits. It relied on BPKP to do it. \n\u2022 \n\nIGs used audit standards inconsistently; few used the same standards or those \npromulgated by a standard-setting body such as the IIA or those reconcilable with audit \nstandards.  \n\n\u2022  Some IGs used no audit standards at all.  \n\u2022  One IG (MOF-IG) has issued its own audit standards \n\u2022  The ratio of IG audit staff members to audit reports issued ranged from about one report \n\nfor each staff member to almost seven a year.  \n\n\u2022  The proportion of auditors on IG staff ranged from 67% to 42%. \n\u2022  A review of audit reports at selected ministries disclosed that none of the reports fully \n\ncomplied with \u201cbest practices\u201d audit-reporting techniques.  \n\n\u2022  There are various signatory authorities for IG reports.

However, regional laws do not require local regulations to provide \nfor the specific legal and institutional issues. \nBPK is presumed to exercise some degree of oversight over the BAWASDA audit activities \nit is about to conduct an audit at the BAWASDA level.  \n \n\nThe amounts budgeted for provincial and regional audits appear to be smaller than their \nestimated needs: the number of regional audits is about 10 times greater than provincial \naudits, but the amounts budgeted for regional audits is only about three times greater. While \naudit is labor-intensive, only about 50% of the audit budget is for salaries. \n\u2022  More physical resources, including computers, are needed. The ratio of computers to \n\nstaff members is 1:7 one for every seven staff members at the provincial level, and 1:9 \none for every nine at the regional level.  \n\n\u2022  The STAR Project was told that training equipment, trained instructors, and training \n\nmaterials were also needed.  \n\n\u2022  Many BAWASDA respondents think they are understaffed by more than 3,200 auditors: \n\nover 500 at the provincial level, and about 2,700 at the regional level.  \n\n\u2022  About 40% of the staff did not go beyond high school.  \n\u2022  Only 6% of the staff had academic training in accounting.  \n\u2022  Standards issued by BPKP and modified for use were used during some audits. \n\nGuidance issued by MOHA was used during other audits.  \n\n\u2022  BAWASDAs appear not to have either the resources or the skills to complete all their \n\nrequired audits.  \n\n \n\n\u2022  A survey showed that almost 15% of the provincial audits were either conducted with \n\nassistance from another audit organization or were not audited.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n Condition \n\nTraining \n \n \n \nFraud \nInvestigations \n \n \n \n \nInternational \nPractice \n(benchmarking) \nPrimary Concern \n\n \n\n Emerging Issues \n\n\u2022  The total amount budgeted for district and provincial training is an average of 2.1% of \n\nthe budget, ranging from 2.2% for the districts to 1.9% for the provinces.  \n\n\u2022  Eighty-one percent of district respondents and 90% of provincial respondents agreed \n\nthat financial training was their greatest training need. \n\n\u2022  BAWASDA report the results of an audit that indicates the commission of a criminal \n\noffense to regional government officials without assurance that such matters will receive \nappropriate police or judicial review. We were advised that the results of fraud \ninvestigations are given to the mayor for ultimate disposition.  \n\nThe lack of adequate physical and staff resources, qualified and academically trained \naccountants, essential training in finance, and complete independence indicates that total \ncompliance with generally accepted internal audit standards might be unlikely. \nThe primary issue concerning BAWASDA is whether or not they have the independence, \nrequisite capable staff, facilities, and other resources necessary to fulfill their mandate under \nIndonesia\u2019s decentralization laws (Laws 22/99 and 25/99).  \n \n\nBAWASDA Regional Government Internal Auditor. \nSource: ADB. 2003.

Based on international practice, the role of BPK as external auditor \nis clear and no alternative scenarios were developed. Likewise, the clear role of the IGs within \nministries also does not warrant the development of alternatives. However, BPKP\u2019s diminished \nrole raises an important question regarding its future role.  \n \n5. \nA presentation given at the steering committee meeting on 24 May 2004 included setting \nout  the  following  alternative  roles  for  BPKP  that  had  been  brought  to  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance project team\u2019s attention by others: \n \n\nstatus quo, \ntotal dissolution or merger with other bodies, and \nsplit central and regional. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n \n6. \nGiven  the  considerable expansion  of  BPK\u2019s  responsibilities and  its  limited  resources,  it \nseemed to make sense for the Government to consider the reassignment of BPKP\u2019s 25 regional \noffices and over 5,000 staff to BPK. \n \n7. \nShould  this  take  place,  the  question  is  what  role  BPKP  and  its  central  staff  of  about \n1,700 could fulfill at the central level of Government. The following suggestions were presented \nfor discussion: \n \n\nPre-audit services for Government. Article 58 of Treasury Law 01/04 requires the \nestablishment of an internal control system, of which pre-audit could be a strong \nelement. \nGovernment  support  for  anticorruption  measures.  BPKP  has  contributed  to  this \neffort by providing expertise and personnel to help conduct investigative audits. \nNational training center. Given BPKP\u2019s training facilities and experience, it could \nserve as an independent training center for internal auditors. \nService provider. Two aspects were outlined: (a) appointing an internal auditor to \ncentral  Government  bodies  that  are  too  small  to  warrant  establishing  their  own \ninternal audit function, and (b) providing demand-based internal audit services to \nhelp  other  internal  auditors  overcome  peak  period  or  specialized  needs.  Such \nservices would be carried out on a cost-recovery or profit basis. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  role  of  internal  audit  institutions  will  be  considered  by  the  interministerial  steering \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n33\n\n8. \ncommittee. \n \n9. \nresources not be allocated between BPKP and BPK.  \n \n\nFigure  A1  was  formulated  to  reflect  the  increasing  costs  of  the  state  audit  function \n\nFigure A1: Graph of Potential Costs of Audit Sector Maintaining the Status Quo of BPKPa \n \n\nChart of Internal Audit Costs (Rupiah billions) \n\n2000 \n\n2001\n\n2002\n\nYear\n\nTotal \nBPKP (Routine & Development)\n\nInspector General  (Routine & Development)\nBPK (Routine & Development) \n\n BPK  (State  Audit  Board  of  Indonesia),  BPKP  (Government  Internal  Audit  Agency),  IGs  Inspector  Generals  of \ngovernment departments. \nSource: ADB. 2003.

community \nfor  some  years,  the  public  audit  function  has  not  been  a  priority  for  assistance.  The  need  for \nstrong fiduciary arrangements has been stressed in the joint Asian Development  Bank (ADB)-\nWorld  Bank  2001  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment,  and  the  ADB  country \ngovernance  assessment  carried  out  in  preparation  of  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  for \nIndonesia 2003-2005. Over the past 5 years, a limited amount of external assistance has been \nprovided  to  help  the  Government  strengthen  individual  audit  organizations,  primarily  the  Audit \nBoard  of  Indonesia  (BPK)  and  the  central  government  internal  auditor  (BPKP).  However,  no \nexternal assistance has been provided to the public sector audit function as a whole. While the \nspecific institution-based capacity-building efforts have been useful, there is also an unmet need \nto  establish  a  clear  vision  for  the  future  institutional  framework  for  Indonesia\u2019s  audit  function. \nFurther,  the  significant  changes  and  requirements  brought  about  by  democratization  and \ndecentralization have yet to be addressed. \n \n2. \nIn summary, the limited amount of external assistance provided to the Government has \nbeen focused on strengthening individual audit organizations, whereas this proposed ADB loan \nis aimed at the public sector audit function as a whole. \n \n\nTable A3: Past, Ongoing, and Expected Projects \n \n\nReference \n\nApproval \n\nEA \n\nDescription \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nDec 2002  MOHA \n\n42.220 \n\nAsian Development Bank \nADB 2002.

Fiscal  consolidation  has  received  priority  attention\namong  them.  The White  Paper  adopted  in September  2003, to smoothen  the transition following\nIndonesia's  em \nfrom  the  International  Monetary  Fund-supported  Program,  supported  the\nformulation  of  a  sound  policy,  institutional,  legal  and  regulatory  framework  to  achieve  fiscal\nconsolidation.  The  Government  and  Parliament  worked  closely  to  enact  three  major  laws  in  a\nspan  of  15 months:  the  State  Finance  Law (Law  17/2003), the State Treasury  Law (Law 1/2004)\nand  the  State Audit  Law  (Law  15/2004). The  aim of these  laws is to promote  fiscal  responsibility\nand  enhance  accountability  and transparency  in public financial management.\n\n2. \nConcurrently,  the  Government  has  been  working  closely  with  the  Asian  Development\nBank  (ADB)  in  operationalizing  the  new  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  Public  Audit\nfunctions.  With  the  support  provided  under  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA),\nan \ninter-agency  Steering  Committee  established  by  the  Government  has  assessed  the\nstrengths  and  weaknesses  of  state  audit  institutions  in  Indonesia.  Our  premise  in  undertaking\nsuch  an  assessment \njointly  with  the  ADB  is  that  efficient  and  well-structured  state  audit\ninstitutions  are  an  integral  part  of  an  effective  and  well  functioning  accountability  framework\nincluding  the  executive,  Parliament,  and  civil  society.  As  an  ex  post  exercise  on  public  sector\nmanagement,  audit  provides  an  independent,  objective  and  a  professionally  conducted\nassessment  on  the  veracity,  accuracy.  credibility I and  reliability of  information  on the  economy I\neffectiveness,  and  efficiency  of  Government.  State  auditing  arrangements  need  sound external\naudit  (reporting  to the  legislature)  and internal  audit  (reporting to the executive)  functions.\n\n3. \nBy  way  of  background,  in  Indonesia,  the  Badan  Pemeriksa  Keuangan  (BPK)  is  the\nexternal  auditor  and  Indonesia's  Supreme  Audit  Institution  (SAI).  For  internal  audit,  at  the\ncentral  level  of  government,  there  is the  Inspectorate  General  (IG)  in each  ministry  that  reports\ndirectly  to  the  minister.  At  the  same  time  there  is  also  Badan  Pengawasan  Keuangan  dan\nPembangunan \n(BPKP)  that  reports  directly  to  the  President  but  outside  of  any  particular\nministry.  At the  regional  government  level,  regional  internal audit agencies  (Bawasdas)  report to\nthe  respective  chief  executive.  In 2001,  amendments  to the  Indonesian  Constitution  significantly\nexpanded  BPK's  mandate,  to  cover  virtually  the  entire  public  sector  at  the  central  as  well  as\nlocal  government  levels.\n\nPublic  sector  audit  institutions  require  a  number  of  critical  attributes  to  promote  the\n4. \noverall  objective  of  fiscal  transparency  and  accountability  at  ex ante  as  well  as  ex  post  levels.\nAmong \nlegal  and  institutional  framework;  adequate  capacity  in  the\ninstitutions  commensurate  with  their  mandate;  an  efficient  allocation  of  resources  between\n\nthese  are:  a  strong \n\nt.\n\n\fAppendix \n\n5\n\n45\n\ndifferent  institutions;  effective  oversight  by  Parliament  and  follow  up  by  the  Executive;  and full\n. transparency  in  the  audit  process.  While  Indonesia  has  had  experience  with  public  sector\n\nauditing  for  several  decades,  our  assessment  as  part  of  the  PPT A  has  shown  that  some  of\nthese  attributes  were  lacking  in Indonesia.\n\n5. \nThe  Government  has  made  a  conscious  attempt  to  address  some  of  the  legal\nweaknesses  through  the  adoption  of the  3  major  laws that  I have  outlined  in para.1 above.  It is\nthe  Government's  understanding  that there  are  efforts within the  Parliament  as well as the  BPK\nto  strengthen the  legal framework for  BPK. The  Ministry of  Finance (MOF), in  line  with  its\nauthority  to  ensure  overall  public  sector  financial  accountability,  shall  be  the  coordinator  on\nbehalf of the  Executive  to liaise with  Parliament  in the adoption  of a revised  BPK Law.\n\n~\n\n6. \nIn  order  to  address  the  other  areas  of  weaknesses  in  our  auditing  framework,  the\nGovernment  requested  ADB  to  formulate  a  Sector  Development  Program.  We  appreciate  that\nADB  has  worked  closely  with  the  Government  over  the  past  year  to  formulate  the proposed\nState  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  (STAR-SDP).  The  Government  team\nendorses  the  overall  goal  of  the  proposed  program,  which  is to  enhance  governance,  and the\nefficiency,  economy  and  effectiveness  of  public  sector  audit  through  strengthened  audit\ninstitutions  operating  to  internationally  accepted  standards.  Based on our discussions with ADB,\nwe  have  agreed  that  the  objectives  of  the  Program  will  be:  an  improved  policy  and  legal\nframework  for state audit  institutions;  a strengthened  and efficiently aligned  operating framework\nfor external  and  internal  audit;  enhanced  accountability  and oversight  of the public audit function\nat all  levels of  government;  and  increased  public  awareness  of the  benefits  of audit and what it\ncan deliver.\n\n7. \nThe  fundamental  principles  on  which  the  STAR-SOP  is  based  are  critical  to  note, from\nthe  Government's  point  of  view:  (i)  a  clear  delineation  between  the  intemal  and  external  audit\ninstitutions  and  functions;  (ii)  the  restructuring  of  the  audit  institutions  and  functions,  to\nrecognize  and  align  them  with  the  ongoing  decentralization  process;  (iii)  the  elimination  of\noverlap  in  the  mandates  of  the  public  sector  audit  institutions;  and  (iv)  the  achievement  of\noverall cost efficiency.\n\n8. \nIn  line  with  these  principles,  the  Government  has agreed  that  the  policy  component  of\nthe  SOP  should  focus  on:  (i)  rationalization  of  the  policy,  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for\nstate  audit  institutions;  (ii)  alignment  and  provision  of  resources  to  enable  audit  institutions  to\nfulfill their  mandate;  (iii) enhanced  oversight  on audit  recommendations  and of the audit function\nat  the  central  and  regional  level;  and  (iv)  enhanced  transparency  and  public  awareness  of  the\nstate audit  function  at the central  and regional levels.\n\nThe  government \n\nis  particularly  cognizant  of  the  need  to  strengthen  the  external  and\n9. \ninternal  audit  functions  at  the  regional  level.  The  Government  accepts  the  need to  expand  the\npresence  of  BPK  as  the  external  auditor  in  line  with  the  2002  constitutional  amendments.\nFurther,  the  Government  is aware  of the  stipulation  in the State  Finances  Law for  BPK to audit\nthe  accountability  statements  of  all  the  regional  governments  beginning  with  the  fiscal  year\n2006.  At the  same  time the  Govemment  is also aware of redundancy in the central internal audit\ninstitutions, \nlatter  will  necessitate  a\ncomprehensive  review of the current  institutional  arrangement  in intemal  audit in order to ensure\nan  effective  and  cost  efficient  utilization  of  resources  in the  audit  sector.  The  Government  has\nestablished  an  interministerial  committee  to  look  into  the  intemal  control  systems,  which  will,\namongst  other  matters,  look  into  and  make  recommendations  on  the  optimal  institutional\narrangements  for  internal  audit  at  the  regional  level. A Govemment  regulation  will  be  produced\nthat will delineate  the  need for further  Govemment  decrees on this matter.\n\nthe  Bawasda,  and \n\nthe  creation  of \n\nfollowing \n\nthe \n\n\f46\n\nAppendix\n\n5\n\n10. \nMr.  Chino,  through  this  letter  outlining  our  development  policy  in the  state  audit  sector,\nthe  Government  indicates  its strong  commitment  to pursuing  all the  reform  measures  outlined  in\nthe  Policy Matrix  {Attachment  1}. Through  these measures,  the Government  aims to achieve the\nmilestones  in  the  White  Paper.  We  believe  the  adoption  of  the  3  framework  laws  has  set  the\ntone  for  reforms  to  enhance  the  quality  of  internal  controls  within  the  public  sector.  The  other\nlegal,  regulatory  and  institutional  measures  to  be  achieved  as  part  of  STAR-SOP  will  improve\nthe  quality  of  external  oversight  and  the  level  of  public  participation  relative  to  fiscal\ntransparency.  More  importantly,  it  will  help  the  Government  address  the  over-riding  concerns\nwith  regard  to the  misalignment  of resources.  This would  be in line with the  Government's  focus\non  fiscal  consolidation  as  a  priority  area,  as  part  of  which  we  have  increasingly  stressed  the\nimportance  of  sound  public  expenditure  management  to  ensure  fiscal  sustainability  and  reap\npublic  sector  efficiency  gains  and  budgetary  savings.  The  Investment  Component  of  the  SOP\nwill  help  enhance  the  public  sector  audit  capacity  and  improve  the  quality  of  the  oversight\n\nprocess  significantly.\n\n11. \nLet  me  thank  you  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  on  behalf  of  the  Government  of\nIndonesia,  for  your  commitment  and  support  for  structural,  policy  and  sectoral  reforms  in\nIndonesia  in  a  number  of  areas.

Poverty reduction has been \npersistently slow following the financial crisis and remains at near 1996 levels.1 Following decentralization in 2001, \nlocal government became the principle agent for poverty reduction and achieving of millennium development goals \n(MDGs). Local governments are responsible for delivery of most basic services required by the poor.2 The principal \ninstrument  used  by  local  government  is  the  budget,  but  inadequate  safeguards,  including  the  audit  framework, \nprevent its effective use.  \n \nThe Government is preparing a poverty reduction strategy.3 The draft paper calls recognizes weak governance as \none  of  the  primary  cause  of  poverty  and  calls  for  efficient  and  service-oriented  government  and  pro-poor \nbudgeting.  The  Government-ADB  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  also  recognized  the  need  to \n\u201cenhance local government transparency, accountability to reflect local aspirations and needs.\u201d  \n\n  No \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nThe STARSDP addresses the key obstructions to poverty reduction by enabling central and local governments to \neffectively plan, budget, and deliver poverty reduction initiatives by rationalizing the audit framework, strengthening \nthe audit institutions, increasing oversight on audit recommendations and accountability, and increasing public \nawareness of audit results and their meaning.  \n \nReform of the state audit functions ensures provides feedback on budgetary implementation of policy and how to \nincrease its efficiency, prevents and corrects improper use of the budget, and provides information about program \noperations and results for future policy and budget planning. Transparency of audit functions and audit results \nenables the legislature and public to determine whether the Government is delivering on its promises and whether \npolicy platforms have been turned into action.  \n \nThe STARSDP will enable the Government to deliver its mandate more effectively. In itself, the program does not \nreduce poverty, but it establishes a fundamental basis for accountability in the public sector. Other concomitant \nefforts such as preparation of local poverty reduction strategies raise poverty awareness within government and \ncivil society to ensure the pro-poor content of that mandate. \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs  there a participation strategy? \n\nPotential Issues \n\nSubject \n\n  Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n   No \n\nStrategy to Address \nIssues \n\nOutput Prepared \n\nSignificant, Not \nSignificant, Uncertain, \nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nResettlement \nGender \nAffordability \nLabor \nIndigenous People \nOthers Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \n\n                                                 \n1  Estimated at 15.1% in 2003, which is comparable with 15.7% in 1996.  \n2   Water supply, sanitation, health, education, local roads. \n3   Submitted by the task force to the Poverty Reduction Secretariat on 28 May 2004. \n\n \nB. \n\n \nC. \n\n \nD. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n65\n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nTechnical Assistance to PLMU ($1.3 million) \n\n \n1. \nTo help complete the policy matrix conditions and increase project reporting and project \nmonitoring  assistance,  the  Investment  Loan  Monitoring  Unit  (ILMU)  and  Program  Loan \nMonitoring Unit (PLMU) will receive technical assistance (TA). \n \nA. \n \n2. \npolicy matrix components. \n \n3. \nthe Netherlands will finance $1.3 million, and the Government of Indonesia, $0.3 million. \n \n\nThe total cost of the TA will be $1.6 million, of which the grant from the Government of \n\nTA  will  be  provided  to  the  PLMU  through  a  range  of  experts  to  assist  in  the  four  main \n\nTable A13.1 Financing Plan \n($ \u2018000) \nForeign\n\nLocal\n\n   Item\n\n Cofinanced\n Government of Indonesia\n    Total\n\nTotal\n\nPercent\n\n678.0\n0.0\n678.0\n\n622.1\n324.8\n946.9\n\n1,300.0\n324.8\n1,624.9\n\n80.0\n20.0\n100.0\n\n                 Source: ADB 2004.

Indonesia  is  divided  into  30 \nprovinces and over 400 districts. Average population per province is slightly less than 7 million, \nand  about  0.5  million  per  district.  However,  there  are  significant  variations:  the  province  of \nGorontalo  has  less  than  1  million  people,  while  East  Java  is  home  to  over  35  million;  and \ndistricts show variability between 20,000 to over 4 million. \n \nAt present there is no universal approach among the external funding agencies on the \n2 \nselection  of  districts  though  there  is  general  agreement  conceptually  that,  to  varying  degrees \ngood governance, competition and selectivity must be part of that process. There are at present \nno standard governance filters, and there is discussion as to whether it is possible to establish \nnationwide  governance  filters.  It  is  also  recognized  that  given  that  decentralization  is  still  at  a \nnascent  phase  technical  assistance  support  may  be  required  so  as  not  to  exclude  those \nregional  governments  who  have  the  desire  but  not  the  resources  to  achieve  the  desired \ngovernance standard for further support.  \n \n3 \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  currently  utilizing  the  above  principles  to  design  a \nmore robust regional selection framework as part of the second tier filter. A draft paper has been \nprepared  and  some  staged  criteria  have  been  developed.  The  draft  also  reviewed  and \nincorporated elements of the current World Bank selection framework and its application in two \nproposed investment projects. The STARSDP incorporated the key elements of the above and \nwill identify districts utilizing the elements in Table A14.1 below in the following way. \n \n\nTable A14.2: STARSDP Criteria for Selection of Regional Governments \n\nPhase \nIdentification \nPhase \n\nPre-Investment-\nSecond Phase \n\n \n\n \n\nDetailed Requirements \nRegions  to  be  selected  having  strong \nsupport  from  the  head  of  regions  to \nstrengthen  Bawasda  functions.  Further, \nanother    criteria  for  the  identification  of \ncandidates  to  participate  in  the  STAR \nproject are: \n \n\n(i)  BAWASDA that has strong interest \nto participate in the project \n(ii)  BAWASDA  that  has  insufficient \ninfrastructure \nto  conduct  effective \naudit. \n(iii)  BAWASDA  that  has  inadequate \nHuman  Resources  quality  to  conduct \nsupervision functions. \n(iv) Head of Regions (Governor, \nBupati, Walikota) then to submit a \n\u201cletter of interest\u201d, expressing Regions \ninterest to participate in the STARSDP \nprogram. \n\n \n \nTo  qualify  getting  s  support  from  the \nto  ensure \nSTARSDP,  MOHA-IG  has \nregions  have \nrequirement  as \nfollows: \n(i) Submission of the draft local regulation \n(PERDA  or  SK  Bupati)  within  6months \nafter  receipts  the  guidance  from  MOHA \nroles  of \nstrengthening \nabout \n\nfulfilled \n\nthe \n\nVerification/Support \n\nMOHA-IG to  \n(i) Advertise the STAR SDP project highlighting \nthe three type of funds (grants) to be given to the \nregional governments namely \n-Capacity Building for Bawasda $115,000 \n-Educational Scholarship for Bawasda   $ 50,000 \n-Capacity building for DPRD  $30,000 \n(ii) Verify fiscal capacity and certify the eligibility \nof the local governments \n(iii) Compile letters of agreement from the local \ngovernments (to cover Bawasda and DPRD \nSecretariat) \n \n \n \n\nMOHA IG to  \n(i)  review  content  of  draft  local  regulations,  and \ncertify eligibility before submission to ADB.  \n(ii)  Eligibility  will  verify  that  the  local  regulation \nwas  submitted,  that  there  were  public  hearings \nand  minutes  of \nthat  public \ncomments  were  considered,  and  that  content \nsatisfies the objectives of the original draft. \n\nthe  meetings, \n\n\fPhase \n\nDetailed Requirements \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n71\n\nVerification/Support \n(iii)  Review  the  needs  assessment,  budget  and \ndevelopment  plan  and  certify  feasibility  of  the \nproposals. \n \n\n \n\nInvestment \nphase-Third \nPhase- \n\nMOHA IG to  \n(i)  submit  copies  of  the  legislation  to  ADB \ncertifying  that  the  they  are  satisfactory  in  form \nand substance. \n(ii)  submit  institutional  development  plans  for \nBAWASDA and DPRD Secretariat. \n(iii)  submit  copy  of  the  letter  of  readiness \nindication  the  satisfaction  of  conditions  listed \nunder  the  letter  of  readiness.(iv)  to  log  the \nsubmission in a database \n\nbe \n\nthe \n\nsame \n\nBawasda. \n(ii)  Assessment  needs  of  BAWASDA \nsubmitted  within \ntime \nidentifying physical and human resources \nrequirements of the BAWASDA, including \nplans  on  how  to  sustain  BAWASDA\u2019s \noperations  and  maintenance,  training, \neducation  and  certification  of  investment \nsupport  that  is  to  be  provided.
