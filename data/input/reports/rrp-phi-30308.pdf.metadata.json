As  a\nresult  of  population  growth,  urbanization,  and  industrial  activities,\nthe  indiscriminate  discharge  of  untreated  municipal  and  industrial\nwastewater and solid waste exceeds the absorptive capacity of the\nriver  system,  and  the  Pasig  River  has  become  seriously  polluted.\nThe  riverbanks  are  characterized  by  low  grade,  blighted  urban\ndevelopment,  including  extensive  squatter  settlements,  depressed\nresidential  areas,  and  large  tracts  of  derelict  industrial  land.  To\nfull  socioeconomic\nrestore \ndevelopment  potential  of  the  Pasig  River  and  the  adjacent  urban\nareas, it is necessary to rehabilitate the river system, restore water\nquality, limit and control wastewater discharges, and promote urban\nrenewal along the riverbanks.\n\nthe  environment  and  realize \n\nthe \n\nClassification\n\nPrimary: Environment\nSecondary: Human Development\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  completed\nand its summary is attached as an appendix.\n\nThe Sector Development Program\n\nObjectives and\nScope\n\nThe  SDP  objective  is  to  promote  policy  reforms  and  physical\nimprovements  to  enhance  the  water  quality  of  the  Pasig  River,  its\ntributaries,  and  esteros,  to  Class  C  standard  by  2014.  Class  C\nstandard river water is capable of sustaining aquatic life, is suitable\nfor secondary contact sports, and after treatment, may be used for\nindustrial  processes.  The  SDP  will  promote  the  implementation  of\nan integrated package of policy reforms and investments contained\nin  the  Pasig  River  Development  Plan  (PRDP).  The  components\ninclude measures to improve water quality, and actions to promote\nurban  renewal  and  redevelopment  along  the  riverbanks.  These\nactivities  will  bring  about  improvements  in  living  conditions  and\npublic health standards for riverside communities. The components\ninclude  measures  to  (i)  establish  and  develop  10-meter  (m)  wide\n\n\fPolicy Framework\nand Actions\n\nCapacity Building\n\nThe Investment\nProject\n\niii\n\nenvironmental  preservation  areas  (EPAs)  along  the  riverbanks,  (ii)\nupgrade infrastructure and provide municipal services and facilities\nin  urban  renewal  areas  adjacent  to  EPAs,  (iii)  introduce  a  septic\ntank  maintenance  service  and  provide  a  septage  treatment  facility\nto  reduce  the  volume  of  untreated  municipal  wastewater  being\ndischarged  into  the  river,  and  (iv)  eliminate  the  illegal  dumping  of\nmunicipal solid waste into the river system.\n\nThe  agreed  policy framework includes (i) approving,  adopting,  and\nimplementing  the  first  phase  of  the  PRDP  from  2000-2004;  (ii)\nproviding  sanitation  services  in  addition  to  the  targets  set  in  the\nMetropolitan  Manila  Waterworks  and  Sewerage  System  (MWSS)\nconcession  agreements;  (iii)  establishing  for  Metro  Manila  a\nwastewater  discharge  permit  system  with  a  progressive  tariff\nstructure;  (iv)  improving  domestic  solid  waste  management  for\nriverside barangays; (v) establishing EPAs along the riverbanks and\nundertaking  urban  renewal  in  adjacent  areas;  (vi)  reviewing,\nstrengthening,  and  unifying  the  environmental  regulations  and\ndischarge standards; (vii) strengthening the water quality monitoring\nand  enforcement  capability  and  capacity;  (viii)  enhancing  public\nawareness  of  environmental  issues;  and  (ix)  strengthening  the\ninstitutional  capacity  of  agencies  concerned  with  environmental\nmanagement.\n\nA  TA  will  develop  the  capacity  of  the  Pasig  River  Rehabilitation\nCommission,  the  Metro  Manila  Development  Authority  (MMDA),\nand  beneficiary  local  government  units  (LGUs)  to  implement  the\nPRDP.\n\nThe  investment  Project  includes  urban  renewal  covering  the\nestablishment  of  EPAs  along  the  riverbanks  and  infrastructure\nimprovements  for  adjacent  urban  renewal  areas.  This  will  involve\nthe  relocation  of  approximately  10,000  squatter  families  currently\nliving  within  EPAs  and  the  redevelopment  of  the  vacated  areas  as\nriverside parks and promenades.\n\nUrban  renewal  will  support  the  upgrading  of  approximately  500\nhectares  (ha)  of  depressed  urban  residential  areas  at  different\nlocations along the river. This will benefit about 80,000 low-income\nfamilies.  Two  high  priority,  pilot  areas  of  low-income,  depressed\nhousing \u2014 Sta.

A further 80,000 families (about 440,000 people)\nliving  in  urban  renewal  areas  will  benefit  from  upgrading,  including\nthe  provision  of  basic  municipal  services,  essential  infrastructure,\nand security of tenure. Pasig River water quality will be improved by\nreducing \nindustrial\nthe  discharge  of  polluted  municipal  and \nwastewater  to  the  river  system,  and  reducing  the  amount  of  solid\nwaste  being  dumped.  About  185,000  households  (1.0  million\npeople)  will  directly  benefit  from  the  sanitation  service.  The  entire\npopulation  of  Metro  Manila  (about  10  million  people)  will  indirectly\nbenefit  from  improved  environmental  conditions  and  a  cleaner,\ngreener, and healthier Pasig River basin.\n\nBenefits derive mainly from water quality improvements in the Pasig\nRiver,  and  improvements  in  environmental  quality  along  the\nriverbanks  and  adjacent  urban  areas.  The  benefits  are  generated\njointly  by  the  Project  and  other  projects  and  programs.  The\neconomic  analysis  assessed  the  incremental  impact  of  the  Project\non  water  quality  and  the  urban  environment,  taking  into  account\nattributable  improvements.

Specific\narrangements  to  minimize  these  risks  are  incorporated  in  the  SDP\ndesign.  The  Government  has  shown  strong  commitment  to  the\nPasig  River  rehabilitation,  identifying  it  as  a  flagship  project.  The\nOffice  of  the  Government  Corporate  Counsel  has  issued  a  legal\nopinion stating that under the Concession Agreement the provision\nof sanitation services is not an exclusive right granted to the MWSS\nconcessionaires.  The  policy  loan  will  be  released  in  tranches\nagainst  the  achievement  of  predetermined  policy  objectives,  and\nthe Government has agreed that adequate counterpart funds will be\nallocated for the Project. The investment loan is expected to restore\nthe  environment,  improve  living  conditions,  raise  public  health\nstandards,  and  deliver  essential  infrastructure  and  basic  municipal\nservices  for  the  riverside  communities.

In  general,\npeople  are  willing  to  relocate  provided  that  there  are  employment\nopportunities  and  access  to  transport,  education,  and  other  social\nservices.  Through  the  SDP,  it  is  proposed  to  give  people  an\nelement  of  choice  for  relocation,  including  a  range  of  in-city  and\nnear-to-town  sites  that  will  be  developed  with  a  full  range  of\n\nundertaken  with \n\ncommunities, \n\n\fvii\n\nservices  and  facilities.

The rapid urban growth is driven by high population growth\nand  an  influx  of  rural  migrants  attracted  by  the  economic  opportunities  available  in  expanding\ncities.  For  Metro  Manila,  population  growth  has  far  outstripped  the  rate  at  which  basic\ninfrastructure  and  essential  municipal  services  have  been  provided.  The  result  is  a  severely\novercrowded, congested, and environmentally degraded city that is beset with traffic problems;\nair  and  water  pollution;  and  inadequate  sanitation,  sewerage,  drainage,  and  solid  waste\nmanagement  facilities.  Ineffective  land  management  and  development  control  policies,  and\ninappropriate  land  use  zoning  have  resulted  in  an  incompatible  mix  of  industrial,  commercial,\nand  residential  activities,  interspersed  with  a  proliferation  of  slum  areas  and  squatter\nsettlements. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has already provided assistance1 to tackle air\npollution  problems  in  Metro  Manila,  and  as  part  of  an  integrated  environmental  management\npackage is now focusing on the problems of water quality management.\n\n3.\nIn  the  urban  areas,  particularly  Metro  Manila,  economic  growth,  industrial  operations,\ncommercial  activity,  and  rising  living  standards  have  led  to  a  massive  increase  in  water\nconsumption.  As  a  consequence,  the  volume  of  wastewater  has  also  risen  dramatically.\nBecause wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal facilities are extremely limited in Metro\nManila, most of the polluted wastewater is discharged, untreated, to the public drainage system\nand ultimately enters natural water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and the sea, causing pollution\nand  environmental  damage.  In  Metro  Manila,  the  Pasig  River  system  has  been  severely\ndamaged  by  the  discharge  of  polluted  wastewater.  The  volume  of  pollution  discharge  far\nexceeds  the  assimilative  capacity  of  the  river,  and  water  quality  is  below  all  the  basic\nenvironmental standards set for the river. The Government has acknowledged this problem and\nthe  Philippine  Medium-Term\nthrough \nDevelopment Plan3 is focusing greater attention on environmental concerns as a development\nissue.  For  future  development,  the  Government  plans  to  initiate  a  sustainable  development\nprocess  that  respects  the  environment.  The  SDP  is  a  prototype  aimed  at  supporting  the  first\nphase of a long-term river environmental management and rehabilitation program.\n\nthe  Philippine  National  Development  Plan,2  and \n\n4.\nThe Government recognizes the historic, cultural, and economic importance of the Pasig\nRiver  system  to  Metro  Manila  and  the  country.  Over  the  years,  the  river  system  has  become\nheavily  polluted  through  the  uncontrolled  and  indiscriminate  discharge  of  untreated  industrial\nand municipal wastewater and solid waste. The Government has set a high priority on restoring\n                                                          \n1 Loan  1663-PHI: Metro Manila Air Quality Improvement Sector Development Program,  for  $200  million,  approved\n\n2 National Economic and Development Authority. 1998.

The results of the TA and ADB missions show that to substantially reduce pollution due\nto the discharge of untreated wastewater, it is necessary to (i) improve the physical facilities for\nthe  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal  of  municipal  wastewater,  industrial  wastewater,  and\ndomestic  solid  waste;  (ii)  redevelop  the  urban  areas  in  the  vicinity  of  the  riverbanks;  and  (iii)\nstrengthen the institutional capacity of the Government agencies responsible for environmental\nmonitoring and enforcement.\n\n5.\nThe  achievement  of  sustainable  improvements  in  Pasig  River  water  quality  and  the\nencouragement of urban renewal will require the Government to adopt and implement a policy\nreform  agenda.  Accordingly,  an  outline  policy  framework  was  developed  during  fact-finding,\naimed  at  (i)  approving  and  adopting  the  PRDP,  (ii)  expanding  and  advancing  sanitation\ncoverage  targets,  (iii)  introducing  the  polluter  pays  principle  to  Metro  Manila,  (iv)  introducing\ncommunity-based  solid  waste  management,  (v)  establishing  environmental  preservation  areas\n(EPAs)  along  the  riverbanks,  (vi)  strengthening  environmental  standards  and  regulations,  (vii)\nstrengthening  water  quality  monitoring  and  enforcement  capability,  (viii)  enhancing  public\nawareness  of  environmental  issues,  and  (ix)  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of\nenvironmental management agencies. This policy framework was further developed and refined\nduring loan appraisal. It also became clear during fact-finding that, to support implementation of\nthe  policy  agenda  and  physical  improvements,  adoption  of  ADB\u2019s  SDP  modality  would  be  the\nappropriate approach. Consequently, the proposed SDP will comprise the program loan linked\nto  the  implementation  of  the  policy  reform  agenda  and  the  investment  loan  to  support  the\nimplementation of physical components and institutional capacity building.\n\nAt the request of the Government, ADB fielded the Appraisal Mission5 in July 1999. The\n6.\nMission  was  to  reach  an  agreement  on  the  Pasig  River  rehabilitation  program,  including  the\npolicy  reform  agenda,  the  proposed  loans  and  components,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,\ninstitutional  arrangements,  and  other  aspects.  The  Mission  focused  on  further  developing  the\nSDP and resolving outstanding issues, including firming up (i) the policy dialogue, (ii) sanitation\ncoverage  targets,  (iii)  resettlement  plan,  (iv)  local  government  participation,  (v)  loan  size  and\nconditions  for  tranche  releases  for  the  policy  loan,  and  (vi)  size  and  scope  of  the  investment\nloan.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  was  signed  by  the  Government  and  ADB  on  10\nSeptember  1999;  it  set  out  the  understandings  and  agreements  reached  by  the  Mission  and\nGovernment  representatives.  The  SDP  was  formulated  using  the  findings  of  ADB  missions;\ninformation  provided  by  the  Government;  discussions  with  other  funding  agencies,  bilateral\nfinancing  agencies,  and  private  sector  representatives;  dialogue  with  beneficiaries  and\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  and  the  results  of  the  TA.  The  program  framework  is\npresented in Appendix 1.\n\n                                                          \n4 TA  2803-PHI: Pasig River Environmental Management and Rehabilitation Project,  for  $800,000,  approved  on  29\n\nMay 1997. The TA was completed in April 1998.\n\n5  The  Mission  comprised  A.  Williams,  Senior  Urban  Development  Specialist/Mission  Leader;  S.N.  Zahid,  Senior\nSector  Specialist;  Fei  Yue,  Programs  Officer;  E.P.  Araneta,  Counsel;  R.  Jayewardene,  Social  Development\nSpecialist; J. Arthur, Urban Development Specialist/Staff Consultant; F. Waters, Urban Economic/Staff Consultant;\nD.  Velasco,  Municipal  Finance  Specialist/Staff  Consultant;  and  B.  Pallana,  Resettlement  Specialist/Staff\nConsultant.\n\n\f3\n\nIII.\n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nA.\n\nMacroeconomic Context\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Development Challenges\n\nThe  National  Statistics  Coordination  Board\u2019s  published  population  census  statistics6\n7.\nshow  that  the  national  population  grew  from  60.7  million  in  1990  to  68.6  million  in  1995,\nrepresenting  an  annual  average  growth  of  2.3  percent  over  the  intercensus  period.  Over  the\nsame period, the Metro Manila (National Capital Region) population grew from 7.8 million to 9.5\nmillion, representing an average annual growth of 3.3 percent. The population density of Metro\nManila  rose  from  about  12,500  persons  per  square  kilometer  (km2)  to  almost  15,000  (Metro\nManila\u2019s  land  area  is  636  km2).  The  census  population  projections  estimate  that  by  1999  the\nnational  population  would  be  74.7  million  and  will  reach  84.2  million  by  2005,  representing  an\naverage annual growth rate of about 2.1 percent. The Metro Manila population was estimated at\n10.2  million  in  1999  and  is  forecast  to  reach  11.3  million  by  2005,  representing  an  annual\naverage  growth  rate  of  about  1.8  percent;  a  considerable  slowdown  in  growth  rate  from  that\nexperienced in previous years.\n\n8.\nThe country\u2019s development potential rests on its well-educated population and abundant\nnatural  resources.  The  Government\u2019s  long-term  development  goal  is  to  transform  the  country\nfrom an agriculture- and natural resource-based economy to an industrialized economy. This is\nto be achieved with steady growth in per capita income, elimination of poverty, and reduction of\nsocial and economic inequities. The Government\u2019s growth targets, consistent with this long-term\ngoal, visualize gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the range of 4.7 percent for the period\n1999-2004. The Government also aims to significantly reduce poverty from the 1997 level of 32\npercent to about 25 percent by 2004.\n\nThe major long-term challenges faced by the economy include rapid population growth;\n9.\nthe high incidence of poverty, social and economic inequalities, low productivity, degradation of\nnatural  resources,  deteriorating  environment,  and  intense  international  competition.  To  tackle\nthese problems, the Government\u2019s economic planning and long-term development strategy set\nout in the Philippine National Development Plan and the Medium-Term Philippine Development\nPlan,  1999-2004  has  adopted  the  concept  of  sustainable  development.  The  Government  has\nconfirmed  its  commitment  to  sustainable  development  by  emphasizing  that  future  economic\ngrowth  should  be  compatible  with  environmental  protection  and  consistent  with \nthe\nenvironment\u2019s carrying capacity.\n\n2.\n\nRecent Economic Performance\n\nThe Asian currency crisis affected the Philippine peso and interrupted a phase of steady\n10.\neconomic growth since the early 1990s. This growth was accompanied by a decline in inflation\nfrom  18.7  percent  in  1991  to  5.1  percent  in  1997.  In  1996,  prudent  fiscal  management,\nmanageable  expenditure  programs,  and  improved  revenue  collection  performance  by  the\nBureau  of  Customs,  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue,  and  Bureau  of  the  Treasury,  which  together\ncollected  95  percent  of  the  total  national  revenues,  enabled  the  Government  to  achieve  a\nbudget surplus of P6.3 billion. In the second half of 1997, the Asian financial crisis struck and\naffected  several  countries  in  the  region,  including  the  Philippines.  In  July  1997  the  peso\nexchange  rate  was  allowed  to  float  and  depreciated  from  about  P26  to  the  dollar  to  P46  in\n\n                                                          \n6 National Statistical Coordination Board. 1997. 1997 Philippine Statistical Year Book. Manila.\n\n\f4\n\nJanuary  1998,  before  recovering  to  about  P40  to  the  dollar.  Nevertheless,  for  1997,  total\nrevenue  collection  increased  by  15  percent  due  mainly  to  the  privatization  revenues  of  P9.4\nbillion, an increase of 67 percent over the previous year. Through good fiscal management, the\nexpected increase in expenditures due to the inflationary effects of the crisis were limited to 16\npercent and the Government was able to register a budget surplus of P1.6 billion for 1997. The\nGovernment  felt  the  full  impact  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis  in  1998,  with  increased  inflation,\nnegative  economic  growth,  and  a  sharp  rise  in  unemployment.  The  economic  difficulties  have\nbeen further aggravated by the impact of the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, which probably had\na  more  severe  detrimental  impact  on  the  economy  than  the  Asian  currency  crisis.  Due  to\nprolonged  drought  followed  by  unseasonal  rainfall,  the  performance  of  the  agriculture  and\nfisheries  sectors  contracted  by  over  11  percent  in  1998,  posting  the  worst  performance  in  30\nyears. The El Ni\u00f1o episode cut the country\u2019s rice output by 30 percent and corn production by\n40  percent.  During  1998,  GDP  contracted  by  0.5  percent,  inflation  averaged  9.7  percent,  and\nunemployment rose from 9 percent to 10.3 percent. Interest payments rose by 28 percent from\nP78 billion in 1997 to P100 billion in 1998, mainly as a result of currency devaluation. Operation\nand  maintenance  expenditures  increased  by  24  percent  due  to  price  escalation.  During  the\nyear, Government revenues from Bureau of Customs and Bureau of the Treasury declined by\n20  percent  and  36  percent,  as  a  result  of  the  slowdown  in  industrial  activity.  Income  from\nprivatization declined by 82 percent, reflecting reduced Government activity and the prevailing\nweakness in the commercial and property sectors. The Government\u2019s overall fiscal performance\nresulted in a budget deficit of P50 billion in 1998.\n\n11.\nFollowing  the  negative  growth  recorded  in  1998,  the  Philippine  economy  started  to\nrecover  in  1999  and  GDP  grew  by  3.2  percent.  The  recovery  was  supported  by  a  revival  in\nagriculture,  which  grew  by  over  6  percent,  due  to  favorable  weather  conditions.  The  service\nsector remained resilient throughout the crisis period and grew by 4 percent in 1999. However,\nthe  industry  sector  remained  weak  and  posted  a  growth  rate  of  only  0.5  percent  in  1999.  The\nlingering  effects  of  weak  domestic  demand  and  low  investment  are  major  concerns  for  a\nsustained recovery. In 1999 the budget deficit was P111 billion, due to poor revenue collection\nand increased expenditure. The Government is expected to record budget deficits for the next\ntwo or three years.\n\n3.\n\nEconomic Prospects\n\n12.\nGiven the ongoing economic adjustments in the region, it is difficult to make a definitive\nassessment of the country\u2019s economic prospects. However, the Philippine economy is expected\nto  recover  to  its  precrisis  sustained  growth  path  in  the  medium  term.  The  exchange  rate\nadjustment  should  improve  the  international  competitiveness  of  Philippine  exports.  The\nadjustment should also discourage further expansion of the bubble created by the rapid growth\nof  foreign  currency  bank  credits  used  for  real  estate  investments.  Over  the  long  term,  the\neconomy  may  become  more  efficient,  as  a  result  of  the  adjustments  brought  about  by  the\ncurrency crisis.\n\n13.\nIn  the  short  term,  the  pace  of  economic  recovery  will  largely  depend  on  prudent\nmacroeconomic  management  and  exogenous  factors  such  as  weather  conditions  and  the\nregional economic environment. The Government faces the difficult task of maintaining crucial\npublic  investment  without  creating  a  large  deficit.  The  concomitant  problem  of  financing  the\ndeficit must be done in a manner that will prevent a rise in interest rates that could exacerbate\nthe difficulties of the corporate and banking sectors. The Government is, therefore, proposing to\nundertake  a  combination  of  external  and  domestic  borrowing,  including  borrowing  from\nmultilateral  institutions.  On  the  other  hand,  monetary  policy  must  balance  the  need  to  control\n\n\f5\n\ninflation with the credit needs of the economy. The Government will also have to take measures\nto ameliorate the social impact of the crisis and prevent a rise in poverty.\n\n14.\nThe long-term effects on the environment of the Asian financial crisis and the abnormal\nweather are difficult to assess at this stage, but are likely to be detrimental. The financial crisis\nhas forced more people into poverty, reversing recent trends of poverty reduction, and resulting\nin increases in the incidence of joblessness, squatting, and migration to the cities from the rural\nareas.  This  will  put  further  pressure  on  already  overstretched  housing,  water,  sanitation,  and\nother municipal services. Also, Government agencies and private sector entities are feeling the\nstrains of the financial crisis and are cutting back on expenditure.\n\nB.\n\nSector Description and Recent Performance\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Overview\n\n15.\nThe  sector  may  be  defined  as  the  urban  environment,  with  specific  reference  to\nwastewater  management  and  urban  renewal  for  Metro  Manila.  Sector  indicators  are  given  in\nAppendix 2. According to the Philippine National Development Plan, the Philippine environment\nis classified by the following types of ecosystems: (i) uplands and forests comprising 45 percent\nof the country\u2019s land area and supporting about 30 percent of the people; (ii) coastal and marine\nareas comprising about 80 percent of the country\u2019s territory; (iii) urban areas inhabited by more\nthan  half  the  nation\u2019s  population;  (iv)  agriculture  and  croplands  occupying  almost  10  million\nhectares  (ha),  about  34  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  land  area;  and  (v)  freshwater  systems\ncomprising 384 major rivers and 59 lakes. The Pasig River is part of the freshwater ecosystem\nand has an impact on each of the other ecosystem types. The river is part of the Laguna Lake\ncatchment  basin,  which  is  the  nation\u2019s  largest  freshwater  lake.  The  basin  includes  extensive\nupland and forest areas, as well as substantial agricultural lands. The river discharges into the\ncoastal  marine  ecosystem  at  Manila  Bay  and  passes  through  the  densely  developed  heart  of\nMetro Manila, the country\u2019s largest and most significant urban area.\n\n16.\nPollution  of  freshwater  ecosystems  is  a  major  environmental  problem.  Four  of  Metro\nManila\u2019s  six  rivers,  including  the  Pasig  River,  are  biologically  dead.  Water  quality  monitoring\nshows  that  the  pollution  concentrations  exceed  the  levels  required  to  meet  the  water  quality\nstandards designated by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for the\nriver.  The  main  sources  of  water  pollution  are  domestic  wastewater,  industrial  wastewater,\nsurface water runoff from urban areas, and chemicals from agricultural fertilizer and pesticides.\nMajor  lakes  in  the  country,  particularly  Laguna  Lake,  Lake  Danao,  and  Lake  Lanao  are\nthreatened  by  siltation  from  soil  erosion  and  pollution  from  agricultural,  industrial,  and  urban\nactivities.  Eutrophication  is  a  common  phenomenon  due  to  discharges  of  untreated  domestic\nand industrial sewage, and surface water runoff from agricultural land and urban areas.\n\n17.\nUrban decay is also a growing environmental problem. Metro Manila accounts for about\n14 percent of the total Philippine population and approximately 30 percent of the nation\u2019s urban\npopulation.  Rapid  urbanization  has  brought  with  it  a  proliferation  of  informal,  unserviced,  and\novercrowded settlements. The absence of effective land use planning and urban management\nhas  resulted  in  the  deterioration  of  cities,  particularly  Metro  Manila,  as  human  habitats.  The\nmetropolis  is  now  beset  with  problems  including  traffic  congestion;  dilapidated  road  network;\ninsufficient public transport; inadequate water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management\nservices; drainage and flood control problems; air pollution; and water pollution.\n\n\f6\n\n2.\n\nThe Pasig River System\n\n18.\nThe  Pasig  River  is  a  major  river  of  national  significance  in  the  historic,  cultural,  and\ncommercial  life  of  the  Philippines.  The  river  is  an  important  navigation  route  for  barges\ntransporting bulk goods and materials between factories located along the riverbanks and ships\nanchored  in  Manila  Bay.  The  river  also  provides  an  important  drainage  and  flood  protection\nfunction  for  Metro  Manila.  In  the  past,  the  Pasig  River  was  an  important  transport  route  for\npeople  and  a  major  recreational  amenity.  The  Pasig  River  system  is  a  complex  waterway\nnetwork  comprising  the  Pasig,  Marikina,  and  San  Juan  rivers  and  numerous  small  streams\n(esteros)  and  drainage  canals.  The  Pasig  River  is  the  main  outlet  from  Laguna  Lake  and  the\nriver  system  flows  to  Manila  Bay  through  approximately  27  km  of  flat,  coastal  plain  and  the\nhighly urbanized and densely developed part of Metro Manila. The San Juan River, which drains\nmost  of  Quezon  City  and  the  municipality  of  San  Juan,  joins  the  Pasig  River  about  9  km\nupstream from Manila Bay. The Marikina River, which rises in the Sierra Madre mountains, joins\nthe  Pasig  River  about  19  km  upstream  from  Manila  Bay.  The  total  catchment  basin  area  for\nLaguna  Lake,  Pasig  River,  and  all  the  tributaries  covers  about  4,150  km2.  The  SDP  area  is\ndefined  as  the  most  densely  populated  part  of  the  river  basin  within  Metro  Manila,  comprising\nabout 215 km2, or about 5 percent of the drainage basin land area, including the Pasig River,\nMarikina River downstream from Marikina Bridge, and the San Juan River. The river is tidal, and\nthe  flow  is  subject  to  wide  seasonal  variations,  with  high  flows  reaching  275  cubic  meters  per\nsecond  (m3/sec)  occurring  between  October  and  November,  and  low  flows  dropping  to  12\nm3/sec  between  April  and  May.  The  highest  flows  occur  during  the  rainy  season,  when  large\nparts  of  the  urban  area  are  susceptible  to  frequent  flooding,  particularly  in  the  vicinity  of  the\nriverbanks.  Low  river  flows  occur  during  the  dry  season  when  high  tides  at  Manila  Bay  cause\nthe normal river flow to reverse direction, and polluted water drains back into Laguna Lake. The\nSDP  area  includes  the  administrative  districts  of  11  Metro  Manila  local  government  units\n(LGUs), including 8 cities7 and 3 municipalities.8\n\n3.\n\nWater Quality Standards\n\n19.\nThe  Pasig,  San  Juan,  and  Marikina  rivers  are  designated  as  Class  C  water  by  DENR.\nDENR Administrative Order (AO) 34 defines Class C waters as suitable for the propagation and\ngrowth  of  fish  and  other  aquatic  resources;  recreational  use  for  secondary  contact  sports  like\nboating;  and  after  treatment,  for  industrial  water  supply  for  manufacturing  processes.  The\nprincipal water quality criteria for Class C water are dissolved oxygen (DO), 5 milligrams per liter\n(mg/l),  minimum;  biochemical  oxygen  demand  (BOD),  10  mg/l,  maximum;  and  total  coliforms,\n5,000  most  probable  number  per  100  milliliters  (MPN/100  ml),  maximum.  Currently,  the  Pasig\nRiver  does  not  meet  these  water  quality  standards.  Over  the  years,  the  river  system  has\nbecome polluted and environmentally degraded through the indiscriminate and direct discharge\nof untreated wastewater from industrial and municipal sources and the dumping of solid wastes.\nThe  worst  environmental  conditions  occur  during  the  dry  season,  when  the  river  flow  is  at  its\nlowest  and  consists  mainly  of  wastewater  discharges.  At  these  times,  the  river  takes  on  the\nappearance  and  smell  of  raw  sewage.  Water  quality  monitoring  shows  that  during  low  flow,\nBOD reaches 120 mg/l, 12 times higher than the permitted level for Class C water; DO drops to\nzero; and total coliforms exceed the MPN/100 ml standard by up to several thousand degrees.\n\n                                                          \n7 The cities are Caloocan, Makati, Mandaluyong, Manila, Marikina, Pasay, Pasig, and Quezon.\n8 The municipalities are Pateros, San Juan, and Taguig.\n\n\f7\n\n4.\n\nAssimilative Capacity\n\n20.\nThe river\u2019s assimilative capacity represents the amount of BOD load that it can absorb\nand  remain  within  the  Class  C  standards  set  by  AO  34  for  BOD  and  DO.  The  assimilative\ncapacity  is  affected  by  several  factors  including  the  (i)  distribution  of  BOD  loading  along  the\nriver; (ii) river flow, which varies seasonally, the lowest assimilative capacity occurs when river\nflow  is  at  its  lowest;  (iii)  water  temperature,  which  varies  seasonally  \u2014  as  the  temperature\nincreases  the  DO  level  decreases;  and  (iv)  the  reaeration  capacity  of  the  river,  which  is\ndetermined by the physical characteristics, rivers with fast and turbulent stream flow have higher\nreaeration  capacity  than  slow-flowing  rivers  such  as  the  Pasig.  DENR  has  developed  a\ncomputer  simulation  model  to  predict  river  water  quality.  Through  this  model,  the  assimilative\ncapacity  of  the  Pasig  River  for  BOD  is  estimated  at  200  tons  per  day  (t/d).  If  the  total  daily\ndischarge  of  BOD  to  the  river  is  kept  below  this  level,  it  is  predicted  that  the  Class  C  water\nquality parameters for BOD and DO will be met. However, the river water quality is well below\nClass  C  standard,  and  there  is  some  concern  that  the  true  assimilative  capacity  of  the  Pasig\nRiver may be considerably lower than 200 t/d of BOD.\n\n5.\n\nPollution Loading and Targets\n\n21.\nThe  current  BOD  loading  entering  the  Pasig  River  is  estimated  at  242  t/d,  which  is  21\npercent  above  the  river\u2019s  estimated  maximum  assimilative  capacity.  The  principal  sources  of\nthis pollution load are domestic wastewater, contributing 168 t/d of BOD; industrial wastewater,\ncontributing 69 t/d of BOD; and solid waste, contributing 5 t/d of BOD. Without any sewerage or\nsanitation interventions, the pollution load entering the river is expected to increase to 269 t/d in\n2005,  308  t/d  in  2010,  and  359  t/d  in  2015.  All  of  this  increase  is  expected  to  come  from\ndomestic  sewage  because  the  total  BOD  load  due  to  industrial  wastewater  is  forecast  to\ndecrease  from  69  t/d  in  2000  to  51  t/d  in  2015,  and  BOD  load  due  to  solid  waste  will  be\neliminated by 2005. The planned activities for providing sewerage and sanitation services under\nthe Metropolitan Manila Waterworks and Sewerage Systems (MWSS) concession agreements\nwill enable the environmental condition of the Pasig River to remain unchanged compared with\nthe present situation. In other words, the pollution control interventions planned by MWSS will\nnot be sufficient to restore Class C water quality to the Pasig River, but will only cancel out the\nexpected increase in pollution from population growth and greater water consumption within the\nriver basin catchment area.\n\n6.\n\nUrban Conditions in the Pasig River Basin\n\n22.\nThe  urban  areas  adjacent  to  the  Pasig  River  have  a  number  of  distinct  environmental\ncharacteristics. Near the lower reaches of the river around Intramuros, San Nicholas, Binondo,\nQuiapo, and San Miguel lies the historic core and traditional business and commercial center of\nMetro  Manila.  Problems  in  this  area  include  dilapidated  buildings,  severe  traffic  congestion,\ninadequate  infrastructure,  riverbank  squatters,  and  polluted  esteros.  Further  to  the  east,\nbetween  Malaca\u00f1ang  Palace  and  Sta.  Ana  race  course,  the  dominant  land  use  is  industrial;\nmuch of the industry is obsolete. Depressed, low-income housing and squatter settlements are\ninterspersed among the industries. The upstream section of the river to the Napindan Channel,\nnear Laguna Lake, including the San Juan and Marikina rivers, is characterized by mixed land\ndevelopment,  covering  industrial,  commercial,  and  residential  uses.  Environmental  problems\nalong  this  stretch  of  river  arise  mainly  from  large  industrial  operations  and  squatter  housing\nareas.  The  riverbanks  contain  substantial  areas  of  housing  for  the  urban  poor  in  the  form  of\nestablished  housing  where  land  title  has  been  determined,  and  informal  housing  occupied  by\nsquatters  located  in  and  over  water  courses  and  along  riverbank  easement  areas.  Common\n\n\f8\n\nproblems include  unacceptable living conditions, dilapidated structures, exposure to flood risk,\nfire hazards, and inadequate sanitation and public health facilities. The structure of the industrial\neconomy in the area appears to be changing, and many factories are closing down or relocating\nto  sites  outside  Metro  Manila.  This  has  resulted  in  a  proliferation  of  derelict  and  underutilized\nindustrial  sites  such  as  the  former  Marcelo  Steel  Works  and  the  Benguet  Foundry  in  the  Sta.\nAna area. The changing nature of the industry sector is resulting in the blighting of urban land\nthat could be redeveloped for more intensive, higher economic order land uses.\n\n7.\n\nInstitutional Framework\n\na.\n\nThe Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission\n\nThe institutional arrangements for the Pasig River rehabilitation are potentially complex\n23.\nbecause many central and local government agencies have responsibilities for different aspects\nof  environmental  management;  urban  renewal;  and  the  development,  management,  and\nmaintenance of the Pasig River system. To resolve this, the Government has created the Pasig\nRiver Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC) to be the executing agency responsible for all aspects\nof  river  rehabilitation,  including  coordination  with  the  various  implementing  agencies.  The\nGovernment created the PRRC in January 1999 through Executive Order (EO) 54, as amended\nby EO 65. The PRRC was created to ensure that the waterway is rehabilitated to its historically\npristine condition conducive to transport, recreation, and tourism.\n\n24.\nThe  PRRC  is  headed  by  the  secretary,  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  as\nchairperson. The cochair is the chairperson, Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), and\nthe  secretaries  or  heads  of  the  following  Departments  and  agencies  are  members:  DENR;\nDepartment  of  Finance;  Department  of  the  Interior  and  Local  Government;  Department  of\nNational  Defense;  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways;  Department  of  Tourism;\nDepartment of Trade and Industry; Department of Transport and Communications; Housing and\nUrban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC); Office of the Executive Secretary, Office of\nthe President; and three representatives of the private sector, appointed by the President.\n\n25.\nTo  achieve  its  mandate  of  rehabilitating  the  Pasig  River,  the  PRRC  has  powers  and\nfunctions to (i) prepare an updated and integrated master plan for the rehabilitation of the Pasig\nRiver, taking into account its potential for transport, recreation, and tourism; (ii) ensure that the\neasements provided for in the Civil Code and other related laws are observed, including all the\nesteros and waterways that drain into the Pasig River; (iii) integrate and coordinate all programs\nrelated  to  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Pasig  River  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  the  PRDP  (PD  No.\n274,  Proclamation  No.  704,  Series  of  1995)  and  the  Pasig  River  Environmental  Management\nand Rehabilitation Sector Development Program;9 (iv) abate the dumping of untreated industrial\nwastewater  and  sewage  into  the  river,  including  all  acts  and  omissions  in  violation  of  the\nPollution  Control  Law  and  other  related  laws;  (v)  relocate  settlers,  squatters,  and  other\nunauthorized  or  unlawful  occupants  along  the  riverbanks;  (vi)  undertake  civil  works  such  as\ndredging, clearing of structures, and cleaning the river and all esteros and waterways that drain\ninto  it;  (vii)  submit  regular  reports  to  the  Office  of  the  President  on  the  status  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s efforts in rehabilitating and developing the Pasig River; and (viii) coordinate with\nall Government agencies and offices, including the LGUs, regarding the necessary measures to\nimplement EO 54.\n\n                                                          \n9 ADB\u2019s proposed SDP loan is specifically mentioned in EO 54.\n\n\f9\n\nthe  Presidential  Task  Force  on \n\nThe  initial  requirements  of  the  PRRC  was  financed  from  contingency  funds.  Also,  the\n26.\nPasig  River  Development  Council, \nthe  Pasig  River\nRehabilitation, and the River Rehabilitation Secretariat were abolished by EO 54. The functions,\nequipment,  and  logistics  of  the  abolished  units  were  transferred  to  the  PRRC,  and  all  funds\nreceived by the abolished agencies that were contributed for the Pasig River rehabilitation were\ntransferred  to  the  PRRC.  The  PRRC\u2019s  implementing  rules  and  regulations  are  in  place,  and  it\nhas set up five working committees to be responsible for various aspects of river rehabilitation.\nThey  include  (i)  environmental  management  committee  under  the  leadership  of  DENR;  (ii)\nhousing and resettlement committee under the leadership of HUDCC; (iii) riverbanks, transport,\nand tourism development committee under the leadership of MMDA; (iv) flood control committee\nunder  the  leadership  of  DPWH;  and  (v)  information  and  advocacy  committee,  also  under  the\nleadership of MMDA.\n\n27.\nThe  PRRC  has  also  created  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  to  provide  technical,\nadministrative,  and  logistical  support,  and  serve  as  the  link  between  the  PRRC  and  the\ncommittees.  The  PMO  is  headed  by  an  executive  director  assisted  by  deputy  executive\ndirectors for finance and operations. The functions of the executive director are to provide full-\ntime  assistance  to  PRRC\u2019s  chairperson  and  cochair  in  the  following:  (i)  administering  and\nsupervising  personnel;  (ii)  coordinating  and  overseeing  the  Pasig  River  rehabilitation  efforts\nthrough the PMO and committees; (iii) reorienting, evaluating, and integrating plans, programs,\nand  projects  for  Pasig  River  rehabilitation  for  submission  to,  and  approval  of,  the  PRRC;  (iv)\nmonitoring the activities of the committees; (v) establishing linkages between the PRRC and the\nvarious committees; (vi) recommending policy guidelines and directions to the PRRC for Pasig\nRiver system rehabilitation; and (vii) preparing reports and performing other functions and duties\ndetermined  by  the  PRRC.  As  the  PRRC  is  newly  created,  it  has  not  yet  established  a  track\nrecord,  but  the  early  signs  are  that  it  is  highly  committed  and  professional  with  strong\nleadership, a strong mandate, and adequate resources to discharge its duties and obligations.\nThere is a high degree of confidence in its ability to effectively execute the SDP and coordinate\nthe implementation activities of other agencies. The PRRC\u2019s organizational structure is given in\nAppendix 3.\n\n28.\nThe  PRRC  shall  maintain  the  following  linkages  with  other  agencies:  (i)  National\nEconomic and Development Authority, on planning through the submission of the master plan,\ndevelopment  plans,  and  investment  programs  for  integration  into  the  Philippine  Medium-Term\nDevelopment  Plan  and  Public  Investment  Program,  and  clearance  by  the  Investment\nCoordinating Committee; (ii) HUDCC, MMDA, National Housing Authority (NHA), and the LGUs\non  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  Pasig  River  land  use  plan  and  riverbanks\ndevelopment, with particular reference to the establishment of EPAs, including the relocation of\nsquatters  and  development  of  the  vacated  areas  for  beneficial  environmental  use  and  the\nupgrading  of  adjacent  urban  renewal  areas;  and  (iii)  DENR,  Laguna  Lake  Development\nAuthority (LLDA), and the LGUs on the coordination and implementation of plans to monitor and\nenforce environmental standards and pollution control measures.\n\nb.\n\nOther Agencies\n\nEffective water quality management is compounded by the number of central and local\n29.\ngovernment  agencies \nin  various  aspects  of  environmental  monitoring  and\nmanagement.  DENR  has  nationwide  responsibility  for  issuing  environmental  compliance\ncertificates for projects, monitoring effluent discharges, enforcing compliance with environmental\nregulations  and  standards,  and  ensuring,  through  its  Environmental  Management  Bureau  and\nNational Capital Region office, that environmental monitoring and enforcement are undertaken\n\ninvolved \n\n\f10\n\nwithin Metro Manila. The LLDA has responsibility for environmental monitoring and enforcement\nwithin the Laguna Lake drainage basin, which includes Metro Manila. LLDA differs from DENR\nin that it has the authority to impose, collect, and retain pollution discharge fees and fines from\npolluters  not  in  compliance  with  regulations.  MMDA  is  responsible  for  development  and\nimplementation of policies for physical framework planning, zoning, land use planning, and solid\nwaste  disposal,  and  has  been  involved  in  removing  solid  waste  from  the  Pasig  River.  MMDA\nalso oversees metropolitan-wide policies, such as establishment and maintenance of riverbank\neasements for EPAs, which are approved by the Metro Manila Mayors\u2019 Council and managed\nby  the  LGUs.  MWSS  is  responsible  for  providing  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  sewerage\nservices  throughout  its  service  area,  including  all  the  LGUs  within  Metro  Manila.  MWSS  has\nprivatized  its  operation  and  has  entered  into  concession  agreements  with  two  private  sector\noperators  for  the  operation,  management,  maintenance,  and  further  development  of  water\nsupply  and  sewerage  services  for  Metro  Manila.  HUDCC  is  responsible  for  the  planning,\ncoordination,  and  management  of  housing  for  the  urban  poor  and  for  providing  resettlement\nsites  for  the  squatter  families  that  have  to  be  relocated  from  the  riverbanks  and  esteros.  The\nimplementation of resettlement schemes is done by NHA, an agency of HUDCC, in consultation\nand  cooperation  with  the  affected  LGUs.  DPWH  is  responsible  for  engineering  works  on  the\nriver  channel,  such  as  the  construction  and  repair  of  revetments,  river  walls,  and  channel\ndredging.\n\nThe  LGUs  play  an  important,  though  largely  untapped,  role  in  rehabilitating  the  Pasig\n30.\nRiver  system.  In  general,  local  governments  are  responsible  for  the  community  preparation  of\nsquatter  families  to  be  relocated,  physical  improvements  in  the  areas  vacated  by  squatters,\nurban  upgrading  and  renewal  of  areas  adjacent  to  the  river,  and  organizing  community-based\nsolid waste collection programs. Inclusion and involvement of the concerned LGUs in the Pasig\nRiver  rehabilitation  program  is  critical  to  its  success,  and  supports  the  ongoing  process  of\ndecentralization  in  the  shelter  and  urban  development  sectors.  The  city  of  Manila  has\nsucceeded  in  relocating  squatters  and  establishing  successful  riverside  parks  with  community\nfacilities. Other LGUs, such as the cities of Makati and Mandaluyong, are currently involved in\nin-city  relocation  of  squatter  residents  to  local  social  housing  projects.  Marikina  City  has\nimplemented a highly successful relocation of about 5,000 squatter families from the banks of\nthe Marikina River to an in-city resettlement site and has redeveloped the vacated area into a\nriverside park.\n\nC.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\nMonitoring  and  enforcement  of  environmental  regulations  and  effluent  discharge\n31.\nstandards  have  been  inadequate  and  hampered  by  a  lack  of  institutional  capacity  and\ninsufficient information about pollution sources. Effective water quality management involves (i)\nformulating  and  implementing  environmental  management  policies,  plans,  and  programs;  (ii)\nissuing consistent environmental regulations and effluent standards for wastewater discharges\nthat  are  monitorable  and  enforceable;  (iii)  setting  pollution  absorption  limits  for  river  segments\nand  monitoring  the  ambient  water  quality  of  the  river  system;  (iv)  identifying,  measuring,  and\nmonitoring point and nonpoint sources of pollution entering the river system; and (v) enforcing\nenvironmental regulations and effluent discharge standards on a regular and consistent basis.\n\n32.\nThe  existing  deficiencies  in  the  institutional  capacity  for  environmental  management  of\nthe  Pasig  River  system  indicates  inadequate  investment  and  budgetary  support  by  the\nGovernment.  For  example,  the  1999  budget  for  the  Environmental  Management  Bureau  was\nonly  P68  million  for  the  whole  country.  Of  this,  only  a  very  small  amount  was  allocated  for\nenvironmental management activities in the Pasig River basin. The Government is determined\n\n\f11\n\nto succeed in rehabilitating the Pasig River system and maintaining the improved water quality\nstandards, and is committing substantial levels of investment and resources to be appropriately\nallocated through annual budgets to the concerned agencies. The costs of effective wastewater\nmanagement and pollution control arise from the monitoring and enforcement costs incurred by\nthe  responsible  Government  environmental  management  agencies,  and  the  costs  incurred  by\nenterprises to abate pollution and meet regulations and standards.\n\n33.\nMost  residential  and  commercial  properties  in  Metro  Manila  use  individual  septic  tanks\nfor domestic sewage disposal, and only 10 percent of properties are connected to sewers. It is\nestimated that the Pasig River catchment basin currently contains about 1 million septic tanks,\nand  this  number  is  forecast  to  reach  about  1.25  million  by  2015.  To  maintain  operational\nefficiency, septic tanks need to be desludged at intervals of two to seven years depending on\ntank  design  and  usage.  Septic  tanks  that  are  full  of  sludge  provide  no  detention  time  for\nsewage, and suspended solids (SS) are unable to settle. Consequently, the discharged effluent\nretains high levels of SS, BOD, and fecal bacteria. In practice, septic tanks in Metro Manila are\nrarely  desludged,  and  it  is  estimated  that  only  about  15  percent  of  tanks  are  properly\nmaintained. To tackle this problem effectively, it is necessary to empty septic tanks on a regular\nbasis  and  treat  the  collected  septage.  The  maintained  septic  tanks  are  serviced  mainly  by\nprivate contractors none of whom have treatment facilities for the collected septage. It is likely\nthat most private contractors dispose of collected septage directly into water courses, the Pasig\ntreatment,  causing  considerable  pollution,  nuisance,  and\nRiver,  or \nenvironmental  damage.  The  private  contractors  should  be  regulated  and  monitored  to  ensure\nproper  septage  treatment  and  disposal.  The  private  contractors  will  be  allowed  to  use  the\nseptage treatment facility proposed under the SDP, but will be required to pay the appropriate\ndischarge and treatment fee based on the volume of septage delivered to the plant.\n\nthe  sea  without \n\n34.\nThe MWSS concession agreement with private sector operators sets time-bound service\ncoverage  targets  for  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  sewerage.  In  this  context,  sanitation  means\nseptic tank maintenance. The water supply targets are set to reach about 95 percent by 2006,\nand be sustained at that level throughout the concession period until 2021. The sewerage and\nsanitation  targets  are  much  lower  and  are  to  be  achieved  much  later.  Some  areas  will  not\nreceive  sanitation  coverage  throughout  the  concession  period;  most  will  not  begin  to  receive\nsewerage coverage until after 2006. The high level of water supply coverage, increasing urban\npopulation,  and  rising  per  capita  water  consumption  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  volume  of\nuntreated  municipal  sewage  being  discharged  to  the  public  system,  and  ultimately,  the  Pasig\nRiver,  unless  effective  sanitation  coverage  is  introduced  over  a  wider  area  at  an  earlier  date\nthan envisaged in the concession agreements. Under the terms of the concession agreement,\nthe  concessionaires  are  not  obliged  to  advance  or  increase  the  sanitation  coverage  targets.\nAlso,  the  Office  of  the  Government  Corporate  Counsel  (OGCC),  Department  of  Justice,  has\nissued a legal opinion10 stating that the provision of sanitation services is not an exclusive right\ngranted  to  the  MWSS  concessionaires  under  the  Concession  Agreement.  The  MWSS\nconcession operators\u2019 time-bound service coverage targets for water, sewerage, and sanitation\nare given in Appendix 4.\n\nIt  is  further  estimated  that  there  are  up  to  10,000  industrial  and  commercial\n35.\nestablishments  in  the  Pasig  River  basin,  of  which  about  2,000,  including  400  along  the  Pasig\nRiver  banks,  are  discharging  untreated  wastewater  into  the  Pasig  River  system.  To  reduce\n\n                                                          \n10 Opinion  No.  206,  Series  of  1999,  Opinion on whether the provision of sanitation services is an exclusive right\n\ngranted to the MWSS concessionaires, under the Concession Agreement, 20 October 1999.\n\n\f12\n\npollution  due  to  industrial  wastewater,  it  is  necessary  to  bring  these  establishments  into\ncompliance with environmental regulations and discharge standards.\n\n36.\nTo  establish  EPAs  along  the  riverbanks,  it  is  necessary  to  relocate  squatter  families\nliving within the easement areas and develop EPAs for parks and other beneficial environmental\nuses.  To  promote  urban  renewal,  it  is  necessary  to  initiate  slum  upgrading  in  poorly  serviced\nareas adjacent to EPAs.\n\nD.\n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n37.\nEnvironmental  degradation  and  its  impact  on  the  population  and  economic  growth\ncontinue to be a major challenge for the Government. All major environmental concerns such as\nwater  and  air  pollution,  degraded  forests  and  watersheds,  and  deterioration  of  marine  and\ncoastal resources are exacerbated by increased population pressure and intensified economic\nactivities. To address these environmental concerns and to meet its international commitment to\nsustainable development, the Government adopted Philippine Agenda 21 in September 1996 as\nits  national  action  plan  to  integrate  environmental  considerations  into  social  and  economic\ndevelopment decision making.\n\nfar-ranging  policy  reforms  and  enforcement  measures \n\n38.\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  to  address  its  environmental  problems,  the  country\nneeds not only increased financial investment for environmental rehabilitation and improvement,\nbut  also \nfor  a  more  effective\nenvironmental  management  system.  The  major  issues  to  be  addressed  in  environmental\nmanagement  include  (i)  rationalizing  the  environmental  regulations  and  standards,  (ii)\nstrengthening the institutional structure for environmental management at the national and local\nlevels,  (iii)  developing  institutional  capacity  and  capability  for  environmental  monitoring  and\nenforcement,  (iv)  introducing  market-based  instruments  for  pollution  control,  (v)  introducing\ndemand-management  techniques  for  power  and  water  supply,  (vi)  undertaking  environmental\nawareness and education programs, and (vii) introducing the polluter pays principle on a wider\nscale.\n\n39.\nThe 1998 National Development Plan provides guidance on economic and social policy\nreforms  within  the  overall  objectives  for  economic,  social,  and  cultural  transformation  of  the\ncountry  envisaged  in  the  Philippine  2000  concept.  The  key  objectives  of  the  Government\u2019s\ndevelopment  strategy  are  to  reduce  poverty,  improve  health  and  education,  and  protect  the\nenvironment.  The  strategy  recognizes  the  need  for  sustained  high  economic  growth  as  a\nnecessary condition for poverty reduction and stresses the need for better access by the poor to\n(i)  publicly  provided  services  and  facilities  such  as  health  care,  education,  and  sanitation;  (ii)\ninfrastructure facilities such as water, electricity, and roads; and (iii) economic assets like land.\n\nThe Government initiated the rehabilitation of Pasig River in 1989, with a grant from the\n40.\nDanish International Development Assistance (Danida). Danida provided assistance to develop\nthe capability and capacity of DENR, initiate water quality monitoring for the Pasig River, build a\ndatabase  of  polluting  industries,  develop  and  calibrate  a  mathematical  model  for  water  quality\nmanagement, and prepare the Pasig River Rehabilitation Program, with the primary objective of\nrehabilitating  the  Pasig  River  system  to  Class  C  water  quality.  Danida  also  provided  some\nlimited assistance with squatter relocation for people living on stilted housing over the water, but\nnot on a large-scale basis. DENR set up the River Rehabilitation Secretariat to coordinate and\nmonitor implementation of the program, promote public awareness, and upgrade water quality in\nthe  river.  However,  due  to  the  Government\u2019s  resource  and  capacity  constraints,  only  modest\n\n\f13\n\nprogress  has  been  made  in  achieving  the  Rehabilitation  Program  objectives.  Danida  is\ncontinuing to support the Secretariat\u2019s activities, which have been transferred to the PRRC.\n\nE.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n41.\nOfficial external assistance to the Philippines is provided by ADB, the World Bank, and\nother  multilateral  funding  sources,  including  the  United  Nations  system,  the  European\nCommission,  and  bilateral  agencies  from  Australia,  Canada,  Denmark,  Germany,  Japan,  and\nthe United States. Japan accounts for 53 percent of total commitments, and the World Bank and\nADB for 23 and 22 percent, respectively.\n\nDPWH,  with  assistance  from  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),11  is\n42.\npreparing  the  Pasig-Marikina  River  Channel  Improvement  Project,  aimed  at  repairing,\nrehabilitating,  and  improving  the  revetments,  parapet  walls,  and  drainage  works;  and\nundertaking  selective  channel  dredging  from  the  mouth  of  the  Pasig  River  at  Manila  Bay,\nupstream  to  Marikina  Bridge  on  the  Marikina  River.  The  JBIC-funded  project  is  aimed  at\nimproving  the  flood  control  and  drainage  characteristics  of  the  Pasig  River,  and  is\ncomplementary to the proposed SDP, which is aimed at improving water quality and promoting\nurban renewal.\n\nJBIC  is  processing  the  Environmental  Infrastructure  Credit  Support  Program,  Phase  II.\n43.\nThe  program  is  a  \u00a520.5  billion  loan  facility,  channeled  through  the  Development  Bank  of  the\nPhilippines to  support  investments  that reduce industrial pollution, thereby improving industrial\nefficiency  and  environmental  quality.  The  target  sectors  are  industry,  mining,  and  services.\nEligible  projects  include  pollution  control,  efficient  use  of  natural  resources,  improvement  of\noccupational  health  and  safety,  enhancement  of  environmental  management  systems,  and\nenvironmental infrastructure under build-operate-transfer arrangements.\n\nThe  Manila  Second  Sewerage  Project,  funded  through  a  $57  million  World  Bank  loan,\n44.\nhas prepared a feasibility study and program for septage collection and disposal. The first phase\nof the program was approved in 1998. The facilities to be provided include (i) improvements to\nthe central sewerage system, (ii) construction of septage loading stations on the Pasig River to\ntransport  untreated  septage  by  barge  for  ocean  dumping,  (iii)  improvements  to  the  Ayala\nsewage  treatment  plant,  and  (iv)  expansion  of  the  Dagat-Dagatan  sewage  treatment  plant.\nThese sewerage and septage management facilities are included in the overall sewerage and\nsanitation  targets  of  the  MWSS  concession  operators.  The  septage  management  facilities\nproposed  under  the  SDP  are  complementary  and  will  increase  the  sanitation  coverage,\nparticularly  for  the  urban  poor  living  in  riverside  communities.  The  Japan  International\nCooperation  Agency  financed  the  preparation  of  a  sewerage  master  plan  for  MWSS  in  1996.\nThe master plan contains recommendations for the MWSS service area up to 2015.\n\nF.\n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n45.\nEnvironmental degradation in the country has been an ADB concern for many years. In\nthe  past,  the  Bank\u2019s  lending  was  mainly  focused  on  restoration  and  rehabilitation  of  the\ncountry\u2019s forests and fisheries resources. In the area of urban environment, ADB made its first\nloan for Manila environmental improvement in 1980.12 Since then, however, no new loans were\n\n                                                          \n11 This support was initially from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, which on 1 October 1999, was merged\n\nwith the Export-Import Bank of Japan to form JBIC.\n\n12 Loan 457-PHI: Manila Sewerage Project, for $42.8 million, approved on 24 June 1980.\n\n\f14\n\nmade specifically for urban environmental improvement until the recent Metro Manila Air Quality\nImprovement Sector Development Program. This lengthy lending gap was partly attributable to\nthe  economic  and  political  situation  in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s  that  did  not  allow  the\nGovernment to give high priority to the problems of urban pollution and environmental concerns.\nADB has also approved 20 TAs for environmental improvement in the country.\n\n46.\nUnder  ADB\u2019s  country  assistance  plan,  1999-2001,  the  policy  support  program  for  the\nPhilippines  will  focus  on  (i)  involving  the  private  sector  in  infrastructure  provision;13  (ii)\ndeveloping  domestic  capital  markets;  (iii)  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization\nprogram;  (iv)  capacity  building  for  key  national  agencies  and  LGUs;  (v)  sustainable  natural\nresource  management,  conservation,  and  regulation  of  air  and  water  pollution;  (vi)  assistance\nfor the social sectors, including health, education, sanitation, and water supply; and (vii) poverty\nreduction and the promotion of socioeconomic equity.\n\n47.\nFor  the  environment  sector,  ADB  will  take  a  more  systematic  approach  to  help  the\nGovernment  address  the  environmental  concerns  arising  from  the  sustainable  development\npolicies stipulated in Philippine Agenda 21. In particular, emphasis will be placed on supporting\nthe  reform  initiatives  needed  to  establish  a  more  effective  legal  and  institutional  system  for\nenvironmental  management.  In  its  lending  operations,  ADB  will  support  resource  mobilization\nand  help  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to  tackle  the  serious  problems  of  urban  environmental\npollution.  Initially,  lending  for  pollution  control  will  focus  on  Metro  Manila\u2019s  environmental\nproblems where improvements in environmental management and pollution control are urgently\nneeded  and  are  warranted  as  a  national  priority.  ADB  will  also  focus  on  improving  the\neffectiveness of the overall environmental management system through TA and promoting the\nparticipation of all stakeholders with environmental concerns.\n\n48.\nIn  urban  development,  ADB  will  continue  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  urban  sector\npolicy  reforms.  This  will  include  support  for  the  decentralization  policy  through  institutional\nstrengthening  and  capacity  building  for  LGUs.  Further  privatization  of  water  supply  operations\nwill be encouraged, with concomitant reform of sector policies and strengthening of regulations,\nas  well  as  public-private  partnerships  for  the  delivery  and  management  of  essential  urban\ninfrastructure  facilities  and  municipal  services.  ADB-assisted  projects  will  also  encourage  fair\nlabor practices, and attention will be given to urban environmental management. Environmental\naspects will be incorporated into integrated urban environmental management and components\nthat  interact  with  each  other,  such  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  and  solid  waste\nmanagement,  and  will  be  considered  in  a  comprehensive  and  holistic  way.  Poverty  reduction\nand  community  participation  in  project  design  and  implementation  will  be  a  prime  focus  of\nattention  in  project  formulation.  ADB  will  provide  capacity-building  assistance  for  LGUs  and\nservice  delivery  agencies  through  lending  and  TA  programs.  ADB  also  seeks  cofinancing  to\nprovide institutional development support for its integrated urban development projects.\n\nG.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n49.\nThe SDP will be ADB\u2019s first experience with wastewater environmental management and\nriver  rehabilitation  in  urban  areas  in  the  Philippines.  However,  from  ADB\u2019s  recent  experience\nwith a similar project14 in Shanghai, People\u2019s Republic of China, it is well recognized that to be\neffective,  environmental  management  must  be  supported  at  the  highest  levels  of  government\nand  operate  within  the  framework  of  a  strong  policy  agenda.  The  policy  agenda  should  be\n\n                                                          \n13 Loan 7154/1696-PHI: Maynilad Water Services, Inc., for $171 million, approved on 14 September 1999.\n14 Loan 1692-PRC: Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation Project, for $300 million, approved on 29 June 1999.\n\n\f15\n\nfounded  on  the  basic  principle  that  the  producers  of  pollution  should  pay  proportionately  for\nprotecting the environment, and be required to provide effective waste treatment and disposal\nmeasures.  Well-developed  institutions  with  adequate  capability,  capacity,  and  resources  are\nalso  essential  to  monitor  wastewater  discharges  and  enforce  environmental  regulations  and\ntransparent,\nstandards.  Environmental  regulations  and  standards \nmonitorable, and enforceable are also necessary if the policy agenda is to be effective, and the\nenvironmental  management  agencies  are  able  to  operate.  It  is  important  also  to  raise  public\nawareness of environmental issues, particularly for the benefits that accrue to civil society, as a\nresult of creating and maintaining a clean, green, and healthy urban environment.\n\nthat  are  appropriate, \n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n50.\nAs  the  Philippine  economy  recovers  from  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  the  Government  is\nindicating its strong commitment to economic development and growth that incorporates sound\nenvironmental  management  practices.  Public  sector  policymakers  are  required  to  give\nenvironmental  concerns  a  high  priority  in  the  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of\ndevelopment projects. Consequently, it is incumbent upon the private sector to also follow the\nprinciples of sustainable development, and ensure that economic development is not achieved\nat the cost of resource depletion and environmental degradation as frequently happened in the\npast.\n\n51.\nTo address the environmental problems facing Metro Manila, particularly for wastewater\nmanagement,  urban  renewal,  and  sustainable  rehabilitation  of  Pasig  River  water  quality,  it  is\nnecessary  to  implement  an  integrated  set  of  policy  reforms  covering  institutional,  regulatory,\ntechnical, and financial aspects of environmental management, and initiate a series of specific\ninterventions  aimed  at  relocating  squatters,  establishing  EPAs,  promoting  urban  renewal,\nintroducing regular septic tank maintenance, providing septage treatment and disposal capacity,\nand supporting institutional capacity building.\n\n52.\nThe  policy  reforms  are  far-reaching,  and  require  strong  Government  commitment  to\nachieve and sustain them. The physical interventions are needed to support the policy agenda\nand  make  a  significant  contribution  to  environmental  management  and  river  rehabilitation.  For\nthese reasons, the SDP modality is appropriate. The proposed SDP includes a program loan to\nsupport  policy  reforms  and  an  investment  loan  to  support  sector  investment  in  public\ninfrastructure and capacity building.\n\n53.\nThe  costs  to  be  borne  by  the  Government  for  Pasig  River  environmental  management\nand rehabilitation are estimated at $750 million equivalent from 2000 to 2004. These costs will\narise  from  (i)  implementation  of  the  first  phase  of  PRDP,  estimated  at  $300  million,  covering\nurban  renewal  ($55  million),  establishment  of  EPAs,  including  relocation  of  about  10,000\nsquatter families ($65 million), sewerage and sewage treatment ($100 million), sanitation ($30\nmillion),  industrial  waste  management  ($30  million),  and  solid  waste  disposal  ($20  million),\nwhich will be supported, in part, by the SDP with respect to sanitation, establishment of EPAs,\nand  urban  renewal;  (ii)  the  provision  of  housing,  resettlement,  and  livelihood  development  for\nabout  50,000  additional  squatter  families  living  along  riverbanks,  creeks,  and  esteros  in  other\nparts  of  the  Pasig  River  drainage  basin  ($350  million);  and  (iii)  flood  control  and  drainage\nprojects, including revetments, river walls, and channel dredging along the Pasig, Marikina, and\nSan Juan rivers ($100 million). Also, the DENR and LLDA will incur substantial costs to develop,\n\n\f16\n\nimplement,  and  administer  a  better  environmental  monitoring,  management,  and  enforcement\nprogram for Metro Manila, based on enhanced environmental regulations and standards.\n\n54.\nIn addition, substantial costs will be incurred by industrial and commercial enterprises to\nabate  wastewater  pollution  and  come  into  compliance  with  environmental  regulations  and\ndischarge  standards.  Although  a  complete  demand  analysis  has  not  been  completed,  it  is\nestimated  that  the  total  cost  of  installing  adequate  on-site  wastewater  treatment  facilities  for\nindustrial  and  commercial  enterprises  discharging  waste  into  the  Pasig  River  basin  is  about\nP10.0  billion,  equivalent  to  $250  million.  Enterprises  may  be  able  to  internalize  these  costs\nthrough  productivity  gains  and  operational  benefits,  and  achieve  the  desired  environmental\nstandards  by  introducing  clean  production  technology,  waste  minimization  and  resource\nrecovery  methods,  and  on-site  industrial  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  The  environmental\nmanagement authorities should also encourage enterprises to adopt more environment-friendly\nbehavior and practices by providing incentives to enterprises that achieve wastewater pollution\ncontrol  benefits  from  process  changes  and  the  introduction  of  technology  that  reduces  or\neliminates  industrial  wastewater  pollution  in  addition  to  end-of-pipe  wastewater  treatment\nsystems.\n\n55.\nThe  rationale  for  the  SDP  is  to  strengthen  the  environmental  management  policies  for\nurban  areas;  develop  the  wastewater  management  and  pollution  control,  monitoring,  and\nenforcement  capacities  of  the  concerned  national  and  local  government  agencies;  and\nrehabilitate  the  Pasig  River,  its  tributaries,  and  esteros  to  achieve  a  clean  and  green\nenvironment  for  the  river  basin.  The  aim  is  to  restore  water  quality  and  create  an  urban\nenvironment for Metro Manila that makes it a clean, pleasant, and attractive place to live, work,\nand  conduct  business.  The  water  quality  improvements  will  be  sustained  by  ensuring  that\ncredible  monitoring  and  enforcement  mechanisms  are  put  in  place.  This  will  be  achieved\nthrough the adoption of a long-term policy reform agenda and implementation of the first phase\nof the PRDP for river system rehabilitation.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n56.\nThe  sector  objectives  are  to  improve  environmental  management  of  the  Pasig  River\nbasin  within  Metro  Manila,  particularly  for  wastewater  management  and  to  promote  urban\nrenewal. The specific purpose is to restore and sustain Class C water quality standard for the\nPasig River, establish EPAs along the riverbanks, and upgrade adjacent urban renewal areas.\n\nThe policy reform agenda will cover (i) adopting and implementing Phase 1 of the PRDP,\n57.\n(ii)  providing  sanitation  services  in  addition  to  the  MWSS  concession  agreement  targets,  (iii)\nestablishing  a  wastewater  discharge  permit  system  for  Metro  Manila,  (iv)  improving  domestic\nsolid waste management for riverside communities, (v) establishing EPAs along the riverbanks,\n(vi) strengthening environmental regulations and discharge standards, (vii) strengthening water\nquality  monitoring,  (viii)  enhancing  public  awareness,  and  (ix)  strengthening  institutional\ncapability and capacity.\n\nThe first five-year phase, 2000-2004, of the PRDP will be implemented to initiate water\n58.\nquality  improvements,  commence  urban  renewal  along  the  riverbanks,  and  improve  living\nconditions  and  public  health  standards  for  riverside  communities.  This  will  be  achieved  by  (i)\nrelocating squatters from the riverbanks and developing EPAs; (ii) upgrading infrastructure and\nmunicipal services in adjacent urban renewal areas; (iii) introducing septic tank cleaning service\nand  septage  treatment  plants  to  reduce  the  volume  and  concentration  of  untreated  municipal\nsewage being discharged into the river; (iv) improving the quality of industrial wastewater before\n\n\f17\n\nit is discharged into the river through improved environmental monitoring and enforcement, and\nthe  introduction  of  a  wastewater  discharge  permit  system  to  Metro  Manila;  (v)  eliminating  the\nillegal  dumping  of  municipal  solid  waste  into  the  river  system;  and  (vi)  providing  consulting\nservices  to  provide  project  implementation  assistance.  TA  for  institutional  strengthening,\ncapacity building, community involvement, and stakeholder participation will be provided.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\nTo  bring  about  the  stated  sector  objectives  and  achieve  sustainable  water  quality  and\n59.\nenvironmental  management  improvements  for  the  Pasig  River  basin,  the  Government  has\nrecognized  the  need  to  identify  and  implement  a  program  of  policy  reforms.  Consequently,  a\npolicy  framework  and  time-bound  action  plan  were  agreed  to;  they  create  the  institutional,\nfinancial, and regulatory conditions necessary to successfully implement the PRDP and sustain\nthe  environmental  improvements  thus  gained.  The  major  policy  priorities  and  time-bound\nactions  are  applicable  throughout  Metro  Manila,  and  are  described  in  the  policy  letter  and  set\nout in the policy matrix attached as Appendix 5.\n\n1.\n\nAdopt and Implement the PRDP\n\n60.\nApproval, adoption, and implementation of the first phase of the PRDP will provide the\nplanning  framework  for  improving  water  quality  in  the  Pasig  River,  promoting  urban  renewal,\nand  improving  living  conditions  and  public  health  standards  for  riverside  communities.  The\nPRDP  is  a  result  of  extensive  discussions  among  Government  agencies,  LGUs,  utility\ncompanies, industrialists, the private sector, and the NGOs involved in the effort to rehabilitate\nthe  Pasig  River,  and  was  developed  with  ADB  assistance  through  TA  2803  (footnote  4).  The\nPRDP  builds  on  the  plans  and  proposals  developed  over  recent  years,  and  provides  a\ncomprehensive  and  integrated  framework  for  their  implementation.  It  is  complementary  to\nexisting plans and proposals, including LGU land use plans and community-led initiatives. The\nPRDP recommends policy guidelines, strategies, an implementation schedule, and a framework\nfor sustainable development aimed at rehabilitating the Pasig River. It includes strategies for (i)\nphysical development  framework implementation, (ii) sanitation and septage management, (iii)\nindustrial  wastewater  management,  and  (iv)  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building.\nSpecific  urban  renewal  and  environmental  upgrading  components  were  identified,  and\nimplementation  will  result  in  improved  water  quality,  better  living  conditions,  and  higher  public\nhealth  standards  for  riverside  residents.  The  PRRC  and  the  Metro  Manila  Council  have\nreviewed, approved, and adopted the first phase of the PRDP.\n\n2.\n\nProvide Additional Sanitation Services\n\n61.\nThe MWSS concession agreements with private sector operators set time-bound service\ncoverage  targets  for  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  sanitation.  Compared  with  water  supply\ntargets,  the  planned  coverage  for  sewerage  and  sanitation  are  much  lower  and  are  to  be\nachieved much later. Most areas will not begin to receive sewerage coverage until after 2006.\nSome areas will not receive sanitation coverage throughout the concession period, even though\n90  percent  of  Metro  Manila  is  served  by  septic  tanks.  OGCC  has  issued  an  opinion  that  the\nprovision of sanitation services is not an exclusive right of the concessionaires under the terms\nof the MWSS Concession Agreement. In view of this, the Government\u2019s policy for sanitation is\nto  (i)  ensure  that  the  concession  operators  meet  the  time-bound  service  coverage  targets  set\nout  in  the  concession  agreements,  and  (ii)  enable  the  PRRC  to  provide  additional  sanitation\ncoverage and deliver services at an earlier date than specified in the concession agreements for\nareas  that  have  low  or  zero  sanitation  coverage.  By  2005  the  SDP  investment  Project  will\n\n\f18\n\nprovide septic tank maintenance services for about 185,000 households in areas scheduled for\nzero sanitation coverage under the MWSS Concession Agreement.\n\n3.\n\nEstablish a Wastewater Discharge Permit System for Metro Manila\n\n62. Without  adequate  monitoring  and  enforcement  of  environmental  regulations  and\nstandards,  industrial  activities  will  produce  industrial  wastewater  pollution  that  jeopardizes\neconomic  growth,  adversely  affects  human  health,  and  degrades  the  environment.  Within  the\nPasig  River  system,  industrial  wastewater  is  estimated  to  account  for  35  percent  of  the  BOD\npollution load entering the river. Existing industries continue to pollute the Pasig River due to old\nand inefficient plant facilities and equipment; a lack of understanding of the need for wastewater\nmanagement  and  pollution  reduction;  noncompliance  with  effluent  discharge  standards;  poor\ndetection;  weak  enforcement  of  environmental  regulations  and  standards;  and  apathy  among\naffected communities. Government attempts to solve the problem have been through traditional\ncommand  and  control  approaches  that  rely  on  setting  standards  and  controls,  and  monitoring\nand enforcing compliance. This approach includes a system of fines that assigns weights to a\nnumber of pollution factors, but the value of the fines have been eroded by inflation and do not\nadequately  reflect  the  environmental  damage  caused  by  polluters.  Noncompliance  with\nenvironmental  discharge  standards  results  in  a  maximum  penalty  of  P5,000  per  day  (about\n$125)  regardless  of  facility  size,  and  the  probability  of  being  detected  and  fined  is  low.  As  a\nresult,  many  firms  choose  to  risk  being  caught  and  fined  rather  than  invest  in  wastewater\ntreatment facilities, as the penalties are much lower than the cost of installing pollution control\ndevices. The consequence of poor environmental monitoring and enforcement is the continued\nviolation  of  pollution  discharge  regulations  and  a  degraded  environment.  The  policy  is  to\nestablish,  for  Metro  Manila,  a  wastewater  discharge  permit  system  with  a  progressive  tariff\nstructure  based  on  the  volume  of  wastewater  discharged  and  the  concentration  of  pollution\nloading for enterprises discharging effluents to the public system. Initially, the permits will not be\ntradable  because  the  discharge  permit  system  is  a  relatively  new  concept  for  the  Philippines,\nand  the  institutional  capacity  to  effectively  operate  and  manage  a  tradable  wastewater  permit\nsystem needs further development and strengthening. The wastewater discharge permit system\nwill be similar to that successfully introduced by LLDA in the area around Laguna Lake outside\nMetro Manila. The DENR will issue an administrative order authorizing a system of wastewater\ndischarge permits and fees for Metro Manila.\n\n4.\n\nSolid Waste Management\n\nIllegal  dumping  of  solid  waste  in  the  Pasig  River  system  can  be  attributed  to  the\n63.\ninadequate household waste collection system, widespread lack of discipline and awareness of\nproper waste management practices among riverside communities, poor access to the interior\nof  communities  for  effective  waste  collection,  and  uncoordinated  and  irregular  scheduling  of\nsolid  waste  collection  vehicles.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  is  to  improve  domestic  solid  waste\ncollection and recycling by riverside barangays, and aim for a target of zero pollution caused by\nsolid waste in the river. To achieve this, MMDA and the LGUs will mobilize the barangays along\nthe  river  and  use  the  services  of  relevant  NGOs  that  have  had  experience  with  implementing\ncommunity-based solid waste management projects through the Sagip Pasig Movement.15\n\n                                                          \n15 Sagip Pasig means Save the Pasig.\n\n\f19\n\n5.\n\nEstablish Environmental Preservation Areas\n\n64.\nEstablishing  10  m  wide  EPAs  along  the  riverbanks  is  a  policy  priority  and  is  critical  to\nimproving  access  to  the  river  for  public  use,  safety,  and  maintenance;  rehabilitating  the\nriverbank environment; and promoting urban renewal adjacent to the river. The creation of EPAs\nalong  all  major  rivers  and  esteros  in  Metro  Manila  will  require  the  relocation  of  about  60,000\nsquatter families currently living in deprived conditions along the riverbanks and over the water.\nThe  relocation  of  squatter  families  living  within  the  EPA  zones  is  the  first  step  to  improving\npublic health standards and quality of life for urban poor families currently living in inadequate,\nunserviced squatter shanties in dangerous locations along the riverbanks. The Government has\nalready embarked on a program of relocation and early relocatees included families living in stilt\nhouses  over  the  water.  Under  the  first  phase  of  the  PRDP,  approximately  10,000  squatter\nfamilies currently living within the designated EPAs along the main Pasig River will be relocated.\n\n6.\n\nStrengthen Environmental Standards and Regulations\n\nIn  some  cases  the  environmental  regulations  and  standards  are  outdated  and\n65.\nincompatible  with  modern  development  and  pollution  control  practices.  It  is  necessary,\ntherefore,  to  review,  strengthen,  modernize,  and  unify  the  environmental  management\nregulations  and  pollution  discharge  standards  for  wastewater  discharges  for  new  and  existing\nthe  Pasig  River  system.  This  will  require  modern,  appropriate,\ndevelopment  within \nimplementable,  and  enforceable  environmental  standards  and  regulations,  as  well  as\nappropriate  market-based  instruments  for  pollution  control,  to  be  developed  for  residential,\ncommercial,  institutional,  and  industrial  development.  It  is  also  necessary  to  streamline  the\nreview and approval procedures for the issuance of environmental compliance certificates, and\nthe monitoring and enforcement procedures for wastewater discharge permits. Also, the private\nseptic  tank  cleaning  companies  will  be  subjected  to  stronger  regulation  to  ensure  that  the\ncollected  septage  is  properly  treated  and  disposed  of,  which  is  presently  not  the  case.  The\nPRRC  has  formed  an  interagency  working  group  consisting  of  DENR,  Department  of  Health,\nHUDCC,  Housing  and  Land  Use  Regulatory  Board,  LLDA,  and  MMDA  among  other  sector\nrepresentatives  to  review,  modify,  and  unify  the  various  standards  and  regulations  being\nadopted by different agencies.\n\n7.\n\nStrengthen Water Quality Monitoring and Enforcement\n\n66.\nTo  adequately  monitor,  manage,  and  control  the  volume  and  concentration  of\nwastewater  effluents  discharged  to  the  Pasig  River  system,  the  existing  water  monitoring  and\npollution  control  enforcement  system  must  be  reformed  and  expanded.  A  first  step  will  be  to\nincrease  the  number  of  monitoring  stations  and  frequency  of  water  quality  sampling,  and\nimprove  the  analysis  of  collected  data.  The  Government  has  requested  Danida  to  provide\nparallel  cofinancing  for  capacity  building  assistance  for  the  PMO  and  support  for  community\nawareness, livelihood activities, water quality monitoring, and industrial pollution data base. The\nNorwegian  Government  is  also  considering  financing  the  provision  of  equipment  for  water\nquality monitoring stations in Laguna Lake and the Pasig River. Other steps to strengthen water\nquality monitoring and enforcement include regular semiannual and frequent random monitoring\nof holders of wastewater discharge permits. Monitoring will be done to ensure that the volume\nand BOD concentration of the discharged effluents conform with the limits set in the discharge\npermit. Enterprises participating in the discharge permit scheme will also be required to prepare\nand  submit  quarterly  self-assessment  reports  on  wastewater  discharge  volumes  and\nconcentrations, and show that the operations are in compliance with the discharge permit and\nthe environmental regulations and standards.\n\n\f20\n\n8.\n\nEnhance Public Awareness of Environmental Issues\n\n67.\nAn important requirement for rehabilitating the Pasig River is the support of the general\npublic and of various special interest groups, such as industry groups and NGOs. The majority\nof  city  residents  are  not  fully  aware  of  the  detrimental  impact  that  poor  water  quality  and  a\ndegraded urban environment can have on their health, and the high cost that is imposed on the\neconomy  as  a  whole.  To  successfully  implement  many  of  the  required  policy  reforms  and\nmeasures, the full support of the public, Government agencies, media, the private sector, and\nNGOs must be mobilized. Public support and understanding is also needed of the benefits that\nwill  arise  from  the  adoption  and  enforcement  of  strict  environmental  regulations.  The\nGovernment has recognized the vital importance of establishing an effective public awareness\nprogram  to  introduce  the  necessary  wastewater  management  policies  and  urban  renewal\nactivities. Continuous monitoring of the impact of various awareness campaigns will be carried\nout  to  identify  their  effectiveness  and  provide  important  feedback  for  further  programs.  The\nAdvocacy  Committee  of  the  PRRC  will  act  as  the  focal  point  for  the  design,  coordination,  and\nimplementation  of  public  awareness-raising  campaigns.  PRRC  staff  will  receive  training  in  the\nmanagement  and  implementation  of  awareness-raising  campaigns,  and  the  design  and\nimplementation of impact assessment programs.\n\n9.\n\nInstitutional Strengthening\n\n68.\nThere  is  a  direct  relationship  between  inadequate  water  quality  monitoring  and\nmanagement,  and  the  limited  capacity  of  the  responsible  government,  private  sector,  and  civil\nsociety  organizations.  The  Government  is  giving  high  priority  to  improving  the  environmental\nmanagement  of  the  Pasig  River  basin;  to  achieve  this  it  is  necessary  to  have  strong,  capable\nenvironmental management agencies.\n\nD. \n\nCapacity Building\n\n69.\nThe  agencies  responsible  for  environmental  management  in  the  Pasig  River  basin\ninclude  the  PRRC,  DENR,  and  LLDA;  each  has  limited  capacity  to  monitor  conditions  and\nenforce  environmental  regulations  and  standards.  A  capacity-building  program  is  needed  for\nhuman resource development and training, and to provide additional equipment. The PRRC will\nprepare  and  implement  plans  to  strengthen  the  ability  of  institutions  to  identify,  quantify,  and\nmonitor pollution services; enforce regulations and standards; and impose and collect fees for\nwastewater discharge permits. The following capacity-building activities are proposed.\n\n1.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n70.\nTo enhance sustainability and support the implementation of the actions required under\nthe policy reform agenda, the Government has asked ADB to provide TA for capacity building to\nhelp  (i)  the  PRRC,  through  the  PMO,  to  effectively  coordinate  with  the  funding  sources  and\nconcerned  agencies  implementing  the  various  development  programs  under  the  PRRP;  (ii)\nMMDA  to  coordinate  the  plans  and  programs  of  the  national  agencies  and  LGUs  within  the\nPasig  River  basin;  and  (iii)  the  LGUs  within  the  Pasig  River  catchment  to  prepare\ncomprehensive  development  and  zoning  plans  for  the  areas  adjacent  to  the  river  and  in  the\ndevelopment of proposals for urban renewal.\n\n\f21\n\n2.\n\nBilateral Assistance\n\n71.\nThe  Mission  has  undertaken  discussions  with  potential  cofinanciers  and  identified  the\npossibility  of  parallel  cofinancing  on  a  grant  basis  being  provided  by  Danida  and  the  United\nStates Trade and Development Agency for capacity-building activities and technical studies.\n\na.\n\nProposed Danida Assistance\n\nThe  Danida  support  will  be  targeted  at  developing  the  capacity  of  the  PMO  to  collect,\n72.\nanalyze, and dispense the information and data needed to better enable the PRRC to discharge\nits responsibilities for overall river rehabilitation. Care will be taken to avoid overlap with ADB\u2019s\nproposed  TA,  which  will  focus  specifically  on  developing  the  PMO\u2019s  capability  and  capacity  to\nimplement  the  Project.  In  addition  to  capacity  building,  Danida  will  provide  support  for  (i)\ncommunity awareness of environmental issues; (ii) development of community-based livelihood\nactivities; (iii) continued support for the development and refinement of the mathematical model\nfor Pasig River water quality monitoring; and (iv) development of industrial pollution data bank,\nto assist with industrial pollution control. The Danida assistance is estimated at DKr 16 million\n($2.2 million equivalent).16 Capacity-building services will be provided over a period of about 2\nyears.\n\nb.\n\nUS-TDA Assistance\n\ni.\n\nToxic and Hazardous Waste Management\n\nThe  study  will  assess  the  need  for  a  regional  toxic  and  hazardous  waste  (THW)\n73.\nmanagement  facility  for  Metro  Manila.  This  will  include  an  evaluation  and  assessment  of\nownership  and  operational  conditions,  deficiencies,  and  issues  relating  to  institutional\ncapabilities, regulations, enforcement, and compliance. The study will provide an assessment of\nthe  characteristics  of  THW  generated  in  Metro  Manila,  and  the  level  of  public  awareness  of\nTHW  issues.  The  assistance  will  also  focus  on  the  review  and  evaluation  of  modalities  for\nprivate  sector  participation,  and  prepare  draft  documentation  and  action  plans  for  facility\ndevelopment, process, and siting for the first phase of the THW facility. The study will also cover\nthe revenue potential of THW. The cost of the study is estimated at $500,000.\n\nii.\n\nIndustrial Location Strategy Study\n\nThe study will prepare an industrial relocation strategy for industries situated along the\n74.\nPasig  River  to  fulfill  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  reducing  river  pollution  from  industrial\nsources. This will include advice to the Government on the constraints to relocation, impact on\nemployment  in  Metro  Manila,  the  mechanisms  and  incentives  required  to  overcome  these\nconstraints, and the resultant propensity for industries to relocate. The assistance will (i) prepare\na  baseline  profile  of  industrial  establishments  located  in  the  Pasig  River  basin;  (ii)  carry  out  a\nstudy of the oil industry with a view to relocating and redeveloping existing sites; (iii) determine\nthe  major  constraints  to  relocation  and  devise  a  method  for  assessing  the  willingness  of\nindustries  to  relocate;  (v)  identify  appropriate  policy  tools  and  other  mechanisms  to  help  with\nindustrial  relocation;  (vi)  identify  the  demand  and  potential  for  relocation  into  the  proposed\nindustrial cluster areas, including the potential for the private sector to satisfy that demand; and\n(vii)  formulate  a  comprehensive  industrial  relocation  strategy  for  the  Pasig  River  system.  The\ncost of the study is estimated at $500,000.\n\n                                                          \n16 DKr = Danish kroner.\n\n\f22\n\nE.\n\nThe Investment Project\n\n1.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  investment  Project  is  to  provide  resources  to  support  the\n75.\nimplementation  of  public  sector  components  necessary  to \nthe  environmental\nmanagement  of  the  Pasig  River  basin  within  Metro  Manila,  particularly  for  wastewater\nmanagement, and to promote urban renewal.\n\nimprove \n\n76.\nFor  the  first  phase  of  urban  renewal,  EPAs  will  be  established  along  the  Pasig  River\nbanks,  and  about  10,000  squatter  families  will  be  relocated  to  in-city,  medium-rise  apartment\nbuildings  and  near-to-town  house  and  lot  schemes.  Also,  about  500  ha  of  low-income  slum\nhousing, adjacent to the EPAs, will be upgraded including regularization of tenure and provision\nof  basic  services.  It  is  expected  that  about  80,000  families  will  benefit  from  upgrading.  The\nremoval of squatters and urban upgrading is expected to remove a further 5 t/d of BOD loading\nfrom  the  river.  A  summary  of  the  components  follows  and  a  detailed  description  is  given  in\nAppendix 6.\n\n77.\nTo  improve  water  quality,  a  sanitation  service,  comprising  a  septage  treatment  and\ndisposal  facility,  and  a  septic  tank  cleaning  service  consisting  of  a  fleet  of  vacuum  tanker\nvehicles  will  be  provided.  The  fleet  will  operate  a  two-shift  system  and  be  able  to  empty  an\naverage  of  four  septic  tanks  per  truck  per  day.  The  fleet  will  be  operational  for  260  days  per\nyear, and clean about 37,000 septic tanks annually. With an average desludging frequency of\nfive  years,  this  service  would  handle  about  185,000  septic  tanks  and  benefit  about  1.0  million\npeople. The septage collection service will reduce the current pollution load to the Pasig River\nby 16 tons of BOD per day, and in conjunction with the other sewerage and sanitation service\nbeing  provided  by  MWSS  concessionaires,  will  enable  Class  C  standard  water  quality  to  be\nachieved and sustained for the Pasig River.\n\n2.\n\nComponents\n\na.\n\nSanitation\n\nThe proposed sanitation services cover the collection of septage from septic tanks, and\n\n78.\nthe treatment and disposal of the collected septage.\n\ni.\n\nCollection Service\n\n79.\nThe  septage  collection  service  will  add  to  the  overall  sanitation  coverage  in  the  Pasig\nRiver  basin  through  the  provision  of  20  vacuum  trucks  with  10  m3  capacity  and  16  vacuum\ntrucks with 6 m3 capacity to service Makati, Mandaluyong, Pateros, San Juan, and Taguig, local\ngovernment  areas  covered  by  the  MWSS  east  concession  that  are  targeted  to  receive  zero\nsanitation coverage throughout the life of the concession agreement. By providing this service,\nthe  majority  of  septic  tanks  in  the  affected  communities  will  operate  more  efficiently,  thus\nsignificantly reducing the discharge of sludge and fecal material with high BOD loading into the\nstorm drainage system, and ultimately the Pasig River.\n\nii.\n\nSeptage Treatment Plant\n\n80.\nThe overall sanitation coverage will also be improved through the provision of a septage\ntreatment plant with a capacity of 600 m3 per day. The plant will provide treatment for collected\n\n\f23\n\nseptage  and  will  include  (i)  receiving  facilities  for  septage  haulers;  (ii)  preliminary  treatment,\nincluding mechanical screens and holding tanks with thickener mechanisms allowing septage to\nthicken prior to dewatering; (iii) septage dewatering equipment; and (iv) chemical stabilization.\nThe  treated  liquid  effluent  will  meet  DENR  discharge  standards  and  will  be  suitable  for\ndischarge  to  public  drainage  systems.  Pathogens  will  be  removed  from  the  residual  sludge\ncake,  which  will  be  stable  and  suitable  for  use  as  soil  conditioner.  The  design,  construction,\noperation,  and  maintenance  of  the  plant,  and  the  procurement  and  operation  of  the  vacuum\ntrucks will be contracted through competitive and transparent bidding conducted in accordance\nwith procedures acceptable to ADB. The sanitation services operating agreement will also be on\nterms and conditions acceptable to ADB.\n\nb.\n\nEnvironmental Preservation Areas\n\n81.\nThrough  the  Project,  the  PRRC  aims  to  establish  parks,  walkways,  and  greenbelts  for\nabout 23 km of 10 m wide EPAs along the Pasig River banks. This will include the relocation of\napproximately  10,000  squatter  families  currently  living  in  depressed  conditions  along  the\nriverbanks  within  the  designated  EPAs,  and  the  development  of  EPAs.  About  9,260  squatter\nfamilies will be relocated to low-income sites-and-services housing projects near Metro Manila.\nEach  relocated  family  will  have  one  lot  of  30  m2  and a  core  house  with connections  to  water,\nsanitation, and electricity services. The principal relocation site is at Rodriguez, Rizal, about 30\nminutes from Cubao, Quezon City by public transport. To give relocatees an element of choice,\nalternative sites are being identified in Cavite province. About 240 families will be relocated to\nfive-storey, medium-rise, walk-up, apartment buildings within Metro Manila. The remaining 500\nfamilies will choose not to participate in the socialized housing scheme and will make their own\narrangement for housing. The housing and apartment building projects will include a full range\nof community amenities, including schools, health centers, multipurpose halls, day-care centers,\nlivelihood opportunities, and recreation facilities. The housing projects and apartment buildings\nwill be developed by NHA and HUDCC through joint ventures with the private sector.\n\nc.\n\nUrban Renewal Areas\n\n82.\nUrban renewal areas, adjacent to EPAs, will be upgraded through the provision of basic\ninfrastructure  and  essential  municipal  services,  to  improve  living  conditions  and  raise  public\nhealth  standards.  The  entire  urban  renewal  program  will  cover  about  500  ha  of  depressed,\npoorly  serviced,  low-income  housing  areas,  and  will  benefit  about  80,000  families.  The\nupgrading  and  urban  renewal  will  be  carried  out  by  participating  LGUs  and  MMDA,  in\nconsultation with DENR, and will cover (i) the registration of all unregistered land; (ii) provision\nof basic infrastructure such as water, sanitation, drainage, roads, and community services and\nfacilities,  including  flood  prevention  programs  and  solid  waste  management  systems;  and  (iii)\ncommunity-based  livelihood  schemes.  Under  TA  2803  (footnote  4),  two  pilot  areas  were\nidentified, and feasibility studies prepared for them, as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPunta, Sta. Ana, Manila is home to 800 families on 5 ha of Government-owned\nland known as the DPWH Compound, adjacent to the Pasig River. It is proposed\nto undertake comprehensive urban upgrading to include land titling, provision of\nbasic infrastructure, community facilities, and riverbank improvements.\n\nBarangay Santolan, Pasig City comprises 17 ha of land with about 2,600 families\nadjacent  to  the  Marikina  River.  The  land  is  partly  in  public  and  partly  private\nownership.  It  is  proposed  to  undertake  land  titling,  infrastructure  improvements,\nflood prevention, and livelihood schemes.\n\n\f24\n\nd.\n\nProject Implementation Assistance\n\n83.\nProject  implementation  assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  PMO  to  strengthen  project\nmanagement  capabilities;  help  with  project  coordination  and  implementation,  particularly\ninteragency  coordination  and  the  interface  between  the  environment  and  urban  management;\nand  provide  assistance  for  finalizing  the  sanitation  component  and  preparing  the  necessary\ncontract documentation. Specific assistance to the PMO will include (i) coordination, monitoring,\nand implementation of the Project; (ii) assistance to HUDCC, MMDA, NHA, and the LGUs in the\nimplementation and management of EPAs and urban renewal components; and (iii) provision of\nspecialist  technical  advice  and  assistance.  Assistance  will  also  be  given  to  refine  and  further\ndevelop  the  feasibility  study  for  the  sanitation  component,  particularly  site  identification  and\nselection  for  the  septage  treatment  plant;  wastewater  engineering  aspects;  preparation  of\ndocumentation  for  the  design,  procurement,  construction,  and  operation  contracts;  and\nprequalification of contractors, bid evaluation, and overall project management. The consulting\nservices for project implementation assistance will be provided over a period of three and a half\nyears and will require 54 person-months of international consulting and 102 person-months of\ndomestic  consulting.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  implementation  assistance\nare given in Appendix 7.\n\n3.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n84.\nThe investment Project is estimated to cost $150.0 million equivalent, comprising $50.0\nmillion  in  foreign  exchange  (33  percent)  and  $100.0  million  (67  percent)  equivalent  in  local\ncurrency  costs.  The  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are\ngiven in Appendix 8. The base cost estimates are in July 1999 prices, and include provision for\ninterest and other charges during construction.\n\nTable 1. Cost Estimate\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nA.

The proceeds of the loan will be\nused  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  component  of  the  Project,  including  the  interest\nduring  construction  and  a  portion  of  the  local  currency  cost  equivalent  to  $25.0  million.  The\nprovision  of  local  currency  cost  financing  is  considered  warranted  from  the  overall  program\nviewpoint  to  ensure  that  sufficient  and  timely  funding  is  available  for  consulting  services,\ncapacity  building,  and  procurement,  thereby  minimizing  risks  of  implementation  delay  and\n\n\f25\n\nensuring  appropriate  capacity-building  activities  and  timely  project  completion.  Country\nconsiderations justify the provision of local currency cost financing. Concerted efforts have been\nmade  to  maintain  domestic  investment  at  levels  to  sustain  growth,  but  the  country  faces\npersistent  pressure  on  the  budget,  arising  from  the  currency  crisis.  For  the  balance  of  local\ncurrency  costs,  amounting  to  $75  million  equivalent,  the  Government,  through  the  PRRC,  will\nprovide  grants  amounting  to  $69.5  million  equivalent,  and  the  LGUs  will  provide  $5.5  million\nequivalent. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2, and details are presented in Appendix\n9.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nADB\nNational Government\nLocal Government\n\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n50.0\n0.0\n0.0\n50.0\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n25.0\n69.5\n5.5\n100.0\n\nTotal\n\nPercentage\n\n75.0\n69.5\n5.5\n150.0\n\n50\n46\n4\n100\n\nF.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n86.\nBoth  the  policy  and  investment  loan  elements  of  the  SDP  are  expected  to  have  a\nconsiderable  beneficial  impact  on  the  environment  and  public  health  over  the  medium  to  long\nterm.  The  SDP  was  designed  in  consultation  with  central  and  local  government  agencies,\nNGOs, community groups, people\u2019s organizations, affected persons, and civil society in general,\nand  is  expected  to  benefit  all  residents  of  Metro  Manila.  These  groups  will  participate  in  SDP\nimplementation.\n\n87.\nThrough the sanitation component, the establishment and related development of EPAs\nalong  the  riverbanks,  and  improvements  in  the  urban  renewal  areas,  it  is  envisaged  that  the\nSDP  will  have  a  significant  beneficial  impact  on  the  Pasig  River  and  riverside  communities  in\nparticular, and the urban environment of Metro Manila in general. In view of the small size of the\nworks  undertaken  in  EPAs  and  the  urban  renewal  areas,  potential  negative  impacts  due  to\nconstruction activities will be minimal and readily mitigated.\n\n88.\nSpecific attention has been devoted to the relocation of affected persons living in EPAs.\nResettlement  is  a  highly  consultative,  iterative  process  to  be  implemented  in  a  flexible,\nresponsive manner, in accordance with the detailed resettlement plan prepared by the PRRC.\nAlthough  the  relocation  sites  will  experience  a  change  in  land  use,  none  includes  any\nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas,  and  the  developments  are  designed  to  minimize  adverse\nimpacts on the surrounding environment. Although site development is spread over a relatively\nwide area, the works are small in scale and adverse environmental impacts during construction\ncan be readily mitigated.\n\n89.\nThe septage treatment plant is environmentally sensitive with respect to its location and\ndesign. Careful attention will be given to minimizing adverse environmental impacts arising from\nits operation, and the disposal of treated liquid effluents and stabilized biosolids. Furthermore,\nthe selected site will be subjected to a full environmental siting study in accordance with ADB\nprocedures  and  the  preparation  of  an  environmental  impact  statement  in  accordance  with  the\n\n\f26\n\nrequirements  of  DENR.  Overall,  the  SDP  is  classified  as  Environmental  Category  B,  and  the\nsummary initial environmental examination is given in Appendix 10.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n90.\nSDP beneficiaries include both direct and indirect beneficiaries. Direct beneficiaries are\n(i) the 10,000 families relocated from squatter shanties to fully serviced permanent housing with\nsecurity of tenure, (ii) the approximately 80,000 families living in substandard conditions who will\nbenefit  from  urban  renewal,  and  (iii)  the  approximately  185,000  households  in  the  sanitation\nservice  area  that  will  benefit  from  septic  tank  cleaning.  The  indirect  beneficiaries  are  the\nresident population of Metro Manila who will benefit from overall environmental improvements, a\ncleaner Pasig River, and greater access to the river. Achievement of water quality Class C on\nthe  Pasig  River  will  improve  health  standards  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  and\nsanitation-related  diseases.  Living  conditions  and  health  standards  for  people  relocated  from\nEPAs  will  improve  considerably.  This  will  particularly  benefit  women  who  are  severely\ndisadvantaged  by  poor  living  conditions  and  health  standards.  Establishment  of  EPAs  will\nprovide parks and open space, improve access to the river, and reduce the illegal dumping of\nsolid  waste  and  discharge  of  wastewater  from  riverside  communities.  Overall,  the  Pasig  River\nand  its  surroundings  will  be  more  visually  attractive,  safe,  and  accessible  to  the  whole\npopulation  of  Metro  Manila.  The  improvements  will  enable  the  areas  to  be  used  for  both\nrecreational and commercial purposes, providing opportunities for income-generating activities.\nUpgrading  in  the  urban  renewal  areas  will  benefit  the  poor  communities  outside  EPAs.  There\nwill  be  a  greater  sense  of  security  in  acquiring  land  and  permanency  of  residence.  This  will\nreduce stress and enhance opportunities to invest in shelter improvement. Living conditions of\nthe  families  will  be  improved  through  access  to  better  sanitation  and  facilities.  Septage  and\ndomestic wastewater treatment will improve sanitation and reduce the discharge of pollutants to\nthe Pasig River. There will be an overall health benefit for the beneficiaries within the serviced\narea  due  to  reduced  potential  for  waterborne  diseases  and  nuisance  of  odors.  The  PRRC,\nthrough HUDCC and NHA, and with ADB assistance has prepared a detailed resettlement plan\nin  close  consultation  with  affected  communities,  NGOs,  LGUs,  and  other  stakeholders.  The\nresettlement  plan  is  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines,  and  is  available  to  the  public.  The\nsummary resettlement plan is attached as Appendix 11.\n\nV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED LOANS\n\nA.\n\nThe Policy Loan\n\n1.\n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n91.\nIt is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reform agenda by providing a\nloan  of  $100  million  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  15\nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  with  interest  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\npool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans and a commitment charge of 0.75\npercent per annum. The Borrower will be the Republic of the Philippines.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agencies\n\nThe Department of Finance and the PRRC will be the Executing Agencies for the policy\n\n92.\nloan. The PRRC will be responsible for ensuring that the tranche release conditions are met.\n\n\f27\n\n3.\n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n93.\nThe  policy  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of  items\nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  listed  ineligible  items  (Appendix\n12), and imports financed under other official development assistance. The Borrower will certify\nthat (i) in case the proceeds of the loan will finance imports already made, the value of eligible\nimports in the period concerned exceeds the amount of the requested withdrawal, or (ii) in case\nthe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  finance  items  to  be  imported,  the  value  of  eligible  imports  in  the\nimmediately preceding one-year period is equal to or greater than the amount of the requested\nwithdrawal  plus  all  other  amounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  during  the  succeeding  one-year\nperiod.\n\n4.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n94.\nThe Government will ensure that the counterpart funds are used to support the reforms\nto  be  initiated  or  implemented  under  the  SDP,  and  will,  in  particular,  be  used  to  support  the\nimplementation  of  the  SDP  works.  The  Borrower  will  make  available,  as  part  of  its  budgetary\nallocation  throughout  Program  implementation,  a  total  matching  commitment  of  at  least  $75\nmillion equivalent.\n\n5.\n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n95.\nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $40  million  will  be\nreleased  upon  loan  effectiveness.  For  the  SDP  to  be  effective,  it  is  essential  that  the\nGovernment  initiate  certain  administrative  and  policy  actions  in  advance  of  the  first  tranche\nrelease  to  demonstrate  its  commitment  to  the  policy  reform  agenda.  In  recognition  of  this,  the\nGovernment  has  completed  the  following:  (i)  the  PRRC  has  reviewed  and  approved  the  first\nphase  of  the  PRDP,  submitted  the  plan  to  the  Metro  Manila  Council,  and  issued  a  statement\nadopting the first phase of the PRDP; (ii) the Metro Manila Council has adopted the first phase\nof the PRDP; (iii) the PRRC has advised ADB that (a) the Government\u2019s policy for sanitation is\nfor  the  PRRC  to  provide  additional  sanitation  coverage,  (b)  discussions  on  the  tariff  structure\nand charging mechanism have been initiated, (c) a legal opinion has been obtained from OGCC\nindicating  that  the  provision  of  sanitation  services  is  not  an  exclusive  right  of  the  MWSS\nconcessionaires,  and  (d)  satisfactory  arrangements  have  been  made  with  MWSS  and  the\nconcessionaires  regarding  the  sanitation  component;  (iv)  the  detailed  and  comprehensive\nresettlement plan has been prepared in consultation with the affected communities, and made\navailable  to  the  public;  and  (v)  an  initial  information,  education,  and  advocacy  plan  has  been\nprepared for the campaign to enhance public awareness of environmental issues.\n\n96.\nADB  will  undertake  an  interim  review  of  the  SDP  prior  to  the  release  of  the  second\ntranche.  The  second  tranche,  comprising  the  balance  of  the  policy  loan  of  $60  million,  is\nexpected  to  be  released  within  12  months  of  the  effective  date,  provided  that  (i)  the\nimplementation  of  Phase  1  of  the  PRDP  shall  have  been  commenced  by  the  preparation  of\ntime-bound  development  plans  for  the  EPAs  and  two  pilot  urban  renewal  areas;  the\nimplementation  of  the  Resettlement  Action  Plan,  substantially  in  accordance  with  the\nimplementation  schedule  set  forth  therein;  the  submission  to  ADB  of  satisfactory  drafts  of  the\nfollowing documents for additional sanitation and septage services: (a) a feasibility study, (b) an\nenvironmental  siting  study,  (c)  invitations  and  instructions  to  bid,  and  (d)  contracts  for  the\ndesign, procurement, and operation of the sanitation facilities, the design and construction of the\nseptage  treatment  plant  on  a  full  turnkey  basis,  and  its  subsequent  operation;  (ii)  the  PRRC\ncharter  shall  have  been  amended  to  authorize  the  PRRC  to  contract  for  additional  sanitation\n\n\f28\n\nand  septage  services  and  set  an  appropriate  tariff  structure  therefore;  (iii)  a  DENR\nadministrative  order  shall  have  been  issued  introducing  a  system  for  wastewater  discharge\npermits  and  permit  fees,  which  permit  fees  shall  be  utilized  to  strengthen  pollution  monitoring\nand  enforcement  of  environmental  standards  and  regulations  pertaining  to  the  wastewater\ndischarge; (iv) the MMDA shall have, jointly with each of any four LGUs (Makati, Mandaluyong,\nManila,  Marikina,  Pasay,  Pasig,  Quezon,  Pateros,  San  Juan  and  Taguig),  (a)  developed  and\nsubmitted  for  the  approval  of  the  PRRC  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  mobilizing  communities\nalong  the  Pasig  River  to  improve  domestic  solid  waste  collection  and  garbage  recycling,  (b)\nreviewed  the  land  use  plans  and  zoning  classifications  for  riverside  land,  and  (c)  developed\nupdated  plans  and  classifications  that  will  allow  for  the  development  of  the  EPAs  along  the\nriverside  and  mitigate  the  continued  pollution  of  the  Pasig  River;  (v)  the  interagency  working\ngroup  shall  have  reviewed  the  existing  environmental  standards  and  regulations  affecting\nwastewater  discharge  into  the  Pasig  River  and,  if  determined  necessary,  developed  new  and\nappropriate  environmental  regulations,  and \nthe  development  of  environmental\nstandards relating to wastewater discharge into the Pasig River by existing and new residential,\ncommercial,  institutional  and  industrial  developments;  (vi)  the  PRRC,  DENR,  and  LLDA  shall\nhave developed, and the PRRC shall have approved, a time-bound action plan for the operation\nof monitoring stations to ensure frequent monitoring and regular sampling of the water quality of\nthe  Pasig  River;  and  (vii)  the  PRRC,  DENR,  and  LLDA  shall  have  developed,  approved,  and\ncommenced  the  implementation  of  a  time-bound  action  plan  to  strengthen  their  capability  and\ncapacity  to  identify,  quantify,  and  monitor  pollution  sources,  enforce  environmental  standards\nand regulations, and impose and collect fees for wastewater discharge permits.\n\ninitiated \n\nB.\n\nThe Investment Loan\n\n1.\n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n97.\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  an  investment  loan  of  $75  million  from  its  ordinary\ncapital resources to finance the entire foreign exchange costs of the SDP and part of the local\ncurrency costs. The loan will carry an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s\npool-based variable lending rate for US dollar loans, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent.\nThe  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  which  is\nequivalent  to  the  implementation  period  of  the  investment  components  to  be  financed.  The\nBorrower will be the Republic of the Philippines. The Government will make the loan proceeds\navailable to the Executing Agency through budgetary allocations.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\na.\n\nProject Management\n\nThe  PRRC  will  be  the  project  Executing  Agency,  responsible  for  overall  management,\n98.\ncoordination  and  monitoring  of  project  implementation.  The  PRRC  established  the  PMO  to\nmonitor  the  day-to-day  progress  of  implementation  of  the  policy  reforms  and  coordinate\nimplementation  of  the  various  components  of  the  investment  Project.  To  perform  these  tasks,\nthe  PMO  will  initiate  project  management  mechanisms  and  procedures  for  the  regular\nmonitoring of implementation and problem-solving.\n\n99.\nFor the policy reform measures, the PRRC will ensure that the first phase of the PRDP is\nadopted and will be in charge of the establishment, development, and protection of EPAs along\nthe  riverbanks.  The  PRRC,  in  coordination  with  DENR  and  LLDA,  will  be  responsible  for\nreviewing, rationalizing, and strengthening the environmental regulations and effluent discharge\nstandards  from  industrial,  commercial,  institutional,  and  residential  establishments.  DENR  and\n\n\f29\n\nLLDA  will  introduce  the  polluter  pays  principle  to  Metro  Manila,  and  will  set  the  effluent\ndischarge  permit  fees,  assess  and  monitor  industrial  and  commercial  enterprises,  issue\ndischarge permits, and collect fees.\n\n100. HUDCC and NHA will be responsible for developing the housing and apartment building\nprojects, and the LGUs will be responsible for community consultation, providing assistance with\nsquatter  relocation  and  community  preparation,  and  development  of  the  areas  vacated  by  the\nsquatters.\n\n101.\nThe  LGUs  and  MMDA  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  upgrading  in  the  urban\nrenewal  areas with  assistance  as  necessary  from  the  PMO.  LGU  responsibility  will  include\ncommunity  consultation  to  prioritize  project  areas  and  components,  and  reach  an  agreement\nwith communities on cost-sharing arrangements. The LGUs will also be responsible for project\npreparation  activities  for  the  provision  of  infrastructure  and  basic  community services  in  the\nurban renewal areas.\n\nb.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n102.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  five  years,  from  2000  to  2005,  in\naccordance  with  the  implementation  schedule  given  in  Appendix  13.  This  schedule  is\nconsidered  appropriate  and  achievable  because  the  PRRC  has  overall  responsibility,  and\nimplementation  of  specific  components  will  be  undertaken  by  experienced  implementing\nagencies.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n103. Procurement  of  goods  and  services  shall  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Contracts  for  the  sanitation  and  septage  facilities,  including\ncontracts  for  the  lease  and  operation  thereof,  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international\ncompetitive  bidding.  Bidders  shall  be  prequalified  before  bidding  but  shall  not  be  required  to\nobtain a Philippine Contractor\u2019s Accreditation Board License as a condition for prequalification,\nbidding,  or  award  of  contract.  Civil  works  contracts  for  EPAs  and  urban  renewal  areas,  all  of\nwhich are expected to cost less than the equivalent of $3 million, will be awarded on the basis of\nlocal  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the  standard\nprocurement procedures of the Borrower acceptable to ADB, provided that the apartment units\nin  the  medium-rise  apartment  buildings  and  the  housing  units  will  be  procured  in  bulk  from\nlicensed private developers. Indicative contract packages for procurement are given in Appendix\n14.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n104. Services of international and domestic consultants will be required to assist with project\nimplementation and to review, refine, and further develop the feasibility study for the sanitation\ncomponent. The consultants will be selected by the PRRC. All consultants to be financed from\nthe proceeds of the ADB loan will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants.\n\n5.\n\nFlow of Funds\n\n105.\nThe  Department  of  Finance,  as  the  representative  of  the  Borrower,  will  pass  on  the\nproceeds  of  the  investment  loan  to  the  PRRC  through  budgetary  allocations.  The  PRRC  will\n\n\f30\n\nallocate,  as  budgetary  allocations,  appropriate  amounts  from  the  loan  funds  to  the  various\nImplementing  Agencies,  which  are  members  of  the  PRRC,  including  MMDA  for  the  urban\nrenewal  components,  DENR/LLDA  for  water  quality  monitoring,  and  HUDCC/NHA  for\nresettlement.\n\n6.\n\nImprest Account\n\n106.\nTo  facilitate  disbursement  for  small  items  of  equipment,  public  awareness  campaigns,\nand training activities, an imprest account, with a ceiling of $300,000, will be established after\nloan  effectiveness  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  imprest\naccount  will  be  operated  by  the  PRRC.  Disbursement  from  the  imprest  account  will  be\nsupported  by  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation. \nIndividual\npayments  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  not\nexceed $50,000 equivalent.\n\n7.\n\nAnticorruption\n\n107. During  project  processing  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  Government\nofficials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was recently added to\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors\nto  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed\ncontracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption\nprovisions  added  to  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  were  also  discussed.  The\nability of PRRC and the Implementing Agencies to prevent potentially corrupt practices will be\nenhanced  through  the  introduction  of  appropriate  project  management  and  monitoring\nprocedures  developed  through  the  capacity  building  provided  by  project  implementation\nassistance and TA.\n\n108. ADB and the Government will undertake periodic reviews during project implementation.\nThe  reviews  will  include  evaluations  of  the  project  scope,  implementation  arrangements,\nresettlement, consultation with affected persons, achievement of scheduled targets, progress on\nthe agenda for policy reform, and capacity-building measures.\n\n8.\n\nProject Reviews\n\n9.\n\nReports\n\n109.\nThe  PRRC  will  submit  reports  to  ADB  concerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and\ninformation concerning the administration and financial management of the Project. The reports\nwill include (i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation, (ii) annual reports, and (iii) a\nproject  completion  report  to  be  submitted  not  later  than  six  months  after  project  completion.\nProgress  reports  will  cover  the  areas  of  (i)  policy  reform,  (ii)  environmental  management  and\nwater quality monitoring, (iii) resettlement, (iv) achievement of sanitation improvements, and (v)\ncapacity building.\n\n10.\n\nAccounts and Audit\n\n110.\nIt was explained to the PRRC that compliance with ADB\u2019s revised guidelines, introduced\nin  1998,  for  the  submission  of  project  reports,  audited  accounts,  and  financial  statements  is\nmandatory  and  will  be  strictly  enforced  by  ADB.  In  particular,  the  following  consequences  for\nnoncompliance  were  highlighted:  (i)  suspension  of  disbursements,  new  contract  awards,  and\n\n\f31\n\nreplenishment of the imprest account if compliance is delayed by more than 6 months; and (ii)\nsuspension of the loan if compliance is delayed by more than 12 months.\n\n11.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring System\n\n111.\nThe  PRRC  will  integrate  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  into  the\nproject  management  information  system,  and  with  the  assistance  of  consultants,  will  develop\ncomprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  systematically  generate  input  and  output  data  for  each\nproject  component.  The  PPMS  will  also  generate  socioeconomic  data  and  environmental\nindicators  to  measure  project  impacts.  The  PRRC  will  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm\nachievable  goals,  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  establish  reporting\nsystems  and  procedures  for  initiating  remedial  action.  The  PPMS  design  will  be  flexible  for\nproject  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts,  and  enables  the  adoption  of\nappropriate  remedial  actions.  To  ensure  that  project  impacts  are  monitored  and  reported  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s requirements, the PRRC will monitor and assess activities, and include\nthe results in the quarterly reports to ADB on the physical implementation and financial aspects\nof  the  Project.  The  PRRC  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  socioeconomic  indicators.  The\nservices  of  a  specialist  social  sciences  organization  will  be  retained  to  survey  and  record  the\neffects of the resettlement program, changes in land use and property values along the Pasig\nRiver, increased tourism, levels of private sector investment, and related improvements. Other\nindicators will also be monitored, including the incidence of waterborne and environment-related\ndiseases, and degree of beneficiary satisfaction with general living conditions and quality of life\nin the project area. The beneficiaries\u2019 awareness about project components and activities, and\nknowledge  of  good  practice  on  environment-related  behavior  will  be  recorded.  Internal  and\nexternal  resettlement  indicators  are  built  into  the  resettlement  plan,  including  delivery  of\nresettlement entitlements, and restoration of incomes and quality of life for the people affected.\nThe PPMS will be designed with flexibility to address remedial actions that may be required to\nenhance the achievement of project objectives.\n\nVI.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\nA.\n\nObjective and Scope\n\n112.\nThe  TA  will  provide  capacity  building  for  the  PRRC,  MMDA,  and  the  LGUs.  Capacity\nbuilding  for  the  PRRC  to  support  the  PMO  in  (i)  realizing  the  policy  reform  agenda;  (ii)\nstrengthening  the  forward  planning  capabilities  of  the  PRRC;  (iii)  strengthening  the  project\nevaluation, appraisal, approval, and implementation capabilities; (iv) effectively coordinating with\nother  funding  sources,  and  national  and  local  government  agencies  implementing  the  various\nparts  of  the  PRDP;  (v)  identifying  potential  funding  and  cost  recovery  mechanisms  for  the\nimplementation  of  approved  programs  and  projects  under  the  PRDP;  (vi)  establishing  and\nmaking  operational  a  system  to  monitor  and  report  the  SDP  activities;  and  (vii)  developing\nprocedures for contract tendering, bid evaluation, and award.\n\n113. Capacity  building  for  MMDA  will  provide  assistance  with  (i)  coordinating  the  plans  and\nprograms  of  national  and  local  government  agencies  within  the  Pasig  River  basin;  (ii)\ndeveloping  the  systems  and  staff  capabilities  to  enforce  the  establishment  and  retention  of\nEPAs  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ordinances  and  regulations;  (iii)  strengthening  the\nplanning  and  coordination  capabilities  of  MMDA\u2019s  planning  staff;  (iv)  developing  a  system  for\nconsolidating plans and programs prepared by national and local government organizations and\nthe  private  sector  for  the  Pasig  River  basin;  and  (v)  establishing  a  system  for  monitoring\ndevelopment activities within the Pasig River basin.\n\n\f32\n\nLGU capacity building will focus on helping the LGUs identify urban renewal areas with\n114.\npotential  for  economic  enterprises,  commercial  and  residential  activities,  and  community\nrevitalization  zones  for  urban  poor  communities.  Assistance  will  be  given  for  (i)  preparing\ncomprehensive  development  and  zoning  plans  for  the  areas  adjacent  to  the  river,  and\ndeveloping proposals for urban renewal; (ii) defining the areas to be affected by the PRDP; and\n(iii) preparing zoning and development plans for these areas.\n\n115.\nThe  TA  will  help  to  develop  and  establish  mechanisms  to  motivate  the  community  to\nbecome  involved  with  local  NGOs  and  LGUs  in  revitalizing  the  urban  renewal  areas\neconomically  and  physically,  by  encouraging  enterprises,  introducing  poverty  reduction\nmeasures, and initiating environmental upgrading.\n\nB.\n\nCost Estimates, Financing, and Implementation\n\n116.\nThe  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1.43  million  equivalent,  comprising  $695,000  in\nforeign exchange costs and $735,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $1.0\nmillion, to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $305,000 equivalent of the local currency\ncost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility,\nfunded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to\n$430,000,  will  be  met  by  the  PRRC  through  payments  in  kind, through  the  provision  of  office\naccommodation,  counterpart  staff,  surveys,  and  logistical  support.  The  PRRC  will  be  the\nExecuting  Agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be  conducted  over  12  months  and  be  completed  by\nJune 2001. The outline terms of reference for the TA are given in Appendix 15.\n\nVII.\n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nExpected Impacts\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n117.\nThe polluted condition of the Pasig River degrades the environment of Metro Manila. It is\nunsightly  and  malodorous,  poses  health  risks,  and  acts  as  a  constraint  to  socioeconomic\ndevelopment  of  the  surrounding  urban  areas.  Improving  water  quality  and  the  environment\nalong the banks of the Pasig River are high Government priorities.\n\n118.\nThe  economic  analysis  was  prepared  for  the  SDP  as  a  whole,  because  the  primary\nbenefits derive from (i) water quality improvements in the Pasig River; and (ii) the improvements\nin  environmental  quality  along  the  riverbanks  and  adjacent  urban  areas.  These  benefits  are\ngenerated  jointly  by  the  SDP  and  by  other  projects  and  programs.  The  economic  analysis\nassesses the incremental impact of the SDP on water quality and the urban environment, taking\ninto account attributable improvements.\n\n119. SDP  beneficiaries  are  the  residents  of  Metro  Manila  who  will  benefit  from  the  cleaner\nand  sweeter  smelling  river  running  thought  the  center  of  the  city.  Specifically,  they  will  benefit\nfrom  improved  river  water  quality  and  environmental  enhancement  along  the  riverbanks,  also\nthrough  better  access  to  the  river,  economic  development,  and  recreational  opportunities.  In\naddition,  families  relocated  from  the  riverbanks  will  benefit  from  healthier  and  safer  living\nconditions, security of tenure, improved water supply, better sanitation facilities, and other basic\nservices,  less  contact  with  contaminated  water,  and  reduced  risk  from  flooding.  Similarly,\nalthough not relocated, families in the urban renewal areas will benefit from improved services\nsuch as water, sanitation, roads, lighting, security of tenure, and better access to the river.\n\n\f33\n\nThe household survey undertaken through TA 2803 (footnote 4) showed that residents\n120.\ngive  high  priority  to  environmental  improvements  to  enhance  their  quality  of  life.  Demand  for\nsanitation  has  been  assessed  for  Metro  Manila,  based  on  improving  the  combined  sanitation\nand sewerage coverage to 60 percent by 2003, 80 percent by 2011, and 85 percent by 2016.\nAffordability  analysis  is  also  based  on  the  household  survey.  The  cost  of  housing  for  the\nresettled  communities  can  be  afforded  by  the  poorest  5  percent  of  families,  assuming  that  25\npercent  of  income  is  available  for  housing  and  special  provisions  have  been  made  to  provide\nrent  assistance  to  the  lowest  income  families.  The  risks  to  affordability  are  that  the  current\nincome level of families is not sustained after relocating, however, the risks are considered to be\nrelatively low because livelihood enhancement programs have been built into the resettlement\nplans.\n\nThe  SDP  components  represent  the  most  cost-effective  options.  Alternatives  were\n121.\nconsidered  for  sanitation  and  urban  renewal,  and  were  found  to  be  higher  cost  options,  with\nimplementation difficulties. For the resettlement, housing will be procured from the private sector\nthrough  a  competitive  bidding  system,  enabling  the  Government  to  take  advantage  of  the\ncurrent weakness in the property market.\n\n122.\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the SDP and subjected to\nsensitivity  analysis.  Three  benefit  streams  were  valued,  including  (i)  the  willingness  of  Metro\nManila residents to pay for environmental improvements ensuing from the SDP, (ii) the benefits\nto  communities  resettled  from  the  riverside,  and  (iii)  the  benefits  of  urban  renewal  to  local\nresidents.  However,  some  important  benefits  could  not  be  valued,  including  the  effect  of  the\nSDP as a catalyst for further environmental improvements and in removing constraints to future\neconomic growth.\n\n123.\nThe  base  case  results  in  an  EIRR  of  16.0  percent,  which  exceeds  the  assumed\neconomic  cost  of  capital  of  10  percent.  Under  the  worst  case  sensitivity  test,  where  costs\nincrease by 10 percent and benefits decrease by 20 percent, the EIRR falls to 11.0 percent, but\nremains  above  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital.  Due  to  considerable  indirect  benefits\nthat  result  from  urban  environmental  improvements,  project  benefits  are  understated,  and  the\ntrue EIRR is likely to be higher. The detailed economic analysis is given in Appendix 16.\n\n2.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n124.\nThe  financial  evaluation  carried  out  for  the  sanitation  component  evaluates  financial\nperformance  and  pricing  of  services  under  three  scenarios.  For  each  scenario,  the  evaluation\nassumes that the required financial internal rate of return (FIRR) should be at least equal to the\nweighted average cost of capital for the scenario. In effect, the scenarios set the required FIRR,\nand  the  analysis  calculates  the  required  sanitation  fee  per  household to  deliver  that  rate  of\nreturn.  The  first  scenario  assumes  that  Government  will  finance  the  septage  collection  and\ntreatment operations, and the revenues from sanitation fees will be sufficient to cover operation\nand maintenance costs and debt service payments. This sets the lowest effective FIRR at 2.68\npercent.  The  second  scenario  evaluates  similar  financial  performance  objectives  but  assumes\nthat the capital investment finance will be secured from an existing finance facility offered by a\nGovernment  finance  institution  for  environmental  projects.  Under  this  scenario,  the  terms  of\nfinancing were assumed to be 11 percent interest with loan financing of 80 percent of the SDP\ncost.  This  produced  an  effective  FIRR  of  8.8  percent.  The  third  scenario  assumes  that  the\nfacilities  are  to  be  operated  on  full  commercial  terms  and  that  investment  decisions  are  made\nrelative  to  maximum  potential  yields  on  available  market  instruments  in  the  country,  such  as\nhigh  yield  bonds,  mutual  funds,  and  time  deposits,  giving  the  highest  effective  FIRR  of  18\n\n\f34\n\npercent.  The  evaluation  is  centered  on  determining  the  price  of  service  to  attain  the\nperformance  objectives  or  hurdle  rates  under  the  three  stated  scenarios.  In  this  way,  the\nGovernment  is  presented  with  policy  options  for  the  implementation  of  the  sanitation\ncomponent.  It  also  allows  the  evaluation  of  cost  recovery  options  against  affordability\nconsiderations under each scenario.\n\n125. Capital  costs  include  all  expenditures  related  to  the  construction  of  the  component,\nincluding land, civil works, equipment and materials, consulting services, and physical and price\ncontingencies.  Capital  costs  were  recorded  for  the  year  they  are  to  be  incurred.  Interest\npayments  and  depreciation  were  excluded  from  the  evaluation.  Operation  and  maintenance\ncosts  for  the  septage  collection  service  were  assumed  to  be  8  percent  of  capital  cost  for\nequipment. Operation and maintenance costs for the septage treatment plant were assumed to\nbe 5 percent of the capital cost of civil works, equipment, and materials.\n\n126. Under  the  performance  objectives  of  the  first  scenario,  the  combined  price  of  cleaning\none  septic  tank  and  treating  the  sludge  would  be  P1,858  in  1999  prices.  For  full  commercial\noperation,  the  price  of  collection  and  treatment  services  would  be  P4,861.  Currently,  private\ncompanies offer a septic tank emptying service charge about P2,600 per septic tank. However,\nthe  collected  septage  is  disposed  of  without  treatment;  this  is  environmentally  unacceptable.\nTable 3 shows the pricing and affordability indicators for each septic tank served. The detailed\nfinancial analysis is given in Appendix 17.\n\nTable 3. Pricing for the Sanitation Service\n(P per septic tank served)\n\nService\n\nSeptage Collection\nSeptage Treatment\n\nTotal\n\nScenario 1\n503\n1,355\n\n1,858\n\nPrice of Service\n\nScenario 2\n\n581\n2,116\n\n2,697\n\nScenario 3\n\n771\n4,090\n\n4,861\n\n3.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\n127.\nThe initial environmental examination was carried out by consultants in 1998 under TA\n2803 (footnote 4), and will be submitted to DENR for an environmental compliance certificate,\nwhen  the  selection  of  individual  sites  for  project  components  has  been  finalized.  The\nestablishment of EPAs along the river frontage is necessary to ensure safety, provide access for\nemergency  and  maintenance  purposes,  and  provide  recreational  amenities.  The  relocation  of\nsquatters from the EPAs will bring about considerable environmental improvements for the river\nand  riverbanks,  and  will  result  in  substantially  improved  living  conditions  for  the  relocatees  at\npurpose-built, fully serviced resettlement sites. The development of the urban renewal areas will\nintroduce basic infrastructure and essential municipal services into depressed areas, and result\nin  improved  living  conditions,  higher  public  health  standards,  and  a  better  environment.  The\nintroduction  of  sanitation  services  into  areas  with  zero  coverage  will  reduce  the  discharge  of\nBOD to the river system and raise public health standards in the affected areas. The negative\nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  SDP  are  mostly  temporary,  related  to  the  construction  phase.\nThese  negative  impacts  will  be  easily  mitigated  through  appropriate  engineering  design  and\nadequate construction management and supervision. In general, the environmental impacts of\nthe SDP are positive. The establishment of EPAs and development of urban renewal areas will\nprovide open space, parks, and green areas along the river frontage. The relocation of squatters\n\n\f35\n\nand  improvement  of  infrastructure  is  expected  to  reduce  the  direct  discharge  of  sewage  and\nsolid waste to the Pasig River.\n\n4.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n128.\nThe  Philippines  defines  the  poverty  threshold  as  the  minimum  income  needed  by  a\nfamily  to  obtain  privately  provided  food  and  basic  services.  Based  on  this  threshold,  which\nvaries regionally, the national incidence of poverty declined from 44 percent in 1985 to about 32\npercent in 1997, but rose sharply to about 38 percent in 1998 as a result of the Asian financial\ncrisis.  These  figures  fail  to  capture  the  scope  and  scale  of  Metro  Manila\u2019s  urban  deprivation,\nwhere the incidence of urban poverty was estimated at about 18 percent in 1997, but about 35\npercent of the urban population are squatters and slum dwellers living in unserviced or poorly\nserviced communities. The rate of job creation has not matched population growth, contributing\nto  downward  pressure  on  real  wages,  unemployment,  underemployment,  and  poverty.  It  is\nestimated that Metro Manila had an unemployment rate of 14.5 percent in 1997, higher than the\nnational rate, which was estimated at about 10 percent.\n\n129.\nFor  the  project  area  the  poverty  impact,  social  assessment,  and  affordability  were\ndetermined  through  an  affordability  analysis  based  on  the  household  survey,  undertaken  in\n1997,  under  TA  2803  (footnote  4).  The  survey  included  households  located  in  poor  riverside\ncommunities at Quiapo, and barangays 900 and 905. Since the riverbank communities that are\nresettled  will  pay  for  housing  at  the  resettlement  sites,  the  analysis  focuses  on  the  ability  of\nfamilies to pay the rent or amortization set out in the resettlement program prepared by HUDCC,\nthrough  NHA,  for  the  PRRC.  In  1999,  the  monthly  household  income  among  riverside\ncommunities  was  P2,560  for  the  lowest  5th  percentile,  ranging  to  P22,950  per  month  for  the\n95th  percentile.  The  mean  household  monthly  income  was  P8,350.  The  poverty  threshold  for\nMetro  Manila  is  about  P7,500  per  month  and  about  35  percent  of  households  affected  by  the\nproject  are  living  below  the  poverty  line,  which  is  almost  twice  the  rate  of  poverty  for  Metro\nManila  as  a  whole.  The  lowest  cost  housing  option  is  a  lot  with  a  core  house  at  a  choice  of\nlocations. For the first five years, families can rent; then in the sixth year, families are offered an\noption  to  purchase  at  a  set  amortization  rate.  The  monthly  rents  in  year  one  are  set  at  P400,\nrising each year at P200 per month. From year six onward, rents will increase at 10 percent per\nyear.  The  amortization  rate  is  set  at  P1,385  for  the  first  10  years,  rising  to  P2,243  for  the\nremaining 15 years. For the poorest 20 percent of families, 25 percent of income is assumed to\nbe  available  for  housing.  This  is  equivalent  to  P640  per  month,  which  exceeds  the  monthly\nrequirement  for  rent  from  the  first  year  onward.  For  the  remaining  80  percent  of  families,  20\npercent is assumed to be available for housing, and the rents are within the affordability range.\nThe affordability analysis shows that the rents will be affordable in the first five years, even to\nthe poorest 5 percent of families, as the amount available in 2003 exceeds the proposed rent of\nP1,200. In the sixth year, either rent or amortization will also be affordable to all income groups.\n\n130. Qualitative evidence also indicates that the rental and purchase options are affordable.\nThe  experience  of  NHA  shows  that,  when  offered  a  choice,  people  usually  select  the  more\ndesirable  housing  option,  even  if  it  is  not  the  least  expensive,  though  at  first  they  may  have\nindicated  that  it  was  not  affordable.  Also,  in  surveys,  people  tend  to  understate  income  and\noverstate  expenditures,  and  evidence  of  this  shows  in  the  widespread  ownership  of\nnonessential items like televisions and electrical appliances. Also, discussion groups held under\nTA  2803  (footnote  4)  and  recent  market  evidence  suggest  that  rents  paid  in  the  squatter\nsettlements along the riverbanks are approximately P500 per month for a small room, which is\nhigher than the first year rental cost for a house at the resettlement site.\n\n\f36\n\nThe risks to affordability are that the incomes and livelihood of residents are reduced as\n131.\na result of relocation, and that the livelihood program is not successful in raising the incomes of\nthe poorest families. Given that incomes are likely to be understated, and the rents are lower in\nthe  early  years  to  allow  families  to  adjust  to  their  new  location,  the  risks  are  considered  to  be\nlow. The poverty impact assessment is given in Appendix 18.\n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n132.\nThere is a risk that the SDP will not receive sufficient support from the Government and\nthat adequate counterpart funds will not be available. The high level of visible support from the\nGovernment,  which  has  adopted  the  Pasig  River  rehabilitation  as  a  key  priority,  suggests  that\nsuch  risk  is  small.  The  creation  of  the  PRRC  and  adoption  of  the  PRDP,  ahead  of  program\nimplementation  requirements,  further  suggests  a  high  level  of  support  and  commitment  to  the\nSDP.\n\n133. A  second  risk  concerns  the  possible  lack  of  enforcement  of  environmental  regulations\nand standards, and the shortage of qualified and experienced environmental management and\nmonitoring staff. Lack of enforcement in the past has resulted in many polluting industries and\nbusinesses  not  being  brought  into  compliance.  Major  efforts  are  needed  to  ensure  that\nadequate enforcement is properly undertaken, supervised, and reported, and that such activities\nare supervised and strengthened under the direction and guidance of the PRRC.\n\n134. A  third  area  of  risk  is  that  the  Government  will  meet  opposition  to  implementing  the\nproposed sanitation component from the MWSS concessionaires because they believe that the\nConcession  Agreement  gives  them  exclusive  rights  to  provide  sanitation  services.  The  OGCC\nhas  issued  a  legal  opinion  stating  that  the  concessionaires  do  not  have  exclusive  rights  to\nsanitation services. However, the concessionaires could challenge this opinion. The PRRC has\ninitiated  a  process  of  detailed  consultation  with  DPWH,  MWSS,  and  the  concessionaires  to\nexplain the Government\u2019s policy to rehabilitate the Pasig River, and seek the concessionaire\u2019s\nsupport.  The  PRRC  has  indicated  that  the  concessionaires  have  expressed  willingness  to\nsupport the Government\u2019s policy, but so far, no formal agreement has been reached. Delays in\nthe implementation of the sanitation component would impact on the success of the program.\n\n135.\nFinancial  analysis  of  the  proposed  septage  treatment  plant  indicates  that  the  facility  is\nfinancially viable and will generate a reasonable rate of return. Capacity-building assistance will\nbe provided to the DENR, PRRC, LLDA, and MMDA to support the enforcement of regulations,\nreview  of  investment  plans  for  the  disposal  of  septage  and  municipal  wastewater  for  Metro\nManila,  and  undertake  discussions  with  MWSS.  Implementation  of  the  PRDP  is  expected  to\nmeet  opposition from time to  time, but given that the proposals have been discussed in  detail\nwith all affected parties and stakeholders, it is considered realistic and achievable. In particular,\nall interested NGOs and civil society groups have fully supported PRDP implementation.\n\nThe reluctance of  squatters  to relocate is the major risk attached to the urban renewal\n136.\ncomponent. To address  this risk, particular attention has been given to the full participation of\naffected communities in the design and implementation of the resettlement plan. Relocation will\nbe kept to a minimum, and a choice of relocation options will be given to affected families at a\nvariety  of  in-city  apartment  buildings  and  close-to-town  house  and  lot  developments.\nResettlement will include the provision of social services, employment, and income-generating\nschemes.  The  resettlement  sites  will  be  developed  with  basic  infrastructure  facilities  and\n\n\f37\n\nmunicipal services.

To enable the PRRC to discharge its duties, EO 54 authorized P10 million to be\ngenerated  out  of  the  contingency  funds  for  its  initial  requirements.  Also,  the  Pasig  River\nDevelopment Council, the Presidential Task Force on Pasig River Rehabilitation, and the River\nRehabilitation  Secretariat  were  abolished  and  the  functions,  equipment,  and  logistics  were\ntransferred  to  the  PRRC.  Any  funds  received  by  the  abolished  agencies,  contributed  for  the\nrehabilitation  of  the  Pasig  River,  were  transferred  to  the  PRRC.  Figure  A3  presents  the\norganizational structure of the PRRC.\n\n2.\nThe  membership  of  the  PRRC,  based  on  EO  54  and  EO  65,  is  composed  of  (i)\nsecretary,  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM),  as  chairperson,  (ii)  chairperson,\nMetro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), as cochair, and (iii) secretaries and heads of the\nfollowing agencies: Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR); Department of\nthe Interior and Local Government (DILG); Department of National Defense (DND); Department\n(DOT);  Department  of  Transport  and\nof  Finance \nCommunications (DOTC); Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH); Department of\nTrade  and  Industry  (DTI);  Housing  and  Urban  Development  Coordinating  Council  (HUDCC);\nOffice of the Executive Secretary, Office of the President (OESOP); and three representatives\nfrom the private sector, appointed by the President.\n\n(DOF);  Department  of  Tourism \n\n3.\nThe  PRRC  has  the  following  powers  and  functions  to  achieve  its  mandate  of\nrehabilitating the Pasig River system: (i) prepare an updated and integrated master plan for the\nrehabilitation  of  the  Pasig  River  system,  taking  into  account  its  potential  for  transportation,\nrecreation, and tourism; (ii) ensure that the easements provided for in the Civil Code and other\nlaws are observed, including all the esteros and waterways that drain into the Pasig River; (iii)\nintegrate  and  coordinate  all  programs  related  to  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Pasig  River,  such  as,\nbut not limited to, the Pasig River Development Program (PD No. 274, Proclamation No. 704,\nSeries  of  1995),  and  the  Pasig  River  Environmental  Management  and  Rehabilitation  Sector\nDevelopment Program;1 (iv) abate the dumping of untreated industrial wastewater and sewage\ninto the river, including all acts and omissions in violation of the Pollution Control Law and other\nrelated  laws;  (v)  relocate  settlers,  squatters,  and  other  unauthorized  or  unlawful  occupants\nalong  its  banks;  (vi)  undertake  civil  works  for  the  purpose  such  as  dredging,  clearing  of\nstructures,  cleaning  of  the  rivers  and  all  the  esteros  and  waterways  that  drains  into  it;  (vii)\nsubmit regular reports to the Office of the President on the status of the Government\u2019s efforts on\nthe rehabilitation and development of the Pasig River; and (viii) coordinate with all Government\nagencies  and  offices,  including  local  government  units  (LGUs)  regarding  the  necessary\nmeasures to implement EO 54.\n\n4.\n\nThe implementing rules and regulations for the PRRC include\n\n(i) \n\nProceedings.

The  current\n1.\ncoverage  of  sewerage  in  the  Pasig  River  basin  is  about  10  percent,  and  for  sanitation  (septic\ntank  emptying)  is  about  15  percent.  Privatization  of  Metropolitan  Manila  Waterworks  and\nSewerage  System  (MWSS)  operations  provides  new  opportunities,  but  the  commitment  to\nexpanding sanitation services is limited, and the benefits from the sewerage program will not be\nrealized  until  after  2006.  The  low  assimilative  capacity  of  the  river  and  expected  increase  in\nwastewater generation indicate that even if the MWSS sewerage and sanitation targets are met,\nthe objective of achieving Class C water quality for the river will not be achieved. The sanitation\ncomponent will close this gap and increase the provision of sanitation services in the next five\nyears.  The  objectives  are  to  (i)  provide  a  septage  management  program  for  Makati,\nMandaluyong,  Pateros,  San  Juan,  and  Taguig,  local  government  units  (LGUs)  that  are  not\ncovered by the MWSS sanitation program; and (ii) provide a septage treatment facility.\n\n1.\n\nSeptic Tank Emptying\n\n2.\nThe MWSS sanitation targets for Makati, Mandaluyong, Pateros, San Juan, and Taguig\nare  zero  coverage  throughout  the  concession  period.  The  area  contains  about  230,000  septic\ntanks,  the  majority  of  which  are  not  desludged  regularly.  Projections  for  the  growth  of  septic\ntank numbers in the Pasig River basin are as shown in Table A6.1.\n\nTable A6.1: Septic Tank Projections in the Pasig River Basin\n\nLGUs\n\n2015\nNo.\n80,147\n88,983\n404,714\n194,105\n54,555\n103,484\n94,379\n123,109\n14,715\n27,507\n67,650\n1,253,348\n267,911\nLocal government units (LGUs) shown in bold type are those with zero sanitation coverage under the MWSS\nconcession agreements and are the focus of the septage collection service.\n\nManila\nPasay\nQuezon City\nCaloocan\nMandaluyong\nMakati\nMarikina\nPasig\nPateros\nSan Juan\nTaguig\n     Total\n     Project LGU Total\nNote:\n\n2000\nNo.\n78,926\n78,675\n337,068\n149,985\n50,106\n92,678\n70,476\n90,139\n11,272\n25,248\n51,597\n1,036,170\n230,901\n\n1998\nNo.\n82,792\n75,879\n332,823\n146,593\n50,049\n91,672\n68,139\n84,250\n10,948\n25,059\n51,952\n1,020,156\n229,680\n\n2010\nNo.\n79,740\n85,547\n382,165\n179,398\n53,072\n99,882\n86,411\n112,119\n13,567\n26,754\n62,299\n1,180,954\n255,574\n\n2005\nNo.\n79,333\n82,111\n359,617\n164,692\n51,589\n96,280\n78,444\n101,129\n12,420\n26,001\n56,948\n1,108,564\n243,238\n\n1993\nNo.\n79,234\n71,897\n327,988\n143,142\n49,907\n89,158\n66,783\n79,527\n10,139\n24,585\n52,839\n995,199\n226,628\n\n3.\nThe  sanitation  component  aims  to  provide  36  vacuum  trucks  for  septic  tank  emptying.\nTo provide for flexible operations, 20 trucks will have a capacity of 10 cubic meters (m3) and 16\ntrucks will have a capacity of 6 m3. The fleet will work a two-shift system and service an average\nof  four  septic  tanks  per  truck  per  day.  The  fleet  will  operate  for  260  days  per  year,  emptying\n37,000 septic tanks annually. The average desludging frequency for septic tanks is five years,\nand the service will cover 185,000 septic tanks in one complete five-year cycle. The service will\ndirectly benefit about 1.0 million people and will reduce the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)\npollution load to the Pasig River by about 16 tons per day (t/d).\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\n2.\n\nSeptic Treatment and Disposal Facility\n\n4.\nThe septage collected from the septic tanks is a partially stabilized organic sludge that\ncontains  pathogenic  organisms  and  requires  further  treatment  before  final  disposal  to  the\nenvironment. Metro Manila has little septage treatment capacity and most septage collected is\ndischarged, untreated, to rivers, esteros, open land, or the sea, causing environmental damage\nand nuisance. To treat and dispose the septage collected, a septage treatment plant (STP) will\nbe constructed, with a capacity of 600 m3/d.\n\n5.\n\nThe sanitation component design characteristics are shown in Table A6.2.\n\nTable A6.2.

As  MWSS  sewerage  and\nsewage treatment facilities are introduced, the use of septic tanks will be phased out. However,\nbased on the MWSS installation targets for sewerage, it is expected that the STP will be needed\nat least until 2021.\n\n7.\n\nThe STP will provide the following septage treatment processes:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nStabilization.  stabilization  of  partially  stabilized  septage  through  biological\ndigestion (either aerobic or anaerobic) and chemical stabilization using lime;\n\nDewatering. to produce a solidified end product suitable for handling with earth-\nmoving equipment; and\n\nPathogen  Reduction.  septage  contains  pathogenic  organisms  that  must  be\ninactivated during the treatment process.\n\n8.\n\nTo provide this level of treatment, the STP will comprise the following\n\n(i) \n\nReceiving Facilities. Septage will be delivered in vacuum trucks, and receiving\nfacilities  for  the  simultaneous  unloading  of  8  trucks  will  be  provided.  Septage\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nunloading will be by gravity to sealed connection points to avoid odor release; the\nseptage will flow by gravity to the screening station.\n\nPreliminary  Treatment.  Preliminary  treatment  will  include  mechanical  screens\nto  remove  large  objects,  rags,  and  other  stringy  materials,  and  aerated  grit\nchambers to remove hard, abrasive materials. The pretreated septage will pass\nto  a  pump  station  wet  well,  and  two  heavy-duty  diaphragm  pumps  will  pump\nseptage  to  one  of  two  septage  holding  tanks,  each  with  capacity  to  store  one\nday\u2019s  sludge  volume.  The  holding  tanks  will  be  equipped  with  thickener\nmechanisms to allow the septage to thicken prior to dewatering.\n\nSeptage  Dewatering.  Thickened  sludge  will  be  withdrawn  from  the  septage\nholding  tanks  by  two  sludge  pumps  and  pumped  to  one  of  two  centrifuges.  A\nconditioning polymer will be added to the septage prior to separation of the liquid\nand solid materials in the centrifuge. The solids concentration of the sludge cake\nshould  achieve  about  20  percent.  The  liquid  centrate  will  discharge  from  the\ncentrifuges  and  flow  to  a  wastewater  treatment  facility.  The  sludge  cake  will  be\ncollected from the centrifuges by a system of screw conveyors.\n\nChemical  Stabilization.  The  dewatered  sludge  cake  will  be  mixed  with\nquicklime  to  raise  the  pH.  The  heat  generated  from  the  chemical  reaction,\ncoupled with the high pH, reduces the pathogens in the sludge.\n\nLiquid  Waste  Treatment.  The  liquid  centrate  will  be  high  in  BOD  and  an\nactivated sludge process will be used to achieve an effluent that conforms to the\nrequirements  of  DENR  Administrative  Order  No.  35.  The  treated  liquid  effluent\nwill be discharged to the environment via the public drainage system.\n\nOdor Control. All process equipment will be located in buildings and all storage\ntanks will be covered. A ventilation system will be provided to extract air from the\ncontrolled areas to keep them under negative pressure at all times. The collected\ngases will be discharged through a soil filter.\n\n9.\nThe biosolids will be disposed of by land application, which benefits the land by recycling\nnutrients and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. Potential sites could be agricultural lands\nsurrounding Manila and land areas damaged by the volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. The land\narea required for the STP is about 5 hectares (ha), including an adequate buffer zone, which will\nbe landscaped.\n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental Preservation Areas\n\n10.\nFor the Pasig River system, the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) provided\na directive (MMDA No. 3 series of 1996) to all LGUs with river frontage to adopt a uniform 10\nmeter  (m)  easement  along  the  river  system,  including  its  tributaries,  to  ensure  (i)  on-shore\nsafety,  (ii)  access  for  emergency  and  maintenance  purposes,  and  (iii)  a  pleasant  riverside\nenvironment.\n\nfor \n\nDevelopment  plans \n\nthe  Pasig  River  banks  are  contained \n\n11.\nthe  Physical\nDevelopment  Framework  Plan,  1996-2016,  prepared  by  MMDA.  This  plan  identified  the\neasements as environmental preservation areas (EPAs), and depressed areas adjacent to the\nEPAs as urban renewal areas. It is estimated that about 10,000 families live in the designated\nEPAs.  These  families  are  living  in  dangerous  conditions  and  are  constantly  exposed  to  (i)\nfrequent  inundation  by  flood  waters,  (ii)  fire  hazard,  and  (iii)  major  public  health  risks  due  to\n\nin \n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\nunsanitary  living  conditions  and  exposure  to  waterborne  diseases.  Under  the  Project,  it  is\nproposed  to  rehouse  squatter  families  at  purpose-built  resettlement  sites  and  develop  urban\nrenewal areas to provide basic infrastructure and municipal services to improve living conditions\nand raise public health standards.\n\n1.\n\nRelocation\n\n12.\nApproximately  10,000  squatter  families  living  within  EPAs  will  be  relocated.  The\nrelocation comprises (i) the development of low-income housing projects near Metro Manila with\nfully  serviced  housing  lots;  a  core  house;  water,  sanitation,  and  electricity  connections;  and\naccess to a full range of community amenities including schools, health center, multipurpose hall,\nday-care center, livelihood opportunities, and recreation facilities; and (ii) apartments in medium-\nrise buildings on various sites within Metro Manila. Both housing options will be developed by the\nHousing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC), through the National Housing\nAuthority  (NHA),  in  joint  ventures  with  the  private  sector.  Relocatees  will  choose  their  housing\noption  based  on  individual  preference,  affordability,  and  willingness  to  pay.  The  units  will  be\noffered for rent for the first five years with an option to buy thereafter.\n\na.\n\nApartments in Medium-Rise Buildings\n\nApartments  will  be  developed  by  the  private  sector  in  joint  venture  with  NHA.  The  five-\n13.\nstorey walk-up units will provide 25 m2 fully serviced apartments. About 240 families are expected\nto  opt  for  this  alternative.  A  number  of  sites  have  been  identified,  including  C5-MRB\nCondominium in Taguig.\n\nb.\n\nSites and Services with Core housing\n\n14.\nFully  serviced  row  houses  will  be  provided  at  resettlement  sites  near  Metro  Manila,  for\nabout  9,260  families.  Several  potential  sites  have  been  identified,  including  the  principal  site  at\nRodriguez, Rizal, near Quezon City, to which  most  relocatees  are  likely  to  move.  The dwelling\nunits consist of a core house with a 20 m2 floor area on a 30 m2 plot.\n\n2.\n\nDevelopment of EPAs\n\nThe EPAs will be developed as riverside parks. The areas for each LGU are indicated in\n\n15.\nTable A6.3.\n\nTable A6.3.

Although the site location for the septage\ntreatment plant (STP) has not been finalized, site selection guidelines are indicated in the IEE,\nincluding  the  necessary  measures  needed  to  minimize  potential  adverse  environmental\nimpacts. When the site location is finalized, and the STP feasibility study is refined, the Pasig\nRiver Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC), the Executing Agency, will prepare an environmental\nsiting study for review by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and EMB.\n\nB.\n\nExisting Environmental Considerations\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Environment\n\na.\n\nEnvironmental Preservation Areas\n\n2.\nRegulations in the Civil Code provide for the establishment of easements along the river\nfrontage  to  ensure  safety,  and  access  for  emergency  and  maintenance  purposes.  Almost  the\nentire frontage of the Pasig River and its tributaries is occupied by slum and squatter colonies.\nThe  squatter  houses  often  protrude  into  and  obstruct  the  river  channels.  The  slum  extends\ninward covering public and private properties. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority\n(MMDA)  confirmed  through  MMDA  Resolution  No.  3  of  1996,  its  intention  to  enforce  the\nestablishment of  a  10-meter  wide  environmental preservation area (EPA) along both banks of\nthe river, and to provide recreational amenities. The designated EPAs and adjacent areas are\nsubject  to  flooding,  and  because  of  inefficient  solid  waste  collection  in  the  upstream  portions,\nconsiderable volumes of solid waste, silt, and other materials are carried into the houses. When\nthe floodwaters recede, the solid wastes are deposited and left to decompose on the walkways\nconnecting the houses and under the stilted housing structures.  In some sections of the Pasig\nRiver,  especially  in  Manila  and  Makati,  flooding  is  also  caused  by  high  tides.  In  areas  where\nslums have not developed, adjacent private property owners have encroached into the EPAs. In\nmany  cases,  private  property  owners  have  fenced  the  illegally  acquired  EPA  land  to  prevent\nsquatters from moving in. The soil is black, caused by decaying solid wastes and other organic\nmaterials. The air quality is poor due to the odor of decaying organic materials and smoke from\ndomestic  cooking  fires  burning  wood  and  other  scavenged  materials.  The  groundwater  and\nsurface  water  quality  are  poor  and  highly  polluted  from  the  decaying  solid  wastes  as  well  as\ninfiltration from the Pasig River.\n\nb.\n\nUrban Renewal Areas\n\n3.\nThe  urban  renewal  areas  cover  about  500  hectares  (ha)  of  private  and  public  land  at\ndifferent locations along the Pasig River and its tributaries. These areas are extensions of the\n\n1\n\n                  \n\nTA  2803-PHI: Pasig River Environmental Management and Rehabilitation Project,  for  $800,000,  approved  on  29\nMay 1997. The TA was completed in April 1998.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nslum  colonies  located  in  EPAs  along  the  river  frontage  and  are  not  provided  with  basic  urban\nservices. As a result, the environment is unsanitary due to inadequate excreta disposal, and the\nair  quality  is  poor,  caused  by  the  odor  generated  by  decaying  solid  wastes.  While  the  inland\nareas are not as flood prone as the river frontage land, the drainage systems are informal and\ninadequate, and the water flowing in the open drainage system is highly polluted.\n\nThe  resettlement  areas  at  Rodriguez  and  at  other  locations  outside  Metro  Manila  are\n4.\ngreen-field  sites,  occupying  about  50  hectares  of  land  zoned  for  residential  use.  The  existing\nland use is mainly low-grade grazing and agricultural land.\n\nc.\n\nSanitation\n\n5.\nThe sanitation service area covers residential, commercial, and institutional areas in the\nPasig  River  watershed.  The  service  area  does  not  have  a  sewerage  system.  The  drainage\nsystem serves as a combined sewer system draining the effluent from septic tanks. The water\nin the drainage system is septic. Foul odors are emitted from drainage service holes, especially\nduring  the  dry  season  when  the  dilution  rate  is  low  and  the  warm  weather  stimulates  rapid\nbacterial activity. The groundwater in the service area has been polluted by salt water intrusion\ndue  to  the  overextraction  of  groundwater  for  domestic  and  industrial  uses.  The  sanitation\ncondition in Pasig River watershed is discussed in paras. 32-34 of the main text.\n\n2.\n\nBiological Environment\n\na.      Environmental Preservation Areas\n\n6.\nThe terrestrial flora in the area are few and limited to ornamental plants and vegetables\ngrown  in  small  pots.  The  terrestrial  fauna  are  mostly  composed  of  insects,  rodents,  and\ndomestic animals. The aquatic life in the river is limited to surface breathing fish that survive in\nanaerobic conditions as well as insect larvae. During heavy rain, floating aquatic plants such as\nwater lilies and hyacinth are washed out into the area. There are no endangered species of flora\nor fauna in the area.\n\n \n\nb.\n\nUrban Renewal Areas\n\nThe  ecology  in  the  urban  renewal  areas  is  similar  to  that  in  the  EPAs.  There  are  no\n\n7.\nendangered species of flora or fauna.\n\nc.\n\nSanitation\n\n8.\nIn  high-  and  middle-income  residential  areas,  residents  have  gardens  with  lawns  and\nornamental  plants.  In  low-income  areas  the  conditions  are  similar  to  the  proposed  urban\nrenewal  areas.  However,  in  commercial  and  institutional  areas,  almost  the  entire  area  is\ncovered with concrete and  asphalt.  The fauna are typical of urban centers, primarily domestic\nanimals  and  other  life  forms  such  as  rats,  cockroaches,  flies,  and  mosquitoes  that  thrive  on\nurban wastes.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\n3.\n\nSociocultural Environment\n\na.\n\nEnvironmental Preservation Areas\n\n9.\nBecause  the  slums  are  largely  illegal  settlements,  there  are  few  provisions  for  basic\nurban  infrastructure.  There  is  inadequate  water  supply,  sanitation  services,  solid  waste\ncollection, drainage, and street lighting. Public primary schools have been built at the edges of\nslum areas. The local barangay hall serves as a multipurpose center, accommodating the local\nlaw enforcement authority (known as the barangay tanod), health clinic for visiting nurses and\ndoctors,  and  local  social  hall.  Household  incomes  are  largely  below  the  average  income  level\nand a significant number are below the poverty level.\n\nThe social conditions in the proposed urban renewal area are similar to conditions in the\n\n10.\nEPAs, however, the income levels are generally higher.\n\nb.\n\nUrban Renewal Areas\n\nc.\n\nSanitation\n\nThe socioeconomic conditions in the sanitation service area are described in para. 22 of\n\n11.\nthe main text.\n\nC.\n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Preservation Areas\n\nThe  negative  environmental  impacts  of  the  development  of  EPAs  are  related  to\n12.\nconstruction  activities;  these  are  temporary  and  short-term.  The  negative  impacts  during\nconstruction are related to dust, noise, and traffic congestion. A detailed resettlement plan has\nbeen prepared to mitigate the social impact of the relocation of approximately 10,000 squatter\nfamilies, and is summarized in Appendix 11. In general the long-term environmental impact of\nEPAs  is  positive.  EPAs  will  provide  open  space,  parks,  and  green  areas  along  the  river\nfrontage.  The  relocation  of  the  squatter  families  is  expected  to  reduce  the  daily  sewage  and\nsolid waste discharges to the Pasig River by 1,800 m3 and 12 tons, respectively.\n\n2.\n\nUrban Renewal Areas\n\nimpacts  are \n\n13.\nThe negative environmental impacts of the urban renewal component are mostly related\nto  construction  activities;  these  are  temporary  and  short-term  in  nature.  The  negative\nenvironmental \nlong-term\nsocioeconomic impacts are positive with the development and provision of basic urban services\nand  infrastructure  to  the  area,  issuance  of  land  titles  to  families  to  secure  their  tenure  to  the\nland,  and  improvement  of  economic  activities  that  normally  go  with  improvement  in\ninfrastructure and services. The long-term impact on the environment will also be positive with\nthe  reduction  of  the  sewage  and  solid  wastes  discharge  to  the  Pasig  River  and  its  tributaries\nestimated at 2 t/d of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).\n\nfrom  noise,  dust,  and \n\ntraffic  congestion.  The \n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\n3.\n\nSanitation\n\nThe negative impacts of the septic desludging operation are odor, nuisance, and noise.\n14.\nThese negative impacts are minimized by specially designed trucks with high-capacity, positive-\ndisplacement  pumps  and  flexible  pipe  connections.  The  high-capacity  positive-displacement\npump will minimize the time required to empty a septic tank, and reduce the volume of dilution\nwater needed to attain the desired slurry consistency. The special pipe coupling will reduce, if\nnot  eliminate,  the  risk  of  spillage  and  the  volume  of  water  needed  to  flush  the  equipment  and\npipes.  The  tanks  are  also  especially  designed  for  the  job  and  will  eliminate  spillage  during\nhauling. The septage treatment process design uses a physico-chemical treatment process to\nreduce the potential odor problem during treatment. The addition of lime will fix the malodorous\nhydrogen sulfide (this gives the rotten egg odor to decomposing organic matter). The physico-\nchemical treatment plant will be totally enclosed. Air vented from the plant will be scrubbed by\nan  activated  carbon  filter.  The  supernatant  will  be  treated  in  a  conventional  activated  sludge\nwastewater treatment plant prior to discharge to the environment. The dried sludge will be used\nfor soil conditioning.\n\n15.\nFor  site  selection,  the  STP  should  be  located  100  m  from  the  nearest  residential  area\nand will have a minimum area of 5 ha. The building and superstructure required to treat 600 m3\nper day of septage is estimated at 5,000 m2. A 20 m  buffer zone, planted with tropical trees, will\nbe  provided  around  the  STP.  Also,  the  parking  space  estimated  at  6,000  m2  will  provide\nadditional buffer zone. The entire STP site will be enclosed by a 2-m high fence.\n\nD.\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n16.\nDuring construction, the Executing Agency\u2019s (EA) project management office (PMO) will\nretain  four  safety  and  environmental  professionals.  One  of  the  safety  and  environmental\nprofessionals will serve as team leader and will report directly to the PMO\u2019s executive director.\nAt  any  time  during  the  construction,  one  safety  and  environmental  professional  will  be  on  the\njob. In addition, any contractor with a contract of more than P100 million will be required to hire\nand field one safety and environmental professional. The contractors\u2019 safety and environmental\nprofessional  will  maintain  a  construction  field  book  noting  all  safety  and  environmental\nconcerns,  especially  those  that  have  been  identified  in  the  IEE  report.  The  PMO\u2019s  safety  and\nenvironmental professional will note in the log book any deficiencies and measures required to\nimprove  the  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  in  addition  to  reports  to  the  PMO\u2019s\nexecutive director.\n\n17.\nThe PMO\u2019s safety and environmental officer will measure the noise level and dust level\nat  the  construction  site  at  least  once  per  working  shift  at  random  time  intervals.  The  EA  will\npurchase a noise meter and dust sampler prior to the execution of the contract.\n\n18.\nThe  sanitation  component  will  include  the  provision  of  laboratory  facilities  at  the  STP\nsite.  The  laboratory  will  be  capable  of  analyzing  for  BOD,  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD),\nsuspended solids, total nitrogen, phosphates, sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, color, pH, temperature,\nand  turbidity.  The  laboratory  will  be  also  equipped  to  measure  Escherichia  coli  most  probable\nnumber  (MPN).  Two  licensed  chemists  will  be  hired  to  monitor  the  quality  of  the  STP  effluent\nand  sludge.  The  effluent  quality  will  be  measured  every  four  hours  during  start-up  of  the\nprocess, once a day during the first six months of operation, and once a week thereafter. Once\nevery  six  months  the  laboratory  will  send  samples  of  the  sludge  to  a  reputable  laboratory  for\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\nanalysis of heavy metals and intractable chemicals that could affect the uses of the sludge. The\nheavy  metals  and  intractable  chemicals  analysis  will  preferably  include  measurements  for\nmercury,  cadmium,  lead,  chromium,  chlorinated  organic  compounds,  and  pesticides.  The\nsanitation services provider will collate and submit the monitoring results to ADB annually along\nwith the permits and notices from the relevant Government agency.\n\nE.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n19.\nThe  negative  environmental  impacts  of  the  SDP  are  temporary  and  reversible,  mostly\nrelated to the construction activities. The long-term negative environmental impacts are related\nto the resettlement of the families living in the proposed EPAs and those families that could not\nbe accommodated in the urban renewal project. The other long-term impacts of the SDP on the\nenvironment  are  positive,  mostly  related  to  the  (i)  reduction  of  sewage  and  solid  wastes\ndischarges to the Pasig River from the residential, commercial, and institutional establishments\nin  the  watershed;  (ii)  improvement  of  the  river  flow  regime  with  the  removal  of  obstructions\ncaused  by  the  squatter  settlements;  (iii)  provision  of  parks,  green  areas,  and  other  urban\namenities  in  approximately  23  km  EPA;  (iv)  provision  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  including\nthose related to health and environment to the blighted areas adjacent to the EPAs through the\nurban renewal subproject; and (v) reduction and elimination of high risk from floods and fire in\nheavily populated slums.\n\nF.\n\nConclusion\n\n20.\nThe SDP\u2019s negative environmental impacts are mostly short term and reversible, related\nto the construction activities in the development of the EPAs and basic infrastructure for urban\nrenewal.  The  long-term  environmental  impacts  of  the  SDP  are  mostly  positive  in  terms  of\nreducing the organic load to the Pasig River and its tributaries, improving health of the residents\nnear  the  river,  and  provision  of  more  parks  and  green  areas.  As  the  SDP\u2019s  long-term\nenvironmental impacts are mostly positive, a detailed environmental impact assessment is not\nrequired.\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe  summary  resettlement  plan  is  based  on  the  Resettlement  Action  Plan  (RAP)\n1.\nprepared for squatters living within the 10 meter wide environmental preservation areas (EPAs)\nalong the banks of the Pasig River. The RAP was prepared by the Housing and Resettlement\nCommittee  (HRC)  of  the  Pasig  River  Rehabilitation  Commission  (PRRC)  through  a  highly\nconsultative  process  with  affected  communities,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  local\ngovernment units (LGUs), and other stakeholders. Only informal settlers living within EPAs will\nbe affected by resettlement under the first phase of the Pasig River Development Plan (PRDP).\n\nB.\n\nScope of Resettlement\n\n2.\nIn 1997, the National Housing Authority (NHA) and the Department of Environment and\nNatural  Resources  (DENR),  in  coordination  with  local  government  units  (LGUs),  conducted  a\ncensus of households and tagging of structures within the EPAs, and registered 8,286 informal\nhouseholds, however, the 1999 census validation check indicated 10,000 households within the\nEPAs, as indicated in Table A11.1. This increase may be attributed to some underrecording in\nthe 1997 census and new arrivals.\n\nTable A11.1. 1997 Census of Households within EPAs\n\nLocal Government Units\n(LGUs)\n\nAffected Households\n\nMay 1999 Validation Survey\n\nManila\nMandaluyong\nPasig\nMakati\nPateros\nSan Juan\nTaguig\nQuezon City\nTotal\n\n1997 Survey\n2,272\n486\n537\n1,166\n924\n576\n467\n1,858\n8,286\n\n3,580\n516\n572\n1,236\n984\n611\n497\n2,004\n10,000\n\nC.\n\nSocioeconomic Information\n\n3.\nIn  1997,  a  socioeconomic  survey  was  carried  out  through  interviews  and  6,154  (75\npercent) households responded, while 2,082 (25 percent) households were either not available\nduring the census or refused to be interviewed. The total population of the surveyed households\nis  about  26,600  people,  giving  an  average  of  4.3  persons  per  household  in  the  EPAs.  The\nsurvey  shows  that  63  percent  of  households  are  the  owners  or  co-owners  of  the  housing\nstructure,  23  percent  are  renters,  and  14  percent  live  rent-free.  The  survey  shows  that  8,766\npersons  (33  percent)  are  employed,  equivalent  to  1.4  employed  persons  per  household.  The\nhousehold  income  data  appears  to  be  unreliable  and  has  probably  been  understated  in  many\ncases.  About  20  percent  of  households  that  participated  in  the  survey  declined  to  answer\nquestions about income, 5 percent indicated income below P2,000 per month; 30 percent were\nin the range P2,001-P4,000 per month and 21 percent of households had incomes ranging from\nP4,001 to P6,000; 9 percent have incomes in the range of P6,001 to P8,000; 5 percent range\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nfrom  P8,001  to  P10,000;  and  10  percent  have  income  in  excess  of  P10,000.  The  average\nhousehold expenditure is about P6,850 per month.\n\nD.\n\nResettlement Policies and Objectives\n\n4.\nThe  objective  of  the  RAP  is  to  facilitate  the  orderly  and  peaceful  relocation  of  about\n10,000  informal  households  currently  occupying  the  10-m  wide  EPAs  along  both banks  of  the\nPasig River. The objective is to ensure that the affected persons (APs) are relocated to secure\nand affordable socialized housing projects within or near Metro Manila. The purpose is to give\nthe APs a stake in the formal housing sector and thus remove them from squatting. The guiding\nprinciple  is  to  ensure  that  APs  will  be  at  least  as  well-off  after  relocation  as  they  are  in  their\npresent condition. To ensure this, a full range of mitigation measures are available to help APs\nto overcome the potentially adverse effects of moving from their current location.\n\nE.\n\nCommunity Consultation and Participation\n\nThe  Philippine  Constitution  requires  community  consultation  and  the  participation  of  all\n5.\nFilipinos  in  development  projects,  and  this  approach  has  been  institutionalized  in  the  Local\nGovernment Code.\n\nF.\n\nRedress of Grievances\n\n6.\nThe HRC has created an Awards and Arbitration Committee (AAC) in each sending LGU\nto determine qualified beneficiaries for resettlement, arbitrate in matters of claims and disputes,\nand safeguard the rights of the APs. The procedures for grievance redress were developed to\ndetermine the qualified beneficiaries living in the EPAs. Through the RAP, the procedures are\nexpanded  to  cover  the  actual  implementation  of  the  RAP  and  to  ensure  that  post-relocation\nproblems are properly addressed and satisfactorily resolved. Also, during the actual relocation\nand  after  relocation,  grievances  and  problems  may  be  brought  to  the  NHA,  Site  Management\nOffice for resolution and may ultimately be elevated to the HRC if satisfactory resolution is not\nachieved at the site level.\n\nG.\n\nThe Resettlement Scheme\n\n7.\nThe general approach to resettlement is to provide all affected families with the option of\nan  affordable  socialized  housing  package.  The  housing  package  options  comprise  (i)  an\napartment  in  a  five-storey  medium-rise  building  at  a  location  within  Metro  Manila;  (ii)  a  house\nand  lot  package  at  fully  developed  and  serviced  sites  at  a  choice  of  locations  near  to  Metro\nManila;  or  (iii)  a  serviced  housing  lot  upon  which  the  resettlers  will  construct  their  own  house.\nThe specific resettlement sites are given in Table A11.2.\n\nTable A11.2.

It is\n1.\nunsightly  and  malodorous,  poses  health  risks,  and  acts  as  a  constraint  to  socioeconomic\ndevelopment  of  the  surrounding  urban  areas.  Improving  water  quality  and  the  environment\nalong the banks of the river is a Government priority.\n\nB.\n\nApproach and Project Rationale\n\n2.\nThe  economic  analysis  was  made  for  the  Project  as  a  whole  as  the  primary  project\nbenefits  are  (i)  improved  water  quality  of  the  Pasig  River,  and  (ii)  improved  environmental\nquality  of  the  riverbanks  and  adjacent  areas.  These  benefits  are  generated  jointly  by  project\ncomponents and by other projects and policies outside the project scope.\n\nC. \n\nSituation With and Without the Project\n\n3.\nRiver pollution comes from three main sources: solid waste, industrial wastewater, and\ndomestic wastewater, of which domestic wastewater is the largest pollution source. The Project\nwill reduce the pollution load in the Pasig River from each of the three sources, with the greatest\nimpact  on  reducing  domestic  wastewater.  However,  it  is  expected  that  other  projects  and\nprograms  will  reduce  the  level  of  pollution,  particularly  in  the  long  term  as  investment  in\nsewerage takes place. The economic analysis assesses the incremental impact of the Project\nthe  environmental\non  water  quality  and \nimprovements due to other interventions.\n\nthe  urban  environment, \n\ninto  account \n\ntaking \n\nD.\n\nProject Beneficiaries\n\n4.\nThe  Project  has  three  physical  components:  (i)  sanitation,  including  collection  and\ntreatment of septic tanks sludge, known as septage; (ii) establishment of and improvements to\nenvironmental  preservation  areas  (EPAs)  along  the  riverbanks  from  which  squatters  will  be\nrelocated and the vacated areas developed for public access, amenity, and recreation; and (iii)\nurban renewal in areas adjacent to the EPAs.\n\n5.\nProject  beneficiaries  are  the  residents  of  Metro  Manila  who  will  benefit  from  the\nimprovement  of  an  unsightly  and  polluted  river  running  thought  the  city  center.  Specifically\nresidents  will  benefit  from  a  higher  standard  of  river  water  quality  and  environmental\nimprovements along the riverbanks through improved access to the river and from its economic\ndevelopment  and  recreational  potential.  In  addition,  squatter  families  relocating  from  the\nriverbanks  will  benefit  from  improved  living  conditions;  security  of  tenure;  better  health  from\nimproved water, sanitation, and other basic services; reduced contact with contaminated water;\nand reduced risk from flooding. Similarly, although not relocated, families in the urban renewal\nareas will benefit from improved services such as water, sanitation, roads, lighting, security of\ntenure, and better access to the river.\n\nE.\n\nProject Demand and Affordability\n\nThe  household  survey  undertaken  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  in\n6.\n1997  showed  that  residents  rank  improvements  to  the  environment  as  a  high  priority  to\nimproving the quality of life. Demand for sanitation has been assessed for Metro Manila, based\n\n\f87\n\nAppendix 16, page 2\n\non the anticipated growth in the number of septic tanks resulting from population growth and the\nincreased number of dwellings, and the relatively low sanitation and sewerage coverage targets\nto  be  provided  by  the  Metropolitan  Manila  Waterworks  and  Sewerage  System  (MWSS)\nconcessionaires.  These  coverage  targets  are  low,  particularly  up  to  2011  before  the  initial\nsewerage investment will be operational.1 Demand has been based on improving the minimum\ncoverage to 60 percent in 2003, 80 percent in 2011, and 85 percent in 2016.\n\n7.\nThe  affordability  analysis  is  based  on  the  household  survey.  The  declared  incomes\nsuggest that all families can currently afford the lowest cost house and lot option. Over the next\nfive years, the cost of housing provided under the program will increase in real terms. Assuming\nthat real incomes increase in line with the historic Metro Manila average, and that the livelihood\ncomponent of the relocation program will make an impact,2 the cost of housing for the resettled\ncommunities is affordable to the poorest 5 percent of families. In support of affordability analysis\nbased on incomes, current rent levels in the squatter areas are considerably higher than at the\nresettlement site (around 3 times for a basic house). In surveys, households tend to understate\ntheir  real  income,  while  previous  programs  of  the  National  Housing  Authority  (NHA)  showed\nthat, when offered a choice, people tend to opt for the more desirable option even if at first they\nconsidered it to be too expensive. The risks to affordability are that the current income level is\nnot sustainable once the families are relocated. However, considering the low cost of rent in the\nearlier years, to give people time to adjust the livelihood program and the fallback mechanisms\nincorporated in the Resettlement Plan, the risks are considered to be low.\n\nF.\n\nAlternative Options and Least Cost Analysis\n\nStandard  least  cost  analysis,  in  economic  terms,  has  not  been  carried  out,  but  for  two\n8.\ncomponents,  alternatives  were  considered.  For  the  resettlement  component,  the  innovative\napproach to providing low-cost housing through the private sector is considered as a proxy for\nthe least cost, in economic terms.\n\n9.\nFor sanitation, two alternatives were considered, which achieve an equivalent reduction\nin biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) pollution load for the same stretch of river as the Project.\nThe  first  alternative  is  to  provide  conventional  sewerage  in  an  area,  which  will  remove  the\nequivalent  amount  of  BOD  from  the  Pasig  River  (16  tons  per  day),  treat,  and  dispose  of  the\nwaste material. The financial cost of this alternative is estimated at P3,000 million ($80 million).\nHowever,  this  option  has  considerable  implementation  difficulties  as  under  the  MWSS\nConcession Agreement, the exclusive rights to provide sewerage services in Manila are held by\nthe concessionaires and implementation of this option would require the Concession Agreement\nto be renegotiated.\n\n10.\nThe  second  alternative  is  to  construct  sewers  to  intercept  the  existing  combined\ndrainage system and convey wastewater to an outfall that would discharge beyond Manila Bay.\nThis option would also include stormwater overflows that would discharge into the Pasig River,\nbut  under  storm  conditions,  wastewater  is  diluted.  However,  to  achieve  the  same  degree  of\npollution reduction, the interceptor sewers must be located upstream, increasing cost. While this\noption would remove more pollution load than the Project, sunk costs are high. To achieve the\nsame  pollution \ninvestment  costs  would  not  decrease\nproportionately.  The  financial  cost  of  this  alternative  is  estimated  at  P5,700  million  ($150\n\nload  reduction  as \n\nthe  Project, \n\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n1 Assumed 75 percent of those served by sewerage are connected.\n2 Assumed, 10 percent additional growth in real incomes for the poorest 20 percent, once the livelihood program has\n\nbeen fully established.\n\n\f88\n\nAppendix 16, page 3\n\nmillion).  In  addition,  the  outputs  are  not  equivalent  to  the  Project  because  disposing  of\nwastewater to the sea has environmental impacts and other costs, which should be internalized\nfor true economic comparison. The project option is clearly the least-cost financial option, and\nthis  is  considered  a  reasonable  proxy  for  the  least-cost  economic  option,  given  the  large\ndifference in financial costs.\n\n11.\nFamilies  to  be  relocated  will  be  offered  a  range  of  locations,  including  apartments  in\nmedium-rise  buildings  or  a  house  and  lot.  Housing  development  will  be  undertaken  by  the\nprivate  sector,  following  a  competitive  bidding  process  organized  by  NHA.  NHA  received  68\nproposals, and bids were evaluated according to set criteria including price, location, scope for\nexpansion, additional features, delivery date, and terms and conditions of payment. In addition,\nNHA has taken advantage of the fall in property prices to provide accommodation for relocating\nfamilies at least cost. This method of providing low-cost housing is considered to deliver a cost-\neffective solution.\n\n12.\nThe Project will provide varying levels of infrastructure improvements to areas where the\nurban  fabric  has  deteriorated,  and  the  levels  of  infrastructure  services  are  poor.  The  Project\nuses two pilot areas, Punta and Santolan, for urban renewal, land titling, flood prevention, and\nimprovements to services. The Project allows communities and local governments to decide on\nthe appropriate level of upgrading required. The alternative to urban renewal involves relocation\nof  families,  demolition,  and  redevelopment.  The  financial  cost  per  family  of  upgrading  is\napproximately  one  tenth  of  the  cost  of  relocation,  and  is  estimated  at  P22,000  per  family\ncompared  with  P180,000  per  family  for  resettlement.  The  financial  least  cost  is  considered  to\ndeliver  the  same  choice  of  option  as  the  economic  least  cost,  given  the  socioeconomic\nimplications of resettlement and the scale of the difference in financial costs.\n\nG.\n\nScope\n\nHaving  considered  project  demand  and  alternatives,  the  economic  analysis  estimates\n13.\nthe economic costs and economic benefits, and computes the economic internal rate of return\n(EIRR) and net present value (NPV) for the Project as a whole.\n\nThe economic analysis uses the domestic price numeraire, given that the project outputs\n14.\nare nontradable in nature. The project life is assumed to be 25 years. The economic opportunity\ncost of capital (EOCC) is taken as 10 percent as there are many benefits that cannot be valued,\nand the computed economic internal rate of return (EIRR) will likely understate the true worth of\nthe Project.\n\n15.\nThe analysis tests the sensitivity of the results by considering a 10 percent increase in\ncosts and a 20 percent decrease in benefits. The benefit decrease is considered appropriate as\nit  reflects  the  risks  associated  with  valuing  the  benefits  of  environmental  projects  of  this  type.\nThe effect of delaying the benefits by one year is also considered.\n\nH.\n\nCosts\n\n16.\nFinancial  costs  are  converted  to  economic  costs.  Taxes  are  excluded,  at  the  rate  of  5\npercent  for  land,  10  percent  value-added  tax  (VAT)  for  relevant  costs,  and  15  percent  import\nduty.  Unskilled  labor  is  assigned  a  conversion  factor  of  0.6,  in  line  with  other  recent  projects.\nLand  is  assigned  a  conversion  factor  of  0.2  for  the  resettlement  component,  valued  at  its\nopportunity  cost,  based  on  land  values  for  residential  and  agricultural  land.  For  other\ncomponents,  where  land  is  within  Metro  Manila,  no  conversion  factor  is  used  for  land.  The\n\n\f89\n\nAppendix 16, page 4\n\nresults of the analysis are not sensitive to changes in these conversion factors. Tradable items\nare  assigned  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF)  of  1.21,  the  reciprocal  of  the  standard\nconversion  factor  (SCF),  which  is  0.82.  No  conversion  factors  are  used  for  other  items.  Table\nA16.1 shows the total economic costs for the Project.\n\nI.\n\nBenefits\n\n1.\n\nValued Benefits\n\n17.\nThree  benefit  streams  are  valued.  The  first  benefit  stream  is  a  proxy  for  the  residents\u2019\nwillingness  to  pay  for  environmental  improvements  and  improved  water  quality  in  the  Pasig\nRiver. This is measured using the current environmental tariff of 10 percent surcharge on water\nbills for those not connected to the sewer system and the 50 percent surcharge for those who\nare  connected.3  However,  not  all  of  the  environmental  and  water  quality  improvements  are\nattributable to the Project. The benefit stream allocated to the Project reflects the proportion of\nthe  estimated total  reduction in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), that occurs as a result of\nthe Project. This is proportionate to the estimated pollution load reduction that would happen, as\na result of other programs and projects. In 2003, 34 percent of the estimated total pollution load\nreduction  occurs  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  By  2021,  only  7  percent  of  the  pollution  load\nreduction is attributable to the Project.\n\n18.\nBenefits  to  the  relocated  families  include  services,  such  as  water,  sanitation,  lighting,\nroads, improved health and safety, and security of tenure. These improvements are captured in\nthe rental that families will pay at the new resettlement sites. Benefits are valued using the least-\ncost property option, rental in the first five years, and then amortization from year six onward, in\nconstant price terms.\n\n19.\nUrban  renewal  increases  the  economic  value  of  the  property  in  the  area,  which  is\nreflected  in  a  person\u2019s  willingness  to  pay  an  increased  financial  price  for  the  property.\nComparison  of  similar  areas  with  different  levels  of  services  and  amenities  indicate  the\neconomic  price  of  service  level  improvements.  Reliable  data  on  the  value  of  properties  is\nunavailable  and  would  be  difficult  to  assess  as  the  market  is  severely  distorted  by  the  lack  of\nland title and transaction difficulties. The benefits of upgrading are valued using willingness to\npay  evidence  from  the  household  survey.  Residents  of  urban  renewal  areas  demonstrate  a\nwillingness  to  pay  P153  per  household  per  month  for  improved  water,  sanitation,  and  roads.\nThis gives an annual willingness to pay of P1,850 per household. Under the same survey, the\nwillingness to pay for security of tenure was on average P560 per month or P6,700 per annum.\nThis gives total benefits of P471 million per year.\n\n2.\n\nNonvalued Benefits\n\n20.\nThe valued benefits attempt to capture the overall worth of the Project, and incorporate\nspecific  benefits  such  as  health,  flood  aversion,  safety,  and  amenity.  However,  due  to\nconsiderable  indirect  benefits  that  result  from  urban  environmental  improvements  of  this  type,\nproject benefits are likely to be understated.\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n3 The concession agreements for water and sewerage provision include one-time increases in tariffs in 2003, to 75\npercent  for  those  households  not  connected  to  the  sewerage  system  and  150  percent  for  those  households  that\nare connected. These increases have not been included in the valuation, as there is no evidence that consumers\nare willing or able to pay for these increases. Water consumption is assumed to remain constant and the number of\nhouseholds is assumed to grow at the Manila average of 1.6 per annum. These assumptions are conservative and\nare likely to understate the true value of environmental benefits.\n\n\f90\n\nAppendix 16, page 5\n\nThe relocation of families along the river and establishment of the EPAs is a precondition\n21.\nfor the successful implementation of the Pasig River Development Plan, which will improve the\nenvironment  of  Metro  Manila.  Without  resettlement,  the  rehabilitation  of  the  river  and  in\nparticular, the environmental improvement of the river banks would not occur.\n\n22.\nSimilarly,  the  rehabilitation  of  the  river,  and  water  quality  improvement  will  remove  a\nconstraint to economic development in the center of the city. While not driving growth directly,\nenvironmental improvement will act as a catalyst for further improvements along the river, and\nhelp the area along the Pasig reach its economic potential.\n\nJ.\n\nResults\n\nTable A16.2 shows the economic costs and benefits of the Project and the calculation of\n23.\nthe  EIRR.  Table  A16.3  shows  a  summary  of  the  results  of  the  economic  analysis.  The  base\ncase results in an EIRR of 16.0 percent, which exceeds the assumed economic cost of capital\nof  10  percent.  The  net  present  value  (NPV),  discounted  at  10  percent,  is  P1,775  million,\nequivalent to $46.5 million. The EIRR falls to 11.0 percent under the worst case scenario of the\nsensitivity analysis, where costs increase by 10 percent and benefits are reduced by 20 percent,\nwhich  is  considered  unlikely.  Under  no  scenario  did  the  EIRR  fall  below  the  EOCC,  however,\nthe EIRR falls below the EOCC if costs increase by more than 33 percent, or benefits decrease\nby more than 25 percent.\n\nConsidering the importance of benefits that have not been valued, the reported EIRR is\n\n24.\nlower than the true EIRR for the Project, which is considered to be much higher.\n\nTable A16.3.

The  poverty  impact  assessment\nevaluates the project impact using data from previous studies, focus group discussions, and the\nfindings of the willingness-to-pay survey, representing about 20 percent of the affected people in\ntarget communities.\n\nB.\n\nHousehold Income and Expenditures\n\n2.\nThe effective household income comprises the earnings of all workers in the household\nplus  additional,  regular  sources  of  income  such  as  from  rents  and  remittances.  About  one\nquarter  of  households  surveyed  receive  additional  regular  income.  The  effective  household\nincomes vary from about P2,300 per month for the lowest 5 percentile to more than P21,000 per\nmonth.  The  mean  household  income  is  P8,200  per  month  and  mean  monthly  expenditure  for\nhouseholds is P6,851.\n\nC. \n\nThe Impact of Project Components on the Poor\n\n1.\n\nSeptage Management\n\nThe  septage  management  component  will  involve  operating  and  maintaining  a  septic\n3.\ntank cleaning program and providing a septage treatment facility. A survey was made to assess\nthe present conditions of families and their views on domestic wastewater management. Of the\ntotal  households  surveyed,  38  percent  have  access  to  a  sanitary  drainage  system  and  32\npercent  dispose  wastewater  directly  into  the  Pasig  River.  About  90  percent  of  the  households\nhave individual toilet facilities, the rest use a neighbor\u2019s toilet or public toilet. Almost one third of\nthe  households  do  not  know  how  the  septic  tank  is  emptied.  Only  44  percent  of  respondents\nrecognize the need to improve wastewater facilities; most people do not consider that improved\nsanitation facilities are important. The problem is particularly acute in Quiapo where 82 percent\nof the squatters in the area dispose of wastewater directly into the river. The squatter settlement\nin Punta is partly served by a sanitary drainage system, but in the area wastewater disposal to\nthe  river  and  canals  is  also  prevalent.  Of  those  respondents  who  recognize  the  need  for\nsanitation  improvements,  92  percent  indicated  a  willingness  to  pay  up  to  P50  per  month  for\nservices.\n\n2.\n\nUrban Renewal Areas\n\n4.\nFor  people  living  in  depressed  areas  outside  the  environmental  preservation  areas,\nregularization of land tenure and on-site upgrading is the preferred approach of the community,\nrather than relocation. Demonstration sites to illustrate the viability of slum upgrading have been\nidentified  in  Manila  and  Pasig.  The  upgrading  will  involve  regularization  of  land  tenure  and\ndevelopment  of  (i)  roads  and  footpaths;  (ii)  drainage  system;  (iii)  water  supply;  (iv)  street\nlighting;  and  (v)  basic  social  services  such  as  health  centers,  barangay  hall,  and  day-care\ncenter.  The  Project  offers  many  potential  benefits  such  as  security  of  land  tenure,  which\nencourages householders to invest their own resources in house improvement and expansion;\nhealth  benefit  as  a  result  of  improved  sanitation,  drainage,  and  water  supply;  improved\naccessibility  and  mobility  to  schools,  markets,  and  work  places;  and  social  welfare  benefits.\n\n\f95\n\nAppendix 18, page 2\n\nOwnership of land is important to the affected families, and people have indicated a willingness\nto  pay  up  to  P5,000  per  month,  depending  on  household  income.  A  significant  number  of  the\nfamilies want to take part in a mortgage program.\n\n3.\n\nEnvironmental Preservation Areas\n\n5.\nThis component will involve the relocation of about 10,000 squatter families from the 10-\nmeter environmental preservation areas (EPAs) along the banks of the Pasig River to various\nresettlement  sites.  Squatter  families  are  often  low-wage  earners  employed  as  construction\nworkers, artisans, or casual laborers. Large numbers of riverbank squatters are migrants from\nthe rural areas. They came to Manila to find employment and improve their quality of life. Upon\narrival in Metro Manila, squatting is the only affordable, low-cost housing solution available, and\nsquatting  offers  flexibility  and  ease  of  entry  to  the  housing  sector.  The  primary  locational\nmotivation  is  access  to  employment.  Because  incomes  are  low  and  work  hours  long,  most\npeople  do  not  want  to  spend  time  and  money  on  travel  to  work.  Therefore,  the  key  criteria  in\nchoosing relocation sites are access to existing sources of livelihood, availability of alternative\njobs, secure housing, and access to basic welfare services.\n\nD.\n\nAffordability of the Housing Options\n\nThe lowest cost housing option offered to relocating families is a core house at a choice\n6.\nof locations. For the first five years, families may rent; in the sixth year, families will be offered\nan  option  to  purchase  at  a  set  amortization  rate.  The  rents  in  year  one  are  set  at  P400  per\nmonth,  rising  each  year  at  P200  per  month  until  year  six.  After  year  six,  rents  increase  at  the\nrate of 10 percent each year. For house purchase, the amortization rate is set at P1,385 for the\nfirst  10  years  rising  to  P2,243  for  the  remaining  15  years.  Table  A18.1  shows  the  monthly\nincome distribution identified from the household survey and the income available for housing.\nFor  the  poorest  20  percent  of  families,  25  percent  of  income  is  assumed  to  be  available  for\nhousing.  For  the  remaining  80  percent  of  families,  20  percent  is  assumed  to  be  available  for\nhousing.  The  estimated  amounts  available  for  housing  for  each  percentile  are  shown  for  the\nyears 1999 to 2003. The projections take into account inflation, real growth in incomes, and the\nimpact of the livelihood program on the poorest families.1 The analysis shows that the rents will\nbe affordable to the poorest 5 percent of families. Also, the amount available in 2003 exceeds\nthe proposed rent at P1,200. In the sixth year, either rent or amortization will also be affordable\nto all.2 In addition, the following qualitative evidence suggests that the options are affordable:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nExperience from NHA shows that when offered a choice, people opt for the more\nexpensive  housing  option  over  the  less  desirable  option,  even  if  at  first  they\nindicate that it is too expensive.\n\nOwnership of nonessential items such as television sets is widespread, indicating\nthat considerable discretionary spending income is available.\n\n                  \n\n1 Inflation assumed at ADB rates. Real income growth assumed at 3.5 percent per year, in line with the average for\nManila.  The  livelihood  program  is  assumed  to  increase  the  incomes  of  the  poorest  20  percent  of  families  by  10\npercent per annum, once the program is in place. The livelihood program is detailed in the Resettlement Plan.\n\n2 Inflation and real income growth are assumed to continue at 6 percent and 3.5 percent.\n\n\f96\n\nAppendix 18, page 3\n\n(iii) \n\nDiscussion  groups  held  under  the  technical  assistance3  and  recent  market\nevidence  suggest  that  rents  paid  in  the  squatter  settlements  are  approximately\nP500 per month for a bed space, higher than the cost of a house in the first year\nat the resettlement site.\n\nTable A18.1.
